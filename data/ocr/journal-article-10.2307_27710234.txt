<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wyndham Lewis's Tarr: An (Anti-)Vorticist Novel? Richard W. Sheppard, Magdalen College, Oxford Although a relatively neglected novel, Wyndham Lewis's Tarr has a claim to a place in the Modernist canon, and the twenty years that it took for Tarr to reach the form in which it is most readily availablel indicates that it was of considerable significance for Lewis's early cre ative life as well. Nevertheless, Lewis himself, a notoriously slippery narrator at the best of times (who has been called a "disengaged cre ator" by one critic2 and who, according to Jameson, has been charac terized by an unwillingness "to identify himself with any determinate class position or ideological commitment" [p. 17]), has said very little about Tarr?and what he has said is marked by inconsistency. For example, Lewis begins the "Prologue" to the first edition by being extremely positive about Tarr, but then, almost immediately, he be comes negative about his hero (pp. x-xi); and, having praised Tarr in that same "Prologue" for "exalting Life into a Comedy" (p. xi), he concludes the novel by attacking Chaplinesque humour and "the wor ship of the ridiculous" in its "Epilogue" (pp. 319?20). In the 570 pages of the Letters, there are only twenty references to Tarr, and of these, fewer than ten are of any significance. Moreover, the significant refer ences are ambiguous in two respects: Lewis's letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver, the editor of The Egoist, probably written in March 1916, dis 1 If we are to believe Lewis's "Prologue" to the first (book) edition of Tarr (p. ix), he began writing that novel in 1907 when he, like Tarr s eponymous hero, was living in Paris. "The Pole"?a short story from the same epoch that was first published in The English Review (2 [1909], 255-65)?derives from a similar inspiration, its main charac ter, Isoblitsky, being a clear prototype of Kreisler, one of the four main characters of Tarr; and in an undated letter to the painter Augustus John, probably written in 1910, Lewis announced that he had finished writing his novel?presumably an early draft of Tarr (The Letters of Wyndham Lewis, ed. W. K. Rose [London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1963], p. 45). Nevertheless, the final draft was actually set down between late 1914 and No vember 1915 (Letters, pp. 64-65), and serialized in The Egoist between April 1916 and November 1917, with a somewhat modified version appearing in book form in June 1918. A second (book) edition of Tarr appeared in late 1928 (Letters, pp. 180-81), and although this version differs significantly from the first edition, it is not uncommon for critics to cite it as though it were to all intents and purposes the same as its predecessor (see, for instance, the chapter on Tarr in Fredric Jameson, Fables of Aggression: Wyndham Lewis, the Modernist as Fascist [Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1979]). In this article, all references to Tarr are to the first edition unless otherwise indicated. 2 William H. Pritchard, Wyndham Lewis (New York: Twayne, 1968), p. 24. Journal of English and Germanic Philology?October ? 1989 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois</page><page sequence="2">Wyndham Lewis's Tarr 511 plays considerable uncertainty as to the extent to which he identifies with Tarr (p. 76), and where Lewis's letter to the editor of the TLS of 27 September 1947 indicates that he thought of Tarr as "a realistic narrative" (p. 415), his letter to Hugh Kenner of 23 November 1953 asserts the abstract, experimental, and generally "extremist" nature of the novel (pp. 552-53). The same elusiveness marks Lewis's retro spective and autobiographical writings. Wyndham Lewis the Artist: From "Blast to Burlington House" (London: Laidlaw and Laidlaw, 1939) [hereafter WLM] never mentions Tarr; and where Blasting and Bom bardiering (1937) (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1967) [hereafter BB] speaks of Tarr in qualified negations only, saying that "it was not . . . the first book in European literature to display a certain indif ference to bourgeois conventions, and an unblushing disbelief in the innate goodness of human nature" (p. 88), Rude Assignment (written 1946) (London: Hutchinson, [1950]) [hereafter RA] contradicts that statement, calling the novel, flatly, "humanist" (p. 129). Furthermore, one looks in vain?in both Lewis's letters and Lewis's autobiographical writings?for any hint as to why he should have revised the first edi tion so drastically and for any indication of the criteria by which that revision was undertaken. The secondary literature on Lewis reproduces Lewis's omissions, elusiveness, and contradictoriness. The two major works on Vor ticism3 devote only a handful of pages to Tarr. Furthermore, it is evi dent that Tarr s readers have, since the earliest years, been puzzled, if not confused, by the contradictory attitudes which are evinced by its narrator and woven into the very fabric of the text. Thus, T. Sturge Moore, writing to Lewis, probably in September 1918, said that he wished that its hero "had either been more frankly you or more wholly distinct from his creator" (Letters, p. 99); T. S. Eliot, reviewing Tarr in The Egoist in the same month, stated both that Lewis's "interest in his own personages" was "wholly intellectual" (p. 105) and that Lewis's work involved "the energy of the cave-man" (p. 106); and a recent book of essays on Lewis presents Tarr simultaneously as "strong, vital and creative," a catalyst of Nietzschean "metaphysical gaiety,"4 and as an intellectual who "goes slumming for sex."5 It took a critic who had assimilated Marxist dialectics and the Deconstructionist 3 William C.

Given the above situation, it is, perhaps, not surprising that com mentators rarely make any connection between Tarr and Vorticism? even though the novel's first edition was written down right in the middle of the Vorticist period. Neither Jameson nor Meyers's collec tion of essays raises this issue; and Materer and Cork only go as far as to say, respectively, that "the best gloss on [Tarr's] severe view of life appears in a blast editorial called "The Exploitation of Vulgarity,"6 and that "Lewis made [Tarr] the spokesman for thoughts and opin ions that had already been argued in the staccato prose of Blast No. 1" (1, 273). The most pertinent explanation for this gap was implicitly provided by Wees when he contrasted the formal conservatism of Tarr with the boldness of Blast (pp. 198-99): the modernism and abstrac tion of the Vorticists are so far removed from the relatively traditional form and realistic (Parisian) setting of Tarr that it seems unthinkable to claim a close relationship between them. Nevertheless, it can be argued that such a relationship exists. Besides repeating polemics about art, humor, and Englishness that are to be found in Blast, Tarr provides an actantial context in which ideas that are central to the ethic and aesthetic of Vorticism are given imaginative substance and investigated. Accordingly, this article will offer a reading of the two (book) versions of Tarr in relation to Lewis's Vorticist ideas and argue that the novel implicitly demonstrates the limitations of those ideas. Looking back on the modern "-isms" which flourished all over Eu rope around the time of the Great War, Lewis wrote: "In every case the structural and philosophical rudiments of life were sought out. On all hands a return to first principles was witnessed" (BB, p. 257). Now, although Vorticism was not a uniform or self-consistent move ment, and although Lewis as an individual was uncertain and incon sistent over several major metaphysical issues,7 Lewis's version of Vor 6 Timothy Materer, Wyndham Lewis the Novelist (Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, !976)' P-56- See also p. 57. 7 For example, Lewis was theoretically uncertain about the relationship between hu man, psychic energy and the vital energies of Nature, and confused as to whether form was inherent in Nature or an imposition on Nature by man; cf. Timothy Materer, Vortex: Pound, Eliot and Lewis (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell Univ. Press, 1979), pp. 116-17; Richard Sheppard, "Expressionism and Modernism: An Analytical Comparison," in Facets of European Modernism, ed. Janet Garton (Norwich: Univ. of East Anglia Press, 1985), pp. 149-74</page><page sequence="4">Wyndham Lewis's Tarr 513 ticism involved, in mid-1914 (when Blast 1 was published), a violent polemic against certain aspects of the contemporary, liberal world and the propagation of two, conjoint "first principles" that, in his view, should determine both life and art: raw energy and rigidly abstract machine-forms. Hence parallel statements like: we need the unconsciousness of humanity?their stupidity, ani malism and dreams. we only want the world to live, and to feel it's [sic] crude energy flowing through us.8 and: The work of this group of artists [the embryonic Vorticist group] for the most part underlines such geometric bases and structure of life. . . . All revolutionary painting to-day has in common the rigid reflections of steel and stone in the spirit of the artist; that desire for stability as though a machine were being built to fly or kill with.9 By mid-1915 (when Blast 2 was published), the polemic (now notice ably more anti-German) against aspects of the contemporary, liberal world is still much in evidence, but the manner in which Lewis is propagating his two "first principles" has changed significantly. Where, at the time of Blast 1, Lewis was advocating these as though they were two poles of a paradox, by the time of Blast 2, in such suc cinct pieces as "The London Group 1915" (written in March 1915) and "Vortex No. 1" (pp. 77-78 and 91), he was depicting the ideal human personality and the ideal work of art as a synthesis or fusion of these principles (see Cork, 1, 254; Wees, p. 177). Consequently, at a very obvious level, Tarr can be seen as a con tinuation of various aspects of Lewis's Vorticist polemic. Bertha Lunken, for example (German Halunke 'scoundrel, rogue'), repre sents values that have a very clear place in the Vorticist demonology. "Big Bertha" (the nickname for Krupp's massive cannon and current by the end of 1914) is the representative of "the kind of [official] Ger manic culture encountered in Hauptmann and Sudermann" (RA, p. 149) that was attacked most explicitly in the "Editorial" of Blast 2 (p. 5). She also represents a heavy, supranational "femininity" that was anathema to Lewis the Vorticist and that, for Tarr at any rate, found one of its most insidious and deleterious expressions in the castrating power of Humour (pp. 57-58). Thus, when Lewis de scribed the Yard in which the first scene of his Vorticist drama "En 8[Wyndham Lewis], "Long live the Vortex," Blast 1, pp. 7-8. 9 Wyndham Lewis, "The Cubist Room," The Egoist, 1 January 1914, p. 9.</page><page sequence="5">514 Sheppard emy of the Stars" (Blast 1, pp. 51-85) is set as "Rough Eden of one soul, to whom another man, and not eve, would be mated" (p. 62), he was envisaging a universe from which Bertha's tearful sentimentality, "heavy motherhood" (p. 37), and bovine fleshliness have been ex cluded. Similarly, Tarr's fear that his ego will be swallowed up and his intellect blunted by the E[a]rth Mother Bertha?the alliteration and assonance are not accidental?is also the fear of getting into the kind of excoriating matrimonial situation described in Rebecca West's "In dissoluble Matrimony" (included by Lewis in Blast 1, pp. 98?117), where Evadne, a wilder, more daemonic, and more carnal version of Bertha, threatens George Silverton's pure, ethereal, a-fleshly soli tariness so drastically that he is almost destroyed by her and nearly murders her in retaliation. Then again, in Part I, Chapter 1 of Tarr, Alan Hobson, the conven tionalized English liberal, is subjected to a violent verbal assault that is directly reminiscent of the "Blasts" against the liberal English estab lishment to be found in Blast: The Cambridge set that you represent is[,] as observed in an average specimen, a cross between a Quaker, a Pederast, and a Chelsea artist.? Your Oxford brothers, dating from the Wilde decade, are a stronger body. The Chelsea artists are much less flimsy. The Quakers are power ful rascals. You represent, my Hobson, the dregs of Anglo-Saxon civiliza tion!?There is nothing softer on earth.?Your flabby potion is a mix ture of the lees of Liberalism, the poor froth blown off the decadent nineties, the wardrobe-leavings of a vulgar Bohemianism with its head quarters in Chelsea! You are concentrated, systematic slop.?There is nothing in the uni verse to be said for you.?Any efficient State would confiscate your property, burn your wardrobe, that old hat, and the rest, as infecte and insanitary, and prohibit you from propagating, (pp. 16-17) It should, however, be noted that where Blast's "Blasts" are tempered by a stylized wit that enjoys outrageous epigrams for their own sake and a series of "Blesses" that, to an extent at least, take back what was previously castigated, no such mitigating elements exist in Tarr. The same is also true of Tarr's attacks, in the same part of the novel, on English humor as a "soporific," "a system of deadening feeling," and "a first-rate means of evading reality" (p. 26). Although these utterances seem, at first sight, to be nothing more than an extension of the decla rations on the same subject to be found in Blast 1 (p. 17), actually, they are more sustained and more vitriolic?and unredeemed by an apolo gia for English humor such as can be found among the "Blesses" of Blast 1 (p. 26). All of which is to imply that if Tarr is, as so often as sumed, Lewis's mouthpiece, then, oddly enough, given the apparently</page><page sequence="6">Wyndham Lewis's Tarr 515 conservative form of the novel, he is more extreme, strident, and de structive than the polemicist who speaks from Blast's "radical" pages. On the other hand, if we jettison the above assumption?and, as we have seen, Lewis's feelings about Tarr were ambivalent from the start?then it may be, whether Lewis was conscious of doing so or not, that he presented Tarr in such extreme terms within a fictional con text in order to investigate and show up the shortcomings of his intel lectual position and personality. It is, of course, true that Tarr, on the surface, looks and sounds like one of Lewis's Vorticist ?bermenschen. One can, without difficulty, read Tarr, as Alistair Davies did, as a "Nietzschean novella, which presents the development of the central hero, Tarr, worked out by his superior vigour and vitality, as he breaks through and transcends the sick and destructive forces which surround him" (p. 109). Indeed, there is much, especially in the novel's early chapters, to suggest that Tarr is the embodiment of that mechanical Will which, according to Lewis's "Manifesto" (Blast 1, pp. 30?43), was determining the direction of the modern world, rearing up "steel trees where the green ones were lack ing" (p. 36). In those early chapters, Tarr is presented as solitary and aristocratic (p. 3), as a being who, like the men-machines of Vorticist graphics, is governed by the "cumbrous [mechanism] of the intellect" and "full of sinister piston-rods, organ-like shapes, heavy drills" (p. 4); as a cerebral, proto-Vorticist aesthetician who advocates the divorce of a severely ascetic art from the distasteful, organic matter of "immedi ate life" (p. 12) and who, accordingly, when eating becomes necessary, turns into an "automaton" or "devouring-machine" in order to con sume his food "mechanically" (p. 60). Inasmuch as he is an exponent of the ethic of brutality, Tarr can be regarded as a lesser Arghol, the "Promethean" hero of "Enemy of the Stars," who "is at odds with nature and the entire universe" (Materer, Wyndham Lewis, p. 49; cf. Wees, p. 184). Unlike Arghol, however, Tarr does not live in a timeless, static, and abstract "Yard" but in a changing, bustling, and very material city? that is neither a Vorticist-Expressionist machine-city, nor, except in the remarkable description of the Restaurant Lejeune (p. 87?Res taurant Vallet in the second edition), a Surrealist-Dadaist dream-city, but the stable and familiar Paris of nineteenth-century realist fiction (cf. Jameson, p. 105) in which the "cosmic" names of the caf?s (Pan th?on, Univers) and the streets (Boulevard du Paradis) seem strangely misplaced. Furthermore, unlike Arghol, Tarr does not live in a vac uum with only a deferential disciple for company but surrounded by a host of other characters on whom he tests out his proto-Vorticist</page><page sequence="7">516 Sheppard ideas on life and art and with whom he has, much against his inclina tion, to interact. That interaction has the initial effect of contextua lizing Tarr's theoretical pretensions, aspirations, and ideals in four complementary ways: they are measured against the ideas, argumen tational powers, and actions of the other characters; they are mea sured against Tarr's own reactions and emotional needs; they are measured against Tarr's ability to realize them and live them out; and they are measured against the attitudes and responses of the narrator to Tarr as a total character. Furthermore, that fourfold process, far from issuing in a straightforward celebration of Tarr's ideas and per sonality, tends to subvert those ideas and mock that personality. Once Lewis's early Vorticist ideal of a formal, aristocratic asceticism in both life and art is contextualized, its protagonist, Frederick (Tarr's first name), far from being The Great, "the first and last fully positive figure in Lewis's work" (Jameson, p. 78), emerges as a rather shallow personality whose pretensions are several sizes too large for him and who is, as such, satirized. If Lewis's final attitude to Tarr is confusing and inconsistent (Materer, Wyndham Lewis, pp. 63-64), it is because Lewis the narrator of Tarr deconstructs a set of ideas to which, in a more abstract and theoretical context, he was, as the avant-garde pro tagonist of Vorticism, prepared to assent. Uncomfortable though it may be for the reader accustomed to the consonances and regularities of classical aesthetics, Lewis, as an autobiographer, may have been consciously positive about this novel's hero,10 but as the narrator of that novel, he was distinctly negative toward him. In the very first part of Tarr, its hero is implicitly devalued by being set against three minor (English) characters. The first of these, Alan Hobson, is, as we have seen, little more than a butt for Tarr's theoreti cal venom?with the result that Tarr's invective appears disproportion ate to its object and Tarr comes across as an unpleasant intellectual bully. The second of them, Guy Butcher, is, on the surface at least, a Vorticist man-machine, being described in terms of "horizontal mas siveness" (p. 19) and as having "the air of an Iron-Age mechanic, born among beds of embryonic machinery" (p. 20). But Butcher's butch ness is phoney: he is, after all, a "guy," a sham G[audier]-B[rzeska], a softy who has a latent penchant for Rousseauesque Romanies (p. 27), talks winsomely of getting "spanked," looks "coaxingly" at Tarr (p. 27), has an "inclination to tears" (p. 58), and is described as "a bloody wastrel enamoured of gold and liberty ... a romantic, educat 10 See Letters, p. 76, and RA, p. 151, where Lewis describes Tarr as "sceptical and humourous, full of the English understatement of passion, and antagonism to animal mysticism."</page><page sequence="8">Wyndham Lewis's Tarr 517 ing his schoolboyish sense of adventure up to the pitch of drama" (p. 19). To an extent, then, Butcher parallels Tarr; and the narrator will, as we shall see, unmask Tarr in the same way as he unmasks Butcher, even going so far as to make the parallel explicit toward the end of the novel by calling Tarr "a butcher in his spare time" (p. 292). Consequently, it is no accident that Tarr should remember Butcher at one point only in the body of the novel?when, in the face of Bertha's "patient irony," he is discovering his own femininity (pp. 57 ? 58). Al though the third character of the set, the painter Lowndes, is another product of the well-heeled English establishment, he does at least paint, consistently and to some financial profit, Cubist pictures too (p. 30)?and that is more than Tarr manages. In other words, Lowndes, unpleasant though he is, sheds a negative light on Tarr the "boulevardier" who "drifts from caf? to caf? and from one actress and acquaintance to the next" (Materer, Wyndham Lewis, p. 57). By the end of Part I of the novel, then, Tarr's haughty ideas on art and life have undergone an initial subversion. When Tarr expounds those same views twice more, both times to Anastasya (pp. 223-30 and 288? 302), their credibility has, for a series of reasons that will be set out below, been undermined even more?and Anastasya gives them the coup de grace in two succinct ways. On the first occasion, she lays bare their latent, unadmitted Romanticism, and, unlike poor Hobson who has no opportunity to argue back, points out that they involve an es sential contradiction: the artist who hardens and blunts his sensibility by rejecting life in the way that Tarr demands inevitably becomes less of an artist (p. 229). On the second occasion, Anastasya does even better: she makes a nonsense of Tarr's asceticism by seducing him into consuming a large, erotic meal (which includes, for the first time for Tarr, live oysters [p. 293]) and then metamorphoses, before his eyes, into a statue reminiscent of one by Gaudier-Brzeska (p. 296) and com bining the massive intelligence (which Tarr purports to admire) with an immense animalism (which, in Tarr's view, is incompatible with such intelligence). Whether Tarr likes it or not, his interaction with Anastasya demonstrates the inadequacy and weakness of his cerebral aesthetic in particular and aristocratic detachment in general. Throughout the novel, Tarr's theoretical professions are shown to be at variance with his emotional needs and reactions. Pace Materer (Wyndham Lewis, p. 62), Lewis does "criticize the way his protagonist's intellect constricts his emotions"?albeit indirectly. One good ex ample of this occurs in Part I, Chapter 2: having allowed Tarr to in veigh against England's University of Humour, Lewis undermines this onslaught by letting Tarr laugh, somewhat drunkenly (pp. 26?</page><page sequence="9">518 Sheppard 27), as though his assertions were, in part at least, the product of a love of "fun and sport" combined with too much lager (p. 26) and thus not necessarily representative of his true feelings. The same is true of Tarr's talk of the "Abyss" (p. 8): as Materer himself sees (Wynd ham Lewis, pp. 57-58), that rhetoric is the product of a mind that has read too much Baudelaire in the comfortable context of "realist" Paris and not the image of a derelict soul. Once again, Lewis is implicitly showing how Tarr's intellectual pretensions constrict and contrast with his true emotions. But the two most striking examples of this dissociation involve Bertha and Anastasya. Although Tarr would have us believe that his relationship and break with Bertha are examples of the ethos of the cerebral ?bermensch who dares to impose his will ruthlessly upon an example of the inferior (female and fleshly) prin ciple, Tarr s narrator continually deflates this pretension. Early on, we hear that Tarr's relation with Bertha derives from shame and fear (pp. 13-14) rather than principle; and at those precise moments when Tarr ought, by his own standards, to act cruelly and decisively, he is plagued by and succumbs to banal moral scruples, guilt, softness, a desire to apologize, and an indecisiveness (pp. 20-21, 26, 35?36, 54-55, 60-64). Despite Tarr's dislike of Bertha's ordinariness and bourgeois sentimentality, he realizes that his attraction to her is still so powerful precisely because there is a bourgeoise beneath his skin too, whose presence he has been unwilling to admit (pp. 24 and 46?48) but whose cries for attention are all the more powerful for that. Lewis's hero is not only a soft-centered Sorbet?Bertha's pet name for him, derived from his ridiculous middle name of Sorbert (p. 37)?he is also a Tarr baby who simultaneously desires and fears Bertha's ma ternal largeness and who, in consequence, appears absurd and child ish when he tries, halfheartedly and semisuccessfully only, to cut, of his own accord, the emotional apron strings that bind him to her. Tarr, the would-be Blond Beast, would like to be brutal to Bertha (p. 63), but manages, when confronted with her, to act like a "domes ticated animal" only (p. 56) and ends up by marrying her for a com plex of improbable reasons. Tarr's theoretical ideas about art and life are similarly subverted by his relationship with the mysterious Ana stasya Vasek (see the discussion below; Materer, Wyndham Lewis, p. 62; Jameson, p. 88). Suffice it to say for the moment that despite Tarr's initial claim that "no man properly demarcated as I am will have much to do with [an exceptional woman]" (p. 24), Anastasya produces an earthquake in him that brings out his unconscious, instinctual side and forces him to learn to trust it more (see pp. 156?57 and 199). Despite his fear that she will destroy the artist in him, Anastasya</page><page sequence="10">Wyndham Lewis's Tarr 519 brings out an adult sensuality in Tarr that is more than crudely sexual, begins to free him from the confusion and dependence that mark his relationship with Bertha, and unsettles his previously clear-cut cate gories of male and female (pp. 310-11). Through Anastasya, Tarr begins to become a "new animal," a being who "will succeed the Su perman" (p. 304) that he had previously intended to be. Throughout Tarr, its hero's ideas are measured against his ability to realize them?and again, they are found inadequate. As Materer points out (Wyndham Lewis, p. 57), Tarr's life is that of a boulevardier rather than an artist, and on the one occasion that we hear anything about his work or see him in action (pp. 196?97), he does not pro duce an abstract or Modernist canvas, or, indeed, a painting that is rigorously controlled by hard-edged intellect, but a small-scale, repre sentational, "witty pastiche" that is vaguely classical in style ( "it might have been the art of some malicious Syrian poking fun at the great culture") and dominated by two heavy, sick colors ("a smoky bilious saffron" and "a pale transparent lead"). Although the painting's sig nificance is never even hinted at, the narrator does make it clear that Tarr's work?which then goes on for all of six days?was primarily a means of evading loneliness rather than an act of self-expression (p. 196). Just as Tarr cannot sustain his work?let alone a mode of work in conformity with his ascetic ideals?so too he is unable to sus tain the mask of haughty, aristocratic indifference that he tries to as sume in poor imitation of the dandies of two decades before. When, early on in the novel, he finds himself in Bertha's room, he is said to give "a hasty glance at his 'indifference' to see whether it were safe and sound" (p. 39). A mere ten pages later, that "mysterious and goguenard 'indifference'" is said to dwindle away at the onset of the "comic Armageddon" that takes place between him and Bertha?and Tarr never manages to don that mask again. Unable to sustain the role of indifferentist, Tarr is also unable to sustain the role of "the Panurgic-Pessimist, drunken with the laughing-gas of the Abyss" (p. 8), the Nietzschean hero whose "fr?hliche Wissenschaft" consists in his ability to laugh at the tragedy of the "ewige Wiederkunft des Gleichen." Tarr's laughter is relatively superficial: it is an intellectual pose overlaying fear, shyness, and sheer ordinariness that even Bertha can vaguely see through, dimly realizing that it conceals "un pleasant lights, belonging ... to other categories of matter" (p. 57). One could leave things there and, like Materer (Wyndham Lewis, p. 65), simply write Tarr off as a late-adolescent poseur, a "boorish young man," were it not that the formidable Anastasya compels him to admit the motivation behind his attitudes to life and art: both turn</page><page sequence="11">520 Sheppard out to be a flight from Death, an attempt to deny the fact of mortality and temporality (pp. 294-95). In other words, Tarr's heroic and artis tic pretensions are not those of the true Nietzschean ?bermensch who, as the Existentialists would say, has taken death unto himself and thereby transcended it, but those of the bourgeois who are trying to evade taking that difficult and hazardous step. Consequently, Tarr's projects as an aesthete and a person are bound to fail: reminders of mortality?"soft, quivering and quick flesh" (p. 295)?continually im pinge upon him, and a statue that according to his view of art should be "a dead thing" comes to life (pp. 295-96) and seduces him. Finally, Tarr s narrator continually makes it plain that he regards Tarr as a rather absurd young man, much as he might, in a different context, like to agree with his theoretical views. The entire first part of the novel is littered with indications that we should not take its main character too seriously. He is described as having a "gauche, Pu ritanical ritual of self" (p. 3); his machine-likeness is presented as lum beringly comic (p. 4); his" playfulness is denigrated as "unwieldy" (p. 5); the persona that he presents to the world is revealed to be "a grimacing, tumultuous mask for the face he had to cover" (p. 11); his pose of "indifference" is invariably enclosed in scare quotes and his aristocratic coldness is explained as shyness (p. 3)?that "morbid En glish shyness, that cannot tolerate passion and its nakedness" (p. 50)? with the result that by the end of Part I Tarr's hardness is seen to be an elaborate, but brittle, carapace that disguises weakness rather than the unremovable armor of a Nietzschean ?bermensch or Vorticist man machine. The novel's ending completes this process of subversion (see Pritchard, p. 35): a marriage from a confused and sentimental sense of duty, a domestic situation in which the husband keeps office hours, and the refusal of an exceptional relationship with Anastasya all be token Tarr's final, ludicrous failure of nerve. By the end of the novel, the Vorticist man-machine of the early chapters has degenerated into something approaching an absurdist anti-hero. Tarr is not Lewis's only early work where the hard-edged aristo cratism that formed one aspect of the Vorticist ethic and aesthetic comes in for critical scrutiny. Lewis's pictures "The Vorticist" (1912), "The Courtesan" (1912), "Workshop" (1914-15), and "The Crowd" (1914-15) all display "a steadfast refusal to be merely intoxicated by modern technological advance" (Cork, 1, 32) and a critical attitude toward the subjugation of man by machine-values (see Cork, 11, 342?49) that, to an extent at least, contradict one-half of the theoreti cal demands made in Blast 1. Similarly, Cantleman (the hero of "The War-Crowds, 1914" [part of an unfinished book written in July/Au</page><page sequence="12">Wyndham Lewis's Tarr 521 gust 1914 and first published in BB, pp. 78 ? 83] and "Cantleman's Spring-Mate")11 and Beresin (the hero of "The War Baby")12 both, like Tarr, attempt to deny life and Nature in favor of a hard-edged, Nietzschean aristocratism, and like Tarr both are subverted by the very powers they seek to deny. Beresin (who consciously aspires to being a Nietzschean aristocrat) turns out to be hopelessly bourgeois, is rejected by the real aristocrats, and produces a coarse, elephantine child. And Cantleman, seeking to impose his will on Nature by fight ing in the violent, masculine world of mechanized warfare, ends up, unwittingly, by furthering Nature's scheme of destruction and pro creation. Wherever one looks in Lewis's work from the years 1912 to 1919, one can find him expressing implicit reservations about the cult of machine-art, cerebral man, and the need for mechanization for which he, in his role as Vorticist polemicist, is so well known. Either, Lewis seems to say, the inhumanity of such ideals makes them un workable, or they need to be tempered by other qualities. In terms of Tarr, those "other qualities" are embodied in the Ger man Otto Kreisler?over whom critical opinion has been rather more united. Encouraged by Lewis's own, explicitly negative remarks to the effect that Kreisler "represents the melodramatic nihilism of the gen eration succeeding to the great era of philosophical pessimism" (RA, p. 149) and that Kreisler is "a man as good as dead" because he is a "machine" who has "accepted violence as the natural end to a violent Berserk nature" (RA, p. 151), critics have seen Kreisler as "the place of archaic regression" (Jameson, p. 103) and a "ridiculous, pathologi cal type" (Davies, p. 116). At the same time, however, Pritchard has argued that the "'villain' Otto Kreisler is an object of admiration, of wonder, rather than the butt of humor" (p. 69). It may be true that Kreisler stands "in the sharpest contrast" to Tarr (RA, p. 151); but as a narrator, Lewis is uncertain whether that contrast possibly reflects ad versely on Tarr to the extent that Kreisler stands for a vitality and dynamism that Tarr at first professes to despise and then acquires by default. Certainly, several critics have recognized that the relationship between Tarr and Kreisler goes beyond a simple opposition between positive and negative, with Pritchard noting the unmotivated, appar ently purposeless attraction that draws Tarr to Kreisler (p. 42) and Materer seeing Kreisler as "an aspect of Tarr" just as Hanp is of Ar ghol in "Enemy of the Stars" (Wyndham Lewis, p. 64). No critic has, however, seen that Kreisler, although no Vorticist artist, can be 11 First published in The Little Review, 4: vi (Oct. 1917), 8?14. 12First published in Art and Letters, 2:i (Winter 1918), 14-41.</page><page sequence="13">52 2 Sheppard viewed as a Vorticist type, the embodiment of that "animalism" and "crude energy" that are commended in Blast i alongside cerebrality and imposed form, and that the ambivalence of Tarr s narrator to ward Kreisler forms a counterpart to his ambivalence toward Tarr himself. In Kreisler, Tarr s narrator is implicitly testing out the viabil ity and implications of a life lived by raw energy, and while to an extent he admires its strength, in the end he deconstructs such an ideal, find ing it inherently self-destructive. That part of Wees's description of the Vortex that speaks of "whirl ing concentrations of energy . . . spinning in space" (p. 177) does exact justice to Kreisler's personality. On two occasions in Tarr, people (Bertha and Tarr) ask what Kreisler means (pp. 191 and 218)?and although no answer is forthcoming, Lewis himself must have known that the German word "Kreisel" means a spinning-top. Certainly, dur ing the ball in the Bonnington Club, Kreisler behaves accordingly with the unfortunate Mrs. Bevelage, spinning round with her "at breakneck speeds" and "with ever-increasing velocity" (p. 135) within the general vortex of the dance. Lewis offers two accounts of the origins of Kreisler's energy: on the one hand, it is shown to derive from Kreisler's instinctual uncon scious, and on the other hand, it is shown, less sustainedly, as an as pect of some metahuman force. Thus, in Part II, Chapter 8, we see him acting under the impulse of his blood (p. 108); words rush from his lips (pp. 108-9); and he lets "instinct guide his steps" (p. 109). In the following chapter, his eye seems to work quite independently of his consciousness (pp. 112-13) and his semblance of intentionality and purpose is shown to be a sham (p. 114). Similarly, the figure who rapes Bertha is described as "it" ("id"?) (p. 183) and the duel between Kreisler and Soltyk, like the rape of Bertha, is depicted as a series of lunatic accidents that occur for no good reason. In other words, Kreisler is, to an extent, presented as a puppet of his own irrationality. At another level, however, Tarrs narrator hints that Kreisler's irra tionality goes beyond individual pathology, being connected with the "archaic" (p. 65), the atavistic (p. 285), the forces of reproduction (p. 85), and Nature as a whole (pp. 260-61). But even as Lewis's narrator does this, and despite the suggestion that when Kreisler rapes Bertha he is avenging the affront to wild Nature represented by Bertha's damp romanticism, any potential celebration of Kreisler's irrationality is systematically subverted. When Kreisler lets instinct guide his steps, we are immediately told that this causes him to take "the wrong turning" (p. 109); his atavism is described as "clumsy and degenerate" (p. 285); his archaicness is asso</page><page sequence="14">Wyndham Lewis 5 Tarr 523 dated with an imagery of death (p. 65); his passion for Anastasya is linked, right from his first meeting with her, with the inevitability of a duel and his death (p. 94); and his domination by the unconscious, which, we are told, drew him back into the "vortex," is explicitly de scribed as "weakness" (p. 118). Throughout Tarr, Kreisler and Soltyk (who are said to resemble one another [p. 80]) are presented with extreme distaste?as jokes (p. 238) and absurd little men (pp. 267 ? 68). Kreisler's loneliness is pathetic, not heroic (p. 83); his anger is described as petty, clownlike, and juvenile (p. 234); his sexuality is sor did and violent (pp. 179-84); and his image of himself at the Bon nington Club as a "Berserker warrior, ravening and irresistible" (p. 146) is debunked as a thin, adolescent fantasy, masking petty emo tions like envy, pique, and a gauche shyness. Kreisler cites Nietzsche's Zarathustra ("Von alten und jungen Weiblein") to the effect that when one visits women, one should not forget one's whip (p. 216); and he is said to view women as a "vast dumping-ground for sorrow and afflic tion?a world-dimensioned pawnshop, in which you could deposit not your dress-suit or garments, but yourself, temporarily, in ex change for the gold of the human heart" (p. 93). Nevertheless, this would-be ?bermensch is no match for Anastasya: having no center to his personality and moving from role to role in a state of protean confusion, it is quite simple for Anastasya to turn him into a dog within a few minutes of meeting him (pp. 96?97). Throughout Tarr, Lewis naturalizes Kreisler: he shows up the smallness, absurdity, and all-too-humanness of his motives and overlays the whole with intima tions that Kreisler's energy is burning itself out?that he is, appear ances to the contrary, nothing more than a "large rusty machine of a man" (p. 77). Like Tarr, Kreisler is not unique in Lewis's early work, being the most spectacular of a ten-year line of "militantly vitalist" characters (RA, p. 117), most of whom finally found their way into Lewis's Wild Body collection of 1927 and whom Lewis later described as "primitive creatures, immersed in life, as much as birds, or big, obsessed, sun drunk insects" (RA, p. 117). Where, however, Lewis could celebrate the heroes of his early stories "in quivering romantic tones and the vocabulary of a somewhat fuliginous mysticism,"13 Kreisler was some one who had to be "got rid of" (cf. Lewis's "Prologue" to the first edition of Tarr [p. iv]); where, in the early stories, "the best mo ments . . . are crucial ones in which one or more wild bodies are caught up in the rhythm of a dance and thereby fulfilled" (Pritchard, 13 Bernard Lafourcade, "The Taming of the Wild Body," in Meyers, p. 77.</page><page sequence="15">524 Sheppard pp. 32-33), those same rhythms are, by the time of Tarr, associated with "the tragic corpse of life"14?the inherent self-destructiveness of unfettered energy. Behind Lewis's deconstruction of Tarr and Kreisler and, implicitly, of the two Vorticist polarities as these are presented in Blast 1, lay the war. Lewis wrote Tarr before he was called up and it is probably mis placed to suggest, as Jameson does, that Tarr is a direct allegory of the nationalities involved in the war. Nevertheless, Lewis's escalating criti cism of his two main characters involves a revulsion from machine intelligence split off from feeling and from bestial energy split off from reason, and reflects a growing, if as yet unfocused, sense that both were to be found in the mechanized slaughter and brutality of modern warfare. In retrospect, Lewis admitted that it took him time to understand and develop a moral attitude toward the war (BB, p. 85), but after Passchendaele (Summer 1917) (WLtA, p. 78), Lewis increasingly moved to a humanist naturalism in art (see Cork, 11, 532?34; Materer, Vortex, p. 118), having come to associate the Flan ders battlefields both with Vorticist abstraction (and thus, presumably, with the ideas expressed by Tarr) (RA, p. 128) and with the thanatic vitalism embodied in the violence of Kreisler.15 As we have seen, however, Blast 2 (Summer 1915) represents a shift in Lewis's Vorticist theory: if both Vorticist extremes, asserted inde pendently, were self-defeating or self-destructive, was a balanced syn thesis possible? Was it possible to restrain "primordial force" by the "shaping power of art"? Could the spinning Vortex be given an "un shakeable axis"? Were "the most extreme and inhuman possibilities" reconcilable with "whirling concentrations of energy" (Wees, p. 177)? Did the whirlpool have "a great silent place where all the energy is concentrated" (Cork, 1, 254)? Theoretically, Blast 2 affirms the possi bility of such fusions and Tarr, through the person of Anastasya (whose positive significance has been consistently underestimated by the critics?partly, I suspect, because they have been blinded by their awareness of Lewis's well-known misogyny), suggests the same possi bility. To put it briefly, Anastasya (Greek anastasis 'resurrection') em bodies that synthetic "third term" that Jameson misses from Tarr (pp. 98-99) and whose possibility he in principle denies (p. 102). Anastasya is the synthesis of Apollonian intelligence and Dionysiac energy who, by embodying the best and avoiding the worst in the extremes represented by Tarr and Kreisler, offers a means of resolv 14Wyndham Lewis, "Inferior Religions," The Little Review, 4:v (Sept. 1917), 6. 15Cf. "Inferior Religions" (footnote 14), which was first published in September i9!7</page><page sequence="16">Wyndham Lewis 's Tarr 525 ing the novel's polarities. Having said that, it needs to be stressed that Anastasya's actantial function in Tarr is never "flagged" in the obvious and somewhat artificial way that Tarr's and Kreisler's are. Indeed, she is so little a constructed character, so unschematized, and so elusively fluid, that Lewis himself seems unaware of her significance. Certainly, if he was, he never foregrounded that awareness. A close reading of Tarr rapidly reveals that Anastasya is not a "char acter" in the realistic sense at all, but a paradoxical being who is very similar to those magical figures who populate the Dada poetry of the years around the Great War.16 Although a highly intelligent young woman who can outargue Tarr with ease, Anastasya is consistently associated with the basic appetites and with elemental forces?eating, for example, exotic meals with and stimulating erotic energies in both Tarr and Kreisler. Furthermore, Anastasya is endowed with magical properties. She changes her appearance according to the person she is with; on one occasion she carries a bag "which you expected to contain herbs and trinkets, paraphernalia of the witch" (p. 90); she is associated with "a travelling circus of tricks and wonders, beauty shows and monstrosities" (p. 91); she comes and goes with super natural speed (disappearing, for example, with extreme rapidity after her first encounter with Kreisler, then reappearing as if to taunt him [p. 98] and manifesting herself unexpectedly and oxymoronically to Tarr as "an apparition of solid white" [p. 302] after he is convinced that she has stood him up); she wears voluminous, exotic, Oriental clothes (p. 90) whose "florid redundancies" (p. 209) tantalizingly con ceal as much as they reveal; and she provokes crises such as the duel. But, at the same time, she is more than a destructive temptress, having the ability?by virtue of her personal wizardry and intellectual power?to expose pretensions and bring out aspects of other people of which they are either unaware or ashamed. Thus, when she first meets Kreisler in the Restaurant Lejeune, she appears by association as an aspect of the surreal, daemonic metamor phoses of that cavernous place and promptly presents him with a dis torting mirror image of his own irrationality. To begin with, she is linked in his mind with "lobster salad" (p. 89) as though she were part of a classic postprandial nightmare; she immediately causes him to describe a formal taxonomy?the menu?in terms that reveal his own essential irrationality ("Each list is like an oriental dance [dervish per formance in the second edition (p. 91)]. It gets wilder as it goes along" 16 See Richard W. Sheppard, "Tricksters, Carnival and the Magical Figures of Dada Poetry," Forum for Modern Language Studies, 19 : ii (Apr. 1983), 116-25.</page><page sequence="17">526 Sheppard [p. 90]); she makes him feel first like "a strange loafer"?which he is?(p. 91) and then like a dog (pp. 95-97); she unsettles him in the way that he has been wont to unsettle women (p. 94); she evokes a premonition of his duel and death (p. 94) and then, having reduced him to a state of panic (p. 95), vanishes. Furthermore, it is Anastasya who discovers Bertha kissing Kreisler in the street and, in so doing, causes Bertha to realize how ordinary and ashamed of her own sexu ality she is (p. 178). When Bertha tries to excuse herself, Anastasya curls her lip, provides a clear, accurate, and highly intelligent inter pretation of "the confused material of this affair" and compels Bertha to see "clearly the essence of her action" (p. 179). Similarly, on the two occasions when Anastasya is with Tarr toward the end of the novel, she repeats her earlier performance with Kreisler and confronts Tarr with a series of grotesque images of him self. On the first of these occasions, she forces Tarr to see that his four years in Paris have been wasted and idle (pp. 224-25); that he him self, for all his intellectual pretensions, lacks seriousness (p. 225); and that his hard-boiled exterior conceals a romanticism and a shyness (pp. 228?30). And on the second of these two occasions, Anastasya wears clothing that parodies the gap in Tarr's own nature between his pretensions and reality (a heavy coat, "like a Tintoretto dress," con cealing "a very plain dark blouse and skirt, like a working girl" and a pair of cheap stockings [p. 289]). She flaunts her physical attributes, inflames his latent sexuality, inveigles him into eating a live oyster (p. 293), turns into a primitive Gaudier-Brzeska statue (p. 296), forces the controlled, intellectual Tarr to drink a toast to "Waste" (p. 299), parodies his earlier and by-now-forgotten classicism by pretending to be a Greek statue (p. 303), seduces him, and, in so doing, makes him see that he is not good enough for her (pp. 310-11). Finally, she pro pels him into an absurd but new sense of responsibility so that he marries Bertha (with whom he now feels more on a level [p. 311]). In short, the intelligent, daemonic Anastasya hastens Kreisler's self destruction; impels the sentimental Bertha toward more genuine feel ings; and evokes the beginnings of a maturity and an honesty in the irresponsible and juvenile Tarr. As such, Anastasya is the agent of a hidden power that is never named or brought into clear focus in the novel, that synthesizes Apollonian and Dionysiac qualities, and whose nature is to cause crisis, compel truth, and impel growth. Conse quently, Anastasya both exemplifies and transcends Lewis's theoreti cal demand for synthesis, indicating that by the time Lewis completed Tarr he had, whether he was aware of it or not, gone beyond the stark, polar categories of early Vorticism. Which perhaps explains why the</page><page sequence="18">Wyndham Lewis's Tarr 527 word "vortex" occurs only once in Tarr?not as a metaphor to de scribe any one character or even the city context as a whole but as an ironic description of the absurd and hopelessly bourgeois Li[e]pmann circle (p. 118). It is as though Lewis the narrator were implicitly dis carding a category to which, only slightly earlier, he had, as a polemi cist, been committed?handing it over, like an item of cast-off cloth ing, for the pseudo-Bohemians to wear. The relationship between the first and second editions is complex; it is far too simplistic to say, as does Pritchard, the only critic to at tempt comparison, that the second edition is "superior" because it is "less abrupt and its rhythm more satisfying," and that in it Lewis is "both confident about what his prose is doing and at ease with his relations with the reader" (pp. 29?30). Although it would go beyond the scope of this essay to undertake a detailed comparison of the two book versions of Tarr, a brief description of the salient differences between them is of relevance inasmuch as it strengthens the case for reading Tarr as a novel that simultaneously embodies and subverts the Vorticist ideals. Overall, the textual differences between the two nov els point to three shifts in Lewis's attitudes. First, by 1928 Lewis had become more conscious of the strength of the irrational powers in human nature and Nature at large; second, by 1928 Lewis had also become more concerned as a narrator to hold these powers in check by various strategies of naturalization, humanization, and explication; and third, by 1928 Tarr s narrator had become even more critical of the extremes that are embodied in Tarr, Kreisler, and their lesser counterparts. The first tendency is evident, for example, in the more intense and extensive violence of the rape scene (1928, pp. 183?84); in the lengthier descriptions of the absurd irrationality of the Polish/Slavonic contingent (1928, pp. 255?61), Anastasya's eroticism, and Tarr's bur geoning sensuality (1928, pp. 294?310); in the alteration of such nar ratorial comment as "When the scientist's nature, with immense fugue, has induced a man to marry some handsome young lady" (1918, pp. 260-61) into "Nature, with immense fugue, had pushed Kreisler to a certain course" (1928, pp. 265?66); in the description, albeit indi rect and ironical, of Kreisler as "a vast Magog of Carnival, an ante diluvian puppet of fecundity" (1928, p. 86; cf. 1918, p. 85, from which such attributions are absent); in Tarr's explicitly stated inability to cope with Nature (the phrase "The Spring for him was nameless" [1928, p. 35] is missing from the first edition [p. 34]); and in the fre quent inversion of syntax whereby the subject is transferred from the stressed and more active position at the beginning of a sentence to a</page><page sequence="19">528 Sheppard less dominant position in its middle (e.g., "She struggled for a moment up from the obstinate dream" [1918, pp. 174-75] becomes "For a moment she struggled up from the obstinate dream" [1928, p. 177]). Having arrived, however, at a greater awareness of the daemonic aspects of experience, the narrator of the second edition is also com pelled to exercise more control over them. Consequently, he gener ates a greater distance from his characters by inserting such phrases as: "Now he realized that . . ." and "Tarr reflected. . . ," and by break ing up Tarr's long, set-piece speeches either by means of such inser tions as "He gazed at an imaginary Bertha without a spark of humour" (1928, p. 28; cf. 1918, p. 27) or by means of a greater amount of dialogue (cf. Part VII, Chapter 2). Similarly, the narrator of the second edition tempers the power of the irrational by several means. He suggests a greater level of explicability by replacing a large number of full stops dividing two single-clause (and therefore frag mented) sentences with colons, thus implying a greater level of logical or causal relationship between the units; he allows his characters to be more conscious of and to reflect more on events and feelings, thus creating the illusion that they have a greater ability to understand and control these (e.g., at the end of Part II, Chapter 9, the narrator stresses Tarr's "chilly clearness" of consciousness and ability to make up his mind [1928, p. 118; cf. 1918, pp. 117-18]). Finally, the nar rator of the later version is more prepared to reduce contexts, events, and mental processes to anthropomorphic terms. Paris is described as "the most human city we had" (1928, p. 228) instead of "like a patent food" (1918, p. 224); it is the "members of the Bonnington Club" who are said to change and metamorphose themselves (1928, p. 140) and not the impersonal "club" that is said to change and metamorphose itself (1918, p. 133); and in general, the major characters, in being allowed more inner life, are judged less harshly and permitted more of the softer emotions. From the point of view of Tarr s relationship with Vorticism, the overall effect of these two fundamental narrative shifts is to subvert the extremes represented by Tarr and Kreisler even more radically than was the case in the first edition. Tarr's machine-man personality is deflated as "portentous" (1928, p. 4) rather than "ominous" (1918, p. 4); his inconsistent considerateness vis-?-vis Bertha is given more emphasis by the insertion of the sentence "But Bertha, though unreal, was undeniably a good kind fairy and her feelings must be taken into consideration" (1928, p. 43). Tarr explicitly admits that "our core is soft, because of course our skin is so tough" (1928, p. 27), and, by the same token, Butcher, Tarr's alter ego, is no longer unmasked as "a</page><page sequence="20">Wyndham Lewis 's Tarr 529 bloody wastrel" (1918, p. 19) but described as "the sweetest old kitten, the sham tough guy in excelsis" (1928, p. 19). The suggestion that Tarr plays the baby to Bertha's Earth Mother is made more explicit by the insertion of "Another baby could not be long delayed. To look at a man should be almost enough to effect it" (1928, p. 39). Tarr, confess ing to Bertha in Part I, Chapter 4, becomes much more sententious and sentimental in the later edition. In Part IV, Chapter 3, Tarr's cere bral aloofness is presented, from Bertha's point of view at least, as schoolboyish (1928, p. 161; cf. 1918, p. 157, from which such a sug gestion is absent); and under the impact of Eros and alcohol, Tarr's concern with matters aesthetic is, in the later edition, said explicitly to be put to flight (p. 306). Analogously, Soltyk's similarity to Kreisler and the unpleasantness of both are given more emphasis in the second edition (pp. 81?82). A passage has been added to that same edition (pp. 106-7)tnat stresses the extent to which Kreisler is simply the passive agent of impersonal forces, a ludicrous assemblage of fragmented physical attributes. Two pages later we hear?and it is not clear whether this is the narrator speaking or Kreisler reflecting to himself?"He was a thing, scarcely any longer a Mensch" (p. 112); and the second edition includes seven pages (pp. 126-33) missing from the first edition in which Kreisler, far from appearing a Byronic, nihilistic outsider, is shown to be thor oughly familiar with and prepared to be at home in phony, bourgeois bohemian circles and in which he is declared by the narrator to be a "perfect snob" whose apparently revolutionary nature is based on re sentment and vengefulness (1928, p. 133). Furthermore, later on in the same episode, Kreisler's movements on the dance floor are ridiculed by being described as "chicken-like" (1928, p. 149) and his aggression in the same scene is shown to be deliberate rather than instinctual or demonic (1928, p. 150; cf. 1918, pp. 143 and 144, from which such insinuations are absent). Throughout the later edition, both Tarr and Kreisler are made sig nificantly more absurd than is the case in the first edition so that it becomes almost impossible to take them seriously. The antihumanism of Vorticism, having been put to the test in the first edition of Tarr and found wanting, has turned into the ironic humanism of the second edition ofthat novel, which, while understanding the relativity and fra gility of all things human, is equally aware of the perils of extreme or overschematic responses to that condition. Oddly enough, however, Lewis's presentation of Anastasya has remained largely unchanged: he has not humanized her to any marked extent, but neither has he made what she represents more prominent or more explicit. By 1928</page><page sequence="21">53? Sheppard Lewis may have recognized even more clearly the danger of the ex tremes embodied in Tarr and Kreisler; but, instead of attempting to deal with those extremes by developing the principle of magical syn thesis that is embodied in Anastasya, he elected to do so by increased narrative distance on the one hand and intensified satirical humour on the other. Not only, therefore, was he repudiating even more firmly the antihumanist principles that he had asserted so vigorously in his role as a Vorticist polemicist, he was also, implicitly, refusing to investigate the metahumanist possibilities implicit in the figure of Anastasya who, as a result, remains an "anomalous figure" in Lewis's work (Jameson, p. 146).</page></plain_text>
