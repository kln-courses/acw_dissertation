<plain_text><page sequence="1">Approaches to a Philosophical Biology. MARJORIE GRENE. New York: Basic Books, 1968. Pp. vii, 295. Professor Grene's examination of the works of five European etholo- gist-biologists (Portmann, Plessner, Buytendijk,. Straus, and Goldstein) seeks to demonstrate how "existential insight may become the founda- tion of empirical study" (here, the study of living nature). The empirical essentialism which emerges however, falls somewhere between a descrip- tive behaviorism which restricts itself to the "perceptible surface of things," and eschews all explanation whether mechanistic or teleological; and an implicit appeal to teleological explanatory models and concepts which are the evident products of our existential understanding of other living beings. (A related problem is a methodological one: What is the nature of that act of comprehension whereby we allegedly recognize other living beings?). For the most part Grene adopts a phenomenological stance, i.e., she adheres to the descriptive method and insists on the primacy of a world of experience antecedent to the reductivist schemas of science. Her authors, however, are not searching for what makes an experience of biological phenomena possible, but for empirically determined proper- ties of the type discoverable by observation, for actualities, not ideal entities grasped in consciousness by a special kind of intuition. Thus Plessner's "organic modals" are empirically ascertained qualities which make us call an object alive; and his method involves a "seeing of the pattern in the facts," "the discovery of norms based on actual cases," and "the perception of the essence in the existence." But her charac- terization both of the "existential knowing" which issues in empirical norms, and that of the norms themselves, are at odds with her behav- iorism, and threaten to reinstate the dualism she wishes to avoid. Thus the inner states of other living beings are sometimes said to be "revealed" by their external form, while elsewhere our experience of organisms as "living centers" of action and perception is said "to come from our own experience of our inner life." We must square these references to the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 609 unobservable mental states or processes of other living beings which seem to be based on analogical and other forms of inference, with the view she also holds that the experience of other living beings is some- times based on an unmediated "encounter" or an empathic putting of oneself in the place of the other. Thus the "essential properties of all biological phenomena ... (are) directly present to us in our immediate awareness of living things,." are the objects of an "intuitive perception" or of a "richer immediate sense of perception." It is difficult to see how we are to cash these and like results such as: "behavior carries its meaning on its face," or "expressive movements have significance within themselves," or again, life possesses a certain "irregular regularity." Despite the ambiguity of the above statements, it is clear that Grene is determined to restrict her observations to the "effective working out- side" of the organism, and to avoid reference to the "inside" whether this be construed in terms of unobservable mental causes or physical microstructures. But here again, despite her disclaimer that "norms are prior to goals," her norms are in effect directive rather than descriptive, and the telic implications of her descriptions are continually surfacing. Thus on the one hand she explicitly rejects teleological explanation be- cause it is anthropomorphic; for it "reads into animal life or nature as a whole the concept of plan or purpose as we find it in our subjective lives," or threatens to revive the entelechies or life-forces of vitalism. (In her earlier book, The Knower and the Known, however, not only are telic phenomena "inescapable," but "Nature ... is in fact to! be ranked among the causes that act for the sake of something," and teleology has "ontological import.") On the other hand, Buytendijk's actions of the organism are patently structured with respect to "natural goals," Portmann's "addressed properties" are "directed to" other organisms, Plessner's organic medals such as "positionality" are described as in- volving a "realization" or "perfection of type" reminiscent of Aristotle's final causes, and Goldstein's "preferred behavior" expresses the "nature" of the organism and is a "directed effort" which seeks "maximal achieve- ment." It seems clear that Grene's "norm" refers to actions or processes which possess what Peters has called an "omnibus end-state," i.e., self- actualization or realization. But as the same writer has pointed out, if such an end is stated with sufficient generality to avoid the difficulties involved in specifying what sort of self is to realized, it is innocent of explanatory power; and where it is explanatory, it must invoke estimates by the organism of things worthwhile or desirable, and so is no longer purely descriptive in Grene's sense. There is a certain disarray too in the elaboration of the above concepts which is due not to a failure of perceptual awareness or "understanding," but to a failure of conceptual</page><page sequence="3">610 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH analysis. Thus Grene frequently suggests that there are deductive rela- tions between the various concepts which designate the irreducible properties of life, while on other occasions, we have "variants" of a single concept, or looser relations between properties. Despite these difficulties we can applaud the author's effort to in- troduce a unitary concept of both animal and human life which seeks to overcome the contrast between "inner" and "outer" events. Such a dichotomy, according to Grene, is based on a dualistic epistemology, ultimately responsible for the falsification of our experience of the world, and for "the substitution of the nonliving for the living." Scien- tific explanation in terms of physiochemical processes or other micro- structures is, she believes, based on such an epistemological dualism, and paradoxically implies that what we perceive are either subjective appearances or light waves. (The mentalism which Grene unsuccessfully tries to avoid, however, does not logically entail dualism as she seems to think, for we can ascribe both mental and behavioral predicates to the same observable entity.) If we consider our experience as it is, it is clear that we do not experience the stimuli or physiochemical processes of molar and molecular behaviorism. These are of an abstract and derivative nature, involving an articulation of a more primordial expe- rience of the world, and the assumptions underlying such reductive explanations can distort the very phenomena we are trying to investi- gate. What Grene calls for, then, is a redescription of phenomenal realities, essential to the sounder metaphysics and epistemology on which science itself should be based. ROBERT ROSTHAL. UNIV.
