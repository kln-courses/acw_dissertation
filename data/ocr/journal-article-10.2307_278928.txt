<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORTS TWO MIDDLE PRECLASSIC ENGRAVED MONUMENTS AT TZUTZUCULI ON THE CHIAPAS COAST OF MEXICO ANDREW J. MCDONALD Excavations by the BYU-New World Archaeological Foundation at the site of Tzutzuculi on the Chiapas coast of Mexico, revealed two engraved monuments flanking a central stairway of a late Middle Preclassic period pyramidal platform. This report focuses on these two monuments, discussing their context, dating, and style. The context at its most general level involves the corresponding platform complex, which in its layout has a general resemblance to the Olmec site of La Venta. As for the monuments-one a were-jaguar representation, the other a serpent-dragon figure-they too, in their style, are identified as being Olmec. Moreover, their combined imagery, possibly expressing a dualistic viewpoint, is consistent with other Olmec iconographic examples. At Tzutzuculi, however, this imagery has for the first time in Olmec form been found in direct association with platform building. In 1958, while reconnoitering the northwest sector of the Chiapas coast for the BYU-New World Archaeological Foundation, Carlos Navarrete (Navarrete 1959:6) came across a group of some 25 earthen platforms con- centrated in an area of about 35 ha at the southeastern edge of the town of Tonala. As he found them, they were well rounded from erosion and largely unrecognized in an area of milpas and grazing land atop a plateau separated from Tonala by the Zanatenco River. The Zanatenco is a major river of the north- western part of the Chiapas coast and one of the few in the area regularly lasting through a pronounced dry season. Cutting through the site is a small intermittent stream, the Tzu- tzuculi, whose name-of uncertain derivation- was given the site. Each of the various structures at Tzutzuculi (Fig. 1) is aligned the same, with sides running N-380-E and at right angles to this, S-520-E.

Each group in- cludes among its principal features a pyramidal platform and a rectangular mound enclosure; but the second also has an elongated platform approximately 100 m in length situated trans- versally along the centerline between the other two structures. That this latter group of struc- tures was a separate platform complex is indicated by its similarity, in layout and general orientation, to the core complexes of the earliest platform precincts (originating during the latter part of the Middle Preclassic and contemporaneous with the Tzutzuculi example) in the nearby Central Depression area of Chiapas just across the Sierra Madre mountain range. These were at Vistahermosa, Mirador, Ocozocoautla, and Chiapa de Corzo in the western part; Acapulco in the intermediate Angostura region; and to the east at La Libertad (McDonald 1974). Also of note at Tzutzuculi is the alignment of the N-380-E orientation toward Tres Picos, a prominent tridentate peak of the Sierra Madre mountain range. Comparisons of sherds from a surface collec- tion by Navarrete at Tzutzuculi with establish- ed ceramic sequences from other areas in- dicated that the period of platform construction and upkeep was lmited to the Middle and Late Preclassic (Navarrete 1959:6)- an assessment that was later proven correct (McDonald 1971). Thus, Tzutzuculi was found to be an early occupation in association with a well-developed platform complex in a region that is little known archaeologically but presumably important as part of a natural passageway connecting the southern Gulf coast region to the northwest with Central America on the east. It was not until 1971, however, that the BYU-New World Archaeological Foundation resumed work at the site. This time, under the direction of Gareth W. Lowe, the Foundation's director, and with myself as chief assistant., excavations were carried out during February and March. During the project, we found two engraved monuments flanking the base of a 4 m wide central stairway of the pyramidal struc- ture (designated Mound 4) in association with the cornplex having the N-380-E centerline (Fig. 2). This report is intended primarily to present the context, dating, and style of the monu- ments. Mound 4, which measures 8 m in height, 42 m along the N-380-E axis, and 62 m the other way, is an unusually interesting structure in that, like Pyramid C of La Venta, it is underlain by a broad artificial platform. Its rounded corners are also reminiscent of the circular Pyramid C. In fact, the entire complex layout conforming to the N-38?-E alignment-- and including an empty stone slab "cist'-- suggests the La Venta center complexes A and C. Mound 4 masonry was of favorably shaped natural stones embedded in a clay matrix superficially fired. The interior was of puddled adobe. Pottery of the phase during which the engraved monuments were erected corresponds to that of the late Middle Preclassic Escalera phase of Chiapa de Corzo, which is dated by radiocarbon (without correction) from 550 to 450 B.C. Two radiocarbon dates from charcoal in Mound 4 fill, one from a sample just behind one of the monuments, the other from a sample under the steps, are, respectively, 2,290?95 years: 340 B.C. (Lab #1-5996), and 2,495?90 years: 545 B.C. (Lab #1-5997). Taking into consideration the Bristlecone pine factor (Damon, Ferguson, Long, and Wallick 1974:350-65), these dates, in the same order, become 2,360+140 years: 410 B.C., and 2,610?140 years: 660 B.C. Averaging these dates would not be useful since there is only about a 20% probability that the dates pertain to a single event or even a short sequence of events spanning several years (Long and Rip- peteau 1974:211). More likely the dates would correspond to different, quite widely separated phases of construction, in which case the later date of 2,360?140 years: 410 B.C. would seem, because of its context, to come closest to dating the monuments. But then also, there is no assurance, given the nature of fill material, that the dates are contemporary with the construction. While the construction in each case could not have occurred prior to the conversion of the dated carbon samples to charcoal, it could have come anytime afterwards. Considering the ceramic evidence, however, an intervening period of any length seems unlikely. The monument on the right of the stairway (the reader's right) has been designated Monu-</page><page sequence="3">562 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY A I&amp;A jk, A I JGA V-01 OR, t, ment 1 (Fig. 3); the one on the left, Monument 2 (Fig. 4). Both are of an igneous rock which occurs in outcrops around Tzutzuculi. This and their size (Monument 1 measuring in meters 1.5 X 1 X .4; Monument 2, 1.1 X .7 X .5) in- dicate that they were locally produced. Today they are on exhibit in the patio of the regional museum in Tona a. The Monument 1 engraving, measuring .75 m vertically and .65 m across, depicts a werejaguar clearly in the Olmec style known from numerous similar representations from the Olmec heartland in the southern Gulf coast area. Typical Olmec depictions of the were- jaguar show a stylized countenance confected from anthropomorphic, feline, and ophidian attributes. The head is characteristically cleft, and the eyebrows which consist of upward projecting elements in series of twos or fours are described as "flaming" and "serrated." Under the eyes and a broad, snout-like nose is a typically down-turned mouth. The configura- tion of this mouth is reminiscent of that of a snarling jaguar and a crying child. Prominent buccal elemnents are a central septum similar to that of a toothless child, fangs, and occasionally a bifurcate tongue. Attributes of Monument 1 conform closely to the style ascribed to the Olmec. The mouth is appropriately shaped and endowed, an ex- cised portion between the eyes marks the usual cleavage, and vertical grooves above the eyes may be the eyebrow markings. Also of note is the configuration above the head, comprising a three-tiered protuberance with a U-element right side up in the upper tier and possibly another, inverted, in the bottom tier. The engraving of Monument 2, covering most of the monument's face, depicts a stylized representation of what appears to be a serpent's head in profile. Front and back, inward curving volutes and a U-element at the back of the head are distinctive attributes. These attributes, especially the volutes fore and aft, are in various forms prominent char-</page><page sequence="4">R EPO RTS56 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. .. . .... 8I ,. .4'3I do ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ | ! __t |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A .._~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *_~~~~~~~~~A acteristics of other early serpent depictions in what Lowe (1971:222) has called the "Greater Isthmus Area." This is the area eastward of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec roughly to a borderline extending southward from the western edge of the Yucatain Peninsula: an area bridging the western and eastern sectors of the cultural zone knowni as Mesoamerica. More specifically, however, these early serpent depictions are distributed along a natural passageway/travel route (Navarrete 1973) crossing thie Greater Isthmus Area. This is the route extending southeastward from the southiern Gulf coast region across western Chiapas to the coastal corridor and from there eastward into Central America. There is, start- ing in the southern Gulf coast region, the roughly contemporaneous, Middle Preclassic serpent representation on Monument 19 at La Venta (Fig. 5). In this case the frontal volute projects backward from over the nose, meeting a protuberance above the eye approximately at midpoint, while the back volute extends up- ward and frontward from above the eye.</page><page sequence="5">564 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Vl42No4197 At Izapa, at the other end of the coastal corridor from Tzutzuculi, where there are numerous serpent representations dating to the Late Preclassic, one in particular (Fig. 6) is notable for its reseinblance to the Monument 19 serpent. Again, as with Monument 19, both volutes are oriented around the eyebrow area Finally, in highland Guatemala at Kaminaljuyu there is a Late Preclassic serpent representation (Fig. 7) paralleling the Tzu- tzuculi examnple in the placement of the back U-motif as well as with regard to the front and back volutes. In the La Venta, Izapa, and Kaminaljcuyu exainples the back volute appears to be an extension of the eyebrow. Also, the front volutes in the La Venta and Izapa cases are directly connected to the eyebrow area. Given these associations, the eyebrow design of a Late Preclassic serpent representation from the Frailesca region in Chiapas (Fig. 8) is con- ceivably another way of depicting the Tzutzuculi volute arrangement.

The Monument 1 and 2 engravings, then, are further evidence of the Olmec character-after the manner of La Venta-of the N-38?-E oriented platform complex at Tzutzuculi. An- other consideration is Tzutzuculi's strategic location overseeing the upper end of the coastal corridor next to the La Sepultura pass, the best of only a few passageways leading inland over the Sierra Madre. An Olmec redoubt at Tzutzuculi would have been important for any Olmec thoroughfare between the southern Gulf coast area and Central America. If we take a broader look at Olmec iconography in search of parallels to Monu- ments 1 and 2, a closely related example appears in the scepter-like artifact found near Sanchez Magallanes, Tabasco (Navarrete 1971: 70-75) (Fig. 9). Like Monuments 1 and 2, the "scepter" depicts a serpent's head in profile opposite a facial view of the Olmec were-jaguar surmounted by a tripartite element. In a discus- sion of the "scepter," Navarrete (Navarrete 1971:71) has identified the tripartite element as rattles of the serpent, an identification that would have the middle section corresponding to the serpent's body. Relating the "scepter" to Monuments I and 2, then, it would seem that the symbolism of Mound 4 may have included the idea, if not the actual representation, of an encircling serpent. Depictions of serpent-dragon and were- jaguar figures side by side are nearly as old as iconography itself in Mesoamerica, as witnessed in an Early Preclassic Olmec style pottery design from Tlapacoya (Fig. 10) (Tolstoy and Paradis 1970:347-48). Thus, while there has been a tendency to see in the contrasting serpent-dragon and were-jaguar forms separate cultural influences (say for the were-jaguar, Olmec, and for the serpent-dragon, Maya), their existence as complementary, perhaps dualis- tically related images within a single religio- cultural world view seems more likely. As for dualism in Mesoamerica, there is ample evidence from the Conquest period of its centrality within the Aztec world view (cf. Klein 1975:69-85). The major importance of the Tzutzuculi monuments, however, stems not so much from their imagery per se, which is duplicated in other examples in the Olmec style, but in their association with platform building. Now there is an Olmec precedent for later platform-related iconography on the order of the Tzutzuculi</page><page sequence="7">566 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 42, No. 4, 1977] 0 5 Cm.

Final- ly, it should not be overlooked that, taking Tzutzuculi as an example, certainly the message of Monuments 1 and 2-as it may be-would be related to the significance of Mound 4 and even beyond, to, the overall design of the N-380-E platform complex at large.
