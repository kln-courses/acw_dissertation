Levy here is growing evidence that during the late fifth and fourth millennia B.c. significant technological and social changes occurred among societies living in Palestine. Some of these new developments can be seen in the establishment of formal temples and burial grounds, the emergence of craft specialization and metallurgy, a dramatic growth in the human population of the region, and the division of sites into spatial hier- archies with settlement centers that coordinated social, economic, and religious activities. These formative developments had direct bearing on the structure of Levantine societies in the following historic periods. In archaeological terms this protohis- toric period, dating roughly from 4500 to 3200 B.c., is called the Chal- colithic period. In this paper several anthropological concepts will be used to help explain these new de- velopments during the Chalcolithic age and place them within a social framework. The term Chalcolithic (from the Greek chalkos or copper and lithos or stone) grew out of the Three Age System, which was put forward by the Danish antiquarians Christian Thomsen and Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae as early as 1819. This be- came the basic method by which museum curators and antiquaries set their collections in order (Renfrew 1976).

This simple system enabled archae- ologists and curators working in Europe and later in the Near East to place archaeological finds into their approximate period. Despite recent advances in radiocarbon-dating methods and refinements in subdi- viding the prehistoric past, the terms Paleolithic, Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age are still used in the Old World as convenient general terms of reference. History of Research During the 1920s many regions in Palestine were still primarily archae- ological terrae incognitae. The chro- nology of the region was still unclear at that time. With the establishment of the British mandatory govern- ment in 1923, the first "golden age of Palestinian excavations" and research was born (King 1983: 55). It was dur- ing this time that the chronological framework that forms the basis of Palestinian archaeology today was first clarified. This was accomplished through widespread excavations and surveys carried out during the 1920s and 1930s (Gitin 1985). From 1929 to 1931 P&amp;re Alexis Mallon, director of the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Jerusalem, car- ried out some important excavations in a group of low mounds known as Teleilat el-Ghassul, located approxi- mately 5 kilometers from the north- east corner of the Dead Sea (Mallon, Koeppel, and Neuville 1934). There Mallon's team found four superim- posed strata, separated from one another by burned and windblown sediments, to a depth of about 5 meters. The material culture from the four strata was quite homoge- neous and represented a single new archaeological culture that was termed Ghassulian (Neuville 1930a). The Ghassulian culture had a char- acteristic flint-tool industry with diagnostic types including the so- called fan-scraper and bifacially flaked chisels. In addition to a dis- tinctive pottery industry, spectacu- lar frescoes were found painted on the plastered walls of some struc- tures. The original Ghassul frescoes contain geometric patterns and a depiction of a procession painted in rich combinations of red, brown, black, yellow, and white mineral paints. The best known example is the eight-pointed star of Ghassul that combines the geometric form with "spook" masks and imaginary creatures (Lee 1978). There was a great deal of contro- versy over the dating of the Ghas- sulian culture. Mallon, who died in 1934, maintained that Ghassul dated to shortly before 2000 B.c. This interpretation may have been in- fluenced by Mallon's belief that Ghassul corresponded to the area in which Genesis 13:12 locates the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:25). During the late 1920s and early 1930s artifacts similar to those re- covered at Ghassul were found at many sites in Palestine. These sites included a Galilean cave in the Wadi Shallaleh (Turville-Petre 1927); a pottery-bearing level of Mugharet el- Wad, near cAthlit (Garrod 1929); a series of sites along the Wadi Ghazzeh in the northern Negeb (Macdonald, Starkey, and Harding 1932); Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley (Engberg and Shipton 1934; Shipton 1938); Jericho (Garstang 1935); Beth-shean (Fitz- gerald 1935); and a Chalcolithic necropolis in Hadera (Sukenik 1937). It seems that William E Albright, then director of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem, was responsible for initiating the use of the term Chalcolithic as an archaeological-ceramic equivalent for the newly discovered Ghassulian phenomenon (Albright 1931, 1932). He arrived at this conclusion by syn- thesizing the wealth of new archae- ological materials excavated from a wide range of geographic locales in Palestine. 84 BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986</page><page sequence="4">The term Chalcolithic was first used by William FE Albright, who synthesized the wealth of archaeological materials excavated from many sites throughout Palestine.

Chronology and T'kansitions In terms of absolute chronology, the Chalcolithic period is fairly long. According to the available radiocar- bon dates, the Chalcolithic period begins no later than the mid-fifth millennium B.C. As James Weinstein (1984: 306) has noted, however, many of the assays may be too early for the late Chalcolithic era. The dates from the Early Bronze Ia indicate that the Chalcolithic ends approximately in the thirty-fourth century B.C. More radiocarbon determinations are urgently needed from well-stratified Chalcolithic sites to help clarify the chronology of this formative period. Today, radiocarbon dating pro- vides the main chronometric data for the protohistoric periods in Pal- estine. This has been highlighted by Weinstein's (1984) erudite survey of radiocarbon dating in the southern Levant. Until the middle 1970s diffu- sionist theories were used to explain the transition from the Late Neo- lithic to the Chalcolithic and from the Chalcolithic to the Early Bronze Age (deVaux 1971a, 1971b; Lapp 1970; Kenyon 1985; Wright 1971). In Pales- tine theories of diffusion centered on the assumption that cultural change could be explained as having been brought about by migrating peoples or contacts with the culture core-areas of Mesopotamia or Egypt. These contacts were viewed as hav- ing been accompanied by the trans- mission of new discoveries and ideas. In describing the idea of diffusion, Colin Renfrew stated that prehistory (and protohistory) "was seen as a kind of global chessboard, with the var- ious cultures as pieces shifting from square to square. The task of the ar- chaeologist was simply to plot the moves - or, in other words, trace the path of 'influence' as new ideas were diffused" (Renfrew 1976: 33). There is growing evidence that in some regions of Palestine the transitions from the Late Neolithic to Chalco- lithic and the Chalcolithic to the Early Bronze Age occurred within a local context (Amiran 1985; Callaway 1972; Miroschedji 1971). Although there is a paucity of published radio- carbon determinations for the Late Neolithic (8 dates), the Late Neo- lithiclChalcolithic (6 dates), Chalco- lithic (18 dates), Early Bronze I (25 dates), and Early Bronze II (26 dates) periods, some clear local evolution- ary trends can be seen. In discussing the radiocarbon dates from Teleilat el-Ghassul, J. Basil Hennessy (1982: 58) suggested that the lithic industry and the earli- est pottery from that site indicated connections with the pottery Neo- lithic cultures of Jericho and the upper phases at Ard Tlaili, Middle and Late Neolithic Byblos, and the southern Neolithic sites of the Beqac. These connections, however, are insufficient to fit the earliest Ghassul sequence into a specific slot in the Late NeolithiclEarly Chalco- lithic cultures of the Levant. At Qatif, located on the Negeb Coastal Plain (Epstein 1985a), Isaac Gilead's excavations have produced a radio- carbon date of 6040 i 80 B.P. (before present), which falls at the end of the Late Neolithic period (I. Gilead, personal communication; Gopher 1986). Gilead suggests that a local Late NeolithiclChalcolithic transi- tion is indicated by considering this date in conjunction with the lithic and pottery assemblages (which con- tain large quantities of straw inclu- sions) from Qatif and the nearby Wadi Ghazzeh sites (Macdonald, Starkey, and Harding 1932; Levy and Alon 1983). The transition from the Chalco- lithic to the Early Bronze Age has been a widely discussed topic be- cause it involves the origins of the first Palestinian urban centers. In a recent survey of theories that at- tempted to explain the origin of walled towns in this region, Thomas Schaub (1982) highlighted the in- digenous nature of the Chalcolithic/ Early Bronze Age transition. Schaub (1982: 74) noted that the major argu- ment against diffusion or foreign origin is the clear lack of foreign parallels in the material culture of the Early Bronze Age and the lack of evidence for a route of migration to Palestine. It is possible that future excavations and surveys in Syria and Jordan will produce some evidence of diffusion. The trend today, how- ever, is clear. To fully understand the processes that led to urbanism and social complexity in Palestine, the social and economic dynamics of the local Chalcolithic societies must be examined in relation to the sub- sequent Early Bronze Age societies. Chiefdoms in Chalcolithic Palestine Following the initial period of dis- covery in the late 1920s, there has been a steady stream of archaeolog- ical research concerning the Chalco- lithic period in Palestine but little theoretical work has been done to explain these new cultural develop- ments. To understand the large cor- pus of fourth-millennium data that has accumulated over the years, a conceptual model is needed to help integrate and interpret the develop- mental patterns that can be ob- served in the archaeological data. In dealing with the prehistoric and pro- 86 BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986</page><page sequence="6">tohistoric periods of Palestine, an- thropological models such as the ones suggested by Elman R. Service (1962), Morton Fried (1967), and Marshall Sahlins (1974) serve as a useful point of departure. These re- searchers used ethnographic data to suggest successive stages in the so- cial evolution of man. I would like to suggest that in some regions of the country many of the innovative developments ob- served in Chalcolithic Palestine can be explained as reflections of the development of social ranking and hierarchies. According to the ter- minology suggested by Service, the beginnings of social ranking are as- sociated with the emergence of a dis- tinctive social system that he called chiefdoms. According to Service, "chiefdoms are particularly distin- guished from tribes by the presence of centers which coordinate eco- nomic, social and religious activ- ities" (1962: 143). Chiefdoms are characterized by institutionalized offices of leadership such as priest- hoods. Christopher Peebles and Susan Kus (1977: 422) suggested that the gradation of social rank in chief- doms is not a smooth progression from the lowest to the highest rank- ing individual. In chiefdoms the chief and his lineage, and perhaps other closely related lineages, are qualitatively distinguished from the rest of society. The "office and the person of the chief and of his nearest kinsmen are marked by sumptuary rules, distinctive ways of dress, pre- scribed modes of behavior, and, usually, compulsory ritual behavior" (Peebles and Kus 1977: 422). The material correlates, or archae- ological clues, for the presence of chiefdoms in the archaeological record have been outlined by Renfrew (1973: 543). Some of these correlates include greater population density and total number in the population; increase in the size of individual res- idence groups; greater productivity; more clearly defined territorial boundaries or borders; centers that Researchers used ethnographic data to suggest successive stages in the social evolution ofman. coordinate social, religious, as well as economic activity; rise of priest- hoods; a ranked society; the redis- tribution of produce organized by the chief; an environmental situation favoring specialization in production over some ecological diversity; spe- cialization, not only regional or eco- logical but also through the pooling of individual skills in large coopera- tive endeavors; organization and de- ployment of public labor for agricul- tural work (for example, irrigation) or for building temples and temple mounds; potential for territorial ex- pansion- associated with the "rise and fall" of chiefdoms; distinctive dress or ornament for those of high status; and no true government to back up decisions by legalized force. As Renfrew (1973: 543) noted, the strength of this model is that it implies the co-occurrence of many of these features. As will be shown below, many of these features have been documented for Chalcolithic Palestine. Regional Cultural Groups One of the most striking features of the Chalcolithic period in Palestine in relation to the chiefdom model is the emergence of distinct regional cultures. This is particularly appar- ent when the distribution of fourth- millennium artifact assemblages and sites are compared with all the preceding prehistoric periods when regional diversity was not very pro- nounced (Bar-Yosef 1980). As outlined above, the distinct archaeological groups of the Chalcolithic period may represent specific adaptations to the mosaic of local environments that characterize Palestine. In the north of the country four primary regional groups have been isolated: the Golan Heights (Epstein 1977, 1979, 1985b); the Sharon Coastal Plain (Sukenik 1937; Perrot 1961); the Samarian Highlands (de Vaux and Steve 1947); and the Jezreell Beth-shean valleys (Anati, Avnimel- ech, Haas, and Meyerhof 1973; Dothan 1959a; TZori 1958). In the south of Palestine approximately seven re- gional and subregional groups have been isolated. These include the Jor- dan Valley/Ammon Plateau (Hennes- sy 1969; Ibrahim, Sauer, and Yassine 1976; R. Lee 1973; Mallon, Koeppel, and Neuville 1934; Stekelis 1935), the Judean Desert (Bar-Adon 1962; Benoit, Milik, and de Vaux 1961; Neuville and Mallon 1931), the NegeblSinai Coastal Plain (Macdon- ald, Starkey, and Harding 1932; Oren and Gilead 1981), the Nahal Gerar (Alon 1960; Oren and Gilead 1982, 1983, 1984), the Nahal Patish (Alon 1960, 1976, 1977), the Nahal Beer- sheba (Perrot 1955, 1984; Dothan 1959b; Levy 1981; Levy and Alon 1983), and the southern Sinai pen- insula (Bar-Yosef, Belfer, Goren, and Smith 1977). As Emmanuel Anati (1963: 296) pointed out, most of these southern Chalcolithic "prov- inces" are no greater than about 25 miles (approximately 40 kilometers) in length and represent separate cul- tural areas far smaller than later ar- chaeological culture areas. Planned Farming-Villages The emergence of centers for co- ordinating social, economic, and religious activities is clearly seen in the establishment of planned farming- communities. Although sedentary village-life was established in the Neolithic period and perhaps as early as the Natufian (around 9000 B.c.), it was during the Chalcolithic that BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986 87</page><page sequence="7">This bar graph shows the number of prehis- toric and protohistoric sites along the Nahal Beer-sheba/lower Nahal Besor in the northern Negeb in relation to their size in hectares. o; oo. !* Find Spot Use io a II I ~ ooa - ke s 0.1-O99 1.0-1.99 2.0-3. 4.0-5.99 6.0-9.5 sit. slae In hectarse Chalcolithic houses with courtyards mark the beginning of a village pattern that is similar in layout to the traditional, modern villages of the Middle East.

I, O O OO 0O OO Oo OO o O 0 0 large, advanced farming-villages first emerged in Palestine. In many re- spects the emergence of Chalcolithic houses with courtyards marks the beginning of a village pattern similar in layout to the traditional, modern villages of the Middle East (Kramer 1982). This is best seen in the large- scale excavations at Teleilat el- Ghassul (Mallon, Koeppel, and Neuville 1934; Koeppel and others 1940; Hennessy 1969; North 1961), Tell el-Farcah North (de Vaux and Steve 1948; de Vaux 1961), Tell Abu Matar (Perrot 1955), Bir es-Safedi (Perrot 1984), Horvat Beter (Dothan 1959b), and Shiqmim (Levy and Alon 1985a), which provide excellent plans of these advanced farming- villages. Compared with sites from the preceding Neolithic period (Bar-Yosef 1977; Moore 1973), the Chalcolithic villages are much larger. This is highlighted in the histogram or bar chart of Late Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze sites from the northern Negeb region. Teleilat el- Ghassul, by far the largest Chalco- lithic site in Palestine, covers an area of approximately 20 hectares, where- as the average Late Neolithic site in the western Negeb is less than 2 hect- ares in area (Levy 1981). Hennessy's (1982) excavations in- dicate that Ghassul was not a group of small, closely tied settlements represented by the numerous small mounds there but was one large set- tlement. The excavations by Alexis Mallon, Robert Koeppel, and their coworkers (Mallon, Koeppel, and Neuville 1934; Koeppel and others 1940) provide the most extensive vil- lage plans from Ghassul. At tell 1, for example, large rectangular build- ings (measuring about 6 by 12 meters) were found arranged in a symmetrical fashion. The buildings were densely packed and situated in conjunction with courtyards, small storage rooms, ovens (called tabuns in Arabic), alley- ways, and other features. At the Negeb site of Shiqmim, one of the largest Chalcolithic villages in west- ern Palestine (about 9.5 hectares), excavations have revealed a remark- ably similar pattern. There is a clear distinction between small domestic houses (approximately 2.5 by 5.5 meters) and larger buildings (about 5 by 10 meters) that may have served some kind of public function (Levy and Alon 1985a). The layout of these sites suggests the presence of a cen- tral authority who organized the public labor needed to build these planned settlements. More work needs to be done in the Golan to clarify the full range of architectural variability at Chalcolithic sites be- fore social inferences can be made in that region. Perhaps the most enigmatic as- pect of Chalcolithic settlement pat- terns in Palestine is the presence of subterranean tunnel and room net- works in the northern Negeb Desert. These subterranean chambers seem to be confined to a cluster of sites around the city of Beer-sheba and in- clude Tell Abu Matar (Perrot 1955), Bir es-Safedi (Perrot 1984), and Horvat Beter (Rosen and Eldar 1982).

The stratigraphy at these sites is extremely complex, particularly because these subterranean net- works are permeated with bell- shaped pits and other features. Evi- dence of well-preserved rectangular buildings are found close to the sur- face of these sites. Perrot (1955, 1984) suggested that this sequence represents three stages in an evolu- tionary pattern of village develop- ment from subterranean to open-air villages. This view was recently questioned by Iris Eldar and Yacaqov Baumgarten (1985: 139), who sug- gested that the subterranean features at Bir es-Safedi were used simulta- neously with the rectangular surface architecture. Unfortunately, they present no profiles or stratigraphic drawings to support their view. Specialization in the Chalcolithic The transition from egalitarian to chiefdom societies in Palestine can be clearly seen with the emergence of a wide range of craft specializations. Metallurgy. As Amile Durkheim (1933) showed, the building blocks of egalitarian societies are interchange- able, essentially identical units. In egalitarian societies the residential, productive, and decision-making units are virtually alike. The economic and productive sectors of these soci- eties have been called by anthropol- ogist Marshall Sahlins (1974) the domestic mode of production, or DMP. As Peebles and Kus (1977: 427) pointed out, in chiefdoms the family unit, the decision-making unit, and the domestic mode of production are transcended by politics, and these units become partially differentiated. Thus, the social building-blocks are no longer interchangeable- instead society is arrayed minimally in a two-level hierarchy of chief and asso- ciated offices and the remainder of society (Peebles and Kus 1977: 427). These social distinctions are high- lighted in the newly developed metal industry of Chalcolithic Palestine. The emergence of metallurgy signals the development of a number of eco- nomic activities that clearly went beyond the domestic mode of pro- duction (Sahlins 1974). Principally these included the procurement, processing, and manufacture of metal objects by specialists, presum- ably for a social elite. The main evidence for this shift away from the domestic mode of production comes from southern Palestine. In a cave in the Nahal Mishmar in the Judean Desert, Pessah Bar-Adon (1980) discovered one of the most spectacular copper hoards ever found in the Middle East. Radiocarbon determinations, as well as artifactual evidence, firmly date this find to the Chalcolithic period. The hoard contained over 400 mostly ritual objects including 10 "crowns," 138 copper standards, 8 copper jars, 16 copper tools, and over 240 copper maceheads. There seems little doubt that the copper crowns and standards are ritual ornaments that may sym- bolize fourth-millennium positions of social or ritual status. The precise origin of the Nahal Mishmar hoard has been the subject of considerable speculation. David Ussishkin (1971), however, has suggested that they were associated with ritual activ- ities carried out at the nearby Chal- colithic temple at En-gedi. BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986 89</page><page sequence="9">The advanced metalworking skills of Chalcolithic artists, combined with their use of creative design, are demonstrated in the hoard of copper objects from Nahal Mishmar. In a technological study of the spread of metallurgy in the Near East, R. F. Tylecote (1979) illustrated the complexity of ancient metallurgy in terms of the mining of ores, smelting activities, and the manu- facture of ritual objects and tools. The sources of Chalcolithic copper ores in Palestine have usually been ascribed to the Wadi Fidin east of the Dead Sea and the Timna Valley northwest of the Gulf of cAqabah (Perrot 1955; Rothenberg 1972). A smelting furnace that may date to Chalcolithic times was discovered at Timna, site 39 (Rothenberg, Tylecote, and Boydell 1978). To date, the only Chalcolithic village sites in western Palestine to produce evidence for actual workshops, furnaces, and slags come from the Nahal Beer- sheba sites of Tell Abu Matar (Perrot 1955), Bir es-Safedi (Perrot 1984; Eldar and Baumgarten 1985), and Shiqmim (Levy and Alon 1985a). Since the Beer-sheba sites are over 150 kilometers from the nearest copper source, it seems that these settlements received their metal in ingot form and cast it locally. An early spectrographic analysis of the Nahal Mishmar maceheads showed them to be of similar com- position to copper maceheads found at Tell Abu Matar (Key 1980; Perrot 1955). A material study of a mace- head from Nahal Mishmar indicated that these and other elaborate non- functional ornaments were probably manufactured by the lost-wax cast- ing process (Potaszkin and Bar-Avi 1980). In terms of future research it will be important to clarify the socio- economic role that metallurgy played among fourth-millennium societies in Palestine. Flint-tool production. The establish- ment of manufacturing sites and the distribution of a number of Chalco- lithic flint-tool types serve as other indications that economic activities went beyond the domestic mode of production during the fourth millen- nium in Palestine. The main tool types include: scrapers (round, end, side, and tabular), sickles, retouched and backed blades, retouched blade- lets (bladelets, microendscrapers, macrolunates, microlunates), notches, denticulates, awls, borers, bifaces (axes, adzes, chisels), burins, arrow- heads, paleoliths, hammer stones, and miscellaneous tools. Studies by Isaac Gilead (personal communication), Ann Roshwalb (1981), and Steven Rosen (in press) have highlighted the presence of specialist flint-tool workshops in the northern Negeb. For example, Rosen (in press) has pointed out that many of the large village sites in the Nahal Beer-sheba are characterized by in- dustries that contain the following: medium to high percentages of flake tools, reflecting domestic activities; medium to low percentages of spe- cialized tools such as bifaces, sickles, tabular scrapers, drills, microborers, and other bladelet tools; and high percentages of debitage, reflecting Right: Over 240 copper maceheads were also found at Nahal Mishmar.

Courtesy of the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums. Growing evidence indicates that the production of flint- tool types was a specialized task during the Chalcolithic era. the production of simple flake tools. In contrast to these inland vil- lages, sites excavated by Eann Mac- donald (Macdonald, Starkey, and Harding 1932; Roshwalb 1981) along the Wadi Ghazzeh (lower Nahal Besor) on the Negeb Coastal Plain show clear evidence of specialization. For example microborers are the major tool-type at one site (site M), while another site (site A) has been described by Roshwalb (1981) as a secondary manufacturing site for fan-scrapers. The latter site also seems to have been a production center for sickle blades because over 1,000 blade cores were recovered. In addition, this site shows evidence for bifacial tool production with numerous blanks suggesting on-site manufacture (S. Rosen, in press). Steven Rosen (1983) has also docu- mented the existence of a fourth- millennium tabular-scraper trade that extended from quarry sites in the central Negeb highlands, to sec- ondary production centers (like site A), to recipient sites such as Shiq- mim, Megiddo stratum 20 (Crowfoot 1948), and other sites. Delicate star- and disk-shaped flint tools have been found in the Jordan Valley (Mallon, Koeppel, and Neuville 1934), in the Hauran (Nasrallah 1948), and the Golan (Epstein 1977) regions. Archae- ologists do not know what the func- tion of these tools was; however, they were finely worked and seem to be a further indication of craft spe- cialization. There are other tools that may have been made by special- ists, such as the newly identified microendscraper (I. Gilead 1984). More studies concerning the Chal- colithic flint-tool industry clearly will be of great help in identifying patterns of trade and production dur- ing the fourth millennium. Ivory industry. Further evidence for a shift away from the domestic mode of production can be seen in the ivory industry of southern Palestine. The manufacture of ivory cult-objects is well attested during the Chalco- lithic. These objects are known pri- marily from the Nahal Beer-sheba sites (Bir es-Safedi-Perrot 1959; Shiqmim-Levy and Alon 1985a) and the Cave of the Treasure in the Judean Desert (Bar-Adon 1980). At Bir es-Safedi, Perrot (personal com- munication) found ivory detritus and unfinished ivory objects in situ, suggesting it was a specialized work- shop. The ivories include finely carved anthropomorphic statuettes and sickle-shaped objects.

The two male and one female figures share many similarities. All are depicted nude and in a rigid, standing position with their hands on their hips. Unfortunately the female statuette's head is missing, but the other two display similar characteristics: an unusually long nose that begins at the top of the forehead and extends down to the bottom of the face; circular drilled holes for eyes, which were probably filled with a substance like malachite; the absence of a mouth; and simple protuberances for ears. How the figurines were used is unclear. Far left: The male figurine from chamber 721 is awkwardly proportioned with its legs appearing quite short in comparison to its arms. It is represented wearing an ornamented phallic sheath. The figurine is 25 centimeters high. Left: A more elegantly proportioned male figurine was discovered in 1955 in chamber 318. The face is encircled by perforations, which the excavator believed were for the attachment of a false beard and hair. Evidence of a belt, loincloth, or phallic sheath exists- the figurine was partially damaged during its recovery. It measures 33 centimeters high. Right: A female ivory statuette of the Chalcolithic period was found in 1959 in the subterranean habitation 793-798 at Bir es-Safedi. Although partly damaged, enough remains of this figurine to show strong similarities, especially in the position of the arms and the disproportionately rendered legs, to the two male ivory statuettes also discovered at the site. Particular emphasis has been placed on the sexual features, and the enlarged abdomen most likely represents the woman as being pregnant. The figurine is preserved to a height of 12 centimeters.

With the exception of a box made of elephant ivory, all of these objects were of hippopotamus tusk. Bar-Adon (1980: 16) believed that these objects were probably ritual standards that were carried on wooden poles inserted into the cen- tral perforations. Ceramic technology. The introduc- tion of the wheel in the ceramic in- dustry indicates mass production and another shift away from the domestic mode of production. There is clear evidence for the introduction of the wheel (referred to as the slow wheel or tournette) during the Chal- colithic period (Amiran, Beck, and Zevulun 1970.) This is most clearly seen on small V-shaped bowls that show evidence of wheel marks. Compared with the preceding pot- tery assemblages of the Late Neo- lithic period, where only a small number of types are found, there is a dramatic increase in the quality, decoration, and variety of ceramic forms during the Chalcolithic. The Beer-sheba sites are associated with 9 basic types (and 45 subtypes) including large pithoi, holemouth vessels, small globular jars, jars, bowls, basins, footed vessels, vessels with multiple handles, and churns (de Contenson 1956).

The production of basalt objects, which involved much time and labor, and the ritual contexts in which many were found, suggests that they were greatly valued by Chalcolithic people. pottery corpus (Wright 1937), are extremely rare at the Beer-sheba sites but are quite common along the Nahal Gerar (Oren and Gilead 1984). Steven Kangas (in preparation) is currently examining the role of pottery specialization in trade and redistribution networks of the fourth- millennium Negeb region. Basalt industry. Like the metal, flint- tool, ivory, and ceramic industries, the procurement, manufacture, and distribution of finely made basalt vessels is another indication of the development of segments of an econ- omy beyond the domestic mode of production. The basalt vessels are highly polished and include footed "incense burners," large open basins with incised herringbone patterns, bowls on tripods, and other forms. At Tell Abu Matar no evidence of basalt detritus was found. Thus, Per- rot (1955: 78) suggested that these vessels were brought to the site '* / ~..,. ?t r iv ?`~ '?? ;?? ?~-,z '$ ?, I-L .? .. ?~ 4 z r ?4 T~ ( ?.r _~J! ~ 7 i'S:t J ?;-.- ?, r ?, :rr f 1 r(?rlr ~ ?

The large amount of labor in- volved in their production and the ritual context in which many basalt vessels were found suggest that they were of great value. Basalt was also used in the manufacture of Chalco- lithic pillar-statues in the Golan region (Epstein 1982) and anthropo- morphic statuettes in the Beer-sheba Valley (Levy and Alon 1985a). The main basalt source areas of the region are the Golan, the Galilee, the Makhtesh Ramon in the Negeb, and the Black Desert in eastern Pal- estine. A petrographic provenience study of fourth-millennium basalt artifacts from the northern Negeb sites of Gilat, Small Tell Malhata, and Arad revealed some interesting facts about the origin of the source materials of these objects (Amiran and Porat 1984). The researchers determined that the origin of the material used for making the Negeb basalt vessels was far away in the north (that is, the Galilee, the Golan, or Transjordan) from basalt deposits dated to the Neogene-Pleistocene age. This study highlights the long distances Chalcolithic craftsmen and traders would go to obtain high- quality basalt material. There are other specialist indus- tries that may mark a departure from the domestic mode of production. These include the labor-intensive production of beads, bone, and mother-of-pearl pendants, as well as exotic stone objects. The presence of what seems to be a specialist site associated with turquoise mining (presumably for beads) near Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai (Beit-Arieh 1980) highlights the need to examine the production and distribution of these and other objects in relation to fourth-millennium production, trade networks, and social organization. Formal Cemeteries In Palestine the establishment of formal burial-grounds located apart from habitation sites has its origin during the Chalcolithic period. This phenomenon reflects a number of the archaeological correlates out- lined earlier for chiefdoms. These include more clearly defined terri- torial boundaries, centers that coor- dinate religious activities, the im- portance of ritual coordinators (that is, priests), and the deployment of public labor to build burial monu- ments and facilities. In a cross- cultural ethnographic survey of thirty societies, Lynne Goldstein concluded that the presence of permanent, spatially defined burial grounds are likely to represent a corporate group that has rights over the use and/or control of cru- cial but restricted resources. This corporate control is most likely to be attained and/or legitimised by means of lineal descent from the dead, either in terms of an actual lineage or in the form of a strong, established tradition of the critical resource passing from parent to off- spring. (Goldstein 1981: 61) In Palestine, the concern with terri- tory may relate to the development of more sophisticated farming and herding practices. These problems are discussed below. A necropolis in the Jordan Valley. To date, four geographic zones have pro- duced evidence of formal Chalco- lithic cemeteries in Palestine. These include the lower Jordan Valley/Moab Plateau, the Sharon Coastal Plain, the southern Sinai peninsula, and the Nahal Beer-sheba in the northern Negeb. During their survey of the southern Jordan Valley/Moab Plateau from 1929 to 1930 Ren6 Neuville and his colleagues (Neuville 1930b; Mallon, Koeppel, and Neuville 1934: 153) discovered an extensive fourth- millennium cemetery at Tell cAdeimeh, located less than 6 kilometers southeast of Teleilat el- Ghassul. They believed cAdeimeh was the necropolis of Teleilat el- Ghassul. In 1933 Moshe Stekelis (1935) carried out extensive excava- tions at cAdeimeh and discovered eleven circular tumuli varying in diameter from 3.85 to 7.0 meters located close to the site surface. These were associated with 168 cist graves measuring less than 1.5 meters in length. Eighty percent of these did not exceed 1 meter in length (Stekelis 1935: 66). Although the human skeletal remains were poorly preserved, the method of interment seems to have been secondary burial. Burial caves in the Coastal Plain. As early as 1934, Eliezer L. Sukenik dis- covered a new type of Chalcolithic cemetery previously undetected in Palestine. At Hadera, Sukenik (1937) excavated a man-made cave that had been dug into the kurkar sand-ridge and filled with large ceramic ossu- aries, Chalcolithic pottery, human 96 BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986</page><page sequence="16">Below: Plan of the Shiqmim Chalcolithic cemetery 1 in the northern Negeb.

Like cAdeimeh the method of interment was secondary burial. In the years since 1934, Chalcolithic burial caves containing ossuaries made of clay and stone have been discovered at Bene-barak (Ory 1946), Azor (Perrot 1961), Givatayim (Sussman and Ben- Arieh 1966), Ben Shemen (Perrot and Ladiray 1980), and Palmahim (Gophna 1968). There are many similarities between the material culture found in these burial caves and the artifacts found in the Beer-sheba sites. Perrot (1968; Perrot and Ladiray 1980) sug- gested that Chalcolithic pastoralists from the Beer-sheba region may have used these burial caves during their seasonal movements on the coastal plain in search of pasture lands. Burial grounds in the Northern Negeb. Additional evidence for the presence of ritual centers has been found in the recently discovered Chalcolithic cemetery complex at Shiqmim in the northern Negeb. The first Chal- colithic cemetery site to be discov- ered in this region was found in 1979 and it was associated with the Shiq- mim village along the Nahal Beer- sheba (Levy and Alon 1979). The size of the Shiqmim village and other sites in the region led David Alon and myself to question Perrot's cem- etery/seasonality hypothesis and to carry out a survey in the vicinity of Shiqmim in search of a more local cemetery used by the inhabitants of the Beer-sheba settlements. The Shiqmim cemetery is very large (about 8 hectares in area) and was found adjacent to the village extend- ing over 800 meters along a series of four Eocene chalk hills that parallel the Nahal Beer-sheba (Levy and Alon 1982). To date excavations have re- vealed 40 burial circles that range in size from less than 1 meter to over 3.5 meters in diameter. Secondary burials, comprised primarily of long bones and skull fragments, were found placed in the circles with a wide range of burial offerings. These included diagnostic Beer-sheba pot- tery vessels, lambis-shell bracelets, mother-of-pearl pendants, beads, and other objects. It seems that each in- dividual was buried with at least one typical Chalcolithic V-shaped bowl. In addition to the grave circles, ten well-built stone-lined pits or cists were found surrounding a group of circular graves on one of the hilltops (Levy and Alon 1985b). The cists average 1.95 by 1.34 by .72 meters in depth. A minimum of one V-shaped bowl was found on the floor of each cist. Although all of the soil deposits found in these structures were sieved, no human-bone remains were re- trieved. As a working hypothesis, Alon and I (Levy and Alon 1985b) suggested that the cists were used as decay pits from primary burials. Once the flesh decayed from the bodies placed in the cists, selected bones were placed in the grave circles. The surprising discovery of ossuaries, including one that is house-shaped, in one of the hilltop cemeteries (identical to those found on the Sharon Plain), suggests that Perrot's (1968) hypothesis should be reeval- uated. The height of the ossuaries indicates that the circles may be the stone foundations of burial struc- tures that had mudbrick walls. The closest parallel to this type of fourth- millennium burial structure can be found in the nawamis of the southern Sinai peninsula. The nawamis of Sinai.

During the years 1972 to 1982, Ofer Bar-Yosef, Avner Goren, and other Israeli schol- ars made intensive field investiga- tions of these structures. It is gener- ally agreed that these well-preserved stone-built structures were con- structed during the fourth millen- nium B.c. by indigenous pastoralists and used as tombs (Bar-Yosef, Belfer, Goren, and Smith 1977; Bar-Yosef, Hershkovitz, Arbel, and Goren 1983). Up until 1982 twenty-one fields of nawamis were found concentrated on the fringes of the central mountain region with a northern extension into the Nubian sandstone area of the peninsula. The nawamis gen- erally have the same rounded plan -3 to 6 meters in diameter and approximately 2 meters in height. They are usually double-walled and built of local stone, either sandstone slabs or granitic or metamorphic boulders. A wide range of burial offer- ings were found in the nawamis. These include beads (mostly denta- lium, connus, carnelian, faience, bone, and ostrich eggshell), mother- of-pearl pendants, lambis-shell brace- lets, transverse arrowheads, fan- scrapers, and some copper points. Bar-Yosef, Belfer, Goren, and Smith (1977) suggested that the nawamis were used as graves for family units. Both primary and secondary burials were found in the numerous fully excavated nawamis (Bar-Yosef, Hersh- kovitz, Arbel and Goren 1983: 58). In a study concerning the western orientation of the entrances of 264 nawamis from seven different burial fields, some important aspects of fourth-millennium ritual and terri- toriality were discovered (Bar-Yosef, Hershkovitz, Arbel, and Goren 1983). The study considered two hypotheses concerning the orientation of the entrances: 1) that they were directed toward an important or sacred geo- graphical feature; or 2) that they faced the direction of the sunset because of some religious belief. The study's researchers preferred the latter explanation, comparing the western orientation of the nawamis to the Egyptian concept of the de- ceased going to the land of the set- ting sun and the western orientation of Egyptian burial structures. By analyzing the correlation between the orientation of the nawamis en- trances to the points on the horizon where the sun sets throughout the year (the points thus corresponding to annual dates), the researchers de- termined that most of the nawamis were constructed during one season of the year-winter. Few were built during June/July or December. The excavators concluded that the nawa- mis fields mark the winter camping and grazing areas of an ancient pas- toral group (or groups) and noted that today winter is the period of optimal 98 BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986</page><page sequence="18">Thiessen polygons, drawn on a map in relation to larger settlements, define the theoretical territories of the Chalcolithic centers of the northern Negeb. 0 o 5km * Settlement center * Subsidiary sites Gerar Hay S AbuHd *? * Ab HAbi . ** / *nU* *?

The establishment of these formal burial-grounds in close association with optimal graz- ing lands, which were of restricted distribution, is a clear expression of a concern for territoriality during the fourth millennium B.c. 'Irritories Systematic archaeological surveys carried out during the past fifteen years provide a reliable data base for reconstructing aspects of social and economic systems in antiquity. The early archaeological surveys carried out in Palestine were for the most part unsystematic in that only large sites or sites connected with historic traditions were recorded. The re- cording of important variables such as site size, intensive surface collec- tions, geomorphological setting, and other environmental data was gen- erally ignored. This was primarily because of the emphasis on historical reconstruction (Glueck 1935, 1939; Albright 1948). (These remarks are not meant to detract from the im- portant contributions made by ear- lier scholars.) It was only during the 1970s, however, that archaeologists working in the Middle East began to seriously consider the problem of sampling and the representative na- ture of their observations (Bar-Yosef and Phillips 1977; Bar-Yosef and Goren 1980; Henry and others 1981; B. Macdonald and others 1982; Red- man and Watson 1970; Johnson 1973). As these surveys have shown, data concerning site size and environ- mental setting can be of great help in determining the ancient economy and social structure of archaeological cultures. In the northern Negeb an inten- sive systematic archaeological survey was made along the Nahal Beer- sheba and lower Nahal Besor over a distance of 110 kilometers with the aim of recording all Late Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze Age sites within 500 meters of the drain- age channel (Alon and Levy 1980; Levy 1981). A total of seventy Chal- colithic sites were recorded from the protohistoric periods. Thirty of these contained evidence of rectangular- building architecture and were clas- sified as villages. Some of these in- cluded sites that had previously been excavated, such as Tell Abu Matar, Bir es-Safedi, H.orvat Beter, and Zecelim (Cohen 1972). When these villages were ranked according to their size, using a geographic method called the rank-size rule (Hodder and Orton 1976), it was clear that a two- tier settlement hierarchy existed during the Chalcolithic period along the Nahal Beer-sheba. The larger set- tlements that are over 8 hectares in size presumably served as subregion- BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986 99</page><page sequence="19">Isolated in an unsettled area during Chal- colithic times, this temple at En-gedi near the Dead Sea may have served a wide area and was thus a focus for pilgrimage. al centers that coordinated social, economic, and ritual activities for the people that inhabited the wadi- valley environment. These centers were surrounded by smaller satellite sites that ranged from 0.25 to 4.85 hectares in area. To gain some idea of the possible territorial boundaries of the four Nahal Beer-sheba/Lower Nahal Besor centers, Thiessen polygons were used. This method had been widely used by archaeologists working with Neolithic long barrows in Britain (Renfrew 1973), Neolithic chiefdoms in Malta (Renfrew 1974), and many other regions. As the geographer Peter Haggett (1971: 247) explained, Thiessen polygons are constructed on a map by first drawing lines be- tween a given settlement center to each adjacent center; then bisecting each of these intersettlernent center lines to give the midpoint of the line; and finally from the midpoint of the line a boundary line is drawn at right angles to the original inter- secting line to give a series of poly- gons. The polygons define theoretical territories related to each settlement center. The three other large Chalco- lithic settlement centers outside the survey area in the northern Negeb were included in this analysis. With- out more detailed survey and analyt- ical work on other northern Negeb wadis, however, the "territories" de- fined here can only be regarded as provisional. The other sites included in the analysis are Gilat, located along the Nahal Patish (Alon 1960, 1976, 1977); Gerar Hay, situated along the Nahal Gerar (Alon 1960; Oren and Gilead 1984); and Abu Hof in the piedmont southwest of Lahav (Alon and Levy, in preparation). This northern Negeb spatial pattern represents the two- tier settlement system described above and is an additional indication of the presence of chiefdoms during the Chalcolithic according to the models of Service (1962) and Fried (1967). Temples The construction of temples is a clear indication of the organization and deployment of public labor (Renfrew 1984). It seems that the earliest well- defined temple precincts in Palestine appeared during the Chalcolithic period. During the earlier Pre-pottery Neolithic B period (around 6000 B.C.), a single-chamber shrine was found in Jericho stratum 11 by John Garstang. It was associated with numerous clay and mud figurines primarily representing domestic animals (Garstang 1935; Garstang and Garstang 1940; Seton-Williams 1949). A remarkable cache of human statues made of plaster from the Pre- pottery Neolithic B site of cAin Ghazal near Amman was recently found in a pit but without direct stratigraphic association with any structures (Rollefson 1985: 59). An isolated Chalcolithic temple- complex at En-gedi in the Judean Desert, overlooking the Dead Sea, represents the clearest example of an early temple precinct in Palestine (Amiran 1981; Kempinski 1972). The En-gedi sanctuary consists of four separate structures all connected by a stone fence that encloses a roughly rectang~ular courtyard. These include the main gatehouse, a postern or secondary gate, a lateral chamber, and the sanctuary. A circular instal- lation was built in the center of the courtyard (Ussishkin 1980: 4). The site is isolated; no settlement sites are in the vicinity. Ussishkin (1980: 34) suggested the site was probably a central temple serving a wide region and was a focus for pilgrimage. The nearest contemporary sanc- tuaries that are known are located at Teleilat el-Ghassul and Gilat situ- ated along the Nahal Patish in the northern Negeb (Alon 1977). The layout of the Ghassul temple in area E is very similar to that of the sanc- tuary at En-gedi (Hennessy 1982: 56). Resurfacing of the buildings in area E indicates prolonged use of the temple. A series of eight superim- posed wall-paintings were counted in one building; unfortunately the mural was completely shattered. The wall-paintings found during the early excavations by Mallon, Koep- pel, and Neuville (1934) suggest the presence of several temples at that site. Although the excavations at Gilat have not been completed or fully published, David Alon (1977) found evidence of two rooms that bordered a courtyard and seem to 100 BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986</page><page sequence="20">Several unusual objects, possibly having cultic significance, were discovered during the exca- vations of the Chalcolithic temple at Gilat.

These include fragments of a sche- matic violin-shaped figurine made of crystalline chalk, churns, thick pipe- shaped vessels with double handles, cosmetic boards and maceheads made of granite and basalt, and two ceramic statuettes - one represent- ing a female seated on a pedestal with a churn on her head and the other representing a ram with three cornets on its back. During a survey of the site, Alon (personal communi- cation) also found a complete violin- shaped statuette made of granite in the vicinity of the temple area. The subject of fourth-millennium cult practice is beyond the scope of Above: One of the ceramic figurines from the temple of Gilat is of an awkwardly rendered, nude female figure shown seated on a pedestal and balancing a churn on her head with her right arm. Under the figure's left arm is a small clay vessel in the shape of a chalice or pedestal- bowl. The entire object is elaborately decorated: Her eyes are represented as painted circles; vertical, wavy lines painted on both sides of her face and along the back of her head may indicate braids or curly hair; and horizontal lines encircling her body may represent clothing, tattooing, or may simply be decoration. It is approximately 31 centi- meters high. Courtesy of the Israel Department ofAntiq- uities and Museums. Above left: The ceramic vessel from Gilat is of a ram with three cornets on its back.

As Claire Epstein (1985a) has pointed out, however, Chalco- lithic statuettes and figurines from Palestine are primarily connected with the two main branches of the contemporary economy. This in- cludes sheep/goat rearing and agri- culture. According to Epstein (1985a) these objects are essentially cultic in character, implying a use in rites to promote increase and prosperity. Agrotechnology Intensive farming. The "agricultural revolution," a concept suggested by Gordon Childe (1936), began in Pal- estine during the Natufian period (around 10,300 to 8500 B.c.) and ended around the Late Neolithic when most domestic wheat and barley species were well established (Harlan and Zohary 1966; Zohary 1969). This process represented the transi- tion from man-the-gatherer-and- hunter to man-the-agriculturalist. As Mordecai Kislev (1984) has pointed out, there are three phases in this so- called revolution that apply to plants and animals: first, the agrotechnical revolution, which occurred within a society still based on hunting and gathering; second, the "domestica- tion revolution," that is, the cultiva- tion and domestication of wild plants and animals; and, third, the expansion of agriculture. With the growth in human populations in Pal- estine during the fourth millennium, agrotechnology became much more intensive and more specialized than before. There is growing evidence that floodwater-farming played an impor- tant role in the subsistence base of Chalcolithic societies in Palestine. At Jawa in the Black Desert of east- ern Palestine, Svend Helms (1981) has documented a wide range of water systems that seem to date to the late Chalcolithic period. These include water-storage facilities, dams, deflection walls, canals, and conduits. Water was deflected from Paleoenvironments t has become clear that to understand Chalcolithic social organization and economy in Palestine researchers must consider the paleoenvironmental framework in which protohistoric events occurred. The main lines of paleo- environmental evidence come from botany (palynology), geomorphology, studies of deep-sea cores, and lake (lacustrine) deposits. Although a full discus- sion of this topic is beyond the scope of this paper, several important trends and concepts should be mentioned. In a soon-to-be-published survey article, Paul Goldberg and Arlene M. Rosen will summarize the paleoenvironmental data available from Israel and the surrounding areas. After reviewing the available evidence, Goldberg and Rosen will suggest that during the earlier half of the Holocene (around 10,000 to 5000 B.P.) conditions were wetter than the second half. They will point out that although this trend seems real, one must also consider that there is very little paleoenvironmental data for the historical periods. They will also indicate that within the Early Holocene there may have been two wetter intervals (one around 9000 to 7000 B.P. and another at 5500 B.P.) separated by a drier interval roughly between 7000 to 5500 B.P. This is shown primarily by oxygen isotopes from deep-sea cores (Luz 1982) and the Dead Sea data (Neev and Emery 1967; Neev and Hall 1977). Thus, the second moist phase is centered around 5500 B.P. and would cover the very end of the Chalcolithic and the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. As Goldberg and Rosen (in press) will point out, the terms wetter and drier are literal since the quality and sparseness of the data prevent research- ers from translating this data into absolute measurements of precipitation or temperature. In a study of the deposition of ancient soils (paleosols) in the northern Negeb, however, H. J. Bruins and D. H. Yaalon (1979: 168) suggested a southern shift of the rainfall isohyets over southern Palestine so that conditions would have been perhaps 100 to 150 millimeters wetter than today. More work is clearly needed to obtain more accurate precipitation reconstruc- tions. According to a study now being carried out by G. Goodfriend on fossil land-snail shells in the northern Negeb, it may be possible to correlate past vegetation zones with protohistoric rainfall zones (delineated by isohyets). This would provide archaeologists with the much needed absolute measure- ments of ancient rainfall. Although the accumulating evidence points to wetter conditions during the Chalcolithic, archaeologists should be leery of explaining fourth- millennium settlement solely on the basis of environmental considerations. For example, in explaining the settlement patterns in the southern Levant from the Upper Paleolithic (about 30,000 to 22,000 B.P.) to the Bronze Age, Goldberg and Bar-Yosef (1982) employed a model based on modern hunter- gatherers. This model suggests that during drought and lean years, desertic areas are abandoned by hunter-gatherers and during rainy years these arid regions are reoccupied. While this correlation may exist and may be of great value in studying ancient hunter-gatherers, it is too simplistic a model to explain the settlement processes associated with the developed farming villages of the Chalcolithic period. This is most readily seen in the fact that even under the optimal rainfall conditions suggested by paleosol data from the northern Negeb (Bruins and Yaalon 1979) there was not enough rainfall to insure successful dry-farming of the Chalcolithic village dwellers in the region (Arnon 1972). Thus, I suggest that archaeologists examine a greater range of variables to explain the growth and stability of protohistoric settle- ment and not simply rely on environmental determinism to explain culture change in Palestine. 102 BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986</page><page sequence="22">Advancements in agricultural production are evidenced during the Chalcolithic period by the initial stages offruit cultivation. For example, olives first appear in Palestine during the fourth millennium B.C.E. floods in the adjacent Wadi Rajil to irrigate fields and to fill a network of water-storage facilities connected with the settlement. In the northern Negeb, settlement sites along the Nahal Beer-sheba also seem to have utilized floodwater-farming prin- ciples. This reconstruction is based on four lines of evidence: a site catch- ment analysis (a method for attempt- ing to reconstruct the economy of archaeological sites) of these villages that shows a statistically significant relationship between the settlements and the restricted distribution of the valley-bottom soils associated with the wadi environment (Levy 1983); the presence of small dams that form microcatchments (and gardens) within the confines of these villages (Levy 1981); fragments of diversion walls along the banks of the main wadi channel (Levy 1981); and plant phytolite remains that suggest that crops of barley and wheat were grown under irrigated conditions (A. M. Rosen, in press). The organization of labor needed to carry out floodwater- farming activities in these marginal environmental zones may be another indication of the existence of chief- doms in Chalcolithic Palestine. The intensification of agricultural production is also evidenced by the beginnings of fruit growing in the Chalcolithic. Olives (Olea europea 1.) make their first appearance in Palestine during the fourth millen- nium, most notably from Teleilat el- Ghassul and the Cave of the Treasure near En-gedi (Zohary and Spiegel- Roy 1975; Stager 1985). Carbonized date stones (Phoenix dactylifera 1.) were also found at these sites. Nu- merous carbonized olive stones were found at Ghassul in close association with cereal grains, dates, and pulses. Daniel Zohary and Pinhas Spiegel- Roy (1975) suggested that olives from BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986 103</page><page sequence="23">Changes in fautnal remains and the lack of arrowheads in Chalcolithic lithic assemblages indicate very little dependence on hunting compared with the preceding period. Ghassul were grown under irrigated conditions, similar to that of Jericho and Beth-shean today. Because fruit remains are rare or totally absent from Neolithic farming villages, they concluded that olives and dates ap- parently became integral elements of food production during the Chal- colithic. The development of horti- culture in association with crop agriculture and animal husbandry during the Chalcolithic marks the beginning of the type of mixed econ- omy that characterizes the Mediter- ranean and Levantine lands today. Animal husbandry. Adaptation to the distinct geographic zones in Palestine is also seen in the exploitation of domestic animals. The main species found at Chalcolithic sites include sheep (Ovis aries), goat (Capra hir- cus), cattle (Bos taurus brachyceros), and pig (Sus scrofa palustris). The classic archaeozoological work con- cerning the protohistoric periods of Palestine was done by Pierre Ducos (1968). Archaeozoologists are, how- ever, beginning to reinvestigate the whole problem of relationships be- tween protohistoric humans and animals (Davis 1976; Grigson, in press). Compared with Late Neolithic faunal assemblages, there is a marked drop in the number of Gazella sp. and cervids represented at Chalco- lithic sites. This fact and the lack of arrowheads in Chalcolithic lithic assemblages indicate very little dependence on hunting as a subsis- tence strategy compared with the preceding period. The bones of pigs can be ex- tremely useful in helping to identify adaptations of local microenviron- ments. This is because pigs lack pro- tective hair and are unable to sweat (Mount 1968). To cool their bodies they need external sources of mois- ture (for example, muddy areas). As Harris (1978: 36-37) noted, the hotter and higher the temperature, the "dirt- ier" pigs become. According to Har- ris (1978: 36-37), this physiographic attribute supports the theory that the ritual uncleanliness of the pig derives from observations of physical dirtiness. In the northern Negeb, the re- gional distribution of pigs indicates marked variation over short distances within this semiarid zone. No pig re- mains have been found in the Nahal Beer-sheba villages such as Bir es- Safedi, Tell Abu Matar, Shiqmim, and Horvat Beter. About 20 kilo- meters downstream on the Nahal Besor, however, Eann Macdonald's (Macdonald, Starkey, and Harding 1932) site D, which was reexcavated by Perrot (1968; Ducos 1968), con- tained 33.8 percent of pig bones. At Gilat, pig represents about 17.3 per- cent of the faunal remains (Levy 1981). Although these samples are small, both Gilat and site D are lo- cated in the more humid zone of the northern Negeb (annual rainfall is approximately 200 to 300 milli- meters today). The Beer-sheba sites are located along the interface be- tween the arid desert and the semi- arid (annual rainfall is less than 200 millimeters) environment. Thus, pig husbandry would have been a higher risk activity in the Beer-sheba valley because of the physiological nature of these animals. In regard to herd animals, the question of the origins of the subtle changes associated with the exploi- tation of the secondary products of sheep and goats is gaining interest among scholars. Andrew Sherratt (1981) suggested that intensive secondary-products utilization took place in the Old World only around four millennia after the beginning of animal domestication; he referred to this process as the secondary- products revolution. This is charac- terized by the exploitation of animals for labor, transport, and secondary products such as milk and wool. The success of this herd-management system can be gauged by the fact that it is still practiced in the Middle East by many nomadic groups (Noy- Meir and Seligman 1979). In a study that I made (Levy 1981, 1983) I sug- gested that specialized pastoralism in the southern Levant evolved, in concert with population growth and the increased exploitation of the floodplain areas around nucleated Chalcolithic village settlements, in the northern Negeb. Keeping sheep and goat herds away from the critical floodplain areas during growing and harvesting periods was probably an important factor in promoting the need for specialized pastoralists. In addition, as permanent settlement expanded further east along the trough-shaped valleys such as the Nahal Beer-sheba, the more arid conditions in that region would have created a seasonal need to move herds away from permanent settle- ments in search of pasture land. Conclusion In this survey a chiefdom model has been used to help explain the in- crease in socioeconomic complexity observed during the Chalcolithic period in Palestine. This model is of great help in analyzing a number of cultural developments that emerged for the first time during the fourth millennium B.C. These include growth in human populations, the 104 BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGIST/JUNE 1986</page><page sequence="24">emergence of craft specialization and extensive trade networks, the establishment of formal sanctuaries and burial grounds, and the develop- ment of sophisticated agricultural and animal-husbandry methods. The emphasis has been placed on the southern Chalcolithic cultures, par- ticularly in the lower Jordan Valley and the northern Negeb Desert. The reason for this is that more work has been done in these areas and the data conforms closely to the chiefdom model. As Renfrew (1982) suggested, the most fruitful lines of investigation into the processes that led to socio- economic change in the protohis- toric periods are the study of the intensification of production and the study of the interaction between polities. In Europe, agricultural in- tensification has been shown to cor- relate closely with social complexity (Gilman 1981), and it has been sim- ilarly suggested for the Nahal Beer- sheba in a case study of Chalcolithic societies in the northern Negeb (Levy 1981, 1983). The chiefdom model and anthropological perspective pre- sented here, however, clearly shows that the cultural historical models of Albright (1957), Lapp (1970) and others are no longer relevant. To fully explain culture change during the protohistoric period of Palestine, archaeologists will have to examine these periods as part of an evolving social context. In this sense the Chalcolithic period in Palestine wit- nessed some of the most dramatic social changes, the transition from segmentary tribe to chiefdom, in the history of mankind.
