Reviewed by AGEHANANDA BHARATI, Syracuse University Edward Dimock is a scholar's scholar in the orientalist profession. America's foremost authority on Bengali language, literature, and culture, he has published a delightful anthology of Bengali court and village tales and numerous learned articles in orientalist journals. While this book would merit a detailed review in an Indological publication, it contains some material that is of unique interest to cultural anthropologists, both those oriented to the Indian area and the students of religion and ritual in peasant societies. Professor L. Dumont has pointed out time and again that anthropological study in Indic subjects cannot be complete without access to the written tradition of the area. The Vaisiava and Sahajiya cults in Bengal would pose, without such knowledge, a welter of unrelated, incomprehensible episodes and practices; or, at best, an anthropologist un- familiar with the literary background of the move- ment would produce a description on a par, in context and content, with a study of some dance ritual in a nonliterate society. This would obviously be a travesty of the facts; dance plus literature is simply more than dance without literature, and the literary matrix of Indian ritual cannot be dismissed in the most radically synchronic study without slanting the entire situation. The anthropologically relevant thesis of this book is this: an important section of the population of Bengal has been following a religio-ideological tradi- tion inaugurated by Caitanya, a powerful religious charismatic born in the late 15th century. His teach- ings were to a degree anomalous to the Brahmanical traditions of his and earlier times. They stressed the highly personal, the concretely anthropomorphic, hence emotionally accessible divinity of Krs.a, the supreme deity of the universe. The disciplines in- volved derive directly from the bucolic mythology connected with the life story of Krsa, the eighth incarnation of Visnu. It forms the model for the overtly or covertly gymnosophist position of the Vaisnava cult-Krs.a's dalliance with the cowherd- ess Radha epitomizes the eternal play of the cos- mos, but human romance, when properly informed by the cult's training, epitomizes the union of Krsna and Radha. Now though Caitanya himself, very much in line with many of his predecessors and his successors to the sacred profession in India, denied overt sensuousness and taught extreme sex- ual abstention as central to his discipline, the stu- dent of culture and personality, or in fact any psychologically interested anthropologist, recognizes a field of phenomena diffusely present in many societies; Dimock himself points out certain striking similarities with Western forms of Christian mys-</page><page sequence="2">526 American Anthropologist [69, 1967] ticism. But in the case of medieval Bengal, as of modern Bengali religion inasmuch as it perpetuates this specific lore, we have a local precursor to the religious use of sensuality in the Sahajiya cult that is considerably older than the Caitanya movement. Fascinatingly, Dimock traces the relation between the two cults, their oppositional and their inter- meshing elements and phases, and the resultant ambivalence of Bengali devotional life.</page></plain_text>
