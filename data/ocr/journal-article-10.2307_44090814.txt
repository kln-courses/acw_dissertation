Jerusalem 92141 Summary P (Lev 1-16) and H (Lev 17-27) differ sharply in their organization. P's termi- nology is inflexibe and fixed into systems of rituals. H's terminology - many terms the same as P - is flexible and nonritualistic (but not "moral" - Klawans). There- fore H's terminology cannot be organized into systems. Sommaire P (Lv 1 à 16) et H (Lv 17 à 27) diffèrent fortement dans leur organisation. La terminologie de P est rigide et figée dans des systèmes de rites. La terminologie de H, aux termes souvent identiques à ceux de P, est souple et « non ritualistique » (et pas « morale » - Klawans). Ainsi, la terminologie de H ne peut pas être classée en systèmes. In a trenchant essay-review of the methodological assumptions in my Leviticus commentaries , Jonathan Klawans hammers away at my lack of "methodological consistency."1 Specifically, whereas he extols my treat- 1 "Ritual Purity, Moral Purity and Sacrifices in Jacob Milgrom's Leviticus ", Religious Studies Review 29/1 (2003) 19-28.</page><page sequence="2">322 JACOB MILGROM ment of impurities (Lev 11-15) as "sophisticated and sympathetic" he finds that the chapters dealing with sacrifices (Lev 1-10, 16) fall short of this ideal. More strikingly, whereas the sacrificial chapters at least exhibit an inadequate systemization, chapters 17-27 exhibit no system at all! Since my commentaries neglect to distinguish and justify this radical transition, I welcome the opportunity provided by Klawans to make amends for this omission. Sacrifices Klawans' writes: "while Milgrom recognizes that sacrificial rules constitute a system, he denies to that system any real meaning". Surely, Klawans cannot be referring to my in-depth analysis of the expiatory sacrifices, resulting in my 'Dorian Gray' theory for the nKlDFl (chap 4) and the Priestly Doctrine of Repentance for the ŪU7N (Lev 5). 2 Also, he cannot be referring to the (Lev 3), which limits meat for the table to three domestic quadrupeds and bars blood from human diet (3:17)- a prohibition incumbent on all humanity (Gen 9:4) - and represents a symbolic system based on the principle of the inviolability of life.3 Admittedly, the symbolism of the other two sacrifices, the private nVltf and its companion the nn3ft elude me. Their symbolism would complete my surmised generalization for all the sacrifices that they "cover the gamut of the psychological, emotional, and religious needs of the people."4 As of now, I agree with M. F. C. Bourdillon that "sacrifice is a flexible system which can convey a rich variety of possible meanings."5 If there is one overall symbolic system that embraces all the sacrifices, Klawans' desideratum, I relinquish for others to discover. In view of the plethora of references to God's Df!*? 'food' and espe- cially to the existence of a table in the shrine on which bread was regu- larly offered (Lev 24:5-9), Klawans strongly objects to my view that "these words, objects, and mores are only fossilized vestiges ." For support, he cites as evidence the development of the Gilgamesh epic,6 2 J. Milgrom. Leviticus 1-16 (AB3. New York : Doubleday 1991) 254-58, 373-78. 3 Ibid. 718-37. 4 Ibid. 49. 5 M. F. C.

However this analogy has no bearing on the evidence from Leviticus. To be sure, the cande- labrum (light), the incense altar (aroma) and the bread offering (food) clearly reflect the original shrine as God's dining hall. Is that their meaning in the time of P? Or are these also vestiges? It turns out that the table in the shrine is an excellent example of a vestige. As I have pointed out,8 the 1D3H 'libation bowls' were made of gold; they were intended for exclusive use in the shrine toge- ther with all the other cultic objects which were also made of gold. They probably contained a beer offering, alluded in Num 28:7b, and offered on the incense altar. But in P the libation bowls sit empty and idle on the table. Moreover, according to Exodus 30:9, libations are forbidden on the incense altar (an intimation that they once were). Clearly P has made every effort to excise the thought that the God of Israel imbibed food offerings. Furthermore, the bread on God's table was not offered daily but weekly. Being a HÜDE, 'cereal offering,' it required frankincense (Lev 2). But instead of being placed on the bread or mixed with it, the frankincense was set separately on the table so that it alone would be offered on the sacrificial altar. Lastly, the bread, rather than being an altar offering to God, was totally a prebend for the priest. Again the message is clear: The God of Israel requires no food. Thus, ironically, Klawans' parade example of food for the deity - the bread (ün*?) on God's table - turns out to be the parade example of a fossilized vestige . Of course, the question can be asked: Why didn't the priests, once and for all, abolish the offensive ritual of the bread? One might as well ask why the priests didn't eliminate the entire sacrificial system - which also could be interpreted as a means of feeding the deity? One must dis- tinguish between the belief of the elitist priests and the belief of the masses. Regardless of the prohibitions of the former, the latter conti- nued to use the term DPI1?. Moreover, they regarded the sacrificial altar as their personal means of communicating with the deity. To see their offering turned into smoke and rising heavenwards was a sign that God 7 Anderson (n. 6) 1992, 878. 8 J. Milgrom Leviticus 23-27 (AB3b.

Thus, the offering of sacrifices and its concomitant terminology formed the bedrock of Israel's worship. In the chapter entitled "Ritual Impurity"9 and the final summary of his otherwise superb book,10 Klawans unfortunately omits the ritual impurity contracted by touching an impure thing (Lev 5:2), forgetting to fulfill an oath (Lev 5:4) and, especially, defiling (NEID) the sanctuary by inadvertently violating a divine prohibition (Lev 4:1-5:13). Indeed, according to P, all wrongdoing (KDil ) defiles (KOD) the sanctuary (Lev 4, 16), which I have concretized diagrammatically in the Picture of Dorian Grey.11 Moral Impurity While Klawans concedes that my "unsympathetic" treatment of sacri- fice still constitutes a system, he is appalled that "Milgrom treats the second half of Leviticus quite differently. The Holiness Code is allowed to say what it states explicitly - there is no system to the moral impu- rity ideas of Leviticus. Milgrom could be right about one system or the other - but I don't see how he can be right about both. A proper method is a method consistently applied."12 The truth is that H has no systeml And why should it? H is not P. H is the product of a later school of priests bearing a new agenda (ignored by Klawans). The key to this enigma is that H has dissolved the termi- nological precision of P. Perceiving this change makes it possible to penetrate to H's rationale for abandoning a systematic organization of its doctrines. In my commentary, I list 12 examples. Three of them are pertinent to this discussion. 1. P's invariably designates the inner curtains of the tabernacle or, by extension, the structure in which the inner curtains hang (Exod 26:7, 30). H, however, interprets the word metaphorically as the (divine) presence that walks about in Israel's midst (Lev 26:11-12), implying, first, that YHWH is to be found throughout the land and not just in the sanctuary (P's doctrine) and, second, that if Israel observes the divinely revealed commandments it can regain the condition of paradise in which God also "walked about" (Gen 3:8). 9 J.

H fuses and confuses the terms V?n 'desecrate' and KftlD 'defile.' The high priest who is defiled by a corpse pollutes the sanctuary, a far more grievous sin than H's claim that the high priest V?rr 'desecrates' it (Lev 21:12). Similarly, the ordinary priest who eats sacred food in a state of impurity becomes defiled (7:20) not desecrated (22:9). Yet in both cases of defilement H uses the lesser inaccurate term V?n 'dese- crate.' Klawans claims that desecration (V?n) incurred by sexual sins conveys "a permanent degradation of status... the primary legal rami- fication of this degradation being a decrease in marriageability."13 This statement is inaccurate. It applies only to priests (Lev 21: 7, 9). But even in that case, the only consequence, as far as H is concerned, is a decrease in holiness, not marriageability (21: 8). 14 Desecration has lost its specific connotation of damage to a sanctum requiring sacrificial and monetary reparation (Lev 5:14-26). A meta- phor is defined as "a word or phrase that ordinarily designates one thing, is used to designate another"15. Patently, despite Klawans' stre- nuous objection, moral desecration is a metaphor16. The same holds true for moral impurity (see no.3 and throughout). 3. The term NEÜ in P strictly denotes '(ritually) impure,' whereas H employs it metaphorically in nonritualistic contexts, such as adultery (Lev 18:20), sexual violations (18:24), and necromancy (19:31). To be sure, H's metaphoric impurity also bears severe punishment: JTD for individuals and exile for the community17 However, the term KDID no longer denotes the notion of malefic contagion. It is a metaphor. Klawans pays no attention to historically differentiated facts. He fails to distinguish between the two priestly schools that divide the book of Leviticus, P and H. H (chaps 17-27), the product of a later generation of priests, was not content to limit spatial holiness to the sanctuary and its officiants (no. 1, above). H expanded holiness to the land and its Israelite inhabitants. For this to happen, P's symbolic systems had to collapse. The rituals remained but without their symbolic literary pre- cision. 13 Impurity and Sin (n. 9), 34. 14 See J. Milerom Leviticus 17-22. (AB3a.

These two schools are not as distinct from each other, as Klawans avers; namely, that P deals with ritual impurity and H with 'moral' impurity. To be sure, H holds that the punishment for the indi- vidual becoming impure is n ID (e.g. Lev 18:29) and for the community is exile (v. 28). However, it turns out that P is in full agreement with H. P also prescribes TY1D for the individual (Lev 7:20, 21, 27). Moreover, the community's sins ultimately pollute the sanctuary to the degree that God can no longer abide in it. The result is that the community is aban- doned and it falls prey to the enemy. In other words, it too is forced to abandon the land and go into exile. Furthermore, the difference in scope of the sins also narrows. The sins of both P and H comprise 'all the commandments' (Lev 4:2; 26:14). Thus, P also includes moral sins and, conversely, H also includes ritual sins. To be sure, there are several differences. P's sins are limited to prohibitive commandments (nrtfWn xV Lev 4:2), whereas H's sins are prohibitive and, in addition, performative, such as neglecting the tithe, firstlings, and festivals (Lev 27:30-32; 23:9-20, 40-42), The crucial difference lies in the area affected by sin. P restricts it to the sanctuary, whereas H extends the area to include the entire land. The practical difference between the two is that H maintains that the land can be polluted by all who dwell on it, Israelites and aliens alike. Yet here too, P is not entirely different. As the principle of "Dorian Gray" has shown, sins committed anywhere (presumably in the land) pollutes the sanctuary. But a distinction still remains: According to H, God's land is "holy," hence God commands Israel to "become holy" (Lev 19:2). Thus, the burden for holiness rests upon the people, a task that com- prises most of the chapters in H. This thrust cannot be found in P, whose exclusive address is the effect of the people's sins on the sanctuary. Another difference ostensibly remains unchanged. P prescribes puri- fication and atonement; H prescribes neither. In both punishment inexorably follows sin. But here too the nuances should not be over- looked. P's expiatory remedy only applies to the inadvertent sinner; the advertant sinner is barred from the sanctuary. Though H does not dis- tinguish between inadvertence (rQDIti?) and advertence (ļVH), it is clear that H is only addressing the advertent sinner, in which case the punishment in both P and H allows for no expiatory remedy.18 18 The one exception is the accidental homicide (Num 35:22-23), for whom city asylum is provided.</page><page sequence="7">A RESPONSE TO JONATHAN KLAWANS 327 Klawans repeatedly characterizes ritual impurity as "generally natural, unavoidable, not sinful and impermanent."19 However, this holds true only for Lev 12-15. But what of Lev 4:1-5:13, which falls under the rubric 'H 'all of YHWH's commandments' (4:2)? These sins are neither natural nor unavoidable and - in the case of the brazen sinner - may not even be impermanent.20 Furthermore, contra Klawans,21 grave (moral) sins (G^UJD) defile the adytum ritually (Lev 16:16, 21). Moral sins include inadvertent 'moral' sins (violations of 'H DISE *?D, Lev 4:2) that defile the sacrificial altar (4:22-35) or the shrine (w.3-21). These sins, however, generate ritual impurity. Thus, the term 'moral' for the exclusive description of non- ritual sin is more than "imperfect";22 it is erroneous and misleading. Referring to Ezra 9, Klawans writes: "If ritual impurity were the concern, we would see some possibility of ritual purification, but this is not the case."23 This assertion is vitiated by a single verse in the follo- wing chapter: Ezra 10:19. It reads: CTQtWO OiTlM K^nnV DV Dim 'they agreed to put away their wives; their reparation DnOttJriK"1?}? offering (reading □QttJN'l) was a ram from the flock for their offense.' Note: 1. This verse speaks explicitly of ritual purification . 2. As in Lev 5:14-16(P) the GUJX reparation offering is brought for 'desecration' (Ezra 9:4; 10:6; c.f. 10:2, 10). 3. In Ezra's halakhic midrash,24 all of Israel is a sanctum. Therefore, all exogamous unions are interdicted; Israel, tfnpn ÎTIÎ 'the holy seed' (Ezra 9:2), has been desecrated. Because the intermarriages were contracted inadvertently (the requirement of Lev 5:15) - Israel having been unaware of Ezra's midrash - their dissolution must be followed by an ÜU7X offering. 19 Impurity (n. 9) 23, 38, 40 inter alia. 20 Unless the high priest intervenes on Yom Kippur, Lev 16:16, 21. 21 And contra A.

This process is explicitly called purification, D^mnoi 'I purify them' (Neh 13:30). Thus, there can be no doubt that Ezra's measures for purifying his people from the offense of intermarriage constitutes a quintessential example of the purification of ritual impurity.25 On the other hand, Ezra also uses language expressing nonritual impurity in the very same case pK nntZTI1? CTKD OTK "I m pan DDKDID3 HET^K ÍTM im orrramra niTTKn TO7 maa niD 'The land which you are about to enter to take possession of it is a land unclean through the uncleanness of the peoples of the land, through their abominable practices with which they, in their impurity , have filled it from one end to the other' (Ezra 9:11b). The term m 3 'mens- trual impurity' is used metaphorically to describe the unclean land and some of the local and surrounding peoples. The metaphoric usage of ni3 is not Ezra's innovation; it is H's coinage (Lev 20:21). Whereas H uses it to describe a single sexual violation, Ezra applies it sweepingly as an image of the uncleanness of Israel's land and some other peoples. The term HXQU 'impurity' is also used by Ezra, not in its specific ritual sense but in a nonritual, indeed, metaphoric sense to designate the ido- latry and other unacceptable practices of foreigners (see also Ezra 6:21). Above all, it is important to note that the same sin, intermarriage, pos- sesses both ritual impurity and nonritual (Klawans' 'moral') impurity. It defies logic to hold that both can simultaneously be specific. One of the impurities must give way. Ritual purity is certain; it must be expiated by sacrifice. This means that 'moral' impurity here is unspecific, in other words, metaphoric. In sum, P's terminology is inflexibly fixed, whereas H has turned the same terminology into flexible, nonritualist (but not 'moral') concepts. This revolutionary disparity is fully comprehensible. P's terminology is pinned down to a ritual system. H, however, has released P's termino- logy from its ritual mooring. As a result, the same term KEti betrays both usages in H (no. 3 above), even in the same chapter (e.g. 18:19 and 18:30), a process that also holds for H13 (18:19; 20:21). Thus, it causes no surprise that Ezra also employs both ritual and nonritual impurity (confusingly) in the same case (Ezra 9:11; 10:19). But Ezra is no innovator; he relies on his precedent, H. 25 Or ritual desecration. Israel is a desecrated sanctum expiable by an DUftt, not a gene- rator of impurity expiable by a nNDn. The important fact, however, is that the sin of inter- marriage is resolved by a ritual and not by nonritualistic 'moral' means.</page><page sequence="9">A RESPONSE TO JONATHAN KLAWANS 329 Moreover, the terms HHO and V?n, on occasion, are actually homoge- nized into a single concept of desecration (no. 2, above); V?n is used for KDID (21:12; 22:9) and KDÜ for V?n (20:3). Therefore, one cannot say, with Klawans, that at Qumran for the first time "ritual and moral impu- rity were melded into a single conception of defilement."26 The origins of this phenomenon are traceable a half century earlier, to the genera- tion of priestly 'young turks,' who broke away from their rootage in the sanctuary rituals and applied their terminology to embrace all the people and the land. They could not have realized how long their achie- vement would last. But once the Temple was destroyed, the charge to holiness remained, and the terminology that hitherto only applied to the sanctuary and its priestly officiants now affected all of Israel. 26 Impurity (n. 8) 90; cf. 75, 88, 150.</page></plain_text>
