      <p>Two factors made the South Pacific appear a promising field for British missionary activity in the early nineteenth century. One was the voyages of Captain Cook (and the brutal manner of his death); the other was the view that this seemingly paradisaical region—blessed with a balmy climate and all the “manifold bounty of Providence” (157)—was even so the home of “heathen” savagery. The London Missionary Society (LMS), the focus of Sujit Sivasundaram's far‐ranging discussion of missionary activity in the Pacific, sought to capitalize on Cook's legacy, seeing his discoveries as having “set the stage for a divine ordained plan of mission work” (123). In the missionaries' view, Cook's death revealed not just the savagery of “cannibals” but also the navigator's folly in allowing himself to be revered as a god, and they contrasted his irreligious presumption with the superior martyrdom that befell the missionary John Williams at Eromanga in 1839. While Cook and his “godless” companions were content to observe the islands and the Polynesian way of life, the LMS determined to transform the “nature” inherent in both the physical and the moral landscapes. The natural abundance of the islands, which appeared to afford the inhabitants effortless subsistence, was seen as encouraging indolence and vice and so requiring the civilizing, Christianizing stimulus of “improved” agriculture and a plantation economy. Nature as such was insufficient: it was necessary to master or rise above it—through sound agronomy, through the separation of nature from religion, even through those requirements of dress that obliged converted islanders to forsake the flowers in their hair for European hats and bonnets.</p>
      <p>By focusing on the work of the LMS (and relating it, on the one hand, to contemporary trends in British society and, on the other, to the local interaction between missionaries and islanders), Sivasundaram tellingly illustrates the missionaries' complex discursive engagement with the Pacific and its mediation through intersecting ideas of religion, civilization, and science. Far from science having superseded religion, he argues, evangelical missionaries developed “an alternative theology of nature” (6), and his book is largely devoted to showing how—and, to some extent, why—this was done. For LMS missionaries, whose origins were relatively humble (artisans, servants, petty shopkeepers), familiarity with scientific ideas and terminology was, he suggests, one way of charting their own improvement and assimilation into British middle‐class society. Natural imagery, drawn from scripture, culled from agriculture or from gardening, came readily to mind—as when William Pascoe Crook claimed, “Education is to mankind what culture [i.e., cultivation] is to vegetables,” helpfully adding, “If this is neglected the Garden is overrun with noxious weeds; if that is forgotten the manners of men degenerate into vice and profaneness” (58). If the beaver symbolized praiseworthy industry, the sloth epitomized sinful lethargy. Similar anthropomorphic analogies were used—in mission circles as much as among island audiences—to enforce homilies and underscore human weakness, to naturalize Christianity while confounding Polynesian “superstition” or supplanting mere nature gods with a more abstract theology. Metaphor was an approved missionary technique, used not just to invite comparison but also to reveal deeper meaning.</p>
      <p>While some missionary metaphors drew directly from contemporary science, others (perhaps inadvertently) replicated the islanders' own pattern of thought. One of the vital themes that pervades Sivasundaram's monograph is an idea of visibility in the service of the missionaries' “civilizing mission.” Nature, real or imagined, was one of the essential ways by which missionaries sought to impress their goals and achievements on themselves and others—as through the several depictions of Williams's martyrdom (and the landscape of savagery and redemption in which it was represented) or through inviting vignettes of shining white chapels and orderly mission stations intended to prove, if only to distant backers, that evangelism was indeed reaping rewards, though the transformation of the physical landscape was also a “didactic lesson” directed at the islanders themselves (175). The power of making faith (and the effects of faith) visible extended to the display of objects in missionary museums. Here, exhibited for the visitors' instruction, was the evidence of gods abandoned, vile practices shed, and the transformation of a material culture once indebted to nature by one founded on industry.</p>

         <italic>Nature and the Godly Empire</italic> offers rich insights into missionary discourse and the metaphorical deployment of nature in an extra‐Europe context, but it does not always realize the potential implicit in its overarching themes. Sivasundaram's discussion, modeled on his earlier PhD dissertation, is largely drawn from the writings of the LMS missionaries themselves, with only occasional alternative perspectives from critical outsiders, such as Herman Melville. Sivasundaram certainly seeks escape from the discursive world of the missionaries in order to construct “an account of knowledge from below” (13). He is certainly able to establish that the islanders “did not submit without resistance”—whether to the missionaries' new notions of property or to the “altered relationship with nature” the evangelicals sought to bring about (199). But, given the apparent paucity of material on Polynesian responses to the missionaries, this remains a secondary, rather muted, voice. It is a pity, too, that Sivasundaram scarcely considers the work of Jean and John Comaroff and Catherine Hall (on South Africa and Jamaica, respectively), for there appear to be many fruitful comparisons, as in the rather archaic importance attached to agriculture as a manifestation of Christian civilization and—in the Caribbean case, at least—in the subsequent disillusionment with this by midcentury. Like several recent writers, Sivasundaram is understandably skeptical of any simple conflation of missionaries and empire (though he leaves us with no clear indication of how that ambivalent relationship is to be understood). He argues, rather, for the variety of mission mind‐sets and experience but also for the rhetoric of a shared humanity—in which all human souls, whether in inner‐city Britain or Pacific island idylls, need to be saved, and can be saved (whatever an emerging racial science might suggest), through evangelization. Again, although “science” is repeatedly invoked, in the main it is popular science and commonplace ideas of nature that are referred to. Seldom, except in the case of coral reefs, is it the kind of science that requires much specialized knowledge of botany or geology. Such ethnography as there is seems superficial: medicine receives hardly a mention. As a result, the missionaries' ability to engage with science seems barely tested.</p>
