<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTS FOR 1973-74 ARCHAEOLOGY IN CENTRAL ITALY AND ETRURIA, 1968-73 The high point of the quinquennium 1962-67, reviewed in AR 1967-68 29-45, was undoubtedly the discovery of the inscribed tablets at Pyrgi in 1964. Their importance, which continues to attract comment and exegesis, resides not in the fact that they are made of gold but in their status as a con- temporary historical document found in its proper historical context. In the quinquennium 1968-73, it would be invidious to single out one individual discovery: in the following pages I have endeavoured to reflect the progressive broadening and deepening interest in the non-funerary archaeology of the Etruscans and of their Italic neighbours, and the increasing relevance of both to the ancient historian. In the period under review, new place-names have become household words: one thinks of Gravisca, the port of Tarquinia, which has yielded the first tangible evidence for resident Greeks in Etruria from c. 580; and of the provincial sanctuary of Poggio Civitate (Siena), which provides a sequence, still open at the earlier end, of evidence for typical archaic life and architecture-as distinct from mere 'treasure'. Nor is 'sanctuary archaeology', in Southern Etruria, Tuscany and Etruria Padana, the only productive new trend. On a wide variety of fronts, new and fundamental discoveries mean that basic assumptions are being questioned as never before: the identity, at the stylistic and technical levels, of the primary evidence-of what is, and of what is not, Etruscan-is being established with greater precision; at the same time, the Etruscans' Italic contemporaries, and the protohistoric ancestors of both, are attracting constructive attention that is long overdue. Indeed, as it becomes apparent that Etruscology as a closed shop is a thing of the past, so new elements provide compelling reasons for a positive re-assessment of the role of Etruria and Central Italy in the history of the contemporary Mediterranean as a whole: the commercial signifi- cance of Gravisca, the sheer volume and sophistica- tion of the evidence from the allegedly minor centre of Poggio Civitate, the unexpected flowering of art and taste at Campovalano in the sixth century, the no less unexpected brilliance of the Orientalising tombs at San Severino Marche-and so on. This report is even more inadequate, and uneven, than its predecessor. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the renewed generosity of my Italian colleagues,1 marred only by the continued decline in the speed of the postal service between Italy and the United Kingdom since the Roman withdrawal.2 The quantity and the quality of the information supplied to me have combined to impose a painful need for selection. I have chosen to say more about fewer sites in the hope that non-combatants who become acquainted with these will be stimulated and enabled to find out more about the rest for themselves. The tone of general Etruscan works in English has been raised considerably by the appearance of translations of the text-books by Professors Luisa Banti and Massimo Pallottino." In the 'Notes on Further Reading' appended (pp. 294-300) to the latter, I have endeavoured to guide students and others to the impressive number of recent editiones principes and of detailed treatments of specific classes of Etruscan and Italic material. These mainly take the form of additions (up to 1973) to the various monograph series mentioned in AR 1967-68 29 f.; with few exceptions, these indications are not repeated here.4 All recent attempts at haute vulgarisation are out- shone by a beautifully illustrated description of the sites of Northern and Southern Etruria, written by three young research workers from Rome and Pisa. Their text is a highly competent distillation of knowledge old and new, and contains the first reliable mention of a number of sites and subjects to appear outside the specialist journals.5 Meanwhile, 1 Suppliers of information and photographs concerning specific areas and sites are thanked individually; for advice, books, discussion, offprints and practical help I am additionally indebted to: G.

Pre- pared by Professors Camporeale, Colonna and Cristofani, this includes a review of the activities, including exhibitions, of institutions in Italy and abroad (439-60); there is an impressive and in- valuable classified bibliography, 1971-72 (461-503); and an account of discoveries and excavations, 1971- 72, in Latium, Tuscany, Umbria, the Marche and the Abruzzi (505-54). The area covered by the latter subsection coincides very largely with that of the present report: and I am extremely grateful to Professor Colonna for giving me a copy of his text before it was published. I have made extensive use of it in the pages that follow: and I urge readers to turn to Professor Colonna's much fuller and more authoritative account of work in progress on many of the sites mentioned (cited below as 'Notiziario', and not to be confused with NSc). Another innova. tion in the same number of StEtr is the 'Rivista di Epigrafia Italica', 363-409, which joins the long established 'Rivista di Epigrafia Etrusca', ibid. 269-362. THE ABRUZZI: Soprintendenza alle Antichitca degli Abruzzi, Museo Nazionale, I-6600oo CHIETI. Superintendent: Dr V. Santamaria Scrinari. Noti- ziario 512-14, pl. xcV. The former 'Abruzzo e Molise' Soprintendenza has now been bisected: the new Molise territory is therefore treated separately. Excavations in the cemetery at Campovalano near Campli (Teramo), begun in 1965 by the former Superintendent, Dr Cianfarani, have continued. In 1969, some of the more remarkable finds from the site formed part of a memorable exhibition in Rome.7 In 1971 and 1972, a further 55 tombs were excavated, bringing the total to I 70. Most of them are of the sixth century: there are a few modest representatives of the fourth-third centuries and even later; one tomb and some sporadic material appear to be as early as the ninth-eighth centuries. The sixth- century material is extraordinary. The distinctive pottery forms (Fig. I) are notable for the elegant stylisation of their incised and applied human figures, real and mythical animals, and other motifs. Arms FIG. I and armour abound: they include swords and daggers of iron inlaid with ivory. The quantity of bronze vessels (Fig. 2) recalls the richer Etruscan cemeteries; they display an almost Celtic preoccupa- tion with the mixing, straining (Fig. 3) and drinking of wine. The eastern Italic peoples-conventionally regarded as backward mountain folk-who descended on the coastal plains in the fifth century are thus seen to have unexpectedly refined cultural antecedents. A typical feature of the local armour is the disc cuirass.8 Examples have not hitherto been found outside the Abruzzi and the Marche, although a representation appears on a painted slab (of doubtful authenticity) alleged to have been found near Cerveteri.9 Now, however, a pair from Aleria (Corsica), complete with iron belt, has been published by J. and L. Jehasse:10 they were found in a tomb rich in other military equipment and dated c. 470. It is tempting to see this interesting tomb- group as the property of a Sabellian mercenary, recruited in Campania, who followed his companions to Corsica after the battle of Cumae in 474; Pro- fessor Colonna has suggested a similar interpretation for the well-known 'Hercules of Posada' (Nuoro, Sardinia),11 made in the first half of the fifth century and near to his 'Tiriolo' Group of Sabellic votive bronzes. 6 D.

This 'all purpose' Soprintendenza came into being on IstJanuary 1971, and has already undertaken an impressive programme of fieldwork and publication.14 A series of Documenti di Antichitd Italiche e Romane, published in collaboration with the Abruzzi Soprint- endenza, is particularly welcome.

Forthcoming: (2) M. Matteini Chiari, Lucerne antiche. In Documenti 5, Dr De Benedittis publishes the results of his recent fieldwork in the area of Monte Vairano (Campobasso). He provides a plan of a large oppidum, girdled by impressive Samnite walls and similar in that and in other respects to the oppidum studied by Professor Colonna at Saepinum (Sepino Terravecchia).15 Dr De Benedittis proposes to identify the Monte Vairano site with the Adeanales of the Peutinger Table,16 ii miles from Bovianum in the direction of Larinum. Material from the site includes a new member (Fig. 4) of Professor Colonna's 'Bari' Group.1" At Campochiaro (Campobasso), Dr D. Spina has found what appears to be a new sanctuary site. Surface finds include stone and terra-cotta archi- tectural fragments, and tiles with Oscan stamps. The history of the site is probably comparable with that of Pietrabbondante: its proximity to Bovianum and to the Aesernia-Beneventum road suggests that the new sanctuary was of considerable importance. Preliminary excavations are planned for the near future. Excavations at Pietrabbondante itself (AR 1967-68 31 f.) have uncovered all the foundations of the large temple behind the theatre (Temple B): they are made of squared limestone blocks with Oscan mason's marks. The ground plan of the temple is now complete;18 it measures 19'25 X 28-87 m., which corresponds exactly to 75 X 105 Oscan feet. Work continues on the graphic reconstruction of the elevation of this remarkable Italic-Hellenistic build- ing. The portico area on the right of the temple has also been excavated; it is symmetrical to the one on the left. Soundings between the temple and the theatre have revealed evidence of an earlier (third century) phase, the violent end of which should be attributed to the Hannibalic war. In addition, soundings between the sanctuary and Monte Saraceno 12 Cianfarani, Culture adriatiche cit., 147 ff., 153 f., pl. M, figs. 164 f.; A.

ROME AND LATIUM: in 1973, the Assessorato Antichita, Belle Arti e Problemi della Cultura of the City of Rome organised a magnificent exhibition19 at the Antiquarium Comunale. It contained finds old and new, and was designed to illustrate various aspects of Rome, Latium vetus and the colonies in the fifth and fourth centuries-the relatively neglected post-Etruscan period that lasted from the capture of Veii to the end of the Second Punic War. Mean- while, the last two volumes of Professor Einar Gjerstad's monolithic series Early Rome have appeared under the auspices of the Swedish Institute: v, The Written Sources and vi, Historical Survey (both Lund, 1973). The latter is a final synthesis of the .archaeological and literary evidence published in the previous five volumes and in various minor papers.20 The first parts of an even more ambitious project have appeared in the period under review: Aufstieg und Niedgrgang der rimischen Welt, the Fests- chrift for Professor Joseph Vogt (ed. H. Temporini; Berlin-New York: de Gruyter, 1972- ). The final total of contributors will exceed 500: the survey 19 Catalogue: Roma medio-repubblicana (Rome: SPQR, I973). 20 For Gjerstad and other Swedes, see A. Hedvall 'Index of publications' and R. Haigg 'Italy and Rome' in Swedish Arch- aeological Bibliography 1966-1970 (1972) 249-318 passim and 202-24. FIG. 4 articles in the parts so far available contain much that is relevant to students of early Rome and the pre-Roman archaeology of the adjacent areas. There is much of permanent value, too, in La Magna Grecia e Roma nell'eta arcaica = Atti dell' VIII' Convegno di Studi sulla Magna Grecia, Taranto 1968 (Naples, 1969). Last but by no means least, a modern account of the contents of the museums of Rome has appeared in the form of a revised edition of W. Helbig's invaluable Fiihrer.21 Outside Rome, soundings at Castel di Decima 18 km. to the south were undertaken in 1971 by the Soprintendenza alle Antichit" di Ostia; they were occasioned by the proposed widening of the Via Pontina (SS 148). During the original construction of this road in 1953, a number of tombs were damaged and the area has since been kept under observation by members of the Istituto di Topografia Antica.22 Four tombs, two intact, were found in 1971. In the spring of 1972, therefore, the systematic and continuous excavation of the cemetery was begun and is still in progress; in 1973 the Soprintendenza alle Antichith di Roma began work in that part of the cemetery which falls within its territory.23 At the time of writing 115 fossa tombs (some covered with stones) have been excavated (Fig. 5)-almost all of them previously undisturbed. The earliest may be assigned to the second half of the eighth century (not earlier than 740-20), the majority to the first half of the seventh and the latest to the third/fourth quarters of the same century. Four tombs contained chariots. Of these, tomb 15 is dated to the last quarter of the eighth century by a late EPC aryballos (Fig. 6) and two late Thapsos cups without panel;24 it also contained various personal ornaments of silver and bone, an iron sword, bronze tripods and bowls and many impasto vases, including a spiral amphora (Fig. 7) and Faliscan kantharoi. Tomb 21, which is un- likely to be later than c. 730, contained three bronze shields with repouss6 ornament as well as the chariot, many other bronzes and much fine impasto pottery; tomb 50 was also rich in metal (including bronze and iron antenna swords) and pottery, and is dated to the first half of the seventh century. The fourth chariot burial, tomb IoI, of the late eighth-early seventh century, is that of a woman buried in a robe sewn with carved amber and glass beads, with a gold and amber pectoral and gold spiral hair-rings. The appearance of these and other outstanding 'princely' or 'warrior' tombs in Latium accords well with the picture that is emerging from Orientalising 21 Fiihrer durch die iffentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertiimer in Rom (Tiibingen: Wasmuth/DAI): i (1963) Musei Vaticani; ii (1966) Musei Capitolini, etc.; iii (1969) 466-862, Villa Giulia; iv (1972) Museo Ostiense, etc. 22 S.

The social differentiation26 that is visible in the Decima tomb-groups implies a distinctly urban character in the related settlement, on Monte Cicoriaro: and it is difficult not to link this, and indeed the 'heroic'-Homeric ?-aspects of the cemetery itself, with the arrival of the first Western Greeks at Pithekoussai in the first half of the eighth century."2 In this respect, it is relevant to note here that Dr Eugenio La Rocca will shortly publish the painted Geometric sherds from the soundings carried out in the 'sixties in the sacred area of Sant'Omobono, Rome.28 In the opinion of Dr Giorgio Buchner, a significant number of the Sant'Omobono sherds are from vases made at Pithekoussai in the LG I (= pre-EPC) period there. Meanwhile, the discovery of a rich Middle/Late Orientalizing cemetery at Castel di Decima inevitably recalls Nibby's location there of Politorium-a Latin town which, along with Ficana and Tellenae, was conquered by Ancus Marcius prior to his foundation of Ostia.29 Ancus Marcius' traditional (Varro) dates are 640-616: so far, no material later than c. 6oo has been found in the Decima cemetery. The traditional account of Rome's expansion to the south and south-west in the second half of the seventh century is further confirmed by the secure identification of Ficana on Monte Cugno (rather than I1 km. west at Casale Dragoncello: Gell, Nibby, Tilly, etc.), near the modern hamlet of Acilia,30 and by the subsequent discovery of what is in all probability its cemetery.31 Forty tombs have so far been identified, and first impressions suggest that this cemetery is similar in character and date to that of Castel di Decima. In addition, some of the material collected by Dr Quilici Gigli on the Monte Cugno site appears to be of Bronze Age date; and a Late Bronze Age anchor of Phlegraean tufa has recently been found off the coast near Castel Porziano.32 The Istituto di Topografia Antica of Rome University has continued to excavate at Lavinium (modern Pratica di Mare); work is in hand on the definitive publication, of which the first volume has 25 I.

This took the form, firstly, of a tumulus containing a ,tomba a cassone' (point 3 on Fig. 8) with abundant mid-seventh century Orientalising material, includ- ing more than sixty vases in and around it; the presence of a bucchero pesante oinochoe suggests later interest in the tomb, presumably for cult purposes, in the sixth century-to which the earliest of the nearby altars can also be assigned. At the end of the fourth century, the tumulus was renewed (outer limit: point 2), and incorporated a shrine (point I) which yielded numerous miniature vases. The finished product tallies remarkably well with Dionysius' reference to a xw)4odTov 0o 1dya constructed in memory of Aeneas by the Latins after their battle with the Rutuli-fought o3 Qpd6ow toiT Aaovrviov.35 Interesting sporadic material ranging in date from the Late Bronze to the Early Iron Ages has also been collected in the area, and published;31 and, in October 1973, thirty-four tombs (late tenth-early eighth centuries) were excavated west-south-west of the archaic centre. In addition to its excavations, the Istituto di Topografia Antica has continued to produce volumes in the Forma Italiae series (Rome: De Luca). The following have appeared in the period under review: P. Brandizzi Vittucci, Cora (1968); M. Mazzolani, Anagnia (1969); C. F. Giuliani, Tibur i (1970); S. Quilici Gigli, Tuscana (1970); M. P. Muzzioli, Praeneste ii (1970); G. M. De Rossi, Apiolae (1970); P. A. Gianfrotta, Castrum Novum (1972); L. Quilici, Collatia (1974). In the same series, G. F. Gamurrini, A. Cozza, A. Pasqui, R. Mengarelli, Carta archeo- logica d'Italia (188r-1897) : materiali per l'Etruria e la Sabina (1972) is a particularly valuable edition of raw material-not all of it still extant-collected towards the end of the last century. New light on perhaps the most elusive of early Rome's neighbours is meanwhile being shed at Colle del Forno (Montelibretti) in Sabine territory, 29 km. north-east of Rome. Here building work on a research centre for the CNR (the Italian National Re- search Council) revealed an important cemetery, con- ceivably that of Eretum; subsequent rescue excavation by the CNR's own Centro di studio per l'archeologia etrusco-italica is in progress, under the direction of Dr P. Santoro; on completion, it is planned to preserve the site and incorporate it in the modern complex. The contents of the first twelve chamber tombs, other material found in 'Sabina tiberina' in the last century (Poggio Sommavilla: now in Florence FIG. 8 and Copenhagen), together with comparanda from the other side of the Tiber (Capena) and from the Middle Adriatic (Campovalano: see above, p. 43) were exhibited in the Palazzo delle Scienze, Rome in 1973.37 In appearance, the Colle del Forno tombs and their dromoi resemble those of the Capena and Faliscan cemeteries; they are dated from the last quarter of the seventh to the first half of the sixth century, and their contents may be aligned with Colonna's phase IVB in Rome.38 Parallels for individual pieces have been sought in the Faliscan area, in Southern Etruria, Rome and Latium generally and in the Middle Adriatic area (for the amber and weapons): the site has easy access to the natural arteries of trade constituted by the future Via Salaria and of course by the Tiber itself. There can be no doubt that the occupants of the Colle del Forno tombs were authentic Sabines: and this dis- covery adds greatly to our exiguous knowledge of the material culture of the Sabine territory in the period of its legendary connection with Rome. Futher developments are eagerly awaited.39 SOUTHERN ETRURIA: Soprintendenza alle Anti- chita dell'Etruria Meridionale, Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia, Valle Giulia, I-ooi96 ROMA.

An admir- able conspectus of work in progress in Southern Etruria was provided by an exhibition organised in 1970 at Viterbo by the Soprintendenza and the Comitato per le attivith archeologiche nella Tuscia.40 Although its contents were predominantly Etruscan, they in fact ranged in date from Beakers to numis- matic evidence for the passage of Alaric. At Veii, the British School and the Istituto di Etruscologia of Rome University have continued excavation in the Villanovan cemetery of Quattro Fontanili (AR 1967-68 35). Two further instal- ments of the systematic publication have appeared: NSc (1970) 178-329; ibid. (1972) 195-384. The latter covers the five campaigns (i th to I5th) conducted between 1967 and 1969. Since then, four summer seasons in 1970-73 and two autumn seasons in 1971 and 1972 have yielded eighty-six more tombs; finds include new 'Cycladic cups' (cf. AR 1966-67 30), other painted pottery and a complete gold sanguisuga fibula. Several more squares in the disturbed 'zona di recupero' have also been cleared.41 A skyphos from the latter zone, published in 1963, has at last been recognised as a unique example of the notoriously elusive (in the West) Euboean MG 'pendent semicircle' class.42 In the School's series of topographical studies in Southern Etruria, the volume on the Ager Veientanus north and east of Veii (PBSR xxxvi [i968]) supple- ments the earlier account of the city itself. The late Mrs Murray Threipland and Professor Torelli have published the results of the rescue excavation in a semi-subterranean Etruscan building at Casale Pian Roseto, mentioned in the last report (ibid. xxxviii [197o] 62-121). A slightly earlier deposit of votive pottery, probably datable to the end of the first quarter of the fifth century, has also been published by Mrs Murray Threipland (ibid. xxxvii [19691 1-13). It was found just to the east of the contrada Campetti, where Professor Pallottino excavated a massive deposit of votive terra-cottas in 1938: these range from the late sixth to the early first centuries and are the subject of L. Vagnetti, II deposito votivo di Campetti a Veio (Florence: Sansoni, 197i), which provides much valuable information about successive artistic tastes at Veii. At Cerveteri, the Soprintendenza has carried out a number of rescue excavations in the Sorbo, Castel Dannato, Monte Abatone, Banditaccia and other areas. At Ceri (Le Fornaci), near Cerveteri, a pair of remarkable sculptured seated figures was found in a Middle Orientalising tomb in 1971: they bear further witness to the activity of oriental artists in the area. Not far away, at Casaletti di Ceri, an early Etruscan inscription has been found in a well- dated context: a tomb containing a 'Cumae Group' oinochoe, an EPC deep kotyle and six skyphoi, and a 'Rhodian' aryballos43-a combination that, like Castel di Decima tomb 15 (q.v.), recalls Pithekoussai and suggests a date in the region of 7oo-690. At Pyrgi (AR 1967-68 36-9), the port of Etruscan Cerveteri, the tenth and eleventh campaigns in the sanctuary were conducted by the Istituto di Etrusco- logia in 1970 and 1971; they were directed overall by Professor Pallottino and in the field by Professor Colonna, and were preceded by soundings in 1969.44 The latter were intended to facilitate the erection of some form of protective covering for the site; in the event, they led to the discovery and excavation of a well at the south corner of Temple A. A second well, at the west corner, was excavated in 1970; like the first, it contained material datable in general terms to the fourth and third centuries. This included fragments of architectural terra-cottas of the 'Third Phase', a few votive pieces and (from the south corner) a small hoard of bronze coins and a unique bronze simpulum,45 with an incised Gorgon- Silenus head and an inscription. Fragments of wood, seeds and bones were also found: restoration and analysis are in progress. Excavation was also carried out on the west and south sides of Temple B, and at the entrance of the road from Cerveteri to the sanctuary. In the latter area, two phases were distinguished, involving a change in the orientation and point of access: in the later phase, there must have been a gateway with a small propylon. In his account of the Cerveteri-Pyrgi road46 Pro- fessor Colonna referred briefly to the discovery, in 1967, of three damaged tombs in two zones (A and B) at Quarto di Monte Bischero, about 4 km. inland from the sanctuary: they date from the first half of the sixth century, and the two tombs in zone B are demonstrably later than the road. It has since become clear that some of the material found in and around the tomb in zone A is not funerary: a number of fire-stands, perhaps some of the coarse pottery and two tuyeres47-apparently the first found, or at least recognised, in Etruria. A fourth tomb in zone A was explored in 1968: it produced frag- ments of a 'Tyrrhenian amphora' and other Attic bf together with a substantial quantity of Hellenistic pottery, representing re-use of the tomb. The Quarto di Monte Bischero tombs are being prepared for publication in the third instalment of the definitive Pyrgi report, in NSc, by Dr F. R. Serra Ridgway. The second definitive report was published in 1973: Pyrgi-Scavi nel santuario etrusco (1959-1967)-= II Suppl.

In addition, a new interpretation of the well-known high-relief from the back pediment of Temple A has been proposed by Professor Paribeni, and is confirmed by restoration.48 It is now generally accepted that the scene portrayed is not from a Gigantomachia but from the Theban Cycle: Tydeus gnaws the head of the dying Melanippus, as Athena recoils in disgust; Zeus smites the arrogant Capaneus. Discussion of the Pyrgi tablets has also continued.49 The Temple A pediment and many other finds, including some from the wells mentioned above, are displayed in the revised 'Pyrgi Room' in the Villa Giulia. An Antiquarium near the site itself was opened in October I972: it contains an excellent didactic selection of mounted architectural terra- cottas, other finds, photographs, drawn reconstruc- tions and detailed explanatory panels. Intending visitors should take the minor road to the Castello, off the Via Aurelia just outside the resort of Santa Severa; there is a resident custodian. In 1971, parts of the painted walls of certain tombs at Tarquinia were stolen: the Tombe delle Iscrizioni, del Frontoncino and 2327.50 Most of the stolen sections were later recovered-naturally in a damaged condition-by the Carabinieri. An un- successful attempt to steal part of the decoration of the second century Tomba del Convegno, discovered in 1970, resulted in the partial destruction of the (unpublished) painted inscriptions in it. Mean- while, other newly discovered painted tombs are being prepared for publication by Dr Moretti.51 They include an exceptionally interesting tomb found in 1971, decorated on the short sides only with red and black line drawings of Etrusco-Corinthian animals; this is the earliest tomb at Tarquinia with figured representation. An important Orientalizing tomb was emptied in 1972 above Poggio Gallinaro: it resembles the well-known Avvolta tomb, and contained Protocorinthian, Italo-Geometric and much fine bucchero (including five unusual figurines). Reference was made in AR 1967-68 40 to the Tombe degli Anina and degli Spitu, in the Hellenistic Villa Tarantola cemetery excavated by the Lerici Founda- tion (1963-64) on land belonging to the Scataglini family. The definitive publication of this site is now in an active state of advanced preparation by R. E. Linington, M. Moretti and F. R. Serra Ridgway. This part of the cemetery consists of about 120 chamber tombs, mostly ranging in date between the fourth and second centuries, but also including some material as late as the middle of the first century A.D. In addition to its many other activities, the Comitato per le attiviti archeologiche nella Tuscia appointed a 'Commissione per i Parchi Archeologici' in 1969. The Commission's first project was the preparation of detailed proposals for the constitution of an 'Archaeological Natural Park' at Tarquinia, involving an area of approximately i i,ooo hectares.52 Similar proposals are now being prepared for Veii and Cerveteri: and it is very much to be hoped that a satisfactory legal formula for putting the proposals into effect will emerge from the various national, regional and local authorities affected. Between 1965 and 1973, the Lerici Foundation conducted seven large-scale magnetic survey campaigns, cover- ing roughly 40 hectares on Pian di Civita as far as the Ara della Regina. Processing of the immense quantity of data thus obtained is still in progress: the plan of the ancient city of Tarquinia has been revealed in general terms of roads and built-up areas, and in some cases the plans of even single buildings are clearly visible in detail. On the coast nearby, Professor Mario Torelli began excavations at Gravisca in 1969, and has continued to direct operations there on behalf of the Soprintendenza since his translation to the University of Cagliari in I970. 5 The first campaign was devoted to the town plan of the Roman colony (181 B.C.), already established in some detail by aerial photography ;54 since 1970, work has been concentrated in the adjacent area. Here, excavation has revealed the hitherto unsuspected presence of a sanctuary, Greek from the beginning of the sixth until the first decades of the fifth century, and then Etruscan until the end of the third century. Although the phe- nomenon must have begun much earlier, the remarkable fact remains that this excavation has provided the first tangible evidence of resident Greeks in Etruria from c. 58o onwards. Soundings in the colony and surrounding area have in addition established that Gravisca was the port of Etruscan Tarquinia from the beginning of the sixth century, and that it then covered an area larger than that of the later Roman site: sixth-third century tombs have been found along the Tarquinia road to the east (Fontanile della Vipera) and along the coast road to the south (Saline). Roughly Iooo square metres of the sanctuary, within the limits of the Etruscan town, have so far been investigated; three Etruscan cult buildings have been found. The earlier (Greek) cult area appears to lie within the limits of the later (Etruscan) one, although the remains of the Greek walls are exiguous in the extreme. Nevertheless, the evidence of foundation trenches suggests the presence of small cells with foundation courses of dry stone or pebble and unbaked brick above; no architectural terra- cottas can be assigned to the Greek period. By contrast, these pre-Etruscan levels have yielded an unprecedented quantity-for Etruria--of Greek votive pottery and inscriptions. 48 E. Paribeni, ArchCl xxi (1969) 53-7; G. Colonna ibid., 295-6.

It had been cut down to cover a fourth-century drainage channel in one of the Etruscan buildings, and is therefore incomplete. The surviving portion of the inscrip- tion, in the alphabet and dialect of Aegina, may be dated to the late sixth century and reads as follows: -'I belong to Aeginetan Apollo; Sostratos [son of] ... had me made'. In spite of the absence of the patro- nymic, this unique inscription recalls Herodotus' mention of a Sostratos of Aegina who was the most successful of the Greek merchants who traded with Tartessos in southern Spain.55 Other votive inscriptions are scratched on Attic and East Greek kylikes of the second half of the sixth century: there are a dozen dedications to Hera, in the Ionic alphabet and dialect, two to Aphrodite and one to Demeter (Fig. loa, b, c). Attic and East Greek pottery is present in roughly equal proportions: Little Masters, Eye Cups, small bf lekythoi among the Attic, along with many sherds attributable to the hands and manners of Amasis, Exekias, Epiktetos, Phintias and Oltos. East Greek is represented inter alia by a large number of Ionic cups (types B2 and B3 of the Vallet-Villard classification), sherds of Fikellura, a few sherds of Ionic Little Masters, a Rhodian sherd and a few fragments of Aeolic bucchero. Of the other fabrics, Corinthian (Middle and Late) is well represented; of three Laconian cups, one shows Cadmos killing the dragon; and there are two Chalcidian vases. 1500 archaic lamps, also of Greek and East Greek manufacture, were found: all their spouts are black- ened by use, presumably votive. This, too, is another 'first' for Etruria: the massive presence of lamps recalls such votive deposits as those in the Artemision of Thasos, the Heraion of Samos, the Athenaion of Chios and the Thesmophorion of 'Ant6Ir vo a AIIytv"lTZx "I'. f6a'jpaZog ; oiEno e hol P- - 1 55 Her.

Of the other finds, twenty East Greek plastic perfume vases may be mentioned (Fig. ix); and a mid-sixth century Sardinian nuragic bronze, in the form of a miniature boat, has a parallel at Vetulonia. In the later period of the sanctuary's activity, the three Etruscan buildings appear to have been built and modified between the mid-fifth and late third centuries; their architecture is comparatively modest. They have yielded epigraphic evidence for a cult of Uni (inscription on a hemispherical silver bowl) and of Turan (four inscriptions on sherds of Etruscan rf and black glaze). In 1966, in the course of a field survey of the central and southern Ager Faliscus,56 Professor Sheldon Judson and Dr Timothy Potter recorded a section of prehistoric occupation deposits exposed by the river Treia beneath the acropolis of NVarce, I o km. south of Civita Castellana (Falerii Veteres). In 1968, a joint excavation was conducted by the British School at Rome and the Soprintendenza alla Preistoria e all'Etnografia, with the support of the Comitato per le attivit" archeologiche nella Tuscia; it was directed overall by Dr J. B. Ward Perkins and Professor R. Peroni, and in the field by Dr Potter and Dr M. A. Fugazzola.57 From 1969 onwards, the School and the Soprintendenza have continued their work on the basis of a 'netta separazione di compiti'. Professor Peroni and Dr Fugazzola have published the material they found in 1968, together with information about the stratigraphic exploration of the pre-Etruscan levels carried out by them in 1969.58 They show that the evidence points to an uninterrupted succession of settlement levels (I-- advanced phase of the Middle Bronze Age; II-Late Bronze Age; III-Final Bronze Age; IV-Early Iron Age); and they conclude that the Narce stratigraphy strongly supports the theory according to which the 'Protovillanovan' facies (of Tolfa- Allumiere type) precedes the 'Villanovan' in time. Undisputed continuity of settlement from the Bronze into the Iron Age is a new and most interest- ing element in the area;59 in this respect, Narce would seem to be aligned with sites in Latium (Rome, Ardea, Pratica di Mare-i.e. Lavinium, q.v.) in spite of its cultural allegiance to the 'Villanovan' area. It is tempting to see this as an early archaeological reflection of the distinctive cultural, ethnic and linguistic character of the Faliscans in historical times. For the 'British side' of Narce, Dr Potter court- eously contributes Fig. 12 and the following note: 'Bronzes and calibrated radiocarbon dates suggest that occupation at Narce began in the twelfth century. Seven main stratified occupation phases were identified, the latest belonging to the seventh century. Fragmentary traces of both circular and rectangular timber-built structures were recovered, although the predominant building type was appar- ently rectilinear. Faunal remains suggest that the main economic emphasis was upon sheep rearing,60 but grain seeds and mill stones imply some corn growing. The pottery series begins with Apennine Bronze Age wares, which gradually evolve, under Urnfield influence, into early Faliscan types. No substantial cultural or chronological discontinuity can be demonstrated in the sequence. About 150 bronzes and other small finds, including glass beads, relate to these Bronze Age-Iron Age occupation levels. A seventh-sixth century cemetery replaced the domestic occupation in the valley bottom, where there was a sixth century infant cemetery with stone sarcophagi. The area was given over to tile and perhaps pottery manufacture in the fourth-third centuries. The sequence stops in the mid-third century, presumably after the Roman conquest of the area. There is, however, some evidence for agricultural activity in early Imperial times. Pub- lication will be in monographic form, and the report is now (I974) nearly complete.' In 1966, the Swedish Institute in Rome began excavations at Acquarossa (Ferento: 6 km. north of Viterbo), the site of a provincial Etruscan town destroyed c. 500. Domestic and monumental build- ings have been found: and the lack of superimposed habitation means that this site, like Poggio Civitate (Murlo, Siena: q.v.), is a new and most welcome primary source for the non-funerary art and archi- tecture of the arachaic period. An exciting feature is the abundant presence of decorative architectural terra-cottas associated with apparently private houses. A particularly important painted example is illu- strated in Fig. 13: assigned to the very end of the seventh century, it bears witness to the unexpectedly early development of advanced architectural decora- tion in Etruria. The first instalment of Dr C. E. Ostenberg's report is eagerly awaited at the time of writing (Suppl. NSc [19731); a well-illustrated popular publication in Swedish is already available.61 In 1969, Professor A. Andren delivered the first Boethius Memorial Lecture on Etrusco-Italic archi- tectural terra-cottas. The published version62 con- tains many references to the Acquarossa material, later exhibited in Stockholm in the winter of 1972-73- The exhibition, organised in honour of the 9oth birthday of the late King of Sweden, also included a valuable selection of comparative material from Cerveteri, Veii, Vignanello, Tarquinia and Poggio Civitate.63 56 The 2oo00 square km. surveyed produced a total of 477 sites, including I O04 of pre-Roman date. 57 J.

Near Perugia itself, the Soprintendenza64 worked between 1968 and 1971 in the Palazzone cemetery, well known since the dis- covery of the 'Hypogeum of the Volumni'. So far, 174 tombs have been excava- ted, mainly chambers of the Hellenistic period. A few tombs are earlier than this (second half of the sixth-early fifth centuries), and thus throw welcome light on a period hitherto poorly documented in the area. Two of these earlier tombs, nos. 19 and 20, have yielded respectively a Little Master band cup and an Eye Cup. In the city itself a rescue excava- tion, occasioned by the construction of the Palazzetto dello Sport in Viale Pellini, produced a great deal of protohistoric material in 1970. Some eighth- seventh century pottery had been found in the same place (Piaggia Colombata) in 196o:65 the new find includes pottery with typically Villanovan decoration, and some Italo-Geometric. A new Etruscan alpha- bet, probably of the second half of the sixth century (Fig. 14), was found in the same area.66 Three disturbed chamber tombs of the second- first centuries were excavated at Castel del Piano in 1971; two more (one intact) were found nearby in 1972, together with three not far away in the Strozzacapponi district-all of the same period. Considered with earlier finds at Strozzacapponi and at Fosso Rigo,67 these further discoveries raise the problem of an associated habitation: it is not clear whether this is Perugia itself, 10-I2 km. away, or a nearer-and as yet unidentified-smaller centre. In the summer preceding his tragic death in January 1969, the late Dr Mario Bizzarri excavated eight more monumental tombs in the Crocefisso del Tufo cemetery at Orvieto. Four similar tombs, of the early sixth-early fifth centuries were excavated in the Cannicella cemetery: the dense superimposi- tion of tombs similar in date is particularly noticeable here (Fig. 15), and may well be true of Crocefisso del Tufo as well. Elsewhere in Orvieto, much dis- cussion has centred on the fortuitous discovery of the remains-eight courses-of a fourth century Etruscan wall in Via della Cava."s It would appear that this removes, at a stroke, the principal objection to the identification of Orvieto as Volsinii Veteres: namely that Zonaras' reference to a ze xoc d;XvpC&amp;raov (Epit. Hist. VIII, 7) had previously found no archaeological confirmation at Orvieto. The early history of the town is further documented by a Villanovan settle- ment site under the church of S. Andrea, excavated by the Catholic University of Milan and the Faina Foundation.69 Three campaigns in a large cemetery at Colfiorito di Foligno were conducted by the Soprintendenza between 197o and 1972: nearly 200 tombs, mainly intact, range in date from the ninth to the third century. The largest group may be assigned to the late sixth-fourth centuries, and has yielded a rich harvest of personal ornaments (including Picene pendants and Certosa fibulas), vases (including bf, rf and zoo- and anthropomorphic Picene handles) and bronze vessels (Schnabelkannen, situlas, etc.). A further twenty tombs, also in the Foligno area, were excavated in 1971 at Monte di Franca. Like those at Colfiorito, they are simple fossa tombs (of the fifth-fourth centuries); the fibulas include examples of the La Tene A as well as of the Certosa type. At Gioiella (Castiglione del Lago), four fossa and eleven chamber tombs were excavated in 1973- Most of these belong to the second century: an earlier phase is indicated by the presence of bucchero and Italo-Corinthian vases in tomb 8. Also in the Castiglione del Lago area, the Soprintendenza has FIG. 12 64 I am grateful to Drs Feruglio and Ponzi Bonomi for providing me with the basis of the following section and with Figs. 14 and 15. 65 StEtr xxxiv (1966) 302-3. 66 Ibid. xli (i973) 293-5. 67 Ibid. xxxiv (1966) 305, xxxvii (1969) 280. 68 M.

The fragmentary state of the material presents considerable problems of restora- tion. The results are eagerly awaited, in view of the extreme importance suggested by the location of the site-close to the Protovillanovan settlement on Monte Cetonavo and (15 km.) to Chiusi. The Soprintendenza and the Istituto di Paletno- logia of Milan University have carried out four campaigns (1970-73) in the Grotta Bella at Montecastrilli. A sequence from Neolithic to Imperial times has been established; finds include Ripoli painted ware, pottery similar to that from Sasso di Furbara, a quantity of Apennine Bronze Age material, and abundant Republican votive offerings. For reasons of time and space, there is no auton- omous section here on the territory of the Soprin- tendenza alle Antichith delle Marche. Mention must be made, however, of one remarkable discovery in this important Picene area: in the Monte Penna district of Pitino, San Severino Marche. Here, two rich Orientalising fosse have been excavated by Dr Scichilone of the Southern Etruria Soprinten- denza. One of them was very rich indeed: it contained a two-wheeled chariot, with iron fittings; two cuirass discs, with belts; bronze shields; many bronze vessels, including a cauldron, three bowls, a tripod and the lid of a lebes; a considerable quantity of bone and ivory plaques, some with incised decora- tion, and ivory furniture-fittings; and an Ionic cup in silver, which suggests a date in the late seventh- early sixth century. Most splendid of all is an ostrich egg with incised decoration (Fig. 16): it seems to have been turned into an oinochoe by the addition of a head and handle of gold-plated ivory. This is clearly an import from Etruria, probably Vulci: there are close parallels in the Isis tomb there, and in the Montagonola tomb at Quinto Fiorentino.71 TUSCANY: Soprintendenza alle Antichitdl dell'Etruria, Via della Pergola 65, 1-50121 FIRENZE.

FIG. 14 FIG. 15</page><page sequence="13">54 DAVID RIDGWAY Here too selection has been difficult-in spite of the depletion in professional staff reflected in the above rubric: there is much more in the Notiziario, and in the exemplary Florentine section of the annual 'Rassegna degli scavi e delle scoperte' which preceded it.12 I have assigned the lion's share of this section to the American excavations at Poggio Civitate. My reason for doing so is very simple. The extensive technical bibliography concerning this site consti- tutes an admirable introduction to the mainstream of modern Etruscan studies: a good deal of it is written in English, and I very much hope that my account of it will lead English readers to the work of my other Tuscan friends elsewhere. In the Archaeological Museum itself, the restora- tion work occasioned by the 1966 flood (AR 1967-68 45 f.) has continued unabated: it will be some years before it is finished, and longer still before the results can be adequately displayed. In recent years, other Soprintendenze have availed themselves of the restoration facilities in the Museum: 'foreign' material currently being treated there includes some of the fine Orientalising metalwork from Castel di Decima (q.v.) and from Pontecagnano (Salerno). Of the material in the original Museo Topografico on the ground floor, well over Io,ooo pieces have been restored in the period under review: all the pottery and bronze from Cerveteri, Orvieto, Poggio Buco, Saturnia, Tuscania, Veii and Vulci is now finished, and so is all the pottery from Bisenzio, Capena, Chiusi, Falerii and the Ager Faliscus, Marsiliana d'Albegna, Pitigliano, Poggio Montano, Sovana and Tarquinia. The impressive first fruits of the restoration programme have been illustrated in exhibitions in 1969 and 1971,73 and some of the material has been published in further monographs in the Monumenti Etruschi series (Florence: Olschki for Istituto di Studi Etruschi): M. Cristofani, Le tombe da Monte Michele [Veii] nel Museo Archeologico di Firenze (1969); G. Bartoloni, Le tombe da Poggio Buco (1971); forthcoming volumes include F. Del- pino, Le tombe da Bisenzio. Inevitably, some old pieces have revealed un- suspected characteristics in the course of restoration: a jug 'of unique shape' (Hencken) with a heavy calcareous crust, excavated by Pernier in 19o6 at Tarquinia, is now seen to be a piece of Oenotrian Geometric (Fig. 17);74 a unique cuneiform inscrip- tion has been revealed on a bronze vessel in a seventh century tomb-group from Falerii, acquired by the Museum in 1889 (Fig. 18).75 Another bronze vessel, excavated in 1886 at Vetulonia, is now published as a Phoenician relief bowl; it recalls those excavated at Nimrud by Layard, and its context may be correlated with Villanovan IIB at FIG. 16 Tarquinia and Veii.76 A similar bowl has been found at Francavilla Marittima (Calabria) by Dr Zancani Montuoro, who suggests that it was deposited c. 750o.77 Interestingly enough, both Vetu- lonia and Francavilla are among the comparatively few sites in Italy, outside the Euboean zone of Campania, which have produced seals of the North 72 StEtr xxxvii (1969) 273-9, xxxviii (1970) 251-5, xxxix (197') 301-4, xl (1972) 357-60. 73 Catalogues: Restauri Archeologici and Nuove letture di monu- menti etruschi (Florence: Olschki for Soprintendenza, 1969 and 197'). 74 Poggio dell'Impiccato, tomb 78: H.

In addition, Professor Cristofani has published the results of an investigation-of interest to all museum curators-into the physical condition of the FranCois Vase (Boll. d'Arte Ivii [1972] 199-2 II). This famous piece was not damaged in the flood; for many years, however, it has been exposed to the twin effects, highly deleterious in the long term, of the sun and of the tramp of passing feet. Professor Cristofani gives a detailed account of the various stages in the vase's restoration history before and after the 'in- cidente' of 19oo, and concludes that further revision is appropriate and indeed materially necessary; his paper is illustrated by a remarkable collection of 46 photographs, some of them ultraviolet and infrared. Mention was made in the last report of the Soprintendenza's cataloguing programme in the Florence Museum itself. In the period under review, this has been extended to cover the museum at Livorno and the Collezione Gasparri at Populonia. The latter Etruscan city, as is well known, is the only one founded directly on the coast. In the summer of 1970, an extensive survey of the underwater remains of the port, directed by Dr A. M. McCann (then of the University of Missouri), was carried out under the auspices of the American Academy (Muse v [197 1] 20-I). The project was a logical extension of the Academy's long-term survey of Tuscan ports, of which the excavations at Cosa, the earliest (third century) known Roman harbour, were a part. The material found in the Populonia harbour ranges in date from the sixth century to the fourth-fifth centuries A.D., with the majority of the pottery dating from the fourth century B.c. The location of the harbour was firmly established in 1970, to- gether with the probable line (though not the date) of the breakwater, which resembles that at Cosa; work continues. Meanwhile, on the island of Elba, the first evidence for occupation between the early seventh and early sixth centuries was found by a local amateur group, apparently in the Madonna del Monte area: it includes sherds of impasto, buccheroid impasto, bucchero, Etrusco-Corinthian (Fig. 9g) and Corinthian (three frr. of an alabastron by the Cock Painter).78 The excavations on the acropolis of Volterra, begun by Dr Bertoldi for the Soprintendenza (AR 1967-68 44) were continued by Professor Cristofani from 1969 to 1972 (Suppl. NVSc [1972], forthcoming). A Hellenistic sanctuary with two parallel temples has been discovered, and there are other structures in the vicinity. One of the temples has a single cell and moulded podium; the other, also apparently with only one cell, has a pronaos of Tuscan type with four columns in two lines. Both temples are assigned to the second quarter of the second century. In front of the temples, five water cisterns are connected by tubes made mostly of curved tiles: at one point a 'Canaanite jar' had been used. Soundings have shown that the second century complex overlies a three-phase series of earlier structural features. Of these, the first is dated to the late sixth-early fifth centuries by a fragment of Makron: at Volterra, therefore, the late sixth century becomes the period of the 'first urban epoch', with stone buildings. Elsewhere at Volterra, Professor Cristofani excavated a tomb in 1971 which yielded eighteen of the char- acteristic 'urne volterrane' in a context securely dated to the second half of the first century. A long terms study of such urns, directed by Professor Cristofani, is in progress under the auspices of the Institute of Archaeology at the University of Pisa. Important analytical studies of pottery from Volterra have also recently appeared.79 Work has also continued at Roselle; its status as a link between Northern and Southern Etruria and between the interior and the coast from the second half of the seventh century is becoming increasingly apparent.80 The discovery of a group of earlier cremation tombs nearby, at Nomadelfia (AR 1967-68 45), was briefly reported in 1969; along with some sporadic material from the surrounding hills, they have since been assigned to the Final Bronze-Early Iron Age.81 In 1969 and 1970, the Soprintendenza investigated 78 I am grateful to Dr Cristofani Martelli for showing me this Elba material, which she 'inherited' recently; see further Notiziario 525 f. 9 M.

Two phases of occupation were established: 630-58o, Late Orientalising, corresponding to the final phase of the cemetery at Chiavari in Liguria;s2 and 530- 450, coinciding with the peak of Attic trade at Marseilles. Massarosa fills the notorious gap in settlement on the Tyrrhenian coast between Volterra and Chiavari and throws some much-needed light on the presence of Etruscan objects at the latter site; it also confirms, at last, that the Ager Lunensis was inhabited during the historical period by Etruscans (Livy xli 13). Brief reference was made in AR 1967-68 45 to the Bryn Mawr College excavations, directed by Pro- fessor K. M. Phillips, in the archaic sanctuary at Poggio Civitate near Murlo (Siena). Excavation, restoration and exegesis have continued throughout the period presently under review: the results constitute a far-reaching and entirely new contri- bution to our knowledge of the domestic and religious life, art and architecture of the seventh and sixth centuries. The areas excavated are the northern part of the Piano del Tesoro plateau and the zone, Le Civitate, immediately to the west: the two areas were separated by a north-south agger. The elaborate sixth century building complex uncovered on Piano del Tesoro has four equal sides (c. 61I m.) and an open central courtyard, in which a modest templum is the focal point.83 The complex is dated by its impasto, bucchero and imported Greek pottery to the second quarter of the sixth century. Similar material has been found in the Civitate dumps west of the agger. No finds seem to be later than 525, and it is evident that at this round date the buildings were torn down, the agger was built and the dumps were made: one frieze plaque has been reconstructed from pieces found in the debris around the templum, in the agger fill and in the lowest levels of one of the dumps-and this sort of situation is by no means unique. There are no signs of super- imposed habitation on the site after the third quarter of the sixth century. In 1970, excavations began under the floor level of the main building complex: a lower complex was revealed. It had been destroyed by fire (though not extensively looted) not later than c. 58o, and was soon replaced by the upper building. The founda- tion trenches and walls of the latter caused con- siderable displacement of the earlier material, already in the form of debris, contemporary with the great Orientalising tombs of Vulci, Veii, Palestrina and Cerveteri. Valuable chronological information about the floruit of the lower building is provided by two 'sets' of fine pottery: Professor Phillips observes that 'the owner of our building seems to have purchased in lots'.

Published fragments of an Etrusco-Corinthian plate85 are closer to the destruction date: the piece is defined by J. G. Szilagyi as a typical work by the American Academy Painter, active 590-570. Two more plates have since been cleaned: and both are decorated with the characteristic birds of the same painter, whose known works86 are thus raised from eight to eleven by the Poggio Civitate examples. The lower building therefore has a life-span of fifty years, represented by the dates respectively of the Ionic cups and the Etrusco-Corinthian plates. While these dates are satisfactory for the vast majority of the impasto, bucchero, metal, ivory and bone fragments as well, some sherds seem to fall within the first half of the seventh century. The con- struction date of the lower building may tentatively be assigned to the same half-century: and this will naturally apply to its architectural terra-cottas as well. The most complete of these is a ridgepole tile with akroterion, which Ingrid Gantz relates87 to the roofing system of certain late Villanovan hut urns. The comparison is a telling one, and recalls Agnes K. Lake's theory of the origin of the pediment of the Tuscan temple.A8 It is in any case clear that the lower building is the direct ancestor of the upper, and that the roofing systems are generally similar. An indigenous tradition for the system of architec- tural terra-cottas is becoming increasingly apparent. Archaeologically and architecturally, indeed, Poggio Civitate may ultimately provide an unbroken sequence 82 N.

In turn, the influence of the Etruscan architectural tradition documented in the upper complex-with its central court, colonnades and templum-is seen in Roman Republican fora and in the Republican temple precincts.89 Meanwhile, display and detailed publication have kept pace with work in the field. In the summer of I970, an exhibition of the first four seasons' work was held under the auspices of the Soprintendenza in Florence and Siena.90 In November 1973, the Superintendent of Antiquities and the Mayor of Siena officially opened a permanent exhibition of material from the site in the Sala Marcolina at the Palazzo Comunale in Siena. The display gives an admirably clear picture of the sanctuary and of its architectural decoration, and includes particularly good models of various segments of roof. These reconstructions employ complete terra-cottas, or those whose reconstruction seems secure: although they are tentative, the system of pan and cover tiles, the individual arrangement of antefixes and the general position of the lateral and raking simas may be accepted. A selection of the Poggio Civitate terra-cottas was included in the i973 Stockholm exhibition,"9 referred to elsewhere. The publication record of Professor Phillips and his collaborators is legendary, and extends not only to punctual and detailed preliminary reports in English and Italian92 but also to major individual contri- butions on specific classes of material from the upper building. For the reason stated at the beginning of this section, I append a 'readers' guide.' The numerous sixth century terra-cotta plaques, homogeneous in style and dimensions, were all made at Poggio Civitate itself in the coarse local clay.93 They represent four subjects: an assembly of seated divinities (Fig. 20o), treated by T. N. Gantz in StEtr xxxix (197i) 3-24; a banquet (Fig. 21), treated by J. Penny Small, ibid. 25-61; a horse race (Fig. 22), treated by M. Cool Root in AJA lxxvii (1973) 121-37; and a procession, treated by T. N. Gantz in Rim.Mitt. forthcoming. J. MacIntosh discusses representations of furniture on all four types, ibid. Lucy Shoe Meritt discussed the architectural mouldings in StEtr xxxviii (1970) 13-25; she grouped the characteristic Poggio Civitate cavetto moulding with that on the so-called 'panther and minotaur' revetment found in the area of the Regia in Rome. In forthcoming papers, 0. Wikander and J. Neils will discuss the roof tiles and Gorgon antefixes94 respectively. The nearly life-sized seated-statue akroteria, with their striking hats (front cover), are presented in depth by I. Gantz in DialArch vi (1972) I67-235. This stylistically unique group of thirteen male and female figures is dated, like the frieze plaques, to the second quarter of the sixth century; Professor Bianchi Bandinelli has suggested, ibid. 236-47, that they are imbued with a late Villanovan spirit. This observation is especially interesting in view of Mrs Gantz's remarks (reported above) on the Villanovan affinities of a ridgepole akroterion from the lower building. Studies of the non-architectural finds have appeared as follows: G. Valentini in StEtr xxxviii (1970) 36I95 and L. Donati ibid. xxxix (1971) 307-II (bucchero); B.

FIG. 21 Militare cemetery: the associated gold and other objects make this a key tomb-group for the Bolognese Orientalising of Dr Caracini's Villanovan IVB2 period (625-575).96 This early and unique piece of 'Situla Art' shows the spinning and weaving pro- cess from beginning to end, and is thus a valuable technological document; it is discussed in detail by Dr C. Morigi Govi,97 the Director of the Museum. In collaboration with the Reggio Emilia Museum (Dr Ambrosetti), the Soprintendenza has begun to excavate in the Campo Pianelli area on the Pietra di Bismantova; sixteen new Protovillanovan tombs have been found in 1973, and more are expected as work continues. Dr Morigi Govi has completed the late Dr R. Pincelli's monograph on La necropoli 7villanoviana di San Vitale, which will shortly appear.98 More news of Dr Gentili's excavation of the excep- tionally rich and unusual Orientalising tombs at Verruchio (Forli) is eagerly awaited. It is already clear from his account of the Villanovan shields found there in I96399 that there was significant contact with Southern Etruria, and that the site had an im- portant and wide-ranging commercial role between the eighth and the late sixth century. On behalf of the University, Professor G. Gualandi has continued to examine the many problems connected with the town-plan and chronology of Felsina (Bologna).'00 In early 1973, he exca- vated the first public building in the Etruscan city: a sanctuary in use from the late sixth to the fourth century, situ- ated in the area of the University Faculty of Engineering (the ex-Villa Cassarini), where excavations had previously taken place in 1964. The finds include thirteen small mass-produced votive bronzes, and two larger ones-an archaic devotee (Fig 25) and a fourth-century Hercules (Fig 26). These are the first votive bronzes with artistic preten- sions ever found at Felsina; the difference in date indicates that the sanctuary was in use over a long period, and it thus becomes a new and important fixed point in the town-plan. The University has also continued its long-term excavation at Marzabotto, and Professor G. A. Mansuelli has recently summarised the results of the last ten years' work there.101 A sanctuary, extra- urban and associated with a sacred spring, was explored to the north of the main city site in 1969 (G. Gualandi, StEtr xxxviii [1970] 217-23). Since 1967, StEtr has carried a regular section of reports and studies on Marzabotto, subdivided into sections on 'naturalistica', new excavations, material from old excavations, and discoveries and material in the vicinity. The Ecole Frangaise excavated another important archaic centre at Casalecchio di Reno between I961 and I970.102 At Monte Bibele (Monterenzio, Bologna), Professor Scarani is at the beginning (1972- ) of a series of campaigns in a most interesting multi-period complex. It consists of an emptied Etruscan tholos tomb-the first of its kind to be found north of the Apennines-of the late sixth-early fifth centuries; this was deliber- ately surrounded by a dry-stone wall, perhaps defensive, built by Celts in the fourth-third century; there is also evidence for occupation in the Final Bronze Age. Finds include Massiliot coins of the late fourth century, black glaze pottery-some of it with Etruscan inscriptions, much other pottery and 96 G.
