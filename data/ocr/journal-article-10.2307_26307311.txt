We analyze these new dates along with 25 previously published dates to refine a sequence of 10 archaeological phases spanning almost three and a half millennia, from ca. 4000 to 650 B.C. The phases are summarized with a brief description of their most salient characteristics. We include illustrations of the Early Formative period ceramics and figurines from the Mazatan region. The sequence of phases reveals a trajectory of cultural evolution beginning in the Archaic period with the mobile hunting, fishing, and gathering Chantuto people. By 1550 B.C., the first ceramic-using sedentary communities appeared on the coast of Chiapas. They were hunter-fisher-gatherers who supplemented their food supply with cultivated plants, including maize and beans. We suggest that by the Locona phase (1400-1250 B.C.) in Chiapas, they began the transition from egalitarian sociopolitical organization to simple chiefdoms, leaving behind evidence of large-scale architectural constructions, long-distance imports such as obsidian and jade, and elaborately crafted prestige goods. Also in Chiapas, during the Cherla phase (1100-1000 B.C.), ceramic and figurine styles, nearly identical to those found at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan on the Gulf Coast, made their first appearance. Many of the local artifact styles were gradually replaced by styles that became increasingly widespread in Mesoamerica. The chronology presented here shows that these changes were roughly contemporaneous with similar ones in neighboring regions of Mesoamerica. Previous archaeological research along the Pacific coast of Chi apas, Mexico, and Guatemala suggests that it was one of sev eral regions in Mesoamerica where sociopolitically complex societies first arose. However, our understanding of the timing and nature of this development from Late Archaic to Middle Formative times has always been hampered by small, dispersed, and poorly dated archaeological samples. This situation has pre vented a reliable correlation of developments both within the Pacific coastal region and between it and neighboring regions. The lack of a precise and reliable chronology for the study area has also made it difficult to evaluate and compare the archae ological phases previously defined. Recent work in several areas of Mesoamerica has helped to refine regional chronologies and provide the necessary frame work in which processual questions can be answered. The Late Archaic and Early to Middle Formative sequences from the Basin of Mexico (Tolstoy 1978, 1989), the Tehuacan Valley (Johnson and MacNeish 1972), the Morelos Valley (Grove 1987; Guillén and Grove 1987), the Valley of Oaxaca (Drennan 1983; Flannery 1983a, 1983b; Marcus 1983), and the Gulf Coast low lands (Coe and Diehl 1980; Lowe 1978; Rust and Sharer 1988) have all begun to yield fascinating new perspectives on the com parative evolution of complex societies in Mesoamerica (e.g., Blanton et al. 1993; Flannery 1976; Flannery and Marcus 1983; Sharer and Grove 1989). One of the key building blocks on which such studies are based is a sound chronology that allows accurate monitoring of diachronic change within regions as well as relatively precise comparisons between regions. Our purpose in fine tuning the dating of the culture-historical sequence from the Pacific coast region of southeastern Meso america is to provide a framework that we can use to test hypoth eses about the evolution of Archaic and Formative cultures. The refined dating of phases presented below allows us to describe the main archaeological discoveries for each phase and to make some initial phase-to-phase comparisons of ceramic artifacts, architectural features, settlement history, population trends, interregional exchange in goods and ideas, and changes in socio political complexity. In this paper we will not attempt to present an explanation of the changes that took place; rather, we simply present an 161</page><page sequence="2">162 Blake et al. outline of the chronology and briefly discuss the archaeolog ical data on which it is based. Future publications will address our individual and collective interpretations of the cultural evolutionary processes that shaped the observed changes in the region. Since 1983, the authors have undertaken five separate archae ological projects along the coastal strip from Chiapas to El Sal vador. Voorhies and Michaels (1989) conducted excavations in 1988 at the Archaic-period site of Tlacuachero in Chiapas, Mexico; Clark and Blake (Clark et al. 1987, 1990) surveyed and excavated in 1985 and 1990 at a number of Archaic and Early Formative sites in the Mazatan region of Chiapas; from 1983 to 1985 Love (1989a) carried out a survey of Early and Middle Formative sites in the Naranjo River region of Guatemala and excavated at La Blanca. Pye and Demarest (Pye 1989) excavated in 1987 and 1988 at the Early and Middle Formative site of El Mesak in Guatemala, and Demarest and colleagues (Demarest et al. 1989) excavated in 1988 at El Carmen in El Salvador. The results of these recent archaeological projects combined with those from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s provide us with abso lute dates for the entire sequence of 10 archaeological phases. DATING THE PHASES The present study includes 104 radiocarbon dates (79 new ones and 25 previously published) from 21 different archaeological sites.1 These dates span a period of almost three and a half mil lennia, from ca. 4000 to 650 b.c. (Table 1). The locations of the sites from which these samples were recovered are shown in Fig ure 1. In an analysis with so many radiocarbon samples, there were inevitably cases where some individual samples yielded dates much older or younger than expected on the basis of artifact cross dating. Some dates were obviously off by half a millen nium or more while others were only a century or two older or younger than the other samples in the phase. Figures 2 and 3 show the distribution of dates listed in Table 1 and the estimated phase boundaries. The phase boundaries shown in Figures 2 and 3 are subjec tively drawn to include the mean and/or median phase date, where possible, while at the same time avoiding overlap with adjacent phases. This is easy to do with phases that are long rel ative to the standard deviation of an individual date, such as with Chantuto A and Chantuto B phases. However, with short phases (i.e., spanning 100-150 years) whose length is not much greater than any given date's single standard deviation (i.e., ± 60-120 years), then the likelihood is great that all dates will over lap with at least one adjacent phase. Table 2 lists the estimated phase boundaries and presents the mean and median dates for each phase.2 We consider these boundary estimates to be ten tative and expect that, with the availability of more dates in the future, they will require adjustment. Figure 4 charts the estimated ages for each of the defined phases for the Pacific Coast of southeastern Mesoamerica and their chronological correlations with the detailed and well known sequences in the Tehuacan Valley, the Valley of Oaxaca, and the Gulf Coast region. 93 ~$2 ■16 /, ■ Pajon Campon , Tlacuachero Zapotillo 16 Cerro de las Conchas Aquiles Serdan ' Chilo San Carlos I zapa 91 90 La Blanca Salinas la Blanca La Victoria SM-4 4f. *1.

CHANTUTO PHASE (4000-ca. I 800 B.C.) The first phase defined for the Soconusco region is the Archaic period Chantuto phase. New dates from Tlacuachero (Voorhies and Michaels 1989:5) and Cerro de las Conchas (Clark et al. 1987, 1990), as well as the reanalysis of previously published dates, suggest two distinct subphases (Table 1). The earliest, Chantuto A (4000-3000 B.C.), is represented by nine new radiocarbon dates from Cerro de las Conchas (Table 1), a large shell mound in Chiapas. All but one of these dates are significantly earlier than all the other Chantuto-phase dates and indicate that Cerro de las Conchas represents an earlier compo nent of the phase. The dates range from 4300 ± 130 to 2850 ± 80 B.C., indicating a long sequence of occupation that does not overlap with the succeeding subphase. We are tentatively assign ing it a range from 4000 to 3000 B.C. There are few diagnostic artifacts for this subphase, but pre liminary analysis of the material shows that some scraping tools were made from large marine bivalve shells such as Anadara granáis. Obsidian is entirely absent, suggesting that the trade in obsidian did not begin until later in the Archaic period. At present we lack sufficient information to summarize the settle ment patterns and sociopolitical organization of the Chantuto people for this subphase. The second subphase is Chantuto B (3000-1800 B.C.) with 17 samples (Table 1). Recent excavations at the Tlacuachero mound uncovered evidence of a large clay occupation surface with two oval-shaped temporary structures defined by posthole patterns (Voorhies and Michaels 1989; Voorhies et al. 1991). Unfortunately, the clay floor was largely devoid of artifacts and trash accumulation. Therefore, we still do not have a large sam ple of Chantuto-phase artifacts.

The overall pattern for the Chantuto phase, including both of the subphases, is one of a small nomadic population of hunt ers, fishers, and gatherers who remained for long periods of time in coastal estuary settings where they exploited estuarine resources, principally marsh clams and possibly shrimp. The evi dence from Tlacuachero suggests periodic gatherings of larger groups and the construction of large facilities that could have been used as shelters, possibly for ritual purposes. Michaels and Voorhies (1989) have argued that Chantuto shell middens were locations for large-scale, specialized shellfish gathering.

Stable-carbon-isotope analysis of skeletal remains from two Chantuto B individuals from Tlacuachero tends to confirm that these people had a more diverse subsistence pattern than pre viously suspected. Blake, Chisholm, Clark, Voorhies, and Love (1992) have shown that the two Archaic individuals had much higher 513C values than did the succeeding Early Formative period villagers of the neighboring Mazatan region. Their 513C values were —9.3%o and — 10.2%o, levels similar to those noted for individuals relying heavily on C4 plant consumption (includ ing maize) in other parts of the New World. Therefore, it is pos sible that, by Chantuto B times, people had begun to cultivate and consume maize in the nearby piedmont or upland zones, if not actually within the estuary zone. However, it is also pos sible that these isotope ratios were produced by a diet high in marine resources. Analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen iso topes of marine organisms in the region is currently under way in order to help resolve this issue. Figure 4 shows the chronological correlations between the Chantuto phase in the Pacific Coast and the Archaic-period phases in both the Tehuacan Valley and the Valley of Oaxaca.3 BARRA PHASE (ca. 1 550-1400 B.C.) This is the first-known phase of the Early Formative period along the Pacific coast of southeastern Mesoamerica, and one that still remains poorly understood (Figure 4). There are at least 15 sites with Barra-phase ceramics, but only two sites with radio carbon dates: San Carlos and Paso de la Amada (Table 1). The Barra phase was first defined by Lowe (1967) for Altamira, where no dates were obtained, but later work by Ceja Tenorio (1985) at Paso de la Amada recovered Barra ceramics associated with two radiocarbon samples. Recent reanalysis of the ceram ics, however, leads us to believe that only one of these two sam ples (1-8161) dates Barra-phase material, while the other dates Locona-phase material. The remaining 10 dates are from San Carlos. They include one (B-45313) that is Chantuto B in age and could have come from a mixed earlier Archaic occupation at the site.4 The ceramics for this phase are described by Lowe (1975) and Ceja Tenorio (1985). The most striking feature of Barra-phase ceramics is their high quality of manufacture and wide range of decorative techniques (Figures 5 and 6). Barra potters used monochrome, bichrome, and trichrome slipping; incising and zoned stamping; and grooving and fluting to achieve a variety of surface finishes. During this phase, almost all vessels were finely made with thin walls and coarse paste. The two forms are flat-bottomed tecomates (comprising 85% of the total assem blage) and deep bowls (comprising 15%). Clark and Blake (1994:25) report finding no unslipped, undecorated wares. Although our sample of Barra-phase ceramics is much smaller than that recovered for succeeding phases, it nevertheless includes several thousand sherds from excavations at the sites of Altamira, Paso de la Amada, San Carlos, and Ley, all in the Mazatan region. It is unlikely, therefore, that the lack of un slipped and undecorated cooking and storage wares from Barra phase deposits has resulted from incomplete sampling. Instead, Barra-phase people in the Mazatan region either decorated all of their ceramic serving, cooking, and storage vessels, or they only made decorated serving vessels and did not yet manufac ture cooking and storage vessels. 3 The temporal correspondences as portrayed in Figure 4 are based on the published estimates of phase ages for each area and must be con sidered as tentative, pending a closer comparison of shared and traded artifact types, especially ceramic vessels and figurines. Thus far we have found a reasonable degree of correspondence between the phases defined for the Pacific Coast region and those in neighboring areas, especially for the Formative periods. However, there are some discrepancies that may be resolved with future analyses of the phase dating for those areas. 4 During a visit to San Carlos in 1989, a large Archaic stone mortar and pestle was shown to Clark and Blake by the landowner, who had recently found it while excavating a well below the current water table. This suggests the presence of a deeply buried Archaic occupation under lying the Early Formative site, perhaps a widespread phenomenon in the region (Voorhies and Kennett 1995). Test excavations in 1990 recovered some evidence of this earlier occupation including used river cobble flakes, chopping tools, fire-cracked rock, and no associated ceramics (Clark et al. 1990), but more recent excavations at the site by Voorhies (1994) failed to find additional evidence of this putative Archaic occupation.</page><page sequence="8">168 Blake et al. Figure 5. Reconstruction drawings of Barra-phase ceramic groups from the Mazatan region: (top) Early Barra phase; (bottom) Late Barra phase. We have found few ceramic figurines that are definitely of Barra age, however, there is one large hollow type that may have appeared first during this phase and continued into the Locona phase (Figure 7a). To date, we have found no pre-Barra-phase ceramics, lead ing us to believe that the Barra-phase folk, whom we have dubbed "Mokaya," were either immigrants to the region (Clark and Blake 1989) or descendants of the Chantuto people who adopted ceramic technology as a supplement to an existing gourd industry (Clark and Blake 1994). The use of gourd shapes as templates for the earliest ceramics is common in Mesoamer ica (e.g., the Purron and Early Ajalpan phases at Tehuacan [MacNeish et al. 1970:21-25] and the Espiridion phase in Oax aca [Marcus 1983:42-43]). However, in most regions the earli est gourd-shaped ceramic vessels are generally plainwares with little or no decoration. In contrast, the early Mokaya people, who were also imitating gourds, were using ceramic technology to supplement or replace decorated gourds, probably for more public serving functions rather than utilitarian cooking or stor age functions. Even though the Barra-phase Mokaya in the Mazatan region were probably egalitarian villagers, there may have been intense status competition and rivalry expressed in feasting and ceremonials requiring the manufacture and use of elaborate ceramic serving vessels (Clark and Blake 1994:25-27). The ceramic differences between the Mazatan region and con temporaneous neighboring regions of Mesoamerica may have resulted from differences in the social and political forces shap ing ceramic use as well as differences in the utilitarian require ments of vessels. Early villagers in the uplands of Oaxaca and Tehuacan, for example, may have used ceramics to both boil dried maize, beans, and seeds and to serve cooked foods in an egalitarian social context, with little emphasis on competitive feasting displays. In contrast, Barra-phase ceramics in the Maza tan region seem to have been used exclusively for serving func tions, possibly in situations of prominent social display. We have some evidence, including a few charred maize ker nels, to suggest that Barra-phase people practiced agriculture. Also, because several of the ceramic vessel forms imitate gourds, these were probably cultivated. However, stable-carbon-isotope analysis of two Barra-phase individuals and 13 later Mokaya tradition individuals from the sites of Aquiles Serdan, Chilo, Paso de la Amada, San Carlos, and Villo, all in the Mazatan region, suggest they consumed little in the way of C4 plants (Blake, Chisholm, Clark, and Mudar 1992; Blake, Chisholm, Clark, Voorhies, and Love 1992). At the same time, large quan tities of fresh- and brackish-water fish bones and scales and the bones of a wide range of other amphibious and terrestrial ani mals have been found. These findings are similar to those already identified for later Mokaya phases5 and suggest that the Barra-phase Mokaya relied heavily on fishing, hunting, col lecting, and cultivating C3 plants such as beans and avocados, as the basis of their subsistence system, and that maize agricul ture was perhaps only a supplement (Blake, Chisholm, Clark, and Mudar 1992). In terms of the radiocarbon dates, the Barra phase is roughly contemporaneous with the Ojochi phase at San Lorenzo Tenoch titlan and the Early Bari period at La Venta. It also corresponds to the estimated age for the Espiridion phase in Oaxaca, and the late Purron/Early Ajalpan phases in the Tehuacan Valley (Fig ure 4). The correspondence with the Ojochi phase was some what surprising at first, since several authors have remarked that Ojochi-phase and Ocos-phase ceramics share some similarities (e.g., Coe and Diehl 1980; Lowe 1975:29). However, we now think that many Ocos-phase ceramic traits, previously defined by Coe (1961), actually belong to the earlier Barra or Locona phases, where they appear in clearer stratigraphic contexts at a number of sites in the Mazatan region (including Aquiles Ser dan, Chilo, San Carlos, and Paso de la Amada). LOCONA PHASE (1400-1250 B.C.) We first recognized the Locona phase at Chilo and Paso de la Amada. Initially we thought of Locona as "Early" or "La Vic toria" Ocos until we realized that there were ceramic, figurine, and other artifact types unique to the phase. It is now clear that both Locona and Ocos components are present at the site of La Victoria, where Ocos-phase materials were first discovered and defined by Michael Coe (1961). Locona-like deposits extend as far south as El Carmen in El Salvador (Figure 1). Most Barra-phase sites continued to be occupied into the Locona phase, and new settlements were also founded. At 5 The analysis of the faunal remains from Clark and Blake's exca vations at several sites in the Mazatan region was carried out by Kent Flannery and Karen Mudar using comparative collections at the Uni versity of Michigan (Flannery and Mudar 1991).</page><page sequence="9">Late Archaic and Formative radiocarbon chronology 169 g Figure 6.

We have dated 29 samples from Locona-phase components at eight sites: Chilo, Los Alvarez, Paso de la Amada, San Carlos, Sandoval, El Mesak, Medina, and El Carmen (Table 1). In many ways, the Locona phase represents a departure from the previous Barra phase. Ceramic styles changed considerably: several decorative techniques (such as fluting and polychrome slipping) declined in frequency, whereas several new ones (such as zoned punctation, rim bolstering, shell edge and back rocker stamping, fingernail gouging, incising, and iridescent painting on red slip) increased or were added (Clark and Blake 1994: 26-27) (Figures 8 and 9). Burnished red slipping became the most common style of surface treatment, and decoration was con fined to vessel rims and interiors rather than exteriors, as was the case during the Barra phase. Slab tripod legs appeared on some large tecomates and plates. By Locona times, tecomates dropped to about 47% of the assemblage, while the percent age of dishes, plates, and bowls increased to 53%, indicating a change in the serving functions of vessels. New forms and a greater range of vessel sizes appeared. For example, large beveled-rim dishes were made along with some incense burners and hollow animal-effigy vessels. Well-modeled hollow and small, crude, solid anthropomorphic and some zoomorphic ceramic figurines first appeared in association with Locona ceramics (Figure 7b-d). Carefully carved, thin-walled stone bowls appeared for the first time during the Locona phase. These stone vessels were made of a hard, fine-grained andesite and imitated the form of a beveled-rim, iridescent pink-on-specular-red ceramic bowl type that was also made during this phase. One of the most important discoveries for this phase is the sequence of superimposed structures in Mound 6 at Paso de la Amada (Blake et al. 1991). Blake (1991) has argued that the series of six floors, three of which were excavated in 1985, rep resent either a sequence of chiefs' residences or an expansion of public buildings such as communal meeting houses. Excava tions in 1990 recovered the remains of Structure 4, the earliest and largest yet excavated in the sequence. It was apsidal, 22 m long, 10 m wide, with walls of packed clay (not adobes) 50 cm thick and 50 cm high. The structure rested on a packed-clay platform almost 1 m above the surrounding ground level. The apsidal floor plan was used for all of the structures in the se quence with the short axis always oriented toward the volcano Tacana (Blake et al. 1991). This orientation, combined with additions in mound volume and the rebuilding of structures, indicates a symbolic continuity and suggests growth in social stature of the successive groups who occupied Mound 6. Simi lar large Locona-phase structures, but ones without standing clay walls, were excavated in 1990 at the site of San Carlos (Clark et al. 1990). In the Mazatan region, we have recovered small quantities of charred maize cupules and cob fragments, as well as charred beans and avocado seeds, all of which provide direct evidence that people of the Mokaya tradition practiced cultivation to supplement a diet rich in estuarine flora and fauna (Blake, Chisholm, Clark, and Mudar 1992; Feddema 1993). Notched sherd net weights were used during this phase and were proba bly an important part of the fishing technology that was devel oped to catch several species of fish common in the brackish estuary system (see Cherla phase, later). Based on the number and size of sites, the Locona-phase population was two to three times greater than that of the preceding Barra phase. There was a clear two-level settlement hierarchy with the largest sites, such as Paso de la Amada, ap proximately 50 ha in size, and the smaller sites, 1 ha or less in total area. Clark (1994) and Clark and Blake (1994) argue that the Locona-phase Mokaya were the first people in the region to make the transition from an egalitarian society to simple chiefdoms. OCOS PHASE (1250-1100 B.C.) There is considerable continuity between the Locona and Ocos phases — so much so that only recently have we been able to dis tinguish between the two. The Ocos phase was defined by Coe (1961) at La Victoria, where he found a well-stratified sequence of deposits containing a previously unknown assemblage of ceramics and figurines. During the following quarter century a number of researchers excavated at Ocos-phase sites but recov ered no datable radiocarbon samples (Ceja Tenorio 1985; Ekholm 1969; Lowe 1967; Lowe et al. 1982; Navarrete 1967). This lack Figure 8. Reconstruction drawing of Locona-phase ceramic group from the Mazatan region.</page><page sequence="12">172 Blake et al. Figure 9.

All Locona-phase sites continued to be occupied during the Ocos phase, and some new Ocos-phase settlements were founded. Ocos-phase deposits have been found at 42 sites along the Pacific Coast, and we have excavated collections from 16 of them. Four of these sites have been dated with a total of 12 radiocarbon samples (Table 1). We have placed the beginning of the Ocos phase at 1250 B.C. and its end at 1100 B.C. This span is considerably narrowed from Michael Coe's (1961:132) initial</page><page sequence="13">Late Archaic and Formative radiocarbon chronology 1 73 estimates (ca. 1500-1000 B.C.), but strikingly similar to Coe and Flannery's (1967:70) estimate of 1300 to 1100 B.C. Ocos ceramics include most of the types defined by Coe at La Victoria as well as many new types from the most recent excavations in Chiapas (Figures 10 and 11). Forms include teco mates, bowls, dishes, and plates. The bowls, dishes, and plates, which comprise about 55% of the assemblage, are distinctive because they usually have bolstered "pie-crust" and crenellated rims. Burnished red slipping predominated, but brownwares and graywares became common for the first time. Decoration of bowls and plates was still restricted to rims and interiors, but small zoomorphic effigy vessels were much more frequent than earlier. Rim treatment was much finer than during the Locona phase, when dish and plate rims were often decorated with coarse ridges, incisions, and punctations. Some dishes with solid tripod legs were still being made, but less frequently than dur ing the Locona phase. Tecomate size and decoration varied considerably more dur ing the Ocos phase than previously. Large Michis Thin teco mates with hollow tripod legs were common. Decoration of these was restricted to a band of red slip encircling the rim exte rior and one or two encircling incisions below the rim. These may have been used for cooking and storage as well as serving. Other, more elaborate tecomates were smaller and lacked tri pod legs. These sometimes had zoned burnishing and fine cord impressed stamping over their entire exterior surfaces. Many well-made miniature tecomates have also been recovered. Other artifacts characteristic of the phase include solid anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines (Figure 7e-g). In fact, figurines became more abundant and varied during the Ocos phase than at any other time in the Pacific Coast region. One of the key characteristics of Ocos figurines is their individ uality—both human and animal representations are extremely diverse and realistic. This is paralleled in the ceramic assemblage with much higher proportions of zoomorphic effigy vessels rep resenting a wide range of animal species. Ceramic ear spools, crude bead-shaped ceramic net weights, stone bowls, and obsid ian tools were used throughout the phase but were found more commonly at the large sites such as Aquiles Serdan and Paso de la Amada. A small number of simple Ocos-phase burials have been excavated, and all had some inclusions, even if only a large stone placed near the head. There is also evidence of Ocos-phase structures: the uppermost floors of Mound 6 at Paso de la Amada were Ocos in age. Clark et al. (1987) excavated several remnants of floors at Aquiles Serdan, but exposed only one small apsidal structure (Blake et al. 1991). Well-preserved remains of maize, beans, and avocado seeds provide evidence for continued use of domesticates during this phase (Feddema 1993). However, stable-carbon-isotope analysis of four Ocos-phase human burials suggests that maize (or any other C4 plant) was still not a significant part of the diet (Blake, Chisholm, Clark, Voorhies, and Love 1992). The Ocos-phase Mokaya continued the trend of developing sociopolitical complexity we inferred for the Locona phase. Population size doubled, with most settlements growing, while some new ones were founded. There was still a two-level settle ment hierarchy, with centers surrounded by smaller villages that, judging by patterns of obsidian distribution, may have fallen under their political control (Clark et al. 1989). The largest sites, such as Paso de la Amada, were still about 50 ha in surface area and the smaller ones in the 1-3-ha range. CHERLA PHASE (1100-1000 B.C.) The Cherla phase represents a rapid and significant shift in the developing Mokaya tradition. Ocos-phase sites continued to be occupied, but ceramic and figurine styles belonging to the Mesoamerica-wide Olmec tradition appeared for the first time. The phase was first defined at Aquiles Serdan where there exists a clear stratigraphic sequence of Ocos, Cherla, and Cuadros deposits (Clark et al. 1987). A total of 18 sites had evidence of Cherla-phase ceramics, but only six dates were obtained at four of the eight excavated sites (Table 1). Admittedly, this is a small sample, but it does place the Cherla phase squarely between the Ocos and Cuadros phases. The analysis also shows that the previously published date (Shook and Hatch 1979) for the Navarijo mound is similar in age to Cherla deposits at both El Mesak, Chilo, and Aquiles Serdan. Cherla-phase ceramics were transitional between the "Mo kaya" Ocos and the "Olmec" Cuadros (Figures 12 and 13). Brownwares and graywares replaced the Ocos redwares. Also common for the first time were white-rimmed black bowls, and vessels with streaking and fire clouding. The frequency of teco Figure 10.

Ocos-phase bowls with bolstered rims were replaced with direct rim bowls. Thin Ocos tecomates were replaced with somewhat thicker tecomates that often had an orange to brown slip. Some Ocos-style figurines continued to be produced during the Cherla phase, but toward the end of the phase there were increasing numbers of San Lorenzo Olmec-style figurines (Fig ure 7h-i) (Coe and Diehl 1980). Ceramic ear spools, many of</page><page sequence="15">Late Archaic and Formative radiocarbon chronology 175 Figure 12. Reconstruction drawing of Cheria phase ceramic group from the Mazatan region. which were highly burnished and decorated with punctation and incising, were more common at this time than during any pre vious phase in the sequence. Magnetite mirror fragments were also found more frequently in the Cherla-phase deposits at Paso de la Amada than at any other time. Shook and Hatch (1979) have argued for a pre-Cuadros phase that they called Navarijo, after the Navarijo mound at Salinas La Blanca, a site first excavated by Coe and Flannery (1967). Shook and Hatch suggested that Navarijo was coeval with the Ocos phase. However, it is now clear that most of the ceramics from the Navarijo mound represent specialized wares (primarily tecomates) similar to those at Cherla-phase Aquiles Serdan. Estuary sites such as Salinas la Blanca were small ham lets whose inhabitants specialized in a more limited range of activities than those at the larger inland Cherla-phase sites. Site specialization also occurred during the Ocos phase at sites such as Sandoval and Los Alvarez. Marcus (1976:86) has suggested that smaller hamlets in the estuary lagoons may have been spe cialized fishing communities within a larger more complex regional system. This interpretation is certainly consistent with our data from small sites in the Mazatan region, showing a dominance of fish remains in the faunal assemblages, the lim ited range of ceramic and figurine types, and the stable-carbon isotope analyses showing a lack of maize in the diet. No Cherla-phase structures have yet been completely exca vated, but Mound 1 at Paso de la Amada contained almost exclusively Cherla-phase ceramics. It was the largest structure at the site during this phase, probably replacing the functions of Mound 6, which contained the largest Locona- and Ocos phase structures (Clark et al. 1994). At Aquiles Serdan, a large refuse-filled pit yielded tens of thousands of small fish and animal bones (Flannery and Mudar 1991). Of the identifiable specimens, the most common species present were gar (Lepisosteus sp.), catfish (family Ariidae), mojarra negra (Chichlasoma sp.), turtles (Kinosternon sp. and Trachemys sp.), various reptiles such as snakes, crocodiles, and iguanas, 15 species of birds, 9 species of small mammals, domestic dog (Canis familiaris), and whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Bone fishhooks and ceramic net weights attest to the importance of fishing. Carbonized plant remains included maize kernels and cob fragments, beans, and many other unidentified charred seeds and wood fragments. However, as with the previous phases, the two Cherla-phase burials analyzed for stable-carbon isotopes yielded readings that were still far too low to indicate significant maize consumption (Blake, Chis holm, Clark, Voorhies, and Love 1992). We do not yet have an estimate of the Cherla-phase popu lation, but in the Mazatan region, most Ocos-phase sites also have Cher la components, and there are some new Cherla sites. The frequent use and discard of ceramic ear spools, iron-ore mirror fragments, and the emulation or importation of other nonlocal artifacts, such as figurines, suggest an increase in trade and overall sociopolitical complexity. CUADROS PHASE (1000-900 B.C.) The timing of the Cuadros phase is somewhat more problem atic than the preceding phases. For this analysis we have only six radiocarbon samples from three sites —the four dates pre viously published by Coe and Flannery (1967), and two new dates, including one on a charcoal sample collected by Ceja Tenorio in 1974 from the site of Sandoval (Table l).6 These samples allow us to place the end of the phase at about 900 b.c. and the beginning at about 1000 B.C. When the Cuadros and Jocotal dates are considered together, they span a 150-year-long period from 1000 to 850 B.C. More Cuadros and Jocotal sam ples are needed in order to accurately fix the boundary between the two phases. Nevertheless, the internal consistency among the dates from these phases is high. The Cuadros phase, first described by Coe and Flannery (1967) for the specialized estuary site of Salinas La Blanca, is now also represented at more generalized inland sites such as Aquiles Serdan and San Carlos (Clark et al. 1987). To date, test excavations have been carried out at 13 of the 44 known Cuadros-phase sites. The Cuadros phase represents the peak development of the Early Olmec tradition in the Pacific Coast region, with full-blown emulation, or possibly even importation, of ceramic, figurine, and other artifact styles that were found in many adjacent regions of Mesoamerica. At sites in the Maza tan region, for example, figurines were almost indistinguishable from those reported by Coe and Diehl (1980:272-273) at San Lorenzo. We have found both solid figurines as well as a few polished hollow baby-faced types known at this time in other parts of Mesoamerica (Figure 7j—1). Also, the redwares typical 6Samples B-21493, B-21494, and B-21496 were collected by J.F. Ceja Tenorio in 1974 for the New World Archaeological Foundation, but not submitted for dating until 1987.</page><page sequence="16">176 Blake et al. Figure 13.

At the larger sites, tecomates continued to decline in frequency to about 25% of the assemblage. At smaller sites within the estuaries, teco mates were almost the only vessel form found.

Reconstruction drawing of Cuadros-phase ceramic group from the Mazatan region. of burned clay floors in coastal estuary and riverine mound sites such as Salinas La Blanca (Coe and Flannery 1967:19-20), San doval, and Los Alvarez. Subsistence remains were as varied as in previous phases, with some evidence of cultivated plant use at Salinas la Blanca (Coe and Flannery 1967:71-73). However, stable-carbon-isotope analysis of three Cuadros-phase individuals still shows no evi dence of significant maize or other C4 plant consumption (Blake, Chisholm, Clark, Voorhies, and Love 1992). It is the in situ development of the Cuadros from the preced ing Mokaya tradition, especially Ocos and Cherla, that leads us to think of the Cuadros phase as the culmination of a long trend of local adoption, emulation, and importation of elite styles and goods found in many regions of Mesoamerica, rather than as a product of Olmec intrusion. This presupposes, of course, a local elite who were instigators of this emulation and cultural interaction (Demarest 1989; Flannery 1968). In the Mazatan region, the Cuadros-phase population grew larger than that of the preceding Cherla phase, with some new settlements forming and other previously occupied settlements shrinking or being abandoned. This may have been the result of the formation of a new tier of settlements creating a three level hierarchy. At least one new center formed along the Coa tan River that may have become the nucleus of a larger regional center during later times. JOCOTAL PHASE (900-850 B.C.) Like the preceding Cuadros phase, the Jocotal phase was orig inally defined by Coe and Flannery (1967) at Salinas La Blanca but, at the time, no datable radiocarbon samples were recov ered. We now know of 45 Jocotal-phase sites and have exca vated samples from 14 of them (Table 1). The two sites with dated Jocotal-phase material are El Mesak (Pye 1989) and Pampa EI Pajón (Paillés H. 1980). The four samples from these sites suggest that two of the previously mentioned Cuadros dates from Salinas la Blanca (Y-1151 and Y-1166 in Table 1) could actually be Jocotal in age. New radiocarbon samples will be nec essary in order to calculate more precisely and accurately the age and duration of each phase. Interestingly, Coe and Flannery thought the Jocotal phase to be short-lived and placed it between 850 and 800 B.C. Our analysis of Jocotal-phase radio carbon samples from a number of newly excavated sites confirm their basic conclusion about its short duration but would place it about 50 years earlier —from 900 to 850 b.c. However, Pye and Demarest (1989b) suspect that future analyses will show that the Jocotal phase is longer, at least in Guatemala, where some of the sites appear too large and stratigraphically complex to have formed in such a short period. Jocotal ceramic types are essentially those defined by Coe and Flannery (1967) at Salinas la Blanca and Green and Lowe (1967) at Altamira, but more recent excavations at El Mesak (Pye 1989), Aquiles Serdan, and San Carlos (Clark et. al 1987, 1990) have refined the list (Figures 16 and 17). Bowl and dish forms predominated, while tecomates dropped to about 15% of the assemblage, the lowest yet. Olmec-related motifs were more common than previously, and occurred with deeply carved designs on gray- and blackwares. Later Conchas-phase ceram ics had different Olmec motifs on predominantly white-slipped wares with shallow, fine incision scraping below the slip. The Jocotal phase is one of the most interesting in the sequence because it represents a period of significant population growth — almost double that of the previous phases (Clark and Blake 1994:23). Most of the sites in the Mazatan region, for example, have at least a scattering of Jocotal-phase ceramics on the sur face, while for others, Jocotal-phase ceramics dominate the sur face collections. We also have the first evidence of large regional centers with monumental construction during this phase. During the 1990 field season, members of the Mazatan Early Formative Project mapped and test excavated at the site of El Silencio on the Coatan River. The site has two enormous plat form mounds that were begun during the Jocotal phase. Mound 1 is estimated to be 100 m long and 3-4 m high, and Mound 2 is approximately 200 m long and 2 m high (Clark et al. 1990). These may have been ceremonial structures in a regional cen ter with a large sustaining population. In addition to the mon umental construction, several pieces of Olmec-style stone sculpture are known to have come from fields around the site.</page><page sequence="18">178 Blake et al. Figure 15.

Other sites, such as El Mesak, reveal more about the daily life of Jocotal villagers. Pye et al. (Pye 1989) excavated a sam ple of superimposed Jocotal layers at the site. They exposed 45 m2 of living floors showing posthole patterns, hearths, refuse pits, and other household debris. Analysis of the faunal remains has documented 28 species of bivalves and gastropods, two species of crab, and 24 species of vertebrates including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals (Wake 1989).</page><page sequence="19">Late Archaic and Formative radiocarbon chronology 179 Figure 16. Reconstruction drawing of Jocotal-phase ceramic group from the Mazatan region. The Jocotal phase, marking the transition from Early to Middle Formative, was a time of increasing sociopolitical dif ferentiation with regional settlement hierarchies, construction of long platform mounds in the centers, and the possible spon sorship of ceremonial-craft specialists who manufactured stone monuments. CONCHAS PHASE (850-650 b.c.) The Conchas phase represents a major shift from the preced ing Cuadros and Jocotal phases, even though there is clear evi dence for in situ development. The Conchas phase was first described —with two subphases: Conchas 1 and 2 —by M. Coe at La Victoria (Coe 1961:31-34), and has been substantially redefined on the basis of excavations by Love at the site of La Blanca (Love 1989a, 1993). Conchas deposits have been excavated at six sites, four of which have produced 10 radiocarbon samples (Table 1). Seven Early Conchas radiocarbon samples come from La Blanca, Huanacastal, and Sm-4 (Naranjo River). Of these, only one was excluded (B-24054 from La Blanca) as being significantly older in age than the rest of the samples. This allows us to estimate the Jocotal to Early Conchas subphase boundary at approxi mately 850 B.C., although Love (1993:21) argues that the earli est Conchas subphase at La Blanca possibly began by 900 b.c. This becomes somewhat problematic when Pye and Demarest (1989a) argue for a Jocotal phase that is longer than the 50 years allotted here. Clearly, more dated samples will be needed from both Jocotal and Early Conchas phase sites. The dated Late Conchas subphase deposits occur at La Blanca and Izapa and provide three dates. The Early Conchas to Late Conchas boundary is placed at about 750 B.C., while the ending date for the phase is placed at 650 B.C. These subphases are distinguished on the basis of changes in the decorative motifs and vessel forms of several ceramic types that occur throughout the phase (Love 1989a, 1993). In addition, some new types are added during each successive subphase.7 However, with the limited number of radiocarbon samples on hand it has not yet been practical to calculate the mean dates for each subphase and estimate the subphase boundaries. Also, while it is possible to determine the subphase association for ceramics at La Blanca, this has not yet been possible at all of the other previously excavated sites. Therefore, like Michael Coe before us, we have grouped the subphases into an Early Conchas subphase (which includes Love's La Blanca subphases A-C) and a Late Conchas subphase (which includes La Blanca sub phase D).8 The more densely nucleated population of the Conchas phase relied on a diversified subsistence base of agriculture, fishing, and hunting. However, important shifts are signaled by the in creased use of corn as an agricultural staple and the domestic dog as a source of meat protein (Blake, Chisholm, Clark, Voorhies, and Love 1992; Love 1989a). The increased emphasis on these two food sources reflects pressures for surplus produc tion. Other important economic changes include the importa tion of obsidian prismatic blades to supplement the household production of casual tools and the manufacture of specialized ceramic wares from kaolin clays. 7The principal ceramic wares that occur throughout the Conchas phase are: Alamo Red, Melendrez White, Melendrez Black, and Cuca Red-on-buff. The additional wares that appear in each subphase are: Ramirez Fine White and Ramirez Fine Black in Conchas B; Melendrez Red-on-white and Margarita Fine Red-on-white in Conchas C; Galindo Brown, Palmas Brown, and Mesilla Black in Conchas D. Changes in vessel forms and decorative motifs also occur in these wares through time. See Love (1993:22) for a more detailed discussion of the Conchas ceramic seriation and dating and for illustrations of the main ceramic types for the subphases. 8The small initial sample of Duende-phase ceramics from Izapa came from mixed construction fill deposits (Ekholm 1969:97). It now appears that Izapa Duende ceramics are closely related to the better documented Conchas D subphase ceramics at La Blanca. Therefore, in the present study, we have incorporated the Duende phase within the Late Conchas subphase.</page><page sequence="20">180 Blake et al. Figure 17. ]ocotal-phase sherds: (a) Culebra Gray incised jar neck; (b) Tiitepec Red-and-white incised dish; (c) Tacana White incised vase; (d) Pampas Black-and-white dish; (e) Siitepec White dish; (f) Tacana White carved vessel; (g) imported incised white vessel; (h) Xquic Red incised dish; (i) Tiitepec Red-and-white dish. The most significant demographic changes of the Conchas phase are the growth of population and its concentration around La Blanca near the Naranjo River (Love 1989a). The total known number of Conchas-phase sites in the Pacific Coast region is 70, with 56 of these located in the Naranjo River drainage (Love 1989a). La Blanca grew to be one of the largest sites in Meso america during the Middle Formative, and its importance is underscored by Mound 1, a monumental construction over 25 m in height and 100 m wide at the base. Shook's date for the mound (820 ± 70 B.C. [UM-102]; Table 1) suggests that it was</page><page sequence="21">Late Archaic and Formative radiocarbon chronology 181 an important structure even by Early Conchas times.9 The role of La Blanca as the dominant regional center is also marked by the presence of sculpture and fine ceramics with "Olmec-style" motifs (Love 1989b, 1991). In contrast, population shrank in the Coatan River zone, which became sparsely populated in comparison with its relatively high population in earlier phases (Clark and Blake 1994). DISCUSSION The chronological analysis presented here has allowed us to refine the Late Archaic and Early to Middle Formative culture historical sequence for the Pacific Coast of southeastern Meso america. It now permits a precise correlation of this sequence with some of the best-known chronologies in other parts of Mesoamerica, and these correlations are presented in Figure 4. Based on this analysis, two important points are worth empha sizing: (1) the Pacific Coast sequence is not an anomaly, neither precocious nor tardy, in comparison with other parts of the Mesoamerican culture area; and (2) the long sequence of cul tural development shows in situ evolution of local traditions as well as considerable periodic interaction with neighboring regions of Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of occupation occurs during the Chan tuto phase with the accumulation of large shell mounds along the coastal estuaries. These were specialized resource-collection sites that probably represent one element of a larger and more complex settlement-subsistence system. The major gap in our knowledge of the culture history occurs at the most recent end of the Archaic period. We do not yet know much about the transition from Archaic to Early Formative society— a situation that should be remedied by Voorhies's ongoing intensive survey and excavation at both estuary and inland sites (Voorhies 1994; Voorhies and Kennett 1995). The first ceramic-using settled villagers appeared during the Barra phase with the beginning of the Mokaya tradition. These semiagriculturists could have been descendants of the local Chantuto Archaic peoples who themselves were probably using a wide range of domesticable and cultivated plant species. How ever, it is also possible that the earliest Mokaya were immigrants to the area who settled at previously unoccupied sites in a poten tially underused region. They may also have brought with them knowledge of ceramic manufacture. The ultimate resolution of this question is, to us, not as inter esting as the question that asks, "How did the early Mokaya, after their development or arrival, evolve into one of the most distinctive of Early Formative societies in Mesoamerica?" Clark and Blake (1994) have argued elsewhere that the growing net work of Mokaya communities emerged during the Locona, Ocos, and Cherla phases as one of the clearest examples of the transition from egalitarian societies to simple chiefdoms. The roots of this transition lay in the appearance of competing "aggrandizers" —big men or incipient chiefs —exploiting a diverse range of aquatic and terrestrial resources in one of Meso america's most productive and predictable environments. Beginning in the Cherla phase, we see at some sites —such as Aquiles Serdan —the appearance of ceramic and figurine styles that are nearly identical to those reported for Early Olmec period sites including San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan. The timing of this trend is neither earlier nor later than in other parts of Meso america. The Mokaya people of coastal Chiapas, and perhaps also Guatemala, began more frequent and intensive participa tion in a range of interactions including exchange with and emu lation of neighboring Mesoamerican peoples. Many ceramic, figurine, and other artifact styles that once had been unique to the Pacific Coast died out and were replaced with items that had a greater similarity to those found in sites as far away as the Gulf Coast, highland Chiapas and Guatemala, Oaxaca, and other regions of highland Mexico (Clark and Blake 1989). This is not to say that the Pacific Coast was an outpost of Olmec col onizers who absorbed the region into an expanding empire; rather the Formative-period folk living along the Pacific Coast were becoming active participants in, and contributors to, an emerging and dynamic network of interacting "Olmec" chief doms (Demarest 1989). The rapid change in the styles of Formative-period ceram ics and other artifacts, perhaps resulting from this early emer gence and continuous development of chiefdoms, allowed us to distinguish eight archaeological phases in the space of a millen nium. The resulting average phase length of just over a century for the Early and Middle Formative phases outlined above pro vides a sufficiently precise chronological framework to begin asking new questions about the evolution of one of the earliest civilizations in Mesoamerica. 'Sample UM-102, from the main mound at La Blanca, was col lected by E. M. Shook in 1973, just before this important mound was leveled and carted away for road-construction material (Shook, personal communication 1988). RESUMEN Excavaciones arqueológicas conducidas durante los últimos cinco años a lo largo de la costa Pacífica de México, Guatemala y El Salvador han producido 79 fechas radiocarbónicas para los períodos arcaico tardío y formativo temprano a medio. Analizamos estas nuevas fechas junto con otras 25 ya publicadas para definir una secuencia de 10 fases arqueológicas que cubren casi tres milenios y medio, desde ca. 4000 hasta 650 a.C. Se sumarizan las fases con una breve descripción de sus carac terísticas más salientes. Incluimos ilustraciones de cerámica del período formativo temprano y figurillas de la región de Mazatan. La secuencia de fases revela una trayectoria de evolución cultural empezando en el período arcaico con los cazadores, pescadores y recolectores mobiles chantuto. Para el año 1550 a.C. las primeras comunidades sedentarias aparecieron en la costa de Chiapas. Estas fueron de cazadores y reco lectores que suplementaron su dieta con plantas cultivadas incluyendo maíz y frijoles. Sugerimos que, para la fase Locona (1400-1250 a.C.) en Chiapas, estas comunidades empezaron la transición de sociedades igualitarias a jefaturas simples, dejando evidencias de construcción arquitectónica a gran escala, objectos de intercambio a larga distancia como obsidiana y jade y bienes de prestigio elaborados. También en Chiapas, durante la fase Cherla (1100-1000 a.C.) aparecieron estilos de cerámica y figurillas casi idénticos a los encontrados en San Lorenzo Te nochtitlan en la costa del Golfo. Muchos de los estilos locales fueron gradualmente reemplazados con estilos de amplia distribución en Mesoamérica. La cronología presentada aquí muestra que estos cam bios fueron aproximadamente contemporáneos como cambios similares en regiones vecinas de Mesoamérica.</page><page sequence="22">182 Blake et al.
