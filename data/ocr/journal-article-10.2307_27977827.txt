<plain_text><page sequence="1">The burials at Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio: a bioarchaeological case study of imperialism from the capital of the inca empire Valerie A. Andrushko, Elva c. Torres Pino, and Viviana Bellifemine Comparison of the elite site of Sacsahuaman in the capital city of Cuzco with the site of Chokepukio, located nearby in the Lucre Basin, indicates that Inca imperial policies introduced rigid social stratification and division of Ubor. The results from Sacsahuaman show that elite status did not buffer individuah from diseases, particu larly with regards to inflammatory reactions of the long bones. Commoner individuals from Chokepukio dis played evidence of joint disease that may reflect arduous physical labor, perhaps as a result of labor tribute requirements. By increasing stress on subject popuUtions, Inca economic control may have impacted the health of the heal populace through arthritic conditions, in turn limiting the empires ability to maximize its return on labor-based tribute obligations. By incorporating a multidiscipUnary approach, this study reveals the biological effects of administrative policies on different sectors of society under Inca rule, and the consequences of these biological impacts on imperial endeavors.

Introduction Bioarchaeology, the study of human skeletal re mains in archaeological contexts, can provide a wealth of evidence for understanding diet, health and disease, warfare, social status, and population move ments (Larsen 1997). Particularly in the Andean re gion, where superior preservation conditions have aided in the accumulation of human remains for such studies, skeletal analyses have the potential to make Valerie A.

For Inca studies, bioarchaeological data rep resent a line of evidence into past human activity that complements knowledge derived from archaeo logical and historic sources. To date, relatively few osteological studies have been carried out in the Cuzco region (e.g., Eaton 1916; MacCurdy 1923), however recent excavations in and near Cuzco have produced samples of human remains now available for study. Within bioarchaeology, studies of imperialism constitute a growing sub-field investigating the bio logical effects of the rise, expansion, and collapse of empires. In addressing the ways in which imperial policies affected health in past populations, research ers explore factors such as diet, nutrition, and access to resources, the role of violence in imperialism, the effects of migration, and the spread of infectious dis ease in created urban environments (Tung 2006). Studies have also examined the empires role in the formation, preservation, and disruption of ethnic identity, through analysis of mortuary practices and cranial modification (Torres-Rouff 2003; Blom 2005). Examples from New and Old World societ ies have shown that no single consequence of impe rialism can be uniformly predicted; rather, numer ous factors may result in beneficial or detrimental changes to groups subsumed under an empire s con trol (e.g., Tung 2003; Buzon 2004; Nystrom 2005). Three fundamental questions underlie bioarch aeological inquiries into the health effects of imperi alism: (1) How did the rise of an empire affect health among subjected peoples? (2) How did the rise of an empire affect health among elite individuals within the empire? (3) How did the health effects of the empire on its subjects in turn affect the ability of the empire to function efficiently? As noted by D'Altroy (2006), in this burgeoning sub-field the first ques tion has been emphasized over the second in most bioarchaeological analyses, and the third question has been under-explored. The analysis presented here addresses each of these three questions by investigating the biological effects of the rise of the Inca Empire in the core re gion of the polity. The sites of Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio, located in and near the capital city of Cuzco, respectively (Figure 1), represent two very distinct manifestations of Inca imperial control. At Sacsahuaman, a number of Inca elites were buried in a sacred area of the site, their high status evident in elaborate mortuary treatment. In contrast, burials from Chokepukio represent a local population en gaged in agricultural work and craft production. The disparity in status between the two sites is made evi dent by the differentiated funerary practices, as well as by the general quality of life documented in the skeletal remains.

By incorpo rating a multidisciplinary approach with multiple lines of evidence from osteological data, statistical mortuary analysis, and ethnohistoric documents, this study reveals the biological effects of administrative policies on different sectors of society under Inca rule, and the consequences of these biological impacts on imperial endeavors. Archaeological Context The Inca Empire (a.D. 1438-1532) successfully es tablished wide-ranging and variable strategies of power, described as a "mosaic of control" (Schreiber 1992: 62), to rule over a broad territory encompass ing the modern day countries of Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, and northwestern Argentina. Politically, the Inca Empire functioned as a divine monarchy with regional administrators and an impressive military force focused on continual expansion. At the epi center of the empire, Cuzco served as the capital and locus of political power, from which the Inca wielded their authority through a variety of imperial adminis trative policies. Success in expansion largely depended on the empire s ability to fluidly apply diverse strate gies of control. These diverse strategies had distinct biological impacts that are explored in this study. Sacsahuaman Sacsahuaman, located on the open hillside above Cuzco, was originally considered to be a fortress when encountered by the Spanish, based on their precon ceptions of military construction and the three vast polygonal ramparts that compose the most visible section of Inca structures (Betanzos 1996: 155-158 [1577]). However, more recent site interpretations point to additional functions, including as a Temple of the Sun and public arena for state rituals (Espinoza 1987). The varied uses of the site are indicated by plazas, dwellings, temples, storehouses, roads, bas tions, watchtowers, and aqueducts. Guarnan Poma de Ayala refers to the significance of the site in three sections of his "El primer nueva cor?nica y buen gobierno" (1936: 337[339], 405[407], 641 [655] [1615]), and other chroniclers such as Cieza de Le?n (1984 [1533]) and Garcilaso de la Vega (1986 [1609]) describe Sacsahuaman as a Royal House of the Sun that played a vital role in the central work ings of the Inca Empire. In some accounts of Inca history, the emperor Pachacuti constructed the city of Cuzco in the shape of a puma, with Sacsahuaman as the "head" and the Coricancha as part of the body (Rowe 1968: 60). Other chronicles assert that Pachacuti s son Topa Inca built the "fortress" of Sacsahuaman in six years, be ginning construction four years after his return to the city of Cuzco following an uprising in the Collasuyo province (Betanzos 1996: 155 [1577]). Archaeological evidence appears to support Pachacuti's involvement in the site's inception, with construction continuing under Topa Inca (Niles 1999: 260; Julien 2004: 34). Though traditional archaeological projects have taken place periodically at Sacsahuaman, there have been no systematic analyses of skeletal remains from the site until excavations in 1999 uncovered the 43 individuals that were made available for this study. The burials were recovered from the Suchuna sector in the northwest corner of Sacsahuaman, which, along with the section known as the Qocha, is associated with the eighth huaca (shrine) named Calispuquio on the third ceque of the Chinchaysuyu quarter (Rowe 1980: 19; Solis 1999: 4). Each huaca was sym bolically located on ceque lines radiating from the center of Cuzco, with the Calispuquio huaca associ ated with the royal clan {panaca) of Topa Inca. In Rowe's (1946: 203) chronology, Topa Inca was the tenth king, reigning from a.d. 1470 to 1490, during which time the Calispuqio huaca was likely estab lished. The proximity of these burials to the Qocha and the huaca of Calispuquio indicates that this was probably an area of ceremonial significance. Areas of the Suchuna sector of Sacsahuaman had been previously excavated, though these findings were never formally reported (Solis 1999: 8). During the 1999 excavations, archaeologists did not attempt to recover the entirety of burials, but rather excavated a random sample established through a grid system (Solis 1999: 13). Based on the random sampling 65</page><page sequence="4">?awpa Pacha 28 methods, the burials reported here may be consid ered representative of the cemetery population. Chokepukio Chokepukio is a multi-component site located in the Lucre Basin, 30 km southeast of Cuzco. Data from archaeological excavations suggest that a small farm ing community occupied the site from at least 400 B.c. until the intrusion of the Wari (McEwan et al. 1995; Andrushko et al. 2000). During the Middle Horizon (a.D. 750-1000), the site was used by the Wari, evidenced by Wari style ceramics and shrines, and a local Qotakalli population (Barreda Murrillo 1973; McEwan 1987). In the subsequent Late Intermediate Period (LIP, a.D. 1000-1476), the Pinagua ethnic group con trolled the Lucre Basin region surrounding Chokepukio (Hiltunen and McEwan 2004: 246). During this time, the Pinagua constructed monu mental architecture in the form of niched-hall build ings at Chokepukio and used the site as a base of political power (McEwan et al. 2002: 294). These buildings show stylistic similarities to earlier niched hall structures at the Wari sites of Pikillacta and Viracocha Pampa (McEwan 1987; Topic and Topic 1992). Researchers have suggested that these Wari buildings served as lineage halls for ritual feasting based on analysis of the architecture and associated high-status artifacts; the presence of secondary buri als in these Wari buildings has been interpreted as ancestor worship (McEwan et al. 2002: 293). The niched hall buildings at Chokepukio appear to have served a similar purpose, indicated by parallels in architecture type and by the associated luxury items made of ceramic, metal, precious stones, and bone (McEwan et al. 1995). Within these buildings, sec ondary burials containing adult and sub-adult indi viduals may represent lineage ossuaries (Andrushko and Cordy-Collins 1999; McEwan et al. 2002: 294). While Chokeupkio retained ceremonial signifi cance in the Late Horizon (a.D. 1476-1532), its political significance diminished relative to earlier time periods. The large niched temples used in the LIP for feasting and alliance formation did not main tain their political function in the Late Horizon; rather, a series of small houses were constructed around the abandoned buildings to form a village, with no evidence of elite-status buildings (Hiltunen and McEwan 2004: 245). Most of the activities dur ing the Inca occupation involved pottery manufac ture, craft production, and agriculture (Chatfield 1999; Hiltunen and McEwan 2004: 245). Though the site lacks a distinct cemetery sec tion, certain areas around the LIP and Inca build ings were preferentially used for interment, and 176 individuals have been recovered in excavations con ducted from 1994 to 2004. Of these 176 individu als, 89 are derived from the Inca occupation. Tem poral and cultural affinity of the burials was deter mined by depth, architectural and artifact associa tions, tomb characteristics, and a small number of radiocarbon dates. The 89 Inca individuals from Chokepukio are described in the present study and compared to the contemporaneous burials from Sacsahuaman. Methods The 43 individuals from Sacsahuaman were studied in August 2005, while the Chokepukio skeletal as semblage was analyzed over several field seasons from 1999 to 2004 by V. Andrushko. Data were collected on age, sex, dental and skeletal conditions, and cra nial vault modification.1 The frequency of each patho logical condition was tabulated, analyzed for patterns based on age and sex, and compared between the two sites using the chi-square statistic. Specific attributes of mortuary treatment were recorded including tomb type, burial position, and artifact associations. Tombs were classified accord ing to their structural characteristics, and burials were 1 Data collection followed the methods employed by Bass (1987), Brothwell (1981), Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994), Lovejoy et al.

The number of individuals in each interment was recorded as single, double, or multiple. Other recorded at tributes included the position of the body (e.g., flexed or tightly flexed) and additional burial treatment, such as interment in vessels or in stone covered tombs. Artifacts found within the tombs were classi fied according to material (metal, ceramics, bone, stone, or shell) and morphology. The diversity of ar tifacts per burial was based on the number of differ ent types of implements in each tomb. All artifacts and interment attributes were checked for correla tion with age and sex, cross-tabulated, and included in a cluster analysis.2 Demography and Mortuary Analysis Demography?Sacsahuaman In the Sacsahuaman burial sample (Appendix 1), 29 individuals were female, 12 individuals were male, and two were of indeterminate sex.3 In terms of age distribution, this assemblage of 43 individuals con tained one juvenile (4-5 years) and 42 adults. The breakdown of ages within the adult categories was as follows: four young adults (18-25), 12 young middle adults (26-35), 16 old middle adults (36-45), seven old adults (46+), and three adults of indeterminate age (greater than 18 years). Demography?Chokepukio While the burials at Sacsahuaman skewed heavily toward the older adult female demographic, a very different distribution is present at Chokepukio (Fig ure 2; Appendix 2). The Chokepukio sex distribu tion shows 19 females, 30 males, and 40 individuals of indeterminate sex (mostly juveniles). In terms of age distribution, in this assemblage of 89 individuals there were 36 juveniles and 53 adults. Among the 36 juveniles, six were less than one year old, 22 were between 1-12 years, and eight were between 12-18 years of age at the time of death. The age distribu tion within the adult category was five young adults (18-25), nine young middle adults (26-35), 16 old middle adults (36-45), seven old adults (46+), and 16 adults of indeterminate age (greater than 18). The average adult age at death was 36.3 years at Sacsahuaman and 34.2 years at Chokepukio. The demographic profile suggests that the Choke pukio burial grounds were available to all members of the population, young and old, male and female. The presence of only one juvenile at Sacsahuaman con trasts dramatically with Chokepukio, where 40% of the burials are aged 0-18 years.4 While Chokepukio represents a balanced distribution of all sex and age groups, at Sacsahuaman the demographic profile ap pears artificially biased in terms of both age and sex. 2 Statistical methods for the mortuary analysis followed Bellifemine (1997). Statistical significance for a correlation was taken to be at the 95% confidence level. Cross-tabula tions were also used to identify other possible correlations among variables (e.g., diversity vs. tomb type). Hierarchical cluster analysis, used to simplify the dataset by grouping cases into "clusters" with some form of similarity among them, was applied to artifact data using Ward's method of agglomerative clustering technique (Sneath and Sokal 1973). 3 Because the sex distribution is skewed towards females, a re view of sex determination methods was necessary to rule out methodological error. The Phenice method was employed as the most accurate estimator of sex in the 12 cases with pre served pubic symphyses. In the absence of the pubic Sym physis, the greater sciatic notch and other pelvic characteris tics were assessed in conjunction with cranial and mandibular characteristics (19 cases). In the five cases where the pelvis was not preserved, only the cranium and mandible were used as indicators of sex. In one adult individual sex could not be determined due to lack of elements. In all cases, overall robusticity of the skeletal elements and metric assessments of the femoral and humeral heads and other joint surfaces aided in identifying sex. With 72% (31/43) of the individu als sexed either by the Phenice method or by pelvic charac teristics along with cranial and mandibular characteristics, the skewed sex determination does not appear to have re sulted from methodological error; rather, this sex distribu tion likely reflects cultural factors. 4 The sex and age differences between Chokepukio and Sacsahuaman are statistically significant (p = 0.002 and = 0.000, respectively). 67</page><page sequence="6">?awpa Pacha 28 I Sacsahuaman iChokepukio Figure 2. Comparison of Demographic Profiles. Mortuary Analysis?Sacsahuaman Funerary Structures and Mode of Interment. In the Sacsahuaman Suchuna cemetery sector, forty ovoid tombs measuring approximately 60 cm in di ameter at the base and 80 cm high were exposed during excavation and categorized into three differ ent types: A, B, and C (Solis 1999: 12). The type A tomb, composed of stone and mortar, was only seen in one case and was the least frequent type (2%). Type tombs (17/40, 43%) featured walls approxi mately 20 cm thick that tapered at the top, composed of brown clay mortar with small gravel inclusions. Type C tombs, constructed of brown clay mortar with a greater amount of gravel inclusions, totaled 55% of the sample (22/40). Chronologically, type C tombs appear to represent the earliest burial form, followed by contemporaneous use of type A and tombs (Solis 1999: 13). Most of the individuals were in situ primary inhumations, positioned in a seated posture with tightly flexed limbs. The majority were single inter ments, while three tombs contained two burials each. The tombs had been sealed following interment, and most contained burned organic material, consisting of vegetable matter, carbonized maize kernels, and chunks of carbon; in some instances similar burned material was collected from outside the structures. These external deposits appear to represent offerings presented to the dead after the tombs were sealed, in reiterative ceremonies conducted during periodic revisitations to the grave (Solis 1999: 22). Artifact Assemblage. An assemblage of 201 burial artifacts was recovered during the 1999 exca vations at Sacsahuaman (Appendix 3), including pieces of metal (127), ceramic vessels (49), shells (15), faunal bones (6), stones (3), and wood (1). The rich ness in burial artifacts is exemplified by Burial 3, an old adult male (46+ years) with 61 artifacts that in cluded a large number of metal beads. Metal mir rors, also referred to as "pectoral plaques" (Julien 2004: 25), appear to signify high status, as the three individuals buried with mirrors had overall rich ar rays of artifacts. Statistical correlations indicate that decorated artifacts, mirrors, and an overall high diver sity of artifacts served as indicators of high status.5 5 There exists a statistically significant correlation between di versity and the presence of decorated artifacts (p = 0.035): no decorated artifacts were present with individuals having artifact diversities between 1 and 4, while those with arti fact diversities greater than 4 all had decorated artifacts. A statistically significant correlation (p = 0.005) also exists between the diversity of artifacts and the presence of mirrors. 68</page><page sequence="7">Andrushko, Torres, Belli/emine: Burials at Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio Similar to Juliens (2004: 28) findings, the arti fact assemblage features the occurrence of paired ce ramic types, especially with plates, Cuzco bottles (artbalos), and Cuzco jars (urpus). Pedestalled dishes with covers {olUs) and tripod toasters were only re covered in their undecorated forms, suggesting that these types were mostly associated with cooking ac tivities (Julien 2004: 27). The pedestalled dish with lid may have a gender connotation, as this ceramic type was recovered only from female burials.6 After separating the "classic" tupu (pin with a round or semi-circular head) from alfileres (small headed pins), no statistical correlation was found between the type of pin and biological sex. Of the 13 individuals buried with alfileres, five were males and eight were females. Of the 13 individuals buried with tupus, three were males and ten were females.7 No correlation with size or number of tupus was found, and the overall analysis shows that tupu pins were included with both sexes in this particular burial population. Cluster analysis tests identified a group formed by eight females with a specific set of artifacts, each buried with tupus, metal objects, ceramics, copper objects, decorated objects, and personal ornaments (items for personal care and adornment). In contrast, none of them had lithics, bone, shell, silver, metal foils, beads of any material, small mirrors, tumis (shaped blades), or wood. These particular women may represent a sub-group within the population, recipients of specific funerary treatment, based on the supposition that differentiation among grave as sociations appears to symbolize class and status lev els attained during life and accentuated at death (Saxe 1970; Binford 1971; Julien 2004: 44). In sum, the individuals from the Sacsahuaman cemetery were interred in well-prepared tombs fur nished with a wide array of artifacts in most cases. The presence of tupu pins, in the majority of cases together with some textile remains, indicates that the bodies were wrapped in garments prior to interment. 6 However, this correlation was not found to be statistically significant (p = 0.088). 7 Given the disproportionate number of females in this sample, this distribution is not significant. No artifacts were found to present a sex-based, sta tistically significant correlation. However, a group of females possessed a distinctive assemblage of items that may reflect social divisions within the burial group. Class differentiation within this group of in dividuals is also indicated by the inclusion of the decorated artifacts in graves with a diverse array of objects. Although gold was not recovered from any of the tombs, the decorated ceramic vessels, artifacts of silver and Spondylus shells, and structured tombs identify this Sacsahuaman cemetery as a resting place for a highly regarded sector of society, especially when compared to the mortuary practices at Chokepukio. Mortuary Analysis?Chokepukio Mode of Interment and Special Burial Treat ment. Burial type at Chokepukio could only be de termined for 60 of the 89 individuals, of which 60% were primary inhumations and 40% were secondary inhumations; 50% were single interments, 20% were double, and 30% contained multiple individuals. Position was determined for 26 individuals, most fre quently found in tightly-flexed and flexed positions. Individuals at Chokepukio were rarely recovered in prepared tombs, but rather found tucked into cor ners of older buildings, placed into small rooms, and interred in superficial graves. However, a few indi viduals show special burial treatment that distin guishes them from the majority. Three cases of "cist" type tombs?tombs lined with stones and/or plaster? were found, containing an adult male, adult female, and a 2-3 year old juvenile. The interment of indi viduals in ceramic vessels was also encountered in a few instances, including both adult secondary inter ments in large vessels and juvenile primary burials in smaller ceramic containers. One distinctive group of burials excavated dur ing the 2004 field season at Chokepukio is an as semblage of seven individuals between the ages of 3 and 11 years, mostly centered in the 5-6 year range. These children were found together, wrapped tightly with textiles and rope, and interred with a large num ber of artifacts. These burials may represent a unique ceremonial event, and are currently undergoing fur ther study including isotopie analysis (Gibaja et al. 69</page><page sequence="8">?awpa Pacha 28 2005). For the present study, this small child assem blage and the secondary adult burials found in asso ciation have been removed from the artifact analysis, as these burials represent anomalous cases that are not representative of the treatment of the majority of the population. Artifact Assemblage. Excluding the special as semblage as noted above, 62 individuals had infor mation recorded on artifact associations, and of these 37% (n=23) were buried with artifacts of bone, ce ramics, lithics, and metal (Appendix 4). Within this sample, the diversity of artifacts ranged from 1 to 4.8 The Chokepukio individual with the highest quan tity and diversity of artifacts was Burial 104, an adult female buried in a plaster-lined circular cist tomb and interred with two large ceramic pots, a miniature ceramic vessel, a seedpod whistle, and stone pendants. Our mortuary analysis supports the interpreta tion that individuals at Chokepukio were of lower status than those at Sacsahuaman. Grave goods are uncommon, and when present usually consist of small personal items such as tupu pins or refuse items such as small ceramic sherds and obsidian flakes. The com parison of tomb type, artifact count, and diversity of artifacts indicates that individuals at Chokepukio had far fewer and less elaborate grave furnishings (Table l).9 These characteristics show that the occupants of Sacsahuaman were of a higher social class than those individuals buried at Chokepukio. Since both groups were living at the same time period under the same general climatic conditions, disparities observed between the two sites should reflect cultural factors related to life within different social spheres. In com paring the two sites, we see significant variation in dental and skeletal disease frequencies and cultural modification practices. Comparison of Dental and Skeletal Conditions at Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio Dental Pathology The study of dental conditions is essential for recon structing diet and understanding processing activi ties associated with cultural behavior. Variations in diet lead to changes in the frequency and severity of dental pathological conditions; for example, the in crease of carbohydrates in the diet correlates with higher rates of carious lesions, commonly known as cavities (Powell 1985). In the Andes, one important dietary variable was the introduction and intensifi Table 1. Comparison of Artifact Distribution between Chokepukio and Sacsahuaman.

Overall, the measure of artifact diversity did not correlate with sex, age, or spatial distribution, and clus ter analysis for artifacts did not yield any significant results. 9 These differences are all statistically significant at greater than 99.9% confidence level. 70</page><page sequence="9">Andrushko, Torres, Bellifemine: Burials at Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio cation of maize. Maize appears to have been intro duced in the Andes in the 3rd century B.c., became incorporated as an important crop in the Middle Horizon, and by the Late Horizon was the dietary staple of the Inca Empire (Hastorf and Johannessen 1994: 430; Finucane et al. 2006). As maize became a more important component of the diet, its high carbohydrate levels produced an increase in the fre quency of carious lesions, leading to a suite of condi tions including abscesses (bacterial infection of the center of a tooth) and tooth loss (Leigh 1937: 293). The Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio samples follow this general pattern of carious lesions, abscesses, and antemortem tooth loss. Attrition, the wearing away of tooth crowns due to heavy chewing (Smith 1984), was recorded in the two burial populations in both permanent and deciduous dentitions. In the Sacsahuaman adult sample, the high fre quency of carious lesions, with 79% of individuals in the sample affected, suggests a carbohydrate-in tensive diet of maize. Maize is known to have a high amount of sucrose, and this simple sugar is more likely to cause dental caries than other, more complex car bohydrates (Larsen et al. 1991: 185). In 64% of the sample, carious lesions destroyed the tooth crown such that bacterial infection ensued, resulting in ab scesses. Eighty-two percent of the individuals exhib ited alveolar r?sorption, bone loss in the maxilla and mandible due to soft tissue inflammation (Periodon titis). Three individuals showed an abnormal pattern of wear on the lingual surfaces of the anterior teeth: this deviation from the normal wear pattern possibly indicates the use of teeth as tools during weaving or other manual activities. Two other individuals exhib ited linear enamel hypoplasias, which result when growth disturbances disrupt enamel production (Jenkins 1978). Because tooth crown development occurs between infancy and 7 years of age for per manent incisors, canines, and first molars, linear de fects in these teeth indicate disruptions that occurred during childhood (Goodman and Martin 2002: 22). Hypoplasias may result from nutritional deficiencies or diseases that strain an individual's metabolism, thus providing evidence of stress in populations (Goodman and Rose 1991; Hillson 2000: 252). At Chokepukio, analysis of dental pathological conditions reveals a similar pattern of carious lesions, abscesses, and antemortem tooth loss (Figure 3). However, the Sacsahuaman population shows a higher frequency of each of the conditions compared to Chokepukio.10 Skeletal Pathology The documentation of skeletal pathological condi tions represents a crucial aspect of bioarchaeological investigations of imperialism. Cultural change with increased sedentism can result in a higher frequency of skeletal markers of stress, as populations come into closer contact with viral, bacterial, and parasitic in fections from accumulated waste and water contami nation (Armelagos 1990). Several archaeological stud ies have indicated that the intensification of agricul ture negatively impacted health in some populations by introducing a less nutritional diet with reliance on cereal grains, producing increased evidence of anemia-related conditions (Cohen and Armelagos 1984; Larsen 1997: 35). When documented as part of the overall "health index" for a population (Steckel et al. 2002), stress markers visible on bones can pro vide a broad understanding of health, stress, and dis ease processes at the regional level. One example of a stress marker is cribra orbitalia, characterized by scattered lesions on the roof of the eye orbits, which reflects anemia (Goodman and Martin 2002: 27). At Sacsahuaman, the lone juve nile individual from Sacsahuaman exhibited cribra orbitalia in the active state, indicating that the con dition was on-going at the time of death. The same individual was documented with delayed long bone growth, as the age determined from dental develop ment was several years older than the age from long bone length (based on Ubelakers [1999] long bone length charts for Native Americans). When such a large discrepancy arises, it usually reflects stunted growth due to nutritional deficiency or disease events suffered during development (Tanner 1978). These two conditions fall into the category of "non-specific" These differences are statistically significant for carious le sions (p = 0.009), abscesses (p = 0.004), alveolar r?sorption ( = 0.024), and antemortem tooth loss (p = 0.043). 71</page><page sequence="10">?awpa Pacha 28 H Sacsahuaman Choke pukio Carious Abscesses Antemortem Alveolar Lesions Tooth Loss Resorption Figure 3.

In the Sacsahuaman adult sample, spinal joint disease and arthritic condi tions in the long bone joints were com monly-seen conditions (Table 2).11 In addition, nine individuals displayed healed traumatic injuries in the long bones, cranium, and/or ribs.12 Long bone fractures were more com monly found in type A and tombs than type C tombs;13 as the type A and tombs represent later burials in the Sacsahuaman cemetery, it appears that the increase in long bone fractures was a later mani festation.

Osteoperiostitis can be due to a variety of causes, including treponemal disease (e.g., syphilis), bacte rial and parasitic infection, and mycotic (fungal) in fection (Ortner and Putschar 2003). In extreme cases, inflammation manifests in pus production, expan sion of the bone shaft, and formation of a cloaca, an opening in the diseased bone for pus drainage; these conditions are collectively referred to as osteomyeli tis (Larsen 1997: 84). Traumatic injuries can lead to Osteoperiostitis through soft tissue wounds and com pound fractures in which the bone breaks through the skin and exposes the injured area to infection (Lewis and Roberts 1997). In cases where trauma is 72</page><page sequence="11">Andrushko, Torres, Belli/emine: Burials at Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio not involved, systemic blood-borne infections may cause Osteoperiostitis in several long bones of an in dividual (Martin et al. 1991: 128). In contexts of urbanism and aggregated living conditions, Osteope riostitis may increase due to heightened transmission of bacterial infections (Larsen 1997: 86). In the Sacsahuaman assemblage, Osteoperiosti tis was observed in both active and healed states. In 12 instances, the long bones of the upper and lower limbs exhibited this condition. In addition to the long bone Osteoperiostitis, one individual at Sacsahuaman was observed with active Osteoperiostitis on the in ternal surface of all the ribs. Though internal rib le sions can signify tuberculosis, the other skeletal ele ments did not exhibit any lesions typically seen with tuberculosis (Ortner and Putschar 2003: 229; Rob erts and Buikstra 2003), suggesting either an incipi ent case of tuberculosis without vertebral or other post-cranial lesions or, conversely, a non-specific in fectious cause for the rib osteoperiostis. The comparison of disease frequencies between Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio shows some distinct patterns. With the juvenile population, it is difficult to contrast the two sites, as only one juvenile was buried at Sacsahuaman. However, we can observe that non-specific stress indicators, including cribra orbitalia and delayed long bone growth, affected ju veniles in both places (Table 3). There are significant differences in disease fre quencies when comparing the skeletal conditions of Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio adults (Figure 4). In studying appendicular joint disease, commonly known as arthritis, six post-cranial joints were examined: the shoulder, elbow, wrist/hand, hip, knee, and ankle/ foot. This condition was identified by the presence of bony spurs, polish from bone-on-bone contact, Table 3. Comparison of Juvenile (&lt;18 years) Skeletal Pathology.

Joint disease was observed in 40% of the Chokepukio adults but only 17% of the Sacsahuaman adults.14 Spinal joint disease, identified by bony growths around the vertebral body along with ebur nation and macroporosity on the joint facets, was found in 53% of the Chokepukio adult sample but only 36% of the Sacsahuaman adults.15 Joint disease is a degenerative pathological con dition that more frequently afflicts older adults (Jurmain 1999). Chokepukio has a higher frequency of joint disease, though the individuals with joint disease died at an earlier average age than those at Sacsahuaman: 36.4 years at Chokepukio vs. 42.9 years at Sacsahuaman.16 This age difference reveals that joint disease at Chokepukio affected individuals earlier in life than at Sacsahuaman. In contrast, Osteoperiostitis was more often seen at Sacsahuaman: 30% of individuals affected com pared to 13% at Chokepukio.17 Osteoperiostitis af fecting a single element in a localized area usually signifies a traumatic cause; in contrast, generalized periosteal reaction on several long bone shafts often indicates systemic infection (Martinetal. 1991: 128). In eight of the 13 individuals with Osteoperiostitis at Sacsahuaman, more than one bone per person ex hibited inflammatory reactions, suggesting that sys temic infection was more often the cause of this con dition than traumatic injury. Though not included in the present study, the pre-Inca in dividuals at Chokepukio show a lower frequency of joint disease (approximately 17%). The differences in appendicular joint disease between the sites is stat istically significant (p = 0.015), though there are no statistically significant differences of these conditions when tabulated by sex. The lack of correlation between joint disease and sex at either site indicates that the disparity in sex distribution between the two sites is not a causal factor for the differential incidence of joint disease. Average age-at-death here refers only to individuals afflicted with joint disease. This difference is statistically significant, = 0.035. Cranial Vault Modification Cranial vault modification involves the intentional shaping of the head, performed during infancy while the cranial bones are still malleable (Gerszten 1993; Torres-Rouff2003). As cranial vault modification sig nified ethnic identity and geographic origins in pre historic Andean groups, the presence of multiple forms of cranial vault modification can be used to identify a multi-ethnic community, perhaps due to migration of non-local people into an area (Blom 1999; Torres-Rouff 2002). Only two individuals at Sacsahuaman, both female, exhibited cranial vault modification, in a slight tabular erect form. In tabu lar erect modification, opposing pressure is placed on the front and back of the cranium, often accom plished through the use of boards and pads, which leads to lateral expansion of the cranium (Torres Rouff 2003: 14). At Chokepukio, cranial vault modi fication was seen more frequently and with greater variation, including the annular oblique form (Table 4). With annular oblique modification, the cranium is wrapped tightly with cloth or rope, leading to an elongated, conical shape without parietal expansion (Marino and Gonzales-Portillo 2000: 943). Around the altiplano region of Lake Titicaca, the annular oblique style of cranial modification was practiced until Spanish conquest, when it was out lawed by Viceroy Toledo's (1569-1582) government (Marroquin 1944). Cobo describes the modification of the cranium by the Colla of the Lake Titicaca region: The Collas made their heads long and pointed . . . they bound their heads tightly with ban dages which were left in place until the chil dren were four or five years old. By this age, their heads were hardened and molded to the shape of their headgear: long, tapering, and without a nape (1990: 200 [1653]). In contrast, Cobo notes that "some nations wid ened their foreheads. They would squeeze their heads by securely tying on small boards to make their fore heads wide" (ibid). This type of modification refers to the tabular modification seen in the Chokepukio sample and in two individuals from the Sacsahuaman group. 74</page><page sequence="13">Andrushko, Torres, Bellifemine: Burials at Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio Table 4.

Type of Modification # of Individuals # of Individuals Modified at Sacsahuaman Modified at Chokepukio Cranial Vault Modification 2 Tabular Erect 5 Tabular Erect 5 Annular Oblique Discussion Mortuary Treatment, Gender Roles, and Status in the Inca Empire A separate Sacsahuaman collection, compiled by Varcarcel in the 1930s and analyzed by Catherine Julien (2004), provides a useful sample for compari son to the present study. Julien suggests that certain artifacts denote a sex distinction, mainly tupus and cooking-related ceramics interred with females but excluded from male burials, based on inferences from Spanish chronicles. In Guarnan Pomas (1936 [1615]) depictions of Inca attire, females wrapped woven garments around their torsos, fastening the cloth with a tupu pin at each shoulder and one at the chest for the outer garment, along with a cloth belt around the waist. While Julien concludes that tombs with tupu pins contain female individuals (2004: 31), no skeletal data from Varcarceli collection were avail able to aid in interpretation. In our analysis, tupu pins were found with both biological males and fe males, and in many instances appear in pairs in burials of both males and females. In several cases, multiple tupu pins are associated with a single individual. For example, in our study, one adult male had three tupu pins and five afileres (two pairs and a single pin) with in a tomb in which no other individual was interred. Betanzos (1996: 142 [1557]) noted that females were buried with dishes, plates, and other ceramics related to the service of food and drink. However, our research found a correlation with females only in the case of the pedestalled dish with lid, commonly associated with cooking activities (Julien 2004: 27). All other ceramic types recovered in more than one tomb were found with both males and females. Most of the grave-associated ceramics were miniatures that were likely produced solely as mortuary inclusions. Production of miniature vessels for grave goods ap pears to have developed as a sub-industry in parallel with production of fine Inca pottery in major ce ramic workshops around Cuzco (Bauer 2004: 216). Our analysis of the Sacsahuaman burials classi fies it as an elite cemetery where high status indi viduals were interred in prepared tombs with a wide diversity of grave associations. Differences in quan tity and types of associated artifacts suggest distinct funerary treatment according to an individual s sta tus or occupation. The sex distribution is skewed with a predominance of females (70%); in addition, there is only one juvenile represented among 43 individu als in the sample. The demographic profile appears related to cultural factors: rather than reflecting a large community of all ages and both sexes as seen at Chokepukio, the Sacsahuaman cemetery is comprised almost exclusively of adult individuals with an excess of females. Of particular interest in the Sacsahuaman burial sample is the high percentage of female burials, likely elite females given their elaborate mortuary treatment. Multiple interpretations for the identity of these fe males are possible. The surplus of females may indi cate a burial place for the many wives and sisters of the Inca. The Inca emperor had a principal wife, known as the Qpya (often his full sister), along with a harem of secondary wives (Rowe 1946: 257). While the Inca emperor s and principal wife's mummies were venerated after death and publicly paraded around during festivals (D'Altroy 2002: 97), much less is known about the burial treatment and location of the emperor's secondary wives. Each emperor may have had a place where his other wives were buried, with the Suchuna sector of Sacsahuaman serving as either the burial place of Topa Incas wives or those of a subsequent ruler. As Cieza noted in his chronicle regarding elite burials (1984: 196 [1533]), "in the vicinity of Cuzco they bury their dead seated . . . 75</page><page sequence="14">?awpa Pacha 28 dressed and adorned with much finery." This descrip tion closely matches the burial position and associ ated artifacts of the Sacsahuaman burials. However, none of the burials had artifacts of gold, a material that Julien argues would be ubiqui tous in the graves of the empire s highest status indi viduals (2004: 33, 44). The mummies of the Inca rulers and primary wives were adorned with gold and silver upon burial, but were stripped of their luxury items when Cuzco was conquered by the Spanish (MacCormack 2001: 342). As the Sacsahuaman tombs showed no evidence of looting, the absence of gold would suggest that these females were not wives of an emperor. Instead, these burials could be the wives of other Inca elites; polygyny among the Inca nobility was common, and a surplus of wives reflected a mans wealth and prestige (Rowe 1946: 252). These wives would be expected to have elaborate burials, but possibly without the greatest of luxury items such as gold adornments. Alternatively, the overwhelming number of fe males in the Sacsahuaman cemetery may represent a group of mamacona, women employed at the royal estates of the Inca to assist in training the aclla ("Cho sen Women") (Rowe 1982: 107; Guarnan Poma 1936: 298 [300] [1615]). Young girls were chosen across the empire as a form of tribute to the Inca, and were often daughters of nobility selected for their beauty (Cobo 1990: 172 [1653]). From the age of 10 years, the girls lived in segregated enclaves {acllahuasi, "House of the Chosen Women") and were instructed in religious and occupational duties by the mamacona (esteemed mothers) who served as priest esses in the state cult of the Sun (Cobo 1990: 172 [1653]). Daily activities for the aellas included reli gious worship, spinning and weaving of the finest cloth (cumpi) used to dress idols and clothe the Inca nobility, and brewing of maize beer (chicha) for cel ebrations and offerings (Costin 1998: 134). Some of the young aclh girls were selected for sacrifice on special occasions, while others were given away as brides to men who had served the empire well (Rowe 1946: 269, 1982: 108). Still other aclla remained in the acllahuasi throughout their lives and took on the role of mamacona (Silverblatt 1987: 83). In some instances these priestesses were allowed to participate in or conduct religious services, but usually were kept cloistered to serve the Inca ruler and queen (Betanzos 1996:74 [1577]); Cobo 1990: 174 [1653]). In Cuzco, the aclhhuasi was located within the Hatuncancha edifice adjacent to the main plaza (D'Altroy 2002: 117), less than half a kilometer from Sacsahuaman. Though the presence of men in the Sacsahuaman cemetery shows that this area was not exclusively used for female members, it was evidently designated more often for females at the elite levels of the state than for males. The demographic distribution of the cem etery deviates from the normal distribution expected of a community burial ground, which may reflect the segregated arrangement of the mamacona living without children or marriage partners. Imperial Control, Social Stratification, and Health The analysis of Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio buri als sheds light on the impact of imperial Inca control on the health of different segments of society. In view ing dental disease across sites, there is a similar pat tern of pathological conditions including carious le sions, abscesses, and antemortem tooth loss, yet for each of these conditions the Sacsayhauman frequen cies are higher than those at Chokepukio. As dental diseases are cumulative, the older average age of the Sacsahuaman individuals likely contributed to these higher frequencies (average age 36.3 years at Sacsahuaman vs. 34.2 years at Chokepukio).18 How ever, the slight average age differences between the two samples paired with the statistically significant disparity in dental conditions suggest additional causal factors; variation in diet may be responsible for the observed differences in the two sites. Carbon isotopie analyses have shown that maize became the main food staple in the Late Horizon and was particularly widespread in the Cuzco Valley (Hastorf and Johannessen 1993; Burger et al. 2003: 135). The Inca deified maize as part of the state wor ship of the Sun and used it extensively in their ritu als, primarily in the form of chicha (maize beer) (Niles The average age-of-death here includes all individuals at the two sites, and differs from the average age-of-death cited for those individuals with joint disease. 76</page><page sequence="15">Andrushko, Torres, Bellifemine: Burials at Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio 1993). Chicha, more than any other foodstuff, sym bolized the connection of the Inca to the Sun deity and was used to mediate all social, ideological and political interactions (Hastorf and Johannessen 1994: 437). Elite individuals living in the capital city of Cuzco likely consumed a diet with greater indulgence in chicha, corn stews, and other maize-based foods, with the maize intensive-diet resulting in high caries frequency. Possibly the lower-status individuals at Chokepukio consumed diets that included lesser amounts of maize, thus ameliorating some of its del eterious effects on dental health. Regarding skeletal pathological conditions, both sites provide instances of anemia-related conditions such as cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis. A major cause of anemia is parasitic infection, known to have occurred in ancient populations throughout the New and Old Worlds (Reinhard 1992). Parasites documented from prehistoric Andean contexts in clude fish tapeworm, pinworm, roundworm, and whipworm (Reinhard and Urban 2003); one or more of these parasites may have detrimentally impacted the health of the Cuzco Valley populations. Diar rheal disease in juvenile individuals following wean ing, as children shift from a diet of sterile breast milk to possibly contaminated solid foods, has also been identified as a significant cause of anemia (Walker 1985). Additionally, contaminated water sources can contribute to diarrheal diseases resulting in porotic hyperostosis (Walker 1986). The observed anemia related conditions may also be due to a maize-in tense diet, which is low in iron and contains phytic acid that inhibits iron absorption in the intestine (Hurrell 2002; Klepinger 1992). If the diet is not properly varied and no other iron sources exist, a condition of anemia could appear that would mani fest in cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis. A variety of other nutrient deficiencies such as Vita min C or folie acid can also lead to cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis, indicating ill health due to an incomplete diet (Ortner et al. 1999; Wapler et al. 2004). Both Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio showed evidence of anemia-related conditions, though at a low frequency, suggesting that parasitic infection and/ or maize-intensive diets due to the deification of maize by the empire (Niles 1993) and use of the crop as a food staple (Burger et al. 2003: 135) had uninten tional health consequences for some individuals in the Cuzco Valley. Joint disease, which appeared more frequently at Chokepukio, generally increases in populations engaged in physically demanding activities (Steckel et al. 2002: 146), but is also heavily influenced by other factors such as age, heredity, and body weight (Jurmain 1999; Jurmain and Weiss, in press). In all bioarchaeological analyses of joint disease, age dif ferences between samples must be corrected in order to isolate the influence of age on joint disease fre quency. Joint disease afflicted individuals at Choke pukio at an earlier age than at Sacsahuaman, sug gesting that the high frequency of joint disease at Chokepukio does not merely reflect age-related de generative changes, but rather involves other precipi tating factors. In studying joint disease, the multiple causes of the condition limit the extent to which behavioral interpretations can be drawn (Weiss 2005: 96; Jurmain and Weiss, in press). Nevertheless, the dif ferences in joint disease observed between the two sites may indicate differential activity patterns among the occupants of the two sites. The Inca Empire im posed tribute obligations, in the form of mita labor; examples include construction of public works, ser vice in the army, and agricultural work in state fields (Murra 1982). Labor obligations, particularly in the form of intensified agricultural production, brought increased demands on subject populations and greatly impacted the domestic economy of the local people brought under Inca rule (Hastorf and D'Altroy 2001 : 22). The increase in joint disease at Chokepukio from pre-Inca to Inca times (from approximately 17% to 40%) may be related to the Late Horizon commu nity engaging in arduous activities such as agricul ture and construction to fulfill state tribute require ments. These labor obligations would not only have impacted the health of the local population, but also may have affected the empires ability to maximize its tribute collection: obligatory labor that debilitated the work force could have translated into a popula tion of strained individuals who were working at a sub-optimal level. The Inca policy determined tribute obligation based on length of time, not on a minimum 77</page><page sequence="16">_?awpa Pacha 28_ amount of commodities produced (Murra 1980 [1955]). If individuals were compromised due to the increased physical demands, the overall net result would have been diminished tribute collections and fewer resources available for the empire to fuel its expansion. In contrast, Osteoperiostitis occurred more of ten at Sacsahuaman. Precipitating factors of systemic Osteoperiostitis include compromised individual im mune systems, dense population aggregation, and unsanitary hygienic conditions (Larsen 1997: 87). While these conditions would not be expected for elite individuals living in the Inca capital of Cuzco, a similar pattern of Osteoperiostitis in elite individuals was documented from a Moche Valley site (Yoshida 2004: 138). Yoshida concluded that high status did not shield individuals from chronic infection due to crowding, water contamination, or poor sanitation. In addition, if our sample represents a population of cloistered women working for the state, their enclosed living arrangements may have contributed to an in creased transmission of infectious disease. Another possibility arises when considering that the capital city of Cuzco hosted a wide range of immigrants, with individuals coming to the capital from various parts of the empire. Thus, heightened contact with outside individuals may have increased the spread of infectious disease (Larsen 1997: 86), perhaps result ing in a generally higher frequency of Osteoperiosti tis in Cuzco-centric populations. Cranial vault modification was seen in more in dividuals with greater variation at Chokepukio, indica ting an ethnically diverse population. This diversity may suggest an influx of immigrants into the Cuzco Valley, possibly including people from the Lake Titicaca Basin. Further analyses have been undertaken that will complement the study of cranial vault modi fication and provide the means to explore the iden tity of possible migrants into the Cuzco Valley.19 19 Chemical analyses of strontium, nitrogen, and oxygen iso topes in human bone and teeth are underway that will yield complementary data on population movements. Craniomet rie and non-metric analyses have also been undertaken on these Cuzco Valley populations to explore group identity and population affinities between Cuzco and the Lake Titicaca Basin, using comparative data from Blom (1999). Summary and Conclusions Evidence from this study suggests that conditions during the period of Inca domination affected not only the health of subject populations but also had detrimental effects on the health of elite individuals within the empire. We can draw three conclusions from our comparison of the elite site of Sacsahuaman in the capital city of Cuzco with the site of Choke pukio, located nearby in the Lucre Basin. First, analy sis of mortuary practices indicates different status levels at the two sites. The tombs of Sacsahuaman were carefully prepared, above-ground domed struc tures, furnished with a higher number of artifacts and a greater diversity of artifact types than at Chokepukio. Possible class distinctions among the females at Sacsahuaman are suggested by specific ar tifact sets included in individual tombs. Noticeably, no correlations were found between artifact type and the sex of individuals. These findings contradict the previous assumption that tupu pins signify a female interment, as these implements were found with both male and female burials. Second, conditions at the more common-level site of Chokepukio may have negatively affected the health of individuals. Chokepukio individuals appear more likely to suffer from spinal joint disease and appendicular joint disease, perhaps as a result of ar duous physical activities fulfilling agricultural and construction-related obligations to the state. The debilitation of individuals through physical labor might have affected the functioning of the empire by reducing the output of tribute paid back to the empire. Thus, in enforcing rigid schedules of man datory labor tributes, the empire may have reduced the maximum rate of commodities flowing back into the storehouses of the capital. Third, contrary to expectations, elites in Cuzco may also have suffered adverse effects. The elite Sacsahuaman individuals show a higher frequency of Osteoperiostitis, possibly due to an aggregated population and a cloistered living environment within a restricted area. This evidence suggests that urban living conditions may have prompted the spread of infectious conditions and detrimentally affected qual ity of life for elite individuals within the capital city. 78</page><page sequence="17">Andrushko, Torres, Belli/emine: Burials at Sacsahuaman and Chokepukio The comparison of Sacsahuaman and Choke pukio has shown some of the effects of imperial Inca control on different segments of the population, re flected in both the skeletal remains and in the differ ential mortuary treatment. Continued analysis in the core region of the Inca Empire, along with compari son to other bioarchaeological investigations in the Andes (e.g., Blom 1999; Tung 2003; Murphy 2004; Nystrom 2005), provides the opportunity to reveal geographical and temporal trends in pathological conditions and cranial vault modification, produc ing further insight into the biological and cultural impacts of imperialist expansion.
