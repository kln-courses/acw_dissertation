With its many merits and a high standard of scholarship which is the aim of the editor throughout, this edition bears witness to the fact that the younger Latinists of the United Kingdom are not unworthy successors to the generation which numbered Postgate and Housman. ROBERT J. GETTY. UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. La Notion du Divin, depuis Homere jusqu'a Platon. Sept exposes et discussions par H. J. ROSE, PIERRE CHANTRAINE, BRUNO SNELL, OLOP GIGON, H. D. F. KITTo, FERNAND CHAPOUTHIER, W. J. VERDENIUS. Vandoeuvres-Geneve, 8-13 Septembre 1952. Publie avec le concours de la Bollingen Fondation, 1954. Pp. viii + 308. (Fondation Hardt pour l'ttude de l'Antiquite Classique, Entretiens, I.) (Available in U. S. A. from Walter J. Johnson, Inc., 125 E. 23rd St., New York.) Not only on its title page but in all respects this volume is a welcome and notable example of international scholarly collabora- tion. The conference reported here was held (September 8-13, 1952) in Switzerland under the auspices of a Swiss society, the publica- tion was assisted by the Bollingen Foundation of New York, and the actual printing was done by the Stamperia Valdonega in Verona. The seven scholars who gave the lectures represent five countries, and used either French, German, or English. The discussions that followed each lecture, in which three additional scholars took part, Victor Martin, William Lameere, and Olivier Reverdin, are even more immediately and delightfully polyglot, as questions, answers, and comments succeed one another in any of three languages being used. It is, incidentally, a tribute to the careful work of the com- positors and the (unidentified) editor that misprints are almost entirely absent. It is, however, less the novelty of the presentation than the con- tent that matters. Here too there is every ground for satisfaction. Each speaker was chosen for recognized competence in his par- ticular field, and the lectures, as one would expect, are excellent one and all. What distinguishes the volume from the usual sym- posium is the open discussion after each lecture. While a few of the lengthier statements sound prepared, for the most part there is every indication of a spontaneous interchange of ideas, of the free give-and-take of informed, critical minds centering on a common problem. It is this that gives the volume a far greater degree of unity than is found in most symposia, however pre-arranged. The oppor- tunity to raise critical objections to the views expressed and to have these objections at once answered opens the way, if not always to a meeting of minds, at least to a clearer definition of the problem and the views concerning it that are tenable. Since it will not be possible to review in detail the closely argued REVIEWS. 101</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. content of each lecture, it may be helpful to list the speakers and titles, with occasional comments on points that seemed of particular value. The Introductory Lecture by I. J. Rose lays the groundwork effectively for what follows. In a typically acute remark he says of the title "Father" used of Zeus: "At least it had the negative aspect that we do not normally find the relation of God and man paralleled to that of master and slave; it is rather that of the senior and junior members of a family." In "Le Divin et les Dieux chez Homere" Chantraine proceeds from an exhaustive collection of the relevant passages to examine the various aspects of the problem, the meaning ascribed to the words SaitoDwv and 0eos, divine intervention, the personal and anthro- pomorphic nature of the gods, destiny, and the relation of the gods to morality. Homeric anthropomorphism, he rightly insists, is a form of rationalism, which is at least comparable to the later at- tempts to explain obscure or disquieting phenomena by "natural causes." And the fundamental Greek drive to discover order, rat3s, in the universe finds expression, even amid the anarchy of the Homeric Olympus, in the sovereignty of Zeus. Yet one may ask whether this "anarchy" is really an inherent aspect of the divine society, and not rather an unintentional by-product of the poet's use of the divine machinery, which dramatically produces a conflict between the gods that the religious consciousness would not normally feel. As the starting point for his investigation of " Die Welt der Gotter bei Hesiod," Bruno Snell takes the catalogs of the Muses and the Nereids. Though at first sight this is rather unpromising ma- terial, his analysis shows the importance of Hesiod's attempt to account for all the divine forces active in the world: it was, in fact, his emphasis on the general rather than the particular that opened the way to philosophy. This and his grappling with the problem of evil are the great contributions of Hesiod. The lecture of Gigon, on " Die Theologie der Vorsokratiker," forms a natural and effec- tive sequel. The philosophers were concerned, not with the cults practiced in the polis, but rather with the general ideas that had come to the fore in and through the work of the poets. Ionian phi- losophy, he finds, had two primary aims: the recognition of celes- tial phenomena as natural, not as fearsome manifestations of divine intervention, and the attempt to fix and define the place of the Divine in the universe. The essay by Kitto, " The Idea of God in Aeschylus and Sopho- cles," is written with his customary clarity and reveals the sure touch of the finest critic of ancient drama in our day. Without going into his interpretations in detail, we may note that he empha- sizes the double plane, human and divine, on which the dramatic action takes place. This does not mean, as is so often said by peo- ple who should know better, that the human actors are blind puppets of Fate, or Destiny, or the Gods. The men and women of the plays are autonomous human beings, with full moral responsibility for their acts. But the gods are also concerned and active, and re- peatedly the poets reveal to us a double motivation for what takes place, one purely human, the other divine. These are coordinate: 102</page><page sequence="3">the gods are indeed Oeoi eraMLoL, and the " addition of the divine plane gives to the action the authority of a universal, together with the sharpness of a particular." However else they differ, in this point the two poets are in full agreement. " Euripide et l'accueil du divin " is one of the last works of F. Chapouthier and appeared only after his untimely death. He finds three tendencies present in the work of this most baffling of the three ancient tragedians. In part he is a traditionalist, accepting the gods at face value and fascinated with the forms of inherited cult and ritual. Again, he shows a strongly negative and critical attitude towards the gods, especially as regards the moral value or the truth of the myths told about them. Finally there are certain positive features that enrich his concept of the divine, of which perhaps the most significant is his linking of the divine with the inner spiritual life and conscience of the individual. This marks an important step towards the later development of pagan-and Chris- tian-mysticism. Finally, there is the highly suggestive paper by Verdenius, " Pla- tons Gottesbegriff." Perhaps the key idea of his presentation is the recognition that to the Greeks " God " is primarily a predicate term. "Der griechische Gott ist nicht gottlich, well er Gott ist, sondern er ist Gott, well er etwas G6ttliches ist." One consequence is that, for Plato: "je g6ttlicher, umr so unpers6nlicher," and we find here also the basic difference between the Platonic (or in general, the Greek) concept of the Divine and the Christian concept. This review could attempt no more than to suggest the riches contained in this volume. It is a book that merits reading, and re-reading. The Foundation Hardt has earned our congratulations, and we may look forward eagerly to additional "Entretiens sur l'antiquite classique," of which the second has just been announced. FRANCIS R.

Pp. 522. (Skrifter utgivna av Svenska Institutet i Rom, XIX, 1, 3.) Not all papyri come from the valley of the Nile. There is a famous group of Latin documents, deriving chiefly from the archives of the church of Ravenna, which unaided by the Egyptian climate successfully passed through all vicissitudes and are extant today. The first mention of them is in a letter sent in 1433 to Cosimo di Medici, the grandfather of Lorenzo, and Jacques Cujas in 1561-62 was the first to read any of them. In 1805 Gaetano Marini gathered them and some others (including, alas, a few forgeries) between the covers of one book (I papiri diplomatici raccolti ed illustrati). Although a good number of the pieces were subsequently repub- lished here and there, Marini's volume has by and large served as REVIEWS. 103</page></plain_text>
