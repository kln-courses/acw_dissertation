<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SUN-GOD TABLET OF A NABU-APLA-IDDINA REVISITED Christopher E. Woods The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago Introduction' Few tales from Assyriological lore rival Rassam's discovery of Sippar in exemplifying the vagaries of archeological fortune. In the months and years prior to the winter of 1881 the city, already known from Assyrian and Greek accounts, had defied the attempts by Rassam and others at identification.2 However, in December of 1880 Rassam's luck would change with the unwitting, yet happy col- laboration of two chance occurrences.3 While so- journing in the village of Mahmadiyah, en route to Babylon from Baghdad, he was shown an in- scribed brick fragment collected at Tell ed-Der. His curiosity piqued, he put aside his plans for Babylon and set out the next day for the nearby 1.

Rassam's first visit to Abt Habbah must have been in December 1880, although he does not specify the month in his accounts. This conclusion is based on a comparison of the date of Rassam's letter to Sir Austen Henry Layard (cited in J. Reade, introduction to Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum; Volume VI: Tablets from Sippar 1, ed. E. Leichty [London: British Museum Publications, 1986], xiii- xxv, and in E.

As fate would have it, the Euphrates over- flowed its banks, forcing Rassam to abandon the straight road from Mahmadiyah to Tell ed-Der and to take up a more circuitous, westerly approach. It was in this way that Rassam stumbled upon Abt H.abbah, a mound long known to him from his travels between Baghdad and Hillah, but which he had previously, from a distance, dismissed as a levee. Now forced to make a closer inspection of the tell, Rassam was astonished by the large num- ber of inscribed brick fragments lying, quite lit- erally, under his horse's hooves and he soon made plans to excavate the site. At Aba Habbah, Rassam was successful from the start, for within days of commencing excavations in the vicinity of the ziggurat mound, his work- men happened upon intact architecture just be- low the surface in the form of a bitumen-paved chamber.4 The novelty of a bitumen-covered struc- ture was not lost upon Rassam, who was well versed in the standard Mesopotamian practice of building with mud-brick and to a lesser extent with stone. Goaded, no doubt, by impatience and the prospect of ancient treasure, Rassam ordered his workmen to break through the pavement. They had scarcely begun removing the dirt in the south- eastern corner of the chamber, when they came across an inscribed terracotta coffer three feet beneath the surface. Inside lay an extraordinary find-a stone tablet "covered with six columns of the finest writing and adorned with a beautiful bas-relief on the top of the obverse."5 It was soon realized that the tablet related to SamaS and the vicissitudes of his temple, the Ebabbar, prior to and during the reign of its commissioner, Nabi- apla-iddina. Consequently, the tablet was referred to as the "Sun-god Tablet" (SGT) and it quickly became a source of wonder and debate under that designation in early Assyriological circles.6 Although the tablet would later prove indispens- able for reconstructing the history of the poorly attested Post-Kassite period in Babylonia, its value in January of 1881 was in unequivocally identify- ing the chanced-upon site of Aba Habbah with the ancient city of Sippar, long considered to be the Sepharvaim of the Bible.7 As early as 1888, when Jastrow referred to the SGT as an "Assyrian kudarus'8 the tablet was rec- ognized as belonging to that group of texts, the so-called kudurru-corpus, which typically deals with land ownership, associated tax exemptions, or the entitlement of prebendary incomes.9 Beyond the unique image of the bas-relief and the histori- cal narrative, the main objective of the SGT is, clearly, to commemorate the resurrection of the Ebabbar cult and the restitution of its prebendary incomes as so restored and granted by Nabfi-apla- iddina after long periods of desuetude. Since its discovery, the SGT has been deemed one of the masterpieces of ancient Near Eastern art and it has scarcely been overlooked in general treatments of Mesopotamian civilization and cul- ture. The text is often cited for its historiographic and religious significance, and the story recount- ing the fortuitous discovery of a clay model that made possible the fashioning of a new cult statue 4.

It therefore comes as some surprise that, given this attention, a comprehensive, detailed treatment of the tablet is still lacking.'o Consequently, there still remains much to say about this often quoted and most recognizable artifact. The SGT Assemblage The gray schist" tablet is currently housed in the British museum (BM 91000, figs. 1 and 2) and measures 29.5 x 17.8 cm.12 Its width tapers from 5.1 cm in the center to 4.1 cm at the top and bot- tom and all four edges are beveled. The sculp- tured scene occupies the upper two-fifths of the obverse and includes three cuneiform captions. The inscription is written in six equally spaced columns; three short columns complete the re- mainder of the obverse and three longer tablet- length columns fill the reverse. Rassam recovered the tablet in two large and six small pieces, but it was otherwise complete.'" The tablet was appar- ently broken into four pieces in antiquity, as four pivot-holes bear witness to an attempt to repair it.14 As noted above, the tablet was found within a terracotta coffer complete with handled lid (BM 91004, fig. 3) measuring 89.3 x 50.2 x 17.5 cm.'5 On the front and right sides of the coffer is an inscription that reads "Image of SamaS, the lord of Sippar, the one who dwells in Ebabbar" (figs. 4 and 5).16 As described by Walker and Collon, the inscription is copied four times, twice per side, and is repeated once inside the box under the lip of the left side; in all five cases it is written upside down.7 Within the terracotta coffer there were also several clay impressions of the bas-relief portion of the tablet; however, the issue of the precise number of these impressions is as muddied today as it was in 1881. In both of Rassam's accounts of the discovery, he states, unequivocally, that there were two molds in the box.'8 This claim has been reiterated by all commentatorsl9-based, presum- ably, on the belief that the contents of the terra- cotta box made their way to the British Museum, along with the rest of Rassam's AbO Habbah finds, in toto. This view is ostensibly corroborated by the presence of two impressions of the relief (BM 91001 and BM 91002, figs. 6 and 7 respec- tively) in the British Museum collections. How- ever, as early as June 1881, only six months after the find, there was some ambiguity as to the exact number of molds. In the initial reports of the discovery, Pinches referred to them variously as one mold'20 "some molds,'21 and then vaguely as 10. The most recent discussions of the SGT are U.

"this mold"'22 And in a short communication in 1884, Bezold mentioned the existence of a third mold housed in the Royal Ottoman Museum that was identical to those in London.23 Jastrow verified the existence of this third mold in an 1899 paper,24 but judging from the prevailing belief that only two clay impressions of the tablet exist, his com- ments were apparently forgotten soon thereafter.25 This clarification of the number of clay molds would be little more than an exercise in catalog- ing if it were not for the remarkable fact that the Istanbul impression is not identical to the two British Museum exemplars. As noted by Jastrow, the position of the leftmost caption (Caption I) on the Istanbul mold differs from the position of that same caption on the British Museum impressions and on the SGT itself.26 In 1996 I had the oppor- tunity to photograph the Istanbul mold (Istanbul No. 459) and a comparison of these photographs with those of the tablet published by King, as well as with a plaster cast of the tablet in the Se- mitic Museum of Harvard University, shows this indeed to be the case. Caption I on the Istanbul impression is clearly higher, with respect to the rest of the relief, than the same label on the tab- let and on the BM molds. In addition, the Istanbul 22.

This mold must have found its way to the Royal Otto- man Museum by way of Layard's 1878 excavation permit which stipulated that duplicate antiquities had to be turned over to the Ottoman authorities (Reade, introduction to Cata- logue, xvii). It was probably transferred from the British Mu- seum to Istanbul in 1882, along with a duplicate of a Nabonidus barrel inscription (S. Langdon, Die Neubabylonischen Kfnigs- inschriften, VAB 4 [Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs, 1912], Nbn. 6) with which it was found. 26.

Based on the differences in label position, Jas- trow suggested that the terracotta coffer housed a second tablet, which, he surmised, was stolen from the coffer by the local workmen before Rassam appeared on the scene.28 This supposition may not be far off the mark; for although Rassam im- plies in both accounts that he was present at the discovery, he is vague as to his exact location. And, according to an anecdotal account of the find given by Ward, Rassam was not in the immediate vicinity at the time of the discovery, but rather the excavators only came to him later with the ex- citing news of the tablet.29 More telling, however, is the fact that Rassam's reports make mention of only two molds and not three-very possibly an indication that his accounts were, at least in part, reconstructed from the British Museum accession records rather than from a first-hand memory of the event. Curiously, at the time of the discovery rumors were bandied about within Baghdad con- 27. Bezold included a copy of the Istanbul mold inscrip- tion in his article; it reads: sa-lam dUTU EN GAL- I/ a-fib E.BABBAR.RA Ad / [......] (ZK 1 [1884] 270). The difference in the inscriptions was apparently overlooked by both Bezold and Jastrow. 28. Jastrow, AJSL 15 (1899) 69. 29.

According to Jastrow, in the years prior to 1899, Budge was in pursuit of these reports and at some point be- lieved himself to be on the trail of this duplicate, but evidently he never met with final success.30 30. Jastrow, AJSL 15 (1899) 69. Interestingly, there may have been religious motivations prompting the local Arabs to ab- scond with the alleged second tablet. In light of a local tradi- tion, the tablets may have been regarded as sacred relies. In an anecdote reported by Hilprecht, Rassam claims: "I was then standing near a small pyramid situated at the westerly limit of the mound, which I was told contained a golden model of the ark in which Noah and his family were saved from the Deluge, and that the second father of mankind had it buried there as a memorial of the event:' (Hilprecht, Explorations in Bible Lands, 268). And an account of the find related by Ward states: "When this bas-relief was found by the Arab diggers they ran to Mr. Rassam, shouting that they had found Noah with his three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japhet. In honor of the discovery Mr. Rassam killed an ox and made them a great feast:' W H. Ward, The Seal Cylinders of Western Asia (Wash- ington, DC: The Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1910), 100-101. These nineteenth century accounts are particularly intriguing in light of ancient evidence that connects Sippar with the flood. Nebuchadnezzar I, for instance, in claiming descent from Enmeduranki, the antediluvian king of Sippar, states: lIpu raqu fa farratti zxeru nasru fa lam ababi "Distant scion of kingship, seed preserved from before the flood" (W G. Lambert, "Enmeduranki and Related Matters' JCS 21 [1967] 128, 130: 8). In the first-millennium Erra Epic it is claimed that Sippar was spared from the flood, Ja Sippar al sati Sa Be~l matati ina aqar pant.u ababu la uibi"riu ina balu Samgi dairgu tatabat tattadi samtssu "As for Sippar, the eternal city, through which the Bel of (all the) countries (= Marduk) did not let the deluge pass because it was precious in his eyes, Against the will of SamaS you destroyed its wall, you tore down its rampart" (IV 50-51). And it must not be forgotten that in the fourth century Berossus claimed that Xisouthros had preserved all writings from the flood by burying them at Sippar. As Sippar</page><page sequence="10">32 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS Unfortunately, the confusion surrounding the clay impressions is not limited to the elusive Is- tanbul mold, but encompasses the better-known British Museum impressions, BM 91001 and BM 91002, as well. Of the two British Museum pieces, BM 91002 gives the better impression of the re- lief and contains a short inscription on its reverse describing garment offerings to SamaS for the var- ious dates of the lubugtu ceremony (fig. 8).3' This text has traditionally been considered a Nabopo- lassar royal inscription-one of the few attributable to this king-based on the reading dN4-IBILA- UJRU in the nineteenth and final line.32 However, E Joannis has recently challenged this reading, interpreting the last sign of the RN as MU, not SES, based on the photographs provided by King in BBSt.33 Hence, Joannis reads the RN as Nabfi- apla-iddina and not Nabopolassar. Indeed, a col- lation of the mold kindly provided by I. Finkel confirms Joannbs' reading.34 Nevertheless, the attribution of BM 91002 is still open to question. The problem lies with the ambiguous antecedent of the ga in the nineteenth and final line. All commentators, following King,35 have understood it as qualifying the noun gabru directly (i.e., '8gabri asumit fa Samag bel Sippar 19sa Nabai-apla-iddina gar Babili), hence, as the mark of authorship of the mold, i.e., "Impression of the bas-relief of SamaS, lord of Sippar, of RN, king of Babylon." However, it can equally, and in my opinion preferably, be understood as modify- ing asumit directly and in turn, the entire phrase modifies the head-noun gabri. Thus, the ga before the RN acts to mark the authorship of the original tablet and reveals nothing about the ownership or commissioning of the mold itself, i.e., "Impres- sion of the bas-relief of SamaS, lord of Sippar, of RN, king of Babylon." Based on similar NB clay impressions of this type36 in which the preoccu- pation is not with the mold as such, but with the original, this is what one would expect. Thus, the end of the inscription is best interpreted as an abbreviated colophon without dividing line-a simple statement that the mold is an impression of the bas-relief of SamaS that was commissioned by Nabfi-apla-iddina.37 The former interpretation, first suggested by Jastrow and adopted by King, was inspired, no doubt, by the desire to see the is not otherwise mentioned in connection with the flood, i.e., neither in Atra-hasis nor in GilgameS, it seems reasonable to assume that this notion originated as a local, Sipparian tradi- tion and was only later, as our evidence suggests, incorporated into the pan-Babylonian theology. It will probably never be known with certainty whether this belief persisted at Abt Habbah and the surrounding area, enduring at least until the end of the nineteenth century, or if it was reintroduced into local lore by turn-of-the-century excavators, reinterpreting Berossos's account within a biblical framework. 31.

However, neither Joannbs nor Finkel makes mention of an erasure. In a letter to the author, Finkel writes "... in my opinion the sign is MU and not SES. The photograph published by L.

Although the text begins with an identification of SamaS along with two of his epithets (SamaB, belu rabi2, agib Ebab- bar), this opening is not to be interpreted as the prologue of a royal inscription, however succinct. Rather, it is a reiteration of the incipit, i.e., the title, of the SGT from whence it is borrowed di- rectly. It is precisely for this reason that the prepo- sition arna does not precede the divine name and epithets, as is generally expected in Neo-Babylo- nian royal inscriptions.39 All of these measures- the impression of the relief, the reiteration of the SGT incipit, and the colophon ascribing the source to Nabfi-apla-iddina-serve unmistakably 38. Aside from Finkel's reading, it is doubtful that the in- scription on the reverse of BM 91002 could represent a Neo- Babylonian royal inscription given that it finds no parallel in the fairly standardized formulary of this corpus, lacking: (a) the expected lengthy list of royal and divine epithets; (b) a tem- poral subordinate clause (mnu...) describing the circumstances prompting the garment offerings; (c) a main clause (inm- mifu...) detailing the offering; and finally (d) a prayer to the concerned deity, in this case SamaS. For this typology, see E-A. Beaulieu, "A new inscription of Nebuchanezzar II commemo- rating the restoration of Emab in Babylon,' Iraq 59 (1997) 93- 96; Langdon, VAB 4, 1-14.

A Post-Nabti-apla-iddina Date for the Clay Molds and Coffer The corollary to Finkel's collation is, of course, the dismissal of the commonly held belief that Nabopolassar commissioned the terracotta coffer, BM 91004; for most commentators have unques- tioningly attributed it to Nabopolassar, reasoning that he had the coffer made to keep the entire group-his impressions and the SGT-intact and in safe keeping.40 Although Finkel's collation of the mold confirms the reading of the RN in the nineteenth line of the inscription as Nabfi-apla- iddina, this does not necessarily imply that the mold and the coffer are to be attributed to this king; for, as argued above, the mold itself is anon- ymous. However, there is converging evidence that is suggestive of a post-Nabfi-apla-iddina date for the mold BM 91002 and the terracotta coffer. Perhaps the best evidence for dating the coffer and the molds comes from the provenance of the discovery-although a reconstruction of the ar- cheological context of the SGT first requires sift- ing through Rassam's inconsistent accounts of the find. These reports vary from the mysteriously vague, as in his two accounts written years after the find,41 to the patently impossible, as in the legend accompanying his plan of the site.42 How- ever, as noted by Sollberger, Rassam's letter from the field of 23rd January, 1881 to Layard is clearly the most reliable source.43 It gives little reason for doubt as it is consistent with the known facts and was written only days after the discovery. Accord- ing to this account, Rassam and his workmen came across two, duplicate, barrel cylinders of Naboni- dus44 along with a "curious symbol made in the shape of a wheel of a tread mill which ends at top and bottom in the shape of a cross...'45-n0 doubt the notorious pious fraud known as the Cru- ciform Monument (CM) of Maniitatu.46 Directly beneath this deposit they stumbled upon the bitumen-paved chamber containing the SGT.47 Whereas Rassam's later accounts omit any men- tion of the CM and claim that the Nabonidus cyl- inders were found in a chamber adjacent to the SGT,48 the 1881 letter clearly states that the SGT was found beneath the CM deposit. Remarkably, the CM and Nabonidus cylinders were not found randomly strewn throughout a confined area as one might expect, but were, according to the 1881 letter, "enclosed in brick casing."'49 It is likely then, as the Nabonidus cylin- ders deal directly with the rebuilding of the Ebab- bar, that this assemblage-the CM and Nabonidus cylinders-represents a foundation deposit of some kind. It seems more than coincidental, in fact quite intentional, that this deposit was laid directly above the bitumen-paved chamber containing the encased SGT, especially in view of the fact that all of these items-the two Nabonidus cylinders, the CM, and the SGT deposit-are concerned with royal endowments to the Ebabbar.50 Given that 40. The consensus has been with King's interpretation: "It is clear that the coffer was made by Nabopolassar as a recep- tacle for the tablet" (BBSt., 120). For additional scholarship expressing this view see nn. 19 and 32. Prior to King, Jastrow wisely noted that this assignment was completely arbitrary, "Nor is there any evidence going to show that Nebopolassar [sic] made the box or riveted the stone" (Jastrow, AJSL 15 [1899] 70). 41. See n. 2. Rassam seems to have been more concerned with detailing his comings and goings than with recording find-spots and dates. 42. Rassam states that the terracotta coffer contained the SGT and two barrel cylinders of Nabonidus. Clearly, he con- fused the cylinders with the molds. In any event, it is doubt- ful that the coffer could contain all of these items. See Plan 3 reproduced by Gasche and de Meyer, in Tell ed-De~r III. 43. Sollberger, JEOL 20 (1968) 52-53.

Beaulieu, The</page><page sequence="13">THE SUN-GOD TABLET OF NABU-APLA-IDDINA REVISITED 85 these deposits were apparently intentionally linked and given that two Nabonidus cylinders were included in the deposit, it logically follows that the SGT assemblage, in its final manifesta- tion, could not have been deposited any earlier than Nabonidus' restoration of the Ebabbar in his second and third regnal years.51 Following this same reasoning, M. Powell has taken this argu- ment further, suggesting that the vilification of Nabonidus after the victory of Cyrus makes the entire deposit, by virtue of the cylinders, unlikely to be any later than Nabonidus' reign."2 The SGT would then be just one of the many inscriptions discovered by Nabonidus in the course of search- ing for earlier temple foundations.53 And, as with other such discoveries, it would have behooved him to re-inter the tablet in its original location. If the suppositions offered above are correct, it may not be overreaching to suggest that Naboni- dus not only re-deposited the SGT, but also com- missioned the terracotta coffer and the clay molds at the time of his restoration of the Ebabbar. This scenario accounts quite well for many of the pe- culiarities surrounding the SGT assemblage. The terracotta coffer, the attempt to repair the tablet, and the bitumen-paved chamber would then rep- resent appropriate reverential measures for the pious disposal of a royal antique. Needless to say, the spirit of Nabonidus' reign fits very well in- deed with these devotional deeds; the respect and care he accorded to his predecessors' inscrip- tions, which extended as far as to repair a statue of Sargon out of "his respect for kingship,'54 are well-documented. But aside from the inherent attraction of this proposal, there is adequate in- ternal evidence from the inscriptions on the coffer and the clay mold BM 91002 to suggest a later NB date for these objects. Owing to the minimal nature of the single- line coffer inscription, i.e., sal-lam dUTU EN UD.KIB.NUNki a-gib-bi E.BABBAR.RA, and the scarcity of ninth century sources, the epigraphi- cal evidence, although suggestive, is necessarily marginal. Moreover, caution is required when comparing the writing of the tablet with that of the coffer, as the former is expressed in the ar- chaizing dialect and orthography typical of ku- durrus,55 while the latter likely reflects writing practices contemporaneous with its date of com- position. These caveats being noted, it is still, per- haps, significant to note that the writing on the coffer differs from that on the tablet in witness- ing two corrupt spellings: sal-lam for /salam/ and a-gib-bi for expected /agib/-neither the tablet nor any of the other published texts from Nabi- apla-iddina's reign contain such spellings, despite their liberal use of CVC signs.56 Arguably, these two corrupt writings give the impression of late NB or LB orthographic practices and appear to be at odds with what little is known of early Neo- Babylonian orthography.57 This discrepancy is Reign of Nabonidus, King of Babylon 556-539 B.C., YNER 10 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989). 51.

WOODS underscored by the observation that these writ- ings represent the only syllabically spelled words in the inscription. In the case of sal-lam for salam we note that although consonantal geminations of this type, i.e., CVC1-C1V(C) for cvc1 v(c), occur already in OAkk. and OB58-where they are most often the result of a disparity between morpheme and syllable boundaries-they are, as noted by de Vaan, not well attested for early NB.59 However, in late NB and LB there are frequent attestations of spellings of this type, e.g., mah-hir for /mahir/, Sak-kin for /gakin/ (3.m.sg, pred. adj.); Sup-pur for ISupurl (m.sg. imp.).60 Similarly, we observe that writings of the type a-gib-bi, i.e., CVC1-C1V for cvcl, where the final syllable is wholly super- fluous, are, likewise, quite rare in early NB and appear to be, primarily, an LB orthographic phe- nomenon, e.g., mu-hur-ri for /muhur/ (m.sg, imp.).61' Possibly, in our case, the presence of the extra -i vowel, or perhaps better -e (i.e., a-fib-be), repre- sents a sandhi writing, i.e., a-gib-bd E.BABBAR.RA for /agibebabbar/; such forms occur already in MB, however, without false consonantal gemination.62 The inscription on the back of BM 91002 speaks to a possible post-Nabfi-apla-iddina date as well. As discussed in the text commentary, we observe that over 30% of all final vowels depart from their historically justified case endings according to a pattern in which, after a double consonant or two-consonant cluster, the final vowel mirrors the quality of that of the preceding syllable. This is in marked contrast to the SGT inscription in which case endings are consistently assigned ac- cording to the MB paradigm. Further, line 18 of BM 91002 yields the spelling -V1C1 for -C1 V1, i.e., a-su-P-mi-it for a-su-i-mi-ti-such spellings are unattested for the SGT. Although the inscription on the reverse of BM 91002 may be anonymous, the garment offer- ings themselves corrobate the suggested NB date. Among Nabfi-apla-iddina's many gifts and offer- ings commemorating the restoration of the Ebab- bar cult were new cultic wardrobes for the statues of SamaS, Aya, and Bunene. Although he presented much of this attire following the consecration of the new cult statue, other garments he reserved, setting specific dates on the cultic calender for their disbursement. In so doing, Nabfi-apla-iddina established the so-called Ebabbar lubugtu cere- mony-six fixed dates when the statues of SamaS, Aya, and Bunene were to receive new garments.63 Once established, these dates had great endur- ance, as administrative clothing texts show that the lubugtu ceremony was observed on precisely these dates down through the reign of Darius I.64 While both the SGT and BM 91002 reflect the same dates for the ceremony, as one would ex- pect, the actual garments listed on the mold are altogether different from those enumerated in the SGT (iv 39-vi 8). The offerings of both texts are presented in Table 1. While it may be argued that BM 91002 alludes to a decision on the part of Nabfi-apla-iddina to amend and increase the garment offerings set forth on the tablet, there is ample reason to be- lieve that the divine wardrobe of BM 91002 rep- resents that of a later period. During the NB and Achaemenid periods the lubugtu offerings for Sa- maS, Aya, and Bunene were fairly standardized in terms of the types of garments offered. A review of the published sources indicates that a consis- tent corpus of some fifteen garments accounts for the vast majority of all the Ebabbar lubugtu offer- ings during those periods.65 Therefore, it is sig- from SamaS-Tumu-ukin to Esarhaddon7' Iraq 34 (1972) 23-27; H.

Conversely, it is an equally noteworthy that the garment offerings of mold BM 91002 are quite typical of those offered in the lubugtu cere- mony of later periods. To this one might add that many of the gar- ments of BM 91002 are either entirely unattested, or are unattested as divine garments, prior to the reign of Nebuchanezzar II. Table 2 organizes all the dateable CAD attestations (for the clothing of divine statues or for cultic personnel) of the gar- ments listed in BM 91002. Only one attestation per text is included; multiple attestations per text are not included in order to prevent an undue bias of the data. Just less than half of all such at- testations are credited to Nabonidus' reign. The only garment listed in BM 91002 that is well- attested prior to the NB period is nrbehu, "belt, sash." It has been excluded here because its equal distribution over all periods is not challenged and, therefore, it is not relevant to the argument. In sum, the lubugtu offerings, as they are listed in the SGT and in BM 91002, form two mutually exclusive groups. Moreover, we note the fact that the spelling of the RN in BM 91002, i.e., mdNA IBILA-MU, is not attested in texts contempora- neous with the reign of Nabfi-apla-iddina, but rather is typical of later periods."6 Although none of these facts is conclusive in and of itself, together they form the strong suggestion that BM 91002 is the product of the late NB period. It may very well be that although Nabfi-apla-iddina estab- lished the dates for the lubugtu ceremony, the garment offerings themselves underwent a cultic reform sometime during the NB period. Therein may lie the motivation behind the commission- ing of the mold-to serve as an amendment to the tablet whereby the revised and updated lubuitu offerings could be dutifully recorded. This reform would find its authority in its shared identity with the SGT, both visual and literal, and ultimately, garments are: guhalsu, hullanu, husannu, kibsu, kulalu, kusitu, lubaru (TUG.UD.A/ TUG.HI.A), nahlaptu, nebehu, parsigu, sainu, sibtu, falhu, tahapiu, 'SgMURUB4.IB.LA.

During the last century there have been other, varying explanations for the casting of the SGT molds. Rassam maintained, curiously enough, that "they were made for the purpose of casting in metal those mystic figures for religious purposes:'6""7 Pinches first asserted that the molds served to pro- tect the relief,68 but was later, according to Jastrow, of the opinion that "the molds were intended to preserve the representation if the original should be destroyed:"69 Finally, King made the suggestion that is generally agreed upon today, that "Nabo- polassar placed them [the molds] in the coffer to enable some future ruler, in case the tablet should be broken, to restore the scene; in doing so he would be influenced by the fact that Nabti-apla- iddina was enabled to restore the Sun-god's miss- ing statue from a clay model found on the bank of the Euphrates, as related on the tablet?'7"" Although this view is not without romantic appeal, it is seems unlikely to have been the chief motivation for their casting, as the stone tablet was likely to survive the fragile clay molds. More likely, the intention was to cast one mold7 that could hold an inscription and, as suggested here, serve as an NB amendment to SGT's lubuitu offerings. As for the uninscribed molds, Jastrow seems to have been right on the mark when he wrote a century ago that "the others are rough in execution and impress one as 'failures.'"72 Indeed, the casting of clay molds of antiquities discovered in the course of excavating temple foundations was not unknown in Nabonidus' reign. During Nabonidus' excavation of the palace of Naram-Sin in Agade, a Sar-kali-Sarri inscription was discovered and a dutiful scribe recorded the find by executing a mold of it. So that it would be properly identified for posterity, the scribe in- cluded the following text on the reverse of the mold:73 67. Asshur, 402. 68. Pinches, PSBA 3 (1881) 109. 69.

Jastrow continues with an intriguing comment concerning the uninscribed molds: "As for the other copies, I am not at all certain that they may not have been made in the year 1881 A.D. by some enterprising Arabs. The fact that the Constantinople mold points to another copy of the tablet that has disappeared is suspicious, and Mr. Pin- ches, it will be recalled, in one place speaks of only 'one mold.' If the two others turned up later, they may have been pro- duced by the law of demand and supply" (AJSL 15 [1899] 86). 73. A. T. Clay, MJ 3 (1912) 23-25; Beaulieu, Nabonidus, 141-42; I. J.

This inscription, or perhaps better, colophon, is quite similar to the last two lines of BM 91002 in that its primary purpose is to describe the origi- nal, not the copy. As argued above, the final lines of BM 91002 are to be understood in precisely these terms. The above text not only provides an established precedent in the reign of Nabonidus for the casting of clay molds of stone antiquities, but also for the inclusion of colophons on such molds-colophons that provide information con- cerning the provenance and nature of the original. It is quite possible that Nabonidus' interest in the SGT was not limited to taking impressions of the relief and seeing to the relic's proper inter- ment. The happy circumstance that had allowed Nabf-apla-iddina to fashion a proper cult statue of SamaS, namely, the fortuitous discovery of a clay model of the Sun-god, may indeed have been a source of inspiration for him. Nabonidus' account of his own providential discovery of an ancient stele belonging to Nebuchadnezzar I that de- picted the image of an entu priestess complete with "her appurtenances, her attire, and her jew- elry,'74 shows no little resemblance to Nabfi-apla- iddina's account. The two texts even go so far as to employ, in part, a common vocabulary in their re- spective descriptions: salmu, simatu, and giknu.75 It is likely that both stories represent embellish- ments of the actual facts, a clever literary device employed to legitimate the manufacture of new cultic appurtenances and to establish continuity between these newly fashioned items and their worthy, ancient counterparts. Nabonidus is often credited for his scholary interest in history, but when it came to the manipulation of that history for religious and political ends, he may have taken his cue, at least in part, from Nabfi-apla-iddina. Finally, one may ask about the alleged second, nearly identical tablet whose existence is all but proven by the Istanbul mold. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances that would have led Nabi-apla-iddina to commission a duplicate relief or tablet.76 More likely, the Istanbul mold reflects a later tablet, fashioned in imitation of the SGT. Of course, at this point it is impossible to ascer- tain whether this tablet was stolen from the terra- cotta coffer at the time of the discovery, as was suggested by Jastrow, or was found elsewhere, perhaps with the CM deposit. It is known, how- ever, that during the course of restoring the Ebab- bar, Nabonidus deposited his own inscription together with the discovered inscription of Naram- Sin (iitir lumiya itti fitir gumu fa Naram-Sin, garru maihra).77 The question may then be raised whether this very same motivation-the tangible self-legitimization effected by physically linking one's inscription to that of an illustrious prede- cessor, or more aptly put, "a respect for king- ship"78-would have led Nabonidus to include his own inscription, fashioned after the SGT, along- side Nabfi-apla-iddina's original.79 pa-li-su-tim is difficult, see CAD A/2 sub asarru A. Also note the mold of a Kurigalzu brick inscription likewise manufac- tured during Nabonidus' reign (CT 9, 3b; discussed by Beau- lieu in Nabonidus, 142). 74. YOS 1, 45 i 82. 75. SGT: i 14, 16; cf.

The imitation of a predecessor's deposit, not only in content, but also in form, is not without precedent. Ellis cites a pair of white steatite and copper tablets with inscriptions of Kurigalzu which were found in the company of very similar steatite and copper tablets of Warad-Sin in the Ningal tem- ple at Ur. According to Ellis, "the occurrence of one stone and one metal tablet of each ruler suggests that Kurigalzu was imitating what had been found." Interestingly, none of the in- scriptions was dedicated to Ningal and the context of the find suggests that the items were redeposited in the NB period.

WOODS The Inscription The raison-d'dtre of the SGT is to establish, under binding contract, the revenues and privi- leges of the Ebabbar cult as restored by Nabfi- apla-iddina As a legal document, or more pre- cisely, a stipulation of a royal entitlement,80 the text is rather typical, in regard to content, struc- ture, and phraseology, of the so-called kudurru corpus to which it undoubtedly belongs.81 What is remarkable about this tablet, however, is the impressive marshalling of visual and literary de- vices in terms of archaic iconography and poetic, historical narrative to establish not only the great antiquity of the cult, but, more to the point, its ancient claim to these prerogatives and revenues. The cult's exploitation of the past as a means of courting royal patronage and privilege is by no means limited to the SGT. Several other such texts are known, but there are serious doubts re- garding the authenticity of each. The previously discussed CM, a purported Maniitugu inscription bestowing certain privileges and increased in- comes upon the Ebabbar, has been decidedly exposed as a pious fraud-a late forgery manufac- tured in the Neo-Babylonian period82 to strengthen the temple's claim to these revenues. The basis for this finding rests on the belying epigraphical, philological, and metrological anachronisms as well as historical inaccuracies within the text.83 Likewise, there is good reason to question the alleged acts of piety attributed to Kurigalzu on behalf of the Eanna of Uruk84 and to Agum- Kakrime on behalf of the Esagila of Babylon.85 It was, no doubt, this shroud of deception that led Gelb to label the SGT as still another pious fraud, yet he offered no further evidence for question- ing its authenticity beyond the mere mention of its content.86 Undoubtedly, this is a case of guilt by associa- tion. While one may be justifiably suspicious of Nabi-apla-iddina's providential discovery, there is no doubt that the text itself represents a true endowment to the Ebabbar on the part of Nabfi- apla-iddina. Rather, it may be that his distortion of the circumstances surrounding the fashioning of the new cult statue was a source of inspiration for similar Neo-Babylonian fabrications-such as Nabonidus' discovery of an image of an entu priestess-or, perhaps, influenced entirely fraud- ulent endowments, like the CM. As for the SGT itself, there is no internal evidence for contesting its veracity; for both the orthography and gram- mar of the text,"7 as well as the format and sub- stance of the endowment, are entirely consistent with its claimed ninth-century date. Further, similarities in offerings, witnesses, and legal 80. The term, "entitlement;' has been used by Slanski to refer to all of the events commemorated on kudurrus (her terminology: entitlement narfs); see Slanski, The Babylo- nian Entitlement narfis, 114-15; Slanski, JCS 52 (2000) 95- 114. Slanski follows Brinkman and Dalley (ZA 78 [1988] 76), who first applied the term "entitlement" as an equivalent to iiqu, "prebend:'." 81. As early as 1888, Jastrow observed that the SGT was a member of the kudurru corpus based on the content of its in- scription, and he thus referred to the tablet as an "Assyrian kudirru" (Jastrow, Proceedings [October 31-November 1, 1888] 95). King and Steinmetzer seem to have implicitly agreed with this view, as they incorporated the SGT into their studies ku- durrus (BBSt., no. 36; E X. Steinmetzer, Uber den Grundbesitz in Babylonien zur Kassitenzeit nach den sog Grenzsteinen dargestellt [Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs, 1918], no. 35 [L 36]). How- ever, U. Seidl omitted the SGT from her study, presumably based on the assumption that tablets and kudurrus repre- sent mutually exclusive groups (Die babylonischen Kudurru- Reliefs, Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis 87 [Fribourg: University Press, Fribourg, Switzerland, 1989]). Slanski presents an argu- ment for the inclusion of the SGT in the kudurru corpus (The Babylonian Entitlement narfis, 211 if.; JCS 52 [2000] 95-114). 82. Sollberger, JEOL 20 (1968) 50-53. E N. H. Al-Rawi and A. R. George misunderstood Sollberger's quotation of Gelb when they wrote: "This text, in the words of its latest editor, E. Sollberger, (is) 'a fraus pia perpetrated sometime in the Old Babylonian period...'" ("Tablets from the Sippar Library III. Two Royal Counterfeits,' Iraq 56 [1994] 139). Sollberger, in fact, argued for an NB date (JEOL 20 [1968] 50). Sollberger was simply quoting Gelb who suggested an OB date (I. J. Gelb, "The Date of the Cruciform Monument of Maniituu"' JNES 8 [1949] 848 n. 12). Based on Sollberger's evidence, Powell has dated the CM to Nabonidus' reign (ZA 81 [1991] 21). 83.

The inscription opens with an account of the devastating period of Sutian raids on Babylonia, during which time the Ebabbar was thrown into anarchy and the very essence of the cult, the statue of SamaS, simply vanished (i 1-12).89 The Sutians are not held directly responsible for the loss of the cult statue, for this would conflict with the com- monly held theological justification for such dis- appearances-that the loss of the statue reflects the god's anger with Sippar and his consequent abandonment of his cult center. Although the text does not provide us with a date for these attacks, we can convincingly date them to the reign of Adad-apla-iddina (1068-1047).90 According to the inscription, Simbar-Sipak (1025-1008), founder of the Second Dynasty of the Sea-land, searched for the god's image, but SamaS would not reveal himself91 and his quest was in vain (i 18-15). However, his attempts to resurrect the despoiled cult were not altogether unsuccessful. In lieu of the statue he enshrined92 a sun disk,93 the symbol of SamaS, and established regular offerings for it, entrusting them to Ekur-Tuma-ularti, the Janga priest of Sippar (i 16-23). However, Simbar-~ipak's attempts to restore offerings to the temple were short-lived; for during the brief reign of KaSu- nadin-ahle (1007-1005) the offerings were inter- rupted due to "distress and famine" (i 24-28).94 Subsequently, during EulmaS-Sakin-Sumi's reign (1004-988), the lang2 priest of Sippar, the very same Ekur-Suma-ulargi installed by Simbar-Sipak, approached the king to complain about the state of the offerings-and with good reason, since his income was defrayed, no doubt, from these offer- ings. EulmaS-Sakin-Tumi responded by entrusting 88. The following observations are made by Brinkman: (a) the food offerings established in the SGT (v 10-38) are similar to the offerings established at the same time in Uruk (OECT 1, pls. 20-21; see G. J. P McEwan, "Distribution of Meat in Eanna,' Iraq 45 [1983] 187-98); (b) the witness, Marduk- Sapik-zeri, son of Tambaladdar(?), the gakin t.mi (vi 22-23) is also known from BBSt., no. 28 rev. 23; (c) prominent wit- nesses in the same two texts are kartappu officials from the Habban tribe (vi 18-19; BBSt., no. 28 rev. 21) and bel pihati officials of the Arad-Ea family (vi 24-26; BBSt., no. 28 rev. 24-in each case the final witness); (d) similar legal phraseol- ogy is used in each text (vi 17 = BBSt., no. 28 rev. 18; cf. vi 30- 31 with BBSt., no. 28 rev. 27); in addition, Brinkman further notes that both documents were executed in Babylon imme- diately after the New Year's festival on the same day, the twentieth of Nisannu, although eleven years apart (vi 27-28; BBSt., no. 28 rev. 25-26) and that the king's titular is the same in each case. Brinkman PKB, 189-90 n. 1159. To Brinkman's observations, we may add: (1) the use of captions is typical of kuddurus attributable to the reign of Nabfi-apla-iddina; of the three other kudurrus with captions, two are datable to his reign (BBSt., nos. 28 and 29; the other is dated to the reign of Nabfi-mukin-apli, BBSt, no. 9); (2) the crib-bttis of BBSt., no. 36 and those of the kudurru of Nabfi-apla-iddina's son and suc- cessor, Marduk-zakir-Sumi, receive identical commodities, with the exception of the various cuts of meat. 89. By the end of the second millennium the term "Sutian" ceased to distinguish any one ethnic group, but rather, in Baby- lonian sources, referred collectively to Sutians and Arameans. Brinkman PKB, 285; M. Heltzer, The Suteans, Istituto Univer- sitario Orientale: Seminario di Studi Asiatici, Series Minor 13 (Naples: Istituto Universitario Orientale), 90, 93, 97. 90. A dedicatory inscription of Simbar-iipak concerning the throne of Enlil in the Ekur makes reference to the defilement of the cult centers of Nippur and Sippar at the hands of Su- tian and Aramean invaders during the reign of Adad-apla- iddina (A. Goetze, "An Inscription of Simbar-Sihu" JCS 19 [1965] 121-34, particularly 11. 10-14). This account is corrobo- rated by Chronicle 24 (Eclectic Chronicle) which also mentions Sutian attacks on Nippur (as well as Der and Dtr-Kurigalzu) during Adad-apla-iddina's reign (Grayson Chronicles, 180: 8- 10; see also W. G. Lambert, Review of E G6ssmann, Das Era- Epos (Wiirzburg: Augustinus-Verlag, 1956), AfO 18 [1957-58] 898); Sippar is not mentioned as one of the cities sacked by the Sutians in Chronicle 24, however, there is a lacuna in the relevant passage. Also observe that the Erra Epic, which may allude to this period, mentions the cities of Babylon, Der, Dur-Kurigalzu, Sippar, and Uruk as being affected by Sutian intrusions.

According to Brinkman, "The circumstances were probably similar to those prevailing at the time of Marduk-nadin-ahhe and Marduk-shapik-zeri of the previous dynasty when crop failure caused famine in the land. The hungry semi-nomads poured in to create havoc every- where. This would help to explain why the king's reign ended after only three years" (Brinkman PKB, 157).</page><page sequence="20">42 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS to Ekur-Tuma-ularli, on behalf of Samai, a mod- est regular offering of 1 sila of bread, 1 sila of beer, re-allocated from the offerings for Marduk, and one garden plot within the New-City sector of Babylon (i 29-ii 16). At this point the historical portion of the narra- tive breaks off abruptly and the text leaps into the present with the single, indefinite adverb, arkanu, "later" (ii 17). After an enumeration of Nabi-apla-iddina's titulary and epithets (ii 18-iii 10), which are fairly standard, save the important mention of his overthrow of the Sutians (ii 26- 28), the narrative turns to its main subject, the res- toration of the Ebabbar. Evidently, SamaS found conditions to be so appealing during Nabfi-apla- iddina's reign that he became reconciled with Sippar and "turned back his face (to Akkad)."95 Consequently, the god allowed a fired clay model or impression96 of his image to be found on the western bank of the Euphrates (iii 11-25). Nabfi- nadin-9umi, the fangi priest of Sippar and de- scendent of Ekur-Tuma-ularli, presented this clay model to Nabfi-apla-iddina. The king, needless to say, was overjoyed and he soon ordered Nabfi- nadin-Sumi to fashion a cult statue of SamaS based on the providential clay model (iii 26-iv 11). There has been considerable discussion as to whether this account should be taken at face value or whether the clay model represents a pious fraud perpetrated by the priests of the Ebabbar.97 The truth may very well lie somewhere in between. That the priests of the Ebabbar had access to, and indeed, maintained such ancient images, is clear from Rassam's finds in the NB levels98 of the temple complex. These finds included Pre- Sargonic and Sargonic vases (some of which showed signs of repair-recall the pivot holes on the SGT), a votive statue of Ikan-SamaS of Mari (ED III), a Sar-kali-Sarri mace-head, monolith fragments of Maniitatu, and a whetstone of Tukulti-Mer, king of Hana, among others.99 The abundance of these antiquities led Walker to con- clude that the Ebabbar served as a local treasury or museum during the NB period.100 However, there is no better witness to this conclusion than the imagery on the SGT itself, which, as we shall see, bespeaks a close acquaintance with a wide array of antiquities dating from the third and sec- ond millennia. It may be that the Ebabbar priests, with some poetic license, composed a story around an antique already in their possession, such as an OB plaque, perhaps similar-in shape if not con- tent-to the OB terracotta plaque of a bull-man, the adjunct of SamaS, excavated by Scheil in 1894.101 In so doing, the priests would have been com- pelled to explain the disappearance of the old statue while providing a set of circumstances under which the fashioning of a new cult statue was theologically permissible. Nabonidus' prov- idential discovery of a Nebuchadnezzar stela, depicting an image of the entu priestess and pro- viding the proper cultic justification for the re- instatement of her office, is an obvious parallel.

However, in the most recent discussion of this issue, Seidl accepts the account of the fortuitous find as described in the text (ZA 91 [2001] 122-23). 98. The catalogue of the Babylonian tablets in the British Museum reveals that Rassam's excavations were primarily confined to the NB levels of the temple complex and that he "hardly penetrated" the OB levels (G. van Driel, "The British Museum 'Sippar' Collection: Babylonia 1882-1893,' ZA 79 [1989] 110). 99.

Returning to the inscription, NabOi-nadin-Tumi fashioned the new statue with gold and lapis la- zuli and ritually brought it to life (mis pi) on the bank of the Euphrates, in Ea's temple, Ekarzagina, in Babylon; this "mouth-washing" ceremony in- cluded offerings of sacrificial oxen and sheep, as well as honey, wine and flour (iv 12-34). The ganga priest was duly rewarded for his efforts as he was presented with a gift of 1 sila of bread, 1 sila of beer and a garden plot within the New- City sector of Babylon-the very same ancient offerings that EulmaS-Sakin-Sumi bestowed upon his forefather, Ekur-Tuma-ularli (iv 40-53). Most importantly, Nabfi-apla-iddina established exten- sive offerings of meat, fish, vegetables, flour, and beer for Samag, Aya, and Bunene, specifying that the fangi priest receive half of the king's share of all incomes and dues as well as an additional two shares corresponding to those alloted to two Brib-bitis (iv 54-v 8; v 28-38). But Nabfi-nadin- Sumi would receive yet more still. In gratitude for the priest's efforts to resurrect the cult and in tacit acknowledgment of the ancient prerogatives of his office, Nabfi-apla-iddina further stipulated that the fanga priest would receive a consider- able meat disbursement, as well as two shares of various foodstuffs derived from the erib-btti's and butcher's prebends (v 8-27).1?3 The king's largess extended to providing the fangf priest with gar- ments for Samag, Aya, and Bunene as well as to specifying the days and garment offerings of the lubugtu ceremony (v 89-vi 13). After the description and granting of the enti- tlement, there follows the requisite contractually binding legal phraseology typical of kudurrus. So that there would be "no claim;' the original was witnessed, sealed, and dated. Presumably, the stone tablet was based on a clay original executed in Babylon on the 20th of Nisannu, 31st year of Nabf-apla-iddina, as the text states that the tablet was "sealed" on said date before five prominent witnesses with a "copy of the royal seal of admin- istration"l04-the seal of the office of the king used in the granting of entitlements (vi 14-31). Finally, the inscription ends with a standard list of pro- hibitions and curses against anyone who reduces, re-allocates, or otherwise changes the offerings and prebends herewith established by Nabfi-apla- iddina (vi 32-55). The literary style of the narrative portion of the text is unique to the highly legalistic formulary of the kudurru corpus, the important exception being the well-known narrative of the Nebu- chadnezzar I kudurru, BBSt., no. 6, of which the SGT is reminiscent. The purpose of the narrative is not to recount the history of the Ebabbar for the sake of poetics, but to legitimate the temple's claim to revenues and privileges through estab- lished historical precedent and to point out that the temple had been unduly stripped of those rights during less fortunate times. The language of the narrative is merely the appropriate vehicle for the delivery of that message. This theme of precedence is echoed in the prebendary portion of the text, as is suggested by the act of confer- ring upon Nabi-nadin-Sumi the very same modest offerings that EulmaS-Sakin-Sumi bestowed upon his forefather. Surely this is a symbolic gesture that acknowledges the perpetuity of the fangft's claim to certain privileges-that specific incomes are an inalienable part of the office. Similarly, the "discovery" of a model of Samag's image, com- plete with appurtenances, serves to bridge the gap with the past, suggesting some degree of con- tinuity between the lost and the newly fashioned statues. 102.

The designers of the tablet deemed the reinforcement of this theme a great necessity, for they went to considerable lengths to reproduce archaic iconography and style. The combination of these older elements with newer ones gives the piece vitality, while still maintain- ing the desired degree of orthodoxy. The compos- ite image must have been readily accessible only to the initiate, as the ancient designers found it necessary to attach three explicatory captions. The generally fine workmanship of the low-relief scene finds its complement in the finely engraved cuneiform of the inscription. However, the de- tailing of the individual features is not uniform; while certain elements-the deity's face, the Ionic volutes, the palm column, the stool, and throne base-reflect a careful attention to detail, others- the faces and gowns of the figures, the throne it- self, and the canopy-are portrayed in a more schematic, stylized fashion. The Approaching Figures The left side of the relief is dominated by three small figures approaching a stool-an oversized version of that frequently encountered in Mitan- nian and early Middle Assyrian seals of the 14th century, where it is held aloft by two adjuncts, either bull-men, griffins, or nude heroes, and sup- ports the winged solar disk.'05 The first figure leads the second with his right hand while grasping the stool with his left; the middle figure raises his right hand to his face in a gesture of supplication or "pious greeting;"'06 the third and final figure raises both hands in similar greeting. This image is highly reminiscent of the presentation scenes found in the glyptic of the Sargonic through Old Babylonian periods. But the presentation scene is most clearly recognized as a hallmark of the Ur III period, and it was during this time that the scene was standardized. In the typical Ur III presentation scene an interceding goddess is in lead position, introducing a worshipper before a seated deity or deified king.'"7 As pointed out by Collon, the worshipper is invariably shaven- headed, beardless, and wears a fringed robe.'08 In a gesture similar to the one depicted on the SGT, the interceding goddess grasps the left hand of the worshipper with her right and the spare hands of both figures are raised. Although, as a general rule, the Ur III presentation scene conformed to the template described here, significant varia- tions in the imagery did exist. I. J. Winter has shown that such variations often reflected the owner's position within the Ur III bureaucratic hierarchy.1'09 Indeed, there exists a relatively small group of seals, belonging mainly to prominent individuals, which diverge markedly from the standard Ur III repertoire in that they include two interceding deities-one who leads the worshipper by the hand and one who stands behind him with both hands raised in supplication. Of this group of 105. D.

Seidl observes that while the motif of the solar disk supported by two adjuncts disappears from the glyp- tic at the end of the 14th century, it persists in other media, e.g., a 9th century relief from Tell Halaf, and so this theme may still have been prevalent at the time of Simbar-Sipak's in- stallation of the solar disk (Seidl, ZA 91 [2001] 124-25). 106.

Possibly, the leading deity represents a personal god(dess) and the rear deity a generic protective spirit dlama-a hypothesis that would account for the Gudea seal, in which Gudea's personal god Nin- giizida introduces him to Enki. This variation on the Ur III presentation scene is identical to the depiction of the three figures on the SGT, the only exception being that the lead- ing goddess of the seal is replaced by a human figure on the tablet. It seems likely, therefore, that the designers of the SGT had in their possession, or were at least aware of, third-millennium seals of this variety, after which they modeled the scene 110. B.

Seidl, it must be noted, has rejected the identi- fication with Nabfi-apla-iddina, observing that the medial figure's dress does not correspond to the traditional royal costume encountered on contem- poraneous kudurrus"8 and going so far as to point out that the beard is not as long as the one worn by Nabi-apla-iddina in the scene of BBSt., no. 28; rather Seidl sees in this figure an unidentified worshipper.119 However, these objections are mit- igated to a considerable degree when the archaiz- ing character of the image is taken into account; clearly, the choice of dress is influenced by the traditional presentation scene (discussed below), and one cannot reasonably insist that the king wear a ninth-century garment in a third-millennium scene. It follows that the differences between the SGT and BBSt., nos. 28, 29, in this regard, are merely a function of differences in context and motivation. Further, the mere fact that the de- signers of the image chose to employ a scene of this type-one often reserved for high-ranking officials, significantly, in the case of the SGT, with a slightly larger image scale afforded the central figure vis-a-vis the leading figure-is again sugges- tive of an identification with Nabfi-apla-iddina. It must also be stressed that the relief and the nar- rative form two halves of one whole, that there is a correspondence between the characters of the image and the characters of the narrative who participate in the entitlement. This is certainly true of the contemporaneous kudurru BBSt., no. 28, which depicts both Nabfi-apla-iddina, grantor of the endowment, as well as one Nabfi-apla- iddina, son of Atnayya, recipient of the endow- ment.120 The choice of this third-millennium motif allows for the inclusion of both the king and the Jangfi priest, the two representative parties of the transaction. Nabfi-nadin-Sumi, the celebrated Jangi priest, who was instrumental in procuring the clay model and in fashioning the cult statue of Samag, not only plays the role of intercessor between Nabf-apla-iddina and SamaS-as the Ebabbar was his domain and he its highest priest-but he also appears as the recipient of the endowment on behalf of his temple. Frankfort has noted that the attire of the fig- ures on the relief dates back to the third millen- nium as well, claiming that it finds its counter- part in the stele of Ur-Namma.'21 Although this is true to a certain extent, since the figures of both monuments wear simple wrap-around garments, there are significant differences that bear witness to the true age of the SGT image. As described by Collon, in the third-millennium presentation scenes the interceding goddess generally wears a vertically striped dress with a double border and her divinity is indicated by a headdress consist- ing of a single pair of horns. Only rarely does she wear a flounced garment, but when she does, she is adorned with multiple horns.122 The tradition connecting striped dresses with a single pair of divine horns is maintained on the Gudea seal, but violated on the Hagbamer seal, where the second goddess (behind the worshipper) wears a striped dress and a headdress of multiple horns. The goddess of the SGT scene mimics the fashion of the Hlalbamer seal, but with some peculiar inno- vations. Her garment is not striped with straight lines, as in the third-millennium scenes, but with parallel wavy lines. The lack of horizontal lines indicates that the garment is not flounced.'23 More- over, her horns are depicted in true profile-a glaring anachronism for Ur III style, since divine headdresses were only depicted in true profile be- ginning with the Old Babylonian period.

The conventions dictating the choice of robe and head- dress are explained by Collon in Impressions, 36 (Ur III), 44 (early OB). Compare Impressions, nos. 114, 115 and the god- dess on the Ur-Namma stele (Frankfort, Art and Architecture, no. 110) with Impressions, nos. 117, 118, 119. 123. An inspection of a cast of the tablet in the Harvard Semitic Museum reveals that the dress of the goddess is not flounced, despite the wavy pattern. Note also that both god- desses (on the tablet and on the Hfaqhamer seal) wear striped garments without a double border, see Impressions, nos. 114, 115. Collon notes that the striped dress of the interceding god- dess usually has a double border (Impressions, 36).</page><page sequence="28">50 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS the designers of the tablet were ignorant of these conventions or they were willing to overlook them in exchange for visual balance, as the wavy-lined dress and horned headdress of the goddess on the far left of the image correspond very well with the flounced garment and true-profile headdress of SamaS on the far right. Nabfi-apla-iddina is depicted wearing a double- bordered robe that exposes his right shoulder and a headdress that comes to a dull point. Ur- Namma and iHammurapi wear similar robes on their steles and abundant parallels to this garment can be found in seals, where the fringed version is a hallmark of the worshipper in the presen- tation scene.'24 And, while in the typical Ur III presentation scene the worshipper is generally clean-shaven, bare-headed and occasionally bald, exemplars from the Old Akkadian and Old Baby- lonian periods do allow for bearded (regularly in O. Akk.'25) and capped (Larsa-OB126") worshippers. The king's headdress represents a first-millen- nium innovation that is first attested in the reign of Nabfi-apla-iddina. According to Brinkman and Dalley, the tasseled version of this crown (depicted on BBSt., no. 28, year 20 of Nabi-apla- iddina) replaced the older rectangular crown with feathered crest.'"'27 Nabi-nadin-gumi's attire does not, however, find its parallel in the third-millennium presentation scenes, although this may not be altogether sur- prising given the priest's anomalous presence in the scene. His garment is of the wrap-around va- riety, but it covers both shoulders and is tied with a sash at the waist. This robe is contemporaneous with the tablet as evidenced by the Marduk-zikir- gumi kudurru on which the king wears a similar, but more detailed, garment.28 Both here and in the portrayal of Nabfi-nadin-Sumi the sash emphasizes the curvature of the lower-back and the protuber- ance of the chest; however, this feature should not be regarded simply as a trapping of fashion, but rather as a harbinger of the Neo-Babylonian style of figural modeling. The Sun Disk The most significant innovation in this revised presentation scene is that the three figures do not approach the seated deity directly, but advance towards a stool. There is a tactile element in the SGT scene that is entirely absent in its conven- tional, third-millennium form; for instead of rais- ing his left hand in pious greeting as one would expect from earlier exemplars, Nabfi-nadin-Sumi grasps the oversized stool. The stool is not level; its left legs are raised ever so slightly, suspended from above with ropes and carefully guided by the hand of Nabfi-nadin-Sumi. Upon it is an elab- orate, Ionic volute pedestal bearing a disk with a four-pointed star and three wavy-lines emanating from between each point-an image that defies interpretation as anything other than the sun disk, the long-standing symbol of Samag.129 As with other elements of the relief (e.g., the depiction of SamaS, see below) the disk should be interpreted as rotated 900 into the plane of the re- lief, i.e., the face of the solar disk is actually par- allel to the front of SamaS's shrine. The stool and the disk are of such an immense size that the three approaching figures are completely dwarfed by it. Clearly, the inclusion of these elements be- speaks a more contemporaneous influence, the Neo-Babylonian period as a whole demonstrat- ing a marked preference for emblematic forms and divine symbols over their anthropomorphic counterparts. Similarly, the appearance of ropes in connection with the solar disk is reminiscent 124. See Impressions, nos. 114-118, 532; Haussperger, Die Einfiihrungsszene, 296-97. 125.

In accord with his interpretation of the relief, Brinkman understood the passage, nipha fa pan Samag ugatrisamma (i 18-19), as referring to the suspension of the stool and disk by ropes lowered from the canopy.'32 Similarly, Jacobsen translated the passage as "he had the sundisc [sic] (that is) in front of SamaS roofed over.'133 These understandings are both based on the S-stem of tarasu(m); as Brinkman observes, a stem, which is "most commonly employed in passages con- cerned with the construction of roofs of build- ings, would not be unexpected if one compares the mode of support for the disk shown in the picture on the tablet."'134 Slanski, however, has recently challenged this interpretation, noting that "the sun disk does not appear to be supported by as much as suspended from the ropes from up above, and the compar- ison to roof construction is not altogether satis- fying, especially as gutrusu connotes the idea of extending something outward or upward, not downward."'"3 Slanski understands the verb in its basic meaning "to extend;' i.e., "he had the sun disk that (is) before SamaS extended.":' And, re- garding the slightly raised stool, she views the sun disk as in the process of being removed, i.e., "that we interpret the sun disk as being raised, and that that this motion of the sun disk can be seen to reflect the new cultic reality: with the cult image restored to its proper place in the sanctu- ary, the sun disk is being removed from the cen- ter of cultic activity... now that the restored image (salmu) of SamaS can be reinstalled in the tem- ple, the makeshift symbolic representation of the divine, the sun disk (niphu), can be removed:'137 And along similar lines Seidl reads the image as possibly depicting the moment "als er [Nabfi- nadin-Sumi] dem Sonnengott 'seinen Wohnsitz richtete,' indem er das iltere Symbol mitsamt der Saulenkonstruktion beiseite schiebt und den Blick auf das wiedererstandene Bild des SamaS freigibt:'138 As attractive as the interpretations of Slanski and Seidl are at first glance, I must disagree. The image does not depict the moment when the sun disk was being removed, but rather, the moment when it was being installed in its new and proper location before the Sun-god. The semantic diffi- culties with gutrusu all but disappear once it is understood that the verb does not refer to how the sun disk is depicted on the relief, but only to Simbar-Sipak's installation-the two need not be identical. I suggest that Simbar-Sipak, enshrined (iutrusu)139 the sun disk, for lack of a proper image of the god, making daily offerings to it as he would to a cult statue, salamgu u simattfu la imur-ma nipha ga pan Samag ugatrisam-ma sattukkagu ukin-ma "because he did not see his image and his attributes, he enshrined the sun disk, which is (now) before SamaS, and estab- lished regular offerings (for it) ..

WOODS is, Simbar-Sipak installed the sun disk in SamaS's shrine; only when the cult statue of Sama~ was fashioned in Nabfi-apla-iddina's reign was the sun disk removed and replaced by the newly conse- crated statue-the sun disk, his symbol, now being placed appropriately before the seated Sun-god. Hence, the "roofing over" or "setting up" implied by futrusu refers to the original placement of the sun disk under the canopy or enclosure of the Sun-god's shrine.140 Remarkably, a rare motif on a Kassite seal that shares much with kudurru iconography depicts just such a scene: the symbols of a horse head upon temple-facade base and bird on a pole are both enclosed within a canopied shrine (fig. 15).141 And, although there is no reference to a shrine, a Kas- site votive inscription describes the dedication of an object, PA.DINGIR.RA, to Adad, probably a thunderbolt as three three-pronged thunderbolts are inscribed on the prism-important for our pur- poses is that this object was established as a sub- stitute, presumably in lieu of the cult statue: a-na PA.DINGIR.RA im-qi [a-na] pu-hi [i]d-di-ma "he poured a libation for the Thunderbolt, he estab- lished it as a substitute."142 The SGT image captures the moment after the sun disk and its stool have been extracted from the shrine and the act of lowering them into place before the god is nearly complete, Nabfi-nadin- Sumi gently guiding the stool into its new, proper position. The newly consecrated cult statue has assumed its proper place within its shrine and Nabfi-apla-iddina is introduced into the presence of symbol and deity in commemoration of his pious conduct in restoring the cult that had long been defunct. The inscription makes note of the fact that Simbar-Sipak enshrined the sun disk, in lieu of a statue of the deity, precisely because it was out of the ordinary, not belonging to the regu- lar cultic practice. It was, in essence, a noteworthy occurrence. Alternatively, arguing that the relief represents the moment just prior to the removal of the solar disk is to claim that the image, as portrayed, im- mortalizes a scene that is inappropriate from a cultic perspective-a claim that would indeed be difficult to accept. Given that the left leg of the stool is raised off the ground by only the slightest of margins, and that doubtless the artists and theo- logians desired the image to be explicit, it is cer- tainly preferable to interpret the disk and its stool as being depicted essentially in their proper places. Further, a "removal" of the sun disk, as opposed to a re-positioning, suggests that the sun disk it- self was improper or irrelevant as a cultic object for the Sun-god. This indeed would run counter to all that we know of SamaS's cult, in which sun disks play a prominent role, and particularly in light of references from earlier periods to the "bringing of sun disks into the Ebabbar."'43 That the disk on its pedestal interrupts the intimacy 140.

Myers, for instance, de- tails the incorporation of cultic paraphernalia associated with Samal into the NB pantheon of Sippar, none of which are attested for the OB pe- riod,'44 while Beaulieu discusses six deified cult objects in the pantheon of NB Uruk.'45 Moreover, Neo-Babylonian glyptic attests scenes that are reminiscent of the one portrayed on the SGT, with a worshipper assuming a posture of pious supplication before the symbol of a deity rather than before his anthropomorphic form,146 or, more relevant for our purposes, a worshipper paying homage before a seated deity with the god's sym- bol intervening between the two.'47 Samag on His Throne The right side of the relief is dominated by the imposing image of SamaS enthroned within his shrine. There can be little doubt that here one is confronted with a depiction, albeit stylized, of the newly fashioned cult statue commissioned by Nabfi-apla-iddina. From the modern perspective, the designers of the relief could not have chosen an image more representative of archaic iconog- raphy and style; for the portrayal of SamaS would in-ne-en-ku4-ra "year in which Samsu-ditana, the king, fash- ioned various sun disks of dufit-stone, emblems shining like the day, adorned with lapis-lazuli, fiery gold, and refined sil- ver, adorned them magnificently and brought them into the Ebabbar for SamaS the lord who resides above to make great his kingship" (Samsu-ditana 7).

WOODS appear to be based directly on the stele of Ham- murabi and comparable scenes from the second and third millennia.148 In both the stele of lam- murabi and the SGT SamaS is depicted in a nearly identical manner, with shoulders parallel to the picture plane, the right arm extended with the measuring implements placed between the thumb and open palm, the left hand clenched in a fist, and barefoot, with the right foot in front of the left. Likewise, in both depictions, the god wears a flounced garment, a divine headdress of four horns, and the same long beard and chignon.149 In so portraying the deity, the designers of the relief purposefully introduced elements reflecting an archaic style that were at odds with the Baby- lonian artistic devices of the first millennium. Par- ticularly anachronistic is the extension of both shoulders parallel to the picture plane, which is in marked contrast to two of the three approach- ing figures who are depicted in true profile, the conventional style of figural representation in first- millennium Babylonia-and one which apparently begins with Nabfi-apla-iddina's reign, as kudurru BBSt., no. 28 (year 20) represents the first attesta- tion of this. And, while the measuring implements are still common divine attributes in the Neo- Babylonian period, the deity now grasps them in a closed fist.'50 Thus, the depiction of the deity serves ostensibly to corroborate the story that the new statue was fashioned after an ancient, alleg- edly discovered model. Yet despite all the efforts to archaize the image, clues to its true date re- main. Following a more contemporary style, Sa- mag's robe has been altered to now extend over the right shoulder,'5 while the modeling of the deity's face, as observed by van Buren, with its heavy brow and lids, and angled features, "betray the fact that it was the product of a much less accomplished age" than that of earlier, compara- ble scenes.'52 Rather than placing the deity on a throne mod- eled after a temple facade, as was the preferred design in all periods, the artists exploited this space for still more archaic iconography; for the legs of SamaS's throne are supported by a pair of antithetically opposed deified bison-men (gud-alim/ kusarikku),'53 the long-time adjuncts of Sama.154 The bison-man seems to have been enlisted into 148.

The two figures differ only in that the deity on the Hammurabi stele has sun-rays emanating from his shoulders, he wears two necklaces, his garment lacks a wavy pattern, and it reveals his right shoulder. This last element is, no doubt, a vestige of the third-millennium presentation scene in which, as previously noted, the seated deity almost invari- ably wears a shoulder-revealing garment. 150. See Metzger, Kbnigsthron und Gottesthron, vol. 1, 226-30. 151. The same garment is worn by deities on Kassite ku- durrus.

Note also the following passage from an Ebla incanta- tion, ERIN+X NA KISAL dUTU "the ERIN+X creature lies in the courtyard of SamaS" (Krebernik Beschwdrungen, 164 x 5- 6); further, a number of economic texts from Ebla refer to gold and silver statues of EREN+X creatures that were fash- ioned with horns and tails.

As a logical extension of this association, the bison- man came to represent the distant mountains, the place of the sun's ascent. On several Sargonic seals SamaS is depicted climbing over a pair of kneel- ing bison-men"58-an emblematic variation of the common Sargonic motif in which SamaS climbs the eastern mountains to begin his daily jour- ney.159 During the Sargonic period the bison-man often appeared in combat scenes as the adversary of Samag,16o but gradually became drawn into SamaS's court as a vanquished foe.'6' In the Ur III period the bison-man was promoted to divine status and was outfitted with a double-horned headdress.162 By the Old Babylonian period, his assimilation into SamaS's court was complete;163 he served primarily as standard-bearer and atten- dant, often depicted in symmetrical pairs,164 as is common with adjunct deities. But by the first mil- lennium, the bison-man's direct association with SamaS was greatly diminished and he functioned more as an amorphous, apotropaic deity than as the adjunct of SamaS.165 The heraldic posture of the bison-men on the SGT relief finds its parallel in several second- and third-millennium seals in which deities are supported on thrones by symmetrical pairs of their adjuncts or emblematic animals. At least three Old Akkadian seals depict ITtar seated on a throne sup- ported by a pair of lions. On two of these seals the lions sit heraldically opposed and support the seat of the throne with their heads (figs. 16, 17);166 on the third seal the lions are heraldically opposed and rampant, bracing the sides of the throne with their front paws (fig. 18).167 Additionally, an Ur III seal portrays two intersecting lions, functioning as diagonal struts, thereby supporting the seat of Ningirsu's throne (fig. 19).168 Finally, an Old Ba- bylonian sealing depicts two "naked-heroes;' in a Literature and Third Millennium Seals with Mythological Mo- tifs7' in Literature and Literary Language at Ebla, ed.

See CS, pl. 27a. 164. The bison-man was regularly envisioned as existing in pairs, rather than singularly, as revealed by the following omen: BE SAL 2 Uj.TU-ma GIM GUD.DUMU.dUTU ti-is-bu-ti LUGAL a-a-bi-ri SU-su KUR-[did] "If a woman gives birth to two (children), and they are joined like the 'Bull(-god), son of SamaS'-the king will conquer his enemies" (Leichty Izbu, 40: 87). As assumed by Leichty, the bison-men in this omen are likely heraldically crossed (Leichty Izbu, 33 n. 10). See also DeJong Ellis, in DUMU-E2-DUB-BA-A, 130; A. Green, "Benef- icent Spirits and Malevolent Demons: The Iconography of Good and Evil in Ancient Assyria and Babylonia7' Visible Re- ligion 3 (1984) 84-86. 165.

The image cannot be resolved with absolute certainty owing to the minute yet coarse detail, but if this supposition is correct then an interpretation of this element of the image may be found in a group of Sargonic seals that depict SamaS's daily ascent. It is well known from the art and literary sources that the Mesopotamians envisioned daybreak as the Sun- god ascending the eastern mountains and appear- ing through the doors of heaven.170 On at least one seal from this group the open doors are de- picted free-standing,"'7 but on others attendant deities thrust the doors open in a gesture strik- ingly similar to that of the SGT bison-men (figs. 21, 22).172 Upon the doors in several seals are recum- bent lions (figs. 23, 24),173 the purpose of which may be to give visual representation to the roaring of the doors turning in their pivots.174 The image is, therefore, amenable to the suggestion that legs of the throne are actually the open doors of heaven viewed in profile and that the faces on top of the doors-if this is indeed the case-are lions viewed frontally. As a whole then, the throne is symbolic of the Sun-god's morning ascent, although the deity does not play an active role in this image. The base of the throne-a stylized scallopped pattern repre- senting two rows of mountains'75-immediately establishes the setting of the scene. This identifi- cation is further specified by the presence of a pair of bison-men, the constant adjuncts of SamaS during the third and second millennia and the very embodiments of the distant eastern moun- tains. There, beyond the hilly flanks, they thrust open the doors in anticipation of SamaS's daily entry into the heavens and the lions, after Sar- gonic fashion, give visual representation to this thunderous event. In performing this duty, the bison-men assume a function and pose reminis- cent of the heyday of their association with SamaS, namely, the Sargonic through Old Babylonian periods. Yet, as has been demonstrated in regard to the employment of other archaic images in this 169.

While the motif of SamaS's entry through the doors of heaven is a strictly Sargonic motif, the bison-man's role as deified attendant to SamaS is primarily an Old Babylonian development. As a result of this dichotomy, the bison-man is never portrayed thrusting open the gates of heaven in Sargonic seals. Additionally, when this scene is depicted on Sargonic seals with anonymous dei- ties playing the role of door-keeper, the doors of heaven as well as the lions are always depicted length-wise, never frontally.'76 Samas's Shrine and the Captions The elements of the relief discussed thus far have been explainable in terms of thoroughly rec- ognizable iconography, either archaic or contem- poraneous, but most often a blending of the two. However, the canopy which enshrines SamaS is unique and defies an identification with any known archaic or contemporaneous iconographic tradition; in this regard, the designers of the tablet were at ease in giving their creativity free reign. Unfortunately, an understanding of this part of the relief is hampered by the difficulties posed by two of the explicatory captions, as a consensus regarding their interpretation has remained elu- sive for over a century."77 The front of the shrine consists of a column stylized to represent the trunk of a palm tree, as indicated by the pattern of overlapping palm- frond scars. The column is provided with elaborate Ionic volutes above the capital and base, which complement the pedestal of the sun disk. The rear of the shrine is represented by an unpatterned band of uniform width that arches over the deity and terminates above the column in two protomes adorned with horned headdresses. A close in- spection of the image reveals a point of muscula- ture where the deities' torsos bend and emerge from the canopy, hence, the common interpreta- tion that the canopy represents a deified snake with two human upper bodies."78 Each protome holds two ropes that, as previously noted, extend not to the sun disk itself, but to the stool bearing the sun disk. The three-dimensional depth implied by the overlapping profiles of the protomes and the two pairs of arms, suggests, as already recog- nized by Andrae, that the image is to be inter- preted as a three-dimensional shrine rendered in profile. As such, we are to understand two gods, or perhaps one with two upper bodies, and two palm columns together serving as the framework of the shrine, supporting, presumably, a baldac- chino.179 Although this specific structure has no parallel in the known portrayals and descriptions of shrines, a review of the individual elements is telling of its underlying influences. The presence of the date palm as an archi- tectural feature of SamaS's shrine is not unex- pected when one considers the bison-man's role as standard-bearer to SamaS.8so As a common motif on OB terracotta plaques, the bison-man is de- picted either alone or in antithetical pairs support- ing a pole crowned with the sun disk.lsl However, on several such reliefs, two antithetical ithyphallic bison-men support a date-palm trunk in lieu of a pole (figs. 25, 26, 27).'"2 The association is based 176. Possibly, the doors are depicted width-wise on the relief in order to account for the position of SamaS on his throne, i.e., parallel to the side of throne; in order that the image would be clear, it was rotated ninety degrees and ex- tended parallel to the plane of the relief. 177.

A particularly revealing seal of Sargonic date depicts Sama within a shrine whose upright supports consist of ascending spiral columns (fig. 28).186 Engaged col- umns of precisely this type have been excavated at the Old Babylonian levels of Tell Leilan, Tell Rimah, and Telloh.'87 At all three sites, engaged columns mimicking date-palm trunks of varying imbricated frond-scar patterns have also been discovered, often side by side with the spiral col- umns. It seems reasonable to suggest that the theme of the ornamental date palm was applied to the shrines within the temples as well as to the external temple facades just as spiral col- umns were applied to both shrines and temple facades.'""88 Further, there is a textual witness to the use of the date-palm motif, perhaps applied as an architectural element, within the Ebabbar at Larsa, as Gungunum named his second regnal year, "The year (Gungunum) brought two bronze date palms into the temple of Samag'189 It is quite from the same mold as A9337); H.

The close Old Babylonian association between Samas, the bison-man, and the date palm played a role, no doubt, in the choice of this motif. The shrine with its two protomes poses the greatest challenge to the interpretation of the re- lief. Fortunately, the explicatory captions may be called upon to serve as a guide: Caption I (far left): sa-lam dUTU EN GAL a-sib E.BABBAR.RA sd qe-reb UD.KIB.NUNki Caption II (right, above the canopy): d30 dUTU u d15 ina pu-ut ZU.AB ina bi-rit dMUS ti-mi SUB.MES-t6 Caption III (right, under the canopy): NIMGIR dUTU MUS.IGI.MIN Image of Samas, the great lord, the one who dwells in the Ebabbar, which is within Sippar.

This reading of the captions-first proposed by Poebel, and accepted by Jacobsen and others-has recently been challenged by Seidl,'92 who makes the valid point that the alleged snake does not look much like a snake as typically rendered in Meso- potamian art.193 Rather, Seidl, follows a reading of the second line of Caption II, first proposed by King'94 and adopted by von Soden,195 of ina 190. The omission of the expected conjunction, u, finds parallels among phrases of the type berit GN GN2 (GN3); berit TN TN2; and beriti PN PN2 (see CAD B sub birit). 191.

The "Multimu-gods"-the two depicted protomes-are equated with the pairs of deities, well-known from the Neo-Assyrian period, that support the winged solar disk, although there is no corrobo- rating evidence to support this identification.198 Seidl argues that Caption III refers to the actual positioning of the three astral symbols of Sin, SamaS, and I~tar on the lintel of the shrine that must join the two protomes, but that could not be represented since the shrine is rendered in pro- file, i.e., the symbols are rotated 900 into the plane of the relief. The caption must present new in- formation not given in the relief, Seidl argues, otherwise it is redundant; in this case the label describes the third dimension that the artist could not incorporate. While I agree that several elements of the image, i.e., solar disk, stool, and twin deities hold- ing ropes, collectively suggest Middle- and Neo- Assyrian influences to some degree, this interpre- tation of the captions encounters serious difficulties that must be addressed. Most significantly, it is quite doubtful, in my opinion, that gimu is attested in the Gt, let alone in the Gt with the sparsely attested function of denoting "etwas fiir die Dauer tun:' A Gt (or Gtn) participle of the verb is, to my knowledge, otherwise unattested. Of the six other attestations of the Gt of gdmu cited by von Soden, five occur in a passage from the sixth tablet of GilgameS and one from a Late OB or Middle Babylonian love lyric (MIO 12 [1966-67] 54: 9). For Gilg. VI 47 57 (cited below) and MIO 12 [1966-67] 54: 9 (dimmatam maigi u urri [...] bi-tdk!-ka-a tagtimi "you have decreed lament... day and night;" for the emendation, see CAD S/1 sub gidmu B mng. lb-l') the perfect is clearly the better fit, the iterative sense of the idiom being expressed by the Gtn of bakit, i.e., bitakkd gimu 'to decree to perpetual lamenting'. Similarly, for the remaining attestations, all clustered in a passage from Gilg. VI (54-56), there can be little doubt that the perfect is at work here as well-to the extent that the Gt preterite is to be distinguished from the G perfect.'99 In this passage we en- counter the common formula pret.-ma perf. That we are dealing with the G perf., and not the Gt pret., is suggested by the fact that the other verbs in this construction are either unattested in the Gt, i.e., geberu (VI 49), or the passive/intransitive Dt [i.e., heri2 (VI 52) and tdru (VI 61)] is impos- sible given the context (although for these verbs the Dtn cannot be excluded200). Indeed, this is the understanding of the CAD, given that a I/2 stem is not listed for gdmu. If the perfect is accepted for these forms, then it reflects a SB remnant of the regular OB function of signifying the last of a sequence of actions (most recent activity), i.e., fo- cusing upon a critical event that occurs within the context of a previous completed action, i.e., pret.-ma perf.201 46. ana Dumuzi hamiri suhretUki Dumuzi, the lover of your youth, 47. gatta ana ?atti bitakkd taltimtggu year upon year, you decreed for him perpetual lamenting. 48. allalla bitruma tarami-ma You loved the speckled allallu-bird, 49. tamhasti-ma kappaiu taltebir but struck him down and broke his wing. 196.

It must also be pointed out that while the G and D participles of gidmu frequently occur in the epithets of gods, they are invariably encountered in the bound form governing a genitive, usually paronomastically simtu.202 An unbound participle would indeed be unique in this context. Finally, it must be asked if it is theologically possible for a minor, adjunct deity to be a "determiner of fate"- and assuming this role with no less an object than the emblematic form of his master. The function denoted by iaimu/mulimu is usually, as de- scribed in texts, the prerogative of major deities, describing a relationship between a superior and an inferior. Seidl applies a similar reasoning to the inter- pretation of Caption III, claiming that the caption describes the crown of SamaS, the third dimen- sion of which could not be captured by the artist. She reads AGA dUTU ser-gi 2 and argues that the rarely attested lexeme serfu "growth, bump, pro- tuberance"203 refers to the horns of the crown and 2, i.e., the dual, to the fact that there are actually two, parallel sets of horns although their render- ing in profile on the relief reveals only one.204 Seidl cites evidence from Ebla, i.e., ug-sakar (for u4-sakar): za-la-sa205 (MEE 4, 1134), to argue that "seit alters werden die Hirner der Gitterkronen mit der Mondsichel verglichen."206 I have reser- vations concerning this analysis of the caption, reservations that would remain even if the Ebl. za-la-sa could be equated, with confidence, with Akk. sergu, and this third-millennium gloss could reasonably be applied to our first-millennium context. First, the sparsely attested term serfu is known exclusively from divinatory texts and is never used, to my knowledge, to refer to the horns of the divine crown in connection with SamaS, or even the solar disk for that matter. While Seidl is certainly correct that there is a semantic and lexi- cal connection between the horns of the divine crown and the crescents of celestial bodies, par- ticularly the moon, the lexeme involved is qarnu, not sergu. Indeed, the former is regularly used with reference to the horns of the divine head- dress and is well-attested as referring to the cusps formed from celestial bodies.27"' On the other hand, 202.

It is unclear as to how Seidl analyzes ser-gi 2 grammatically If ser-fi is understood as a singular bound form (in lieu of seres), this would indeed be unexpected given that, as laid out in the General Commentary to the text edition, the other fifty free bound forms encountered in the SGT inscription (i.e., those that are expressed syllabically) are uniformly correct accord- ing to the standards of OB/MB grammar, with the possible exception of ahu (v 7; v 35). 204. Seidl, ZA 91 (2001) 128-29. The force of the argu- ment is somewhat diminished by the fact that there would actually be six "protuberances as horns7' in two rows; more convincing is to understand MIN for dUTU. 205.

Interestingly, the two terms do occur within the same context, but they are not used synonymously, rather sergu de- scribes bumps on the horns of either the moon, i.e., cusps (qarnu), or izbu in omen texts.208 And while I agree with Seidl that the purpose of the captions is to provide explanations for a difficult image, we disagree as to precisely what is in need of explanation. According to Seidl, without an explanatory label the crown would be incomprehensible, the cap- tion describing, again, the third dimension that the artist could not depict: "Und dies war notig, weil ein Babylonier des 1. Jts. Harner an Kronen an- thropomorpher Gatterbilder nicht kannte, und er die Profildarstellung vor seinem geistigen Auge nicht umsetzen konnte, wie es sein Vorfahr in alt- babylonischer Zeit tat, der Hbrnerkronen auf den Kipfen fast aller rundplastischen Gotterbilder kannte:209 Although the horned crown was not as common in the Neo-Babylonian period as in earlier periods-which may have more to do with the decline in the depiction of anthropomorphic deities than with an abandonment of the horned crown itself-I doubt that the image would have been so obscure to a Babylonian of the 9th century as to require an explicatory caption. At least as late as the reign of Marduk-apla-iddina I (c. 1173- 1161) deities were still being portrayed with horned crowns, rendered, significantly, in pro- file.210 And throughout the first millennium the horned crown was a regular motif on kudurrus, depicted frontally upon temple-facade socles and serving as the emblems of Anu and Enlil.211 The crowns of Anu and Enlil are telling in this regard. Texts referring to the fashioning of the crowns (aga) for these gods and their involvement in rituals demonstrate that they were more than mere images etched in relief, but actual objects fashioned in the round.212 And SB literary texts make reference to the "wearing" of the agi of Anu and Enlil,213 and, as previously discussed, texts that were known in first-millennium Baby- lonia describe divine crowns as consisting of horns (qarnu).214 Moreover, Neo-Babylonian seals occa- sionally attest the horned headdress depicted in profile when worn by minor deities.215 Of course, in contemporaneous Assyria the horned crown was still very much alive and well.216 All told, it is "(you) of the crown of horns" (BA 5/5 [1906] 638 no. 7 rev. 19f.); Lugalbanda: apir agd Sa qarni karpasati "he wears a crown of magnificent horns" (OrNS 36 [1967] 126: 171).

WOODS difficult to believe that a simple change of per- spective-i.e., depicted in profile rather than fron- tally, and the fact that the crown is worn by a deity instead of resting upon a socle-would ren- der the image incomprehensible, only to be given meaning by a term that is even more obscure than the image itself. There have been yet other inter- pretations of these captions, but similar to the case of mugttmi discussed above-which thrusts the verb into a very rare and uncomfortable usage of the Gt, and from there into an even rarer, if not completely unattested participial formation of that meaning-these readings force the cap- tions into translation by inventing otherwise un- attested lexemes. Hence, King's mufAu: AGA dUTU / mul-fi MIN, "crown of SamaS, rod of same;"217 and Wiggermann's sirpanu: AGA dUTU / sir-pani MIN, "crown of SamaS, (a dress of) red wool of same."'218 The reading of the captions accepted here matches the relief quite well if one accepts that the canopy represents a simplified, schematic rep- resentation of a snake-body from which the human torsos emerge. And this may very well be the case; for as previously noted, certain elements of the relief, e.g., the bison-men, the lion faces, and the three approaching figures, are similarly portrayed with little detail. Seidl's objection notwithstanding, several kudurrus depict snakes that are appar- ently without pattern or detail.219 Naturally, the timmu must correspond to the palm column and the Apsfi must be represented by the series of wavy lines at the base of the image. The captions serve to identify the image and elucidate its more obscure elements, which, based on arcane and archaic iconography, must have been readily accessible only to the initiate. Inter- estingly, the inclusion of such explanatory captions seems to have been a practice confined primarily to the time of Nabfi-apla-iddina; of the four ku- durrus with captions, three are dated to this king's reign.220 As a group, the SGT captions have a tele- scoping effect if read in the order presented above. The first caption, located in the neutral, empty space of the tablet's upper left-corner, describes the central theme of the relief, the depiction of SamaS in his shrine, and serves as a title for the tablet, reiterating the incipit of the narrative. The second caption labels the individual elements of the unique shrine by way of mapping their posi- tions with respect to the three chief astral deities, Sin, Samag, and I~tar. The inclusion of these deities on the relief is probably in deference to the standard iconographic conventions of ku- durrus, which dictate that their representation in astral form, in this particular order, is all but re- quired. The third caption is entirely devoted to the description and identification of Nirah whose inclusion in the image is the least expected. I sub- mit that MUS.IGI.MIN is not a descriptive proper name of Nirah, so Jacobsen's "the chief constable of Shamash, Mush-igimin"221 but is rather a de- scription of Nirah's portrayal on the relief as two upper bodies emerging from a single ophidian form. Therefore, this line is to be understood as "the snake (depicted) with two front parts,' i.e., in overlapping profile.222 217. BBSt., 121 n. 2. Hilprecht (Explorations in Bible Lands, 271 n. 1) understands muffu as the D imp. of a verb mayGa meaning 'to be bright, i.e., "tiara of SamaS, make the tiara of SamaS bright,' assuming ma-ku-u is synonymous with na-ma- ru in 2R 47 rev. i 58f. as both are offered in this commentary as readings of ZAL; however, magi is rather to be connected with the verb fumsi 'to spend the night awake, to stay over- night' (see CAD M/1 sub maif B; S/3 sub fumgi2). 218. If such a garment belonged to SamaS's wardrobe (and, presumably, it would be an important piece given that the deity is depicted wearing it on the relief and that it war- ranted an explicatory label), one might expect it to be listed among either the garments offered at the time of the com- memoration of the statue or the subsequent lubugtu offerings. Wiggermann's reading is quoted in Jonker, Remembrance, 164 n. 37. 219. E.g., Meli-Sipak, BBSt., pl. 18; Nabfi-mukin-apli, BBSt., pls. 76-78; undated fragment, BBSt., pl. 81-lacking scale- pattern or is it effaced in these cases? 220.

The identification of Nirah as a member of Samag's court is, as far as I am aware, unknown to any theological or learned tradition in Mesopotamia. Arguably, it was for precisely this reason that the designers of the relief deemed it necessary to in- clude an explicatory label describing his connec- tion with SamaS. Yet, there must have been some basis for this association other than that Nirah's lithe ophidian body lends itself to various and sundry architectural functions. The specification of Nirah as nagir Samai, coupled with the pur- poseful inclusion of other elements in the relief, bespeaks an underlying significance to Nirah's incorporation. The reading of dMUS in third-millennium texts remains entangled.223 The logogram may be read as either Nirah, the deified snake,224 or as Irhan, the divine genius symbolic of the western branch of the Euphrates-a metaphorical reflection of the river's sinuous meanders and a likening of the ap- parent rejuvenative power of snakes to the river's ability to ever replenish itself.225 The Irban cult is attested only at Ur, where in the Ur III period the riverine deity and associated cultic person- nel receive offerings during the akttu festival; the cult, however, does not appear to have sur- vived beyond the third millennium.226 The cult of Nirah is somewhat better attested if onomastic evidence is any indication of worship, the god occurring in names from the Old Akkadian through Middle Babylonian periods. There is no evidence of offerings to Nirah, although an OB year name from the Diyala mentions a throne and dais for the god while other sources cite Nirah as an apotropaic deity in the Ekur/E~ara.227 In at least some traditions the two gods may have been later syncretized, or, possibly, were in origin one and the same deity-a proposal that finds support in the obvious phonological,228 semantic, and graphic similarities between the two, as well as the occa- sional alternation between Nirah and Irhan in the scholarly tradition.229 223. G. J. P McEwan prefers the reading /nirah/ for third- millennium texts, except in lexicographical contexts and in instances where /irban/ could be directly shown to be the cor- rect reading; he assigned the logogram dMUS.i-.DIN.DUB and related logograms to the reading /irhan/, which is indeed the usual writing for this lexeme ("dMUS and Related Matters;' OrNS 52 [1983] 215-29). However, there is ample evidence to demonstrate that dMUS has the reading /irban/ as early as the Fara period (Steinkeller, Sale Documents, 244 n. 8; also Gelb, Kudurrus, 150). Thus, as recently pointed out by F. A. M. Wiggermann (TSG, 43 n. 89; "Nirah, Irban,' RLA 9 [2001] 571), the early histories of these two deities remain intertwined. During the second and first millennia, dMUS and dMUS. DIN.DUB are differentiated, but to what end is uncertain, as dMUS still carries the reading /irban/ (e.g., MSL 14, 143: 14' [Proto-Ea]; An I 275) in addition to the regular /nirab/ (TSG, 43 n. 89). For recent treatments on the reading of dMUS and related logograms, see also B. Alster and A. Westenholz, "The Barton Cylinder,' ASJ 16 (1994): 86 ad xii 7; R. Biggs, "The Aba Salabikh Tablets: A Preliminary Survey,' JCS 20 (1966) 80 n. 54; R.

That Irban was a literary name for the Purattu (Euphrates)/Arahtu is demonstrated by the lexographical and scholarly traditions: [iddMUS.TIN.TIR.DUJB : pu-rat-tum (Anta- gal J ii 6'); dirb!-ha-an : pu-rat-tP (BA 28 [1931] 184 ii 6, Surpu comm.); [id.dMUS.D]IN.TIR.DUB : a-ra-ah-tum (ErimhuS VI 48). The term Arahtu is currently understood as designating the western branch of the Euphrates. As described by A. R. George, "(the Arahtu) appears to have increased in importance as the eastern branch, flowing through KiS and Nippur, became less navigable and its banks less fertile. By the first millennium the Arahtu branch had become the main course of the Euphrates in Babylonia, and the names Arabtu and Purattu were used synonymously for the river that flowed through the city of Babylon" (George, Topographical Texts, 351). 226. The onomastic evidence suggests that the cult was de- funct by the OB period, after which point the deity is men- tioned primarily in lexical lists and the odd incantation or medical text (McEwan, OrNS 52 [1983] 215-29). 227. See Wiggermann, RLA 9 (2001) 573-74, with references. 228. Wiggermann observes that Arabtu and Irhan share a common Semitic origin, both stemming from the root 3rh 'to go en route, Irban attesting the suffix -an commonly encoun- tered in early West-Semitic dialects (RLA 9 [2001] 570; TSG, 43 n. 89, with references; of. n. 231 below). Wiggermann, how- ever, denies an etmological relationship between Nirab and Irban since they are "different gods" (RLA 9 [2001] 572)-an unlikely proposition in my opinion given the relationships between the two deities outlined above (further, note Kre- bernik's suggestion that both /nirah/and /irhan/may stem from an orignial *nirhan [Krebernik Beschw6rungen, 333 n. 184]). 229. Specifically, note that in the OB forerunner to An, dMUS is associated with three protective deities (d.'a-laAlid, dUdug-ka-ka, dLamma-ka-ka [TCL 15, 10: 141-44]). Presum- ably dMUS here represents Nirah, since elsewhere dMUS in</page><page sequence="46">68 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS Nirabl is both the son and messenger of I~ta- ran,230 the chief deity of Der on the Elamite bor- der. It seems likely that Ibtaran, in his original manifestation, had no association with chthonic snake gods. As both of his names indicate, I~tar-an "the two I~tars'231 referring to Venus as the morn- ing and evening star, and "Great AN" (An-gal/An raba), he is in origin an astral deity-a view that finds support in his marriage to Manzat, the rain- bow.232 His association with the chthonic Nirab must have been a secondary development owing to the location of his cult center, Der, near the Iranian plateau where, as recently described by Wiggermann, there was a long tradition of chthonic snake gods.233 These two seemingly in- congruous characteristics of I~taran may be the result of syncretism between an astral Igtar-type god and a local snake deity. Igtaran and Nirab appear to have enjoyed a particulary close association, as Nirah also served as the iconographic representative of Igtaran234 and two late traditions considered the two gods to have been so close as to be identical.23""5 In Sar- gonic seals, it is likely Nirah, or Nirab as sym- bolic of I~taran, that is portrayed as a snake god with an anthropomorphic upper body and lower body of a snake. In these scenes he is often de- picted receiving guests and sitting on his coils (figs. 29-32); occasionally, he holds his tail which may terminate in a dragon's or a snake's head and he is portrayed with either a single-horned head- dress indicative of divinity or with a flat cap.236 As observed by Wiggermann, the scene may also apotropaic function is rendered as Nirab (ES: Seral), e.g., dSe- ra-ah : dMUS : udug-e-dir-ra-ke4 (Emesal Voc. I 19); dSe-lah4-e dUdug-.-.ir-ra (var. i-dug--lir-ra) (Cohen Lamentations, 282: 187; 357: 203); dSe-ra-ab udug-&amp;-sir-ra : dMUS ra-bi-is E su-ma (Cohen Lamentations, 235: 265; 304: 139). However, in the later, canonical version of this passage (but here cited as one of six protective deities [udug] of the Ekur), dMUS is glossed d(tr'-bta-an)MUS (An 1 275). 230. dMUS fipru fa dKA.DI "Nirab messenger of IHtaran" (MDP 2, 91: 23, Nazi-MarutaS); dMUS ilu tipf mar btti Sa Der, "Niral, the resplendent god, the first-born son of Der" (BBSt., no. 6 ii 49, Nebuchadnezzar I).

McEwan has identified the Snake-god holding court on Sargonic seals as Nirab (OrNS 52 [1983] 221). However, Wiggermann argues that this deity must represent Itaran, as an identification with Nirab "would leave the identity of the master open and give a servant god the iconography of an in- dependent lord" (TSG, 44). Seemingly in favor of McEwan's hypothesis is a seal depicting the Snake-god holding court with what appears to be the signs MUS DINGIR inscribed in the empty space of the scene (CS, pl. 21b), although, as noted by Frankfort, the sign MUS "so closely resembles similar 'stan- dards' depicted with Sun-gods and other deities, or even in simple friezes, that its relevancy may well be doubted, espe- cially as the seals of the period never carry any writing which could be connected with the design" (CS, 121; note, however, in this regard, the presence of a BU sign [MUSx, i.e., guna-less MUS] on a third-millennium terracotta snake head, an object that perhaps had cultic significance [MDP 12, 155 fig. 211; see also Wiggermann, RLA 9 (2001) 573]). Thus the identity of this god remains uncertain. Quite possibly, Nirab came to repre- sent a chthonic aspect of the astral deity IEtaran. This associa- tion became so close that Nirab's ophidian image was not only the symbol of Iltaran (as is demonstrated by the Nazi-MarutaS kudurru cited above, in which Nirab as "messenger of Itaran" [MDP 2, 91: 23] is listed among the emblems and symbols of other deities), but also the principle, if not the only, form in which IEtaran was portrayed-a suggestion that is supported by the absence of an established, independent depiction of this deity The basis for this identification would, of course, lie in Nirab's three-fold role as son, messenger, and symbol of IEtaran; in turn, this would have laid the basis for the com- plete syncretism as evidenced by first-millennium sources (see n. 235). 235. dMUS = dKA.DI (5R 31, 2 rev. 3 [30]); in the Sultan- tepe god list Nirah occurs in a case together with dKA.DI and AN.GAL, both names for IEtaran [dMUS is the first divine name listed] [STT 376 iii 11'-13', 379 iii 30f.]). Further, note that a Su-ila prayer to Nisaba mentions Nirab immediately prior to Enlil and Ninlil, a position that suggests an associa- tion with Anum (W G. Lambert, "Literary Texts from Nim- rud7' AfO 46-47 [1999-2000] 154-55)-as previously noted, a priviledge otherwise reserved for the astral deity Itaran (An-gal). Recall that the Nebuchadnezzar I kudurru (BBSt., no. 6; see n. 230), Nirah carries the epithet ilu Aippi mar biti ga De~r "the resplendent god, the first-born son of Der" (ii 49) and is invoked along with the major deities Adad, Nergal, and Nanaya; one would perhaps expect Itaran here if Itaran were indeed distinguished from dMUS. 236.

However, his association with SamaS's court is a different matter. The simplest explanation may lie in the well-known ED and Sargonic motif of the Sun- god in his boat (figs. 33-37). The central focus of these scenes is a god seated in a boat which, simi- lar to Sargonic depictions of Nirah/Iitaran, con- sists of a snake with an anthropomorphic upper body serving as the boat's prow.239 The Snake-god's tail comprises the stern of the boat, occasionally terminating in a snake's or dragon's head.

There is a consensus that the seated deity represents SamaS, judging from the rays emanat- ing from the deity's shoulders, and that the entire scene, as suggested by Frankfort and others, may depict SamaS's240 nightly voyagp across the sub- terranean waters of the netherworld.241 As I have argued, several aspects of the SGT relief strongly suggest that its designers were in possession of antiquities that reflected common archaic motifs and styles. It may be that the trea- sury of the Ebabbar-and finds at Abi Habba in- dicate that such a structure did exist-contained third-millennium seals of this type. It will be re- membered that Rassam's finds in the NB levels of the Ebabbar complex included a considerable number of Sargonic and ED antiquities. The like- lihood that such seals could have been found in the first millennium is increased when one ob- serves that the motif of the "Sun-god in his boat" represents, with no less than fifty attestations, "the most common mythological scene that is documented on third millennium seals:'."242 This is not to say the Boat-god was actually Nirah,243 240. CS, 67-70, 108-10; Frankfort, Art and Architecture, 90-91; See also P. Amiet, La glyptique misopotamienne archaique, 2nd ed. (Paris: Centre national de la recherche scientifique, 1980), nos. 1408-448; W G. Lambert, "Sumerian Gods: Combining the Evidence of Texts and Art:' in Sumerian Gods and Their Representations, Cuneiform Monographs 7, ed. I. L. Finkel and M. J. Geller (Groningen: Styx publications, 1997), 7-8; Steinkeller, Quaderni di Semitistica 18, 256-67. 241. Collon has connected the scene with the journey of the Moon-god, claiming that, in at least certain scenes, crescent- shaped headdresses and standards argue for this identifica- tion (D. Collon, "Moon, boats and battle;' in Sumerian Gods and Their Representations, Cuneiform Monographs 7, ed. I. L. Finkel and M. J. Geller [Groningen: Styx, 1997], 12-13). In fact, there is no obvious reason why both gods cannot share this theme, as their respective daily and nightly journeys take them along the same cosmic path (see n. 243 below for the association of Nirab with Enki and his boat). It is important to point out in this connection that the previously discussed Early Dynastic SamaS myth (ARET 5, 6; OIP 99, 326+342) con- tains several references to the Abzu and Enki/Ea and may therefore, as suggested by Steinkeller (Quaderni di Semitis- tica 18, 258 n. 39), describe an encounter between these two gods as SamaS makes his nightly journey through Enki/Ea's subterranean realm (note the following passage from Temple Hymns, 17: 15-16, also cited by Steinkeller: bi Abzu ki-zu ki- gal-zu ki dUtu-ra ghi-dd-za "the shrine Abzu is your [Enki's] place, your Netherworld; it is there that you call/greet Utu"). Two Sargonic seals, also cited by Steinkeller, may depict just such a meeting, i.e., the Sun-god approaches Enki/Ea en- shrined within the Abzu (EGA, nos. 1139, 1140). 242. Steinkeller, Quaderni di Semitistica 18, 256. 243. B. Landsberger connected the Boat-god with Enki's skipper, (Nin)sirsir 'the slithering one,: but this has not been proven ("Assyriologische Notizen: I. Der Schiffergott Sirsir:' WO 1 [1950] 362-66). Intriguing, however, in terms of associ- ating Nirab with the Boat-god and the Apsfi (through which SamaS's must pass in his nightly journey) is the following pas- sage from Gudea Cyl. A, ig-ba di-kug im-li-ne dNirah-kug-Abzu giin-a-bm "into its doors they were stretching shining ropes, they were like the Apsfi's bright speckled Nirab" (xxvi 30-xxvii 1). And there are other contexts in which IHtaran/dMUS is connected with boats and water. In Enki's Journey to Nippur, Nirah is described as Enki's punting-pole as he navigates the Euphrates in his boat, idBuranuna u18-lu Siir mu-un-da-an-zig gi-mu8-a-ni dNirah-a-ni gsgisal-a-ni gi tur-tur-a-ni dEn-ki u5-a- ni mu h6-gil sii-ga g&lt;mi ni-bi nam-du8 di ni-bi nam-dab5 "the Euphrates rises before him as it does before the furious south wind. His punting pole is his Nirah; his oars are his small reeds. When Enki embarks, the year will be full of abundance. The boat departs by itself, seizing the tow rope by itself" (85-89). In NingiSzida's Journey to the Nether World, Ibtaran, who is equated with Ningiizida, sets sail for the netherworld in a</page><page sequence="50">72 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS although, as Wiggermann notes, the fact that Sun- god in his boat and the Nirabl motifs share com- mon temporal and geographical distribution (late ED/Sargonic periods, and the Diyala/Hamrin ba- sin) and that both scenes seem to involve agri- culture and vegetation may point to a "common underlying mythology in the transtigridian re- gion:'."244 The scholars and priests of the Ebabbar may have been as ignorant about this scene as we. They may simply have recognized the seated deity as SamaS and then equated the Boat-god with Ni- rab/Istaran based purely on the visual similarity. Presumably, the iconography surrounding Nirab/ I~taran would have been much more accessible given that Nirab as representative of IJtaran was a common element in the repertoire of kudurru symbols. Having come to the conclusion that the anthropomorphic Snake-god represented an an- cient adjunct of Samag, the artists depicted the deity in duplicate, thus imitating the conventional portrayal of SamaS's other long-time adjunct, the bison-man.245 Naturally, an understanding of Igta- ran as in origin a dual or twin deity based on an etymology Igtar-an (dual) may go some way to clarifying the twin portrayal of Nira--either sym- bolic of, or identical to, IJtaran-as well as the lit- eral designation MUS.IGI.MIN "the two-faced snake:'." Additionally, there may have been strong theo- logical and political incentives for enlisting Ni- ral into SamaS's court. As Myers has shown, while the pantheon of Sippar is relatively conservative with regard to the major deities (e.g., SamaS, Aya, Adad, IJtar, Anunitu), it is quite volatile, diachro- nically, with respect to the minor deities, with vari- ous additions and subtractions attested between the OB and NB periods.246 Although admittedly little is known about the characters of IJtaran and his symbolic manifestation Nirah, there can be no doubt that the aspect of divine judge and arbitrator was among IJtaran's main attributes."27 Thus, in this defining role, Igtaran is quite similar to Samal-so much so that Gudea mentions both gods metaphorically in the same breath, "In the Ebabbar, the place of my instruction, the place of my shining like Utu, at that place, like I~taran I justly decide the lawsuits of my city."248 The asso- boat, dlItaran igi Suba-ke4 ga-ba-db-us SeS-mu ga-ba-de-u5 "O IHtaran of the bright visage, let me sail away with you, my brother let me sail away with you" (16); also, dlItaran igi Suba-ke4 mi-gur8 ri-da-ni Tu gid-da "to lend a hand to IHtaran of the bright visage who drifts away on a barge" (6). More tentatively, that IHtaran assumed the form of a boat, or is at least associated with boats, may be implied by Ur III refer- ences to ud dlitaran in-da-a, where the verb da-which occurs elsewhere in connection with boats, quays, and winds- suggests a meaning "to blow or sail awayf' i.e., "when IHtaran set sail/departed;" in other contexts, however, the verb has a broader meaning, "to ascend, lead away'." See Sallaberger Kal- ender, vol. 1, 180-81, particularly, 181 n. 851. 244. TSG, 47. 245. Note that during the first millennium, both the bison- man and Nirah served an apotropaic function. For the bison- man, see Green, Visible Religion 3 (1984) 84-86. As previously noted, Nirab was the protective spirit (udug) of the Ekur/ Elara. The doubling or pairing of members of SamaS's court is not limited to these adjuncts, note also dNig-zid-rdal = sukkal i-zid-da-ke4 "vizier of the right side7' dNig-si-si = sukkal i-ghb- bu-ke4 "vizier of the left side;' among other viziers of Sama's court (An III 139-40). 246.

Similarly, Sulgi, in his role as administrator of justice, fre- quently identifies himself with IEtaran: dI~taran ki-en-gi-ra Mag4- ta nig-nam zu-i di kalam-ma ki-bi-i9 i-kud-re6 ga-ei8 &lt;sar? kalam-ma ki-bi-i: i-ba-re "he [Sulgi], the IHtaran of Sumer, omniscient from birth, firmly decrees the judgments of the land, firmly makes the decisions of the land" (Sulgi X 142- 44); Sag4-mu dItaran kur-kur-ra-me-in "my heart enables me to be the IHtaran of the foreign lands" (Sulgi C 104); with ref- erence to GilgameS: dSul-[gi] rsipadl zid ki-en-gi-ra-ke4 SeS rku-lil-ni en dBil-ga-mes nam-kalag-ga-na mu-ni-in-i-i nam- ur-sag-gi-na mu-ni-in-pid-pid dIqtaran di-kud kalam-ma til-la "Sulgi, the true shepherd of Sumer, praised his brother and friend the lord GilgameS because of his might, and declared him because of his heroism: 'Itaran, the judge who dwells in the Land'" (Sulgi O 138-42). IHtaran is also described as a judge in the Nanie Hymn (although the text is broken, note the association with the ophidian Ningitzida): sipad mas-su kalam-ma [...] gil kur-kur-ra dIgtaran rdil si si-a rkalaml-a til-la-hm KA [...]dNin-gig-zid-da-ke4 [...] rmil-ni-in-dabs "The shepherd, the counselor of the Land,... of the countries, Ibta- ran, who decides lawsuits justly, who lives in the Land...

The River- god, (d)iD, the "just judge"250--the hypostasis of river's cleansing powers that wash away evil and clear the innocent-is well known in association with the river ordeal. The water deity Nammu, al- though better known as a mother goddess, is both directly and indirectly equated with diD in later periods,251 a fact that is reflected, on some level, in the shared graph ENGUR of both names. This passage is reminiscent of a Sakkanakkum-period inscription"" which similarly mentions I~taran and diD, together with dMAS.TAB.BA, the divine twins. This last designation later tradition assigns to the underworld pair Lugal-irra and Meslamta- ea,253 both of whom are labeled "Lords of the River" and are connected to the River Ordeal and the administration of justice in a hymnic cycle celebrating Ibbi-Sin.254 This text is not known measured it off and erected a stele at that place (Entemena 28-29 i 1-12). IEtaran's role as judge is attested as early as ED III, as demonstrated by the following passage from an Abo Salabib literary text: dI~taran di nu-mi-kud "IEtaran did not pass judgement" (OIP 99, 328 viii 1-2). That IEtaran retained this characteristic into the first millennium is reflected in a passage from the Erra Epic, in which IEtaran states, anaku ailu altya De~r dini kitti ul addn purussi mati ul aparras "I, on account of my city, Der, will not judge truthful judgments, I will not make decisions for the country" (IV 70-71). 249.

Further, note the occurrence of diD im- mediately following SamaS in an OB incantation (Bdhl Lei- den Coll. 2, 3: 8). 250. diD dayyan kHttim (CT 29, 43: 27). Although usually masculine, diD on occasion may be understood as feminine (e.g., T.

Similarly, riverine Irhan may be construed as feminine, e.g., idIrhan ina kibrria 'River Ir- ban with her banks' (CT 23, 1: 7, also 2: 20 [broken]; Kdcher, BAM 2, 124 iv 7, 127: 7). 251. Thus a reading here of Nammu is preferable to Engur. A Sultantepe duplicate of an incantation against eye disease replaces Nammu with dfD (STT 279 rev. 41, 47; cf. Kdcher, BAM 6, 510 iv 14 [= 513 iv 20]; see E A. M. Wiggermann, "Nammu7' RLA 9 [1998] 138). W. G. Lambert observes that in An II diD appears "at the point where parallel listings would lead one to expect Nammu, who is lacking from the list at this point" ("Kosmogonie,' RLA 6 [1980-83] 220). Note that the River-god carries the epithets ID DINGIR bandt kalama "River, Divine Creatrix of everything,' common in namburbi rituals (OrNS 39 [1970] 135: 21; also OrNS 34 [1965] 127 rev. 7, OrNS 36 [1967] 4: 6), and ID DINGIR bandt ili u ameli "River, Divine Creatrix of god and man" (TuL, 125: 14-15 [KAR 227]).

WOODS from an original, but from a Neo-Babylonian copy of a stele found, curiously, at Sippar.255 Hence, in first-millennium Sippar the judicial as- pect of IJtaran was not unknown, nor was that of the River-god, dfD, whose invocation in conjunc- tion with Ibtaran recalls dMUS of the SGT; for dMUS is not only the symbol and manifestation of IJtaran, but, as Irhan, the river par excellence itself, the Euphrates. Further, the location of Der due east of Sippar, at the foot of the eastern mountains, the very place of Samag's rising, could only have served to mag- nify IJtaran's resemblance to SamaS in the minds of the Ebabbar theologians.25"6 And it may have been this shared judicial function that made the recruitment of Igtaran, or Nirab as the symbolic manifestation of Igtaran, into SamaS's entourage theologically comprehensible. In a similar fash- ion, we note that the concepts truth, justice, and judgment, virtues central to SamaS's identity, were personified and likewise incorporated into Samag's court, i.e., Umu, Kittu, Milaru, in addition to Day- yanu, the divine judge.257 Another bit of evidence perhaps suggestive of a link between SamaS and I~taran comes from Der itself in the form of an inscribed brick.258 The brick bears a simple building inscription com- memorating Kurigalzu's restoration of I~taran's temple, Edimgalkalama. The inscription, however, is of secondary interest-it is the drawings above and below the inscription that are remarkable (fig. 38). Above is a skirted figure, clearly Egyp- tian in style, wearing a double-plumed headdress and carrying a w3s scepter in his left hand, and an Cnh symbol in his right; below, again in un- mistakable Egyptian fashion, is a sun disk with a snake (uraeus) above it. Smith surmised that the figure was Onuris, a shadowy god who brings back the eye of the sun from afar (the name translated literary, 'He who brings the distant one'). The brick, he argued, was fashioned by an Egyptian living at Der, perhaps a prisoner of war captured during a campaign in the West.259 While reasons behind this Egyptian's presence at Der must re- main elusive, an attempt to decipher the iconog- raphy of the piece meets with somewhat better, if not conclusive, success. Although an identifi- cation with the minor deity Onuris cannot be ruled out, a more obvious choice would be the pre- eminent solar deity Amun-Ra.260 That the figure is portrayed carrying a wgs scepter rather than a lance argues against an identification with Onuris, while the double-plumed crown is a regular part of the Amun-Ra iconography. Further, the combi- nation of the sun disk and uraeus below the in- scription can be read rC 'sun,' signifying the Sun- god, Ra261-a logographic writing identifying the 255.

The association between snakes, jus- tice, and the iconography of the Sun-god is aptly captured on an seal impression from Haft Tepe Iran-the Iranian plateau being well known for its chthonic snake gods and not far re- moved from the Mesopotamian snake-cult centers of Der and Einunna. The early second-millennium seal belongs to a judge and the inscription mentions the deities Napiria and Iniuhinak. The image depicts a deity seated upon a coiled ser- pentine throne which in turn rests on a high pedestal consist- ing, notably, of two intertwined snakes (P Amiet, "Glyptique dlamite h propos de documents nouveux7' Arts Asiatiques 26 [1978] no. 48; P de Miroschedji, "Le dieu 6lamite au serpent et aux eaux jaillissantes,' Iranica Antiqua 16 [1981] pl. 2 no. 5); the pedestal itself is supported by what are possibly two kneeling bison-men and scalloped mountains at the base of the image create the setting of the scene. The quality of the sealing is relatively poor. Both Amiet and de Miroschedji suggest that the two kneeling figures are "naked heroes;" how- ever, the presence of mountains and the hint of horns on both figures (see de Miroschedji's drawing, pl. 2 no. 5) would seem- ingly make bison-men more likely 258.

Certainly one would ex- pect the image to be related to the inscription, and some syncretic impetus to lie behind the Egyp- tian god in the one and the Mesopotamian god in the other. Perhaps for this Egyptian at Der Ibta- ran was so closely allied to SamaS in function that, when rendered in the iconographic language of his homeland, the god was most aptly articulated as the solar deity par excellence, (Amun-)Ra.262 Finally, if Lambert is correct in ascribing the Erra Epic in its present form to Nabf-apla-iddina's reign-suggesting that the Sutian attacks rhapso- dized in the epic represent none other than those the SGT attributes to Adad-apla-iddina's reign- then there may have been a political motive as well for enlisting Nirah/IJtaran into SamaS's circle during Nabfi-apla-iddina's reign; for then the re- turn of Der into Babylonian hands, as is clearly suggested by the end of the epic, would be among this king's many achievements.263 The theologians of the Ebabbar may have been tempted to press Nirahl, as the symbol of IEtaran, into the service of SamaS based on their shared aspect of divine judge and the desire to establish a hierarchy be- tween the two. Thus, they may have made a minor addition to the divine retinue of Ebabbar, reflect- ing Der's incorporation into a united Babylonia under Nabi-apla-iddina. In so doing, the priests would have projected political developments onto the theological plane-a familiar occurrence in the history of Mesopotamia. Final Remarks Although the relief is clearly reminiscent of the presentation scene of former ages, it is so only in form, not spirit; for while the participants have remained unchanged, the introduction of interceding objects has obstructed the intimacy that the scene once conveyed in its original, third-millennium design. Divinity is still anthro- pomorphized, but now it is transcendent and in- accessible. The deity is accessible only in his symbolic form, but even in this more approach- able manifestation he overwhelms his worship- pers. Nabf-nadin-Sumi, the langfi priest, can only grasp the stool; the sun disk is still beyond his reach. Greater yet is the deity himself who looms large over his symbol. In this way the relief ex- presses its concern for order and hierarchy. This is made plain not only by the relative size it as- cribes to each, but by way of subtler distinctions as well. The portrayal of the deity's face was executed with great care for detail, in contrast to the three approaching figures who are depicted coarsely, giving the impression of anonymity when com- pared to the deity. While the bases of both the pedestal and the throne are fashioned after moun- tains, the throne is designed with two rows and the pedestal with only one-again symbolic of the relative rank of the deity vis-d-vis his icon. Simi- larly, SamaS wears a divine headdress of four horns whereas the interceding goddess, the pro- tomes, and the bison-men wear headdresses of only three horns. Both of these adjuncts are not only duplicated, but perform a similar service. The two bison-men do not actually support the throne of the god, rather they brace the doors which sup- port the throne upon which the deity is seated. Likewise, the upper bodies of Nirab demonstrate the same indirect relationship with the sun disk. They do not steady the sun disk directly, but sup- port the stool which holds the pedestal upon which the sun disk rests. The representations of Sin, SamaS, and Igtar in their astral forms within the shrine, as well as the presence of the Apsfi at the base of the image, 262. The writing of Ra beneath the inscription (written, perhaps significantly, not as a ligature as is usual, but as two separate graphs 'snake' [uraeus] + 'sun') may have provided the added benefit of various graphic plays on ophidian Nirabh and astral Ibtaran, SamaS, and Ra. 263. Lambert, AfO 18 (1957-58) 396-98; Brinkman PKB, 191. According to the Erra Epic, Sutian attacks were responsi- ble for the destruction of Babylon, Sippar, Uruk, Dfr-Kurigalzu and Der. Based on the nearly identical list of vanquished cities at the hands of the same aggressor in Chronicle 24 (Eclectic Chronicle, see n. 90 above), Lambert dates the setting of the epic to the reign of Adad-apla-iddina (Lambert, AfO 18 [1957- 58] 398). Nabfi-apla-iddina's reign would then represent the period "when the Sutian invasions of the recent past were no longer a threat and could be speculated upon from a theologi- cal point of view" (Brinkman PKB, 191).</page><page sequence="55">THE SUN-GOD TABLET OF NABU-APLA-IDDINA REVISITED 77 have led scholars to describe the SGT as "summing up the Babylonian (and Biblical) cosmogony, with its distinct tripartite division of firmament, land, and water"264 While this is undoubtedly the set- ting of the scene, it is not the central focus. The relief is not so much concerned with the division of the cosmos as it is with the tripartite division of the cult-defining the appropriate distances be- tween man, symbol, and deity. Reading the image from left to right, the interceding goddess is de- picted slightly larger than the king, who in turn is slightly larger than the langi2 priest. At this point, the trend of gradually decreasing figures reverses itself; the symbol towers over the figures and, to an equal measure, the deity looms large over his symbol. The significance of each element is in accord with its stature; the differences be- tween the approaching figures are seemingly triv- ial when compared to that between the figures and the symbol and then again to the deity. The setting of this scene, the tripartite division of the cosmos as reflected in the vertical axis of the re- lief-Apsfi, earth, and heaven-serves merely to underscore the profundity of this hierarchy. The relative ranking of the symbol and the deity-or the statue as the principal manifestation of the deity-is paralleled in the text; for while the symbol could substitute for the deity as a tem- porary measure, it was deemed unacceptable as a permanent replacement. Only the presence of the cult statue could insure the full resurrection and operation of the cult. Yet, the fashioning of a new statue notwithstanding, the relief retains the sun disk as a lesser representative of the deity. In this way the image symbolically reflects the two phases of history described in the text; for clearly the inscription distinguishes the time prior to Nabi- apla-iddina's reign, which was marked by Simbar- lipak's installation of the sun disk, from the time of Nabfi-apla-iddina's reign, which is marked by the installation of the cult statue. These two pe- riods pivot on the single word arkanu, "later" (ii 17), which serves as a temporal partition. This duality is further expressed metaphorically as a play on day and night. SamaS's reappearance (usahhira pani~u; iii 18) in Nabfi-apla-iddina's reign is symbolized by the iconography of his throne-a clear tribute to the Sun-god's morning ascent, or, quite literally, to his appearance. If the suggestion offered here, that the inclusion of dMUS in the image was inspired by the archaic iconography of ED and Sargonic Boat-god scenes, and Frankfort's interpretation of this scene are both correct, then herein may lie the metaphori- cal imagery for night. Nirah, as a representative of the Sun-god's boat, symbolic of his nightly journey across the subterranean waters of the netherworld, is physically linked, quite fittingly, to the symbol of the deity, i.e., the sun disk, during his absence-the permanent night before Nabf- apla-iddina's reign (panrtu la iddinfu; i 15). Thus, there is a complete parallelism between these two phases of history, the period of SamaS's dis- appearance and the period of his reappearance; between the symbols of those periods, the sun disk and the statue; between their metaphorical expressions of night and day; and finally, be- tween the iconographic representatives of those metaphors, Nirab and the bison-man. This interpretation of the relief also provides an explanation for Nirah's depiction in associa- tion with the Apsfi, for at the far right of the image, Nirah's ophidian body appears to emerge from the Apsf.265 If the Boat-god scenes did in fact represent the Sun-god's nightly travel through 264. Parrot, Nineveh and Babylon, 169. Similarly see, Metz- ger, Kfinigsthron und Gottesthron, vol. 1,229; Jacobsen in An- cient Israelite Religion, 32 n. 24. It appears doubtful that the scalloped edges of the SGT mimic the waters of the Apsfi or the niched facade of the temple-i.e., representing a play upon the setting of this particular scene-as tentatively suggested by Seidl (ZA 91 [2001] 130-31), given that this feature is attested elsewhere in the kudurru corpus, namely, an unpub- lished kudurru from the reign of Adad-apla-iddina (see Slan- ski, JCS 52 [2000] 106). 265. Given that the image is set within the context of a temple, there is an obvious play here on the secondary mean- ing of apsG, i.e., denoting a temple water basin (see CAD A/2 sub apsa mng. 3 with references). See Slanki's discussion in The Babylonian Entitlement Narils, 219; JCS 52 (2000) 110-11.</page><page sequence="56">78 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS subterranean waters in early Semitic mythology, then certainly these waters would have been equated with the Apsf in subsequent Sumero- Babylonian interpretations. And the inclusion of four equidistant stars within the Apsi not only reinforces the cosmological setting of the scene, but also participates in this play upon day and night. The upper portion of the relief is obviously concerned with Samag, the Sun-god, and hence with "day-time" and "day-light." In the Mesopo- tamian mythopoeic conception of the cosmos, the stars were believed to reside in the Apsf (or syn- onymous agrun), or more broadly in the nether- world, during the day, only emerging via the eastern horizon to traverse the heavens at night- fall.266 Thus, as the upper portion of the relief pays tribute to the reappearance of the Sun-god and the glorious daylight that he brings forth, the bottom of the relief depicts the stars within their proper day-time abode, the Apsfi. If there is any significance to the fact that there are four stars, it may be that they represent the four cardinal points, again establishing the grand cosmic scale of the setting of the scene-ana gar erbetti ar- kassina taparras "For all four points of the com- pass you [SamaS] decide their (mankind's) future (through divination)" (SamaS Hymn 152; Lam- bert BWL, 134: 152). Further, Nirab's inclusion in SamaS's entourage as nagir Samag may find an explanation here as well; for, aside from his roles as herald and tax collector, one of the main functions of the nagirum-official was that of night watchman.2"67 But this metaphor of day and night may run deeper still. Du Mesnil du Buisson has con- nected the adjuncts who support the solar disk in Mesopotamia with the iconography of the Syro- Palestinian pair Sahar and Salim, which likewise frequently involves solar imagery. This pair, nat- urally, represents the very embodiment of dawn (.hr) and dusk (ilm).268 Certainly, the occurrence of Nirab on a kudurru comes as no surprise, for the god, depicted natu- ralistically as a snake, is a common iconographic feature of this genre, often forming the outer boundary of the image and partially encircling the symbols of the other deities.269 Yet herein may lie the tangible link between the unique, highly stylized image of the SGT and that of the other, more conventional, members of this corpus; for as Nirab surrounds the other symbols in the tra- ditional kudurru, the god similarly, but in a most unorthodox rendition of this scene, envelopes the astral forms of Sin, SamaS, and Igtar in the SGT image. However, in both cases the prominence accorded Nirah-by his encircling the symbols of the major gods and his relatively large image scale-would appear, at first glance, to be in dis- proportion to what is known of this deity's impor- 266. For a discussion of stars originating in the Apsfi, see R. Caplice, "E.NUN in Mesopotamian Literature7' OrNS 42 (1973) 299-305. Caplice analyzes the following line from a namburbi text which probably refers to a meteorite: 6n mul agrun-ta rO-[a...] an-iir-ta r'i-[a] "Incantation: star which has come forth from the agrun, [star] which has come forth from the horizon;" he concludes that "agrun or kummu is a kenning or alternate name in Mesopotamian mythological texts for the subterranean apsfi, and that it was conceived as the habitat of Enki and the gods associated with him as well as of demons who do harm to men, and the region traversed by the sun in its nighttime passage from setting point to rising point" (OrNS 42 [1978] 304; for the identification of the agrun not only with the apsi, but with the underworld in general, see 301f.). 267. According to Jacobsen the nimgir (nagirum) official "policed the city at night insuring peace and quiet." Jacobsen cites a number of attestations in which the translation "night watchman" is appropriate for this office, most convincingly a description of Hendursag/IEum as "nimgir of the night7' i.e., night watchman: dHendur-sag-gi nimgir ge6-hi-na: [dI~um] na- gir mu-si in CT 16, 49: 304-5; and from the same text, nimgir- sila-a-sig-ga-ke4: nagir saqi Saqummi "night watchman of the quiet street" (CT 16, 15: 21-22); he is similarly mentioned as the enforcer of quiet in SBH 14: 1-2, uri nimgir-ra nu-mu-un- na-ab-si-ga-re ni-bi mnu-1 (dittography-Jacobsen) mu-un-na-ab- si-g[a-im] : alu fa nagiri la r-sah-hi-ru-iu ina ramant.u ug- tahrir "the city which would not quiet down for the night watchman, has quieted down for him by itself" (Akk.

Lambert, for instance, sees the snake of the usual kudurru scene as Irban, a manifesta- tion of the "cosmic river."271 Beyond participating in an iconographic motif common to kudurrus, the appearance of dMUS with some further cos- mological meaning would certainly be in the spirit of the SGT image. The importance of water in Mesopotamian cosmogonic thought cannot be doubted, and the River-god as the hypostasis of this primary ele- ment certainly plays a role in this tradition, as demonstrated by such as epithets ID DINGIR bandt kalama "River, Divine Creatrix of every- thing" and ID DINGIR bandt ili u ameli "River, Divine Creatrix of god and man'272 Irban, as a manifestation of the River-god, would appear to belong to this cosmological conception as well, as is suggested by the title dMUS abu il Sa kiSiati "Irban, father of all the gods" in a hymn to Ni- saba,273 an epithet corroborated by the Kassite per- sonal name dMUS-ki-ilani.274 Also of interest in terms of ascribing a cosmic character to Irban is his early pairing with the primordial Dur (du6-iir/ iir), "Mound;' the name at Ur for Dukug (du6-kug) "Holy Mound'275 a cosmic region located on the eastern horizon that, in one tradition, is associated with the place of the Sun-god's ascent, where des- tinies are determined,276 and in another, is syn- onymous with the Apsi.277 In several Ur III texts Dur and Irhan receive offerings during the Akitu festival;27" and in the Old Babylonian God List the pair Irban and Dur reappear, presumably as hus- band and wife.279 It is possibly in this light that we are to understand a ritual procedure belong- ing to an incantation for swollen joints which con- cludes "you make (the patient) cross over the river Irhan, which you have drawn (around him), seven times and seven times (back), while he crosses you say as follows: (Ea incantation)'."28 Mesopotamian conceptions of cosmic geography may go some way to clarifying this allusion to seven concentric Irhans. Instructive, perhaps, is the notion of seven heavens (an) and seven earths (ki) which is also preserved in Sumerian incantations; quite possibly these regions are to be understood as superimposed, as they were in later Near Eastern traditions."28' What role these seven cosmic regions played in curing the patient is uncertain, but for our purposes this notion is, perhaps, to be taken in conjunction with the cosmographic tradition reflected in the so-called Babylonian Map of the World. Here the earth is surrounded by a circular band with the designa- tion marratu "(cosmic) ocean;' a word written with the ID determinative and therefore regarded, as depicted on the map, as a relatively narrow and river-like body of water.282 Given the penchant of incantations for making reference to cosmographic features, the possibility certainly exists that the seven Irhans of our text are to be associated 270. In other postures, e.g., coiled about the pinnacle of the kudurru or wrapped around the image base, the snake sym- bol similarly gives the impression of importance, e.g., Seidl, Kudurru-Reliefs, pls. 8, 18a, 22a, 30b, c; figs. 7, 22, 23. 271.

Puratti Sa ina mahar Samag izziz(z)u "the Tigris which served Enlil... the Euphrates which served Sa- maS"284-an association that finds its tacit expres- sion in the shared writing of the river, LdUD.KIB. NUN, and the deity's cult center, UD.KIB.NUNki.285 In concluding this paper I would like to com- ment on the historical and historiographic nature of the SGT. Slanski has recently argued that the relief and the text portray different versions of history, that the relief is concerned with under- scoring the fangi priest's role in the endowment, while the text focuses on the king's part.28"6 This view, however, is at odds with the visual and lit- eral parallels observed above. The dynamism ex- hibited by Nabfi-nadin-gumi in the relief, by his grasping of the stool, does not necessarily dictate that he is the principal character of the scene. The lead position in this ritual performance does not equate with the starring role; rather it casts the Jang2 priest as intercessor-the supporting char- acter. Clearly, the depiction of the three approach- ing figures is to be interpreted after the fashion of the third-millennium presentation scenes and in such scenes the interceding goddess plays an anonymous, generic role. The focus is invariably on the central figure, and, as discussed above, this is no more true than in the scenes of the three- figure variety, which were reserved for individu- als of particularly high status. The priest assumes the secondary role of intercessor, a part for which he is suited, given that the scene takes place within his domain, the temple, and it is in this role that he guides the stool bearing the god's symbol into position. Parallels may be sought in the Gudea seal discussed above (fig. 13) and the Disk of Enle- duana (fig. 39). Neither Gudea nor Enheduana- clearly the foci of their respective scenes-partic- ipates in the ritual act; rather both, like Nabfi- apla-iddina, oversee it. In the Gudea seal, Nin- giizida plays the role of intercessor, holding, with Enki, an overflowing vase, while Gudea is led be- fore the seated deity. And Enheduana, motionless in a posture of pious supplication, observes as a priest pours a ritual libation.287 Furthermore, as noted above, the image makes plain the higher rank of the king vis-h-vis the Jangt priest in the larger stature it accords the former. On a subtler level, the immense size of the cult statue bespeaks the king's pre-eminent position in the history of the cult, for the scales of the sun disk and the statue reflect not only their relative positions within the cult, but the relative standings of the kings who effected each as well. The text, simi- 283. PBS 1/2, 112: 30; see Horowitz, Cosmic Geography, 338-39 for further references. 284. J. Nougayrol, "Les quatre vents7' RA 60 (1966) 73: 7', 10'. 285.

While Simbar-Sipak was certainly dutiful in his installation of the sun disk, he was never accorded the divine favor that was destined for Nabfi-apla-iddina, as SamaS rec- onciled with Akkad only during the latter's reign. It was suggested above that the account of the fortuituous discovery of a clay model, which en- abled the fashioning of a new cult statue, repre- sented a certain degree of embellishment. While the essential facts of the story may be true-that the design for the new statue was based on a clay model, such as an OB plaque in the temple's trea- sury-the discovery itself is probably the product of poetic license, a literary device. This embellish- ment of historical facts, or stylization of the truth, finds its counterpart in the relief. Certainly, the</page><page sequence="60">82 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS sun disk and the cult statue represent real objects, but the archaic iconography and style employed to depict them, and the immense sizes accorded them are, similarly, visual devices. Both literally and visually, the facts are no more important than the way in which they are conveyed. Indeed, these devices are exploited to the same end. The archa- izing of the image serves to legitimate the cult by establishing its great antiquity, while the histori- cal narrative of the inscription cites the ancient precedent for the cult's claim to certain revenues and privileges. And the bifurcated history of the cult as it pertains to these rights is duly reflected in both the image and the text. M. Powell has characterized the SGT as "an ex- cellent model for clever beggary,' by which he means, if I understand him correctly, that the priests of the Ebabbar conjured up these ingenious devices in an attempt to court royal patronage.288 While this is, no doubt, true, it is a one-sided portrayal, for there existed a mutual symbiosis by which Nabfi-apla-iddina, in resurrecting and richly endowing the Ebabbar, fulfilled his divinely dic- tated commission "to safeguard the cultic offices and rituals, establish regular offerings, (and) make bountiful the provisions" (iii 3-6). In so patroniz- ing this ancient institution, he legitimated his own kingship, assuming the role of the prototypi- cal king and thereby enlisting himself among the great rulers of Mesopotamia. Politically, Nabfi-apla-iddina stood on roughly equal footing with AMlurnasirpal II, preserving the traditional boundary with Assyria that was established during the Second Dynasty of Isin.289 To this must be added the account of the SGT, that he expelled the Sutians, the aggressive semi- nomadic peoples who had ravaged the land for at least two hundred years. These successes formed the foundation upon which a cultural and reli- gious renaissance could flourish. Under his guid- ance Babylonia was able to enjoy a golden age unknown since the days of Nebuchadnezzar I. Editions of the Utukki lemnrti incantation series and, very possibly, the Erra Epic were composed during his reign, while the legal medium of the kudurru was revived after a century-long hiatus.290 The king's patronage of temples extended to Uruk where he established regular meat-offerings for Eanna.291 However, his ability to restore the cult of Sama--to succeed where his predecessors had failed-could very well have represented the crowning achievement of a reign that lasted no less than thirty-three years. The Neo-Babylonian kings have often been heralded as the great antiquarians of Mesopota- mian history. They rebuilt the temples of Babylo- nia with a rigor that bordered upon fanaticism and took immense pride in searching out the foundation deposits of kings of the distant past. Nebuchadnezzar II and Nabonidus, in particular, are known to have based their royal inscriptions upon those of the Old Akkadian and Old Babylo- nian periods. And it is well known that Nabonidus, among other Neo-Babylonian kings, conducted sys- tematic archeological excavations, displaying the finds in what could be referred to as a museum.292 Indeed, antiquarian interests were so pervasive during this period that scholars have often con- sidered them its defining theme. Therefore, it is remarkable, in light of this shared passion for the past, that students of the Neo-Babylonian period have made scant mention of the Sun-god Tablet; for Nabfi-apla-iddina proved himself to be among the greatest of Mesopotamian antiquarians two hundred years before Nabopolassar usurped the throne. It is perhaps time that we speak less of the Sun-god Tablet as an independent curiosity and more as part of the cultural continuum. 288. Powell, ZA 81 (1991) 30. 289. Brinkman PKB, 181-92. 290.

General Commentary As one of the literary highlights of the sparsely attested Post-Kassite period, this text is essential for understanding the literary diction and gram- mar of the time, all the more so given that the text is complete, of considerable length, and con- tains a large number of syllabic spellings. How- ever, BBSt., no. 36 warrants closer study not only for the light it sheds on the literary language of the dark age between the time of Nebuchadnez- zar I and the Chaldean kings, but also because a shadow of doubt continues to hang over the authenticity of the text.293 The following analysis strongly suggests that BBSt., no. 36 is indeed an authentic product of the ninth century B.C.E.; so true is the orthography and grammar to the stan- dards of the MB kudurru corpus, that the text appears to be well beyond the skills of the much later Chaldean forgers who produced such flawed works as the Cruciform monument.294 It is clear that Nabfi-apla-iddina not only resurrected the kudurru as a means of commemorating land grants, privileges, and incomes, but also revital- ized the archaizing Middle Babylonian dialect in which such entitlements were traditionally ex- pressed;29g5 for despite its firm, albeit early, Neo- Babylonian date (ca. 856; year 31), the language of the text is nearly identical to that of the MB kudurrus of several hundred years earlier.296 In accord with the poetic style of the narrative and imprecations, in some instances the text displays characteristics of SB as well as other purposeful OB archaisms. 293. See above, The Inscription; cf. Gelb, JNES 8 (1949) 348 n. 12. 294. See above, The Inscription; Powell, ZA 81 (1991) 21. 295. Note J. Aro's comments in StOr 20, 15: "Auch wtirde man von vornherein damit rechnen, dass ein literarischer Text nicht in reinem Dialekt, sondern in einer Sprache, die ailtere Vorbilder nachahmt, geschrieben ist-ist das doch schon oft bei den Kudurrus der Fall." 296. Concerning other late kudurrus, Aro comments: "Die Grenze bei Kudurrus ist (vielleicht willktirlich) um 1000 v.Chr. gezogen worden, obgleich schon frtiher (besonders um Nabfi- kudurri-usurs I Zeit) Merkmale vorzukommen beginnen, die fiir das Neubabylonische charakteristisch sind, und umgekehrt auch in spiteren Kudurrus die alte Sprache ziemlich gut nach- geahmt wird" (StOr 20, 18).</page><page sequence="68">90 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS Consistent with the syllabaries of MB and later, a relatively high percentage of CVC signs is em- ployed, accounting for 21% of all syllabic signs. However, CVm signs are generally not used in this text to express historical spellings with mi- mation, e.g., -tu4 (TUM), -rit (RUM), -ti (TIM), -lu4 (LUM), etc. Although such writings were fre- quently employed in MB letters and documents, their use in the contemporaneous kudurru corpus was traditionally less pronounced.297 In BBSt., no. 36, CVm spellings with mimation account for only 5% of CVC signs and 1% of all syllabic val- ues.298 The few historical spellings of this type that do occur are those that are fairly frequent in MB kudurrus, i.e., to express the third-person/ demonstrative pronoun,299 gu-a-tu4 (i 26, iii 30, iv 5, 8, 12, vi 45; with SU: vi 17, 43), and, in certain cases, divine names,300 dA-ni7 (ii 21). Beyond these attestations, there are only two other occurrences of spellings of this type: ez-zi-ti (ii 25) and HJUL- ti (vi 42). Despite the high frequency of CVC signs in BBSt., no. 36, writings of the type CVC1-C1V for cvclv (i.e., with false consonantal doubling) are not attested. Likewise writings of the type V-CV for -vc (i.e., with otiose final vowel), and -VC for -cv (i.e., omission of final vowel with -VC), both of which are common even in early NB,301 do not occur. The only possible orthographic aberration revealing of its NB date is the occurrence of a -CV1C sign for -evlcv2, i.e., omission of final vowel with -CVC: t"gqarbitu is consistently spelled t3gqar- bit (v 43, 49, 55; vi 1, 4).302 However, this proba- bly represents a playful writing, t'oqar-E for qar- bitu given the otherwise meticulous indication of final vowels in this text. As is common in MB, double consonants are consistently indicated in the script and contracted final vowels are written with an extra vowel sign. Among morphologically long vowels, in accord with MB orthography, only the feminine plural is written plene, e.g., dal-ha- a-ti (i 5); fip-re-e-ti (vi 31).303 The common NB practice of indicating vowel length with an aleph is not attested. Other orthographic conventions of this text include SU as the 3rd pers. poss. suf. on verbs and SU as the corresponding suffix on nouns; DIS for ana, except before dUTU where it is spelled syllabically, a-na, (also, AS for ina, except i 11 and iv 35); U for the conjunction u. Contiguous vowels regularly contract in a man- ner consistent with MB and later dialects, with the notable exception of the archaizing form gunatu (i 26; iii 30; iv 5, 8, 12; vi 17, 43, 45); kudurrus tend to exhibit both the uncontracted form304 and, as noted above, the historical spelling with -tu4, as deliberate archaisms. nC1 is written as C1CI only for /n/ of the N-stem and verbs I-n, e.g., immafi- ma (i 9), ipparfid (i 11), ipparis-ma (i 27), iqqi- ma (iv 32), ippalissfi-ma (iv 46), izzazza (vi 26), izzazza-ma (vi 34); before possessive suffixes, the feminine marker, and the enclitic -ma, the assim- ilation is not expressed in the writing, e.g., #ikingu (i 10), uzunnu (iv 13), nidinti (vi 35), ukin-ma (i 20; ii 7). Three further morphographemic writings, in- volving stem-final dentals and the possessive suffix -gu, are likewise attested, e.g., ki-gad-su (iii 14), fu- bat-su (iv 28), fal-mat-su-ma (vi 54); cf. kabtassu (iv 11), ippalisso-ma (iv 46). Additionally, there are several other features reminiscent of OB phonology and lexicon that are typical of the very highest standards of the archaizing kudurru dia- lect: /I/ does not appear as /1/ before dentals as is elsewhere common in SB/MB, e.g., igtal-ma (i 14); 297. Aro, StOr 20, 24. 298. For the benefit of comparison, note that a sample of NB letters from the Kuyunjik collection exhibits a similar dis- tribution: CVC signs account for 11.3% of all syllabic values, but only 2.6% show mimation. In a sample of OB letters, how- ever, 85.3% of CVC signs show mimation (Woodington, "A Grammar of the Neo-Babylonian Letters7' 14). 299. "Besonders gern wird in fast allen Kudurrus gu-a-tu4 geschrieben. In den spaiteren Kudurrus fallen Schreibungen dieser Art allmahlig fort, nur gu-a-tu4 ist auffallend langlebig, so dass es noch BBST. 36 IV 8 vorkommt" (Aro, StOr 20, 24). 300. Aro, StOr, 24. 301.

Case endings on syllabically spelled nouns and adjectives display the following characteristics: a) With the exception of the enumeration of garments in v 42-vi 4, which is written in a rather telegraphic style and where the nominative case is used for the expected accusative, case endings are consistently assigned according to the MB paradigm to an accuracy of over 91%, i.e., -u (nom. sg.; e.g., limnu [i 6], zikru [ii 23]); -i (gen. sg.; e.g., til- pani [ii 25], puratti [iv 26]); -a (acc. sg.; e.g., nipha [i 18], igarta [iii 8]); -i (gen./acc. pl.; e.g., madazi [ii 30], baqri [vi 14]); -a (nom. pl. before poss. suff., e.g., parsagu [i 9], pana~u [iv 9]); -i (gen./acc. pl. before poss. suff., e.g., banzigu [iv 42], pant~u [i 15]). b) With the possible exception of the writing tugqar-E (v 43, 49, 55; vi 1, 4), discussed above, no case endings are omitted in the writing.306 The following case endings and forms do not conform to MB standards: nom. sg.: guatu (i 26; vi 45)-frozen uncontracted OB gen./acc. used for nom. as well. gen. sg.: lemnu (ii 26)--"KUR lem-nu possibly attracted to the nom. because of indeclinable'i'Su- tu-4 in (ii 27).307 acc. sg.: salmu (iv 8)-expected for ace. sg. in SB/NB;308 labtri (iv 48). gen. pl.: luKU4-E-4-tu (v 20)-frozen form, pre- bends are often indeclinable in NB;309 cf. the gram- matically ambiguous l'GiR.LA-'di-tu (v 25). The locative-adverbial ending -um is used twice for poetic emphasis, i.e., qatuflu (iii 10); panuffu (iv 7). The fifty free bound forms, i.e., those syllabi- cally expressed, are uniformly correct according to the standards of OB/MB, with the possible ex- ception of ahu (v 7; v 35). The twenty-three bound forms before suffixes, likewise, agree with their OB/MB counterparts, although there is one in- stance, at the end of the text, of a polysyllabic feminine noun assuming a bound form that is typi- cal of OB literary diction and SB, i.e., galmassa- ma ([vi 54] for prose galamtagia-ma). In tandem with this spelling, we also encounter one of the two apocopated suffixes attested in this text, i.e., napiltui (vi 53), which is also diagnostic of these dialects (the other attestation is hitaigun [ii 28]). The choice of these two spellings at the end of the inscription and the use of the more literary ga- lamtu rather than pagru,310 coupled, as well, with the inclusion of two pivot constructions in vi 50- 51 and vi 53-54 (see below), collectively provide the conclusion of the text with a fitting poetic flourish. The verb forms are identical to those of the OB/MB paradigms. As is standard in MB kudur- rus, the preterite, rather than the perfect, is used as the main tense for expressing the past.311 There are only two instances of the perfect, i.e., irtzig (iv 9), ttelis (iv 10) (in tandem), serving, as in OB, to emphasize a critical event in the narrative. The syntax is marked by the frequent use of the pivot construction, subj./obj.-verb(-ma)-verb-subj./obj. for poetic effect, i.e., i 6-8, 10-12, 26-28; iii 11-14, 17-18; iv 5-7, 9-11, 27-28, 38-39; vi 50-51, 53-54.

Of the four kudurrus with captions, three are datable to his reign (BBSt., nos. 28, 29, and, of course, our text 36); the only other kudurru with captions belongs to the reign of Nabfi-mukin-apli, BBSt., no. 9. See the discus- sion in Slanski, The Babylonian Entitlement narfis, 133-34. Caption II: For timmu 'pole, post, pillar, col- umn,' see AHw. 1360a. The lack of the expected conjunction, u, finds parallels among phrases of the type birtt GN GN2 (GN3); birit TN TN2; and biriti PN PN2 (CAD B sub birit). For the inter- pretation of Captions II and III offered here, see A. Poebel, AJSL 52 (1936) 111-14 (also Jacobsen, in Ancient Israelite Religion, 31 nn. 21-24). Slan- ski mistakingly reads dINNIN for d15 in the first line of the caption (The Babylonian Entitlement narfis, 198). Caption III: NIMGIR dUTU MUS.IGI.MIN pos- sibly conceals a secondary reading of AGA dUTU sir/shr-ini MIN "crown/disk of SamaS, s/zarinnu of SamaS" (or AGA dUTU sir/sizr-ini4 "crown/disk of SamaS, s/zarinnu"), with both an assonantal, or paronomastic, play on zarinnu (or sarinnu) plau- sibly 'a decorated stand or support for precious objects,' (CAD Z sub zarinnu B; cf. Schaudig, AOAT 256, 381-82 n. 459) and a play on the the dual meanings of aga 'crown' and secondarily '(light emitting) disk, corona' (CAD A/1 sub ag&amp;i mng. 2; see also E. Weidner, "Beitraige zur baby- lonischen Astronomie' BA 8 [1911], 23-52; PSD A/3 sub aga A Bil. 4 and 5), the latter meaning with reference to the niphu 'sun disk' of the inscription and relief. Such secondary readings would, likewise, allow two interpretations of Caption III, "The herald of SamaS, the two-faced snake,' and "The herald of SamaS, the zarinnu- stand;' providing a play on the two "supports" of the god's emblem as depicted in the relief-the two-faced snake provides support from above, the zarinnu-stand, if this identification is indeed correct, from below. In this connection note that P Michalowski proposes a word play that in- volves the Nabonidus cylinder, YOS 1, 45, which is similarly concerned with serpents and serpent- like creatures, i.e., bagamu and serugfu, and the well-known Nebuchadnezzar I kudurru, BBSt., no. 6, which is crowned with a snake, probably symbolic of Nirab ("The Doors of the Past,' Eretz- Israel 27 [2003] 136"-52"). In one Nabonidus inscription, a zarinnu stand is closely associated with the tiara of SamaS (VAB 4, Nbn. 7). i 1-8: The antecedent of fa in line 4 may refer to either SamaS or the Ebabbar and is therefore ambiguous-perhaps purposefully so, embracing a double entendre. The Ebabbar is taken as the (primary) referent given the close association of usurtu 'drawing, plan, design' with buildings. The inscription thereby moves from the more general to the more specific, from the chaos in Akkad, to the destruction of the Ebabbar, and, finally, to the disruption of the cult and the loss of the cult sta- tue. The NP of 1-8 is topicalized (note GAL-P in 1), with SamaS resumed by the expected pronom- inal suffix in i 7 and i 8; cf. the topicalized phrase of ii 18-iii 6, which is resumed in iii 10. For the relatively high frequency of anacoluthon in MB, see GAG ?183c. i 9: The enclitic particle -ma is used in MB (i.e., the MB kudurru dialect employed in this text) with much of the same functional range as in OB, i.e., for expressing conjuction with logical subor- dination (Aro, StOr 20, 136-45). i 10: gikingiu u simatalu construed as a collec- tive, given that the verbs in i 11, 12 are in the sin- gular; gimatu is coupled with ?iknu also in iii 21, and with salmu in i 16. For a similar use of the term giknu with cult statues, note: ilani u igta- rati... ia... tkilu gikinfun "the (statues of) gods and goddesses... whose.., features had become dulled" (Borger, Esarh., 23 Ep. 32: 9-12); cf. aggum igtu umt ruquti paras enti malG-ma la uddi fikingu "because since ancient days the office of the high priestess had been forgotten and her characteristics were not described anywhere" (YOS 1, 45 i 26-27 [Nbn.]). i 13: LUGAL.E is probably for simple farru during this period (vs. LUGAL Eki = gar Babili), see Borger, Zeichenliste, no. 308; Brinkman PKB, 167-68; Brinkman MSKH, 405. i 15: A play on the common idiom pant na- danu meaning 'to pay attention' (see CAD N/1 sub nadanu mng. 2 panu b) and its literal meaning in</page><page sequence="71">THE SUN-GOD TABLET OF NABU-APLA-IDDINA REVISITED 93 this context, "he (SamaS) did not give his face;' i.e., "SamaS did not reveal his face'," as there is a continual theme throughout this section of the nar- rative of appearance vs. disappearance, visibility vs. invisibility (see Final Remarks above; also Jacobsen, in Ancient Israelite Religion, 31 n. 18; Slanski, JCS 52 (2000) 109; Slanski, The Babylo- nian Entitlement narfis, 217). i 18: For the correct identification of niphu as the sun disk of the relief, see Brinkman, RA 70 (1976) 183-84. On the kudurru of Nazi-Marutta (MDP 2, 90 iv 12), niphu also refers to the sun disk depicted on the relief. For other instances in which the text of the kudurru makes explicit reference to images on the relief, note MDP 2, 89 iii 16f. (Nazi- MaruttaS); MDP 2, 110 vii 26f. (Meli-Sipak); BBSt., no. 5 iii 25-33 (Marduk-apla-iddina); ZA 65 (1975) 58 ii 76-79 (Marduk-Sapik-zeri); VAS 1, 36 vi 2-3 (Nabfi-uma-ilkun); see the discussion in Slanski, The Babylonian Entitlement naris, 127-43. i 19: See Relief, b. Sun Disk for discussion. The verb uiatrisamma probably refers to Simbar- Sipak's installation of the sun disk within SamaS's shrine for lack of a proper cult statue, i.e., nipha ga pan Samai ugatrisamma "he enshrined the sun disk which is (now) before SamaS" (i 18-19), and not to the arrangment depicted on the SGT. This interpretation of the passage assumes the S stem causative of tarasu with the meaning 'to extend a roof, shade, or protective awning', e.g., eli DN... sulalgu atrus-ma ukin tarangu "I stretched its roof (of the paramahu over Marduk) and set its awn- ing in place" (Streck Asb., 148 i 31; also Bauer Asb. 1, pl. 57 81-2-4, 212: 6; Thompson Esarh., pl. 14 i 37 [Asb.]; see CAD T sub tarasu A mng. 2d [forthcoming]; AHw. sub tarasu(m) G 4, S 10). Alternatively, it is also possible to understand the verb in this context as the S stem causative of its related G meaning 'to place, set up, install' or, in its intransitive sense, 'to stand (before)'. For tarasu with the meaning 'to set up, see B. Pongratz-Leisten, Ina gumi irub: Die kulttopo- graphische und ideologische Programmatik der akitu-Prozession in Babylonien und Assyrien im I. Jahrtausend v. Chr, Baghdader Forschungen 16 (Mainz am Rhein: Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 1994) 167-69. With this meaning tarasu corre- sponds to kunnu or gurgudu (note the correspon- dence ta-[ra-su] = gu-gu-rit 'to put, to bring in order' [S of eieru], semantically similiar to the D stem of kdnu [Leichty Izbu, 220: 308]). In late second-millennium Canaanite dialects, tarasu appears to have replaced older kunnu or fur- Judu; see C. Zaccagnini, "Notes on the Pazarcik Stele,' SAA Bulletin 7 [1993] 62-63; J. Greenfield and A. Shaffer, "Notes on the Akkadian-Aramaic Bilingual Statue from Tell Fekherye,' Iraq 45 [1983] 115). Further, our passage shares a com- mon idiom with a number of attestations in em- ploying the prepositional phrase (ana) pan(i) (for the NB/LB use of pan(i) for ana pan, as in our text, see GAG ?1151). A great deal of the evidence for this sense of tarasu(m) is of first-millennium date and is found in ritual contexts, often con- cerned, as in our text, with the placement of cultic objects. As noted already by F. Thureau-Dangin, "Tarasu [sic], avec le sens de 'diriger (sous-entendu: sa face)' vers tel objet 'se placer dans telle direc- tion, est fr6quent dans nos textes..":' (RAcc., 94 n. 7). For evidence of tarasu with this meaning, see CAD T sub tarasu A mngs. 5a, c, 12c, 14 [forth- coming]; AHw. sub tarasu(m) mngs. G 6c, S 8, 9. Obviously, understanding the verb with this mean- ing, i.e., "he installed the sun disk" need not be at odds with the argument put forth above that the passage refers to Simbar-Sipak's earlier installa- tion of the sun disk within SamaS's shrine. i 21: For the correct reading of the PN mE-kur- MU-TUK-gi as Ekur-guma-ufargi, see comm. to vi 20. i 28: BA1 miscopied as 'SU1 in 5R, pls. 60-61. ii 4: Note also RA 16 (1919) 128 ii 10 (kudurru of Marduk-zakir-Sumi), where the kalf's prebend (i.e., kalitu), likewise, consists of an income of 1 liter of various breads and 1 liter of first-draft beer. ii 12: According to Tintir V 95-96, the New- town district was located in the north-east corner of Babylon, adjacent to the Kullab district and in the area between the IEtar Gate and the Marduk Gate (George Topographical Texts, 26). ii 18f.: Topicalization of the NP (ending in iii 6) by preposing, with the phrase in the nominative case, e.g., zikru qardu ii 23; the NP is resumed in iii 10 (see also comm. to i 1-3).</page><page sequence="72">94 CHRISTOPHER E.

As pointed out by Walker and Dick, Barrelet is probably cor- rect in interpreting the object allegedly found on the west bank of the Euphrates as an impression or mold, based not only the abundance of such objects from Mesopotamia (see Barrelet, Figurines et reliefs), but also in light of the clay molds (BM 91001 and 91002) in the SGT assemblage, which were possibly executed on analogy with this "dis- covery:" However, if this interpretation is correct, then the meaning 'impression, mold' ascribed to sirpu derives from the context alone, and is not, as suggested by Barrelet, inherent to the seman- tics of this lexeme. Barrelet understands sirpu as stemming from a verb sarapu 'to press,' follow- ing Lambert and others (Lambert BWL, 287 ad 108, 110), who argue for this meaning based on a presumed correspondence with the Arabic sarapa. However, as pointed out in CAD S sub sarapu A, all the evidence for a putative sarapu 'to press' can actually be shown to belong to sarapu 'to burn, based on Sumerian correspondences and bilingual passages. Barrelet's argument that sirpu cannot indicate 'kiln-fired' because that notion is already implicit to the meaning of hasbu is not entirely convincing (Barrelet, Figurines et reliefs, 29, 39), as sirpu may designate a specific firing process and hasbu, a more generic term for terracotta. More- over, sirpu is used regularly with reference to tab- lets used as master texts from which copies were made; such tablets are likely to have been baked. In these cases sirpu is often modified by the ad- jective samu 'red,' again suggesting a firing pro- cess (see CAD S sub sarapu A). iv 9-10: The only occurrences of the perfect in this text, used here with the same functional range as in OB, emphasizing the central event of this section of the narrative. iv 12-17: This section of the inscription is to be compared to the Erra Epic I 150f. which is simi- larly concerned with the construction of divine statues. It is assumed that the agent of iv 12-34 is NabO-nadin-Sumi rather than Nabf-apla-iddina (see Seidl, ZA 91 [2001] 123 n. 13). This portion of the inscription has been recently treated by Walker and Dick, as it pertains to the fashioning of cult statues and the role of the mtg pi ritual therein (mid pi, 58-63). For the characteristics and epithets of the artisan deities Ninildu, Kug- sigbanda, Ninkura, and Ninzadim, see the ample evidence collected in Walker and Dick, mtM pi, 62-63 nn. 14-17. iv 25: E-kar-za-gin-na 'House of the Quay of Lapis Lazuli' or more probably 'House of the Quay of Splendor' (for the latter translation, see E. Cassin, La splendeur divine: Introduction i l'tude de la mentalitd misopotamienne [Paris: Mouton &amp; Co., 1968], 114-16); in various lexical series and bilinguals, za-gin (and related lexemes) is equated with ebbu, ellu, and namru (see the respective CADlexical sections and bilingual evi- dence in CAD Z, sub zaqnu, ziqnu, e.g., su6.mu za.gin.na : ja ziqna elletu zaqnu [BA 5 (1906) 684: no. 37: 14f.]). Ekarzagina was the temple of Ea lo- cated in the Eridu district of Babylon, within the Esagil precinct on the left bank of the Euphra- tes (between Esagil proper and the river bank) (George Topographical Texts, 300-303); note: IE.KAR.ZA.GIN.NA [btt] d[Ea] fa qereb Esagil "Ekarzagina temple of Ea in Esagil" (Streck Asb.,</page><page sequence="73">THE SUN-GOD TABLET OF NABU-APLA-IDDINA REVISITED 95 246: 65-66); see also W L. Moran, "A New Frag- ment of DIN.TIR.KI = Babilu and Enama Elii vi 61-66;' in Studia Biblica et Orientalia III: Oriens Antiquus, Analecta Biblica 12 (Rome: Pontificio Istituto Biblico, 1959), 259 n. 7. In Tintir IV 3, Ekarzagina is called "gate of the Apst" (bab apsi) (George Topographical Texts, 59: 3). Ekarzagina is the location of the mhf pi and pit pi ceremo- nies, and hence, the place where divine statues were fashioned, concecrated, and brought to life; the connection with Ea is clear in light of this god's role in creation and magic (George Topographi- cal Texts, 302). Our text is the earliest known his- torical inscription to mention Ekarzagina as the place of the mif pi ceremony; the temple is later mentioned by Esarhaddon (Borger Esarh., 89: 21-24; cf. 91 ?60: O10f.) and Nabonidus (MVAG 1 [1986] 78 viii 16f.). For further references and the role of the Ekarzagina in the mtf p?i ritual see Walker and Dick, mG pi, 6.3 n. 18; George Topo- graphical Texts, 300-303. iv 33: For the understanding of dilpu with the possible meaning 'syrup,' rather than 'honey' in ritual contexts, see S. Maul, Zukunftsbewdltigung: Eine Untersuchung altorientalischen Denkens anhand der babylonisch-assyrischen Liserituale (Namburbi), Baghdader Forschungen 18 (Mainz am Rhein: Verlag Philipp von Zabern), 51 n. 54. Maul is followed by C. Walker and M. Dick, The Induction of the Cultic Image in Ancient Meso- potamia: The Mesopotamian Mis Pi Ritual, SAA Literary Texts 1 (Helsinki: Neo-Assyrian Text Cor- pus Project), 14 and n. 35. iv 46f.: The enclitic -ma connects ippalissu to the next main-clause verb in vi 13; all the items between these verbs serve as the direct object of rdmu in vi 13-presummably, the Sangai priest, as the chief administrator of the temple, is en- trusted with the various commodities and incomes for distribution, i.e., garments and incomes for Sa- maS, Aya, and Bunene (cf. ii 11-17 where the iangi priest is entrusted with the garden plot for SamaS), as well as with his own incomes that de- rive from the king's share and the crib bitatu- and tabihatu-prebends, among other sources. The suc- cinct style of the decree is the cause of some con- fusion. Clearly, the langa priest receives the 1 liter of various breads and the 1 liter of first-draft beer as a symbolic gesture-the very same income granted to his forefather who likewise held this office (see above, The Inscription). The main diffi- culty is with the relationship between the crib bztatu- and tabihttu-prebends, on the one hand, and the langii priest's share, on the other (note the absence of an expected ina at the beginning of v 25)-is Nabfi-apla-iddina here establishing in- comes for the crib bHtitu- and tabihatu-prebends, or simply decreeing that the Sangti priest's share is to be derived, in part, from these prebends? In agreement with Hurowitz (in Context of Scripture, vol. 2, 364-68), the latter, more straightforward, scenario is assumed here. That this portion of the inscription would deal exclusively with Nabfi- nadin-Sumi's reward is in accord with the empha- sis placed on the role of the fangf priest elsewhere in the inscription. v 7: Slanski translates ahu 'payout' with the comment, "ahu is the bound form of ahG usually meaning 'wages'" (The Babylonian Entitlement naris, 206 and 210 ad v 7); King translates, "the share pertaining to the king" (BBSt., 124). How- ever, we clearly have in this instance an attesta- tion of the phrase ahi zitti 'half share, which is quite frequent in NB legal and economic phrase- ology (See CAD A/1 sub ahu B mngs. 5 a, b ; and CAD Z sub zittu mngs. la-10', 1c-5', 2e). In a late copy of the contemporaneous Eanna meat distri- bution text, OECT 1, pls. 20-21 (McEwan, Iraq 45 [1983] 187-98), the king's daily share (PAD.HIJI.A LUGAL) reveals several close parallels to our text, consisting of: a shoulder (uzuimittu[ZAG.UDU]), the rump (UZ""Urapaitu[GIS.KUN]), ribs (uzuselu[TI]) (2, 51); a thigh ("zupemu[UR]), the back (uzoarka- tu[EGIR]) (6, 30, 55; cf. BBSt., no. 36 v 10-11); one half of the hide (ku'lihtu) (17 40, 66; cf. BBSt., no. 36 v 10); one half of the rumen (uzukariu), the intestines (UzUqerbu[SAG4]), the coils of the colon (tUranu[SAG4.NIGIN]), the "blood intestines" (""uuirru dami[SAG4.MUD]), and the lungs (uzuha- Ja[HJAR]) (19, 42, 68; cf. BBSt., no. 36 v 12-13). Presumably, the cuts of meat in our text repre- sent daily distributions as they do in OECT 1, pls. 20-21. Note that there, as in our text, half of the king's share is occasionaly given as a gift to a</page><page sequence="74">96 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS member of the temple personnel (i.e., to an afipu [6, 17];in three cases Nabfi-apla-iddina takes half a cut of meat, while the crib bttis take the other half [19, 42, 68]). Remarkably, in OECT 1, pls. 20- 21, which apparently lists all of the Eanna temple personnel, the office of the sangi is not cited (aside from E.MAS l~'GIGIR [10, 34], E.MAS ia dUSUr- amassu [59], and E.MAS dAnunltu [60]); rather, the head of the temple administration is known by the title leigallu. v 10: A rare instance of maiku(KUS) with the UZU determinative; when considered as a cut of meat, the hide or skin is usually referred to as ihtu (for fijtu among the cuts of meat distributed in Eanna during the reign of Nabfi-apla-iddina, see McEwan, Iraq 45 [1983] 187-98). ""UR, as a cut of meat, is probably to be read pemu rather than sanu, see R. Labat, Review of W. von Soden, AHw. (fascicle 9 [1969]), BiOr 30 (1973) 58. v 11: U"ZUarkatu(EGIR) 'back,' ""uzueranu(SA.MES) 'sinews, tendons'; the former is included in the Eanna meat distribution text. McEwan (Iraq 45 [1983] 196) suggests that UZ""arkatu(EGIR) 'back' may be synonymous with gaiallu 'back(?)' (see CAD S/2 sub gagallu mng. 2). v 12: "zukariu 'rumen, stomach' is also included in the Eanna meat distribution text (McEwan, Iraq 45 [1983] 187-98). v 13: UzUqerbu 'intestines, a fairly rare cut of meat, is also listed in the Eanna meat distribu- tion text (McEwan, Iraq 45 [1983] 187-98; note also Dream-book, 323 K. 2018A: x+ 1 if.). v 14: For kursinnu 'fetlock' as a cut of meat, see CAD K sub kursinnu mng. b-4'; AHw. sub kursinnu(m) mng. 2b; fetlocks are frequently in- cluded in prebends (McEwan, Iraq 45 [1983] 198 n. 48 with references). v 15: dugJiTUL A.MES UZU for diqar md SAri. For md iAri 'meat broth' see CAD M/2 sub mai A mng. 2a-2'b'; CAD S/3 sub firu A mng. 3-2'c. v 16: ME is inscribed for MES here and in v 27 presumably owing to a lack of space. v 18: While the phrase ki pi anni(m-ma) most often occurs with a following enumeration, accord- ing to the evidence quoted in AHw. sub pi I mng. 1 lc, and CAD P sub pi A mng. 8c-1' (forthcom- ing), the internal structure of the list suggests, as also argued by Hurowitz (in Context of Scripture, vol. 2, 367 n. 49), that the phrase here refers to what is decreed in the preceding clause. v 19-20: gip'SUB.BA.MES = isqatu/isqetu, trans- lated here as "prebendary shares" i.e., the income of various foodstuffs in return for the performance of services connected with the Ebabbar. For an overview of the NB prebendaries of Ebabbar, see Bongenaar, Ebabbar Temple, particularly 140-295. The erib-biti 'temple enterer' prebend was, in the NB period proper, the most prominent among the Ebabbar prebends; furthermore, ownership of an crib bHti prebend was a prerequisite to holding the office of iangiG (for an overview of the role and function of the crib biti in the Ebabbar, see Bongenaar, Ebabbar Temple, 157-59 with refer- ences). Note that the first mention in our text of the three offices reflects their descending hier- archical ordering within the temple, specifically, sangi (v 8), crib biti (v 20), and tabihjtu (v 25). See also the kudurru of Nabfi-apla-iddina's son and successor, Marduk-zakir-Eumi, where three crib- bitis of Eanna receive identical commodities, with the exception of the various cuts of meat, i.e., NINDA.HI.A KAS.SAG NINDA.I.DE.A KU6.HI.A "SAR.MES khi KA 8 1"KU4-E "various breads, first- draft beer, mirsu-confection, various fish, (and) gar- den produce according to (those shares) of three erib bttis" (RA 16 [1919] 125 i 25-27). v 25-27: Slanski understands IuGIR.LA-i-tu as nag patratu with the comment, "[it] should be something like an abstract noun from 'butcher', apparently referring to the various cuts of meat detailed above in v 10-15" (The Babylonian Entitlement narfis, 210 ad v 25). Note also the CAD's understanding of this passage, tabihijtu u undit libbi GIM p1 2 LU.TU.E.ME "cooked and served in (appropriate) containers corresponding to (the needs of) two erib biti's" (CAD E sub erib biti mng. c). It is clear, however, that l"GIR.LA-i-tu is a reference to the butcher's prebend, i.e., tabi- hfiatu, attested in the NB Ebabbar archive, as well as the Eanna archive from Uruk, particularly dur- ing the Hellenistic period (Bongenaar, Ebabbar Temple, 294-95; G. J. P McEwan, Priest and</page><page sequence="75">THE SUN-GOD TABLET OF NABU-APLA-IDDINA REVISITED 97 Temple in Hellenistic Babylonia, FAOS 4 [Wies- baden: Franz Steiner, 1981], 100-101). For tabi- hatu and crib bitatu in the same context, see BRM 2, 19: 55; 29: 2; TCL 13, 242: 3; Peiser Vertrage, 113: 1, 119: 3. The close relationship between the temple-enterer's and butcher's pre- bends continued through the Hellenistic period, see McEwan, Priest and Temple, 76, 100. For the profession,' GIR.LA (tabihu), see J. A. Brinkman, "Ur: 721-605 B.C.,' OrNS 34 (1965) 249; Postgate Palace Archive, 91; Lambert BWL, 160: 9. For GIM pi-i 2 hIKU4-E.ME!(LA) (v 27), note the similar phraseology (and identical commodities) in the kudurru of Marduk-zaikir-Sumi (RA 16 [1919] 125 i 27). v 26: For undt libbi 'internal organs,' see AHw. sub unftu mng. 10. In the NA ritual text ND 1120, the internal organs, unat libbi, are assigned to the cook (G. van Driel, The Cult of Afur [Assen: van Gorcum, 1969], 202:14'); in Summa Izbu commen- tary Y, unft(u) libbi is equated with the liver, ga- bidu : unatu libbi (Leichty Izbu, 232: 230b). Cf. [BE izbu] undt SAG4-gi NU GAL.MES UN NUN [...] "If an anomaly's 'belly' has no contents-the people of the prince [...]" (Leichty, Izbu, 167: 15'); DIS unat SAG4 (in broken context, Dream-book, 318: y + 17f.);... 1 kursinni u unat libbtgu"... one fetlock and the internal organs" (MDP 57, 246: 13'-14'). v 38: See comm. to v 25-27. v 42: The first sign, GADA, may be a scribal mistake. Possibly the engraver etched the GADA sign before realizing that the required determi- native was TUG; otherwise the line may be inter- preted as "linen for a 'fearsome' (pulhu-)garment'" Given that this is the only attestation of a tigpulhu, to my knowledge, this issue cannot be settled conclusively. v 43: A qarbitu-garment is otherwise unknown among the NB lubustu-offerings; moreover, this text may represent the only known attestation of this particular item of clothing (note also v 55; vi 1, 4; and tugqarbjtu rabitu [v 49]); see AHw. and CAD Q sub qarbttu. The writing of this garment is probably a play on the logographic value of E, i.e., bttu; otherwise, taken as a syllabogram, bit, it represents the only omission of a final vowel in this text. For the writing of CVC-CVC for cvccvcv, i.e., omission of final vowel after CVC signs, in the Bel-ibni correspondence (early NB), see de Vaan, "Ich bin eine Schwertklinge des Kinigs," 105; note also, Hyatt, Final Vowels, 10-12. v 44: A seri'tu-garment (also fer-itu, see AHw. sub feri-tu), is likewise unknown among the regu- lar garments offered in the NB lubustu-ceremony. However, in the so-called Marduk Ordeal text a feri tu-garment is worn by Marduk (ZA 51 [1955] 136: 32; JAOS 103 [1983] 133: 32). v 45-46: The hullanu-wrap and nebehu-sash are standard among the garments offered during the NB lubustu-ceremonies; see Giovinazzo, An- nali di Napoli 41 (1981) 527-59; Matsushima in Official Cult and Popular Religon, 209-19; Mat- sushima, ASJ 16 (1994) 177-200; Matsushima, ASJ 17 (1995) 233-49; E.

See also the text edition of BM 91002 below. v 47-48: tabarru 'red wool,' takiltu 'blue-purple wool'; the latter is often written with the logogram for lapis lazuli, i.e., (sig)ZA.(GIN.)KUR.RA, and thus was probably manufactured with the blue dye uqndtu (A. L. Oppenheim, "Essay on Overland Trade in the First Millennium B.C.,' JCS 21 [1967] 244 n. 41; W H. van Soldt, "Fabrics and Dyes at Ugarit,' UF 22 [1990] 339-40; Bongenaar, Ebabbar Temple, 309; note, however, the dissenting opinion of B. Landsberger, "Uber Farben im Sumerisch- Akkadischen' JCS 21 [1967] 163 concerning the semantic relationship between the logogram and the color). tabarru is synomous with nabasu 'red- dyed wool' as both may be written with the logo- gram sglIE.ME.DA; note: [sirie.me.d]a = na-ba-su, ta-LU-ri (error for tabarri, followed by uqndtu and takiltu) (Hh. XIX 78-78a); [sighd.me.da] = na-ba-su = dar-[x], ta-bar-[ru] (Hg. C II 3f.). Both tabarru- and takiltu-wool were regularly offered during the NB lubuitu-ceremonies (for further references, see those cited in comm. to v 45-46). For the dyes used in preparing the garments of the gods of the</page><page sequence="76">98 CHRISTOPHER E. WOODS Ebabbar during the NB period, see Bongenaar, Ebabbar Temple, 309. For the haplographic writ- ing ZA.KUR.RA for takiltu, see comm. to BM 91002: 9 below. vi 11-13: rdmu governs a double accusative as shown by the absence of ana in vi 11 (ARAD-su for arassu [acc.]). This is standard usage for the verb rdmu in kudurrus; see BBSt., no. 1 i 8 (Kadai- man-Enlil); BBSt., no. 28 rev. 17 (Nabfi-apla-iddina); Sumer 23 (1967) 52: 13 (Merodach-baladan I); RA 16 (1919) 128 ii 15 (Marduk-zakir-Sumi). vi 14: For the idiom ana baqri la rad, see AHw. sub baqra mng. 2; also BBSt., no. 9 ii 34. vi 17: The demonstrative, guatu, here precludes an anaphoric usage given that a tuppu is not pre- viously mentioned or alluded to in the text. Rather, we encounter a recognitional usage that is typo- logically common with far deictics. Recognitional demonstratives mark information that is newly in- troduced to the discourse, but which is well-known to both the speaker and addressee from other con- texts, i.e., "discourse new and hearer old," to use H. Diessel's felicitous phrase (Demonstratives: Form, Function, and Grammaticalization, Typo- logical Studies in Language 42 [Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 1999], 105-9). As a recognitional de- monstrative, guatu refers, presumably, to the origi- nal clay tablet upon which the official seal was placed (see comm. to vi 30). vi 19: The profession is to be read IUKIR4.DAB, and not 1"ka-lu as given by King (BBSt., 126; fol- lowed by Slanski, The Babylonian Entitlement na- rfis, 203, and Hurowitz, in Context of Scripture, vol. 2, 368). J. A. Brinkman has informed me (per- sonal communication) that this is the latest known attestation in which a Kassite tribesman of the IJabban tribe/clan figures prominently in the officialdom of Babylonia. I"KIR4.DAB is tradition- ally read kartappu; however, S. Cole, based on the equation li-kir4-dab = sak-ru-ma-fi in a bi- lingual list (Cole Nippur, 250: 9, probably 8th cen- tury; see also 123: 2), raises the yet-to-be-proven possibility that the reading sakrumaf is appropri- ate in Kassite and post-Kassite attestations of this logographically written title (Cole Nippur, 250). vi 20: mTUK-fi-DINGIR1 is rendered as Ittabii- ilu by King (BBSt., 126; followed by Hurowitz, in Context of Scripture, vol. 2, 368), and as Subgi-Ilu by Slanski (The Babylonian Entitlement narfis, 208), both of which are unattested with this spell- ing as far as I am aware (cf. Ibagii-ilum, Stamm Namengebung, 20f., 135, and Baii-ilum, 135). Ad- ditionally, the TUK sign, rather than GAL, sug- gests ragif, or perhaps iSfi. For lIu-ilam (OAKK), see Stamm Namengebung, 129; for Raii-ili (NB/ LB/NA), see AHw. sub ilu(m) mng. 3g as well as Stamm Namengebung, 252 and Tallqvist APN, 186; Tallqvist NBN, 174; Stamm Namengebung, 252. Moreover, note Borger's comment, "Ituku-li-dingir = Raliii-ilu... Unsicher, ob tuku in N.P. auch banf S gelesen werden kann" (Borger Zeichenliste, no. 574); cf. Ekur-Juma-uSargi (TUK-si) in i 21, 30; ii 8, 15; iii 28; iv 51. vi 23: The reading and meaning of the PN are uncertain. The name also occurs in BBSt., no. 28 rev. 22-23 (Nabi-apla-iddina) and A 33600 = 4 NT 3 12'. The reading in King, mTP-ba-lat-lItar (BBSt., 126; followed by Slanski, The Babylonian Entitlement naris, 203, and Hurowitz, in Context of Scripture, vol. 2, 368), cannot stand, as the re- quired ig8/eg18 sign for the ligature is not present (nor is the DINGIR sign which Slanski includes in her transliteration). Also note that durative forms are rarely attested in PNs (see Stamm Na- mengebung, 95-96). In BBSt., no. 28 (p. 105) the PN is read mTam-ma-lad-dar (see Brinkman, ZA 78 [1988] 87-88 n. 37 for corrections to BBSt.; Brinkman PKB, 207 and n. 1281). As noted by Brinkman, the DAR sign is rare in early NB and is used mainly to express this PN (note, however, the PNs mlb-ni-lI8-rtdrl [BA 16 (1919) 126 iii 7] and mKan-dar-fam-li [VAS 1, 35: 29], both ninth century). The first element of the PN is, perhaps, tambd, 3.f.sg. pret. of nabi with 1.sg. dative, i.e., 'she named me' (cf. fTam-bi-Na-na, fTam-Da-du [Clay PN, 136]; see also Stamm Namengebung, 106-7); of course masculine names may be con- strued with a 2.f.sg. verb, e.g., mTulid- Sam . For nabi construed with the dative, note, for exam- ple, imbzium-ma Apsii 'Ea named it Apsfi' (En. el. I 76). The second element of the PN, fad-dar, is obscure, see CAD S/1 sub Sadaru; however, note the equation dSad-da-ri = dNinurta (CT 25, 12 iii 10). J. A. Brinkman informs me (personal com-</page><page sequence="77">THE SUN-GOD TABLET OF NABU-APLA-IDDINA REVISITED 99 munication) that igakin temi is not the title of a provincial governor until the time of Nabo-apla- iddina's son, Marduk-zakir-Sumi I; the governor of Isin is still designated as gikin GN (or possibly gakin mat GN) in this reign as demonstrated by BBSt., no. 28 rev. 20 and BBSt. no. 29 ii 9. vi 26: According to Brinkman PKB, 304 n. 2004, bel ptihati is the title of a provincial governor in Assyria, but not in Babylonia, at this time; more recently, however, Brinkman makes the tenta- tive suggestion (personal communication) that bel pthati may in fact denote a Babylonian provincial governor in this period as well. vi 28: 'NA1 omitted in 5R, pls. 60-61. vi 30: For na4KISIB LUGAL id fip-re-e-ti, see CS, 220 and pl. 36k-an octagonal prism, with the symbols of Marduk and Nabfi standing beside a pair of antithetically entwined goats; the inscrip- tion reads na4KISIB LUGAL fip-re-e-ti id LUGAL. Mipretu is encountered in a variety of idioms: ku- nuk fipreti fa farri, kunuk garri Ma fipre~ti, ga- bard kunuk garri Sa fipre~ti, and tuppi fipretu, all designating, according to Brinkman and Dalley, "either the king's official seal or the original (or copy) of a tablet sealed by the king's official seal" (ZA 78 [1988] 92 n. 70). Brinkman translates "sealed official document:' and comments, "Despite the restricted contexts in which fipretu occurs, it seems likely that it refers to official or adminis- trative acts (as a plural of fipirtu, 'command' or 'order'). CAD S sees in Sipretu an institution or re- pository and translated it as 'chancery' or 'official archive'; but this is probably overspecific. Kienast translates it as 'Anweisung' or 'Zuweisung,' which may be appropriate if understood in context as referring to an official act.. " (Brinkman and Dal- ley, ZA 78 [1988] 92 n. 70). The fact that the stone tablet represents a copy (GABA.RI) and that the original was "sealed" (see comm. vi 17), among other evidence from kudurrus, suggests that the original entitlement was a clay tablet upon which an impression of the royal seal was placed (see J. A. Brinkman, "Remarks on Two Kudurrus from the Second Dynasty of Isin' RA 61 [1967] 70-74; Brinkman, RLA 6 [1980-83] 267-74; B. Kienast, "NA4 KISIB LUGAL fa fipre~ti,' in Language, Lit- erature, and History: Philological and Histori- cal Studies Presented to Erica Reiner, AOS 67, ed. E Rochberg-Halton [New Haven, CT: American Oriental Society, 1987], 167-74). The phrase is commonly encountered in kudurrus (see CAD S/3 sub fipretu; Slanski, The Babylonian Entitle- ment narfis, 121-22, 216). vi 43: The lack of a previously mentioned narii excludes the possibility that guatu serves as an anaphoric pronoun in this context (cf. Slanski, The Babylonian Entitlement narits, 106-7); note the previous occurrences of guatu in this text which do, in fact, represent genuine examples of anaph- ora, e.g., SA.DUG4 nudtu (i 26; cf. i 20); (usurti) salmi guatu (iii 30, iv 5, 8, 12 [cf. iii 19]); LU guatu (vi 45; cf. vi 32). In the case of vi 43, how- ever, guatu, is simply the far demonstrative, 'that,' with extended semantic range, used in lieu of the expected near deictic, anna 'this'; note that in parallel contexts from other kudurrus, anna is used, e.g., nard annd (BBSt., no. 4 iv 5; BBSt., no. 8 Add. 6 [p. 48]; cf. kudurri anni [BE 1/2, 149 iii 2; BBSt., no. 4 title line 2]; see also CAD A/2 sub anna mng. k). Cross-linguistically, the relation- ship between demonstratives of varying degrees of remoteness is remarkably unstable. Often the functionally unmarked deictic-almost invariably a non-proximal member-extends its functional range to absorb that of a marked, proximal mem- ber. For fuller discussion of the close, often his- torical, relationships between distal and proximal deictics with references, see J. H. Greenberg, "Some Iconic Relationships among Place, Time, and Discourse Deixis7' in Iconicity in Syntax: Proceedings of a Symposium on Iconicity in Syn- tax, Stanford, June 24-26, 1983. ed.

General Commentary BM 91002 and BM 91004 (clay coffer bearing the inscription: sal-lam dUTU EN UD.KIB.NUNki a-Aib-bi IE.BABBAR.RA, inscribed five times [see BBSt., 120 n. 1]) display several orthographic char- acteristics that are in contrast to the writing of BM 91000 (SGT) and possibly indicate a later date for these artifacts. Observe the following: over 30% of all final vowels depart from historically justified case endings, according to a pattern in which, after a double consonant or two-consonant cluster, the final vowel is attracted to the quality of the vowel of the preceding syllable (e.g., ta- barra nom. [7]; sibti nom. [3, 12]; izhi nom. [6, 10, 11]; note that in BM 91000, case endings are con- sistently assigned according to the MB paradigm to an accuracy of over 91%); -V1C1 for -C1V1 in 18 (i.e., a-su-d-mi-it for a-su-t-mi-ti; spellings of this type do not occur in BM 91000); the spell- ing of the RN in 19 (i.e., mdNA4-IBILA-MU) is not attested in contemporaneous Nabfi-apla-iddina texts, but is typical of later periods; BM 91004 displays two unorthographic bound forms, sal-lam for salam and a-lib-bi for expected afib, that are in marked contrast to the fifty flawlessly expressed bound forms of BM 91000 (e.g., sa-lam [Caption I 1;iv 20], a-fib [Caption I 2; i 2]; see general comm. to BM 91000 above); finally, the garment offer- ings of BM 91004 are nearly identical to those offered in the Chaldean and Persian periods, while several garments of BM 91000 are unknown to the NB lubuitu-ceremony (for a full discussion of these points, which collectively may indicate a later date for BM 91004, see above, A Post-Nabai- apla-iddina Date for the Clay Molds and Coffer). Notes 3: Matsushima reads sfkSib-ti; however, sibtu is always written with the TUG determinative (see CAD S sub sibtu A). Salhu and sibtu garments are both frequently attested in NB wardrobes of SamaS, Aya, and Bunene (see CAD S sub sibtu A mng. 3; CAD S/1 sub falhu mng. b; see also refs. cited in comm. to BM 91000 v 45-46 above). sibtu- garments are also well attested in the NB war- drobes of the Eanna deities, for which it is known that white thread, mihsu pesi, was used in their manufacture (e.g., TCL 12, 107: 2; YOS 7, 183 passim); BIN 2, 128: 2 refers to three minas of alum (na4gaba) for whitening a large sibtu-garment (i.e., t'~"gMAS.GAL) for Nanaya. 4: The first sign is KI, against Jastrow, King, Langdon, and Matsushima, who read KU (kutinnu is a rarely attested OA textile, see CAD K sub ku- tinnu; cf. sub kitinnai, a well-attested NB textile). For sibtu-garments made of kitinnf-linen, note also MAS.ME ia kitinn? (Oberhuber Florenz, 165: 24). hullanu is written hu-la-nu, not hul-la-nu as transliterated by Matsushima; hullanu-wraps are frequently offered in the NB lubustu-ceremony (see refs. cited in comm. to BM 91000 v 45-46 above). 5: At Uruk, fabric of white thread, TUG mihsi pesO, was used in the manufacture of a mdzehu- scarf for the Lady-of-Uruk (YOS 7, 183: 3). For the equation tgNG.IfB.LA = hu-[sa-an-nu], see Hh. XIX 248. According to the CAD, husannu-sashes, made of linen or wool, were worn by goddesses (particularly of Sippar and Uruk), as well as by SamaS; they were usually offered in allotments of six to ten (CAD H sub husannu). At Uruk, at least some the mezehu-scarves offered to Anunitu were made of blue-purple wool, (sg)ZA.GIN.KUR.RA, e.g., Nbn. 794: 4. 6: tugiB.L = ni-[bi-hu] (Hh. XIX 247); t'gIB.[ LA] = ni-bi-rhul (Practical Vocabularly Assur 243 [= AfO 18 (1957-58) 330: 243); tgiB.LA [...] = ni-bi-h[u...] (OECT 6, pl. 15: 12f.); see CAD N/2 sub nebehu lex. for further references.

WOODS takiltu batil 'the work on the nebehu of SamaS is stopped for lack of takiltu-wool' (also BM 82-7- 14, 950 rev. 20); BM 82-7-14, 762: 3 refers to inzahuretu (red dye) and na4gabp (alum) for the nebehu of SamaS (cited in CAD N/2 sub nebehu mng. le). The difference between nebehu- and husannu-sashes remains obscure; that they both occur in our text as well as ZA 4 (1889) 137 no. 4 (among the garments of SamaS and Aya) shows that the two garments are indeed to be distin- guished (noted in CAD N/2 sub nebehu), iz-hi (also in 10, 11) has previously been understood as AM, without translation, in previous editions. iz-hi is taken here for ezhi, the verbal adj. of ezehu (esehu) 'to tie on' (CAD E sub ezehu). For ezhu (eshu) 'tied around (the waist)', note it-lu-pu-ti = mu-su-P ez-hu-ti "tied musi-garments" (CT 18, 13 iii 35 [synonym list]). nebehu ezhu, perhaps means 'tied sash' or 'sash used as a belt'; cf. CAD, I-J sub izhu, with the definition 'belt, string,' how- ever, the examples quoted suggest a meaning 'string' rather than 'belt. 7: The underlying Akkadian term for the logo- gram '"gMURUB4.iB.LA is unknown; however, Hh. XIX 248a recension G (BM 4091 + 40724) includes tagMURUB4.[ ] immediately following t'gfB.LA = ni-[bi-hu] (247) and t'"NIG.fB.LA = hu-[sa-an-nu] (248). Clearly tagMURUB4.IB.L, is a girdle, sash or belt closely related to nebehu and husannu. Salonen translates 'Htiftgiirtel' (NUVI 3, 140; see comm. to BM 91000 v 45-46 above for reference); for further attestations, note Nbn. 410 (= NUVI 3, 40): 5, 6 for Sama~ and Bunene; Cyr. 7 (106): 5, 8, 16 for SamaS, Bunene, and Adad; Cyr. 232 (120): 21 for Bunene; VAS 6, 26 (242): 10, 13 (broken); CT 44, 73 (249): 19 for SamaS and Bunene. TUG.UD.A is a variant spelling for TUG.HI.A (note also the spelling TUG.UD.HI.A, e.g., Camb. 66: 4), i.e., lubaru. The term may be used as a ge- neric word for garment, as is the case in this line as well as 10 and 14; it may also refer to a divine wardrobe in general (i.e., 11), or serve as a deter- minative before specific articles of clothing (i.e., 8; similarly, note TUG.UD.A me-tu TUG.UD.A ku-lu- lu sgZA&lt;.GIN&gt;.KUR.RA id dUTU "metu-garments and blue-purple kulalu-turbans of blue-purple wool for SamaS" [CT 4, 38a 1-2]); see CAD L sub lubaru mng. 1h-2'a', b'. The interchange of UD with HI is well attested in the writing for refined or dry bitumen, i.e., ESIR.HI.A, ESIR.UD.A, as well as ESIR.E.A, see A. Draffkorn Kilmer, "Two New Lists of Key Numbers for Mathematical Opera- tions,' OrNS 29 (1960) 291 n. 3; CAD I-J sub. ittai A. Similarly, in the texts collected in NUVI 3, TUG.HI.A alternates with TUG.UD.A (and TUG. UD.HI.A). For tabarru-wool see comm. to BM 91000 v 47-48. 8: The last sign is GADA, not KI.LAL, as copied by Jastrow, nor GIS as transliterated by Langdon and King. TiUG.UD.A zi-qu is taken as a garment with crenellated hem. ziqqu has the primary meaning of 'crest, edge, battlement,' and, with transferred meaning, is used to refer to garments (or jewelry) with a crenellated hem or design, see CAD Z sub ziqqu A mng. 2. For the use of crenel- lated patterns on garments, and their apotropaic functions, see A. L. Oppenheim, "Golden Garments of the Gods,' JNES 8 (1949) 186, 190. For addi- tional attestations of ziqqu in NB, note: 2 lu-ba-ri ziq-qu (Nbn. 284 [= NUVI 3, 38]: 26); TUG.HI.A ziq-qu (VAS 6, 15 [237]: 2). TUG.HI.A ziqqu in our text, and in NB in general, is equivalent to TUG ziqqu of MB (see the references provided in CAD Z sub ziqqu A mng. 2b); for TUG.IJI.A, i.e., lubaru, in this line, see comm. to 7. 9: The last sign is SA, not SA, as transliterated by Matsushima; SA is indicated as an erasure in Jastrow's copy. takiltu is consistently written with the haplography ZA.KUR.RA for (sig)ZA.GIN.

Joanni~s, however, reads the last sign of the RN as MU, not SES, based on the photographs provided by King in BBSt., pi. 101 and thus reads the RN as Nabix-apla-iddina rather than as Nabopolassar (NABU 1991/113). Despite Bongenaar's claim that the final sign of the king's can be read as either -'SES' (-usur&gt; or -rMU' (-iddina) owing to an erasure (Ebabbar Temple, 305 n. 274), a collation of the RN by I.
