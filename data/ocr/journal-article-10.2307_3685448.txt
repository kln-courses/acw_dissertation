<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chance, Progress and Complexity in Biological Evolution Rdmy Lestienne The idea of continuous progress occupies an essential place in the personal metaphysics of many of our contemporaries. It is so embedded in their minds that they would have a hard time living without it. This is why the reminder of what evolution owes to chance, coming from certain contemporary biologists and paleontologists like Stephen Jay Gould, is salutory. The recent book by the latter, Full House, forces us to reexamine the applications of the notion of chance in the domain of biological evolution. This said, we must recognize that the specificity of the living creature, by incorporating in its very genome the history of the presumably victorious variations of its ancestors, draws the evolution of each separately considered branch along a precise trajectory, subject to constraints rooted in its history. If we must repudiate the idea of progress as too tainted by ideology, mustn't we conclude that these trajectories carry certain living creatures toward an accrued complexity, and across certain thresholds from which they cannot turn back, thereby creating new, emerging qualities? Mathematical Chance and its Applications in Biology In order to decide whether a physical or biological phenomenon is the result of chance, we must have a rigorous definition of this notion, as well as a method for deciding if the phenomenon fits this definition. Unfortunately, objective chance (which applies to things themselves, as opposed to ignorant chance or subjective chance) is a notion for which it is impossible to come up with a universal, operational definition. We cannot define chance, except in its lack, its negative form, by the absence of order. The notion of disorder is easily characterized by the unpredictability associated with it. The outcome of a roll of the dice or the flip of a coin cannot be guessed in advance. It can also be said that the results of a long series of coin flipping is very complex, meaning that once again the sequence is unpredictable. But what does this mean in concrete terms? If we think SubStance # 91, 2000 39</page><page sequence="2">40 R6my Lestienne about it, we would agree that this sequence cannot be described in a more simple way than by the statement of each of the events that comprise it; there is no way to shorten its description, to condense the account. In fact, this is the conclusion reached by three mathematicians specializing in chance: Solomonoff, Kolmogorov and Chaitin. The three have proposed the following definition for chance: "the workings of chance cannot be summarized" (Chaitain, 1975). Thus, in order to prove that a series of heads or tails or a series equivalent to "0" and "1" (more easily manipulated in a computer, which can interpret it as a series of binary instructions) is truly chance, one must prove that there is no shorter algorithmic program capable of reproducing it on a computer. Intuitively, we can see the difficulty of this enterprise. G6del's Theorem establishes its impossibility: it cannot be proved that a sequence is pure chance, as defined above, when its length exceeds that of the binary information contained in all the founding axioms. Thus "chance" is a horizon whose positive definition will always elude us. The parallel between the notions of chance and of complexity can be further clarified. The notion of a minimal program for describing a phenomenon in fact allows us to define its complexity. One could say that the complexity of a series of numbers or of a machine designed by an engineer is measured by the length of the minimal program (expressed in information "bits") required to produce it. From the foregoing, one can guess that the larger the place left to chance in the architecture of the functioning of a system, the greater its complexity, understood in this sense. However, a mathematical definition of complexity is not completely appropriate for biology; one could say that it is not "complex" enough, in the sense that it certainly does not correspond to what a biologist means when he marvels at the complexity of a paramecium, or a neuroscientist when he contemplates the human brain. Admittedly, there is a lot of chance in the series of events that lead to the birth of a living being, but there is an enormous amount of order as well. In which direction should we seek to complete the abbreviated definition given thus far of complexity? Ilya Prigogine has shown how organized complex systems can emerge from a natural evolution, if they are far from thermodynamic balance and are "open"-that is, capable of exchanging matter and energy with the exterior at all times. Then, and only then, can they find sources of order in their environment-or, as it's termed, draw from the environment the flows of "neguentropy" necessary for their edification, without breaking the general law of the growth of entropy. The Franco-Israeli researcher Henri Atlan, author of the book with the suggestive title Entre le cristal et lafumde (Between SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="3">Chance, Progress and Complexity in Evolution 41 the Crystal and the Smoke) went a step further when he understood that the complexity of natural systems is constructed by a reduction of its internal redundancy, some of its redundant features being used to create new features, leading to an increase in complexity, understood as an increase in information necessary for assembling the system from its components. Thus there is clearly a relationship between complexity and chance, on the one hand, and complexity and information, on the other. But the decisive step consists of determining that complex systems are systems organized in levels, such as, in the living creature, the nucleus of the cell, the cell, the organ, etc. These successive hierarchical levels admittedly are not enough to make a system complex. A system only becomes biologically complex if the different levels are not completely autonomous, if there is, alongside the clear separation between them, a collection of functional relations-not just the integration of lower levels into higher levels, but also "top-down" reactions going from the higher levels to the lower ones. These are the "intigrons," to use the term introduced by Francois Jacob in La logique du vivant (1970). Finally, all things in a living being must be thought of in terms of system; there is no water- tight separation between levels. A Brief History of the Idea of Progress Life, then, presupposes a rare level of complexity. This was not reached in a flash. In this sense, evolution obviously has brought about in increase in complexity. Is this also a sure sign that the history of the world is one of progress? Mankind has not always harbored the idea of necessary progress. The ancient Greeks lived in a circular world, which satisfied them completely. In ancient Greece, the cultural world as a practical organization suggested a circular model for nature and a cyclical model for time. This idea was already expressed in the eighth century B.C., in the poems of Hesiod, which illustrate the cyclical conception of time intimately linked to agricultural activities. This conception is elevated to a system by Plato. According to him, the source of the myth of circularity can be found in the apparent movement of the stars. Although one can find pertinent reflections on the transformations of the world among the ancient philosophers, such as Aristotle or Lucretius, it seems that the idea of progress did not take off until the arrival of Christianity, with its historical notion of redemption and the hope of salvation, and also thanks to the progressive substitution of linear time for theAncients' circular time (see, for example, my The Children of Time). Didn't St. Augustine write SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="4">42 R6my Lestienne in The City of God, "It is only through the profound doctrine of rectilinear time that we can escape from these doctrines of I know not what cycles, proposed by ignorant and deceiving ages..."? Developed by classical philosophers (Leibniz, Kant), the idea of progress would be crowned in the nineteenth century by the work of Auguste Comte, who bequeathed his motto to the nascent state of Brazil: Ordem e Progresso. But already the historical materialism of the German philosophers was looming on the horizon. In the same way that Marxist socialism can be interpreted as a burgeoning of religious social ideas, historical materialism borrowed a good deal from the idea of progress. It is not by chance that the development of the thought of Marx and Engels is contemporary to the appearance and development of Darwinian evolution, even if at the time these two currents of thought had little interaction. In biology, the idea of progress appeared in the writings of naturalists in the eighteenth century, particularly in the works of the French naturalist, Georges Buffon. We are in the habit of attributing the triumph of the idea of progress in evolution to Darwinism, just as it's sometimes said that Darwinism is the chance of variations, plus selection. Such abbreviated versions are caricatures, and very unfair to Darwin. In fact, he harbored an instinctive distrust of the idea of progress. He had a subtle, if not embarrassed position on this question. We recall that he confided to Asa Gray, "The sight of a peacock feather makes me sick." He pondered the notion of the progress of evolution, which brought him to a very personal understanding of nature and of the role of chance in evolution. In fact, as the French historian Charles Lenay has shown (1996), Darwin advocates systemic chance. For him, there is no water-tight partition between chance variations and selection, or, more precisely, this partition is only impermeable in one direction. Selection has no influence over variations; variations are not brought about by a tendency toward "progress." On the other hand, variations can and do strongly influence the conditions of selection. Thus if the conditions of selection impose from the outside a rigid and evolutive framework, what can result is an evolution that takes on the appearance of progress, despite the completely random nature of the variations. Because Darwin had clearly seen both the distinction between variation and selection and the possible passageways from the former to the latter, he had, in a sense, foreseen the first level of Franqois Jacob's notion of the integron. In fact, we can see in the subtlety of this distinction all the difference that exists between strict Darwinism and modern Lamarkism. The latter seems ready to abandon the idea of the transmission of acquired SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="5">Chance, Progress and Complexity in Evolution 43 characteristics, but wants to hold fast to the possibility of reciprocal influences between variations and selection, despite the partition that separates them. For Darwinians, such influences cannot take place except in the sense of variations' influence on the type of selection that takes place, as we see every day in animal breeding practices. On the other hand, for them, the partition between desirable selection and the randomness of variation is absolutely inviolable. For a modern Lamarkian, there exists two-way traffic between the two domains; directed mutations are not impossible. The question of the existence or non-existence of directed mutations has perhaps not yet been definitely decided. It will be admitted here that they do not exist. It is nonetheless true that, as Jacob superbly describes, chance is opportunistic, and its opportunism can very well have the appearance of progress. So much so that (and this point, largely neglected by the original Darwinists, has been rightly revalorized by Ernst Mayr [1989]), Darwinian selection does not concern just adaptation to external constraints; invisible barriers also arise that favor living creatures' adopting particular behaviors. To return to Darwinism and the notion of progress, we must recall that it was the disciples of Darwin, led by Spencer, who took up the idea of evolution to enroll themselves under the banner of progress, at the risk of compromising Darwinism to a certain extent with the tenacious Lamarkism of the continental biologists. Once the success of Darwinian evolutionism was consolidated, the idea of life's progression toward growing complexity was rapidly established. The idea of orthogenesis, introduced by the German zoologist Johannes Wilhelm in 1893, was developed primarily by the Swiss-German zoologist Gustav Eimer in the second part of his master-work on "the origin of species based on the transmission of acquired qualities according to the laws of organic growth" (1897). Eimer was an ardent neo-Lamarkian, and endorsed the importance of direct environmental influence on evolution. In parallel, the Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo proposed in 1893 the law now called "Dollo's Law." It stipulates that evolution is irreversible in the following sense: every organ that is lost is lost forever; it is never reinvented in the same form. Dollo's ideas are similar to the theses defended in the same era by the great Swiss botanist Naegeli, who taught that biological evolution tended toward perfection. On the other hand, by the end of the nineteenth century, the law of the growth of entropy, which had been set forth in 1850 by the German physicist Rudolph Clausius, had had its day. Thereafter, the idea of progress in the SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="6">44 R6my Lestienne material world was condemned by thermodynamics. This science proclaimed that any material system in the world was destined, sooner or later, to the gloomy fate of average uniformity and absolute disorder in the details. From that point on, the idea of progress could only take refuge in areas of life--biology and sociology. In the first half of the twentieth century, Henri Bergson, one of the most important French philosophers, still professed that life manifested a stubborn tendency to run counter to the course of entropy. In L'Evolution creatrice (1907) he wrote, "In fact, all of our analyses show us life's effort to climb back up the descent made by matter." In reality, as we know today, it is possible to reconcile the ontogenic development of the living creature with the teachings of thermodynamics. This reconciliation was made possible by the development of the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, notably thanks to the work of the chemist Ilya Prigogine and the Brussells school that he leads. This theory allows us to understand how dissipative structures-that is, those that are open to exchanges of matter and energy with the external environment, are capable of spontaneous auto-organization and of evolution towards more and more organized states. While this concerns biological systems, we must bear in mind that life's march toward organization takes place under a triple sign. First, the living organism carries in itself the memory of its own phylogenetic evolution. Second, biological evolution does not take place in a uniform fashion; the molecular clocks contained in the living organism do not all tick at the same rate; their functioning is profoundly influenced by the environment. Third, in evolving, organisms gain in complexity, that is, in attendant hierarchical interactions. To say that this constitutes progress or not depends entirely on one's definition of this term. Progress in Evolution? The Debate Continues These days, the exchange of insults between the worshippers of progress and the thurifers of the absurd goes unabated. Although successive corrections to Darwinism may have given the impression that a truce were possible, the gulf between biologists who are fervent partisans of the neutrality of evolution (in short, Anglo-Saxon molecular biologists, largely attached to a strictly material Darwinism, in spite of its apparent incompatibility with the Protestant tradition), and those who belong to another school of thought (where many European paleontologists will recognize themselves) more concerned with interpreting filiations and ever- SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="7">Chance, Progress and Complexity in Evolution 45 increasing biological complexity, and more inclined to inject a dose of Lamarkism into strictly Darwinian thought. The former imply that the latter's attitude is dictated by a secret desire for philosophical coherence, for harmony with their profound metaphysical convictions. The latter reply that to place evolution under the sign of totally blind chance fails to account for facts well established by biology and paleontology, that this is simply a matter of science, and that the former have no real case against them. In recent years, we have seen various proposals for modifying Darwinism, to open the door to some Lamarkian ideas. L'Encyclopedie Universalis, the French equivalent of the much-revered Encyclopedia Britannica, in a text by the late biologist Pierre-Paul Grasse, stresses that no thinker was as unjustly calumnied as the Marquis de Lamarck, and urges his rehabilitation. A whole series of articles published in the French press in 1990 alone bear witness to this climate: "Darwinians Bid to Take Over Lamark" (J. Cosagliola), "Revising Darwinism" (M.F. Depange), "The Darwinians Have Evolved" (P. Chambon). But the most enthusiastic European proponent of the idea of evolutionary progress, the great apostle of the complexification of life, was undoubtedly the Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. In his Le Phinomene humain (1955) he embraced the cause of orthogenesis: My old-fashioned conviction is [...], on the contrary, that the word is essential and irreplaceable to mark and affirm living matter's manifest ability to form a system at whose heart terms succeed one another experimentally, following the ever-increasing values of centro-complexity. (116) Stephen Jay Gould: A "Full House" of Variations Explains the Illusion of Progress No doubt in reaction to what he considered inadmissible weaknesses, Stephen Jay Gould published his pamphlet "Full House" in 1996, addressed to the public at large. Its intent was to call the bluff of these metaphysical meanderings, and to remind everyone of a few elementary truths about evolution. These truths deny evolution any biological trend whatsoever, and, according to Gould, ruin any arguments that could establish a biological definition of the notion of progress. SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="8">46 R6my Lestienne Thus, according to Gould, the so-called law of perpetual progress in evolution is incompatible with the following facts: 1) evolution is still overwhelmingly dominated by micro-organisms, as it always has been, and globally does not show any tendency whatsoever toward complexification, 2) the area opened to variations by mutation of the genome of a new species is often mainly open toward increased size and complexity, but is generally strictly constrained in the opposite direction. Living creatures cannot evolve toward simplification and/or reduced size, because there is a minimal complexity required for an organism of any given type to be viable. Thus, the tendency to complexification, which many others besides Teilhard consider as evident in the web of life, is in reality a simple illusion, linked to our tendency to pay attention solely to organisms of maximum complexity over the course of evolution, rather than considering all forms of life present during each era, and determining that the dominant forms are essentially stable... Let's return to these two points. First, micro-organisms have always been the dominant form of life on earth. The story of life begins with them, some 3.5-3.6 billion years ago. The first eukaryotic living things, still single-celled, but with a separate cytoplasmic nucleus, did not appear for another 1.8-1.9 billion years, so that at least one-half of the history of life concerns only bacteria. The first multi- celled animals did not come on the scene until 580 million years ago. Single- celled life forms developed along three great axes: bacteria, archaeobacteria, and finally the eukaryotes. Much later, the latter will give birth to what we commonly call animals. The archaeobacteria form a world of their own, using different energy sources than do ordinary bacteria. They do not depend on the sun for life, but on the chemical resources of sulphur, present in the volcanic depths of the ocean. But even without counting this category, and considering only ordinary bacteria, are you aware that a single teaspoonful of rich soil contains 10 billion bacteria-more than the number of human beings on the entire planet? And that the bacteria inhabiting the human digestive system are at least equally numerous? These microscopic forms of life deserve our attention, for without them organic material could not be digested, nor could dead organic matter be recycled, which would have grave consequences. Thomas Gold has estimated (1992) that the total mass of bacterial organisms buried deep underground could be as much as 2 x 1014 tons, while people only "weigh" about one millionth of this. Second, the variations responsible for evolution are truly the results of chance. It's not variations that create an apparent direction in evolution, but SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="9">Chance, Progress and Complexity in Evolution 47 an imbalance in the ordinary conditions to be fulfilled so that organisms that result from these variations can live; organisms that are smaller or less complex than a certain threshold usually are not viable. Gould tells us the story of the Foraminifera, that miniscule ocean-dwelling protozoan whose single cell is surround by a calcareous capsule perforated by minute orifices and equipped with pseudopodes. These animals developed during the Cretaceous era (66-144 million years ago). After their appearance, the Foraminifera were twice decimated, to the point that, both times, only a small, weak sub-group succeeded in surviving. Now, in each of the three examples that history affords us of the evolution of this group, while the size of the largest species derived from the primitive strain clearly grew, the great majority of the Foraminfera species kept its original small size. Thus, during the major accident that caused the disappearance of the dinosaurs, at the junction of the Cretaceous and the Tertiary Eras, the Foraminifera experienced a massive extinction. During the following era (the Paleogene, 68-38 million years ago), they developed once again. A multitude of new species appeared, and some of them, over the generations, acquired a nice size (up to 1-1.5 mm. in diameter), while most of the species kept their primitive size (ca. 0.2 mm.). But their history started all over again: a new accident, about 36 million years ago, again decimated the Foraminifera. In the next era, the Neogene, the same pattern is seen: the Foraminifera diversify, some species of larger size emerge, but once again most of the species remain the size of the original stock. Thus, two periods of near-extinction have given rise to three successive instances of growth, and each of these periods was marked by a nearly identical scenario: the diversification of a small group always springs from a small-sized species, as though large sizes were a major hindrance to survival in catastrophic conditions. We must bear in mind that at the time of the disappearance of the dinosaurs, our own future was only ensured by the modest size of our then-ancestors-small lemurs the size of a mouse. If some species diversify enough to acquire a large size, the mode-i.e. the dominant aspect-remains linked to miniature forms. Gould concludes that the so-called law of progress of life, or of growing complexity, is only an illusion that we must rid ourselves of. Such a conclusion runs counter to our spontaneous and quasi-religious penchant for believing that the world is embarked on a history that has direction and meaning. It especially upsets our facile conviction of mankind's special status as the crowning achievement of evolution. In fact, we are quick, "if only for SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="10">48 R6my Lestienne legitimate parochial reasons," as Gould says, to consider ourselves as masterpieces of nature, as the final, long-sought product of natural evolution. But Gould warns us that humans only appeared on earth by chance, and only thanks to a "full house" of Darwinian variations. They might never have appeared. They will certainly not return on the world scene if, following some cosmological cataclysm, conditions are some day reproduced on earth that are similar to those prevailing at life's origin. Nonetheless, I believe that Gould's case must be nuanced by three considerations. First of all, the history of life is not monotonous. Gould would certainly agree, but this poses the problem of the mechanisms that control the rhythm of evolution. Second, life is loaded with history, and this history represents constraints that limit the possible directions taken by variations. Finally, if the history of life does not produce progress in the direction, for example, of the size of living organisms, it nonetheless seems to produce an objective trend in the complexity of living beings, considered as an emerging quality in the course of the history of life. Living Things Contain Memory that Constrains Their Future Evolution What characterizes biological systems is first of all that they develop according to a program inscribed within them. Genetic information not only enables them to function correctly, but also encodes the history of the system in the macromolecules of the genome. Organisms carry their own history with them, so to speak, or at least the history of fortuitous mutations that allowed their ancestors to survive, and even flourish. This historicity is inseparable from the irreversibility of evolution. This point is sometimes neglected in discussions of the biology of evolution. Daniel Brooks and his colleagues write: The production of biological diversity is a genealogical phenomenon. Each generation represents a pool of phenotypic diversity. This potential is large but not unlimited, due to unique genealogy, or historical constraint. Reproduction actualizes some of the phenotypic potential but filters out the rest as a genetic constraint. Ontogeny further restricts the range of phenotypes as developmental constraints operate to produce fewer phenotypes than genotypes. Finally, not all of the organisms produced can live to reproduce in the environment in which they occur; this environmental constraint is natural selection. This process is also directional in time. ("Dollow's Law" 189-224). From this point of view, for Brooks and Wiley, selection indeed creates a direction and sense of evolution, contrary to what Gould affirms. SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="11">Chance, Progress and Complexity in Evolution 49 Physical chance, unlike mathematical chance, never operates in reverse, never destroys what it has erected, in the sense that its manifestations are always strictly associated with irreversibility. I have long defended this distinction between mathematical and physical chance (see my Le Hasard Crdateur, 1993). This trait, which is already true when one talks, like Maxwell, about the evolution of a gas, is even more true about life, since the history of life remains forever inscribed in the genetic heritage of the individual. This is why the march of evolution is not a matter of haphazard excursions or "random walks," or a drunkard's path. Its own history frames it, imposes rules and constraints to which, little by little, variations and selection must obey in order to produce viable organisms. This vigorously constrains the available phase-space, giving the impression that life "climbs back up the slope of entropy," as Bergson believed he could affirm, when it is only a matter of the slightest augmentation of phase-space comparedto total phase- space, as Brooks and Wiley have shown (1986). Of course, there is no opposition between the dynamic description furnished by population genetics and the irreversibility of phylogenes, but population genetics is not enough to explain the irreversible nature of phylogenes. "Dynamics and thermodynamics are complementary, not antagonistic," Wiley declares (1988). Here again, Francois Jacob has traced the route of our growing awareness of the truly creative role of time, in terms of biological evolution. Not time alone, but the conjunction of chance and time in systems that are essentially open to external influences and subject to the judgments of natural selection. He wrote in La Logique du vivant: However rudimentary the bacterial cell may appear in the array of living organisms, considerable periods of time were necessary for it to become an organized system. If the bacteria functions with such virtuosity, it is because for billions of years its ancestors were put to the test of this chemistry, while scrupulously noting the recipe for each success. This is where the cutoff is made between the living world and the inanimate world, between biology and physics. Inanimate bodies are not dependent on time. Living bodies are indissolubly linked to it. For them, no structure can be detached from history. (316) The Acceleration of Mutations The conjunction of the methods of paleontology and molecular biology have taught us that molecular clocks do not all tick at the same rate. If we estimate that on the average, the rate of mutation of chromosomic DNA, for SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="12">50 R6my Lestienne example in the case of substitutions of one basic pair by another non- synonymous basic pair in an exon, is in mammals 2 x 10-9 mutations per year (two mutations per billion base pairs in the DNA), we must admit that this is only a very general average. Several molecular clocks tick at different rates within the same organism, according to whether we're looking at exons or introns, and synonymous substitutions or not. Further, in a same lineage, rhythm can vary according to geological eras, experiencing sudden accelerations that contrast with long periods of stagnation. The most often cited example, and rightly so, since it touches us, is that of the acceleration of cerebral capacity in the human primate over the last million years. This sudden acceleration does not seem to have been immediately accompanied by the appearance of superior mental functions such as language, art, and burial of the dead, so that it is unlikely that the development of the organ was influenced by the development of the function. Unlike traditional Darwinians, who think that evolution continues imperturbably, guided only by chance mutation, and thus at an approximately constant rate, Gould observes that the rhythms of mutations change. Alongside species that have lived for millions of years without any notable morphological modification, such as the famous coelacanth fish, we can observe periods of accelerated evolution, like that which allowed the passage of reptiles to birds in a few million years. It is only very recently that we begin to understand how such changes of rhythm are possible. It's widely held that sexuality was invented by nature because it represented a decisive advantage for the adaptation of species, because of the mixture of genes it affords. Bacteria themselves have a kind of sexual life. Admittedly, they do not need sexuality to reproduce, since they achieve this by simple cellular division. But they can exchange genes, either because a plasmid (a DNA loop lodged not in the nucleus, but in the cytoplasm) can in certain cases cross the bacterial walls of two attached bacteria (the phenomenon of conjugation), or by the intermediary of a virus, a veritable "go-between" that takes with itself small pieces of gene from its first host (the phenomena of transduction). These phenomena of genetic transport can concern neighboring species, such as the bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, which, it is believed, diverged from a common ancestor some 150 million years ago. Interspecies recombinations are relatively rare, since they are normally strongly inhibited by controlling genes, which are precisely those in charge of repairing errors in copies of DNA during replication. Now, it is enough to provoke a single mutation in SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="13">Chance, Progress and Complexity in Evolution 51 one or the other of the genes in this system of mismatch repair (SMR), to suddenly make interspecies recombinations possible. On the other hand, there is another system of genetic control, called the SOS system, which is activated when DNA replication is hindered by stressful external conditions, and acts in the opposite direction from SMR. Thus the two systems, SMR and SOS, act on genetic variability in opposite ways. When the genes of the SOS system are active, they augment genetic variability considerably. To return to the excellent comparison cited by Taddei, Matic and Radman (1996), let us imagine the work of copyist monks in the Middle Ages. Now and then a monk makes an error. The SMR is there to correct it. But in stressful situations, the SOS works in the opposite direction, stimulating errors, as though it had given a shot of cognac to the copyist monk. Among bacteria, the average rate of mutation is around one mutation per 300 generations. This rate of mutation by generation varies depending on the environment-for example, in cases of food shortages. Variations are facilitated, the field of possibilities widens, and opportunistic chance can profit from the situation to facilitate the necessary adaptations. On the other hand, too great a rate of mutation diminishes the possibility of reproduction. Thus in the given conditions of the external environment, there exists an optimum rate of mutation, which maximizes the possibilities of adaptation, while respecting the species' ability for multiplication. During periods of prolonged stress, there is an accrued selection of genes that augment genetic variability, both for favorable and deleterious mutations. Now, whether they affect introns or exons, the total number of mutations determines the barrier to cross-breeding among species. As a general rule, recombinations coming from two different species are eliminated. But it is possible that they present a higher level of adaptation to the kind of stress that activated the SOS system, and in this case hybrids will lead to the appearance of a new species. Thus the classical Darwinian model must be adapted as follows: in cases of stress, and only in such cases, the array of possible variations is extended, to multiply the possibilities of favorable mutations. There is however no finality, since all mutations, favorable or deleterious, are equally favored. The mutations in question are undirected. The SMR system seems to exist among all living organisms (it seems likely that mutations in this system may be responsible for diseases such as arteriosclerosis, or a predisposition to colonic cancer), but the existence of an SOS system among higher organisms remains to be demonstrated. Eucaryotes possess systems analogous to SOS, but we do not know if the latter share a common origin with bacteria. SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="14">52 R6my Lestienne Over the last 20 years, we have discovered regulatory genes-homeotic genes-that are very important, since they direct the general organization of the individual. It would be particularly interesting to know if these genes are themselves controlled by systems of regulation that depend on stress or on type of SOS, and to know their rate of mutation. Judging from their good conservation, from bacteria to fruit flies to people, this rate is clearly quite low, but on the other hand a single mutation in this system can have major consequences for the organism, such as the transformation of a wing into a paw, as the research team of Walter Gehring in Bale has shown (Gehring, 1987). On the Road to the Infinitely Complex Interactions between the environment and mutations, and between variations and selection, are thus much more complex than a model with impermeable partitions would suggest. It remains that basic mutations never seem oriented. Can one nonetheless say that despite everything, life tends, even blindly, toward complexity? If so, what complexity are we talking about? A quarter of a century ago, Franqois Jacob had already suggested an answer to this question. He said that in biology we must give complexity a definition that takes into account its specificity-that is, its hierarchical organization. In the domain of the living we have not only the integration of parts in the whole, but also and essentially, the appearance and reverberations of the whole in the parts. Gould's biological examples, taken from lower organisms, are perhaps a bit lacking in this respect. What about, for example, the explosion in the cerebral capacity of primates over the last million years? Can it be explained by cultural evolution, the only field that Gould is willing to concede to Lamarkism, since in this domain education and knowledge are obviously transmissible from one generation to the next? Now, as we have seen, the modern idea of complexity combines two aspects: on the one hand, a lot of information is necessary in order to build a complex system from these elements. On the other hand, a complex system includes some non-autonomous hierarchical levels-there is not only integration of parts in a whole, but also reverberation of the whole in the parts. This is a fundamental aspect of Franqois Jacob's thinking. Intigrons are an essential component of complexity, when we're talking about living things (La Logique du vivant, 1970): At the macroscopic level, evolution thus rests on the constitution of new systems of communication, both at the core of the organism and between it and its surroundings. At the microscopic level, this is translated by the modification of genetic programs, in both quality and quantity. (329).

Ours contains a number of nerve cells that is greater than the number of stars in the galaxy. Now, the galaxy is not a very complex system, for if stars communicate with each other by gravitational attraction (which assures the cohesion of mass), on the other hand this has little influence on the fate of stars belonging to this system, which is mainly regulated by nuclear interactions, at a lower hierarchical level. On the contrary, neurons interact constantly, especially through trains of nerve impulses, and by chemical messages that they transmit from one to the other. In the human brain, the contacts between neurons (the synapses) are so numerous that in order to count them, one per second, it would take ten million years! Now, these influences are not exercised only in an ascending path, toward the cerebral cortex, but also (and perhaps more importly) in descending routes. There are ten times as many nerves descending from the cortex toward the thalamus, a sort of intermediary switchboard at the center of the brain, than the number of nerves running from the thalamus toward the cortex. Only a reverberating organization of this type seems able to allow conscious sensation, and explains how the latter is often followed by a motor order- an example of a major influence of the whole on the part. Thus, by the wide use it makes of chance in both its construction and its functioning, by the richness of its hierarchical levels and by the exceptional quality of its reverberations-of its "re-entries," as Gerald Edelman calls them in his Neural Darwinism (1987)-the human brain has achieved an unparalleled complexity. In fact, the human brain is so complex that its owner seems indeed the only living creature able to philosophize on notions of progress or to ask questions about infinity. Georges Lemaitre, physicist, Catholic priest and inventor of the idea of the big bang, was in the habit of using this excellent definition of infinity: "a system is infinite when it is equal to one of its parts, equality being comprised of two systems that can be placed in a two-sided, one-to-one relationship" (see e.g. Lemaitre, 36). For example, infinity is a straight line prolonged indefinitely, each unlimited segment of which is comparable to the entire line. Eternity is time that flows without end, whose each instant precedes and follows other instants, and where nonetheless everything is given, everything is frozen, as in a single instant. Infinity is the country in which every part is identical to the whole. This definition helps us to understand the rapport between complexity and infinity. The human brain inhabited by thought is not homeomorphous to its sub-levels, such as the cerebral activity of this or that part of the frontal cortex or the thalamus. Thanks to its multiple levels and the exceptional quality of its SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="16">54 R6my Lestienne circuitry, it is certainly an extremely complicated system. Much of its internal organization and its functioning reposes on chance, and its level of integration as well as its numerous reverberant circuits make it a gigantic reservoir of information. But it is not infinitely complicated. An infinitely complicated system would be one in which the interactions between levels would be so rich that each level, independent of the others, could be taken as a definition of the whole. In developing the interactions between each level and the whole system, life has never ceased tending toward this impossible horizon. Conclusion This Pascalian tour has taken us from the microscopic singularity of bacteria, the smallest units that we can truly call "living"-that is, individually autonomous-all the way to the horizon of infinite complexity, of which the human brain is a quite imperfect image. It is time to sum up. It seems quite paradoxical to affirm that chance is the sole motor of evolution and then to apply the notion of progress to the latter. In fact, studies of living organisms teach us that the chance that is incarnate in life is by no means a synonym for the absurd. Associated with mechanisms of natural selection, the play of variations propels living systems from one threshold to the next, from intigron to integron, toward growing complexity, of which we, as humans, are the beneficiaries. Evolution is the new name for Creation, and we need to understand that in it, chance and direction/ meaning are reconciled, not abruptly, but in an extremely subtle way. In his master-work, La Logique du vivant (1970), Francois Jacob already expressed a similar position. He wrote: Everyone concurs in seeing a direction in evolution. Despite errors, dead- ends, and hesitations, a certain path has been traveled during the past two million years. But it is hard to describe the orientation that natural selection has imprinted on chance. The words progress, progression, perfectionment, do not do it justice. They evoke too much regularity, design, anthropomorphism. The criteria for it are not defined. If it is adaptation for survival, the colibacillus seems as well adapted to its milieu as man is to his [...] What perhaps best characterizes evolution is its tendency toward adaptability in the execution of the genetic program, its "openness" in a direction that allows the organism to always increase its relations with its milieu and to thereby extend its sphere of action [...] In order for the organism to become differentiated, to gain autonomy, to extend its SubStance # 91, 2000</page><page sequence="17">Chance, Progress and Complexity in Evolution 55 exchanges with the environment, there must be a development not only of the structures that link the organism to its milieu, but also interactions that coordinate the constituents of the organism. (329) Even if Jacob explicitly repudiated the idea that life is oriented toward increasing complexity, it seems to me that the development of modern notions of complexity show us that it was toward this end that the thought of this eminent biologist tended.
