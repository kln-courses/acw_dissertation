Not only did he believe that  the repudiation oath was expiable like other oaths, and need not re­ sult in actual dissolution of marriage, but he had begun asserting that  Triple Repudiation was not only innovative (bid'i) but legally invalid.  When asked to retract his positions in order to return to teaching, he  famously said, “I cannot conceal knowledge.”1 When Henri Laoust con­ sidered Ibn Taymiyya’s stances on dissolution of marriage, he found  the scholar to have been acting out of a concern for the stability of the  family and the right of a wife to social justice. Laoust stated: “This last  point would appear, in the doctrine of Ibn Taymiyya, to be a discreet  feminism of which one easily finds other examples, and which neces­ sarily reaches, in the opinion of Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, a frank justifi­ cation for monogamy for reasons of social justice.”2 1 Caterina Bori, “A New Source for th e  Biography of Ibn  Taymiyya,” Bulletin o f the School o f Oriental and Afri­ can Studies 67, no. 3 (2004): 346. 2 H enri Laoust, “Une Risala d’Ibn Taymiya sur le serm ent de repudiation,” Bulletin des Etudes Orientales, vol.  7-8 (Cairo: Im prim erie de L’Institu t Francais, 1937-1938): 217.

Much of its complexity stems from the vast  amount of confusion and lack of resolution on various facets of the  definition and implementation of divorce. As a matter of brief review,  it is useful to include here a brief reference to some of the more potent  terminology relating to this topic in order to better contextualize the  discussion at hand, keeping in mind that the nuances of the terms are  themselves subjects of ongoing debates:3 Taläq: Unilateral repudiation by the husband of his wife. Discussed  in the Qur’an most prominently in verses 2:228-232 and 65:1-6, this  form of divorce is husband-initiated, as is the ability to revoke the di­ vorce and return to married life. Jurists understood the “Sunnaic Re­ pudiation” as being implemented when a woman was not menstruat­ ing and extending over a designated waiting period ('idda), typically  three months or three menstrual cycles.4 Here, the possible second  and third repudiations may occur only after a man has ended the first  instance by returning his wife during her waiting period or remarry­ ing her with a new contract after the expiration of her waiting period.5 Taläq al-bid'a: Innovative or sinful repudiation. This is the repudiation  that does not take place according to the assumed model of three men­ strual periods with a possibility of revocation. For most classical schol­ ars, its “sinfulness” does not make it less legally valid; Ibn Taymiyya,  however, began giving fatwas to the contrary, stating that this form of  repudiation was not valid.6 Triple repudiation in a single utterance falls  into this category. Additionally, repudiating a woman during her men­ strual period also falls into this category. Some systems penalize this  form of marriage dissolution in theory while permitting it to continue  in practice.7 3 For inform ation on  m odern  implications o f divorce laws for M uslim  wom en, see W om en Living U nder  M uslim  Laws (WLUML), International Solidarity Network, Knowing Our Rights: Women, Family, Laws and Cus­ toms in the Muslim World (New Delhi: Zubaan, 2003), 255-300. 4 There is ongoing debate as to  w hether th e  end o f the th ird  m enstrual period  o r its beginning serves to  de­ lineate the end of the waiting period. See Majmü‘a Fatäwa Shaykh al-Isläm Ibn Taymiyya, ed. ‘Abd al-Rahmän ibn  Q äsim  al-‘ÄsimI (Riyadh and Beirut: M atäbi' D ar al-‘Arabiyya, 1977), 33:11.

Im prisonm ent and th e  Divorce Fatwäs Khul : Dissolution of the marriage, usually for a designated price (such  as return of the mahr). This is also referred to as woman-initiated di-  vorce.8 The waiting period for this form of marriage dissolution is one  menstrual cycle.9 Despite being classified as an “innovative" or “sinful" form of repudia­ tion, the Triple Repudiation was, historically, and remains today, a ma­ jor issue in many Muslim legal systems.10 The modern era has seen  numerous reforms across these legal systems: in the early twentieth  century, countries like Egypt,11 Iraq and Jordan began considering tri­ ple pronouncements of divorce in one sitting to be the equivalent of  one incidence of divorce. Yet in countries like Sri Lanka, Triple Re­ pudiation is practiced with great frequency: “This prevalence is influ­ enced by the widely held misperception that a triple talaq absolves the  husband of his obligation to provide maintenance during the i dda pe­ riod.”12 In 2004, India was only just preparing to address the issue of  Triple Talaq, indeed with major trepidation out of fear of Sunni reac­ tion to its abolishment.13 Meanwhile, the fact that Triple Repudiation  is an issue that is viewed as legally “unresolved”14 indicates that it has  persisted in the socio-legal consciousness of Muslim populations well  into the modern era. Those who take strong stances against it often do  so by suggesting that it was a relic from the pre-Islamic era that came  back into practice due to the Ḥanafi concern with the validity of mere  utterances.15 The debate itself has heavy legal implications for the role  of intentionality in law. The continued existence of disagreement over Triple Ṭalāq could  well be linked to the stances of Ibn Taymiyya, for at a pivotal moment 8 See also Majmü'a, 273-277; R apoport also refers to  th is as “consensual divorce," 198. 9 See Majmü'a, 33:10.

This position of questioning scholarly consensus  earned him scorn and two sojourns in prison. The concern of this pa­ per is with the concept of Triple Repudiation (or Triple Talaq) as dis­ cussed by Ibn Taymiyya. We inquire as to exactly what his position  was, why it was problematic in the fourteenth century, and wheth­ er his position could have been viewed as championing the rights of  women, as has been suggested by Henry Laoust.16 I b n  T a y m i y y a   a n d  T r i p l e  R e p u d i a t i o n Yossef Rapoport frames his analysis of Ibn Taymiyya’s stances in discus­ sions of the value of oath-taking in medieval society, for the first phases  of Ibn Taymiyya’s position had to do with devaluing or lessening the  legal impact of oaths of repudiation intended to affirm the intention  of undertaking or not undertaking an action. The fourteenth centu­ ry was a time in which such oaths had taken on such intense sanctity  that they were being used in legal proceedings.17 Such seriousness sur­ rounding the utterance of the divorce oath reflected its place in the  social consciousness. Oaths and their results had led to innumerable  unintended dissolutions of marriage. These, in turn, had led to the  growth of legal sleights of hand (ḥiyal) designed to circumvent the dis­ solution or restore the marriage, such as the Shäfi'ī doctrine of khul' 15 See, for example, Engineer, “Abolishing Triple Talaq,” 3093. W ith regard to  the y an afi position, it is usually  presented as being based on  the report (som etim es presented as a Prophetic hadith) tha t “[s]eriousness and jok­ ing are equal in  m arriage [proposals] just as seriousness and joking are equal in  [utterances of] divorce.” For this  see al-Shaybäni’s Hujja (ald ahl al-Madina, ed. al-Sayyid M ahdi y a san  al-Kiläni (Beirut: ‘Ä lam  al-Kutub, 2006),  2:74, and Kecia Ali, Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2010), 29-30.  The m atter o f divorce oaths taking effect, no m atter how absurd, is also presented anecdotally in  the Musannafs  of ‘Abd al-Razzäq and Ibn  A bi Shayba, a lthough num erous counter opinions are reported  suggesting th a t such  oaths do no t take effect; as the Musannafs represent some of th e  earliest legal literature, it is possible to  see just  how long these debates have endured. 16 See Laoust, “Une Risala.” 17 Ibid, 198-199. 18 This legal device allows a m an  and w om an to  agree on  consensual divorce (k h u l) before the husband in­ tentionally violates the divorce oath he has taken. As the two are divorced w hen the oath-violation takes place,  the oath  is m oot, and there can be an  im m ediate remarriage. For Shäfi'is, w ho consider k h u l to  be divorce and  no tfaskh  (annulm ent), th is  device could only be used twice, however, before the Triple Talaq issue sets in  (see  R apoport, 198 and 198, fn. 21, and also Majmü'a, 33:64). 184 </page> <page sequence="5"> Ibn Taymiyya’s Fem inism? Im prisonm ent and th e  Divorce Fatwas al-yaminls or the tahlil marriage.19 More than anything, we are told, Ibn  Taymiyya’s primary intention was to eliminate the necessity for tahlil  marriages, as these had proliferated to alarming levels in his era.20 Ibn Taymiyya points out that oaths for all other issues—such as an  oath on pain of pilgrimage or giving charity—were expiable in some  way.21 Thus it was natural to him,22 although it did not seem so natural  to any other scholar of his time or preceding him, that there must be a  way out of the oath of repudiation as well. The source of conflict with  the legal establishment, then, lay in the fact that his decision lacked  precedent and appeared to go against what was at least a tacit scholarly  consensus. Oath-taking was but a subsidiary issue to the larger issue of  speaking the repudiation formula and the extent of its implications;  above all, what was the role of intention in law? Like jurists before him, Ibn Taymiyya finds that Triple Repudiation  falls into the category of bid'i or innovative (and hence sinful) disso­ lution of marriage. Unlike them, however, he began ruling such re­ pudiations invalid. There are four types of this repudiation: the tri­ ple repudiation in one utterance; successive repudiation (mutatäbi': all  three repudiations in one sitting—f  majlis wähid); repudiation in sev­ eral sittings but during one purity period; and the triple repudiation  in which there are three periods of purity without any intermediary  period of return. All of these, according to Ibn Taymiyya, are consid­ ered haräm. With regard to the Triple Taläq delivered in one utterance, Ibn  Taymiyya notes that there are three opinions on it. First there is that  of al-Shafi‘I, for whom bid’a is limited to a repudiation that takes place  during a menstrual cycle or in a period of purity in which there has  been intercourse. Thus one utterance of three repudiations is, for al-  Shafi‘I, valid and without sin.23 19 A marriage contracted for the sole purpose o f legalizing remarriage betw een an  irrevocably divorced couple. 20 R apoport, 205. 21 See Majmfra, 33:74-75 and Q 5:89. 22 See especially Majmü'a, 33:60: “The basic [premise] in  this is tha t th e  in ten t o f the speaker m ust be investi­ gated . . . ” 23 Of interest, however, is al-ShafiTs phraseology in  Kitäb al-Umm in  which he says tha t trip ly  divorcing the  wife in  an  unconsum m ated m arriage in  one utterance is redundant in  tha t the first utterance renders her no  longer m arried, “and repudiation cannot take effect up o n  someone who is no t [technically] th e  wife” (6:469).  The difference betw een consum m ated and unconsum m ated marriages is the necessity o f Hdda for the former.  Thus, for al-Shafi‘I, the  single divorcing utterance itself cannot complete th e  act of divorce from  a consum m ated  marriage, while th ree sim ultaneously can. 185 </page> <page sequence="6"> Carolyn Baugh For Mälik, Abü Hanifa and Ahmad ibn Hanbal (in a later opinion  supported by his followers and modeled on a group of the salaf), it is a  forbidden repudiation (i.e., its result is sin) yet that which the divorc­ ing man intends and utters necessarily takes place. The third opinion,24 Ibn Taymiyya tells us, is that it is forbidden  and its legal result is only one repudiation. “This opinion is transmit­ ted from a group of the salaf from among the Companions of God’s  Messenger.”25 He cites al-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwäm, ‘AH, Ibn Mas‘üd,  ‘Abd al-Rahmän ibn al-Zubayr, and Ibn ‘Abbäs, among others. In­ terestingly, Ibn Taymiyya also cites this opinion as being held by the  Zähiris and the Shi‘a; he names Muhammad al-Bäqir and his son  Ja‘far al-Sädiq. In support of the third opinion, Ibn Taymiyya adduces both the  Qur’an and Sunna and well as jurisprudential analogies and [case-  based] considerations (i 'ti'bār).26 Of these, the first two provide the  most important source of information for this discussion. He says: Every repudiation legitimized by God in the Qur’an for the wife in a consum­ mated marriage is a revocable repudiation (al-talüq al-ra'l). God did not allow  anyone to repudiate three times simultaneously nor did He make it legal for  the wife in a consummated marriage to be irrevocably repudiated. However,  if he repudiates her before consummation she is no longer licit for him (banat  minhu), and if her 'idda is expired, she is no longer licit for him.27 Qur’anic support for the third opinion is found in the verse: Repudiation is twice then retention as according to proper custom (imsak bi-  ma'rüf) or letting go in a pleasant manner (tasrih bi-ihsön).2S Thus, repudiation does not happen all at once (dufa wahida) but time  after time, or repetitively.29 Ibn Taymiyya also relies on Qur’anic indi­ cators by pointing to God’s words concerning procedures after a repu­ diation has taken place. 24 There is an  additional opin ion on the subject, tha t of “some of the  M u ‘tazila and Shia," b u t it is an  opin ion  th a t he believes lacks precedent: tha t there  is no  valid legal im plication for a single utterance o f Triple Repudia­ tio n  (33:9). 25 Majmü'a, 33:8. 26 See Majmü'a, 33:81. W ith hesitance, I have translated th is  te rm  (i'tibar) as “[case-based] considerations," bu t  it m ay well be translated as “context." It begs in-depth research on  Ibn  Taymiyya’s use o f this e lem ent in  hisfiqh.  See also 33:63, 33:91 and 33:93 for o ther m entions o f i'tibar. 33:63 deems it “the best and highest form  o f anal­ ogy (qiyüs)," while 33:91 seems to  clearly indicate tha t the m eaning is “context." 27 Majmü'a, 33:9. 186 </page> <page sequence="7"> Ibn Taymiyya’s Fem inism?

One such report relates that Rukäna Ibn  ‘Abd Yazid repudiated his wife thrice in one sitting, then went to the  Prophet who assured him that the three were equivalent to but one,  and that he could return her.33 Most supportive of his position is the report delivered through  Täwüs from Ibn ‘Abbäs. It was evident that ‘Umar felt the Muslims  to be divorcing their wives with impunity, and deemed it necessary to  rein in the tossing about of utterances of repudiation. At the time of God’s Messenger and Abü Bakr, and two years into the Cali­ phate of ‘Umar, Triple Repudiation was equal to (but) one.34 Then ‘Umar said,  “People are rushing in a situation in which they had previously been patient  (or, perhaps, reticent). So if we make [its consequences] more serious for them,  they will not engage in it.”35 Thus, posits Ibn Taymiyya, it was ‘Umar’s decision, and not that of  the early community, that caused Triple Talaq to attain such weight  and result in the actual three instances of repudiation instead of only  one.36 Whereas the situation at the time (that of carelessness in hurling 28 Q 2:228. 29 Abü Zahra, 420. 30 Q 65:2-3. 31 Q 65:1. 32 Abü Zahra, 420. 33 Majmü'a, 33:13, and see also 73.

Above all, Ibn Taymiyya maintains that the tahlil marriage  was prohibited at the time of the Prophet and his Companions.38 Where Mamlük scholars cried foul was Ibn Taymiyya’s assertion  that, because the ruling was ‘Umar’s, there had been no initial consen­ sus on the subject. Q u e s t i o n i n g  C o n s e n s u s : A n a l y s i s  o f  I b n  T a y m i y y a ’s  S t a n c es Of the several issues that landed Ibn Taymiyya in jail, Triple Taläq is  perhaps the least abstract. The other issues pertained wholly to creed,  the discourse surrounding God’s features (al-sifät) and various charges  of anthropomorphism, as well as the issue of the visiting of graves.39  On this very issue of divorce, which appears to be much more legal  than theological, Ibn Taymiyya declared the “oath of repudiation”40 to 37 For m ore inform ation on Ibn Taymiyya’s position  on  tahlil marriages see 33:92-93. The tahlil m arriage is  the m arriage in  which a triply-repudiated w om an, who cannot rem arry her husband unless she has consum­ m ated and ended a m arriage w ith ano ther in  the interim , m arries solely for th is purpose, so th a t she m ight re­ tu rn  to  her original spouse. As early as the Musannaf o f ‘Abd al-Razzaq, legal devices were sought to  am eliorate  these circumstances, and it is asked w hether or no t a boy who can achieve erection b u t no t ejaculation m ight  serve in  the role o f muhallil, o r w hether he m ust have reached the  age o f ejaculation to  do so. See ‘Abd al-Razzaq  ibn  H am m am  ibn  N afi‘, Musannaf (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyya, 2000), 6:275, 11189-11190 and 11191. It is  Ibn  Taymiyya’s position  tha t the legal subterfuge o f m arrying for the intent o f rapid divorce is w hat is illicit, not  the m arriage itself. He denounces th is legal device w ith reports saying tha t those who engage in  it are cursed,  and claiming th a t“it was absolutely never related tha t in  [the] era [of the Prophet and his Com panions] a wom ­ an  was returned to  her husband after the th ird  divorce via a tahlil marriage.” 38 See also the Prophetic hadith in  which the wife o f Rifa'a al-QurazI, who had recently m arried a new spouse  after her th ird  divorce, is asking the Prophet if she can be divorced yet, and the Prophet rem inds her tha t she  m ust have sexual intercourse (“lä, hattä tadhüqi 'usaylatahu wa yadhüqa 'usaylataki”) w ith her new husband be­ fore divorcing h im  (for it to  be deem ed a valid marriage). This hadith  is found in  Bukhari, 2496; M uslim , 1433;  T irm idhl, 1118; al-Nasa’I, 3409; and also Ibn  Taymiyya’s student Ibn  Qayyim al-Jawziyya in  r lä m  al-Muwaqqi'in  (Beirut: al-M aktaba al-‘Asriyya, 2007), 4:252. Ibn  al-Qayyim advances the opin ion tha t the purpose for th is  prac­ tice was th a t a w om an should be considered haram  for her triply-divorcing husband u n til she m arries another  “as a pun ishm ent for him ,” for having repudiated her. See al-I(läm, 2:54.

Im prisonm ent and th e  Divorce Fatwäs be expiable because Triple Talaq was itself contrary to the intent of Is­ lamic law regarding repudiation. Is it remarkable that this scholar should submit to terms of prison  rather than retracting his stance on what could be considered an issue  whose affected population is largely women? Donald Little’s article  gives us a deep sense of what he refers to as state assessments as to the  dangers of Ibn Taymiyya’s beliefs: From the point of view of the head of state and his religious advisors, the prop­ agation of certain theological beliefs jeopardized the salvation of individual  Muslims and the stability of the state, so that the sultan [al-Malik al-Näsir, r.  693-741/1293-1341] as defender of the state took appropriate action.41 Little asserts that Ibn Taymiyya’s divorce stance was no less threaten­ ing than his theological stances. But what did jurists perceive as dan­ gerous with regard to the way in which a woman is repudiated? What Laoust refers to as Ibn Taymiyya’s resistance to the formal­ ism of traditionalfiqh42 was, for the scholarly establishment of his time,  highly problematic. The practical danger of Ibn Taymiyya’s stance was,  as his refuter Taqi al-Din al-Subki pointed out, if a man had repudiat­ ed his wife triply, and yet was made to understand that an utterance of  Triple Talaq was equal to but one repudiation, he might continue to  cohabit and even to beget children with his wife, mistakenly thinking  himself still married to her.43 Their children, then, would technically  be bastards. Ibn Taymiyya’s position was thus portrayed as dangerous  to the larger Muslim community. Further, there can be little doubt that the scholarly establishment,  allied as it was with the military establishment in the Mamlük era,  simply could not tolerate an opinion that lay contrary to a claimed  consensus.44 But what was the consensus on the subject? Al-Subki cites  such scholars as Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (d. 463/1070). A brief look at Ibn  ‘Abd al-Barr’s thoughts reveals that he takes the following position: al­ though a single utterance of the formula for triple repudiation is sin­ ful, it is still entirely valid. He contends that “there is no difference of 40 R apoport’s essay gives careful delineation of how repudiation  oaths, which were deem ed conditional di­ vorce, differed from  other sorts o f oaths o r vows.

Further,  that Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr begins his chapter on Talaq with an in-depth dis­ cussion of Triple Repudiation in one utterance is in itself indicative of  the salient nature of the subject in his time. But it is possible to question Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr’s consensus claim by  looking into earlier sources such as Ibn al-Mundhir (d. 318/930), the  most famous of the early writers to address consensus. Each of Ibn al-  Mundhir’s chapters on divorce is focused on highlighting discussions  of intentionality. For one example: The scholars differ over the man who says to his wife, “You are repudiated,"  and he means thrice (wa huwaya'nwi thalath). A group says, “It is but one [in­ stance], and he has more right to her [than herself, i.e. the right to return her]."  This is the statement of al-Hasan [al-Basri], ‘Amr ibn Dinar, and [Sufyän] al-  Thawri, al-Awzä‘i, Ahmad [ibn Hanbal], Abü Thawr, and the Hanafis. Others have said, “If he means three, it is three," and this is the opinion of  Mälik, al-Shäfi‘i, Isfräq and Abü ‘Ubayd. And we say this as well, based on the  saying of the Prophet, “Works are intentional (al-a'mal bi-l-niyya)."46 This same concern with intentionality extends to utterance of the tri­ ple repudiation formula itself: 44 Abü Zahra also insists tha t Ibn  Taymiyya’s positions regarding Triple Talaq ran  counter to  consensus. It is  sym ptom atic o f consensus discussions to  find th a t later scholars simplify and obfuscate early discussions o f con­ sensus.

Färüq H am m äda  (Damascus: D är al-Qalam, 2003), 3:1257-1258, we find tha t Ibn  al-M undhir al-Naysäbüri’s (d. 318/930) consen­ sus statem ent on  th is  m atter is given as centering on  the usual Hanafi p ro o f text (cited in  a different version  in  fn. 14 above): “There are th ree m atters abou t which seriousness is considered serious and joking is [equally]  considered to  be serious: marriage, repudiation and the reinstatem ent (of a repudiated woman)." See Ibn  al-  M undhir’s al-Ishrüf', 1:173. The actual text in  the Ishraf varies slightly at several poin ts from  th a t given in  al-  I q m \  perhaps significant only in  the arrangem ent of m atters (repudiation is listed first). A lthough the idea of  the joking divorce being a valid divorce is posited by  Ibn al-M undhir as al-Shäfi‘i ’s opin ion (am ong others), to   ou r knowledge, th e  first m ajor exposition o f th is  report occurs in  al-Shaybäni’s Hujja (as in  fn. 14 above). As we  shall see, above, the discussions in  al-Ishraf are for m ore nuanced th a n  al-Subki o r Abü Zahra imply, and the role  of in ten tion  is preem inent. 45 Abü ‘U m ar Yüsuf ibn  ‘Abd A lläh Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, Kitab al-Istidhka  (Beirut: D är al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyya,  2006), 6:3. “This is passed dow n from  th e  m ajority  o f the righteous forebears, and the difference over it is iso­ lated, [the sort tha t] only  innovators would adopt, or the sort o f person to  w hom  no one w ould tu rn  due to  the  isolated nature  o f his opin ion from  the  majority, and using such an  opin ion is impermissible due to  it being a  distortion  o f th e  Book and th e  Sunna." 46 Al-Ishraf, 1:144-145. 190 </page> <page sequence="11"> Ibn Taymiyya’s Fem inism? Im prisonm ent and th e  Divorce Fatwas They differ over the man who says to his wife with whom he has consum­ mated marriage, “You are repudiated, you are repudiated, you are repudiat­ ed.”47 A group has said, “If he meant just one [repudiation], the first [utterance  served as valid] and it is one [instance]. If he meant to initiate [a repudiation]  after that first [instance] it is as he intended. If he meant by his third utter­ ance to [merely] clarify the second [instance] (in aräda bi-l-thälitha tabayyun  al-thäniya), then the amount of repudiations is two. And if he intended three  repudiations then it is thrice. If he dies before being asked his intention, then  [the repudiation stands as] three. This is the opinion of al-Shafi‘I.48 Thus, it is clear that concern with verbal expression versus inner in­ tention is not a foreign construct that Ibn Taymiyya was ushering into  discussion of dissolution of marriage for the first time in Islamic juris­ prudential history, as al-Subki accused. Al-Subki’s citation of a consen­ sus on the subject emerged from a consultation of sources, such as Ibn  ‘Abd al-Barr, which stood rather later than these early discussions. It is possible that Ibn Taymiyya was referring to just such sources  as Ibn al-Mundhir and the scholars before him when he defended his  position on repudiation by saying, “I cannot suppress my knowledge.”  Laoust speaks of Ibn Taymiyya’s insistence on bringing “intention”  into the discussion, not just in the realm of ‘ibädät as was en vogue in  his era, but to all realms, even that of divorce.49 It was based upon just  this reason (the role of niyya) that Ibn Taymiyya formulated his strong  opinions against the concept of forced marriage.50 F o r c e d  M a r r i a g e   a n d  t h e  H o s t a g e  M o t i f It is useful, in inquiring into Ibn Taymiyya’s motivations for his noto­ rious stances on oaths of repudiation and by extension Triple Taläq  generally, to consider a wider framework for his positions. Through­ 47 N ote a sim ilar discussion in  the small chapter on  the utterance, “You are repudiated absolutely (al-batta)”;  Ibn  al-M undhir offers several opinions, th e  first being tha t it is a single instance allowing reinstatem ent (Malik,  ‘U m ar ibn  al-Khattab), and another, offered by al-Shafi‘i, th a t if one was m eant, th en  one occurred, while if  three were m eant, th en  three occurred. Fu rther opinions emphasize the  im portance o f in ten tion  (al-Ishräf,  147-148). 48 Ibid, 144. 49 Laoust, 217. 50 Ibid, 218. 191 </page> <page sequence="12"> Carolyn Baugh out Ibn Taymiyya’s discussions of marriage and the marriage bond, he  uses the vocabulary of captivity, referring to a woman as becoming the  asira, the captive or hostage of the husband.51 Forced marriage in par­ ticular causes Ibn Taymiyya to take on a tone that sounds something  akin to outrage.52 With regard to contracting marriage for her against her will: This is against  the fundamentals [of the religion] and against reason (mukhalif li-l-uül wa-l-  'uqül). God did not intend for her guardian to force her to sell or buy except  with her permission, or [force her] to eat, drink, or wear that which she does  not desire. So how could [her guardian] force her to have intercourse and live  with someone she despises sleeping with and living with? God has created be­ tween spouses love and mercy (mawadda wa-rahma). If [the marriage] can only  occur despite her hatred of it and desire to flee from it, what love and mercy  can there be therein?53 What is most intriguing here for our purposes is the point about the  practice of repudiation that he brings into the discussion of forced  marriage. The typical pre-Talaq scenario is one of mediation involv­ ing a member of each respective family. He points out that each wali  (and he insists that the wali, appointed by each spouse, is the most cor­ rect term in this instance), has the power to initiate actual dissolution  proceedings. What is particularly potent in these points is the equality that Ibn  Taymiyya posits between the spouses’ positions during mediation. The Lawgiver does not force a woman to marry if she does not want to do so.  Indeed, if she were to hate the husband, and a split occurs, [the Lawgiver] caus­ es her affairs to fall into the hand of other than the husband, one of her family  who prioritizes [her] well-being [maslafrah], along with someone who seeks his  well-being from his own family. [In this way, the Lawgiver] ends her involve­ ment (yukhallisuha) with the husband without his authority, so how could she  become his hostage (kayf tu’sir ma'hu) forever without her authority?54 51 The root a-s-r and its derivatives refer principally to  tying, b ind ing and taking captive, deriving, Lane tells  us, from  the  isar, o r leather thong used for binding. From  th is roo t there  is the commonly-used w ord “usra,”  m eaning family. It is clear, however, th a t Ibn  Taymiyya is intending to  denote the female captive, particularly  w hen it comes to  his discussion o f k h u l in  which he speaks o f self-ransom. 52 Ibn Taymiyya, Fatawa al-nisa’, ed. Sa‘d Yüsuf Abü ‘Aziz (Cairo: D är al-Fajr li-l-Turäth, 1999), 199-203. 53 Majmfra, 32:25. 54 Fatawa al-Nisa’, 203. 192 </page> <page sequence="13"> Ibn Taymiyya’s Fem inism? Im prisonm ent and th e  Divorce Fatwas The hostage motif takes on another dimension, however, when Ibn  Taymiyya discusses a woman’s responsibilities once within the mar­ riage bond. From discussing the inability of a woman to fast or pray  throughout the night without her husband’s permission, he declares  the absolute obligation (fard) of a woman to submit to her husband’s  demands for sexual intercourse. “How could a believing woman pri­ oritize a voluntary action [i.e. supererogatory prayer throughout the  night] over an obligation?”55 Obedience56 is total sexual obedience,  and the absence of that obedience is the essence of the definition of  nushüz57 that makes allowable beating (dhälika yubih lahu darbuhä).58  Thus while there is concern in one fatwa for a woman’s not entering  involuntarily into the state of being “hostage,” once there, her sexual  obligations define her relationship to her husband. Further, Ibn Taymiyya is clear that the husband’s rights are next  in line after those of God and the Prophet. He quotes the following  hadith:59 “If I could order anyone to bow to anyone I would order a  woman to bow down to her husband, due to the magnitude of his  rights over her.” Ibn Taymiyya is deeply concerned with consent when it comes to  the contracting of the marriage. Once within the marriage, however,  the preeminence of the husband’s rights over those of the woman ob­ viates her consent to intercourse. By entering into the marriage con­ tract her consent to making herself sexually available is deemed im­ plicit. She is still very much the hostage. The assumption is, perhaps,  that this captivity is voluntary, with understood parameters of behav­ ior; it would seem that Ibn Taymiyya’s views on divorce uphold this  notion of voluntary captivity. And yet the hostage is capable of being ransomed. When Ibn Taymi­ yya discusses the issue of khul% it is in the following way: 55 Fatäwä al-Nisä\ 212. 56 Ibn  Taymiyya here defines qänita (from  Q 4:34) as m eaning obedience to  the husband. Q ur’anic herm eneu­ tics w ould seem  to  indicate that, based on  its o ther occurrences (Q 39:9, 16:120, 33:35, 66:5, 2:116, 30:26, 2:238,  3:17, 66:12) qänit has m uch m ore to  do w ith  “obedience to  God.” 57 Q 4:34. 58 Fatäwä al-n isä\213. 59 The editor o f Fatäwä al-Nisä’ (Sa‘d Yüsuf Abü ‘Aziz) designates this hadith as sahih. I found it in  #1159 and  #1160 o f Tirm idhi, b o th  entries designated as “hasan gha-nb, a far lesser level o f authenticity. 60 Fatäwä al-Nisä’, 214. 193 </page> <page sequence="14"> Carolyn Baugh Khul as described in the Qur’an and the Sunna is when a woman hates her  husband and wants to leave him, so she gives him her dower, or part of it, as a  ransom for herself just as the hostage is ransomed.60 Thus, the difference between talaq and khul' would seem to be an as­ sumption that the woman is an unwilling participant in the former  and an active instigator of the latter. Ibn Taymiyya assumes the repu­ diated woman, as a willing captive in her marriage, would find the  waiting period in a typical “Sunnaic repudiation" useful, for it is the  period in which the repudiating man reflects on his choice and pre­ sumably regrets it enough to bring the wife back to her previous sta­ tus. As we have seen, Ibn Taymiyya evidences a deep concern with the  intentionality of human actions within law. But he is also deeply con­ cerned with Divine Intention. For this reason, it would seem clear that  Ibn Taymiyya believes Triple Talaq cannot but obstruct the Divine In­ tention of allowing a man to reconcile with his wife, as the ‘idda wait­ ing period is designed to do.61 C o n c l u s i o n With Rapoport, I would hesitate to cast Ibn Taymiyya as a feminist. With Laoust, though, I believe that Ibn Taymiyya arrived at two in­ escapable conclusions when considering law pertaining to dissolution  of marriage in the fourteenth century. The first conclusion is that oaths of repudiation not intended to  actualize a dissolution of marriage must be evaluated, like all actions  of a believer, based on the intention behind them. The second is that  there are checks and balances inherent in the structure of unilateral  repudiation designed to protect, to some extent, the rights of women  and to force upon men a realization of a woman’s worth. Triple Talaq  subverts these. 61 Ibn al-Qayyim gives a lengthy exposition on  the topic o f Hdda in  Flam al-muwaqqi(in. In  it, he is concerned  w ith the “wisdom" beh ind  the verses and rulings; as such he is keen to  explain tha t the waiting period for di­ vorce and death is not designed simply to  make sure tha t there  is a lack o f pregnancy. This is one o f the reasons,  he says, b u t n o t the only reason. O ther reasons include: understanding th e  full significance o f the m arriage con­ tract (ta'zim khatr hadha al-(aqd); lengthening the tim e period in  which a divorcing husband m ay re tu rn  his wife  (tatwil zaman al-rafa)— such th a t he m ight regret his action; and the allowance for the  rights o f the wife to  be  secure, w ith regard to  her residence and m aintenance (i.e. to  prevent her from  being unfairly and hastily ejected  from  her hom e) (2:55). 194 </page> <page sequence="15"> Ibn Taymiyya’s Fem inism? Im prisonm ent and th e  Divorce Fatwäs Ibn Taymiyya “could not suppress [his] knowledge” of correct ac­ tion with regard to divorce oaths, a particular subset of practices of  “innovative repudiation,” in which the allotted time for reinstatement  was omitted, and he worked to apply careful consideration of intent to  the realm of practical law. Says Laoust: “It is as a moralist and a jurist  that Ibn Taymiyya takes a stand against these practices [of tahlil and tri­ ple repudiation in one utterance]. On the one hand, the abuse of repu­ diation is the consequence which undermined the solidity of the fam­ ily institution, and, on the other, the misunderstandings regarding the  rights of women to be treated justly.” Still, Ibn Taymiyya’s vocabulary on the topic of marriage depicts  a scenario played out by a hostage and her captor. This state of affairs  remains a tangible reality for many women married under legal sys­ tems purporting to be Islamic. The right to self-ransom (Ibn Taymi-  yya’s analogy for khul') is still a right that remains difficult to negotiate  for many women in Muslim legal systems, due to their ignorance of  that right, the system’s refusal to allow it, or due to financial considera­ tions preventing access to enough “ransom money”62 That the issue of Triple Talaq still haunts the Islamic legal sphere  proves that it remains unresolved. Retaining full rights upon repudia­ tion and attaining direct access to divorce continue to be issues that  are confusing and difficult for Muslim women to negotiate. The prob­ lem is commonly one of perception: often legal options are unknown  and cultural considerations overwhelm the dynamics of dissolution.  The woman who is uneducated as to the scope and extent of her rights 62 It is generally agreed by wom en’s rights advocates tha t Talaq tajwid, “delegated divorce,” w herein a m an  designates an  agent (here, ideally the w om an herself) to  enact the divorce, is m ore beneficial to  the w om an  th a n  the khul' form  tha t typically dem ands an  abdication of financial rights. See WLUML, 267-271. Both uncon­ ditional and conditional (based on  stipulations in  a m arriage contract) talaq tafwid exist, depending on  the legal  system. For m ore on  th is subject see Lucy Caroll, “Talaq-i-Tafwid and Stipulations in  a M uslim  M arriage Con­ tract: Im portan t M eans o f Protecting the Position o f th e  South Asian M uslim  Wife,” Modern Asian Studies 16,  no. 2 (1982): 277-309. In  some systems, this form  o f divorce is called Hsma. The vocabulary essential to  th is sort  o f divorce is th a t the wife m ust no t declare to  the husband: “You are divorced,” b u t rather, “I am  divorced from   you”; utterance is again key to  the process. For a useful comparative discussion across th e  legal schools see ‘Abd  al-Rahm än al-Jaziri, Kitab al-fiqh (ala al-madhahib al-arba(a, ed. M uham m ad Bakr Ism ä‘il (Cairo: Där al-Manär,  1999), 304-317. N ote tha t although all the  schools allow for this form  of divorce, the com piler begins his chap­ te r  by  insisting th a t the pow er o f divorce should no t be entrusted to  a wom an due to  her “natural volatility”  (sari'a al-ta’aththur) and inability to  exercise the patience inheren t in  m en (304). “If divorce were in  her hands, it  would be used in  the worst way for she cannot control herself as a m an can” (la tastati dabt nafsiha kama yastati  al-rajul) (304-305). N ote tha t the cause for Ibn  Taymiyya’s position on divorce oaths was th e  societal p henom ­ enon  o f m en  divorcing the ir wives irrevocably in  a fit o f anger, later regretted only after the damage to  the m ar­ riage was done. 195 </page> <page sequence="16"> Carolyn Baugh has little recourse against the perception, often reinforced by her com­ munity, that she is indeed irrevocably repudiated. Ultimately, the practice of Taläq, be it Triple or otherwise, mani­ fests a power imbalance that undermines the contractual nature of Is­ lamic marriage. Just as Islamic marriage contracts are constructed as  exercises in mutuality, certain legal systems recognize mubdr’a (divorce  by mutual consent): Senegal, Tunisia, and Turkey.63 Mutual dissolu­ tion is here complementary to the initially mutual agreement to the  marriage. Meanwhile, unilateral repudiation is depicted in the Qur’an  as a social practice requiring regulation through conditions such as  mandatory reconciliation efforts and clauses for revocability. The Sudan and Yemen still formally recognize Triple Taläq, while  custom perpetuates its practice in countries such as Egypt, Bangladesh,  India, Pakistan, and Nigeria.64 Ibn Taymiyya, not particularly femi­ nist, but particularly concerned with bringing intent, and especially  divine intent, to bear on the law, was willing to dwell in prison for his  views on unilateral repudiation and his inability to “conceal knowl­ edge.” Some seven hundred years later, similar opportunities abound  for disseminating legal knowledge and advocating for legal and social  reform of unjust repudiation practices. 63 See WLUML, 253. 64 WLUML, 258. 196 </page> </plain_text>
