<plain_text><page sequence="1">i The mountain in the city: SOCIAL USES AND TRANSFORMATIONS OF A NATURAL LANDFORM IN URBAN SPACE Bernard Debarbieux Mount plain Royal of Montreal. emerges Its with height a few is modest other hills (200 from m); the in modern remarkably parlance, flat, wide it is plain of Montreal. Its height is modest (200 m); in modern parlance, it is a 'hill' But such topographical categories were adopted only in the eighteenth century. Before that time Montrealers, probably struck by the sharp contrast between Mount Royal and its environs, by its steep slopes, by the rocky section at its summit, got used to calling the place 'the Mountain'.1 Subsequently and despite its odd terminology, Mount Royal remained 'the Mountain'. A very strong and specific bond has developed over the centuries between Montrealers and the Mountain. During that time, Mount Royal has been deeply transformed. Such transformations have taken place with attention to its personnality, to the specific place it occupies in the landscape and to the imagination of local peo- ple. Today, four cemeteries, a large and beautiful park, monumental buildings and wealthy residential districts are gathered there. Together with the landform itself, these compose a landscape dramatically different from its surroundings. Mount Royal's natural specificity has not only been kept but consciously elabo- rated through history. These few historical and morphological facts introduce this study of rela- tionships between a natural phenomenon and a city. I am not concerned with the traditional French concerns for the influence of site on the evolving urban morphology;2 nor do I follow more recent concerns with the social and practi- cal implications of nature in the urban landscape;3 nor even urban ecology: the interpretation of the city as an ecological complex combining natural and arti- ficial elements.4 Here I adopt another approach to the subject of natural sites in urban geography. I stress three questions: how natural landforms located in urban environments are socially identified and connoted; how different mean- ings successively or simultaneously attached to these landforms may explain the Ecumene 1998 5 (4) 0967 -4608(98) EU 1490 A Â© 1998 Arnold</page><page sequence="2">400 Bernard Debarbieux way they are shaped and integrated into urban landscapes; and, more specifi- cally, what does it mean for the Mount Royal to be called 'the Mountain? How does this name simultaneously refer to a generic category of landforms, to a special kind of valued landscape, and to a very specific place in the Montreal area? These questions relate this paper to current concerns in anglophone cultural geography.5 Theoretically, however, my aim is to combine two distinct social sci- ence traditions focusing on two different levels of meaning. On the one hand, I acknowledge the influence of structuralism within the French scientific cul- ture; on the other, I will borrow from American intellectual culture a more prag- matic and comprehensive approach to social science. Given this dual theoretical parentage, some conceptual orientation is appropriate before returning to the specific study of Mount Royal. Conceptual considerations Psychological and anthropological schematas A strong tradition among French philosophers and social scientists has sought to underline significant and recurrent characters in human relations with the natural environment. The example of mountains will clarify the point. Several authors have been struck by the recurrence of meanings associated with moun- taneous landforms and landscapes: religious characters associated with isolated mountains can be found worldwide;6 cities in varied cultural contexts are located according to a major rocky or mountainous shape, recalling the religious char- acter of their foundation.7 The ascent of mountains is widely associated with moral and initiatory values.8 More general approaches to the Anthropology of space' have shown that the cultural differentiation of summits and bases, and higher and lower sections of slopes, is widespread.9 Explanations of such recurrences usually combine two different kinds of fac- tor, psycho-physiological and symbolic-imaginary. The former refer to anatomy, physiology and the character of human perception of its environment. Our standing position10 and the laws of geometry mean that human vision allow us to see an isolated mountain from far away; from its top it may give us a view over wide portions of land. On the other hand, it is impossible simultaneously to see both sides of a mountain. The second set of factors extends the first: the primacy of vision in human perception and human ability to handle mental images and symbols mean that human beings came to give symbolic meanings to verticality and to objects able to materialize verticality (rocks, trees, stakes, mountains).11 Some philosophers, such as Gaston Bachelard12 and Gilbert Durand,13 deeply influenced by Jung's theory of archetypes and convinced by the power of imagination, worked on the idea that natural landforms and arti- ficial shapes were associated with universal meanings evident to any human being. Rocks, mountains and verticality are used as major illustrations by both philosophers. Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="3">The mountain in the city 401 In referring to these structuralist theories of 'psychological and anthropo- logical schemata', I suggest a first major hypothesis for this paper: meanings and practices on Mount Royal can pardy be understood in relation to generic mean- ings and practices associated with rocks, mountains and verticality. Contextual definition of the geographical ' object * By taking into account structuralist theories, I do not suggest that cultural mean- ings and social uses are determined by them. I suggest that psycho-anthropo- logical structures are latent schematas susceptible of actualization in different contexts and expressions. Actualization occurs through a social process that several French and Italian geographers call 'territorialization'.14 This concept refers to the spatial deploy- ment of a system of collective practices and meanings proper to a social group or institution. But, for analysing the processes and modalities of territorializa- tion, I shall base my interpretation of territorialization on pragmatic and phe- nomenological theories, frequently used by American geographers. These traditions of thinking stress, rather better than functionalist theories, the empirical and sensed nature of experience of the world. For this reason, they incorporate local or specific contingencies in social processes. Pragmatic phi- losophy suggests that practical experiences of the world define its reality. Symbolic interactionism15 offers a useful conceptualization of 'objects', as enti- ties collectively individualized in the material environment and acting as tools for social cohesion. Recent developments have shown that this theorization of 'objects' may also be useful for understanding territorialization.16 Ethnomethodology suggests that a social group exists mainly through the accounts it constructs for itself, of the world that it represents for itself and the objects individualized in it.17 In this process of social self-definition, shared lan- guage and conventions of representation play a major role. In this discussion of Mount Royal, I apply these insights to the designation of a natural object and the attribution of meaning to it as a stage in the double process of self-desig- nation of a social group on one hand and of territorialization on the other hand. In this paper, I will try to show that contemporary and historical meanings and practices of Mount Royal may be understood simultaneously as manifesta- tions of anthropological schematas and as the contingent result of 'objects' iden- tification through a complex interaction involving individuals, social groups and the physical environment of the city. Symbolic and mythic significance of places In adressing a modern society - Montreal from the seventeenth to the twenti- eth centuries - we cannot simply appeal to universal and local meanings and understanding. We must take in account varying territorial scales. Indeed, Montreal society is neither homogeneous nor isolated from other social group- ings, for example French, British or Canadian. So it is necessary to bear in mind that local meanings and practices also need to be relevant to these groupings Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="4">402 Bernard Debarbieux and at these scales. Thus we might say that, while representations and practices in respect of mountains for different grouping having strong ties between them, they can neither be the same nor completely different. They partly specify each group but, at the same time, they need to be adjusted between groups, between social levels and between territorial scales, for they all share certain character- istics which allow us to speak of a 'Western culture of mountains'. Elsewhere, I have shown that the necessity of adjusting systems at different scales usually pro- duces homologies in structures of meaning and shaping of spaces and places at different territorial levels.18 This paper demonstrates that something analogous is at work for the uses and shaping of Montreal's Mountain. Therefore, a specific system of meanings and practices is constrained by a necessary adjustment to two major references: latent schemata on one hand and a macro-scale system of meanings on the other. For this reason, many elements of a specific system are symbolic, for, consciously or unconsciously, they refer to other meanings or practices, and through them to other groups, to other ter- ritorialities, or even to a broad human condition. For example, practices such as hiking, burial or planning a natural park on Mount Royal may simultaneously and symbolically refer to hiking in other mountains, to the sacred value of high places for funeral purposes and to the idea that mountains are refuges of nature. But since a specific place is always more than a symbolic illustration of some- thing else, since there is a local society for whom it is a specific object consti- tutive of that society, that place also bears what I call a 'mythic value'.19 The mythic value of a place is the condition and the result of an internal logic of territorialization. In it lies the possibility for a social group to define itself by combining historical facts and legendary events, with spatial and material char- acters of the place. I consider the 'mythic conception of place' as a major process in collective identity formation in a specific place, its territory. It is combined with a 'symbolic conception of forms' connecting every specific form, locally individualized, with universal schemata and generic forms socially relevant at a wider scale. Historical evolution The final theoretical question concerns history and change. How may a system of meanings and practices change over time if it is an actualization of latent structures in specific socio-territorial context? How may specific socio-territorial constructs and macro-level meanings and practices remain historically adjusted? These questions are not merely theoretical: Margaret Nicholson,20 Numa Broc21 and Simon Schama22 have all emphasized the decisive shift at the turn of the eighteenth century in the aesthetics of mountains. Naturalists and artists began to interpret mountains as natural milieux demanding new interpretations in rela- tion to new conceptions of nature and the self. This major evolution opened European mountains to long-lasting touristic practices. This innovation relied less on totally new images and meanings than on rearrangements of existing potentialities: Schama identifies recurrent meanings in the various images and uses of the mountains in Western culture.23 So it is possible to conceive Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="5">The mountain in the city 403 schematas as stable potentials, and actualizations as the outcome of contextual innovation. Thus, the ability of a group to produce specific social representa- tions of natural objects relies on the degree of intuitive knowledge of initial con- ditions and on its capacity to invent new expressions of meaning, combining already existing ones with actualization of other potentialities. Initial conditions refer to actual cultural meanings locally, nationally and globally, to psychologi- cal and anthropological parameters and to sociological and economical processes. Such evolution also has a spatial aspect. When a major innovation occurs in one place, it is liable to be duplicated and adapted in comparable contexts within the same cultural space. The decisive turn in the Western representation of mountains occurred in the Alps. With colonization and international tourism, it took place later in other major mountainous regions around the world. For a geographer, this process may be analysed as an example of spatial diffusion. I call it the duplication of an 'exemplary place'24 making explicit reference to a model located elsewhere. These theoretical considerations help structure the social and cultural history of Mount Royal, a history which identifies various arrangements of recurring and innovative meanings and practices, which combines an explanation of local characters with more generic processes and an understanding of the processes specific to Montreal society. The progressive social identification of a natural landform (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries) Early neighbours and visitors Mount Royal has been perceived as a specific form since the early days of the French presence in the St Lawrence valley. Jacques Cartier was the first European to enter the area in 1535. His voyage up the river was interrupted by rapids, and he was struck by the presence of 'Mount Royal' in the landscape. In choos- ing the name, he tied the landform symbolically to a double territorial refer- ence: it was linked to the natural category of 'mounts' (at that time a topographical landmark), and, being 'royal', it was instantly appropriated on behalf of the French monarch. Later, Cartier walked to the summit in the company of inhabitants of the island's sole Amerindian village, Hochelaga. There, he overlooked the plain, try- ing to obtain strategic information on natural corridors and resources. The mor- phology of the mount was actually much more complex than he expected: rather than a single mountain, Cartier discovered three different hills, of about the same height, encircling a natural basin. At this time, the mount probably rose out of the dense St Lawrence forest. If we believe a map drawn during his expedition (Figure 1), this was probably still the case when, less than a century later, Samuel de Champlain visited the area. In 1642 Ville-Marie, the first French colony and the historical nucleus of Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="6">404 Bernard Debarbieux Figure 1 ~ The St Lawrence river rapids and banks, and Mount Royal (lower right).

GuÃ©gan, ed., Trois voyages au Canada (Paris, Editions du Carrefour, n.d.). present-day Montreal, was founded. From that point, archival evidence can tell us what happened on Mount Royal. In 1643 the colony's military commander, Maisonneuve, fearing a flood, promised to plant a cross on the mount if the village was saved. In the following year, he carried a wooden cross there as a devotional act, making it a local pilgrimage site. As Montrealers began to clear the forest back from the river, the mount remained a forested island in the recently surveyed, inhabited countryside. Recreative uses The landscape remained relatively unchanged up to the mid-nineteenth century, as Montreal remained a small city. During the early decades of that century the Mount became variously used, mainly for recreation. First, the local bourgeoisie adopted the habit of taking a drive on the 'Mountain'. At that time, three old paths designed in the early stage of the French colonization either crossed (CÃ´te des Neiges) or skirted (CÃ´te Sainte- Catherine and CÃ´te Saint-Antoine) Mount Royal. Wealthy Montrealers could then enjoy different 'tours of the Mountain' by combining two of these old paths: one led around the whole Mountain while two shorter ones followed the Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="7">The mountain in the city 405 CÃ´te des Neiges. For this reason, Montrealers came to distinguish two Mountains, the 'main' (eastern) and the 'small' (western) one (Figure 2). The first tourist guide of Montreal, published in 1836, suggests that these landscapes fitted some idyllic vision of the countryside: The slopes of the mountain are wooded nearly to the summit; but towards the base, the forest-trees have been succeeded by orchards that produce apples, pears, and plums of the choisest flavour; and it is worthy of remark that, althoÃ¹gh the fruit of the Island is universally excellent, all other parts of it yield to the vicinity of the mountain in the luxuriance of the orchards, and the deliciousness of the fruits they produce.25 At the midpoint of these different tours, several inns were built where city dwellers could gather and enjoy the social pleasures of the countryside. Very often too, Montrealers went up to the Mountain for picnicking and enjoy- ing the landscape. The panorama itself, taking in the city, the river, the plain and, in the background, the mountains of Vermont and the Adirondacks (New York), was often described in the romantic hyperbole of the day: it is hard to grasp the prospect enjoyed from the place; let us imagine a very vast land, where the Saint Lawrence river snakes superbly . . . On the right are the terri- ble rapids where the river rushes into sharp rocks with a dreadful noise so loud that it can be heard from the top of the Mountain; on the left, almost at your feet, lies the city of Montreal, with its churches and steeples.26 Figure 2 ~ Map of the Montreal archipelago in 1764 by J. N. Belin. Courtesy Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal/Collection Centre Canadien d'Architecture. Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="8">406 Bernard Debarbieux Later, Henry Thoreau, enjoying the same landscape, wrote a more academic description of it.27 Last, the Mount became from the 1840s a major place for lovers of nature sports. During the winter, it became the favourite training ground for snow- shoers. Ascents of the Mountain are described as a healthy and manly exercise.28 Snowshoers especially appreciated crossing the Mountain during winter nights. Suppers were taken in one of the inns located behind Mount Royal, offering an opportunity to experience the ritual pleasures common to this kind of assem- bly, very different from the more formal meetings organized in the city. In so doing, snowshoers, as well as drivers and riders in the 'tour of the Mountain', took advantage of being on the side of Mount Royal hidden from the city.29 Symbolic meanings The analysis of these early uses and accounts of Mount Royal illustrates my ini- tial hypothesis. Psychological and anthropological schematas are apparent: Cartier, Maisonneuve and the snowshoers, differently but together, illustrate the symbolic and sometimes religious value of the ascent; Cartier and the snowshoers exploited the panoramic quality of the summit, while the snowshoers and those touring the Mountain exploited the contrast between visibility and invisibility. And at the same time, all these practices were related to specific territorial- ization of the place according to contextual conditions: Maisonneuve's ascent makes explicit reference to the Passion of Christ and to the ritual initiated by St Francis of Assisi.30 The drivers touring around the Mountain drew upon an idyllic vision of the countryside common in England at that time. Hikers shared with their European fellows an admiration for picturesque landscapes as seen from the top of mountains. Snowshoeing on Mount Royal demonstrates the influence of the European model of excursionism and sporting sociability; the narrative composition of their early accounts seeks to imitate texts written by similar clubs in Europe.31 As a whole, recreational uses of Mount Royal offer a local illustration of the kind of relationship set up during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries between the city and the countryside in Western Europe, between images of urban environments on one hand and of picturesque and healthy nature on the other. Although the Montreal-Mount Royal composition is constructed from local contingencies and is thus meaningful at that scale, it reflects a very European way of interpreting the landscape. From the sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries, multi-scale articulation of meanings had been at work with the deeper process of actualizing schematas. But no specific work had yet been undertaken in shaping the natural mountain to match this ideal representation. This was to happen during the second half of the century. Shaping Mount Royal (1850s- 1880s) Around the mid-nineteenth century, Mount Royal began to be built and shaped in order to fit social expectations of the time. The south-eastern slope became Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="9">The mountain in the city 407 a residential district. A public park and two huge cemeteries were developed at the summit. These transformations shared two major characteristics: first, all are explicitly conceived as the making of high-quality landscapes duplicating imported models but taking advantage of local morphology; second, they have to be interpreted as various modes of capitalist deployment on the urban fringe. Wealthy residences in the countryside During the 1840s and 1850s, Montreal's population boomed (Figures 3a and 3b)32 on the back of railways and factory building. Differentiation increased between industrial and residential districts, and within residential districts them- selves. Wealthy merchants, who had been locating summer residences on the lower slopes of Mount Royal since the late eighteenth century, increasingly turned them into permanent residences. The south-east slope of the Mountain was becoming a distinctive residential area. The style of these early residences was highly eclectic and ostentatious. Historians of architecture have, however, identified several characteristics: with few exceptions, these large dwellings are closer to the style of the villa than of the city house; unlike those of other cities, these bourgeois houses recall country houses; almost all of them are placed within an English garden, with many trees. Frequently, galleries or terraces adjoin them and numerous windows open on all sides.33 All took advantage of topography and the opening of the landscape toward the south. Another architectural historian34 noted that the designation of these Figures 3a and b ~ Montreal and the first transformations of Mount Royal in 1833 and 1879.

Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="10">408 Bernard Debarbieux houses itself was not very urban; for a long time they were identified neither by a number nor by the name of the road by which they were reached; indeed, most of the time their orientation was indifferent to that road. Most of the owners preferred to personify their house with a name - 'Thornhill', 'The Elms', 'Ravenscrag', 'Mount View', etc. These names were drawn from the English, Scottish and Gaelic lexicons refering to the topographical characters of the place, some of them - 'crag', for example - being connoted as highly romantic. The progressive increase in the number of houses on this slope of Mount Royal gave birth to an identifiable district, later known as the 'Square Mile'.35 The appearance of such a first-rate urban residential district is a common process of social distinction within industrial cities of that age; as several geog- raphers have noted, the upper parts of the local topography tend to be appro- priated by upper class residences.36 But the case of Montreal is especially interesting since the emergence of such a district occurred on such a distinc- tive site, intentionally exploited in different but complementary ways at the same time. The mainly English-speaking wealthy families of Montreal turned a nat- ural balcony into an exclusive area, and in doing so exploited various symbolic meanings of the location: settling on a specific landform in order to underline their own specificity; benefiting from qualities culturally attributed to this kind of environment. They took from hygienist theories the idea that the natural, airy environments of mountainous regions were healthy, and of course they could enjoy the panoramic landscape in the manner of a well-educated mem- ber of a British society.37 Staging the cemeteries in nature During the early stage of urbanization on its southern slope, another use of Mount Royal's natural setting was decided. In the early 1850s two cemeteries were opened, the Catholic CimetiÃ¨re Notre-Dame-des-Neiges and the Protestant Mount-Royal Cemetery. By the end of the century, these two corporations were to own properties totalling 500 acres. The cemeteries were strongly influenced by the American 'rural cemeteries' movement.38 The first and most famous rural cemetery, Mount Auburn,39 has been an extraordinary and long-lasting 'exemplary place' for the conception of burial places in America. The Montreal corporations wanted to imitate and surpass the best rural cemetery of the day. Before 1850, the graveyards of Montreal had been located lower, in that part of the city which was to become its new centre by the end of the century. Having decided to move, the corpo- rations looked for a green, hilly and 'natural' setting. Mount Royal properties were selected. Both chosen sites were completely invisible from the mid- nineteenth century city. The role given to vegetation in their design surpassed that given to the funeral monuments. Pathways were skilfully curved, deliber- ately contrasting with the grid of Montreal (Figure 4) . Monuments and trees seemed to be dropped at random on the lawns, again, in contrast to the geometrically laid out city. These qualities made the cemeteries popular places Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="11">The mountain in the city 409 Figure 4 ~ 'Topographical map of Mount Royal' (detail), drawn by A. de GranprÃ©, 1898; copy held by the Department of Geography, University of Montreal. The summits and transformations of Mount Royal can be distinguished: on the right and left slopes of the Outremont summit, the cemeteries with their network of alleys; on the Montreal summit, Olmsted's park; on the Westmount summit, the first villas looking south. for strolling on sunny Sundays during the 1860s and 1870s. Later purchases obtained land higher on one- of the three natural summits of the Mountain, which came to be known as 'Outremont Hill'. This summit, previously unspecified, is thus identified within the Montreal landscape. These purchases were justified in different ways. The official report of the Protestant Corporation underlined the View of the City and of all the Cemetery'.40 Later reports mentioned the prestige acquired with the purchase of the summit of the Mountain: 'The Trustees consider this parcel of land, although the most costly of their purchases, to be a very valuable addition to the Company's property. Its summit is the highest point in the island of Montreal'.41 The Catholic corpora- tion exploited topography in another way: designing a Way of a Cross in 1876 and allocating the upper lots to rich families and congregations. Both corporations strove to adjust a specific environment to their generic con- ception of an ideal cemetery. Both properties were located on the Mountain and designed to emphasize the specificity of the place; each combined advan- tages of visibility and invisibility with intimate and naturalistic foregrounds exploiting the idea of milieu and panoramic distant views plunging into the city. Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="12">410 Bernard Debarbieux In this way, they appeared simultaneously distant from Montreal yet accessible for practical and commercial reasons. Finally, the symbolism of height was exploited: the cemeteries were closer to the sky than the city.42 The very high- est pieces of land were kept aside for distinctive uses. Coming for a burial or for mourning, visitors ascended from the city towards nature. F. L. Olmsted: landscaping the mountain A third major transformation occurred on Mount Royal during the 1870s. The city of Montreal decided to purchase most of the land along the main crest of the Mountain, facing the harbour and the urban centre, for the purpose of a public park. It entrusted F. L. Olmsted with the task of designing it. Twenty years after the creation of Central Park in New York City, the famous land- scape architect would create in Montreal one of his most original works. Olmsted was certainly faithful to his own moral and aesthetic principles in the Canadian metropolis, adapting the model of the English landscape to the American context. He introduced artifice into a natural environment, while rendering it almost invisible. The park's design is characterized by his com- prehensive vision of the urban society and his attention to the social and moral conditions of people.43 But local circumstances allowed him to innovate. For the first time in his professional life the architect had to cope with a highly accidented topography, and, after having found the idea of creating a park on the site totally inappropriate,44 he finally decided to reveal the 'genius of the place'.45 For this, his adopted guideline was to consider Mount Royal a mountain.46 Of course, Olmsted was neither naive nor ignorant about 'real mountains'. He had often walked in the White Mountains during his youth, and later worked in Yosemite. He knew how modest was the height of Mount Royal,47 but he believed that it could be designed as if it fulfilled the conditions of a mountain. In a late report, addressed to the 'owners of the Mountain', the City and citizens of Montreal, he wrote: You have chosen to take a mountain for your park, but, in truth, a mountain barely worthy of the name . . . Yet, whatever of special adaptation it has to your purpose lies in that relative quality. It would be wasteful to try to make any thing else than a moun- tain of it; equally wasteful to attempt any thing which would involve a loss of such advantages as it has for this purpose.48 This led him to underline Mount Royal's mountainous character, for exam- ple by highlighting its rocky section, getting rid of the trees hiding the 'crag' and piling up rocks in the steepest section. Moreover, this consideration led him to simulate other mountainous characteristics, absent on Mount Royal. He advo- cated the insertion of 'little pockets of leaf-mould about . . . rocks and proper seeds or plants, [in order] to dress it with characteristic mountain forms or foliage and bloom'49; he recommended the introduction of 'some beautiful species from Siberia and the high Alps of Europe, suitable for the most exposed situations',50 in order to create levels of vegetation typical of mountainous envi- ronments. At the summit, his 'Crown of the Mountain', Olmsted wanted the Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="13">The mountain in the city 411 vegetation to be denser and the paths narrower to enhance the feeling of being in a mountain. But the most fundamental aspect of Olmsted's application in Montreal of his idea of the mountain was idealistic. He recommended avoidance of major trans- formations of the place, and especially banks of flowers: 'Operations for the improvement [of the immediate landscape] should . . . not be ambitious [and should] avoid ... an ordinary conventional gardening style of work, as finical, unseemly and out of character with the genius of the place'.51 His attitude was not merely aesthetic; it was moral, referring to any kind of 'improvement . . . inconsistent with mountain dignity, serenity, and strength'.52 Other passages demonstrate that Olmsted had no ideal of wilderness or natural authenticity in mind in Montreal when talking of the Mountain.53 His work was explicitly conceived according to a Romantic model of mountains, influenced by Wordsworth's poetry and Ruskin's aesthetics.54 This led him to refer, more explicitly than anywhere else, to landscaped nature as a counter- point to urban environment, to the Mountain as the antithesis of Montreal. The map designed by Olmsted himself (Figure 5) reflects perfectly Olmsted's wish to combine design with local topography, and the kind of contrast with the city he wanted to introduce. More than designing an existing 'mountain', he actually created one. And successfully: for many Montrealers of today, the place- name 'Mount Royal' and the nickname 'Mountain' refer first of all to the park. Official Montreal maps (Figures 6a and 6b) have made the designation of Mount Royal coextensive with the park. Others summits of the Mountain, located fur- ther north and west, which were to become properties of the cemeteries and the city of Westmount, frequently disappeared from the cartography of the Mountain. As often in Olmsted's works, the aesthetic landscape was also supposed to have hygienic value. The Mountain was intended to offer the 'town-strained Figure 5 ~ The park as drawn by Olmsted in 1877.

Thus, Olmsted drew the main paths so that the walker experienced a progressive ascent of the Mountain. He was conscious of 'feeble' visitors and sought to make all sections of the park accessible to them; but all the visitors should have a pro- gressive experience of landscape, experiencing the rhythm of this modest ascent. For Olmsted, the key to the place was the contrast between the 'crag' and the gentle meadows laid out behind. The crag offered a dramatic prospect of the city and the river: 'the views [are] surpassing in expanse, beauty and variety those of any of the common tourist resorts on the continent;'56 in the case of the meadow, it was the invisibility and the sense of distance that mattered. Other sections of the Mountain were designed as intermediate spaces, offering successive transitions to urban landscape (see the eastern part of the park on Figure 5). Imagining a visitor strolling up to the 'Crown of the Mountain', he wrote: 'when [these sections] are enjoyed as successive incidents of a sustained landscape poem, to each of which the mind is gradually and sweetly led up, and from which it is gradually and sweetly led away, so that they become a part of a consistent experience.'57 Metaphorically, the ascent is conceived as a simultaneous distancing from the city and a progressive regeneration of the walker. There is thus an obvious continuity between Olmsted's valorization of the natural site and previous practices. As snowshoers, wealthy merchants and cemetery corporations had previously done, the American landscape architect exploited the contrast of visual qualities and the symbolic meaning of the ascent. Here lies the actualization of psychological and anthropological schematas. Together, these mid-nineteenth-century practices and transformations of the Mountain tend to duplicate landscapes and practices invented elsewhere. These local adaptations sometimes express the English character of the Montreal soci- ety (landscape painting, recreative ascents of the Mountain, designation of selec- tive residential districts), sometimes its tendency to copy American models (cemeteries, urban park). And the hilly, quiet, isolated and woody Mount Royal was the ideal location to realize these duplications. This was appropriate for a major city of the British empire, a city whose economic and political elite was English- or Scottish-born, for a bustling industrial and financial centre which was at that time regularly compared to New York and other major cities of the United States. But Olmsted went further than previous practice; more than the merchants and the corporations, he was acutely attuned to the aesthetic qualities of the place, and he alone had the opportunity and the inspiration to shape Mount Royal into the appearance of a mountain. In so doing, he brought closer together the specific mount and the generic idea of a mountain (Figure 7).

Debarbieux. Expressing endogeneous territorial myths (1870s-1940s) The growth of 'colonial nationalism' in Canada from the middle years of the nineteenth century and the social and cultural debates specific to the Canadian metropolis promoted alternative representations of the Mountain, less symbolic and more mythic, partly emancipating Mount Royal from generic and imported models. The Mount began to be seen as an emblem of national distinctiveness, a visible proof of a collective destiny. Emerging myths expressed the inhabitants' faith in their new nation: the Canadian nation, which became politically inde- pendent in 1867, and the French Canadian nation which struggled hard for offi- cial recognition. New meanings associated with Mount Royal reworked the old schematas and the same basic characteristics of a mountainous place, combin- ing them in a more narrative and epic way. The expression of Canadian nationalism An early expression of nationalistic rhetoric occurred among snowshoers tramp- ing accross Mount Royal during winter. It is possible to follow the emergence of new narratives in the annual reports of the club activities. Reports in the 1850s stressed physical exercise, collective pleasure and emulation of Amerindians by European-born Montrealers, making no reference to local speci- ficity. But in the 1870s, a few years after Canadian independence, the tune had Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="17">The mountain in the city 415 changed. Two examples make the point. In 1873 Lord Dufferin, the governor- general, attended a show on the Mountain; several snowshoeing clubs were dis- playing their art by night. In his official report, Dufferin described the meeting as an illustration of 'the enthusiastic devotion of the people [of Canada] to manly sports and exercize', a symbol of 'vitality of [Canadian national] temper and the independence of the national spirit'.58 Fifteen years later, a speech to the assembled snowshoers differently exploits the same rhetoric: Altogether our winter and its sports may well be honoured with a toast, and perhaps in no small degree to them may be attributed the vigourous physiques which distin- guish Canadian men and women around the world. We have a glorious season, and in our efforts to enjoy it we benefit ourselves morally and physically.59 Tramping on Mount Royal was no longer a simple duplication of European excursions in a local environment. It bore local meanings related to North American nature and Canadian winter. It was supposed to fit 'Canadian temper and spirit'. Mount Royal thus becomes an emblem of 'Canadianity',60 represen- tation of national nature and territory, and a mythic representation of Canadian response to it. The image fits perfectly with more general analysis of the terri- torial aspects of Canadian nationalism.61 At the same time, the evolution of Montreal's Square Mile witnessed a simi- lar transformation. In the 1870s the district began to lose its bucolic character. The population of the area, like that of the city as a whole, was growing rapidly. Land speculation had increased urban densities. The grid, introduced earlier in the city, had been adopted here too and a second generation of houses had been adapted to its rigorous geometry. The urban landscape of the slope was becoming much more banal. Nevertheless, the reconstructed district retained a strong architectural and social specificity. This allowed it to convey nationalist meanings of another kind. During the final decades of the nineteenth century, most wealthy Canadians lived there.62 Major institutions were established there. McGill College had been built in the 1840s, on property given by a wealthy Montreal merchant, but the growth of the college was contemporaneous with the Square's. At the end of the century McGill University, nestled in an elegant and woody campus, char- acterized a district which was frequently described as an emblem of national suc- cess, a source of collective pride. Several of the Square Mile's inhabitants were considered heroes of the nation, thanks to their political or economic activities. Daniel Smith, an extremely wealthy Montrealer, played a decisive role in major Canadian corporations (the Bank of Montreal, the Hudson Bay Company, the Canadian Pacific Railway) and in suppressing public disturbance in Manitoba in 1871. George Stephen was his partner in the Canadian Pacific operation, whose joining of the provinces from coast to coast became a founding moment in national historiography. These national figures found in Mount Royal a perfect place for self-gratification. Daniel Smith, when ennobled, adopted the title of 'Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal'. Both had mansions in the Square Mile. Both were generous donors to McGill University as it evolved into a major Canadian institution, promoting the development of classes for women and the teaching of medicine. Both voted Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="18">416 Bernard Debarbieux large amounts of money for the building of a new Protestant hospital, to be ded- icated to Queen Victoria. But their donation carried one condition which was accepted: the building had to be located on the upper border of the Square Mile. At the unveiling ceremony, speeches and newspapers described the hos- pital an emblem of Montreal modernity, a monument dedicated to science, and a proof of the philanthropy of the city's elite. The building owed at least part of its symbolic meaning to monumentality, and to its location and visibility.63 This example underlines the changing nature of elite display in Montreal's landscape. At the end of the century, altitude was still very attractive for panoramic, bucolic and hygienic reasons. But it was becoming more and more important to realize oneself, one's personal wealth and one's aspirations in the landscape, using Mount Royal as a natural platform. Since the Square -Mile was very visible from the city, the Canadian elite and its heroes could locate and dis- play themselves in the landscape, giving urban expression to their social and economic domination. Though isolated in an exclusive district, Montreal's upper class managed to be present in the daily landscape of Montrealers. Journalists and novelists prove until late in the twentieth century how much the disposi- tion of space and landscape in the city was effective in celebrating a Canadian pride which was strongly resented by the working, mainly French-speaking, class of Montrealers.64 The location of residences and buildings on the south-eastern slope thus deliv- ered a message of national prosperity, individual recognition and social domi- nation. Royal Victoria Hospital, as the highest building on the slope, occupied the most valuable land, and Canadian geographers have shown that for the early decades of the twentieth century there was an obvious correlation between alti- tude and the value of houses and apartments.65 Monumental celebration on Mount Royal Official nationalist rhetoric also expressed itself in monuments. Following European and American examples, Canadian institutions introduced the cele- bration of national historical figures as soon as the country became indepen- dent. Monuments to mythic figures were raised in urban squares, parks and cemeteries. Since the main cemeteries and park of the city were located on Mount Royal, it offered a natural platform for amplifying monumentality. Yet few realizations occurred in the park itself. Olmsted for one was firmly opposed to their construction. He regarded them as too obviously artificial, too likely to stir social or political antagonism to merit a place in his project.66 And his wish was respected: although many projects were submitted to the municipality, among them a prestigious promenade dedicated to Lord Strathcona (1901), very few monuments were actually built. The reason may have been the very lack of unanimity foreseen by Olmsted. The history of projects and their realization shows how Montreal linguistic and cultural dualism influenced the process of nationalist celebration. One of the first such proposals for a monument on Mount Royal was made in 1867, the year of Canadian independence. It was intended to honour Jacques Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="19">The mountain in the city 417 Cartier. According to one of its promotors, the location was determined by his- tory: Where is the proper spot for a monument to Jacques Cartier? According to my mind, and I hope you will agree with me, that place is pointed out by history; Jacques Cartier has marked it himself. On the 20th October 1535, Jacques Cartier ascended the Mountain, and when on top of it, contemplated the extent and beauty of the sur- roundings countries, and he said: 'I name this mountain Mount RoyaL'67 But at that time, Canada was not about to celebrate Carder nor any event of its specifically French history. And he got no monument on Mount Royal.68 Much later, in 1919, a huge monument was erected to honour another French Canadian, Georges-Etienne Cartier, the sole notable monument ever erected in the park (Figure 8) .69 This Canadian leader was one of the very few to receive official recognition from French as well as English Canadians. He is considered in official Canadian historiography as the French-speaking partner of the pair who made possible independence and the Canadian federation. His English- speaking equivalent, Thomas D'Arcy McGee, got no monument in the park but received a prestigious sepulchre in the Mount Royal cemetery. In fact, since the Figure 8 ~ The G. E.

Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="20">418 Bernard Debarbieux main cemeteries located on Mount Royal were quite distinct on religious grounds, more or less reflecting the linguistic partition of Montrealers, they were the perfect places for celebrating two distinct groups of heroes. The Protestant cemetery contained numerous individual and collective funeral monuments gathered in the lowest sections of the site; and when the corporation bought a piece of land on one of the three summits of Mount Royal, its trustees imme- diately saw it as 'a fitting site on which to erect a memorial to the fame of some Canadian worthy, or as a record of some event in the history of our city or Dominion'.70 Simultaneously, the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery became the main place for celebrating French-speaking and Catholic leaders, G. E. Carder among others. Monuments were erected in memory of many of these, on the most elegant higher levels of the site. Again, one can identify the way in which the topographical qualities of Mount Royal and its location within the Canadian metropolis have allowed formal appropriation, and the symbolic display of nationalism. Its high points, once pic- turesque places, offered a 'conspicious beacon for many miles around'.71 Speeches and texts merged place (Canada, Montreal), major events (explo- ration, independence), national heroes and collective practices into a single mythical landscape. An example written in honour of Thomas D'Arcy McGee and G. E. Cartier is indicative: 'Both had been rebels in their days, but both had, like Jacques Cartier, stood upon the summit of Mount Royal and had there conceived a vision of a Greater Canada.'72 Symbolic places and landscapes inher- ited from former realizations of schemata (summit position, ascent, panoramic vision) or duplication of exemplary places (park, cemetery) began to be rein- terpreted through a mythic conception of the place, as Canadians and Montrealers composed their own story on Mount Royal. The display of French Canadian pride Though the example of statues and funeral monuments is very striking, the sociocultural and linguistic division of Montreal society had other ways of dis- playing itself on the Mountain. Since most early transformations were initiated according to elite British models, the Mountain as a whole was early considered by the French community as the area of the 'well-to-do'.73 The Square Mile attracted the most prestigious residences; the park conceived by Olmsted as a place of social convergence was effectively a space reserved for the pleasures of the British bourgeoisie. The golf course, the riding club, the hunting pavilion were all located in or near the park. Apart from Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery, Mount Royal would have remained a British or English-speaking stronghold. However, a demographic shift in favour of French-speaking Montrealers74 and the election of French- speaking populist mayors75 turned the Mountain into a major theatre of social rivalry. Once again, its morphological characteristics were exploited within this contestation. The rapid growth of the city stimulated the urbanization of the remaining slopes. The north-western (CÃ´te-des-Neiges) and north-eastern (Outremont) Ecumene 199 8 5 (4)</page><page sequence="21">The mountain in the city 419 slopes were settled mostly by upper-middle-class, French-speaking families. Over the course of the twentieth century Outremont became the district of the fran- cophone elite, attracting members of an emerging economic class, new politi- cal leaders, lawyers, municipal and provincial civil servants. But the most significant aspect of Outremont was its location and its urban characteristics: it occupied the slope directly opposite Westmount, Montreal's wealthiest suburb which sheltered families who had abandoned the Square Mile to offices and high-rise developments. Even the names of these two suburbs express topo- graphic opposition: Westmount is located on the western slope and Outremont ('Over the Mount') was also named after the Mountain. In both cases a sharp social gradient appeared between the lower districts, peopled with medium and even lower classes, and the upper districts, where elegant and sometimes huge detached houses rose amidst gardens and private parks. Decades after the cre- ation of the cemeteries, opposition and symmetry once again actualized a struc- tural schemata on Mount Royal, this time for the living. Further, the main institutions of the French community decided to erect some very conspicuous buildings on places they wished to mark. In 1929 a monu- mental metal crucifix was erected on the top of the main summit of the Mountain, in Olmsted's park, facing the southern and eastern districts of the city. The cross was intended to celebrate Maisonneuve's ascent in 1643. Later, an electric installation illuminated it at night. This cross was the initiative of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, a very active institution promoting the combined interests of the Catholic church and French Montrealers, and paid for by a huge subscription by thousands of citizens. At the same time, two other major buildings were appearing on the northern slope. In 1922 the University of Montreal building in the city was destroyed by fire. The University, officially directed by the Catholic church but mainly financed by public funds, was at that time the only one to deliver classes in French at universi tary level in Montreal. But it was much smaller and less famous than McGill University. It was decided to relocate the new building on the north- ern slope of the Mountain, distant from the French area of the city. Subsequently the image of the University has been associated with that of the Mountain (Figure 9). This still rural location, although inconvenient to reach from resi- dential districts, was certainly attractive. Hygienic arguments similar to Olmsted's were rehearsed. Symbolic meanings of ascent also reappeared in its promotion. But the political and territorial value of the location was more important. The City of Montreal tried to influence the decision by offering two different pieces of land, one in the lowest section of the park where the city intended to develop a monumental civic centre, and another further north. Strong opposition, led by mainly English-speaking defenders of the park's integrity, pushed the University towards the second location. A monumental building was erected in the architectural style of the 1930s: a single structure combining art nouveau and pre-modernist influences, with symmetrical wings and a central tower visible for miles around. Once again, Mount Royal appeared a perfect pedestal for a beacon of national identity. Once again, contrast and symmetry with an equivalent 'English' cityscape was obvious: the University of Montreal is located Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="22">420 Bernard Debarbieux Figure 9 ~ The University of Montreal and Mount Royal have been associated in successive logos (1920, 1951, 1966).

Bizier, L'UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al : la volontÃ© de savoir (Montreal, Libre Expression, 1993). opposite McGill University. But while the French-speaking university underlined the contrast through its modernist monumentality, McGill remains faithful to the neoclassical architecture and landscape of British universities and early American campuses. The other major building erected on the northern slope of Mount Royal was the Oratoire Saint-Joseph. During the late nineteenth century, a member of the Sainte-Croix Catholic congregation settled at CÃ´te-des-Neiges, Alfred Bessette, became famous for his miraculous healing abilities. He was allowed to build a small chapel immediately below the western summit of Mount Royal, which became the property of the city of Westmount. Here, FrÃ¨re AndrÃ©, as Bessette Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="23">The mountain in the city 421 was called, received mystic experiences and adopted the practice of climbing the slope on his knees, in the tradition of the via dolorosa. The growing pil- grimage required a much bigger edifice which was to remain for decades the largest religious building of the continent. Work began in 1924 and the oratory was finished after the Second World War. Its architecture was neo-Renaissance, very much inspired by Florence cathedral (Figure 10). The Catholic hierarchy, initially reluctant to recognize this informal cult, later ratified it, using the ref- erence to the Way of the Cross and exploiting the symbolic potential of the building's dominant location.76 These two buildings, the University of Montreal and the Saint-Joseph oratory, represent the major interventions on Mount Royal between the 1920s and the 1940s. They share many characteristics: both are highly monumental; though they exploit different architectural models, both develop vertically, reaching at their top the height of the natural summits of Mount Royal. Each is highly vis- ible both from Mount Royal and from the northern parts of the island of Montreal. The 'far side' of the Mountain finally overcame its invisibility to the city. In the 1920s Montreal extended toward the north, and on the eve of the inauguration of the two buildings a major portion of the city lay at their feet Figure 10 ~ The Saint-Joseph oratory; in the background, Westmount summit.

Symbolic exploitation of symmetry took over from the exploitation of invisibility, and the Mountain came to express the self-confidence of a formerly subordinate group, its landscape reworked according to ideas of French Montreal identity. Conclusions: natural form and social shaping This dense but selective history indicates how numerous and various have been the uses of Mount Royal. But behind this variety lie a limited number of characteristics in the social representations of a natural landform, in its trans- formation and in the ways of imagining the nature of the place. In conclusion, I pull together these recurrent characteristics and return to the two initial hypotheses about anthropological and cultural processes, symbolic and mythic meanings. Thanks to the sharp topographical contrast between the mount and the plain, Mount Royal has always been seen as a specific feature in the landscape. This process of objectivation has been observed for similar topographies in many other geographical, historical and cultural contexts. It can be accounted for by laws of perception psychology. Nevertheless, the shape has been seen in different ways throughout Montreal history; Montrealers have seen sometimes one, sometimes two, sometimes three natural summits, according to their specific needs. But, since the mid-nineteenth century, major transformations, such as cemeteries, park and monumental buildings, have tended to emphasize the morphological specificity of Mount Royal. There has been a conscious and Figures 11a and lib - Montreal and the major twentieth-century transformations of Mount Royal in 1907 and 1932.

Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="25">The mountain in the city 423 clear intentionality in keeping Mount Royal as a specific shape within Montreal's landscape. This relates in part to a functionalist conception of urban space in Montreal; the specificity of the landform perceived has permitted the location of specific urban functions (parks, cemeteries) and elitist practices (country-like residences, universities) which could benefit from dissociation from the rest of the city, for both practical or symbolic reasons. In others words, local morphology lent itself especially well to the clear visual expression of meaningful oppositions: everyday life versus cemeteries, park versus busy city, high social status versus low. If the process of objectivation of the natural shape is mainly psychological and anthropological, the meanings associated with it and the practices induced by them are social and cultural, thus contextual. Mount Royal history demonstrates the continuous valorization of two specific visual qualities. The first is the panoramic vision from the summit: from Cartier's ascent to Olmsted's planning of the 'Crown of the Mountain' and Mount Royal Cemetery observatory, recurrent attention has been afforded to the wide visi- bility given by this position. However, each example does not have the same sig- nificance. Cartier's strategic purpose differed radically from Olmsted's conception of the picturesque; social and practical meanings are highly con- textual. But both took advantage of the same potential. Symmetrically, this potential of visibility has been exploited by public and private buildings, emblems of the Catholic church and monuments. The woody section of the park itself exploited the high position in order to deliver social, cultural or political messages. Visibility gives a huge value to the accessible peaks. And since the room available there is always limited, this value is distributed down-slope: the specific value of each location on Mount Royal is determined by what is above and below it. I indicated several illustrations of this principle in Olmsted's con- ception of the Mountain, in residential differentiation and in the location of major institutions and monuments. The second quality of the place is the opposition between visible and invisi- ble locations: the slopes facing the city were systematically exploited for land- scape contemplation and ostentatious buildings; the slopes remaining in the shade sheltered monuments, behaviours and evocations that were regarded as inappropriate in the city centre. The cemeteries were removed from the every- day landscape; inns reserved for alternative experiences to urban social life; the quietest sections of the cemeteries and the gentle meadows drawn by Olmsted were isolated and invisible externally. But when the visual status of a slope dra- matically changed, its appearance also changed. The once forsaken northern slope experienced tremendous transformation as it began to dominate the spreading suburbs of Montreal. When the growth of Montreal brought all parts of the Mountain within its scope, all of them were transformed according to a similar pattern of exploit- ing visibility. But then the dual orientation of the slopes allowed Montreal's divided society to take advantage of another potential: symmetry. Residential dis- tricts, universities and hospitals actualized that potential in the emerging urban structure and social space, allowing the display of a highly contextual charac- Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="26">424 Bernard Debarbieux teristic, the divided dual nature of society and the French-speaking community's ambitions. Once again, local topography and laws of perception served social and political logics in the structuring of landscape meanings. The second hypothesis concerned the dual nature of meaningful evocations on Mount Royal. During the initial building and shaping of Mount Royal, a complex symbolic process was at work: Montrealers tried mainly to duplicate imported models and, when possible, to combine these with the anthropological value of the local context: this is why cemeteries and OlmsteÄs park, whose models were not developed on mountainous topography, exploited the physical characteristics and situation of Mount Royal. From the 1870s this complex of symbolic meanings was complemented by mythic ones: more and more frequently Montrealers sought to build their own identity and recall a collective history as Canadians or as French Canadians through celebration or buildings on Mount Royal. The Mountain thus became a place of memory and a platform for various nationalist emblems: nature, funeral monuments, evocation of political leaders, modern institutions and so on. The elaboration of two sets of narratives involving Mount Royal shows that the place was totally incorporated as a 'symbolic object' into two rival process of self-designation and territorialization. During the last three decades,77 the mythologizing of Mount Royal has con- tinued, and intensified. But it has been working less for the benefit of national identity than for local identities. Three processes may be identified. First, progressively fewer buildings have been erected since the 1950s. Urbanized slopes of Mount Royal have been increasingly historicized. The city recently decided to designate Mount Royal as a 'heritage district'. Transformations of the place, especially modernization, are more and more difficult to undertake. The park has been kept almost untouched; several active groups are promoting its management as a wilderness area. Second, during the last two decades, the linguistic and cultural debate involv- ing the shaping of Mount Royal has sharply decreased. Francophones are much more numerous than anglophones in almost all the residential districts of Mount Royal, apart from Westmount. Many places on the Mountain, formerly British strongholds, have lost that connotation. Mount Royal is becoming a place to celebrate cultural diversity. An increasingly valorized nature and architectural heritage, French as well as British, makes this social and urban convergence easier. Finally, Montreal is no longer the Canadian metropolis and has never been the cultural or political metropolis of Quebec. In response, a very strong local identity combined with a deep pride in being a Montrealer has been increasing. In the context of these three majors shifts, Mount Royal remains a major emblem for Montrealers; but its meaning is increasingly related to a mythical conception of local history (myths of original nature, of foundation, and of the cultural border in a bilingual country). The endogeneous process of territori- alization in the city has probably reached its peak.

Cassirer gave a few indications of the spatial character of this process in his 'mythic conception of place': Philosophie der symbolischen Formen (Mannheim, Ralph, 1972), trans, as The philosophy of symbolic forms II: Mythic thought (New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, 1996). According to Cassirer, a local society merges in a single figure, specific to a place, perceptions of the environment, repre- sentations of 'objects' located there and historical or legendary events supposed to have taken place there. 20 M.

D. Thoreau, A Yankee in Canada (Montreal, Harvest House, 1851), pp. 123-24. 28 A book written at the end of the century by a member of the most important club of that time, the Montreal Snowshoe Club, recounts, year after year, the races and excursions organized on Mount Royal. Speaking about the late 1850s, the author writes: 'Within the past two or three years, snow shoeing has become the most pop- ular of our winter amusements; and to form any idea of the number that engage in this glorious and healthy exercise, one cannot do better than take up a position on the side of the mountain any evening during the week, when he will have the satis- faction of seeing one or two clubs pass in their picturesque uniform, besides innu- merable smaller parties of from two to a dozen, among whom are not a few of the fair sex': W. Becket, The Montreal Snowshoe Club (Montreal, Becket Brothers, 1882), p. 388. 29 Accounts of these kinds of event are coy about what exactly happened; for example, we can only imagine the scene at Moore's in 1859: 'the usual toasts of the Queen, Governor General, sir Wm. Eyre etc., having been drank with all the honors, songs, speeches, jokes, etc. were kept up during the evening in a manner never before wit- nessed by the "oldest inhabitant" and the echos of the shouts and laughter that rang thro' the tree tops of old Mont Royal must have astonished "McTavish's Ghost": Becket, The Snowshoe Club , p. 39. The 'ghost' referred to is that of McTavish, a wealthy Montreal merchant and an early inhabitant of the southern slope of Mount Royal, who was buried on his own property. Sometimes the club happened to meet other assemblies with alternative conceptions of the advantage of the place: 'on the 29th [of December 1858], the Club went to Moore's but finding the Club Room filled by stranger party, enjoying the 'giddy mazes of the dance', they retired disgusted': ibid ., p. 38. 30 See Schama, Landscape and memory , pp. 436-46. 31 B.

In fact, this summit proved to be slightly lower than the one located on the territory of the City of Montreal. A temporary observatory was built there in 1877. 42 Hilltop burials are common in many societies (e.g. colonial New Zealand, Amerindians, Incas, Japan). I have found no explicit reference in the archives of either corporation to that motivation. 43 For general considerations on Olmsted's work, see C. Beveridge and D. Rocheleau, Olmsted: designing the American landscape (New York, Rizzoli, 1995); I. D. Fisher, Olmsted and the Ã¤ty planning movement in the United States (Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Research Press, 1986). Social criticism of Olmsted's work has included R. Lewis, 'Frontier and civilization in the thought of Olmsted', American Quarterly 29 (1977), pp. 385-403, and G. Blodgett, 'F. L. Olmsted: landscape architecture as conservative reform ' Journal of American History 62 (1976). The best analysis of his work in Montreal is by J. E. Seline, 'F. L. Olmsted's Mount Royal Park, Montreal: design and context' (PhD, Concordia University, Montreal, 1983). 44 'As a general rule rugged and broken ground is the last that should be chosen for a public recreation ground in the immediate vicinity of a large city'. F. L. Olmsted, Architect's preliminary report , Municipal Archives, file PT 3-01-1, 21 Nov 1874. 45 Ibid. 46 Olmsted never used the term 'park' in relation to his Montreal work, but always 'Mountain'. In order to prevent any confusion between the park itself and Mount Royal as a whole, I do not follow his terminology. 47 'Let it be borne always in mind that your mountain of less than a thousand feet of elevation is royal only by courtesy, and that if you attempt to deal with it as it had the impregnable majesty of an Alpine monarch, you only make it ridiculous': F. L Olmsted, Mount Royal, Montreal (New York, Putnam's, 1881), p. 51. 48 Ibid, (emphasis original). 49 Ibid., p. 3. 50 Ibid., p. 37-38. 51 F. L.

'Fancies, fashions and affectations, for which room might be temporarily allowed on another site, should have no place' (p. 42). 53 'All that you have seen and admired of the old work of nature must be considered as simply suggestive of what that is practicable, suitable, and harmonious with your purposes of large popular use' (ibid., p. 26); 'There are, upon the mountain, spaces of raw, barren surface, possessing no element of natural beauty, and in no way agree- ably interesting; simply blots. Indeed, it must be confessed that, in parts, most even the trees are rather forlorn objects' ( ibid ., p. 36). 'The error in art . . . would preserve and maintain this aspect of mountain scenery, simply because it is a natural aspect, and does not wholly exclude the charm of nature' (ibid., p. 36). 54 He quotes both of them several times, either as epigrams or in supporting his argu- ments. 55 Olmsted, Mount Royal, p. 63. 56 Olmsted, Architect's report. 57 Olmsted, Mount Royal, p. 59. 58 Quoted by Becket, The Snowshoe Club , p. 263. 59 Quoted ibid., p. 490-91. 60 J. B. Racine and P. Villeneuve, 'Ã la recherche de la canadianitÃ©', in R. Brunet, ed., GÃ©ographie universelle (Paris, Hachette, 1992). 61 This nationalistic and naturalistic interpretation of Mount Royal can be found in Canadian literature, even when written in French. A French-speaking novelist described the Mountain as a 'symbol of the great Canadian wilderness; a symbol of the vast forests, of the northern mountains, of the mother who nurtures our concrete cities': Y. Thierault, Aaron (Paris, Grasset, 1957). (My translation.) 62 According to RÃ©millard and Merrett, Demeures bourgeoises, p. 18, about 75% of the Canadian millionaires were living in the Square Mile in 1900; about 70% of the pri- vate wealth in Canada was owned by the inhabitants of the district. 63 In fact, very different motivations were successively or simultaneously given for its location. Some used its proximity to the Mountain as a justification. 64 I confine myself to two of many possible quotations: Gabrielle Roy built the plot of her most famous book (Bonheur d'occasion, MontrÃ©al, Beauchemin, 1945) taking advantage of this spatial distribution of residences. Her male hero, a worker living in Saint-Henri, a popular district located below the Mountain, dreams of becoming as rich and worthy of respect as the inhabitants of the Square Mile. 'He felt simultaneously full of hate and yet mighty before this Mountain which dominated him.' Morley Callaghan describes the Square Mile as 'a rock of riches with poverty sprawling around the rock': The many colored coat (New York, Coward-McCann, 1960), p. 151. 65 D. Hanna and S. Olsson, 'L'Ã©volution de MontrÃ©al: 1842-1901', in Atlas historique du Canada (Montreal, Presses Universitaires de MontrÃ©al, 1993), pis 30, 49. 66 He is explicit on this point in a letter sent in 1877 to the municipal commission charged with managing the park: : 'it must be always remembered that the mountain is a mountain and all finished artificial ornaments upon it will be more or less incon- gruous ... All funeral monuments and all with which would stir sad associations, all Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="32">430 Bernard Debarbieux monuments tending to kindle or keep alive differences of creed, of race, of politics or which would be provocative of antagonism of any kind should be excluded': 28 Apr. 1877, personal archives collected by Charles Beveridge. 67 This is not in fact true. Jacques Cartier named Mount Royal prior to its ascent, from the St Lawrence river; and no historical archive offers evidence of Carrier's appreci- ation of the 'beauty of the surroundings'. Quoted from a letter titled 'Monuments to French heroes' sent (in English) by a French Canadian to the daily newspaper The Gazette , 4 Dec. 1867, p. 1. This quotation is an interesting illustration of mythic and anachronistic aggregation of isolated events and sensibilities. 68 Another contemporary historical reference has been at stake for decades: Hochelaga. For centuries, the Amerindian village visited by Cartier had been known from the French navigator's writings. But nobody could pinpoint the exact location of the van- ished settlement. From the 1840s up to today, there have been two major interpreta- tions of its location: one on the McGill campus, mainly supported by English-speaking Montrealers; and one on the piece of land owned by the Catholic cemetery or on nearby territory of mostly French-speaking Outremont. On this question, see J. F. Pendergast and B.G. Trigger, Cartier's Hochelaga and the Dawson site (Montreal, McGill- Queen's University Press, 1972); P. Larouche, MontrÃ©al , 1535: la redÃ©couverte d'Hochelaga (Outremont, Villes Nouvelles-Villes Anciennes, 1992). 69 The monument was erected in the lowest, eastern slope of the park. It is huge and unconventional, differing from the theatrical pose of more classical statues. The main figures are allegorical; the original provinces of Canada are represented by elegant women in conversation. But the most interesting aspect of the monument is its situ- ation. It is located at the highest point on Park Avenue, a major road connecting the centre of Montreal to districts of the north. Another major avenue, connecting east- ern and working class districts, was planned to cross Park Avenue at this point; and the city of Montreal briefly considered concentrating major public institutions there. Thus, the monument was intended as a landmark in Montreal's modern townscape. This profound transformation of the lowest part of the park was never achieved. But the Cartier monument remains picturesquely located, with the most dramatic slope of the Mountain in the background. In the 1980s, it became a popular meeting-place for people enjoying Caribbean music. 70 Annual report, 1873. 71 Ibid. 72 J. M. Gibbon, Our old Montreal (Toronto, McClellend &amp; Stewart, 1947), p. 155. 73 The phrase seems to have been widely used at that time in Montreal. 74 Significant immigration from Quebec rural counties and territorial annexations of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries extending the city of Montreal towards working-class districts in the east raised the proportion of French-speaking Montrealers to a majority as early as the late 1860s. 75 Thanks to universal suffrage, the mayors of Montreal were mainly choosen by the French-speaking lower classes. Successives mayors such as MÃ©dÃ©ric Martin and Camillien Houde then adopted populist programmes and rhetoric on behalf of their constituents. 76 Two types of quotation illustrate this point: the first type relate to the visual domi- nation of the urban area, and are metaphorical. A year after the death of FrÃ¨re AndrÃ©, a hagiography relates that the funeral was attended by thousands of people: 'a great swell lifts the city like the sea, and the tide dashes against the slopes of Mount Royal': H. P. Bergeron, Le FrÃ¨re AndrÃ© : l'apÃ´tre de Saint Joseph (Montreal, Oratoire St Joseph, 1938), p. 237. The second type seem to express a more strategic interpretation of the Ecumene 1998 5 (4)</page><page sequence="33">The mountain in the city 43 1 situation: Mgr Maurault, a famous archbishop of Montreal, presents the Oratory as 'a beacon of Catholicism in a Protestant land ... ; it will dominate the whole western side of the island of Montreal': Maurault, Le fort , p. 143. Significantly, the archbishop makes a slight mistake, as the Oratory faces north. This may have been intentional, since the 'west' in Montreal is associated with English-speakers. The Oratory shares a similar situation with the SacrÃ©-CÅur in Paris. Here too, we see spiritual attraction and religious rhetoric associated with height and elevation. But the social and religious history of the two buildings differ radically. D.
