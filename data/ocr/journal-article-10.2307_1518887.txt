<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vetus Testamentum XLI, 2 (1991) A FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF D. W. THOMAS'S THEORIES ABOUT YADACl by J. A. EMERTON Cambridge The late D. Winton Thomas published a number of articles on the Hebrew verb yddac, as well as on cognate nouns, and argued that it does not always mean "to know" or the like. He claimed to have discovered a homonymous root related to the Arabic verb waduCa, "to become still, quiet, at rest". He suggested that, for example, the qal in Hebrew sometimes means "to have rest, be still, be quiet" (e.g. Isa. xv 4; Ps. xxxv 15; Job ix 5, xx 20; Prov. v 6), the hiphcil "to make quiet, submissive" (e.g. Judg. viii 16), "to humiliate" (e.g. Ecclus vii 20), and "to punish" (e.g. Gen. xviii 21), and the niph al "to be brought to submission" (e.g. Judg. xvi 9); further, the qal itself can mean "to be humiliated" (e.g. Hosea ix 7). He also claimed to find support for his theory in the ancient versions and in the writings of medieval and later Jewish commentators and lexicographers. Although he was not aware of the fact when he put forward his theory, Thomas had been anticipated by J. J. Reiske, Coniecturae in lobum et Proverbia Salomonis (Leipzig, 1779), who compared the Arabic and translated lo6-yddac in Job xx 20 as "Non erit quietus", and tedac in Job xxxvii 15 as "quietus manes", and suggested "humiliabitur" as a possible rendering of yiwwddeac in Prov. x 9. In 1970 I discussed Thomas's theory in an article (which he was able to read in typescript shortly before his death on 12 June of that year), which listed his relevant publications and the Hebrew i At the end of the article there is a list of works cited other than those for which precise references have already been given. It seemed best to give the references to Thomas's publications in the text of the article. I am grateful to Dr S. C. Reif for reading a draft of the discussion of rabbinical writers and for his helpful com- ments, and also to Dr G. I. Davies for reading a draft and also commenting helpfully.</page><page sequence="2">J. A. EMERTON passages mentioned in them. Although I did not find all his examples convincing, "there were some problems to which it sup- plied the best solution. On the whole, Thomas's suggestion about the meanings of ydc seemed to be the most satisfactory working hypothesis" (p. 179). William Johnstone has subjected the Arabic evidence advanced by Thomas to a searching examination in an article based on a paper read at the Congress of the International Organization of the Study of the Old Testament in Leuven in August 1989 and pub- lished in Vetus Testamentum earlier this year. He reaches the conclu- sion that the Arabic root to which Thomas appeals offers no support for his theory about the meanings of Hebrew yddac. The purpose of the present article is to look again at the question in the light of Johnstone's argument. After a brief consideration of the Arabic root, it will discuss the evidence of the ancient versions, the interpretations of the medieval rabbis, and then the principal verses of the Hebrew Bible to whose problems Thomas claims to find a solution in his theory. I Since Johnstone's article is primarily concerned with the Arabic evidence, it is best to begin with it. He points out that it is unsatisfactory to rely on the dictionary ofJ. G. Hava or on the later parts of E. W. Lane's great lexicon, since those parts were not prepared by Lane himself. It is important to study the usage more extensively in Arabic texts themselves and in the native lex- icographical works on which European lexicographers have drawn. The alleged meanings of wdc must be examined in context. Johnstone maintains that Thomas failed to do so, and that such an examination leads to the conclusion that wdc is not to be understood in the way in which Thomas has interpreted it. Among the principal points made by Jonstone in his detailed discussion are the following. While waduCa, the stative form of the Arabic verb, means "to be at rest, etc.", the active form wadaCa has such meanings as "leave alone, unharmed, unpunished; let go" and with a following imperfect "let, allow, permit". None of those meanings, he claims, is adequate to support Thomas's theory, and Johnstone goes on to examine some other forms of the Arabic root to which Thomas appeals. For example, although mawduc is said by 146</page><page sequence="3">THOMAS'S THEORIES ABOUT YADAC Hava to mean "submissive" when used of a horse, in fact it means something like "left (i.e., given his head)". It seems to me that Johnstone has established his point, and that Thomas's theory about the meaning of the supposed Hebrew cognate depends on a misunderstanding of the Arabic. When I wrote my article on Thomas's theory, I knew of the limitations of Hava and the posthumous parts of Lane and was aware of the need for a study of Arabic usage. For that reason it was necessary to seek the help of a capable Arabic scholar, and so I consulted my colleague, the late Dr G. M. Hinds, whose help I acknowledged on p. 167. He drew my attention to a passage in the Lisdn, which appeared to testify to the meaning required by Thomas's theory, and on p. 167 I quoted the passage with an English translation by Hinds (it was not my own translation as Johnstone, pp. 57-8, has assumed). Johnstone has shown, however, that the proposed rendering is mistaken. Martin Hinds, whose premature death is such a loss to scholarship, was an excellent Arabic scholar, but he had not investigated the usage of the Arabic root in the same extensive and thorough way as Johnstone, and it must be agreed that his translation does not fit the wider context of Arabic usage so well. Johnstone's rendering is convincing, and with it the one apparently solid piece of Arabic evidence for Thomas's general theory disappears. II Thomas cited the ancient versions in a number of places and claimed their support for his theory. I surveyed the evidence in 1970 (pp. 152-6), but it is now necessary to look at it again. Two of the passages cited by Thomas may now be removed from the discussion because they are based on questionable readings. The first of them is in 1 Sam. vi 3, where the M.T. has wenodac ldkem, but the Targum has wytrwh Ikwn, "and relief shall come to you", and the LXX xaodl t(xaa0ralTat u[,Lv. Thomas argued that the M.T. of the verse as a whole does not make sense if the Hebrew verb here means "to know", and that on the basis of the Arabic cognate the relevant words may be translated "and then shall rest be granted unto you" (JTS, N.S. 11 [1960], p. 52; cp. pp. 148 and 170 of my article). Since Thomas wrote, it has become known that 147</page><page sequence="4">J. A. EMERTON 4QSama has ]nkpr in place of the M.T.'s wnwdC,2 and it now seems likely that the LXX and the Targum were based on a Hebrew text that did not contain the root ydC. The other passage was not regarded by Thomas as direct evidence for the existence in Hebrew of the meaning that he postulated (JTS, N.S. 15 [1964], p. 156). Rather, he thought that it testified to the existence of a similar meaning for Syriac ydc. Perhaps he thought that the presence of such a meaning in another North-West Semitic language not only was interesting in itself, but also made it even more likely than before that the meaning existed in Hebrew. He appealed to the Peshitta of Ezra iv 13, where the Aramaic of the M.T. has tehanziq, "will damage", but the Syriac has wl' tdc, which Thomas translates "will not quieten, subdue" (JTS, N.S. 15 [1964], pp. 56-7; cp. p. 156 of my article). The reading of the Peshitta is, however, uncer- tain. In VT 25 (1975), p. 816, I thanked Dr M. P. Weitzman for drawing my attention to the fact that Codex Ambrosianus B 21 Inf. here reads, not tdc, but tzyC (folio 278 recto); unfortunately, my transliteration of the Syriac did not come out clearly, and the letter y looks more like a v. 1. The Greek versions Pp. 152-3 of my article considered the evidence of the Greek ver- sions. The LXX of Hosea ix 7 has xaxxoOisaSrxt where the M.T. has yedecu (Thomas, JTS 41 [1940], p. 43); and Aquila's counterpart of wayyedac in Ezek. xix 7 is xoa gxa&amp;xoae (Thomas does not cite this rendering). I accepted the widely-held view that in both verses the relevant Vorlage had a form of the root rdCac (yrCw and wyrc, respect- ively), which is either the verb meaning "to be evil, bad" and, in the hiphcil, "to harm", etc., or a by-form of rdsas. I noted that "forms of rCC are very frequently translated by forms of the stem xaxo-" in the LXX. Further, the LXX's xatLd (vxeTo in Ezek. xix 7 appears to link the verb with rch, and so to imply the presence of r where the M.T. has d. Pp. 153-4 also questioned the value of a variant reading of the Palestinian Christian Aramaic lectionary (which is derived from a Greek Vorlage, namely, the LXX) in Job xxi 9 (cp. Thomas, JTS 36 [1935], p. 412). 2 See E. C. Ulrich, The Qumran Text of Samuel andJosephus (Missoula, 1979), p. 75. Cp. P. K. McCarter, I Samuel (Garden City, 1980), p. 129. 148</page><page sequence="5">THOMAS'S THEORIES ABOUT YADAC That leaves the rendering 7Iat8Eu9eO.Aev ouv in Hosea vi 3, where the M.T. has wenedecd (Thomas, JTS 38 [1937], p. 405). This translation is usually ascribed to Quinta, but Barthelemy has argued that it is, in fact, from a later Greek version based on Jerome. Where the M.T. has wenedeCd nirdepa lddacat 'et-yhwh, the Vulgate has "sciemus sequemurque ut cognoscamus Dominum". If Barthelemy is right, how is the Greek rendering to be explained? The verb ydC is used twice in the Hebrew, but Jerome introduces variation into his translation by using different Latin verbs, and presumably the person responsible for the Greek wished to do the same, although we do not know his rendering of the second verb. If he was looking for a verb with a meaning resembling "to know" for one of the translations, he may well have chosen 7Itat&amp;us6oLat, which can come close to the desired meaning in some contexts. I am grateful to Dr G. I. Davies (who also drew my attention to Bar- thelemy's article) for comparing tva rcat8u0oat in 1 Tim. i 19, which is translated in, for example, the Revised Standard Version as "that they may learn". Another possibility to be considered (if, after all, the rendering in Hosea vi 3 is based on the Hebrew) is that it is to be explained in a way similar to that underlying the rab- binical use ofysr to render ydC, which will be considered below. 2. The Syriac version Pp. 154-5 of my article discussed several verses in the Peshitta. Although Thomas does not claim support from Job xx 26 and xxxv 15, they contain the kind of evidence that he might well have used. There is no need to repeat what I wrote about Job xx 26, but an addition can now be made to my remarks on xxxv 15. The reading mk', "harms", where the M.T. hasyddac, might at first sight seem to support Thomas's understanding of the Hebrew verb in some contexts. I argued, however, for the priority of the other Syriac reading mb's, and pointed out that b's is often used to translate Hebrew rCC, and that the Peshitta probably presupposed that the Hebrew here wasyrc. Fresh information about the manuscripts of the Peshitta of Job is now available in The Old Testament in Syriac II la (Leiden, 1982), where we learn that the reading mk' is found in the Buchanan Bible and manuscripts related to it, but in none of the manuscripts written before the 12th century, all of which have mb s. Another verse in the Peshitta to which Thomas, surprisingly, 149</page><page sequence="6">J. A. EMERTON does not appeal is Judg. viii 16, where wayyodac is rendered w'tnd, "and he punished, tortured". This translation should probably be regarded as an attempt to unpack the meaning of "and he caused to know, taught" in a way appropriate to the context, and it may be compared with a rabbinic interpretation discussed below. Thomas himself draws attention to two places in which the Peshitta has the verb zw', "to shake", where the Hebrew has, or may have been thought to have, ydc (JTS 36 [1935], p. 410): Judg. xvi 9, where it has wl' Zttzyc for welo) nodaC; and Isa. viii 9, where the Peshitta has zwCw, and Thomas thinks that dcw (cp. the LXX's yv&amp;Xr) is implied in place of the M.T.'s ro6u. The meaning "to know" is admittedly not found in either of these renderings, but they offer no direct support for the meaning "reduce to silence, make submissive" or "humiliate" and, in any case, little can be based on the uncertain text of Isa. viii 9. Further, Thomas sug- gested that one verse in the Peshitta testifies, not to the translator's understanding of Hebrewydc in the proposed way, but to a similar meaning of Syriac ydc (in addition to Ezra iv 13, which was con- sidered above). In Ps. cxix 158 the M.T. has wdaetqo.tdtd, and Thomas argued that the Peshitta's wydct "can hardly mean 'and I knew', but rather perhaps 'and I was quiet, submissive' (through vexation, grief)" (JTS, N.S. 15 [1963], pp. 56-7). This is scarcely sufficient evidence to establish a theory of a second Syriac root. Moreover, although the rendering is difficult to understand, it makes sense in the context: wydct dm mrk 1) ntrw, "and I knew that they had not kept thy word". 3. The Targums Thomas believed that he could claim the support of the Targum in several verses (cp. p. 152 of my article). At first sight, it seems that he has a strong case in Gen. xviii 21, where Onkelos has 'tprc, "I will punish", where the M.T. has 'eddcd; and he compares a Samaritan translation into Arabic by Abu SaCid (13th century) fol- lowed by the high priest Pinhas, which has x)qb with a similar meaning (JTS 42 [1941], p. 65). However, the interpretation of the rendering becomes more complicated when we look at it in the con- text of the verse as a whole and the attempts of the Targumists to understand it, as reflected in the different Targums and the variant readings. The verse expresses God's intention to visit Sodom and 150</page><page sequence="7">THOMAS'S THEORIES ABOUT YADAC Gomorrah to see whether the complaints against them are justified, and the meaning of the M.T. is adequately expressed by the Revised Standard Version: I will go down to see whether they have done altogether (kdld) accord- ing to the outcry (hakkesaciqdtdh) which has come to me; and if not, I will know. Unlike the M.T., which has the 'athnah under kdld and so attaches it to what precedes, Onkelos understands it to mean "annihilation" and takes it with what follows: kdld we)im-lo6' eddcd. The text of the corresponding part of Onkelos is given by Sperber as "byd Cmhwn gmyr' 'm tybyn w'm 1' 'tprc, "I will annihilate them [lit. make an annihilation with them]; whether they repent or not, I will punish." But Sperber also notes variant readings: his authorities J and L have: ...'m 1' tybyn w'm 1' 'tprc, "(I will annihilate them) if they do not repent, but if they repent I will not punish"; and c and A have: ... w'm tybyn 1' 'tprc, "(I will annihilate them), but if they repent I will not punish". The Palestinian Targums3 explicitly mention the possibility of repetance. Pseudo-Jonathan says that if they repent, then "it will be as if I did not know, and I will not punish" (km' dl)ydcyt wl' ytprC): God will overlook their evil deeds. The Fragment Targums and Neofiti also speak of God acting as if he did not know of the evil deeds, provided that the people repent; but they do not have wl) 'ytprc. The difficulty facing the Targumists was that the Hebrew appears to ascribe to God a lack of knowledge, which he must remedy by going to Sodom and Gomorrah to see for himself.4 Understandably, the Targumists sought to avoid the attribution of ignorance to God. It is difficult to know which is the preferable reading in Onkelos and to unravel precisely the history of interpretation that lay behind it. But it is clear that the Targumists produced a paraphrase rather than a literal transla- tion.5 It is scarcely legitimate to infer that the Hebrew verbydc was understood to mean "to punish". 3 See M. Ginsburger, Pseudo-Jonathan (Berlin, 1903); A. Diez Macho et al., Biblia Polyglotta Matritensia Series IV: Targum Palaestinense in Pentateuchum 1: Genesis (Madrid, 1988), and Neophyti 1 1: Genesis (Madrid and Barcelona, 1968); M. L. Klein, The Fragment-Targums of the Pentateuch According to their Extant Sources (Rome, 1980). 4 I am grateful to Dr S. C. Reif for stressing the importance of this fact. 5 See B. Grossfeld, The Aramaic Bible 6: The Targum Onkelos to Genesis (Edin- burgh, 1988), pp. 67-7. Although Grossfeld says that "the anthropomorphic term 151</page><page sequence="8">J. A. EMERTON The Samaritan rendering in Arabic6 to which Thomas refers must be approached in the light of the same problem, and should be compared with the Samaritan Targum. Tal gives two forms of that Targum in Gen. xviii 21. One type, represented by his manuscript J, simply reflects the Hebrew at the end of the verse: w'm 1' 'dch. The other, represented by manuscript A, has whn P' 'mrq, "and if not, I will cleanse". Tal notes variant readings for 'dCh in the former text: 'hkm and, in the margin of manuscript M, ['t]prc, which recalls the Targum of Onkelos. As Tal points out, Samaritan scribes knew and were willing to make use of Jewish sources, including Onkelos (vol. I, p. xii of the preface; vol. III, p. 30 of the English part). In view of the openness to Jewish influence and the exegetical problem of the verse, the value of the Samaritan evidence for Thomas's theory may be discounted. Two other verses in the Targums are cited by Thomas (JQR, N.S. 37 [1946-7], pp. 177-8): Judge. viii 16 and Ezek. xix 7. It is unnecessary to discuss the verse in Ezekiel further, because it was seen above that Aquila and the LXX presuppose a reading wyrc, and it may be suspected that the same reading lies behind the Targum. Judg. viii 16 tells how Gideon took the elders of Succoth and thorns and briars, and the M.T. says wayyodac bdhem 'et 'anse sukkot. Sperber notes several variant readings in the Targum's rendering of the verb: wtbr, "and he broke"; wgrr, "and he dragged"; wgryd, "and he scratched, combed"; and w lqy, "and he smote, punished". None of these verbs is used in verse 7, where the M.T. has wedasti, "and I will thresh", in Gideon's threat and the Targum has the Aramaic cognate w'dws; there has thus been no assimilation in the Targum of the description of the fulfilment of the threat to the original words of the threat. This verse in the Targum is relevant to the discussion below of the medieval Jewish commentators, and an examination of it will be postponed until then. 'know' of the Hebrew is rendered 'punish' in the Aramaic", it is clear that he is writing about a paraphrase, and there is no suggestion that the Targum is evidence for a Hebrew verb yddac with a meaning other than "to know". 6 Shehadeh, p. 75, gives Abu Sacid's translation as ))qb. On p. 74, however, he records the older Samaritan translation into Arabic as )lm (from clm, "to know"), although some manuscripts have C)qb. Abu Sacid believed that the earlier Arabic versions used by Samaritans in Egypt had been influenced by Saadia (Shehadeh, p. iii of the English introduction, and p. vii of the Arabic). The reading )Im may, therefore, be due to Jewish influence. 152</page><page sequence="9">THOMAS'S THEORIES ABOUT YADAC There remain two verses in the Targums to be considered, although Thomas does not claim them as support for his theory. The first is Ps. cxxxviii 6, where the Targum hasym'k, "he will humble, bring low", and where the M.T. has yeyeddc. It is the more surprising that Thomas failed to mention the Targum to this verse, since he pointed the Hebrew verb here as a piCel meaning "'he causes to be submissive', i.e. he humiliates" (JTS 36 [1935], p. 410), and discusses the rabbinical interpretation of it (JQR, N.S. 37 [1946-7], pp. 177-8). This translation will be considered below in section IV of the present article. The other passage is mentioned by Liebreich (p. 338), who points out that the M.T.'s lo#yddaCti in the Song of Songs vi 12 is represented in the Targum by 1' Zwsyp Imkykynwn w p 1) )byd Cmhwn gmyr'. As Liebreich says, this Targum "is characterized by its homiletic and paraphrastic approach", and the last three words quoted above are borrowed from Onkelos in Gen. xviii 21. It would be inappropriate to regard so free a version as direct evidence for Thomas's theory. Rather, as Liebreich implies, it should be seen against the background of rabbinic inter- pretation ofydc in general, which will be considered below (though it will not be necessary to refer again to this verse). III Thomas argued in several articles, especially in "Some Rabbinic Evidence for a Hebrew Root yd = wdc", JQR, N.S. 37 (1946-7), pp. 177-8, that his theory could derive support from some medieval Jewish scholars, either because they attributed an appropriate meaning to yddac or because at least they knew of such an inter- pretation. I listed the rabbis and the relevant interpretations of yddac on pp. 151-2 of my article. Thomas believed that "Jewish tradition appears to have preserved a reminiscence of a root ydc distinct from ydc 'know'" (p. 177). The medieval Jewish writers mentioned by Thomas (and there is no need for the present purpose to consider those of a later date) are Rashi (1 th-12th century), Ibn Ezra (12th century), and David Qimhi (12th-13th century). Liebreich added to the list Saadia (9th-10th century), Judah Hayyuj (10th century), Jonah ibnJanah (10th century), Menahem ben Jacob ibn Saruq (10th century), and Solomon ibn Parhon (12th century); Yalon added Moses ben Isaac ben Hannesiah (12th-13th century); and I added Moses ben Shesheth (probably 12th cen- tury), and noted (pp. 146, 152) that in 1685 Edward Pococke 153</page><page sequence="10">J. A. EMERTON referred to Nathan ben Jehiel (12th century) and Tanhum of Jerusalem (13th century). The Hebrew verbs most commonly used to explain the meaning of yddac in some contexts were sdbar, "to break", and yasar picel, "to discipline, chastise". One of Thomas's examples must certainly be rejected. InJTS, N.S. 15 (1964), p. 55, he appeals to Ibn Ezra's comments on the last two words of hammaCtiq hdrim welodydddaC in Job ix 5. Thomas comments "God, through earthquake, or by lightining, or by some other means, dislodges great boulders from the mountains, which are thus disturbed out of their usual static state. It is in this sense that Ibn Ezra interprets welJ)ydddaC (Cd snhpkw 'until they are over- turned')." Thomas seems to have confused Ibn Ezra with Rashi, and also to have misunderstood him. When Rashi writes wl'ydcw Cd snhpkw, he probably begins by quoting the biblical text and then expands its meaning, not offering a gloss on the meaning of the verb: "'and they do not know' until they have been overturned". Far from offering support to Thomas, Rashi understands the verb to mean "to know". How is the rest of the rabbinical evidence to be evaluated? The writers maintain that yddac sometimes means "to break" or "to discipline, chastise", rather than "to know". As we have seen, Thomas believed that the rabbis had preserved a tradition going back to ancient times. Others have explained the evidence dif- ferently. Reider holds that the tradition was not ancient, but that "when the medieval Jewish grammarians and commentators rendered the passages in question in this way, they did so by instinct and common sense, because the context requires it, and not because of comparative linguistics. After all, they were concerned chiefly about the sense of the text, and the sense required in all these places [i.e., for Reider, Judg. viii 16; Isa. liii 3; Ezek. xix 7; Ps. cxxxviii 6; Job xxi 19; Prov. x 9] is 'to break, to crush"' (p. 315). Reider's reference to "comparative linguistics" is irrelevant to what Thomas claims, for Thomas regards the medieval rabbis as transmitters of an ancient tradition and does not suggest that they explained the Hebrew yddac by comparing it with Arabic waduCa. Reider's main point, however, is that they were guided by the needs of "the sense of the text", and he recognizes that the mean- ing "to know" does not fit all the contexts. It can scarcely be con- tested that they were concerned to explain yddac in a way appropriate to the context. But it is doubtful whether their view that 154</page><page sequence="11">THOMAS'S THEORIES ABOUT YADAc yddac could sometimes be paraphrased by sbr orysr can be explained solely from the needs of the context. Indeed, earlier on the same page he notes that the medieval rabbis were acquainted with the meaning "to break" in the Targum (presumably in Judg. viii 16). It seems, then, that Reider's view is that the rabbis were guided both by a knowledge of the Targum and by the needs of the context. Liebreich, whose article was known to Reider, refers to "render- ing by the context" (p. 339), but in addition he finds the origin of the tradition in the Targum's rendering of wayyodac by wtbr inJudg. viii 16, and he believes that the rendering derives from a Hebrew text with wyrC instead of wydc. Johnstone (pp. 60-1) follows Liebreich who traces the tradition back to the Targumic rendering of Judg. viii 16. Further, he takes up the point made by Liebreich that the extant passages of Saadia all ascribe toyddac the meaning "to know, understand". According toJohnstone, "Had the Arabic root wdc possessed the appropriate sense [i.e. the sense postulated by Thomas], one would have expected it to be used by Saadia where ydc in the alleged meaning occurs" (pp. 61-2). This state- ment assumes that, if the alleged meaning existed in Arabic, Saadia would not only have known it but would have used it in translating yddac in the relevant verses. If, however, the Hebrew verb was thought in Jewish tradition to mean "to break" or "to discipline, chastise", it is doubtful whether it would have been translated by wdC, even if it was cognate with the Hebrew. While Johnstone has successfully refuted Thomas's view of the meaning of the Arabic verb, this particular argument is open to question. In seeking to evaluate the evidence of the medieval Jewish scholars, two questions must be distinguished. The first is whether the tradition was derived from the reading wtbr in the Targum to Judg. viii 16, and the second is whether that reading was based on a Hebrew text that had wyrC where the M.T. has wydc. First, the Targumic reading wtbr was certainly known to be rabbis-it is, for example, quoted by Rashi and Qimhi-and the Hebrew cognate sbr is sometimes used in comments on ydc. It is therefore clear that this rendering in the Targum played a part in the commentators' understanding ofyddac. It may not, however, have been the only influence. Thus, Qimhi's discussion of Ezek. xix 7 mentions the Targum's rendering of wydc by w'sdy, says that it gives to the Hebrew verb the meaning sbr whrbn, and compares 155</page><page sequence="12">J. A. EMERTON Judg. viii 16. Nevertheless, the frequency of the references to the passages in Judges by the rabbis, and the fact that the Targum's reading there is so close in meaning to sbr suggests that it, rather than the Targum to Ezek. xix 7, was the primary influence. Menahem ben Saruk, one of the earlier rabbinic authorities quoted by Liebreich, cites four verses in the relevant part of his dictionary dealing withydC (Judg. viii 16; Ps. lxxiv 5, xc 12, cxxxviii 6), and suggests four meanings: gdC wspl wsbr and, in Ps. xc 12, tysr for the M.T.'s hodac. The theory that the meaning "to break" was derived from the Targum's wtbr would account, not only for Menahem's sbr, but probably also for gdc if the precise choice of the word was determined by the needs of the context of Ps. lxxiv 5. The use of ysr will be discussed below. The meaning spl was probably intended for Ps. cxxxviii 6, and it is interesting that the sense is similar to that of the Targum's rendering of yeyeddc by ym'k. On the other hand, none of the medieval commentaries that I have consulted refers to the Targum to Ps. cxxxviii 6. Thus, the Targum to Judg. viii 16 certainly influenced the medieval view thatyadac could some- times mean "to break", and it provides an adequate explanation of its origin, although the Targum to Ezek. xix 7 may have played a subsidiary part in the process. Although the Targum to Judg. viii 16 can account for the fact thatydc is sometimes glossed by sbr, a different explanation is prob- ably needed for the paraphrasing of its meaning byysr, even though the two verbs are at times used together. Such an explanation is offered by the rabbis themselves. Thomas draws attention (JQR, N.S. 37 [1946-47], p. 177) to Ibn Ezra's comment on Ps. cxxxviii 6: mit yydc ylmdnw dct syysrnw, which he translate "the word yydc teaches us that He will discipline us". Ibn Ezra then compares Judg. viii 16; and it may be added that Rashi too gives yydc the menaing yysr and compares the same verse in Judges. Thomas regards Ibn Ezra's comment as support for his theory, but it is more likely that it explains yydc in terms of knowledge. Although Thomas understands mit to be the subject of ylmdnw, the noun is feminine but the verb is masculine. Further, the word dct has no separate counterpart in his translation, for "teaches us" is apparently intended as an adequate rendering of the two words ylmdnw dct. Yet the presence of dct in the interpretation of the cognate verb that normally means "to know" must surely have a point that deserves to be brought out in translation. It is more likely 156</page><page sequence="13">THOMAS'S THEORIES ABOUT YADAC that the verb ylmdnw does not have mlt yydc as its subject, but is, with dct, Ibn Ezra's gloss onyydc: "[as for] the wordyydc, [it means] teaches us knowledge..."; and the knowledge that it teaches is "that he disciplines (or, chastises) us". We may compare Ibn Ezra's comment on Prov. xiv 33, where we find Judg. viii 16 explained shwdyc ps'yhm bqwsm, "that by means of the thorns he caused them to know their transgression". The same explanation is found in Qimhi's comment on Judg. viii 16. In other words, he taught them a lesson; and we may perhaps compare the colloquial English expression "that'll larn you". Neither Ibn Ezra nor Qimhi uses ysr here, but we have seen that the former employs the verb in his comment on Ps. cxxxviii 6. Secondly, how is the reading wtbr in the Targum to Judg. viii 16 to be explained? It is an attractive theory that it originated in a Hebrew text with wyrc, as Liebreich and Johnstone suppose (whether or not that was the original reading in the Hebrew)-and the letters daleth and resh were easily confused. Aramaic tebar is used to translate Hebrew rdCac in the Targums inJer. xv 12; Ps. ii 9; and Job xxxiv 24. Further, it was argued above that the Targum's w'sdy in Ezek. xix 7 probably goes back to a Hebrew original with wyrC (so Aquila and the LXX). It is not so easy to account for ym'k in Ps. cxxxviii 6 in the same way. Qimhi records that some commen- tators understood yeyeddc to meanysbr on the basis of Judg. viii 16, and it is perhaps conceivable that the Targum'sym k (which Qimhi does not mention) reflects an extension of the same idea, but such an explanation is speculative. So too would be the suggestion that the translation is an extension of the thinking that led to the equa- tion of ydc with ysr. The question must be left open. In any case, as we have seen, there is no evidence that the Targum to Ps. cxxxviii 6 played any part in the discussion. It is a pity that we do not have more evidence of Jewish exegesis in the centuries immediately preceding the tenth. On the basis of the available evidence, however, it is possible to claim that the meaning "to know" was found unsuitable by medieval rabbis in some contexts, that the meaning "to break" (sbr) was derived from the Targumic reading wtbr in Judg. viii 16, and that the meaning "to discipline, chastise" arose from exegesis of the hiphcil of yddac in the sense of "to cause to know, to teach". Contrary to the claim of Thomas, there is no reason to postulate any additional tradition about the meaning ofyddac. 157</page><page sequence="14">J. A. EMERTON IV What is to be said about the passages in the Hebrew Bible in which Thomas claimed to find the meaning postulated by him for ydC? Not all his examples appeared convincing to me in 1970, but there were some for which his suggestion seemed the best working hypothesis. That, of course, was on the assumption that Thomas's understanding of the Arabic was soundly based, and that Hinds had confirmed it in part. Now, however, Johnstone's more detailed study of the Arabic evidence has shown that Thomas misunderstood it. As a result, it is necessary to look again at the relevant verses in the Hebrew Bible. Johnstone's work would, indeed, be compatible with a theory that Hebrewydc sometimes meant "to be quiet, at rest", but mere comparison with the Arabic would not suffice to establish such a theory. Thomas's argument was founded on verses in which ydc was alleged to mean more than simply "to be quiet", and such a meaning plays only a subsidiary part in his publications. The verses in which Thomas found the meaning "to be quiet" or the like are 1 Sam. vi 3; Isa. xv 4; Jer. xiv 18; Ps. xxxv 15; Job ix 5, xx 20, xxxvii 7; Prov. v 6, ix 13, x 21; Eccles. x 20. In several of the verses the text has to be emended (Isa. xv 4; Job xxxvii 7; Prov. x 21); and we have seen that the Hebrew underlying the LXX and Targum of 1 Sam. vi 3 was probably different from the M.T., and that his interpretation of Ibn Ezra's (really Rashi's) comment on Job ix 5 seems to be based on a misunderstanding. An examination of the relevant verses has convinced me that, although the meaning "to be quiet" would fit them, such a meaning is nowhere demanded by the context. Nor is is likely that a satisfactory alternative theory can be derived from the alleged fundamental meaning of wadaca, namely, "to leave" (true though that theory may be). Thomas himself sug- gested that a related meaning was present in Jer. xxiv 1, but he did so only by emending mucddim to muddcim, "set" (JTS, N.S. 3 [1952], p. 55), and the suggestion was made against the background of the assumption that it had been demonstrated that Hebrew ydc sometimes corresponds in meaning to Arabic wdc. In JJS 6 (1955), pp. 50-2, Thomas drew attention to the inadequacy of M. D. Goldman's theory in the Australian Biblical Review 3 (1953), pp. 46-7, that Judg. viii 16 means "and he had the men of 158</page><page sequence="15">THOMAS'S THEORIES ABOUT YADAC Sukkoth laid (or put) in them". "It may be felt", wrote Thomas, "that it is a somewhat weak description of what was evidently a severe form of punishment". He also questioned Goldman's use of the same meaning in Arabic to explain Isa. liii 3; Ezek. xix 7; Zech. xiv 7; Eccles. x 20. It is unnecessary to work through all Thomas's examples, and only those that seem the most important will be examined here. Before they are discussed, however, it is desirable to recall how Thomas originally approached the problem. His first article on the subject began with the words "The Hebrew root ydC 'to know' is very perplexing" (JTS 35 [1934], pp. 298-306). He then discussed the root and argued on the basis of an Arabic rootydc that the first radical of the Hebrew verb "to know" was historically y, not w. Some Hebrew forms however (e.g. the hiphcil) imply a root begin- ning with w, and Thomas argued that probably "bothydc and wdc were current side by side" (p. 298). He observed that Arabic wdc had a meaning which made sense in some verses of the Hebrew Bible where "An examination ... leads to the belief that the transla- tion of the English Versions 'know' is erroneous" (p. 301). It would be an over-simplification of Thomas's method to say that he started with an Arabic root and then looked for biblical verses into which the alleged Arabic meaning could be read. It is an essential part of his argument that the meaning "to know" does not fit some contexts in the Hebrew Bible. He noted that exegetes had found difficulty with the text of several of the verses he dis- cussed (Judg. viii 16; Jer. xxxi 19; Prov. x 9, xiv 33), and that emendations of various forms ofydc had been proposed. Instead of emending the text, he offered the alternative theory that there was a secondydc in Hebrew, which was derived from a root *wdc, not *ydC. He was thus dealing with some verses in which there are, or are believed to be, difficulties that could be solved by his theory. Judg. viii 16 has played a prominent part in Thomas's discussion ofydc, and it seems best to begin with it. He believed that wayy6dac meant "and he made quiet (submissive)". He probably intended to stress the element of submission, although "submissive" was placed within brackets in his first article on the subject (p. 305), for it is unlikely that he supposed that Gideon's unpleasant form of punishment was meant to cause no more than quietness. Indeed, one suspects that Thomas may rather have been thinking of "humiliated", a verb that he uses on the same page of ydc in 159</page><page sequence="16">J. A. EMERTON another verse. If his theory about the verb must now be rejected, what account is to be given of wayyodaC? The rabbinic idea that he "taught the men of Succoth a lesson" cannot, perhaps, be dismissed as impossible but-to adopt Thomas's words about Goldman's theory-' it is a somewhat weak description of what was evidently a severe form of punishment". Another suggestion men- tioned above is the theory of Reider, followed by Johnstone, that wayyodac is an error for wayyaroac, "and he broke". It would proba- bly, however, be better to read the hiphcil of the other raCac, namely, wayydrac. The text would then say that Gideon harmed the men of Succoth. On the other hand, some scholars emend the text to wayyddos, "and he threshed", and appeal to the LXX (in both its recensions) which uses the same verb as for wedast in verse 7. This emendation has the advantage of making the verb describing the fulfilment of the threat the same as in the threat itself. In either case, whether we emend wydc to wyrC or to wyds, we are faced with the need to alter the consonantal text, instead of retaining it as in Thomas's theory. Judg. xvi 6-9 tells of the failure of Delilah's first attempt to learn how to overpower Samson: he easily broke the seven fresh bow- strings with which he had been bound. At the end of verse 9 come the words welo nodac koho. In the Revised Standard Version this clause is translated "So the secret of his strength was not known", but Thomas objected to renderings of this kind because they add to koho something not found in the Hebrew, namely, "the secret of'. Although Reider does not discuss Judg. xvi 9, it would be possible to adopt his suggestion for several other verses that d is a mistake for r, and that the verb is rdCaC. If ndrac were read, the meaning would be "and his strength was not broken" or "suffered no harm"; such an emendation would presuppose that rdCac is a suitable verb to use with koah. If the text is not emended, perhaps nodac can be given the meaning "was understood" or "explained", and such an extension of the usual meanings is conceivable, although I cannot find a verse in the Hebrew Bible where precisely this sense is present (see p. 174 of my article of 1970). On the whole, that seems the best solution to the problem of this verse. Isa. liii 3 comes from an important passage, but widuac hol is not a serious problem, since the first word can be understood as a pcaul form meaning "knowing" (GK § 50f), or IQIsa's reading as an active particle (wywd) can be accepted. In verse 11, bedato is more 160</page><page sequence="17">THOMAS'S THEORIES ABOUT YADAc of a problem, because it is not clear what the Servant is supposed to have known (not even if 'wr is added after yr'h with IQIsa). Perhaps berdCdto, "in his misery", should be read; but this is a dif- ficult chapter, and beda'to is but one of a number of problems. Ps. cxxxviii 6 may be translated "For though Yahweh is high, he sees the lowly, and (or, but) he knows the proud from afar" (and there is no need here to discuss the unusual form of the verb yeyeddC). The sense seems to be that, though God is high (ram)- presumably in the heavens-and far from the world (mimmerhdq), he sees and knows both the lowly (sdpdl) and the proud (gdboah); and it is unnecessary to discuss here whether the verbs have overtones beyond the simple senses of seeing and knowing. Although I formerly favoured Thomas's theory about this verse, I now see no difficulty in understanding yeyeddc to mean "knows" (and there is certainly no need to follow Reider and emend it to ydroaC). According to Prov. x 9, "He who walks in integrity walks securely (betah), but he who perverts his ways will be known (yiwwddeaC)". The problem is the verb yiwwddeac, for it is not clear how "will be known" fits the context. The RSV translates the word "will be found out" presumably meaning that the fact that he acts perversely will be discovered. It is questionable, however, whether "will be found out", even if it is a legitimate paraphrase of "will be known", gives an adequate parallel to the first half of the verse: while all goes well with the good man, it is said only that the bad man will be seen for what he is, not that he will be punished (con- trast verses 7-8, 10). The RSV's rendering may be possible, but it is not free from difficulty. A number of commentators emend the verb to yeroac (cp. yeroac in Prov. xi 15, xiii 20), the niphcal of rc, to mean "will be broken" or "suffer harm". This gives a sense that seems preferable to the explanation of the verb as a form of "to know". Though the emendation is not certain, a good case can be made for it. The niphcal of ydc is also found in the M.T. of Prov. xiv 33: "Wisdom rests in the heart of a man of understanding, and (or, but) it is made known (tiwwddeac) in the midst of fools". It is unlikely that wisdom would be said to be made known (or make itself known) in the midst of fools, which is the last place one would expect it. It would be possible to to make sense of the M.T. if the second half of the verse were a question expecting a negative answer ("is it known in the midst of fools?"), but such a way of 161</page><page sequence="18">J. A. EMERTON understanding it is improbable, for we do not expect a question in this type of proverbial saying. Some seek to solve the problem by adding the negative particle lo', on the basis of the LXX and the Peshitta which have a negative. Thus, the RSV has "but it is not known in the heart of fools". The sense is better than that of the M.T., but it is necessary to add a whole word-and the translators responsible for the LXX and the Peshitta may well have added a negative precisely in order to make the proverb intelligible. A smaller change to the text would, once again, be to postulate a cor- ruption of r to d, and to read teroac: wisdom "suffers harm" or "injury" in the midst of fools. An examination of some key verses for Thomas's theory thus leads to the conclusion that there is no difficulty about under- standingydc to mean "to know" in Isa. liii 3 and Ps. cxxxviii 6, and also in Judg. xvi 9 if nodac can mean "was understood" or "explained", and that emendation of d to r-to give a form of the root rCC-offers a solution to the problems in Judg. viii 16; Prov. x 9, xiv 33, and perhaps Isa. liii 11. Thomas sought to solve the problems without emendation by postulating a second root ydc. While the possibility of such a root cannot be disproved, Johnstone's work has deprived Thomas's theory of an essential part of its foundation, and it would not be justified to postulate a second root without such support. Thomas's theory must be abandoned, but a refutation of it does not solve all the problems. There remain verses in which the meaning "to know" is difficult or at least raises doubts. The difficulties which Thomas sought to remove by postulating a different root, and which others have tried to solve by emendation, have not disappeared.
