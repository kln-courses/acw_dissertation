'^^K^.^^^B f| a^a^aW^ ^nF^SBa^B^Bi I U On Scientific Blindness... We ding to images that do not match our reality... Cornelia Hesse-Honneger, 1997 One of the failings of contemporary Western culture is its inability to see its own dependence on the natural environment and the extensive degradation that our 'culture of consumption' is having on it. Today, immersed as we are in our much-cel ebrated age of information and technology, we barely perceive that the "earth is dying under the assault of scientific objectivity"1. Instead we behave as if we were blind to the effects that our modern lifestyle is having on the natural world, Yet the continuing reports of an immi nent ecological crisis suggest we need to re examine why many of us fail to perceive and react to changes in the natural environment In the art world, a heightened sense of perception is at the basis of most creative endeavours and artists have long reflected aspects of nature back to the greater society, However the prospect of producing works about nature that comment on contemporary environmental concerns is extremely challeng ing. Although in everyday use, the term 'nature' is now recognised as a complex and elusive idea. Ever since the sixties, there has been a growing realisation that ideas of'nature' are often construed to endorse the politics of a given society, Since then a growing body of discourse in response to the ecological crisis has emerged in many disciplines, though informed critical debates on the subject are still surprisingly recent The cultural theorist Kate Soper suggests that we must develop new ways to negotiate and envision nature: What is really needed, one might argue, is not so much new forms of awe and reverence of nature, but rather to extend to it some of the more painful forms of concerns that we have for ourselves. The sense of rupture and distance which has been encouraged by secular rationality may be better overcome, not by worship ping this nature that is 'other' to humani ty, but through a process of re-sensitisa tion of our combined separation from it and dependence upon it2 One artist who challenges our trust in the scientific view of the world is Cornelia Hesse Honnegen That "the real work of planet-saving will be small, humble and humbling" is a phrase that comes to mind when examining her work. Her exquisite painting, Harlequin Bug, 1995, one would think, is hardly likely to chal lenge our view of the natural world. But when we examine the accompanying caption, which describes that this leaf bug is deformed, and was collected along with many others in the vicinity of nuclear power plants across Europe and the United States, we pause to consider what this image is communicating. Here, and in a series of other equally unsettling but com pelling works which present similar findings, is a visual account that something is horribly awry in the insect world, and by inference, in our larger world, Hesse-Honnegers uniquely chilling paint ings of nature are a far cry from much con temporary art that references nature. Work that does refer to nature is often problematic, as discussed by the critic David Reason: A work that sits easy in the mind, that delights us with no trouble, is probably preaching to the converted - in other words, it is at home amid our shared ^?^?W?^?^?^l^iiJ.M:-?^- Jj^B^B^B^B^M I mm ^^B mMm^^mMmf^':''^^^M^BmMmMmMmMmMMmm ' I 18 Bpil Catherine Fitzgerald: installation view, RHA, 200G; courtesy the artist prejudices. Only when we are challenged by art are we helped to articulate, scruti nize and unpick what we thought we could take for granted. A lot of work that claims a concern with nature is so winsomely communicable that it tells us more about the art world than about its subject matter... Sentimental projection tells much more about the artist than about the putative subject matter.3 The convincing documentary style of Hesse-Honneger's paintings draws upon her long experience as a scientific illustrator as evi dent in Harlequin Bug, and the many other paintings and statistics that make up her two widely acclaimed touring exhibitions, Nach Chernobyl [After Chernobyl] and Future's Mirror. When Hesse-Honneger's working practice evolved out of training as a scientific illustrator, which she began in 1961, she never ques tioned the scientific view of the natural world. l:%As she puts it, "I had always relied on the 26 CIRCA 96, Summer 2001 "\ 1</page><page sequence="2">knowledge of the biologists to explain how a plant or animal should look; they, I thought, knew about nature."4 So for twenty-five years, Hesse-Honneger, trained and initially employed by the Zoological Museum at Zurich University as a scientific illustrator felt comfortable in the scientific community and gained a considerable reputation in that area. By using a microscope, she carefully recorded, with drawing and watercolour techniques, the physical effects of scientific experiments on fruit flies, Drosophilae, the insects chiefly used in biological sciences because their fast reproduction rate allows sci entists swift identification of experimentally induced changes. (Interestingly, hand-painted illustrations and drawing are often more valid than photographs in this area, as at such mag nification cameras cannot adequately focus simultaneously on all the details of an insect as the human eye can.) Yet eventually, while creat ing these scientific images, Hesse-Honneger became aware of the conventions of the scien tific view of the natural world. Hesse-Honneger relates incidents during her career that illustrate the politics that bind scientific representation. When she coloured in the background behind her illustration of mutated insects she provoked highly unfavourable reactions from scientists. Another time she was asked to modify one of her illustrations to more adequately support the experimental data. These and other similar incidents led to her growing realisation that the scientific view was often formulaic and direct ed primarily to fulfil the aims of specifically funded projects. Hesse-Honneger's height ened awareness of science's often limited views no doubt occurred because she literally worked at the boundaries between art and science. Paradoxically, in Hesse-Honneger's attempts to reveal shortcomings about the scientific view it is her back ground that lends a potent scientific legiti macy to her art. It also cre ates an inter esting tension in whether such work should be cate gorized as art or science. Her approach is reminiscent of the writer and scientist, Cornelia Hesse-Honneger: Harlequin bug (Pentalomidgae) Deformed scutellum &amp; patches not symmetrical. Found near Three Mile Island Plant 1991,42 x 29.7cm; courtesy the artist Rachel Carson. Carson's moving book, Silent Spring (1962), published over thirty-five years ago, first alerted western society to effects of pesticides, a view that served as a touchstone to raise ecological consciousness amongst the general public. Similarly Hesse-Honneger is acting as an eyewitness to the often forgotten dangers of the nuclear industry. That she has found statistically significant evidence of the effects of low-level radiation contamination in insects from the most notorious nuclear sites across Europe and the USA, including Chernobyl, Sellafield and Three Mile Island, reveals the extent of the complacency of the scientific community and the dangers we face if we blindly accept such technology. However the controversy that surrounds these sites is not new. Continually, research has been pro duced that reveal dangerously high levels of contamination produced by these plants, as in the case of Sellafield, where recently a Greenpeace report revealed that the Irish Sea bed is so heavily contaminated that it could almost be classified as nuclear waste.5 But perhaps, as one scientist has admitted, Hesse-Honneger's paintings are able to touch us in a manner that statistics cannot do; they "leave behind a loud and clear signal that something is desperately wrong."6 Hesse Honneger seems to be aware of this herself when she says that "scientists who acknowl edge that there is the possibility of a link between radioactive pollution and leukaemia Cornelia Hesse-Honneger: Laboratory Flies, Heads, 1967, 42 x 60cm; courtesy the artist tend to explain things in a lengthy and com plex manner;their language is hard to read..." Elsewhere she has commented that she believes "that we cannot really see something that has not been painted or put into artistic form. It simply does not exist until then."7 Since beginning these works, Hesse-Honneger has realised that these relatively straightfor ward artistic methods can articulate, not only the blindness of the scientific community but the general blindness that prevents society from seeing the ecological degradation that is occurring around it Similarly, the artist, histori an and cultural theorist, James Elkins, in his extensive studies of seeing and blindness, has made some interesting comments on the value of drawing to overcome blindness. For Elkins, "drawings are a place to observe the exchange between seeing and blindness and to meditate on the ways that blindness threads its way through vision."8 Hesse-Honneger through her work, seems to have achieved that and much more. Hesse-Honneger's work has been primarily to raise concern about the effects of low-level radiation on our environment, and she has suc ceeding in creating considerable debate about the issue. Even though the scientific communi ty has questioned her methods, widespread public response has directed some investiga tion into technologies previously thought to be relatively benign to the surrounding environ ment Furthermore, Hesse-Honneger's research offers wider insights as to why our society is blind to environmental concerns. She demonstrates that valuable results can be gained from an interdisciplinary approach, which she believes should be encouraged in schools from an early age. Hopefully, the radi ation damage that has caused genetic distur bances in the leaf bugs that Hesse-Honneger has depicted in her book, The Future's Mirror (1997), will not be, as she fears, "the future aesthetic of nature." Challenging Scientific Representations Environmental problems are very much linked to our own problems, and our methods of representing nature. Mark Dion 1994 Amidst growing ecological concern, dismantling cultural representations of nature has gained much agency in the last few decades. These challenges to scientific dogma thereby suggest that many view the ecological crisis fundamen tally as a crisis of culture. While literary investi gations into the culture of science are ongoing, it is of interest to find that visual responses to these concepts are being created. In the instal lation works created by Mark Dion, an inter esting array of visual challenges to scientific representations of the natural world can be found. Since Dion's work directly responds to the recent cultural discourse on nature, it is not surprising that he, like a few others, "deals with nature more as an issue than a subject."9 We find in Dion's work not only an interest in visu alising the politics of science, but also that of natural history and the more recent environ CIRCA 96, Summer 2001 27</page><page sequence="3">mental movement, which he believes often limit our awareness of the real extent of the ecological crisis. Dion's work reveals a fascination with tax onomy and other systems that science has used to seek an ordered view of the natural world. He frequently inserts unexpected items into a taxonomic framework to unsettle our secure assumptions. Dion reflects that as we "approach the next century we are still bound by aspects of 19th century science that insist on studying things in divisions... the idea that nature can be sliced up and pigeonholed in this way is something that still holds sway."10 For Dion, this divisionist view of nature "suffo cates the possibility of developing a fluid, inter connected view of knowledge" of our environ ment." Dion has approached these ideas in very diverse and memorable ways. His installation, Taxonomy of Non-endangered Species, from his Extinction, Dinosaurs and Disney, 1990, series, uses popular-culture animal figures to convey his ideas. Here, the most universally recog nized animal icon of popular culture, Mickey Mouse, is made to represent the persona of Baron Cuvier, the man chiefly responsible for the taxonomic method. Creating an audio Mark Dion: Taxonomy of Non-endangered Species, 1990, mixed media installation, 89 x 150 x 250 cm; courtesy the artist track from the Baron's writings, and using a soft-toy version of Mickey Mouse, Dion places Mickey, halfway up a ladder to face the viewer, as if he is in the middle of discussing his taxo nomic work. Mickey, a,ka. the Baron, seems to have been busy and, on shelves above, to have carefully preserved with alcohol in specimen jars other well known popular soft animal toys. Snoopy, the Pink Panther Big Bird, Garfield, Woody Woodpecker etc., as Dion's work points out, are the "preserved, non-endangered animals" in contemporary life. The tragedy in our society is that these 'non-endangered' rep resentations will endure whilst the survival of many real birds and animals is increasingly under threat. The strength of the Taxonomy of Non endangered Species work lies in the paradox that Dion sees existing within culture and nature. It reminds us of the irony that exists in contemporary culture that continuously per sonalises and romanticises animals without a thought to the destruction of their habitats. For beneath the humour Dion's juxtaposition of popular-culture 'animals', set against the his tory of taxidermy, reminds us that any benign image conveyed by soft-toy 'animals', which incidentally reaches its ultimate state of com mercialism in the world of Disney, alternatively denies and reveals much about our current relationship to the natural world. In this and other works Dion's visual subtext on the com mercialism that comprises society's distorted view of nature also reveals how nature is pre sented to future generations. While flesh and blood experience with the animal world is diminishing, we are inundated with surrogates broadcast over every imaginable media, configured in every shape, and made out of every imaginable material from blue plastic to polyester fur to gold. What child of the West does not grow up with a crib and toy chest lined with anthropomorphic beasts! Animals do not speak back to us, either from the other side of the tele vision screen, or from behind the bars of the zoo or through the button eyes of a teddy bear. Rather, they are often ciphers bearing our own anxieties, fan tasies, and assumptions about ourselves and the natural world.12 And it is also worth remembering, that fashions like dinosaur mania, symptomatic of our consumer society, are often created by designers and artists. Another theme that Dion puts forward in his work is that science, and the institutions that deal with the natural world, including some environmental groups, are often highly uncritical of their own discourse. The seeming ly 'objective and rational' method of presenting scientific knowledge, Dion feels, is dangerously limited and denies other interpretations. It is here that Dion believes that art has an advan tage over science, with its rich set of tools that include allegory, metaphor parody, and irony. And though these tools are common to litera ture, Dion's visual practice collapses many ideas to produce images that are relatively easy to understand and remember as is evident in the work described. In this instance, visual art practice simply and effectively extends over and above what literature can only illustrate with theory. While Dion's works have generally been considered successful and timely, one critic has asked a particularly pertinent question: what should we do with this deconstructed knowl edge?'1 Dion's view is that we need to disman tle old representations in "the hopes of con structing new ways of adequately imagining future positions with regard to science and nature. In a sense, Dion's challenge is also that of the contemporary museum.":'; This is a fact that Dion is clearly conscious of when he has deliberately worked in museum contexts. His preference for installation work is also perfectly suited in these instances to the displays often associated with scientific exhibits. On other occasions he visually refers to the history of colonial politics of expedition scientists and explorers who endlessly collated specimens for western audiences. These politics significantly shaped early scientific practice and continue to affect our relationship to other cultures, species and environments. In a significant developing body of installation work, covering a wide range of strategies from the comic to the poetic, Dion continues to bring the viewers' attention to outdated, and often limited atti tudes and representations of nature. Presenting this brief review of Cornelia Hesse-Honneger and Mark Dion's work allows consideration of some of the complex issues that surround science, art and nature in con temporary society. While the approach of the two artists is widely different, their shared posi tion at the interface between art and science creates rich and thought-provoking work, the ultimate result of which communicates that artists can contribute in presenting challenging work that enables us to rethink our relation ship to our environment. Common to both of these artists is the centrality of questioning sci entific views of nature, a decisive stance when science and technology are highly valued and accepted in modern society. Such work that crosses the boundary between art and science also recalls the past history of the relationship between the two disciplines. It could be said that these two schools of thought have evolved contrasting ways to describe nature. And it is worth reflecting too that only five hundred years ago, during the Renaissance, art 28 CIRCA 96, Summer 2001</page><page sequence="4">was chiefly relied upon to describe the natural world, whilst now that role is almost com pletely eclipsed by science. Visual Art + Science = ? Scientists often admit that they are aware of difficulty in communicating their work and goals to wider audiences. Similarly the endeavours of contemporary art, at best, would appear to hold only a minor interest for the general public. Certainly in many instances both cultures occupy rarefied positions in soci ety whilst being caught up in widespread com mercialism, but at the heart of both endeav ours are common goals to impart greater understanding of ourselves and the world around us. A meeting between the two to rediscover the essential fundamentals they share, their strengths and their points of diver gence, is very likely to be mutually enriching. While not expected to create momentous events, new ways of thinking, could lead to improving the communication and creative endeavours of both cultures and perhaps dis mantle the unnatural, and sometimes illogical divisions that separate knowledge. Furthermore, with science occupying a domi nant place in contemporary society one can immediately think that the results of interdisci plinary methods, as in many other areas, will become increasingly valuable for opening up the debate around many recent scientific developments. For instance, on the eve of a genetic information explosion and with a new science that is lacking critical ethical, social and ecological dimensions, there is certainly a need for the humanities, including art, to engage in a debate that will ultimately direct the future of nature and which has consequences for all for life as we know it. And if a unique and well-attended meeting's hosted by the Irish Art and Science councils some months ago is anything to go by, there is a growing interest in creating a dia logue between the Art and Science communi ties. Comprising a diverse audience of scien tists, educators, policy-makers, artists, com posers, science and art writers, this event appeared to be following in the footsteps of several UK-based initiatives, the best-known being the Wellcome Trust SCIART awards, which has supported many collaborations between artists and scientists since 1996. Interdisciplinary interactions, though a recent enough phenomenon, are welt known in other arenas and perhaps reflect a desire for a more holistic vision of knowledge amidst our culture of endless information. While not everyone at this meeting suggested the collaboration between the two disciplines would always be of equal value to either party, there appeared to be a broad consensus that such exchanges, whilst not always predictable, may be of value in both public and private spheres. The relationship between the visual arts and sciences has reached an interest ing juncture.

Each year the SCIART awards have seen a growing number of collaborative projects being proposed and supported and a visit to their website (www.sciart.org') is a good introduction to the breadth and scope of some of the work that going on in this area. Recent developments have also seen the con sortium arrange two annual long-term residen cies for recent postgraduates. They offer signif icant financial support, access to scientific establishments, encourage exchanges with the public during the period, and conclude with an exhibition. The idea of creating residencies for artists in scientific institutions was also suggest ed at the Dublin meeting. And perhaps to highlight the activity in this area further; a new book. Strange and Charmed: Science and the Contemporary Visual Arts (2000), edited by Siin Ede, published by the aforementioned Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (who have also supported similar mixes of art and sci ence) is perhaps the most in-depth study of this trend in recent years. Another well estab lished event, which has been reviewed in CIRCA on several occasions, is the Ars Electronica festival (www.aec.at); held annually in Austria. Hosted in several sites near to the purpose-built Ars Electronica Center, on a larg er scale but with a similar philosophy to Dublin's Arthouse, the festival showcases lead ing international contemporary art and critical debates that focus on new developments among art, science, technology, and new media.
