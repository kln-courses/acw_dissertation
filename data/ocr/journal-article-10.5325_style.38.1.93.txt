Literary types may recognize in this involuted little title an allusion to “agen- bite of inwit,” the anguished refrain eddying in the stream of Stephen Dedalus’s  consciousness in Joyce’s Ulysses, archaic English for “remorse of conscience.”  Consciousness researchers may recognize a word that once designated conscious- ness as well as conscience (like the word conscience itself), noted in Antonio  Damasio’s The Feeling of What Happens (231-32). David Lodge is now a student  of consciousness as well as an authority on the novel, and a confessedly self- conscious (or “metafictional”) novelist himself, and his two latest books investigate  the conscience of consciousness studies—its “challenging consequences for those  whose assumptions about human nature have been formed by religious, humanist,  and literary traditions” (xi). Consciousness and the Novel (hereafter CN), titled  after its long lead essay, focuses on “How the novel represents consciousness; how  this contrasts with the way other narrative media, like film, represent it; how the  consciousness, and the unconscious, of a creative writer do their work; how criti- cism can infer the nature of this process by formal analysis, or the creative writer  by self-interrogation” (ix).1 In Thinks . . . (T), Artificial Intelligence expert Ralph  Messenger and novelist Helen Reed reflect privately on their experience with one  another, in the process fleshing out an introduction to “consciousness studies,” and  a concerned humanist response. Readers should be warned that this review reveals  important parts of the plot. Like the bifurcated dome of Ralph’s prestigious Holt Belling Centre for  Cognitive Science, the novel’s characters represent opposed hemispheres of the  brain, and echo the division of buildings on the University of Gloucester campus,  an “architectural allegory of the Two Cultures” (11). Ralph shows Helen a mural  illustrating milestone thought-experiments bearing on cognition and consciousness  (49-55), including Thomas Nagel’s “What is it Like to be a Bat?,” Frank Jackson’s  “Mary the Colour Scientist,” and Roger Penrose presiding over the mysterious fate  of Schrödinger’s Cat in its cabinet. It’s a fine moment. Such scenarios are cartoons  distorted to make subtle conceptual points. They are dramatic in a way, and seem to  Style: Volume 38, No. 1, Spring 2004 93 </page> <page sequence="2"> 94 Michael Sinding invite a visual rendering to accompany reflection.2 They are a characteristic staple  of analytic philosophy, which at its best, as in Daniel Dennett’s prose, is breezy,  cocky, sparkling, ingenious (though at times erring on the side of cute). This cre- ative in-joke propagates others. Helen has her fiction class compose parodies of  Nagel and Jackson in the style of well-known novelists. We get first-person bats  à la Martin Amis, Irvine Welsh, Salman Rushdie, and Samuel Beckett; then later,  Mary à la Henry James, Gertrude Stein, and Fay Weldon. Do these parodies prove  anything? According to Ralph, no: the bats are “hopelessly anthropomorphic” (97)  and the Marys “don’t begin to address” her serious philosophical point (170). Ac- cording to Helen, they produce insight if not proof. Like thought experiments, they  are fictions aimed at a point, but a different point: they “defamiliarize something  we take for granted, [. . .] which is what good writing always does” (170). Lodge  seems to see “defamiliarization” (invented by the Russian Formalists he admires)  as a first stage in a common literary-philosophical enterprise: seeing something  anew, or reframing, to use the cognitive term. Consider that reframings abound in the strange and difficult science of con- sciousness, shaking up habits of thought dictated by lazy or moribund metaphors.  Consider too that the mural suffers a conspicuous absence of Dennett. It is in- complete without some space for the author of Consciousness Explained. But that  space might include Robyn Penrose, a character invented by Lodge, whom Dennett  credits with scooping his theory of self:  This idea, the idea of the Self as the Center of Narrative Gravity, is [. . .] certainly an idea  whose time has come. Imagine my mixed emotions when I discovered that before I could  get my version of it properly published in a book, it had already been satirized in a novel,  David Lodge’s Nice Work (1988). It is apparently a hot theme among the deconstructionists:   According to Robyn (or, more precisely, according  to the writers who have influenced her thinking on these matters), there is no such  thing as the “Self” on which capitalism and the classic novel are founded—that is  to say, a finite, unique soul or essence that constitutes a person’s identity; there is  only a subject position in an infinite web of discourses—the discourses of power,  sex, family, science, religion, poetry, etc. And by the same token, there is no such  thing as an author, that is to say, one who originates a work of fiction ab nihilo. [.  . .] in the famous words of Jacques Derrida [. . .] “Il n’y a pas de hors-texte,” there  is nothing outside the text. There are no origins, there is only production, and we  produce our “selves” in language. Not “you are what you eat” but “you are what  you speak,” or, rather “you are what speaks you,” is the axiomatic basis of Robyn’s  philosophy, which she would call, if required to give it a name, “semiotic material- ism.”  Semiotic materialism? Must I call it that? Aside from the allusions to capitalism and the  classic novel, about which I have kept my counsel, this jocular passage is a fine parody of the  view I’m about to present. (Like all parody, it exaggerates; I wouldn’t say there is nothing  outside the text. There are, for instance, all the bookcases, buildings, bodies, bacteria . . .)  Robyn and I think alike—and of course we are both, by our own accounts,  fictional characters of a sort, though of a slightly different sort.  (Dennett 410-11) Lodge uses metafictional devices modestly, within the realist frame he favors. To  </page> <page sequence="3"> Inwit of Inwit 95 paint himself into this picture might be too gratuitous for that modesty. The twist:  Helen asks if Roger Penrose is any relation to Robyn, slated for a lecture visit.  Ralph asks, “who’s he?” (54), though his Dennettian thinking could mark him as  a brain-grandchild of Robyn’s. Her repeat performance as “one of those Theory  people” (224) reveals to Helen the sinister kinship . Parody helps articulate the  dialogue that is one kind of key to these books: Lodge reframes Dennett’s refram- ing of Lodge’s reframing of poststructuralism.3 Literary engagements with cognitive science have flourished in analyses of  literary form and reading.4 They have not yet strayed far into the appealing terrain  of “consciousness studies,” which is richly interdisciplinary, attracts some of the  best thinkers on the planet, and contains dizzying new vistas on the mind-body  problem.5 Both Lodge’s novel and his essays are oriented to literary topics, especially  the history and theory of the novel. Almost equally important is how the conjunc- tion illuminates controversies over the nature of self, soul, and character. Such an  intersection of concerns demands a complex evaluation. It is remarkable that even  with a thriving second career as a novelist, even after retiring from academia, Lodge  is still visiting new intellectual frontiers. He is a sure and clear guide to the roots of  consciousness studies, its major figures and debates, and the quality of these books  should effectively publicize these topics and spark further inquiry. He speaks to an  educated but nonspecialist audience. hence brain science and philosophical issues  appear in broad strokes rather than in tiny pixels of technicality. It could fairly be  said that he breaks new ground not in the accepted terms of either literary studies  or consciousness studies, but in successfully articulating questions, problems, and  responses worth pursuing concerning the relation between them. The essay says  little about current approaches to the novel, but it does throw light on Ian Watt’s  classic account of its relation to the shift of cultural attention towards individual  self-consciousness, upon which critics continue to rely. Lodge newly contextual- izes recent fiction in the history of literary efforts to portray consciousness.6 And  his sense of the limitations of scientific efforts does clarify literature’s purpose and  value. Judgments about Lodge’s suggestions for consciousness studies will depend  on opinions about its goals, priorities, methods, and theories.7 With all these good points, I regret that both books lack an intermediate or  synthetic perspective. There is little sense of the significant conflict within con- sciousness studies itself between those who say that consciousness/self/soul is an  illusion (“you’re nothing but a pack of neurons”), and those who insist that they are  real. Bernard Baars’s highly influential theory even rejects Gilbert Ryle’s oft-cited  critique of “ghost in the machine” notions of self/soul: “‘I’ seem to have access to  perception, thought, memory and body control. There is now a body of evidence  that supports this commonsense belief. Self and consciousness seem to be mutually  necessary systems” (“Theatre” 307).8 Portents of collaboration in antihumanism  between poststructuralism and cognitive science are not offset by promises of a  humanist rejoinder from the latter to the former. True, there are nods to a spectrum  </page> <page sequence="4"> 96 Michael Sinding of views (CN 15, 112), and a premature effort to be representative can drain the  drama from the novel’s conflict. But the resolution loses an opportunity. “Literature  constitutes a kind of knowledge about consciousness which is complementary to  scientific knowledge” (16): the lesson is balance, not how they might cooperate or  profit from one another. No theory or character really shares both cultures.9 Background Lodge says names always signify something, even if it is only John-and-Mary  ordinariness.10 His co-protagonists are baptized for onomastic contrast: “Ralph” is  blunt and inelegant; intimates drop the first-person-friendly forename, and “Mes- senger” evokes his aggressive style of speech and argument—all reference and no  sense, so to speak. “Helen” is synonymous with beauty (“the face that launched  a thousand ships”); “Reed” connotes greater flexibility, musicality, and literary  vocation (“read”). Contrary to the associations of his own name, however, Lodge  has never stuck in one place, but keeps moving with intellectual currents. Daunting  as it is to size up such a reader and writer, one can contextualize the new work by  tracking continuities and shifts in his thinking. Lodge’s constant study has been the poetics of fiction—“a systematic and  comprehensive description of the stylistic devices and narrative methods through  which novels communicate their meanings and have the effects that they have upon  readers” (CN ix). Language of Fiction (LF), Working With Structuralism (WS),  Modes of Modern Writing, and After Bakhtin (AB) are touchstones of theory-practice  integration, still used in graduate study (Language of Fiction was republished in  the Routledge Classics series in 2001). Lodge’s commitment to extraordinarily  clear, painstaking, yet graceful illustrations and evaluations of complex ideas, and  to the writer’s perspective, contributed to his departure in 1987 from an academy  submerged in poststructuralist jargon.11 The Art of Fiction and The Practice of Writ- ing (PW) aim, more journalistically, to “demystify and shed light on the creative  process, to explain how literary and dramatic works are made, and to describe the  many different factors, not always under the control of the writer, that come into  play in the process” (PW ix). As a novelist (since 1960), Lodge acknowledges powerful influences in Ev- elyn Waugh, Graham Greene, and Kingsley Amis. This “antimodernist” tradition  champions robust, well-crafted realistic narrative in a plain style. He is distinctive in  using “elements of modernism and postmodernism” apparently inspired by Joyce’s  technical experiments (WS 16), and in exploiting the inherent excitement of ideas  and their psychological and social life to supply narrative interest and momentum.  If there is one technique on which Lodge’s comedy has always thrived, it is the  double-edged irony produced by balancing incongruous points of view. Small World  captures this in the phrase “mutual misapprehension” (239). A particular episode  shows how it informs situation as well as speech, and how it dovetails with Joy- cean parody of myth using realistic plots. It also foreshadows the satirical interest  </page> <page sequence="5"> Inwit of Inwit 97 in cognitive science. The loathsome Robin Dempsey is forever feeding bile about  Philip Swallow into a computer running ELIZA, an early AI program that uses  psychotherapeutic bromides to mimic conversation. The programmer tells Robin  ELIZA can’t really answer, is “not a bloody oracle” (243). The scene shifts to Philip  visiting the site of the Delphic oracle, where the oracularly named Sybil Maiden  hints that he may get a prestigious chair in literary theory, but warns about “know- ing thyself” and losing thyself. The next scene jumps back to Robin, aghast when  ELIZA also prophesies Philip’s victory (thanks to the programmer [247]). Similar  moments of “he said/ she said” comic irony in Thinks . . ., are especially pointed,  given the “problem of other minds.” Ralph misreads the signals Helen intends. He  thrills at the hot tub garb she chooses for its discouraging dullness (148, 145); he  notices she has cleaned for his visit but supposes the knickers she overlooks are  meant to entice him (180, 176). The novels flow so briskly that we can make the  required leap of memory even when greater narrative distance separates accounts. Recent novels qualify the comedy. We have less of the brisk, summery carnival  driven by the wide cast of caricatural characters (as in Small World), and fewer  implausibly impeccable place/time coincidences (as in the “Legionnaire’s disease”  scare saving Rodney Wainwright at the podium from 223 pages of writer’s block  [306]). The tone is more complex, tempered by darker, more private themes (ag- ing, illness, depression, grief) and forms (fewer characters, more introspection).  (“Readability” is not lost: Therapy makes light of existential depression.) Lodge  continues to explore the poetics of the novel from within, experimenting with  point of view, tense, genre and style. As before, mutual misapprehension shades  into mutual modification of attitudes. This is clear with the Zapps and the Swal- lows in Changing Places, and Robyn Penrose and Vic Wilcox in Nice Work, but  in Thinks . . ., modification is uncertain, and the final separation is less ambiguous  and amicable than elsewhere. This context makes it natural that Lodge should take to consciousness studies.  Yet the result is surprising: further novel criticism, and an unprecedented amount  of research into an unfamiliar field.12 Consciousness and the Novel  The title essay is divided into three main sections. The first, “Consciousness  and the Two Cultures” considers two kinds of interdisciplinary connection, which  help explain why we have and value literature, and how it works. One connection  emphasizes differences between literary and scientific discourses. The quest to  explain consciousness scientifically seems mired in paradox: how to give a third- person account of a first-person phenomenon (11)? Literature seems to overcome  the dilemma. It is “a record of human consciousness, the richest and most compre- hensive we have. Lyric poetry is arguably man’s most successful effort to describe  qualia. The novel is arguably man’s most successful effort to describe the experi- ence of individual human beings moving through space and time” (10). Science  </page> <page sequence="6"> 98 Michael Sinding can only describe qualia in a third-person correlation of first-person reports. But  lyric poetry uses the technique of metaphor: “by describing each quale in terms of  something else that is both similar and different [. . .] the object and the experience  of it are vividly simulated. One sensation is invoked to give specificity to another”  (13). Science can only present historical experience in terms of abstract laws that  lose its density and specificity. But narrative literature “creates fictional models  of what it is like to be a human being, moving through time and space. It captures  the density of experienced events by its rhetoric, and it shows the connectedness  of events through the devices of plot” (14). The skeptic will deny this overcomes  the limitations of other first-person reports (“partial, imprecise and relative to [. .  .] personal context” [11]). Widespread individual experience is not objective in the  required sense. Vividness and richness are irrelevant to what philosopher David  Chalmers calls the “hard problem”: that is, why and how non-material conscious- ness should exist at all in a material universe. As Chalmers says, “In addressing  the philosophical mysteries associated with conscious experience, a simple color  sensation raises the problems as deeply as one’s experience of a Bach chorale” (11).  Color-blind Mary can read reams of poetry about redness and still not know redness. The second connection emphasizes agreements with science, exploring the  debt to literary concepts of recent scientific work stressing the narrative character of  consciousness. Dennett claims that we tell stories, especially about who we are, to  create and protect selves. Damasio sees the brain’s intentionality, its “aboutness,” as  rooted in storytelling. Consciousness implies a self, but in its stream the “core” self  changes, while the “autobiographical self” persists. Damasio is “more conservative,  and to a humanist more congenial,” siding with the tradition that “consciousness is  an ‘inner sense’.” The “scientific rejection of this [homunculus] model should not [.  . .] entail the total rejection of the idea of the self.” Despite the limits to the unified,  continuous, single self, “the tendency toward” it “and its advantage to the healthy  mind are undeniable’” (15). Lodge’s eye is on the language: “the word ‘healthy’ in  this context [. . .] bypasses the usual opposition in the consciousness debate between  ‘true’ and ‘false’” (15-16). This is an advantage, not an evasion: the self may be  “the supreme fiction, the greatest achievement of human consciousness, the one  that makes us human” (16). He goes on to show that even novels about scientific  knowledge provide “personalistic” knowledge, analyzing potential experience. The second part of the essay, “First Person and Third Person” begins with V. S.  Ramachandran’s claim that the “need to reconcile the first person and third person  accounts of the universe [. . .] is the single most important problem in science” (28).  The novel’s powerful representation of private life can seem objective, as a narrator  can take a third-person perspective on a character’s first-person consciousness, but  Lodge admits this is specious. Still, “we read novels like The Wings of the Dove  because they give us a convincing sense of what the consciousness of people other  than ourselves is like. We feel we have ‘learned’ something from them; we have  acquired new information” (30). We get more than platitudes about human life,  </page> <page sequence="7"> Inwit of Inwit 99 more than a reflection of ourselves, more even than the virtual experience of another  consciousness. Rather, as Milan Kundera says, fiction “compensates us” for the  lacunae in the narrative structure of our memory, and even our present perception;  it “allows us vicariously to possess the continuum of experience in a way we are  never able to in reality” (qtd. 32). Literature not only illuminates experience, it is  a special kind of experience itself. How does prose fiction create that illusion? Lodge’s answer emphasizes the  development of “a technique known as free indirect speech” or style (37). He  touches on cultural and biological aspects of the question. Watt’s Rise of the Novel  describes the Cartesian philosophical background: “Phenomena such as memory,  the association of ideas in the mind, the causes of emotions and the individual’s  sense of self, became of central importance to speculative thinkers and writers of  narrative literature alike” (40). Privacy challenges both. Evolutionary psycholo- gists speculate that human storytelling grew out of the capacity to imagine another  person’s thoughts by running hypothetical scenarios. Similarly, in recognizing that  others can have other interpretations, children acquire a “Theory of Mind.” Perhaps  the novelist’s ability to create “characters often very different from themselves,  and to give a plausible account of their consciousnesses, is a special application of  Theory of Mind. It is one that helps us develop powers of sympathy and empathy  in real life” (42). Archetypal novel themes of the contrast between appearance and  reality, and the progress from innocence to experience, turn on this capacity for  privacy and deception. Early novelists developed various realist techniques: Defoe’s and Richardson’s  first-person narrators created “realism of presentation,” Fielding’s third-person  narrators created “realism of assessment,” but it was impossible to combine these  effects until the discovery of free indirect style, “which allows the narrative discourse  to move freely back and forth between the author’s voice and the character’s voice  without preserving a clear boundary between them” (45). Lodge surveys the evolu- tion of this and related devices in Jane Austen, the Victorians, Henry James, and  the modernists. He finds intriguing conceptual echoes: James created character by  trying to enter into another’s consciousness; Woolf campaigned for recording the  stream of consciousness. His scrutiny of Ulysses, often judged the greatest render- ing of consciousness, shows how formal analysis of technique can help grasp the  content of such representations of qualia: Joyce creates the illusion of representing what Virginia Woolf called “the quick of the  mind” partly by a technique of condensation. Since we know that our thoughts are faster  and more fragmentary than any verbal articulation of them, to present the interior mono- logue in well-formed sentences [. . .] would be much less expressive. Throughout Ulysses  Joyce represents the stream of consciousness by leaving out verbs, pronouns, articles, and  by leaving sentences unfinished. Bloom registers “an old woman peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane.”  Why does the nonce word </page> <page sequence="8"> 100 Michael Sinding seem such a vivid and exact description of a common phenomenon? Because the word  actually mimes what it signifies: the two key words are ‘flattened’ against each other to  create the synaesthetic image.  (53-54) The essay’s third section, “Surface and Depth” considers why the first-person  has recently become the “dominant narrative mode for literary fiction” (53). The  Victorian realist novel concentrated on objective surfaces. Modernist reaction  sought to render the world from the inside. Freud’s discovery of the unconscious  encouraged this trend, and he has surprising support from some neuroscientists.  But modernism foundered in the attempt to depict “parallel” thoughts. The pun  comes closest to “mimicking the simultaneous input of heterogeneous information  which is the normal state of consciousness before the mind takes up the task of  selecting and articulating some of this information verbally.” Joyce’s wordplay in  Finnegans Wake may be the closest approximation of the “complexity of the brain  activity that goes on just below the surface of the self-conscious mind.” (Den- nett sees the mind as Pandemonium: many demons shout at once, competing for  dominance.) But without “the narrative cohesion which makes stories intelligible  to us,” we have no novel (63). Postwar, postmodern authors react again, favoring  surface over depth: “There is a return in their novels to objective reporting of the  external world, and a focus on what people say and do rather than what they think  and feel” (64). Hence cinematic techniques develop. The fictitious autobiography  or confession has now become the most common kind of first-person novel, but it  still adheres to surfaces, as it were. In an uncertain world, this may seem the only  authentic expression of consciousness (87). But postmodern thinking generally  rejects any “authentic” self/soul/human nature, as does the influential eliminativist/ reductionist view in consciousness studies: The idea of the person, whether in real life or in fictional representations, has come under  attack from both the humanities and science in recent times. There is, for instance, a certain  affinity between the poststructuralist literary theory that maintains that the human subject  is entirely constructed by the discourses in which it is situated, and the cognitive science  view that regards human self-consciousness as an epiphenomenon of brain activity.  (89) Running through the books is a strain of hope for the soul—perhaps for dualism, “if  making any distinction between mind and body is dualism” (T 318). Lodge shows  how the soul persists in the literary imagination, and suspense builds as literary and  moral issues line up alongside cognitive and metaphysical ones. But he argues on  pragmatic rather than theoretical grounds, issuing a warning about consequences: One must concede that the Western humanist concept of the autonomous individual self  is not universal, eternally given, and valid for all time and all places, but is a product of  history and culture. This doesn’t, however, necessarily mean that it isn’t a good idea, or  that its time has passed. A great deal of what we value in civilized life depends upon it.  We also have to acknowledge that the individual self is not a fixed and stable entity, but is  constantly being created and modified in consciousness through the interaction with others  and the world. It may be, therefore, that every time we try to describe the conscious self we  misrepresent it because we are trying to fix something that is always changing; but really  we have no alternative, any more than the physicist has any alternative to bringing about  </page> <page sequence="9"> Inwit of Inwit 101 the collapse of the wave function when he makes an observation, or the deconstructionist  has any alternative to using language which she claims is bound to undermine its ostensible  claims to meaning.  (CN 90) This thinking may carry little weight with persons uncommonly hard of head.  For overzealous reductionists, the objections will be a little too oblique, and not  especially original or convincing. First, we are not necessarily stuck with the ideas  about minds and selves embedded in our habits of thought and speech. Second,  some of the moral consequences that follow from rejecting the self may be welcome  (not all of “civilization” is good).13 Neither argument trumps science, anyway. But  Lodge’s ideas deserve careful consideration, and we can unfold them more fully.  The general point seems sound. Galen Strawson agrees that the novel may  well be “the most powerful tool we have for the recording and examination of  consciousness” (“Mind’s”). Literature is about conscious experience, this medium  of human life, more than it is about any part of it; and more than any other form  of discourse is. Literature as a whole charts the geography of possible experience,  exploring its heights, depths, and breadths, capturing its qualities, drawing on them  for meaning and form. Pleasure and pain correlate in certain ways with events of  triumph and failure to structure works and genres. We must imagine what it’s like  to be Dante to see the Divine Comedy tracing his enlightenment and liberation by  progressing through Inferno to Paradiso. But what can we do with this conviction? How can we evoke and use what  literature has to tell us about consciousness? I suggest four (very general) ways to  develop Lodge’s ideas, taking Paisley Livingston’s view that criticism can “serve  to challenge and to refine, to complexify and perfect hypotheses within the other  anthropological disciplines” (260).  1. Examine how literature can capture, convey and intensify conscious expe- rience. Wallace Stevens says poetry is “one of the enlargements of life,” capable  of “subtilizing experience and varying appearance” (viii). Others see “epiphany”  (Joyce), “aesthetic bliss” (Nabokov), or “peak experiences” (Northrop Frye) as  central. Consciousness research might speak to the theory that we respond imagi- natively to art via “simulation” (Gregory Currie). How does simulation become  vivid? What is the role of metaphor, or synaesthetic devices that “mime what they  signify” as Lodge says? 2. Many investigators want to describe more rigorously “the structure of human  experience itself” (Varela 31) as much as account for the brute fact of it. “Neuro- phenomenology” may study nuances of aesthetic, moral, and spiritual savour and  significance.14 Since self and consciousness seem to be interdependent, the same  narrative data can be relevant to analyses of the self and of experience. Thinks .  . . balances two forms of narrative self-representation, spontaneous stream-of- consciousness recording and reflective autobiography. These perspectives seem  complementary. Ralph sees value in trying to capture the stream of consciousness,  despite the risks:  </page> <page sequence="10"> 102 Michael Sinding The object of the exercise being to try and describe the structure of, or rather to produce a  specimen, that is to say raw data, on the basis of which one might begin to try to describe  the structure of, or from which one might infer the structure of [thought . . .] Of course this  experiment is hopelessly artificial because the decision to record one’s thought inevitably  determines or at least affects the thoughts one has [. . . A]ll these things I would normally  do without thinking, I would do them “unconsciously” as we say, but this morning I’m  conscious of them because I hold a taperecorder in my hand [. . .].  (1-5)  Such records can be informative, if we correct for the distortion created by the  media of representation and the act of representing.15 Ralph begins haltingly, trying  to think in academic prose, then wanders as he relaxes. Distortion may increase  with artfulness, but the highly-crafted Ulysses, for example, offers its own excep- tional insights. Helen’s journal doesn’t try to capture the stream of consciousness;  but it represents another natural view of the self, as an autobiography-in-process,  focused on the contents of consciousness, processing events in relation to a certain  self-concept and its emotions, beliefs, desires and memory. We may consider generally how various rhetorical techniques portray various  aspects of experience and the self, highlighting certain qualities and supporting  certain views. For example, Strawson finds Joyce’s heavily punctuated Stephen  Dedalus more suited to the “gappiness” of experience than the unpunctuated Molly  Bloom (“Self” 422). Different kinds of literature will open windows into differ- ent aspects of experience: the realistic novel into quotidian experience, Romantic  poetry into extraordinary feeling and imagination, autobiographical novels for  autobiographical memory, “stream of consciousness” novels for mental “drifting,”  and so on. Some authors describe unusual mystical or drug-induced states (Blake,  Huxley), or the experience of reflexive consciousness itself (Stevens, Beckett). 3. Use accounts of literary narration to critique philosophers’ “literary” analo- gies. Dennett has two related literary theses. First, there is “no single, definitive  ‘stream of consciousness’” because no Cartesian Theater with a Central Meaner  audience. Rather, “specialist circuits try, in parallel pandemoniums, to do their  various things, creating Multiple Drafts as they go.” Most drafts briefly, invisibly  modulate activity, but some get “promoted to further functional roles” as circuits  compete and cooperate, guided by genes and culture, to shape a mind (253-54).  Second, the Self is a Center of Narrative Gravity, a construct abstracted from the  stories we tell about ourselves; hence a fictional character (ch. 13). Lodge argues more effectively in the second essay, “Literary Criticism and  Literary Creation.” For Dennett, “all thought is produced through a process of expan- sion, editing, and revision, like a literary text, although unlike literary creation it is  so fast that it seems experientially to be instantaneous” (CN 111). Lodge counters  with a quotation from neurobiologist Gerald Edelman: “We cannot construct a  phenomenal psychology that can be shared in the same way that physics can be  shared” because “consciousness is a first person matter,” always unique because  conditioned by history, but “never self-sufficient,” and “always in dialogue with  some other, even if that interlocutor is not present” (qtd, 113).16   </page> <page sequence="11"> Inwit of Inwit 103 The challenge gains bite from Lodge’s anti-poststructuralist insistence on how  communicative intention structures his fiction-making: “It is impossible for me to  imagine doing all that work without mentally projecting its effects upon an imagined  other who is the implied reader of my text, as I will be to him its implied author”  (LF 300).17 This clarifies the final lines of the first essay, which at first glance seem  to change tack curiously: My novels are the products of numerous revisions, and I know that I could have gone on  revising them indefinitely, but a published novel is simply more useful as information than  a collection of its various drafts would be, and certainly more useful than a novel which  is never published because its author never stopped revising it.  (CN 91) Pushing the analogy suggests that the activities of consciousness come not only  from unconscious processes of reporting, revision, and editing, but also from com- municative desires, intentions, plans, and decisions which oversee the formation  of the message. These too may evolve and be revised, but multiple drafts tend to  succumb to final drafts. So a relation to addressees (perhaps hypothetical) bolsters  the autonomy of the narrating self. Dennett does speculate on how a broad top- down idea of a message vets bottom-up candidate expressions to narrow down into  something definite (ch. 8), but examples and analogies of fortuitous speech planning  (including literary ones) tend to undermine the Central Meaner. But Lodge’s ac- count of the composition process is richer than these hints and guesses. Of course,  Dennett might reply, “well, it’s not that much like novel-writing.” He may discard  and modify aspects of the analogy as he pleases. Perhaps fragmentary, multiple,  revisable states of content-discrimination are not much like everyday stories, never  mind literary ones. There is also room for a fuller exploration of what Dennett and others say about  the “extended” or “autobiographical” self as structured by its stories, a fiction but  not an illusion (CN 16). The argument that self and character are relative to the  modern West needs deeper, more careful analysis on both sides. Exactly what are  these Western concepts? What qualities are disputed (continuity, introspectability,  unity)? What are the alternatives (in other cultures, past and future)? We want a  noncaricatural model that will do justice to ourselves and to rich characters like  Odysseus and Leopold Bloom. Surely the truth lies in some combination of what  is “universally and eternally given and valid” and what “a product of history and  culture,” what “fixed and stable” and what “constantly being created and modi- fied.” Novelists and others have always known that the self is neither a pyramid  nor a sandstorm. 4. Use a novel’s analysis of characters to clarify the nature of the self. Litera- ture is very effective in elaborating and deepening “folk psychology.” Investigators  should consider these factors. For example: Thinks . . .  The novel explores the moral and social implications of beliefs about the human  </page> <page sequence="12"> 104 Michael Sinding soul and self. The critique of dogmas of consciousness studies is less overt than in  the essays, but perhaps more persuasive. The title challenges first-person experience  in two ways. Look at it as a revision of “I think, therefore I am,” and it implies the  first-person self is a conclusion that does not follow from a third-person premise:  “the brain in this body thinks, therefore ...”. Second, it imagines overcoming the  privacy of consciousness: what it would be like if “Thinks . . .” bubbles hovered  above people’s heads, legible by all. Ralph Messenger is a successful, happily married serial philanderer. He presents  the materialist view of the mind—based on Dennett’s, but lacking his playfulness.  The brain is like a parallel computer, running many programs at once. Hence the  rosy prospects for AI simulating human intelligence and even emotion (37-38). He  rejects “mysterianism,” the view that consciousness is “an irreducible self-evident  fact about the world that can’t be explained in other terms” (37), and “panpsychism,”  the view that consciousness accompanies any kind of information processing and  hence is “a basic component of the universe, like mass and energy” (97-98), and  he derides the “anti-functionalist” morals of the mural’s scenes. Certain remarks  point clearly to Dennett’s Multiple Drafts Model of consciousness: “every phrase  I utter, however fragmentary and inconsequential it may seem, is the output of a  complex interaction [. . .], consultation [. . .], competition [. . .], between different  parts of my brain [. . .]. It’s like a bulletin, an agreed text hammered out behind  closed doors after a nanosecond’s intense editorial debate, and then released to  the speech centres of the brain for onward transmission” (58). The self or soul is  a “virtual machine in a biological machine” (102), a software program running on  the hardware of the brain and body. When Helen challenges the claim that there  is no such thing, he replies with the theory that the self is a Center of Narrative  Gravity: “No such thing, no, if you mean a fixed, discrete entity. But of course there  are selves. We make them up all the time. Like you make up your stories. [. . .] It’s  one of the things we do with our spare brain capacity” (99). Helen mentions the  man with “locked-in syndrome”—a condition in which the body is almost totally  paralyzed while the mind stays conscious—who composed a book through a code of  eye-blinks. Ralph sees the heroism in this, but it is “still just information processing  by his brain. There’s nothing supernatural about it. No ghost in the machine” (100). Helen Reed, somewhat prim and precious, is also successful, but recently  widowed, and teaching creative writing as much to escape the memories that haunt  her London flat as to pay the bills. She speaks for Lodge to some extent, express- ing traditional humanist views, preferring to think that consciousness is a mystery  beyond human comprehension, not to be reduced to computation or biology, and  more the province of literature than science. She brings Ralph to concede that AI  seems a long way off, and that “for the time being we have to settle for knowing  less about consciousness than novelists pretend to know” (43-44). Ralph sets his  sights on Helen, but she resists his advances (almost) as much as she does his  arguments. The stakes are high: “Sometimes I think I’m struggling with Ralph  </page> <page sequence="13"> Inwit of Inwit 105 Messenger for my soul—literally, because according to him, it doesn’t exist” (178).  Their conversations carry them around campus, through dinner parties and hot tubs  and eventually, inevitably, bed. Helen sees herself in terms of literary characters: Richardson’s Pamela (177),  a Renaissance coy mistress (178), later Lady Chatterley (261). This is a stock story  of temptation of a pure female by a worldly male, and I expect Lodge is thinking  of the whole history of the romance novel here, from Richardson to Mills &amp; Boon  (the Harlequin of England). But he taps a deeper lineage, and resonance, by asso- ciating the contest with opposing cultural values. Ralph is classical: he looks like  a Greek god to his first lover (76), and like a Roman emperor to Helen (24). His  wife is “Junoesque” (207), and from the pinnacle of his brain-tower he records on  his “Olympus Pearlcorder” fantasies wherein winning the Nobel Prize blurs into  apotheosis (115), the destiny of classical heroes. Helen is associated with Christi- anity, specifically a Catholic upbringing she can’t quite renounce. While Ralph is  “hardwired for happiness” (213), Helen is given to depression and guilt. She approves  Freud’s remark that “Civilization is based on repression” (179), and cannot even  compose an unpolished e-mail. She’s surrounded with burial-and-rebirth imagery:  discovering Martin’s infidelity, “I felt stifled, trapped, like someone being nailed  into a coffin still alive” (194; also 31, 87, 202, 260). There is even a joke inserted  about the transition from BC to AD (137). Connecting the stock story to a battle  between Christian faith and pagan philosophy recalls Milton’s Comus—except that  Helen regains her soul partly by surrendering her body. The journals they both begin keeping (Ralph’s spoken, Helen’s typed) constitute  the bulk of the story. Ralph’s is a way of generating “raw data” that may contribute  to artificially simulating the structure of the stream of consciousness (idle, non- task-oriented thought). Helen begins diarizing as a kind of therapy: she is too dumb  with grief to write fiction at all, and can only handle a simple first-person journal.  Ralph is shamelessly horny. Helen is less fun: more conventional, and somewhat  wooden. She outlines her professional and personal experiences, including sights  seen and meals eaten, elaborating according to their significance for her. Lodge  sticks to the “rules of game,” presenting the characters’ minds from their own point  of view only. But of course his back-and-forth arrangement of them, for comparison  and contrast, generates the comic irony 18.  In the very middle of the novel, there is a  mutual discovery of their journalizing. Ralph soon makes a proposal more daring  and tempting than sex: he outlines the benefits of exchanging journals: if we do this we shall “know” each other more completely than lovers ever know each  other. They penetrate each others’ bodies to the depth of a few inches or so, with tongues,  fingers, etc, but we would get inside each other’s heads, we would possess each other as  no two people have ever done before. Doesn’t that idea excite you? (188) Helen refuses: ultimately I feel that the privacy of our own thoughts is essential to human selfhood and that  to surrender it would be terribly dangerous. We all have bad, ignoble, shameful thoughts,  </page> <page sequence="14"> 106 Michael Sinding it is human nature, what used to be called Original Sin. The fact that we can suppress  them, conceal them, keep them to ourselves, is essential to maintain our self-respect. It’s  essential to civilization. (189) Helen may flatter her own motivations here, but her reasoning is important. She sees  the capacity and privilege of secrecy and censorship as essential to the self, not a  mere hypocritical mask. The stream of consciousness is only a part of the self, not  more real than the whole. Helen identifies with this civilized “good copy” of herself,  whereas Ralph identifies with the notes and drafts composing the secret stream. With this in the background, they do commence an affair, but it is framed by  death. It begins when Ralph and Helen callously take advantage of Carrie’s visit to  her dying father; it ends after the shocking suicide of Ralph’s colleague “Duggers”  (after being caught downloading child pornography), and Ralph’s coincidental  “reprieve” from a potentially fatal liver condition. Their journals patch together a  composite perspective on these events, which sharply define the consequences of  their views of consciousness for their perceptions and behavior. Ralph immediately  runs to his Pearlcorder to celebrate his conquest. Helen can’t face her journal for  over a month, but when she does, she playfully writes of herself in third-person  fictional style, which signals some recovery from grief. When Ralph’s crisis strikes,  they reason differently: he calculates possible behavioral outcomes (295); she  imagines what it is like to be him (301). Separately, both decide to end the affair. Both decisions are crystallized by  intuitions of moral balance asserting itself in the universe: encounters with death  show that integrity of selves depends more on deep family relationships than on  passing private fantasies. But their interpretations and motives differ. Helen muses, Douglass’s suicide [. . .] put me into a state of fear and trembling. It opened up such an  abyss of unhappiness and wrongdoing and pain, into which it is so easy to fall once you  stop listening to your conscience. James has a fine sentence about illicit love somewhere,  one of the Prefaces I think, comparing it to a medal made of some hard bright alloy, one  face of which is somebody’s bliss and right, and the other somebody’s bale and wrong.      (331-32) Public exposure of private perversion is literally too much to bear, which starkly  illustrates Helen’s sense that loss of privacy can mean loss of self. It also shows  how much the self depends on its perception by other minds, and can be abandoned  and lost in private. Duggers’s mortal shame is an exaggerated form of the fear and  outrage Ralph and Helen feel when their journals are exposed. The strengths of  Helen’s melancholy temperament show the weaknesses of Ralph’s sanguine one:  she listens to her conscience, and “coming clean” with it helps her face death and  grief and betrayal because although she expects unhappiness she suspects “rebirth.”  While her discovery of Martin allows her to forget then forgive, Ralph’s discovery  of Carrie is part of what humbles him. Listening to his consciousness, he expects  victory and happiness, and he can’t stand the prospect of worldly failure and loss of  all that he “possesses” (Carrie, her money, the children, his social status), because  </page> <page sequence="15"> Inwit of Inwit 107 there is nothing more (294-97, 329). His repressed conscience returns as Duggers  is exposed and dies, while he regains health and privacy: In a way I almost feel as if he died instead of me . . . No, that’s silly, delete that . . . And  yet, if I were superstitious . . . if I believed in fate, providence, the stars . . . There was a  strange symmetry about yesterday evening, the way my reprieve arrived [. . .] at the very  same moment that catastrophe stared Duggers in the face.  (327) This is soon submerged in self-approving reveries: “I know [Helen] was amazed at  my self-possession last night, the way I went through the whole dinner as if noth- ing had happened” (330). The last chapter brings together the two perspectives,  with narration by an omniscient author in free indirect style that delves into both  minds while Ralph makes the move that destroys for good any hope of a continued  relationship—snooping into Helen’s journal. Let us expand on an observation by Lodge’s interviewer about the paradoxical  drive for both privacy from, and intimacy with, other selves (CN 292-93). Some  physical pathologies are recorded that can be seen as pathological extremes of these  opposed terms: too little or too much commerce with the outside world. Those  basic physical forms of self-distortion echo key features of the social self, which  has moral and psychological dimensions analogous to bodily experience. Hence  everyday versions of such distortion—personal isolation and violation—precipitate  the crises and resolutions of the story. Helen’s isolation parallels that of locked- in syndrome, and that of autism (no “Theory of Mind”). Her earlier depression  involved a profound isolation from the normal world around her, as did the intense  grief following the loss of her husband, aggravated by her discovery that he was  not what she thought. For Ralph, to “know” another person is to “penetrate” and  “possess” their consciousness, and knowing seeks to be as complete as possible.  He recognizes no real boundaries of soul or self, so he does not hesitate to violate  Helen’s private journal. The same blindness allows him to just shrug it off: “I  couldn’t stop myself” (T 337). He makes no effort at restraint because he doesn’t  believe in it. This violation is a minor parallel of the horrifying rape Helen reads  about. The victim survived by “‘separating her mind from her body as much as she  could’” (223). Helen also feels divided in various ways (17, 336). This suggests some general hypotheses about selves. It is often observed how  crucial the sense of a boundary is to the idea of self. The body is the chief boundary,  but we often speak and feel as if “our” boundaries extend or shrink, as when we  sense a texture through a pencil tip, identify with the car we drive, or disavow some  action (Dennett 47, 416-17; also Carter 216-21). Basic properties of the self can be  profoundly disturbed through distortions of body image.19 The novel suggests that  the extended self also has boundaries of some kind, related to but not identical with  the boundaries of the body or awareness, and shaped by social experience. People  naturally identify with their families, some of their property (homes, cars), their  social status and image, and of course their own thoughts and memories (e.g. in a  journal). For two people to “know” one another is for them to share their selves:  </page> <page sequence="16"> 108 Michael Sinding the more extensive the sharing, the better the knowing and the more emotionally  intense the relationship. Such confusion of boundaries is pleasurable or painful. It  can fail in various ways, and the failure can be comic misapprehension or tragic  aggravations of privacy or intimacy—isolations or violations. If either party (or  some outside cause) prevents or forces interaction beyond a certain degree, the self  may be distorted and harmed, temporarily or permanently. The mind can respond  by dissociating itself from body or past selves. So there must be a range of accept- able kinds and degrees of interpenetration with other entities. It is not such a leap  to suppose that body image could be the basis of a bodylike self-image, which lies  a little deeper than the conscious self, but can through it feel joy or pain, grow  stronger or weaker, be damaged or healed, by moral and emotional means. It is not  uncommon in psychology to speak of feelings of exposure/invisibility, diminution/ expansion, dissolution/reinforcement, devouring/rebirth of self. These body-based  metaphors for complex cognitive-emotional-physiological attitudes make intuitive  sense to us, as crucial factors in the constitution and working of the self. They  obtain whether we think in terms of self, soul, or other (again, it may be “healthy”  to consciously tend to it, whatever one’s religious belief). The idea needs work,  but it is important, and not dealt with much in the literature. These are not new facts about selves, but facts that we can confirm from our  own experience, newly organized and emphasized by dramatization. The novel  generates these insights persuasively by richly simulating the interplay between  private and social experience, and connecting common experience with extreme  cases and general ideas. It might refine our model of the self, and what that self  needs and wants and can tolerate.

There are phi- losopher’s zombies there, too. 3  Dennett’s views are very much his own, but it’s worth asking how that parodic  person Robyn may have influenced the working-out of details. 4  See the annotated bibliography on Alan Richardson’s Literature, Cognition,  and the Brain website, &lt;http://www2.bc.edu/~richarad/lcb/home.html&gt;. 5  Lodge’s citations list many major texts of the field. Other essential resources  are the Journal of Consciousness Studies, edited by Joseph Goguen, which has a  “Literature” issue (11, No. 5-6,2004); and the tomes of proceedings of the main  </page> <page sequence="17"> Inwit of Inwit 109 conferences, held in Tucson in 1994, 1996, and 1998, Toward a Science of Con- sciousness I, II, and III. The program for Tucson 2004 is online: &lt;http://conscious- ness.arizona.edu/conference/tucson2004/index.php&gt;. The journal Consciousness,  Literature and the Arts (general editor Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, &lt;http://www.aber. ac.uk/~drawww/journal/index.html&gt;) bills itself as “a forum for new work relating  the arts and literature to the exploration of consciousness currently flourishing in  many disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience,  computer science, and physics,” but it appears to operate on the taboo (or left) end  of the spectrum sketched in n. 7, below. 6  Galen Strawson’s just complaints about generalized “linear histories” (of  consciousness studies, postmodernism, etc.), are mitigated by Lodge’s introductory- interdisciplinary agenda (Strawson, “Mind’s”). 7  There is a “status” issue here. Literature is occasionally mined for hunches  and epigraphs, but humanists are marginal in the field. The Journal of Conscious- ness Studies devotes special issues to humanistic topics: introspection; first-person  and second-person approaches; models of the self; volition; action, intention, and  emotion; religious experience; evolution and morality; and art and the brain. But  editorials recognize that literature is on the far end of the “taboo” spectrum of  approaches, opposite the “kosher” disciplines of Philosophy, Neurobiology, and  Cognitive Science, parallel to Hermeneutics, Aesthetics, Religion, and Ethics—but  still further out than Botany (“Future”). Francisco Varela’s three axes of orientation  in the field correspond to the political spectrum: on the right is neuroreductionism  or eliminativism (e.g. Churchland, Crick); in the center is cognitive functionalism,  which attempts to integrate models of cognitive capacities into a unified framework  so as to account for experience (e.g., Baars, Calvin, Dennett, Edelman, Jackendoff);  and on the left, the view that first-person accounts are essential and experience  irreducible (e.g. Lakoff and Johnson, Searle, Globus, Flanagan, Chalmers, Varela  himself). 8  Even current AI projects recognize the need to build in some “self-system.”  See the inserts by Igor Aleksander and Jaak Panskepp in Carter (180-82, 186-88).  Of course these are a far cry from the traditional self. 9  Lodge notes that scientists often disapprove of poststructuralist uses of un- certainty, relativity, etc., citing the Sokal Hoax (CN 90-91), but omits mention of  the humanistic motivations of Sokal and others. 10  See, for example, the chapter on “Names” in The Art of Fiction (35-40). 11  The Afterword to the 1984 edition of Language of Fiction sums up Lodge’s  attitude to poststructuralism (286-300, 313). 12  Lodge said After Bakhtin would be his last book of “academic” criticism  (AB 8). He admits that for Therapy he read Walter Lowrie’s biography of Kierkeg- aard, then “only a few of his works, and skimmed through some others” (CN 269);  hence most of what he knows is in the novel. By contrast, the acknowledgements  for Thinks . . . cite over twenty books and articles on cognition and consciousness,  </page> <page sequence="18"> 110 Michael Sinding plus a TV series, a conference, and several academic advisors.  13  For example, Searle writes, “we continue to accept a traditional vocabulary  that contrasts the mental and the physical, the mind and the body, the soul and the  flesh, in a way that I think is confused and obsolete” (57-58). Strawson disputes  the idea (“The Self”). A justice of the Australian Supreme Court, David Hodgson,  discusses what reductionism implies for concepts of responsibility and justice. See  also Jaron Lanier and Tom Wolfe. Dennett claims “The moral arguments on both  sides of the issues of capital punishment, abortion, eating meat, and experimenting  on nonhuman animals, for instance, are raised to a higher, more appropriate standard  when we explicitly jettison the myths that are beyond protection in any case” (454). 14  Such studies tend to be less interested than literature in nuance. Varela ex- amines the sense of time, with its evanescent present moment, and “threads into  past and future horizons” (39).  15  A few pages before he quotes Lodge, Dennett imagines an improvement on  his earlier attempt to describe his stream of consciousness: “had the author [i.e.  Dennett] picked up a tape recorder while he sat rocking, and produced the text there  and then—it would surely have been quite different. Not only richer in detail, and  messier, but also, of course, reshaped and redirected by the author’s own reactions  to the very process of creating the text—listening to the actual sounds of his own  words instead of musing silently” (407). Carter describes Russ Hurlburt’s improve- ments in sampling. Subjects detailed their mental contents whenever a portable  bleeper went off (42).  16  Lodge sees an analogy between Edelman’s neurobiology and Mikhail  Bakhtin’s view that an orientation toward the addressee helps define the structure  and meaning of speech, and hence of literary works and genres. Cf. also Evan  Thompson’s view of consciousness as constituted by intersubjectivity.  17  This is part of Lodge’s rebuttal of Catherine Belsey’s poststructuralist cri- tique of “expressive realist” criticism in the LF Afterword. I infer that Belsey is an  ingredient in the discursive construction named Robyn Penrose. 18  The confessional journal is a venerable device of the novel, but this one  specially thematizes privacy. In Paradise News, a major plot shift is accomplished  when Bernard daringly leaves his private journal for Yolande to read, as a way  of explaining himself and expressing his feelings for her. In Therapy, Tubby’s  experiments in empathy, by writing from the first-person point of view of people  he knows, are suggested by his therapist, but the memoir of his first girlfriend is a  step towards becoming a more serious writer. 19  Ramachandran shows how distortions of body-image can lead to bizarre  misinterpretations of self-world relations (e.g. misattributions of body parts to  other selves). Rick Grush argues that spatial experience grounds the sense of self.  Lakoff and Johnson argue that the metaphoric system for inner life is based on a  distinction between a Subject ( “the locus of consciousness, subjective experience,  reason, will, and our ‘essence,’ everything that makes us who we uniquely are”),  </page> <page sequence="19"> Inwit of Inwit 111 and one or more Selves (“everything else about us—our bodies, our social roles,  our histories, and so on” [268]).
