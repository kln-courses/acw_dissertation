<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS L. H. VINCENT,Jerusalem de l'ancien testament, Tome II, Paris, J. Gabalda et Cie 1956, pp. xiii-xvii &amp; 373-809, figs. 111-214, Plates CI-CXT,TX. The first volume of this work appeared in 1954 and was reviewed in vol. VI of this journal (pp. 107-110). The present volume, including Parts II and III, completes the publication with unexpected speed. The enthusiasm with which volume I was received is no less appropriate now that the whole work is before us. Part II deals with the archeology of the temple. VINCENT notes the difficulty of an architectural reconstruction of Solomon's temple. The biblical description omits essential elements; corruption of the text has made the task still more difficult; no archeological vestiges of the building remain. Sanctuaries of other Semitic religions, however, give some assis- tance, because Israel did not exist in cultural isolation. Skilfully combining the biblical data with analogies in the religious architecture of the ancient Near East, VINCENT reaches conclusions which provide a satisfying rhythm of architectural proportions. Discussing the furniture and decorations of the temple, VINCENT argues that the cherubim were anthropomorphic (with the addition of wings), not theriomorphic or of hybrid form. All suggested analogies for the pillars Jachin and Boaz are rejected; they are found to be symbols of divine omnipotence and the power given to the ruler, and to have no architectural function. On the other hand, the utility of the sea and bases in the cult is stressed over and above any cosmic symbolism they may have had. No basis for a reconstruction of the royal palace is found. More specific results are reached for the "house of the forest of Lebanon", and for Solomon's throne analogies are seen in other ancient thrones and in the ivories of Nimrud, Arslan Tash, Samaria, and Megiddo. An avowedly conjectural attempt is made to locate the various buildings in the sacred area. VINCENT rejects theories which would explain the orientation of the temple by a supposed solar cult. Leaving the temple of Ezekiel and the post-exilic temple for later exa- mination, VINCENT proceeds next to the temple of Herod. Using the descriptions given by Josephus, which prove to be mutually complementary, VINCENT finds that the resulting picture cannot be reduced to a plan; on the basis of the diameters of the columns and the laws of architectural harmony, however, he boldly undertakes a reconstruction. Contemporary analogies are used on the assumption that Herod's temple was a work of syncretistic art. References in the New Testament give few indications</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS of details, but the narratives are found to fit what is known, especially in their consistent distinction between the hieron and the naos. The Beautiful Gate of Acts iii 4, VINCENT argues, was not the external eastern gate of the sacred area but the gate between the court of the women and the court of the Gentiles, called the Corinthian Gate by Josephus and the Gate of Nicanor in the rabbinic literature. The story of Acts xxi f is interpreted topographically in the light of Josephus' description of the temple. VINCENT now goes back to Ezekiel's temple, which cannot be used to supply details missing in the descriptions of Solomon's temple but deserves study because of its expression of majesty and holiness. Then the Mishnaic description of Herod's temple is discussed by itself, with care to avoid harmonization with Josephus. Harmonization of discrepancies within the Mishna itself is avoided also. While the temple described by the Mishna is theoretically that of Herod, VINCENT finds it to be in fact an idealization, intended to realize the idea of transcendent holiness intro- duced by Ezekiel and developed by eschatological speculation. Some con- cern for basic proportions appears even in the tite of the tractate, Middot; but many details are lacking, and the measurements given do not necessarily represent exact documentation or accurate memory. The description seeks to satisfy all the divine prescriptions since the era of the Tabernacle and all the elaborate ritual requirements of the cult as practised in the last days of the temple. Only after this separate examination does VINCENT compare the accounts of Josephus and the Mishna. Making due allowance for the merits and shortcomings of both, he finds enough agreement to establish the location of the gates and much concerning the altar and the naos itself. The discussion now moves to the site of the temple, the haram es-serzf. The archeological history of the enclosure and its walls is investigated thoroughly. The literature of the subject, very little of which VINCENT finds useful, is adduced only for data which can no longer be controlled. WARREN'S discoveries receive particular attention because of their importan- ce for dating the various portions of the walls. Facts which could not be interpreted in WARREN'S day are illuminated by subsequent developments in archeology. The sacred rock itself and all the canals, tunnels, cisterns, and cuttings of various kinds in the haram are examined in order to determine the original configuration of the hill and the location of the temple and the walls and gates. The result shows clearly that the haram was developed on both sides of a surprisingly narrow crest, with valleys on the northeast and southwest and abrupt scarps on the east and west, so that an extraordinary amount of filling in was required to support the great platform. VINCENT attributes the southeast corner of the foundation to the time of Solomon, comparing its masonry with that of Megiddo and Samaria. Special significance is attached to an Early Iron I jug so carefully deposited in a hollow in the rock as to indicate a foundation sacrifice. Proceeding northward from this corner, the original line of the wall turned to the north- west near the present Golden Gate, followed the southern side of the trans- verse valley, turned south at the site of the fortress Hananel (somewhat to 328</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS the south of the later Antonia), and thence followed the Tyropoeon Valley, well inside the present southeastern corner of the haram. Not until the time of Herod was this area enlarged. First attention was given to the buil- dings within the enclosure; the vast project of completing the supporting wall and the filling in it required was accomplished during the reigns of Solomon's successors. Herod made the enclosure more regular in shape and doubled its area by extending it to the north and filling in the Tyropoeon Valley at the southwest corner. This dating is supported by the pottery and the marks found painted on the foundation stones, though the work on the north side was not finished until 64 A.D. All the changes which have occurred in the sacred area since that time have left its perimeter unaltered. VINCENT disposes easily of the theory, based on rabbinic tradition, that the holy of holies was founded on the sacred rock, with the holy place to the east of it. The alternative view, now generally accepted, that the altar of burnt offerings stood on the rock and the temple to the west of it, is found to fit all the facts. The subsequent history of the courts and gates of the temple is followed on through the centuries, and the results of the investigation are used to illuminate events which occurred in the temple. Especially interesting is VINCENT'S reconstruction of the coup by which Athaliah was overthrown, archeological answers being given to questions which textual criticism has failed to answer. On one small point exception must be taken: VINCENT maintains that the pillar of 2 Kings xi 14 (2 Chron. xxiii 13) and xxiii 3 was the platform on which Solomon had stood at the dedication of the temple (2 Chron vi 13). Very rarely indeed does our author offer anything so unconvincing. The last embellishment of the first temple, VINCENT finds, was the new, imposing Upper Gate built by Jotham at the eastern entrance of the inrer court. The era of decline which followed was hardly interrupted by the efforts of Hezekiah and Josiah to repair the sacred edifice. After the exile, since the royal palace was gone, the temple occupied the area alone. Rejecting all attempts at an architectural reconstruction of the post-exilic temple, VINCENT claims only that it was rebuilt on the previous structural lines with cut stones and wooden binders. Lacking the magnificence of Solomon's temple, it was by no means a poor, miserable structure. Under the Persians, the Seleucids, the Hasmoneans, and the Romans this temple underwent many vicissitudes but no destruction or alteration until Herod enlarged the area and embellished the building in the style of Graeco-Roman art. Together with the history and description of the temple, this volume contains also Part III, in which the historical and monumental evolution of Jerusalem is traced from the beginning to the destruction of the city by the Romans. The details investigated in Parts I and II are here synthesized. To follow through all this prehistory and history here is impossible. From the many points of interest which might be noted a few may be selected for mention. One of these is VINCENT'S theory, defended in Part I, that the original valley of the sons of Hinnom was the Tyropoeon, the name 329</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS being later transferred to the valley west and south of the western hill. With most scholars now, VINCENT holds that the Jebusite city captured by David was confined to the southeastern hill. Under Solomon it was extended to the north when his temple and palaces were built. Gradually the occupa- tion spread to the western hill and the intervening valley, until it became necessary, about a century after the time of Solomon, to extend the city walls so as to enclose the western hill as far north as what Josephus calls the old wall. All this and the other developments in the fortification of the city throughout the history of the kingdom of Judah are reviewed by VINCENT in connection with the archeological remains. The episode of Isaiah vii, for example, is associated with the reinforcement of the wall across the mouth of the Tyropoeon Valley to make a large reservoir. The obscure topographical terms in Jer. xxxi 38-40 are discussed at length, and the conclusion reached is that they do not indicate an eschatological enlargement of the city but reflect its limits at the time of the destruction by the Babylonians, the point of the passage being that the whole city will in the future be holy. In discussing the exile and restoration VINCENT not only accepts the edict of Cyrus in Ezra vi 3-5 as genuine but even, much more question- ably, uses Baruch i 6-14 as evidence of the continued practice of the cult at the ruins of the temple. Sidney SMITH's explanation of the 'uffaya of Ezra iv 12 etc. is adopted-a good example of the fact that VINCENT often uses and so preserves contributions of other scholars which might easily have been forgotten and lost. In connection with the rebuilding of the temple problems of text, exegesis, and history are discussed more fully than at most other points in the history. Nehemiah's restoration of the walls is interpreted in the light of WEILL'S excavations, as more fully discussed in Part I. Through the Greek and Hasmonaean periods the story is continued, using in like manner the conclusions reached in Part I and drawing further upon literary sources. The description of Jerusalem in the Letter of Aristeas is accepted as substantially accurate. An excellent study of Josephus' account of the siege of Jerusalem by Pompey is given in connection with the topography of the period. The Jerusalem of Herod and its history to the first revolt receive relatively brief but adequate treatment. Herod's theatre, amphitheatre, and (probably) hippodrome are located in the Tyropoeon Valley. His palace at the northwestern corner of the Upper City and his temple, already studied in detail, are here brought into the historical picture. A whole chapter is devoted to the siege of the year 70, and while it proves impossible to make a clear story out of the confused and wearisome details, an excellent account is given, including bits of vivid description and fascinating narrative. The last chapter carries the story down to the foundation of Hadrian's Aelia Capitolina. VINCENT discusses the cause of the second revolt at greater length than its relation to the main theme of the book would seem to require, coming to the conclusion that Hadrian's liberalism had aroused hopes that he would be a new Cyrus, and the disillusionment when he innocently undertook to revive Jerusalem's glory in the new Roman 330</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS manner, perhaps not including the temple at all in his project, changed these hopes to anger and hatred. In a discussion of Bar Cochba's name, written and printed before the discovery of the Wady Murabbaat texts, their evidence could not be used; an additional paragraph concerning them is therefore added at the end of the book, and the letter referring to Galileans is reproduced as Plate CXLIX. While the part played by Jerusalem in the second revolt is admittedly obscure, VINCENT holds that there is sufficient evidence of a siege, probably brief but real, and a radical destruction of the ancient city. His view, strongly argued in Part I, that the supposed Third Wall to the north was in reality built during the second revolt, is brought in here as affording archeological evidence of the siege. The interpretation of the Damascus Document as referring to this wall is repeated at this point in the text, but a rather obscure footnote mentions the fact that the Dead Sea Scrolls have made such a late dating of the document doubtful, and in the Avant-Propos at the beginning of the volume VINCENT notes that the asso- ciation of the Damascus Document with Bar Cochba's wall must now be given up, but that the archeological argument remains unaffected. Tables of the plates and figures and an analytical index which is almost a summary of the book complete the volume. While the subject of the book is the Jerusalem of the Old Testament, by carrying the city's history down into the second century A.D. the author makes it include actually the Jerusalem of the New Testament also. It is thus an indispensable reference work for the historical geography and archeology of both Old and New Testaments, even though the connec- tions with New Testament history are not considered fully. The amount of information and scholarly discussion contained in the book is remarkable. The two volumes together comprise only 809 pages, but they are large pages of two columns. Biblical history is included, on the whole, only to the extent that it concerns Jerusalem and its archeological monuments; sometimes, however, the author's interest in his material carries him beyond these limits, to the readers' profit. The whole work exhibits a remarkable combination of careful and repeated personal observation with thorough study of the literature. To examine so patiently the most minute details of obscure ancient descriptions, the sometimes inaccurate and often ina- dequate reports of modern excavators, and the fine points of masonry pottery, and inscriptions, which the author has studied at first hand these many years, required extraordinary devotion. There are, of course, many points at which other scholars may be unable to agree with the author. The rapid summary here given will have made that sufficiently clear. The questions and doubts which the present re- viewer has noted, however, are of such minor importance as to seem in- significant in comparison with the vast amount of solid, indisputable facts and conclusions. Few scholars can hope to contribute anything of such great and lasting value for biblical scholarship. 331 New Haven MILLAR BURROWS</page></plain_text>
