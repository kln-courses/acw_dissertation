<plain_text><page sequence="1">Destroy! Destroy! I recently received the following letter in the mail, but think it was probably misdirected. Since I am not sure to whom it should be forwarded, I hope that you will print it and some one else may read it and suggest who the proper recipient might be: "Sir: The organization of which I well put it on wheels!

It has been going on for centuries and we have tried to laugh it off or ignore it, but we have had enough. In the first place, many of the characteristics generally attributed to animals and used as the basis for referring to people in a de rogatory manner are without basis in fact. The species of animal which I represent has suffered perhaps more than any other. Pigs generally are clean, noncombative, not interested in violent competition or aggrandizement of property, but are seldom presented this way. Now that a major crisis has developed in the literary world due to this sort of portrayal, we, with the support of other nonhuman animals, wish to lodge a protest. I am, of course, referring to Sylvester and the Magic Pebble. We are not much upset by the anthropomorphism in this particular book since we and all the other animals involved are shown as kindly and warm. We chose it as our point of issue simply because it has aroused so much con troversy among humans. People have slaughtered us, beaten us, imprisoned us, from time immemo rial. The killing we don't so much ob ject to when it's done for food?some of our kind do the same thing?but the rest is surely sound basis for com plaint. It is the brutality of people towards their own kind?the cruelty, viciousness, murder, destruction, utter selfishness that we have observed over the centuries, and never more so than presently?which appalls us. These traits, plus the rape of this earth on which we all must live, are so unbe lievably abominable, though done in the name of honor and glory and power and justice and democracy, etc., that we find it totally degrading to be por trayed with human characteristics, whether in language, art, or literature. Therefore, we are requesting that wherever such a portrayal does occur the offending medium be destroyed. We realize this will mean doing away with some enduring works of art, and we have given serious consideration to such a desperate measure, but the de pravity of the human race is such that we can no longer endure its use in this manner?Winthrop J. d'Amore, Sec retary, Society for the Promotion of the Ostracization of Mankind." The above letter ended with a post script which I was unable to decipher ?something about courts. Any help you can give in locating the intended recipient will be much appreciated.
