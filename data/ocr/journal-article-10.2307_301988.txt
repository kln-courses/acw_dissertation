<plain_text><page sequence="1">"The Sense of Sublimity" Darwin on Nature and Divinity By Phillip R. Sloan* I. INTRODUCTION The interplay of religious and theological presuppositions with the content of science can take many different shapes. One paradigmatic example is the natural philosophy of Johannes Kepler. His deep religious beliefs formed a clear motivation for his intense work on the problems of mathematical astronomy, supplying both the per- sonal impetus and a set of assumptions about the rationality of nature that animated his ground-breaking work. Metaphysical presumptions concerning the Platonic structure of nature were also crucial for his conception of the world as mathemati- cally describable. Such motivations help us to explain and to understand his realistic interpretation of Copernicanism and his drive to discover order in a cosmos in which circular motion of the planets could no longer be fitted to the best observational data. Darwinian natural selection theory would seem to present a very different situa- tion. Since 1859 it has formed one foundation of modem scientific naturalism and has, for many, represented the triumph of nontheological science. Furthermore, many have seen it in terms of a nonmetaphysical positivism, rather than as a theory deeply imbued with metaphysical commitments of a constitutive character. There is little common assumption that religious motivations or metaphysical issues form a significant backdrop for understanding the content of Darwinian evolution, even if there is much greater sensitivity to the possibility of religious motivation in the gene- sis of his work.'

SLOAN Darwin's personal biography, as has been noted by several authors just cited, mani- fests internal tensions of a religious character. His early Unitarian piety, encouraged and instilled by his sisters,2 stands against the male family heritage of Scottish deism and religious skepticism embraced by his father and his older brother Erasmus Alvey and reflected in the religious skepticism of Darwin's letters and writings. Between these poles is the broad-Church Anglican tradition of his Cambridge guides in sci- ence-Adam Sedgwick, William Whewell, and especially John Stevens Henslow- and his lifelong friendship with his cousin W. D. Fox and other Cambridge associ- ates who went on to become Anglican country parsons. To this we can add the friendship in his last years with the local vicar of Downe, Rev. Brodie Innes. These features contextualize Darwin socially within broad-Church Anglicanism. As the fundamental studies of James Moore have demonstrated, we have before us all of the historical complexities of an individual who has functioned as one of the primary architects of modem scientific naturalism yet, in his later life, raised money for parish activities and served as treasurer for the local Sunday school, even loaning his personally rented reading room to Plymouth Brethren evangelist W. C. Fegan to enable him to conduct religious revivals.3 But the degree to which we can affirm the constitutive nature of religious or meta- physical beliefs in Darwin's science is not fully clear. I argue that this dimension can be penetrated by looking more closely at the role played by the concept of "na- ture" in the constitution of Darwin's mature scientific thought. Although a full dis- cussion is beyond the range of this essay, a limited focus on the topic illuminates several factors of relevance to Darwin's attitude to religion. I explore three aspects of Darwin's conception of nature. First, I locate his early re- flections on nature in the tradition of Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859), whose writings were directly accessible to Darwin in his formative period up through the Beagle years. Second, I examine the development of Darwin's philosophy of "nature" after the Beagle expedition and its role in forming the complex roots of his notion of "natu- ral" selection, concentrating principally on his reflections up to the publication of the Origin of Species in 1859. I offer a controversial interpretation of the issue. Finally, I address the science-religion issues that follow from my historical analysis. II. HUMBOLDTIAN NATURE The concept of "nature" found within German Naturphilosophie, developed in dif- ferent formulations by Friedrich Schelling and his disciples at Jena, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and his associates at Weimar, forms a point of depar- Proceedings of a Conference in Honor of Allen G.

At least three issues differentiate the conception of nature developed in these Ger- man traditions from other versions of the philosophy of nature in the literature of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.5 First is the abolition of the traditional distinction between God and nature and a return to a position close to the rational pantheism of Spinoza. Nature was posited as a "self-existent" (Selbstdndig) agency that is both product and productive.6 Second, in Schelling's original formulations of this program, the new conception of nature differed from the static nature-creation relationship of Spinoza in that the duality of "creative nature" (natura naturans) and "created nature" (natura naturata) was reconceived as a dynamic, two-faceted interaction between creative force and the concrete products of nature. This polarity produced the various plants and animals in time through a dialectical relation. As- pects of this account of the creation of the world from the inherent polarity in nature were extensively developed by such successors as Heinrich Steffens, Christian Nees von Esenbeck, and Lorenz Oken.7 As a third feature, the relation of natura naturans and natura naturata also in- volved a dynamic relationship of knower and known, consciousness and matter, sub- ject and object. Developing from the dual-aspect identity theory of Spinoza, but with the addition of a new dynamism between the conscious and the material, both the conscious and the unconscious were now seen to spring from the same originat- ing source. I For recent summaries of this movement, see Michael Heidelberger, "Naturphilosophie," in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Edward Craig (New York: Routledge, 1998); and Nicho- las Jardine, "Naturphilosophie and the Kingdoms of Nature," in Cultures of Natural History, ed. Nicholas Jardine, James Secord, and Emma Spary (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 230-45. Although Schelling and Goethe's forms of Naturphilosophie are related, the strongly logical and dialectical character of Schelling's version can be distinguished from the less systematic pantheism of Goethe. As one anonymous reviewer of this paper correctly pointed out, Humboldt drew from both of these traditions, but on my reading he stands much closer to Goethe's formula- tions. I am not suggesting, e.g., that Darwin displays any close connection to the tradition of Schelling such as we find articulated in a British context by Joseph Henry Green. For Green's formulations, see discussion and texts in my Richard Owen's Hunterian Lectures: May-June 1837 (Chicago / London: Univ. of Chicago Press / British Museum of Natural History Press, 1992).

SLOAN Within this complex tradition, the developmental, rational pantheism of Schelling can be distinguished from the parallel form of Naturphilosophie developed primar- ily by Goethe.9 Goethe's complex philosophy of nature, elaborated over several de- cades, emphasized the pantheistic aspects of nature and formulated this in relation to aesthetics and poetry in ways that inspired important aspects of the Romantic movement. His philosophy of nature also lacked the strongly systematic character of Schelling's. Most significant for my thematic is the link in Goethe's Naturphilosophie between the aesthetic experience of landscape and the vital powers of nature. This renders nature restorative, vivifying, and all-encompassing, known better through aesthetic awareness than by rational cognition."' It is this aesthetic pantheism of Goethe, de- veloped further by Humboldt, that I will explore. "I Humboldt's conception of nature lacks the deep inner teleology that one finds in that of Schelling and his disciples and that Goethe also emphasized in works such as the Metamorphosis of Plants. For Humboldt, nature is less a teleological system than it is a sustaining ground of being, the source of consciousness, the basis of the universal vitality of life and the interconnections of forms. As Humboldt comments in his early series of philosophical reflections, Ansichten der Natur (1807), When the active spirit of man is directed to the investigation of nature, or when in imagination he scans the vast fields [Rdume] of organic creation, among the varied emotions excited in his mind there is none more profound or vivid than that awakened by the universal profusion of life [allverbreitete Fille des Lebens]. Everywhere even near the ice-bound poles, the air resounds with the song of birds and with the busy hum of insects. Not only the lower strata . .. but also the higher and ethereal regions of the air, teem with animal life.... But if the unassisted eye shows that life is diffused throughout the whole atmosphere, the microscope reveals yet greater wonders. Wheel- animalcules, brachioni, and a host of microscopic insects are lifted by the winds from the evaporating waters below. Motionless and to all appearance dead, they float on the breeze, until the dew bears them back to the nourishing earth, and bursting the tissue which incloses [sic] their transparent rotating . . . bodies, instils new life and motion into all their organs, probably by the action of the vital principle [Lebensstoff] inherent in water.... Thus, wheresoever the naturalist turns his eye, life or the germ of life [Leben oder Keirn zurn Leben] lies spread before him.'2 Through an aesthetic experience of this vital nature, the observer and the ob- served, consciousness and matter, are merged in a "mysterious communion" be- See n. 4. 0 See, e.g., the essay by Goethe's disciple George Christoph Tobler, "Nature," trans. in Goethe: Scientific Studies, ed. Douglas E. Miller (New York: Suhrkamp, 1988), p. 3. Goethe later considered Tobler's statement to be incomplete because it failed to deal sufficiently with Goethe's notions of polarity and intensification (pp. 6-7).

Nature is the framework, the source of inter- connection, that links individual plants into an interconnected botanical geography. As Humboldt put this most explicitly in his great synthesis, Kosmos (1845), nature, apprehended in the multiple meanings of the word one as the totality of beings and becomings, in another as the inner moving force, and in another as the mysterious arche- type [Urbild] of all appearances reveals itself to the simple sense and feeling of man- kind preeminently as something earthly, closely related to himself. First it is in the life- surround [Lebenskreisenj of organic formation [organischen Bildungj that we know with certitude our proper location [Heimat]. Wherever the womb of the earth unfolds its flowers and fruits, wherever it nourishes the innumerable tribes of animals, there appears the portrait of living nature before our soul.... If accordingly it is necessary to form a portrait of nature solely from the requirements of sensible intuition, it must begin with the description of the native habitat. It first describes the body of the earth in its size and form, in the density and heat which increases with depth, in its overlain solid and fluid strata; it describes the boundaries of the sea and land, of life that is developed as the cellular tissue of both plants and animals; of the undulating, current- filled ocean of air, from whose ground forested mountain chains emerge like crags and abysses.14 The aesthetic experience of nature grounds the "Romantic sublime" that pervades Humboldt's less technical and descriptive works. Describing his view from the vol- canic peak of Mount Piton on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Humboldt seeks to capture the contrasts, drama, even Burkean "terror" in the vision from the top. As he comments in the English version of the Personal Narrative, We not only discover from its top a vast expanse of sea, but we see also the forests of Teneriffe [sic], and the inhabited parts of the coasts, in a proximity fitted to produce the most beautiful contrasts of form and colour. We might say that the volcano crushes with its mass the little isle which serves as its basis, and shoots up from the bosom of the waters to a height three times loftier than the region where the clouds float in the summer.... When seated on the external edge of the crater, we turned our eyes towards the north- west, where the coasts are decked with villages and hamlets. At our feet, masses of vapour, constantly driven by the winds, afforded us the most variable spectacle. A uni- form stratum of clouds, the same as we have just described, and which separated us from the lower regions of the island, had been pierced in several places by the effect of the small currents of air, which the earth, heated by the sun, began to send towards us. The port of Orotava, its vessel at anchor, the gardens and the vineyards which encircle the town, exhibited themselves through an opening which seemed to enlarge every in- stant. From the summit of these solitary regions our eyes hovered over an inhabited world; we enjoyed the striking contrast between the bare sides of the Peak, its steep '3 See "The Cataracts of the Orinoco," in Humboldt, Views of Nature (cit. n. 12), p. 154.

SLOAN declivities covered with scoriae, its elevated plains destitute of vegetation, and the smil- ing aspect of the cultured country beneath.5 Humboldt's conception of nature is neither deistic nor mechanistic. Nor is it mani- festly teleological, in the form found in more systematic traditions of German Natur- philosophie. His nature is a pantheistic ground of being that underpins life, con- sciousness, and the interconnections of all natural things. Humboldt's reflections on nature in his seminal works of the early nineteenth cen- tury, accessible to Darwin in French translations, form the starting point for a pene- tration into Darwin's own philosophy of nature.'6 Of all the sources and readings which Darwin is known to have assimilated deeply in his early years, the writings of Humboldt serve as the most immediate source where he could first have encoun- tered and appropriated aspects of German Naturphilosophie. Furthermore, this pan- theistic, "Humboldtian" nature, rather than the concept of nature that can be ex- tracted from British natural theology, Scottish philosophy, or the political economy of Smith, Malthus, and Ricardo, forms the main source of Darwin's original reflec- tions on this topic, creating a basic groundwork of his thought that can be traced through all of his mature writings and into his last works. The connections of his views of nature with his religious sensibility are discussed in section V. III. NATURE IN THE BEAGLE YEARS (1831-1836) Since the classic studies of Robert Young, Gillian Beer, John Campbell, Edward Manier and Dov Ospovat, Darwin's use of intentional metaphors in his descriptions of nature has been a subject of considerable commentary. This literature has also drawn linkages between Darwin's metaphors and the theological dimensions of his thought. 17 To explore this issue more deeply, it is necessary to question some of the claims about the origins of Darwin's thought that have achieved the level of common- places in the literature. With few exceptions," Darwin has been located originally '5 Alexander von Humboldt and Aimr Bonpland, Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent During the Years 1799-1804, trans.

Darwin had on the Beagle various volumes of this translation in the third, second, and first editions. The first two volumes of the third edition were presented to him by J. S. Henslow on 21 Sept. 1831. See "Books on Board the Beagle," appendix IV, in Correspondence, vol. 1, p. 561, cit. n. 2. Although the Personal Narrative is a collaborative work, for the purposes of this essay I will presume these passages are by Humboldt, on the grounds that Darwin never refers to this work as a collaborative product. 16 For a recent discussion that comes to similar conclusions on several of these points, see Rob- ert J. Richards, "Darwin's Romantic Biology: The Foundation of His Evolutionary Ethics," in Biology and the Foundation of Ethics, ed. Jane Maienschein and Michael Ruse (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1999), pp. 113-53. 1 See Robert M. Young, "Darwin's Metaphor: Does nature select?", in Darwin's Metaphor: Na- ture's Place in Victorian Culture, ed. Robert M. Young (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

The beginning of this detailed recognition of Darwin's "Romantic" dimension was Edward Manier's valuable study of the early years (The Young Darwin, cit. n. 17), but his analysis</page><page sequence="7">DARWIN ON NATURE AND DIVINITY 257 within, and later seen as reacting against, the design/contrivance tradition of British natural theology paradigmatically represented by William Paley's Natural Theology and the Bridgewater Treatises. 19 Darwin indeed emphasized the significance of this tradition for the early formation of his thought in his Autobiography. There he re- called his "thorough" study of Paley's works and his "delight" in Paley's Natural Theology during his Cambridge years.20 The image of Darwin as formed by British natural theology, utilitarian ethics, and British political economy has also become standard in the "common-context" historiography developed by Robert Young and others. It is difficult, however, to find compelling documentary evidence from Darwin's early writings that warrants this reading. It is also difficult to find evidence from this documentary base that he ever adhered strongly to the "watchmaker-designer" model of a creator-nature relationship integral to the tradition of British natural the- ology. It is, for example, essential to Paley's utilization of the design argument that "nature" be fundamentally passive, a conclusion that can be traced within British natural theology back to Robert Boyle.2 We find something very different at work in Darwin's writings. does not extend back to the 1831-1836 period I am treating. In Chapter 6, Manier discusses signifi- cant aspects of Darwin's encounter with early British romanticism in the 1837-1842 period, after his return from the Beagle expedition, and emphasizes Wordsworth's influence but says little about Humboldt. David Kohn has more explicitly traced the influence of the "Humboldtian sublime" in the Beagle materials and locates Darwin within the middle ground of early British romanticism, with "Wordsworthian" romanticism succeeding the Humboldtian period, underpinning Darwin's notion of the "beautiful" (Kohn, "Darwin's Ambiguity" [cit. n. 1] pp. 234-5). Kohn has also developed significant themes related to the Humboldtianism and the aesthetic experience of the Beagle years in "The Aesthetic Construction of Darwin's Theory," in The Elusive Synthesis: Aesthetics and Science, ed. Alfred I. Tauber (The Hague: Kluwer, 1996), pp. 13-48. 19 For example, Cannon, "The Bases"; Brooke, "Darwin's Science"; Kohn, "Darwin's Ambiguity"; Gillispie, Charles Darwin (all cit. n. 1). E.g., Kohn emphasizes the Paleyan impact on Darwin's thought at Cambridge and then interprets his larger project as part of an "advanced" wing of a reform movement within British natural theology that eventually secularized it (pp. 218-19). 20 Francis Darwin, ed., The Autobiography of Charles Darwin and Selected Letters (1892; reprinted New York: Dover, 1958), p. 19 (cited hereafter as Autobiography). 21 The assumption that nature is possessed of vital powers or inherent forces sufficient to create its own order, or even to create life, was considered by William Paley to be tantamount to atheism. See William Paley, Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, 12th ed. (London, 1809; reprinted Charlottesville, Va: Lincoln-Rembrandt, 1997), especially pp. 427-34. Pa- ley explicitly attacks Buffon's naturalistic account of the formation of the solar system and the gener- ation of life from organic molecules as a resurrection of ancient atheistic atomism. The conception of "nature" as a passive system on which a creator-designer imposes order was crucial for the force of the British design/contrivance argument. In support of this, frequent appeal was made to Robert Boyle's mechanical notion of nature (A Free Inquiry Into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature [1686]). Although there are complexities within Boyle's positions that require modification of this claim, as recently pointed out by Margaret Osler in her essay "How mechanical was the mechanical philosophy?" (personal communication), the subsequent tradition nevertheless commonly inter- preted Boyle to be arguing for the passivity of both matter and nature. See, e.g., Ephriam Chambers' use of Boyle in his discussion of the concept of nature in his Cyclopaedia: Or an Universal Diction- an, ofArts and Sciences [1 st ed., 1728]). Via Chambers, this reading of Boyle constituted the article "Nature" in Diderot's Encvclope'die ou dictionnaire raisonnee, vol. 2 (Neuchatel, 1765), pp. 40-1. This reliance on what is interpreted to be Boyle's passive conception of nature forms the basis of the articles in The British Encyclopedia or Dictionary of the Arts and Sciences, ed. William Nich- olson (1809); the Cyclopedia, or Universal Dictionary ofArts, Sciences, and Literature, ed. Abraham Rees (1819), and it underlies the entries on the topic in the Encyclopedia Britannica from the first edition (1771) through the fourth (1810), and in altered form persists in the entry of the seventh edition (1842).</page><page sequence="8">258 PHILLIP R. SLOAN Darwin's early scientific education, pursued both at Edinburgh and at Cambridge, involved detailed studies of marine invertebrates, entomology, and physiological and descriptive botany and does not strongly display the influence of British natural the- ology, although that certainly played some role in the catastrophist geology of Robert Jameson and Adam Sedgwick and in the entomology of William Kirby that he en- countered. In his most formal and intensive scientific study during the Cambridge years, his attendance at John Stevens Henslow's annual lecture and laboratory course on descriptive and physiological botany-a course which Darwin may have attended each of his years at Cambridge-students encountered the plant world in a frame- work that was most heavily indebted to the physiological and functional botany of the Swiss naturalist Alphonse De Candolle, with little hint of traditional natural the- ology in evidence.22 Most conspicuously at Cambridge Darwin encountered the writings of Alexander von Humboldt.23 A more detailed encounter with Humboldt's work may also have occurred in Henslow's botany course, which, sometime after 1828, added a section on botanical geography that made use of Humboldt's writings on this subject.24 The enthusiasm of the young Darwin for Humboldt's depictions of the tropics was displayed during the Cambridge years at the time when he was planning a botanical and geological expedition to the island of Teneriffe with three fellow students: All the while I am writing now my head is running about the Tropics: in the morning I go and gaze at Palm trees in the hot-house and come home and read Humboldt: my enthusiasm is so great that I cannot hardly sit still on my chair... I never will be easy till I see the peak of Teneriffe [sic] and the great Dragon tree; sandy, dazzling, plains, and gloomy silent forest are alternately uppermost in my mind. 25 22 I have been unable to locate Henslow's manuscript lectures for these annual courses, but his printed Descriptive and Physiological Botany (London: Longman et al., 1836), issued as a volume in Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopedia, displays several evidences of a reworking of class lec- tures. In this text the language of, and appeals to, design/contrivance natural theology are very muted at best. Two syllabi for the courses exist in the Henslow Papers in Cambridge University Library (hereafter cited as Henslow Papers). A syllabus for 1828 recommends the reading of De Candolle's Theorie Elhmentaire (1819) and Organographie (1827), and James E. Smith's Introduction to Physio- logical and Systematic Botany, 6th ed. (1827), and English Flora (1828). A second syllabus (for the 1833 series, delivered after Darwin's graduation) expands the readings to include De Candolle's new Physiologie v'gitale (1832); three works by John Lindley (Introduction to Botany [1832], Natural System [1830], Synopsis of British Flora [1829]); William Macgillivray's Withering's British Plants, 3rd ed. (London, 1830); and Hooker's British Flora, 2nd ed. (1831). See John S. Henslow, Syllabus of a Course of Botanical Lectures (Cambridge: Hodson, 1828); idem, Sketch of a Course of Lectures on Botany for 1833 (Privately printed, 1833), Henslow Papers). Darwin's attendance at the Henslow lectures for 1830, 1831, and possibly 1829 is documented in "Names of Men Who Attended the Botanical Lectures, 1828," MS 0.xiv.26 1, Henslow Papers. 23 Kohn suggests that Darwin's mentor in ornithology during his Edinburgh years, William McGil- livray, may have introduced him to the Romantic nature philosophy of Humboldt.

Tradition has uniformly assumed that the Personal Narrative was the main text in his formation. But the language of the letter suggests he had been read- ing the French translation of Humboldt's more philosophical Ansichten der Natur, available to him in the French translations of 1808 and 1828. This text, containing discussions of both plants and animals, reveries on South American scenery, a Goethean reflection entitled "Vital Force, or the Rhodian Genius," and other specu- lative essays, was intended by Humboldt to illustrate an "aesthetic" approach to natural history that displayed nature in its entirety as a great cooperation of interre- lated forces.26 Whatever the sources of his exposure to Humboldt's philosophy of nature, its impact runs deeper in his subsequent thought than British natural theology. Darwin's direct modeling of many of his Diary entries during the Beagle years on the Personal Narrative has been noted by several scholars. Humboldt's "aesthetic" natural history is mirrored in the "landscape reveries" that fill Darwin's literary descriptions, dis- playing his affective responses to the plants and animals, the rain forests, and the dramatic contrasts of scenery. In addition to his famous "chaos of delight" passage in the Diary entry of 28 February 1832,27 the impact of Humboldt's integrating nature philosophy seems apparent in many other entries in the Diary,28 strongly predomi- nating over that of traditional British natural theology in his writings from this pe- riod.29 Typical of the Beagle manuscripts is language reflecting communion with, 26 A. von Humboldt, Tableaux de la nature: ou, Considerations sur les deserts, sur la physionomie des vegetaux, sur les cataractes de I orenoque, sur la structure et / action des volcans dans les differ- entes regions de la terre, etc., 2 vols., trans. from the German by J. B. B. Eyries (Paris: Gide Fils, 1828). The first French edition was published in 1808, with additions to the second French edition. Darwin displays general proficiency with French sources in this period. Palms, the "peak of Tene- riffe," and the baobab or "colossal dragon tree" of Orotava are found concisely described in the essay "IdWes sur la physiognomie des v6g6taux" that opens volume 2 of the 1828 Tableaux and accords with the comments made in Darwin's letter to Caroline. See Tableaux, pp. 33, 4, 26. The discussion of the baobab in the Personal Narrative is brief, whereas in the 1828 Tableaux the tree is discussed both in the text and at greater length in an appendix, with accounts of its size, longevity, locale, and other features (vol. 2, pp. 99-101). Darwin's knowledge of the French translation of the Tableaux is documented by his request in a letter of July 1832 asking his sister Catherine to have his brother Erasmus send him the French edition (C.D. to Catherine Darwin, 5 July [1832], Correspondence, vol. 1, p. 247). There is, however, no evidence that the request was honored, and there is no copy of this edition in Darwin's surviving library. His only documented reading is of the English Aspects in February 1852. See "Darwin's Reading List:' MS DAR 128.

On the dialectic between the "sublime" and "beautiful" in this period, see Kohn, "Aesthetic Construction" (cit. n. 18). 29 Darwin's principal "Paleyan" reflection in the Diary is restricted to one entry of 19 Jan. 1836, occasioned by his comparison of Australian and European fauna. The occurrence of similarities at such distances apart might suggest to "an unbeliever in everything beyond his own reason" that "[s]urely two distinct Creators must have been at work" in the separate creation of these faunas. But commenting on the identical character of the ant-lion traps in both areas, Darwin replies, "Would any two workmen ever hit on so beautiful, so simple, &amp; yet so artificial a contrivance? It cannot be</page><page sequence="10">260 PHILLIP R. SLOAN and experience of, a vitalistic, dynamic, creative nature that closely resembles that found in Humboldt's parallel reflections. Nor does this Humboldtian imagery decline as the voyage progressed. Returning in August 1836 to the Bahia Brazil rain forests that had first inspired his well-known reveries of 1832, he again responded aesthetically to the "great wild, untidy, luxuri- ant hot house which nature made for her menagerie" and tried to fix these visions permanently in his mind: In the last walk I took, I stopped again &amp; again to gaze on such beauties, &amp; tried to fix for ever in my mind, an impression which at the time I know must sooner or later fade away . . .; the thousand beauties, which unite them all into one perfect scene, must perish; yet they will leave, like a tale heard in childhood, a picture full of indistinct, but most beautiful figures."' Pursuing these reflections into Darwin's detailed empirical scientific studies con- ducted alongside the literary narrative of the voyage, we also see more concrete manifestations of this aesthetic response to nature and of efforts to realize Hum- boldt's vision of an interconnection of issues. To limit ourselves to Darwin's funda- mental explorations of biological problems in this period, these were principally focused on the functional questions revealed by the study of invertebrate marine life, extending the investigations he had begun on invertebrates at Edinburgh under the inspiration of Robert Grant and had continued in the botanical domain with Henslow at Cambridge.3' In this work, Darwin was interested in more than descriptions of the unusual organisms he was studying in live condition. He was also seeking to find some means of unifying plant and animal biology, bringing together under one model the plant and animal kingdoms. Frequently encountered in Darwin's descrip- tions in these researches is the image of an encounter with a dynamic, vital life- world that is unified by a common, dynamic granular matter that even contains the rudiments of consciousness. For example, an entry in the "Zoology Diary" de- scribes his observations on live colonial invertebrates of the genus Crisia in May 1834 off the coast of Patagonia: I was perfectly astonished, when I first saw, every bristle in one branch, suddenly with great rapidity, collapse together on ye branch &amp; one after the other (apparently by their elasticity) regain their places. Directly other branches commenced, till the whole Coralline, driven by these long oars, started from side to side in the object glass [of the microscope]....

His descriptions are, like Humboldt's own, typically devoid of references to "God," "creation," "providence," "design," or the other categories of traditional theology, whether revealed or natural.35 Where we might expect religious language, "nature" has assumed the role that the religious tradi- tions of the West have assigned to a transcendent deity. For example, discussing trees on Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro in April and May 1832, he enters as a "Gen- eral Observation" in the "Zoology Diary": I could not help noticing how exactly the animals &amp; plants in each region are adapted to each other. Every one must have noticed how Lettuces &amp; cabbages suffer from the attacks of caterpillars &amp; Snails. But when transplanted here in a foreign clime, the leaves remain as entire as if they contained poison Nature, when she formed these animals &amp; these plants knew they must reside together. _6 The use of such language alongside the landscape reveries and Humboldtian lan- guage of the Beagle Diary supports the claim that Darwin's conception of nature, although not explicitly addressed or discussed in a specific treatise during these years. had already by the end of the Beagle voyage taken on a function that carried many associations that he would later in life recall as "intimately connected with a belief in God."37 IV. NATURE AS SELECTOR Darwin's creative post-Beagle reflections covering the crucial period 1836-1844 can be followed in detail in the early Notebooks and the first syntheses of the Beagle results. These unquestionably display new elements reflecting his active engagement with the changed intellectual, scientific, and social environment he encountered upon his return to England after a five-year absence. At the same time they also show strong lines of continuity with the reflections of the Beagle years. The vital, unifying, and creative nature of the Beagle years does not disappear from Darwin's thought in the post-Beagle period. It is only overlain by several additional elements that considerably complicate Darwin's views and render the resulting product truly novel. 34 I have developed these points further in a forthcoming study, "The Making of a Philosophical Naturalist, 1809-1836," to appear in the Cambridge Companion to Darwin, ed. M. J. S. Hodge and Gregory Radick. 35 I have been unsuccessful in locating a single passage in the unpublished "Zoology Diary" in which Darwin explicitly appeals to design/contrivance natural theology. He puzzles about the phe- nomena, and concerns himself with the uses of structures, but he never resolves these by appeals to creative will or the action of a designing creator distinct from nature. The closest is a comment in MS DAR 30.2 when, remarking on the absence of coprophagan beatles on Maldonado in May-June 1833, he sees this absence as "showing a connection in the creation between &lt;two&gt; animals as widely apart as Mammalia &amp; &lt;col&gt;Insects Coleoptera, which, when one of them is removed out of its original Zone can scarcely be produced by a length of time &amp; the most favorable circumstances.-" MS DAR 30.2, fol. 200 (Keynes [cit. n. 33], p. 175, emended by MS). 36 "Zoology Diary," MS DAR 30.1, fol. 65 (Keynes, pp. 58-59). 17 Darwin, Autobiography (cit. n. 20), p. 65.</page><page sequence="12">262 PHILLIP R. SLOAN In the first transmutation, or "B" Notebook, opened in July 1837 and covering reflections up to about March 1838, Darwin introduced the notion of a "creative power" that acts as a secondary cause in the creation of the natural world. This creative power operates in response to the establishment of laws by a creator and explains the origin of different species on such locales as the Galapagos Islands. Creation of species is therefore by means of secondary causation through natural laws: Astronomers might formerly have said that God ordered, [sic] each planet to move in its particular destiny. In same manner God orders each animal created with certain form in certain country, but how much more simple, &amp; sublime power let attraction act according to certain laws such are inevitable consequen [sic] let animal be created, then by the fixed laws of generation, such will be their successors.-38 This deistic language, however, has not replaced the preexisting imagery of the Humboldtian nature philosophy of the Beagle period. Continuity with this earlier tradition immediately returned in the "C" Notebook, begun around March 1838. In speculations evidently generated in May 1838 by his reading of the remarkable 1819 essay "The Kingdoms of Nature, Their Life and Affinity," by Goethe's disciple Carl Gustav Carus, Darwin developed his philosophy of nature further.39 The Carus essay, which had appeared in translation in Richard Taylor's Scientific Memoirs in 1837, expounded a notion of a "universal nature" as the "highest, the most complete, the original organism," from which all organic beings could be derived, and from which consciousness itself arose.40 Entering reflections on this text in his notebook, Darwin spoke of how he could now "see that perfection may be talked of with respect to life generally. where 'unity constantly develops multiplicity."'41 Sometime around June he entered the following in the same notebook: There is one living spirit, prevalent over this word [sic, = world], (subject to certain contingencies of organic matter &amp; chiefly heat), which assumes a multitude of forms &lt;&lt;each having acting principle&gt;&gt; according to subordinate laws.-There is one thinking &lt;&lt;&lt;&amp; Creat&gt; sensible&gt;&gt; principle (intimately allied to one kind of organic matter. brain. &amp; which &lt;prin&gt;thinking principle. seems to be given or assumed ac- cording to a more extended relations of the individuals, whereby choice with memory. 38 Darwin, 'B Notebook,' transcribed by David Kohn, in Charles Darwin's Notebooks, 1836-1844, ed.

All references to the Notebooks will be to this edition with citation of the folio number and the page number in the Barrett edition. This shift to secondary "creative-force" language supercedes the reference to the direct role of a "creator" earlier in the B Notebook (fol. 45). I have located one reference to a "creative power" "acting on a point" in the "Zoology Diary" in an entry at the Falklands in 1833 (MS DAR 30.2, fol. 162), but this is in the sense of Humboldt's creative vital force rather than in the natural theological sense of a secondary causal law. 39 I am dating this from Kohn's conclusion that C Notebook, fol. 100; p. 268, reflects a visit to Henslow at Cambridge on 10-13 May 1838 and that the entries from fols. 100-256 were generally concentrated between mid-May and mid-June 1838. The first reference to the Carus article appears at fol. 103; p. 269. 40 Carl G. Carus, "The Kingdoms of Nature, Their Life and Affinity," in Scientific Memoirs, ed. Richard Taylor, 4 vols.

We see thus Unity in thinking and acting principle in the various shades of &lt;dif&gt; separation between those individuals thus endowed, &amp; the community of mind, even in the tendency to delicate emotions between races, &amp; recurrent habits in animals. 42 These ambitious reflections on the animating spirit of the world immediately pre- cede entries on how "Man &amp; Man .. , polypus &amp; polypus, bud &amp; bud, polypus &amp; germ, plant &amp; seed," may have some relation together.43 They are also encountered only a few months before his reading of the sixth edition (1826) of Thomas Malthus' Essay on Population in the five days between 28 September and 2 October 1838. The changes in Darwin's conception of nature engendered by this historical encounter are deeply significant, but, as we shall see, they are also temporary in duration and do not supplant the earlier themes we have followed. In addition to drawing Darwin's attention to the inherent dynamic power of the principle of population, Malthus also supplied Darwin with a new language with which to speak about nature, and a new set of metaphors for describing it that we do not encounter in Darwin's earlier discourse. The metaphor of the "hundred thousand wedges" being pounded into the "oeconomy of Nature," certainly disrupts the "sub- lime" imagery of the Beagle years with a new "mechanical" starkness. Dramatically entering with the Malthus reading was the metaphor of nature as a rigorous "selec- tor" that acts for teleological goals and is able to perfect the human race by unerring punishment of all violations of its law-bound order.44 After October 1838 Malthusian "selective" nature formed a theme that ran along- side, rather than replaced, the "Humboldtian" nature that we have been examining.45 Malthusian "nature" itself required a ground, a foundation for its dynamic power that could causally explain the tendency of populations to increase geometrically beyond their natural means of subsistence.46 I highlight these points to indicate the growing complexity of Darwin's conception of nature in this period. As early as 1839, we can detect metaphors drawn from the Malthusian notion of nature as "selector." We also find deistic images of nature as a secondary cause of life with powers to create forms; and in the background are the 42 Ibid., fols. 210e-21 1; p. 305. Cf.

The "wedges" passage is from Darwin's D notebook, fol. 135e, Barrett ed., p. 375. 45 Selective language remains sparse in the Notebooks, even after the Malthus encounter. Of the 105 occurrences of the term "nature," the unequivocal use of "intentional-selecting" language is confined principally to one passage ("E" Notebook, fol. 63; p. 414). See Donald Weinshank, Stephan J. Ozminski, Paul Ruhlen et al., A Concordance to Charles Darwin's Notebooks, 1836-1844 (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell Univ. Press, 1990). 46 Malthus resolved this problem by an appeal to an inherent vitalism of organic matter. In the opening chapter of the Essay on Population, in a passage unchanged through the several editions, Malthus speaks of how "Nature has scattered the seeds of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand" and says that such "germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. Necessity, that imperious all-pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds" (Malthus, Essay [cit. n. 44], vol. 1, p. 10). Such language could easily have connected with Dar- win's own Beagle theory of the "vital atoms." On this see my "Darwin, Vital Matter" (cit. n. 32), pp. 385-96.</page><page sequence="14">264 PHILLIP R. SLOAN persistent images of nature as a dynamic and vital principle of life, linking all of organic life together and serving as the source from which consciousness itself emerges. Darwin needed all of these notions in his mature doctrine of a universalized theory of population increase that impelled all of life, not only the human popula- tion, toward a universal and interconnected struggle for existence that could even produce thought and consciousness from lower states of life. The synthesis of Darwin's complex body of readings and reflections finally took shape in the remarkable first drafts of his transformist theory in 1842 and 1844, the first texts to employ the concept of "natural" selection. In these texts we can also see the beginnings of the interplay of the "Humboldtian" and "Malthusian" concep- tions of nature, one as the source of life, vitality, instinct, and consciousness, and the other a "selecting demiurge" working for purposeful ends. In introducing his notion of "natural" selection in the short pencil sketch of the theory in 1842, Darwin located "selection" in an all-seeing being, "infinitely more sagacious than man (not an omniscient creator)," who was able to select variations toward a specific end and "produce causes" that could attain such ends "over thou- sands and thousands of years."47 Only a few pages deeper into the manuscript, how- ever, this sagacious "selector" is transformed into "nature": "Nature lets &lt;&lt;an&gt;&gt; animal live, till on actual proof it is found less able to do the required work to serve the desired end, man judges solely by his eye, and knows not whether nerves, muscles, arteries, are developed in proportion to the change of external form."48 But this selector nature is not itself competent to breathe the vital powers of "growth, assimilation and reproduction" into matter. For this a "creator" was still needed.49 Darwin's metaphors were expanded and deepened in the long 230-page draft of the theory of natural selection that he composed in 1844. Darwin continued to speak in this text of a "Being with penetration sufficient to perceive differences in the outer and innermost organization quite imperceptible to man, and with forethought extending over future centuries to watch with unerring care and select for any object the offspring of an organism produced under the foregoing circumstances."50 This masculine-gendered, all-penetrating being is still not identified with nature in this text; it stands outside of nature as its creator. It is this being that selects from the slight variations and inner structures of organisms to bring about the "perfect" adap- tations of plants and animals over "whole geological periods." In this sense "natural selection" is a "secondary means in the economy of nature by which the process of selection could go on adapting, nicely and wonderfully, organisms, if in ever so small a degree plastic, to diverse ends."'5' It is in the long manuscript of "Natural Selection" of 1856-1858 that we finally encounter the collapsing of the various images of nature as sustaining vital ground of life, as creator, and as selector into the notion of a single wise, perceiving "na- 47 Darwin, " 1842 Sketch," in The Foundations of the Origin of Species, ed.

Furthermore, the selecting agent has changed gender, in accordance with the long tradition of feminine gendering of nature: She cares not for mere external appearance; she may be said to scrutinise with a severe eye, every nerve, vessel &amp; muscle; every habit, instinct, shade of constitution, the whole machinery of the organisation. There will be here no caprice, no favouring: the good will be preserved &amp; the bad rigidly destroyed.... Nature is prodigal of time &amp; can act on thousands of thousands of generations: she is prodigal of the forms of life, if the right variation does not occur under changing conditions so as to be selected &amp; profit any one being, that form will be utterly exterminated as myriads have been. No complications are too great for nature: a contingency happening once in a thousand generations may lead to the extermination of a variety: she can gradually select, either simultaneously or successively, slight changes adapting the selected variety to a score of other beings, most widely apart in the great scale of nature. Can we wonder then, that nature's productions bear the stamp of a far higher perfec- tion than man's product by artificial selection. With nature the most gradual, steady, unerring, deep-sighted selection, perfect adaption [sic] to the conditions of exis- tence.... My purpose in pursuing the concept of nature in Darwin's thought in such detail has been to display its complexity and the varied sources that feed into the final language of the Origin of Species (1859) where we encounter "nature" in numerous senses: a repository of laws, a "polity," an "oeconomy," a producer of variations and of beings, a wise selector, and a "careful gardener" who cultivates seeds.54 Into this constellation of meanings, Darwin had collapsed the traditional role of the creating and sustaining deity of traditional theism.55 The "selector-nature" imagery of the first edition of the Origin of Species, as is 52 In the 1856 draft, Darwin for the first time explicitly defined "nature." In defining it as "the laws ordained by God to govern the Universe," he only imported a common deistic definition from the literature. (Charles Darwin, "Natural Selection," in Charles Darwin's "Natural Selection," ed. Robert Stauffer [Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1975], p. 224.) Darwin's definition is quite similar to that in the opening lines of Buffon's essay on nature from his Natural History, as translated by Smellie: "Nature is that system of laws established by the Creator for regulating the existence of bodies, and the succession of beings." (George Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, "Of Nature: First View," in idem, Natural History, trans. W Smellie, ed. W. Woods, 20 vols. [London: Cadell, 1812], vol. 3, pp. 447-79, on p. 447). Darwin had worked through the Smellie translation in the summer of 1840 (MS DAR 119). 53 Darwin, "Natural Selection" (cit. n. 52), pp. 224-5. 54 This summary is based on my review of the 253 occurrences of the term "nature" in the first edition of the Origin, tabulated in the computerized index of Paul H. Barrett, Donald J. Weinshank, and Timothy T. Gottleber, A Concordance to Darwin's Origin of Species, First Edition (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell Univ. Press, 1981). 55 The terms "creation" (45 instances), "created" (51), and "creator" (7) are only occasionally en- countered in the first edition. "Creation" and its related cognates are employed most often negatively as an inadequate alternative to Darwin's natural selectionist account. Only in the lone reference to the "laws impressed on matter by the Creator" that stand behind the "production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world. .. due to secondary causes" do we have clear reference to an external creator (Darwin, Origin of Species [1859], 1 st ed., facsimile, ed. E. Mayr [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1966], p. 488.) Reference to "nature" in some substantive role as the active selector upon variations, or as the source of order, with intentional-designing powers similar to that of human art, occurs in 21 uses, with the majority confined to chapters 4 and 14. This excludes the 271 uses of the term "natural selection" in some variant.</page><page sequence="16">266 PHILLIP R. SLOAN well known, was a topic of considerable controversy. Following criticism that he had smuggled in an intentional efficient cause by personifying nature in the act of "natural" selection,56 Darwin responded in the third edition (1861) with the follow- ing rejoinder, maintained in all subsequent editions: Several writers have misapprehended or objected to the term Natural Selection.... It has been said that I speak of natural selection as an active power or Deity; but who objects to an author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movement of the planets? Every one knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical expres- sions; and they are almost necessary for brevity. So again it is difficult to avoid personi- fying the word Nature; but I mean by Nature, only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us. With a little familiarity such superficial objections will be forgotten.57 The issue was not, however, quite so straightforward as he suggests in this pas- sage. If his appeals to an intentional and selecting nature become much more muted, or qualified as merely metaphorical in subsequent drafts of the Origin and the works that followed it, this is not the case with reference to his earlier notion of nature as the pantheistic source and ground of being.58 To judge from Darwin's own testimony in the Autobiography, to be sure, he had abandoned his earlier adherence to the conception of nature of his Beagle years. Referring explicitly to this period, he spoke of his loss of the sense of the religious "sublime": The state of mind which grand scenes formerly excited in me, and which was intimately connected with a belief in God, did not essentially differ from that which is often called the sense of sublimity; and however difficult it may be to explain the genesis of this sense, it can hardly be advanced as an argument for the existence of God, any more than the powerful though vague and similar feelings excited by music.59 As John Campbell has argued convincingly, however, Darwin's earlier "affective" response to nature can nonetheless be traced into his last writings.60 The degree to which it can be related to some kind of abiding theistic dimension of Darwin's sci- ence can now be examined. V. CONSTITUTIVE THEISM AND DARWINIAN EVOLUTION The question at issue in the present volume-the degree to which theistic beliefs have concretely influenced the content of science requires an answer that can sat- 56 This criticism had been raised by Charles Lyell in a letter to Darwin dated 15 June 1860 (Corre- spondence, vol. 8, p. 255) and again by William Henry Harvey in a letter of 24 Aug. 1860 (ibid., p. 329). Darwin replied, in response to these and similar criticisms, that "natural selection" would better have been termed "natural preservation" (ibid., pp. 371, 389, 397, 403, 416). 57 Charles Darwin, Origin of Species, 3rd ed.

I am suggesting that there was a deeper connection between God and nature in Darwin's "sublime" of these early years.</page><page sequence="17">DARWIN ON NATURE AND DIVINITY 267 isfy certain criteria of definition. John Brooke has set out in his essay ("Religious Belief and the Content of the Sciences") a set of criteria for religious practice by individual scientists that reasonably includes private devotions, evidence for the study of sacred texts, concern with prophecy, and efforts to evangelize. In terms of such criteria, it seems difficult to argue that there is a significant linkage between theistic belief, defined in terms of religious practice, and Darwin's science. The ex- ternal evidence of religious practice in Darwin's years at Downe seem insufficient, on Brooke's criteria, to distinguish genuine belief from duties of social class and a concern to maintain signs of social respectability.6' Consequently, there still might seem to be little in the evidence presented to chal- lenge Neal Gillespie's picture of a Darwin who moved from "special creationism" to a later agnostic "positivism." Darwin's use of metaphors in the Origin of Species that most strongly suggest traditional theistic views-the notion of a providential "selector nature" working for divinely ordained, if not humanly discernible, ends- we have seen to be somewhat ephemeral in his writings, metaphors that almost, if not entirely, disappeared from his writings after 1862.62 If we define "religious" motivations to involve some kind of belief in the transcen- dent, in an objective foundation of a moral order, and as the source of answers to the main questions of life and death, a constitutive and even religious significance in Darwin's appeal to "nature" is more plausible. However, this would require some distinction of religious beliefs from constituting "metaphysical" beliefs in the sense distinguished by Stephen Wykstra in his chapter of the present volume ("Religious Beliefs, Metaphysical Beliefs, and Historiography of Science"). Even in Darwin's last works, his conception of nature serves the following func- tions within his thought. First, his belief in some kind of substantive, abiding nature supplies the foundation for the epistemological realism that underlies his science, the justification, for example, for his crucial inferences from anatomical resem- blances to the postulation of common historical descent. It sustains the confidence with which he leaps from anatomical homologies to conclusions about mental pow- ers and their continuity in organic life. If his mature conception of nature is neither teleological nor providential in a traditional Greek or Judeo-Christian sense, it is nonetheless a sustaining ground that underpins his naturalistic epistemology and rescues it from a potentially debilitating skepticism, with only occasional glimmer- ings of the "horrid doubt" that sometimes troubled him as he reflected on the impli- cations of his theory for knowledge itself.63 Second, nature, for Darwin, also grounds the "materialism" of Darwinian theory. As Ernan McMullin has argued in a recent essay, the definition of "materialism" has too frequently been assumed to be transparently univocal in philosophical controversies 61 Moore, "Darwin of Down" (cit. n. 1). 62 E.g., of the 152 occurrences of the term "nature" in the Descent qf Man, only one suggests the notion of nature as a selective agent.

SLOAN within the life sciences, as if this were not an extremely complex issue involving many levels of meaning.64 That is particularly the case with reference to Darwin's "ma- terialism." Darwin's most abiding conception of nature, I have argued in this essay, is not that of a "selector" but that of a source of vitality, consciousness, and the intercon- nections of phenomena. Seen within this framework, Darwin's "materialism" means primarily an explanatory reductionism of "higher" functions, such as reflection, to a more general level of organic existence, but it is never a reduction to an inert materialism that presumably explains the higher properties from the inorganic forces of matter. On this reading, Darwin's materialism is more akin to the monism of German Naturphilosophie of Humboldt's variety than it is to the Kraft und Stoff materialism of Ludwig BUchner and the other scientific materialists of his age. Third, the conception of nature as source and ground of life undergirds the perva- sive anthropomorphism in his analysis of conscious phenomena, as we see him attri- bute playfulness to insects65 or constructive foresight and the glimmering of intel- ligent behavior to earthworms.' This language functions as more than literary metaphor. It runs much deeper in Darwin's work, and it represents a long tradition of reflection in his writings that connects his later works to the reflections of the Beagle, when he wondered about the "co-will" that operated in the lowly colonial zoophytes. To the end of his life Darwin stood "in awe before the mystery of life."67 If nature could at times present to his view a scenario of suffering, parasitism, predation, and sheer waste of life that conjured up the image of nature presented by Hume's Philo rather than that reflecting the governance of some kind of benevolent creator,68 it also continued to manifest for him scenes of wonder and beauty. Unchanged in the revised 1877 edition of the Various Contrivances by Which Orchids are Fertilised bv Insects, we find the following claim: The more I study nature, the more I become impressed with ever-increasing force, that the contrivances and beautiful adaptations slowly acquired through each part occasion- ally varying in a slight degree but in many ways, with the preservation of those varia- tions which were beneficial to the organism under complex and ever-varying conditions of life, transcend in an incomparable manner the contrivances and adaptations which the most fertile imagination of man could invent. These are not contrivances imposed by an external creator on a passive material nature in the tradition of British natural theology. They are rather properties that emerge from the immanent constructive activities of nature itself. 64 Ernan McMullin, "Biology and the Theology of the Human," in Controlling Our Destinies: His- tori cal, Philosophical and Ethical Perspectives on the Human Genome Project, ed.

He could not endure the feeling of breaking any law of the most trivial kind, even the most harmless form of trespassing made him uncomfortable and he avoided it[.... ] As regards his respect for the laws of nature it might be called rever- ence if not a religious feeling. No man could feel more intensely the vastness or the inviolability of the laws of nature, and especially the helplessness of mankind Except [sic] so far as the laws were obeyed. He had almost a terror of any infringement however slight of the laws of health, &amp; he would laugh at one as being illogical for such a remark as "just one glass of port" can do no harm. Though obeyance to the laws of naturee &lt;&lt;natural laws&gt;&gt; and a deep sense of the power of nature may be called in his case a religious feeling, In- one sense he had no religious sentiment. I remember after Tyn- dall's Belfast address my Father told me that he asked Tyndall whether he really did feel the was conscious of the same sentiments towards nature as towards a divine power (I forget his exact words)[;] my father told me with a smile that Tyndall hummed and hawed &amp; said something about the glory of sunsets &amp;c. There was a vague poetic feeling in him[.] I remember his once saying Either [sic] about the orchis [sic] book or the struggle in nature referred to at the end of the origin [sic] that he almost felt that he could write poetry about it.7' We still may legitimately ask if Darwin's sense of awe and wonder in the face of the remarkable habits and structures of organisms, or his almost reverent response to nature, even in the writings of the last years, is a religious, as distinct from a metaphysical, belief. On several criteria, it would be difficult to term it more than a substitute for traditional theism. Except to the degree that we can detect a weak but enduring affirmation of a possible larger purposiveness in the universe in his writ- ings,72 the "nature" Darwin leaves standing is neither the passive repository of laws ordained by a creator-God, the material order sustained by God's immediate creative action, nor the deistic nature that fulfills divine purposes through the action of natu- ral laws. In his mature writings, it is also not a teleological agency that acts for inherent ends as a "selector" in a form that would logically connect it with classical Greek and natural theological traditions. Yet as his son William's recollection highlights, Darwin's "nature" was something more than a mere metaphysical premise. If William Darwin is correct, it was also a source of moral order for Darwin, not in the sense of a system displaying obvious design and contrivance, but as a lawful system on which one could rely for ethical norms, serving as the source and foundation for life. To this extent, we can affirm that cognitive premises of a quasi-religious nature do indeed play a significant role in Darwin's science. 70 See Richards, "Darwin's Romantic Biology" (cit. n. 16), pp. 141-8. 71 William Darwin to Francis Darwin, 4 Jan. 1883, MS DAR 112 (ser. 2), 3d verso-3e recto.
