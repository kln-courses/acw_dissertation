<plain_text><page sequence="1">Empedocles' hymn to Apollo FRIEDRICH SOLMSEN Although ancient testimonies credit Empedocles with a larger number of works,1 editors and other scholars have been unanimous in dividing the preserved fragments between two, the physical poem and the Katharmoi. Diels' decisions in particular have enjoyed great authority; for while on the sequence of fragments within each of these two works debate was bound to continue, his distribution of the material between the two poems has by and large gone unchallenged. The main exception is B 131-134 which Diels placed in the Katharmoi, even though B 134 is definitely attested for Book III of 7npiL wVws. Actually of the forty-two fragments which Diels assigned to the Katharmoi only one (B 112) is explicitly identified (by Diogenes Laertius, 8.62) as a passage of this work, and it must be admitted that the revolutionary efforts of N. van der Ben2 who proposes to shift more than two-thirds of these fragments to the proem of nrrpi c'aews do not conflict with any item of ancient evidence. The very limited objective which I am pursuing excludes a scrutiny of van der Ben's arguments. I must content myself with expressing my con- viction that the great majority of the fragments in question have found their rightful home in the Katharmoi. Yet B131-134, the passages bearing on the true nature of the deity, continue to present a serious problem - or, to put it more precisely, two problems. For Tzetzes quotes B134 from the Third Book of nTpi CaEWS,3 which means that if we accept his testimony we must not only transfer B 134 and the three other fragments to the physical poem but must admit for this work the existence of a Third Book in opposition to Diels who was adamant about limiting it to two. The arguments which Diels4 used to discredit Tzetzes' attribution are rather subjective. After the well reasoned protests of Bignone, Kahn and Zuntz5 we may as well admit the existence of a Third Book of wEpl pVtUEWS; but it is essential to realize what this amounts to. For regardless of what view we take of the original "publication" and later transmission of Empedocles' poems - subjects on which we might as well confess our abysmal ignorance6 - no author of the fifth century B.C., whether man or god (see B23. 11; 111.4), produced an authoritative or standard edition of his own works and settled once for all their division into Books. Generally speaking, such divisions were fixed by the Alexandrians.7 Whether 219</page><page sequence="2">Alexandrian scholars worked on the text of Empedocles, whether one or several editions were produced either by them or elsewhere in the Hellen- istic era, and whether any ancient edition of his poems enjoyed a special reputation and authority are questions which we are in no position to decide. All that a Byzantine reference to Book III suggests is that in late antiquity there existed one or several editions of ffpi qViaEs in three Books. The same fragment (B 134) concerning the true nature of the deity which Tzetzes on one of the three occasions where he quotes it ascribes to To ,rpLrov Tr&amp;v qvuxLXv is also preserved in Ammonius Hermeiou's commen- tary on Aristotle's de interpretatione. The words by which he introduces it deserve close attention: . . . 6 'Axpxyavtvvos ao's ...

Diels and Wilamowitz8 insisted on accepting the information about Empedocles' special concern with Apollo, but although they refer to a tradition crediting him with a hymn to this god, neither they nor, to the best of my knowledge, any other scholars think of this hymn as a work in its own right. Yet Empedocles' authorship of a "proem," or (what comes to the same) "hymn" to Apollo appears in the testimonia,9 and B 131, one of our four fragments: ?i yap E1F?LEPLWV EVEXEV TLVOS, Op43poTT Moi,ox, rpovg JLEXVTOs &lt;a6be TOL&gt; BLa (pPOVTL8os iXOEtv, f- XOMv VWvV XUVTE, 1TcxpioTaGO, KcaXXL0TELxa, lpi, OEC?V Rxx6ptv &amp;yxOov X6yov EqpaiVOVTL would fit a proem to the celebration if not of Apollo in particular yet of To ,eaov in the sense suggested by Ammonius.10 That our four passages, B 131-134, actually belong to this hymn is a possibility which deserves close examination.'1 For the arguments in favor of this attribution are far from negligible. In the first place, the remarkably specific indications contained in Ammonius' testimony are apt to inspire confidence. I do not wish to decide whether he himself read the "hymn" or whether he owes his knowledge to the earlier Neoplatonists whom he was in the habit of using'2 and among whom Porphyry certainly was familiar with Empedocles. If the reasons for trusting Ammonius are good, those for crediting Empedocles with a hymn to Apollo are even better. The special significance which Apollo had for Pythagoras'3 was probably shared by all those devoted to his ,I'os. Moreover for Empedocles seers, physicians, poets and political leaders 220</page><page sequence="3">('rrpo6ol) represent the noblest and final reincarnations before the return to the gods; Empedocles himself combines in his person three and perhaps even all four of these professions.'4 The three of which we are sure - seer, physician and poet - belong to the province and enjoy the protection of Apollo. We must now consider the grounds for a more skeptical attitude. The testimony for Empedocles' hymn to Apollo-Helios in a treatise ascribed to the rhetorician Menander'5 is confusing rather than satisfactory, and Diogenes Laertius where he refers to the "proem" reports that it was burnt, citing Aristotle's dialogue 'repi TOl'qTCV for charging a sister of Empedocles with this "error," and the Peripatetic Hieronymus for charging Empedoc- les' daughter.16 In Wehrli's opinion "das Verbrennen der Schriften be- deutet dass dieselben nie vorhanden gewesen waren."''7 "Nie" may be an overstatement. What appears to be the case is that the hymn like other works attributed to Empedocles was lost or not available in the latter half of the fourth and the former half of the third century B.C. (if we treat the learning of the Peripatetics with the respect to which they are entitled we shall beware of minimizing their testimonies). This however need not be the entire story. The hymn or parts of it may easily have become known in the Hellenistic centuries. Wondering how this may have happened, one inevitably thinks of the enormous efforts made by Callimachus and other Alexandrian scholars to take stock of whatever had been written by the 'v ITfL -ML&amp;L'a B&amp;Ivitoav'rS. Yet the hymn may just as well have been "Srediscovered" (if this is the word) in the period of revived interest in Pythagoreanism, i.e. in the first centuries B.C. and A.D., when besides many forgeries some genuine material would have had a chance. But there is no point in trying to be specific. In fact discovery or rediscovery is by no means the only explanation that comes to mind. Impressive sections or passages of the hymn may have survived in memory and been passed on - whether orally or in writing hardly matters. Not being recognized as parts of the hymn, they could, especially as long as there was no regular, carefully prepared edition, become included in one or the other of the major poems - or indeed partly in one, partly in the other, provided the two poems were always distinguished and kept apart.19 Attributions to wrong works and similar mistakes were committed even by the outstanding Alexandrian critics and in authors treated with all resources of their TEXV' .20 Fortunately we need not decide how parts or passages of the hymn were preserved as long as we know that they could be preserved. Instead of forcing a rational pattern on the vagaries of the tradition we had better 221</page><page sequence="4">make the most of the precious debris that seem to have reached us. First however we must examine whether these pieces could not after all have their true place in one of the more famous poems. Here we are not moving over untrodden ground. For whatever view we take about Diels' and Bignone's final decisions regarding the four frag- ments,21 Diels did advance strong arguments against assigning them to i?Ept cpvueQs and Bignone for equally good reasons declared them alien to the atmosphere and spirit of the Katharmoi. To be sure, opinions formulated in 1898 and 1916 must be brought up to date. What we find in the physical poem can no longer be regarded as "mechanical mixtures" that leave no room for a personal deity.22 Rather, the elements themselves are divine, and so are Philotes and Neikos, but their divinity is of a kind that could not readily tolerate the company of a (piiv [Epi xvi 'o5EqxrToS (B 134). For the activity of a cppiv whose "quick thoughts alight" anywhere in the world is quite different from the GVV&amp;YELV of Love as well as from the &amp;LUTCivaL of Strife whom some scholars prefer to see in the ascendence.23 In B21.13 and 26.3 we read avxr&amp; y&amp;p ?al'r T)TaVTa with reference to the four elements and the two antagonistic powers: "they alone are" (scil. fully real, other gods being of long life, 8OXLXaxLovcs B23.8, i.e. not eternal). The presence of some identical lines in the description of the Sphairos in which, however briefly, all diversity has disappeared and in that of the ubiquitous Mind may find its explanation - though not by supposing them to be one and the same deity.24 Finally, 81O and 111 give the impression of concluding a revelation about physical matters, while B131 (quoted above p. 220) looks more like the introduction to a new message than to another part of the same message. Couched in the solemn prayer formula familiar from Homer, Sappho, and others: "if ever in the past you heard my voice ... help me now,"25 it refers to earlier jiEXrxaL in which the Muse cooperated "for the sake of a mortal" and distinguishes these earlier thoughts from a "noble account"" now to be set forth.26 The earlier [irX&amp;,aL are those for which the Muse is invoked in B3 (3-8) and which Pausanias, obviously the "mortal," is in B110. lf. urged to keep intact by his own persistent efforts. We may also note that for the earlier enterprise the sense organs are called into action and are evidently quite adequate, provided all of them are used and no single one favored to the detriment of the others (B3.9-13),27 whereas the right understanding of the divinity is not within the power of eyes or hands (B133) or, we may confidently add, of any other sense function. Since the nature of "the divine" is defined as Tppiv, qppv or wpaCxir&amp;s in the right condition (B 132.1) would be the human organ(s) able to grasp it.28 222</page><page sequence="5">In the Katharmoi the life of the gods from which the sinner is banished and to which he may return after moving from element to element and from incarnation to incarnation is presented in a very concrete and as Bignone puts it "mythic" fashion.29 Anthropomorphism, if not asserted, seems yet to be implied. In B134 it is repudiated. To worship Cypris by means of statues and paintings and to share the home and banquets of the gods (B 128, 147) are attractive prospects but such happiness - 6Xofos and TI (1 19) - or a paradisical community producing cplOqpOavVq (B 130) between gods (?), humans and animals is hard to visualize if the deity is a "holy mind" constantly active in the world (B134). Moreover in the Katharmoi too the pre-eminent deity is Philotes-Cypris-Aphrodite (B 128), not Apollo. And that the same prophet who in the beginning of this poem addresses his fellow citizens as a god, relying on his own authority, his wisdom and his mantic gifts (B 1 12), should later (B 131) invoke the help of the Muse arouses suspicion which is strengthened when we notice how different the subject for which he turns to the Muse is from the story of sin and expiation, the OV'RLcT4a and Oeoyovia (whatever their precise meaning) embodied in the poem.30 Basing his opinion on Ammonius' and especially on "Menander's" tes- timony, Wilamowitz insisted that Empedocles must have spoken of his god at much greater length (4"viel breiter"); conceivably the "god of Pytha- goras" may have represented the Odrov as such.31 I should take a similar view but support it by the announcement in B131 rather than by the tantalizingly unclear passage in "Menander." Even what little we have embodies significant new ideas. For while Empedocles, as has often been noted, with his protest against anthropomorphic gods in B 134 finds himself in the tradition of Xenophanes32 he adds to the inherited thoughts the ab- sence of sex ( u6ta, 134.3)33 and, no less important, replaces the god who without effort or motion "swings everything" v6ou qppevt (21 B 25 D-K) by a mighty qppjv whose swift thoughts operate everywhere in the world. The difference between voivs and cppivem is hard to define. Still, now that Snell has shown how broad a spectrum of active and passive experiences is covered by the word CppiV,34 we understand why Xenophanes when specifying the activity of his god added the genitive v6ov to CppVr. In contrast to Anaxagoras who used vois (and was followed by Plato in Timaeus and elsewhere) Empedocles identified his divine power as a qppnv, whose modes of action while decidedly non-physical are less circumscribed than that of vovs. Since qppov-rs too has a wide range, the manifestations of Empedocles' ppilv remain elusive; wishing not to restrict them unduly, we may recall the variety of actions by which Plato's world-soul ayeL . . . 223</page><page sequence="6">TOvLTa TOL xaT' oVpavov. . . and which are named ovlEaE'&amp;, OXO1TELOOa0L, E?TrLtEXdElaal, 3OVXEVEi'0aL, 8OE&amp;?ELV XT\. (Legg. 10. 896e8 ff.). Xenophanes had considered it undignified for god to move from place to place35 but for a deity as spiritual as it was possible to conceive at that time, to stay put is not necesessarily the appropriate condition.36 Aristotle's god who is vois is again "unmoved"; but, to say nothing of the quite novel arguments that lead to him, his self-centered purely contemplative attitude puts him at a large distance from Empedocles' - actually or potentially - ubiquitous qppAv. If we wonder about the objects of the god's oai qpOVTL'6?s, B 135 with its proclamation of the universally valid law (To 'raxVT.V vo'ptOv) may provide a clue.37 Should it be the god's concern to uphold this law that "stretches" throughout the world? In archaic thought a sublime conception of the deity is often associated with true justice and with a kind of law that transcends the man-made. Tpiq?0VTaL . . . IT&amp;VTES o' &amp;VOp61TELOL vo6RoL iv'rro kV6S TOV hELOV (Heracl. B 114) may suffice to illustrate the well known pattern. For Empedocles' voIxRtov in B 135 we have every reason to trust Aristotle and Iamblichus (quoted ad B 135) who define it as protecting the sanctity and kinship of all life and outlawing the slaughter of animals. These are Empedocles' most deep-seated convictions on which we find him most outspoken in the Katharmoi (see esp. B 136-139); yet they also in- spired fundamental tenets of the physical poem.38 Still it may be prudent to leave B135 to the Katharmoi. Even without such dubious support the 'po 8ES of the god are more likely to focus on the moral conditions in the world than on physical developments. May it be his task to punish sacrilege and sin (in the Pythagorean definition of this word)? Or to control incarn- ations and reincarnations - as the god of Plato's Laws does not reshuffle the elements but allots higher or lower incorporations to souls in accord- ance with their record in previous lives (10.903c5-905a4)?39 In the light of B131 and 134 one hesitates to think of the hymn as embodying conven- tional topics but Empedocles would not lack originality even if he celebrated Apollo as omniscient and wise, as the guardian of purity, the inspiration of prophets and poets. Finally the equation of Apollo and Helios, however unlikely in itself and however unsatisfactorily attested in a muddled passage,40 is after all the only specific item recorded for the hymn; instead of dismissing it out of hand, we had better allow it to contain some vestige of truth which other students of Empedocles may find easier to discern than I do. If B 131 is no part of the Katharmoi, the argument on the strength of which this poem has usually been considered later than -npi cpaoews is no 224</page><page sequence="7">longer valid. Empedocles may well have known himself to be one of the elect and on the way back to the gods even at the time when he taught Pausanias that there is no coming-to-be and no oViXoVvov &amp;ava'TOLO TeXFeVnl but only mixture and dissolution of one mixture to provide the components for others.41 Parmenides' proclamation of a reality which was aryeVqTOV and &amp;vAe&amp;pov made possible a physical system whose basic tenets were somehow parallel to the religious convictions that Empedocles owed to the Pythagoreans. No wise man would believe that he ceases to be when he dies or begins to be when he is born.42 Both major poems imple- ment this fundamental statement, even though they do so in quite different fashion. Whether more specific doctrines of the two poems harmonize with one another or whether Empedocles changed his opinions unconcerned about consistency, whether stability or lability is the characteristic trait of his personality are large subjects that lie outside the limited area of this paper.

The 15E-LL TpOLrFiscs extolled in B 132 are in Empedocles' pattern of thought minds in the right condition to grasp To -eiov. 11 Unlike others, Zuntz in his very admirable contribution (see n. 5, 241 f.) does not believe that B13 1 and 132 should share the fate of B 133 and 134. Most of his arguments are met by my view of the hymn as a separate poem. The change from the plural O1rZJv in B 131 and 132 to what looks like a singular in B 134 may be facilitated by the collective 225</page><page sequence="8">sense of 70 'tiOV (see n. 10). Moreover the Greeks are known to be remarkably indifferent to the alternative of one or many gods. Cf. e.g. Guthrie, HGPh 1, 375; 5.360. Examples: Xenoph.

Of modern editors Heinrich Stein (Empedoclis Agrigentini Fragmenta, Bonn and London, 1852) seems to have been the first to separate the two poems. 20 A few examples must suffice. Pi., Pyth 2 and Nem. 9, 10, 11 owe their places to error. Two "Homeric" hymns, the Pythian and the Delian were treated as one. The Theogony, the Opera and the Odyssey (against the better knowledge of Aristophanes and Aris- tarchus) were continued beyond their actual conclusions. There are spurious dialogues in Aristophanes' trilogies of Plato; spurious orations in the corpus of Lysias, Demosthenes, etc. None of these examples forms an exact parallel to the fate of Empedocles' hymn and some are disputed. Yet far more could be listed. Even in the bibliographically sophis- ticated 20th century a Contra Sainte-Beuve of Marcel Proust was constructed by Bernard de Fallois (Paris, 1954) from material never meant for such purpose (cf. Pierre Clarac, ed., Marcel Proust, Contre Sainte-Beuve . . ., Paris, 1971, 819 ff. I owe the information to the kindness of Germaine Bree). 21 See above pp. 219. 22 Diels' emphasis on the mechanical aspect reflects the correct impression that the divine entities of the physical poem are not "free" in their modes of action. The xa)reduaELv of B 134 is not possible for any of them. 23 See esp. B 17.7 f., 20; 21.7 f.; 26.5 f.; 35.4 f.; 8 f. al. For the alternative interpretations of the cosmic cycle cf. A. A. Long in Alexander P. D. Mourelatos (ed.), The Presocratics (Garden City, N.Y., 1974) 397 ff. 24 B29.1 f. = B 134.2 f. The coincidence is in negative statements appropriate on both occasions. Problems concerning the relation of B26, 28 and 29 remain. In the thought of the physical poem B29. 1 f. is less in place than B26. I f. See however below p. 227, n. 33. 1 suppose that Hippolytus or his source when quoting B29 left out a line identical with or corresponding to B 134. 1. Against the arbitrary equation of oWacipos and q)piv see Guthrie HGPh 2.258. Shirley Darcus, Phronesis 22 (1977), 175 ff. takes far too much for granted. 25 See e.g. I. 1.453; 5.115; Sappho 1.5 ff.; S.. OT 165 f. More examples will be found in Paul Maas, Kleine Schriften (Munich, 1973) 183. 226</page><page sequence="9">26 Is the message about the gods also "for the sake of a mortal" or is it addressed to a larger public? I incline to the latter alternative. In B131.2. I am satisfied with &lt;&amp;`&amp; TOL suppl. Wilamowitz and Maas&gt; &amp;6t fppovribos 'EXEiv. As Wilamowitz, op. cit. (above n. 8) 643 finds &amp;-ycotv X6-yov acceptable, I hesitate to propose &amp;-yv6v X6yov which seems to have more meaning. 27 At B 17.21 vovs is for once called into action to discern a deity (Aphrodite) whom the eyes cannot see. We could imagine a similar function of vovs in the hymn. 28 These differences which lead us to attribute B131-4 to another poem need not have prevented an ancient editor from placing whatever he had of the hymn (without knowing its provenance) with other matter in a Third Book of srrpi qpvosfs; cf. n. 20. - As B13 1.1 with its yap can hardly have been the opening line of the hymn, B13 1.1 and B133 may have had their places somewhere before B 131, just as B2 is known to have preceded B3. Note the similarity between B2.7 f. and B 133. 29 Op. cit. 640. Cf. Zuntz, op. cit. 218 on B 134. 30 See Porph., de abst. 2.2 (quoted ad B 128). Zuntz, 212 f., assigns B131 to the proem of the Second Book of the Katharmoi. (For the existence of two Books cf. H. Hunger, Jahrb. Oesterr. Byz. Ges. 16, 1967, 5.) If this were the case it would mean that an ancient editor realized how much it differed from most of the Katharmoi. 31 Op. cit.

This word, which should probably be read in B29.3, goes far to allay my doubts about B29; see above n. 24. 34 Der Weg zum Denken und zur Wahrheit (Hypomnemata 57, Gottingen, 1978) 53 ff., esp. 59.
