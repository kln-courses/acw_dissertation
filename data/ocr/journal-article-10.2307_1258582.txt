<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Greek Folk Songs of the Lower World by JOHN MAVROGORDATO I WHAT is written here is really - I begin to see now - only the beginning, one very small scratch at the surface, of a much larger investigation of the meanings of folk song and folktale - and that is why this journey to the World of the Dead, as it appears in some Greek Folk Songs, begins in a hesitating and roundabout manner. Well then - how did I come to make this journey into the twi- light realm of Gloomie Hades? I had been reading Professor Dawkins' 45 Folktalesfrom the Dodekanese, and had been impressed by part of the Introduction in which he explains how 'ideas and feelings about life', ideas and feelings which cannot be directly expressed and often remain unconscious or not consciously formu- lated, may be 'conveyed in the concrete external shape of a story', and after that I began to think that any work of art, if it is good enough to survive at all, must express more than the maker's conscious beliefs and must include some serious statement about the nature of the world. All good folktales and all good folk songs have a hidden meaning, that is why they survive. Even, I thought, in the brain of James Barrie some feeling about the nature of Time and History must have been germinating when he wrote in Peter Pan about the Crocodile which swallowed the Alarm Clock; and I wondered if he had ever heard the Chinese folktale about the Dragon that swallowed the Moon. From that my thoughts went to Alice in Wonderland which tells us not only a great deal about the hidden temperament of Lewis Carroll but also something he had felt about life, and something more than he found satisfactorily expressed in his religion. If this feeling of his was of any importance, the view that it expressed, or the feeling that produced such a view, would be shared by others, and a similar expression of it would turn up somewhere else. That led to 539</page><page sequence="2">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD thoughts about the World under the Ground, the World Below, the Underworld. 2 Thinking of Alice reminded me again of one of the Tales from the Dodekanese, of number XV - The Daughter of the Schoolmistress. This little girl was taken out one day by two of her little friends to pick some pot-herbs for supper and soon they got tired of showing her the right leaves to look for and left her alone sitting under a tree. And there as she was poking about in the earth with a stick she saw a marble slab with a ring in it, and of course she pulled up the slab, and there was a round hole or well, down which she went, down forty steps, and soon found in a cupboard thirty-nine keys which opened the doors in a palace, and 'there' - we are off now - 'close by the palace was a very beautiful garden, and she went into it to take a stroll'. Just like Alice - and this is the beginning for both little girls of a succession of wonderful adventures. This Underland in fact is only Wonderland, in which anything may happen. It is the world of Faery in which the laws of nature and of every- day life are suspended. You get to it down a well - or up a tower, which of course comes to the same thing - I forget now who first discovered that a tower is only a well turned inside out - and this may be just a storyteller's formula for beginning a 'fairytale' which does not expect to be believed. (A 'fairytale' is a folktale for children; not all folktales are meant for children.) But it is no laughing matter to be enchanted or spellbound in Fairyland; for it is also the world Under the Hill; the realm of the Queen ofElfland - 'At ilka tett of her horse's mane1 Hung fifty silver bells and nine' - and she held Thomas the Rhymer under her spell and 'Till seven years were past and gone True Thomas on earth was never seen.' It is the realm of the Queen of the Fairies who caught young Tam Lin 'In yon green hill to dwell'.2 Of this dangerous land of enchantment not much is heard in 1 Child, no. 37, p. 64. 2 Child, no. 39, p. 68. 540</page><page sequence="3">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD Greek ballads, unless it is to be found in the group of ballads3 about a Haunted Well, which tell an old and incoherent story about a younger son who plunges into a serpent-haunted well to find a jewel thrown into it; a story said to go back to an ancient Greek myth about the gold ring of Minos which Theseus with the help of Amphitrite brought back from the bottom of the sea; - the sea which in folklore is always as Flecker thought of it - 'The dragon-green, the luminous, the dark, the serpent-haunted sea'. That is Wonderland in which anything may happen. It is not the World Below, the World of the Dead, in which hardly anything happens at all. 3 The Under World properly so called, the 'Kingdom of gloomie Dis', the ancient Greek Kingdom of Hades, Hades who was brother of great Zeus himself and hardly less powerful, this land of the unseen was for Homer, and still is in modern Greece, the Land of the Dead. Hades in modern Greece has become only the name of his kingdom. The personality of the god Hades, never very dis- tinct, has faded out altogether, and the land is ruled by Charos, or Death, who used to be in Ancient Greek mythology only the ferryman of the dead, Charon. The modern Charos has not only absorbed altogether the person- ality of the ancient god Hades; he has also usurped the function of Thanatos, or Death, the messenger from the Lower World, who comes, as in the play of Alkestis, to carry her off, but is met by Herakles arriving on a visit, who overcomes Thanatos and so restores his hostess to life. (Euripides, as Professor Rose remarks, has clearly based his play on a folktale, and we may regard it as good evidence of popular belief.3) In modern Greece Charos is his own messenger. He likes to have a bout of wrestling with a boastful shepherd; or a young girl proud of her beauty he will drag away by the hair; young men and maidens, old men and little children he snatches them up and hangs them over his saddle. He 'wrestles with the dying man' - not exactly 'for his soul'; he takes no interest in souls. He wrestles with the dying man for his life, 3 H. J. Rose, Greek Mythology, p. 265; Polites, no. 90o, p. 147; Gneftos, p. I. 541</page><page sequence="4">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD and, as of course he always wins, he takes away his faculty of living in the Upper World. This is the only interest of Charos. He takes no interest in any of the moral or spiritual values implied by the word SOUL; and like his ancient prototype Hades or Pluto he has no knowledge of Good or Evil. There was no principle of Evil, no Devil in ancient Greek mythology; he seems to have arrived later, from Persia or Syria. The regions of Tartaros which were the gloomy abode of Hades, were not 'Hell', they were not a place of punishment or reward; and the modern Lower World, the modern Hades, the abode of the Dead, is also not a place of punishment or reward. Hades is not Hell. The fusion of Heaven and Hell into one Lower World, which seems to be exactly the same as the Homeric Land of the Dead, the twilight groves of Persephone, has indeed gone so far in modern popular belief, that a song from the mainland begins with the words: 'I will go down to Hades, And down to Paradise, And there I'll meet with Death himself And tell him once or twice' .. .4 In this song Hades and Paradise are evidently regarded by the singer as alternative synonyms for the Lower World. This Lower World is not Hell. It is only a place where the dead whisper and sigh for the life they have lost, as long as they remember it; and they do not remember it very long. The visit of Odysseus in the Odyssey (xi, 146 ff.) shows that they could hardly remember it at all unless they were given a drink of blood. There is no suggestion of punishment - of selective punish- ment - in the ancient Greek Underworld other than the general punishment of not being alive. Ethical feeling prompted or com- pelled the addition at some later date of the Elysian Plain as an Afterworld for a few highly favoured mortals, or rather for a few living men made immortal. Instead of dying in the ordinary way they were 'translated' body and soul together; and the principal rewards they enjoyed were the blessing of not being dead, and a slight improvement in the climate. As for the later Greek mystery religions, Eleusinian, or Orphic, or Pythagorean, which combined theories of pre-existence with Merlier, Tragoudia tes Roumeles, p. 67. 542</page><page sequence="5">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD metempsychosis and other systems of posthumous compensation, religious beliefs which may be found reflected and idealized in Pindar, and in Plato - who was however extremely cautious in his admissions5 - all these religions were never popular beliefs and come to us from a different level of culture. From the level perhaps of consciously educative culture on which Vergil wrote - you remember the astonishment of Aeneas (Aen., vi, 720) that the souls of the dead should want to return to the Upper Air - quae lucis miseris tam dira cupido? - ? There is nothing like this in Ancient - or in Modern - Greece. 4 Only for the proper working of this system, this limbo of forget- fulness where the dead are soon forgotten, it is absolutely necessary that the dead should be somehow, however hurriedly, buried. A handful of earth puts them formally underground, in their proper place. 'This is one of the few beliefs', says Professor H. J. Rose," 'which seem to have remained quite untouched and unmodified throughout antiquity. It is natural enough. The House of Hades is regularly underground, and the very old belief that the dead con- tinue to have a sort of life in their graves never died out; it is clear that the body or ashes must be put underground somehow.' Once the bodies were safely underground there was little to be feared from them, and for them nothing to be hoped. The whole range of stories studied by G. H. Gerould in his book on The Grateful Dead' probably arose from the wish to illustrate or to en- force the duty of not leaving a body unburied; and the origin of that duty must have been the fear that if it were not buried it might get up and walk about. Here comes in the whole regiment of Vam- pires and Coffinleavers, a dangerous regiment and one too large to be reviewed here. Here also enters the Benevolent Corpse, who has been properly buried, but is so strongly attached to the Upper World by ties of duty or love, by a vow or a betrothal, that he rises 5 See, e.g. R. Hackforth on Immortality in Plato's Symposium in C.R., LXIV, 2, Sept. 1950. 6 Greek Mythology, p. go. 7 Folk-lore Society, 90o8. 543</page><page sequence="6">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD up, and manages to put in an appearance, his good intentions of course causing only embarrassment and horror. This is the bodily revenant, far commoner in the Greek world than the northern and western vaporous ghost which floats through keyholes and walls. Such a bodily revenant is the hero of the Greek ballad of The Dead Brother, a very old ballad which is well known all over the Balkans. A mother with several sons and only one daughter does not want the girl to marry abroad, but is persuaded to let her go to a distant country when one of the brothers promises he will bring her back if the mother wants her. A year of pestilence comes, all the brothers die, and the mother herself falls ill and curses the son who had persuaded her to let his sister go. (Notice incidentally the matriarchal selfishness which is characteristically Greek.) The dead brother rises from his grave, gallops up to his sister's door in the middle of the night, and rides furiously back with her, rides over mountains and through forests, where even the birds begin to speak.8 'But as they rode the little birds began to speak and said, "Who ever saw a fair maid go riding with the dead?" "My brother dear, and do you hear, the birds that sing and say - ?" "The birds that sing in April, sister, will make their nests in May." "My brother dear, your look is strange, you have an earthy smell - " "My horse smells of the earthy dyke, dear sister, where he fell." ' This ballad has spread all over Europe. From a folktale embody- ing this story the German poet Gottfried Biirger (I747-94) wrote the ballad of Lenore, which was translated by Sir Walter Scott as William and Helen. When it leaves Greek lands the story changes, and a dead lover takes the place of the dead brother. The change is significant because the brother-sister relationship has always been morbidly emphasized in Greece - perhaps as a survival of some sort of exogamy; so that one might almost speak of the prevalence 8 Polites, no. 92, p. 155; Passow, 517; Gneftos, p. 99. (The only version which has the line about the horse falling in the mud.) 544</page><page sequence="7">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD in Greece of an Antigone complex. It is naturally the extra-Balkan version that is found among English ballads; a drowned sweetheart calling on horseback for his betrothed instead of a dead brother for his married sister; and it survives only in a late and feeble version known as The Suffolk Miracle.9 The rider complains of a headache and the girl lends him her handkerchief to tie up his head. Later on, when the rider has disappeared, after taking the horse round to the stables, his body is discovered in the churchyard: 26. Affrighted then they did behold His body turning into mould And though he had a month been dead This kerchief was about his head. Here in The Suffolk Miracle, as in the original Greek, the rider is the actual dead body, not an unsubstantial ghost; and of this story, whether it concerns a brother or a sweetheart, the editor of a version from Rhodes (P. Gneftos) rightly remarks that 'the dead rider does not act as a supernatural or exotic being but as an ordinary corpse behaving as if he were alive'. If we search the English ballad books we shall not easily find anything else like this galvanized corpse (which rather reminds us of a story by Edgar Allan Poe), and the nearest we shall come to a similar horror of deathliness will be in the immaterial ghosts of Fair Margaret or of Sweet William. FAIR MARGARET10 Fair Margaret sat at her bower window A combing of her hair She saw Sweet William and his bride Unto the church repair. When day was gone and night was come And all men fast asleep: Then came the spirit of Fair Margaret And stood at William's feet. 'God give you joy you two true lovers In bridebed fast asleep: I am going to my green grass grave And in my winding sheet.' This is the ordinary English ghost which goes through keyholes 1 Child, no. 272, p. 592. 10 Child, no. 74, p. I57; (B. 5, A. 5, 6). 2P 545</page><page sequence="8">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD - or without bothering about a keyhole diffuses through stone walls. Here is another SWEET WILLIAM'S GHOST11 There came a ghost to Margret's door With many a grievous groan: And ay he tirled at the pin But answer made she none. 'O sweet Margret, O dear Margret, I pray thee speak to me: Give me my faith and troth, Margret, As I gave it to thee. My bones are buried in yon churchyard Afar beyond the sea And it is but my spirit, Margret, That's now speaking to thee' ... No more the ghost to Margret said But with a grievous groan Evanished in a cloud of mist And left her all alone. 'Is there any room at your head, Willy Or any room at your feet? Is there any room at your side, Willy, Where fain fain would I sleep.' (This is like the Vergilian par levibus ventis volucrique simillima somno.) 5 There is another side-turning which must be looked into before we arrive at the World of the Dead properly so called. Different not only from the Dead Riders but also from the vaporous and plaintive ghosts of Fair Margaret and Sweet William are the corpses to whom as they lie patiently in their graves is attributed a conscious- ness, or at least an awareness of what is going on. One example of the corpse in the tomb regarded as having a conscious existence of its own is the well-known Greek ballad of The Kleft and his Tomb.12 11 Child, no. 77, p. 164; (A. I, 7, 9, 15; H. 12). 12 Polites, no. 43, p. 49; Passow, nos. 0o4 and 134. 546</page><page sequence="9">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD Carry me up to the Cold Spring Where the trees stand in a ring. Lay me on green branches: a tomb Build me there: let there be room For all my arms, and for this spear; Let there be a window near To let in the morning light, And the chill breath of the night; In and out the birds can fly: And pretty girls be passing by. This is a natural fancy to be found anywhere, from the Kleft ordering his tomb in the mountains of Janina to Browning's Bishop ordering his tomb in St Praxed's; it would be natural to regard it only as a literary conceit. But it should be noted that among simple people there is always a sort of residuary animism, or surviving pattern of a primitive animism, which suggests that even a corpse should have a life or at least an animation of its own, like any other material object, a chair, a table, or a coffin; and that a belief of this sort is intensified by the anthropomorphic temperament of the Greeks which expects even a dead man to behave like a man. Such a belief may have been both encouraged and expressed - first ex- pressed or symbolized and then encouraged in the expression - by two funerary practices. The first was the custom - the extent of which is obscure; but it was certainly prevalent in the Coptic Church - of using a model church as a gravestone.13 The second was the custom of burial above ground in a built-up tomb like a small cottage or chapel, or in a vault easily accessible and at least partly above ground, in which the coffin, or even the body without any coffin, was only laid on the floor on a shelf like a bunk. This 'chapel burial' may be found all over the Greek world, which I think of as all the lands bordering the Aegean and Adriatic seas, as it is in the Hellenistic romances of the first centuries after Christ. In the romance of Chariton Aphrodisiensis the heroine Kalliroe falls senseless when the hero Chaireas boxes her ears, and after the funeral she wakes up just as the doors of the tomb are opened by a landing party of pirates; they carry her off, and that is how she starts on her travels, pursued of course by the penitent 13 As often in Pontos in recent times. See Dawkins in Folklore, 53, Sept. 1942, p. 134. 547</page><page sequence="10">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD hero. In the Erotokritos and other Greek poems of the period the conventional phrase 'cobwebby doors' (of the grave) seems to imply the Chapel tomb; and this form of burial is necessary to the action of Romeo and Juliet, which in some ways still seems to move and to unfold in the atmosphere of the post-classical romances. 6 So here we are at last in the Lower World. Let us look round in the gloom and see what we can find out about it - first reminding ourselves, as every anthropologist knows, that it is very difficult to get from simple folk a true answer to the question 'What do you really believe?' As soon as an improvisation becomes too self- conscious it may be misleading; and single utterances must not be taken too seriously because the Dirges or Myrologia are often the work of professional mourning women who may be inclined to show off, or, like mediums and political orators, to give utterance to what is expected of them. I have little doubt that there is a great deal in common between the professional medium and the pro- fessional mourner. Both of them go into a trance, and their minds become a blank screen, on which are reflected the subconscious beliefs of the listeners. If this is so the professional dirge would still be valuable as a record of the secret beliefs or hopes of the as- sembled company. Even beyond this it would not be safe to as- sume wilful fantastication. Some of the scenes may be attempts to present, by means of poetical imagery, the mourner's deepest and most genuine feelings about the human situation. Let us begin with something quite simple. A bewildered impres- sion of cobwebby gates leading only to a darkness in which hollow sounds and indistinct forms make the new passenger, or guest, or prisoner seem to forget and to be already forgotten; a sort of empty resonance. Now they have locked you down, Daughter, in Forgetful Town: All who go in there receive Keys to go in, but not to leave: In and out, and first and last, They bolt up fierce and bolt up fast. There no mother speaks a word, And no daughter's voice is heard: 548</page><page sequence="11">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD There great and small Are level with us all: And all the houses there are dark And cobwebs hang from every wall.14 Another gives an idea of the bewilderment and ignorance of the dead; and ignorance soon leads to nothingness.15 Down in the darkness of the earth, Down in the World Below, The girls and boys are all in tears: Why are they weeping so? - They wonder if the sky's still there, The World Above, with churches painted gold, And looms, with shuttles going to and fro, To weave away the cold. It was a fair maid met me On the three steps of Hell; I thought, when she stood, She would ask me to tell, If I knew anything About her dear mother, Her father, her cousins, Her sister, or her brother. But she would only ask me If the sky is still there; And do they still get married in the Upper air ?16 Now you begin to feel the turn of the screw: Down in the dark you go, where no cock crows, No hens, no water there, and no grass grows: Nothing to drink, my daughter, or to eat, And when you want to rest Sleep is not sweet." The next to be quoted is one of the more elaborate pictures; and it has more in it than a mere excess of tears. One version of this song was found in Cappadocia, and has been discussed at some 14 Polites, no. 206, p. 240. 15 Passow, no. 368, p. 263. 16 Jeannaraki, Kretas Volkslieder, Leipzig, 1876; no. 145, P. 144. 1I Passow, 374, p. 265. 549</page><page sequence="12">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD length by Professor Dawkins, with special reference to Dante's description of an image standing in Crete - (the figure of a man made of gold, silver, brass and iron, with one foot of clay) - from which a stream of tears runs down to form the rivers and the lake of Hell.la The notion of the tears of the living pouring down upon the dead is old and widely diffused.19 Weep, eyes, and weep a stream to flow And flood into the World Below; Wet all that's dry, let thirsty drink; And clerks put water in their ink, To write how lovers' love is lost Who drink the river they have crossed; Drink and forget their homes above, Forget their lonely children's love.20 Here is a short valediction which is characteristically Greek in giving an unexpected and savage twist to the last couplet :21 O tell me, my true-love, how Death has received you. 'Clasped on my knees against my breast he lies: And when he is hungry he eats of my body; When he is thirsty drinks from my two eyes.' These are ceremonial lamentations over the dead, all more or less improvised. The next three poems are real ballads, at least in form; statements, with two or more speaking characters, of an emotional situation, introduced, presented and concluded. They are minia- ture mythological dramas. The first translation is in ballad form because the rhymes come easily, and there has been no sacrifice of the literal meaning. This is called The Fair Maid in Hell22 re- membering please that Hell does not here mean 'hell', as a place of 18 See Dante, Inferno, XIV, 105 ff; R. M.

O happy hills and fields death never know, In summer bright with sheep, in winter white with snow. Three knights in Hell's Mouth are minding to escape, In spring and in summer and when autumn fills the grape. A fair maid crosses her hands in prayer: 'Take me with you to the World up there.' 'We cannot take you and your gown flapping, And your cork-heeled shoes clapping, And with your flashing hair, my dear, We cannot take you, Death will hear.' 'I will put off my silk attire, My cork-heel'd shoes I will throw on the fire, And I will tie up my bright hair; Take me with you to the World up there, Let me see my mother, she must grieve and greet.' 'Your mother is talking in the street.' 'Let me see my father, he must grieve and pine.' 'He is in the tavern drinking his wine.' 'Let me see my brothers, they grieve and they groan.' 'They are in the playing fields, putting the stone.' 'Let me see my cousins; they grieve for me sore.' 'Your cousins are dancing on the dancing-floor.' Nothing need be said about this ballad now unless a note is wanted about the 'cork-heeled shoes' (fellokaliga), in which case reference may be made to the 'cork-heel'd shoon' of Sir Patrick Spens,23 and of Child Waters"4 - 'He's pitten on his corkheel'd shoon, An fast away rade he' - ; and to a letter in The Times of 16 June, i95o, from Mr G. N. L. Cooke of Lathbury Road, Ox- ford, pointing out that 'heels were first introduced in the sixteenth century as a rest for the stirrups of horsemen'. 23 Child, p. 104. 24 Child, p.

There is another reference to 'A pair of boots of cork' in the folksong 'The Keys of Canterbury'; and in Greek there is another reference in Passow, no. 526, to 'Golden corks on my feet' -which must refer to gilded heels; and see also one of the versions of Mary Hamilton - 'When she gaed up the Tolbooth stairs The corks from her heels did flee.' (Child, p. 664.) 551</page><page sequence="14">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD The next of this group of dramatic ballads about the Under- world need be introduced only to say how beautiful it is, almost like a classical Greek elegy reflecting the pagan world of antiquity.25 Sun going round the world, Sun shining clear, Last night I lost a girl, a daughter dear: Have you ever seen her, anywhere at all? - I saw her yesterday down in Death's hall. Death breaking bread, her heart withered with fears, Pouring his wine, and her eyes brimming tears. She poured, the cup fell from her hand as she poured; Not on the cobbles and not on the board, Into his lap it fell, and it broke; And Death displeasured turned and spoke: - What are you sighing for, my daughter, Your eyes running over like dark well water? Is it for your mother? Shall I bring her here? - Not for my mother. Do not bring her here. Is it for your brothers? Shall I bring them here? - And not for my brothers, do not bring them here. For my home up above is all my pain. - You will not see your home ever again. There is one more of these ballads, and here some parts of it fall easily into rhyme and the translator is in some danger of making it sound too romantic. The only complete version I know, here translated, was given to me by Mr Donald Swann of Christ Church, who had heard it sung by a twelve-year-old girl in Rhodes just after the War - though thirteen of the fourteen lines are in a Rhodian collection published in 1926.26 APPLE TREE CHAPEL TREE Little tree, apple tree, high on the wall, I'm longing for apples, and fearing a fall. 25 Polites, no. 221, p. 252. 28 P.

I went by the pathway; a chapel was near. There I saw forty graves, cousins and brothers; One little grave was away from the others; Alone in the dark, and I trod on the head; It groaned and it moaned and it sighed; and I said: Why do you sigh, tell me, why do you moan? Is the earth heavy on you, or the grave stone? - Why am I sighing, and why am I sad ? Wasn't I as young as you, my pretty lad ? Didn't I walk under the moonshiny sky? Now you tread on my head - Why do I sigh? This short ballad - only fourteen lines - has a moving quality which deserves a little analysis. The first three lines give you an idea that you are going to hear another of those love-songs address- ing young girls as appletrees or lemontrees, which is a little fresher to our ears but just as easy as calling them sugars or honeys or even ice-cream cones. Then when you go on to the scene of the hilltop chapel in the moonlight, you feel a slight misgiving --and on again to that tragic jab at the end, and you think naturally that the beginning of the appletree song has lost its continuation, if it ever had one - or perhaps it was just one of those distichs they throw about at dances, and some careless singer has joined it on to the body of a more serious adventure. And then you realize that the three parts of the song - the Appletree, the Chapel, and the Grave - are not joined together by accident, because the singer couldn't think of anything else. 7 Why of course the story begins with a boy looking longingly at the apples; with a young man looking longingly at a pretty girl and finding out that the only way to win her is by the roundabout path of roundabout courtship leading of course to the Chapel in the Waste. Yes but why is the little church on a lonely hill-top? Surely you know that a young man is never so lonely in his life as when he suddenly finds himself walking up to the altar with a strange young woman on his arm? And that is only the beginning. At the side of 553</page><page sequence="16">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD the Church there are 'Forty graves of cousins and of brothers' - once married he has thrown away the freedom of boyhood and finds himself caught in a network of family responsibilities, pulled this way and that way by living hands and by dead hands. And why 'One little grave away from all the others'? - It is his own grave, isn't it, and his own dead youth talking to him? For of course once married he has, biologically speaking, survived, or at least come as near survival as he will ever get; and accordingly once married he is as good as dead, and from the grave he sees and envies his own lost youth. It is the simplest possible piece of symbolic expression of a feel- ing about life; but please remember that any direct interpretation must inevitably distort it, because the proper and instinctive use of symbols is only to express something which cannot be expressed in ordinary words; and it is told with such beauty and economy, in concrete images, with every unnecessary detail worn away and polished by traditional repetition, that one begins to believe the saying that all art aspires to the condition of folk song. It has been composed by generations of singers with the greatest possible deliberation. If you look now at the other two ballads in this series you will find that each of them is carefully constructed with the same sort of dramatic progression; beginning with what seems to be a careless glance at hillside or sunshine, and then proceeding by increasing tension, more and more tying up of painful knots, until the last line falls like the knell at the end of the final chorus of an Aeschylean tragedy - EUopLS tLcSg EK&amp;CKc 'LITcLXW- or 7roiC KcLTaA-qE [O27 There is only one English ballad comparable to these in structure and effect and that is The Unquiet Grave.

Your salten tears they trickle down And wet my winding sheet.' 'Tis I my love sits on your grave And will not let you sleep: For I crave one kiss of your clay-cold lips And that is all I seek.' You crave one kiss of my clay-cold lips But my breath smells earthy strong: If you have one kiss of my clay-cold lips Your time will not be long. 'Tis down in yonder garden green Love, where we used to walk: The finest flower that ere was seen Is withered to a stalk. This is the English ballad that comes nearest to the Greek spirit of pagan acceptance. It resembles the Greek ballads quoted in having a clearly dramatic structure; an introduction, an intensifi- cation, and a conclusion. The introduction is a glance at the scene, a glance at the world we live in; in this case not the 'hillside bright with sheep' or the 'Sun going about the world', but 'a few small drops of rain' - a recognizably English backcloth. Then comes the tying of knots, in this case death and the separation of young lovers; and then comes the Aeschylean chorus, the acceptance of the inevitable, 'The finest flower that ere was seen Is withered to a stalk' ... The solemn acceptance of the inevitable - that is what I mean by 'paganism'. 555</page><page sequence="18">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD 8 Is there any conclusion to be drawn from this short daytrip to the infernal regions? What does it all amount to, assuming, as I think we may, that the pieces we have looked at are fair examples of popular expression? At the end of Erwin Rohde's Psyche, his long and learned 'ac- count of the opinions held by the (Ancient) Greeks about the life of the human soul after death', we come upon the following words: 'An immortality of the human soul as such, by virtue of its nature and composition - as the imperishable force of divinity in the mortal body - never became a real part of the belief of the Greek populace. When approximations to such a belief do occa- sionally find expression in popular modes of thought, it is because a fragment of theology or of the universally popular philosophy has penetrated to the lower strata of the uninstructed populace. Theo- logy and philosophy remained the sole repositories of the belief in the immortality of the soul.' 'If we pass in imagination', he says on the next page, 'through the long rows of streets in which the Greeks placed the memorials of their dead and read the inscriptions on the tombstones - they now form part of the accumulated treasures of Greek Epigraphy - the first thing that must arrest our attention is the complete silence maintained by the enormous majority of these inscriptions with regard to any hope - however formulated - or any expectation of a life of the soul after death.'29 What I now suggest is that exactly the same complete silence must arrest our attention if in imagination we turn the pages of the collected treasures of Greek folk song. If this suggestion were accepted - it would imply that the Christian Churches had never succeeded in making the slightest impression on popular belief. This implication would of course be flatly denied, and by no stratum of the population more indig- nantly than by those who still compose, sing and transmit the Greek folk song; and they could point to the churches crowded and adorned, to the magnificent Orthodox priesthood, and all the other evidences of unshakeable establishment. They could however hardly convince us that social acceptance of the practices of the 29 E. Rohde, Psyche, pp. 538, 539. 556</page><page sequence="19">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD church, even when combined with verbal acceptance of its teach- ings, have any connexion with fundamental beliefs. If you like to put it in an Ancient Greek way, which by the way is strictly scien- tific, you believe with your heart and your liver and not with your head. What you believe is unconsciously and faithfully reflected in the songs you have been composing and singing for three thousand years. The pagan character of these folk songs has, of course, been noticed before; but the tendency has been to look the other way, or to regard them as unimportant observations, rather as some Vic- torian divines used to regard the deviations of Athenian morality, or as some modern hellenists regard the savage mythology which hides behind the tapestry of the Attic dramatists. Professor Dawkins in the Frazer lecture already referred to, devotes several pages to a discussion of this dualism in both Ancient and Modern Greek belief. 'Here then is the contradiction', he says, 'in ancient Greece be- tween the Olympian religion of the Achaeans and the religion of the mysteries and Orphism... with its awful judges acquitting and condemning, rewarding and punishing; in modern Greece between what remains as essentially the old Religion as we see it among the warriors of Homer, and the eschatology of orthodox Christianity.'30 He goes on to quote Frazer on 'the innate capacity of the human mind to entertain contradictory beliefs at the same time'; and he concludes that it seems to be a matter of moods: 'the inconsistency, if we must use the word, lies not in any matter of belief, but in the possibility of entertaining and indulging more than one mood in the face of a great mystery.' It is not possible by a short quotation to do justice to Professor Dawkins' defence of the inconsistency of Greek religious beliefs; and his lecture should be read as a whole. What I suggest here is that of genuine beliefs there has never been any inconsistency; that in fundamental belief the Modern like the Ancient Greeks have always been pagans. 9 Some people may remember Thornton Wilder's play Our Town, which has more than once been broadcast in this country. By the use of a charade-like technique it gives a stereoscopic picture of a 30 Folklore, 53, Sept. 1942, P. 146. 557</page><page sequence="20">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD small puritanical law-abiding community, Grover's Corners in New Hampshire, (population 2,642 as the newspaper-editor is brought on to tell us), as seen in the lives of two neighbouring families, the doctor's and the newspaper-editor's, between 901o and 1913. The last act takes place in the cemetery on a hill outside the town. We find ourselves brought out once again by a round- about path to a chapel on top of a hill. On one side of the stage a funeral is taking place in the rain, and under a huddle of umbrellas a hymn is being sung. On the other side of the stage sit several rows of the patient dead, with an empty chair in the front row for the girl who is just being buried, the girl who was doing her school- work in the first act and being married in the second. The omnis- cient Stage Manager who has been directing this charade tries to explain their attitude. - 'Y'know, the dead don't stay interested in us living people for very long. Gradually, gradually they let go hold of the earth --and the ambitions they had --and the pleasures they had --and the things they suffered - and the people they loved. They get weaned away from earth - that's the way I put it, weaned away.... They're waitin'. .... Some of the things they're going to say maybe'll hurt your feelings - but that's the way it is: mother'n daughter --husband n'wife - enemy n'enemy - money n'miser - all these terribly important things kinda grow pale around here. And what's left? What's left when memory's gone, and your identity, Mrs. Smith?' - Isn't this very like the eleventh Odyssey, this picture of the bloodless mindless dead as imagined in a middle-class Christian community in New Hampshire - for it is obviously the author's intention to present the popular belief and not necessarily his own. Kinda Homeric, isn't it? And then one cannot help wondering if the abundant development of the higher religions in America, orgiastic or philosophical or theological, is as superficial as it seems to be, and always to have been, in Greece? One cannot help wondering if at a certain level of cultural or mental evolution a fundamental paganism is universal. Perhaps over a large part of the western world religion is a social observance rather than a belief either emotionally or intellectually apprehended. But this is a speculation which must be referred to the psychologists. 558</page><page sequence="21">SOME GREEK FOLK SONGS OF THE LOWER WORLD BOOKS REFERRED TO: J.
