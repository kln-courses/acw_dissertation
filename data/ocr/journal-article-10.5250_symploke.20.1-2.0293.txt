<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ENIGMA, SEMBLANCE, AND  NATURAL BEAUTY IN ADORNO’S  EPISTEMOLOGICAL AESTHETICS LORRAINE MARKOTIC “The poverty of the participants in Endgame is the poverty of philosophy.” —Theodor Adorno (1991b, 253) In this article, I argue that crucial to understanding Adorno’s Aesthetic  Theory (1997) is the philosophy he outlines in Negative Dialectics (1973).1  Negative Dialectics is less an actual negative dialectics, in my view, than a  call for such a philosophy—a call for which Aesthetic Theory may be seen as a  response.  Adorno’s theory of art emphasizes the inherent role of subjectivity  in the encounter with the enigmatic art object, and indicates the epistemo- logical importance of semblance (Schein).  Art promotes a model different  from that of a knowing subject who apprehends objects through concepts.  Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory invokes the possibility of a non-dominative, or  at least a less dominative, relationship between subject and object.  Adorno  pursues this through his original suggestion that art imitates natural beauty.  Natural beauty inherently involves a subjective encounter but simultaneously  insists upon the objective moment in such subjective experience.  Similarly,  art draws subject and object closer without allowing either to be confl ated  1When Aesthetic Theory was fi rst compared with Adorno’s other works, it was usually  linked with Dialectic of Enlightenment.  Albrecht Wellmer set the tone more than two decades  ago in “Truth, Semblance, Reconciliation: Adorno’s Aesthetic Redemption of Modernity”,  where he stated that Dialectic of Enlightenment remains a key text for understanding Adorno’s  Aesthetic Theory.  Rüdiger Bubner similarly states: “it has been often observed that the Dialectic  of Enlightenment holds the key to understanding Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory” (154).  Wellmer  reiterates his view in a more recent article where he writes: “...Dialectic of Enlightenment which,  after all, provides the original source of ideas for much of what Adorno has worked out in his  later works; even the scattered remarks on art to be found in this book contain, I would claim,  the basic material which Adorno has worked out in his late Aesthetic Theory” (“The Death of the  Sirens,” 6).

Adorno suggests that just as natural beauty is the model for  art, so aesthetics provides a model for philosophy. Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory advances an epistemology—one that is a logical  continuity to Negative Dialectics.  In Negative Dialectics, Adorno rejects any  positive dialectic and asserts that restlessness should characterize philosophy.  Thought should not come to rest, but should instead continually negate itself.  In Aesthetic Theory, Adorno makes clear that works of art are far too enigmatic  ever to let thought, or interpretation, come to rest.  The semblance quality of  art relentlessly impels thinking, and art’s enigmatic quality prevents thought  from settling.  This is especially the case with modern art.  Adorno’s aesthetics  suggests another way of knowing, one that engages in the negative dialectics  that Negative Dialectics demands.  The fi nal Aesthetic Theory was to be dedicated to Samuel Beckett; however,  for the most part I think the salience of Beckett’s work, not only for Adorno’s  aesthetics but also for his later philosophy in general, has been underesti- mated.  Throughout this article, in addition to discussing Negative Dialectics  and Aesthetic Theory, I shall address Adorno’s essay “Trying to Understand  Endgame.”  I consider this essay emblematic of Adorno’s aesthetic theory and  his philosophical project because in it Adorno both uses his aesthetic and  philosophical theory to illuminate Endgame and sees Endgame as expressing  his aesthetic and philosophical ideas.2 One In Negative Dialectics, Adorno criticizes Hegel for having betrayed  dialectical thinking by permitting it to come to rest and allowing an—always  premature—closure of system and world, concept and object.  Adorno chal- lenges the Hegelian notion of an affi rmative dialectic, the idea of achieving  something positive through the negation of a negation.  This is not to say  that idealist philosophy should resign, only that dialectics should as much as  possible avoid congealing, should continuously negate itself and its concep- tions.  Against Hegel’s “affi rmative” or “positive” dialectic that culminates  in absolute knowledge and the reconciliation of reason and society, Adorno  maintains: “It lies in the defi nition of negative dialectics that it will not  come to rest in itself, as if it were total.  This is its form of hope” (1973, 406).  Dialectics must be open-ended.  It is neither method nor reality.  Dialectics  is not a system or even an approach to the world; neither is it any contradic- tion inherent in objects—for discrepancy is a relation perceived by subjects.  Thought is propelled by a world that eludes conceptualization.  Thought  2Lambert Zuidervaart provides a detailed analysis of the importance of “Trying to  Understand Beckett’s Endgame” for Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory in Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory: The  Redemption of Illusion. </page> <page sequence="3"> symplokeˉ    295 should not come to rest, Adorno argues, for it would then betray all those  things whose present form betrays their own potential.   Throughout Negative Dialectics, Adorno attacks “identity theory” and  depicts Hegel as the archetypal “identity theorist” who presents an apparent— but actually false and extorted—reconciliation between subject and object.  The object is only encapsulated by the subject insofar as it is compressed into  a prescribed concept.  Adorno indicts the Hegelian concept for being coercive  and accuses Hegel of claiming to extract from the object that which is actually  already present in the subject.  In the preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit,  Hegel writes that scientifi c cognition “...demands surrender to the life of the  object, or, what amounts to the same thing, confronting and expressing its  inner necessity” (32).  Unfortunately, however, and despite Hegel’s assertions  to the contrary, the phenomena remain an instance of the concept.  Deference  towards the objects is token; the Hegelian artifi ce is erected upon an object  that is suppressed and prostrated.  Adorno insists that conceptual think- ing (and all philosophical thinking is in some way conceptual) is thwarted  by a brute otherness that ineluctably eludes it.  Although philosophy may  genuinely seek to grasp objects and phenomena, they will always somehow  escape understanding.  Ultimately, the concept can never capture the thing  conceived.  In Aesthetic Theory, Adorno similarly argues that the art object cannot be  captured by its conceptions.  He insists that each work of art is an enigma.  This is not to say that an artwork is vague and amorphous.  Art is enigmatic,  but according to Adorno, “every authentic work also suggests the solution to  its unsolvable enigma” (1997, 127).  Artworks are like riddles, and riddles call  for solutions—even if we never learn them.  By suggesting a solution to its  enigma, Adorno explains, art points to truth content (which is neither to be  equated with the intention of the artist nor with any kind of a message in the  work).  Artworks are elusive and enigmatic, but they indicate a truth—even if  this truth cannot be established.  “Ultimately, artworks are enigmatic in terms  not of their composition but of their truth content.  The indefatigably recur- ring question that every work incites in whoever traverses it—the ‘What is it  all about?’—becomes ‘Is it true?’” (127).  Art remains an enigma in the precise  sense of a riddle or puzzle—but one whose “solution is not objectively given”  (121).   Beckett’s Endgame is, without a doubt, a tremendous enigma.  In “Trying  to Understand Endgame,” Adorno writes: “Understanding it can mean only  understanding its unintelligibility, concretely reconstructing the meaning of  the fact that it has no meaning” (1991b, 243).  In relation to the chess game,  Adorno notes: “Whether the game ends in a stalemate or in an eternal check,  or whether Clov wins, is not made clear, as though too much certainty about  this would provide too much meaning” (270).  Yet this does not mean that  meaningless becomes the meaning of the play, Adorno insists.  The enigma that is  Endgame cannot be solved; the riddle of Endgame does not have an objectively  </page> <page sequence="4"> 2   9  6     Lorraine Markotic      Enigma, Semblance, and Natural Beauty determinable solution—and certainly not such a facile one.  At one point in  the play, Hamm demands that Clov open the window. HAMM: Open the window. CLOV: What for? HAMM: I want to hear the sea. CLOV: You wouldn’t hear it. HAMM: Then it’s not worthwhile opening it? CLOV: No HAMM (violently): Then open it.  (Clov gets up on the ladder, opens  the window.  Pause.)  Have you opened it? CLOV: Yes     [quoted in Adorno 1991b, 265] Adorno writes: “One is almost tempted to see in Hamm’s last ‘then’ the key  to the play....  The senselessness of an action becomes the reason for doing  it...” (265).  Here, however, Adorno does not state that one is tempted, but  only that one is almost tempted.  Because even this senselessness is not the  key, of course.  There is no key.  Just as objects elude their conceptual conscrip- tion, so Endgame eludes our attempt to ascertain its truth—which does not  mean we should not try to do so.  In Negative Dialectics, Adorno insists there cannot be a fi nal concurrence  of thought and reality, of subject and object, only an apparent and regrettable  confl ation of the latter into the former.  Indeed, he is so concerned to protect  the object from being ensnared and dominated by the subject that he feels he  must insist upon its preponderance [Vorrang].  He reminds us: Not even as an idea can we conceive a subject that is not an object;  but we can conceive an object that is not a subject.  To be an object is  also part of the meaning of subjectivity; but it is not equally part of  the meaning of objectivity to be a subject. (1973, 183)   Objects do not require subjects.  An art object, however, as art, requires a  subject.  This is crucial.  Art is something we apprehend.  With art we encoun- ter not simply the work but the fact that we perceive it.  In Aesthetic Theory,  Adorno emphasizes that art is distinguished from other objects through its  </page> <page sequence="5"> symplokeˉ    297 semblance (Bernstein 1997).3  The semblance quality of art makes it diffi cult  to depict a work of art without recognizing that one is articulating one’s own  experience of it.  With art, the subject is in a sense already present in the  aesthetic experience; or, rather, in the attempt to describe an art object, one  realizes that one is depicting a subjective experience: one is describing how  the artwork appears to oneself or how one experiences it.  An art object, I  would argue, cannot be said to have preponderance in the way other objects  do; we have diffi culty conceiving of a work of art without a subject.   In this manner, the experience of art is distinct from traditional philo- sophical inquiry; in philosophy one must fi rst refl ect in order to become aware  of one’s subjective presence in the apprehension of the object.  In Hegel’s  Phenomenology of Spirit, consciousness requires a lengthy process before it  eventually becomes self-consciousness.  But art, as semblance, more quickly  and clearly engages self-consciousness.  One does not need to “step-back”  from an art object in the same manner as one does in philosophy in order to  realize that one is not depicting the in-itself of an object when one describes  it.  In “Trying to Understand Endgame,” Adorno emphasizes the inherent  element of subjectivity in the encounter with the art object: “For unlike discur- sive knowledge of reality, something from which art is not distinguished by  degrees but categorically distinct, in art only what has been rendered subjec- tive, what is commensurable with subjectivity is valid” (1991b; my emphasis,  250).  In fact, a process of refl ection in art may be required in order to perceive  the work of art in a purely empirical manner, that is, merely as an object.  In Aesthetic Theory, Adorno reminds us that artworks, as such, as works of  art, require subjects who interpret them: “Artworks, especially those of the  highest dignity, await their interpretation.  The claim that there is nothing  to interpret in them, that they simply exist, would erase the demarcation  line between art and nonart” (1997, 128).  Art is beholden to our subjective  response to it.  Articulation of aesthetic experience and the art object is quite  different from traditional philosophy’s attempt to grasp objects and world.   Artworks are semblance, already illusion, and so they cannot be domin- ated in quite the same way that occurs when we illusorily think we are  describing natural objects or phenomena but are actually subsuming them  into our conceptual framework.  In Negative Dialectics, Adorno argues that  idealist philosophy uses objects as a mirror out of which to reread itself (1973,  13).  This does not mean that Adorno simply dispenses with idealism; he  writes: “Systems elaborate things; they interpret the world while the others  really keep protesting only that it can’t be done” (20).  Yet he wants us to be  aware that systems become ideology when they engulf things while claiming  3In “Why Rescue Semblance?  Metaphysical Experience and the Possibility of Ethics,” Jay  Bernstein connects Aesthetic Theory with the section “Meditations on Metaphysics” in Negative  Dialectics (where Adorno discusses the possibility of philosophy and of metaphysical experience  after Auschwitz).  Bernstein argues that Adorno’s aesthetics is based on the ethical possibilities  that semblance opens up through its attention to the sensuous particulars of modernist works.  Here I focus on the epistemological possibilities of Negative Dialectics and how they are opened  up by semblance.   </page> <page sequence="6"> 2   9  8     Lorraine Markotic      Enigma, Semblance, and Natural Beauty to be constructed around free-standing objects.  What is important to note  is that while the idealist claim to encompass the world is illusory as well  as being oppressive, art is already illusion.  Art is illusion that presents itself  as illusion and thus points beyond itself.  When we encounter art, we also  encounter our ability to experience it, albeit as social and historical beings  of course.  Art provides us with a mirror—but one that we can recognize  as such.  Negative Dialectics makes clear that a philosophy such as that of  Hegel (impressive though it is) erroneously thought it was, in its own way,  objectively depicting phenomena.  Aesthetic Theory maintains that this is not  possible. In the afterword to Aesthetic Theory, the editors discuss how Adorno  wrestled with the presentation of Aesthetic Theory.  Adorno felt that he had  to abandon any presentation in the traditional sense, in other words, any  “book’s almost ineluctable movement from antecedent to consequence”  (1997, 364) such as he had followed even in Negative Dialectics.  In a letter  about Aesthetic Theory, Adorno wrote: “The book must, so to speak, be written  in equally weighted, paratactical parts that are arranged around a midpoint  that they express through their constellation” (1997, 364).  Most important  in relation to parataxis is that, for Adorno, “philosophical parataxis seeks to  fulfi ll the promise of Hegel’s program of a pure contemplation [Zusehens] by  not distorting things through the violence of performing them subjectively,  but rather by bringing their muteness, their non-identity, to speech” (Editors’  Afterword, 364).  This goal of bringing the muteness, the non-identity of  things to speech was already present in Negative Dialectics, I would argue,  although it does take a new form in Adorno’s discussion of artworks char- acterized by semblance.  Artworks are non-identical, but they are not mute;  they call to us. Two In Negative Dialectics, Adorno censures philosophies of history that  anticipate social reconciliation.  Besides criticizing Hegel, Adorno specifi cally  attacks Lukács’ embracing of a transcendental totality.  Lukács sees working- class consciousness emerging and expanding out of its immersion in an  exceedingly reifi ed existence, grasping the social whole and understanding  its historical genesis.  For Lukács, the distorted and distorting whole breeds  a true totality where subject and object may be reconciled.  Adorno, to the  contrary, does not believe that history is graced with any totalizing subject  or that there can be a true totality where subject and object are reconciled.  With regard to works of art and their history, he holds a similar position.  Explaining this in relation to Beckett in Aesthetic Theory, he writes: “when  the last trace of the vagrant fi ddler disappears from the spiritual chamber  musician and the illusionless drama has lost the magic of the stage, art has  capitulated” (1997, 81).  Adorno does not believe that art is a totalizing or  </page> <page sequence="7"> symplokeˉ    299 self-contained whole.  Indeed, he thinks that there is a critique of totality  in great art, in terms of both form and content, and notes that totalitarians  such as Lukács hate in Beckett what they themselves have betrayed (1991b,  243).  Adorno insists that art should contain elements of anti-art rather than  eradicating that which is alien or other to it.  It is not, and should not be,  a seamless whole.  In “Trying to Understand Endgame,” he points out that  the name Clov can be understood as a truncation of the word “clown” and  Hamm can refer not only to Hamlet and his quest for meaning, but also to  a ham actor.  Works of art contain elements of that which is other to them.  Art is laced with mythical remnants, with residues of entertainment, with  reminders of animals, of natural beauty, and of clowns: If Beckett’s plays, as crepuscularly grey as after sunset and the end  of the world, want to exorcise circus colors, they yet remain true  to them in that the plays are indeed performed on stage and it is  well known how much their antiheros were inspired by clowns  and slapstick cinema.  Despite their austerity they in no way fully  renounce costumes and sets. (1997, 81) As grey and austere as Beckett’s plays are, there is a resonance of color and  lightness in a stage that has been set.  In other words, the form and the decor  of Beckett’s play continue to echo a past and an otherness that deny any  holistic conception of the bleakness that permeates them. In Negative Dialectics, Adorno argues that not only are objects too irre- ducible and many-sided to fi t into their concepts, but they are also part of a  socio-historical matrix and should not be understood in isolation.  They exist  within various, changing constellations and confi gurations.  This becomes  clearer when one considers Adorno’s concept of nature.  Adorno insists that  in every perception of nature, the whole of society is present.  Not only is  nature encountered through the social whole, but also the very idea of  “encountering” nature is itself already social.  The notion of nature as outside  of society, as a contrast to society, is a social one.  In Aesthetic Theory, Adorno  states: “The mistakenness of the crude antithesis of technique and nature is  obvious in the fact that precisely nature that has not been pacifi ed by human  cultivation, nature over which no human hand has passed—alpine moraines  and taluses—resembles those industrial mountains of debris from which the  socially lauded aesthetic need for nature fl ees” (1997, 68).  Nature is a societal  moment.   But at the same time, Adorno contends, nature cannot be fully reduced  to this moment.  Nature is always something more.  It resists society and  human understanding.  Within idealist philosophy, in the mind’s ordering  of objects and in the desire systematically to comprehend things, to render  the world knowable, Adorno perceives a tendency towards domination.  He argues that idealism embodies a rage (Wut) against all that is other, all  that is different, and all that cannot be easily subsumed.  Idealism attempts  to encompass, to envelop, and to order otherness.  According to Adorno,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 3   0  0     Lorraine Markotic      Enigma, Semblance, and Natural Beauty it expresses a rage towards all that refuses to be circumscribed by mind’s  comprehension: especially nature.  Cognitive capacities are fl agrantly defi ed  by the mute but enduring presence of matter.  Nature has a preponderant  and enduring otherness that society and history can never fully encompass.  Adorno manifestly repudiates Lukács’ suggestion that nature is a societal  category.  Adorno wants to retain the idea of an elusive “fi rst-nature” that the  very idea of “second nature” necessarily invokes.  In this way, then, Adorno  is ultimately more Kantian than Hegelian.  Adorno asserts that not only does  society mediate nature but nature also mediates society.  Whether in the form  of physical geography, climate, or our own bodies, nature also shapes us.  In  Negative Dialectics, Adorno insists that neither nature nor the socio-historical  world has ontological primacy; each should serve as a conceptual corrective  to the other.   He holds a similar position with regard to works of art.  Artworks are,  fi rst of all, socio-historical confi gurations and, second, they are always some- thing more.  Adorno notes that the formal problems within art refl ect social  contradictions, the dialectic of art refl ecting the social dialectic: “Artworks  are, a priori, socially culpable, and each one that deserves its name seeks to  expiate this guilt” (1997, 234).  As well, art needs to be understood in relation  to its particular history, in relation to the artistic tradition; even Beckett’s stark  work is depicted as containing “historically mediated impulses” (1991b, 243).  But, like nature, art is also something more than a socio-historical phenom- enon.  Art cannot be fully encompassed by a social whole that it nevertheless  eludes.  Simply put, art refl ects, but also resists, society.  This resistance is  crucial.  In Minima Moralia, Adorno goes so far as to write: “Perhaps a fi lm  that strictly and in all respects satisfi ed the code of the Hays Offi ce might turn  out a great work of art, but not in a world in which there is a Hays offi ce”  (1974, 191).4  In other words, art—in order to be art—must avoid coinciding  with the social whole.5   In “On Lyric Poetry and Society,” Adorno writes that the “greatness of  works of art” “consists solely in the fact that they give voice to what ideology  hides” (1991a, 39).  This does not mean, however, that art should attempt  to express a political message—or any message for that matter.  Works of  art must follow their own immanent logic, spurred on by the laws of form.  Adorno believes that art’s resistance, and indeed its opposition, lies not only  in its content but also in its form and, above all, in its inability to be contained.  In “Trying to Understand Endgame,” Adorno refers to contemporary society  as that of “virtually unmediated control” (1991b, 244).  Hence, contemporary  art is wary of harmony (not only because art must include opposing elements  within itself, as argued above) but because in harmony, which has been  4The Hays Offi ce censored fi lm productions from the 1920s to the 1960s in the U.S.  Not only  certain images, but certain narratives were permitted; others were not. 5Adorno is not naïve, however.  He notes that “art plays over into ideology in that, as the  image of what is beyond exchange, it suggests that not everything in the world is exchangeable”  (1997, 83). </page> <page sequence="9"> symplokeˉ    301 traditionally privileged in art, art now “senses acquiescence to the adminis- tered world” (1997, 158).  In Aesthetic Theory, Adorno writes:  Art, even as something tolerated in the administered world,  embodies what does not allow itself to be managed and what total  management suppresses.  Greece’s new tyrants knew why they  banned Beckett’s plays, in which there is not a single political word.   (1997, 234)  Along similar lines, contemporary art, including that of Beckett, is reluctant  to generate pleasure lest this become its very function and the social role it is  assigned.  Art should not and cannot be circumscribed.  Even artists should  be surprised by what they have created, Adorno believes.  Works of art must  contain aspects that were not anticipated.  They will always be more and  different than artists intend them to be.  Art breaks through, and often with,  its preconception; in fact, this may even be a criterion of its success.  Explicitly  political works, to the contrary, attempt to control art.  Not only do they foster  a naïve assumption about the coincidence of intention and reception, but they  also undermine art’s force and effi cacy.  Explicitly political works refl ect the  instrumental world by making art into an instrument.  Art needs to be autonomous in Adorno’s view.  It should relentlessly  strive for independence and innovation, should fi ght its domestication.  In “Trying to Understand Endgame,” Adorno discusses the importance of  Beckett’s dégoût.  He insists that in Beckett, dégoût is not forced but linked  to “the nausea of satiety, the taedium of the spirit” that “wants something  completely different” (1991b, 243).  Modern art strives to create that which is  different, which is unprecedented.  It specifi cally seeks not to conform.  And  it will go to great lengths in order to do so.  Adorno analyzes how modernism  defi nes itself against the tradition, how it insists upon its break with what  went before.  Modernism does not “negate previous artistic practices, as  styles have done throughout the ages, but tradition itself” (1997, 21).  As a  result, modernism is repeatedly confronted with the clichéd critique that it  has “gone too far.”  For Adorno, however, art is to be spurned only where  it begins to waver and “does not go far enough” (34).  Art must be original  if, at present, it is to be art at all.  Modernism is novel and novelty has in  fact become a central concern for it.  Of course, Adorno recognizes both that  “nouveauté is aesthetically the result of historical development” (21) and that  modern art risks appearing faddish; it risks hypostatizing the “new” and  thus embodying the socio-economic category of “newness.”  Nevertheless,  for Adorno, art must seek to present something unprecedented; originality  and autonomy remain crucial aspects of art.  In this way, art resists—even as  it refl ects—the socio-historical world.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 3   0  2     Lorraine Markotic      Enigma, Semblance, and Natural Beauty Three Art suggests the future reconciliation of subject and object, history and  nature.  But art is not reconciliation; it invokes the hope or possibility of such  reconciliation.  In “Trying to Understand Endgame,” Adorno writes: “Art can  conceive reconciliation, which is its idea, only as the reconciliation of what  has been estranged.  Were it to simulate the state of reconciliation by joining  the world of mere objects, it would negate itself” (1991b, 250).  Hence, Adorno  goes on to assert that social realism cannot be art, for an “unreconciled reality  tolerates no reconciliation with the object in art” (250).  In Aesthetic Theory,  he explains: “For the sake of reconciliation, authentic works must blot out  every trace of reconciliation in memory” (1997, 234).  Art should not present  reconciliation, only indicate its hope, which is what occurs when it imitates  natural beauty. To summarize what I have argued so far: Adorno insists that our encoun- ter with nature is always mediated, but at the same time nature is a moment  outside society and history.  Nature ultimately resists appropriation, silently  refutes our concepts and our thinking.  Adorno’s account of nature is not just  central to Negative Dialectics, but to his philosophy as a whole; indeed, his  concept of nature as a moment enduringly independent of society is probably  what most distinguishes him from someone such as Habermas.  One might  expect, therefore, that Adorno would portray art—in its insistent auton- omy—as comparable to the moment of nature in his own philosophy.  For as  noted, Adorno argues that art objects, too, are independent; they cannot be  understood in terms of the intention of their creator, but have their own inner  logic.  While they are social and historical products, they are also always  something more.  Adorno insists that works of art must be autonomous—of  both the artistic tradition and a controlling social world.  In a world with a  Hays offi ce, to use Adorno’s example, a work of art—in order to be a work of  art—cannot conform to its strictures.  In light of Adorno’s insistence, therefore, that the concepts of both nature  and art contain an independent moment, one might expect him to make an  analogy between nature and art.  But Adorno does not state that art imitates  nature; rather, he insists that it imitates natural beauty.  This is exceedingly  important.  Art imitates natural beauty insofar as it evokes a moment where  subject and object are reconciled6 where neither has preeminence.  While  Negative Dialectics argues for the integrity of an object protected from human  renderings, and while in that book Adorno attempts to keep subject and  object apart, and philosophy from confl ating one into the other, Aesthetic  6It must be remembered that nature itself is not reconciled, and that the reconciliation of  natural beauty is a hope for the future.  Adorno writes: “Natural beauty remains the allegory  of this beyond [bourgeois society, its labor, and its commodities] in spite of its mediation  through social immanence.  If, however, this allegory were substituted as the achieved state of  reconciliation, it would be degraded as an aid for cloaking and legitimating the unreconciled  world as one in which—as the claim goes—beauty is indeed possible” (1997, 69). </page> <page sequence="11"> symplokeˉ    303 Theory attends to the interdependence between subject and object.  Such a  moment of interdependence is to be found in the experience of natural beauty.  Without humans, natural beauty cannot exist—and yet it is not solely a human  creation.  Natural beauty involves both subjective apprehension and indicates  an objective moment in subjective experience.  Adorno states that “natural  beauty points to the primacy of the object in subjective experience” (1997,  71).  Without saying that Adorno is optimistic in Aesthetic Theory, I think one  could say that therein the pessimism of Negative Dialectics (and of Dialectic  of Enlightenment) lifts.7  Objects elude, resist, and seem to mock philosophy;  natural beauty inspires, impels, and is a promissory model for aesthetics. It also may be somewhat surprising that Adorno here valorizes natural  beauty, since he is otherwise exceedingly critical of conceptions of “the beauti- ful.”  In Adorno’s view, the traditionally beautiful in art is reassuring and  consoling; it tends to obscure all that is unattractive. Hence, it betrays art’s  truth content.  With the ugly, to the contrary, art is able to “denounce the  world that creates and reproduces the ugly in its own image” (48-9).  In a  world that would circumscribe beauty as if it had not betrayed it long ago,  Adorno reasons, art must boycott beauty.  Artworks are often fi lled with  blackness, he notes, with an absence of color; in this way, they arraign a dark  and monochromatic world.  Furthermore, he states: “Art indicts superfl u- ous poverty by voluntarily undergoing its own” (40).  But art cannot ban  all moments of beauty even as it attempts not to be beautiful.  As remarked  earlier, artworks are discordant and disjunctive.  Artworks will not cease to  entail that which is opposite and other.  Indeed, Adorno even contends that  “by its very concept, art implies kitsch” (119).  Much more important is that  by its very concept, art implies natural beauty. For although there may be no more than a whiff of natural beauty in  Endgame, natural beauty nevertheless can be said to provide a model for our  encounter with this play.  The semblance quality of art, the fact that there  is a subjective, interpretive element to art, is underlined in Endgame.  That  art objects are distinct from other objects is something to which the work  draws our attention.  Endgame demands interpretation, even as it eludes it.  The enigmatic play seems to be saying something—indubitably to have truth  content—but what it is saying cannot readily be grasped.  Endgame is an  emblematic work for Adorno, because the play compels us to try to fi gure out  what it means even as it forces us to realize that it is diffi cult, if not impossible  to do so.  Were Endgame less of a riddle, were there at least an apparent mean- ing (existentialist ideas8) or a deliberate meaninglessness (such as is found  in Dada art), we might forget the subjective aspect of our encounter with  7Adorno begins the Introduction to Negative Dialectics with the following sentence:  “Philosophy, which once seemed obsolete, lives on because the moment to realize it was missed”  (1973, 3). 8 Existentialist interpretations of the play were prevalent at the time Adorno wrote his es- say (See Brunkhorst 1999, 139), but Adorno believes that not only does the play avoid existential  categories, it shatters them: “Existentialism itself is parodied; nothing remains of its invariant  categories but bare existence” (1991b, 243).  As well, he considers the following exchange to  </page> <page sequence="12"> 3   0  4     Lorraine Markotic      Enigma, Semblance, and Natural Beauty the enigmatic art object.  With Endgame, however, this is diffi cult to do.  Early  in his essay, Adorno writes: “Thought becomes both a means to produce  meaning in the work, a meaning which cannot be rendered directly in  tangible form, and a means to express the absence of meaning” (1991b, 242).  Interpretation denies the preeminence of the object and evokes the subjective  presence in aesthetic experience.  At the same time, thwarted understand- ings—and Endgame truly thwarts our attempts to understand it even as  Adorno’s essay notes the importance of trying to do so—remind us of the  presence of the object in subjective experience.  Art, especially a modern work  of art such as that of Beckett, does not provide reconciliation between subject  and object, yet powerfully evokes reconciliation, as does natural beauty. Salient here is that natural beauty is the model for art.  Adorno does not  state that art is the same as—or even that art is like—natural beauty.  Rather,  art imitates it—and not in the anthropomorphic attempt to control or infl uence  (such as is the case with the notion of mimesis in Dialectic of Enlightenment).  What art imitates is the reconciliatory, non-dominative moment found in  natural beauty.  Moments of natural beauty are a sudden emergence, vanish- ing as soon as we try to verbalize them.  Art suggests the transience evoked  by the experience of natural beauty.  If we attempt to articulate natural  beauty, its fl eetingness inevitably escapes us, and we end up describing  nature, and so are back once again subsuming (natural) objects into our  concepts: we invariably return to the domination of the object condemned in  Negative Dialectics.  Natural beauty is a non-discursive moment destined to  remain non-discursive (1997, 72).  If we attempt to express natural beauty, we  reinstate the opposition between subject and object that unarticulated natural  beauty works to mend.   Art, however, needs to be articulated.  In Adorno’s words, “in art the  evanescent is objectifi ed;” indeed, “it is to this extent that art is concept,  though not like a concept in discursive logic” (73).  Because art is conceptual,  aesthetic experience must be interpreted and expressed.  Adorno asserts:  “Aesthetic experience is not genuine experience unless it becomes philoso- phy” (131).  He states that the object of aesthetics “is determined negatively  as indeterminable.  It is for this reason that art requires philosophy, which  interprets it in order to say what it is unable to say, whereas art is only able  to say it by not saying it” (72).  Natural beauty should be expressed at most,  be mocking the idea of ontological fi rst principles.  (Note that there is no question mark after  Hamm’s question.) HAMM: Do you remember your father. CLOV (wearily): Same answer.  (Pause).  You’ve asked me these questions  millions of times. HAMM: I love the old questions.  (With fervor.)  Ah, the old questions, the  old answers, there’s nothing like them. [quoted in 1991b, 244] </page> <page sequence="13"> symplokeˉ    305 according to Adorno, with a sudden intake of breath.  Art, to the contrary,  needs to be voiced.  For art is something we must try to fi gure out.  Modern art is  often considered to have “nothing to say” because—like Beckett’s works—it  is not easily decipherable.  But it is up to us to do the deciphering.  No matter  how complex, abstract, or enigmatic they are, works of art should not simply  be considered elusive.  Whereas we may gasp in awe before natural beauty,  art should be vocalized.  It is in describing an artwork that we are confronted  with ourselves being confronted with something beyond ourselves, and so  we invariably refer to both subject and object, unable to keep them apart.  In  remaining aware that we are engaging in interpretation and yet at the same  time seeking a truth content in the work itself (not simply seeing it as indefi n- able), we imply reconciliation.  Of course, the last thing that Endgame may  seem to do is to suggest a reconciliation between subject and object.  But  Adorno believes it does exactly this.  Endgame demands an interpretation,  and thus insists that our interpretation is integral to the play—that it cannot  exist as a work of art without it.  At the same time Endgame patently eludes  our interpretations, and thus reminds us that there is always more to the  work than our interpretation.   Conclusion Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory implies that just as natural beauty is the model  for art, so aesthetics provides a model for philosophy.  Aesthetic Theory was  not a fi nished work, so perhaps this view would eventually have been made  more explicit, but I think it is already evident in the text we have.  Adorno’s  aesthetics presents a model different from that of a knowing subject who  apprehends objects through concepts.  Art calls for an interpreting subject  engaging with an inherently enigmatic artwork.  Adorno insists that art is an  enigma or a riddle both to prevent us from considering art merely subjectively  meaningful and also to prevent us from considering it an objective (social)  form that does not require interpretative engagement—in other words, to  prevent us from reducing the object to the subject or the subject to the object.  Art is semblance; it is illusion that encourages us to dispense with our illu- sions—especially our philosophical illusions.  In Negative Dialectics, Adorno  seeks to guard the object from the conceptual domination of the subject and  to show that the subject is only ever under the illusion of fully grasping an  object that ultimately evades it.  In Aesthetic Theory, he shows that because of  the semblance element in works of art, the object requires a subject, but that  this subject cannot as easily dominate it—especially in the case of modern  art.9  In other words, although Adorno’s interpretation of Endgame may be  9Bernstein states: “Adorno’s contention is that aesthetic semblance rides adrift of, and calls  into question, our most sophisticated elaborations of the logical, epistemic, and causal modali- ties” (“Why Rescue Semblance,” 194). </page> <page sequence="14"> 3   0  6     Lorraine Markotic      Enigma, Semblance, and Natural Beauty compelling, it still remains an interpretation; it is what he elicits from the  play.  After reading Adorno’s interpretation in “Trying to Understand  Endgame,” we may remain unconvinced, or we may decide that we prefer  Matisse or Brecht to Beckett.  Nevertheless, whenever we engage with works  as enigmas, attempt to solve the riddle that constitutes a painting by Matisse  or a play by Brecht, we invariable invoke the possibility of a reconciliation  between subject and object.  Thus, we cannot but invoke a non-dominative  or at least a less dominative relationship between them, one that does not  suppress or subsume their otherness. Adorno’s aesthetics suggests an alternative epistemology.  Moreover,  it indicates that philosophy should be more modest in its claim to know  objects.  Not only will individuals, but so too will history and society always  be able to unsettle what we know of works of art; for example, the Shoah,  which occurred after Kafka wrote, can lead to new interpretations of his writ- ings, just as a post-colonial society might lead to new interpretations of Jane  Austin (Said 1994).  A genuine work of art does not congeal.  Interpretations  are continually negated; they do not come to rest.  The semblance quality  of art allows for this, and art’s enigmatic nature insists upon it.  Adorno’s  aesthetics provides the negative dialectics for which Negative Dialectics calls.  Aesthetic Theory suggests that in order for philosophy to avoid the domi- nation of the object criticized in Negative Dialectics, it should approach objects  and nature in the way that his aesthetics charges us to approach works of  art: aware of both the inherently subjective dimension of the encounter and  the incessantly enigmatic nature of an object that nevertheless provokes us  to try to resolve its unsolvable enigma.  Art objects, as semblance, engage  consciousness even as their enigmatic quality eludes it; simultaneously, as  enigmas, they remind consciousness and subjectivity that they are being  engaged.  Aesthetic Theory insists upon such an epistemology.  Subject and  object draw closer without being confl ated into one other.  For Adorno, this  is art’s accomplishment, and this is all—and everything—that philosophy  should attempt to do.
