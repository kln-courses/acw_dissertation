<plain_text><page sequence="1">231 EVOLUTION AND HOWELLSIAN REALISM IN THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY Jane Marston Vanderbilt University W. D. Howells's fiction, no less than his criticism, reflects his interest in the science of his day, particularly in theories of evolution. Harry H. Clark has docu mented this interest by citing the numerous allusions to science in Howells's prose, both fiction and nonfiction. * More recently, Donald Pizer has shown a connection o between nineteenth-century science and Howells's thoughts on realism in literature. But no critic has considered in detail just how this interest in science might have af fected the practice rather than the theory of Howells's realism, though Edwin Cady attributes the absence of "violent" sexuality in the novels to Howells's belief that lustful passion is atavistic.3 One may turn to THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY (1880) for demonstration of how Howells's interest in evolution first found significant ex pression in his fiction. In THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY Howells introduces serious themes through the dramatic interaction of psychologically complex characters. Although the characters never become purely symbolic, Howells places them within a coherent symbolic frame work which makes the novel structurally complex. The character Boynton, whose tra ditional religious faith has been destroyed by science, almost ruins the life of his daughter Egeria by trying to prove that she has psychic powers. He forces her to live out of harmony with natural processes. Through the operation of chance and the efforts of Ford, her suitor, Egeria is brought back into harmony with nature and society. Ideas about faith, free will, and the spiritual and moral life, presented realistically and con cretely at the level of character, as well as the plot-device of the accidental event, derive from Howells's thinking about evolution. Evolution therefore provided Howells with much of the material for his first major novel; the novel in fact assumes impor tance because of Howells's use of his knowledge of evolution. Matters of theme, structure, and characterization which are central to THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY remained of interest to Howells throughout his career. Howells's response to evolution was generally ambivalent. He adhered to faith in evolutionary progress even while he decried the challenge to traditional religion inherent in the new science. Like his friend John Fiske, he sought the reconciliation</page><page sequence="2">232 of Christianity with evolution, and he eventually achieved this reconciliation by seeing evolution as a proof of providential design in the universe. For example, he wrote in HAR PER'S MONTHLY (March 1912) that "something supreme ordains the survival of the fittest in literature, infiction, as in everything else. "4 Herejected "hard" evolution, which lo cated man in an amoral and biologically determined world, and embraced "soft" evolution, which optimistically posited change as progress, as part of man's growth toward moral perfection. The shadow cast by hard evolution challenged Howells's optimism enough for him to have felt a spiritual anxiety that Fiske eventually relieved. In 19 20, he com mented that Fiske had '"evolved from the agnosticism of the whole contemporary think ing world a deistic belief, and established our civilization in the comfort of a credence unknown outside of his following." Earlier in Howells's career, the light of soft evolution had illuminated the Reverend Sewell's sermon in THE MINISTER'S CHARGE to help define Howells's doctrine of complicity: "The gospel?Christ?God, so far as men had imagined him,?was but a lesson, a type, a witness from everlasting to ever lasting of the spiritual unity of man. As we grew in grace, in humanity, in civiliza tion, our recognition of this truth would be transfigured from a duty to a privilege, a joy, a heavenly rapture. "6 To grow in civilization as well as in humanity and grace is to reach an ideal condition of being, acquired through evolutionary progress, in which man's capacity to perceive God's purposes reaches full maturity. The tension between hard and soft evolution helps mold the character of Boynton in THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. Howells posits Boynton's psychical experiments as a false solution to the problem of loss of faith, and he identifies evolution as a major cause of that problem. Boynton emphasizes to Ford that the '"question whether we came from the Clam or the Ancient of Days, whether we shall live forever, or rot forever, remains'" (p. 288). But, if evolution poses a threat to traditional religious faith, it also lets Boynton regard the spiritual decadence of his own age as merely a phase of transition from old, inadequate ways of understanding the supernatural to new, better ones. He explains to a Mr. Phillips why he has chosen a residence among '"fortune tellers and charlatans'" in a neighborhood in transition from suburban respect ability to urban tackiness: '" . . .1 could not in candor, deny to these pretenders themselves a beneficial, a highly--I may call it?evolutionary, influence upon my daughter. . . . [T]hey are of the old tradition of supernaturalism,?a tradition as old as nature,--and we cannot afford to reject the favor of the tradition which they repre sent'" (p. 7). He elsewhere refers to his unwillingness to pass judgment "'upon a certain order of phenomena in their present stage of development'" (p. 12) and insists that the "'hopes of the race"' depend on his experiments (p. 54). Boynton tries to maintain a poise between pessimism and optimism, acknowledging, like Howells him self, the crisis of loss of faith while formulating solutions which reflect belief in the evolutionary advancement of civilization. But Boynton's idealism becomes a veil which blinds him to the actualities of human life. He errs by trying to bring psychic phenomena within the province of the empirical world. The subject of the psychic life also derives from Howells's thinking about evolu tion. His relationship with Fiske supplies the connection. It does not require the mediation of Fiske to show that Howells, in creating in Dr. Boynton a figure desperate for spiritual certainty, was recording the anxiety of his age in matters of the spirit, or that, in creating Ford, the sceptic, writer, and scientist, he was objectifying the part of himself,that respected the sanity of a rational, empirical approach to experi ence. 8 However, it is germane to an understanding o? Howells's art and intentions</page><page sequence="3">233 in THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY to point out the affinities between the novel and Fiske's "The Unseen World." What Fiske treats in expository fashion, Howells treats dramatically; and Howells as narrator retains an ironic stance, refusing to resolve the issues debated by his characters.^ "The Unseen World" came under the editorial eye of William Dean Howells be fore it appeared in the ATLANTIC MONTHLY for 1876; the essay was, in fact, an out growth of conversations between Fiske and Howells on the subject of the new science. It appeared about the same time that Howells wrote and published "A Shaker Village" in the ATLANTIC MONTHLY, the account of his own stay among the Shakers which is the germ of THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. Fiske's thoughts on proofs of psychic reality and Howells's on the question of the spiritual and moral life coincided in singu larly concrete fashion, quite possibly undergoing a synthesis in Howells's mind which took the form of his first major novel. Fiske intends, not to argue that a future life exists, but to establish the lines of philosophical inquiry about such a life. He argues that the existence of an unseen world cannot be disproved just because empirical data are absent, for our lack of know ledge of certain modes of experience or dimensions of reality can prove only that we do not know them, not that they do not exist. He would have agreed with Howells's character Ford that there is no hope for faith '"in the philosophy that applies the theo ries of science to the moral world'" (p. 365). The matter of empirical proofs also con cerns Boynton greatly, for to him the advantage of spiritualism is precisely that it of fers material proofs of psychic reality. By the end of the novel, Boynton has rejected the validity of his researches, using phrases which echo Fiske's thoughts on the value of seeking such proofs. Fiske condemns the "gross materialistic notions of ghosts and bogies, and spirits that upset tables and whisper to ignorant, vulgar women the wonderful information that you once had an aunt Susan. The unseen world ... is not connected with the present material universe by any such 'invisible bonds' as would allow Bacon and Addison to come to Boston, and write the silliest twaddle in the most ungrammatical English before a roomful of people who have never learned how to test what they are pleased to call 'the evidence of their senses'" (p. 272). This description creates the same impression of sham evident in the seance at Mrs. Le Roy's. Boynton finally places his own endeavors within this category of fakery when he, like Fiske, discusses the evidence of the senses and "gross materialism": "'Has it never struck you,'" he asks Ford, "'as very extraordinary that all the vast mass of evidence which has been accumulating in favor of spiritualism . . . should have no convincing power whatever with those who have not been convinced by their own senses?'" (p. 366). He comes to view spiritualism as '"materialism,?a grosser materialism than that which denies; a materialism that asserts and affirms, and appeals for proof to purely physical phenomena'" (pp. 366-367). Various details of THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY call into question the actual reliability of the senses. One such detail is the description of the swans which Ford watches in the park; ". . , [they] lay still on the still water, with their white reflec tions under them as distinct and substantial to the eye as their own bulk" (p. 39); ob ject and reflection seem equally substantial. Another is the description of the red squirrel which blends perfectly with pine needles in the woods: "A red squirrel took shape and motion out of the russet needles, and raced up one of the pines, whose leathery tops he bent Ln his long leaps from tree to tree; a partridge suddenly whirred</page><page sequence="4">234 up from the path before them; the life was like shadow, the shadow was like life, as the twilight thickened round them" (pp. 328-329). Howells again stresses the tenta tiveness of sense-perceptions. Images of shadow and twiliqht occur elsewhere in the novel to suggest the elu siveness of self-knowledge and knowledge of the unseen world. Boynton uses the image of the shadow to describe his own self-delusion, produced by misdirected idealism: "'Light shone on me from one side, and I cast a shadow in this direction; light shone on me from the other side, and I cast a shadow in that direction. My mistake was to fancy at both times that the shadow was I'" (pp. 288-289). The image of twilight ap pears at the end of the novel to help create an open-ended resolution: They who keep [Boynton's] memory think compassionately of his illusions, if they are illusions, but they shrink with one impulse from the dusky twi light through which he hoped to surprise immortality, and Ford feels it a sacred charge to keep Egeria's life in the full sunshine of our common day. If Boynton has found the undiscovered country, he has sent no message back to them, and they do not question his silence. They wait, and we must all wait. (p. 419) Egeria, at the end of the novel, loses her mythic quality (Howells has compared her to Ceres), and Ford has the dubious honor of inventing the Ford Fire Kindler. Such reductiveness is appropriate because Howells has tried all along to show the value of a normal, untheatrical life within the human community. But the shadowy twilight region beyond that community affirms an element of mystery in nature. Howells's willingness to leave his characters and his readers involved in the process of waiting provides implicit endorsement of Fiske, who concludes that "under the conditions of the present life" evidence for proving an unseen world must remain "forever inaccessible" (p. 275). Fiske's essay, considered along with THE UNDIS COVERED COUNTRY, helps make one particularly aware of epistemological problems treated in the novel. Perhaps it is enough to say that Howells wants to expose Boyn ton's experiments as so much nonsense and that he accomplishes his purpose by say ing, in effect, that objects and events are not always what they seem. But Howells seems tempted by the idea that the full truth about objects and events cannot be as certained, even when men keep to their own proper realm of experience. Other observations made by Fiske can serve as a gloss on the values Howells endorses in the novel. Boynton describes his '"hypothesis of a second life, in which the objects of this shall remain dear to us'"; he thus sees the visible and invisible worlds as part of one '"continuity of endeavor'" (p. 289). He thereby verifies Fiske's conclusion that "one does not easily realize that a heavenly existence could be worth the longing that is felt for it, if it were to afford no further scope for the pure and ten der household affections which give to the present life its powerful though indefinable charm" (pp. 273-274). Boynton loses sight of the tender household affections, Egeria regains them after her illness, and Boynton comes to cherish them again after his ac cident. Fiske analyzes human conceptions of the afterlife; Howells uses a particular character's conception to convey the spiritual value of the "commonplace" life. Par allels between "The Unseen World" and THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY indicate just how deeply Howells's conception of the novel was grounded in his thinking about evo lution and the questions about knowledge and immortality that it generated.</page><page sequence="5">235 Furthermore, Boynton's remarks on the '"continuity"' of human endeavor develop a version, based in evolution, of Howells's doctrine of complicity. The following views anticipate the idea of the spiritual unity of man previously quoted from THE MIN ISTER'S CHARGE: Ford evaded the issue as to the identity of their opinions. He admitted that faith in a second life might nerve a man to greater enterprises here; and that one might not so often flag in the pursuit of truth if the horizon did not shut down so close all round. But he said that we had the comfort of knowing that the work of each was delegated to the whole race, and that whoever failed his work could not fail. "Ah, don't delude yourself!" cried Boynton. "There is no comfort in that. What is the race to you or me ? You are the race; I am the race; and no one else of all the myriad atoms of humanity could take up our work and keep it the same work. " "You said, just now, " said Ford, with a smile, "that you and I were the same." "I was wrong, " promptly admitted Boynton. "We are not the same, and could not be, to all eternity. But if you accept the hypothesis of a second life, in which the objects of this shall remain dear to us, you establish an infrangible, a perpetual, continuity of endeavor. The man with whom a great idea has its inception becomes a disembodied spirit. By influx from the spi rit world to which he goes, he becomes the partner of the man to whom his work falls here; and that man dying enlarges the partnership in his turn, and so on ad infinitum. It must be in this way that civilization is advanced, that the world-reforms are accomplished." (pp. 289-290) The advancement of civilization, an evolutionary concept, thus is linked to the moral actions of individuals. The moral value of the "work" alluded to is precisely that it is part of the continuity of endeavor. Howells transposes the biological principle of organic interrelationship from a material to a spiritual and moral plane. The importance of individual moral choice is another subject which can be exam ined in light of Fiske's essay. Fiske, like Ford in the conversation just quoted, is aware of the feeling of futility that can result from spiritual uncertainty. Fiske men tions the "craving, almost universally felt, for some teleological solution to the prob lem of existence. Why we are here now, " he observes, "is a question of even pro founder interest than whether we are to live hereafter" (p. 277). However, he goes on to say that the problem of general human existence overshadows the "self-regard ing" one of mere individual immortality: "Could we but know that our present lives are working together toward some good end, even an end in no wise anthropomorphic, it would be of less consequence whether we were individually to endure. To the dog under the knife of the experimenter, the world is a world of pure evil; yet could the poor beast but understand the alleviation of human suffering to which he is contribut ing, he would be forced to own that this is not quite true . . . " (p. 278). Boynton's comment to Ford about the uniqueness of the individual supplies an alternative to Fiske's concern with corporate well-being. It therefore invites one to ask how Howells might have accommodated his own belief in racial progress to his views on moral free dom and on evil. When he has Dr. Boynton recognize the merits of individual action, Howells</page><page sequence="6">236 implicitly rejects the tendency of the hard evolutionists to regard human action within a deterministic framework. In 1902 he was to comment on the assimilation of "wrong" into Nature in terms which reconcile moral freedom with the inevitability of evolution ary change: '"In the moral world as in the material world, Nature takes care of the wrong done: she softly covers it up, transmutes it, turns it even to use and beauty, not for the doer indeed, and usually not for the victim, but for the race. ' "H For Howells, the fact that man is part of a process occurring in nature need not, indeed must not, obscure the necessity for willed action. General human progress exists only as an adjunct to individual moral choice. Willed action must precede nature's transmutation, though here, as in Fiske, emphasis is on "the race." These ideas emerge through both characterization and structure in THE UNDIS COVERED COUNTRY. Howells makes free will a prominent feature of his depictions of Boynton and Ford. Boynton initially expresses faith in a process of events occurring independent of choice. He at first sees Ford as merely a psychic obstacle to the suc cess of his experiments: '"He is a blind, opposing force of nature,'" says Boynton, '"which is simply to be overcome; he can no more have insulted or wronged me than the rock against which I strike in the dark . . .'" (p. 66). He also refers to a '"law of progression through the antagonism of opposites'"?a Hegelian premise which How ells implicitly rejects, at least as Boynton formulates it (p. 89). Boynton further sub jugates individual will to abstract law when he addresses the schoolteacher who be friends him and Egeria after their night in the woods: '"If we were deceiving you, we should be the sufferers, and not you. There is a law in these things which no individ ual will can abrogate. In the end, truth and good always triumph'" (p. 143). He even tells the landlord of the inn where Egeria seems to demonstrate her psychic powers that "good" has come inevitably from "evil." Howells in 1902 seems to have accepted a modified version of the same idea. However, although Boynton reveals a propensity for abstraction, he is not an abstrac tion himself, merely a spokesman for a certain philosophical position; he is a fully rounded character. Since the death of his wife, Boynton seems to have devised vari ous strategies for evading the impact of the death. The most obvious strategy is his attempt to substitute the daughter for the mother. His resentment of Ford, for example, probably is grounded in sexual antagonism, though Boynton attributes it to Ford's scep ticism. Another is his tendency to view events as functions of an abstract law and thus to justify them by assuming an attitude of fatalism. Both strategies separate him from the actual world. Thus, Howells makes the novel's philosophical issues integral to his portrayal of character. Intellectual questions are presented in light of their ori gins in emotional experience. Similarly, Puritan tradition and deterministic evolutionary theory converge to help explain Boynton's fatalism. His passivity finds psychological underpinnings in his Calvinist upbringing. He remarks to the Shakers, '"I had been bred in the strictest sect of the Calvinists, from which I had revolted to the opposite extreme of infidelity; I was a materialist, believing in nothing that I could not see, hear, touch, or taste'" (p. 178). Boynton's spiritualism, though he intends it to be a rejection of both Cal vinism and materialism, contains a secular equivalent to the idea of election (the '"law"' which the individual will cannot "'abrogate'"). Given his interest in "'evolutionary'" influences, it is reasonable to assume that this law is based in science. In Boynton's conviction that good will triumph over evil, one finds an optimistic brand of determin ism that reconciles science with human dignity and spiritual aspiration. That recon</page><page sequence="7">237 ciliation, again, is a goal Howells himself envisioned. But Howells did not accept disregard for the will. Ford, in contrast to Boynton, is associated with willed action and choice in the novel. Repelled emotionally and intellectually by the thought of Egeria's becoming a Shaker, Ford asks Boynton, "'Don't you think the possible power of choosing is a great advantage? I don't know that as a man I expect to be happy; but I like to make my ventures in unhappiness. It saves me from the folly of accusing fate'" (p. 291). He also undertakes consciously willed action?and much is made of his initial hesi tation and eventual determination to act--when he acknowledges that he must pursue Egeria and win her affection. Through his characterization of Egeria Howells further explores the relationship between man and nature. Ford and Egeria are not merely symbolic characters, but Ford seems associated with rational qualities and Egeria with sensuous ones. Egeria assumes a mythic dimension at the time of her rebirth; she might aptly be linked with the figure of Proserpina. Images of flowers and fruit help indicate her recovery from illness, and that recovery, or rebirth, is made psychologically as well as physiologi cally valid because of the burial imagery (passim) which has preceded the images of fecundity. Egeria's rebirth occurs, of course, during the spring; she remarks that she never would have gotten well in autumn. More significantly, she would not have cho sen to recover: ". . .it would n't seem the same thing if it were fall. If it had been fall, I should not have got well; I should not have cared to get well. " "Nay, " replied the Shaker; "if it is for us to choose, we are to choose to get well at all times. " "I mean, " said the girl, "that I could not have chosen. " (pp. 191-192) For Egeria, effective choice can occur only when choice is brought into harmony with the cyclic inevitability of nature. Her passivity makes her "choice" rather negligible. But Egeria is symbolic of the health of the natural world, and her statements describe an ideal union between the self and that which lies outside it, or, perhaps more ac curately, that which works through it. This union depends upon the receptivity of mind to natural forces. Boynton's death in autumn and Ford's preference for Egeria and the country to the "win tersnugness" ofthecity (p. 308) also contribute to the novel's symbolic framework. Eger ia's rise and Boynton's decline, her youth and his age, her participation in nature and his. long separation from it are absorbed into the contrast between spring and fa 11, as are ten sions between city and country, masculine and feminine, rational and sensuous or emo tional. These contrasts therefore emphasize man's interconnectedness with nature in a broad, archetypal sense and also give the novel a sense of cyclic time. But they help develop a sense of linear time as well. Seasonal, sexual, and psychological polarities are brought into harmonious poise through the marriage of Ford and Egeria. Given Ford's interest in choice and willed action, and given Howells's association of Egeria with the natural world, the marriage symbolically unites the moral and material worlds to establish the conditions necessary for progress. If synthesis may be as sumed to issue from thesis and antithesis, the marriage represents not closure but advancement. The inconclus ivene s s of the final paragraph, quoted above, justifies that assumption. The novel's ending points forward in time. The marriage is more</page><page sequence="8">238 than just a conventional comic resolution; it is a function of Howells's vision of pro gress. That vision cannot be explained wholly in terms of evolution, certainly, but the emphasis upon evolution in this particular novel points to science as a source of this fairly typical Howells ending. It remains to discuss another internal structural feature apparent in many Howells novels: the operation of chance. *2 Howells's use of the conspicuously accidental or coincidental event helps define his view of how the moral and material worlds are interrelated. To understand Howells's view of the moral world, it is necessary to con sider his thoughts on action and motive. These thoughts in turn indicate how the moral world comes to be shaped by evolutionary processes. Ford stresses the importance of motive as he tries to relieve Boynton of anxiety: '"We may make others unhappy, but we can't destroy the possibility of happiness in them; we can only do that in ourselves. Your conscience has to do with your motives; it judges you by them, and God?if we suppose Him--will not judge you by anything else. The effect of misguided actions belongs to the great mass of impersonal evil'" (p. 319). The '"great mass of impersonal evil'" anticipates both the "vast sum of evil, not personally detachable and punishable" in THE SON OF ROYAL LANGBRITH and the "wrong, " transmuted by Nature in the moral and material worlds, mentioned by Howells in 1902.13 Although it is necessary to distinguish between a wrong action and an evil ac tion?one being misguided, the other malicious?wrong and evil seem to merge in the statement quoted from HARPER'S. By positing a "mass of impersonal evil," Howells divorces evil as an abstract reality from both error and malice as concrete actions or psychological facts. This evil is not, however, a force intrinsic to nature. Rather, it is the residue from human actions that cause pain and anxiety, and it seems to be the "wrong" that Nature transmutes into good "for the race. " Thus moral advancement and biological progress fall under the operation of the same natural law. Through his treatment of chance events in THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY Howells provides an image, at the level of plot, of how misfortune can result from accidental or misguided actions and can, in turn, have a positive consequence. Early in the novel, Boynton is delayed in his visit to Ford by a child's being run over in the street. Two positive results issue from these chance events (the child's injury and Boynton's presence are both accidental): Boynton brief ly is forced to resume his humanitarian func tion as a doctor of medicine, and the Boyntons ' friend Hatch has all the time he needs to talk Ford out of agreeing to a psychic contest with Egeria, who suffers from ex haustion. The reader is reminded of random forces beyond human control and of the interconnectedness of all men. Later, Boynton and Egeria get on the wrong train be cause Boynton has become preoccupied with talking to the Shakers at the railroad sta tion. That accident really is an avoidable consequence of Boynton's failure of atten tion. It therefore is intended to criticize his disregard for actuality. But it also ironi cally transports Boynton and Egeria to the Shaker community, eventually, and sets in motion the events surrounding Egeria's illness, her recuperation, and the doctor's own recognition scene and death. And it is by rather remarkable coincidence that Ford ar rives at the Shaker settlement on the very night that Boynton fails in his attempt to demonstrate Egeria's psychic powers. The marriage of Ford and Egeria, certainly a favorable occurrence, results, then,</page><page sequence="9">239 not only from Ford's willed act of courtship but from several chance events. Ford's unexpected arrival, not at all outside the realm of credibility but notably coincidental, contributes to events a certain aura of fatality which makes apparent chance assume the aspect of providential design, though the text offers no support for asserting the operation of Providence. However, the form of the novel allows Howells to show the same accommodation between willed and unwilled action that he expressed as a state ment of faith in creative evolution more than twenty years later. The novel, of course, is not nearly as declarative as the statement; Howells was not using the novel to demonstrate an abstract concept. If he had done so, he would have violated one of his fundamental aesthetic premises: that plot is of value only as it reveals character. Also, he would have been imposing a preconceived no tion of reality upon his fiction. That imposition, too, would have been inimical to Howells's imagination and to his understanding of realism. Robert M. Figg, III, has distinguished realism from naturalism on the basis of whether a priori concepts exist: In both realism of the commonplace and critical realism, then, there is manip ulation of observed data--a selection and arrangement of fictional materials in the interest of embodying the author's view of reality; but the assumptions governing the selection and disposal of these materials are relatively mild and the image of life presented is relatively close to the actual. No highly pre scriptive ideas are imposed on the novel, more or less wrenching its materi als into shapes and patterns that strike us as distortions of what has been observed in the world of actuality. ^ Figg properly assigns the technique of "scientific objectivity" to the realist. The naturalist, he believes, adds a philosophy of materialistic determinism to his treat ment of the observable world. Figg does not precisely explain why an author's "view of reality" and his "pre scriptive ideas" cannot overlap, except to say that determinism cannot be proved through observation of the concrete world. And that explanation, after all, is suffi cient within the scope of Figg's essay. But the realist's intellectual preoccupations must become part of his view of reality when his observations of the world confirm certain scientific or philosophical theories. The open-ended resolution of THE UN DISCOVERED COUNTRY and the openness of experience thereby implied bring Howells closer to existentialism than to determinism. ^ But the fact remains that Howells was interested in many of the same issues treated by the naturalists: free will and moral responsibility, the concept of nature as process, the problem of giving meaning to or discovering it in experience. Theme, characterization, and structure in THE UNDIS COVERED COUNTRY emerged from the mental atmosphere which it has been the purpose of this essay to define, at least in part. Howells was an eclectic reader, as well as an independent thinker about his art, and it would be misleading to insist upon the exclusiveness of any one influence on his fiction. But an awareness of his interest in evolution helps explain the appeal to Howells of certain themes and techniques characteristic of his realism. NOTES 1 Harry H.

I am indebted to this discussion for my own treatment of the subject, below. 12 Many of those who write about the economic novels stress, following Howells's own lead, his "world of chance." See, for example, Walter Fuller Taylor, "William Dean Howells and the Economic Novel," AMERICAN LITERATURE, 4 (1932), 103-113; rpt. in Eble, pp. 183-195. 13W. D. Howells, THE SON OF ROYAL LANGBRITH, ed. David Burrows, et al. (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 19 69), p. 267. 14Robert M. Figg, III, "Naturalism as a Literary Form, " GEORGIA REVIEW, 18 (1964), 312. George C. Carrington, Jr. , makes a connection between Howells and existen tialism in THE IMMENSE COMPLEX DRAMA: THE WORLD AND ART OF THE HOWELLS NOVEL (Columbus: Ohio State Univ. Press, 1966), especially pp. 28-29. It does not seem wise to push the comparison too far. Carrington stresses the potentially terrify ing components of the Howells world without taking due note of how Howells qualifies the terror. Partial evil, as Fiske's dog under the knife could not possibly know, is sometimes universal good?at least in THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. It is so be cause of Howells's vision of the future.
