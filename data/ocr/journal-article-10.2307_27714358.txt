<plain_text><page sequence="1">Klopstock. Religion und Dichtung. Von Gerhard Kaiser. (Studien zu Religion, Geschichte und Geisteswissenschaft, Vol. i.) G?tersloh: Ver lagshaus Gerd Mohn, 1963. Pp. 371. DM 34. In his earlier book, Pietismus und Patriotismus im literarischen Deutschland the author gave evidence of his deep understanding of the religious forces operat ing in eighteenth-century Germany, and displayed convincingly how impor tant those forces were in determining the literary modes. Now he turns his attention to the central significant figure that had been treated only peripher ally in the earlier work. I do not recall that he there excused his Cinderella-like treatment of Klopstock with the promise of this forthcoming special study, but this volume, which is in many ways complementary to the earlier one, certainly supplies the explanation. The first chapter surveys the relevant secondary literature and demol ishes Kindt's muddle-headed hero-worship as well as the pretensions of recent Existentialist denigration. The author's aim is to raise the discussion from the level of polemics and as objectively as possible attempt to understand Klop stock as a religious poet. He claims, with confidence and with complete justifi cation, that he can take Klopstock's religion seriously, inasmuch as he bases his enquiry on an understanding of its peculiarities that is more exact and his torically sounder than has hitherto been attempted (p. 24). He establishes his own position unambiguously: F?r Klopstock allein unter den gro?en Gestalten der neueren deutschen Literatur sind religi?se und dichterische Ergriffenheit untrennbar eins. Er vollendet sich als Dichter, weil er Christ ist, und als Christ, weil er Dichter ist. (p. 27) Whether we can agree completely with this point of view at this stage is unim portant; my own reservations, that I see him as a poet of religion rather than as a religious poet, will become apparent in due course. Chapter 2 examines the relation between Klopstock's beliefs and attitudes and the philosophy of Leibniz. The evidence yields no more than the fact that Klopstock was subject to the general atmosphere of Leibniz-Wolffian ideas, which had shaped all mid-century Enlightenment in its rejection of dogmatic orthodoxy. The crux of this issue lay in the equation of God with Reason. For all this generation a transcendental God no longer manifested Himself in na</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 119 ture: He was immanent in nature. Thus all man's rational seeking for fuller understanding and appreciation of nature brought him closer to God. Further, for Klopstock and many like him, the soul was held to be the seat of Reason. God is indeed not directly accessible to man, but all the soul's strivings towards fuller apprehension were in themselves stirrings of the divine force, fleeting and fragmentary ripples in the infinite flood of God's Reason. Such views need not imply any knowledge whatever of the philosophy that under lay them; they were shared by all the rationalistic theologians among Klop stock's friends and acquaintances?Jerusalem, Spalding, Sack, J. A. Schlegel, Alberti. If a source for Klopstock's attitudes must be found, it surely lay here rather than in any direct study of the metaphysics. His many references to Leibniz certainly point to the conclusion that his interest was focussed on the philosopher's linguistic preoccupations and the programme for cultural reform (foundation of the Academy). The oft-repeated anecdote of the student Klop stock's absorption in the Theodicy is, in my opinion, in all probability just another of the stories that Klopstock produced for his admirers : in his old age he was very given to "drawing the long-bow." Lessing disturbed and Kant finally destroyed this Leibniz-Wolffian unity between faith and knowledge. It was not necessary for Klopstock even to try and read Kant in order to realise that the new metaphysics had brought the whole cosmos down about his ears. Kaiser is certainly right in claiming that Klopstock's antagonism was not merely to Kant's language: "doch steigt hier am Horizont seines Denkens eine Ahnung von den Gef?hrdungen auf, die . . . aus der Aufl?sung des Bandes von Wissen und Glauben emporsteigen sollten" (p. 44). It is, however, not equally convincing when he draws the conclusion that Klopstock restricted his attack to the linguistic plane solely because he was so sure of himself: "in seiner durch Glaubens- und Denkgewi?heit gleicherma?en gesicherten. . . . Weltsicht zu fest gegr?ndet, als da? ihn die Kantische Vernunftkritik innerlich ernsthaft ersch?ttern k?nnte." At least equally plausible would be the conclusion that it was in fact his spiritual insecurity that drove him to dismiss Kant without examining the ideas?and to dismiss him with an emotionalism out of all proportion to the trivial grounds of his unreadability. After having convincingly disposed of Dilthey's and Kindt's thesis that Klopstock set out to clothe Leibniz's philosophy in poetic form, it is equally easy for the author in Chapter 3 to refute Kindt's categoric rejection of Pietis tic influences. The last word has certainly not been said on this subject. The author's eighty pages succeed in establishing a degree of general similarity, but are equally conscientious in delimiting the realms of direct contact. The cur rent na?ve generalizations for or against Klopstock as a Pietist are put into the shade by this highly sophisticated discussion of the problem. It was not diffi cult in passing to demonstrate how Kindt himself undermined his own thesis when he cited connections between Klopstock and a Pietist like Rambach without apparently being aware of the latter's Pietism (p. 154). What still re mains to be done here is to uncover the specific sources of Klopstock's Pietis tic unorthodoxy. Fuller biographical information than is at present available will be necessary before final clarity can be reached. Particularly interesting would be evidence about the origin of Klopstock's major heterodoxy: the</page><page sequence="3">i2o Betteridge figure of Abbadona, which aroused such passionate interest among his con temporaries, is the embodiment of apocatastasis panton (restitution of all things: Acts, 3: 21), utterly flouting Article 17 of the Augsburg Confession which says, Die Gottlosen menschen aber, vnd die Teuflei jnn die hell vnd ewig straff verdamnen. Derhalben werden die widderteuffer verwrorffen, so leren, das die Teuffel vnd verdampte menschen nicht ewige pein vnd quai haben wTerden. (Corpus Reformatorum [1858], xxvi, 569) These opening chapters supply the background of theological climate against which Klopstock's works were produced, though indeed considerable quotation from the poems was introduced, notably in the chapter on Pietism, in order to bring out the points of contact. Kaiser's concluding summary sees Klopstock's religious attitudes as a synthesis of Pietistic elements and the neological religiosity of Enlightenment: "Die sich ergebende Synthese ist h?chst originell und findet ihre Entsprechung in einer ebenso originellen dichterischen Formensprache" (p. 203). The second half of the book is con cerned with examining how this highly individual view of Christianity de termined the poetic works, and to what extent the highly original poetic prod ucts succeeded in expressing these attitudes. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 deal respec tively with Der Messias, the dramas, and the odes. The traditional treatment of Klopstock has continued to criticize in the light of Schiller's famous dictum. Kaiser, without any preconceived value judgements, examines what Klopstock set out to do. In the case of Der Mes sias he shows with the help of comparison with Milton how Klopstock at tempted to set the traditional abstraction of the Divinity's infinity and eternity within the Copernican concept of an infinite and eternal cosmos. Mil ton had worked within the anthropomorphic tradition of antiquity and had tried to make God apprehendable to man. Klopstock attempted to actualize Christianity's essentially different view of the spirit world with the help of modern scientific notions. It may well be that Milton's likening of his devils to a swarm of bees, or his description of God's movements with His departures and arrivals, does in fact succeed in producing better poetry; but Klopstock's "vagueness" was not the result of his inability to express his vision con cretely: he quite deliberately sought to destroy all notions of size, space, loca tion, distance, time, and sequence (the finitude of all sense perception). Turning to the biblical plays, instead of, as is usual, dismissing them just as bad plays, basing the judgement on some preconceived but unspecified view of what constitutes a good play, Kaiser examines Klopstock's aim and purpose in writing them. He shows them as accessories to Der Messias, in which sin and redemption are depicted in the context of the Old Testament, that is, in a purely terrestrial setting and without the mediation of Christ. It is perhaps disappointing that, in Kaiser's discussion of the lack of tragic conflict, the hori zon was not widened to include the question of whether and in what circum stances tragedy and Christianity are at all compatible. Obviously they were not for Klopstock, but could it have been otherwise for any author expressing the Christian view? Man sins and turns away from God; God, however, never abandons man. A short section of seven pages attempts to bring the Hermann</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 121 trilogy into the ambit of the religious poetry. I think this is quite miscon ceived. To be sure, Klopstock tactically exploited the bardic enthusiasm of the 70's in an attempt to make his religious drama acceptable to non-religious critics. He pointed out that in appreciating any work of literature the reader must suspend his own beliefs and temporarily accept those of the characters : what the public could do in the case of Germanic paganism should be no more difficult in the case of the Christian faith. Such manoeuvres by Klopstock in his prefaces fail, however, to explain why he should want to write patriotic historical drama. Despite a number of acute comments (such as that which notes Klopstock's ability to create dramatic tension by retarding the action rather than by bringing the characters into conflict, or the remarks about the use of choric interludes in a manner not unlike the Greek chorus), the section remains unconvincing because the central patriotic "Gehalt" of these plays is treated so superficially. It is perhaps justifiable for the author to dispense with what is not pertinent to his intention, but such treatment, I believe, both invalidates this section and weakens the overall scheme into which, through this treatment, he tries to force these plays. Forty pages on the odes can do little more than summarize and criticize existing findings. Within the framework of a book on Klopstock as a poet of religion this would perhaps be a fair allocation of space. It is too brief, how ever, to give conviction to the author's attempt to bring all Klopstock's work under the heading of religious poetry. With the help of an interesting compari son between Brockes's and Klopstock's modes of apprehending phenomena and a r?sum? of the earlier work on Klopstock's lyric style (Langen, Goldbach, Kaussmann, Jellinek), the conclusion is reached that "im Naturereignis voll zieht sich eine Begegnung zwischen Mensch und Gott" (p. 301). This is dis appointing, for it is obvious in respect of "Die Fr?hlingsfeier," with which this section is mainly concerned, and forced in so far as the generalization is in tended to apply to the lyric writing as a whole. The next section seeks to show that the source of Klopstock's lyrical feeling "liegt in der ?berschreitung der Wirklichkeit, im dynamischen Aufstreben vom Menschlichen zu den Grenzen der Menschheit" (p. 302). Using the same method of comparison and r?sum? (Vi?tor, Busch, Schuchard, Closs, Kayser, Beissner, B?ger), the structure and metrics are examined and copiously illustrated. To the last, shorter section, entitled "Erstarrung," are relegated all the poems that the author describes as purely secular. His criterion is rather arbitrary. Accepting the postulate "das religi?se Erleben der Welt ist die allein lebendige Quelle von Klopstocks Lyrik" (p. 320), wherever "life" is to be found in the poetry, religious inspira tion, or at least the aura of religion has to be found there also. In this way all the poems about friendship and love as well as the patriotic and even the occasional verse can be viewed as "religious." This leaves only the quite con siderable body of political poetry and the verse dealing with philosophical or aesthetic questions. The section is occupied with a close examination of one of these latter poems, "Der Unterschied" of 1771. This serves only to illustrate the prefixed axiomatic judgement: "die Entfremdung Klops tocks vom Quell seiner Lyrik f?hrt zur Erstarrung" (p. 321). Compared with the heuristic ap proach to Der Messias this is disappointing. Herder's cautious formulation of his view that many of these poems are "sehr kunstvolle Abhandlungen uno</page><page sequence="5">122 Betteridge denm??iger Gegenst?nde" is rephrased as the dogmatic observation, "trotz dieser odischen Charakteristika aber hat Klopstock die innere Form der Ode verfehlt" (p. 323). General agreement with the view that many of these products of the middle period are not great poetry, nor even a significant contribution to Ger man verse-writing, does not nevertheless necessarily entail acceptance of the thesis propounded, but not debated by Kaiser to explain his view. I would join issue with him here. As I have suggested elsewhere, the unshakable nature of Klopstock's Christian faith has not been proved to my satisfaction. Indeed, Kaiser's own suggestion that it was a synthesis of two such discordant and even antagonistic trends as Pietism and neologistic Rationalism confirms my suspicion that there was deep, inner insecurity. It might well be claimed that the soundest Christian is he who, beset by doubts, nevertheless overcomes them and struggles through to a stable and satisfying faith. This may to be sure have been true of Klopstock in the latter part of his life. Yet no enquiry has hitherto established this fact. That the doubts existed during his earlier years appears to me to be incontrovertibly attested by the original versions of some of his poems, e.g., the suppressed passage at the end of "Dem Allgegen w?rtigen." In all the literature about Klopstock far too much reliance con tinues to be placed on the anecdotes and comments recorded by C. F. Cramer in his five-volume encomium. This work was not only an unashamed piece of hagiolotry; its only source was such selective memories as Klopstock himself saw fit to communicate, and he was concerned above all to propagate the public image of himself as the great religious poet. The copious quotation from Klopstock's own writings, with which Kaiser supports his claims in the con cluding chapter, does not impress me as infallible evidence. Haller's Tagebuch seiner Beobachtungen and Briefe ?ber die wichtigsten Wahrheiten der Offen barung reveal more than conceal the fact that he was tortured by doubt; in the same way all Klopstock's protestations make perfectly good sense as apolo getics. It is indeed probable that my inclination to dispute the postulate under lying the author's argument does prevent me from going with him all the way to the end of his book. The expository chapters on Enlightenment and Pietism appear to me to be beyond reproach (perhaps because, as compared with the author, I am ignorant of these matters). They certainly make accessible to us important new insights. Of the interpretative chapters that on Der Messias and the section on the biblical dramas are excellent in that the new findings do succeed in illuminating these works in a manner not achieved by any previous writer on Klopstock. The attempt to see the patriotic dramas in the same light fails to convince, and the summary treatment of the odes must inevitably appear forced and unsatisfactory, relegating as peripheral everything that cannot yield the desired result. It is significant that the work contains no reference at all to Die Deutsche Gelehrtemepublik, which occupied such an important place in Klopstock's programme during the 6o's and 70's (and, as his unpublished papers reveal, was already in his mind from 1755). I opened these remarks with the suggestion that the work before us is in some ways complementary to the author's Pietismus und Patriotismus. That work was not in the first place a study of Herder, Claudius, etc., but an analysis of the</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 123 religious trends and the impact they made on these writers. In so far as this new work does the same for Klopstock, it is indeed complementary. A volume devoted solely to this problem was called for because religious factors played such a large part in determining Klopstock's literary aims and attitudes. But as his title indicates, the author's purpose went further than this: it was to be a book about Klopstock's writings, illuminated by and interpreted through his religious attitudes. In this I believe it fails, for it does not give us the whole picture. The programme of Germanic or national cultural reform, centered on the "Vienna plan," became the focus for all hope and effort over long periods. A complete picture of the real Klopstock, both the man and the poet, cannot emerge until all the various aspects of his endeavor are brought into relation with each other and satisfactorily integrated. When the time is ripe for this task to be undertaken, that is, when all the available source-material can be published, this book will be indispensable in throwing light where the literary biographer will most need it.
