<plain_text><page sequence="1">HITTITE TARPI? AND HEBREW TERAPHIM HARRY A. HOFFNER, JR., Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts IF biblical scholars are today not yet in possession of a convincing etymology for terdphim, it is certainly not due to any lack of theories.1 As early as the Septuagint there seems to be evidence for an attempt to connect the word with the verb GEpa&amp;rEdw, "to heal."'2 From the period of the Targums comes the statement "Why are they called terdphim, if not that they are works of t5reph (obscenity) ?"3 Another early Jewish interpretation was that terdphim was a metathesized form from an original PTRYM, "interpreters." 4 Most of the views which are current in Old Testament studies today are developments of these very early theories. They may be classified as follows: (1) Views which presume textual corruption, whether deliberate or otherwise, (2) views which assume the t to be a preformative, and (3) views which conclude that the triconsonantal root is TRP. In the first group falls the recent brief study of the word by C. J. Labuschagne.5 Labuschagne elaborates on the view first proposed :in Tanchum (cited above) without apparently realizing that this view is not original with himself.6 He argues that the original PTRYM, "interpreters," has been intentionally deformed into TRPYM as a cacophemy to denote objects "repugnant to later religious thought."'7 The mention of the real name was avoided out of respect for tabu. Such an interpretation of the name allows us to under- stand how the terdphim can be coupled with the ephod, which is also used for cultic inquiry. Labuschagne does not insist upon a particular physical appearance of these "interpreters," but maintains: "whatever their form may have been-masks, or images of the figurine type, or perhaps a combination of these-what is certain on the strength of the etymology of the word, is that they were mantic devices designed to be consulted on the interpretation of dreams." 8 He attempts also to reconcile this view with the nar- rative of I Samuel, chap. 19, suggesting that the emissaries of Saul sent to bring the (presumed) ailing David from his bedchamber to the king feared to enter the room "while the teraphim stood by his bedside, for a sick man consulting the interpreters of dreams on questions of life and death, might not be disturbed."9 Of course, in order to defend such an interpretation of I Samuel, chap. 19, one is forced to alter the wording of the text or at least misconstrue the Hebrew. For, although the phrase ,nt-ptx of verses 13 and 16 might conceivably be rendered "at the bed(-side)" as well as "in/on 1 For a complete bibliography of studies of this term see the article in RGG3, A.

Michal had employed this image, which was con- sequently no "figurine" but a life-size statue,"1 as a substitute for the body of her husband. Labuschagne's view does have in its favor a possible explanation for the grouping with the ephod. Yet it is unfortunately true here, as in general with all cases of "reconstruction" of earlier forms by means of presumed metatheses, that one can prove almost any theory if he is permitted to tamper with the evidence. It may be that whatever "deformation" is assumed took place before any of the manuscripts or versions in our possession today were composed.12 But this cannot be proved. Until there is some concrete evidence from an early text that PTRYM or some other form once stood where TRPYM now stands, theories which assume this cannot be considered more than vague and remote possibilities. Belonging to our second category are theories which derive terdphim from either the root RP', "to heal," or RPY, "to be languid, limp." As noted above, the similarity between the transliteration of terdphim into Greek letters and the Greek verb GEPaV7TEV6, "to do service to the gods," "treat medically," 13 may have set the Jewish translators of the OT into Greek to thinking about an etymological relationship of TRPYM and Rp', "to heal." As has been long observed, one interpretation of the I Samuel 19 incident accords well with the theory that the terdphim were "healing deities." 14 Yet certain phonological and morphological considerations stand in the way of deriving terdphim from a root RP'. The omission of the aleph from the orthography has not been satisfactorily explained. Furthermore, the vocalic pattern qetalim as a masculine plural points to a singular with one of only four possible vocalizations: (1) qdt.&amp;l, (2) qatl, (3) qitl, or (4) qutl, the last three of which would appear in the singular as segholates in massoretic Hebrew. Neither of these four singulars would accord with the expansion of the root RP: by means of a pre- formative T.15 The same objection applies to a derivation from the root RPY, "to be limp, languid." Indeed, if the evidence of the vocalic pattern is taken seriously, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the tri-consonantal root was considered to be TRP. But if TRP is the true root of terdphim, where else is this root attested either in Hebrew itself or in the other Semitic languages ? From the post-biblical period we know of Hebrew words like t5reph and tarpi?th, which connote "obscenity," "vileness," and the like. And some scholars, following the early etymological judgment of Tanchima, wayyus'. (cited above), believe that biblical Hebrew terdphim originated from just such a notion ("the vile things" as a pejorative).*1 There is, however, no guarantee that these words from post-biblical Hebrew are not themselves creations from the earlier terdphim, the original 10 Thus verse 13 says that she placed a pillow at its head and covered it with a garment. The intention seems perfectly clear, and it has long been recognized by OT scholars. 11 It is vaguely possible that a mask was allowed to protrude from under the covers to look like David's face, but the greater probability is that the major part of the terdphim was covered with a garment, hence, it must have been anthropomorphic and life- size. See C. H. Gordon, "Teraphim," Interpr. Dict. of Bible, IV, 574. 12 There is no evidence for any earlier meta- thesized form in any of the early Hebrew manuscripts or in the early versions. As noted above, the LXX transliterates it so as to presuppose TRPYM or TRPYN (a variant plural formation). 13 Liddell and Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon (9th ed.), p. 793. 14 Ackroyd, op, cit., p. 379. 15 Gesenius-Kautzsch-Cowley, Hebrew Grammar, pp. 237-38. 16 W.

Consequently, they can offer no independent witness for the existence of a semitic root TRP. The Arabic lexicon has been aptly dubbed by native speakers of the language as al-qdmi&amp;s ("the ocean"), for its contents are inexhaustible. It is not, therefore, surprising that by searching therein one may produce a verb tarifa (root: TRP), "to live in opulence or luxury," "enjoy a soft existence."17 From this meaning one can even proceed to establish a proto-Semitic root TRP, "to be soft, limp." Yet once again the matter is complicated by questions of dating and provenience of the Arabic term. Most of the literature on which modern Arabic lexicons are based is post-Christian. The principal body of Arabic literature which antedates the Christian Era is the corpus of Old South Arabic Inscriptions, where apparently this root is not yet attested.18 When we examine the Semitic inscriptions from the third and second millennia B.C.E., we find no such root.19 Only in one place, in a Ugaritic poem about Baal and Anat, do we find any form which might possibly be construed as deriving from a root TRP. In the line ttkh ttrp mm, which has been trans- lated "the heavens will wear away and will sag,"20 some scholars have regarded ttrp as a G-stem third person masculine plural imperfect of the root TRP.21 Others, willing to concede the translation, prefer to analyze the form ttrp as a Hithpael (or tD) from the root RPY.22 The form, therefore, is so problematic that no case for the existence of a proto-Semitic root TRP can be based upon it. There appears then to be no evidence outside of terdphim itself from the earlier periods of the Semitic languages for a root TRP. What then are we to say about the linguistic origins of terdphim, if there is no ready Semitic etymology? The only avenue still open to us is to consider the possibility that the word was non-Semitic and perhaps borrowed at an early period from some other major linguistic group in the Near East. Among the influential peoples of the Near East during the third and second millennia B.C.E. whose languages were non-Semitic were the Egyptians, the Hurrians, and the Hittites. We may be permitted therefore to investigate their languages (so far as they are known) for a term which might have passed into early South Canaanite as terdphim. Yet the search for a candidate must be rigorously controlled by the following criteria: (1) the phonetic similarity must either be complete or the divergences must be readily explicable in terms of historical linguistics, (2) the word must bear a signification in texts of its own lan- guage which is appropriate as a designation for deities, cult images, or mantic devices, (3) the word must be attested from a period contemporary with the formative stages of Hebrew religion and statehood, and (4) the word must belong to the language of a people who exercised a cultural influence upon Syria and/or Palestine during the period in question. In the spring of 1965 at the annual meeting of the American Oriental Society in Chicago, Professor Benno Landsberger noted in the course of an address concerned with the present status of Assyriology that recent epigraphical evidence from Bogazkby suggested to him a connection between the Hebrew noun terdphim and the "Hittite" 17 H.

And, although the writer's own particular field of interest was Hittitology, he did not pursue the matter further on his own at that time. In the fall of 1966, however, with the appearance of the third supplementary fascicle of J. Friedrich's Hethitisches Warterbuch, there was made available to the scholarly world at least one tantalizing bit of this evidence. Professor Heinrich Otten of Marburg announced that he had succeeded in joining several new fragments (to be published in hand copies in the forthcoming volume Keilschrifttexte aus Boghazkli, Heft 13, [Berlin: Gebr. Mann], Text No. 1) to the existing columns of KBo I 44, and that the new join restored the full Akkadian and Hittite readings for an impor- tant section of the Bokazkay version of the lexical series e r i m. h u s = anantu.24 Otten further noted that among the new equations thus revealed was that of the Akka- dian terms lamassu and Sjdu with Hittite annaris and tarpis respectively. Equally opportune was the appearance of an article by Wolfram von Soden of Miinster in which he discussed the meanings of these two Akkadian terms on the basis of all their known occurrences in Assyro-Babylonian literature.25 Von Soden concluded from his study that, although both terms were originally abstract nouns denoting some aspect of the life force, in second and first millennium texts lamassu and Sjdu came to signify deities or spirits which might be either protective or harmful. And although there exist rare instances of both evil lamassu's and good Sjdu's, the normal pattern was for the two as a pair to denote benevolent spirits, while Sjdu alone (usually in incantations) represents an evil demon.26 Hence, according to the equation yielded by the newly restored lexical text, Hittite tarpis (nom. sing. of the stem tarpi- 27) denotes an evil demon. But if this newest bit of evidence is the most conclusive with regard to determining the meaning of tarpig, it is by no means the only occurrence of that term. In three other texts from the Hittite capital tarpis appears in immediate juxtaposition with annariv in a manner reminiscent of the Akkadian combination lamassu and sedu, expressing two aspects of a single protective genius.28 Illustrating the other connotation of tarpis (when 23 I should like to express my thanks to Professor Landsberger for granting me permission to cite him in this context for his public remarks on terdphim. 24 J.

In XXXII 87 (annual festival celebrated by the queen) we are reading a description of a festival rite in which the celebrant drinks in a seated position eight times to eight different deities (]. 10). Although there is a break on the right side of the tablet, there are at least parts of eight different divine names in the following four lines-but only if annarin tarpin is counted as one deity! This is sig- nificant, since it indicates that annari? tarpi? as a combination was conceived as one daiman, not two. In KUB II 8 (Antahjum festival for the tutelary deity of TauriBa) the annarik tarpig occurs in a sequence of ostensibly benevolent forces: EME-a? hantanza ("the true tongue"), ZI-BU (= zibu "food-offering," CAD, Z, p. 105?), ?arrumar ("allotment"?), and DUD.SIG5 (= DIzzistanu). The :tarpiu? of KBo XII 70, line 13b, which is parallel to ga14-ni-ni (= ganini "magazines") in the Akkadian version, is more prob- lematic. Von Schuler has suggested orally to Friedrich (HWb, Erg. 3, p. 33) the translation "Vorrats- raum(?)." This much is probable not only on the basis of the Akkadian but even from the Hittite con- text (what there remains of it): ha-ri-i?-ta-ni-u? :tar-pi-i-u?-sa ku-i-e-e? hal-ki-it ?u-un-nd-e?-?ir GIM- an-ma-ta DGul-ga-ag UD.KAM-u? ti-an-zi nu 9-an a-ra-li-i en kap-pu-u-wa-a-an-zi na-an-ta ki-it-kar-za zi-ik-klcn-zi, "they who have filled with barley the harigtaniu? and the :tarpiu?, when the days of the DGul'e' arrive for you, they will count nine aralin and lay them at your head." Thus the two objects referred to by harigtani- and :tarpi- can be filled with grain. Yet how do we reconcile the meaning "Vorrats- raum(?)" with "evil demon"? That there is some connection is hinted by the word harigtani-, which- although it denotes something which can contain grain here-is apparently based upon the same stem as the divine name DHarigtagii occurring alongside of annarin tarpin in KUB XXXII 87 rev 13-14.

[he put], cursing(?) he put, disease he p[ut]." The significance of this passage becomes clear when it is viewed against the background afforded by other incantation passages of a similar type. Bronze cauldrons with lids of lead also figure in the incantation of the wrath of the vanishing god Tele- pinu,33 as well as in that of the deity designated by the Sumerogram dMAH.34 In these with the diminutive -(a)nni- to form the container name haristani- ("the little *harijta-"?) but with -(a)??i- (HE2, par. 51b) to form the divine name dHaritagii ("he of the *hari.ta-"?). Is it too much to suggest that the harigtaniug and :tarpius here are containers perhaps in the shapes of the deities to guard and care for the deceased? It is interesting also to note in passing that the Akkadian (originally Sumerian) word ganfinu/ganinu has (by coincidence?) the same consonantal skeleton as the later Arabic term for the protective genii (jinnu). 29 I restore i-da-a-lu conjecturally on analogy with other similar incantation rituals. 30 The sign is that which occurs in Forrer's and Friedrich's sign lists as SA5 (= SI + A). A reading SAs, "red," is impossible here. This context requires a synonym of "sorrow, grief." Deimel, SL, II 123:8 lists a DIRIG. GA = alugtu ("grief") for which see also Von Soden, AHw, p. 86a. The reading DIRIG is, how- ever, complicated by the vocabulary entry sa - aSA5 - a~&amp;gu of CT XII 9 iv 9 (cited in AHW, p. 79b sub a$?du III). 31 The signs are ?i-pa-an. No word ?ipa- with single writing of the p is known elsewhere in Hittite. The -an is clearly the Hittite accus. sg. case ending. The interpretation of the two preceding signs is problematic. I. PA is hardly an ideogram here. Nor, since the Hittite word for "eye" is gakui-, does a reading IGI-pa-an satisfy. A value of li for IGI is known from the divination text AT 454 found at Alalakh (Gurney apud D. J. Wiseman, The Alalakh Tablets, p. 117, n. 6). It may also be found in a rare instance at Bogazkoy (hu-tal-li-ya-a[g] in KBo I 51 rev 14). On the Alalakh occurrence, but not noting the Bogazk6y example, see H. Kronasser, Etym. der hethitischen Sprache, I, p. 492, n. 2. Yet even employing Li we obtain nothing convincing: li-pa-an. In Old Akkadian and Old Assyrian texts, however, one finds also the value Mim (Von Soden, Akkad. Syllabar, p. 77 sub #261). Its distribution is quite restricted, being found only in word-final positions, where the mn represents the mimation. Yet a reading h1m in KUB XXXIII 66 has great plausibility, especially since an expanded form lumpagti-!lupaJti- "sorrow, grief" is already known from other texts (HWb, p. 131a; see also KUB XXXVI 97 rev iv 1-2: idalun lupagtin zi-ni piran arha uiyaddu, "let him banish baleful grief from the mind!"). A reading of Idm-pa-an here would provide us with the simplex of lumpagti- (HE2, ? 44d; EHS, ?? 33, 115). There is also made possible an etymological connection with Greek AV7Trv "sorrow, grief," which according to Frisk (GEW, II, 145-46) is cognate to forms such as rump- in Latin and lup-/rup- in Sanskrit. 32 The signs in the copy are clearly HAR/IUR and DI. The form hurdi cannot easily be connected with hurtai- "curse," since the latter is of common gender, requiring an accus. sg. thurtain and an accus. pl. hurtaug. If the second sign is read as ki (!), a reading harki (nom.-accus. neut. sg.-pl. of harki- "white") is pos- sible. But "the white thing(s)" is awkward. It is tempt- ing on grounds which I cannot elaborate here (see my "English-Hittite glossary" [RHA f. 80 (1967)], 80-81, n. 154) to take harki as the Nesite reading of Kf. BABBAR and translate "silver he put," for we know that both raw silver and silver objects were often dropped into sacrificial pits (a-a-pi) as gifts to chthonic spirits, and the cult image of dSulikatte ( = Nergal) is trimmed (as well as his weapons) with silver. Yet in a context with evils (bloodshed, tears, grief, etc.) even this reading is unsatisfactory. It is perhaps best just to read the signs hur-di and leave them untranslated for the present. 33 Cat. 258, 1st version of Telepinu Myth, A iv 15-19 (latest transliteration by E.

In the Hittite incantation text the absence of annari8 is both striking and significant. For there would be no need to confine annari8, since she is a beneficial and protective force rather than an evil one. In summary, the Hittite evidence is conclusive that tarpi- denotes a spirit which can on some occasions be regarded as protective and on others as malevolent. It is possible in view of its connections with the netherworld in incantations that the spirit was a chthonic one, though this cannot be proved. Certainly this meaning would not be at odds with the various uses of Hebrew terdphim. For just as Akkadian lamassu and Sedu primarily denote the spirits but in later periods are employed to refer to the images, so also the same development may have occurred within Hittite. The terdphim are never directly referred to as objects of worship, though this is often assumed. They are mantic devices employed for cultic inquiry. Furthermore, we know that such inquiries which were not conducted along "orthodox" lines in ancient Israel were usually directed toward the netherworld.38 Thus, although the teriphim are never specifically grouped with the yidde'cnim or the :5bh6t, as objects of cultic inquiry, they may well have belonged to this same general category. Hence I believe that we can legitimately claim that the terms of criterion number two (allied meaning) have been met. Criterion number one (phonetic identity) can be satisfied as well, if we observe that Hittite proper names39 and common nouns40 regularly lose their consonantal case endings when they are borrowed into Ugaritic.41 This means that tarpiv (stem tarpi-) would have been taken over into a West Semitic language as *tarpi, and the final short i of the stem would have been altered in accordance with the early West Semitic case endings (u for nom., i for gen., a for accus.). If tarpi- was borrowed during the late 35 Texts: (kattan) dankui takni. 36 Texts: n-agta namma ?ara natta uizzi. 37 Zech. 5:5-11. 38 I Sam., chap. 28; Isa., 8:19; etc. 39 Note in the alphabetic texts from Ugarit the personal names 8uppiluliumas (tpllm, UT 118:16) and Tudhaliyas (tdMl, UT 1034:9; 1039:21), in both instances without the consonantal case endings. 40 Neuter nouns such as zapzagai- (= Ugar. spsg) prove nothing, since even in Hittite they have (at least in the nom. and accus.) no consonantal case endings. If T. H. Gaster (and the writer independently, cf. JNES, 23 [1964] 67) is correct in proposing Hittite kubahii (pronounced *kubaji??) as the origin of Hebrew Y17i "helmet," then this would provide one instance of the loss of the case ending in transfer. The writer's theory on Ugaritic d.t and its Anatolian origins (JNES, 23 [1964], 66-68) need not be rejected because of the final t, since an equally good case can be made for a pronounced *du`uggla for Hittite tuhhue?gar, "resin (for incense)" (see now H. G. Giiterbock, RHA, f. 74 [1964], pp. 106 f.). The final r of abstracts in -egWar and -atar is often omitted in the orthography, as doubtless also in speech (HE2, p. 33, par. 30b). It is not likely (so De Moor in JNES, 24 [1965], 355-56) that dj.t is a denominative verb "to incense for purification." Ch. Rabin's theory that Hebrew lappid preserves an instance of the Hittite instrumental case ending (i.e., *lappit from lappiya-, "kindling wood[?]"), is without precedent (Or, NS, 32 [1963], 129, n. 1). Rabin should also have indicated that *lappid/t is totally hypothetical as the instru- mental of the noun lappiya-, which is not at present attested in that case. Furthermore, it is not clear that nouns of the common gender in -iya- form their instrumentals by a monophthongization of the -iya- to -i-. Of the only two other Hittite nouns in -iya-, memiya- forms its instrumental by the addition of an n as hiatus (meminit), while there is no attested instrumental for taparriya-. 41 I am indebted to Dr. Manfred Weippert of Tiibingen, who by letter pointed out to me this characteristic of early loans from Hittite into Semitic languages.</page><page sequence="7">HITTITE TARPIM AND HEBREW TERAPHIM 67 Bronze Age, the vocalization of its nominative singular form would presumably have been *tarpu. According to the established rules of phonetic development for Hebrew such a form would have become *tereph in the (hypothetical) singular and terdphIm in the plural of massoretic Hebrew. Thus I believe that the phonetic identification of the two terms is convincing. As to criterion number three (chronology), the Hittite texts from Bogazkoy belong to a period roughly contemporaneous with the Hebrew patriarchs, Moses, and Joshua (ca. 1650-1200 B.C.E.). But although the earliest Hittite documents (e.g. the Anitta text: KBo III 22 +) date from as early as the age of the later patriarchs, it should be pointed out that the most likely period for the transfer would have been during the thirteenth century.42 The final criterion concerns the sphere of Hittite cultural influence. Now it cannot be questioned that Palestine (and particularly southern Palestine) lay within the cultural and political sphere of Egypt rather than that of the Hittites in the north or the cultures of Mesopotamia to the east. Yet OT scholars have long recognized that no one foreign power held a monopoly on the influencing of Palestinian life. The evidence of both literary and non-literary remains on Palestinian soil suggests that the early inhabitants thereof benefited (or suffered) from cultural influences proceeding from Egypt, the Aegean, Asia Minor, Syria, and Mesopotamia.43 The influence of Asia Minor in particular is perhaps slight in comparison with that from areas nearer at hand, yet it is clearly present. On the basis of evidence from the biblical text itself Hittite cultural influence has been detected which is linguistic,44 juristic,45 and historiographic.46 This influence may have been mediated by the migration of Anatolian peoples (either the ~.~7 themselves, as defended by E. Forrer,47 or perhaps the fil, as recently proposed by G. E. Mendenhall48) or indirectly through north Syrian peoples who enjoyed the cultural 42 Hittite political and cultural influence on North Syria during the period of the Old Kingdom (ca. 1650-1400 B.c.E.) was negligible. It is true that both Hattusili I and Mur'ili I campaigned in Syria, but no system of alliances or vassal relationships were insti- tuted until the time of 8uppiluliuma I (ca. 1380 B.C.E). It is from this latter period that we must trace the greatest political and cultural influences from Anatolia through Syria into Palestine. For the history see now 0. R. Gurney, "Anatolia c. 1750-1600 B.C." and "Anatolia c. 1600-1380 B.C." (New Cambr. Anc. Hist., Vol. 2, chaps 6 and 15), and A. Goetze, "The Struggle for the Domination of Syria," "Anatolia from Shuppiluliumash to the Egyptian War of Muwatallish," and "The Hittites and Syria" (New Cambr. Anc. Hist., Vol. 2, chaps 17, 21, and 24). 43 It is impossible to detail all of the archeological evidence here. Some of the more recent evidence is to be found in R. Hestrin and M. Tadmor, IEJ, 13 (1963), 283, n. 52, 287, and C. A. Key, IEJ, 13 (1963), 289-90. 44 Two articles summarize the present status fairly well: P. Fronzaroli, "Rapporti lessicali dell'ittita con le lingue semitiche," Archivo Glottologico Italiano 41 (1956), 32-45, and Ch. Rabin, "Hittite Words in Hebrew," Or., NS, 32 (1963), 113-39. Of the twenty- two examples cited by Rabin, only about seven are very plausible. Yet even these reveal an appreciable cultural influence albeit indirect. 4 The two best-known examples being the influence of the literary form of the Hittite suzerainty treaties upon early Hebrew covenant formulation (G. E. Mendenhall, Law and Covenant in Israel and the Ancient Near East; M. G. Kline, Treaty of the Great King; D. McCarthy, Treaty and Covenant), and the possible explanation of the issue at stake in the bargaining between Abraham and Ephron "the Hittite" in Genesis, chap. 23 (M. R. Lehmann, BASOR, no. 129 [1953], pp. 15-18, challenged recently by G. Tucker, JBL, 85 [1966], 77-84). 46 The matter of Hittite and biblical historio- graphy was investigated by A. Malamat in VT, 5 (1955), 1-12. This area deserves more study. There is a good possibility that Hittite literary forms underlie some of the earliest pieces of Hebrew historical writing, such as the celebrated "court history of David." My student, Dr. Herbert M. Wolf, has explored the relationships between the Apology of Hattu'ili' and I Sam., chaps. 16-31, and II Sam., chaps. 1-8, in his Brandeis University doctoral dissertation published in Xerography by University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, Mich., 1967. Much of the present writer's thinking on the matter is contained therein. 47 "The Hittites in Palestine," PEQ, 68, 190-209, and 69, 100-115. 48 G. E.

It is perhaps possible only to suggest a partial satisfaction of criterion number four. Yet even so, the accordance of this theory with the first three criteria and the likely fulfilment of number four render it far more plausible than any of its earlier rival hypotheses. The name teraphim is then, I suggest, a cultic term brought into Syria and Palestine by migrant cultic personnel49 formerly resident in Anatolia. It was adopted by the south Canaanites at the end of the Amarna Age (thirteenth century) and preserved for us only (to date) in the pages of the OT as a designation for a type of idol or mantic device. A Hurro-Hittite source for Hebrew terdphim would accord well with the apparent Hurro-Hittite origin of the Hebrew term '6bh "ritual pit; (spirit from the) ritual pit," which M. Vieyra (RHA f. 69 [1961], 47-55) first identified with Hittite a-a-bi. To this question the writer has recently devoted an entire article, "Second Millennium Ante- cedents to the Hebrew '6b," which is scheduled to appear in the Journal of Biblical Literature (hopefully Vol. 86 [1967], Part IV). It is possible that both Hebrew 6bh and terdphim are based upon old substratum words rather than upon loanwords from Hurrian or Hittite. Thus Professor Landsberger considers them to be "ursprachliches Residuum." This interpretation carries more conviction in the case of a-a-bi, since it has no cognates in Hittite. In the case of tarpis, however, one feels from the many cognate forms (tarpalis', tarpala8, tarpanalla'sa-, tarpatarpa-, and divine name DTarpatassis) that the word must be native to the language. Both words, however viewed as to source, have in both their Hebrew and Hittite manifestations a pronounced chthonic orientation. As seen above the Hittite tarpig could be confined in the netherworld, and the a-a-bi pit was intended as a means of gaining access to deities or departed spirits presently residing in the in- fernal regions. The Hebrew 6bh likewise was a pit used by a practitioner to communicate with departed spirits (I Sam., Chap. 28). The terdphim were not employed to communicate with the nether regions, but they were a mantic device. 49Those whom Homer calls the 87ytuoEpyol' (Odyssey XVII 382-86); see C. H.
