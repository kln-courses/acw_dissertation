<plain_text><page sequence="1">Culture and Anonymity The Other Voice of Los pasos perdidos Stephen Gingerich Southern University of New York-Buffalo Our use of the word culture betrays an ambiguity that, we might say, belongs to us, to what we call our "culture." On the one hand we use it to refer to a communal unit defined variously by language, customs, politics, to some extent even geography or physiology. On the other hand, we use the word to refer to art, literature, and learning, to what Germans call "das Geistliche," as in Geisteswissenschaften , what we in the United States call the Liberal Arts. This second sense tends to ignore the boundaries of the first: a cultured German has exposure to more or less the same things as a cultured Spaniard or a cultured American. That this access differs in selection and judgment according to the country or even the region alerts us to the ten- sion embodied in our usage of the word. One sense excludes through its drawing together of a particular community among other communities and the other sense creates a rift in each community's self-containment, intro- ducing it into what it otherwise excludes and providing entrée for others to intervene in it. One can speak, for example, of a French reception of Faulkner, or of the German encounter with Greece. "Cultures" are concerned with their own internal coherence while "culture" lets in and addresses what lies • 229</page><page sequence="2">230 • Culture and Anonymity outside individual cultures. In a temporal dimension, cultures concern themselves with their own present, where the past is understood as a history from which the present has stepped, and the future is understood as the pro- visional aim of present actions. "Culture" in the other sense hearkens to the past and projects itself into the future, opening the present to what might seem in danger of being lost or to the range of future possibilities. Alejo Carpentieri s novel Los pasos perdidos (aptly translated by Harriet de Onís as The Lost Steps) throws this tension into relief like no other. Its narrator-protagonist describes the modern society in which he moves in the first chapter in terms of a predominance of art and erudition. Practically every scene in the first chapter emphasizes the circulation of immense artis- tic and intellectual currency. The narrator-protagonist s ruminations sug- gest a familiarity with the history of literature, music, and plastic arts going back through the Middle Ages to the Greeks and the Paleolithic; his wife yearns to play Antigone while acting in a successful historical play; his friends, including his French mistress, Mouche, perform, in the narrators words, a kind of "mental gymnastics," a "high cultural acrobacy [alta acroba- cia de la cultura]"1 in which Pythagoreanism shares the stage with the Cabala, Tibetan tantras, the early Heidegger, Mallarmé s Un coup de dès , and the words of Ecclesiastes, to name just a few. At the opposite extreme are the communities the narrator-protagonist encounters deep in the jungle, one an indigenous tribe and the other a set- tlement-dubbed-city, Santa Monica de los Venados. He understands his trip into the jungle as a descent through the ages, back through the colonial period of the Americas and the European Middle Ages, to the inception of human communities. Whether it is a question of traveling through time or not, the narrator perceives a dazzling harmony and coherence in the rela- tionship of these communities to an environment ( medio ambiente) which is at once the setting ( ámbito ) in which their lives take place and, more emphatically, the medium {medio) which defines their individual and com- munal possibilities. "All around me," the narrator says, everyone was busy at their own work in a harmonious concert of duties that were those of a life moving to a primordial rhythm. Those Indians, whom I</page><page sequence="3">Stephen Gingerich • 231 had always seen through more or less imaginary stories [relatos fantasiosos] that situated them at the margins of mans real existence, struck me here, in their own setting [ámbito], in their own surroundings [medio], as absolutely in possession of their culture [absolutamente dueños de su cultura]. (English [E] 173, Spanish [s] 234) The narrators interest lies more in Santa Monica de los Venados, however, where he claims that the same ownership of oneself through ownership of one s culture is possible and put into practice by descendants of Europeans. By taking up the Adelantados terminology of here and there , the narrator suggests that he subscribes to the Adelantados conception of the two terms. According to the Adelantado, the closeness of nature and the simplicity of life created the conditions here- that is, in Santa Monica de los Venados- for fulfilling ones destiny, something that the complexity of the world there prohibits. Upon taking his leave of Santa Monica de los Venados after being spotted by a search plane, the narrator-protagonist anticipates returning to the jungle community and its promise of a life as perfect as a tautology. "I will go and buy the few things I need to live a life as full as that of all the oth- ers here," he tells himself. "All of them, with their hands, their occupation, fulfill a destiny. The hunter hunts, the preacher indoctrinates, the Adelantado governs" (E 236, S 293). In his mind, he, the composer, will com- pose in this place, since he does not yet realize that writing music is essen- tially different from hunting, indoctrinating, or governing. The only inkling he has of an artistic difference at this moment is the thought that he will never hear his work performed. He skirts the issue by turning his work into a visual phenomenon and imagining the sympathetic viewer, not listener: "What was done did not finish being done so long as another did not see it. But it sufficed for one person to see it for it the thing to be, and for the thing to become a true creation by virtue of a mere word from an Adam in the act of naming" (E 237, S 293-94). The work of art is nameless in anticipation of the viewer, who confers on it its being (ser), making it into a "true creation" and a definite existent. The narrator is on the way to an insight about art which he will never articulate, unless we credit the obscurity of this utterance with an articulation of the impossible.</page><page sequence="4">232 # Culture and Anonymity The passage juxtaposes not only the two words for "to be," ser and estar ; but the adjectival and verbal senses of the participle (lo hecho and está hecho) and various senses of the subjunctive mood to render an untrans- latable account of the works suspension between artist and viewer, creator and audience or viewer. The above translation is a completely new rendi- tion of the following: Lo hecho no acababa de estar hecho mientras otro no lo mirara. Pero bastaba que uno solo mirara para que la cosa fuera , y se hiciera creación verdadera por la mera palabra de un Adán nombrando.2 Notably, the narrator-protagonist does not say, as the English translation has it, that his work must have been seen in order to exist but that his work must be seen, that it was not finished "so long as another did not look at it," as opposed to "so long as another had not seen it," [mientras no lo hubiera visto.] It is the moment of encounter with the viewer that renders the work true, that gives it being, curiously, in a process referred to as nam- ing. But there is no insistence that this moment fixes the work once and for all in being. Rather, the work without a viewer has the status of the "rebel plants" shown the narrator by the friar a few weeks earlier, plants which, the narrator says, were "unknown [ignoradas] because they were never named" (E 206, S 266). These plants, says the friar, "are the plants which have fled from man since the beginning, . . . which refused to serve him as food, which crossed rivers, scaled mountains, leaped the deserts for thou- sands and thousands of years, to hide here, in the last valleys of prehistory" (E 205, S 265). The narrator-protagonist does not entertain the thought of how what he regards as culture resembles the plants that have, above all, resisted cultivation, domestication. Such a line of thinking would threaten, at least, to reveal that art tends to flee its relation to human society and retreat into namelessness, that it is perhaps only art when engaged in such a flight. As we will see, he resembles the sort of reader who - in spite of or because of erudition and training in methods of analysis - persists in regarding the work as the cultural phenomenon that remains after the flight of the work. "Art" ceases to name the movement that guarantees - as much as any movement can - its own autonomy and becomes one of many customs, tools, and artifacts which are subordinate to the central organiz- ing function of culture.</page><page sequence="5">Stephen Gingerich • 233 We might be tempted to argue that, after all, our culture defines art as a communal and historically determined object, and in so doing we broaden the net to speak of Western culture or the world culture in which such a definition holds. This obscures the fact that culture already operates by sub- ordinating phenomena to a particular conceptuality. We might even say, recalling that Hegel's phenomenology presents the Bildung, the culture, of spirit by means of the concept, that subordination takes place by way of con- ceptuality in general. The problem is not that such a conception is false but that its persuasiveness and comprehensiveness may blind us from art and literatures more fundamental role in ensuring a vibrant communal and cre- ative existence for us by virtue of arts refusal to give itself over entirely to conceptual analysis. Once again, it is a problem of the tension between an intellectual or artistic culture and the cultures that seem to contain it in one form or another. In contrast to the domestication of works of art, the thinking that would associate art with the "rebel plants' would at least make us think twice, or more, before ascribing primarily cultural significance to works of art, even to Los pasos perdidos , a novel in which this problem manifests itself. The anonymity of the narrator-protagonist indicates that the novel aligns itself with a studied namelessness which would assert its autonomy from culture. His primary concern, however, is with his own relationship to communities, and on the most apparent level of the text, The Lost Steps offers a standard tale of reconciliation between the two kinds of culture. Art, literature, and thinking are always, in this story, products of a particular community; cul- ture in the more limited (or even elitist) sense bears an organic relation to culture in the broad sense. The root of the word "culture" encourages this idea of an organic relation between the soil of the community and the works that blossom and bear fruit on its surface.3 1 don't intend to simply expound Carpentier s theory of culture or of the relationship of community to litera- ture by reading The Lost Steps. A theory doubtless exists that would take up the problems I have raised and reaffirm the belonging of artist to culture. In addition to writing eight novels and a handful of short stories, Carpentier was a prolific journalist and, along with his newspaper and magazine work, he played what might be considered a more practical role in the cultures he</page><page sequence="6">234 • Culture and Anonymity inhabited: political activist in Cuba before his exile to France in 1928; public- ity work in Paris and, later, in Caracas; popular histories of shoes and of Cuban music; university teaching (history of music and of culture); and, for the last thirty years of his life, cultural attaché for the Castro government.4 As a sign of this role we may consider the name of the archive begun with his personal papers in La Habana: Centro de Promoción Cultural Alejo Carpentier. Roberto González Echevarría, the most authoritative and resourceful interpreter of Carpentieri work, writes of Carpentier that "the essence of his spiritual and artistic life" was his "attempt to define the self cul- turally."5 This process of self definition coincides, for Carpentier- who never hesitated to call lo latinoamericano "lo nuestro" [what is ours]- with the investigation and definition of Latin America. It might be interesting, then, to look and see what results such an attempt yielded and, perhaps especially, what those results had to do with his commitment to a politics pursued in the promising yet already, in the 1950s, preemptive name of communism. González Echevarría begins this project in his 1977 book Alejo Carpen- tier : The Pilgrim at Home. In it, González Echevarría identifies two theoret- ical pronouncements which seem to have represented Carpentier most widely, "the marvelous real" and "the baroque."6 The first comes from the prologue of El reino de este mundo (translated as The Kingdom of this World) and was subsequently published as " De lo real maravilloso ' [Of the Mar- velous Real] in the book of essays Tientos y diferencias [Attempts and Differences].7 Carpentier rejects the tendency of Latin American artists to follow European trends, claiming that European culture is as foreign to America as a tropical climate is to Europeans. He says that surrealism attempted to interject into reality a world of marvels, and he fears that American artists will, likewise, take on this task of reinventing the world. But the American hemisphere has a reality incomparable to that of Europe, he asserts. To achieve surrealisms goals in America, therefore, one need only attend to what is real, to the "marvelous real" accessible in the jungles, arch- ipelagos, mountains, and savannas of the New World.8 Nearly twenty years later, in "La problemática de la actual novela latinoamericana " [The Proble- matics of the Current Latin American Novel] Carpentier seems to have changed his position. The role of the artist has shifted from its focus on the</page><page sequence="7">Stephen Gingerich # 235 natural world to the cities. Rejecting the naturalist tendencies as European examples, Carpentier says that Latin American novelists need to show the universality [lo universal ] in Latin American culture, not by attaining to a European conception of universality but by asserting its complete autonomy from Europe. With an irony that could not have escaped him, Carpentier recommends that Latin American culture refuse to assert anything but itself, thereby achieving the autonomy that it admires in a Europe that has long since asserted its autonomy from Asia, Africa, and, when the time came, the Americas. In order to maintain some particularity for Latin America, he claims that it is characterized not by the indigenous "marvelous reality" but by "the baroque," a concept borrowed from Europe and defined as the lack of any definable style at all.9 González Echevarrías interpretation of these two positions organizes his book on Carpentier, which attempts a comprehensive interpretation of the oeuvre and which is organized biographically, in spite of some misgivings about this paradigm. Carpentier s first theoretical position, according to González Echevarría, corresponds to the prologue and work before 1953, most notably The Kingdom of this World and " Viaje a la semilla ' [ Voyage to the Seed]. This work, says González Echevarría, "(hinges) on the metaphor binding history and writing into an uninterrupted continuum, a flow from the same source- nature- lost in the past but subject to recall" (212). It is thus that the story of one man, Ti Noel, can be offered as a métonymie depic- tion of the experience of the Haitian revolution in 1804. Carpentier s final theoretical position, after 1953, "(discards) the myth of a past utopia" when individual experience coincided with cultural experience, when there was authentic experience of nature and community, with "the correlative myth of the future, when all versions of history will at last be one" (212). Carpentier goes from believing, then, in a past unity of individual and communal expe- rience to believing in a future one. Rather than calling attention to past rev- olutions or the unity of historical (past) events, his writing posits a unity in a future on the other side of revolution. Everything turns on The Lost Steps. This novel does not inaugurate a second phase but embodies the crisis that the conception of unity of the first undergoes. What González Echevarría calls The Lost Steps "narrative of return" "shows . . . that no such unity exists,</page><page sequence="8">236 • Culture and Anonymity that writing unveils not the truth, nor the true origins, but a series of repeated gestures and renewed beginnings" (212). In other words, the novel shows that the origins of culture are not , in fact, accessible by a process of recall. Writing- by which González Echevarría refers to the narrator s com- posing of the Threnody and the narrators retelling of his journey into the jungle - repeats the origins when it purports to have coincided with them. If this is what The Lost Steps shows, I would have little to do but demon- strate again González Echevarrías thesis. My interest lies in articulating pre- cisely this problem of the standard thinking of culture : art never simply reinforces or represents the social nexus in or out of which it invariably springs. The "individual" and art always exceed the boundaries and possi- bilities (vast though they may be) of culture. González Echevarría seems to share these concerns. In the prologue to his book he clearly indicates that the essay on The Lost Steps , called "The Parting of the Waters," is the heart of his book, and a constant motif of The Pilgrim at Home is Carpentiers self- delusion (González Echevarría calls it "self-mystification"), which culmi- nates in over twenty years of work based on dubious principles. González Echevarría implies, as we may suspect, that the threat The Lost Steps poses to the operative ideology of before 1953 holds for after 1953 as well. He called his book a "post-Carpenterian reflection" in the mid-seventies, while Carpentier was still quite active intellectually. (One can't help suspecting another more mundane reservation on the part of González Echevarría, himself a Cuban exile.) For González Echevarría, The Lost Steps is Carpentiers moment of greatest insight, but also so brief an insight that it must be referred to as a moment of genesis (as the title of the chapter implies, referring to the waters preceding creation in the book of Genesis ), a transition with no precise location of its own. It is not even a step from the one phase to the next, unless it is the stepping of the step, lost between the point of departure and the destination. Yet when this insight gets articulated as a demonstration it loses much of its radicality. Rather than conceiving of the novel as the possibility of put- ting into play, and of suspending certain issues having to do with cultural history, identity, and production, the novel becomes a concrete statement on these issues. As a result, the novel becomes one more document in a sort of</page><page sequence="9">Stephen Gingerich • 237 cultural history. The progression is a classical dialectic. First Carpentier threatens unified notions of culture, identity, and meaning by writing a novel that presents reality and selfhood as irreparably fragmented. Then, however, the notions of reality and selfhood regain some kind of unity under a particular conception of fragmentation. Such a conception can then be said to characterize one particular reality (Latin American culture) and one particular self (Carpentier). This progression is perceptible even within The Pilgrim at Home if we notice González Echevarrías increasing tendency in the final chapter to associate a certain Carpentier with the nameless narra- tor-protagonist of The Lost Steps. As González Echevarría is the first to emphasize, however, the narrator both is and is not Carpentier. If he represents the position Carpentier had taken up in the prologue to his previous novel, he also finds himself reject- ing that conception at the end of the novel. Such a rejection, it seems, would have to pertain to Carpentier as well, even though he never publicly renounces the concept of the marvelous real (as he rejected the Afro- Caribbean mysticism of his first published novel, Ecue-Yamba-O!). None- theless, this negation certainly has its dialectical recuperation in which the narrator appears a fragmented self, what González Echevarría points to as "a self that appeared not as an ordering or grounding principle but as a set of negative relations" (18). For González Echevarría, at certain moments of his text, this self remains a product of the literary text and still reflects a conception of humanity: "The text of the novel must be seen as shattered, the picture of man as a many sided mirror' (. Prometheus Unbound, Act IV) rather than the harmonious record of a presence that has gained entrance to a privileged world lacking temporal dimensions" (165). Under these cir- cumstances, he says, "the 'I' of the narrative" is merely a product of "lin- guistic convention" (165). In spite of efforts to the contrary, the narrator still constitutes an anthropomorphic unit. González Echevarría says even more emphatically, "The narrator is that space between the T and the 'he and between then and now. . . . This lack of center generates the baroqueness of Carpentier s style . . ." (166). Yet in spite of all the stress on absence and the tension of the in-between, there remains the assertion that style reflects self and self reflects culture.10</page><page sequence="10">238 • Culture and Anonymity Perhaps we can get a fresher sense of the problematic nature of the nar- rators identity by considering his name, or rather, his namelessness. At one point, the narrator seems almost to tease the readers, saying "today, for the first time, Rosario has called me by my name, repeating it again and again, as though its syllables had to be molded anew, and in her mouth it has taken on a sonority so singular, so unexpected, that I feel healed by the word I know best [ensalmado por la palabra que más conozco] when I hear it as new as if it had just been created" (E 157, S 216).11 In spite of such an insis- tence on the value of the name for the identity of the narrator, at no point is this name revealed. Let us observe that the narrator assumes that the proper name is a word. But proper names are in fact the most curious of words; they do indeed name a group of things, as "ceiba" and "olive" name millions of individual trees. Yet what unites those people with the same proper name has nothing to do with any characteristics except, perhaps (and this is not always the case) language, gender, and culture (and in some cultures, reli- gion). Indeed, The Lost Steps reminds us of this connection, since nearly all the names establish or reinforce the characters' belonging to specific cul- tures: Ruth to North America, Rosario, Fray Pedro, and the Adelantado to Latin America, Mouche to France, Montsalvatje to Catalonia, Yannes to Greece. It is also striking that the narrator knows his name in the sense of conocer as opposed to saber ; which is to say he claims familiarity with his name, more familiarity than with any other word. Is he saying that he is acquainted with the sounds of the word, with its connotations, its history? Another passage might help us clarify this silence. Section XI, in which the narrator is about to embark on the river voyage, begins, " Silence is a word belonging to my vocabulary [Silencio es palabra de mi vocabulario ]" (E 109, S 173). We will have to read on to see how he means this statement, whether, as the italicizing of "silence" implies, to say that he often employs the word "silence," or whether he means to say that he deliberately inserts gaps in his speech, gaps which signify as words do. Having worked with music, I have used it [la he usado] more than men in other professions. I know how one can speculate with silence, measure it, put it in a frame [se le mide y encuadra]. But now, seated on this rock, I live the</page><page sequence="11">Stephen Gingerich • 239 silence [vivo el silencio], a silence come from so far off and thick with so many silences that in it the word would take on the thunder of creation [en él cobraría la palabra un fragor de creación] (E 109, S 173). This sounds like the commonplace assertion, after the jazz experimentation of the fifties and sixties, that one must learn to hear the silences as well as the notes. Here silence is evoked as a word, first, and referred to a second time as a word, when the narrator says "I have used it," using the feminine direct object "/a." But in the next sentence the narrator commits a leísmo (a Spanish dialectal phenomenon in which the gender neutral indirect object pronoun replaces a gender-specific direct object pronoun), obscuring the gender of a pronoun- cómo se le mide y encuadra- and making it impossi- ble to tell whether he is referring to the feminine palabra or the masculine silencio. Finally, silence is no longer a word but, as much as it can be, itself; it is referred to using the masculine pronoun él. The narrator slips gradually from speaking of familiarity with a word to speaking of the thing, in this case silence, which cannot be evoked in speech without also being banished. Silence can in fact be measured, set off, and "put in a frame," but it can never be summoned in the complete absence of a word, something foreign to itself, something in relation to which it is a hiatus. "I live silence" attempts to evoke this element by an appeal to a material circumstance, sitting on a rock, like a rock, soundless. He invokes a difference between the mediacy of using silence and the immediacy of living silence. The imagined interruption of this silence, however, is not simply negative; rather, "the word would take on the thunder of creation." It is not even very clear whether the narrator is not imagining its ironic interruption with the very word "silence!" since la palabra could be understood (as Onis does in her translation) as "a word" or "words in general," in addition to the definite word under discussion. Perhaps this easy slide from word to thing governs the previously dis- cussed passage as well. The narrator-protagonist s knowledge of his name refers to his knowledge of himself, his familiarity or acquaintance with him- self. And perhaps his withholding of his name is the very possibility of retain- ing something of the vitality and mystery associated with art as that which always requires being named afresh. A proper name would obscure this need</page><page sequence="12">240 • Culture and Anonymity by camouflaging the absence that an encounter with the work always involves, and it does so by providing a link to culture and gender, as in the case of the novels other characters. The provisional names we give, "narra- tor-protagonist," for example, may accomplish this same kind of diversion, but as we have been seeing, the evocation of some kind of pure silence of open possibilities cannot be made without involving its opposite, here an abstract term that situates the tale within a genre and a history. Such an apparent unity tends also to obscure the disunity- or the frag- ile unity- of the narration, as does Harriet de Onís's preference for the English narrative convention of the narrative past tense in her translation. Though in the guise of an autobiographical narrative, the text of The Lost Steps lacks, with two exceptions, the signs of a retrospective gaze, so that it gives the impression of being 39 steps forward. The exceptions, significantly, involve the narrators fear of being killed by sniper fire in the Latin American Capital and the Adelantados secret, the utopia of Santa María de los Venados. The end of life and the beginning of a supposedly pure life. In the first case, the existence of the scene on the page depends on the mortally frightened narrators survival (E 62-63, S 128-129). In the second, the narra- tor deliberately withholds what he calls "the Adelantados secret" (E 179, S 241) for two whole sections before revealing it at the beginning of Chapter Five. Combined with the narrator s apparent lack of paper, these details for- bid us from considering the narration a simple travelogue. Yet the lack of retrospective gaze would seem to encourage this conception and the switch- ing of the form of the verb from the narrative past to the narrative present also gives the impression of immediacy. In The Lost Steps , the switch to the narrative present not only has this dramatic effect, but it underscores the passage of time and the differences in identity of the narrator from one moment to the next. It is true that Spanish narrative conventions include a narrative present, but in the case of the above passage, Harriet de Oníss desire to translate not only the language but the degree of adherence to a narrative tradition creates a retrospective gaze which does not belong in a book whose significance hinges on the repeated attempts by the narrator to invest himself with qualities of pure, nameless immediacy. What I have translated literally above - "But now, seated on this rock, I live the silence</page><page sequence="13">Stephen Ginger ich # 241 [vivo el silencio ], a silence come from so far off"- Onís renders, "But then, sitting on that rock, I was living silence: a silence that came from so far off" (E 109).12 We have arrived at a point at which the narrator seems to be rejecting his culture - his formación or Bildung - to be ready for an encounter with a more elemental culture. How is it, then, that The Lost Steps presents a clas- sic tale of reconciliation between the cultured protagonist and an experi- ence of culture that seems inaccessible to him? We first of all need to emphasize that his times are not only cosmopolitan, "cultured" times, but they are characterized from the start by fragmentation and loss of a vital connection with the past. Ruths play is a perfect example of erudition with- out connection to life. The set is described as a depiction of a Southern plan- tation house with a stone portal that has "the same hollow ring under (his) feet [pasos]" (E 3, S 67). The works artificial unity and its popular success give it an advantage over the real world, "slowly annihilating [ aniquilando ] its interpreters" (E 5, S 69), "effacing" them, as de Onís's translation has it, causing them to become more and more indistinguishable from the roles they play. The narrator represents this fragmentation and discontinuity as well. His recollections inform us that his childhood was spent in someplace resembling Havana (but not named) and that he worked in France before moving to the city where we find him in the first chapter, which resembles New York but is likewise not named. The trip to Latin America is a return to the simpler, more unified life of his infancy, primarily via "the language of (his) infancy," as he repeatedly calls Spanish (E 40, S 108), associating it, lit- erally, with a time without speech, in-fans. At the time of the first chapter, he finds himself lost in composing music for purposes that substitute the con- cern for integrity for satisfaction of a commercial rather than cultural end (assuming there is such a difference). As he puts it, after a screening of the film project (written "by a young poet in collaboration with an oceanogra- pher") which had occupied him for the three months, "all that grueling [encarnizado] effort, those pretensions to good taste, that technical skill, choice, and co-ordination of my collaborators and assistants, had given birth to, when all was said and done, was a publicity job ordered from the studio for which I worked by a Fisheries Association engaged in a ferocious battle</page><page sequence="14">242 # Culture and Anonymity with a chain of cooperatives' (E 27, S 94). His fellow artists assure him that this is how it should be, that even "the mosaics of Ravena were nothing but advertising" (E 28, S 95). This is one of modernity's peculiarities. It has invented the concept of culture but also seems deprived of that unity which defines culture.13 In modernity and especially in the history of the Americas, cultures mix to such an extent that they begin to fracture. They are experienced, then, as a fall from an original state of completeness, wholeness, and unity. This initial state could be an idealization of an earlier community such as Classical Greece, pre-Reformation Christendom, or precolonial Europe, or it could be a more abstract purity of intention, such as is often ascribed to the first set- tlers of the New World or the framers of the United States Constitution, as if purity of intention were the issue, rather than the particularities of that intention, which has seldom been anything but scandalous. The most com- monly evoked exemplification of the dangers of this modern desire for purification mixed with nostalgia for a pure origin is, of course, the holo- caust and Aryan nationalism (which set the scene for The Lost Steps longest flashback). But we can see something of the same conceptuality at work in English First movements and any policies, liberal or conservative, which appeal to the normative desire for cultural unity imagined in a future or past. In a time when cultural disunity or, at least, grave threats to cultural unity, are a given, the question arises whether this dislocation creates art, lit- erature, and thinking of dislocation and fragmentation, or whether the result is no art at all. The end of The Lost Steps leaves us equally unsure of whether modern art is art which reflects modernity or rather a modern document of the dis- appearance of art. The narrators determination to return to the source of artistic inspiration is, no doubt, a very modern one made possible only by ethnology and by the modern, nihilistic feeling of lack. It is a voyage through time, such as the one the narrator describes at the end of the first chapter, when viewing artworks in the college of the curator who commissions his trip. "An iron buckle, a crown bristling with hammered points, carried me back to Merovingian Europe, deep jungles, lands without roads," he recalls there, for example, in a mode indistinguishable from his later transport to</page><page sequence="15">Stephen Gingerich • 243 the Middle Ages or Paleolithic Era (E 35, S 101). But his trip, in the most recent case, also involves a literal, spatial movement. The architecture of the Latin American capital evokes the age of his great-grandmother; a traveling musician in Los Altos recalls a Renaissance troubadour; the Valley of the Flames hellish imagery recalls the Middle Ages; the funeral of Rosarios father in Puerto Anunciación recalls Greek choruses, and the tribe where he finds the musical instruments sets the Paleolithic Era before him. We wit- ness the narrators claim to a more basic consciousness as he backs down the ladder of the ages. He sums this up at the end of the novel: I had traveled through the ages; I had passed through the bodies and the times of the bodies There the year in which we live can be forgotten, and they lie who say man cannot escape his epoch. The Stone Age, like the Middle Ages, is still within our reach. The gloomy mansions of romanticism, with its doomed loves, are still open. (E 277-78, S 329) After this regression he feels he has reached a sort of Garden of Eden in Santa Monica de los Venados, where he says "there is no edenic affectation [no hay alarde, no hay fingimiento edénico ]" (E 197; S 258). Already we can sense a tension here, however, in the curiously negative mode of his descrip- tion. Eden is primarily that place without pretension or falsehood, where all is exposed without shame or even consciousness of its absence. Yet the nar- rator associates it more with the cultures that speak of it using the name "Eden," as if Eden always already contained the pretense to innocence, never innocence itself. At the source of what is human, when stripped of all the ostentation of modernity, the narrator conceives an artwork, a musical com- position he calls the Threnody This work grows out of the experience of ori- gins and of origins conceived in terms of a purity, primitiveness, and unity with nature: "The Threnody was inside me before, but its seed was resown and began to grow in the night of the Paleolithic" (E 216, S 275). And yet, for the narrator, being an artist makes his pertinence to the modern age inescapable, and if he is to compose music at all, it must be modern music. The previous passage continues:</page><page sequence="16">244 • Culture and Anonymity But none of this was for me, because the only human race to which it is for- bidden to sever the bonds of time is the race of those who create art, and who not only must move ahead of the immediate yesterday, represented by tan- gible testimony, but must anticipate the song and the form of others who will follow them, creating new tangible testimony with full awareness of what has been done up to the moment (E 278, S 329-330). If we were to look at the description of the work he composed in the jungle, at the state of Edenic purity, we would see that he is making a very modern work, one which attempts to follow music in its development from a single note to melody, harmony and counterpoint. Access to the purity of the ori- gins of culture appears to be a prerequisite to creating the "tangible testi- mony" of the times. The narrator loses track of time during his adventure, as is shown in the gradual disappearance of dates at the heading of the sec- tions into which the tale is divided. Yet at the end, he has regained his aware- ness of time with a vengeance: time is the determining factor in his actions. He is forbidden to return to the jungle, he says, by a racial imperative, sug- gesting that his artistry is physiological rather than willful. He fails to address, however, whether his fate is to return to the commercial work he had been doing before or whether this experience created the inspiration for an authentic assumption of his role as an artist. The line on the final page, "Today Sisyphus s vacation came to an end [hoy terminaron las vacaciones de Sisifo]" (E 278, S 330), suggests that he plans to return to the routine to which he had been accustomed before meeting the curator. The Lost Steps doesn't solve the modern dilemma with respect to art. It doesn't tell us that modern art is advertising nor that there is no modern art. And yet by repre- senting the relationship of the novel to this problem it seems to come down on the side of the former assertion. But the novel does not end with the pronouncement of the end of Sisyphus s holiday, a statement that returns to a narrative past as if to rein- state and, appropriately, put into place the narrators past experiences. The final paragraph returns to the present and evokes an image of the river as the waters recede, revealing the sign that could guide him back to Santa Monica de los Venados. The image reminds us that the positing of the</page><page sequence="17">Stephen Gingerich • 245 theoretical impossibility of a return has the taint of rationalization. The nar- rator-protagonist has heard from Yannes, the Greek diamond hunter, that Rosario married Marcos, the son of the Adelantado. This knowledge touches off a wave of paradoxical speculation about the way the inhabitants of Santa Monica de los Venados regarded him. On the one hand, he says that "the people of those far off places have never believed in me" (E 276, S 328). His preoccupation with writing music roused their suspicions, since it "fulfilled no useful purpose [no respondía a necesidad alguna ] (E 277, S 329). For him, this lack of faith translates into a belief in the inevitability of his departure, although nothing in their previous behavior toward him had implied this. Also, his work on the Threnody had coincided with the arrival of the rains, during which, he says, the inhabitants of the so-called city "suffered enor- mous boredom" (E 229, S 286). Moreover, he observes that "those who live here do not do so out of any intellectual conviction; they simply think that this, and not the other, is the good life. They prefer this present to the pres- ent of the makers of the Apocalypse" (E 277, S 329). The narrator wants to be able to attribute to the inhabitants of Santa Monica de los Venados both the pristine innocence of the origins and an intuition of the inferiority of the world from which he came. He continues, describing the way he imagines that they must think of him: "The one who makes too much of an effort to understand ... is vulnerable, because certain forces of the world he has left behind continue to operate in him" (E 277, S 329). On some level, then, he already recognizes that his vision of Santa Monica de los Venados as a com- munity that has complete mastery over itself and its relation to the world also contains an element of deception and dissimulation such as he associ- ates with the modern world. For without this, he either would not have been brought there or else he would have been sent away. His contention that his attachment to the culture of his own Bildung is inescapable must hence be viewed with some suspicion. But the narrator- protagonist is very consistent in his thinking, and the case he makes- his interpretation of his own experience - is so compelling that we could simply stop and regard the narrator-protagonist as the upholder of traditional aes- thetic assumptions. His ideas, after all, are not merely simplistic or naive. The idea of returning is something that he developed - as he tells us</page><page sequence="18">246 • Culture and Anonymity himself- by way of intensive reflection and study, including the histories of music, art, and literature. The erudition of his account and its consistency surely have something to do with the tendency, even after González Echevarría, to accept the premises of his narrative as Carpentieri s own, something which he has not discouraged. It might thus be difficult to imag- ine how one might begin to introduce a difference between what the narra- tor says and what The Lost Steps says. This is a matter of finding what the novel indicates without the narrator s saying it, of identifying what is know- able on the basis of the narration though there is no sign that it is known, no sign in the novel or in the author s theoretical pronouncements about the novel and his work in general. It will probably be no surprise that the clearest breech between the nar- rator and some other voice involves a woman. The narrator s association with Rosario is instrumental, for him, in attaining a primitive state of unity between culture and nature and between himself and culture. She is the Eve to his Adam in that Eden which is not yet the Eden viewed post lapsus. It is what he understands from the first day as her exteriority to time that he wishes to access and claims (until the final chapter) to achieve. In the inn on the first night he knows her, he says, "her attire was of no period, no time [estaba vestida fuera de época , fuera de tiempo ]" (E 83, S 148). At the begin- ning of the novel he admits his "unremitting obsession with time," but after he has traveled deeper into the jungle he is able to say, "now that time does not concern me" (E 181, S 242). In the first chapter, after announcing his emptiness to the curator, he reflects on "how hard it is to become a man again when one has ceased to be a man ' (E 22, S 86). Rosario exists, for him, in a state of presence to self as perfect as a tautology: "I, too, love her . . . had been compelled to establish a new scale of values to make it possible for a man of my education {formación ] to establish bonds with a woman who was all woman and nothing but woman" (E 199, S 259-60). This self-definition, also, creates a kind of cultural authority in her: "here they were the ones who knew," the narrator protagonist asserts. "To be contrary," he says something to Mouche which he will come to believe later: that "the living memory of certain myths which indicated the presence of a culture more estimable and valid, perhaps, than that which we (he and Mouche) had left behind [la que se nos había quedado allá]" (E 123, S 187).</page><page sequence="19">Stephen Gingerich • 247 This understanding of Rosario as a kind of pristine innocent clearly feeds on the narrator s conception of his voyage as a trip through the ages of the West (in its pretensions to universality, too) and through his own life. When he and Rosario consummate their relationship, he is provoked by the smells which remind him (or so he says) of his first love, Maria del Carmen (E 151, S 211-12). The latter is an interrupted relationship, though; so in a sense the successful union with Rosario brings him to the source and starts him on a more natural course from there. In this scene we can get a whiff of the problem, in a very innocent form. While the plants the narrator says fall upon him and Rosario are camphor, sandalwood, and saffron, the narrator tells that the basket in which he held Maria del Carmen was near the plot where his father planted mint and basil. Though he tells us the smells are the same, the information he gives us suggests his story ignores the difference so that his actions conform to the sentiments which make his tale adhere to the pattern he believes in. He seems to think his liaison with Rosario can be authorized by its connection to his return to the innocence of childhood, and, as a result, he makes a case involving a correlation between smells that no gardener or herbalist would accept. Much less suspect, by contrast, is the correlation between smells after this scene, when the narrator-protagonist is on the ship Manati and smells "a sweating negress pounding garlic," alfalfa, and rutting bulls. The smells remind him of "the back yard of (his) child- hood," where there was "a sweating negress pounding garlic," cattle, and the "willow basket . . . which smelled like alfalfa" (E 111-12, S 176). Rosario, as a woman and as a character receives fairly rough treatment. Though the narrator holds her in the highest esteem according to his ideol- ogy, she could as easily appear stupid as innocent. It is only in the narrators extreme adherence to prejudices regarding the unity and lineage of culture that she could be construed as something like a noble savage. While she is reading on the bus, for example, the narrator tells of interrupting Rosarios reading of The Story of Genevieve of Brabant with the comment, "Those are tales of other days" (E 100, S 163). When she replies that "what books say is the truth," he conjectures that "for (Rosario) Genevièves history was very probably something real [actual - which has a temporal as well as ontologi- cal sense], something that was happening in a real country as she read it. The past eludes the grasp of those ignorant of the trappings, the settings, the</page><page sequence="20">248 • Culture and Anonymity props of history" (E 100, S 163). This seems an exaggeration of Rosarios state- ment, but Rosario may have been right in other ways. The legend of Genevieve of Brabant tells how a wife is falsely accused by a rejected suitor of cuckold- ing her husband. The husband believes the other man rather than his wife. Similiarly, when Yannes tells the narrator-protagonist, at the end of the book, that Rosario has married Marcos in Santa Monica de los Venados (whose name is reminiscent of the legend, according to which Genevieve was cared for by a roe deer), the narrator also shows his tendency to believe another man rather than his mate (who, as we shall recall, had insisted on her oppo- sition to marriage in general). Strangely, the popular book telling Saint Genevieve's story fits the narrators characterization of Rosario: L'Innocence reconnue , ou, la vie de Geneviève de Brabant.14 The nature of Rosarios inno- cence, psychological or legal, cannot be recognized in The Lost Steps. Elsewhere, the narrator reflects upon the difference separating them, attributing to Rosario a whole culture and to himself another kind of cul- ture, education: "I knew that an entire culture [toda una cultura - the same phrase he uses to describe Rosario as toda una mujer ] with its deformations and taboos, separated me from that forehead behind which there was prob- ably not the haziest notion of the fact that the earth was round or of the position of the different countries on the map" (E 107, S 171). We can see here this ambivalence toward what he perceives as her authentic cultural exis- tence: to the narrator belongs education, to Rosario prejudices and a certain, albeit feckless, ignorance. But in spite of what the narrator says, it is not impossible to qualify how he interprets Rosario as implausible, even merely symptomatic of his insis- tent belief in the nature of his voyage. In Chapter Five, when the protagonist and Rosario are in Santa Monica de los Venados, there are several clear indi- cations that the narrator is deceiving himself about Rosario. First of all, when the protagonist begins to worry that he must return "there" to deliver the primitive musical instruments he has been sent to collect, it is Rosario who, in order to prevent his leaving, points out the obvious possibility of sending them by mail (E 202, S 262). In the scene that most strongly casts doubt on the protagonist s belief that Rosario belongs to an ancient epoch or to no epoch at all, Rosario rejects his proposal of marriage for what sound</page><page sequence="21">Stephen Gingerich • 249 like very contemporary reasons: "According to her, marriage, the legal bond, deprives the woman of all her defenses against the man. The arm she always has at her disposal when her companion goes astray is the ability to leave him whenever she likes: he has no rights over her. ... To marry is to come under laws drawn up by men and not by women." And the narrator responds: "I must confess that the shrewd peasant logic of this concept left me speech- less. In her dealings with life, it is clear that Your woman [tu mujer ; your wife] moves in a world of ideals, customs, precepts that are not mine" (E 226, S 283-84). Although they may not belong to the narrator, they hardly con- stitute "peasant logic"! In order not to stray from his determination to inter- pret her in terms of another age, he is able to remain in mere disagreement, ignoring the evidence he presents that Rosario is a feminist of sorts and not entirely the solicitous woman he describes, "who serves' the man in the noblest sense of the word" (E 154, S 213). Once this distance is clear between the data, as it were, and the inter- pretation the narrator gives, everything must be put in suspension. The book can no longer be simply regarded as a mise en scène of Carpentier s theoretical statements or personal beliefs. It is even hard to remain fixed to González Echevarrías statement that the book dramatizes not the solution but the posing of theoretical questions about individual and cultural iden- tity (19). For how would we distinguish the narrators prejudices from the author s, and more seriously, the authors ignorance from his characters? Moreover, how would we distinguish cultural from personal bias? Would it be possible for us to set off the implicit sexism and racism of the narrator s voice in order to attribute to Carpentier and to his culture, in any sense, the signs of resistance to these forms of bigotry? Once the possibility of this distance appears, all kinds of things in the novel begin to tremble. Though the narrator-protagonist considers the abo- riginal people "absolute possessors [ dueños ] of their culture" (E 173, S 234), he indicates indirectly that their self-sufficiency is not without its rifts or play. He barters in order to obtain the primitive instruments he has been sent to seek, yet the absoluteness of their self-possession cannot be absolute if it allows for the intervention of outsiders and the introduction of foreign elements. The only "absolute proprietors of their culture" would be the</page><page sequence="22">250 • Culture and Anonymity "perverse, bloodthirsty Indians' to whom Fray Pedro makes reference in conversation with the narrator-protagonist. They accept no intervention from the outside, representing for us, though with requisite vagueness, what the dream of authentic cultural unity would mean: not Santa Monica de los Venados but the violent self-containment of a tribe which, in the end, bru- tally murders the friar for attempting to approach them (E 265, S 319). The first city, Santa Monica de los Venados, is little more than a muddy clearing in the jungle which has been mapped out into a main street, a square, and a cathedral. The narrator doesn't seem to notice that its inhabitants are made up of Indians governed by the two white men, the Adelantado and his son, the mayor (whose position would be redundant in any event, since the town coincides with the territory governed). Nor does he see much wrong with the Adelantados attitude toward the Indians (or go through the sort of trans- formation that characterizes Huck Finn, whose similar statement is well known): "The Indians were Indians, and though it seemed odd, I had accepted the strange distinction established by the Adelantado, who, with- out intending the least disdain, said with complete naturalness when recounting his adventures: 'We were three men and twelve Indians'" (E 159, S 221). If he is "disconcerted" at first by the modesty of the new "city," at the end of the novel he unambiguously grants the Adelantado all that the latter claims: "coexistence with marvels, the founding of cities, the liberty encoun- tered among the Inventors of Callings of the soil of Enoch were realities whose grandeur was perhaps not made for my exiguous contrapuntalist per- sona." (E 277, S 329). Most striking is the narrator s forsaking of his Threnody at the end by resigning himself to abandoning it, after having left it in Santa Monica de los Venados in anticipation of his return. On the one hand, it appears to possess inestimable value, since it motivates him to risk what he perceives as a pris- tine state of existence whose only fault is the lack of writing paper. On the other hand, it can be consigned to oblivion on the assumption that he will not be capable of finishing it, even though he asserts at one point that this would be only a matter of revising a first draft. The moment of this affirma- tion would be worth examining in relation to the verb tenses and the frac- tured temporality of the narrative. The narrator says, or writes (an ambiguity</page><page sequence="23">Stephen Gingerich • 251 which would also be worth contemplating), "Cuando me duerma esta noche , los primeros estados del Treno habrán llenado todo el Cuaderno de . . . Perteniciente a . . (S 280). The work is spoken of in the future perfect tense, unlike the English translation: "When I finally went to bed, the first draft of the Threnody had filled the entire Notebook . . . Property of. . (E 221). Once again the narrator reminds us that we don't know his name, and a few pages later he also unwittingly seems to show that he had not in fact achieved a first draft, since he is still beginning work on certain sections (E 224, S 283). On some level, it seems to have occurred to the narrator that the theoretical description of the work and its realization are two completely separate things. He treats his task, however, as if it were a wholly analytical process of "(conceiving) the musical structure of the speech," of achieving "the pas- sage from word to music" (E 219, S 278), claiming as his own technique his interpretation of the shamans making the word music (E 184-85, S 244-45). We might easily suspect that in fact the narrator s composition is of little worth artistically, and in any case, unlike the verses inserted into Joyce's Portrait of the Artist, Faulkner's Mosquitoes , or, to slightly different effect, in Borges's "El Aleph," we could never be in a position to judge. Reciprocally, the narrator no longer has anything at stake, especially since he composed in "a kind of shorthand that only (he) could decipher" (E 221, S 280). By abandon- ing his work to oblivion, he, in effect, replaces the music with the image of the music, the carrying out of the aesthetic ambitions with the description of those ambitions. Again, we cannot really know whether his failure is acci- dental or necessary, whether it reflects a lack of ability on his part or the incompatibility between a modern cultivated man and a culture possessing a natural relation to its world. Considering the willfulness of his depiction of Santa María de los Venados and the community of Indians, we might even add another possibility, one which seems all the more likely now for the nar- rator's failure to acknowledge it. The incompatibility between modern humans and a natural culture might exist not only out of a deficiency on the part of us moderns, but because the natural relation to the world was a fiction created by modernity to begin with. It could easily seem, in any event, that human beings have responded to their fragmentary Bildung by positing a unity either at the origin or the telos of human life.</page><page sequence="24">252 • Culture and Anonymity Nonetheless, the narrator-protagonist s intended return to the modern city from the jungle clearly suggests that he will rejoin the culture which pro- duced him. What of the other voice, however, the one which resonates across the distance between the narrator s representation of his experiences and his interpretation of them? Could we ascribe such a voice to Carpentier, even though its content must be described as negative, since it states anything only in a mode of distance from and suspension of the narrator s con- tentions? More likely we ought to ascribe to Carpentier the position announced in the Borges story of nearly ten years before, "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius": Bioy Casares had come to dinner at my house that evening, and we had lost all track of time in a vast debate over the way one might go about compos- ing a first-person novel whose narrator would omit or distort things and engage in all sorts of contradictions, so that a few of the books readers- a very few- might divine the horrifying or banal truth [que permitieran a unos pocos lectores . . .la adivinación de una realidad atroz o banal].15 The Lost Steps seems to be the taking up of this challenge. It seems to be sim- ply a technical problem, and perhaps, for Borges, the more technical the problem, the better. It is not only a matter of having a temporarily deluded narrator as in "Benito Cereño," Kazuo Ishigurus The Remains of the Day ; or Bioy Casares s own subsequent La invención de Morel nor even a hopelessly self-deluded one as in Ford Madox Ford s The Good Soldier. Such cases pose a challenge to the reader by gradually opening a distance between what the narrator says and what must be the case. But Borges and Bioy Casares speak of a narrator who must both include and omit, both depict and distort, both maintain a semblance of consistency and contradict himself. As a result of this combination, then, many readers will be deluded themselves, especially when their own presuppositions coincide with those of the narrator. Only a few readers would guess at {adivinar, perhaps not even know) another real- ity besides the one spoken of by the first-person narrator, and this reality would be "atrocious or banal." Presented here is an ambiguity, not a choice. These few readers might discern something that, pertaining neither to the</page><page sequence="25">Stephen Ginger ich • 253 author (in whom such machinations are atrocious) nor to the character (whose foibles are banal), nonetheless constitutes something rather than nothing: a reality. We would have to return to Carpentier to consider what such a reality offers beyond the kind of intellectual challenge depicted in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius." In his essay "On the Problematics of the Current Latin American Novel" Carpentier defines the novel s "proper [ cabal ļ function' as "constantly violating the ingenious principle of being a story destined to cause aesthetic pleasure to its readers,' in order to become an instrument of investigation [indagación], a way of knowing [un modo de conocimiento de] men and epochs, a way that exceeds, in many cases, the intentions of its author."16 The novel can sometimes yield knowledge exceeding what the author wanted to impart, Carpentier says, leaving it open whether an author can in fact be comprehensive enough to contain the knowledge embodied in the novel. But the first part of this quotation is less ambiguous, and suggests a slightly more troubling possibility. At some point the novel must fail to give pleasure in order to accede to another possibility, that of becoming "an instrument of investigation" or "a mode of knowledge." This apposition is itself telling, perhaps already indicating an insight akin to that of The Lost Steps. The novel, on the one hand, is an instrument, a means of attaining a kind of knowledge as the reader and the author follow the narrators attempt to renounce modern culture in favor of what his education has taught him to consider a viable alternative. On the other hand, his recounting of this passage and its failure give voice to a "mode of knowledge of men and epochs" that not only exceeds the author but whatever concept of culture might contain it, a voice that in Los pasos perdidos speaks with even less of a name than the anonymous narrator.

Apparently the sense of culture as a "spiritual" pursuit preceded the communal sense, dating from Ciceros conception of philosophy as "cultura animi," cultivation of the soul. Herder was the first to consider culture in the first sense, as the formal principle at the basis of nations, peoples, and societies. "Kultur," Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie, 1976. 4.

González Echevarría is acutely aware of the problem this novel poses, asking himself, in the context of my first quotation in this paragraph, how to write about such an unstable entity as this self. The moments at which he allows the dialectic to reinstate itself, creating a self, Alejo Carpentier, about whom a critical narrative can be written, are not lapses in rigor but the condition of possibility of his illuminating study. 11. For the sake of comparison, here is a similar scene in Faulkner's Pylon (New York:</page><page sequence="27">Stephen Gingerich • 255 Vintage, 1987), 93: "he had no ties except the woman . . . and the incredible name. 'Only the name is right,' the reporter told him. 'Folks don't always believe it at first, but it's correct as far as I know.' - 'But I thought she said her name was - ' and Hagood repeated the name the woman had given. 'Yair,' the reporter said." Other novels, such as Ellison's Invisible Man and Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian have anonymous protagonists, but I know of no others that mark the reader's ignorance as clearly as The Lost Steps. 12. Another element of the translation might give us pause as well, though it is difficult to tell who is responsible for this element which would have been so easy to duplicate in a translation. Chapter XIII of the Spanish edition is numbered, like the preceding chap- ter, XII, meaning there are two Chapter Twelves followed by a Chapter Fourteen. The English edition, however, corrects this, ignoring that we, too, in the country where this edition is published, consider thirteen an unlucky number, even more so when, as in the novel, a Friday is associated with it. 13. It is as the ultimate deracinated culture that Enrique Dussel can refer to the United States as "modernity's culmination."
