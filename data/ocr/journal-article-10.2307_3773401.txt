<plain_text><page sequence="1">WITCHCRAFT EVENT STAGING IN RURAL TLAXCALA: A STUDY IN INFERRED DECEPTION* John M. Roberts Hugo G. Nutini University of Pittsburgh Since bloodsucking witches do not actually exist in rural Tlaxcala, Mexico, each of the 47 witchcraft events considered here must have been, to some degree, staged. Each event was centered on the death of a child and the staging of each event, among other things, served to convince others that the child, who most probably died from various natural causes, negligence or infanticide, was indeed the victim of a bloodsucking witch. Although any study of staging should be assigned to the genre developed by Goffman (e.g., 1959, 1969), this specific ethnographic line of inquiry was influenced by the ethnographic realization of some of Goffman's ideas by Gregor (1977). For the most part, though, the stimulus for this research is to be found in the previous work of the authors. The term, staging, refers primarily to putting a play on the stage, but it is easily extended to the explicit staging of scheduled and planned events of a somewhat dramatic nature, such as weddings, funerals, dances, ceremonials, parades, athletic contests, etc. The term can also be used in the description of less impressive or even unscheduled events. While some events require years of planning, others, like the 47 witchcraft events, have an impromptu, on the spot quality that can color the staging process. Staging is ubiquitous for most cultural events and are patterned in ways that include staging rules, practices, and investments. These staging patterns always have an economic aspect since their production entails the expenditure of effort and/or resources, but the time, energy, concentration, forethought, imagination, and creativity used in staging also insure that these patterns are expressive as well. Probably the higher the staging investment, the more distinctive, salient, and memorable the event becomes in the minds of both the actors and the audience. Staging has many facets. In the United States, for example, staging investments for weddings within the same religious denomination in the same town or neighborhood may still range from those required for elaborate church weddings to those needed for simple home weddings. Such differences are commonly related to resource levels, but staging differences also occur when the producers have about the same levels of resources, as was the case with the witchcraft events. This latter variation must be tied to other factors. At a gross level, the conventional ranges of variation among the world's cultures are known ~ it^is unlikely that a new culture lying outside the known ranges of standard ethnographic variables will ever be found. Today, 407</page><page sequence="2">408 ETHNOLOGY however, ethnologists are going beyond such gross ranges to examine fine- grained variation that is both interesting and ethnographically interpretable (cf. Roberts 1987; Roberts and Chick 1979, 1984; Roberts and Luxbacher 1982; and Roberts and Nattrass 1980). In the present instance the staging variations for the witchcraft events did not appear to be very large or dramatic. Instead they were like a wash or a coloration of a basic pattern, i.e., a fine-grained variation that can still be interpreted. In the main this present interest in staging as an analytical variable stemmed from an inquiry into expressive culture that included unpublished studies of Chinese and American plays and many investigations of natural games (e.g., Roberts and Chick 1979, 1984). There was also a concern with the supernatural; e.g., reports on witchcraft trials (Smith and Roberts 1954), ordeals and oaths, (Roberts 1965), the evil eye (Roberts 1976), gods (Roberts, Chiao, Pandey 1975), gods and sacred places (Roberts, Morita, and Brown 1986), and animal entities with supernatural attributes (Roberts and Choe 1984). The Tlaxcalan witchcraft events were exercises in deception in the sense of the second definition of the word: "a characteristic, arrangement or situation that deceives or deludes with or without calculated intent" (Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1969:585). The basic idea is not strange to the millions of Americans who have participated in the staging of a visit by Santa Claus, another supernatural figure, in order to deceive young children. Although the proposition is unproved, it is held here that, in general, the more elaborate the staging of a witchcraft event, the more convincing the deception will be. Deception, it might be noted, is commonly associated with the strategic mode in behavior. This strategic perspective was developed in a series of studies of strategy in games and cultures (cf. Roberts, Sutton-Smith, and Kendon 1963; Sutton-Smith and Roberts 1967; Roberts, Meeker, and Aller 1972; and Roberts and Cosper 1987). Expressive strategy as in games and folk tales (Roberts, Sutton-Smith, and Kendon 1963; Roberts 1980), incidentally, is primarily an attribute of complex cultures. The Tlaxcalan rural culture was certainly complex. Field data were collected by Nutini between 1960 and 1966 on bloodsucking witchcraft events occurring in ten villages found in four municipios in rural Tlaxcala in the Central Mexican highlands. He was able to make on the spot observations at each scene and verified with his own eyes the markings of each victim and each victim's mother. He also interviewed some of the actors in each event drama as well as others in the neighborhood. Some information that would have been relevant to this inquiry was not recorded then and, unfortunately, new observational data can not be obtained from the same villages since the witchcraft belief system is now less widespread and strong. The Tlaxcalan witchcraft events certainly conformed to a general pattern. To be sure, some specific staging investments varied in ways that were situational or accidental or both, but other variation was much more systematic. These latter differences may have been related to some of the defensive and expressive needs of a victim's family in that the heavier investments may have been both reassuring to family members and designed to minimize potentially hostile gossip (perhaps to the effect that the infanfs death was due to infanticide or negligence) against the family within the</page><page sequence="3">WITCHCRAFT STAGING IN RURAL TLAXCALA 409 community. One operating principle may have been that the heavier the staging investment, the more secure the deception. THE ETHNOGRAPHIC CONTEXT General Background Although some ethnographic background can be given here, a fuller, ethnographic treatment of bloodsucking witchcraft will appear in a forthcoming monograph (Nutini and Roberts n.d.). Other documentation on the culture of this region has been provided by Nutini (1980, 1984, 1987). Rural Tlaxcala has had an unusually complex cultural history. The Precolumbian culture of the Nahuatl-speaking Tlaxcalan Indians of the central plateau of Mexico was closely cognate to that of the neighboring Aztecs. Later, in the centuries following the Spanish conquest, the culture of the rural population became a virtual mosaic of Indian, Spanish, other European, and various syncretic elements. While elsewhere in Mexico a categorical distinction between Indians and Mestizos does exist, in Tlaxcala such social distinctions are not clear-cut. The labels, Indian, Transitional, and Mestizo, are relative categories indicating socio-cultural statuses, but not self-contained entities within the population. These labels simply partition a continuum ranging from households and communities that are less acculturated to those that are more modernized, secularized, and integrated into the socioeconomic and political life of Mexico. The bloodsucking witchcraft pattern appears to override such acculturative divisions. In the 1960s, rural Tlaxcalans supported themselves through subsistence agriculture, cottage industries, and labor migration. Their villages were nucleated settlements with both single and compound houses. Families were nuclear or extended and the kinship terminology was bilateral. Children were highly valued. Each of the ten villages had its own church (there was a strong Christo-Paganism component in the Catholicism of the villagers). Acculturation was evident, but most people had strong ties to the traditional Indian past. Indeed, folk medicine was still important and modern medical services were minimal. Today the same people are integrated into a national system of health and this acculturative shift in medical practices has been a major factor contributing to the modern reduction in belief in the bloodsucking witchcraft pattern. For rural Tlaxcalans of the 1960s, bloodsucking witches constituted one of four major categories of beings with supernatural powers. Some major tenets of this particular subsystem of belief included: (1) the bloodsucking witch is an anthropomorphic supernatural who is inherently dreadful and abhorrent; (2) the witch may be either male or female although most are thought to be female; (3) the witch is born with her or his powers and carries them for life, although these powers are not deemed to be hereditary; (4) the witch must suck the blood of someone, usually an infant who is less than one year old, at least once a month or she or he will die; (5) a witch is hungriest during the cold and rainy seasons; (6) a witch can fly; (7) a witch can transform herself or himself into an animal such as a turkey, an insect, a dog, etc; (8) a luminosity or glow may be associated with such witches; (9)</page><page sequence="4">410 ETHNOLOGY magical defenses against such witches exist; (10) witches are very irascible; (11) since witches can hear everything within a kilometer, it is dangerous to mention the name of a person as being a witch; (12) witches walk with a limp because they must perform the human to animal transformation at least once a month and at that time the human legs must be left on the fire; and (13) witches usually are thought to come from some other locality, say, far up on the mountain or down in the valley. There was a basic script for the blood sucking sequence. Indeed, the essence of the public deception lay in the convincing groups of people who already believed in the existence of bloodsucking witchcraft that something like the following sequence actually occurred: (1) the witch transforms herself or himself into an animal leaving his or her legs in the fireplace; (2) the witch locates a suitable infant; (3) the witch enters the house, sometimes as a small insect; (4) within the house the witch returns to her or his human form; (5) the witch sucks the blood of the infant, usually attacking the upper part of the infant's body; and (6) the witch leaves the house or scene either in human or animal form depending upon the situation. With any specific event, however, there could be deviations from this general script. Ordinarily, accusations against witches were not voiced in public because of fear of the bloodsucking witches' powers. On the very rare occasions when, in the judgment of the community a witch was identified, retribution was swift--the accused witch was invariably killed and mutilated. Indeed, three putative witches were executed in this area during the twenty-year period prior to the field research. Such extreme object lessons occurred infrequently, but still they served to deter loose or casual identifications of witches. None of the 47 events was associated with the known execution of a witch. The Witchcraft Event The standard event sequence begins with the death of an infant and continues until the associated ceremonies have ended and until major physical and psychological symptoms manifested by one or more members of the infant's family have abated (such a sequence is too lengthy to be described here). In addition there was always the backstage behavior that could not be observed. The "stage" for the witchcraft events consisted of nested behavior settings--household &lt; neighborhood &lt; village. Since bloodsucking witchcraft was thought to be a major cause of infant mortality in a region where infant mortality was high, the first sucking for a household or family was mainly the concern of the immediate family and neighborhood. Subsequent suckings, however, were matters of intense village interest. Such events had true dramatic qualities--for some days after the discovery of the dead infant victim these tragedies absorbed the attention of deeply concerned local audiences. Usually the events were characterized by a succession of public phases. First, the dead infant was discovered. Within a half hour or so after the discovery many, if not most, people in the neighborhood knew about the happening. The infant usually bore characteristic marks. Ordinarily the discoverer provided the first diagnosis that the dead infant was indeed the</page><page sequence="5">WITCHCRAFT STAGING IN RURAL TLAXCALA 411 victim of bloodsucking witchcraft, but soon after the discovery the people of the neighborhood arrived at a consensus to the same effect. By afternoon the mother of the victim had to be cleansed by a ceremonial practitioner known as a weatherman and everyone was invited to the ritual. At this time the marks on the mother left by the witch became a matter of public knowledge. That night there was a special wake for the victim and by morning all the ex post facto rationalizations were in place. Following the wake the infant was buried and after the burial there was a ceremonial meal. The parents usually maintained control of themselves until after the meal, but thereafter various aftereffects for one or both parents could be called to the community's attention in informal ways. Such aftereffects could endure for periods of three days to two weeks and even longer. While it is probable that many of the infant victims died from some such natural cause as crib death, suffocation as a result of negligence or infanticide probably occurred. In one or two cases there seems to have been village gossip insinuating that infanticide was the cause of death, but with every event a potentiality for damaging gossip was present. Any voiced suspicion carried implications of harm for a family in the small worlds of these villages. Discovery of the Deceased Victim Each discovery episode was a key act in the event drama and solid staging was already present, as when an infant too young to walk is found dead outside the sleeping room in the courtyard or as when actual marking of the infant and/or its mother is evident. Indeed, the principal common physical indicators of an infant's having been sucked by a witch were the position and location of the infant's body; black and blue marks on the chest, neck, and back (indicating asphyxiation); and occasionally scratches on the infant's face. Often, too, there were black and blue and other marks on the mother's breast. Two illustrative accounts of victim discoveries are given here (the names are fictitious): CASE A. The household consisted of a nuclear family occupying a compound house with four rooms and a kitchen. The occupants were: Felipe Diaz, 38, head of the household and father of the victim; Altagracia Acxotecatl, 39, mother of the victim; a son, 11; a daughter, 7; and Julian, the victim, who was three and a half months old. On the morning of the discovery, Julian's body exhibited all of the telltale signs of having been sucked by a witch. Altagracia's breasts were normal. The previous night Julian had been protected against the witch by a pair of open scissors placed next to his crib. The two children slept on a large straw mat in a room by themselves and in an adjoining room Felipe and Altagracia had slept on a large straw mat with Julian in a crib nearby. The adjoining room had no windows and was not directly connected. The two rooms had separate doors opening directly on to the courtyard of the house. The doors of the sleeping rooms were closed at night from the inside, more as a protection against the cold than for reasons of security. That night the children went to sleep at the usual time, roughly ten o'clock. Felipe and Altagracia went to bed shortly thereafter for Felipe had</page><page sequence="6">412 ETHNOLOGY to get up before five the next morning to take an order of sarapes to Puebla. At about one in the morning Julian awoke and Altagracia put him to the breast. Felipe was awakened by the proceedings, but he went back to sleep in a short while. Altagracia stated that after nursing Julian she kept him with her on the straw sleeping mat, but despite the fact that she was very tired, she could not go back to sleep. As she was finally falling asleep, she saw an intense luminosity coming from under the door which vaguely materialized into some sort of bird which, in retrospect, she thought was either a turkey or a buzzard. She instinctively hugged Julian and pressed him against her body to protect him. Then she remembered nothing more and fell into a deep sleep. Felipe stated that after being awakened by Julian he also fell into a deep sleep; so much so that he only awoke with great effort knowing that he was already late to catch the six o'clock bus from the principal town of the municipio. He noticed that the door of his room was almost completely open, and as he rose to get a clean pair of pants from the table next to the door, he saw Julian lying on the ground next to the crib some two yards toward the farther end of the room. It took Felipe some time to awaken Altagracia who got up drowsily and upon seeing her dead infant vomited on the spot. Both Felipe and Altagracia stated that they had splitting headaches when they woke up, and the headaches did not go away until late the next day, after the pine wood ashes forming an oblique cross under the infant had been buried by the godfather of the burial cross. Felipe claimed to know relatively little about the bloodsucking witchcraft complex, but his knowledge fell within the normal range of that known by any average inhabitant of Xolotla. Altagracia, on the other hand, said that she knew a good deal about the workings of the bloodsucking witches and that she had experienced two other suckings while she was single (Altagracia had married late at the age of 26) and had lived in her extended family household with two elder married brothers. CASE B. The household consisted of an extended family occupying a compound house with five rooms and two kitchens. The occupants were: Macario Tlahuicole, 26, the victim's father; Justa Quetzalxochitl, 24, the victim's mother; a daughter, 2; and Lorenzo, the victim, who was nine months old; Macario's father, 57, the head of the household; his wife, 56; and two unmarried daughters, 18 and 16; Macario's elder brother, 33; his wife, 35; and three sons, 6, 4, and 3. That night Lorenzo had not been protected from a bloodsucking witch by any of the known methods. Macario's father and his nuclear family occupied two rooms next to the receiving room in the front of the compound. Macario, his married brother, and their respective nuclear families occupied two separate rooms at the end of the compound house's courtyard. Macario's windowless room had a single door to the courtyard. Macario slept with his wife, Justa, on a large straw mat; their daughter slept on a small straw mat a yard or two from Macario's side; and Lorenzo, the victim, slept on a small mat next to his mother, Justa. After Macario and Justa retired for the night, they always closed the door of their room. That night their child and infant were asleep by nine o'clock. The married couple stayed up dying wool in the courtyard until about midnight when they had coffee and went to sleep. Justa stated that perhaps two hours later</page><page sequence="7">WITCHCRAFT ST AGING IN RURAL TLAXCALA 413 Lorenzo woke up screaming and that she put him to the breast to calm him. For nearly a month Lorenzo had slept through the night and his father was angry at being awakened. In a little while, though, he went back to sleep. Justa could not fall asleep for a long time. After nursing Lorenzo, Justa kept him in her arms and did not remember placing him on his own sleeping mat. Both Macario and Justa stated that nothing unusual had happened after Lorenzo woke up, but that the next morning they were so drowsy that it had been difficult for them to get up when they were called excitedly by Macario's father. Macario's father was always the first to get up in order to check the looms for the day's work. That morning he arose at five-thirty. It had not yet dawned, but there was enough light for him to see something lying in the courtyard in front of Macario's door, which was slightly ajar. Upon getting closer, he recognized the dead Lorenzo and immediately awakened Lorenzo's parents. Lorenzo exhibited the classic telltale signs of having been sucked by the witch; in addition, his two cheeks and the right side of his neck were faintly scratched. Justa's breasts were normal. None of the other adult members of the household reported anything out of the ordinary that night or morning. Macario and Justa were desolate but stoically accepted the death of their infant according to local custom. Macario's father and mother were very angry at Macario and Justa when they learned that Lorenzo had not been protected against the bloodsucking witch that night. Macario's father stated that, as far as he could remember, there had never been a sucking in his family because his parents had been very careful to protect infants, and as long as there were infants in the household, there was always a piece of onion on hand for that purpose. He angrily expressed the universal admonition that "the young always know everything and there you have the consequences." THE RESEARCH The witchcraft events were not "set pieces" for they were unplanned, unscheduled, and unanticipated. Indeed, the distribution of Tlaxcalan witchcraft events in time and space was so sporadic that they could only be studied on an opportunistic basis. It was not practical to implement a sampling design then and even if the witchcraft pattern that was so well integrated into the culture of the 1960s were not in a reduced state, it would not be practical now. Nutini collected data on the following topics on as many cases as he could: (I) event date, (2) community, (3) age of the victim at the time of death, (4) sex of the victim, (5) birth order of the victim, (6) ages of victim's parents, (7) social and physical composition of the victim's household, (8) kinsmen sleeping in the victim's room at the time of death, (9) approximate time of the discovery of the victim's body, (10) person who found the victim's body, (II) location and position of the victim's body upon discovery, (12) hours elapsed between approximate time of death and examination of the victim's body, (13) physical marks on the victim's body, (14) physical marks on the victim's mother's body, (15) victim's protection against the bloodsucking witch, (16) unusual events surrounding the victim's sucking, (17) aftereffects</page><page sequence="8">414 ETHNOLOGY due to the sucking on the victim's parents, (18) previous suckings in the victim's nuclear family, (19) previous suckings in the victim's household, and (20) language and degree of acculturation of the victim's household. There were no instances of missing data for these entries. Admittedly these data were not collected with staging in mind. Furthermore, no admissions of staging, evidence of a self-conscious manipulation of staging variables, or any conscious recognition of the cultural significance in differences in staging strategies appeared in the data. The relatively small effect of staging had to be discovered through analysis and inference. In this work cross-tabulations (with nonparametric statistics), hierarchical clustering and optimal scaling were used. For the clustering and optimal scaling the complex variables used by Nutini were reduced to (0,1) dummy variables. After those that discriminated little had been eliminated (mainly through consolidation), a total of 116 variables (listed under brief tags in Table 1) remained for use in developing the similarity matrix needed for the clustering and optimal scaling programs. Some event attributes were coded as being STAGED and UNSTAGED on the basis of both the specific data set and general knowledge. Staged entries appeared to reflect evidence of either direct human intervention or some presumption of possible human intervention while unstaged entries were the opposite of these. Although other attributes may well have been coded as being staged and unstaged, a conservative position was taken. Attributes were also coded as representing high or low experience with bloodsucking on the basis of such variables as the ages of the parents, previous experience with suckings in the family and household, numbers of siblings for the victim, etc. This report, then, makes use of available data in dealing with a new topic. It is exploratory rather than confirmatory. The 47 cases were not a sample, but here they are treated as a population and analyzed in its own terms. Essentially there are two hypotheses: (1) witchcraft events vary in staging; and (2) variation in staging can be ethnographically interpreted. THE FINDINGS Basic Information The witchcraft events were widely distributed. They certainly occurred in various settings, but every event involved the victim's mother and the child victim. Usually the victim's father was an important actor too. The non? parametric statistics used here are the Goodman-Kurskal Gamma statistic; i.e., G, and the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient Rho; i.e., Rho. Table 1 below gives the distribution of the 47 events in terms of a village population scale and an ordinal scale reflecting the degree to which Nahuatl was used (as against the intrusive Spanish) as a household language. The village population scale was also positively associated with a more general acculturation scale ranging from low to high: (1) [Indian-Traditional] &lt; (2) [Indian-Transitional] &lt; (3) [Transitional-Mestizo] &lt; (4) [Mestizo-Secular]. Stem leaf plots for the ages of the victims' fathers and mothers are given in Table 3 below. Ten wives were one to three years older than their</page><page sequence="9">WITCHCRAFT STAGING IN RURAL TLAXCALA 415 husbands while the rest were younger. The median difference in age for the 47 couples was two, i.e., the father was two years older than the mother.

Only a few illustrative associations, however, can be provided. Time, Location, and Artifact Victim discoveries were made by mothers, fathers, other kinsmen and even neighbors at times varying from 3:30 in the morning until two in the afternoon. Here the disco very times were scaled as being (1) prior to 6:00 a.m. &lt; (2) 6:00 a.m. or later. The locations of the victims on discovery were scaled in terms of the distance from the bed or mat where they regularly slept: (1) on the bed or mat; (2) relatively near the bed or mat; (3) farther into the room: (4) inside near the room door; and (5) outside the door. Table 5 shows that victims who have been moved are more likely to have been moved before six o'clock in the morning. Significant human intervention is more likely to occur in these early hours. Table 5 Time of Discovery and Location of Victim (N=47) Gamma =-.478 (Rho =-.355, p &lt; .02 two-tailed). Normally sleeping room doors are kept closed at night, but at the time of discovery the door of the victim's room was sometimes either ajar or open, a condition that was thought to mark the passage of the witch. Table 6 gives the association between the door condition scale; i.e., (1) closed and (2) open, and the victim location scale. It is not surprising that the time of discovery scale and the door condition scale were also negatively associated?Gamma=- .581 )Rho=-.319, p &lt; .05 two-tailed). Doors were manipulated in the early morning hours. The door condition scale was positively associated with a parent's presence scale; i.e., (1) mother only, and (2) both parents?Gamma=.789 (Rho=.403, p &lt; .01 two-tailed). Women who were alone did not leave the door open (statistically speaking) even when the victims were moved.</page><page sequence="12">418 ETHNOLOGY Table 6 Condition of Room Door and Location of Victim (N=47) Location of Victim on Discovery Door Condition Bed Near Bed Room Near Door Outside Totals Gamma=.641 (Rho=.488, p &lt; .001 two-tailed). Some of the victims were supposed to have been protected from witches by charms. While the presence or absence of such charms might represent staging, this is not necessarily the case, as they were commonly used. Table 7 shows, however, that the distribution of these charms may be nonrandom for there is an association between a protection scale: (1) absence of metal or mirror protection &lt; (2) presence of metal or mirror protection and a birth order scale: (1) 1 or 2 born &lt; (2) 3 or higher born.

Physical Marks Physical markings were observed on some victims and some others that were thought to have been caused by the witch. Table 8 shows that three degrees of marking for the victim generated the following scale: (1) No Marks &lt; (2) Slight Marks &lt; (3) Severe Marking. A two valued scale was used for the mothers: (1) Unmarked &lt; (2) Marked. The two scales are strongly</page><page sequence="13">WITCHCRAFT STAGING IN RURAL TLAXCALA 419 associated and where marking is found for both the victim and the mother, the presumption of deliberate staging is strong.

Illness and Pain Some, but not many, of the fathers and mothers of the victims attributed physical symptoms to the witch; i.e., headaches, chest pains, nausea, and deep sleep. Obviously these symptoms need not necessarily represent staging, but it is possible that in some cases they do. Eight fathers and seven mothers reported headaches and/or chest pains. Five fathers and nine mothers claimed to suffer from nausea. Eleven fathers and sixteen mothers claimed to have experienced a deep sleep. Unusual Sightings Altogether 22 people reported seeing visual evidences of the witch. Eleven people, one father, three mothers, and five others, said they saw the witch as a bird (the most common form) or a dog. Seventeen people, five fathers, six mothers, and five others, saw something else, such as moving balls of fire, luminosities, a luminous dog, mists, and vapor. SOME POSSIBLE STAGING VARIABLES: THE FINAL PHASE Aftereffects The symptoms of the physical aftereffects for parents could last two weeks or longer and as little as five days. They could take the form of headaches, chest pains, or stomach pains (seventeen fathers and eighteen mothers had after-pain), nausea (nine fathers and six mothers had nausea), psychological illnesses (eight fathers had the male form and twelve mothers had the female form although there were some variants with these illnesses), or combinations of these.</page><page sequence="14">420 ETHNOLOGY Altogether 61 parents reported having experienced aftereffects. For eleven events neither parent had any, for another eleven events only one parent had aftereffects, and for the remaining 25 events both parents had aftereffects. Table 9 provides an illustrative association. Table 9 Parents1 Aftereffects and Victim's Marks (N=47) Gamma=.566 (Rho=.410, p &lt; .005 two-tailed). The parents' aftereffects scale was also associated with the door ajar scale, Gamma= .751 (Rho= .501, p &lt; .001 two-tailed). It is virtually certain that there were other staging or possible staging effects in the later phases of these events. These data are unfortunately lacking.

For example, since it was common for a household to have experienced more than one sucking (compound houses with their extended families were even more likely to have had previous suckings), these earlier events provided rehearsal opportunities for the later ones. Victim markings and previous suckings in the family were not associated, but Table 10 shows that a positive association existed between a scale of victim markings and the number of previous suckings known to the household. The foregoing illustrative associations suggest that staging is patterned. A better view of this complex situation, however, can be obtained through optimal scaling and hierarchical clustering. STAGING, EXPERIENCE, AND CLUSTERING Optimal Scaling A program written by Steven Borgatti was used for the optimal scaling. A statistically acceptable three dimensional solution based on a conversion of the data set to dummy variables is given in Table 11 where the positive values indicate the high end of each dimension. These dimensions are named: (I) Staging (low to high cultural elaboration of the event); (II) Experience (low to high previous experience with such events); and (III) Actors (low to high numbers of actors involved in the events). The entries for the first two dimensions are viewed as supporting the statement that witchcraft events vary in staging and that some of the actors associated with the events vary in experience. The overall pattern, of course, was best revealed when the 116 variables and the 47 cases were mapped into three two-dimensional plots that were too complicated to be reproduced here. Although Table 11 is ordered in terms of the all-important Dimension I, staging, the data are provided for all three dimensions. The numbers in Table 11 should not be given too exact an interpretation. The injunction published by Romney et al. (1979:320,323) about scaling is relevant here: Since a dimension serves to distinguish among all items, the qualities or characteristics it represents are necessarily very abstract or general. In interpreting the dimensions, it is not always possible to relate directly the relevance of every item to every dimension. We have observed empirically that it is frequently easier to interpret one extreme of a dimension than the other. It is as if some dimensions do not have polar opposites but rather are characterized by the presence or the saturation of a quality at one end while the other end is rather ill defined... The alternative and complementary method of representation is to interpret items in terms of a hierarchical cluster diagram. The tree structure segments the items into distinct clusters at various levels of interrelationship. The similar clusters frequently are composed of items that</page><page sequence="16">422 ETHNOLOGY are similar in content and, hence, the labels we apply to them in our interpretation are quite specific. In Table 11 the values on the staging dimension run from 2.66 to -4.33. Each event is entered and identified by the name of the cluster (to be discussed below) to which it belongs. Each attribute also has a value. Specific attributes presumably or possibly associated with a presumed staging investment are marked by a STAGED entry and those where an investment could have been made, but was not, are marked by an UNSTAGED entry. Note that the high (STAGED) and low (UNSTAGED) staging attributes tend to be high and low on this staging dimension. These entries are also clearly associated with specific clusters. Dimension I in Table 11 constitutes an undimensional analysis of the argument of this paper. The events labeled with their cluster attributes are distributed along the dimension while the attribute tags constitute information on the cultural environments for the events. The nearer entries are to each other on this dimension, the more they are similar.

This section will offer data in support of a hypothesis that purports to account for some staging variation among the witchcraft events. Full confirmation of the hypothesis, though, must await new research.</page><page sequence="20">426 ETHNOLOGY The similarity matrix for the optimal scaling was used in a program written by Susan Weller (Weller and Buchholtz 1986) to produce a U-Statistic hierarchical clustering solution (D'Andrade 1978). The solution was not strong, but it did yield four principal clusters with ethnographic validity even though they included some outliers. When the perimeters of the four clusters were drawn on the two-dimensional staging-experience plot of the events and attributes, it became possible to use the events and attributes found within or near the boundaries of each cluster to name the cluster. The reader is cautioned that proximities described here are only approximate and general. It is the case, too, that two points can be adjacent in the plot of the first two dimensions and still be separated on the third. Occasionally contradictory points were close to each other, but this only indicates that their differences meant little as far as the two dimensions were concerned. The positions of the clusters on the two-dimensional plot roughly fitted the cells of a two by two table. Table 12 shows this schematic arrangement for the two dimensions. Table 12 Scheme for the Clusters on Staging and Experience Staging Experience Usual (Low) Experienced (High) Low Cluster A Cluster B 16 Events (Nos. 24*41 inc.) 5 Events (Nos. 1-5 inc.) High Cluster C Cluster D 20 Events (Nos. 6-25 inc.) 6 Events (Nos. 42-47 inc.) Cluster A (Numbers 26 to 41)?low staging and low experience This cluster had the following attributes plotted within the cluster boundary: Victim discovered between 6:45-7:30 a.m., (UNSTAGED) door not ajar, (UNSTAGED) victim's mother unmarked, (UNSTAGED) female magical illness absent, (STAGED) magical illness present for father, (UNSTAGED) no parent had physical symptoms, father's sister and father's relatives in the room, extended family, compound house, one and only one sibling present in the room, no previous suckings in family, two or three previous suckings for household, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and January + February. The following attributes were closer to this cluster than to any other. Victim was three months old, (UNSTAGED) bruises were absent for the victim, (UNSTAGED) victim had no dried blood, victim was number one in the birth order, there were no siblings in the room, the victim had no siblings, the mother was eighteen to 25 years old, (STAGED) there were aftereffects for the father alone, victim discovered by father's mother, victim discovered by</page><page sequence="21">WITCHCRAFT STAGING IN RURAL TLAXCALA 427 some other father's relative, (STAGED) some relative other than a parent had physical symptoms. Cluster A gives the impression that the principal actors, the father and mother, were relatively inexperienced, but they had access within their extended family and compound house situations to experienced people with the result that they didn't need a heavy staging investment. The actors here may not be as vulnerable. Cluster B (numbers 1 to 5)?low staging and high experience The following attributes were close to the centroid of this small, outlying cluster: the victim was ten months old, the victim was not purple, the victim was discovered by the father's mother, both the father and the mother were in the room, and (STAGED) a supernatural animal was seen without luminosity. The cluster was closer than any other cluster to the attributes of: (UNSTAGED) the victim was unmarked, (UNSTAGED) the victim was on the petate or in the crib, (UNSTAGED) magical protection was absent for victim, the victim was eleven months old or older, the victim was discovered after 7:30 a.m., (UNSTAGED) there were no aftereffects for either parent, Saturday, September, October, November, March, and May. Cluster B was second to the other outlying cluster (D) for the distant attributes of two or more previous suckings in the family, four or more previous suckings in the households, father 41 years old or older, victim number seven or higher in the birth order, and sibling discovered the victim. Cluster B suggests that the events were staged by experienced people who cared little. Either the circumstances were such that they had no worry or they had enough power in the community to feel that it was unnecessary to engage in elaborate defensive staging in order to get others to acknowledge the deception. Cluster C (06-25)?high staging and low experience This cluster is the most interesting. The attributes within the cluster boundaries were the following. Victim was four, five, six or seven months old, victim was nine months old, victim was number six in birth order, victim was purple, victim was female, victim was male, victim was discovered between 3:30 and 6:30 a.m., (STAGED) the victim was moved, victim was discovered by a parent, victim discovered by mother's relatives or neighbors, (STAGED) silver medals or coins used as protection for victim, (STAGED) scissors used as protection for the victim, (STAGED) miscellaneous protection used for victim, (STAGED) the victim was marked, (STAGED) victim had scratches, nearest sibling to victim was one to five years old, (STAGED) mother had bruises, (STAGED) door ajar, (STAGED) there was sleep or drowsiness at the parent level, (STAGED) luminosity was present, nuclear family, single house, mother 26 to 35 years old, father was present, father was 26 to 35 years old, other relatives were absent, (STAGED) magical illness present, (STAGED) female magical illness present, (STAGED) father and mother had physical symptoms, (STAGED) aftereffects for both the father and mother and for the mother alone, (UNSTAGED) no supernatural effects, no or</page><page sequence="22">428 ETHNOLOGY only one previous sucking for the household, Nahuatl was dominant, Spanish was dominant, Season I, and July + August. The following attributes were also closer to this cluster than to any other. Victim was eight months old, victim was number five in the birth order, (STAGED) vomiting and headache present at parent level, (STAGED) there were physical aftereffects, (STAGED) luminosity and supernatural animals were seen, father was 36 to 40 years old, other mother's relatives were present in the room, Season II, and December. Some attributes fell between the high and low staging low experience groups, e.g., victim was male. Cluster C suggests that since the parents are young, residing in a nuclear family, and without heavy support, they must invest in staging as a protection. They are too insecure to take chances. Cluster D (numbers 42 to 47)--high staging and high experience The following attributes fell within the limits of this small, outlying cluster. The victim was number four in the birth order, two or three of the victim's siblings were in the room, (STAGED) mother alone had physical symptoms, one and only one previous sucking in the family, Sunday, and Wednesday. The following attributes were extremely close to the cluster boundary: (STAGED) dried blood present on victim, (STAGED) other metals used for victim's protection, mother 36 to 44 years old, (STAGED) marks present on victim's mother, nearest sibling to the victim was six years old or older, June, and the traits already mentioned--a sibling discovered the victim, the victim was number seven or higher in the birth order, the father was 41 years old or older, there were four or more previous suckings in the household and there were two or more previous suckings in the family. The attribute, father absent, was roughly equidistant between the two outlying clusters. Cluster D actually impinged on the "staged--usual cluster C" and some of the attributes found within the cluster boundary were very close to some events in the other cluster. The attribute, (STAGED) silver medals or coins used for protection, for example, was closer to event 15 than it was to most of the events in the larger cluster. We hypothesize that the actors conducting the staging for the events in this cluster thought that staging was necessary. Their experience enabled them to be selective about it--relying on the more salient attributes such as (STAGED) marks on victim's mother. A STAGING VARIATION HYPOTHESIS If it is accepted that the higher the total staging investment in an event, the more salient, memorable, and clearly-defined that event is likely to be, it is possible to offer an interpretation of the differences in staging investments occasioned by the child deaths. Normally, of course, high investments in such events as weddings, fiestas, etc. contribute to the realization of status aspirations and other positive goals, but high staging investments in witchcraft events seem to have had both a defensive and a reassuring character, although there must have been other motivations as well. Defensive staging investments protect families from hostile gossip because they clearly define the event as a witchcraft event and thus not as an</page><page sequence="23">WITCHCRAFT STAGING IN RURAL TLAXCALA 429 instance of negligence or infanticide. Such staging investments must also be reassuring to believers both within the family and beyond who welcome the deception, even self-deception, for psychological or other reasons. Insecurity for the actors can take many forms. There is the insecurity of inexperience. Since these events were stressful for the principal actors, the less familiar they were with the general pattern, the more worried they might have been. Young people were likely to have been less familiar with the ranges and implications of the cultural pattern than older people. Other things being equal, they should have invested more heavily in staging. In the villages people who had fewer close family allies may have been more insecure than those who had a larger number of family supporters. Principal actors drawn from nuclear families and single houses should have been less confident than those from extended families and compound houses. If these propositions are correct, experienced people with allies should have done the least staging, inexperienced people with allies should have done the next least, experienced people with fewer allies should have done the next most, and inexperienced people with fewer allies should have made the heaviest investment of all. The data presented here support this formulation. The hypothesis, however, should be tested with better data. DISCUSSION The data set is unique, limited, and difficult to present. Verbal descriptions of complicated graphic plots, for example, are clearly less than satisfactory. Other deficiencies include a need for independent measures of insecurity or anxiety for the actors as well as an assessment of the nature and effects of adverse community opinion. Thus, because of the restrictions in the data, this work is more exploratory than it is confirmatory. Primarily it offers some hypotheses to account for the patterns manifested in the empirical data. Except, perhaps, in a rare case of infanticide, it is likely that staging investment decisions did not stem from conscious plans made in advance. By and large the actors simply seemed to play their roles by ear as guided by custom. The decisions represent strategies, but these strategies are impromptu. Although there is a presumptive case for deception for all of the events, additional information is needed to confirm the hypothesis that the higher the staging investments, the more people who were already true believers in the pattern were deceived. Still, staging investments have a strategic quality and they can be mapped into the strategic array for a community. In very many different contexts, strategic decisions are associated with deception, particularly in war, and this holds true for strategic decisions for staging. Consider the deceptive implications in some cases of the white wedding gown in elaborate traditional marriages in American culture. The relationship between cultural modes of strategic decision making and deception has yet to be explored. It is important to note that cultural deceptions can be benign and in the main this is probably the case with these tragic witchcraft events. The events reduce friction within families and villages, reassure actors and spectators in these dramas, and serve other positive functions.</page><page sequence="24">430 ETHNOLOGY In sum, then, witchcraft event staging varies. The more staging, the more likely it is that the witchcraft deception will be heightened. This in turn may have the consequences that have been indicated. Further research is needed into cultural staging and strategies of deception. They merit more explicit field study than they have received to date. NOTE 1. The authors are particularly indebted to A.
