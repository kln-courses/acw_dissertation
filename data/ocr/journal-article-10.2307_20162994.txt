<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY William Sale iHE CREATURES WHO MAKE UP the world of the Theogony are many and various: powers of nature, monsters, gloomy personifications of our quotidian exist ence, joyous Olympians, dark figures of the underworld, all in vast array. So vigorously do they proliferate that Hesiod might well have been content merely to impose order on his theolog ical cosmos. So it seemed to Herodotus: Whence each of the gods came, whether all always were, what sort of form each has?these things were not known until the day before yesterday, so to speak. For Homer and Hesiod . . . were the ones who composed theogony for the Greeks and gave the gods their epithets, apportioned their spheres and functions, and indicated their forms. (2.53). Men knew the gods' names and their rituals; Homer and Hesiod gave them a genealogical order, and a hierarchical order, too, for that is what it means to assign qualities, forms and functions in the divine world. That Hesiod does indeed do something like this is certainly true: his inheritance was not so poverty-stricken for epithets and functions as one might gather from Herodotus, but it must have seemed to him incomplete and confused. All readers recognize how he has used genealogy to reduce this confusion and to enrich the picture of the universe by drawing connections among entities, while the existence of a hierarchy, perhaps less obvious, becomes unmistakable when we reflect on how the final picture is one of a variety of beings all given a certain place within the regime of Zeus. But to say that the two great epic poets presented Greece with an accurate and adequate picture of its own religion is most misleading. Homer and Hesiod do not always agree with each other, let alone with tradition, and the Theogony especially ignores certain very obvious features of Greek poetry and cult. Apollo, Hephaestus and Artemis receive the barest mention, Hermes and Dionysus may not even be in the genuine poem at all, and Poseidon and Athena enjoy quite minor roles. Instead we hear much about Heaven and Earth, Chaos and Tartarus, Styx and Night; when we put the poem down we know more about the Cyclopes and the Hundred armed monsters than about any of the traditional Olympians save Zeus, Aphrodite and the Muses. It is impossible to con vince oneself that Hesiod was preoccupied with the desire to</page><page sequence="2">William Sale 669 give a fuller and better organized picture of Greek religion as he found it. Nor will it do to say that Hesiod the religious historian had to give way to Hesiod the cosmologist, that since he wanted to tell us how the universe came to be the way it is, he had per force to emphasize Gaea and Uranus at the expense of Apollo and Hermes. There are portions of the poem which can be called cosmological: the very beginning of the Theogony proper, where Hesiod or his Muses are faced with the decision as to which powers came first; the portion on Chaos as the locus of the beginnings and the ends of the earth, the sea, the sky and the underworld; and perhaps a few others. But talk about the unpleasant offspring of Strife, for instance, such creatures as Toil and Famine, Murders and False Oath, is not cosmological talk, nor is the elaborate parade of monsters, such as Echidna, the Nemean Lion, the snake at the end of the world. And yet it is just here that Hesiod is not being the conscientious religious historian either, for he has allowed his imagination to become filled with beings who, even when they existed in Greek re ligion before him, can hardly have been more important than Artemis and Hephaestus. Cosmological concern hardly moved him to speak at length, in some of his most powerful poetry, of Zeus' great battle with the Titans, nor compelled him while doing so to devote above forty lines to the Hundred-armed mon sters; these creatures, though not without some standing in folk belief, and certainly very useful to Zeus on this occasion, can not have occupied a prominent place in the religious conscious ness of the average Greek, any more than they can have proved enlightening to anyone worried about the structure of the physi cal universe. Again, when speaking of the intellectual conflict between Zeus and Prometheus, Hesiod had the opportunity to display some interest in cultural history, but instead he lets his time sequences go all awry, because his mind is on something else, the way Zeus' intelligence works. The main theme of the Theogony is deity, and if the final re sult is a picture of the world, somewhat incomplete, then that is because much of the world consists of aspects of deity. The poem's value as cosmogony is therefore the accidental result of Hesiod's having chosen cosmogony as one way of imposing order on?or seeing the order in?the divine. The religious quality to be found in Oceanus, the primeval water, remote and vaguely associated with the underworld, was probably to be found in rivers, especially at their sources, where they are born out of the ground, and in wells, deep in the earth; therefore Oceanus is their father. Hesiod does not say, and it is not necessary to imagine, that he supposed a physical connection, a series of underground channels between Oceanus and the rivers and</page><page sequence="3">67O THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY springs. The story of Uranus' emasculation has been taken as an explanation of the separation of earth and sky; if so, what prevented Hesiod from telling us as much? And in fact we will see that it has another, much richer meaning. The programmatic phrase in the beginning of the poem, "to tell of things that are, and will be, and were before" (38, similar to 32) might seem to refer to a natural order as it developed in time. But we learn from verses 43-9 that it refers to a divine order; the Muses, says Hesiod, talk about universal history and the world order, and when they do, they are talking about gods, the gods from Earth and Heaven down to Zeus and his offspring, and this is what Hesiod is talking about too. One can scarcely doubt that before he wrote his poem Hesiod had spent a good deal of time acquiring a profound knowledge of religious matters and pondering cosmological questions, nor that the Theogony is in many respects the fruit of such pur suits. But he wrote neither as gatherer of divine lore, nor specu lator on the universe, but as a man with a religious vision to expound, a man who wanted to say how he was permitted to understand God when the Muses came to him on Helicon one day. But to speak of a single religious vision is misleading; lurking in the programmatic phrase itself, "past, passing and to come", lies a crucial ambiguity: the structure of the divine, now perfected; and how it came to be this way, its history. Hesiod found God, in varying aspects, throughout a large por tion of the universe, in the palpable and in the remote, and was naturally anxious to expose this hierarchical vision of the reign of Zeus; on the other hand he saw this regime as the result of an evolution, and this was his theogonical vision of the passage of God from infancy to maturity. The latter vision is the more accessible to us, because Hesiod allowed the larger structure of the poem to proceed chronologically from raw, primeval powers to its present order and sophistication. But chronology is often interrupted, largely because he wanted to keep the members of the various groups that are part of the world's hierarchical struc ture as close together as possible. To further complicate his prob lem, some important parts of the universe are not divine, and to bring out this fact Hesiod felt obliged to do violence to chron ology: to show that some of the monsters can be killed, he in troduces the heroes who killed them, and then reverts to a stage in the world's history long before there were any heroes or any men at all. But although this hierarchical vision seems to interrupt the theogonical vision, and although it is far less ob vious, it is every bit as important. What underlies both visions is a single final truth, perhaps a bitter one?that in the heart of the world, a region to which our most intense religious exaltation leads us, there resides a tran scendent Godhead who is hardly more than human: he does tran</page><page sequence="4">William Sale 671 scend, because we know that he is utterly remote, but what we see is only that he lives forever, that he is more powerful, in telligent and just than we are, and that he knows a more com plete joy.1 I THE HIERARCHICAL VISION The structure of reality seems to reveal itself in groups: Olym pian gods, of whom the most prominent are Zeus, the Muses, and Aphrodite; other remote gods, whom we might loosely term Subterraneans, such as Tartarus, Styx and Hades; Natural phenomena?Earth, Dawn, Night and Stars; Human phenomena ?Sleep, Blame, Pain and Strife; and the monstrous offspring of Phorcys and Ceto and the seemingly similar Cyclopes, Hundred arms, and Giants. Left over are certain creatures of little indi vidual importance who contribute mainly to the Theogonical vision, such as the Titans and the Children of the Sea. Hesiod was certainly conscious of using something like this principle of grouping: he assures us, for example, that the Cyclopes and the monstrous Echidna are unlike men and the gods; we ourselves, on the other hand, are different from the gods because they are athanatoi, deathless; the monstrous descendants of Phorcys and Ceto are treated as though they were an isolated whole, the section devoted to them being surrounded pedimentally by groups of natural phenomena; the world beneath us is not only distinguished from Olympus, but it and several of its inhabi tants are hated by the Olympian gods; and of course we all know Olympus and Tartarus are far away from us and are no regular part of our lives here on earth. But because Hesiod by no means treated his groups rigidly or even systematically, and because a great many creatures make the picture confusing by belonging to more than one group, it will be easier for us to adopt a theological scheme more abstract than any Hesiod would have accepted, and divide religious real ity into five modes: the upper remote, the natural, the human, the monstrous, and the nether remote. The difference between a mode and a group is like the difference between a quality and a number of entities possessing that quality, as when I speak not of all the people in St. Louis, but of being in St. Louis; logi cally, if Fx is a proposition function, the F in Fx. To the upper and nether remote there correspond regions and symbols. Thus the upper remote consists of transcendent brightness, clarity, beauty and joy. And there is a region some where in the universe?but not in nature?where these qualities can be found. This place is symbolized, as we shall later see, by Olympus, or sometimes by Heaven. Certain beings dwell here, called Olympians or Heavenly Gods, not unexpectedly, of whom</page><page sequence="5">672 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY the most prominent is Zeus, Godhead. Only in certain visionary or inspired moments can we become directly aware of the upper remote, though its effect is never absent, since Zeus is the world's ruler. Nature's divinity is much closer to us; it is responsible for the awe we feel at the starry sky, the sea's barren sweep, the rising winds of dawn with her rose fingers. Humanity has no share of the divine nor of immortality?those entities confined to the human mode are never theoi. This mode consists of pain, misery, strife and evil, which sounds pretty unpleasant, but we must keep in mind our capacity to be touched by the Olympian, and that more frequently, as we shall see, than one might sup pose. The monsters may be immortal?not all are?but are never divine; their mode is obvious enough, except that we shall find it necessary to distinguish between their fearfulness and the more holy terror of the nether remote. The latter consists of transcendent darkness, murkiness, ugliness and cruelty. As with the upper remote, so with the nether there is a place where these qualities may be found?found only through visionary experience, it might be added, because this place, though in nature, is not palpable, at least while we are in life. In fact, if we try to give it a location we will become confused, because at times it is called Tartarus, the underworld, at times Chaos, itself hard to locate but predominantly the chasm between Tartarus and the earth, and at times the far west. I will, faute de mieux, refer to the region of the nether remote as Tartarus, which will therefore be both a literal name and a symbol, and to its inhabitants as Subterraneans, a term which therefore may or may not be liter ally accurate. The modes of religious reality are unique; the remote is never the natural, the human never the monstrous. But certain crea tures who belong to more than one group in the structure of real ity may or may not be capable of conveying more than one mode. (Applying the logical analogy, if P and Q are modes, they are never equivalent, but there may be an x such that Px and Qx are both true.) Thus Tartarus is both part of nature and one of the Subterranean gods, but his religious mode is entirely that of the nether remote, for he is never near, never palpable. Eros, on the other hand, an Olympian but also a natural phenomenon, is capable of conveying both modes: as part of nature he inspires wonder at nature's all-pervasive creative power, while as part of the upper remote he helps to make us feel that sex and pro creation may bring us in touch with the soul of God.2 That Olympus in our poem is a symbol for the upper remote, and not one of the real mountains, is indicated in several ways. Its birth is not mentioned; lines 129-30 refer to the mountains where the Nymphs dwell, but Olympus can hardly be one of them?it is too important not to deserve separate mention, and it is the haunt of deities more important than the Oreads.3 Hesiod</page><page sequence="6">William Sale 673 calls it "snowy" in virtually the same breath (62, cf.42) in which he locates the Muses' shining dancing-places and beautiful homes "a little ways away from its uttermost peak"; this is not real snow, but symbolizes clarity, remote height (lesser peaks lose their snow), the white radiance of eternity. Zeus, who reigns here, also rules in heaven (e.g. line 71); such interchangeability is possible only because both Olympus and Heaven (as the term is used here) are symbolic. It would in any case be incredible that Godhead, the spiritual "father of gods and men", charac terized by surpassing power and practical intelligence, should be the local spirit of Mt. Olympus, or even that his presence could be especially felt there. Olympus not only names a re ligious mode that is different from the natural, it is not part of nature at all, it is a purely spiritual region. We shall see that our perception of the Olympians does not arise out of a profounder contemplation of nature, one which allows us to penetrate its deceptive outer surface or which frees us from the shackles of the subject-object artifice. Such contemplation may lead to a sense of the divine in nature, but communion with the sky gets us no further than Uranus, it does not lead us to Zeus. The names of the other Olympians are not all vouchsafed us, but they certainly included the Muses (who dwell in Pieria but spend much of their time in Zeus' company), Aphrodite and her com panions (for I do not know what else "entering the company of the gods" in verse 202 can mean than joining the Olympians) and Leto. Mnemosyne, Memory, mother of the Muses, lives on another mountain, Eleuther, which cannot be identified but which seems to be near Olympus: In Pieria [on Olympus' northern slope] Mnemosyne joined in love with the father, the son of Cronus And bore the Muses?Mnemosyne, who rules on the foothills of Eleuther (53-54) It is in Pieria that the Charit?s and Himerus (Desire) have their homes. Apollo, Artemis and Hephaestus are called Heavenly? and thus Olympian?Gods in 919 and 929. Here our direct evi dence ends, and we face the surprising fact that most of the Homeric Olympians are yet to be named. Are we to conclude that Hesiod had removed them from this exalted place? Greek religion was not, after all, free of the feeling that Poseidon dwelt under the earth or in the sea, that Hestia was present in the hearth, Demeter in the soil. But a little reflection shows that Hesiod cannot have shared this feeling. Sea is himself a god; the notion of two orders of deity resident side by side, per petually, in the sea is very hard for me to understand. The momentary presence, at a time of inspiration, of something tran scending the sea's normal divinity, is altogether comprehen sible; no doubt such things occur and Hesiod recognized their occurrence. That barren, restless plain, raging now and again</page><page sequence="7">674 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY in its swell, is a god (131, taking otrugeton in both of its sug gested senses); but that emptiness, that continuous motion, that anger, carry us no further than Pontus himself. We are not told in so many words how Poseidon comes, but analogy with the Muses, Aprodite and Athena suggests that the visit of an Olym pian accompanies some form of human activity, and from 440-3, if these verses are genuine, we infer that the activity in Posei don's case is fishing. It is that inspired feeling of power over the sea that causes us to see the Olympian helping to move our hands and minds, and beyond that to feel dimly the presence of the most powerful hand and most intelligent mind of all, to know the reality of the Father. But Poseidon does not live in the sea, nor Demeter in the soil, and I do not suppose that for Hesiod Hestia dwelt in the hearth any more than Hephaestus in the forge. But the criteria we have for saying so turn out to be rather slender. Rhea and Cronus have six children, all of whom are theoi (624): Hades, who is certainly no Olympian, for he lives in Tartarus (455, 767), Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Hestia and Deme ter. Hera, as everyone knows, is concerned with an activity, marriage, which is certainly capable of yielding holy moments (despite 603-12). Of Demeter and fanning the same can be said. Hestia I feel altogether uncertain about. Of the other Ho meric Olympians, we learn too little about Ares to say any thing; Dionysus, on the other hand, transfigures, he is pre eminently a god who offers communion, and thus surely leads us to Olympus; Hermes, god of the herdsman, is in 444-7 made parallel to Poseidon, and even if these lines are not genuine I would take them as representing the spirit of Hesiod's thought.4 No one would dare to banish from Olympus Zeus' favorite daughter, the iheos Athena (573), while Eileithyia, goddess of childbirth, ought no doubt to be allowed to dwell with her mother Hera, goddess of marriage. Hebe and Heracles are said to be there too, but in verses (950-5) on whose authenticity only the most courageous would rely. Textual difficulties plague us again when we try to place Hecate; if the section lauding her is genuine, I would feel compelled to call her, without enthu siasm, an Olympian.5 The reason for Hesiod's slighting of so many familiar deities, to the degree that we must struggle to locate them, is a matter of guesswork, though the guess need not be blind. Athena pro tects the king's palace, directs its domestic activity, but above all inspires the heroic warrior (925-6)?she moves among prin ces. Hephaestus, as we have seen, belongs to the smith, Hermes to the herdsman, Poseidon to the fisherman. For Hesiod, on the other hand, the avenue to godhead was the Muses, primarily, and secondarily Aphrodite. Farmer and shepherd he may have been, but his persona in the Theogony is poet. For him, as for</page><page sequence="8">William Sale 675 poets generally, the Muses are the chief intermediaries between Olympus and himself. He knows that they live on high: "Un wearied flows the sweet sound from their mouths, and the homes of father Zeus reoice . . . and the tops of snowy Olympus echo, and the homes of the immortals" (39-43). And "there are their shining dancing-places, and their beautiful homes" (63). In their hymns "they please the great spirit within Olympus, tell ing of what is, and will be, and was before" (37-38). But they can come down to us, for this same song they sang on Helicon once to Hesiod: "They breathed into me an inspired voice, so that I might sing the future and the past" (31-32). Zeus and Olympus are far distant from man, but through the Muses' words, the Godhead and the divine disposition are revealed. We must never forget that this is a religious experience; such in spiration, allowing direct contact between man and remote deity, can be called communion just as surely as the Eucharist or the divine afflatus on the holy tripod. And such communion takes place during the act of love, at least during loving impregnation, when Himeros (Desire) and Eros, the god of procreation, are with the goddess of the sexual act. It would seem, in fact, that her companions must be there for us to feel her presence while making love: And Eros accompanied her, and handsome Eros followed When first she was born, and as she entered the company of the gods. (201-2) Hesiod does not leave us in any doubt as to what Aphroidte's time and moira, her status and portion, actually are: The whisperings of girls, and smiles and deceits, And sweet delights, the act of love, and gentleness (205-6) Every step in the act of love is, or may be, within the purview of a goddess; it partakes, or may partake, of divinity in some sense. And the sense is an exalted one: this is her sphere "among men and the immortal gods": while making love we may share an experience with the Olympians, and at such times a goddess who dwells with the remote father is present to us quite as fully as she is to those on high. Hesiod's own experience, therefore, accounts for the great attention given to the Muses and Aphrodite, and I rather sus pect that he felt the communion they offered to be grander than anything Hephaestus or Poseidon might afford. But the latter are Olympians and must have their due. It may sound very peculiar to hear that the inspiration that causes the smith's mind and hand to create beauty, or the fisherman's to catch fish, is comparable to Holy Communion. But only when the modern has accepted this idea can he claim to know what it means to call Hephaestus or Poseidon a god. From what we have so far said there emerges a distinction between Zeus and the other Olympians which is of the utmost</page><page sequence="9">676 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY importance. To many a Greek, Zeus may have revealed himself in thunder and lightning, but for Hesiod he himself was forever remote, while the other Olympians have their place mainly with him, but come to us in our moments of intense religious feel ing, and bring with them that brief glimpse, that transient exal tation, that is all we know of Olympus and of the Father who rules and guides all. The great Olympians, and certain other gods whom we have yet to look at, are intermediaries (not in tercessors). These other gods I refer to are Eros, Himeros and the Charit?s, all subordinate to Aphrodite; Mnemosyne, sub ordinate to the Muses; Themis (Established Principle) and her children, the Horae (named Good Government, Justice and Peace) and the Fates, who "give mortal men good and evil to have" (906). There are reasons for wanting to call all of these Olympians, of perhaps a less exalted stature than Aphrodite and Athena. What these reasons are in the case of Mnemosyne, the Charit?s, Himeros and Eros we have already seen: the Charit?s and Himerus live in Pieria; Mnemosyne can hardly be very far away; and Eros accompanied Aphrodite when she joined the company of the Olympians. Themis is a "wife" of Zeus; this group includes Demeter, whom we wanted to call an Olympian; Eurynome, who as the mother of the Charit?s might be expected to enjoy at least honorary Olympian status; Mnemosyne; Leto, specifically an Olympian; Hera; and Metis, who dwells not only on Olympus but in Zeus' belly. This criterion is by no means conclusive, but it is certainly suggestive. Themis' children, the Horae and the Fates, are not called Olympians, either, but they clearly must be, since they represent Zeus' dispensation on earth. Still, it seems fair to think of these figures as lesser intermediar ies than those we have so far examined: they are appended to greater figures and derive their personalities from them. It is true that in a sense all intermediaries are a reflection of Zeus, and that therefore the Muses, for example, should not be dis tinguished from the Horae and the Fates. But the Muses and the other greater Olympians have a lively individuality, while the Horae and Fates are rarely more than expressions of Zeus' will. More important, these lesser figures seem to be less exalted simply because they play a more regular part in our lives. This is obvious enough in the case of Eros, Himeros and Mnemosyne; as for the Charit?s, even the gloomy Boeotian poet who named them Beauty, Good Cheer and Festivity (Kurt Latte, A&amp;A II, 1946, 161) must concede that he had named features of our experience. Themis, too, and the Horae are to be found on earth and are not invariably apprehended by inspiration or vision. (But the Fates may be somewhat different; though active, as he says, amongst us, dispensing good and evil, they seem to re quire more subtlety to apprehend?it is not always easy to per</page><page sequence="10">William Sale 677 ceive how and to what degree our lives are being molded by the divine). These lesser Olympians seem capable of two modes, in fact, the Olympian and the human. This is initially puzzling: how can the same entity be an immortal theos, belonging to the upper remote, and at the same time be grouped with human phenom ena, which are neither divine nor deathless? But when we move away from the abstract, the problem seems less difficult. With the Horae it is easy: we are hardly startled to hear that morality and peace on earth are touched by the divine hand, nor that contemplation of human harmony and justice can lead us to feel drawn into God's presence, to pass from the awe created by das moralische Gesetz in mir to the belief that it lives outside and far off. Perhaps it is in the performance of the moral act rather than in reflection on ideals that we feel more acutely the holiness of morality. The Fates represent the feeling of divine control over our lives; one hesitates to call them human phenom ena at all, not only because awareness of this divine control seems to require inspiration, but also because the human phe nomenon ought to be the control we ourselves exercise?and this has, it seems, its own personifications, Moros and Ker (211; the words meaning Fates are Moirae and Kerae). I am inclined to think that Hesoid was himself uncertain as to whether the Moirae were entirely Olympian or conveyed too something of the purely human, for he makes them children of Night (al most all of whom are human phenomena) and children of Zeus and Themis. Eros as a human phenomenon is simply one's own procreative power, which obviously dies (perhaps even before one himself does) and therefore is not immortal. The Eros that pervades the whole world, the primeval power of universal crea tion, is everlasting; when we think of ourselves, animals, all of nature proceeding eternally in its grip, we may feel exactly the same wonder that the bestirnte Himmel can awaken, which would cause a Greek to say that he was in the presence, not of Godhead, but of a god. But at more profound moments, when in Aphrodite's presence, he helps to create a sense of communion with the upper remote, a feeling that is not merely awe, but transfiguration.5 The same may be said of Himerus, except that he is never called a natural power. Beauty, Good Cheer and Festivity are human phenomena when we are especially con scious of how transitory they can be. But together, as Charit?s, love-goddesses, they lend to certain moments of loveliness and joy a feeling that in the presence of the Olympians they need not die. The ability of certain creatures to reflect more than one mode of religious reality should therefore pose no problem: Hesiod knew the difference between Eros as a primeval natural power</page><page sequence="11">678 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY (120-2) and Eros as a companion of Aphrodite (201-2). If I have succeeded in making clear what feefings are aroused by the various modes, under what circumstances their presence may be felt, the distinctions among them should also be clear. Vision and transfiguration, exaltation and communion apprehend the Olympian, usually when we are involved in some appropriate activity; then we may feel that we are at the heart of the world, where all is beautiful and brilliantly clear. When no such in spiration is required to recognize that deity lies before us, then we are face to face with the natural; and when what we appre hend, however fascinating or moving it may be, has nothing divine about it, then that is the human. These experiences are obviously quite different, but that does not present our intel lects from realizing that the entity (such as Eros) responsible for these different experiences may be the same. But we must notice that the great intermediaries, though they enter our world at times (or do we enter theirs?), never lose their Olympian status. The primary locus of the nether remote is Tartarus: but it shares its religious quality with Chaos and to some extent with the far west, so that Hesiod often perversely groups all three together geographically, to the despair of those who would un ravel the admittedly cosmographical portions of the poem. Chaos is a great chasm, in which are to be found the beginnings and ends of earth, sky, sea and Tartarus; it is a mouldering, frighten ing place, where the Titans dwell under misty darkness (729 31, which do not refer specifically to Tartarus); it is a place which all other gods hate. Such language is used of Tartarus: the gods hate two of its denizens, Death and Styx; its standing epi thet is "misty"; in it dwells Erebus, primeval darkness itself. With both Tartarus and Chaos the far west has many links. The Hesperides (whose name means "ladies of the west", not "daughters of the evening") reside "beyond Oceanus", obviously meaning the west, near Atlas (517) and the homes of Night (275). But Atlas may also be encountered in the land where Chaos and Tartarus meet (746); and just here Night has her homes, if we may believe verse 746. The ends of the earth are not only in Chaos, for it is at those ends that the golden apples grow, watched over by the great snake and by the Hesperides (333-4, 518). The west is not golden, either?it is misty, just like Tartarus and Chaos. Like Tartarus it is traditionally a place of death; Professor Nilsson and Ludwig Malten have made it pretty clear that this tradition long antedates Hesiod (Myce naean Origins of Greek Mythology, [Berkeley 1932] 214, with references). Whatever cosmological difficulties these identifications may entail, they are religiously entirely sound.6 Together these three regions constitute the remote home, not of the merely dark and</page><page sequence="12">William Sale 679 fearful, but of things more profound: panic in the Greek sense, the terror that strikes suddenly and grips body and mind alike, leaving us helpless for anything but endurance and prayer; blank despair, such as might be inspired by a vision of vast and utter desolation, of the death of the world. I am aware that Hesiod does not describe his experience of the infernal in this or any other language; what he does instead is to speak of it as hateful and fearful to the gods themselves. The nether remote is the very opposite of Olympus' joyous brilliance and clarity; but like Olympus it is transcendent. That is why Tartarus, though part of nature and dealt with as such in several passages towards the end of the poem, conveys none of nature's religious feeling. The latter is ever near, we may experience it almost at will, while Tartarus comes to us mainly through such intermediaries as Night, Sleep and Dreams. The difference between Tartarus (using the name compen diously) and Olympus is brought out in other ways. We have seen how it and several of its inhabitants are hated and feared by the immortal gods; yet it is itself a home of divinity: Night (213), Styx (775), Death (759), Sleep (759), Hades (as a child of Rhea and Cronus; cf. 767-8, though the grammar of these lines is peculiar). This apparent contradiction is unintel ligible unless by the "immortal gods" is meant another order of deity, and the reader cannot help but think of the Olympians, no doubt correctly, though the only other divine mode, the natural, may be included with them. We are told why the Olym pians hate Styx (775-806), but the story is not nearly so illumi nating as a curious line concerning Death. When Hesiod calls him a theos who is "an enemy even of the immortal theof (765), he does not mean merely that the immortals do not die, or he would not have said "even." They do not die, they do not have our reason for fearing death, yet even they are hostile to him, because his divinity is of an altogether different sort, dark, grim, antitheti cal to the glad visitation of Aphrodite and the Charities. Night, though she is not said to share the general obloquy, must have seemed, at least in her subterranean mode, fearful and loath some to Hesiod. For she is chosen to be the progenitor, without consort, of a broad array of unpleasant human phenomena (211 32); knowing that she is the mother of Pain and Strife, we can hardly help but see in Tartarus, her home, cruelty as well as despair. Thus one of the monsters, the beautiful winged horse Pegasus, found a home on Olympus (285); another lives in Tar tarus, the ugly (311-2) and cruel (770-3) Cerberus.7 If Zeus had a counterpart in the underworld, it would be Hades, but we learn little of him, so little that we are probably being told that there is no Dark Lord. Tartarus may be cruel, but the real loci of evil are the monstrous and unnatural, and the human mind and heart.</page><page sequence="13">68o THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY It is most important that we do not call Tartarus and its deni zens (with the exception of Cerberus) monstrous; nothing said about them affects the observation that a monster and a theos belong to absolutely different religious modes. Nowhere are Hades and Styx distinguished in appearance from their respec tive siblings, the Olympians and the Oceanids; even Night when she most suggests the terror of the depths is never called mis shapen, unnatural, awry. Hesiod knows that there is a Tartarus because the Muses told him so; he knows it too from tradition; but the idea is too pow erful not to have been confirmed by independent religious ex perience. At Night we feel the awe which the contemplation of divinity resident in nature arouses; but at moments we may feel something more, intimations of Erebos, the true darkness, and the mysterious irrational horror which Tartarus inspires, which even the Olympian gods feel. But though at Night we may feel Tartarus, our vision of it, corresponding to the vision of Olympus vouchsafed by the Muses, will come through Sleep and Dreams, who, like the Olympian intermediaries, have homes far distant but visit us. (Death is another subterranean theos who comes to us, perhaps a grim "intermediary" as well). Tartarus' intermed iaries resemble the lesser Olympians: they are familiar features of nature or human experience, enough so that we feel that they partake of these modes of religious reality as well. (One can sleep and dream without having a nightmare.) But their homes are in Tartarus.8 The monsters are remote, from Man and from the gods. They dwell in no one region, for they do not dwell together; most of them live vaguely "beyond the sea" somewhere, though some walked long ago in lands now familiar to us; Pegasus and Cerbe rus are in heaven and hell; the great snake is at the ends of the earth. They are not theoi, and several are not even athanatoi: Medusa, the Hydra, the Chimaera, the Sphinx, the Nemean Lion, Geryon and Orthus are all slain. Their curious status is well reflected by the Gorgons: Sthenno and Euryale are immor tal and ageless, while Medusa fell at Perseus' hands. It would take exceptional courage to argue from their immortality that the first two are goddesses: what criterion distinguishes them from Medusa? Only their immortality, and to employ that is to beg the question. Echidna, athonatos, ageless, even entitled to the adjective theios (though this is not startling, since the epi thet is used of men in Homer), "does not resemble mortal men or the immortal gods" (295-6) and dwells "far from the im mortal gods and mortal men" (302). These statements, resem bling those made about certain Subterraneans, need mean only that Echidna is no Olympian (she is of course not natural, at least religiously, being remote and monstrous). But when Hesiod wants to use the term theos of creatures who are not Olympians,</page><page sequence="14">William Sale 681 he does so; when he does not, neither can we. Echidna is, in fact, one half snake, one half nymph. But this teaches us little, for nymphs, as we shall see, may be either theoi or not, either athanatoi or not. The Cyclopes, again, are like the gods in every respect, except that they have but one eye (142-3; another ver sion of the passage goes so far as to make them mortal). The Giants, about whom we hear very little, are nonetheless distin guished from gods and men in verse 50. Even the Hundred arms, so helpful to Zeus in his battle with the Titans, have no right to the title theoi; the nectar and ambrosia they are given may insure their immortality, but do not bestow divinity. Hesiod's conviction that the monsters, though neither human nor divine, are part of reality, is based not only on the Muses' tale but also on the traditions which mentioned them (mainly heroic legend and epic poetry) and the experiences?nightmares and fantasies?which confirm those traditions. Two groups of them, the Cyclopes and Hundred-arms, earned through their help to Zeus in his hour of crisis a distinct place in the scheme of things. As a group, the monsters remind us that nature can? or perhaps could, before the present regime?run amok, and that Zeus could cope with, bring under his control, and even utilize the disordered and the grotesque. They also give us a notion of what the divine is not. Monstrosity precludes divinity ?a not un-Greek notion, and quite in keeping with the overall view of the poem, that the gods are after all very much like our selves, (cf. Glaube I3, 274-5). A connection, perhaps vague, between the monsters and Tar tarus cannot be denied. The Gorgons, for instance, dwell "be yond renowned Oceanus, at the end, towards the home of Night, where the Hesperides sing their silver song" (274-5). Pegasus was born near the springs (pegai) of ocean; not only is Oceanus vaguely near Tartarus, but if these springs are similar to the springs of the sea then they are in Chaos, near the springs of the underworld. The home of the Hundred-arms, which must be near Tartarus, is called Ocean's themethla (foundations) in 816. Chrysaor's son Geryon lived in the remote west together with Echidna's child Orthus, till Heracles killed them. Arima, Echid na's home, is under the earth. The Snake who guards the golden apples lives in dark earth's womb, "at the great limits." The Cyclopes may well dwell underground, though this is not said. The connection thus implied between the monstrous and the subterranean seems natural enough: both are remote, fearful, mysterious; our experience of both must often be in dreams. But we know the difference?at least when we awaken?between the truly hellish and the grotesque. The divine that is ever near is conveyed by natural phenom ena: Heaven and Earth, the Mountains, the Sea and the Nereids (expressive of the sea's qualities), Iris the Rainbow, the Sun,</page><page sequence="15">682 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY Moon, Dawn, Winds and Stars; the Harpies, stormwinds of the sea, in the borderland between the natural and the monstrous; and Night, Day and Eros, whom we have met before. (Natural phenomena who do not convey this sense of the divine are Tar tarus and Erebos, already discussed, Oceanus and the Nymphs, to be looked at presently, and perhaps Aither, whom I am in clined to identify with Olympian brightness, as an opposite to Erebos, but who may be merely the clarity of the upper air.) I do not see how we can refuse any of these creatures the word theos, for I do not see by what criterion Night, the Nereids (theoi, 240), the Oceanids (366), Dawn (380) and Eros could be distinguished as a group from the others. Divinity fills all of Nature except that part which dies. We have already seen why this mode of deity is of a different order from the Olympian and the Subterranean: to apprehend it we require no vision, no in spiration, feel no true communion. We can see the Earth and the Stars regularly, but Olympus comes to us at less frequent holy times. The feeling is different; the natural awakes awe but does not transfigure. It cannot be stated emphatically enough that we are not in the world of Euripides or the English Romantics; this is transcendentalism, and if it fails, it does not thereby be come something else. (Compare Glaube I3 248 for a similar, though less sweeping, asseveration). My claim that in the Theogony the utterly transcendental hardly proceeds beyond the human meets a challenge in the fact that natural objects are divine but do not look like us. The reply expresses one of the more familiar truths about Greek religion, that humanizing elevates, that gods who are persons are the gods who are worshiped, that menschlich muss [ein Gott] werden, damit er dem Menschenherzen wirklich nahekommt (Glaube I3 279). The very fact that nature is less than human helps to dis tinguish it from the Olympian. This is no petitio principii: I have not assumed that the higher, Olympian divinity is more human in order to make it different from the natural. The fact strikes us everywhere, in literature, painting, sculpture, in all remnants of cult and myth, that the Olympians resemble, not the stars, but ourselves. Three problematic creatures must be dealt with individually. Oceanus has a curious status: he is part of nature, yet never near?we can see the heavens, but we cannot see him. Yet he is not as remote as the subterranean; he probably represents the borderline (cf. 289-94; in verses 274-5 to be beyond Ocean means to be in the far west). This makes good theological sense: mysterious but not monstrous, distant but obviously no Olym pian, he must be near Tartarus, but not dark and gloomy enough to be of it. The Nymphs are socewhat harder. The Nereids (not called Nymphs by Hesiod, but generally so considered) are nat ural phenomena and theoi, and so too are the Oreads:</page><page sequence="16">William Sale 683 And Gaea brought forth the large mountains, lovely haunts of the theoi, The Nymphs, who dwell up along the wooden mountains. (129-30) This is very plausible: the mountains, like the sea, are immortal, and are surely theoi, so that the Nymphs expressive of their quali ties should like the Nereids, also be theoi. Trees, on the other hand, die; Hesiod may well have shared the view expressed in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite that the tree-nymphs "belong neither to the immortals nor the mortals" (259), for they live a long time, but do eventually succumb (cf. the pseudo-Hesiodic Precepts of Chiron, fragment 171 Rzach, in which the Nymphs live 680,400 years, if my arithmetic is correct). If therefore the Melian Nymphs (187) are ash-tree spirits, they may occupy this in-between status. Iris is an intermediary, but in our poem a strange one, passing from Olympus to Tartarus (784-6). Yet is this not just what she does, reaching from the upper air to beyond and below the distant horizon? The human mode is mainly conveyed by the children of Night and Strife (211-32). Of them the word theos can be used of Sleep and Death, subterraneans, and the Moirae (now together with the Kerae), still to be considered lesser Olympians, despite the fact that their parentage is different from what it is in 904-6. Whether it can be used of the Hesperides, the only figures here who have nothing apparently to do with humanity, I do not care to speculate; scholars seem agreed that their appearance in this list is to be explained by their geographical relationship to their mother. All the others are strictly human phenomena, and I see not the slightest reason to call them theoi. We ourselves are not gods?why should what is appropriate only to ourselves be? Can divinity be found in Blame and Pain, in Deceit and Old Age? It will not do to assign this query to a twentieth-century sensi bility; the onus of proof is on those who maintain that Hesiod would have used a word, theos, which in fact he did not use. And it will not do to argue with Professor Solmsen that the enu meration of such creatures in the Theogony is in itself grounds for considering them in some sense divine (Hesiod and Aeschy lus, p. 30), for then we must either eliminate all the mortal mon sters from the poem or permit them to be gods. To bring this point out more clearly, we should observe that many of these human phenomena have divine counterparts. Styx' children, Force, Might, Rivalry, and Victory, are echoed in the human sphere by Strife and some of her offspring: Fighting, Battles, Murders, Slaughters, Quarrels. Eris' last child is (false) Oath, corresponding to Styx herself. Over against the Moirae and Ke rae stand Moros and Ker: although Zeus allots us our portion, we have some say in the matter too. (But Moros and Ker normally seem to mean "doom," not "allotment," so the correspondence is</page><page sequence="17">684 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY not perfect.) Philotes represents sexual intercourse without the divine presence, contrasted therefore with the philotes which in 206 is one of Ahhrodite's timai. All these creatures, real en tities beyond any doubt, resemble aspects of divinity, but are not gods. In the same way we resemble the Olympians them selves, but that does not makes us divine. Two other beings are candidates for being called human phe nomena: Prometheus and Epimetheus. I admit that these are usually said by later poets and scholars to be Titans, but Hesiod does not say so; verses 207-10 suggest, in fact, that the Titans are confined to the children of Heaven and Earth. If they are Titans, they may be theoi, along with many of their aunts, uncles, and cousins; I would not, however, want to put much weight on the immortality of Prometheus' liver (524; the genuineness of the passage is in any case vigorously disputed). Our uncertainty arises from the fact that their role in the poem is primarily func tional, as we shall see later, and not hierarchical; there is no question that in the Works and Days they symbolize human intelligence, but in the Theogony they (or rather Prometheus, since his brother's role is slighted) are largely foils to Zeus. Still, the words do mean "Forethought" and "Afterthought," so that symbolism cannot be eliminated altogether, and they themselves are mythologically very close to Man, especially Prometheus, who gave man fire and saw to it that he got the better share of the sacrificial meal. Prometheus is a foil, but of a rather paritcular sort: it is his task to show that the profoundest huma intelligence is no match for Zeus', and thereby to indicate that "it is not pos sible to deceive or outwit the mind of Zeus" (613). All this makes it very tempting to look upon him and his brother as counterparts such as we have seen, here echoing the divine intelligence, Metis. Except for Prometheus and Epimetheus, all human phenomena are descendants of Night. This is surely no accident, but I am unwilling to draw the inference that the human is especially related to the infernal. The picture drawn in 211-32 is a gloomy one, but at least we are spared reference to Night's homes in Tartarus. Rather there is a simpler contrast, between the bright ness and joy of Olympus and our darker and harder sublunar existence. The Olympians tease us with their close resemblance, but how different their lives actually are! Of the creatures we have omitted, one species only belongs to the hierarchy of present and significant reality: the Erinyes, born, like the Giants and the Melian Nymphs, of Earth impreg nated by the blood of Uranus' genitals. They are hard to classify, for little is said about them, but they seem to belong rather to our region than to the Olympian: spirits of vengeance, born of castration, they are traditionally associated with the earth. The Titans whom we have not mentioned exist somewhere, relics of the past, their roles played out. Those who fought against the</page><page sequence="18">William Sale 685 Olympians for the throne of heaven cannot be named, but they can be located, in the region where Chaos and Tartarus mingle, 729-31. Some were parents or grandparents of natural phenom ena, such as Theia, Hyperion, Crius. Some?Phoebe, Coius, Rhea, Cronus?begat Olympians. Crius was also the grandfather of Styx' children and of Hecate, while Iapetus begat Atlas (who seems to be a natural phenomenon related to Tartarus ), Prome theus, Epimetheus, and the mutinous Menoetius who hardly be longs to the hierarchy. The Children of the Sea, apart from Ne reus, the Old Man of the Sea?another figure whose religious status is almost impossible to guess at?are as colorless as these faded Titans. Thaumas married the Oceanid Electra and begat Iris and the Harpies; Eurybia (a theos, 376) of the adamantine heart bore Pallas (a male figure, married to Styx), Perses (fa ther of Hecate), and Astraeus (another theos, 380, and father of the winds). The union of Phorcys and Ceto was of course blessed with such issue as the monstrous snake at the end of the world, the Graiae and the Gorgons; it is from Medusa's blood that Chrysaor, ancestor of the other monsters of this group, sprang. Hesiodic religion was monotheistic in the sense that underlying every deity there was a certain quality, expressed by using the word theos in the singular to mean, not "a god," but "God" or "the Divine" or, if you like, "Heaven." To state more precisely what this means is not an easy task: we know that it is other than human, more than human, more powerful, more free (though, we shall see, neither all-powerful nor completely free). But the most important criteria for divinity were, and are, the feelings aroused or the vision inspired. Such feelings might in clude wonder and awe, misery and terror, joy and transfiguration, as long as we are aware, either through a specific vision or through simple conviction, that a power outside of and beyond ourselves is ultimately responsible for them. The sense of the power beyond is the starting point; after that we make distinc tions. The most complex distinctions are the first to be made and probably precede any sense of the unity of divinity. I am re ferring to the individual deities, such as Hermes and Hephaestus and Athena. To speak of modes is much more sophisticated; they are more nearly felt than openly expressed even in the Theog ony. Also more sophisticated is the division of aspects of deity into the remote, the near and the intermediary. The last is so deeply ingrained in later western religious thought that I have deliberately soft-pedaled it in order to avoid suggesting false analogies, especially to Medieval Christianity. But the religious experiences leading to these differing con ceptualizations are not, in my opinion, so very different. The wonder?perhaps mingled with some comfort?that we feel at</page><page sequence="19">686 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY deity present in nature is much the same whether we give the object we are confronting the title theos (as in "the theos Sea") or speak of the pneuma or the Holy Ghost. Misery and terror before glimpses of some remote dark power may or may not cause us to identify this power as the final source of all evil and the locus of eternal damnation; but how we intellectualize after the fact is for my purposes less important than our willingness to say about the face that we have confronted something out side ourselves, whose home is far distant, where the true terror and the true despair reside. Most of all I want to insist on using the word communion of Hesiod's own experience of the Muses, an experience which was a vision, because he saw them and the laurel they gave him, and heard of past, present and future from them; which was inspiration, because he says that they "breathed into" him their message; which was transfiguration, because for that moment his soul was open to Olympus. He knew the inti mate presence of God?what else does the word communion mean? The fact that during the experience he may not have seen precisely what a worshipper of Dionysus or Demeter, or a Jew or a Christian sees, seems to me beside the point: similar experiences can have different conceptual outlets. Yet we must be cautious: though these outlets may have much in common?and they ob viously do?we must avoid the opposite extremes of insisting on influences or insisting on the universality of the ideas emphasized by whatever religious sect we happen to belong to. If I have made Hesiod's thought appear to be an adumbration of Chris tianity, I have failed. Further definition of the word theos must wait upon our ex amination of the theogonical vision, but it is already clear that the transcendent Godhead is hardly more than human. Zeus is immortal, of course, as we are not; he is just, for he married The mis and begat the Horae; he is intelligent, for he defeated Prometheus and swallowed Metis, wisdom; he is powerful, he overcame the Titans. But when we look closely, as we shall, at his quarrel with Prometheus, we shall not find that the quality of his intelligence inspires awe. He is made to seem rather more expedient than just, and justice is certainly not confined to Olympus: Styx, the divine ineluctable oath, is a Subterranean. Powerful Zeus is, but much emphasis is laid on the fact that he needed the Hundred-arms to defeat the Titans. He is more free than we, but not completely, for there is a pattern in events which must be reckoned with. Zeus copes with such obstacles successfully, it is true, but he is not free to ignore them. Like Cronus, he was destined to be overthrown (464; 898-8); un like Cronus, he was equal to the occasion; but he was put to the test. Even our own Prometheus offered him a real challenge. Perhaps the most compelling reason for seeing the human in Godhead rises when we look at the array of human counterparts</page><page sequence="20">William Sale 687 to the divine, and are struck by the absence of a qualitative dif ference?the divine is only more so. And the gods above look human. Like us they rejoice at the Muses' song, and like us they enjoy the timai of Aphrodite. Godhead is the exaltation of our selves. Yet it is not fully anthropomorphic: it would be absurd to ask how tall Zeus is, or whether his beard is white. It is rather that nothing about him is essentially non-human; no effort is made to find a symbol which insists upon a radical difference. Ezekiel saw a wheel within a wheel; Hesiod, believing deeply that the Muses had shown him something transcendent, could not or would not move beyond humanity idealized. II THE THEOGONICAL VISION To the Muses we must attribute the overall contents of the Theogony; but Aphrodite seems to have lent much to the theo gonical vision, for Eros, the god of procreation (intimately con nected in 120^-2 with sexual desire) was the first great creative force; if loving impregnation can carry one to Olympus, and if the communion afforded by Aphrodite is especially elevated, Eros must surely be a fundamental power to anyone who feels that nature shares in divinity. After his appearance, sexual gen eration became possible, and thus the universe could develop in a reasonably orderly fashion. (Yet things are still quite unsettled, for in these early days procreation without intercourse frequently happens, Chaos apparently giving birth to Erebus and Night, Gaea certainly to Uranus, the Mountains and Pontus, neither with the aid of a mate. The order is signalized by polarities: Aether (Brightness) and Day are born of Erebus (Darkness) and Night; Earth gives birth to Heaven. I do not want to deny the cosmological overtones of these opening verses. I do want to deny a remark by Cornford: "[Hesiod makes] cosmogony older than theogony . . . the gods arose out of the several provinces of nature" (From Religion to Philosophy, London, 1912, p. 18), and to repudiate a phrase of Geoffrey Kirk's: "a sexual metaphor for cosmological differentia tion" (Entretiens Hardt 7, p. 49). We have seen that these prim eval powers are theoi, and that therefore any distinction between "the Gods" and Nature is without meaning. And the sexual ele ment here is no metaphor, therefore, but the simple truth: as gods, these powers could be affected by Eros much as we are. Eros is sex, not energy, as understood in physics, not a principle of differentiation. Kirk's error is the same as Cornford's?he thinks that Hesiod's purpose was cosmological. But after all, when we read that Gaea is the mother of the Mountains, who do indeed rise from the flat surface of the earth, do we really under stand the cosmos any better? Is it not rather that knowing the</page><page sequence="21">688 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY natural facts already, we can then appreciate the genealogy? Taking an example from later in the poem, knowing that Dawn is the mother of the Winds does not tell me why the winds spring up at dawn, and it is surely my experience of them, not what I read in Hesiod, that first informs me that they do. But Hesiod as sures me that one corner of divinity, the whole of which is Zeus' hierarchy, is well-ordered, that these gods go by the same rules as other gods. Oh, I suppose that I am a fortiori assured that there is a natural order, and that it developed the way humanity develops, sexually, but this is a less important statement than that God developed this way: cosmogony, though present, is at the service of theogony. The second force whereby the divine is enabled to become what it now is can, I think, be called Violence, though Hesiod does not give it a name. The orderly progression of events through continued sexual reproduction comes to a natural road block: one generation must give way before the next, not without anger, hostility and perhaps even open battle. Hesiod could have removed this roadblock from his own scheme, of course, since the gods are immortal and do not require continued reproduction to perpetuate their race. But quite apart from the fact that he probably knew from tradition of some sort of succession to the throne of heaven, he had everything to gain from seeing divine progress as one generation following upon another, at least until Zeus appeared. The gods are not, or at least were not, free from violence, and through succession of generations Hesiod could introduce violence as the natural outcome of the primordial or dering principle, sex. For Violence enters the world when Uranus tries to prevent Gaea from giving birth to her children. He has begotten, a new generation must come, and with it, he fears, his downfall. This he wants to stop, and hence for the first time evil appears (166; the line says only that Uranus conceived of unseemly actions before Gaea did, but there were in fact no such actions any earlier). Before examining the story more closely, we might ask why Hesiod doesn't tell us of the birth of Violence in advance, and whether he hasn't in fact deliberately reserved the birth of Vio lence until later in order to avoid bringing it in here?for surely Violence is the same as Eris, the child of Night. The first and simplest answer is that, named or unnamed, violence, is in the story. But we can say more. If Eris once played a part amongst gods, she does so no longer: she has been replaced in the divine sphere by the children of Styx under the control of Zeus. She is now one of the human phenomena; as such, and as parent of such offspring as Toils, Famine, Murders and Manslaughters, she belongs to an era too recent to be described before the birth of the Titans. Because Eris belongs especially to the human realm, she will not be mentioned in the emasculation scene; but the fact</page><page sequence="22">William Sale 689 that she is nonetheless there gives this crisis in the development of the divine a most human touch, in keeping with others of its features which we shall examine. Just as a great and fundamental human and natural phenomenon was the first force to operate in the universe, so another human phenomenon is the second great developmental power. And the one naturally follows upon the other; Eris is not the offspring, but she is the outcome of Eros, and one problem in the development of the divine, a problem for Zeus to solve, is how the two may be brought under control. Conflict first arises because Uranus does not wish to see the im plications of sexual reproduction carried out . . . but Hesiod tells the story in a much more colorful fashion. That there is a rela tionship between the Cronus-Uranus conflict and the Oedipal situation as understood by psychoanalysis has long been ob served. What happens in the Theogony does not, of course, mir ror what happens in human life; but it is a startlingly accurate picture of one of the most fundamental Oedipal wishes. Feeling himself repressed by his father, fearful and guilty, the boy longs for the mother to be the instigator, to make the fateful sugges tion, to justify it by accusing the father of shameful deeds .This permits him in his fantasy to go on to carry out the deed, to destroy his father's power at just the moment when the father is enjoying the intimacy which the boy craves. The story in the Theogony recreates this fantasy in every particular. Cronus is being repressed by Uranus; Gaea is the instigator of the plot to end this repression, telling her children that "he was the first to think of shameful dealing"; Cronus in agreeing repeats these last words, as if to reassure himself that the hostile deed is per missible; he lets himself be led to the place of ambush, he re ceives the sickle from Gaea, he cuts off his father's members. If the beauty with which the emasculation scene recapitulates an obvious Oedipal fantasy is disregarded, a most harmonious and profound picture is lost thereby. This picture reinforces the idea that Eros creates Eris: not only does the father seek to fore stall the results of sexual generation, but the son, jealous and angry, wishes to strike at the organ symbolizing the longed-for intimacy. This serves to make the scene intensely human, in keeping with the development of the divine so far: the sex drive, familiar to us all, is the primeval creative force for the gods; it is soon to be associated with Aphrodite, whose sphere embraces the mortal and the immortal; it ought therefore to carry over to the divine region further of its implications for humans, its gen eration of strife in the Oedipal situation. From this act of violence Aphrodite is born; the goddess of the sexual act is born from the very repudiation of that act. I have argued elsewhere (TAPA xcii, 1961, 508-21) that this paradox arises because Hesiod has used traditional materials in order to stress Aphrodite's connection with procreation and fertility; I have</page><page sequence="23">69O THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY already stressed that it was not in the love act per se (philotes) that Hesiod experienced God, but in loving impregnation (Him erus?Aphrodite?Eros ). Eros?and with him divinity?is matur ing; no longer the blind creative urge, he is part of an action, of a series of acts, the stages of courtship: dalliance, smiles, de ceits, joy, intercourse, tenderness. This might seem to be a false dawn; or perhaps Hesiod has gone ahead of himself, for in the next section, without the mature love act, without even a consort, Night and later Eris give birth. Such progeneration suggests not so much the miraculous as the chaotic and primitive; it may be that Hesiod wished to lend to these human phenomena such a flavor, as if, though actually be longing rather late in the world's development, they were a kind of throwback, as their generally unpleasant character suggests they ought to be: not products of the regime of Zeus. At any rate, we must regard the normal process, whereby two parents are needed, as essentially the more orderly and mature, and the stage in which Eros, Himerus and Aphrodite are all present as the final development of sexuality. (And it is important to notice that, if we are concerned with the growth of the divine, the way Night has her children is unimportant, since these children are not theoi. ) A similar problem arises in the case of the monsters descended from Phorcys and Ceto. They are younger, we would suppose, than Zeus and appear to be a relapse on the part of the universe. And so they are?but since they are not theoi, they do not affect our understanding of the growth of God. Kurt von Fritz has argued plausibly that with the passage from the first to the second generation, cleverness has entered the world ?not, of course, the ordering intelligence of Zeus, but an adum bration of it, deceit: this will eventually become the third great force in the universe (Entretiens Hardt. 7, p. 22-3). Perhaps to signalize the increasing orderliness of divinity, the Titans of the second generation beget a great many of the powers of nature. (It is worth noting that although some of them are monstrous, the Titans do not beget monsters. ) Another kind of foreshadowing is given by the fact that two of the Titans, Memory and Themis, will be most important to Zeus as he establishes his order; so also will three of the Oceanids, Styx, Metis and Eurynome. In other words, the second generation is divinity's adolescence, where sex is com ing to maturity, where the mind is beginning to grow, where be havior is becoming regularized, where aggression, however, still must be brought under the control of true intelligence. For that we must, of course, await the reign of Zeus. We are not disappointed; Hesiod devotes the long section on Prometheus and much of the Titanomachy to showing us how Zeus' mind works:</page><page sequence="24">William Sale 691 So there is no way to deceive or go beyond the mind of Zeus. For not even Prometheus . . . escaped his heavy wrath. (613-4) It must be emphasized that this is the story's purpose, because in telling it Hesiod has stitched together several myths which were told before him for various reasons. Why does man receive the better share during the sacrificial meal? Well, at Mecone, long ago Prometheus set out before Zeus two portions of meat: one con tained meat and inner parts rich with fat, but these delicacies were hidden in an ox's stomach; the other had gleaming fat on the outside, but within were nothing but bones. Zeus chose the latter, and "because of this the race of men burn bones for the immortals on their fragrant altars" (556-7). A logical story if not entirely flattering to the father of the gods, and quite complete in itself. Man asked himself how man learned the art of kindling fire, an art which seemed Zeus' prerogative, necessitating his thunder bolts; Prometheus stole fire from Zeus, preserving it by the slow burning fennel stalk. It may be, as von Fritz argues, that this tale was in pre-Hesiodic times attached to the sacrifice story: Zeus used to kindle fire for men until, angered over the attempted de ception, he refused. Again, the story is logical and complete, unless perhaps we need to hear how Prometheus was punished. But Hesiod was most anxious that the stories be incomplete, and lead from one to the other and thence to yet a third, wherein Zeus, distressed over the theft of fire, sends man the beautiful evil, woman. These tales are for Hesiod part of a running battle of wits; Zeus therefore was not really deceived when he made the choice at Mecone, but brooded his response, which was not to give man fire. That this response destroys the logic of the first story?how are men to burn sacrifices on altars without fire??is of no importance. If it were, Hesiod knew how to say that Zeus took fire back so that men could not enjoy their ill-gotten gains, but this he does not say. His mind is not on the problem of why we sacrifice as we do, any more than the problem of how we got fire. We are to concentrate on how Zeus' mind works. Its characteristic is that it seeks not to eradicate what has happened but to balance it. He accepts the choice of the poorer portion, he accepts the theft of fire, though he might easily have refused to do so. But it takes no imagination to destroy or retract; the first-rate intelli gence responds with some new and interesting scheme, so that we are left with the impression that whatever Prometheus might de sire, Zeus will outdo him with another maneuver, unexpected, yet on the whole fair?for each advantage gained man must accept a balancing disadvantage. It is of some importance to Hesiod that when Zeus reveals the violent power at his command, this power should not seem brutal or uncontrolled. To secure his regime he must do battle with his</page><page sequence="25">692 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY predecessors, the Titans, and during this encounter his force ap pears in majestic splendor: And Zeus no longer held back his wrath. No, in an instant his mind was filled with wrath, And he showed forth all his strength. And at once he moved from heaven and from Olympus to gether, his lightning flashing. And bolts soared thick together, with thunder from his over whelming hand; Thick they rolled along the sacred flame. And all around life-bearing earth shrieked as she burned, And all around huge forests cracked thundering with fire, And all the ground seethed, and Ocean's streams, and the barren sea. And the hot breath surrounded the Titans of the earth, And huge the ball of flame reached the awful heavenly light, And they were mighty, but the glow shining from bolt and flash blinded their eyes. (687-99). But the decision depends also upon the Hundred-arms; urged to secure their help, he releases them from prison and coaxes them with nectar, ambrosia, and these insinuating words: Show forth your enormous power, your invincible hands, Hostile to Titan gods in the mournful fight. Mindful of my gentle affection, of how you suffered Before you come back to the light from your painful bonds Up from the realm of gloom, through my design. (649-53) Cottus, speaking for the three Hundred-arms, seems quite capable of seeing through Zeus' "gentle affection": Sir, what you say is quite familiar to us; Yes, we too know how wit and intelligence Are yours in large measure. And you are the gods' defender from icy ruin. Because you were wise we came back . . . from the realms of gloom. (655-660) What counts is their release, for which they are grateful; if Zeus cares to call it friendliness, they will neither endorse nor gainsay. But the point is really that Zeus has received good advice and has taken it, and as a result carries the day. The Titans are relegated to Tartarus: these crude forces, repre senting divinity's adolescence, could not have achieved order or stability, for their intelligence was no more than cunning. It is certainly fanciful, but it is also thoroughly consistent, to say that Zeus, the reasoning ego, has relegated the impetus to less orderly strife to the divine unconscious. The Titans occupy a dark and</page><page sequence="26">William Sale 693 hidden corner of the universe; glimpses of them perhaps emerge as all glimpses of Tartarus do, in Sleep and Dreams; their leader, Cronus, who fulfilled the Oedipal wish, is now hidden, buried within the recesses of the divine mind. Of course, the suggested parallel to the process of repression in psychoanalytic theory does not make of Hesiod a Freudian, but he need not have read Freud to know how the mind, in achieving control and maturity, pushes into its own shadows the specters and bogeymen of its past, and how sometimes even now, at night, in dreams, these come back to us and frighten us as they used to do. Violence and Strife threaten Zeus' imperium, and he is perfectly equal to the occasion; now he must face the task of bringing sex under control, of being master of his own offspring. Metis, Wis dom, is capable of bearing the son who might overpower his father, and Metis is swallowed by that father before the son can be conceived. The process of creation is not thwarted: Athena, al ready in Metis' womb, comes forth from Zeus' head; the threatened heir, never conceived, never exists; Metis becomes part of Zeus, "to devise for him good and bad" (900). This may all seem a most artificial solution, but a careful comparison of this portion of the poem with that part depicting Cronus' behavior towards his progeny shows Zeus again intelligently following advice in order to cope with a real difficulty (see the excellent remarks of Erbse on pp. 8 ff. of the article cited in footnote 9). His progeny here after are all made part of his regime, all become familiar aspects of divinity, ordered manifestations of godhead: the Seasons, Fates, Charit?s and Muses are his emissaries amongst us; Apollo, Arte mis, Hebe, Ares, Eileithyia, and perhaps Hermes and Dionysus, are Olympians of recognizable if undefined function, known by all men as subordinate to Zeus; Persephone is Zeus' representative in Tartarus. A last recrudescence of the old unordered sexuality erupts when Hera, angered because Zeus has usurped the female prerogative in giving birth to Athena, herself alone bears Hephaes tus. But the familiar smith god threatens no one, and from now on, we feel sure, sex and aggression are both under the divine control. Deity has come of age, and since the gods are immortal, it will not grow old and die; it will remain this way forever. But in all other respects, how very human it is! In its infancy, raw, un formed mature; sex, then strife, became its leading characteristcis, its ways of struggling towards order. Reason appeared adumbrated in a kind of adolescent cunning, but with maturity the reasoning ego appeared in its glory, imaginative, vigorously powerful, to bring aggression and sex under control, to relegate the old im pulses to the shadows of unconsciousness, to give deity the per manent stamp of what the very best that is human can achieve. For both visions have brought us to the same end: the final answer is no more than a single human being, the feelings that</page><page sequence="27">694 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY seem to carry us beyond ourselves and to show us a new world have after all given us only ourselves. Olympian godhead may be remote and ageless, leading a better, brighter sort of life than ours, but nonetheless a human life; other manifestations of divinity, Earth and Sea and vast Chaos may not seem very human, but they do not transcend the human, nor do the powers who dwell in gloom in the nether darkness. And when we shift our focus to divinity as a whole, we have seen it grow through all that we have grown through, from instinctive infancy in which nature was su preme to an adulthood that is greater in scale than any we achieve but which transcends us only in that unlike us, it will never die. FOOTNOTES 1 No scholar, however conservative, believes that the manuscripts offer us Hesiod's poem as the author composed it. Consequently I shall be forced at times to utter cautionary remarks concerning the authentic ity of certain passages, though it will usually not prove profitable to enter into debate. In general I believe that nothing after line 964 be longs to the Theogony; that only one or two small passages from 930 62 can be defended; that the Typhoeus episode (820-85) has been added by a later hand (or mouth); that the Hecate hymn (410-52) is troublesome; and that the rest is essentialy genuine. A modest stripping away from this remainder of lines here and there will usually not seri ously affect what I have to say; radical incisions, such as the elimination of the whole of the Tartarus portion (736-819) would be more damag ing, and my view could not tolerate the removal of the birth of Aphro dite (188-206). Radical incision is the hallmark of Felix Jacoby, in Hermes 61 (1926) 157-191 and his edition of the Theogony (Berlin 1930); but his stylistic observations are far more interesting than what he has to say about Hesiod's vision. The works that I have found especially help ful are Wilamowitz' Glaube der Hellenen, which I refer to in the third edition (Basel 1959), and Friedrich Solmsen's Hesiod and Aeschylus (Ithaca 1949); Professor Solmsen's references to previous work are very detailed and?so far as I can determine?extremely comprehensive. He does not give much material dealing with eastern influences; much of this may be found referred to in TAPA xcii ( 1961 ) 508-21 and in the article by Hartmut Erbse referred to in footnote 9. 2 Greek religion is ordinarily considered polytheistic, and I have been using the words "God," "the divine," and so forth pretty freely. I think that the patient reader who refuses to let such language trouble him will eventually see that through the exposition of Hesiod's vision we arrive at a conception of God, imperfect indeed, but still meaningful. I do not want to anticipate this definition, but a few words concerning the Greek noun theos may be helpful. Theos may be translated "a god" or "a goddess," but there are pas sages where it must be rendered "God": God will grant this, and will let that alone, Anything that in his heart he may wish. (Odyssey 14.444)</page><page sequence="28">William Sale 695 "Die Gottheit," say Ameis-Hentze on the line, "die allgemeine einheit liche Bezeichnung des g?ttlichen Wesens oder der G?ttergesamtheit" (11 ed. Leipzig 1900). There are also places, for which I refer the reader to the lexicons, where theos, "God," and the plural theoi axe almost interchangeable. It follows that theos by itself is relatively un differentiated into gender or number; it says less, or, with stricter logic, we may infer less from its use than from theoi or the femine thea, be cause from the latter two we learn that plurality and gender are rele vant. (The reader should keep in mind the absence of an article, defi nite or indefinite, in Homeric Greek; in English usage a noun is rarely unaccompanied by an article, and from the article things may be in ferred. ) And in the rare passages where the context urges us to trans late theos by "a god," we can argue that more is being said than in those where either "a god" or "God" is possible or where the latter is necessary. ( The above remarks owe a great deal to conversations with Professor Saul Levin, of Harper College, though we disagreed, as I recall, over certain details. ) The criteria for the use of theos, "God," are substantially the same as for the use of theos, "a god" or "a goddess," or theoi, 'the gods." God is not to be radically distinguished from a goddess or a god: He manifests Himself in them. Hence I will here confine myself to setting forth the criteria for calling something a theos: it must be sentient, for ever so; it must belong to the natural, the upper remote, or the nether remote; it must have certain human features, the most prominent being sexuality. We will fill out Hesiod's conception as we proceed, but the reader should be warned that many theological questions will have to go unanswered. 3 Line 130 is usually athetized because it seems a clumsy explanation of theoi in 129: The great Mountains, lovely haunts of the gods, the Nymphs, who dwell up along the wooded mountains." The line is clumsy, and reads exactly like the marginal note of a commentator (except for the word for "wooded," which is poetic; Jacoby on the other hand suggests the influence of Odyssey 6.123?he says 14.123? in Hermes 1926, p. 173n.l) But Hesiod is not always elegant, and without 130,129 is altogether misleading. 4 It is by no means certain that Hermes and Dionysus are in the poem at all. They are mentioned in 938-41 in the midst of a most doubtful section, but these four verses can have been displaced from the probably authentic passage on the "wives" of Zeus, 886-929. If so, then Hermes' mother Maia might be an Olympian. Semele, mother of Dionysus, is more bafHing. Line 942 makes her a theos, though she was once mortal, a rather improbable chain of events. We hear of Hermes in line 444, in the Hecate passage, but scholars have, of course, not left these lines unscathed. 5 Kurt von Fritz has argued that just as there are two Erides in the Works and Days, so there are two different Erotes in the Theogony: "die gewaltige Machte des Urtriebes," and Aphrodite's companion, "der sich an dem Sch?nen, dem Lieblichen, dem Anmutigen, ent z?ndet." (Entretiens Hardt,7 H?siode et son Influence [Geneva 1961] p. 10) I see no great harm in speaking this way, even though I have put it differently. But I do see harm in suggesting, as he does, that the</page><page sequence="29">696 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY companion of Eros is less exalted and especially attached to the human sphere. 6 I am well aware that it is possible to introduce geographical har mony. Imagine the earth and sea and everything underneath to re semble a hot-air balloon such as Montgolfier used to go up in around the turn of the eighteenth century. Earth and Sea form the baloon's skin, Sky the surrounding air, or, to be precise, the air at a little distance except at the bottom, where it touches the skin; Tartarus is the rider's basket, and Chaos the interior of the baloon and the space between it and the basket. It will be seen thus how the ends of earth, sea, sky and Tartarus can be in both Chaos and the far west: but the image, not merely the model, feels anachronistic. 7 It may seem odd, if all this is true, that Day should be a Subter ranean?but here, I think, cosmography and not religion has called the tune: at night, Day suffers a kind of death, and goes to Death's dominion. 8 The objections to these assertions concerning Tartarus' intermedi aries are not without weight: a. Hesiod describes in detail the visitation of the Muses; we hear not a word about the epiphany of any Subterranean. The obvious con clusion is that Hesiod's knowledge of Tartarus, drawn from tradition, was confirmed solely in that momentous hour on Helicon. To answer this I can only appeal to the reader's experience: if he has known the violent irrational terror of a lonely night, if he has felt that certain fantasies and nightmares, perhaps certain psychedelic drugs, have given him a glimpse of an infernal beyond, he will be likely to agree that Tartarus can be known through religious experience, and that Hesiod also knew it thus. b. Dreams are not located in Tartarus, and Hesiod seems to go out of his way to avoid suggesting that Sleep brings nightmares of the underworld to us: Sleep is quiet and gentle to men (763). But before we look at the passage closely, let me ask whether we are to forget that Sleep is Death's twin brother, that he is associated with the un pleasant phenomena of 211-32, that he does live in Tartarus, that Dreams do come to us when we sleep, and some of them are night mares. The passage in question actually gives Sleep's other side. In 759 both he and Death are called fearful (deinoi). Then follows the start ling statement that the Sun never looks upon either one of them, as though no one ever died during the daytime (or slept them, for that matter). But a little reflection shows that what Hesiod is referring to is their religious quality: their mode is antithetical to the bright light of the sun. This not only makes Sleep a dark and gloomy thing, but ties him all the more closely to his brother. If later he is called peaceful and gentle, then Hesiod is reminding us that however like he is to Death, he is also different. Why is Sleep like Death? I know that sleeping people can look like dead people, that the psyche leaves the body temporarily, and so on, but this is of no help in explaining our passage. We are looking for a religious quality, and that must derive from the common participation</page><page sequence="30">William Sale 697 of the two brothers in the Subterranean: Sleep too can bring with him a strong flavor of the despairing, the gloomy, the infernal. 9 Scholars have commonly said, and no doubt will continue to say, that the story signalizes the separation of the earth and the sky. The story may well be pre-Hesiodic, even primitive, and people who know about that sort of thing may agree that when told by primitives, it had to do with such a separation. But not when Hesiod told it: earth and sky have long been separated; at this point in the poem they are join ing again in love each night. The notion that Hesiod is using this story to tell again what he told before is even more tiresome: to imagine his being exercised at all with the question of how the separation took place is difficult; to imagine his returning to it is impossible. But modern scholarship appears unable to abandon the notion that Hesiod has just emerged from a cave or climbed down from a tree. If further refutation of this notion is required, I refer the reader to Hartmut Erbse's inter esting article on Orientalisches und Griechisches in Hesiods Th?ogonie in Philologus ( 1964, pp. lfl). Professor Erbse's own view, unfortunately, leaves the text too far behind: "The son completes this gruesome transaction . . . because the mother desires the destruction of the inexhaustible procreative power" (p. 5). Gaea will be worried for the future, fearful that she will con tinue to become pregnant without relief. But actually Gaea appears far more concerned with the past; she is in agony because the children she has already conceived may not emerge: And huge Gaea was groaning inside, Choked and crowded. And she conceived of a clever and cruel plan (159-60). She must feel that an emasculated Cronus will not merely lose the ability to impregnate her; without his penis, he will no longer be able to repress their children. I am not giving the story a logic which will force psychoanalytic interpretation; this is precisely how the tale is told. Professor Erbse suggests that the whole idea may well go back to Aphrodite's Homeric epithet philommeides (laughter-loving), which Hesiod will not have understood aright, but have taken to mean some thing that I can only translate "genital-loving." Line 200 says that she was given the epithet requiring this curious translation, ph?ommedes (not-meides), because she was born from the medea, the genitals. Most editor athetize the line ( Professor Erbse seems to think that such a notion first occurred to Friedrich Solmsen, on September 5, I960); those who tolerate it probably see in it a bad pun: Hesiod knew per fectly well what philommeides meant, he even mentions meidemata, smiles, amongst Aphrodite's timai in 205, but he had already told his emasculation story and saw how he could adjust the epithet to fit it. Under the circumstances it hardly mattered that ph?ommedes (with out the i) made very little sense. But Professor Erbse argues otherwise. "Because the poet is ponder ing the meaning of the Homeric epithet, he tells the story of the in human punishment of Uranus . . . and because he must give reasons now for this kind of emasculation (sic; surely he means "this kind of punishment") he ascribes to him the above-mentioned misuse of his procreative power." It is not at all his procreative power which he</page><page sequence="31">698 THE DUAL VISION OF THE THEOGONY misuses; he misuses his brute capacity to keep the children from emerg ing, but this flaw has already been noticed. What is more important is that a rich story becomes the by-product of the misunderstanding of an epithet. Professor Erbse is aware of the need for support, and he looks for it in linguistic evidence. He tries to show that Hesiod might have misunderstood the Homeric epithet because in Hesiod's dialect, Boeotian, the word for genitals, medea, might have been spelt meidea, so that philommeides might look or sound as if it had something to do with genitals. But the spelling of meidea for medea in Boeotian appears to be no older than the fourth century, and even if e and ei sounded very much alike when uttered by a fellow villager of Ascra, he him self was thoroughly steeped in the Homeric dialect the Theogony was not composed in Boeotian. Our MSS (all except one) gave ph?om medes and medea, which is evidence that Hesiod spelled the words this way and distinguished them from philommeides and meidea (not conclusive evidence, scribes err; but their witness does count for some thing). What Professor Erbse is most anxious to say, if I understand him correctly, is that the emasculation scene, told as Hesiod tells it, suits the Theogony eminently. Very well, then that is why he told it this way, whether or not he borrowed it and whether or not Professor Erbse and I agree on how it suits. Beginning by presuming a misunderstand ing of the epithet really does nothing to help Professor Erbse's case. Of course, he also wants to explain why Aphrodite is born from severed genitals. But there are better reasons than the one he chooses: the fact that she was called Uranus' daughter at a very early date, and the fact that there was an early myth of Aphrodite's birth from severed genitals which cannot have been derived from the Theogony and which there fore probably influenced the Theogony are two of them. These I dis cussed together with others in TAPA 1961, and there they were read by Professor Erbse, but all he can find to say by way of criticism is "Der Verfasser muss jedoch mit zwei Vorlagen rechnen und gibt selbst zu (519), dass seine These Einw?nden offen ist" (7). Actually what I was speaking about should not be called "Vorlagen," but "Quellen," and if we count Homer I have to reckon with three sources, not two; and if I had to speak of four or five it would not bother me in the least, as long as there seemed reason to think that four or five existed. On page 519 I do indeed grant that my thesis is open to objections (as theses are wont to be), and on page 520 I go to some trouble to answer these objections. Kurt von Fritz suggests that the emasculation scene prepares us for Zeus' reign, in two ways: we learn that intellectual power (here of an admittedly low order) will overcome brute force, and we are given a forerunner for Zeus, orderer and dispenser, in the merely crafty Cronus. This, of course, does not explain the means chosen, castration, but quite apart from that it stumbles over the fact that the plot is not Cronus' but Gaea's. Cronus was indeed crooked of counsel, as the translators of agkulometes have it, but this was not the occasion on which he dis played this gift: "And she set before him the whole plot" (175). Professor von Fritz too has his reasons for the joining of the birth of Aphrodite to the emasculation of Uranus. Both tales are pre Hesiodic (13, 18-9); the author does not decide whether Hesiod or a</page><page sequence="32">William Sale 699 predecessor did the joining (26), but Hesiod chose this instead of the Homeric version because he wanted Aphrodite to belong to the second generation. For in that generation are to be found qualities which Zeus recognized as good and secured for his own regime. Aphrodite, as goddess of beauty, fits this scheme admirably; Zeus can, as it were, examine the idea of beauty and select it for his own, an opportunity which would have been denied him had Aphrodite been his daughter. An attractive idea, acceptable for others of the second generation, but all wrong here: Aphrodite's role in the Theogony is thoroughly and painstakingly defined, and she is not the goddess of beauty, except inso far as beauty is one part of the act of love. 3</page></plain_text>
