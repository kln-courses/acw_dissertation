Reviewed by MICHAEL MOERMAN University of California, Los Angeles This book has two parts, and each part has four chapters. The first chapter describes the physical and demographic aspects of Bang Chan, once a village and now an in- dustrialized suburb in Central Thailand, and compares it with places more familiar to American undergraduates in such a way that life there retains its peculiar local character, but without exotic preciousness. The second and third chapters display an elegant com- mand of the history and biology of rice ex- pressed in properly (because of the use of native metaphor) anthropomorphic terms. They are a strong and lovely evocation of the vast and impersonal forces that make plants and soil. With no loss of the sense of complicated interrelationships, Hanks cuts through masses of detailed knowledge. The concluding chapter of this part both defines his critical ecological concept, "the holding," and provides pithy expression of the knowledge and perceptions of farmers. It also attempts, not too successfully I think, to formalize and quantify the energy ex- changes of various rice-farming holdings. The book's second half traces the history of Bang Chan as it changed from a settle- ment of pioneering "shifting cultivators" to broadcasters, transplanters, and finally occa- sional farmers. Its model of adaptation is quite interesting. The basic adaptive unit is the household. It preserves the integrity of its functions by using constant principles of recruitment (essentially of conscious reci- procity) so that changing circumstances oc- casion the inclusion of different personnel. Of more immediate relevance to ecology, al- tered types of agricultural production are viewed as the consequences of decisions about production made by households pur- suing their own integrity. This perhaps jus- tifies what would otherwise be solely a fault. Each historical period, "shifting cultiva- tion," "broadcasting," and "transplanting," is used merely as a title of a chapter, with little effort made to trace the relationships between a given form of farming and the social descriptions (e.g., of government, religion, kinship, etc.) presented in that chapter. The consequence, of course, is to assume in advance the conclusion: that the social institutions are adaptations to the form of production. There was a time-between its recording customs and its pursuit of problems, lexi- cons, and things to be counted-when ethnography was concerned with people, with how the culturally mediated world im- pinged upon and was transformed by the perceptions, goals, feelings, and aspirations of recognizably human beings. Ethnography was then an heroic, humane, and very per- sonal enterprise-an art, not a craft. Its tools were the ethnographer's character and re- sponsiveness that made natives open and truthful, the empathy that permitted under- standing, the cultivation of mind that en- abled him to see implications for humanity, the alert sensitivity that captured isolated moments as illustrations of underlying pat- terns and historical processes, and his literary genius for synthesizing and con- the author weaves such diverse -threads as newspaper reportage, census material, diaries, and travel accounts into a coherent if uninspired tapestry of the Negro social scene. Thus he achieves his goal of providing "a standard by which scholars can compare Negro life in other Southern cities" (p. xvi). The chapter on race relations reveals the inconsistent segregation practices and sexual anxieties of the white populace. Professor Blassingame believes that it was the fear of black men marrying their daughters that "lay at the foundation of almost all white op- position to the Negroes' acquisition of civil and political rights" (p. 204). In evaluating the period, he emphasizes the Negroes' com- mitment to educating their children. While he sees some success in the economic realm during the period, more than in the political, he considers the development of increasingly stable Negro family life most noteworthy. A helpful bibliographic discussion concludes this contribution to black history. A Residence of Eleven Years in New Holland and the Caroline Islands. JAMES F. O'CON- NELL. Saul H. Riesenberg, ed.

Ori- ginal ed., 1836.] Reviewed by ERNEST S. DODGE Peabody Museum, Salem Nineteenth century Pacific Islands beach- combers have, in the rather remarkable number of books that have come from their pens, contributed to our knowledge of South Sea Islanders out of all proportion to their relative place in the population. But their writings must be used with care. These men were sailors, and a good story lost nothing in the telling. James F. O'Connell, a sailor, possibly an ex-convict, and in his later years a side show tattooed man, was one of these characters. His account of his residence after shipwreck on the island of Ponape has long been a classic reference, for it contains some of the earliest known records of the life and customs of Caroline Islanders based on an extended visit. As in all such accounts, how- ever, and perhaps more in O'Connell's than most, there was always the problem of separating wheat from chaff. Fortunately this has now been done for us by an expert. Dr. Saul H. Riesenberg's Introduction provides a lucid and learned account of the publication of the first edition of the book. He believes, with good reason, that the editor of the 1836 edition was a Boston writer and editor named Horatio Hastings Weld. He also believes that James O'Connell, who remains an elusive character, was not the adventurer's real name, although he has been unable to turn up any other after ex- haustive research. O'Connell apparently lived on Ponape for over five years. The exact date of his ship- wreck is obscure, but his rescue by Captain John B. Knight in the brig Spy in November 1833 is definite, for Knight's journal still exists. During that lengthy residence O'Con- nell, in addition to being tattooed, was adopted by a chief, married his daughter, fathered two children, and became a chief himself. He consistently gives himself and his benefactor a higher social standing than they evidently had. His recollection of the geogra- phy of Ponape is frequently confusing. But his observations of native life, customs, and material culture are usually accurate al- though sometimes misunderstood. Many of his observations are on customs that vanished shortly after his stay on the island. This text then, illuminated by the dis- cerning footnotes of Dr. Riesenberg, is a valuable ethnographic document containing eye-witness accounts of many interesting facets of Ponapean life not recorded else- where.</page></plain_text>
