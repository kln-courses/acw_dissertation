<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of World Prehistory, VoL 17, No. 2, June 2003 (? 2003) One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger Anne C. Haour12 This paper considers, under rough chronological headings, work undertaken in Niger in the past century. Sites relevant to the Pleistocene occupation of the Sahara, to the adoption of elements of a "Neolithic package," to the (perhaps misleadingly late) occupation of the Sahel, to alleged metalworking3000years ago, and to social complexity, are described and discussed. These data carry a relevance far beyond their immediate area, and the most fruitful application of the archaeology of Niger is to be found in theoretical rethinking. KEY WORDS: Niger, Sahel; Aterian; pottery; early metalworking; Sahara. INTRODUCTION A few self-evident facts characterize the archaeology of Niger. The country is vast and sparsely populated: larger than Great Britain, France and Germany combined, but with 15 times fewer people. It is also marked by a climatic regime alternating between hot winds and torrential rains, on annual, centennial and millennial scales. Much archaeological evidence has been deflated to surface scatters, and the sites researched are widely dis persed, their interlinkages unclear. The stark division of the known archaeological record of Niger first outlined by Mauny (1949) over 50 years ago remains true. The northern, Saharan half of the country is best known for its prehistoric sites, the south ern half for its protohistorical settlements. Hie archaeology of these two parts is approached with different research agendas: the Saharan regions in vestigated by prehistorians, generally using models of changing relationships 1 School of Archaeology, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom. 2To whom correspondence should be addressed at Hertford College, Oxford OX13BW, United Kingdom; e-mail: anne.haour@hertford.ox.acuk. 181 0892-7537/03/0600-0181/0 ? 2003 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">182 Haour between people and environment, the Sahelian parts the preserve of histo ries of metal-using populations, often backed by written records. In between remains a gap both chronological and geographical, a considerable obstacle to knowledge of Niger's past. The period ca. 4500-2000 bp, during which climate took on its current regime and modern inhabitants of Niger settled in the spatial and economic configurations they now occupy, remains ob scure. Spatially, the Sahel, the strip of land where the tree savanna meets the desert, remains poorly understood, a "parent pauvre" in Vernet's (1996, p. 38) terms. RAINFALL AND PEOPLE Roughly speaking, modern Niger is Saharan north of the town of Agades, Sahelian south of it, and vegetation cover increases as one moves southwards. The Sahel (Fig. 1) consists essentially of shrub savanna; rainfall, concentrated in the summer months, is typically irregular, and settlement clusters around temporary water sources. The Niger River (Fig. 2) is the only permanent watercourse. Modern subsistence and social values center on cul tivation (principally sorghum?Sorghum bicolor?and millet?Pennisetum Fig. L The Sahel, near the Nigerian border, summer 1999.</page><page sequence="3">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 183 Fig. 2.

Supplementing domestic crops is the gathering of wild or semiwild grasses and of the fruits and leaves of trees (Connah, 1981; Smith, 1992). The Sahara Desert supports only small human populations, practicing mobile pastoralism and irrigated cultivation near wells. The Air massif (Fig. 3), which due to its high relief attracts in creased rainfall, is the principal focus of modern settlement; west of it are the stony flatlands of Azawagh, and eastward the sand plains and high dunes of the T6n6r6 desert (Fig. 4). The modern landscape of Niger is the end product of a gradual process of desiccation begun some 7500 years ago (Camps, 1974; Grove and Street, 1979; Mclntosh, 1993; Roset, 1987a; Smith, 1992; Vernet, 2002). A humid period, starting about 12,000 years ago, culminating 9000-8000 years ago, and marked by lower temperatures and increased, probably more regular, rainfall is attested in areas as far afield as the Tibesti (Chad-Libya border), the Hoggar (Algeria), T6n6r? (Niger), and Chad (Grove and Street, 1979; Person and Qu6chon, 1997a; Roset, 1983, 1987a,b; Smith, 1992; Williams, 1973,1976). The now arid Saharan massif of Adrar Bous basked in a subhu mid Mediterranean climate, bodies of fresh, cold water appeared throughout the T?n6r6, and rainwater draining from the Saharan massifs swelled now defunct river systems such as the Azawagh and the T?n6r6 Tafasaset (Camps,</page><page sequence="4">184 Haour Fig. 3. Air massif, south of Timia, summer 1999. 1974; Martinez and Qu?zel, 1962; Paris, 1996; Roset, 1983,1987a,b; Talbot, 1980). The known archaeological record of Niger consists of a series of punctu ated episodes of past human activity, separated by poorly understood gaps. West African climate is affected by a wide range of factors both local and global, while rainfall patterns are highly variable over both time and space (Grove, 1993; Klaus, 1979; Nicholson, 1983; Vernet, 2002). Problematically, both the impact of broad climatic changes on events at a human scale, and the effect of anthropic pressures on the landscape, remain poorly understood (Gritzner, 1988; Smith, 1980; Vernet, 2002; Williams, 1976). Climatic changes affecting past human settlement were probably extremely rapid, localized, and changeable. Water availability may have varied considerably through out the Sahara and Sahel on the basis of local factors such as altitude or geology (Camps, 1974; Roset, 1987a; Smith, 1980; Vernet, 2002). For specific periods or areas, the reader is referred to the vast and occasionally contra dictory literature (Gritzner, 1988; Grove, 1993; Klaus, 1979; Paris etal, 1993; Talbot, 1980). To the past peoples concerned, long-term changes in climate, and subse quent shifts in settlement and subsistence, may have been gradual and barely</page><page sequence="5">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 185 Fig. 4.

Connah (1981, p. 17) has described as the "bellows model" the postulate that the Sahara forces peo ple and animals "[southwards] during periods of climatic deterioration and equally sucks them back in again during brief periods of climatic ameliora tion." This pattern underpins the archaeology of Niger. Makers of Acheulean bif aces, of Aterian points, or of microlithic hunting implements; cattle, sheep, and goat pastoralists, builders of monumental funerary structures and Hausa warlords are all said to have migrated southwards in the face of increasing desiccation. All dates cited in this text are approximate uncalibrated radiocarbon years. Reservations have been expressed on the reliability of different mate rials for dating and of samples often from little depth in a landscape marked by transient human groups (see Killick, 1987; Mclntosh and Mclntosh, 1986; Paris, 1996; Vernet, 1996). These issues are not discussed further here, but it is considered that radiocarbon readings are best understood as providing an indicative, relative chronological framework rather than absolute ages. It is in this spirit that Table I is provided.</page><page sequence="6">Table I.

PALEOLITHIC TYPOLOGIES "All of the Paleolithic study of Niger remains to be done," wrote Mauny in 1949 (p. 145; my translation); the situation has improved a little since. The most significant recent finding has been that Pleistocene human settlement of Niger was not, as previously assumed, limited to the Saharan portion of</page><page sequence="22">202 Haour the country. Survey work by Vernet (1996) and Id6 (2000) demonstrated that Paleolithic industries occur in some abundance in the southwest of Niger, especially on the right bank of the Niger River, the most extensive deposits being along the Mekrou affluent (see also Marchesseau, 1966, who had noted the occurrence of plentiful and widespread Paleolithic material on the Benin side of this river). These typically occur as surface scatters, some of which are in situ sites exposed by erosion. They are undated and, because of the widespread use of quartz and quartzite, typological definition is difficult. Only the Acheulean has been recognized with confidence; other implements are attributed either to a "Middle Paleolithic," dominated by Levallois tech nique, or to a "recent Paleolithic," the assumption being that implement size reduces with time while retouching increases (Id6,2000; Vernet, 1996). The later phases of Pleistocene occupation of the area therefore remain un clear, but the demonstration has been clearly made that the lack of recorded Paleolithic sites in the Sahelian half of Niger was an artifact of researchers' interest rather than an accurate reflection of the archaeological record. In the Sahara too erosion and deflation are widespread. Little can be said about the unstudied and context-less pebble tools reported in gravel terraces towards the Libyan and Chadian borders (Dalloni, 1948; Davies, 1967; De Beauchene, 1969). Finds of Acheulean-type bifaces, sporadically reported by colonial troops patrolling the desert (Dalloni, 1948; Mauny, 1949; Vaufrey, 1969), were first collated by the 1959-1960 scientific expedi tion Mission Berliet Tenere (Hugot, 1962). An increasing number of localities for Acheulean material have since been documented, but context remains problematic. Tools characteristically occur either as surface finds, or eroded and rolled in stratigraphic layers which are clearly not their primary con text (Maley etal., 1971; Qu?chon, 1983; Qu6chon and Roset, 1974; Williams, 1976). Regional patterns may have already existed, with different popu lations developing preferred methods of manufacture for bifaces, but full regional surveys, the excavation of primary occupation sites, and detailed studies remain to be undertaken (Clark, 1973b, 1980). The only quantitative survey of Acheulean material in Niger of which I am aware involved three 30 x 30 m areas of surface material compacted by deflation at a former lake shore at Adrar Bous (Clark, 1973a, 1980) (Fig. 6). The scatter was charac terized by large, finely finished cutting tools frequently involving Levallois preparation for the removal of long quadrilateral flakes, and a scarcity of waste material suggesting implements had been manufactured elsewhere, presumably in the central Adrar Bous massif, and brought down to the lake for use (Clark, 1973a, 1980) (Fig. 7). For the Middle Paleolithic, the Aterian, a Saharan and northern African industry characterized by bifacial foliates and pedunculated tools (presum ably designed for hafting), occurs in Niger in surface deposits or</page><page sequence="23">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 203 stratigraphically secure but reworked layers throughout the Tenere, for ex ample at Adrar Bous, Seguedine, Izouzadene, Merguigara, and Amakon (Baumhauer et al, 1997; Clark, 1973a, 1980,1993; Hugot, 1962; Maley et al, 1971; Tillet, 1989). At Adrar Bous, Aterian finds were of such high craftsman ship that Hugot (1963, p. 50, my translation) called them "the most beautiful Saharan Aterian facies so far known" (Fig. 8). The question of the age of these industries is a difficult one. Aterian deposits of Niger are often sandwiched between sterile layers, as at Amakon and Adrar Bous (Clark, 1980; Maley et al, 1971). This is a reflection of the situation in the Sahara generally, where Aterian artifacts are marked by heavy deflation, polishing and resorting of artifacts, and typically lack stylis tic or stratigraphic continuity with both preceding and succeeding industries (Camps, 1974; Camps etal, 1968; Ferring, 1975; Wrinn and Rink, 2003). Two radiometric datings relating to Aterian deposits in Niger are available. Pos sible precursors, involving pieces with slightly narrowed bases obtained by retouch on alternate faces, antedate 33,000 bp near Bilma (Baumhauer etal, 1997; Maley et al, 1971; Tillet, 1989), while a travertine around 19,000 years old containing reworked pedunculated pieces at the Air site of Ekouloulef provides a minimum age (Morel, 1983; Tillet, 1989). Typologically and tech nologically, the Adrar Bous pieces appear closest to the latest Aterian phases</page><page sequence="24">Haour Fig. 7.

Hugot (1966,1967) suggested that Niger sites such as Seguedine and Adrar Bous represented both the southernmost and the latest expan sion of Aterian toolmakers from the Mediterranean shores, stopped by large</page><page sequence="25">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 205 Fig. 8. Aterian point from Adrar Bous, site IVb. (After Tixier, 1962, Fig. 4.) marshy expanses in the Lake Chad area perhaps as late as 8000 years ago (see also Debenath, 1992). Tillet (1989) attributed an age of some 20,000 30,000 years to the Aterian of Niger, as did Clark (1973a) at the time of the original excavations of Adrar Bous. However, Aterian beginnings may well be considerably older judging by ages obtained in other parts of the Sahara and Maghreb. Readings of 35,000-60,000 bp near Tangier (Morocco), over 44,000 years in the Western</page><page sequence="26">206 Haour Desert (Egypt), 50,000-70,000 at the Uan Tabu rockshelter in the Tadrart Acacus (Libya), all suggest that at least part of the Aterian facies lies be yond the range of radiocarbon dating and will be pushed ever farther back in time by use of TL and OSL (Wendorf and Schild, 1980 and Wendorf et al.,1987, for Egypt; Cremaschi et al91998 and Barich et al, in press, for the Libyan Sahara; Wrinn and Rink, 2003, for Morocco). On the basis of these data, both Clark (1993) and Wrinn and Rink (2003, p. 124) have re vised the age proposed for the Adrar Bous Aterian material, suggesting the Middle Paleolithic there covers a long period of time, perhaps matching the Aterian of Tadrart Acacus. It is not clear, either, whether the Aterian toolmakers were the last Pale olithic occupants of Niger. Examining two surface exposures at Adrar Bous and a deflating terrace feature at Greboun, Clark (1976) identified an Epi paleolithic industry characterized by specialized forms of retouched blades and bladelets (including the [often asymmetrically] tanged Ounan point) and by the absence of microlithic pieces. Clark (1973a, 1976) proposes, prin cipally on the basis of the occurrence of Ounan points, that the Adrar Bous and Greboun assemblages represent the tail end of a general phenomenon of diffusion of northern blade industries throughout the Sahara, beginning some time after 12,000 years ago; the (undated) Adrar Bous and Greboun evidence is thought to be some 8000 years old. The cultural affiliation of the people who employed this Epipaleolithic toolkit remains unknown and the hypothesis of a long post-Aterian hiatus would invalidate any argument for population continuity between the two groups. Moreover, the recognition of this Epipaleolithic has been controversial. Baumhauer etal. (1997) accept the notion, but failed to recover any similar evidence in their investigations. A serious challenge has been posed by Roset (1983 especially), who argues that Ounan points were first put into use in the Saharan zone of Niger by a pottery-making and, ironically, earlier, society than Clark had originally proposed. A similar association of pottery with Ounan points and bone har poons is reported farther to the south, for instance at Tamaya Mellet and Takene Bawat, surface sites established on dunes near the main course of the now fossil Azawagh river (Durand and Paris, 1986; Hugot, 1963; Kelley, 1934; Lhote, 1936; Maga, 1993; Paris et al,1993), and in Mali (Petit-Maire et al, in Mclntosh and Mclntosh, 1986, p. 421). On this basis Mclntosh and Mclntosh (1986, p. 421) write that "Clearly, a number of our existing re constructions of the early Holocene prehistory of the Sahara need careful reexamination." However, in reply to this Smith (1993) has argued that the site sampled by Roset in fact consisted of a mix of artifacts from different periods, as suggested by the coexistence of presumably functionally identical Ounan points and microliths, and by the nature of the pottery; he argues for the integrity of the Greboun assemblage.</page><page sequence="27">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 207 Consisting primarily of surface scatters, sometimes heavily deflated by erosion, the Paleolithic evidence of Niger leaves a wide margin for interpre tation, and has been approached mainly with an eye to classificatory frame works. Entities broadly similar in technology or in typology are defined on the basis of the presence or absence of specific artifact types (Clark, 1980, p. 531). The focus is implicitly or explicitly evolutionist, with the assump tion that lithic complexity will increase over time, as the primary means for human populations to adapt to their environment (see Camps, 1974; Hugot, 1962; Quechon and Roset, 1974; Tixier, 1962). Settlement dynam ics, economic basis, and social organization have received less attention (Mclntosh and Posnansky, 1976). As a result it remains largely unknown whether modifications in toolkits reflect occupational specialization, chang ing populations, diachronic trends, raw material selection, or combinations thereof. The reason for the numerous "gaps" in the archaeological record of the Sahara remains unclear: abandonment of these areas by past inhabitants during arid periods, or incomplete sampling? There can be no substitute for stratigraphically controlled and extensive excavation of archaeological sites, coupled with increasing paleoenvironmental evidence to clarify precisely how arid and therefore inhospitable the Sahara desert became. FROM EXTRACTIVE TO PRODUCTIVE? THE FIRST POTTERS The different strands involved in a Neolithic way of life?pottery, ground stone tools, increasing sedentism, active curation of stock and crops?find variable and/or independent expression in African contexts (Goodwin, 1925 in Hugot, 1967, pp. 529-530; Barich, 1980; Breunig and Neumann, 2002; Camps, 1974; Maga, 1993; Smith, 1980,1992), and the Niger evidence con firms the need for fine-grained models. Pottery was made early and skillfully in Air and the adjacent lowlands. Both at Tagalagal, a small rockshelter perched high in Air, and at Adrar Bous, in situ levels yielded potsherds and charcoal fragments returning ra diocarbon ages in the range of 9500 to 9000 years, supported by TL and paleoenvironmental datings (Mori, 1998; Roset, 1987a,b; Roset etal, 1990). This early date is confirmed indirectly by the recovery of a presumed potters' comb of similar age at Temet, near Greboun (Roset, 1983,1987b) and is in line with evidence from a broad range of sites across the central Sahara and Nile Valley: Tin Torha in the Libyan Sahara (Barich, 1980,1987), Launey in the Algerian Hoggar (Maitre, in Roset, 1987b), Amekni (Hoggar), Gabrong (Sudan), and up and down the Nile from Shabona (Sudan) to Fayum (Egypt) (Close, 1995; see her Fig. 3.1). Pottery may also antedate 9000 bp at Tamaya Mellet in the Azawagh, although this rests on a single mid-tenth millennium</page><page sequence="28">208 Haour bp date which has been the subject of harsh discussion ever since its publica tion when it was rejected as "too old" (Delibrias et al, 191 A, p. 44). Together with pottery or indirect evidence of pottery, the in situ layers at Adrar Bous, Temet, and Tagalagal contain flakes and grinding stones; at the two former sites, Roset (1983,1987a,b) reports the coexistence of a blade and bladelet industry, including the supposedly Epipaleolithic Ounan points discussed above, and of microliths and bifacial points. The surprising feature of the pottery of Tagalagal and Adrar Bous is that even at such an early phase techniques of manufacture appear fully mastered. A variety of vessel shapes and of impressed overall decorations is reported, evocative of the designs that would prevail over the following millennia in the T n r (Roset, 1978,1983,1987b, 1989). It is not known who the mak ers were and where they came from. No burials have been recovered and, as elsewhere in the Sahara, these precocious potters appear as new immi grants (Close, 1995, p. 26; Paris, 1996). And although pottery is traditionally associated with a complex suite of population and behavioral changes (see Haaland, 1995), dietary evidence remains sketchy of the context of Niger. No faunal remains are reported from the in situ layers at Adrar Bous, Tagalagal, and Temet, but indirect evidence does suggest a wetter, greener environment providing considerable hunting and fishing resources. Surface evidence from Adrar Bous, which Roset et al. (1990, p. 84) are confident belongs at least in part to the period attested in the in situ layers, documents freshwater fish, terrestrial mammals (buffalo, gazelle, warthog...), and crocodiles. Un equivocal evidence of hunting comes from in situ layers at Tin Ouaffadene nearby. These contained no pottery, but radiocarbon readings and lithic simi larities (notably the coexistence of grinding equipment, blades and bladelets, and microliths) suggest an age similar to Tagalagal and Adrar Bous (Roset, 1987a,b; Roset et al., 1990). The burnt bones of elephants, African buffalo, several types of antelope, and a land tortoise mingled with mollusk shells and large and plentiful pieces of charcoal (Roset et al., 1990). Clearly, then, fish and game were important sources of nourishment, while grinding ma terials suggest the processing of vegetal matter, but whether gathered or cultivated remains uncertain (Roset et al., 1990, p. 68). The association of the early pottery with a lacustrine economy is also found in other parts of the Sahara; again, the potential offered by pottery for boiling foods may have been significant (Barich, 1980; Clark, 1980; Smith, 1980,1992; Sutton, 1977). Of relevance to food procurement strategies is the issue of territorial range. Petrographic analysis of 35 sherds showed that the Tagalagal mate rial issued from clays within a range of 30-70 km, while the Adrar Bous pottery was even more local, arguing for a prolonged, if not permanent, oc cupation of the site and some degree of territoriality (Echallier and Roset,</page><page sequence="29">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 209 1986; Roset, 1987a). Moreover, human occupation was apparently well es tablished. Extensive surface scatters north of Adrar Bous in a band 100-km long are reported; one site extends over 6 km, with a density of lithics, tools, points, grinding stones and sherds which is "absolument etonnante" (Roset, 1983, p. 134; see also Roset, 1987b). Their repeated occurrence and their similarity both to one another and to the excavated sites of Tin Ouaffadene, Adrar Bous, and Temet are considered indications of the integrity of these as yet uninvestigated surface sites (Roset, 1983), but plainly these should be a priority for further research, for their scale and density will provide important clues to subsistence regimes. Layers of diatomites seal the evidence of the early potters at Temet and Adrar Bous, indicating the onset of wet conditions and higher lake levels (Roset, 1983,1987b). The assumption that the Sahara was then an attrac tive environment for settlement by fishing, hunting, and potting peoples is stymied by the archaeological evidence. There is just one radiocarbon date testifying to human activity in Niger between 9000 and 7000 years ago, from a hearth at Tamaya Mellet (Paris, 1996; Paris et al, 1993; Roset, 1987a; Vernet, 1993). The scarcity of archaeological evidence is puzzling. The first part of this period was one of high lake levels when the Sahara, at least, must have been a congenial living environment, even if an overly wet Sahel was unattractive. Conversely, in the latter part of this period arid condi tions would have made life difficult for the hunting-fishing potters of the Sahara, possibly pushing them out entirely (Roset, 1987a; Smith, 1992), but the Sahel would have provided a useful refuge. The explanation for the ar chaeological blank of the period 9000-7000 bp is most plausibly explained by postdepositional factors. In wet periods natural forces may bury traces of former settlement?at Tin Ouaffadene, a pneumatic drill was necessary to dislodge overlying diatomites (Roset etal, 1990)?or destroyed them (as Lhote, 1936, and Paris, 1996, suggested of the flooding Azawagh). Environ mental destruction would be compounded by human activities. Person and Qu6chon (1997b p. 26) noted, during a visit they made to the Termit mas sif in one year of good rains, that favorable climatic considerations caused the wider dispersion of gazelle herds; they propose that the same principle operated on humans, thus decreasing archaeological visibility. At the same time, the successive occupation of preferred localities may have obliterated the earliest evidence. Paris et al (1993, p. 390) suggest this may lie at the root of the problem in identifying early Holocene human settlement in the Azawagh, suspected but not yet proven. The situation is paralleled at simi lar latitudes in neighboring Mali (Mclntosh and Mclntosh, 1986; Paris et al.&gt; 1993). As for the Sahel, it is only much later that clear indications of human occupation appear, as will be discussed below.</page><page sequence="30">210 Haour THE KEEPERS OF CATTLE The in situ living floor at Dogonboulo, in the T n r , includes fish bone, hearths, grinding stone fragments, flakes, and pottery, and at close to 7000 years of age was for a time the oldest known technologically Neolithic site of Niger (Maley et aL, 1971; Roset, 1974,1987a). The earliest human remains, unfortunately without associated settlement evidence, also date from around this time: a tightly flexed adult, wearing a possible ostrich eggshell necklace, buried in a pit at Iwelen in Air (Paris, 1996). An exciting development in this time frame is the new importance of cattle. Excavation of small stone tumuli at Adrar Bous by Roset and Paris uncovered not the human burials expected, but charred and dismembered bovid remains (Paris, 2000; Roset, 1987a). These pits, dated to around 6300 6200 years ago, are ambiguous. Younger but similar features at Adrar Bous had been interpreted by Clark (1973b), Carter and Clark (1976), and Smith (1980) as the remains of meals thrown back into the hearths in which they had cooked. Paris (1996,2000), however, believes they reflect ritual butchery and purposeful offering, and thus indirect evidence for domestication. Similar features of around the same age at Nabta in the Egyptian desert left the excavators in no doubt that they were part of a ceremonial complex (Wendorf and Schild, 1998, pp. 108-110). Morphologically domesticated cattle are evidenced around 6000-5000 years ago both at Takene Bawat in the Azawagh in the form of bones erod ing out of a dated sediment (Maga, 1993; Paris et aL, 1993) and, in much more complete form, at Adrar Bous, where the nearly complete, articulated skeleton of a domestic cow is thought to represent a local domestication of wild cattle (Clark, 1973b; Carter and Clark, 1976). The origin of the domestic cattle of Africa remains a contentious issue, the debate centering on the likelihood of an indigenous domestication of North African cattle (as genetic evidence seems to imply) versus an introduc tion from the Near East (see Bradley et aL, 1996; Gautier, 1987; Hassan, 2000; Hanotte et aL, 2002; Wendorf and Schild, 1998). Tenth and ninth millennium bp contexts in the Egyptian desert (Bir Kiseiba and Nabta) have produced "exciting although troublesome large bovids" (Gautier, 1987, p. 180). These are argued, essentially on ecological grounds, to have been domesticated or at least kept by humans as a reliable food source; but these dates are rather exceptional and domestic cattle are only consistently present in Saharan sites from about 6500 bp (Gautier, 1987; Hassan, 2000; Wendorf and Schild, 1998). If substantiated, the discovery of bones of domesticated cattle in the Azawagh would challenge the traditional north-south diachronic trend, which would have pastoralists moving south in the face of increasing desic cation to reach these latitudes only 4000 years ago (see Holl, 1998, and Van</page><page sequence="31">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 211 Neer, 2002, for example), but there is as yet no convincingly secure context for these finds. In Niger, the best-known culture following the first appearance of do mestic cattle is the Tenerean, taking its name from its distribution throughout the now deserted expanses of the T6n6r6. Its best known sites are alongside the Air massif, at Adrar Bous and Areschima (Clark, 1973b; Davies, 1967; Hugot, 1962; Joubert and Vaufrey, 1941-1946; Paris, 1996; Roset, 1977a, 1987a; Vaufrey, 1969) but variant, related facies are also reported from Termit (Hugot, 1962; Maga, 1993; Paris, 1996; QuSchon, 1980,1983,1986) and from both inside Air and from its western side (Calvocoressi and David, 1979; Lhote, 1979; Roset, 1987a; Smith, 1980). Dates range typically from 5500 to just under 4000 years ago, with the Tenerean-looking scatters of Termit and Arlit weighing in slightly later at 3200-2600 years ago (Calvocoressi and David, 1979; Clark, 1973b; Delibrias et al, 1974; Delibrias and Hugot, 1962; Paris, 1996; Qu&lt;?chon, 1983, 1986; Roset, 1987a). This characteristic cultural assemblage, known since the 1930s (Joubert and Vaufrey, 1941-1946; Tixier, 1962), was formally defined as a result of the Mission Berliet Tenere's collection at Adrar Bous (Fig. 9). Hugot (1962, p. 156, my translation) had been enthralled, writing of this "singular and magnificent panoply." The most characteristic tools are thin disks, arrow heads and polished stone implements with convex sides and a beveled edge, usually called adzes although their function remains unknown (Tixier, 1962). Pottery vessels typically have round bases and short or nonexistent necks, and are decorated overall with comb impressions resembling wavy lines, points, or geometric motifs such as fish scales (Clark, 1973b; Hugot, 1962; Paris, 1996; Roset, 1978; Tixier, 1962). Such decorative motifs echo those used some 4000 years earlier at Tagalagal and at Adrar Bous which, as pos sible evidence of cultural continuity, is of course relevant to the issue of the 9000-7000 bp "silence" discussed above (Paris, 1996; Roset, 1987b). Pol ished stone items, pigments, drills, serrated bone points, and ostrich eggshell beads occur on sites of Tenerean affiliation (Clark, 1973b; Smith, 1980), and graves?both simple pit burials and stone platform tombs?have been in vestigated at Adrar Bous. These were generally poor in goods, the only items recovered being shreds of leather (perhaps emphasizing a connection with cattle-keeping), potsherds, flakes of stone, and occasional beads of steatite, quartz or ostrich eggshell (Clark, 1973b; Paris, 1996; Smith, 1992, 2000). The relationship of these tombs to the Tenerean toolmakers is problematic; the burials fall within the time-range of the Tenerean, and occur in close proximity to their sites, so that identity is usually assumed. However, Paris (1996) remarks that the occurrence of stone-built platform tombs at Adrar Bous may reflect not just differences in status, translated in death through</page><page sequence="32">212 Haour Fig. 9.

The economic basis and settlement pattern of the Tenereans are un clear but, as noted above, territorial extent and subsistence regime serve as mutual clues. Do the abundant remains of the Tenereans represent perma nently settled and therefore presumably numerous peoples? Or successive seasonal occupations, perhaps short halts, by mobile groups? Answers will come through the resolution of the issue of the Tenerean diet. Hugot (1962, p. 163, my translation) considered their adzes and grindstones to be indicative</page><page sequence="33">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 213 of "a rather intense agricultural life," but despite tantalizing and very rare finds of possible ard-tips (Milburn, 1989; Milburn and Rees, 1984) and a now disproved domesticated sorghum imprint on a sherd from Adrar Bous (Stemler, 1980), the organized manipulation of plants and their ultimate do mestication by the Tenereans remain undocumented. Grinding stones are too numerous to have served only for pigments, but could reflect the process ing of wild grains. The recovery in the T6n6r6 of an intact vessel filled with the seeds of the Celtis tree was interpreted by Martinez and Quezel (1962, pp. 325-326) as symptomatic of precarious conditions of life?quite at vari ance is Camps' (1974, p. 230) comment that Celtis may have been fermented and drunk! At the same time, the continuing proportion of wild fauna (an telopes, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, fish...) in contexts where domesticated cattle are also present demonstrates that there was no quick shift from wild to domesticated resources (Clark, 1973b; Hugot, 1962; Maga, 1993; Paris et al, 1993; Smith, 1980,1992). The speculation will only end with the excavation of a well-preserved Tenerean context involving flotation programs. But the transfer between different subsistence regimes, or the coexistence of what are theoretically seen as different regimes, seems documented archaeolog ically (Barich, 1987; Person and Qu6chon, 1997b) and should come as no surprise given that it is evident amongst the pastoralists and cultivators of modern West Africa (Connah, 1981,2001; Mclntosh, 1994; Neumann, 1999; Smith, 1992). The Tenerean settlement appears to have been spatially structured. At Adrar Bous, distinct toolworking, cooking and pottery areas, and stone circles and semicircles interpreted as anchors for light shelters or storage structures were identified (Clark, 1973b). At Areschima and Termit, con centrations of axes, blades, adzes or scrapers occur in distinct scatters or piles; at Termit at least some of these are thought to be ancient caches, buried in a now decayed container and revealed by erosion (Maley et 0/., 1971; Quechon, 1986; Qu6chon and Roset, 1974). Qu6chon (1986) demon strated through refitting that blade tools were produced quickly, economi cally, and skillfully, which would be of value to a population on the move and may also point to specialization and exchange. Hugot (1962), noting the vast numbers of identical artifacts at some Tenerean sites, had also argued for complementary links. Given that raw material selection is apparent in Aterian toolmaking (Clark, 1980), that this pattern should be found in much later Tenerean societies is more than likely. The wide spread of the Tenerean industries must not, however, obscure their variability. Even its first analysts (Hugot, 1962) commented on the lack of any real type-site. The original definition of the Tenerean lithic as semblage by Tixier (1962) has also been modified, for instance with regard to microlithic elements which Smith (1973,1976,1993) and Roset (1987a)</page><page sequence="34">214 Haour see as precursors to, rather than components of, the Tenerean, going out of fashion when the large tools of the classic Tenerean make their appearance. The fundamental definitional difficulty of the Tenerean is that this assem blage is known only from surface scatters. The precise nature of its supposed "offshoots," specifically those of Termit and of western Air, is murky. For example, in situ contexts at Arlit provided artifacts related to the Tenerean and evidence of a heavy reliance on domesticated stock, but also dates span ning the period 5300-2600 bp (Lhote, 1979; Mclntosh and Posnansky, 1976; Smith, 1980,1992), which makes relation to sites such as Adrar Bous diffi cult to grasp. Furthermore, other Neolithic communities appear to have been active around this time, and their possible connections to the Tenerean tool makers remain as obscure today as 50 years ago when Mauny (1949) wrote, without the benefit of absolute dating techniques, of the need to relate these different facies. The constructors of large funerary platforms and tumuli at the Air site of Iwelen, throughout the Tenerean period, remain unidenti fied (Paris, 1996). The site of Madaouela, close to Arlit, was excluded from classification as Tenerean simply because only a single classic Tenerean arti fact, an adze, was recovered there (Bayle des Hermens and Chantret, 1968), while the peoples who inhabited the Azawagh sites of Tamaya Mellet, In Tekebrin, and Takene Bawat (Maga, 1993; Paris, 1996; Paris et ah, 1993) remain unconnected to the Tenerean facies. The approaches advocated by Quechon (1980,1986) at Termit, where typology (and especially the reliance on fossiles directeurs such as adzes) is superseded by the study of site layout in order to gain information on social organization, would help clarify these problems but have been little applied. AN IRRESISTIBLE DRIFT SOUTHWARDS? Towards 4000 years ago, the archaeological picture of Niger changes dramatically. Long-standing sites such as Adrar Bous apparently cease to function as settlement or even as burial places (Clark, 1973b; Paris, 1996). Vast sites (evidenced by pottery scatters, for no dwelling remains survive) such as Chin Tafidet and In Tuduf are manifest in the Agades area and Ighazer (Eghazer), until then archaeologically sparse (Holl, 1998; Paris etal, 1993). Human occupation is, for the first time, documented well into the Sahel, at sites such as Tuizegoru or Kase Gorou (Devisse and Vernet, 1993; Gado et aL, 2000; Vernet, 1993: Fig. 4, 1996). These anecdotal remarks are mirrored on a regional scale. Radiocarbon dates available for Niger, like those from Mali or Chad, show a notable inversion around 4000 bp: the proportion of dates from sites south of 20?N (the latitude of Adrar Bous) increases, while dates from more northern sites become much scarcer</page><page sequence="35">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 215 (Vernet, 1993,1996). Combined with evidence for growing desiccation and the appearance in the Sahel of ceramics of Saharan inspiration, this distri bution paints a picture of southward population movements (Breunig and Neumann, 2002; Mclntosh, 1994; Van Neer, 2002). Why does the Sahel enter the archaeological record of Niger so late? Is the lack of evidence from earlier periods a sampling artifact or was the southern area?and similar latitudes in neighboring countries?truly empty prior to the arrival of more northerly peoples? Diseases, parasites, and in sects in the wet, swampy areas may have proved unattractive or dangerous to humans and their animals (Devisse and Vernet, 1993; Smith, 1980,1992; Van Neer, 2002; Vernet, 1993,1996,2002), but this explanation cannot be pushed too far, considering the archaeologically attested presence of boat-using peoples in the Chad basin 8000 years ago and the lack of linear relationship between ecological constraints and human development in modern Africa (Breunig and Neumann, 2002; Raynaut, 1997; Smith, 1992). What is certain is that the northern latitudes were becoming gradually less appealing. In a few thousand years the limit of the Sahelian vegetation zone in some parts of West Africa shifted perhaps as much as 700 km southwards (Mclntosh and S. Mclntosh, 1988; Petit-Maire and Riser in Grove, 1993). People had to change their way of life or to follow. Between 4000 and 3000 bp, pastoralists and their cattle and caprines are documented in the well-watered basins of the Azawagh and Ighazer (Mclntosh and Mclntosh, 1988; Paris, 1996; Paris et al, 1993). Hunting and fishing remain important (elephants, hippopotami, crocodiles, antelopes, and turtles were recovered at Chin Tafidet), but the so cial value of domesticated stock is also obvious: at Chin Tafidet, In Tuduf and Afunfun bovids and caprines were seemingly sacrificed and buried, either on their own or in human graves (Greb6nart, 1987,1988; Holl, 1998; Paris, 1984,1996,2000; Vernet, 1993). These large (several hundred meters wide) settlements may have been permanent (although seasonal rounds exploiting wild cereals and saline sources are suggested) and some specialists in pottery manufacture (Holl, 1998; Paris, 1984,1996; Paris et al, 1993). Habitation was extensive, judging from surface ceramic scatters: Greb6nart (1987,1988) has reported 120 sites in the area affiliated to the Afunfun/Chin Tafidet fades. Pottery, occurring both in graves and on the settlement area, is very similar to that found on Saharan sites at this time: forms are predominantly closed, spherical, and with rounded bases, and decoration involves overall rocker stamped impressions (impression pivotante) or incisions, undecorated pots being rare (Gr&lt;?b&lt;?nart, 1988; Paris, 1984,1996) (Fig. 10). In parallel, a Sahelian character first becomes evident in pottery tradi tions. A cluster of sites close to Agades but on the southern side of the Tigidit scarp is notable for vessels which are typically globular, taller than wide, and with everted rims; surface treatment is limited to the occasional use of red,</page><page sequence="36">216 Haour Fig. 10.

Grebenart (1985,1987,1988) pro poses there existed a distinctive "Sahelian Neolithic" with the Tigidit scarp marking a limit with its northern neighbors. Farther south still was a ho mogeneous ceramic culture, dubbed "North-East Culture," centering on the Bani Bangou/Tuizegoru area and dated between ca. 3900 and 2900 years ago (Vernet, 1996). This geographically and typologically distinct group, di vided into four distinct ceramic phases, is unfortunately only known through shallow, often reworked deposits with no discernable stratigraphy. Hunting is inferred through the frequent occurrence of arrowheads; agriculture and herding are presumed based on site locations and on the presence of grind ing materials but cannot be demonstrated, since fauna and flora have not</page><page sequence="37">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 217 survived. Most stone appears to have been imported from the north, and in way of life and in artifacts these sites may represent a southern movement of Saharan peoples pushed out by increasing desiccation and positive fac tors such as population expansion (Devisse and Vernet, 1993; Vernet, 1996). Further sites, usually characterized by quartz flaking industries, are reported along the Niger river and in the Mekrou valley; they may belong to this time but are mainly undated (Davies, 1967; De Beauchene, 1969; Gado, 1980; Vernet, 1993,1994). Only one featured a deep stratigraphy?Kirkissoy, near Niamey, dated to around 2800 bp?but it has been destroyed by quarrying (Gado et aL, 2000; Vernet, 1996). Most of these sites probably represented short, perhaps seasonal halts, and were occupied repeatedly through differ ent periods. The Sahelian part of Niger remains better known not for these "Ne olithic" sites but for its unexpectedly early, and as such hotly debated, dates for metal-working. COPPER AND IRON The quest for the earliest dates for copper and iron production domi nates recent writing on the archaeology of Niger. At Afunfun, ages of 4000 2700 bp on a series of baked earth structures, interpreted as furnaces but not associated with any settlement evidence, suggested either independently de veloped copper-working or very early contacts of the Afunfun people with areas such as the Mediterranean or Egypt (Calvocoressi and David, 1979; Gordon et aL, 1988; GrSbenart, 1985,1987,1988; Kense, 1985; Sutton, 1982). The subsequent realization that these dates reflected the use by much later metal-workers of old charcoal inside a burnt-out tree stump renewed aware ness of the problems of fossil wood and of contamination in radiocarbon dating (Gordon et aL, 1988; GrebSnart, 1992-1993, 1995; Mclntosh, 1994; Miller and Van der Merwe, 1994). Some feel, however, that the unfortunate example from Afunfun should not cast a net of suspicion over all indications of early experiments with metallurgy in Niger, and that the usage of old wood cannot explain away all of these sites (Gr6b6nart, 1992-1993; Paris et aL, 1993; Person and Qu6chon, 1997b; Smith, 1992). But stratigraphically controlled excavation on one of these sites (some of which are very deflated), recording the relation of dated charcoal to a metallurgical event, is essen tial. Killick (1987) is of the opinion that the current radiocarbon database is simply inadequate and that attempts to understand the origins of met allurgy will only be successful if thermoluminescence dating is applied, to tuyere fragments for example. No definitive statement can be made on the occurrence of metal implements on surface settlements?copper blades at In Tekebrin, a site dated to over 3500 bp (Paris et aL, 1992,1993); iron objects at</page><page sequence="38">218 Haour Termit Egaro, dated to 4000 bp (Paris et aL91992)?other than to wish that these had been recovered in stratigraphically secure contexts. Skepticism, as advocated by the excavators, is the wisest approach. Data are firmer after 3000 bp, when the evidence for the use of both copper and iron comes from a wide range of sites and environments. A copper-working phase starting around 2800 years ago, and a slightly later phase of iron-working, from around 2400 years ago, are attested in Ighazer and near Afunfun by furnaces, surface settlement evidence, and possibly by small copper, iron, bronze, and brass items of personal adornment in funer ary contexts, although the vast majority of the latter are undated (Gordon et aL91988; Grebenart, 1985,1987,1988; Paris, 1984,1996). Three hundred kilometers to the east, in the Termit massif, dates falling around 3000 2500 bp from sites of Tenerean appearance but including iron objects have been assumed to relate to intrusive charcoal (Calvocoressi and David, 1979; Mclntosh and Posnansky, 1976; Quechon and Roset, 1974), but a recent crop of similar dates from a range of sites and different materials should ensure the continuing consideration of this evidence (Grebenart, 1995; Kense, 1985; Paris et aL, 1992,1993; Person and Quechon, 1997b). In Air, evidence for copper-using exists at Iwelen, where an in situ context of ca. 2600 years of age, possibly of Libyco-Berber influence, produced copper javelins, points, and needles (Cornevin, 1988; Paris, 1996; Roset, 1987a, 1988,1989). In the Niger valley, evidence of copper-working is rare but 700 iron-working sites have been identified, some of which are clearly early, as suggested by a date of 2600 bp for an intact furnace at Kase Gorou; however little is known of the cultural context (Devisse and Vernet, 1993; Gado, 1980; Mclntosh and Mclntosh, 1986; Vernet, 1996). More fruitful than a focus on the timing of the first metal-working episodes is a reflection on the distinctly nonlinear nature of some techno logical systems. A number of sites fail to conform to patterns of gradual technological innovation and related social changes. Copper, iron, or stone items are used simultaneously, sometimes with little change in the way of life of the users, at Termit and in the Agades region. Apparently simpler methods of fabrication succeed intricate smelting exploitation at Azelik. Smelting, manufacture and consumption occur on separate sites at Iwelen (Grebenart, 1985,1987,1995; Mclntosh, 1994; Paris, 1996; Paris etal, 1992; Vernet, 1993, 1996; Quechon in Paris, 1996). Also, different metallurgical traditions appear to have coexisted without merging. Evidence of iron and copper smelting in the Agades area occurs in spatially distinct sites, with dif ferent ceramics stemming from separate local Neolithic traditions (Sahelian and Saharan), although their contemporaneity is not in doubt; it seems that the workers of both metals retained separate material cultures and traded metal items without engaging in the production of both metals themselves</page><page sequence="39">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 219 (Gordon etal, 1988; Gr6b6nart, 1985,1987,1988). This seems difficult to ex plain if one accepts that the metallurgy of copper and of iron were imported simultaneously into West Africa, as argued by Miller and Van der Merwe (1994). Greater attention to the artifacts associated with evidence of early met als is necessary if we are to untangle the cultural contacts thought to have brought on the use of such technology. Reported similarities in ceramic mate rial from different foci of early metal-working (Gr6b6nart, 1992-1993,1995; Paris, 1996; Paris et ai, 1992,1993; Vernet, 1996) all deserve further con sideration. Whatever the ultimate age of the metallurgy in Sahelian Niger, elucidating the social context of its beginnings will not be achieved without a consideration of pottery. SOCIAL UPHEAVAL: COMPLEX SOCIETIES IN SOUTHERN NIGER It is archaeological work which, in other parts of West Africa, has demonstrated an early autochthonous tradition of large-scale settlement, sometimes in contradiction with textual evidence (see Mclntosh, 1994, and Connah, 2001 for overviews). In Niger, evidence for permanent settlement, inconclusive in much of the earlier archaeological record, is plentiful for the last 1500 years, both in the Sahara (specifically in and around Air) and in the Sahel. Written records (Barth, 1965 [1857]; Palmer, 1910, 1916, 1928; Saley, 1993-1994; Urvoy, 1936) provide a context for many of these sites, connecting them to modern populations, and the spread of Islam?the most common faith in Niger today?to these regions provides a further thread of cultural continuity. This, of course, is a good thing, but it is not impossible that earlier local traditions may be obscured. Clusters of dry stone constructions, often equipped with a mosque, are reported in Air and the areas surrounding the massif (Bernus and Cressier, 1991; Lhote, 1973,1975; Maley et al, 1971; Roset, 1977b; Roset and Saltege, 1988). The identification of their constructors by oral tradition as Muslim forebears of the modern Tuareg is largely confirmed by archaeology. Three children's tombs at Mammanet demonstrate that Islamic funerary customs were adopted remarkably early: perhaps by a.d. 650, certainly by a.d. 900 (Paris, 1996), while Berber influences are evident in pottery forms and dec orations, in rock art, and in burial evidence, including the striking recovery of a gown woven some 1200 years ago in North African style at Iwelen (Dupuy, 1998; Paris, 1996; Roset, 1977b; Roset and Salfege, 1988). Radiocar bon dates spanning the period 800-200 bp (Calvocoressi and David, 1979; Delibrias et al, 1974; Lhote, 1973; Roset, 1977b; Roset and Salifege, 1988)</page><page sequence="40">220 Haour are consistent with an interpretation of these sites as participants in the establishment of the Tuareg sultanate of Agades. In these areas, however, archaeological investigation has unfortunately been aimed primarily at obtaining datable charcoal samples and at linking visible remains with mentions in written or oral traditions of the modern Air Tuareg, making only limited attempts at explanation or interpretation. The predominance of the written record is virtually unchallenged. A notable exception is the recent consideration of urbanism in Ighazer by Bernus and Cressier (1991). Isolating three phases of settlement, they consider changing patterns in trade routes and in copper exploitation, population movements, and the region's position at the border of Sahara and Sahel. Azelik became a flourishing urban center around the fourteenth century a.d., as a "pen tapolis" consisting of several simultaneous centers within a radius of 12 km, importing cereals from the south and involved in trade with North Africa (Bernus and Cressier, 1991). The contemporaneity of the different sites is attested by radiocarbon dates and ceramic sequences. The spatial distinctive ness may have allowed for occupational and ethnic specialization (Bernus and Cressier, 1991), a pattern relevant to proposed developments much far ther west and slightly earlier in the Inner Niger Delta (see Mclntosh, 2000). Azelik lost in importance in the sixteenth century a.d., for reasons relat ing perhaps to the increased influence of Agades and its sultanate, but also probably to economic and environmental factors. The concept of permanent, fixed settlement is from then on no longer applied in Ighazer, but is found in the interior of Air, for example at Assode (Bernus and Cressier, 1991) (Fig. 11). Large-scale, organized settlement is also apparent in the southern half of Niger. Along the border with modern Nigeria, extensive scatters of surface material, sometimes enclosed by a wall, are probably at least in part related to the development of the Hausa polities just to the south in the second mil lennium a.d.. To European writers and travelers from the fifteenth century onwards, the dense network and large scale of Hausa walled settlements were a cause for wonder (Africanus, 1600; Barth, 1965 [1857]; D'Anania in Berthoud and Lange, 1972; Clapperton in Clapperton etal, 1826; Richard son, 1853; Staudiger, 1900 [1889]), but the sites of Niger remain even less well understood than their counterparts in Nigeria. Only one of them, Kufan Kanawa, linked by oral tradition with the Hausa sphere (Brouin, 1938; Landeroin, 1910-1911; Mauny, 1961; Saley, 1993-1994; Trimingham, 1962; lo cal elders, personal communication), has been archaeologically investigated. A test pit (Hg. 12) yielded two charcoal samples indicating that the 6-km long stone wall around the site, possibly paired with an earthen embankment, was built in the first half of the fifteenth century a.d. (Haour, 2003, in press). The ceramic assemblage, both from excavation and from systematic collection, is</page><page sequence="41">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 221 Fig. 11. Assode, summer 1999. homogeneous in form and in decoration, suggesting settlement continu ity. Little is yet known of ceramic traditions in the area, but the knotted strip roulette decoration favored by the people of Kufan Kanawa (Fig. 13) fits well with data recovered from sites of the Kano region and the Chad Basin, where the decoration is associated with contexts spanning the last 2000 years (Connah, 1981; Darling, 1988; Gronenborn and Magnavita, 2000; Sieber, 1992; Wesler, 1999). Visiting Zinder in the mid-nineteenth century a.d., Richardson (1853, II, p. 226) was told that the territory contained some 2000 settlements, some larger than Zinder itself Clearly, much of the re gion's settlement evidence remains to be discovered and, as hinted at by the recent find of a cutting tool of Acheulean type at Kufan Kanawa (Haour and Winton, 2003), is likely to have deep roots. The Niger Valley is the most extensively prospected part of Sahelian Niger (De Beauchene, 1969; Gado, 1980; Vernet, 1996); Vernet (1996, p. 299, my translation) commented that "The exceptional richness of the historical archaeology of the area sometimes made us regret to be foremost a pre historian." Remains include 1-km long laterite paths/dykes at Tondikwarey, scatters of anthropomorphic statuettes in apparently domestic contexts at Kareygoru, and thick layers of deposits containing pottery and beads at Gabu and Yasaan (Pablo Toucet in Gado, 1980, Appendix II; De Beauchene, 1969; Gado, 1980,1993; Gado et al, 2000; Vernet, 1996). The cultural affiliations</page><page sequence="42">Fig. 12. Kufan Kanawa test excavation, April 2000. of these sites remain problematic and, like the settlement sites farther to the east, they seem to relate only loosely to modern inhabitants. Except for the unpublished survey of Tondikwarey, the excavation of mounds (pre sumed to be tumuli, although no burials were found) and settlement areas at Rosi and Kareygoru, and the survey of a large (22 x 25 m) stone rect angle at Kareygusu?all of which can be summarized in a single chapter by Gado (1980)?work has been of a preliminary nature, concerned with the documentation of surface scatters and the obtaining of charcoal samples for dating. The funerary evidence is better known, thanks to excavations at the site of Bura. Used between the third and tenth centuries a.d., sur rounded by fossil dunes which may once have enabled controlled access, this necropolis is characterized by anthropomorphic funerary jars with intri cate features thought to convey differences in gender, age, ethnic identity, and status (Gado, 1993). Bura seems to participate in a wider cultural area of anthropomorphic funerary statuettes and necropoles, but the associated settlements have not yet been researched (Gado, 1993; Gado et al., 2000; Vernet, 1996). Gado (1993) outlines several spheres of cultural influence in the Niger valley of the past 2000 years based on the regional distribution of key sur face material culture items backed by radiocarbon dates. The first phase, typified for example by Bura, Kareygusu, Yaasan, and the statuette facies</page><page sequence="43">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 223 i Fig. 13. Knotted strip roulette decorated potsherds, Kufan Kanawa test excavation 2000. at Kareygoru, occupied the first millennium a.d. and relates to the Songhai sphere. The second, which includes Rosi, Tondikwarey, and the Kareygoru mounds, involved the arrival of modern local groups such Zarma and Hausa and the reuse of sites such as Bura, although the people of Kareygusu, for one, seem to have remained in situ (Gado, 1993). The precise pattern of pop ulation shifts appears extremely complex and its archaeological recognition will require further work. Sites all relate to iron-using peoples and, although no evidence of subsistence regimes has been recovered (or indeed explicitly sought), their inhabitants can probably be identified as farming communi ties. The fate of the premetal populations is unknown; human activities in the first millennium b.c, in which the "Neolithic" apparently finished, are near invisible, even at sites occupied both before and after, such as Tuizegoru (Vernet, 1996). A feature common to many settlement sites is the occurrence of empty areas amongst housing, and of large enclosures which are most convincingly explained as the outside walls of compounds within which houses of perish able material were erected. This interpretation was made by Lhote (1975) at Tezamak, by Connah (1981) at Gazargamo in Nigeria, and by Haour (2003, in press) at Kufan Kanawa. This also fits well with the precolonial ev idence provided by Clapperton (in Clapperton etal, 1826), Staudiger (1990 [1889]), and Robinson (1900) for dispersed housing and scattered fields and</page><page sequence="44">224 Haour gardens within Hausa towns. At Azelik, the gaps are, given the traditional slant of this society towards nomadism and pastoralism, interpreted as cattle pens (Bernus and Cressier, 1991). In short, many of the sites of Niger, some possessing monumental architecture, show little evidence of the scale and density traditionally associated with urban centers. CONCLUSIONS The archaeologist is spoilt for choice in Niger. The establishment of a sequence for Paleolithic occupation of the country, especially in the south, will answer important questions on regional variability and on interactions between Sahara and forest. Comprehending the run-up to apparently very early pottery-using societies will inform the debate on the impact of climatic change on past human populations, tying in with concerns of subsistence practice, mobility, and the population movements supposed to have brought human groups into the Sahel in the face of an increasingly hostile Sahara. The beginnings of sedentary, agricultural, ways of life remain shrouded in uncertainty, even more so than the still poorly understood adaptation to pastoralism. The social and cultural origins and implications of the use of metals, and the timing of these events, need to be resolved, as do the nature of the societies which made a shift towards large-scale settlement in the past two millennia. In all of this, the relative cultural input of northern and southern influences remains unknown. With so much open to investigation, where to start? The answer lies in addressing the justifications for doing archaeology at all. It is often lamented that much of the archaeological work of West Africa has been designed and/or conducted by Western researchers, or dependent on Western funding. Whether as a cause or as an effect of this, most of the archaeology of Niger remains painfully irrelevant to the modern inhabitants of the country. The time and place in which present human and environmental frameworks were set in place (e.g. ca. 4500-2000 years ago, in the Sahel) have been the focus of little interest. This situation is changing quickly as efforts are made at connecting archaeology to present-day peoples. This slant is evident in the work of Smith (2000) and Dupuy (1998) in tracking the origins of the modern Fulani, of Gado (1980, 1993) in relating the archaeological record of the Niger valley to modern population configurations, of Hamani (1989) on an archaeological identification of the Hausa heartland with past settlement sites of Air, and of Paris (1984,1996), Roset (1977b, 1987a, 1988,1989), and Dupuy (1998) on the appearance of Tuareg forebears in Air. Born from the nature of the archaeological record, the Sahel/Sahara division is perpetuated by practice, with bibliographies and library holdings</page><page sequence="45">One Hundred Years of Archaeology in Niger 225 typically falling squarely within one or the other portion, and by methodol ogy. The poor coverage of the Sahel is problematic considering the presumed importance of interregional migrations throughout history. Niger, lying half in the Sahara and half in the Sahel, is ideally suited to answering questions on the links between north and south, forest and desert. Vernet (1996) notes however that much archaeology is likely to relate to utilitarian sites of little sensational value. May this not deter researchers or funders alike. There lies, also, a problem in locating suitable sites for investigation. Very few are in situ or have been subjected to more than selective test-pitting, typically the excavation of a hearth or pit with the aim of procuring datable organics. Environmental constraints and the widespread deflation of sites have been invoked as reasons for this, but stratigraphic sequences do exist, as was noted by Gado (1993) in the Niger River valley, Gr6b6nart (1993) near Agades, and Maitre (n. d.) and Haour (1999,2003) in the Zinder region. Many of these are threatened by long-term obliteration by human or natural agency. There have been repeated calls for the excavation of key sites, for example Kirkissoy with its deep Neolithic stratigraphy, or Marandet, possibly the medieval Maranda mentioned by North African authors from the ninth century onwards, with its copper smelting furnaces (Gr6b6nart, 1993; Vernet, 1996). The efforts of local archaeological authorities in the implementation of site protection laws (Gado, 1980,1993) are notable. Despite this, much is feared lost and gone forever. The systematic excavation of exposures as large as is feasible, and the swift publication of their results, is therefore an urgent priority. Alongside it must come thorough and ample illustrations of pottery styles. Current re searchers routinely find themselves obliged to compare ceramic sequences from sites several hundred kilometers apart (Breunig and Neumann, 2002; Grebenart, 1992-1993,1995; Haour, 2003; Paris, 1996; Paris era/., 1992,1993; Vernet, 1996). Filling in the gaps in the maps of pottery style distributions is crucial to untangling the history of culture contacts and population shifts which seem to be the foundations of present-day Niger societies. With uni versity teaching in Prehistory and Archaeology, including a postgraduate option at Masters level, and an energetic Institut de Recherches en Sciences Humaines, the bulk of innovative research is to be expected from researchers native to Niger. Many important questions raised by the archaeology of Niger remain unresolved?in some cases even after 40 years of debate. Indeed, the capacity of the archaeological record of Niger to generate and stimulate theoretical discussion is perhaps its main strength. With volumes currently in press deal ing with issues as diverse as early pastoral societies, funerary terracottas and large-scale walled settlements, and a range of sites of wide renown such as Bura, Adrar Bous, or Tamaya Mellet, the archaeology of Niger is also far</page><page sequence="46">226 Haour from defeated. A culture-historical approach articulated around the defini tion of particular artifact types (fossiles directeurs) signposting the wandering of different culture complexes has been replaced by a more intricate, some times confusingly inconclusive but certainly more sensitive, consideration of local circumstances and of individual actors' choices in the past. As a result, many monolithic cultural constructs (such as the Neolithic of Sudanese tra dition, based on wavy line and dotted wavy line sherds) and traditional linear development sequences (as regards for example the timing and nature of a shift from extractive to productive economies), have been left by the way side. Whether workable alternatives can be found to these is the challenge for the future of archaeology.
