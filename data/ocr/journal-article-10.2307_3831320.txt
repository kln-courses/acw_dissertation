PETERSON SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY AT CARBONDALE Frank O'Connor on Joyce and Lawrence: An Uncollected Text INTRODUCTION Frank O'Connor made his first broadcast for Dublin radio in June 1935, thus beginning an activity he was to continue on Radio Eireann (as it was later to be named) and the BBC for the rest of his life.1 Although he was soon appearing on the air with some regularity, it was not long before he ran afoul of the young republic's repressive tendencies. Ac? cording to the Irish Times program guide for 16 July 1937, O'Connor was scheduled to deliver a fifteen-minute discussion on D, H. Lawrence and James Joyce in a series entitled "Great Writers of To-day." But listeners that night would have been disappointed, for the broadcast was not aired. The text of the talk was published the following Wednesday, in the Irish Times for 21 July, under the headline "A Broadcast That Was Cancelled." It had been "banned," says the headnote, "virtually at the last minute." The station offered three reasons for the action: (1) That the script was not submitted five days before the time for broadcast- ing, as is required by the studio; (2) that Lawrence being dead and Ulysses, the book of Joyce's principally treated in the talk, being scarcely a work of to-day, the talk was not the most suitable for a "Writers of To-day" series; ' The bibliography appended to Michael/Frank, ed. Maurice Sheehy (Knopf, 1969), p. 175, gives 3 January 1937 as the date of O'Connor's first broadcast. Ruth Sherry, however, has established earlier dates through an examination of the Radio Eireann files. We are very grateful to her for so generously providing this information and for other valuable assistance. In addition to Ruth Sherry, we are indebted to a number of people for their help in this undertaking: Harriet O'Donovan Sheehy for permissions on behalf of the O'Connor estate; Deputy Editor Ken Gray for the permission of the Irish Times; Danis Rose for bringing the O'Connor piece to our attention; K. K. Collins, Kieran Woodman, and Edgar H. Lehrman. Any errors or misinterpretations, however, are our responsibility, of course. 211</page><page sequence="2">212 ALAN M. COHN AND RICHARD F. PETERSON and (3) a talk on Lawrence and Joyce, as written by Mr. O'Connor, while no doubt suitable for a critical or literary audience, was not suitable for general dissemination, and the broadcasting authorities felt that they would have left themselves open to criticism and censure had they permitted the talk. The third reason is probably the substantive one. After the passage of the Censorship of Publications Act in 1929, works which might have seemed innocuous even to American Comstocks were regularly banned in Ireland, and Radio Eireann was not, of course, unaffected by the dampened atmosphere. Since the station was govemment-owned, the civil servants who ran it would natural ly hesitate to jeopardize their positions by broadcasting anything offensive to state policy. Although there were occasional complaints in the Dail that there were not enough Irish language programs, or that there was too much jazz, or that oppos- ing political views were stifled, Radio Eireann generally conformed to the ideological and cultural roles expected of it.2 Given the cir- cumstances, it is little wonder that a proposed broadcast devoted to two authors who openly dealt with sexual topics would cause the authorities to balk. O'Connor had fought the censorship law almost from its inception. Within a few years of his move to Dublin in 1929, he had joined in Yeats's campaign against the banning of Shaw's Adventures ofthe Black Girl in Her Search for God3 His own books later became victims of the law (Dutch Interior in 1940, The Common Chord in 1947, and Traveller's Samples in 1951), while his translation of The Midnight Court (1946) from Brian Merriman's eighteenth-century Irish text earned the distinction of being the first book with an Irish imprint to fall under the ban.4 Only a few years before his death, he was still in the fray, support- ing the motion "that Irish censorship is insulting to Irish intelligence" in a 1962 debate at Trinity College.5 The aborted radio program, then, was just one of a number of skirmishes. Joyce and Lawrence were subjects which also commanded O'Con? nor's attention throughout his professional life; for better or for worse, they were to him two of the most representative and influential writers of the modern age.6 O'Connor devoted key chapters to them in his 2 Peter Feeney, "Censorship and RTE," Crane Bag, VIII, No. 2 (1984), 62; see also Maurice Gorham, Forty Years of Irish Broadcasting (Dublin: Talbot Press for Radio Telefis Eireann, 1967), p. 99. 3 James Matthews, Voices: A Life of Frank O'Connor (Atheneum, 1983), p. 95. 4 Michael Adams, Censorship: The Irish Experience (University of Alabama Press, 1968), p. 249. 5 The text of this talk appeared in the Dubliner, No. 2 (March 1962), pp. 39-44. 6 Towards an Appreciation of Literature (Dublin: Metropolitan, 1945), p. 56.</page><page sequence="3">O'CONNOR ON JOYCE AND LAWRENCE 213 books on the modern novel and the short story and wrote several other essays and reviews on Joyce, who eventually became O'Connor's pro- totype for all that was most wonderful and terrible about the modern writer, especially if he happened to be Irish. O'Connor's opinions on Lawrence as expressed in the aborted Great Writers talk?his praise for Lawrence's unconscious genius and his criti? cism of Lawrence's rage against humanity and impatience with artistic form?did not change significantly in his later writings. In Towards an Appreciation of Literature (1945), he still admired Lawrence's sensitivity and power in depicting nature, but in The Mirror in the Roadway (1956) he once again judged Lawrence weak in characterization and incapable of dealing with the phenomenon of love.7 By the time of The Lonely Voice (1962), O'Connor had elevated Lawrence to a position as one of England's few great short-story writers, only A. E. Coppard being his equal. This praise, however, was tempered by O'Connor's unshakable view of Lawrence as "a recklessly instinctive writer," able to write with understanding and joy about the natural world but unable to go beyond the tactile in presenting human relationships.8 At his best in the primitive world of his early stories and novels, Lawrence, hampered by the social deprivations of his early life, became more inept in characterization and more hysterical in style until he finally lost touch with his genius and turned away from his natural donnee. O'Connor's comments on Joyce as prepared for the 1937 radio pro? gram mark an important departure from the position he had taken seven years earlier in the Irish Statesman.9 In a review of Work in Progress, O'Connor had judged A Portrait to be an astonishing advance from the less than impressive storytelling in Dubliners, had praised the mastery of language and form in Ulysses, and had regarded the early fragments of what was to become Finnegans Wake as brilliant and happy exercises in humor and melody. Now O'Connor assumes a more ambivalent stance. Dubliners "is the last word in cold reason," A Portrait "filled with a dangerous sensibility." In Ulysses, Joyce attempts to combine the qualities of his earlier books, but though "the biggest thing in modern literature," the novel remains a failure because Joyce cannot fuse the realism of Dubliners with the aestheticism of A Portrait in this single work. 7 Towards an Appreciation of Literature, p. 55; "D.

COHN AND RICHARD F. PETERSON While recognizing Joyce's genius and his profound impact on modern literature, O'Connor continued his grievance against what he considered Joyce's extremism for the next thirty years. In a post-mortem written for the Bell (1943), O'Connor complained harshly of Joyce's "second rate brain with its utter intellectual poverty, its superstitions and puns and jingles."10 In a BBC broadcast a year later, O'Connor echoed his earlier condemnation of Joyce's egotism, again pointing out that the Irish writer is often forced by his claustrophobic environment into a "monstrous inflation of pride."11 Driven back into his imagination by the paralysis of his country, Joyce, struggling between reality and art, finally surren- dered his genius to stylistic overindulgence. O'Connor hardened his position further in his later criticism, insisting in The Mirror in the Roadway that Joyce had come to love literature more than life and had reduced man "to a metaphor."12 In The Lonely Voice, O'Connor argued that Joyce abandoned the short story because he had grown impatient with characters shaped by circumstance and needed the larger canvas of the novel to satisfy his obsession with style and structure.13 Finally, in his posthumously published Short History of Irish Literature (1967), O'Connor concluded that Joyce was "the spoiled priest" of the imagination, that his language was too much of a private sacrament, his work too monastic to be anything but a curiosity at best, a terrible bore at worst.14 For O'Connor, then, Joyce and Lawrence possessed great imaginative gifts but were unable or unwilling to use them to illuminate human experience. Hurt by their respective social, religious, and national in- heritances, both Lawrence and Joyce, though radically different in artistic temperament, perverted their geniuses, creating elaborate fantasias to solidify their self-proclaimed roles as priests of love or the imagination. Though Joyce and Lawrence profoundly influenced modern literature, they drained the humanity out of their art and built fictional worlds alien to the human condition.

There are, I know, still people who think you ought to admire them when they tell you they don't read fiction. History and biography they look on as serious pursuits; fiction as a frivolous waste of time?some? thing like the pictures. But they are out of date. The novel is the especial modern art form, not because of any great merit in itself, but because modern life changes with such extraordinary rapidity, and the theatre? the great art of the Old World?cannot re-adjust itself as readily as the novel to changing conditions. It gets stuck; a new playwright arises, but cannot find actors; a new style of acting emerges, but cannot find playwrights. That is, the theatre gets stuck because of its rather cumbrous machin- ery. But what causes fiction to stick? I ask you that because, though unofficially I am supposed to speak to you about the great fiction writers of to-day, I must be honest and tell you?in a whisper?that there aren't any. That is, there are no source books, no books that tell you about the latest discoveries; in fact, I very much doubt if there are any dis- coveries worth talking about. In modern literature?that is, literature in English?I can think of only two writers who have achieved the sort of reputation the scientist achieves and convinced a whole generation that they were exploring anew the old avenues of joy and pain which a hundred writers before them had explored and a hundred thousand had taken on trust. They are James Joyce and D. H. Lawrence. Each was a man of quite excep- tional gifts, and there are certain parallels in their lives which may be of some service to us in considering why the novel has got stuck. Each had an unhappy home life; each had an intense feeling towards a devoted mother and consequent disagreements with his father. This would be a matter of complete indifference but that both have stressed the fact in their work, and in both it had a determining influence upon the nature of the work. Lawrence's first novel, The White Peacock, was an amazing achieve? ment for a man in his early twenties. In it he shows that one great gift which lasted with him until his early death: the power of projecting himself entirely into the world of nature, a landscape, a bunch of flowers, a horse; when Lawrence touches them they seem to spring into im- mediate pulsating life. And it is not the appalling anthropomorphism of</page><page sequence="6">216 ALAN M. COHN AND RICHARD F. PETERSON the nature-lover so called, who makes a tree or a dog talk and think like a human being. Lawrence's genius is that the life he describes is always an unconscious life. It is only in his third book, Sons and Lovers, that we see the danger in which this great gift places him. Sons and Lovers is a dramatization of his own unhappy home life with a drunken father and a mother he adored. The scenes in the home; the brutality of the father; the terrible struggle of the mother to bring up her children properly; the impotent, agonised adoration of the boy, put this book straightway among the great things of English fiction. These are scenes I defy anybody to forget. But there are other scenes which describe the relations of the boy with his sweetheart which are on a quite different plane. They are not bad with a mere badness of failure; they are bad in their very conception. The love he describes is not a mere crudity or indecency; it is something much worse?it is love with the woman left out. There is not even the faintest attempt to adjust it to her humanity, to limit and define it by her limitations. It is as though Lawrence's sense of proportion utterly deserted him the very moment he began to think of love; he wants to write of it as he writes of birds and trees?as something absolutely unconscious, which, by its very nature, it cannot be. That is a fatal weakness in the novelist. From this on we see Lawrence indulging in the elaborate fake of creating men and women who can feel love in his way. "You can fake anything," said Tolstoy, grimly, "but you cannot fake psychology."15 And so, in novel after novel, Lawrence gives us those wonderful landscapes, throbbing with natural life, and men and women move against them who have no life at all. And, as a result, his novels grow more and [more] shapeless, because humanity is form, and Lawrence will not accept humanity at any price?humanity, with its headaches and heartaches, its anxiety about to-morrow, its absurd and humiliating limitations. He rages against form in the same way as he rages against humanity. "They want me to have form. That means they want me to have their pernicious, ossiferous, skin-and-grief form."16 No one needs to be reminded how, towards the end of his 15 This is probably O'Connor's distillation from a reading of Tolstoy's criticism. In What is Art?, for example, Tolstoy says, But an artistic impression, that is to say, infection, is only received when an author has in the manner peculiar to himself experienced the feeling which he transmits, and not when he passes on another man's feeling previously transmitted to him.

Now, there is something in all this that reminds me of the fate of the Celtic nations. I do not want to claim for Lawrence that he had so much Welsh blood. What I am suggesting is that he represents the Celtic streak in English literature which Arnold was the first to point out.17 The most obvious proof of this is his amazing power of writing about nature. You would not need me to remind you that when they got tired of the Latin civilisation which produced the early hymns, the Irish began to write nature poetry, which is still unique in European literature. But that poetry had another point in common with Lawrence's writing; the nature it described was hunter's country. In page after page of Irish literature you will find landscapes without a single trace of human occupation; you need not go further than the mediaeval story of Suibne Geilt.18 And there is another thing which Arnold noticed, though he did not see how intimately it was bound up with the Celtic passion for nature. "The revolt against the despotism of fact,"19 is how he described it, and I am astonished that critics as acute as Aldous Huxley did not remember that revealing phrase when dealing with Lawrence. For the Celtic love of nature is itself a revolt against the despotism of fact, the fact of Christianity. Fionn and the Fenians loved The mountain more than the cell; They loved the blackbird's voice; Never the voice of the bell.20 Huxley (London: Heinemann, 1932), p. 87; ed. James T. Boulton (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979), I, 492. Huxley also quotes this sentence in his Introduction, p. xvii. Matthew Arnold's On the Study of Celtic Literature was originally delivered as a series of four lectures in 1865-66, appeared serially in the Cornhill Magazine during 1866, and in book form the following year. 18 A saga based on matter which migrated to Ireland from Britain around the eighth century. The most important version extant is the twelfth century Buile Suibhe, edited and translated by J. G. O'Keeffe for the Irish Texts Society in 1913. See James Carney, " 'Suibne Gelt' and The Children of Lir,' " in Studies in Irish Literature and History (Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1955), pp. 129ff. Arnold's line reads, "always ready to react against the despotism offact." On the Study of Celtic Literature, in Lectures and Essays in Criticism, ed. R. H. Super with Sr. Thomas Marion Hocter, Vol. Ill of Arnold's Complete Prose Works (University of Michigan Press, 1962), p. 344. The phrase comes from Henri Martin's Histoire de France (see Super and Hocter's footnote, p. 507). 20 The last stanza of "Lon Doire an Chairn" ("The Blackbird of Derrycarn"). A translation of this Ossianic lay of the sixteenth or seventeenth century appeared as early as 1808 (by William Leahy, in the Transactions of the Caelic Society of Dublin), and subsequently by Dr. Sigerson, Kenneth Jackson, Sean O'Faolain, Austin Clarke, and no doubt others. This quatrain, however, is almost certainly O'Connor's own rendition.

PETERSON It is not nature that the Irish and Lawrence wanted to get back to, but the unconscious instinctive life of the tribe, in which personality is shattered, and even the leader whom the tribe obeys moves not by intelligence, but by charms and dreams. Intellectually, at least, Joyce's beginning was even more promising than Lawrence's. His book of stories, Dubliners, is the last word in cold reason; anything less mystic it would be hard to imagine. But it was a genuine piece of exploration. This Dublin of Joyce's, which might as well have been Cork or Galway, was the first portrayal in literature of everyday life in Irish cities. Young men nowadays would probably find it hard to believe the revelation it was to us fifteen years ago. The Portrait of the Artist, which succeeded it, was a very different kettle of fish. It was an imaginative autobiography, and the young man who in Dubliners had walked the streets of Dublin with a coldly scientific eye was revealed as a nervous tortured soul, crucified by his own human weaknesses, and by the ugliness of life about him. The Anglo-lrish view of the Parnell split, which regards the tragedy of it as the unique tragedy of Parnell, is absurd. The real tragedy was the desolation of spirit it produced among the people, of whom Joyce is the very pattern. His despair is the despair of Ireland, and, as happened with many others, the despair produced a violent overweening individualism. Instead of the longing for the unconscious life of the tribe, it is the desire to break for ever with the tribe. There are no words too foul for Ireland?"The old sow that eats her farrow";21 Dublin is "the slum of Christendom";22 he can see no higher destiny than to escape from it all, and in secrecy and darkness "to forge anew the uncreated conscience of my race."23 It is an extreme and fantastic book, filled with a dangerous sensibility. It was written in tears, and it appealed to my generation in the same way as Goethe's Werther appealed to young Germans. It made us all self-conscious, emotional, rebellious, and ateach re-reading I find that its magic dwindles. When one has grown out of the Stephen Dedalus stage there isn't much else in the book, except, perhaps, the great scene in which Joyce described how the Parnell split broke upon his own home. But it will, I believe, continue to influence young people long attribution, and offers three more stanzas from the poem under the title "Poet and Priest" in The Wild Bird's Nest: Poems from the Irish (Dublin: Cuala Press, 1932, p. 11), O'Connor apparently never published a full translation of this work. 21 A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, ed.

Ulysses began as a short story for Dubliners and ended as the biggest thing in modern literature. What happened it is fairly plain. It was begun in a detached scientific spirit, the spirit in which Joyce trained that tearful soul of his to express itself, but as the portrait with its trembling sensitiveness began to emerge from his mind, the cold scientific spirit already seemed old-fashioned, and Joyce saw a blending of the two; the coarse, sensual, mediocre Bloom must be made to meet the refined and sensitive Dedalus, who, of course, is Joyce himself; all Joyce has known of the underworld of Dublin, its vice and its horror will be blended with his own superb dreams, his agonies of sensitiveness. It is an amazing conception and an amazing book. It opens with young Dedalus brooding upon the death of his mother. She has died just after he has lost his faith; on her dying bed she had asked him to kneel and say a prayer for her. He had refused, and now he is haunted by the thought of the dead face and the prayer for the dying echoes through his mind. Liliata rutilantium Turma circumdet Jubilantium te virginum.24 About this central theme the whole fabric of the book is built up. We follow Dedalus to the school where he teaches, the national library, the office of the Freeman;25 through all the byways of Dublin; and everywhere he is haunted by that memory; sometimes it is merely suggested, as when he talks of the Anglo-Saxon Agenbite of Inwit?Re? morse of Conscience,26 sometimes it floats through his mind as an echo of the old Latin prayer. In the Walpurgis Night scene27 it mounts to a monstrous climax, when drunken and dissipated, Stephen sees his mother enter in her grave-clothes and, with an oath smashes the gasolier and rushes into the street. As a sort of horrible companion, Mr. Bloom, the little Hungarian Jew, Arthur Griffith's friend, is traced in the same way until they meet in the nightmare of the Walpurgis Night. He is the foilto Dedalus, SanchoPanzatohisQuixote, FalstafftohisPrinceHal. 24 In this form, Ulysses (Random House, 1961), p. 23, and a leitmotiv throughout, of course; see William M.

Sancho Panza and Quixote I understand; they are cut out of the same piece of cloth; so are Falstaff and Prince Hal. But are Bloom and Stephen? Isn't Bloom, like so many of the characters in Dubliners, a piece of raw objectivity, unwarmed by the author's personality; isn't Stephen Dedalus a Narcissus, a human soul which has never been penetrated by the real world, and brought to laugh at itself and adjust its impossiblism by outside standards? I do not know; I only feel now that sometimes I want to kick the too-human Bloom into a semblance of human dignity, and box the ears of Stephen Dedalus and make him think of others' tragedy beside his own. These, then, are our two greatest; and they seemed to me to have failed.</page></plain_text>
