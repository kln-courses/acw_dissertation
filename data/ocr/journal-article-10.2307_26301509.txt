<plain_text><page sequence="1">Morphology of a Symbol: The Octopus* by Jacques Schnier In the second volume of his biography of Freud, Ernest Jones comments that as early as 1910 he had suggested to Freud that a collected study of symbolism be instituted. The latter was pleased with the idea and a committee was appointed for the purpose. Although little came of this later, Jones still considers that much could be learned from such a comparative study from all sources, art, myths, folklore, dreams and so on, so as to ascertain the precise points of resemblance on which symbols are constructed. (11a, p. 68) The value of symbols for psychoanalysis, as Anna Freud has expressed it, is that they provide universally valid rela tions between particular id-contents and specific ideas of words or objects. The knowledge of these relations, enables us to draw reliable inferences from conscious manifestations such as works of arts, folklore, mythology, the personal fantasies and dreams of analyzands, etc., as to the unconscious material behind them, without first laboriously going through the investigative process of reversing the measures which the ego has adopted in its defense. The technique of trans lating symbols is thus a shortcut to understanding, or a way of plunging from the highest strata of consciousness to the lowest strata of the unconscious without pausing at the intermediate strata of former ego-activities which may in time past have forced a particular id-element to assume a specific ego form. The knowledge of the language of sym bols has the same sort of value for the understanding of the id as mathematical formulae have for the solution of typical •Amplified from a paper read before the Psychoanalytic Education Society, of San Francisco, January 12, 1952, and the American School of Classical Studies, Athens, Greece, March 1, 1955.</page><page sequence="2">4 Jacques Schnier problems. Such formulae are used constantly with demon strable advantage. From a practical point of view it does not matter if one is ignorant of the way they were originally arrived at. (8a, p. 16) However, we must not overlook the fact that formulae, though they help to solve problems, do not actually extend our understanding of mathematics. In the same way, by directly translating a symbol in a specific context we may uncover the id-contents without really gaining any deeper psychological understanding of the factors which produced it, or of the individual or the culture who uses it. It is for this reason that the investigation of how specific symbols are constructed and how single or multiple id-meanings are assigned to them is of such great importance. The following study of the octopus symbol was first inspired by its appearance in the associations of analyzands and also by a Japanese wood-block print by Kuniyosi (1791 1861). This print, (Plate I) a gift from a friend, depicts a monstrous octopus rearing the hulk of its enormous head out of the ocean. Drenched with spray and moving as if in procession before this huge monster is a host of lesser sea folk — the lobster, squid, clam, oyster, abalone, and innum erable species of fish both large and small. Immediately in front of the octopus and occupying the central point in this procession is an immense crab with upraised claws in which is clasped a large sheathed samuri sword. That the octopus is not an uncommon motif in Japanese thought was readily attested to by one of my colleagues, Pro fessor Susumu Nakamura. From him I also learned that one of the most common Japanese objects on which this motif appears is the hanging curtain or screen at the entrance to bars and restaurants. In other instances, also connected with drinking and eating places, it is depicted in drawings or on menus, dancing merrily and drunkenly while waving a fan. But behind this jolly characterization exists ambi valent features, for, alongside its association with drunken ness and merriment, the octopus, in the Japanese mind is</page><page sequence="3">Morphology of a Symbol: The Octopus 5 related with overpowering hatred. An infuriated person is referred to as being ' ' angry as an octopus. ' ' Another of the many culture areas in which the octopus motif is found is that of pre-columbian Peru. Here, in coastal archeological sites, many clay pots and jars have been found exquisitely decorated with designs based on the octopus. On some examples, the motif is applied in the form of drawing or painting; on others, it is modeled on the sur face in three-dimensions or low-relief. On a number of these container forms, as for example, two of the jars in the Mu seum of Anthropology, at the University of California, at Berkeley, the octopus is depicted with a demon-like anthro pomorphic head which is completely alien to the actual head structure of the animal. The possible symbolic significance of this type of presentation will be referred to later when studying the unconscious meaning of the octopus. MINOAN AND MYCBNAEN OCTOPUS MOTIF Of all cultures in which the octopus motif appears, how ever, none used it more frequently or as inventively as the Minoans and the Mycenaens. For hundreds of years, long before the beginning of the Christian era, no other motif was as popular with the potters of Crete and Argolis as the undulating eight-armed animal whose shape provided almost unlimited design variations for the rounded surface of their pots. Through the systematic excavations of the Palace of Knossos by Sir Arthur Evans (6), and the Mycenae acropolis by Biegen (2) and others, innumerable examples of cups, jars, pots, and amphora, decorated with the octopus design have been uncovered. At other sites on Crete,—at Palai kastro, Zakra, Gournia—on the Greek mainland, on Rhodes, Cyprus, and eastern Mediterranean coastal sites additional pots and other objects similarly decorated have been found. No doubt, during early times, as today, this animal repre sented a principal item of food for the population. But be cause of its shape and specific characteristics it also came to be unconsciously associated with a certain group of repressed</page><page sequence="4">6 Jacques Schnier feelings and thus became a popular art symbol for these un conscious thoughts. Because the octopus was so inextricably bound up for hundreds of years with Minoan and Mycenaean culture, one is tempted to fathom its unconscious significance for these early Mediterranean inhabitants. But, unfortunately, we have no literary associations from early time; we have no myths, no folklore, nor fairy-tales to provide the verbal associations for interpreting or for substantiating any in terpretation we might make. It would be a simple matter for us in this situation to use the comparative method and, on the basis of similarities, attribute to the Mycenaean octo pus symbol, the same unconscious significance as that which we uncover in the octopus symbol of later cultures or our own analyzands. But no matter to what extent we may individ ually be convinced of the universality of unconscious think ing processes in human beings, with their corresponding similarity in the method of selecting and employing symbols, the modern anthropologist, art historian, and sociologist take exception to this point of view. Their claim is that scientifically it is incorrect to interpret ancient man's think ing processes on the basis of the thinking processes observ able in modern man. Since ancient man is no longer avail able for verifying our interpretations, many anthropologists and sociologists are prone to consider any symbolic explan ation of his art and institutions, no matter how convincing they appear, as mere speculation. There is, however, at least one feature connected with the octopus design of the Minoans and Mycenaeans which is highly significant for anthropological investigation from a psychoanalytic point of view. Extensive research indicates that it had a developmental history during which it passed through a series of structural changes. Careful study of these changes discloses certain striking associated ideas which are of great value for deciphering symbolic content. Archeological study of the design shows that starting with an altogether realistic and rhythmic rendering, it tended more and more towards stylization and abstraction until the</page><page sequence="5">Morphology of a Symbol: The Octopus 7 latest designs, on casual glance, seem to bear no resemblance to the actual physical appearance of the octopus. An early or realistic version as seen on a pot from Gournia (plate II, fig. 1), or on examples from the Mycenaean II A period (see Fururmark's chart, plate III), show the octopus in a natural position with its head uppermost. Its tentacles, spotted with suckers, stream out and up from the bottom of the head mass and gracefully undulate here and there over the surface of the pot. In later versions (see Mycenaean II B examples) the natural position of the octopus has been reversed; the head is now at the bottom of the design with the tentacles streaming out from the top of the form. In even later versions, (Mycenaean III A: 2, early) the head has more" and more become an elongated mass with major emphasis on the two round eyes and long drawn-out top knob which in the inverted position takes on the appearance of a long nose. The tentacles have become thinner and with out suckers, thus strongly suggesting strands of hair. In a great number of the very latest designs, as for ex ample, on pots of the Mycenaean III A: 2 late period, and on the great jar in the Candia Museum (plate II, fig 2), there can be no question that the artist now associates the octopus with a monstrous head featuring two large eyes and an exaggerated bulbous nose. The tentacles or arms are represented as snakelike strands of hair streaming from the head and the whole appearance is that of a gruesome female demon. Even in its last and most disintegrated form, (My cenaean III C types), the two large eyes, the long pendant nose and the streaming locks of hair are retained. As Freud very early pointed out, the myths, legends and art products of a group or nation express unconscious wishes, fears, or defenses against these fears, common to its members. These expressions of the unconscious could not long survive if they did not reflect a general group tendency. As manifes tations of unconscious thoughts they correspond to the per sonal fantasy, art or dream life of an individual. Now we know that the changes, substitutions or correc tions that take place in the retelling of a personal fantasy or</page><page sequence="6">8 Jacques Sehnier dream, or in the use of a specific art motif, are in the nature of associated ideas and are, therefore, meaningful indicators of repressed thoughts. We can, therefore, think of the changes and revisions through which a given national myth, art motif, or fantasy progresses, as in the nature of a series of associated thoughts or associated designs of the group ex tended in time, and, thus, of great value in revealing un conscious content. OCTOPUS MYTHS AND FANTASIES Before proceeding to investigate the symbolic significance of the Mycenaean octopus, as well as the symbolism of the octopus in other contexts, let us briefly consider the historical fantasies concerning this animal. Ancient as well as modern writers have created many stories about the octopus and its close relatives, the squid and cuttlefish. But on examining the literature of different periods one finds myth and fancy so wonderfully intertwined with a basis of facts that even the experienced naturalist would probably find its difficult to pass judgment on what is fact and what is fancy. Although many stories emphasizing the size of the cephalopod are gross exaggerations, others do appear to be founded on actual observation. A writer, who, for many years shipped before the mast, describes the harpooning and capture of a sperm whale. In dying, the whale ejected the contents of its stomach which appeared to contain the por tion of an enormous fish, bitten off to enable the whale to swallow it. Upon closer examination this piece was found to be a massive fragment of a cuttlefish—a tentacle or arm— as thick as a stout man's body, and with six or seven suck ing discs on it. (3, p. 78) Some idea of the overall size of the cuttlefish to which such a tentacle fragment might be long is conveyed by the data on the octopus tanks at the Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco, which states that these animals grow to a maximum of fifty to sixty feet and a weight of thirty tons. Even though we accept the dimensions recorded by eye witnesses some of the descriptions of octopuses by more lit</page><page sequence="7">Morphology of a Symbol: The Octopus 9 erary minded observers and writers have obviously been em broidered by the imagination and must be classified as sheer fantasies. For example, Denys de Montefort, a French scientist in his book on the Natural History of Mollusks, refers to a colossal cephalopod which he illustrates with a drawing showing a huge octopus throwing its arms over a three-masted vessel, snapping off its masts, tearing down the yards and at the point of dragging it to the bottom. The theme of his illustration is taken from a painting in the chapel of St. Thomas in the French seaport of St. Malo which is based on an event said to have actually happened off the coast of West Africa. (13, p. 256). Half a century before de Montefort, a Norwegian Bish op, Pontippidian, in his Natural History of Norway (1754) wrote that, "a fleet of ships while at sea sighted an island where no island should be, and determining to explore this strange land, anchored their vessels and landed. Suddenly to their horror, there arose around the island a multitude of serpent arms taller than the masts of the vessels, which embraced the ships and collected the crew, until, with a hor rible whirling of the whole ocean, island, ships and men dis appeared forever." (3, p. 138) This creature was evidently the Kraken of old Norse legends fashioned after an octopus prototype; at least, this is the usually accepted interpreta tion of it. The additional assertion that the Kraken dark ened the water around it by an excretion further supports this explanation. (5) In the Orient there also exists an exaggerated idea of the size of the octopus and the power of these animals to sink a ship and devour its crew. An English resident of China states that he had seen in a shop "a picture of a cuttle fish embracing a junk, apparently of about 300 tons weight, and helping itself to the sailors as one picks gooseberries off a bush." (12, p. 106) Of a size comparable to the Kraken of Norse mythology is the octopus fantasied by the script writer of a proposed Hollywood film entitled, "The Monster Beneath the Sea". The plot is woven about a "Frankenstein type Octopus which seizes a U. S. Navy submarine ; crushes it, sinks a ship, kills human beings,</page><page sequence="8">10 Jacques Schnier and, as a climax, clasps and completely destroys the Golden Gate Bridge [the longest suspension bridge in the world] and creates panic and terror in San Francisco."* All reports to the contrary, however, the octopus appears to be a harmless, indifferent, easily frightened fellow. Jacques Y. Cousteau, who, for many years has explored the mysterious depths of the sea with the aqua-lung, gives eye witness accounts of meetings between octopus and man. Fre quently while moving under water he saw octopuses on the sea floor clinging to reefs. Anxious to test the common be lief in the animal's savagery, his companion, Dumas, on one occasion, took the initiative and pulled an octopus from a cliff. "If Dumas was timid, the octopus was downright ter rorized. It writhed desperately to escape the four-armed monster, and succeeded in breaking loose. . . . Soon we were handling any size of cephalopod we found. Dumas became a sort of dancing instructor to the devilfish. He would select an unwilling pupil, hold it firmly and gently gyrate around inducing the creature to follow. The octopod used every trick to escape. The bashful animal usually refused to fasten its suction cups to flesh. Dumas tried to wrap the tentacle around his bare arm, in the familiar blood-drinking position but without success. The octopus would not retain his grip. Dumas forced the suction cups against his arm and succeeded in obtaining a brief adhesion, quite easy to re move." (4, p. 20) In mythology as in art we find audacious liberties taken in depicting the octopus as well as other animals—insects turned to giants and humans reduced to mites. According to the Samoan myth of creation, the earth originated in a geneological series of rocks or cliffs, from which at length arose the octopus, whose children were fire and water. Later, the sea was formed as a result of the bursting of the ink sac of this primeval animal. (15) •From the San Francisco Chronicle, September 11, 1954</page><page sequence="9">Morphology of a Symbol : The Octopus 11 ASSOCIATED SYMBOLS In addition to the emphasis on gigantic size another feature found in literary works is the association of the octo pus with a number of undisputably mythological or fantasy figures. For example Victor Hugo writes, "It is difficult for those who have not seen it to believe in the existence of the devilfish (English synonym for octopus). Compared to this creature, the ancient Hydras are insignificant." (10, p. 122) In another instance Hugo actually refers to the octopus as a Hydra. Now the Hydra of Greek mythology was a gigantic monster with nine heads, the center one being immortal. It haunted the marsh of Lerna in Peloponnesus until it was destroyed by Heracles as one of his twelve la bours. When attacking it, he found that as soon as one head was cut off two grew up in its place. Finally he burnt out the roots with firebrands, and at last severed the im mortal head from the body and buried it under a mighty block of rock. The arrows dipped in the poisonous blood or gall of the monster were said to inflict fatal wounds. Be cause the octopus is really capable of rapidly developing anew a lost tentacle, an English naturalist is of the opinion that the idea of the many headed Hydra originated from knowledge of the octopus. In addition, the ancients attrib uted to the octopus a venomous secretion similar to the poison ous blood or gall attributed to the Hydra. (12, p. xv) The many writhing tentacles and ghastly appearance of the octopus have reminded some authors of the terrifying female monster Gorgo, the Roarer. Gorgo, also known as Medusa, had a round face, an angry look, boar's tusks and any one who caught sight of her or was struck by the light ning from her eyes was petrified immediately. But perhaps the chief feature by which Gorgo was known was her locks of hair in the form of serpents. It is this feature that prompts comparison with the octopus. Thus, Bullen writes, "The sombre brown of its body, the pustular skin, the eyes in which a whole inferno of hatred of everything living seems to be concentrated, the palpitating orifice at the top of the</page><page sequence="10">12 Jacques Schnier head, opening now and then, sufficiently to show the parrot like beak common to all the race, these are grisly features, but the eight arms, writhing, curling, clinging like a Medusa's hair, are features of the octopus which hold the imagination captive." (3, p. 127) Here I should like to insert a number of psychoanalytic interpretations of the Medusa head symbol as they parallel interpretations suggested by the symbol of the octopus. Briefly, this figure from Greek mythology is interpreted as a symbol of the fear-invoking characteristics of the female based primarily on the child's observation of the anatomical difference in sexual structure between male and female. Freud in his short note on Medusa's Head writes, "It is a remarkable fact that, however frightening they (the writh ing snakes of her head) may be in themselves, they never theless serve actually as a mitigation of the horror, for they replace the penis, the absence of which is the cause of the horror." (8) Flügel reports the case of a woman who thought while combing her mother's hair that it was alive and that in some uncanny way was able to move itself as if it were, like Medusa's hair, a mass of serpents. Shortly be fore, while brushing the hair of an intimate friend, there occurred to her the idea that the hair was very like "a lot of little penises." (7, p. 156) Since associations point to some similarity in the unconscious meaning of things com pared, it should not appear sheer conjecture to assign a similar interpretation to theoctopus and catalog it with the Medusa head as another symbol of the infantile fear and, at the same time, resolution of this fear, stemming from the little boy's observation of the mother's body. Of this com parison, however, I shall have more to say later. That the Medusa head provides for a resolution of the fear is indicated by the cold beauty and attractiveness given it in Classical art, as for instance, the example in the Munich Glyptothek. (16, p. 328) In these sculptures the terrifying and repulsive representations of the head from earlier times give way to refined beauty. (7, p. 186) A French tale from Lorraine in which a seven-headed</page><page sequence="11">Morphology of a Symbol : The Octopus 13 dragon and a witch are identical (17, p. 62) suggests that the multi-headed Hydra already referred to has a similar meaning as the Medusa head. The witch's long nose and broom are commonly found to be symbols of the fantasied penis. Before delving deeper in quest of further interpreta tions let us examine other associations and contexts in which the octopus symbol occurs. In Victor Hugo's novel referred to above, the hero Gilliatt enters a cave in pursuit of a crab. Reaching after it into a fissure, he is suddenly sized by some strange monster which twists itself around his naked arm. Hugo's description of the ensuing battle between his hero and the monster is most vivid and highly colored by fantasy. "Gilliatt recoiled; but he had scarcely power to move! He was, as it were, nailed to the place. With his left hand. . . he supported himself against the rocks while he made a desperate effort to withdraw his arm. He succeeded in only disturbing his persecutor, which wound itself still tighter. A second form—sharp elongated and narrow—issued out of the crevice, like a tongue out of monstrous jaws. It seemed to lick his naked body. . . Then suddenly stretching out, it became longer and thinner, as it crept over his skin, and wound itself round him. At the same time a terrible sense of pain, comparable to nothing he had ever known, compelled all his muscles to contract. . . It seemed as if innumerable suckers had fastened to his flesh and were about to drink his blood. . . A third long undulating shape issued from the hole in the rock; seemed to feel its way about his body; lashed round his ribs like a cord, and fixed itself there. . . It was impossible to sever or tear away the slimy bands (now many in number) which were adhering by a number of points. Each of the points was the focus of frightful and singular pangs. It was as if numberless small mouths were devouring him,** at the same time. . . . Suddenly a large, round, flattened, glutinous mass issued from beneath the crevice. . . In the middle of this slimy mass appeared two "Italics not in original.</page><page sequence="12">14 Jacques Schnier eyes. . . Gilliatt recognized it as an octopus." (10, p. 122) Continuing his description of the octopus Hugo writes, "If terror were the object of its creation, nothing could be imagined more perfect than the devilfish. . . (it) has no muscular organization, no menacing cry, no breastplate, no horn, no dart, no claw, no tail with which to hold or bruise; no cutting fin, no poison, no talons, no teeth, yet it is of all creatures, the most formidably armed." He then asks, ''What is the devilfish?" and provides his own anwser, "It is the sea vampire." (10, p. 122-123) Now the vampire, like the Medusa head is definitely a creature of the imagination. Belief in this fantastic figure is extremely widespread and there is probably no corner of the earth where it does not appear, in some form or other, in folk tales or superstitions. According to the Slavs, amongst whom, belief in the vampire is particularly firmly established, it is a soul or reanimated body of a deceased person who continues to live in the grave coming out at night to suck the warm blood of men and women while they are asleep. Thus it is nourished, maintained in good condition and pre served from decomposition. In his "Nightmare, Witches and Devils," Jones devotes an entire section to the vampire, in which he has collected a rich store of superstitions and sagas. Concerning this subject he writes, "None of the group of beliefs, here dealt with, is richer or more overdetermined than that of the vampire, nor is there one that has more numerous connections with other legends and superstitions." (11, p. 38) The two characteristics of the Slavic Vampire, viz. 1) its origin in a dead person who it is feared will return from the grave to molest the living, and 2) its habit of sucking blood from living persons, usually with fatal effect, are also the principal features of vampire beliefs found in other parts of the world. If we investigate these two features, material is brought to light that is of considerable help in our at tempts to understand the'fantasies connected with that real, living animal, the octopus, with which the vampire has been compared. It is, however, the second characteristic of this</page><page sequence="13">Morphology of a Symbol : The Octopus 15 demon, namely, its blood-sucking propensity that is of special interest for us since this is also an outstanding feature in superstitions regarding the octopus. "It is with sucking apparatus that it attacks," writes Hugo. "The victim is op pressed by a vacuum drawing at numberless points: it is not a clawing or a biting, but an indescribable scarification. A tearing of flesh is terrible, but less terrible than a sucking of the blood. Claws are harmless compared with the horrible action of these natural air cups. The talons of the wild beast enter into your flesh, but with the cephaloptera it is you who enter into the creature. The muscles swell, the fibers of the body are contorted, the skin cracks under the loathsome oppression, the blood spurts out and mingles horribly with the lymph of the monster, which clings to its victim by innumerable hideous mouths. The The Hydra in corporates itself with the man; the man becomes one with the Hydra. The spectre lies upon you; the devil-fish, hor rible, sucks your life-blood away. He draws you to him, and into himself ; while bound down, glued to the ground, power less, you feel yourself gradually emptied into this horrible pouch." 10, p. 124) Jones explains the blood-sucking characteristic of the vampire belief as stemming from repressed oral sadism of childhood. (11, p. 130) Oral sadism is also one of the fac tors in the origin of myths of female dragons (18) as well as many other female demons of folklore, fairy tales and literature. The infant revels in the pleasure it obtains from nursing at the mother's breast. This situation supports the child's feelings of omnipotence. But upon being weaned or even temporarily denied the nipple it is overcome with rage and desire to bite, tear, drink or devour the entire con tents of the mother's body. Upon the development of its conscience, i.e., its super-ego, these oral aggressive wishes are projected outside itself on to other people or in fantasy con structions such as demons. Thus the child relieves himself of his growing sense of guilt—thus he sets up a defense against it. It is no longer he who wishes to devour the mother; it is a female demon who wishes to devour him.</page><page sequence="14">16 Jacques Schnier SYMBOLISM OF THE OCTOPUS In the case of the octopus and the vampire, the oral sadism attributed to them seems to stem primarily, though not exclusively, from the unconscious urge to recover only the first phase of the nursing situation, i.e., the sucking, not the biting phase—the warm blood being a substitute or sym bol of the warm milk. It is striking how little emphasis is placed on the biting and tearing characteristics of these crea tures. Certain vampire beliefs, themselves, support the in terpretation of the warm blood being a substitute for milk. The German Alp, it is believed, sucks the nipples of men and children, and withdraws milk from women and cows more often than blood. The Drud (devil) of the German Palatinate also sucks the breast of children, while the south ern Slav Mora sucks blood or milk indifferently. There is a popular belief, in certain regions, that owls, like "real" vampires, suck at the udders of cows and the breasts of chil dren. (11, p. 107) The symbolism of the vampire, like many other demon creations, is overdetermined. But since it apparently in volves the projection of impulses stemming from a child mother relationship we might expect a preponderance of female references. This is the case in Kipling's vampire poem and in American slang, especially in the daily speech of Hollywood. In the latter area, a vampire invariably means an irresistible female siren lover who drains away her lover's energy, ambition and even life, for selfish reasons. Like the vampire, the sex of the octopus is also over determined, but in most instances it is obviously feminine. A young lady who had used an octopus motif in an art de sign, when questioned by a child as to the sex of the animal, answered "female", without much thought. On second con sideration she was not sure why it should be so. A young man when talking about the octopus stated, "when it is moving about beautifully, I think of it as female, but when it is attacking, it is male." A second young man who had used the octopus in creative work, said, "It reminds me of</page><page sequence="15">PLATE I WOOD-BLOCK PB INT BY KUNTYOKT (1797-1861)</page><page sequence="16">PLATE II Figure 1.

You know that a dragon requires a young woman to devour as a tribute." But even behind this apparently male dragon there lurks the female, implied by features such as the cave into which it is necessary to enter to attack it. This recalls Gilliatt's battle with the octopus referred to above; like the knight, he also enters a cave to meet his adversary. The similarity between the dragon and the octopus is marked in a Polynesian myth in which the dragon appears in a very instructive series of manifestations obviously of female symbolic significance. The first form assumed by the monster in this story is a gaping shellfish of enormous size; then it appears as a mighty octopus, and lastly, as a whale, into whose jaws the hero Nganaoa springs, as his represen tatives are said to have done elsewhere throughout the world. (19, p. 172) Though referred to several times as a "he" the female identity of the octopus is finally revealed in the fantasy called "The Octopus" related to me by a ten year old boy who referred to himself on this occasion as Octe Pie. ' ' Some time ago when it was raining a frog jumped under the lily pad and went to sleep. Here the frog was awakened by a minnow, who said, 'There is one channel you haven't ex plored under the lily pad—it goes to the ocean. There is an octopus there which you can visit without going overland. The frog said, 'Thank you' and then forgot the information. Later it came back to his mind and he went down to see if there was a channel. His sixth sense told him where to go. Then a most surprising thing happened. There was a sign at the bottom which said, 'This "Way to the Ocean.' The frog said this must be the channel so he went into the hole. Strange as it may seem he didn't have to hold his breath underwater. Five minutes later after much swimming he came to the top in mid-ocean and there he saw the octopus. The octopus, who was a little cuckoo in the noodle said to the frog, 'Am I a little orange?' The frog answered, 'of</page><page sequence="20">22 Jacques Schnier course you are!' 'If I am orange I will seat you up,' said the octopus, 'because I made a resolution that if you said I was orange, I'd eat you. If you had said I was green I wouldn't.' Just then machine gun bullets started spitting the water (this was on the Korean battlefront) and hit the octopus in the head and killed him. At this instant the most beautiful fairy appeared and said to the frog, 'I will change you into your old self the Prince of England who has been missing three weeks,' and then the fairy continued, 'An old witch transformed you in your sleep and later I captured the witch and killed her. Now all I have to do is change you into your old shape. This witch who was secretly the octopus was killed by me, ' and then she said, ' By the way there were two witches (sisters). One got killed two weeks ago by me and the other by me now.' " Since this study of the octopus symbol converges at sev eral points on the dragon symbol it seems appropriate to re late the associations of a writer, with a noticeable speech defect, to this phantasy animal. Commenting on the idea of a "dragon lady", he remarked, "When I was in Paris, I became passionately attracted to a statue in the Luxem burg, which depicted a female with the attributes of a dragon embracing a young man who is kissing her. As he does so, she buries her claws into him and rips out his heart. She was full breasted and characteristically feminine. The statue fascinated me and I was irresistably drawn to it time and again. This reminds me of a novel I started to compose when I was fifteen years old. It was patterned after Hawthorne's 'Rappaccini's Daughter' (Mosses from the Old Manse) based on the theme of a scientist who imbues his daughter with poison so that anything she breathes on will die. A young man wishes to marry the woman but when he finds out that her breath is poisonous and will kill him, he changes his mind. About this time I came across Keat's poem 'Lamia,' the story of man in love with a woman supposed to be a serpent, and decided to use this theme instead for my novel, but I never finished it." Here, the three art themes of a full-breasted destructive dragon, a poison-breathing young</page><page sequence="21">Morphology of a Symbol : The Octopus 23 woman and the man-devouring female monster of the Greeks form a striking series of associations which dramatically symbolize the writer's own unconscious cannibalistic attitude towards women. THE OCTOPUS AND THE SPIDER Another animal, in this case a real one, with which the octopus is compared is the spider. Hugo, in addition to associating the octopus to the Hydra, the Medusa head and a vampire, writes, " (Gilliatt) had thrust his arms deep into the opening; the monster had snapped at it. It held him fast, as the spider holds the fly." (10, p. 125) Another author, writing about the octopus, states, "He does not pur sue his prey; he waits like some unimaginable spider in the center of his web of far reaching tentacles, with his huge eyes piercing the surrounding sepia-stained waters until a quiver from one of the outlying arms sets the abysmal mouth agape, the mighty parrot-like mandibles clashing as the strug gling victim is conveyed inwards." (3, p. 140) A vivid comparison of the octopus with the spider is portrayed in a moving picture based on an Arabian Night theme. The hero, a little boy is chased by a jinnee to a temple of a goddess. Climbing through a passageway which is too small for the jinnee to follow, the boy enters a secret sanctum which houses a large image of the goddess. On her forehead is a precious eye-like jewel, which, although taboo, he sets out to obtain. But in order to do so he must climb through the threads of an enormous web at the top of which crouches a giant spider. Below him in the deep waters at the base of the image lies an octopus in wait. Fin ally he cuts the web thus causing the giant spider to fall to the octopus below. (14) In fantasies such as this, patterned after the Scylla and Charybdis myth, the two alternative dangers possibly stem from a single source. In other words, Scylla and Charybdis, the spider and the octopus, are mani festations of the same unconscious fear of the mother. The fact that the female spider is far superior in size to the male, and after intercourse buries her mandibles in him</page><page sequence="22">24 Jacques Schnier and drains him of his blood, makes this insect an admirable symbol for the pregenital hostile oral instincts. Sterba, in an interesting article, (21, p. 21) refers to a short story by Hanns Heinz Ewers which dramatically reveals a relation ship between spiders and oral sadism. It concerns a young student who sets out to discover the cause of a series of three suicides in a certain hotel room. In each case the method of death is the same—by hanging—and from each of the three corpses, when it is found, runs a spider. After moving into the room, the student soon discovers a woman at a win dow opposite his. According to his description of her, re corded in his diary, she has all the attributes of a spider— her little teeth taper off in points like the teeth of beasts of prey, she wears black gloves, she spins, and her thin black fingers take up and draw the threads as though they inter mingled like a mass of insect legs. He becomes so fascinated by her that he imitates her every gesture even to the extent of being brought to her complete submission and finally to commit suicide. The origin of the fantasied devouring, blood-sucking spider woman, as a projection of his own unconscious oral sadistic urges is dramatically and artistically portrayed by the condition in which he is found hanging. Crushed be tween his strong teeth is a great black spider with extraor dinary purple spots on its body like those on the black dress worn by the lady at the window opposite. That his sadistic attack on the spider stemmed primarily from the first or sucking phase of the oral stage, as in the case of fantasy attacks by octopuses, is suggested by an entry in his diary shortly after he started his experiment. It concerns his observation, in the hallway of the hotel, of a post-love epi sode between a large female spider and her mate. Having consumated the love act, the male throws every atom of his strength to escape his lover's web. "Too late, the female already had a grip on him and carried him back to the very middle of the web. And this same place which had served as a bed for their voluptuous pleasure was now the scene of quite another drama. In vain the lover struggled, straining</page><page sequence="23">Morphology of a Symbol : The Octopus 25 his weak legs in an effort to escape the wild embrace; the female would not release him. In a few minutes she had spun him into the web so that he couldn't move a limb. Then she struck him with her sharp mandibles and sucked in great draughts of her lover's young blood." (21, p. 25) The associations of a young lady eighteen years old pro vide additional evidence of a relationship between the octo pus and spider symbols. "I am fascinated by the octopus— the way it looks and moves in the water. I have a fascina tion for all multilegged creatures—many armed or many leg ged creatures. But spiders frighten me. I have a fear of them. It's probably because I once saw a movie, Swiss Fam ily Robinson. A young man wanted to go into a cave, the entrance to which was blocked by the web of an enormous spider. As he tried to get past the web, the enormous black spider pounces down and overpowers him." In another instance she said, "When I think of an octopus I remember seeing one moving across a small tank in the aquarium and it was a thing of beautiful movement—graceful, slow, but cer tain—and I remember I was surprised to see the filminess of skin between the arms. It reminds me of a kind of material— soft and flowing of a woman's gown." Here, evidently, the ambivalent feelings towards the mother are expressed by use of separate symbols—the octopus for attraction and love, and the spider for fear and hate. Further comparison of the octopus with the spider is contained in a case reported by M. M. Stern. A female analyzand in associating to a free-painting of an octopus like spider said, "At four years, I had my tonsils out. I remember exactly, going under the ether. I always awak ened in the middle of the night, for fear a spider had fallen into my hair, and screamed. The red eyes.—it is like the inside showing at the outside. Yesterday I swallowed a fly. Last year at Halloween they were "bobbing for apples"; I couldn't do it; I couldn't bite into the apples. I was afraid to put my head under water. Mother's breasts were operated on, brr! When I am not satisfied sexually, I am furious; my stomach is growling, I am coughing. The black widow</page><page sequence="24">26 Jacques Sehnier spiders are fatal. I always thought spiders were very big and that they would overpower me. They would open up their legs and swallow me. Pear of being choked, like worms choke, like an octopus chokes." (20, p. 80) Stern comments that, "Spiders as well as octopuses and crabs are typical nightmare symbols." His catagorization of the octopus with the crab recalls the fact that in Victor Hugo's story, Gilliatt encounters the octopus while in a cave, as he reaches into a dark crevice in search of a crab. From our knowledge of the unconscious meaning of associated ideas we are led to consider the crab and the octopus as hav ing the same general symbolic significance. Granting this, the monstrous crab in front of the octopus in the Kunoyshi print, referred to earlier, would then be an avatar of the octopus and, thus, an incarnation of the dreaded mother. Since, however, the crab, unlike the octopus is actually dan gerous because of its powerful cutting claws, and in this instance holds aloft the great samurai sword, it probably symbolizes, not only the devouring mother, but also the cas trating phallic mother. MYCENAEAN OCTOPUS SYMBOL Returning to the Mycenaean octopus design, as pointed out above, this symbol passed through a number of structural changes leading eventually towards the stylization of the animal into a female demon-like face. Fururmark in his definitive work presents the chronology of these changes for an interval from 1550 to 1075 B.C., a span of almost 500 years. This interval he divides into eleven historical and stylistic periods made up of three main (I, II, III) and eight sub-periods. (9, p. 115) Figures 1 to 17 in the charts (plate III) reproduced from Fururmark's work, represent the types of octopus design used during some of these periods. In studying the chronological series it is obvious that, where as the artist-potter of the Mycenaean II A period visualized the octopus in a form not far removed from its natural shape and customary position when at rest, potters from the My cenaean II B to the III C period visualized it upside down</page><page sequence="25">Morphology of a Symbol : The Octopus 27 and more and more as a female demon head (female, because of the long snake-like strands of hair streaming from what now appears to be the top of the head, as illustrated in (plate III, fig. 2, 3, 11; and plate IV). It is also obvious, even to the non-psychoanalytically oriented observer, that late de signs such as plate III, figures 7, 9, 12, 14 and 16 are phallic symbols. But since the bearer of this organ is evidently female we are led to interpret it as a representation of the unconscious fantasy of the phallic woman, the prototype of which is the fantasied phallic mother. Taking all these observable facts into consideration it appears that we are standing on ground as firm as that which supports many conclusions in the social sciences when we interpret the Mycenaean octopus symbol as signifying the unconscious fantasy of the female with a penis. But when we ask ourselves what was the meaning of these ancient Greeks' fantasy, we have no other recourse than to compare it with what we have learned about the octopus and phallic woman fantasy in other cultures, past and present, and our own analyzands. On the basis of these analogies and the assumption of a universal similarity in unconscious mental processes of the human mind, we can then hazard our in terpretations. If this is conjecture, then let it be considered as such. In many instances, the astronomer, the physicist, the mathematician operate no differently. Prom the mass, distance, time, and spectroscopic elements measurable in the here and now on our earth, the astronomer computes the mass, distance, composition and time elements relative to bodies millions of light years away. For the present it is the best he can do and generally speaking his method is considered scientifically acceptable. Extensive psychoanalytic investigation of man's fantasy concerning a woman with a penis has been found to stem from several possible unconscious sources. One, already re ferred to in connection with Freud's interpretation of the Medusa head, is man's fear of castration which is mitigated by the fantasy of supplying the penisless female with a male organ. If the female has an organ, or, if she has never lost</page><page sequence="26">28 Jacques Schnier it, then the male need never fear the loss of his. The snake like strands of hair emanating from the Medusa head may also symbolize the penis in polyphallic form as multiple as surance against castration. Flügel, in commenting on this feature points out that myths of a great goddess in octopus form are found in many parts of the world. He explains its use as a symbol of the vulva, "when the sight of the latter had become distasteful owing to its association with the ideas of castration." (7) A further source of the fantasy of the phallic woman is the repressed oral tendencies which unconsciously sees in the fantasied penis, the mother's nipple, displaced from above downward, and long sought for since childhood. This fre quently is found to be the meaning of cunnilingus fantasies and practices in analyzands. On the other hand, since it is conceivable that the artist-potters of the Mycenaeans may have been women we should not overlook possible symbolic significance specific for the female. Here again we must fall back upon present day psychoanalytic observation which reveals the extremely common unconscious wish in many women to have a penis just like a man. At ths point, I should like to refer once more to the comparison of the octopus with the Medusa head. One of the striking features of late Mycenaean octopus design is the transformation of the tentacles into strands of wavy hair that give the appearance of a pattern of writhing snakes. The association of the octopus tentacles with snakes is, of course, not uncommon. Miss A. 6. Iken (7, p. 163) reports a vivid fantasy experienced by a woman during a delirium tremens attack: "... snakes, twining in and out of curtain and curtain poles—gibbering faces, animal and grotesque cari catures of human beings, glaring at me from all sides. . . Caves full of slimy prehistoric monsters through which I had to pass, ichthyosauri, dinosauri, ugly many-headed reptiles, octopuses stretching out their ghastly tentacles to grip. . . snakes swarmed all over, even my own fingers turned into snakes and bending back twined themselves with cold slimy bodies round my arms." But it is the translation of the</page><page sequence="27">Morphology of a Symbol : The Octopus 29 mass of snakes into a head of hair, specifically that of a woman's, to which I wish to direct attention. Now it is just this feature which is also one of the striking characteristics of the Medusa head. And since the Medusa head was created in the very same area in which the octopus was a dominant decorative motif, I am tempted to suggest that this animal provided the ancient Greeks with the first prototype or in spiration for the creation of their Medusa head.* This leads me to conjecture the origin of the large pantheon of multi-headed and multi-armed gods and goddesses in oriental religious systems, e.g., the Thousand Armed Kwannon of the Japanese. May it not be that here also the multi-armed and multi-legged living forms such as the octopus, crab, centi pede, millipede, etc., which primitive man undoubtedly ex perienced long before the advent of formalized religion, pro vided him with the original prototypes for the symbols of unconscious thoughts which later were expressed in multi limbed anthropomorphic shapes? SUMMARY Now to summarize the material that has been gathered from anthropological, literary and clinical sources in our study of the octopus symbol ; we can say first, that its mean ing is highly overdetermined. In any given context, whether myth, art or personal fantasy, it may have one or a multiple of unconscious roots. It may function as a defense against fear of castration—supplying in fantasy a penis to the object identified as female. By endowing the tentacles with phallic attributes, a polyphallic symbol is created. Because of its suction discs, gripping and entwining characteristics, it can act as a defense for overwhelming guilt feelings originating in powerful oral impulses. By projecting the oral impulses originally directed toward the mother onto the sucking discs ""After the completion of this investigation, Professor H. R. W. Smith, a classical scholar, called my attention to the fact that W. H. Roscher, in his Ausführliches Lexikon der Griechischen und Römischen Mytholo gie, (1884), had already commented on this possible relationship between the Medusa head and the octopus.</page><page sequence="28">30 Jacques Schnier and grasping tentacles, fear of one's own destructive tend encies is abated. In certain instances, the parrot-like beak capable of biting and tearing may also be significant in this respect. For women, the resentment resulting from the ob servation of a missing member, can be resolved by the fantasy of a female object equipped with an organ or multiples of it. 1637 Taylor Street San Francisco 11, Calif.
