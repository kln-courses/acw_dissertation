      <p>The question of how human language evolved has fascinated us for millennia. One of the reasons is the assumption that language is a purely human characteristic, a demarcation between us and other animals. Darwin's theory challenged such demarcations, and the question of language and its evolution became a focal point for debate. Radick's fascinating intellectual history of the tussles that then arose is not only hugely informative and enjoyable, but it also highlights important philosophical and historical ideas about the nature of scientific method.</p>
      <p>The initial part of the book details the 19th‐century debates about whether language could have evolved, and whether nonhuman animals can ever be said to have language. It departs from some early experiments carried out by Richard Garner, who used recordings of animal sounds to argue that apes possess a “rudimentary language.” Radick then turns to how the developing disciplines of anthropology and psychology throughout the 20th century introduced new kinds of assumptions about the evolution of language, and concludes by tracing the development of the ethological approaches to animal communication systems that culminated in the famous signing and symbol‐using chimpanzee studies of the 1960s and 1970s. Throughout, Radick highlights how various ideas emerge and reemerge in the intellectual history: anthropomorphism, gradualism versus catastrophic change in evolution, the usefulness of neuroanatomy as evidence for psychology, the connection between language and thought, the impact of cultural prejudice on scientific hypothesizing, and the very possibility of testable hypotheses about the nature of the mind.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the book does not take us up to present‐day arguments about language evolution, once again a hot topic. However, since exactly the same issues are still crucial, it will give readers a long view of this newly important debate.</p>
