<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1993 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA By Ruben S. Badaljan, Philip L. Kohl, David Stronach and Armen V. Tonikjan Yerevan, Wellesley, Massachussetts, and Berkeley Collaborative American-Armenian and American- Georgian archaeological investigations on the Shirak plain of northwestern Armenia and the Djavakheti plateau of southern Georgia (see below: Appendix A) began during the summer of 1990 as the principal, regionally-focused field component of the more broadly conceived and structured International Program for Anthropological Research in the Caucasus (or IPARC). The 1990 and 1992 excavations at the site of Horom, Armenia have been reported in previous volumes of Iran (Badaljan et al. 1992 and 1993), while the 1990 and 1991 field seasons in Georgia, particularly at the Early Bronze Age site of Satkhe, have been briefly described in the Bulletin of the Asia Institute (Kohl et al. 1992). This report presents the preliminary results of the 1993 excavations at Horom1 and includes the Palaeolithic investi- gations and later Bronze and Iron Age pre- historic excavations in southern Georgia in Appendix A.2 On the basis primarily of surface reconnaissances and topographic mapping undertaken in 1990, the c. 45-50 ha. Horom settlement, which is centered around two dominant hills set along a north-south axis (the North and South Hills) and characterised by standing cyclopean stone architecture, was distin- guished from a c. 400 ha. mapped area termed the Horom site, which consists of undulating, rocky terrain containing stone structures of uncertain date and clusters of circular stone-ringed tombs or cromlechs dating to the late second or early first millennium B.C. (Badaljan et al. 1992: fig. 3). The Horom settlement was located within the northwest- ern quadrant of the Horom site. This view may need to be modified in as much as additional stone struc- tures, including possible fortifications, were recently noted to the east and southeast of the Horom settlement, and future excavations within such outlying structures may relate them to the Iron Age Urartian fortifications on the North Hill. Thus, the overall size of the fortified settlement remains unclear, and the 45-50 ha. figure could well rep- resent a minimal estimate. At the end of the 1993 season, photographs taken from a heli- copter provided a series of aerial views of the Horom settlement and its cyclopean architecture (Pl. Ia-b).3 NORTH HILL EXCAVATIONS Constructions of Urartian Date While no materials of early first millennium B.C. date chanced to come to light within the restricted sounding of 1990, the results of the 1992 and 1993 excavations have made it clear that the major visible fortifications on the North Hill are to be ascribed to the Urartian period. In more precise terms the period in question is likely to have lasted for more than a century and a half, between the time that Argishti I (c. 785-760 B.C.) annexed the present- day region of the Shirak plain (cf. Badaljan et al. 1993: 15) and the moment when the kingdom of Urartu came to an abrupt end, somewhere close to 600 B.C. The association of wheelmade, buff to red pot- tery of an Urartian or Urartian-related type with grey wares which clearly continue a local Late Bronze/Early Iron Age ceramic tradition is currently firmly documented from Operations Bi, B2, C2, and D1 (Fig. 5). The association was first acknowl- edged during the 1992 season (Badaljan et al. 1993: 12-23), and the work of the past summer, in Areas B2 and D1 in particular, has continued to demon- strate the strength of this connection. Above all, the recent discovery of a small cosmetic jar of a known Urartian type (Fig. 5: 19, P1. Ic), such as occurs else- where at Bastam, for example (Kleiss et al. 1979: 208, fig. 3, 5) in the deep fill of one of the better preserved rooms of the B2 area (Room 3 of B2 com- plex see Fig. 3, P1. IIa) has underlined the likeli- hood that the more intact magazines of the eighth/seventh century B.C. "border settlement" at Horom will one day serve to document the extent to which the local Iron Age wares of the Shirak plain were complemented by elements of the well- known ceramic corpus of the Urartian core area. In the balance of this report all Horom's archi- tectural remains of the eighth/seventh century B.C. are referred to as "Urartian". It should be under- stood, however, that this label deserves to be read in several separate ways. On the one hand, the label is used with the above-mentioned chronological con- notation and, on the other hand, it is intended to be indicative of a period of intense interaction with Urartu or of the citadel's physical incorporation-at 1</page><page sequence="2">2 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES least at certain times, within the accepted bound- aries of the Urartian state. In other words, the pre- sent writers are acutely aware that, while the presently exposed architecture on the North Hill offers its fair share of Urartian traits, the site as a whole has so far produced remarkably few incontro- vertible Urartian artefacts. But it may also be noted before we proceed to review the work of the past season which took place in Operations A2/3, B2, and D1 that the small piece of a bronze quiver that was found on the heavily burnt roadway of the BI North-West Gate at the end of the 1992 season (Badaljan et al. 1993: 12-15 and pl. IId) was dec- orated in a distinctive fashion; i.e., it was marked by groups of transverse ridges in repousse (P1. Id) in a design that otherwise occurs on a group of five bronze quivers from the Urartian citadel at Kayalidere (Burney 1966: pl. 18c). The 1992 Operations B1 and C2 were not con- tinued in 1993, but several architectural features including a stone-covered drain extending down the central axis of the B1 North-West Gate, which were uncovered at the very end of the 1992 season, were accurately mapped. We hope to continue work in these two areas in future seasons. Operation A2/3 (Figs. 1 and 2) Early in the 1993 season a small, exploratory trench, only 3 x 3.5 m. in size, was opened on the flat summit of the North Hill near the presumed northeastern corner of the A terrace. The precise location of this probe, called Operation A2, was determined by the presence of stone remains that were visible inside an animal burrow. Although the exposure was limited, stone architecture was encountered, and a thick Early Mediaeval deposit was explored to a depth of 1.5 m. In the course of the work, a large, complete storage vessel of Mediaeval date was removed, and an adjoining burnt surface yielded a rich cache of well-preserved carbonised seeds. It was subsequently decided that it would be of advantage to extend the excavation for a distance of 9 m. to the northeast down the slope of the A terrace. It was hoped that the extension, termed A3, would throw useful light on the still little examined uppermost line of Urartian fortifications and that it would also serve to reveal any subsidiary architec- tural features that might have been built up against the inner face of the A Wall. To begin with, work in the A3 extension proved to be a considerable chal- lenge: a nearly unbroken sequence of parallel stone faces was found to extend throughout the eastern end of the narrow trench. It was only when the outer face of the A Wall was at last exposed, in fact, that this apparent sequence of "walls" could be read as a series of monumental steps that advance, for a distance of 6 m., up the steep slope to the line of the flat summit. While much more of the A Wall needs to be exposed in order to understand its con- struction in full, it does now appear that we have uncovered the point at which the A Wall turned to the north-west, in accord with the natural contours of the North Hill (Fig. 1), and that the wide series of steps very probably functioned as a socle for the now missing stone superstructure that pre- sumably once defended the flat summit at the apex of the whole Urartian fortification system. The materials from the eroded, steeply sloping terrain of Operation A3 included, hardly against expectation, examples of Urartian red ware mixed with sherds of known (and presumed) Mediaeval date. Operation B2: Architecture located on the B Terrace inside the Inner Face of the B Fortification Wall (Fig. 3, P1. IIa) From the prior account of the work that was carried out in Operation B2 during the 1992 season (Badaljan et al. 1993: 15-18, fig. 13), it will be recalled that this part of the site (Fig. 3 and P1. IIa) had already revealed well-preserved architecture that was located just inside the inner face of the B Fortification Wall. Accordingly, excavations were at once resumed in Room 2, one of two adjoining rooms (Rooms 1 and 2) that had been at least partially defined in 1992. Since the floor of Room 2 had only been reached within the limits of a small test trench in the course of the previous campaign, one of our first concerns was to expose the remain- ing, available floor surface. The only feature of note to come to light in the course of this endeavor con- sisted of the remains of a clay walled oven (or tanur), the floor of which was still covered by a layer of ash. The flue which had been used to draw air into the oven was also detected; it could be seen to have been sunk into the top of the earth floor, near the middle portion of the room, close to Wall 2 (P1. IIb). It ought to be added, however, that such a distinctly domestic feature offers a curious contrast to the monumental walls which adjoin it; for this reason, therefore, the oven could well represent a later feature which is not to be connected with the otherwise undetermined, orginal function of Room 2. As far as the 1993 extensions to Operation B2 are concerned, these took the form of the B2.3 trench to the south, where Rooms 3 and 4 were exposed; the B2.4 trench to the west, where a well-preserved room or corridor, Room 5, was uncovered; and the B2.5 trench to the north, where the work disclosed a number of barely sub-surface, one-to-two course</page><page sequence="3">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1993 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 3 f oo ++ 1620 2B C2 E2 C40 , El // 5M5 .. . .. ? ???... ...... 20 0 0 100 ~cM4 m ......~rr\~~~r~,+ mM . . .. . . . . .. .

Indeed, the narrow walls in B2.5 (Fig. 4) are almost certainly contemporary with two other virtually sub-surface, insubstantial walls (Features 1 and 2) which were found to run above the massive, two metre and more high remains of Wall 6. In sum, then, this single part of the Horom settlement may be said to offer persuasive evidence for the existence of a later, less monumental period of occupation that was either Late Urartian or post-Urartian in date (see Fig. 7).4 It is tempting, of course, to link the thin stone walls which eventually came to be erected over the abandoned B2 complex with other examples of inferior, very often clearly secondary construction that have been noted in other sections of the North Hill. One of the more striking instances of late, secondary building activity may be said to come from the BI North-West Gateway, where the so- called guardroom represents an obvious late addi- tion to the original fabric of the Gate (Badaljan et al. 1993: 15 and pl. IIc). In addition, it would not be at all surprising to find that the whole of the D1 complex (Fig. 8), which has for long been seen to stand outside the limits of the otherwise formidable fortification system on the North Hill (see below and Badaljan et al. 1992: 44-5), was itself representative of such a widespread, late building phase. While the ceramics from the North-West Gate, B2.5, and D1 are clearly similar, with each contain- ing well-fired Urartian red wares together with grey wares of the still persisting local Late Bronze/Early Iron Age tradition, Operations B2.5 and D1 are alone in also producing sherds of still another kind with either wavy-combed or pattern-burnished decoration (Fig. 6: 13, 14 and Fig. 9). Eventually, therefore, pottery of this latter type may come to serve as a valuable, separate indication of late occu- pation. As for the relationship of such a late phase of occupation to the date of the fire which ravaged the North-West Gate, it is a matter of decided interest that the traces of extensive burning on the BI road- way were found to run up against the exterior of the already extant east wall of the above-mentioned "guardroom". In other words, we can be sure that at least some of the late and very largely inferior stone walling on the North Hill pre-dates rather than post-dates the time of the Gate's destruction. For the present, therefore, it may be justified to cate- gorise the more or less massive Urartian architec- ture on the North Hill as "Early Urartian" and those examples of clearly related, but assuredly later, local building activity as "Late Urartian."

IIa-c and Fig. 3).5 With respect to two of the rooms (Rooms 2 and 3), certain of the walls were also found to retain traces of a plaster surface. Doorways are, of course, well represented. One doorway linked the seemingly paired square rooms, Rooms 3 and 4 (Pl. IIc); another connected Room 3 with a still unexcavated room to the south (P1. IIc); and yet another provided a link between Rooms 5 and 2, at least until such time as the west wall of the latter room (Wall 4) came to be widened over the greater part of its length (Fig. 3).6 Of special interest, of course, is the perfectly preserved door- way between Rooms 3 and 4; rectangular in shape, and capped by flat stones, the doorway was given a height of almost 2 m. and a width of 89 cm. Needless to say, the doorway's all-stone frame was predetermined by the exclusive use of stone in these ground floor walls, many of which still stand to a height of 3 m. Last but not least, a still not fully defined opening at the north end of Room 5 is likely to have provided access to yet other associated rooms, including Room 1. The number of small objects from Rooms 2-5 was not large, but the discovery in Room 3 of the above-mentioned cosmetic jar (P1. Ic, Fig. 5: 19) and a fragment of a large storage jar with a seal impression (P1. Ie) could perhaps indicate that this part of the site was occupied, at one time, by admin- istrators or, at all events, by residents of some status. Other finds of note include a winged bronze arrow- head from the north end of Room 5 which directly accords with a standard Caucasian type that was current for a period of several centuries both before and after 1000 B.C.,7 and a more perplexing object: namely, an iron door-key (Pi. IIe), also from Room 5, which looks strangely out of place in an eighth/seventh century B.C. context. That is to say that, while the key was indeed recovered from the floor of Room 5 near the later blocked doorway that led into Room 2, it has an oddly modern appearance; and, in view of the local presence of many animal holes, its actual find spot could be for- tuitous. Finally, it should be noted that Early Bronze Kura-Araxes sherds chanced to be found beneath the floors of both Rooms 3 and 5. In other words, the whole of the B2 complex would appear to have been built over a much earlier Early Bronze Age occupation-a finding which is also consistent with the discovery, in 1992, of an Early Bronze tomb in the C1 Operation (Fig. 3 and 7), beyond the outer or eastern face of the B Fortification Wall (Badaljan et al. 1993: 4 and pl. Ia). Operation D1-Domestic Architecture on the D Terrace (Fig. 8) Prior to excavations in the D 1 Area, it was specu- lated that the whole of the unfortified D Terrace, which is so very different in appearance from the various fortified sectors of the North Hill (Fig. 1), could have represented the remains of a separate "administrative complex" (Badaljan et al. 1992: 44-5). In the aftermath of the 1992 campaign this characterisation remained unchallenged, if only because it seemed premature to rush to conclusions on the basis of two strictly limited, local probes. Indeed, the one clear message that emerged from the 1992 excavations in this part of the site was the fact that all construction on the D Terrace could have been restricted to a "relatively late date" within the time-frame of Horom's eighth/seventh century B.C. occupation (Badaljan et al. 1993: 21). On the one hand, the work of the 1993 season has clearly strengthened the case for such a probable late date (see page 4 above), and, on the other hand, there is now a sound case to be made for the domestic, rather than the representational-or administrative -character of those D1 structures (Rooms 1-3) that have been examined to-date. Of the rooms in question-all of which run along the same north-south axis-Room 1 was exca- vated in its entirety in 1992. It is a sub-rectangular unit, 6.7 x 3.8 m. in area, with a flagstone floor and with a broad stone platform located in front of its slightly curved western wall (Fig. 8). In accord, moreover, with the less than regular character of the walls of Room 1, the corridor which leads north- wards to the next room, Room 2, consists of no more than a narrow, bent passage of irregular width. Because of other calls on our time and resources, only about one third of Room 2's total floor area of 8 x 9.5 m. came to be exposed in 1992. The main features to emerge in the course of the excavation consisted of a large, squarish basin of pink tuff set close to the line of the west wall (Badaljan et al. 1993: pl. IIIe) and a low "double partition" (com- posed of two parallel rows of slim stones set on edge) which stood perpendicular to the west wall. The presence of this last fixture, and the consider- able size of Room 2, suggested at the time that the room might have been subdivided into several sepa- rate "cubicles" and that, in addition, the whole space might have remained unroofed. Following the 1993 season, however, new assessments are in order. In the first place, the discovery of four sym- metrically placed stone column bases (Fig. 8, P1. IId) would seem to prove that Room 2 was roofed; and, secondly, if due account is taken of cer-</page><page sequence="7">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1993 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 7 HOROM 1992-93 AREA B2 UPPER LEVELS O 1 2M Fig. 4.

Thus, while the tuff basin, which stands on a low stone platform, almost certainly represented a suitable water container, both the original east-west partition, and a newly exposed double partition, are likely to have served as feeding troughs-presumably if the width of the doorways is kept in mind, for ani- mals of rather modest size, such as sheep and goat. Since the two long feeding troughs appear to have been sited in such a way as to take advantage of the presence of three of the four columns (Fig. 8), it is also possible that there was a time when Room 2 was roofed, but not yet used as an animal shelter. In this last regard it is in fact evident that Room 2 retained a rival identity right to the end. That is to say that parts of the room were supplied with a well-laid flagstone floor and that a variety of domestic activities continued to be pursued, espe- cially towards the north end of the room. Many pestle-shaped ground stones were recovered, for example, in an area of the room where both a circu- lar stone-lined hearth (Feature 7) and an adjacent stone table (Feature 9) were located. In addition, a small stone-lined pit (Feature 8) may have been used-again on the analogy of contemporary practices-to collect glowing coals from the nearby large stone-lined hearth. An entry from Room 2 to the north led into the slightly smaller, irregularly-shaped Room 3. This room contained four large flat grinding stones set on a stone platform (Feature 1) in its north-eastern corner. The remains of a hearth (Feature 2), possi- bly for baking bread, lay immediately to the south, and to its west lay a shallow circular stone "milling" basin, similar in form-though not necessarily func- tion-with those repeatedly uncovered on the top of the South Hill. If Room 2 housed animals, Room 3 may have functioned as a bakery. Room 3 also was connected to another room on its northern side, which will be excavated in the future. As one pro- ceeds north in this interconnected complex, the depth of deposit increases, exceeding in places 1.5 m. Noteworthy also were the remains of charred 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 18 __19 12 13 14 15 16 i 17 li Fig. 5. Ceramics from B2 Complex.

The evidence suggests that this complex may have been devastated by fire and recalls the evidence for large- scale burning from the Bi North-West Gate area. The D1 complex, which presently appears to have a substantial domestic character, seems to have been occupied during one period, presumably in Late Urartian times. The ceramics from the area consis- tently include a significant component (c. 20 per cent) of fine Urartian red wares, similar to those found in the Ararat Valley to the south, as well as more numerous wares continuing the local Shirak ceramic traditions of the Late Bronze/Early Iron periods. As noted above, a few more elaborately dec- orated vessels (Fig. 9) from this trench together with those from B2.5 may help define the Late or immedi- ately Post-Urartian phase at Horom. Three radiocarbon dates taken from the 1992 excavations in the B1 and B2 areas were received from the AMS Facility of the University of Arizona: 1) sample no. AA-10194--B1 a-c, gateway: 2,520+/-55 (yr BP) or calibrated at 790-430 B.C. (1 sigma; or 800-410 B.C. at 2 sigma); 2) AA-10189-B2, locus 4, north of Feature 8: 2465+/-55 (yr BP) or calibrated at 760-410 B.C. (1 sigma; or 790-400 B.C. at 2 sigma); and 3) AA-11129-B2, TT4, level 4 (beneath the earliest floor of Room 2): 2770+/-55 or calibrat- ed at 970-830 B.C. (1 sigma; or 1050-800 B.C. at 2 sigma). The dates are not enormously helpful for refining the Urartian chronology at Horom, since their calibrated ranges simply preclude any further subdivisions. The AA11129 date from the 1992 deep sounding beneath the eastern third of Room 2 is somewhat surprising in that it suggests that there may have been an immediately pre-Urartian occupa- tion in this area of Horom which presumably had been totally destroyed by the construction of the B Fortification Wall and the high-standing architecture 8 9 10 11 13 14 12 Fig. 6.

The Second Millennium Occupation and the Early Bronze Occupations at Horom and Anushavan Operations C3b/5 and E2: the Gate 6 area (Figs. 10 and 11) The initial 1990 sounding at Horom was placed just within and west of Gate 6 in the C Fortification Wall. No distinctive Urartian materials happened to be recovered from this sounding, and for this reason the fortifications on the North Hill were initially dated to the pre-Urartian Early Iron period (Badaljan et al. 1992: 37-41), a conclusion subse- quently corrected after the more extensive 1992 campaign. Additional excavations on both sides of the C Wall and to the east and west of Gate 6 were conducted in 1992 (Badaljan et al. 1993: 4-5, 19-21), and these again confirmed the absence of significant Urartian remains in this area-save, of course, for the C Wall itself. The recovery of several painted Middle Bronze sherds, and a single, surpris- ingly early calibrated C14 date of 1887-1693 B.C. (1 sigma-sample no. AA-7766) from the bottom of the "Early Iron" level in the 1990 sounding sug- gested that occupation in this area could have extended back even into the Middle Bronze period or the first half of the second millennium B.C. Additional work in 1993 reinforces this impres- sion. Work began in C5 which extended 2.5 m. west of the 1992 C3b trench and 4 m. to the north. C5 ultimately was connected with C3b in order to expose a sufficient area to understand the strati- graphic relationship of the diagonally running wall, initially discovered in 1990,8 with the C Fortification Wall. Since this diagonal Wall lb ran beneath the C Fortification Wall, a small 2 x 3 m. trench E2, which was later extended into a 4 x 5 m. sounding, was placed outside the C Wall to trace Wall lb's exten- sion farther to the south-west. Excavations in C3a in1992 did not reach the level at which this wall would have appeared (n.b., the north-eastern con- tinuation of Wall lb into the 1990 sounding is not shown in Fig. 10); nevertheless, a calibrated C14 determination from a surface-C3a, area G, locus 31 - apparently above the wall yielded a date of 1290-1050 B.C. [at 1 sigma; sample AA-10193- 2975+/-55 BP (uncalibrated); or 1370-1010 B.C. calibrated at 2 sigma]. As currently exposed, Wall lb stretches from the northern section of the 1990 sounding across the connected trenches C3a and C5; it then runs under the C Fortification Wall into the trench E2, continuing into its southern section (Figs. 10 and 11 and Badaljan et al. 1992: pl. XIIa). Thus, this massive wall of uncertain function, which extends for at least 10 m. in this area of the North Hill, clearly predates the construction of the C Fortification Wall and presumably is earlier than the calibrated date from C3a; its orientation is</page><page sequence="11">z 0 0 z z &gt; 0 0 zTI ze HOROM 1992-93 AREA DI o0 2M -642 18 O 1641474 BASIN 1641.7,16A2.13 EO BASIN s ROOM 3 SCOL 1641.28 HEARTH BASE 641 26B 16AI.51 ROOM 2 ,,.., 6-FLOOR 00.... oo 81E 1641 I /16A 74 1641 76BASIN O ~ 16A 1. 58 ROOM I )6A I 03 DJ O COL COL BASE 1641 18 BASE 16AI 1 1641.41f 16 I0 CDC Fig. 8.

Although additional work is needed to confirm the stratigraphic relationship of these walls, a picture of a substantial earlier settle- ment in this area of the site, if not even an earlier fortification system, which was subsequently destroyed by the Urartian construction, seems to be coming into focus. During the C5 excavation it became clear that the topmost portion of Wall lb had been cut away by the foundation trench for the C Fortification Wall. As was first noted in 1990, Wall lb appears to have been built in at least two phases (Badaljan et al. 1992: 36-7, fig. 4), the upper phase being partially removed by the construction of the C Wall. Most of the surfaces encountered in C3b/5 and E2 were ephemeral, although one decent plastered surface was uncovered on both sides of Wall lb in C3b/5; and, as far as could be ascertained, this sur- face separated the two building phases of this same wall. As before, no diagnostic Urartian wares appeared in this area. Ceramics from C3b/5 were consistently mixed: dominantly "Early Iron" local grey wares and occasional Middle Bronze painted and impressed wares were associated with the later rebuild of Wall lb; and roughly equal amounts of unmistakeable, black-burnished Early Bronze Kura- Araxes wares and the same type of "Early Iron" wares were associated with the initial construction of Wall lb (P1. IIIa and Fig. 12). Unmixed Early Bronze sherds were only found beneath Wall lb in C3b/5 at the end of the season. Besides ceramics, a stylized anthropomorphic stone head and a few horse bones were recovered from these presumably unmixed Early Bronze levels; the latter have been submitted for radiocarbon analysis. Bedrock was not reached in this operation. The precise dating for the different phases of Wall lb is unclear, and some of the difficulty relates to the uncertainty of the "Early Iron" attribution for all the local grey ware forms. The continuity of the Bronze to Iron Age ceramic tradition on the Shirak plain may be underestimated by recourse to this ter- minology. It is true that most of the surfaces here are fleeting or ephemeral, and that there was con- siderable disturbance in this area associated with the construction of the Urartian fortifications. Nevertheless, the architecture, C14 dates, and ceramics from the different trenches in this area may suggest not so much that the materials are mixed, but that a substantial settlement in this part of the North Hill dates back to the first half of the second millennium B.C., overlying, in turn, a late Early Bronze occupation, dating to the middle or late third millennium B.C, as well as an earlier Early Bronze occupation. A stone cist burial appeared just beneath the sur- face in the south-eastern corner of trench E2; the burial contained the remains of a young juvenile contracted on its right side with its head oriented to the north-west (P1. IIIb). Two undecorated pots (Fig. 13), including a double-handled or lugged grey ware vessel resting on the pelvis, several glass beads (including one with an "evil eye" design), an iron bracelet worn on the skeleton's arm, and a hollow-based brown obsidian arrowhead were found in the burial. Although this burial was not sealed, it clearly postdated Wall ib, which extended across E2 to the west (Fig. 11). The cist burial clearly differed in its form both from the numerous stone-ringed "Early Iron" tombs or cromlechs located east and south of the Horom settlement (see below and Badaljan et al. 1993: 8-12) and from the collective Early Bronze tomb accidently found in trench C1 at the end of the 1992 season (Badaljan</page><page sequence="13">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1993 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 13 HOROM 1992- 93 AREA C3/E2 C3 Wlb E2 S0 1 2M AJ Fig. 10.

Ia). While one grave does not make a cemetery, this stone cist burial may reflect the presence of additional mortuary remains in this area of the site, all of which may date to a period substan- tially later than the construction of Wall ib; i.e., to a time that was immediately pre-Urartian or Urartian. Operation C1 Nearly the entire 1992 C1 trench was excavated down to sterile soil at the beginning of the 1993 sea- son in the hopes of encountering additional collec- tive Early Bronze tombs similar to that excavated in 1992. None were found, though materials recov- ered throughout the trench beneath the surface on which the B Fortification Wall was built were almost exclusively identified as Early Bronze Kura-Araxes wares. As mentioned above, Early Bronze ceramics also were uncovered beneath the Urartian architec- ture in the B2 complex immediately to the west, suggesting that this area of the Horom settlement, like the C3b/5 and E2 area to the south, was occu- pied during the Early Bronze period. Two discrepant C14 dates were obtained from the Early Bronze tomb in CI: sample no. AA-10191 taken from burnt human bone-4505+/-50 BP or calibrated at 3350-3050 B.C. (1 sigma; or 3360-2930 B.C. at 2 sigma); and sample no. AA-11130 which was charcoal from the burnt surface of the tomb-- 5150 +/-60 BP or calibrated at 4070-3810 B.C. (1 sigma; or 4220-3800 B.C. at 2 sigma). A late fourth millennium B.C. date for the typologically early forms of the three Kura-Araxes vessels from this tomb (P1. IIIc) is reasonable, particularly given the revised downdating for the beginnings of this "cul- ture" (see Glumac and Anthony 1992: 203; Kavtaradze 1983); the discrepant, earlier date of the late fifth to early foutth millennium B.C. is prob- lematic. Some of the Early Bronze ceramics recov- ered from the B2/C1 area, as well as many from the C3b/5 area (Fig. 14), exhibit incisions and surface decorations; they are considered typologically late and should indicate a much later mid to late third millennium Early Bronze occupation of the settle- ment as well. While more evidence of the Early Bronze period at Horom needs to be uncovered, particularly from undisturbed levels in different areas of the settle- ment, it is possible that the site may have been occu- pied continuously from the late fourth millennium B.C. onwards, the major difficulty, of course, being that the Iron Age levels either overlie and/or have partially destroyed strata containing the Early Bronze materials. It remains the case, however, that Early Bronze remains have been encountered beneath the Iron levels in all the operations at Horom, except for the excavations on the summit HOROM 1992-93 AREA E2/C3 E2 -- - ---- C3 FORTIFICATION WALL C REBUILD TOMB O WALL lb SECTION A -A O 1 2M Fig. 11.

Two light grey pots from E2 burial. of the South Hill, and this suggests that the occupa- tion may have been fairly substantial, larger possibly than other known Kura-Araxes settlements, such as Karnut, on the Shirak Plain and, more generally, within highland Transcaucasia. The Early Bronze Settlement at Anushavan Due to the difficulty of exposing the Early Bronze settlement at Horom, a 6 x 6 m. sounding was opened near the end of the season at the neigh- boring site of Anushavan, which is located to the east of Horom immediately north of the town of Artik. Characteristic Kura-Araxes ceramics, serrated flint sickles, and andiron/hearth fragments picked up during surface reconnaissance initially in summer 1990 had indicated that an Early Bronze settlement once occupied a few hectares on the southern slope of a natural hill south-east of the modern Anushavan village and a later small Hellenistic site. More surface Early Bronze remains were retrieved by walking over the site in 1993, including a double spiral-headed copper or bronze toggle pin. The sounding was placed on the second of its three terraces. The cultural deposit was very shallow and filled with loose rocks. Nevertheless, a two course wide stone wall ran north-south across the trench, and a stone cist burial (Feature 2), remi- niscent in form to the burial in E2, and containing the remains of an infant, had been placed immedi- ately east of this wall (Fig. 15); the burial could not be dated since only one Early Bronze sherd was found beneath the skeleton, and it was unclear whether it related to the burial or to the underlying Early Bronze cultural level. Given the shallowness of the deposit, Anushavan may not prove to be the appropriate site to obtain more extensive exposure of Early Bronze remains in the Horom region, though a future sounding in a different area of the site is no doubt warranted. THE SOUTH HILL EXCAVATIONS Two operations were conducted on the South Hill of the Horom settlement in 1993: 1) M7, which began as a 5 x 5 m. trench placed immediately northwest of the 1992 M1/6 "horizontal exposure" on the eastern summit of the South Hill (Badaljan et al. 1993: 4-6, fig. 3) and which was expanded sev- eral times to the north, south, and west as more architecture of this complex was uncovered, yield- ing by summer's end a total excavated area together with M1/6 of 26.5 m. (E/W) x 17 m. (N/S); and 2) M8, an 8 x 2.5 m. wide trench which was placed far- ther to the southwest near the bottom of the south- ern slope of the South Hill within what appeared to be a room in order to determine whether or not this occupation, which was beyond the fortification walls of the South Hill, was contemporaneous with the M1/7 complex on the summit or later in date. The M8 room was paved with flagstones, similar to those in the M1/7 area and in the D1 complex on the North Hill, but its walls were only preserved to a height of a single course; ceramics recovered from M8 were identical with those on the top of the South Hill, a circumstance which suggests that the occupations were, in fact, contemporaneous. Operation M1/7: The Architectural Complex on the Eastern Summit of the South Hill (Fig. 16) A large area of interconnected architecture (c. 26.5 m. x 17 m.) has been exposed on the east- ern summit of the South Hill (Fig. 16). This com- plex now appears to continue even farther to the west, possibly extending all the way to what appears to be the main entrance through the southern forti- fication walls of the South Hill. The extensive flag- stone flooring and lack of evidence for roofing uncovered during the 1992 M1 excavations implied that this complex may have been an open-air forum, and the presence of numerous hollowed-out</page><page sequence="17">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1993 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 17 1 7 2 8 3 ~t /k/ 4I AsI ,oo 10 11 -D. 0000 0%" Fig. 14.

The 1992 excavations uncovered four distinct areas within the part of the complex that was exposed; and at least two more related areas-connected to the area of the M1 excavations by a narrow corridor -were revealed in 1993. The cultural deposit on the South Hill is rela- tively shallow, rarely exceeding 1 m. in depth. Clearly only a single period of architecture is pre- served on the top of the South Hill, though four separate loci were distinguished while clearing to the flagstone and packed clay floor of the architec- ture: 1) a c. 30-5 cm. deep topsoil level containing generally elaborate "Early Iron" grey wares with handles, spouts, and burnished designs; 2) a rela- tively sterile deposit of loose homogeneous soil extending c. 30-70 cm. beneath the surface; 3) a culturally rich, dense mixture of clay, ash, and char- coal at a depth of c. 70-85 cm. directly above the flagstone floor; and 4) the flagstone and hard packed clay floor on which the walls and other fea- tures of the architectural complex were erected. This floor was occasionally cut through by pits which also seem to be associated with the architec- ture. Thus, even though it may prove possible to trace a development of the local grey wares from relatively undecorated to more elaborate forms on the South Hill, there is really evidence for only a single period of occupation. Two main walls were excavated in M7 during the 1993 season: a slightly curved eastern wall (Feature 1) which was 1 course thick and 4-5 courses high (max. height of 1.2 m.) (Pl. IIId); and a second wall (Feature 4) composed of large stones (up to 80 cm. wide) to its west, which was 2 courses wide but only 1 course high. It was initially thought that this more massive western wall might define the western limits of the entire interconnected complex, but a series of features, such as stone basins set directly into its western face, suggest that the complex continues still farther west beyond the limits of the 1993 exca- vations. Several features were found in the room defined by these two walls, including more pits and stone basins. One large basin, Feature 3 (P1. IIId), is particularly noteworthy. It was carved from a large triangular-shaped bedrock stone and has a diameter of c. 28 cm. Channels were cut into the bowl of the basin for drainage and a small lip or depressed spout also was carved into it presumably to facilitate the pouring of liquids. The channels drain into a large pit (Feature 5) set immediately to its west. A surprising number of finely-made bone artefacts (P1. IIIe) were recovered from this room, including two points which were found within a small rectan- gular installation (Feature 13-165 cm. N/S x 70 cm. E/W) of vertically set stones south of the large basin together with a cache of forty-five ankle (astragali) and fifty-six metatarsal bones of cattle (c. 80 per cent) and red deer (c. 20 per cent), some of which had been perforated. The purpose of this installa- tion is unclear, though the combination of features again suggests something other than simple domes- tic utilisation (the casting of lots, ritual divination, or the like?). Three additional basins were set into the western face of the large western wall (Feature 4) in association with a stone-lined hearth or area of burning (Feature 15).

Present evidence neither confirms nor negates the hypothesis that animals may have been ritually sacrificed in this complex. Several of the bone artefacts found in Feature 13 and within the room defined by Features 1 and 4 show no evidence of use, possibly suggesting that they were fashioned within the complex. A large, worked red deer antler found south of Feature 13 also supports this inter- pretation. The proximity of several basins with one another, such as the three set in the western face of Feature 4, makes it difficult to conceive that all functioned as receptacles for animal sacrifice. For these, a more prosaic, industrial function may ulti- mately seem more reasonable. The complex remains enigmatic, and only additional clearing, possibly of the entire summit, may elucidate it. Tombs East of the Horom Settlement Numerous walls and surface features are spread across several hundred hectares to the east and south of the two citadel hills which define the Horom settlement. Most noteworthy and unequivo- cally prehistoric are circular rings of stones or crom- lechs clustered in groups to the east and parti- cularly south of the settlement. Two of these "Early Iron" tombs (labelled T1 and T2) were excavated in 1992 (Badaljan et al. 1993: 8-12), and four struc- tures( T3-T6), thought to be tombs, were dug in 1993. For the purpose of defining chronological or social variety in the contents of these tombs, it was decided to sample structures from different clusters of tombs or different areas of the site. T4, which was defined by a circular ring of stones on the eastern ridge of the northern slope of the South Hill, proved to be natural and yielded no skeletal or material remains. T5, which appeared as a deliber- ately raised pile of stones and not a ringed circle, was located a few hundred meters to the northwest of T1 and T2. It was hoped that this structure might prove to be a kurgan, possibly earlier in date than the ubiquitous Iron Age cromlechs. Fragmentary human bones and potsherds were found in a pit beneath the pile of stones in T5, confirming indeed that it was a burial. These remains, however, were so sparse and badly disturbed-presumably in anti- quity, that they could not be dated. T3, a typically shaped cromlech defined by a ring of stones c. 6 m. in diameter, proved more informa- tive, though its central burial pit had also been robbed in antiquity. T3 was located in a cluster of recognisable cromlechs west of T1 and T2 (i.e., closer to the South Hill) on the eastern slope of a small natural ridge. A large red basalt capstone had been placed in the centre of the ring of the stones covering the central burial pit. After removing the surface vegetation and defining the ring of stones, two subsidiary rings of stones covered by smaller capstones to the east (Feature A) and south (Feature B) of the central burial pit became evi- dent; Tomb 1, excavated in 1992, also had such an auxiliary ring of stones to its southeast (Badaljan et al. 1993: fig. 7) where it marked the presence of an additional pit containing ceramic vessels. The cen- tral capstone was split, and upon excavation it was immediately apparent that the central pit had been robbed; a few disarticulated human bones emerged, including part of the skull near the western edge of the pit. Parts of three vessels were recovered from the central pit along with nearlyl00 small beads, made primarily of carnelian, frit, and shell. Feature A contained six vessels, three of which were whole, and Feature B the partial remains of two additional vessels. Typologically, the vessels were similar to those found in T1 and T2 and presumably date to the late second or early first millennium B.C.; i.e., to the "Early Iron", pre-Urartian period (Fig. 17: 1-5). T6 was defined by a an oval ring of stones (c. 4.9 m. N/S x c. 5.5 m. E/W) clustered together with other stone-ringed cromlechs to the west of T3 on the eastern slope of the last ridge of hills separat- ing this area of the Horom site from the South Hill. Three stones covered the central pit, two of which were removed. T6 was a cenotaph containing no skeletal remains but three vessels, two of which were complete (Fig. 17: 6-8), were recovered. The larger burnished dark grey complete vessel (Fig. 17:8) had a fragment of obsidian set in its base, a trait some- times found on Middle to Late Bronze vessels in Transcaucasia; morphologically this vessel and the second complete vessel from T6 seemed earlier than the vessels recovered from other tombs at Horom, suggesting that this cenotaph (and others on this ridge of hills?) possibly date to the mid to late second millennium B.C. Faunal Remains from Horom Faunal remains from Horom are numerous and extremely well-preserved. Nearly 6000 animal bones from the 1992 and 1993 seasons were identified by Dr. Saindor Bokonyi. Eight domestic (cattle, sheep, goat, pig, horse, ass, dog, and chicken) and sixteen wild (red deer, roe deer, aurochs, Asiatic moufflon sheep, bezoar goat, wild boar, onager, badger, gazelle, red fox, hyena, brown bear, wolf, two wild birds, and one type of fish) species were repre- sented in the Horom materials. 92.4 per cent of the identifiable remains were of domestic animals. The Shirak plain today is dominantly a cattle-breeding region, and this type of animal husbandry clearly</page><page sequence="21">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1993 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 21 characterised the Bronze and Iron Ages as well; cattle constituted c. 63 per cent of the identifiable domestic forms. Caprovines were far less frequent (c. 26.5 per cent), and these were followed, some- what surprisingly, by horse (6.7 per cent) and then pig (1.6 per cent). Red deer were by far the most numerous wild species, constituting at least 60 per cent of the hunted animals, followed by aurochs. The natural habitat for most of the wild animals is forest or forest-steppe. The large body and antler sizes of the red deer also suggest that these animals lived under favorable environmental conditions; specifically, in dense woods which probably grew throughout the plain at that time. It is noteworthy that the wild relatives of the domestic species whose origins go back to the Neolithic (namely, cattle, sheep, goat, pig, and dog) were indigenous to the region and still lived in the area during the Bronze and Iron Ages. Horse, however, would have to have been brought into highland Transcaucasia from elsewhere, most probably from the Eurasian steppes to the north, though it is not yet known when this momentous introduction first took place. As men- tioned above, domesticated horse bones from "unmixed" Early Bronze levels in operation C3b/5 have been submitted for C14 determination, and their analysis will, hopefully, demonstrate the early presence of horses in the area. Dr. B6k6nyi also observed that some of the cattle horn cores showed a circular impression near the base, such as could 1 2 3 6 5 _8 Fig. 17.

The Horom Digital Mapping Project In summer 1993 a mapping project was initiated which began to incorporate detailed architectural drawings of the excavated areas and the visible sur- face architecture into a digitised map of the site compiled through the use of the AutoCAD pro- gram. All the excavation units, including the exten- sive stepped fortifications uncovered in Operation A2/3 on the summit of the North Hill, were located on the base map and digitised as well. The aerial images will now be used to check and further refine the digitised model of the base map. We are now able to view the site and its architecture three dimensionally along several different, spatially sig- nificant scales of resolution. Work on this mapping project will continue in future seasons. APPENDIX A: ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN SOUTHERN GEORGIA 1993 By Barbara Isaac, Zaal Kikodze, Philip L. Kohl, Giorgi Mindiashvili, Alexander Ordzhonikidze, and Greg White PALAEOLITHIC INVESTIGATIONS Three weeks were spent studying Palaeolithic and Plio-Pleistocene deposits in the field and Palaeolithic materials in the Georgian State Museum in Tbilisi. Four Plio-Pleistocene localities were surveyed: the Tsalka Basin; the Lake Paravani Basin; the Paravani (Djavakheti) Plateau-Diliska Gorge; and the Persati Plateau. It was established that sediments and volcanic rocks along the Diliska Gorge and under the Paravani Plateau offer ideal contexts for Plio-Pleistocene archaeological surveys. Mulitple extrusive rocks provide excellent dating potentials, while minor pyroclastic deposits should enhance correlation of fluvial and lacustrine facies. Sedimentary environments include floodplain and lacustrine littoral settings that would have been suit- able for prehistoric occupations. Bone preservation is excellent, as may be that of plant macrofauna as well. Steep canyon and quarry exposures make exploration of these thick deposits feasible with minimal manual excavation of trenches. Abundant lithic artefacts were found on the Persati Plateau in and on fluvial-colluvial clays in this small elevated montane basin. Faunal materials probably are not preserved here, but this site appears to contain an important record of Acheulean technology, typology, and raw material transport. Geologically, areas with intact spatial pat- terning are quite possible. Trenching will be neces- sary to define the full character of the artefact assemblages and their geological context. Two caves were visited farther north in the area of Sachkere (Imeretia): Dzudzuana; and Ortvala. This area is strikingly similar to the Dordogne region of France and is characterised by extensive karstic activity within an uplifted Palaeozoic lime- stone plateau. Incision of the plateau has exposed numerous caves and rockshelters. The Dzudzuana cave had only c.10 per cent of its fill removed by previous excavations. Sufficient exposures revealed the presence of Neolithic/Early Bronze materials overlying that of the Upper Palaeolithic. Interestingly, and for reasons which need to be clarified through more extensive excavations, no Middle Palaeolithic layers have yet been found. The Ortvala rockshelter is filled by sediments remarkably similar to the eboulis rich deposits which typify the sediments from French rockshelters. These are highly calcareous loams rich in angular limestone debris derived from the walls and roof. Most of the iboulis is intercalated with zones of fine, dusty, and crumbly matrix-supported sediments containing some hearths and ashes. The so-called "transitional" industry situated between the Upper and Middle Palaeolithic layers may be particularly important. Although it has been suggested that there is an unconformity between these industrial complexes, no evidence (e.g., soil or weathering) of such a break was observed in the field. Further exploration of both these caves should be highly informative, as should continued investi- gations of the earlier Plio-Pleistocene deposits further to the south. Both the Georgian State University and the Georgian State Museum have extended invitations for such collaborative field investigations, and these have been gladly accepted. BRONZE AND IRON AGE INVESTIGATIONS Short field seasons were conducted on the Djavakheti Plateau, of southern Georgia in 1990 and 1991 (Kohl et al. 1992), a relatively level upland</page><page sequence="23">PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE 1993 EXCAVATIONS AT HOROM, ARMENIA 23 area stretching c. 40-50 km. west to east and 30-5 km. north to south. The border between Georgia and Armenia represents the watershed between the tributaries of the Araxes river flowing south into Armenia and the Kura and its tributaries, particularly the deeply downcutting Paravani river, flowing north into Georgia. While the Plateau slopes northeast to southwest, its average elevation (c. 1800 m.a.s.l.) is higher than that of the Shirak Plain, and its climate accordingly is more severe and suitable for the pasturing of sheep and goats than for cereal growing and the herding of cattle, the dominant practises today and apparently during later prehistoric times on the Shirak Plain. The Djavakheti Plateau is surrounded by high mountain ranges, the most notable of which is the metal- liferous Trialeti Range to its north. To date, the later prehistoric investigations in southern Georgia have concentrated on two sites: Satkhe, a site cover- ing at least 7 ha. on the eastern edge of the Plateau; and Amagleba,9 a site near its northern boundary immediately south of the Trialeti Range. Early Bronze Excavations at Satkhe The site is located on a small hill above the con- temporary village of Satkhe, c. 8 km. northeast of the regional center of Nino Tsminda (formerly Bogdanovka), near the confluence of the Paravani River and a small stream which runs through the village. The site was initially defined by a c. 4 m. thick wall formed by two rows of boulders (general- ly preserved to a height of only one course) separat- ed by rubble infill. This wall follows the natural con- tour of the hill, securing a c. 6 ha. horshoe-shaped concave depression that forms the hill's summit. Early Bronze sherds were collected from within this fortified area and to the south and west beneath the contemporary village. In 1991 a late Early Bronze vaulted stone kurgan, which had been plundered in antiquity, was excavated in a field immediately to the north of the fortification wall, but two small exploratory soundings within the fortified area revealed the presence of Hellenistic and Medieval occupations in addition to the dominant Early Bronze settlement: The 1993 excavations were directed towards: 1) determining the extent and preservation of Early Bronze remains both within the fortified area (Operation Al) and on a sloping terrace at the foot of the hill beneath the fortifi- cations to the southeast where a villager had un- covered a dense concentration of decorated Early Bronze pots and storage jars at the end of the 1991 season (Operation Bi); 2) dating the wall by digging against its inner face and sectioning it (Operations A2 and A3); and excavating what appeared to be another small kurgan located on the remains of an early agricultural terrace immedi- ately east of the fortified hill (Operation C1). This last excavation determined that this raised mound of stones had simply been collected by villagers in the course of agricultural work and was not a pre- historic kurgan that would help to date the exten- sive terracing east of the settlement. A 10 x 10 m. exposure (Al) was opened immedi- ately to the northeast of where a large Kura-Araxes vessel, set on a plastered surface,10 had been re- covered in 1991. Only Kura-Araxes materials were recovered from Al, although the cultural deposit which lay almost immediately beneath the surface was not well-preserved. Single courses of dry stone walls, delineating rectangular structures were revealed, and one such structure had been erected over an earlier structure, suggesting the presence of at least two distinct Early Bronze building phases in this area of the settlement. The black and brown burnished ceramics included a few incised decor- ated fragments, similar to those from Operations C1 anc C3b/5-E2 at Horom and other well-known Kura-Araxes sites, such as Shengavit, Mokhra Blur, and Kvatskhelebi, suggesting a date in the first half of the third millennium B.C. Unfortunately, the shallowness of the deposit and later cultural activi- ties in this area, including its contemporary cultiva- tion by villagers, meant that the Early Bronze remains here were badly disturbed and unlikely to yield additional significant information. Operations A2 and A3 were both small sound- ings set against and through the fortification wall for the purpose of determining the wall's date (Fig. 18). A2, which was located near the northeastern corner of the wall next to an internal feature or tower, contained a shallow Early Bronze deposit directly beneath the surface which continued par- tially underneath the wall, suggesting that at least in this part of the site an Early Bronze occupation pre- dated the construction of the wall. A3 sectioned a 1 m. wide cut through the wall at a place where excavations in 1991 had revealed a dense concen- tration of Early Bronze artefacts underlying Medieval constructions against its inner face. A few unidentifiable, presumably Medieval sherds were recovered from the rubble fill of this trench, and the wall itself rested on bedrock (i.e., the Early Bronze deposit did not continue here beneath the wall). Thus, the results of these operations were inconclusive. It is possible that the wall initially could have been constructed during Early Bronze times, but it is equally, if not more, likely that it dates to a much later period, an interpretation which leaves unexplained its primitive form and poor state of preservation.

Although found directly beneath the surface, these rooms had been covered by a deposit of wash eroding from the hill and were less disturbed than those from Al. The rooms had well-defined floors preserved to a depth of nearly 2 m. A large, nearly complete black-burnished cooking vessel or storage jar was found on the floor near the northwestern corner of Room D; behind this several Kura-Araxes vessels and deer antlers had been placed (P1. IlIf). This evidence and other Early Bronze materials recovered from this excavation suggests that the rooms of this complex had been left while still con- taining usable items and that the site may have been suddenly abandoned, a feature also suggested for other Kura-Araxes settlements, such as Karnut on the Shirak Plain. There was also evidence of a Mediaeval midden deposit above Room C to the east, and today this terraced area of Early Bronze structures is being encroached upon and further disturbed by the expansion of the village. Some of the faunal materials from Satkhe were analysed by Dr. B6k6nyi, and these suggested that the Early Bronze inhabitants of Djavakheti prac- ticed a different form of animal husbandry from that of their contemporaries to the south on the Shirak Plain. Specifically, ovicaprine remains slight- ly outnumbered those of cattle, implying a far greater reliance on sheep and goats on the higher Djavakheti Plateau. Horse bones (Equus caballus) also were recovered, as were remains of aurochs and red deer, although the wild animals were not as relatively numerous as at Horom, possibly suggest- ing that Djavakheti was not as densely wooded as Shirak. The Sounding at Amagleba The site of Amagleba sits on the northern edge of the Djavakheti plateau c. 25 km. north of Akhalkalaki, immediately to the southwest of Lake Tabatskuri, at the point where the Plateau first widens after descent from the Trialeti Range to the north. The latter contains rich metal deposits which are known to have been worked in late prehistoric times, and it is possible that Amagleba could have functioned as a transit station and/or production center for a trade in metals to the south. The site itself consists of a thin cultural deposit on the summit of a cone-shaped hill that rises c. 70 m. above the plain at a height of nearly 1900 m.a.s.1. and a thicker Bronze and Iron Age deposit with visi- ble walling and possible fortifications spreading out from the southern base of this hill. A 3 x 3.5 m sounding was opened next to some of the visible architecture at the hill's base at the end of the 1993 season (Fig. 20). This sounding un- covered the following stratigraphic sequence. The first 15 cm. were mixed, containing Medieval, Early Iron, and Early Bronze materials, and this mixture continued for another 55 cm., containing the foun- dation for a wall of undetermined Iron Age or Medieval date. Below this, a white surface was exposed containing Early Iron materials followed by several levels of undisturbed Early Bronze Kura- Araxes deposit until bedrock was reached at 2.1 m. beneath the surface. The bottom of an Early Bronze stone wall was encountered at a depth of 1.3 m. and two additional Kura-Araxes living surfaces were exposed at 1.6 and 1.8 m. respectively. The Early Bronze materials included brown and black burnished wares, two of which were decorated with spiral volutes and incised triangles, a portable hearth or andiron fragments, a tanged brown obsidian arrowhead, and characteristic serrated red chert blades. A large and nearly 10 cm. long tanged stone spearhead was collected from the site's sur- face. Ceramic parallels again can be made to Mokhra Blur and Kvatskhelebi, as well as to the neighboring Early Bronze site of Amiranis Gora near Akhaltsikhe to the west. Faunal remains from the sounding were well-preserved. The single limited sounding at Amagleba essen- tially confirms what could be reconstructed from the site's surface materials and reflects the basic known settlement pattern documented in highland Transcaucasia: a relatively thick and presumably long-lived Early Bronze occupation followed by a period of uncertain abandonment, beginning prob- ably in the late third or early second millennium B.C., and then a reoccupation in the Late Bronze or Early Iron periods towards the end of the second millennium. The results suggest that the preserva- tion of Early Bronze materials from Amagleba may be better than at Satkhe and Anushavan and much easier to recover than at Horom. On the basis of its location, the upper "Early Iron" levels at Amagleba may ultimately prove important for documenting a late second/early first millennium B.C. metals trade to the south when metallurgy in the Caucasus was experiencing a spectacular period of florescence and included the mass production of "Colchidean" (or "Koban") tin-bronze tools and weapons (Chernykh 1992: 275-95). Additional, more exten- sive excavations at Amagleba are clearly warranted and are indeed planned for the future. CONCLUSION Limited investigations are scheduled for 1994. Already excavated materials from Horom will be studied and prepared for publication, possibly in conjunction with minor work on the site, involving</page><page sequence="27">z 0 H z H z H 0 Z z A \ 4 B VI TOPSOIL V IV - IV- A STERILE SOIL LIGHT BROWN I - EB-A FLOOR II- EB-A FLOOR M PACKED LIGHT BROWN III- CULTURAL BREAK FTTFF BRWNIV- BAND OF SOFT ORANGE-BROWN SOIL V- BAND OF WHITE SOIL, POSSIBLE BREAK BETWEEN EB-A AND LB- A I PACKED BROWN VI-END OF CULTURAL DEPOSIT PACKED REDDISH BROWN V + SOFT CHALKY BROWN TRACES OF CARBON 0 1 2M Fig. 20.

'Participants in the 1993 field season at Horom on the American side included the following students: Laura Tedesco from New York University; Kim Codella, Eleanor Barbanes, Sanjyot Mehendale, and Nahrain Daniel from the University of California, Berkeley; Adam Smith, Amy Tucker, and Doug Gann from the University of Arizona, Tucson; Armine Ishkanian from the University of California, San Diego; Greg White from Cambridge University in England; and Bevin Etheridge from Wellesley College. Mr. Gann, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Codella were also responsible for the digital mapping project described in this report. Dr. Karen Rubinson, Research Associate of the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania directed the 1993 excavations of the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age cemetery at Horom. Dr. Sdindor B6konyi, Director of the Institute of Archaeology in Budapest, Hungary, analysed the faunal remains, and Christopher Rasmussen from Berkeley, California was the excavation photographer. The help of all the above is gratefully acknowledged. Ms. Eleanor Barbanes was responsible for drafting the architectural plans and assembling all the line drawings for this article; her invaluable assistance must be espe- cially mentioned. The original ceramic drawings were prepared in the field by Ms. Anna Dokhikjan. The Armenian participants included the following archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology in Yerevan: Simone Hamayakjan, Sergei Mandrikjan, and Mrktich Zardarjan. We also wish to acknowl- edge the invaluable support of the Institute's Director, Dr. Aram Kalantarjan. The 1993 season could not have been conducted without the logistical and organisational assistance rendered by Vladmir Kostandjan and Ruben Tonikjan of the Shirak Foundation. Both the Institute of Archaeology in Yerevan and the private Shirak Foundation supported the excavations at Horom. The American work was sponsored by a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (RO-22523- 92), and additional support was received from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research and the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in New York and from the Centre for Field Research (Earthwatch) and the Azadoutioun Foundation (Carolyn G. Mugar) in the Boston area. Support also was received from the Stahl Fund of the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Arizona, and Wellesley College. 2 Barbara Isaac, Assistant Director, Peabody Museum, Harvard University was supported by a grant from the Mary Leakey Foundation to continue her Palaeolithic investigations in south- ern Georgia in collaboration with Dr. Zaal Kikodze of the Georgian State University in Tbilisi. In addition to Ms. Isaac, Prof. O. Bar-Yosef, Dept. of Anthropology, Harvard University, Dr. Paul Goldberg, Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, Prof. Reid Ferring, University of North Texas, and Dr. Anna Belfer Cohen, Dept. of Archaeology, Hebrew University, Israel visited Palaeolithic sites and studied the Pleistocene geology of southern Georgia. Dr. Bejan Tutberidze of the Georgian State University, Dr. Mehrab Tvalcrelidze, Institute of Geology, and Dr. Tengis Mechvelia, Georgian State Museum also took part in these Palaeolithic investigations. Future Palaeolithic work in Georgia will be supported both by the Georgian State University and the Georgian State Museum. Mr. Greg White, Ms. Nahrein Daniel, and Ms. Bevin Etheridge participated in the later prehis- toric IPARC excavations at the sites of Satkhe and Amagleba. This latter work was also sponsored by the Georgian State University and by the Centre for Archaeological Investigations of the Georgian Academy of Sciences in Tbilisi. Drs. (;iorgi Mindiashvili and A. Ordzhonikidze from the Centre led a Georgian team of students from the State University to excavate Satkhe and Amagleba, and Mr. Levan Kalandarishvili was the architect/draftsperson for these excavations. :'The Air Force of the Republic of Armenia kindly allowed us to fly in one of their helicopters around the North and South Hills of the Horom settlement. Indeed this same area may have also begun to provide evidence for an Intermediate Phase of construction. In this context it is still necessary to continue our excavation of a particular wall, Wall 8, which is not yet definitely associated with either the first, or the last, phase of local construction. 'The extent to which walls other than ground floor walls were also made of stone is not, of course, known. To judge from B1 North- West Gate area, the B Fortification Wall's four m. high stone socle was capped by mud-brick (Badaljan et al. 1993: pl. IIb). " Note, however, that the 'jog" in the north face of Wall 4 begins at a point that is 2.70 m., not 3.70 m. (for which see Badaljan et al. 1993: fig. 13), from the inner face of the B Fortification Wall. 7 Cf. C. F. A.
