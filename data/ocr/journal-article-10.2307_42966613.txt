<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of Gods and Men The Machinery , Madam, is a Term invented by the Criticks, to signify that Part which Deities, Angels, or Daemons, are made to act in a Poem: For the ancient Poets are in one respect like many modern Ladies; Let an action be never so trivial in it self, they always make it appear of the utmost Importance. ( Epistle ) Pope makes this remark in the attempt to explain to Arabella Fermor why The Rape of the Lock is reappearing in 1714, augmented by sylphs and gnomes playing roles equivalent to those of the gods in classical epic. He is evidently conscious of offering hard words to pretty ears, but the point is one he is anxious to bring home, for the perfection of his joke depends on it. Once the action of the poem - 'be [it] never so trivial in it self - is shown to be the concern of supernatural agents, everything about it appears 'of the utmost Importance'. It is not Arabella-Belinda herself who creates that importance, still less the action, but the presence of another order of beings which concerns itself with both. If Pope phrases his explanation here with arch effrontery, it is perhaps because he wishes to conceal the seriousness of his ambitions. He had painstakingly revised the short poem of 1712, and inserted the new Machinery so skilfully that he later said it gave 'one of the greatest proofs of judgement of anything [he] ever did' (Spence, Anecdotes , I 45). He was consciously rejecting Addison's advice to leave the poem as it was, merum sal , and the careful lightness of his tone is the air he normally assumes when at his most artistically serious. How then should we understand this suppressed enthusiasm for Machinery - a term, after all, as old as Aristotle,1 and which neo-classic criticism had made familiar as a necessary element in epic and mock-epic long before? It was the first recourse of every poet when his learned sock was on, from Blackmore involving Satan and his fiends in the sailing of the Armada {Eliza, 1705) to Addison, causing angels to descend on a cloud in Rosamond (1707). It is a speculation worth entertaining that Pope writes as a convert, having rediscovered the power of Machinery by making it work in his own poem. He has turned Homer's Olympians into miniscule sylphs and gnomes, he has given them the spiritual natures of coquettes and prudes, and London society for their sphere 1 It derives, of course, from the use of theatrical machinery (ļXTļxavf|) [mehanē] to suspend gods over the stage.</page><page sequence="2">2 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY of action; but even miniaturised and put to satirical purposes, the Machinery still works. By some trick of the imagination, the poem is as serious as it is light, and the 'Action' appears, just as the theory says it should, 'of the utmost Importance'. The poem revitalises what had become a neo-classic cliche, and if we consider it curiously enough it may restore our sense of wonder too: for how does something as mechanical-sounding as Machinery produce such delightful effects? What is seducing the imagination, and what is the imagination made of, that it can be so seduced? Perhaps we should look at Pope's own explanation for clues, for as so often, his lucidity reveals unexpected depths. The ancient poets, he says, always make an action appear of the utmost importance: that is, we are dealing with a question of technique, a means for what elsewhere Pope calls 'raising the Action'. The 'Action' - the plot and events - of classical epic were not felt to have innate grandeur, even by their authors; it was the representation of them, the way they were made to appear , that gave them importance. Magnificent language and the Machinery of gods were the epic poet's great resources; only these made the difference between the Trojan War for Helen, and a wasteful tug-of-war over a pretty woman, between the homecoming of Odysseus whom Athene loved, and a clever Greek on a raft. Contrary to normal logic, it is appearances which are essential in poetry, and it is only the words that count. In this respect, Homer was doing the same thing as Pope did in his mock- epic when he used Machinery to 'raise the Action.' He was assuming that the importance of his subject did not appear until he dramatised it; that mere assertion was not enough. Pope's management of Belinda can help us understand the implications of this, for he conveys the scale and significance of her beauty without asserting, or even describing it. He does not tell us, 'Belinda is a beauty', and still less does he descend to details of eyes, nose and chin. He approaches the subject obliquely, as the imagination loves. 'Belinda is so beautiful that exquisite and ethereal sylphs make her their anxious care, and fifty hang on her petticoat alone; not even her fan or the curls on her neck go unattended . . .' By the time we have heard the full roster of her guardian spirits, Belinda is not a silly girl whose one asset is her beauty, but another Helen. We do not simply grant her beauty, but a heroic scale of importance; we are persuaded that only the highest- ranking sylph is fit to guard her precious lapdog, and that everything about her is of unimpeachable value. Machinery, we may deduce from this, helps the imagination overcome its inertia and its natural tendency to balk when too much is demanded of it at short notice. The statement 'Belinda is the loveliest girl in Britain' is comparatively discouraging. What is</page><page sequence="3">OF GODS AND MEN 3 needed is the dramatisation of her beauty, which the sylphs provide: like a magnifying device in school geometry which traces a shape at one point and enlarges it at another, they enable the imagination to enlarge its conception, and give it colour, detail and life. But if Machinery can do so much, we may go on to wonder, why is it that it so rarely succeeds? For literary history records numberless examples of its use from which, in Johnson's phrase, 'the attention naturally retires'; poems in which its application is as mechanical as its name suggests, compounded to Pope's own 'Receit to make an Epick Poem': For the Machines Take of Deities, Male and Female, as many as you can use. Separate them into two equal parts, and keep Jupiter in the middle. The Guardian (1714), no. 78 On the evidence of the poetry itself, it is clearly easier to possess the theory than to make it work. Pope's sylphs are more delightful than the Christian variant of Machinery, the angels, of Addison or Milton; they are more delightful even than the Machinery of Pope's next mock-epic, the goddess Dulness. If Machines turn all too easily to mechanism, what does it take to bring them alive? What is the secret of The Rape of the Lock , that Pope uncovered to magic effect? Since both the theory and practice derive from Greek literature, perhaps we can pursue the question best by looking back. We can find in Homer the supreme proof of the value of Machinery to the imagination; and what promises well for a general enquiry of this kind is that his practice is not uniform, so that by examining it carefully in different places we may uncover what it is that turns mechanism into magic. Greek literature also offers us a stark example of the theory gone moribund, in Lucian; for pagan Machinery has died and been resuscitated more than once. If we take these two extremes of the theory, what do we find? Lucian's satires on the gods may make the simpler starting point, for he is clearly working Homer's magic in reverse - using literary means to kill the gods off, rather than bring them to life. It is not difficult to do: Lucian allows us to hear them talking in private, where it emerges that they speak slangy Greek, and fret about the spread of atheism they can do nothing to prevent. Lucian's best joke is that they can, in fact, do nothing at all; as acknowledged since Homer, the gods are subject to moira , fate, and as circumscribed in their power as the men who worship them. Poseidon's response to the growth of scepticism is mere bluster: 'We'll show them how we deal with blasphemers!' Zeus replies,</page><page sequence="4">4 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY You're kidding, Poseidon. Have you quite forgotten how power- less we are to do any such thing? It's the Fates with their spinning who consign one man to death by thunderbolt, another to the sword, and another to fever or consumption. If it were up to me, do you suppose I'd have let the temple-robbers get away from Olympia the other day without a blast from my thunderbolt, when they'd shorn off two of my curls weighing six pounds each? Or would you have let that fisherman from Oreus pinch your trident at Geraestus? (Zeus Tragoidos , 25) This is all it takes to destroy the magic, for if the gods speak slang instead of resounding poetry, and acknowledge their powerlessness from their own mouths, they are not gods. In poetry, as we noted before, what is superficial is essential, and an epic poet is engaged in making his subject appear of the utmost importance. If the satirist uses language which precludes the possibility, the subject dis- appears along with it. But what is surprising about this example, this spell worked in reverse, is that it has so much in common with the original it satirises. Homer's gods have their slangy style too, it is only that they mingle it with formidable authority; and Homer's gods are subject to moira , it is only that they do not respond as if this made them powerless. It is not in the facts themselves, but in the presentation of them, that Homer differs from Lucian, as we can see from the classic moment in the Iliad when Zeus bows to fate, and accepts that his mortal son Sarpedon must die at Troy. Homer represents him as struggling in his own mind with the impulse to save him, and dissuaded by Hera. Here it is in Pope's plangent version: The Hour draws on; the Destinies ordain, My Godlike Son shall press the Phrygian Plain: Already on the Verge of Death he stands, His Life is ow'd to fierce Patroclus ' Hands. What Passions in a Parent's Breast debate! Say, shall I snatch him from impending Fate, And send him safe to Lycia , distant far From all the Dangers and the Toils of War; Or to his Doom my bravest Offspring yield, And fatten, with celestial Blood, the Field? Then thus the Goddess with the radiant Eyes: What Words are these, O Sov'reign of the Skies? Short is the Date prescrib'd to mortal Man; ' Shall Jove , for one, extend the narrow Span, &gt; Whose Bounds were fix'd before his Race began? * How many Sons of Gods, foredoom'd to Death,</page><page sequence="5">OF GODS AND MEN 5 Before proud Ilion, must resign their Breath! Were thine exempt, Debate would rise above, And Murm'ring Pow'rs condemn their partial Jove. Give the bold Chief a glorious Fate in fight; And when th'ascending Soul has wing'd her flight, Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy Command, The breathless Body to his native Land. His Friends and People, to his future Praise, A marble Tomb and Pyramid shall raise, And lasting Honours to his Ashes give; His Fame ('tis all the Dead can have!) shall live. She said; the Cloud-compeller overcome, Assents to Fate, and ratifies the Doom. Then, touch'd with Grief, the weeping Heav'ns distill'd A Show'r of Blood o'er all the fatal Field. The God, his Eyes averting from the Plain, ' Laments his Son, predestin'd to be slain, &gt; Far from the Lycian Shores, his happy native Reign. J (16.530-63) What has Homer done with Lucian's facts to make them look so different? Although Zeus does not override moira here any more than in the satire, he speaks as though he can, as makes Sarpedon's death an open question: 'Say, shall I snatch him from impending Fate?' If the question is ultimately answered in the negative, it is not because he concedes his powerlessness; it takes Hera's intervention to sway his mind, nor does she snub him on the score of moira? s supremacy, but on the grounds of the incalculable effect his intervention would have. If Zeus saved his mortal son, all the other gods would be wanting to save theirs, and mortality would soon cease to be mortal: Short is the Date prescrib'd to mortal Man; Shall Jove , for one, extend the narrow Span, Whose Bounds were flx'd before his Race began? When Zeus then gives way, he leaves us with the impression of ratifying the natural order of things, rather than being arrested by the limits of his power. The emphasis falls on our human limits instead, embodied most poignantly in the shortness of life; and when Zeus sends a shower of bloody drops onto the battlefield, the gesture is not felt as token (as Lucian might have represented it) but as a silent tribute from immortality to mortality. Just like Lucian, Homer is according Zeus characteristic human weaknesses: human fathers would break the rules to protect their children, human fathers weep; but Zeus expresses himself as we could never do, in a shower of blood, and blesses Sarpedon's death with a miracle, by transporting his body back to his native land for burial.</page><page sequence="6">6 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY These two versions of Zeus, in one of which he appears so banal and helpless, and in the other, so grand and resigned, confirm the emphasis Pope laid on appearances. Lucian exposes the fact that the magic of deity has a mechanistic basis, that it is all a question of illusion; and he does it with a serious purpose, of course, for he wrote in an age when (as in our own Renaissance, when he was read with passion) the humanist thought man would find the true scale of his importance by emancipating himself from outworn stories. Lucian drags the question of the gods' humanity and their subservience to moira into the light of rationalist day, and makes them prove what they had never proved before,, that gods cannot help man feel the scale of his importance. It is not by seeing himself as the concern of such deities that man will know his greatness, but by seeing how fully he has outgrown them; his strength lies in the independence which pushes away such props to the imagination, and the true usefulness of Machinery to Lucian arrives at the moment it is set aside. But an obvious defect of this, which we may call the Götterdämmerung method, is that it depends for its éclat on what has gone' before. It is the kicking over of a sandcastle someone else has built, and it cannot be repeated with the same effect. Most readers would testify that reading Lucian at length is not exhilarating, but peculiarly depressing, rather like visiting museums of atheism in Communist countries. Some important point has been missed, we feel, something Homer perfectly understood; yet since Homer and Lucian are agreed on the essential facts, it is difficult to say in what it consists, unless it be that the satires return us all too obviously to the original problem. If epic Machinery was invented to make everything 'appear of the utmost Importance', and gods exist to help man enlarge his imaginative conception, to destroy them merely leaves us where we began, searching for a way of expressing our seriousness. There is also the possibility that Lucian's satire destroys more than he intended: for to explode the gods by making them comic and impotent versions of humanity is a dangerous ruse. If humanity is merely laughable in them, it follows that it is also laughable in man. None the less, reading Lucian helps us perceive what in reading Homer we might easily overlook, that Machinery in epic works its magic on very paradoxical terms. In the Sarpedon episode above, Zeus is perfectly assured of his power, but he declines to use it; he loves his son like a true father, but he does not save his life. He looks like a man, talks and thinks like one; but, says Homer, he is a god, for he performs miracles (which make no difference to the out- come of the story) and, above all, he is immortal. He is on the other side of a great divide, from which he views mankind with the</page><page sequence="7">OF GODS AND MEN 7 purest pity. Homer's text, we may say, is a kind of palimpsest, whose bottommost layer is exposed by Lucian. The gods have no power to intervene in destiny; the gods think and feel like men. But written over this is another story, by which Zeus performs miracles, and differs from humanity in one respect which makes all resemblances insignificant - the fact of his immortality. Perhaps this is one of the secrets by which Homer's Machinery makes Sarpedon's death appear 'of the utmost Importance', for if there is such an absolute distinction between a god and a man, any bond acknowledged between them sheds grace and dignity on both. Zeus's love for the son he cannot save is being freely given across a gulf that might have precluded his feeling anything at all; and he pays in blood, as it were, for a connection voluntarily acknowledged. The effect is to shed strong light both on Sarpedon's worthiness, as a human being whom the greatest of the gods could love, and on the condition of mortality itself, which is so dreadful a thing that the immortals weep at it. Zeus is the Machine by which the imagination can grasp what humanity is from the outside, like the iroi or&lt;S of Archimedes, the place where a lever could get a purchase on the world. When the imagination posits an immortal god it can conceive of mortality; and the greatness of Zeus enables the imagination to conceive of the costlier greatness of a hero who, in spite of his mortality, is ready to fight Patroclus on the battlefield. It seems from this that Machinery is an embodied paradox the poet does not intend us to examine. If we look at it rationally, like Lucian, it immediately stops working; but if we view it imagina- tively, as meant, it has no fault, for both aspects of the paradox serve an imaginative purpose. When the poet tells us that gods and men are alike, he helps our imaginations conceive of ourselves on the grandest scale; and when he says in the same breath that we have nothing in common worth mentioning, for gods are immortal, he helps us take all our actions more seriously, for human actions are taken under sentence of death. This may explain why Homer does not bother to make his gods better than his human beings, for the paradox works best if gods resemble men as much as possible. Hence he tells us as many damaging things about them as Lucian: they are bullying, pleasureseeking, forgetful and partisan. But he holds these facts in balance with another, their immortality, which condemns them to an eternity of frivolousness in which no one thing can matter more than another, and this releases our sense of what it is to be human by contrast. We are like gods, the story tells us - but we are more serious.2 2 See also H. A. Mason's invaluable To Homer Through Pope (Chatto, 1972), p. 40.</page><page sequence="8">8 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY The other paradoxical assertion uncovered by Lucian is that the gods are all - powerful, and that they do nothing, just as Zeus toys with the thought of saving Sarpedon and does not do it. As with the first paradox, this seems to answer two imaginative purposes. The idea of omnipotence gives us a scale on which to register the wonder of human powers when they outgo the norm. A hero who fights longer, or more bravely than is 'humanly' possible, is (says the story) 'superhumanly' aided: there is a god in his breast, or fighting at his side. At the same time, the god does nothing that is not within human limits, for that would turn hyperbole into miracle, which Homer scrupulously avoids. Zeus must not save Sarpedon by breaking the rules which apply to humanity. That, as Hera reminds him, would ruin the paradox, for mortality would share the immortals' prerogative; Zeus must confine his miracles to tangential matters, like the burying of Sarpedon's body. And Hera's judgment is evidently the poet's, for if the great aim of epic is to praise man, and represent his actions as 'of the utmost Importance', nothing is gained by representing him as other than human. If he triumphs, it must be within human limits; the heroic lies only in the realms of the possible. It seems that Machinery requires to be held under tension to operate, the tension generated by paradoxical assertions. It works by conveying to us that gods and men are profoundly alike, and wholly dissimilar, and that gods are divine in their power, and that men are. Viewed thus simply, we can say that it is really the open secret of anthropomorphism Homer is exploiting, for as the French philosopher Alain expresses it in his classic meditation on Olympianism, The gods are moments of man. This is not an abstract thought, it is written into the battles of the Iliad and the wanderings of Ulysses. Besides, once the gods have taken human form, how shall we recognize them if not by grace of movement, a force, a glance, a word of advice, all the eminent signs of man? Or else in sudden impulses of hope, audacity, fear?3 The openness of the secret appears most clearly in sculpture, where galleries of statues are labelled indifferently 'youth' or 'Apollo', 'female figure' or 'Aphrodite'. How should we know which is which when the one serves us for the conception of the other? In an anthropomorphic religion, what we know about the gods is what we know of ourselves: they are a covert mode of expressing our own divinity. But the stress goes on 'covert', and Homer is at least as concerned to bury the secret as to expose it to view; hence his 3 Alain, The Gods , trans. Pevear (Chatto, 1975), p. 125. This is an illuminating collection of short essays on all forms of divinity.</page><page sequence="9">OF GODS AND MEN 9 emphasis on the 'otherness' of gods, on the unbridgeable gulf that separates them from humanity. To speak the secret aloud, that men are divine, would be comparatively bathetic. Directness cannot touch the imagination to fine issues, and in any case, it is an irresistible invitation to contradict, for we know how much of our nature this view omits. It is at least as true that we are not divine as that we are, and experience shows that we are usually on the brink of losing our divinity when we feel most assured of it. Spiritual tact and the need to approach the imagination obliquely both require that the open secret be buried from sight; and so Homer tells us repeatedly how the gods differ from us in their power and immortality, and an established sense of difference carries us through the poems admiring the intelligence, beauty and strength lent by the gods to the heroes, without recalling who it was that first lent them to the gods. This idea that the Machinery of gods magnifies human nature best when it is held under tension receives some confirmation from the variations within Homer's own practice, for he does not always hold the paradoxes as taut as in the relationship of Zeus and Sarpedon. In the Odyssey especially he seems to enjoy a sense of complicity with the reader: the open secret is constantly rising into view, and being buried again with nonchalant irony. The Machinery is magic still, but magic with a hint of mechanism, as we can see for instance if we compare the Athene of the Odyssey with the Athene of 'hzlliad. In the Iliad she appears as abrupt, militant and devious, capable of tricking Hector to his death or subverting the authority of Zeus. While she has her favourites on earth, she gives the impression of having a busy life to lead elsewhere, and of mingling in human concerns from an infinite distance. She epitomises the 'otherness' of gods, and the sudden flashing of her greygreen eyes inspires as much awe as comfort. But in the Odyssey , by contrast, she is a goddess of considerable charm. Her relationship with the hero is affectionate, from the moment she pleads his case for going home with Zeus, and for the length of the poem she takes his fate in hand, visiting him and Telemachus repeatedly, and helping out at the slaughter of the suitors. Her flights and epiphanies begin to create the impression of a goddess bustling about human concerns, and loosen the tautness of the paradoxes we have been examining; for the intervention of a goddess in human affairs is more impressive if we believe she has other, more important things to do, and her affection for a mortal is flattering in proportion to her capacity for indifference. The charm and the attendant risks of sailing thus close to the wind emerge strongly from one of the climaxes of the Odyssey , the moment when a Phaeacian ship has deposited the hero on his native shore (13.187ff.) Athene approaches him as a local shepherd boy,</page><page sequence="10">10 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY handsome as a prince, and their interchange is worth examining, for the secret we have been looking at is wearing the lightest disguise at this point. Athene knows what Odysseus himself is unaware of, that he is home at last, and she is in the mood to tease him and take advantage of his ignorance. When he naturally enquires the name of the island she has shrouded in fog, she scoffs at the thought of anybody's not recognising it, and enumerates all its famous qualities, reserving its name for the very end of her speech. Even at Troy, she adds slyly, people have heard of Ithaca; whereupon Odysseus swallows his delight and, tirelessly circumspect, im- provises an elaborate tale to prove himself a fugitive from Crete, not Troy, passing through on the way to Pylos. He calls his escorts Phoenicians rather than Phaeacians, explains away the magnificent gifts they have left with him, and is resting with some comfort in the totality of this alibi, when Athene drops her shepherd's disguise and gives him a smile and a caress. This luxuriance of guile is altogether after her own heart - she is as famous for it in Heaven as he is on earth - but there is no point in two such experts playing games. She is Pallas Athene, who is always beside him keeping him safe, and now she has important advice to give him about his conduct at the palace among the suitors. Odysseus is not so fully reassured here as to forget the mortals' experience of gods is less straightforward than she implies, and observes that, kind as she was to him in the old days at Troy, she was conspicuously absent till she acted as his guide on Phaeacia (Book 7). Besides, he still does not recognise Ithaca, and gods being what they are, she may be playing with him yet. Athene now acknowledges him a maestro , to be applying his sceptical intelligence at a time when another man would be rushing home to his wife. It is this that binds her to him so closely in his troubles. If she has seemed careless of him at times, it only shows what confidence she had in his own abilities; besides, she did not feel she could cross Poseidon after the affair with his son, the Cyclops. She proves her trustworthiness to Odysseus by dispelling the fog, Odysseus kisses the soil he has struggled so many years to return to, and the goddess and the hero sit down under an olive tree in perfect amity to lay plans for the death of Penelope's suitors. If we scrutinise this colloquy we can see it is another of Homer's palimpsests. Written beneath the story Athene tells of a busy goddess always protecting her favourite is another tale, of a goddess who does not affect the plot in any significant way and does nothing for the hero he could not do himself. Odysseus hints at this in her long absence between the end of the Trojan war and his arrival in Phaeacia: it is when he is already bound for home that she appears, and what she does then is not very miraculous. She helps make him welcome among the Phaeacians, or as now, advises him how to</page><page sequence="11">OF GODS AND MEN 1 1 conduct himself in Ithaca; things he could well perform for himself, with his ready tongue and excellent brain. But the effect of her presence makes it difficult to notice any of this, for the uppermost of the two stories is beguiling: it shows a hero so resilient and clever that a goddess flies to welcome him home and, when he greets her with elaborate falsehoods, acknowledges him freely as her equal in fraud. Odysseus in this version is the hero whom a goddess loves and cannot abandon, and Athene is the Machine who is successfully making everything appear 'of the utmost Importance'. We would not exchange it for the prosy statement written underneath: 'Odysseus, arriving in Ithaca, consulted his intelligence on how to proceed.' Yet it is noticeable too that the strict distinction between gods and men in the Iliad is slackening off here, and the open secret of anthropomorphism is rising into view. When Athene confesses herself bound to Odysseus precisely because of his sceptical intelligence, she is inviting us to conclude that it and she are the same thing, as in Pope's translation she more or less admits: How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise!... The more shall Pallas aid thy just desires, And guard the wisdom which her self inspires. (13.375, 378-9) When she says that she is as famous for guile among the gods as he is among men, the open comparison is a vast compliment that brings us to the edge of bathos, for it invites us to glimpse the Machinery in action, supplying divine magnification for human qualities. But perhaps it is in her smile and caress that Athene gives most away, for she is annihilating the distance between gods and men, and the idea implied in the distance that gods are essentially other than ourselves. The militant Athene of the Iliad once thumped Aphrodite on the breast, and jeered at her for having human favourites (Book 5). Here she behaves as if she were inspired by Aphrodite herself, and brings her goddess nature to the brink of humanity. The warm mutuality Homer ascribes to his goddess and hero here is appropriate enough to an epic which celebrates reciprocity between Heaven and earth; in which men get their just deserts, and gods help them do it. The Odyssey takes place in an intelligible universe, where even the elements of magic and fantasy make human sense (as, that it does not pay to throw stones at a Cyclops); and if we catch a shift in tone in Homer's treatment of the Olympians, it is perhaps only another way of saying that the world of the Odyssey itself is another shape: a shape that mirrors human understanding much more closely than in the Iliad. But if we are looking for gods to supply us with a sense of scale and make us feel</page><page sequence="12">12 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY 'of the utmost Importance', we may be justified in feeling some disappointment at a goddess who resembles her hero too closely, in whom the paradox of the 'sameness in différence' has not been held quite taut. Though it reflects great credit on a mortal to have a goddess for a friend, what kind of a goddess (asks the devil within) would be friends with a mortal? If she shares too clearly in human nature she only falls prey to our suspicions about ourselves, to our knowledge that we are not altogether divine. It is a little as if Dante's Beatrice had lowered herself to meeting him in the Inferno , and had comfortably assured him his sins were not scarlet, and she expected to see him finish his journey with credit: the tonic power of the Divina Commedia could not survive such an encounter, for it is precisely the distance maintained between her soul and his that 'raises the Action' of Dante's spiritual odyssey. There is an episode in the Iliad somewhat analogous to this exchange between Athene and Odysseus which may confirm the idea that the effect of Machinery is proportionate to its underlying tension. It is the nocturnal meeting of Priam and Hermes at the end of the poem, when the old king is crossing the Trojan plain with ransom for Hector's body. As in the Odyssey episode, Hermes is showing favour to a worthy mortal in disguise, and he reveals himself and offers good advice before he departs; but the effect of the episode is noticeably different, at once more exquisite and more severe. It doubtless owes much of its power to what has gone before, the accumulated losses and horrors of the war; Hermes comes to Priam in the subsequent calm, which Pope describes eloquently in a note to his translation: The Reader seems landed upon the Shore after a violent Storm; and has Leisure to survey the Consequences of the Tempest, and the Wreck occasion'd by the former Commotions, Troy weeping for Hector , and Greece for Patroclus. Our Passions have been in an Agitation since the opening of the Poem; wherefore the Poet, like some great Master in Music, softens his Notes, and melts his Readers into Tenderness and Pity. (Book 23, opening note.) Homer 'softens his Notes' firstly by burying Patroclus in state, and then by putting in train the burial of Hector, whose body Achilles has refused to yield up. Zeus sends Iris to Thetis with instructions for Achilles, Thetis visits her son, Iris prepares Priam and Priam sets off for the enemy camp by night, with one old retainer to keep him company and a wagonload of treasure to pay in ransom. He is strong in his sense of Zeus's protection and has no ears for the wailing friends and relatives left behind; seeing the old king drive off so trustingly, 'Zeus pitied him', says Homer simply (24.322), and</page><page sequence="13">OF GODS AND MEN 13 instructs Hermes to act as his guide, since he is the god who enjoys keeping humans company most. Hermes quickly binds on his golden sandals, seizes his sleep-shedding wand, and flies down to the plain where Priam and his retainer are watering their horses at the river (24.349). The appearance he takes on for them is the epitome of Greek charm, a graceful princeling on the point of getting a beard, but even so he cannot spare them some moments of anguish at meeting an enemy Myrmidon in the dark, for even benign miracles can be a source of pain to mortals. Seeing Priam breathless, his hair standing on end, Hermes takes him kindly by the hand, and asks him with unambiguously good intentions where he is going. He is not the man to harm one who is defenceless and, as he politely phrases it, 'not young'; and he would undertake to defend him if anyone else attempted to, for Priam reminds him of his own dear father. The old king's superabundant paternalism and all his piety are called up by this wonderful greeting: he addresses Hermes as his 'dear child', and avers that some god must have stretched out a protective hand over him in sending someone like this to meet him on the road, so wise, handsome and blest, so altogether promising: 'How fortunate your parents are!' The god responds with affable ambiguity that this is all very well said, and after further parley about Priam's needs and intentions, climbs into the chariot and whips the horses towards the Greek camp. At the camp defences he lays the guards asleep with his magic wand, opens the gate, and takes Priam and the treasure through to Achilles' hut, which is marked out by a strong palisade. There he draws the heavy bolt, carries in the ransom, and finally reveals himself, for it would never do for a god to be on casual visiting terms with mortals: 'I am an immortal, dear sir, Hermes; my father sent me to act as your guide. I am obliged to return without accepting human hospitality, but you should go inside, and clasp Achilles' knees in the proper form. Remind him of his father, mother and child, and see whether they can move his feelings.' Then he disappears to Olympus. The palimpsest effect we noted before is at work here too: if we ask what godlike miracles Hermes has wrought, the answer is, minor and tangential ones that do not interfere with Priam's independence. True, he takes on handsome human form, but this is a 'miracle' human beings are capable of too, and though he lays the Greek guards to sleep with his wand, it is night, and we may suppose them inclined to it. Otherwise he drives Priam's chariot, carries his burdens, and opens doors for him as any mortal would, subject to this world's laws of gravity and matter. The poet does not wish to have recourse to miracle, for the miracle occurred when Priam found the courage to leave the safety of Troy; Hermes is not being invoked</page><page sequence="14">14 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY to make it happen, but to show it in its strongest light. What is divine in the episode belongs to Priam: it is the purely human that Homer celebrates, in the piety and trust of an old man overcoming his terror. If this Iliad episode shares its palimpsest construction with the Odyssey one, however, it differs in the stress Homer is laying on the distinction between mortals and immortals. Hermes, says Zeus, is the god who most enjoys keeping humans company, but even Hermes is less sociable than Athene in the Odyssey . The language he speaks is redolent of pity rather than camaraderie , and in place of her smile of recognition and caress there is a steady reticence. When Priam marvels at Hermes and congratulates his parents the god does not give himself away, and in his quick retreat from human habitation we catch the essential 'otherness' of the immortals. There is a limit to the pleasures they can share with us, and there would be nemesis for them (says Hermes) if they grew familiar. They are caught up in being gods, in fact, as completely as mortals are in being human; and when mortals feel they understand them best, they may nevertheless be deluded. There is a poignant example of how each party is speaking out of the other's hearing in the way Priam, father of fifty sons, looks on Hermes in a paternal light and congratulates his parents, while Hermes, son of Zeus himself, adopts Priam as his father. Priam is speaking the only kind of truth men can; which is to say, a limited one, whose truthfulness he cannot gauge himself, for in the wider context known to the gods it turns into a cosmic pleasantry. When Hermes sees a father in Priam, the courtesy is as wise as Priam's own was innocent, but it is no more true. None the less, we long to add, they have not misunderstood one another in essence, and what they say is at least as true as not. For by firmly establishing the difference between them, Homer manages to insinuate two truths at once: on the one hand, what we 'know', that the god is on temporary leave of absence from an existence beyond our comprehension, and on the other, what we see, a god turning human to wait on a mortal. When Hermes speaks and looks like a young Myrmidon, affectionately claiming kinship with Priam and opening doors for him, that, as the imagination grasps things, is what he really is. If he is also a god, the perfect transformation argues a rare sympathy of divine imagination, and a rare worthiness in Priam to elicit it. The connection thus momentarily held across the gulf is secure for all its insecurities, and sheds a grace on both for all its brevity. If it is true that this episode balances more weight on a finer point than the Odyssey one, how should we explain our imaginative perversity by which gods gain our respect by greeting us across a</page><page sequence="15">OF GODS AND MEN 15 great divide, and cross it at their peril? Alain enjoins us to remember that 'we were children before we were men' (p. 25, from Descartes), and perhaps we should suspect that our ideas of deity never wholly outgrow the mould they take in early childhood, when dimly- perceived gods hover over our cradles with awesome power over the distribution of food and comfort, warmth and light. They are very busy about us and seem to understand our needs, but it is also clear that they have lives to lead elsewhere and speak another language than our own. As we grow older, we do not ask them to make themselves more intelligible to us by becoming children - that would be bathetic; instead we yearn to be more like them, £nd to make sense of adult mysteries for ourselves. It is for us to cross the great divide, not them; their part is to be visible on the farther side. Some such explanation, at least, seems required to explain the paradox by which Homer's gods satisfy the imagination most when they keep their distance from mortals, and why the very little they do for their favourites seems more than enough. Even outright neglect of duty does nothing to shake their status, for Zeus is not always sending Hermes to show pity to men: elsewhere in the Iliad he is feasting with Ethiopians, or turning his gaze towards the Hippemolgoi while the course of the war goes quite awry (Book 13). But that is what the imagination expects, though the rationalist mind protests, and speaks of moral consistency and responsible behaviour as the sine qua non of deities. The imagination pulls in the opposite direction and revels, perverse as it seems, in gods who are simply very powerful and very different; gods who rebuff our human assumptions and make no answer to our questions, like the most majestic god in all literature, who heaped afflictions on Job because he was 'perfect and upright', and explained himself best by refusing to explain: 'Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?' (38.4). We have wandered a long way from our original enquiry into the fascination of Pope's sylphs, but perhaps we can return to them from here with a clearer sense of how mock-epic, as well as epic, Machines owe their names and forms, not to pagan theology, but to seems to have retained in his sylphs and gnomes the greater part of the paradoxes that support Homer's Machinery: it is true that his Machines owe their names and forms, not to pagan theology, but 'the Rosicrucian Doctrine of Spirits' (Epistle), and his descriptions unite sources as various as Virgil's Iris, Shakespeare's fairies, and Milton's angels; but his stress goes like Homer's on how profoundly the sylphs and gnomes resemble the human beings they protect. Every sylph was a coquette once, now 'by a soft Transition' (I 49) disembodied, and her varying, evanescent form derives from the coquette's supreme concern, public honour. She perfectly under-</page><page sequence="16">16 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY stands Belinda's lesser concerns, cards, equipages and lovers, for these were her preoccupations also, and she alone knows the lenitive for female folly, to expel 'old Impertinence' by 'new' (I 94). Pope laid himself open to contemporary censure by failing to make the sylphs morally superior to Belinda, but in the light of Homer's gods we can see that this was never an important requirement for Machinery. The Tightness of his instinct emerges if we compare the sylphs for a moment to Milton's perfectly moral angels: if the Machinery's daily concerns are ineffably superior to our own, the imagination withdraws, sensing the implicit reproach. The angels get through eternity in 'song and dance about the sacred hill' (V 619) or sitting by the 'water of life' in 'fellowships of joy' (XI 79-80), but these are recreations inconceivable to mortal patience, and the Machinery in general earns the criticism Johnson levelled at the poem, that 'the want of human interest is always felt'. Pope's sylphs, on the other hand, answer to a known type, whose pre- occupations are so minor they lie within range of every imagination: 'to save the Powder from too rude a Gale,/ Nor let th'imprison'd Essences exhale' (II 93-4). But at the same time as Pope draws in the human physiognomy of his Machines, and does not exert himself to make them morally superior to humanity, he carefully draws in the one distinction beside which all similarities pale. He substitutes for the question of mortality which makes the foundation of human heroism in Homer the question of social mortality, so to speak, the coquette's honour; and in this respect the sylphs greet Belinda across a gulf as absolute as that which separates Zeus and Sarpedon, for they are dis- embodied and hence beyond temptation, while Belinda is made of flesh and in danger at every instant. From the moment Ariel appears to her in masculine form, 'more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau J (That ev'n in Slumber caus'd her Cheek to glow),' (I 23-4), her • social mortality is never in doubt;4 the question is only how well she will comport herself on the field of battle. Like all Homeric heroes she is allowed an aristeia before her defeat, her great victory over the Baron at cards; but it is followed by the revelation of human limitations on the society battlefield, and Ariel gives way to 'Fate' as sadly as Zeus once gave way to moira : Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the Foe drew near. Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought The close Recesses of the Virgin's Thought; As on the Nosegay in her Breast reclin'd, He watch'd th' Ideas rising in her Mind, 4 Pope lightly alludes to Eve, whose cheek glowed in her dream before the Fall {PL, V 10).</page><page sequence="17">OF GODS AND MEN 17 Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her Art, An Earthly Lover lurking at her Heart. Amaz'd, confus'd, he found his Pow'r expir'd, Resign'd to Fate, and with a Sigh retir'd. (Ill 138-46) This sudden helplessness on Ariel's part, and indeed the inefficacy of the Machinery throughout, was taken to be a fault by Dennis, and Johnson after him; but in the light of Homer's practice we can see that it is really indispensable, for it throws the poetic emphasis on Belinda where it belongs. Machinery is a divine shadow-play of the humanly possible, not of the supernatural; and at the great crisis of Belinda's career as a heroine it is humanly impossible that she should not have 'an Earthly Lover lurking at her Heart', whatever 'her Art' of social pretence allows to appear. Ariel's sudden loss of power, and his sighing retreat, give poignant reality to the great gulf fixed between disembodied coquettes and fleshly ones. At the same moment Belinda should be protecting her honour, she is getting ready for love and the loss of her virginity; yet just as the heroes on the battlefield are more serious than the gods above them, because they act under perpetual sentence of death, so Belinda is more serious than a disembodied sylph who has no virginity to lose. It is much more difficult to be Belinda: and it adds to the exquisite mixture of comic and serious tensions at this point that Belinda's 'death' is a pre-requisite for life as a mature woman. Unlike Sarpedon's fate it is greatly to be desired; Ariel's coquettish regrets cannot be ours, unless we wish to suspend Belinda in a state of virginity for ever. But having let us glimpse the seriousness at the centre of the joke, Pope whisks it out of view, and continues to make the Machinery lend 'the utmost Importance' to what is flagrantly superficial. In place of the sylphs who embody the ephemerality of Belinda's honour, he gives us gnomes who, as disembodied prudes, are specialists in the sourer emotions that follow from thwarted sexuality. From here to the end of the poem, Belinda's emotional range is from spleen to vindictiveness; and the acutest of Pope's mock-epic ironies is that the heroine is refusing the proffered dignity of suffering in a real cause. The terms of failure on her battlefield are as harsh as those prevailing at Troy, as Pope insinuates by transposing Sarpedon's speech (Book 12) for Clarissa: Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade, And she who scorns a Man, must die a Maid, (V 27-8) but Belinda merely 'frowns' to hear that her position is, in its own way, heroic. She does not mean to be any less superficial than the</page><page sequence="18">18 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY gnomes who serve her: if the poem is serious, it will be in spite of Belinda. We began by wondering why, when Machinery can do so much for the imagination, even miniaturised and inverted as here, it so rarely succeeds; and perhaps we should ask, by way of a coda, what put an end to its use. It is striking that, just as it was taken as an essential element in serious poetry at the start of the eighteenth century, it was equally obvious that it was something to avoid by the close - at least, to Wordsworth, who hoped to derive the scale of importance in the Prelude from the innate dignity of his subject, and not from any known technique for magnification. The closest he came to the use of Machinery was in his personification of Nature, and Nature, like other epic abstractions - Rumour, Discord, Dulness - cannot take part in the action, she can only be present and inspire. Perhaps the difficulty of keeping Machinery from becoming mere mechanism is explanation enough for its demise, since it was sinking into a cliché in Pope's day, and he himself could not always revitalise it: the gods of his Iliad and Odyssey translations are considerably less successful than his sylphs and gnomes. Perhaps, too, there is an additional factor in the encroachment of Christianity on serious poetry, which made the use of pagan gods, once conventionally exempt from being thought of as religion, seem faintly blasphemous. Pope could be Christian as a man and pagan as a poet without feeling the incongruity too deeply (though Christian piety produces some wooden notes in his treatment of Homer's gods), but Wordsworth cannot so divide himself, and the pagan deities are truly dead for his purposes. Nevertheless, Wordsworth faced the same problem of 'raising the Action' that had confronted his predecessors. If he wished to make a claim for the 'utmost Importance' of his subject, he had not merely to assert it, as we have seen, but to make it appear. In rejecting the simplest means of elevating our conceptions with Machinery, he may be said to have created in the Prelude a poem which is itself a Machine, that works at raising our conceptions in every line. For lack of an external agent to embody the scale of the subject, seriousness itself becomes the subject of the poem, and the poet works at it as inconclusively as Sisyphus rolls his stone. But the Prelude is not his only attempt at expressing the seriousness of being human, and it may be that in his shorter poems - especially the Lyrical Ballads , and 'Resolution and Independence' - he achieved as much, or more. For in these poems he has clearly not forgotten the open secret of anthropomorphic religion, although it has now taken a Christian form. If Homer's gods were a way of expressing the divinity of being human, these poems in which Wordsworth handles</page><page sequence="19">OF GODS AND MEN 19 humanity so tenderly in its most reduced and unpretending forms may be called tributes to the divinity of humanity in any guise. They are the embodiment of an anecdote of Alain's: To the Christian who has just given his coat to a beggar, the pagan, in his profound wisdom, says: 'No doubt you took him for a god.' 'No', replies the Christian, 'I took him for a man.' (p. 127, from Chateaubriand) Wordsworth is always taking his characters 'for men', and showing them to be divine in proportion to their inability to be anything more. The leech gatherer is not all alive nor dead, Nor all asleep - in his extreme old age: His body was bent double, feet and head Coming together in life's pilgrimage; (Resolution and Independence, 64-7) and it is decrepitude that makes him precious to the poet, as if in this worn body the spirit had been distilled to its divinest essence. As the old man talks on, the poet begins to see their meeting on the moor as an epiphany: the leech gatherer is 'like a man from some far region sent,/ To give me human strength, by apt admonishment' (1 1 1-12), and indeed the timing of his appearance and the divinity Words- worth perceives beneath his disguise tempt us to suspect that here, for one last time, we are watching Machinery at work. The leech gatherer answers to Machinery's paradoxical requirements, in that he is at once supremely human and utterly unlike what Wordsworth was expecting, and powerful without demonstrating his power. It is enough that he should be what he is, and that the poet has received 'admonishment' in his depression: I could have laughed myself to scorn to find In that decrepit Man so firm a mind. 'God', said I, 'be my help and stay secure; I'll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!' (137-40) Perhaps it is not fanciful to see here, in the real encounter of a young man and an old one on 'the lonely moor', an event with a literary antecedent without which it might not have become a poem: the meeting of Hermes and Priam on the Trojan Plain. Wordsworth, however, is finally releasing the embargo Homer placed on the exposure of the open secret: the divinity here is lodged, not with young Hermes, but with the old king. Wordsworth's exposure of the secret, though, carries attendant risks for, as we noted before, the divinity of man is a volatile truth that evaporates when freely aired. The tonic distance paganism</page><page sequence="20">20 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY maintained between god and man kept the imagination from straying into the realm of the all too human, where the assertion that the 'truly human' is 'truly divine' can only make us laugh; and Wordsworth's achievement is snatched from impending comedy and bathos. Once the purely human has been sanctified it becomes difficult to gauge the point at which it ceases to 'tell' artistically, and the first draft of the poem dwelt on the leech gatherer's marriage and ten children too. When the Hutchinson sisters found these details 'tedious', Wordsworth reproached them for their want of heart {Letters, 14 June, 1802), but his revisions confirm that the draft lacked artistic poise, and it had been easy to confuse the value of the facts themselves with their artistic value. We may suspect that both in his emphasis on the real existence of the leech gatherer (noted in the heading to the poem), and in his exposure of the secret that the 'truly human' was 'divine', Wordsworth made this mode of seriousness about human nature too volatile to be often repeated. He himself could not sustain it for long, and no other poet followed where he led: Machinery could not survive the exposure of its inner magic, any more than it could survive Lucian's satire of its mechanism.
