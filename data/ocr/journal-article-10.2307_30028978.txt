Studies in the Social and Cul- tural Foundations of Language 17. Pp. viii + 488. $74.95 (hardcover), $27.95 (paper). Reviewed by Regna Darnell, University of Western Ontario The editors and their coparticipants in a 1991 conference propose a fundamental recon- sideration of the so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Gumperz and Levinson argue that language, thought, and reality-the three terms of John B. Carroll's title for the collected works of Benjamin Lee Whorf (1956)-are best reconfigured as language, thought, and culture, reflecting increasing sophistication in delineating the relationship between cul- ture and community in contemporary social and linguistic theory: "Readers will find that the original idea of linguistic relativity still live[s], but functioning in a way that differs from how it was originally conceived" (p. 2). Readers who seek clarification of the ideas of Sapir and Whorf may be disap- pointed-the emphasis of both papers and section introductions is firmly revisionist. The new cognitive science synthesis, pushed particularly by Levinson, emphasizes universals rather than cultural diversities, rationalism and realism rather than empiricism and idealism: "In this light, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis seems uninteresting" (p. 177). Indeed, Levinson suggests that anthropology: ... remains largely outside this current of thought: viewed from cognitive science it is a reactionary output of empiricist ideas with an outmoded stress on human ideational difference and the importance of environmental learning. [ p. 1341 In any case, many readers-including some contributors to the later sections of the volume-will resist the apparently cavalier dismissal of ethnographic particularity. Part 1 deals with the relation between language and cognition. John Lucy includes both structure and use in his definition of linguistic relativity, noting, for example, that education changes traditional societies by redefining the referential function of language. His review of the present status of relativity research emphasizes that the languages compared must be, though they rarely are, treated on an equal footing. What he calls "discursive relativity" interacts dialectically with linguistic structure and language ideology. Dan Slobin focuses on "thinking for speaking," an active process of language learning and use, in which thought and language become processes rather than reified abstractions. Speakers of different languages appear to "experience" the events in a simple picture book differently in the process of "making a verbalized story out of them" (p. 88). Paul Kay argues that alternative expressive forms available within a single lan- guage often exceed the level of differences across languages. Accordingly, he redefines culture as a repertoire or "conceptual tool box," rather than as a coherent world view. Following the modular theory of mind most common today, Charles and Janet Keller explore different kinds of embodied thought illustrated by a blacksmith at work. Images, particularly visual, and actions are at least as important as linguistic forms. Part 2 explores universals in language and culture, concluding that the two, ulti- mately, cannot be separated. Levinson calls for "a sophisticated theory of the co- 151</page><page sequence="2">152 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 39 NO. 1 evolution of mind and culture" (p. 141). Melissa Bowerman, while granting the cognitive hypothesis of innate spatial knowledge that is nonlinguistic, emphasizes the other side of the coin-how children learn to cognize space through language. Levinson's examination of spatial expression in Tzeltal, a Mayan language, under- scores the ethnocentrism of Indo-European-based cross-cultural semantics. Tzeltal ab- solute spatial arrays contrast sharply with Indo-European "anthropomorphic anthropo- centrism" (p. 195) in locational strategies. Conceptual constraints are best viewed as uni- versal "filters" placing limits on "arbitrary variation" (p. 178). Kinship, color, and ethno- botanical terms have provided "spectacular cross-cultural uniformities in domain con- ceptualization" (p. 195). Nonetheless, there is still room for considerable variation within the constraints, and that variation remains interesting to the cognitive linguist- Levinson's statement (quoted above) aside. Pascal Boyer argues that "alien beliefs," even the most apparently culture-specific thereof (e.g., as pertain to religion), are variations on a common pattern of universal con- ceptual assumptions; they are "non-transmitted principles of intuitive knowledge" (p. 204). His "psychologically realistic" ethnography of Fang bekong (glossed as 'ghosts' or 'ancestors) emphasizes underlying assumptions that may be read as cues to inter- pretation. Part 3 is about context and background assumptions, which do not depend on the grammar and lexicon-the terms of Whorf's formulation of linguistic relativity. Indexi- cality (leading to reference more generally) and its interpretation in terms of local practices and uses (rather than structures) of language are foregrounded, following Dell Hymes's proposal of "two kinds of linguistic relativity" (1966). More than two decades of " ethnography of speaking" to the contrary, Gumperz and Levinson assert that "there are few studies of any depth of the general pragmatic systems of 'exotic' languages" (p. 227). William Hanks draws on Bourdieu's notion of "habitus" to reframe deictic systems as grammaticalized patterns of usage in which interpretation is relative to cultural practices and linguistic distinctions. The ethnography-of-speaking focus on rules of use is outdated because it excludes agency as well as practice. "Context dependency" moves ever "deeper into the language" (p. 232), while "verbal forms intersect with contexts defined by more than one interactant" (p. 233). Thus, "language serves to sediment routine practices, both constraining and enabling what they habitually do, think, per- ceive, and enact" (p. 237). Yucatec Maya deictic frames embed a wide range of cultural knowledge to which reference is expressed in relation to a functional hierarchy of infor- mation constraining speakers in context. Reports of metalinguistic discussion with Mayan speakers are particularly interesting. John Haviland is interested in transpositions or switches in interpretive frame in an aboriginal Australian storyteller's use of deictic gestures to punctuate a narrative through shifts in point of view that are specific to the context of the particular telling. Vantage point from the here and now to other narrated contexts is generalized by refer- ence to a range of theoretical models and crosslinguistic cases. It remains mysterious to Haviland that "transpositions must be interactively recoverable" (p. 317). Yet, it is in precisely this way that context moves deeper into language. Herbert Clark stresses that lexical meaning (not exclusively the narrowly indexical) is arrived at by collaboration among participants in interaction, making it virtually impossible (or at least counterproductive) to distinguish language from culture. The notion of "common ground" is explored at both personal and communal levels, with cultural communities incorporating considerable diversity in accordance with the variety of social identities. Yet interactional coordination is often if not always successful. Again, agency works, in tandem with context.</page><page sequence="3">1997 BOOK REVIEWS 153 Part 4 asserts that both "language" and "culture" need to be reconstituted inter- actionally, as networks of individuals. Focus moves from rules to "contextualization cues" for the interpretation of communicative behavior. The editors muse over whether the radical relativization of pragmatics will so thoroughly undermine the conventional categories of social science analysis as to make the practice of ethnography unsustain- able. Ethnographers, of whatever discipline, however, will doubtless reassert the em- pirical testability of the adequacy of their concepts and methods. The "common ground" essential to effective communication is often absent even within what appears to be a common language because of the incommensurability of sub- cultural communities. Codeswitching and contextualization cues are the key to success- ful communication. The editors argue that: "Context-invoking meta-messages provide a powerful, but subliminal, system governing the inferences that constitute language understanding" (p. 365). The frameworks needed for interpretation do not preexist but emerge from the communicative interaction. This focus on conversational inference renders both language and culture relative. Gumperz warns that the isolation of small communities, with its concomitant overlap of common grounds for communication, is disappearing around the world; variability without such overlap poses increasingly seri- ous challenges to local communication within global communities isolated into incom- mensurable straitjackets. Minorities are both constituted and maintained by such com- municative incommensurabilities. Elinor Ochs argues that culture is learned through linguistic socialization, under- stood as learning to assign indexical or situational meanings in culturally appropriate ways. Social identity, however, is less often overtly indexed in grammar than "time, space, and affective/epistemic stance" (p. 413). A universal cultural principle provides "candidate universal entailments" (p. 426), of which various exemplifying acts and identities are postulated. Nonetheless, there is considerable scope for local culture and considerable optimism for cross-cultural communication based on "humane" socializa- tion practices (p. 432). Elsa Gomez-Imbert describes the consequences of extreme multilingualism in the Vaupas basin of the northwest Amazon, where linguistic exogamy has characterized group interaction over sufficient time to affect language and language family boundaries. Animal shape classifiers are used to illustrate the complexities. It is difficult to categorize the papers in this volume in a single coherent version of the new paradigm heralded by many of the contributors. Whether or not they are correct that things are coming together in a new way, the range of papers effectively reflects the numerous angles from which anthropologists, linguists, and psychologists are reworking the ideas inherited from Whorf, Sapir, and Boas, in terms of ethnographic data, methods, and interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives not available to their predecessors. These scholars indeed stand on the shoulders of giants-and so acknowledge, although they are often critical of intervening generations' work dealing with linguistic relativity.
