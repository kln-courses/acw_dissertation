<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSEPH W. MEEKER THE COMEDY OF SURVIVAL Literary criticism seems determined to impress upon us the idea that literature is essentially an imitation of the actions of men. Few have disputed the doctrine of mimesis that is first spelled out in Plato's Republic and embellished with some modifications in Aristotle's Poe tics, though most subsequent critics have felt obliged to argue the niceties of what mimesis really means. Avoiding the argument, let us merely assume in a simpleminded way that literature does imitate human actions, and consider two examples of such imitation. Both seek to reproduce the same fictional action, but from different historical perspectives and using dif ferent literary modes. The first example is from Sophocles' Oedipus the King. It is the scene early in the play where Teiresias, the blind seer, first confronts the king with the suggestion that the murderer he is seeking is perhaps Oedipus himself: Teiresias: I say you are the murderer of the king whose murderer you seek. Oedipus: Not twice you shall say calumnies like this and stay unpunished. Teiresias: Shall I say more to tempt your anger more? Oedipus: As much as you desire; it will be said in vain.

Oedipus: Do you imagine you can always talk like this, and live to laugh at it hereafter? Teiresias: Yes, if the truth has anything of strength. In John Barth 's novel, Giles Goat-Boy, a central chapter is devoted to the translation of Oedipus' story into the idiom of comedy in a post-Freudian world. Barth 's version follows Sophocles' closely, but with rather different effect. The Barth account of the meeting between Gynander (Teiresias) and Taliped Decanus (Oedipus) shows all the solemnity of a vaudeville routine: Gynander: When this play's over you'll regret you made that silly vow of yours. You tragic-hero types are bloody bores. .... You're the wretch you want. You'll see, when Scene Four's done that you're your daughter's brother, your own stepson and foster-father, uncle to your cousin, your brother-in-law's nephew, and (as if that wasn't enough) a parricide?and a matriphile! Bye-bye now Taliped. You call me vile, but your two crimes will have us all upchucking: father-murdering and mother? Taliped: Ducking out won't save you. You'll hear from me! Gynander: You killed your daddy! You shagged your mommy! (he is taken away)^ Both scenes are recognizable imitations of the actions of men, and in this case the action being imitated is the same: the revelation of Oedipus' crimes. But the purposes, the language, the moods, and the contexts of the two pas sages could hardly contrast more than they do. Sophocles and John Barth are imitating different aspects of human action, and the difference between them illustrates a basic distinction between the tragic and the comic views of human behavior. Sophocles' purpose is to imitate man inso far as he is a creature of suffering and greatness; through his characters he demonstrates the enormous human capacity for creating and for enduring pain, for following a passion to its ultimate end, for employing the power of mind and spirit to rise above the contradictions of matter and circumstance even though one is destroyed by them. Sophocles imitates man's nobility. Barth imitates man's absurdity. Barth 's version emphasizes the ridiculousness of Oedipus' situation and suggests that the hero is slightly dense for not avoiding or at least realizing the mess he's made of his life. Barth 's image of man shows his innate stupidity and ignorance and emphasizes the triviality of 1. David Greene and Richmond Lattimore, The Complete Greek Tragedies (Chicago University Press, 1959), II, 26. 2. John Barth, Giles Goat Boy (Fawcett, New York, 1967), 323. human passions by reducing them to the level of street corner disputes. Sophocles' heroic view of man has not often been achieved. Whole cultures have lived and died without producing a tragic view of man with all that such a view entails. Tragedy, both as a literary form and as a philosoph ical attitude toward mankind, seems in fact to have been an invention of western culture, specifically of the Greeks. It is shared by those traditions influenced by Greek thought, though few of the cultures even in the direct line of that influence have produced a significant tragic literature rivaling that of ancient Greece. The intellectual presup positions necessary to the creation of tragic literature have not been present in all civilizations. The tragic view assumes that man exists in a state of conflict with powers that are greater than he is. Such forces as nature, the gods, moral law, passionate love, the greatness of ideas and knowledge all seem enormously above mankind and in some way determine his welfare or his suffering. Tragic literature and philosophy, then, undertake to demonstrate that man is equal or superior to his conflict. The tragic man takes his conflict seriously, and feels compelled to affirm his mastery and his greatness in the face of his own destruction. He is a triumphant image of what man can be. Aside from the work of the Greeks and a few Elizabethans, such images have rarely appeared before us in a convincing manner. Comedy, on the other hand, is very nearly universal. Comic literature appears wherever human culture exists, and often where it doesn't. Comedy can be universal largely because it depends less upon particular ideologies or metaphysical systems than tragedy does. Rather, comedy grows from the biological circumstances of life. It is un concerned with cultural systems of morality. As Susanne Langer puts it, comedy is truly amoral in that it has, literally, "no use" for morality?that is, moral insights play no significant role in the comic experience. Similarly, comedy avoids strong emotions. Passionate love, hate, or patriotism generally appear ridiculous in a comic context, for comedy creates a psychological mood which is in compatible with deep emotions. Great ideas and ideals fare no better at the hands of comedy, which ordinarily treats them as if they were insignificant. When noble idealism does appear in comedy, its vehicle is commonly a Tartuffe or a Malvolio whose nobility turns out to be merely a sham intended to conceal selfish or ignoble motives. The comic view of man demonstrates that men behave irration ally, committing follies which reveal their essential igno rance and ridiculousness in relation to civilized systems of ethical and social behavior. As Aristotle puts it, comedy imitates the actions of men who are subnormal or inferior to the social norm just as tragedy imitates the actions of superior men. Many therefore argue that comedy is basically depressing and pessimistic, while tragedy is optimistic in that it shows man's potential strength and greatness. No doubt this is true, providing you believe that the metaphysical morality that encourages man to rise above his natural environ ment and his animal origins is humanity's best hope for 3. Susanne Langer, Feeling and Form (New York: Scribner's, 1953), 345. 12 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SUMMER 1972</page><page sequence="3">progress and survival. That proposition, however, is seriously in doubt in our time. We have good reasons to suspect the wisdom of our inherited traditions of meta physical idealism. Philosophy since Nietzsche has catalogued the poverty of humanistic idealism, evolutionary biology has demonstrated the animality of mankind, contemporary psychology has shown that the mind is guided by many forces stronger than great ideas, our political philosophies fail daily to meet our simplest needs, and now the environ mental crisis raises the possibility that the world itself and all its creatures are in jeopardy because we have thought too highly of ourselves. The tragic view of man, for all its flattering optimism, has led to cultural and biological disasters, and it is time we looked for alternatives which might encourage better the survival of our own and other species. Comedy demonstrates that man is durable even though he may be weak, stupid, and undignified. As the tragic hero suffers or dies for his ideals, the comic hero survives without them. At the end of his tale he manages to marry his girl, evade his enemies, slip by the oppressive authorities, avoid drastic punishment, and to stay alive. His victories are all small, but he lives in a world where only small victories are possible. His career demonstrates that weak ness is a common condition of mankind that must be lived with, not one worth dying for. Comedy is careless of morality, goodness, truth, beauty, heroism, and all such abstract values men say they live by. Its only concern is to affirm man's capacity for survival and to celebrate the continuity of life itself, despite all moralities. Comedy is a celebration, a ritual renewal of biological welfare as it persists in spite of the reasons there may be for feeling metaphysical despair. The Greek demigod Comus, whose name we probably have to thank for the origin of the word comedy, was a god of fertility in the largest sense. His concerns included not only ordinary sexual fertility of plants, men, and animals, but also the general success of family and community life insofar as these depend upon biological processes. Comus was content to leave matters of great intellectual import to Apollo and gigantic passions to Dionysus while he busied himself with the maintenance of the commonplace condi tions that are friendly to life. Maintaining equilibrium among living things, or restoring it once it has been lost, are Comus' special talents, and they are shared by the many comic heroes who follow the god's example. Literary comedy depicts the loss of equilibrium and its recovery. Wherever the normal processes of life are ob structed unnecessarily, the comic mode seeks to return to normal. When the young men all disappear from their wives' beds in order to fight a foolish foreign war, for instance, Lysistrata makes use of her own wit and of the lecherousness of generals in order to bring the boys home again. Typical of comic action, Lysistrata demonstrates no discovery of a new truth and no permanent conquest over an evil force, but merely a return to a former normalcy. No enemy has been destroyed and no new conquests have been made. The victory is temporary, and it has been accomplished with the most modest of weapons: wit, luck, persuasion, and a bit of fanciful inventiveness. The antagonists are momentarily reconciled, the killing ceases, the men make love to their wives, and the wives raise children and keep house, which is exactly what they were doing before the heroics of warfare interfered with their lives. Like most significant comedy, Lysistrata pretends only to show how mankind can hold its own and survive in a world where both real and artificial threats to survival abound. Comedy muddles through, but seems to care little for progress or perfection. Those who are disposed in favor of heroism and idealistic ethics will say that comedy is trivial in its insistence that the commonplace is worth maintaining. The comic response is that man's high moral ideals and glorified heroic poses are themselves largely based upon fantasy, and are likely to lead to misery or death for those who hold them. As comedy sees it, the important thing is to live and to encourage life even though it is probably meaningless to do so. If the survival of our species is trivial, then so is comedy. 2. If comedy is essentially biological, is it possible that biology is also comic? Probably so. Some animal ethologists argue that humor is not only a deterrent to aggression, but an essential ingredient in the formation of intraspecific bonds, and it appears to have a phylogenetic basis in many animals as well as in man. Beyond this behavioral level, structures in nature seem to reveal organ izational principles and processes which closely resemble the patterns found in comedy. Productive and stable ecosystems are those which minimize destructive aggression, encourage maximum diversity, and seek to establish equi librium among their participants much as literary comedy does. Biological evolution itself shows all the flexibility of comic drama, and little of the monolithic passion peculiar to tragedy. Ecology is to a large extent the study of plant and animal succession. Ecologists seek to understand the processes through which interactions among species over long periods 4. Konrad Lorenz, On Aggression (New York: Bantam Books, 1967), 171-173, 284-287. THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SUMMER 1972 13</page><page sequence="4">of time produce the various biological communities and environments found in the natural world. At an early stage in any given environment, pioneering or invading species dominate the scene. These are highly generalized, flexible, and adaptable creatures capable of surviving despite the inhospitable nature of their environment. Pioneers must be aggressive, competitive, and tough. On an evolutionary time scale, their careers are brief but dramatic episodes, but they make possible the more stable ecosystems which fol low them. Many weeds that grow on newly cleared land following fires, volcanic eruptions, or construction projects are pioneer plants such as dandelions and crabgrass. Week end gardeners know well their tenacity and durability. Rats, too, are pioneers capable of thriving against terrible odds by exploiting the meager resources available, as are starlings and several varieties of eels and carp. Many of the species that men find objectionable?the "weeds," "trash fish," and "nuisance" mammals and birds?are pioneering or invading species whose life styles resemble behavior that men have admired most when they have seen it in other men. Ecological pioneering species, like human pioneers, are creatures capable of living without some of the normal needs felt by others of their kind. They are heroic individuals who make their homes where no one else wants to live, and their lives lead the way toward challenging and dangerous horizons. They risk death in order to conquer new territory, and their survival depends upon their individual qualities of strength, aggressiveness, and often their ruthlessness. Pioneer species are the loners of the natural world, the tragic heroes who sacrifice themselves in satisfaction of mysterious inner commands which they alone can hear. Perhaps that sounds like anthropomorphism of the worst sort, but I think it is not. I am not suggesting at all that dumb plants and animals possess human qualities. Rather, the comparison suggests that much of our elaborate philosophizing over human behavior has been mere rational ization of relatively common natural patterns of behavior which are to be found in many species of plants and animals. It is part of our tragic pride that we assume remarkable behavior to be the result of a remarkable personality and an exclusively human prerogative. But Achilles does no more or less for human posterity than a fireweed growing on the slopes of a volcano does for the plants that will succeed it. The major difference, perhaps, is that the fireweed will indeed be succeeded by dif ferent kinds of plants until ultimately a complex forest emerges, while Achilles will be reincarnated by imitators from among his own species for many centuries, to the grief of many Troys and many Hectors. The process of ecological succession begun by the pioneer species leads toward a climax ecosystem. Climax communities of plants and animals are extremely diverse and complicated groupings of living things which exist in a relatively balanced state with one another and with their nonliving environment. A climax ecosystem is a much more complicated affair than any human social organization, if only because it integrates the diverse needs and activities of a very large number of different species. Human social sys terns have only one animal to deal with, man, plus minor adjustments to keep alive the few domesticated plants and animals enslaved to man. But a natural climax accommo dates not only the complete life of every species within it, but also provides for relatively harmonious relationships among all of its constituent species. In a mature ponderosa pine forest, for instance, thousands of highly specialized types of bacteria maintain stable soil chemistry as each type plays its particular role in the processes of decomposition; insects live upon plants and bacteria and are eaten by birds; small mammals breed in the complex vegetation; larger mam mals eat certain specific kinds of plants or prey upon smaller animals; the many highly specialized plants, from small ferns to enormous pines, make up the setting for all other life, provide food and shelter, and in turn depend upon the environmental determinants of weather and geography. It is an unbelievably complicated community in which no individual and no species can survive well unless all other species survive, for all are ultimately dependent upon the completeness of the environment as a whole. The diversity of a climax ecosystem is one of the secrets of its durability. Life for any individual in such a system is a dangerous affair, for there is always some other individual nearby who needs to eat him. The welfare of individuals is thoroughly subordinated to the welfare of the group. No individuals and no particular species stand out as overwhelmingly dominant, but each performs unique and specialized func tions which play a part in the overall stability of the com munity. It is the community itself that really matters, and it is likely to be an extremely durable community so long as balance is maintained among its many elements. Few men have ever known what it means to live in a climax ecosystem, at least not since the emergence of con sciousness which has made man man. We have generally acted the role of the pioneer species, dedicating ourselves to survival through the destruction of all our competitors and to achieving effective dominance over other forms of life. Western civilization, at least, has developed as a tragedy does, through the actions of pioneering leaders who break new ground and surmount huge obstacles. Religion and philosophy have usually affirmed the pioneer's faith that only our own kind really counts, and that we have a right perhaps even an obligation?to destroy or subjugate what ever seems to obstruct us. Some of our more benevolent societies have provided for wide diversification among men, but none has extended e pluribus unum to include other species. Like comedy, climax ecology is cosmopolitan. What ever may exist has an equal right to exist, and no individual prejudices or passions are sufficient cause to threaten the welfare of the structure as a whole. Necessity, of course, is real. All must eat and in turn be eaten, storms must come and go, and injustices must occur when so many rightful claimants contend. But that is just the point: comedy and ecology are systems designed to accommodate necessity and to encourage acceptance of it, while tragedy seeks to avoid or to transcend the necessary in order to accomplish the impossible. We can accomplish whatever we can imagine, according to the teachings of our humanistic tradition, and many of 14 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SUMMER 1972</page><page sequence="5">our imaginings have been directed toward making ourselves more perfect. Our brain makes it possible to modify human behavior according to conceptual plans which may or may not agree with established natural processes or with man's own instinctual needs. Unlike other animals, man can select from a large number of conceptual possibilities the behavior that he prefers for mating, social organization, ag gression and defense, rearing of offspring, and the mainte nance of food supply. The capacity to choose one's behavior presupposes the possibility of choosing erroneously, and it may be that many of the environmental problems facing us today are the products of our own mistaken choices. But what does "mistaken" mean, and how can we possibly know the difference between ecological wisdom and ecological insanity? It is a bit depressing to realize that such questions have been asked seriously only in recent years. Generally, our behavior has been guided by presumed metaphysical principles which have neglected to recognize that man is a species of animal whose welfare depends upon successful integration with the plants, animals, and land that make up his environment. Because they cannot choose as broadly as we, other animals have more successfully maintained the behavioral patterns which make their own survival possible while contributing to the long-term maintenance of their environ ments. The recent growth of ethology, the study of animal behavior, is a sign that we are beginning to see animals as significant sources of information about living well. The ancient prejudice that animal behavior is merely a simplified form of human behavior is no longer tenable, for ethologists have consistently discovered that even the simplest of creatures follow exceedingly complicated and often highly sophisticated patterns of behavior, many of which continue to defy human understanding. The rituals of reproduction and rearing, the defense of territory, the maintenance of social systems, nest-building, migrations, systems of food gathering are animal activities quite as intricate as our own systems for doing the same things. The simplest migratory bird has a guidance system that is more subtle and far more reliable than our most sophisticated ICBM, and any pair of whooping cranes has a courtship and sex life at least as complicated as Romeo and Juliet's. We are slowly beginning to realize that we have grossly underestimated the animals. The truth may be that civilized human life is much simpler than most animal life. We seem to have used our enlarged brain in order to reduce the number of choices facing us, and we have sought the simple way of destroying or ignoring our competition rather than the more demanding task of accommodating ourselves to the forces that surround us. We establish artificial polarities like good and evil, truth and falsehood, pain and pleasure, and demand that a choice be made which will elevate one and destroy the other. We transform complicated environments into ecologically simple farmlands. We seek unity and fear diversity. We demand that one species, our own, achieve unchallenged dominance where hundreds of species lived in complex equilibrium before our arrival. In our present environmental dilemma, we stand like a pioneer species facing heroically the con sequences of our own tragic behavior, and we have much need to learn from the more stable comic heroes of nature, the animals. Tragedy demands that choices be made among alterna tives; comedy assumes that all choice is likely to be in error and that survival depends upon finding accommodations which will permit all parties to endure. Evolution itself is a gigantic comic drama, not the bloody tragic spectacle imagined by the sentimental humanists of early Darwinism. Nature is not "red in tooth and claw" as Tennyson would have it, for evolution does not proceed through battles fought among animals to see who is fit enough to survive and who is not. Rather, the evolutionary process is one of adaptation and accommodation, with the various species exploring opportunistically their environments in search of a means to maintain their existence. Like comedy, evolu tion is a matter of muddling through. Literary comedy and biological evolution share in com mon the view that all change is conservative. Organisms and comic heroes change their structure or behavior only in order to preserve an accustomed way of life which has been threatened by changes in the environment. The fish that developed lungs when his home in the sea became untenable was not a radical revolutionary, but a public-spirited preserver of his genetic heritage. The famous peppered moth of Birmingham who changed his color from light grey to black when smoke from the industrial revolution discolored the bark on his native trees may have denied thousands of years of moth tradition, but his adaptation made it possible to preserve moth existence. If there were moral philosophers among the fishes and moths, these 5. Charles F. Hockett and Robert Ascher, "The Human Revolu tion," Current Anthropology, 5, No. 3(1964), 140. THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SUMMER 1972 15</page><page sequence="6">innovations would very likely have been condemned as threats to the continuity of tradition, or perhaps as shame ful immorality. All admiration would no doubt have been reserved for the heroic fish who would rather die than eschew gills and the moth who nobly faced his end wearing customary grey. Fossilized remains attest to the many extinct animals who insisted upon the propriety of their traditions in the face of a changing world. To say that change is conservative may confuse anyone who thinks the term is the antonym of "liberal" and that it describes a mental attitude in favor of traditional social values and customs. The conservative principle in biology is evolutionary, signifying those variations in structure and behavior which adapt an organism more perfectly to a changing environment, thus conserving its genetic continuity despite changes in form. Whatever may threaten the continuity of life itself is expendable and subject to modification by evolution, whether it be gills or social rituals. To evolution and to comedy, nothing is sacred but life itself. The old Italian whoremaster in Joseph Heller's Catch-22 teaches a similar lesson: I was a fascist when Mussolini was on top, and I am an anti fascist now that he has been deposed. I was fanatically pro German when the Germans were here to protect us against the Americans, and now that the Americans are here to protect us against the Germans I am fanatically pro-American." Nately, the naively idealistic American soldier to whom he is talking, sputters in dismay that he is a shameful, un scrupulous opportunist, and the old man replies only: "I am a hundred and seven years old." Young Nately, com mitted to the idealism of keeping the world safe for democracy, dies in combat before his twentieth birthday. The old man's morality rests upon the imperative of preserving life itself at all costs, a principle which overrides all other moral commitments. Evolution is just such a shameful, unscrupulous, oppor tunistic comedy, the object of which appears to be the proliferation and preservation of as many life forms as possible without regard for anyone's moral ideas. Success ful participants in it are those who remain alive when circumstances change, not those who are best able to destroy competitors and enemies. Its ground rules for participants (including man) are those which also govern literary comedy: 1. Adapt to circumstances if possible. 2. Avoid all-or-nothing choices. 3. Any alternative is preferable to death. 4. Encourage all diversity. 5. Accept the accidental limitations of birth and environ ment. 6. Prefer love to war; if war is inevitable, humble the enemy without destroying him. The tragic events depicted in literature cannot occur if these principles are observed; comic action follows naturally from them. 6. Joseph Heller, Catch-22 (New York: Dell, 1961), 251-252. 3. Oscar Wilde offered an important amendment to Aristotle when he observed that life imitates art at least as much as art imitates life. Artists and thinkers create images of what life might be like and so provide models for human behavior which men may imitate. Don Quixote was not born a knight-errant, but discovered his profession by reading tales of adventure. Like him, we can choose to some extent the roles we wish to play from among the many models preserved by our literature and cultural traditions. Generally we have preferred to imitate the tragic mode, perhaps because it satisfies our vanity and makes our actions seem important. It is gratifying to think of oneself as a hero, a great sufferer, a martyr, or an oppressed idealist. Oedipus and Hamlet might not have kept our attention all these centuries if they had not offered illustrious images showing us how to bear pain magnificently. But the tragic heroes preserved in literature are the products of metaphysical pre suppositions which most of us cannot honestly share, any more than Don Quixote could live up to the requirements of medieval chivalry in Renaissance Spain. A post Freudian world no longer sees incest as an offense against the universe as Oedipus did, nor can we share Hamlet's view that revenge will give peace to the ghost of his slain father. The philosophical props and settings for genuine tragic experience have disappeared in recent centuries. We can pretend to tragic heroism, but our pretense is painfully hollow and melodramatic without the beliefs that tragedy depends upon. Prerequisite to tragedy is the belief that the universe cares about the lives of human beings. There must be a faith that some superior order exists, and that man will be punished if he transgresses against it. It matters little whether this principle takes the form of fate, the gods, or impersonal moral law, for all are symbols of the world's interest in human actions and evidence that the welfare of all creation somehow depends upon what humans do. Corollary to this is the assumption that man is essentially superior to animal, vegetable, and mineral nature and is destined to exercise mastery over all natural processes, including those of his own body. The most respected tragedy further assumes that some Truth exists in the universe which is more valuable than life itself. There must be abstract ideas and values which are worth dying and suffering for, or else the hero's painful quest for spiritual purity and enlightenment becomes ludicrous and absurd. Absurd is the adjective used to describe these assump tions, in the rather technical sense in which existential philosophy uses the term. The faith upon which the tragic edifice has been built is seen in our time as a clear illustra tion of the contradiction between man's expectations and the world's refusal to meet them. The world has never cared about man, nature has never shown itself inferior to humanity, and truth has never been revealed in its awesome majesty except in the creations of tragic literature. Tragedy does not imitate the conditions of life, but creates condi tions which men mimic in their attempts to attain the flattering illusions of dignity and honor. In an age which perceives dignity, honor, truth, law, and the gods as the 16 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SUMMER 1972</page><page sequence="7">inventions of egocentric man and not as given facts of the universe, tragedy can only parody itself. More appropriate to our time are the relatively modest assumptions made by the comic spirit. Man is a part of nature and subject to all natural limitations and flaws. Morality is a matter of getting along with one's fellow creatures as well as possible. All beliefs are provisional, and subject to change when they fail to produce harmonious consequences. Life itself is the most important force there is: the proper study of mankind is survival. When the existence of many species, including our own, and the continuity of the biological environment are threatened as they are now, we can no longer afford the wasteful and destructive luxuries of a tragic view of life. As patterns of behavior, both tragedy and comedy are strategies for the resolution of conflicts. From the tragic perspective, the world is a battleground where good and evil, man and nature, truth and falsehood make war, each with the goal of destroying its polar opposite. Warfare is the basic metaphor of tragedy, and its strategy is a battle plan designed to eliminate the enemy. That is why tragedy ends with a funeral or its equivalent. Comic strategy, on the other hand, sees life as a game. Its basic metaphors are sporting events and the courtship of lovers, and its con clusion is a wedding rather than a funeral. When faced with polar opposites, the problem of comedy is always how to resolve conflict without destroying the participants. Comedy is the art of accommodation and reconciliation. Though the comic/ecological view of life may be modest and unheroic, it is anything but simple. Some super rationalists like Ayn Rand reject the current interest in ecology by arguing that a "return to nature" (? la Rousseau) would be a denial of the mental capacities of mankind, as well as being impossible in a world as complicated and populous as ours. Their assumption that nature is simple while civilization is complex is one of the sad legacies of romantic thought. Post-Renaissance philosophy has taught us to think of nature either as an idyl of simplicity and peace populated by noble savages (Rousseau and most romanticism) or as a bloody battlefield where only the most brutal can survive (Hobbes and nineteenth century social Darwinism). Both views drastically oversimplify the intricate processes of nature because they reflect the methods and values of a pioneer species, man, and thus overlook the complexity that is present in the more highly developed species of an ecological climax. If a "return to nature" were to be based upon the model of a climax ecosystem, civilization would have to become far more complex than anything man has yet produced. Our values could no longer assume that man is at the center of creation, but would have to provide also for the welfare of all the plants, animals, and land of our environment. Man would have to cultivate a new and more elaborate mentality capable of understanding intricate processes without destroy ing them. Ecology challenges us to vigorous complexity, not passive simplicity. If the lesson of ecology is balance and equilibrium, the lesson of comedy is humility and endurance. The comic mode of human behavior that we find in literature is the closest we have come to describing man as an adaptive animal. Comedy illustrates that survival depends upon our ability to change ourselves rather than our environment, and upon our ability to accept our limitations with laughter rather than with shame or grim resignation. It is a strategy for living which agrees well with the demands of ecological wisdom, and we can no longer afford to ignore it as a model for our behavior if we hope to keep a place for our species among the other animals who live according to the comic mode. Dante called his poem The Comedy. Some theologians who mistook Dante's intention later added "divine" with out the author's permission, and the mistake has led readers since to see the work as a textbook of medieval religious beliefs. But Dante's purpose was "to remove those living in this life from the state of misery and lead them to the state of felicity." In order to accomplish this, Dante believed that he must present the world in all its complex multiplicity so that men could better understand where they were in relation to everything else, material and spiritual. Misery, according to Dante, is the result of mistaking or distorting one's vision so that only a fragment of reality can be seen, and then taking that fragment for the whole. Felicity becomes possible as the eye learns to see the millions of fragments which make up the universe interacting with one another to create a cosmos. Dante's Comedy presents an ecological view of life in the largest sense of ecology. His Hell is a sink of noxious gasses, polluted water, and denuded forests. The people there have caused their own misery, for they all suffer an impairment of vision which causes them to exaggerate their selfish rights and to satisfy themselves at any cost to others or to the world around them. All seem rather heroic to us, for they live according to the principles of tragic heroes. Purgatory is a place of learning, where men discover what else there is in the world beside themselves. As they increase in understanding and perspective, they begin to see the causes of human misery and degradation, and so gradually become free of them. Paradise is an extremely complicated place, physically and intellectually. The inhabitants there see themselves as a part of the complex physical, spiritual, and social life of the world, and they are intensely aware of their own relationships to what they see. Paradise is where human awareness expands to comprehend the complexity of things, rather than reducing complexity to simple principles easily grasped. The focus there is on the processes of life, not upon goals or rewards. In his final vision in Paradise, Dante sees: that which is scattered in leaves through the universe, sub stances and accidents and their relations as it were fused together in such a way that what I tell of is a simple light. I think I saw the universal forni of this complex, because in telling of it I feel my joy expand. Dante's vision is genuinely comic, thoroughly ecological, and the highest expression of both comedy and ecology. 7. Dante, Ep?stola X: Letter to Can Grande, tr. P. Wicksteed (E. P.
