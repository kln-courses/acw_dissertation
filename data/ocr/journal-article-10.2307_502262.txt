In this second monograph in the series Studia Archaeologica, published by the Archaeological In- stitute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Kalicz has provided a full site report of the excavation of a cemetery of seven cremation burials belonging to the Baden-Pecel culture. The cemetery is located near the mountain village of Center, Hungary, 4 km. north of the town of Ozd, near the Czechoslovakian border. It yielded the first cremations of the Pecel culture in northern Hungary, and the first face-urns ever found in Hungary.</page><page sequence="2">72 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 69 In about eleven pages the seven burials are com- pletely described and the objects catalogued. The rest of the book is occupied with a thorough discussion of comparanda for the special aspects of the Center material itself and further parallels for the whole Baden-Pecel complex, which is transitional in Hungary between Lengyel and proper Bronze Age cultures. The Center cemetery furnishes a small but highly de- veloped and therefore important site in the Baden- Pecel sequence, which spread at first throughout the Hungarian plain and then later into the highlands to the NW and NE of the plain. Kalicz discusses the characteristic Baden-Pecel ma- terial exhaustively and finds parallels for: the use of cremation; the erection of grave stelae; the pottery: pithoi, anthropomorphic pots, various shapes (fish- shaped containers, compartmented bowls, bowls with inturned rims and knobs, suspension-pots), attach- ments (high-swung ribbon handles, pulled-out spouts), and decoration (channeling, punctate bands); metal diadems and torques; the Budakalisz wagon model. These of course are only the most important and in- teresting elements whose ramifications Kalicz pursues. The author is led by his findings to the conclusion that there are in the Baden culture a few minor sur- vivals from Lengyel (pre-Baden in the Danube Basin) and some minor relationships with the Funnel Beaker culture (northern Neolithic) and the Bodrogkeresztur culture (contemporary with early Baden in the Hun- garian Plain). He finds however that the overwhelm- ing proportion of new factors evident in the Baden- Pecel culture can be paralleled in Bulgaria, Macedon, and the Early Bronze cultures of Anatolia (Troy III-V, Ahlatlibel, Kusura, Alaca), the Aegean (Thermi, Poliochni) and Mainland Greece (Aghios Kosmas). His thesis, viewed from the Anatolian angle, seems to show the expansion of Anatolian culture to the north and west at several points in the Early Bronze Age and, with a lag, the appearance of these traits in the North Balkan and Hungarian Plain areas. Kalicz, following Schachermeyr and Schaeffer in his absolute dating, prefers ca. 2100/2050-1900 for the temporal extent of the Baden-Pecel culture. Within this period he rearranges the previously accepted series of sites at a few points, where it now seems called for in the light of the new Center material and his southern-sources theory. Kalicz is very generous in his acknowledgment of obligation to earlier scholars in the field. He is de- pendent, of course, on the basic publication by J. Banner in Archaeologia Hungarica 35 (1956) q.v., and Banner's map of the Baden-Pecel sites was evi- dently at his elbow. Unfortunately for us, however, no map at all was included in the present work. An excellent and exhaustive background bibliography is furnished throughout the heavily footnoted text, and a good bibliography of related Anatolian sites can be derived from the list of sources for the smaller draw- ings of comparanda. The photographs of the Center finds are very good, but the small line-drawings of parallel materials from Anatolia and elsewhere are not properly shaded and are in some cases unsatisfactory. The edition is well printed on glossy paper and the halftones are excellent. ELLEN L. KOHLER UNIVERSITY MUSEUM, PHILADELPHIA</page></plain_text>
