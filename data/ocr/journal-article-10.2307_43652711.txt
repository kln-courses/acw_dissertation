Berkeley: University of California Press, 2013. 320 pp. For cult secular to think citizens of missionaries of contemporary as anything industrialized other than agents nations, of coercion. it is diffi- cult to think of missionaries as anything other than agents of coercion. While methods may vary over time and across religious traditions, the common thread running through mission histories from a secular perspec- tive is that missionaries attempt to transform people through the promul- gation of specific religious beliefs and practices. What makes this a nec- essarily coercive project from this point of view is the fact that religion is largely understood to stand outside of the sphere of rationality. For secu- lar citizens, the main- perhaps the only- legitimate form of non-coercive evangelism (it is hard to find terms not borrowed from a religious vocabu- lary) is through rational, critical debate. If religion is about beliefs, ones that are not provable in a scientistic register, then missionization is a project of illegitimately forcing people to change. Unlike souls, minds and opinions can be changed through discussion or through targeted acts of information dispersal. The political activism of the Facebook era is largely predicated on a much older model of con- sciousness raising: people only think the way they do because they do not know the real state of things. Let them know about the true costs of fossil fuel consumption (insert your own pet project here) through catchy posts on social media, and they will start to "like" these posts, "share" them, and maybe even call their elected representatives. But secularists are not the only ones concerned with the coercive na- ture of missionizing. Missionaries also worry about "rice Christians," those who participate in mission activities only to take advantage of economic benefits; or syncretism, a state of religious mixture that, from a mission- ary perspective, is due to a poor understanding of the path to salvation.

In the American evangelical cases with which I am most familiar, this reformist agenda was captioned as a critique of the mainline missions that coerced potential converts into being Western rather than being authentic, free, and local Christians. While the groups and organizations involved in this reformist agenda were varied, they all shared a dedication to missionization that avoided insti- tutions-schools, mission stations, rules of conduct, or dress- and ad- vocated the capacities for freedom found in linguistic debate, especially debate centered on the Bible (Handman n.d.). Bible translation, then, became the premier form of non-coercive mis- sionization. To only slightly caricature this position, the missiological method was: go, translate, leave, and let the Holy Spirit do the rest. The Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL, International) is a global linguis- tics and literacy NGO whose roughly 4,500 members are largely focused on translating the New Testament into hundreds of languages around the world. Translators spend about 1 5 years in a given locale translating scrip- tures into the native language of local people so that they can easily and accurately receive Christianity's revelations. In its members' own estima- tion, SIL is not a church planting organization- in fact it avoids the term "mission" all together- but is instead a global network of people engaged in the spread of important information, just like those environmentalist ad- vocates whose posts populate my Facebook feed. SIL (and many other Christian groups more willing to take on the "mission- ary" name) have long had a partner in these efforts in the British and Foreign Bible Society, founded in London in 1804, and the subject of Matthew Engelke's excellent God's Agents: Biblical Publicity in Contemporary England. The goal of the Bible Society was to provide the scriptures to ev- ery person in the world, ideally in a speaker's native language (2). From its London headquarters, the Bible Society helped manufacture and distribute Bibles around the globe that were often translated by members of other Christian groups like SIL. The crucial distinguishing feature for Bible Society products was that they would offer no "note or comment" (3). "There was to be no direction given to the way a passage should be read, no interpretive notes or marginalia. The Bible was to speak for itself" (3). The Bible, offered by itself without note or comment, then, already takes on the assumptions about coercion and legitimacy that are usually more associated with secular liberalism. To be sure, the world of Bible 556</page><page sequence="3">COURTNEY HANDMAN translation includes within its cast of characters entities like God and the Holy Spirit who are normally excluded from the public sphere. However, it is important to see that this in itself does not condemn it, from a Christian perspective, to illiberal agency. The point of liberalism is that other hu- mans have no legitimate right to compel you to think a certain way, and certainly evangelical Christians would agree. Yet, they would also say that God or the Holy Spirit do have that power. If the missionary could only convince his or her interlocutors to pick up the Bible, to gain more infor- mation in the service of informed debate, then these spiritual beings can have a chance to do their own work of convincing (or, to use the language of evangelism, "conviction"). From 1804 to the present, the Bible Society has worked to make the opportunities for that conviction as easy as possible for people around the world by making the Bible as available as possible. And yet for people living within contemporary England, access to the Bible is not a prob- lem. Most people, in fact, have a copy of the Bible (usually the Authorized Version, also known as the King James Version). The Bible Society has a rather different task within its own borders. The logic of liberal secularism has so pervaded English society that the Bible Society's task in this con- text is to make it safe for people to even allow that Bible to speak. How do you bring up the Bible in polite society without, as so many of Engelke's informants put it, being taken for "a nutter"? This is the task of the Bible Advocacy Team, the primary ethnographic focus of Engelke's book. The team works across four major cultural "driv- ers" (media, arts, politics, and education; note the modernist assumption of semi-autonomous domains of social life) to create a space for bibli- cal discourse in public debate. Understanding England to be a pluralist society, the team's goal is not to make the Bible the only voice but sim- ply a voice among many others. Echoing liberal secular strictures on the proper formation of the public, the team works to construct the Bible as a proper resource within the public sphere debate. And just like the Secular Humanists who often oppose them, the members of the Bible Advocacy Team find abhorrent the image of the religious believer who acts like a puppet controlled from above, citizens who renounce their rationality in order to work and speak in lockstep with some totalizing institution such as a denomination. Christianity does not mean uniformity for the team, but rather difference (1 46). Being openly Christian without being "a nutter" means being open to debate. 557</page><page sequence="4">Matthew Engelke | God's Agents : Biblical Publicity in Contemporary England The Bible Advocacy Team then is the public relations group for God. They do not speak for him, rather they want to find opportunities for him to speak to and through others. Maintaining their commitment to the Bible Society's promise to publish the Bible "without note or comment" means that the team must avoid interpreting the Bible while still arguing for its relevance to contemporary English citizens. But as Engelke asks, "[h]ow could the Bible advocates hope to capture the attention of any public by proclaiming, 'We're here to offer no comment'?" (15). Engelke focuses on two main answers to this question that the Bible Advocacy Team has developed so far. The first is through the promotion of what Engelke terms "ambient faith," in which the team produced a num- ber of different projects aimed at making the Bible part of the background noise of contemporary life. Based upon polling data that suggests Britons are willing to identify as "spiritual," if not "religious" (a distinction that is ulti- mately Protestant in origin, in which insitutionality and organization is seen to hinder one's access to other realms of being), a team member commis- sioned a "spiritual" art installation in a shopping arcade in the northern city of Swindon. Kites that were shaped like vaguely anthropomorphic angels sailed above shoppers on spending binges just prior to Christmas. As subtle hints of another plane of meaning, the angels in Swindon stand in stark contrast to the acerbic battles in the "war on Christmas" fought each year in the US and the United Kingdom. Rather than the enormous nativity scenes that are often placed on public lands by Christians, aggressively insisting that the public must put the "Christ" back in "Christmas," the an- gels in Swindon gently invited viewers to form a plurality of interpretations. Bible Advocacy Team members also cultivate an ambient faith in their efforts to get people out into bars and coffee shops for group Bible study sessions. Armed with coffee and sandwiches, these study sessions are for the participants about "doing God" in public, giving people the space to talk about God without being embarrassed. It is not knocking on doors and asking if homeowners have given their lives to Christ, but simply sit- ting within hearing-distance of secular others and having a conversation about a certain passage of the Bible. Ambient faith gently tugs at the public/private distinction without trying to knock it down, suggesting that people can be passively affected simply by catching snippets of debate about Pauline concepts of love. Ambient faith also allows Christians to proclaim their broad commitment to the principles of secular Britain by "doing God" even as they do consumerism. In another project, the Bible 558</page><page sequence="5">COURTNEY HANDMAN Society put up subtly Bible-themed advertisements across Manchester, including in bars where the average patron was invited to think about the Bible as he or she sipped on a pint. Engelke has something of a rhetorical tic that compels him to mention whatever beverage or food item one of his interlocutors is consuming. He notes how each team member grips his or her lattes, bacon sandwiches, and institutional catering foods as a signal of their placement within the here-and-now. These are not other-worldly zealots focused on the end, but pragmatic players hoping for incremental advances of the Bible into contemporary discourse. The second major tactic of biblical publicity that Engelke analyzes is the work of the Bible Society's think tank, Theos. While the ethic of offering no comment seems at least possible with ambient faith, it is a more difficult task when projects include book-length reports and major public debates. How can you have no comment for 100 pages at a time? And yet it is not impossible. Advocating for the legitimate role of religion in contemporary England is a tall order when celebrity atheists like Richard Dawkins and the late Christopher Hitchens command large audiences to proclaim that religion is at best the last bastion of scoundrels, at worst an outmoded evolutionary relic that actively suppresses human freedom. The reports and other work of Theos have the most direct comment not on the Bible but on the nature of the public sphere as a secular in- stitution, and it is here that the Bible Society appears to have a unique take on Habermas' (1 989) idealized institution of civil engagement. Theos's problem with the public sphere differs from the other critiques that have been more commonplace in social science writing. Calhoun (1992) and Benhabib (1 992), along with many others at this point, noted that the public sphere was never the equalizing space that Habermas suggested. Women, minorities, and the poor never had a seat at the table where issues were debated. One response to this realization was to create the institutional conditions for a more diverse constituency. Identitarian political projects work to create not only a voice from a specific perspective, but also a platform from which to make that voice audible. More radical responses to what is sometimes called "later liberalism" are articulated by people like Elizabeth Povinelli (2001 ), who suggests that instead of insisting on finding space at the table, radical alterity is a project fighting against incorporation into the public sphere. In this view, the radical other trades the violence of incorporation for the violence of exclusion. Politics is practiced by refusing to have a voice. 559</page><page sequence="6">Matthew Engelke | God's Agents: Biblical Publicity in Contemporary England In the case of Theos and the Bible Society more generally, the project of political voicing is more complicated. The project is not to say "We are Christians and this is how we see things as Christians," nor is it "We are Christian and refuse to engage in secular society," but rather "Would you like to speak here as a Christian?" In other words, they are not laying out a particular set of claims but an invitation to others to speak. It is in this sense that Theos can be seen as having a connection to its evangelical parent organization, albeit in a highly secular liberal mode. Outside of a relatively small circle of politicians and policy makers who are the main- stays of Theos events, there are seemingly very few Christians attempting to "do God" in public. Bible Advocacy Team members have to actively try to recruit people to take up the mantle of the Christian citizen while Theos members work to make it possible for those Christian citizens to not be laughed off the stage. As Engelke argues, Bible Advocacy has largely taken on the assump- tions of secular liberalism. Team members never insist, cajole, or coerce. They "provoke" conversation and debate, making themselves "available" as resources. These are the key terms of individualizing secularism, where autonomy and freedom must be maintained at all costs. (Incidentally, they are also the key terms at my two-year-old daughter's preschool, which promises to help promote independence and autonomy through non- directed play: teachers are "available" to set up "provocations" that the children can take up or not. How can the terms of liberal secularism be challenged when socialization to them begins so early?) This is the second book that Engelke has written about Christians in which the Bible is strangely absent. In his first book, The Problem of Presence (2007), Engelke examined the ultra-Protestant practices of Apostolic Christians in Zimbabwe who are known for not reading the Bible in favor of a dematerialized "live and direct" relationship with God. Engelke transitioned to a study of the Bible Society for his next project in order to examine a group that seems to orient entirely around the written word. And yet, he ended up in an ethnographic setting in which the Bible is large- ly off stage. This is not a coincidence, though. It suggests that Christianity is deeply concerned with the possibilities and pragmatics of communi- cation regardless of one's particular sense of the Bible's importance or lack thereof. The form of that communication may vary given historical conditions, but the question of how Christian communication occurs is 560</page><page sequence="7">COURTNEY HANDMAN often going to be a high priority. In that sense, God's Agents can be read as something of a sequel to Engelke's first book, no matter how different contemporary England may seem to be in comparison with Zimbabwe. â  References: Benhabib, Seyla. 1992.
