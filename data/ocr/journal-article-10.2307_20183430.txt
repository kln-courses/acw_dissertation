Darwin, 2. Edificio Biolog?a, Universidad Aut?noma de Madrid 28049, Madrid, Spain Abstract: Recognition of the need to include economic criteria in the conservation policy decision-making process has encouraged the use of economic-valuation techniques. Nevertheless, whether it is possible to ac curately assign economic values to biodiversity and if so what these values really represent is being debated. We reviewed 60 recent papers on economic valuation of biodiversity and carried out a meta-analysis of these studies to determine what factors affect willingness to pay for biodiversity conservation. We analyzed the internal variables of the contingent-valuation method (measure of benefits, vehicle of payment, elicita tion format, or timing of payment) and anthropomorphic, anthropocentric and scientific factors. Funding allocation mostly favored the conservation of species with anthropomorphic and anthropocentric charac teristics instead of considering scientific factors. We recommend researchers and policy makers contemplate economic valuations of biodiversity carefully, considering the inherent biases of the contingent-valuation method and the anthropomorphic and anthropocentric factors resulting from the public's attitude toward species. Because of the increasing trend of including economic considerations in conservation practices, we suggest that in the future interdisciplinary teams of ecologists, economists, and social scientists collaborate and conduct comparative analyses, such as we have done here. Use of the contingent-valuation method in biodiversity conservation policies can provide useful information about alternative conservation strategies if questionnaires are carefully constructed, respondents are sufficiently informed, and the underlying factors that influence willingness to pay are identified.

For instance, environmental eco nomics can inform conservation biologists and policy makers about why species are endangered, the oppor tunity costs of protection activities, and the economic incentives for conservation (Shogren et al. 1999). Scien tists argue that economic criteria need to be a part of the design and implementation of conservation policies (MEA 2005). Similarly, many institutional programs, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) or the Natural Resource Management program (OECD 2002), recognize the importance of understanding the economic value of biodiversity for conservation policy making. Economic valuation techniques have recently moved from scientific forums to management practices in the design of sys tems that pay landowners for ecosystem services (pay ments for environmental services [PES]). For example, the World Bank is developing PES schemes based on economic-valuation techniques in several countries of Central and South America and Africa. Among the economic-valuation techniques, the contingent-valuation method has been used widely to measure the economic value of species. The procedure is based on a hypothetical market in which people are asked through questionnaires to express their maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for the protection of biodiver sity (Loomis &amp; White 1996). Although contingent valua tion has been commonly used in policy-related research, there are numerous critiques in the literature that con cern their content and questionnaire design and the va lidity and reliability of their results (Mitchell &amp; Carson 1989; Venkatachalam 2004). It is necessary to identify and measure the inherent biases of contingent-valuation studies in order to reduce internal inconsistency (White et al. 2001). Debate continues on the factors, from anthropomor phic to scientific, that affect WTP for biodiversity con servation (e.g., Tisdell et al. 2007). Other factors, such as species' usefulness to humans, may also play important roles in detenriining WTP for biodiversity conservation. Our objectives here were to report and analyze the underlying factors that explain the economic values of species; obtain evidence about the relationship between human attitudes to animals and the WTP for conservation; generate useful criteria to incorporate economic values in conservation policies, and explore the crucial need for interdisciplinary research teams. Methods Data Collection To address the controversies surrounding the economic valuation of biodiversity, we performed an extensive meta-analysis of contingent-valuation studies. We used the following criteria to select studies for inclusion in the analysis. First, studies had to be published in peer reviewed journals to avoid unknown and inaccessible studies. Nevertheless, we included gray literature if it was included in some of the studies published in the peer reviewed literature (Hageman 1985; King et al. 1988; Duffield, unpublished [1991], 1992; Duffield et al. 1993; Tanguay et al. 1993, 1995; Brown et al. 1994). Sec ond, because some studies reported multiple estimates of WTP, we used the best estimation if it was identi fied by the authors; otherwise, we averaged their WTP, unless the variation in estimated values was related to our explanatory variables. All WTP estimates were con verted to 2005 U.S. dollar values (Consumer Price Index, http://www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm). Third, the studies included in the analysis determine WTP for single species, instead of biodiversity in general terms. Data Analysis To examine financial support for biodiversity conserva tion, we considered variables that economic-valuation theory suggests are important and variables that explain human attitudes toward biodiversity (Table 1). Contingent-valuation surveys are context-dependent, that is, the values estimated are subject to various as pects of the questionnaire design. Although some ele ments of the survey are expected to be neutral (e.g., questions about family size should not influence an in dividual's response to the WTP question), others have a significant influence on a respondents' valuation (Bate man et al. 2002), such as the measure of benefits, vehicle of payment, how information was gathered (elicitation method), and timing of payment (Table 1).

(2004). bCR, critically endangered; EN, endangered; VU, vulnerable; NR, near threatened; LC, least concern. We classified the types of benefit measures as WTP to avoid a loss, WTP to secure a gain, and WTP to invest in a biodiversity plan. Usually the estimates from contingent valuation studies are derived from either WTP to avoid loss of a species (e.g., amount one is willing to pay to pre vent a species from going extinct) or WTP for a proposed gain in numbers (e.g., amount one is willing to pay to im prove the chance of survival of a species by 50-99%). Another common measure of WTP is the amount a per son is willing to pay to a conservation plan for a species. We classified payment vehicles as voluntary or coer cive. Coercive payments included taxes, fees, or charges. Voluntary payments were donations or gifts (Bateman et al. 2002). Conservation Biology Volume 22, No. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="4">Mart?n-L?pez et al. 627 Stated-preference (elicitation) methods differed in how much information they conveyed to and collected from respondents (Bateman et al. 2002). The open-ended stated-preference format asked respondents what maxi mum amount they would be willing to pay for species conservation. The payment-card formats contained a range of values from which the individuals chose their maximum WTP. Dichotomous-choice elicitation meth ods required respondents to answer yes or no when asked if they were willing to pay a given amount for species conservation. In previous approaches, researchers as sumed respondents had no uncertainty regarding their preferences. Nevertheless, allowing only yes-or-no an swers can result in respondents who are uncertain an swering yes in support of biodiversity conservation pro grams (Brown et al. 1996). To allow for respondents' uncertainty, Welsh and Bishop (1993) developed the multiple-bounded approach, which contains elements of both the payment card and dichotomous-choice formats. As for the payment-card format, respondents were pre sented with an ordered sequence of WTP amounts, but rather than circling a single value, the respondents were given a multiple-choice response option, including "defi nitely yes," "probably yes," "unsure," "probably no," and "definitely no" to each amount presented. Accordingly, we classified the elicitation questions into open-ended, payment-card, dichotomous-choice, and multiple-choice formats. Comparisons of different contingent-valuation studies indicate there were systematic differences between val ues elicited with continuous (open-ended and payment card) and discrete choice (dichotomous and multiple choice) formats (Brown et al. 1996). In general, values collected with discrete-choice formats exceed values col lected with open-ended (Reaves et al. 1999) or payment card formats (Welsh &amp; Poe 1998). For that reason we also classified the elicitation formats into continuous and discrete-choice formats. For timing of payment some researchers asked respon dents to express their WTP as an annual amount, whereas others used a single lump sum payment. The expected ef fect was that a one-time payment would be larger than an annual payment stretched over time into the immediate future. Among variables that can explain social preferences, we studied 3 factors: (1) anthropomorphic, associated with the likeability and similarity of species to humans, (2) anthropocentric, related to the usefulness of species, and (3) scientific, which determine whether scientific knowledge influences estimates of WTP (Table 1). The scientific literature indicates that conservation support is positively related to the perceived attractive ness of nonhuman species, which usually is an exten sion of human similarity (i.e., the similarity principle) (Pious 1993; Gunnthorsdottir 2001). Perceived similar ity between humans and nonhuman species is related to the phylogenetic level (Eddy et al. 1993) and to physi cal characteristics such as length, weight, and eye size (Herzog &amp; Burghardt 1988). To study the effect of phylo genetic level, we classified species into mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, and invertebrates. These categories some times cause some species to be perceived as charismatic fauna. Moreover, usually the charismatic species are re lated to different ecosystems (e.g., Asian elephant [Ele phas maximus] with Indian forests, giant panda [Ail uropoda melanoleuca] with Chinese bamboo forests, and giraffes [Giraffa camelopardalis] with African sa vannahs). For that reason we studied the effect of the ecosystem on WTP. We classified the ecosystems ac cording to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2003). Because many fish species are anadromous, we also included marine-inland water as an ecosystem type (Table 1). In addition, individuals can favor conservation of those species with anthropocentric characteristics (DeKay &amp; McClelland 1996; Martin-Lopez et al. 2007). In general, species useful to humans are positively related to WTP, and those that produce economic damages are nega tively related to WTP estimates. To study in detail the social role of species, we categorized them as species that (1) generate crop damages, (2) generate economic loss by pr?dation on cattle, (3) are hunted or fished for recreation, and (4) are a nonconsumptive tourism resource. Nevertheless, many wild species are perceived as hav ing opposing attributes; sometimes they are considered pests and other times they are considered valuable assets. For instance, elephants are widely considered a pest by local people in rural regions (Bandara &amp; Tisdell 2003); on the other hand, elephants attract tourism in protected ar eas (Wilkie &amp; Carpenter 1999). The dual character of the elephant as both agricultural pest and valuable economic asset reflects the difficulty in classifying it as a useful or economically negative species. Similarly, humans have positive attitudes toward socially controversial animals in the context of abstract existence values, but these atti tudes quickly become negative when the presence of the species is associated with economic costs in their imme diate surroundings (Kaltenborn et al. 2006). This means visitors have a higher WTP than local people (Loomis &amp; Larson 1994; Loomis &amp; White 1996). For that reason we studied the WTP estimates for visitor and for resident respondents. Finally, any preservation decision is likely to con sider scientific knowledge about the species. We stud ied the relationship between WTP and degree of endan germent, in terms of 2 variables: change in population size of a species proposed in the contingent-valuation questionnaire and the endangerment categories of the IUCN (World Conservation Union) Red List. To study the Conservation Biology Volume 22, No. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="5">628 Economie Valuation of Biodiversity effect of IUCN categories, we classified the species in the studies we examined as critically endangered (CR), en dangered (EN), vulnerable (VU), near threatened (NR), least concern (LC) (IUCN 2006), or not endangered. Other scientific variables that can influence WTP are knowledge of the ecological role of species and whether the species is endemic. To test the effect of these variables on WTP values for species conservation, we used different statistical analy ses. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the dis tribution of contingent-valuation studies by allocation of study, taxonomic group, and ecosystem. To test the in dividual effect of nominal and dummy variables on WTP, we used nonparametric statistics (Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis). When the Kruskal-Wallis test achieved 90% significance, we used Dunn's multiple comparison posttest to compare WTP estimates of one group with another. We also used correlation and simple regression analyses to test the effect of continuous variables on WTP. To obtain evidence about the relationship between hu man attitudes toward animals and WTP, we examined the joint effect of anthropomorphic, anthropocentric, and scientific variables through multivariate regression analysis. Here, we used only those variables for which data were available for all the species we examined. To improve the model we expressed the frequency of pay ment as a dichotomous variable (lump sum). The depen dent variable was the natural log of WTP. Results Contingent Valuation of Biodiversity The number of selected studies was 60 (Table 2). The dis tribution of valuations by place indicated that 65% of the economic-valuation studies were localized in the United States, 15% in Europe, 8% in Australia, 6% in Canada, and 6% in Sri Lanka. The dominance of the United States is due in part to the history of economic valuation there (Gen 2004). The final data set included 50 species distributed among mammals (56%), birds (20%), reptiles (2%), fishes (20%), and invertebrates (2%). Nevertheless, the studies dedicated to these groups manifested a taxonomic bias because 64% of studies focused on mammals, 23% on birds, and only 1% on reptiles and crustaceans (Table 2). Similarly, the economic-valuation research showed preference for studying species that live in marine and forest ecosystems; these were 40% and 33% of studies, respectively. In contrast, species that live in dryland and urban-cultivated ecosystems were studied in only 4% and 1% of cases, respectively. Table 2. Summary of economic values of species.

Effect of Study Design on the Economic Value of Species WTP differed significantly with the choice of benefit mea sured in the hypothetical market, in which WTP to secure a gain generated the highest values and WTP to biodiver sity plan resulted in the lowest values. Willingness to pay was significantly higher for coercive payments than voluntary payments. Similarly, discrete-choice elicitation formats generated significantly higher values than con tinuous formats. Willingness to pay for biodiversity con servation was significantly greater for one-time payments than for annual payments (Table 3). Effect of Anthropomorphic, Anthropocentric, and Scientific Factors on WTP Nonparametric analysis demonstrated that the effect of the anthropomorphic and anthropocentric factors on WTP was higher than scientific factors (Table 4). All phys ical variables (length, weight, and eye size) had a positive and significant effect on WTP. Willingness to pay did not differ among taxonomic groups or ecosystems. Nev ertheless, the effect of the ecosystem on WTP differed by taxonomic group (mammals and fishes). The Dunn's multiple comparisons test for WTP of mammal species distinguished 3 statistically different ecosystem groups: marine, forest or mountain, and inland waters and dry lands. In addition, WTP for fish differed significantly be tween continental and marine or anadromous species (Table 4). Although whether a species is useful did not have an effect on WTP, WTP differed significantly between those species that have a negative economic impact and those that do not (Table 4). When we compared the mean WTP for species conservation among the categories of (1) species that generate crop damage ($6.41), (2) species that cause damage to cattle ($21.21), (3) species that are a fishing or hunting resource ($54.60), and (4) species that are a nonconsumptive tourist resource ($44.57), we found significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis, x2 = 5.42, df = 3,p = 0.10). Dunn's test also showed significant dif ferences (p &lt; 0.01) between species that cause economic loss and those that are exploited for recreation. Although for the global data set the mean WTP was higher for visitors than for residents, there were no sig nificant effects. Nevertheless, visitor and resident WTP for carnivore conservation differed significantly (Mann Whitney, U = 36; z = -2.68, p = 0.007). Carnivores were usually valued higher by visitors ($147.80) than by residents ($62.21). The level of endangerment had an effect on the pub lic's decision to invest in biodiversity conservation when it was stated in the questionnaire in terms of change in a species' population size (Fig. 1). There was an expo nential relation (y = 10.88e?moSx, R2 = 84.7%, n = 55) between the change in population size and WTP. Never theless, when we analyzed the effect of the degree of en dangerment on the basis of IUCN categories, there were no significant differences. Ecological role and endemism variables did not significantly influence WTP. Allocation of Funds for Biodiversity Conservation Because of the strong correlations between length of an animal and eye size (Spearman's rho = 0.794,p &lt; 0.0001) and between weight and eye size (Spearman's rho = 0.914, p &lt; 0.0001), we used only the eye-size variable as an indicator of the anthropomorphic effect because it was the most significant (Table 4). Forty-six percent and 40% of the variation in WTP was explained by the explanatory variables in the full and re duced model, respectively (Table 5). The effect of eye size was positive and significant at the 10% level. The taxonomic-class dummies had the expected effect on WTP: higher forms of life were assigned higher economic values by the respondents.

Fishes presented only a significant neg ative effect in the reduced model. In addition, WTP for marine species was statistically greater than for species that live in continental ecosystems. In the case of anthropocentric criteria, although a species' usefulness did not have an effect on WTP, the economic impact of species was significantly negatively related to WTP. Scientific criteria such as the degree of endangerment measured by the IUCN categories and a species' ecological role did not have a significant effect on WTP. Finally, one-time payments were considered more favorably than annual payments.

Nevertheless, the economic valuation of biodiversity is affected not only by the inherent variables of contin gent valuation (measurement of benefits, payment vehi cle, elicitation format, or timing of payment) but also by the public's attitudes toward biodiversity. Therefore, for effective conservation management, apart from knowl edge of the economic value that people assign to bio diversity conservation, it is also important to determine the underlying factors influencing WTP for biodiversity conservation. Willingness to pay for species conservation is strongly determined by human attitudes toward these species. People's attitudes toward animals are generally based on 2 distinct motivational considerations: affect, rep resenting people's affective responses to animals, and utility, representing people's perceptions of animals' in strumental value (Serpell 2004). People's affective re sponses toward species are influenced by anthropomor phic (Kellert &amp; Berry 1980; Eddy et al. 1993; Pious 1993) and anthropocentric variables (Serpell 1986; Herzog &amp; Burghardt 1988). On one hand, species that are phylo genetically close and physically similar to humans are likely to attract more conservation support than dissim ilar species (Gunnthorsdottir 2001; White et al. 2001; Martin-Lopez et al. 2007). On the other hand, species perceived as useful or beneficial to humans are regarded more positively than those perceived as useless or detri mental (DeKay &amp; McClelland 1996; Martin-Lopez et al. 2007). In contrast to previous studies (e.g., DeKay &amp; McClel land 1996), we found phylogeny did not explain well WTP for biodiversity conservation. This might be partly due to the combination of species included in each tax onomic class (Tisdell et al. 2005?z). For example, sup port for turtle species may be almost as strong as for some birds and mammals, although on the whole there is stronger support for the latter (Tisdell et al. 2006). Similarly, Stanley (2005) found considerable support for the conservation of the Riverside fairy shrimp (Strepto cephalus wootoni), even though it is an invertebrate (Tisdell et al. 2005?z). Nonetheless, because the eco nomic valuation of Riverside fairy shrimp constitutes the only study of a crustacean, Stanley's results may not be Table 5.

On the other hand, as the similarity prin ciple suggests, our reduced regression analysis showed that fish have a significant negative effect on WTP. Nev ertheless, the effect of fish on WTP is ambiguous be cause salmoniform species have an important cultural and recreational value in the Pacific Northwest (U.S.A.) (Loomis &amp; White 1996). The higher amounts of WTP for anadromous fishes may apply to all recreational fish eries. Thus, species that are hunting or fishing resources were the ones most valued by the public. In addition, among anthropocentric variables, a key variable deter mining WTP for biodiversity conservation was the eco nomic damage caused by species, which was clearly and negatively related to WTP. With regard to scientific criteria, our results revealed that respondents' previous knowledge of changes in species population size was the only significant variable in determining economic value. The fact that informa tion regarding endangerment status influences allocation of funding for biodiversity conservation is supported by the results of other experimental studies (e.g., Fredman 1995; Tkac 1998; Bandara &amp; Tisdell 2005; Tisdell &amp; Wil son 2006). Accordingly, endangered species are liable to be greatly disadvantaged in competing for conservation funds when the public is poorly informed about them (Tisdell &amp; Wilson 2006). Accurate information on conser vation status of species can be important for improving social decisions regarding biodiversity conservation. One of the most obvious examples of the importance of pub lic information in biodiversity conservation is the envi ronmental campaigns developed to prevent commercial whaling and sealing. Through these campaigns, whales and seals acquired an iconic value for the conservation movement in the 1970s (Corkeron 2004). To provide useful and reliable information to policy makers about biodiversity conservation, it seems appro priate to pay great attention to the underlying anthro pomorphic and anthropocentric factors of species, par ticularly in those cases when the contingent-valuation surveys do not provide knowledge of the scientific issues concerning species. Understanding human attitudes to ward biodiversity is essential to the work of correcting the inherent bias associated with species valuation. To understand the underlying motives behind WTP for biodi versity conservation, contingent-valuation studies should be improved through the incorporation of other scien tific disciplines, such as environmental psychology or hu man ecology. Therefore, conservation decision-making processes call for interdisciplinary knowledge in which conservation biologists and economists collaborate with anthropologists and psychologists (Mascia et al. 2003; Saunders et al. 2006). Implementing contingent valua tion for biodiversity is a difficult task because the public has a low level of understanding of what biodiversity is and why it matters (Christie et al. 2006). Providing accurate information about endangerment level, popula tion status, geographical range, and the ecological role of species can increase the reliability of the contingent valuation method. Consequently, use of the contingent-valuation method in biodiversity conservation policies can provide useful information about alternative conservation strategies if questionnaires are carefully constructed, respondents are sufficiently informed, and the underlying factors that in fluence willingness to pay are identified.
