BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OF THE LABORATORY MOUSE UNDER AUDITORY STRESS BY HUBERT FRINGS, MABLE FRINGS, AND ALAN KIVERT There has been a rather large amount of work done on running fits and seizures in rats, following the original report by Maier (1939), and various mechanisms have been proposed to explain these types of "abnormal" behavior. Much less has been done on mice, however. The fact that seizures occur in mice was first reported by Dice (1935) and later studied by Watson (1939) for the deer mouse, Peromyscus. Recently, Chance and Yaxley (1949) have analyzed the behavior sequences in this genus during running fits and seizures. In laboratory stocks of the house mouse the occurrence of audiogenic seizures was first reported in a preliminary way by Mirsky et al. (1943) and was later studied by Hall (1947). The behavior, in this case, was induced by sub- jecting a mouse in a metal washtub to the sound of an electric bell fastened to the tub. Later, Ginsburg et al. (1947, 1949, 1950), Fuller (1950), and Vicari (1947, 1948a and b, 1949, 1950) published brief abstracts of work using various inbred strains of the house mouse in this type of apparatus. Witt and Hall (1949), in a genetic study of seizures in two strains of mice, reported that mice of the dba strain were seizure-susceptible while C-57 strain mice were seizure-resistant. Study of crosses between the two strains led them to conclude that the occurrence of seizures at 30 days of age was brought about by a single dominant gene, pres- ent in the dba, with the recessive allele homozygous in the C-57's. A few deficiencies in all these papers on house mice led to the present study. First, there has not been an adequate description of the pre-running behavior of the mice or of the running fits and seizures themselves, comparable with that of Chance and Yaxley (1949) for Peromyscus. The present paper attempts a detailed description of the behavior of mice subjected to relatively intense audi- tory stimulation. Second, the stimuli used by the previous workers were complex and nearly unreproducible. Not only were the mice in a tub to which a bell was attached subjected to sound, they were also receiving vibrations through the feet. If reproducible results are to be obtained, it is vital that the frequencies and intensities of sound used in studies of seizures in rodents be known exactly. Our 60 Vol. 32, No. 1</page><page sequence="2">Feb., 1951 FRINGS, FRINGS, AND KIVERT-MOUSE BEHAVIOR first problem, therefore, was the designing of a piece of apparatus which would allow control of the stimuli used for the induction of seizures. Third, except for the reports (only abstracts) of Ginsburg et al., Fuller, and Vicari, the tests on house mice have been made over a very limited time of the life-30-40 days of age. The time of treatment should be extended into the earlier days of life to discover the age at which seizures first appear, as well as into the later life to discover the time when seizures cease, if at all. Only the first part of this problem, extending into earlier days of life, is reported here, for, besides making a study of the occurrence and pattern of seizures, we also had afoot an attempt to pro- duce mice of known susceptibility to running fits, and kept our mice, after 50 days of age, for breeding. Fourth, except for the use of a few inbred strains of mice no attempt has been made to standardize stocks for studies of seizures. It is important, if comparative results are to be obtained in studies on seizures, that animals of known genetic background with respect to seizures be used. This phase of our work is still in progress. The work reported herein was financed in part by the U. S. Air Force, Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, under Contract No. AF-33(038)-786, and the John G. Vogel Memorial Research Fund. We are indebted to Mr. N. Stein, of the Physics Department, for aid in measur- ing the sound pressures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals used and general methods of maintenance.-Individuals of three strains of mice were used in this study-mongrel "Swiss" Albino, obtained from a commercial animal dealer; dba (Subline 1), obtained from the Jackson Memorial Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine; and C-57 black (Subline 6), likewise obtained from the Jackson Memorial Laboratory. These animals were paired immediately upon receipt, when they were all about 40-50 days of age, and their offspring were used in the experiments. The animals were kept in a standard mouse cage made of galvanized iron, with solid bottom, fitted with a lid of i-inch-mesh hardware cloth. The bottom of the cage was filled to a depth of about one inch with sawdust to absorb wastes. These were kept in a laboratory in which temperature, humidity, and light were allowed to vary with the outside early summer conditions. Food and water were con- stantly available. The food was a commercial mouse diet. Since it has been shown that nutritional deficiencies may affect the incidence of seizures in rats, a pre- liminary study of the possible effects of this diet on seizures in mice was made by supplementing the diet of half of the C-57 animals with dog biscuit. So far as could be determined, the animals were free from diseases or parasites, with the possible exception of mites, which occur widely in small numbers on labora- tory mice. The albino mice produced significantly larger litters than the other two strains, and, because of better parental care, brought through more young to testing age. The dba strain had the smallest litters and brought through to testing age only about two-thirds of the mice born. The C-57 mice had litters of intermediate 61</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY size and, with excellent parental care, brought through almost all the young to testing age. The albinos and C-57's are, therefore, preferable to dba's as experi- mental animals, because of the larger numbers for testing afforded per breeding pair. The mice were handled as little as possible between and during the tests. It seems almost certain that the amount and nature of handling would affect the induction of seizures in the mice, and an effort was made, therefore, to duplicate the handling procedure for all the mice tested. Between tests, the animals were generally undisturbed. The mouse cages and water bottles were cleaned twice each week, care being taken to disturb the mice as little as possible. For purposes of identification, the mice were marked with an alcoholic solu- tion of picric acid, using marks on different parts of the body to represent the numbers of the animals. In general, the male mice were left with the females with litters, and both mice took care of the young. The young were tested from 15-50 days of age, and they were removed from their parents at 30 days of age. At this age, almost all of the mice had been weaned. Apparatus.-The sound source used in these experiments was a Western Elec- tric Microphone (Type 633-A), actuated by a Hewlett-Packard audio-oscillator (Type 200-A), with a Raytheon pulse transformer (Type WX-5137) in series with the microphone to match the impedance of the external and internal circuits. The sound was turned off and on by a switch in the external circuit. For testing, the mice were imprisoned in a cage, 15 cm. long, 10 cm. high, and 10 cm. wide, made of 4-inch-mesh hardware cloth. This cage was placed so that the microphone, which was on a platform 2.5 cm. above the level of the floor of the cage, was 5 cm. from the cage, sending a sound beam down the long axis of the cage. In the first experiments, two frequencies were used: 10 kc./sec. and 20 kc./sec., the first being sonic, the second ultra-sonic, so far as man is concerned. Both are sonic for mice, but there were fewer seizures at 20 kc./sec. than at 10 kc./sec. Both of these were delivered to the microphone at the maximum intensity of the oscillator. As a result of the response characteristics of the microphone, how- ever, the actual intensity of sound produced at 20 kc./sec. was 10 to 20 db. below that produced at 10 kc./sec. It soon became apparent that the lower intensity at the higher frequency-for which no remedy was found with the present ap- paratus-was probably the cause of the difference in incidence of seizures be- tween the two frequencies. Since this was not intended to be a study of frequency and intensity variables in the seizure pattern, the use of the higher frequency was discontinued. In actual numbers, 10 Albinos out of a total of 37 used and 20 dba's out of a total of 40 used were the only mice tested at 20 kc./sec. In a preliminary study on the effect of frequency on the evocation of seizures in dba mice, McGrael (1949) has shown that the maximum number of seizures is induced at 8-12 kc./sec., when he tested mice at 2-20 kc./sec. in 2 kc. steps, all at 102 db. sound pressure. For this reason, 10 kc./sec. was selected. In view of his results, it may be that the much smaller number of seizures induced at 20 kc./sec. may have been due to the frequency, but we cannot conclude defi- nitely on this point. 62 Vol. 32, No. I</page><page sequence="4">Feb., 1951 FRINGS, FRINGS, AND KIVERT-MOUSE BEHAVIOR The sound pressures inside the testing cage were measured by means of a calibrated system consisting of a Western Electric 640-AA microphone, Sanborn preamplifier, and Ballantine Model 220 voltmeter. This was accurate to within 4t0.5 db. The average sound pressure (in db. re 10-16 watts/sq. cm.) in the cage was 110 db.; the range was from 120 db. nearest the transducer to 105 db. at the far corner of the cage. Using a metal washtub arranged like that used in the previously reported work-so far as such an arrangement can be duplicated-the sound levels in the tub were found to be 102:42 db. at the periphery and 95i2 db. at the center. Thus, so far as sound pressure itself is concerned, the total sound pressure in our apparatus compares favorably with that in the tub. To minimize discomfort to the experimenter, the cage and microphone were enclosed in a small anechoic chamber (61 cm. long, 31 cm. wide, and 31 cm. high, outside dimensions) made of plywood. This was lined with two layers of non- absorbent cotton covered with a layer of cheese cloth. The inside dimensions of this chamber were 58 x 23 x 20 cm. Access to the chamber was through a door at one end. The microphone was inserted through a small door in the end of the box opposite the large door. The cage was placed in the middle of the anechoic chamber (P1. I). Directly above the cage there was a window (10 x 10 cm.) covered with a layer of celluloid, beneath which the cotton lining of the chamber was partly removed. Through this window, light from a small lamp was admitted. Another window in the side of the box (18 x 18 cm.), made of two layers of cellu- loid with an air space between, afforded the experimenter a clear view of the cage. Experimental procedures.-The routine followed in testing a mouse for suscepti- bility to seizures was as follows. The mouse was placed in the testing cage and the cage placed in the anechoic chamber. The mouse was given a period of about a half minute to accustom itself to the cage, and its reactions during the pre- testing period were recorded. The sound was then turned on. The immediate reaction of the mouse to the sound was observed, and the behavior of the mouse during the treatment was followed continuously, timing by means of a stop watch, and recorded. If the animal did not have a seizure, the sound was kept on for 90 seconds. If the animal did have a seizure, the sound was turned off just as soon as the mouse started to run. The latter procedure saved the mice for further testing and for breeding. The seizures ranged in severity from merely stopping in some unusual position to complete convulsions, followed by death. In all cases in which the animal recovered following a seizure the time for re- covery was observed and recorded. The animal was designated as recovered when it had returned to normal positions or movements in the cage. Following the test, the mouse was returned to the maintenance cage. Each mouse was tested twice per day during the week, with only one test on Saturday and usually none on Sunday. If, however, the animal was at such an age that it was suspected that its first seizure would occur on Sunday, it was tested. The tests were made in the morning and in the afternoon. There were about four hours between morning and afternoon tests and, thus, about 20 hours between the afternoon test of one day and the morning test of the day following. 63</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY Records of the actions of the mice were taken in an abbreviated code, allow- ing the observer to record the events as they happened. Preliminary experimen- tation revealed that there were certain typical behavior patterns before and during testing, and single letter symbols for these were used. Where unusual behavior patterns turned up, they were easily noted and inserted in the records in the form of notes. The record sheets were lined to represent 5-second intervals over the testing period, and usually these spaces sufficed. The following numbers of mice and tests were made in this study: Albino- offspring from five pairs of parents, totalling 37 (17d c and 20 9 9 ) individuals in 1950 tests, with 448 seizures; dba's-offspring from nine pairs of parents, totalling 40 (20c6 c and 20 9 9) individuals, in 1365 tests, with 307 seizures; C-57's-offspring from six pairs of parents, totalling 53 (24cd ci' and 29 9 ) in- dividuals, in 2695 tests, with 466 seizures. Thus a total of 130 mice (61c c6 and 69 9 9 ) was used in 6010 tests, with 1221 seizures. RESULTS Behavior patterns of mice before and during sound treatment.-The pre-treatment behavior of a mouse in the treatment cage depended chiefly upon its age and its previous experiences in the cage. Naturally, there were wide individual varia- tions in behavior patterns among the mice, but these were all generally classi- fiable under certain typical types of behavior. If the mouse were young-between 15 and 18 days of age-the most usual pre-treatment behavior was either a simple exploration of or a quiet resting position in the cage. The quiet state was usually assumed in a corner, with the animal sitting relaxed, often with the eyes closed. Exploration of the cage was of various types. Most of the animals moved about without making any effort to escape. A few moved about quietly, stopping occasionally to poke the nose out through the sides of the cage or even to bite at it. A few climbed the sides of the cage, or alternated climbing with moving about on the floor. Climbing, too, was occasionally accompanied by attempts to escape, though this type of be- havior was very rare. Some mice, instead of either sitting quietly or moving about, would clean the fur in the normal fashion, using the forepaws for facial cleaning and the tongue for the body. In general, the behavior was exactly like that observed whenever young mice are removed from their home cage and placed in a strange situation. If the mice were older-18-50 days of age-the pattern was a little different. Generally they exhibited active movements about the cage, some mice alternat- ing these movements with climbing of the sides, and some cleaning normally, all usually carried out in an unhurried fashion. If, however, the mouse had a long record of previous seizures in the cage, the behavior was usually markedly altered. In this case, the mouse either moved or ran about vigorously, trying to escape, or cringed in a corer, as if expecting something to happen. If the last sounds anthropomorphic, it is not meant to be, it merely describes most accu- rately the tense, expectant, crouching attitude of the mouse. The latter pat- tern was typical of mice which had had violent seizures, though some of them 64 Vol. 32, No. 1</page><page sequence="6">Feb., 1951 FRINGS, FRINGS, AND KIVERT-MOUSE BEHAVIOR also exhibited the active type of behavior. There would seem to be good evi- dence that the mice learned to fear the experimental situation, after being subjected to repeated seizures. When the sound was turned on, the immediate reaction was a startle. This varied in intensity from a mere drawing in of the head, as if the mouse had been tapped on the snout, to a powerful jump which lifted the mouse completely off the floor of the cage. The former type of behavior was characteristic of very PLATE I Interior of anechoic chamber containing the testing cage and microphone young mice or of older mice which no longer were having seizures. A very few of the older mice, with long records of non-seizure, seemed to pay little or no attention to the sound when it was turned on. These were not deaf, however, for they did respond well to sounds outside of the test situation, but they were usually so busy moving or climbing about that the slight jerk which may have occurred could not be seen. Up to the occurrence of a seizure, the behavior patterns while the sound was on were modifications of the pre-testing patterns. In very young animals the quiet position was maintained. In animals over 16 days of age this quiet attitude be- came a cringe. This was probably the most characteristic reaction to the sound. The cringe in younger mice was characterized by drawing together of the body, 65</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY PLATE II UPPER: Full convulsion which usually ends in death.

In older animals, a typical cringe consisted of drawing in of the body, erection of the fur, and laying back of the ears; the eyes usually were left open and often seemed to bulge. The cringe varied in severity from a crouch which was almost like the quiet position to a very deep cringe; the mouse very excited and ready to dash off at any moment. The depth of the cringe depended chiefly on the sei- zure susceptibility of the animal. If the animal had not had seizures for some time, it was likely to be mild; if the animal had had repeated seizures, the cringe was very deep. The severity of the cringe was a sign of the possible occurrence of a seizure-a very excited cringe usually foretold a seizure. The quiet normal moving of the mouse about the cage was usually changed during the period of sound treatment into a more active, restless type of move- ment, almost invariably associated with vigorous attempts to escape by thrust- ing the nose through the cage bars. In many mice there was a continuous alter- nation of this active behavior with the cringe. A further modification of the quiet moving about was a very rapid movement, in some cases becoming an actual run, usually accompanied by vigorous attempts at escape. Another pattern was what appeared to be an almost simultaneous cringe and motion, in which the animal moved sidewise in short jerky steps. This we designated as a moving cringe and it often preceded a seizure. The over-all picture in these sequences was the alteration of a quiet coordinated pattern of exploratory movement into a vigorous and occasionally nearly uncoordinated pattern of escape from the cage. The climbing pattern seen in the pre-testing period was also modified into a more rapid and vigorous climbing, usually accompanied by attempts to escape. There was considerably more climbing among the mice after the sound was turned on than before sound treatment, all the mice exhibited this type of behavior at some time during the testing. Climbing during sound treatment varied from more or less quiet climbing, such as is seen in normal animals, to a furious, al- most uncoordinated climbing alternating with running. The cleaning pattern seen in the pre-testing period was also modified during the testing period. Cleaning was not a common pre-testing pattern, but it was very common during the testing period. It varied from true cleaning, just as a normal mouse would perform the act, often, however, more vigorous than the normal pattern, to abortive attempts at cleaning, consisting merely of passes at the nose. The term, tic, as used by Chance and Yaxley (1949) undoubtedly applies here. The activity was a mere incomplete part of the normal behavior sequence. It is worth noting that animals which exhibited mere abortive at- tempts at cleaning often were those which later had seizures, while animals which went about the cleaning in a business-like fashion were usually animals which would not have a seizure during that testing period. All of the previous patterns were exhibited both by animals which had seizures and by those which did not. It remains to describe the sequence of behavior observed during the seizure. The first phase of the seizure in mice is the running fit. This started from one 67</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY of the behavior types described above, most usually from a deep cringe (57 per cent of the times in all strains) or from a very rapid moving or climbing pattern (40 per cent of the times), most rarely from a cleaning pattern (1 per cent of the times). In this running fit, the animal dashes wildly about the cage, on the floor and up the sides, often leaping from side to side. It would be incorrect to call this uncoordinated, for the mice do not run headlong into the sides of the cage. They seem well able to seize the walls and to climb them when they come to them, rather than simply running into them. Plate II, lower, shows a mouse in a run- ning fit. The photo was taken at 1/1000 of a second, a speed which was necessary to stop the motion. During the run, the tail is held very stiff, the eyes are wide open, and the animal moves violently. The severity of the running fit usually presages the severity of the sequel. In our work we stopped the sound at the start of the running phase of the seizure. It was hoped thus to have fewer mice die in the seizures, and this proved to be well founded for 75 per cent of the mice lived even though they were tested twice per day for 36 days. Under these con- ditions, the duration of the running phase was two to fifteen seconds, most usually about five seconds. The severity of the fits which follow the running depends primarily on the individual and secondarily on the rapidity with which the sound is turned off once the mouse has started to run. In a full seizure, resulting in death, the mouse rolls over on the side and the feet kick uncoordinatedly. This phase continues for a short time, sometimes only a second, and then the mouse draws up the hind legs and thrusts them out vigorously to the rear, extending them as far as possible, with the toes widely spread, while at the same time the front legs are drawn together over the chest, the tail is extended stiffly behind, the eyes are tightly closed, and the ears are folded tightly against the head (P1. II, upper). This position is held for about 10 seconds, then the animal relaxes, the ears return to the normal erect position, and the animal is dead. Incomplete seizures were most usual in our work. These range from rolling over in the uncoordinated pattern preceding stiffening in the full seizure to merely stopping the run in a modified cringe position. Watson (1939), for Pero- myscus, designated the incomplete seizure types as a stupor, in which the animal looks and acts as if it were recovering from a full seizure, but has not had one, and a semi-stupor, in which the animal lies as in a stupor, but is capable of mov- ing about. Recovery from these two types is, as might be expected, relatively easily accomplished. Recovery from the type of seizure in which the animal rolls about in an uncoordinated fashion is generally rather slow. We were able to re- vive a few of the animals which were in a full seizure, provided they had not relaxed after the stiffening, by swinging them about by the tail. Since the mice were wanted for breeding, an effort was made to prevent full seizures, or, if they occurred, to prevent death by this method of "artificial resuscitation." Comparing the behavior patterns of the house mouse under auditory stress with those of Peromyscus, as described by Watson (1939) and by Chance and Yaxley (1949), many similarities can be noted. The behavior during the induc- tion period is strikingly similar. The differences are mainly in the seizure itself. Peromyscus runs uncoordinatedly in the first phase, bumping into obstacles, so 68 Vol. 32, No. 1</page><page sequence="10">Feb., 1951 FRINGS, FRINGS, AND KIVERT-MOUSE BEHAVIOR that it is necessary to protect the individuals against injury. The house mouse does not run uncoordinatedly. Until it starts to roll about in the second phase of the seizure, the animal avoids obstacles and climbs the cage well.

Peromyscus has a type of seizure which is designated as a "bouncing" seizure. We have not ob- served this form of behavior in the mice we have tested. Following recovery from a seizure, the animals seemed perfectly normal. The 69</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY time for recovery depended on the severity of seizure, ranging from 10 to 200 seconds with the average about 30-50 seconds. If the animal had been merely in a semi-stupor or a stupor, or had had a rather mild second phase convulsion (clonic type), recovery was rapid and the animal shortly moved about or cleaned normally. If the animal had had a severe second phase (clonic) convulsion or recovered from a full (tonic) seizure, recovery was usually slow and the animal ordinarily started moving about in circles with the legs extended, this activity changed in some seconds into normal movement. The average recovery times for the mice were: Albinos, 36 seconds; dba, 35 seconds; C-57, 24 seconds.

Records for Albinos for days no. 39, 41, 46, and 48 are omitted, because on these days, purely accidentally, all the ani- mals which were having seizures or most which were not having seizures were not tested significant. In the post-seizure period the house mouse differs from Peromyscus in not exhibiting saltation or catalepsy. There were very few strain differences in behavior patterns during the tests. In general, the dba mice seemed more nervous and jumpy and were definitely more prone to undergo full seizures, even when the sound was turned off at the beginning of the running phase, than the other strains. The C-57 mice seemed probably more prone to occupy themselves with cleaning and with business-like movements while in the cage than did the other two strains. Other than that, the behavior patterns were identical. Counts of defecations and urinations, as recorded by Hall (1947), gave so little of value that they were discontinued after a short time. These counts might be significant if the mice were handled only once, but with repeated handling the numbers of defecations and urinations become too small to mean much.

In this table, the two tests on each day are recorded as a unit; if the mouse had a seizure at either or both of these tests it is recorded as positive for that day. Thus, the number tested refers to mice tested, not to the number of tests, since on most of the days there were two tests per mouse, and the number of seizures refers to the number of mice which had either one or two seizures on a given day. Most of the mice dur- ing the period of their maximum seizure susceptibility had seizures at both test- ing periods, but during a period of low susceptibility had only one seizure per day. The percentage of seizures (i.e., number of animals having a seizure divided by number of mice tested X 100) is plotted against age in days in Figure 1. From these data it is obvious that there are few differences in seizure suscep- tibility among the three strains over the age range tested. The dba's are most susceptible, reaching a higher percentage of seizures than the other two strains. The Albinos are intermediate, and the C-57's least susceptible, but the differ- ences are not great. As a matter of fact the differences between individuals of the same strain-nay, of the same litter-were greater than those between the strains. This is well illustrated in Table 2. This presents a selection of seizure records for mice from the three strains. Those mice which have the same first number in the number series are siblings. Thus, in the C-57's, all the examples are from the same parents. These range in seizure susceptibility from one seizure (30-1-4) to 22 seizures (30-2-7) in the same number of tests. Similar wide varia- tion can be shown in the other two strains. Of particular interest-in view of the limited testing periods employed in previous studies (Hall, 1947; Witt and Hall, 1949)- are records such as those of no. 1-1-1, 8-1-10, 6-1-2, 30-1-3, and 30-1-5. These show periods of seizure susceptibility alternating with periods of non-susceptibility. If animal no. 8-1-10, for instance, were tested only from 30-34 days of age it would be classified as non-susceptible. Yet this animal has a high record in the 18-29-day period and later, at 36 days of age, again be- came susceptible and died. The seizure-age patterns which could be called most typical, of those shown in Table 2, are: for Albinos, 2-1-5; for dba's, 3-1-4 (includ- ing death), and for C-57's, 30-1-1. There are striking inter-strain differences in the death rates in seizures. Even taking into account the fact that these death rates were influenced by the speed with which the experimenter turned off the sound, it seems reasonable to assume that the number dying in these tests would be a reflection of the basic suscep- tibility to death, since all the mice were tested similarly. Obviously the dba's are most likely to die, the Albinos are intermediate in this respect, and the C-57's are least susceptible. A further fact, not presented in the table, is that males seem more susceptible to death in seizure than do females. Thus, in the dba's, of the 23 animals that died, 14 were males. The two C-57's which died were both males. Of the seven Albinos that died, three were males and four were females, but, since more females than males were tested, these are essentially equal. Thus, this work suggests that males are more fragile in seizures than are females. This was, interestingly enough, the only possible sex difference observed in this work. 71</page><page sequence="13">TABLE 2.-Selected records of seizures in mice.

For dba's the earliest age for the first seizure was also 16 days, the latest 22 days. For C-57's, the earliest age was 17 days, the latest 37 days, with one animal without a seizure. The mean ages of first seizures and standard errors thereof for the three strains are: Albino, 20.0=0.5 days; dba's, 18.5=-0.3 days; C-67's, 20.5==0.7 days. Thus, it would appear that the dba's have a slightly earlier average age of appearance of seizures, but the difference is not significant. With respect to the latent periods of seizures, that is, the time elapsing from the turning on of the sound to the appearance of the running fit, no clear-cut sex or strain differences were established. Thus, for Albinos the mean latent period is 35?-1.7 sec. for males and 31q-1.0 sec. for females. For dba's the mean latent periods are 34==1.3 sec. for males and 32?1.7 sec. for females. For C-57's the mean latent periods are 30-1.2 for males and 32==1.3 for females. For all three strains the range of times for latent periods was from 5 to 90 seconds, with a distribution skewed toward the lower time limits. In view of the large standard errors and the skew of the curves, the differences between males and females are not significant, but further work is needed to test this. There seemed to be an interesting relationship between the latent periods of seizures and the seizure pattern of the animals. Thus, in Albinos the mean latent period of the first two seizures was 38 seconds, of the middle three seizures in a continuous group of more than six, 29 seconds, and of the last seizure, 49 seconds. Putting the data into words, the mice which were having seizures regularly had shorter latent periods during the period of maximum seizure incidence than at the start or the end of the series. This has been reported previously for seizures in rats by Morgan (1941). In dba's a nearly similar phenomenon was observed. The mean latent period of the first seizures was 47 sec., the mean latent period of the middle three seizures, 33 sec., and of the last seizures, 31 sec. Here, there is no extension of the latent period at the end, the animals seeming to have seizures as quickly at the end of the seizure-susceptible period as at the middle. In C-57's the mean latent period of the first seizure was 38 sec., of the middle three, 32 sec., and of the last, 29 sec. In this respect the C-57's resemble the dba's more than they do the Albinos. Summarizing the data, the following may be stated: (1) there are few observ- able differences in basic behavior patterns of mice of the three strains tested either before or during the testing; (2) the period of maximum seizure suscepti- bility for the three strains is between 20 and 25 days of age; following 30 days of age the susceptibility declines markedly; (3) the order of susceptibility over most of the range tested is dba's most susceptible, C-57's least, and Albinos inter- mediate, and this is also the order of appearance of seizures with respect to age; (4) dba's are more susceptible to death in seizure than are Albinos or C-57's; (5) there are no significant differences in the latent preiods of seizure, but the C-57's recover more rapidly from seizures than do the other two strains; (6) there are great differences among individuals, even from the same litter, in seizure inci- dence. 73</page><page sequence="15">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY The experiment on supplementation of the basic mouse diet with dog-biscuit showed that the additional food did not affect the seizure incidence. In those C-57 individuals which received only the mouse diet, there were 191 seizure-days in 847 days of testing (22.6 per cent). In animals receiving the supplement, there were 133 seizure-days in 619 days of testing (21.5 per cent). Either the mouse diet itself is adequate nutritionally, so far as the seizure pattern can detect, or, at least, the addition of dog-biscuit is ineffective. Preliminary tests in which mice were given a wide variety of food supplements showed that these mice were just as susceptible to seizures as were those not receiving supplements. It seems reasonable, therefore, to believe that dietary deficiencies are not the factor bringing about seizures. This does not mean that dietary deficiencies may not seriously affect seizure incidence, but it seems almost certain that mice, even though receiving a perfect diet, could still be seizure-susceptible. DISCUSSION This report is descriptive and not meant to suggest possible mechanisms for the seizure pattern in mice. No attempt will, therefore, be made to compare these results with those obtained on rats. Certain points should be noted, however. This work does not seem to confirm some of the work of Hall (1947) and of Vicari (1947, 1948a) on mice of the same strains. The differences are probably due to the differences in testing procedure and apparatus. McGrael (1949), for instance, has shown that a much higher percentage of seizures can be induced in mice in a tub to which an electric bell is attached than can be induced with pure tones. These results show either that non-sonic stimuli in the tub are of great importance, or that complex tones are more effective than is a simple 10 kc. note. Since frequency, modulation, or rhythm of the sound or vibrations through the substrate might have an influence on the behavior and occurrence of seizures, it seems best to discard a piece of apparatus which does not allow control of these variables. It is not fair to compare our results, at least with dba's and possibly with Al- binos, with the previous results from another standpoint. In our work the mice which died in early seizures might, had they lived, have contributed seizures in the later tests. Thus, even if the seizure rate remained constant, the deaths of the highly susceptible animals, while non-susceptible or little-susceptible mice re- mained alive, would apparently cause a decrease in seizure rate. The drop in seizure susceptibility in older mice is real, however, for the records of mice which lived throughout the entire testing period showed the same drop in susceptibility in the 40-50-day period. But the absolute rates of older populations are measured in our experiments only for C-57's, and possibly for Albinos, since relatively few of these died. The work of Witt and Hall (1949) deserves some comment in the light of these results with respect to seizures in C-57's and dba's. Witt and Hall state that the appearance of audiogenic seizures in the house mouse at 30-34 days of age is determined by a single dominant gene, with modifying factors possibly present. Since both strains are seizure-susceptible earlier in life, it would perhaps 74 Vol. 32, No. 1</page><page sequence="16">Feb., 1951 FRINGS, FRINGS, AND KIVERT-MOUSE BEHAVIOR be better to conclude from their results that the particular inbred lines which they used differ with respect to a single gene pair, the recessive allele bringing about only early seizure (20-day period), the dominant allele bringing about both early and later seizure (30-day period). From further work now in progress in this laboratory, it may be stated that seizure incidence and the age of appearance of seizures are both influenced by more than one gene pair. In such a case it is obvious that mere inbreeding, with- out selection of parents, can produce homogeneously high or low susceptibility stocks only as a result of a series of accidents. Studies of inbred lines allow merely determination of the genic differences between these lines. For full elucidation of the genetic phenomena involved, either many inbred lines differing with re- spect to many gene pairs must be studied, with the hope that all the possible combinations in the series will thus be turned up, or stocks must be produced by progeny selection in which the genes for high and low incidence or for age modifications are cumulated. In either case, a great amount of further work is needed before fruitful generalizations about the genetics of audiogenic seizures can be made. SUMMARY Mice of three strains (Albino, C-57, and dba) were tested for susceptibility to audiogenic seizures over the age-range 15 to 50 days. The sound stimulus was a 10 kc./sec. note at an average intensity of 110 db. The seizure pattern and pre- seizure behavior of the mice are described in detail. There were few inter-strain or sex differences in behavior or incidence of seizures. In general, C-57's seem least susceptible and dba's most susceptible, but great individual variation in susceptibility and pattern was found even within the same litter. REFERENCES CHANCE, M. R.

INDIRECT EVIDENCE SUPPORTING OBSERVATIONS ON THE RANGE OF WILD RODENTS BY C. BROOKE WORTH Investigators on the home range and wandering of certain small mammals have presented essential data on this subject. By laboriously trapping, marking, releasing, and subsequently retrapping the animals, they have been able to show that most species are characterized by an astonishingly small home range and by an inclination to remain in their territories unless disturbed. Examples of such studies are those of Davis, Emlen, and Stokes (1948) on the brown rat; of Stickel and Stickel (1949) on the cotton rat; of Burt (1940) on the white-footed mouse; of Howard (1949) on the prairie deer mouse; and of Fitch (1948) on the kangaroo rat. During the course of typhus fever investigations in Florida, 1948 and 1949, large numbers of common native wild rodents were trapped. An unexpected by- product of this activity was the opportunity to make two unrelated observations that support a conclusion generally agreed upon by mammalogists, namely, that in most species adult male rodents wander farther than adult females. The studies and observations on which this paper is based were conducted with the support and under the auspices of the International Health Division of The Rockefeller Foundation in co-operation with the Florida State Board of Health. Materials and methods.-Live trapping was undertaken in order to bleed the animals for typhus immunity tests and also to recover as many ectoparasites as possible. Modified rabbit box traps (Richter and Emlen, 1945) and metal "Hav- a-hart" traps were used almost exclusively. The surviving animals were retained for experimental use. 76 Vol. 32, No. 1</page></plain_text>
