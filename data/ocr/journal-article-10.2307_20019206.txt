Stud. 23, pp. 157-170 ALEXANDER BROADIE University of Glasgow MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON THE NAMES OF GOD1 What is the correct way to interpret terms when they are used to signify divine attributes? In The Guide of the Perplexed Maimonides addresses this perennial problem. I shall discuss his solution, and on the basis of that discussion I shall attempt to shed light on the question of the relationship between Maimonides' solution and that of St Thomas Aquinas, Maimonides' most illustrious critic. I wish to argue that on this most important of issues the difference between these two universal figures is a good deal less than might readily be supposed. But first it should be said that Maimonides did not make things easy for those of later generations who have sought his help. Part of our difficulty with the Guide is rooted in the pastoral concern which Maimonides had for the strength of faith of those in his care. He recognized that certain of his doctrines lent themselves to misinterpretations which could lead to loss of faith. And we should scarcely expect the greatest leader of twelfth-century Jewry to ignore such a risk. His solution was to write the Guide on two levels, for two classes of people, the philosophically sophisticated and the multitude. Evidently a book which is both esoteric and exoteric leaves room for dispute about the author's intentions. And disputes have duly taken place. But there is a consensus on one critically important matter, namely, the purpose of the Guide. It was written in order to provide a philosophical interpretation of the Bible for conscientiously observant Jews who have at the same time been successful in their philosophical studies. Those studies might set the faith of such Jews at risk, and Maimonides' intention is to protect their faith. In accepting this as his intention I am taking him at his word. Maimonides does not speak in riddles on this matter. He says of the kind of person for whom the Guide is written: 'The human intellect having drawn him on and led him to dwell within its province, he must have felt distressed by the externals of the Law and by the meaning of [its] equivocal, derivative or amphibolous terms, as he continued to understand them by himself or was made to understand them by others. Hence he would remain in a state of perplexity and confusion as to whether he should follow his intellect, renounce what he knew concerning the terms in question, and consequently 1 This paper is a revised version of a public lecture delivered at Cambridge University in October 1985 as part of the University's commemoration of the 850th anniversary of the birth of Maimonides. 6 RES 23</page><page sequence="2">I58 ALEXANDER BROADIE consider that he has renounced the foundations of the Law' (Guide. Intro, p. 5).1 With these words Maimonides takes us to the heart of a problem of central importance to theology and the philosophy of religion. He quotes the exegetical principle : ' The Torah speaketh in the language of the sons of man' Guide 1, 26, p. 56). The Bible is written in a language men can understand. But our language is creaturely all the way through. It arises amongst us creatures, enabling us to talk about the created world known to us through our creaturely senses. With our language so rooted in the created world, small wonder that obstacles are encountered when we attempt to use it to speak about the Creator. It is not at all for me to contest here the claim that in fact our language is used, successfully, to express truths about God. Neither is there any hint that Maimonides wished to contest that claim. The emphasis has to be placed elsewhere. For the question is not whether the truths about God are true, but whether we can make sense of them either to ourselves or to others. Maimonides believes that we can to some extent make sense of them. And in the Guide he is concerned to show the way. Let us return to the exegetical principle: 'The Torah speaketh in the language of the sons of man.' What is at issue here is what the philosophers of the Christian west called the modus significandi of terms - the manner in which the terms signify. And in a number of treatises entitled De Nominibus Dei or De Divinis Nominibus, 'On the names of God', the modus significandi in question was the creaturely mode. For it is in that way that the Bible talks about God. The Bible is replete with anthropomorphisms. But philosophy teaches us that those anthropomorphisms cannot, on a literal interpretation, be true. The philosophy in question is Aristotelian. In particular, terms which imply the corporeality of God must be reinterpreted, given the concept of God as an uncaused cause and as self-thinking thought. And approaching the matter from another point of view, Maimonides reminds us of the verse : ' Hear O Israel, the Lord our God the Lord is one ' (Deut. 6. 4). Maimonides understands the verse to be saying both that God is one in the sense that there is only one God - He is unique, and also that God is not a many-in-one, but is instead absolutely simple. And absolute simplicity is incompatible with corporeality, for whatever is corporeal is extended, and whatever is extended is divisible. We are required therefore to treat as non-literal all those expressions which imply corporeality, if those expressions are predicated of 'God'. In this matter Maimonides adopts, without alteration, the method of the Aramaic translator Onkelos. Thus Maimonides interprets 'And the Lord my God shall come and all the holy ones with thee' (Zech. 14. 5) as signifying 'the descent of God's decree or the realization of the promises made by Him 1 All translations of the Guide are taken from Moses Maimonides : The Guide of the Perplexed, tr. S. Pines, with Introductory Essay by Leo Strauss, Chicago 1963. All translations from Aquinas's writings are my own.</page><page sequence="3">MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON THE NAMES OF GOD 159 through His prophets' (Guide i, 22, p. 52). But unlike Onkelos, whose theoretical principles have to be extrapolated from his practice, Maimonides is explicit. And the ground principle is that any term which implies creatureliness is falsely predicated of God. But since the mode of signifying of our language is creaturely, are we not forced to the conclusion that our language is wholly inadequate as an instrument for talking about God, and that therefore we should be silent before Him? Maimonides was evidently sympathetic to this argument and indeed quotes with approval the words of King David : ' Silence is praise to Thee' (Guide 1, 59. p. 139; see Ps. 65. 2). Yet silence is not the only possible response to insight into the inadequacy of creaturely language. Since descriptive terms have a creaturely mode of signifying, those terms occur in true negative propositions whose subject is 'God'. And we are well launched into negative theology. The merit of negative theology is particularly clear if we lean hard on the Maimonidean concept of the absolute simplicity of God. To affirm anything whatever of God is to imply that He is complex, for to affirm an attribute of Him, even one attribute, is to imply a distinction between God, to whom the attribute is attributed, and the attribute He is said to have. The only exception that Maimonides allows to the thesis that affirmative attribution cannot be made truly of God concerns God's actions. For he holds God's actions not to be part of God, that is, part of His nature, but to follow from that nature. But how is the thesis that nothing can truly be affirmed of God to be squared with the fact that in the Bible many things are affirmed of God and, apparently, not merely of His actions, for example, power, wisdom, justice, mercy, love? But we are not to be lulled by the explicit content of written or spoken language. A proposition which does not explicitly contain a negative particle may all the same contain one implicitly. Thus the affirmation of God's wisdom is to be understood as a denial of His ignorance or foolishness. The affirmation of God as living is to be understood as a denial that He is dead. This is not of course to say that that is what most people mean by such predications. It is to say that that is what the Bible means by them. Such an approach to the understanding of the divine names, 'good', 'wise', 'just', and so on, has two related advantages. First, it avoids all anthropomorphic ascription. It does that by avoiding ascription entirely. Secondly, it avoids any compromise of the doctrine of God's absolute simplicity, and therefore avoids any flirtation with polytheism. For Maimo? nides believes that if we attribute attributes to God, though each of those attributes would be divine none of them would be identical with God Himself. And how would we be able to block the implication that those separate divine attributes, goodness, wisdom, justice, and so on, were themselves divinities? But to believe in many gods is not to believe in God 6-2</page><page sequence="4">16o ALEXANDER BROADIE at all. And hence the belief in divine attributes leads, Maimonides holds, to atheism. But though we cannot know what God is we can still ask whether He is, and indeed Part n of the Guide opens with a proof of the existence of God as uncaused first cause. Nevertheless, granted the obvious distinction between the thatness and the whatness of something, there must remain a doubt as to whether a that can lack whatness. The argument, briefly stated, is that if there is nothing that God is then God is nothing; and there is no difference between saying that He is nothing, and saying that He does not exist. And in that case, Maimonides' position, no less than that of his opponent, is atheistic. If this is an implication of Maimonides' position then it is as far removed from what he would wish as anything could be. We would have to be very sure of our arguments before asserting with any confidence that The Guide of the Perplexed is implicitly atheistic. One point that should be stressed here is that Maimonides does not hold that we are unable to describe God truly. He holds that we can say a great deal about God. His point is that we cannot use affirmative terms in describing Him. That we can form a concept of God is evidenced by the fact that we know that affirmative terms truly predicated of God are to be understood negatively. This knowledge of God does not reduce to vanishing point as the negations increase. On the contrary, for Maimonides, our knowledge increases as we purify our concept of God through an increasing grasp of the fact that all that is creaturely must be denied of Him. In all this we should not lose sight of the fact that when, on Mount Horeb, Moses asked God what His name was, so that he could tell the Israelites who had sent him, God replied: 'I AM; that is who I am. Tell them that I AM has sent you to them' (Ex. 3. 13-14). The name of God which God Himself revealed to Moses involves no creaturely ascription. But Maimonides warns against too easy an acceptance of this last point. For while it is true that we must ascribe existence to God, even existence as ascribed to Him must be understood negatively. Maimonides writes : '... the multitude cannot at first conceive of any existence save that of a body alone; thus that which is neither a body nor existent in a body does not exist in their opinion ' (Guide 1, 26, p. 56). Thus we have to recognise that we have a creaturely concept of existence, and therefore the term ' existence ' has a creaturely mode of signifying. Since the kinds of existence we are familiar with are creaturely it is more accurate to deny existence of God than to affirm it. For at least by such a denial we avoid implying the erroneous doctrine that God is Himself creaturely. Maimonides is well aware that his programme for the systematic purifi? cation of our concept of God leads to the very brink of atheism, and it is not to be wondered at that he is alive to the risks attached to publication of the Guide. The faith of the faithful might well be tested by the discovery that a</page><page sequence="5">MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON THE NAMES OF GOD l6l great spiritual leader was drawn, by apparently rigorous logical steps, to a denial of God's existence. Of course Maimonides is not saying simply that God does not exist. He is saying that He does exist (and demonstrably does), but that He does not exist in a creaturely way. He exists in His own unique way. But still we might wish to know what that way is. Now the most conspicuous formal point about the negative way as presented in the Guide is that it is presented as the sole alternative to affirmative theology. Maimonides, though steeped in Aristotelian philosophy, was unable to countenance a middle way between the doctrine that affirmative terms are, as literally understood, predicable truly of God, and the doctrine that affirmative terms are used entirely equivocally when truly predicated of God. Yet we might argue that the affirmative way leads to anthropomorphism and the negative way to atheism, and that these two ways are undesirable extremes in relation to a middle way which has the virtues of each extreme while lacking the vices of each. I shall turn shortly to a consideration of the most influential middle way that has been proposed, namely, that by Aquinas. But I should like first to make the point that for all the problems associated with Maimonides' negative theology, such a theology was found attractive by many, not least by its chief opponent, Aquinas. Immediately after the quaestio in the Summa Theologiae in which he presents the quinqu? viae, the five proofs of God's existence, Aquinas writes : ' Having recognized that a certain thing exists, it remains for us to enquire in what way it exists so that we may know what it is. But since we cannot know what God is but only what He is not, we cannot consider in what way He is. Rather we must consider in what way He is not' (S.T. i. 3, Intro.). And Aquinas immediately focuses on the absolute simplicity of God and on the corollary that God is incorporeal. We should not expect Maimonides to disagree with one word of Aquinas's position thus stated. Furthermore Aquinas does not lose sight of the fact that the negative way is deeply entrenched in the theology of the Christian west. The first article of the quaestio in the Summa Theologiae concerning the divine names opens with the argument: 'It seems that no name is appropriate to God. For Dionysius says : " Of Him there is neither name nor opinion " ' (S. T. 1, 13, 1, 1). And we are left in no doubt that Aquinas felt strongly the case for a negative theology. But he saw such theology merely as a stage on the way to a correct interpretation of the divine names. In particular he saw as a great virtue of negative theology its determination not to compromise the doctrine of divine absolute simplicity. Since that doctrine was a part of negative theology that theology was not to be rejected entirely. But why reject at all the negative way of interpreting names of God? For an answer let us turn to Aquinas's classic discussion. He is concerned with the problem of whether terms can be used to say anything about God's nature, and admits at the start, in line with Maimonides, that negative terms</page><page sequence="6">I?2 ALEXANDER BROADIE and relational terms are in this respect irrelevant, for such terms either express what God is not or express a relation in which things stand to God. The problem arises specifically for the traditional names of God, good, wise, living, and so on. He then reports as follows : ' Some have said that though all these names are affirmed of God, the propositions thus formed in fact deny, rather than affirm, things of Him. Thus those people say that when we say that God is living we signify that God is not like an inanimate thing, and so on. And this is what Rabbi Moses said in The Guide of the Perplexed' (S.T. i, i3&gt; 2, c). Against this position Aquinas brings two arguments. First, on such a view no reason can be provided why some names rather than others should be assigned to God. For example, continues Aquinas, we might say that God is a body, for this is to deny that He is being in mere potency, like prime matter. But it has to be said that in the Guide Maimonides meets this line of criticism head-on. He writes: '...one has ascribed to Him, may he be exalted, everything that in our opinion is a perfection in order to indicate that He is perfect in every manner of perfection and that no deficiency whatever mars Him. Thus none of the things apprehended by the multitude as a deficiency or a privation are predicated of Him.. .On the other hand, everything that the multitude consider a perfection is predicated of Him, even if it is only a perfection in relation to ourselves - for in relation to Him, may He be exalted, all things that we consider perfections are the very extreme of deficiency. However, if people imagined that this human perfection was lacking in Him, may He be exalted, this would constitute, in their opinion, a deficiency in Him' (i, 26, p. 56). For example, since ' wise ' has a creaturely mode of signifying, wisdom is falsely ascribed to God. And it is no less false to say that God is wise than to say that He is foolish. In this respect Aquinas is right to wonder why some names rather than others should be assigned to God. For indeed, in virtue of their creaturely modus significandi, no names should be assigned to Him. Maimonides himself saw this point as clearly as anyone could. But he saw something else, and his further insight accords with what we know of the pastoral considerations which weighed most heavily with him. Terms signifying perfections must be used if the faith of the faithful is to be protected. There is a special value in the observance by Jews of the divine commandments, and if acceptance of certain claims would lead to a weakening of that observance, and therefore to the weakening of a living symbol of the Covenant between God and Israel, then those claims must be rejected. Thus for pastoral reasons ultimately related to Israel's mission, people have to be taught that names signifying perfections can be assigned to God, and names signifying imperfections must not be assigned to Him. I conclude that Maimonides formulated for himself the criticism levelled</page><page sequence="7">MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON THE NAMES OF GOD 163 seven decades later by Aquinas, and answered it. He is saying: yes, names signifying perfections are, from the philosophical point of view, inappro? priately assigned to God, just as are names signifying imperfections. And it is a practical consideration, rather than a theoretical one, that justifies the use of the names of perfections and rules our use of other names. I shall turn now to Aquinas's second criticism of the negative theology of the Guide. He writes : ' This is contrary to the intention of those who speak about God. For when they say that God is alive they mean something other than that...He differs from inanimate bodies' (S.T. 1. 13, 2, c). In responding to this criticism we must recall that in the Introduction to the Guide Maimonides distinguishes between two types of people, the philo? sophically sophisticated and the multitude. Though on many matters the opinions of the multitude are sound, they are not always so. And a philosopher will not accept an opinion merely because it is held by most people. The question he always asks is whether that opinion is sanctioned by reason. And we have already observed Maimonides to hold both that most people think of God in corporeal terms and also that in so thinking they fall into the error of applying creaturely categories to God. Maimonides' reply therefore to Aquinas's criticism must be that Aquinas's argument is demon strably invalid. The premises are true and the conclusion false. Aquinas is right when he says that people do not understand affirmative terms used of God as implicitly negative. But the question is not merely how they understand those terms but whether they understand them correctly. And of course Maimonides holds that they do not. Aquinas, however, clearly regards his appeal to what people intend as a telling criticism of the negative theology of the Guide. Nevertheless we might pause here to note that in Aquinas's hands that criticism may be a double edged weapon. For he, also, has a theory concerning divine names, and it is open to us to wonder whether his theory fares better than Maimonides' does if it has to satisfy the criterion of concordance with what people intend. I shall argue that there is good reason to hold that the weapon in Aquinas's hands is indeed double edged. Let us turn to a consideration of Aquinas's own doctrine, and start by noting an observation made by Aquinas, specifically against Maimonides, in the De Potentia Dei. There he asserts: 'Understanding of a negation is always based on some affirmation. This is evident from the fact that every negative proposition is proved from an affirmative. Hence unless the human understanding knew something affirma? tively about God, it could not deny anything of Him. But it would not know anything affirmatively of God if nothing said of God were true affirmatively of Him' (De Pot. 7. 5, c). Yet we have already seen that Aquinas elsewhere indicates his sympathy for negative theology, at least so far as that theology seeks to keep faith with the doctrine of divine simplicity. Aquinas has therefore to show how a theology which is not purely negative can maintain</page><page sequence="8">164 ALEXANDER BROADIE faith with that same doctrine. He seeks to do this by making use of Aristotle's dictum: 'Words are signs of thoughts, and thoughts are likenesses of things' (De Int. i6a3). This dictum is not to be interpreted as saying that our utterances signify our thoughts directly, and only indirectly, through our thoughts, signify things. The point is rather that our utterances signify things no less directly than do our thoughts, but unless we already had the thoughts we could not use terms of conventional language to signify those things. For signification, therefore, thoughts have priority over terms of conventional language. If therefore we are to speak about God we must be able to think about, or form a concept of, Him. It is Aquinas's contention that we can form such a concept. God is the creator, and it is not possible for the creator to put nothing of Himself into His creation, any more than it is possible for the human artificer to put nothing of himself into what he makes. And just as we can read off something about the human artificer by studying what he has made, so we can learn something about God by studying the created world. We have here the basis of arguments not only for the existence of God but also for God as having a certain nature. This position, which is that of Aquinas, is stated also by Maimonides: '... there [is] nothing in what exists besides God, may He be exalted, and the totality of the things He has made. For this totality includes everything comprised in what exists except only Him. There is, moreover, no way to apprehend Him except it be through the things He has made; for they are indicative of His existence and of what ought to be believed about Him, I mean to say, of what should be affirmed and denied with regard to Him' (Guide 1, 34, p. 74). Yet though we might say that God is a being of such a kind as to be able to create this world, we cannot say that he might not have created instead another world infinitely different from our own, nor even can we say that He has not in fact created infinitely many such worlds. What limit, after all, could we suppose God to have in respect of His will once we suppose Him capable of creating our world? We have to acknowledge, therefore, the overwhelming probability that what we can know of God by a consideration of the mundus creatus is almost nothing compared with what there is for other better endowed intelligences to know of Him. But in so far as what we know of God manages to be more than nothing, however little more than nothing, to that extent we have a concept of God which we can then express in words. Hence, looking at the world we conclude that God has wisdom. But our concept of God's wisdom is rooted in our merely creaturely grasp of the wisdom required for the creation of our world. And we have to allow accordingly, that that concept is an inadequate representation of its object. It signifies God's wisdom but imperfectly. Nevertheless, imperfect as that signification is, it does not fail entirely. And to the extent that it does not fail, it avoids having a merely negative</page><page sequence="9">MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON THE NAMES OF GOD 165 signification. Aquinas uses in illustration of his doctrine the causal power of the sun which produces many effects each of which is inadequate as a representative of the sun. The sun warms a rock, but the warmth of the rock is an imperfect representative of the power of the sun by which the rock is warmed. How little we know of the sun if we know of it only that it is sufficient to warm that rock. Let us stay with this illustration, for it is employed by Aquinas (S. T. i. 13, 5, c) in explanation of the simplicity of God. The sun produces many effects of different kinds in the terrestrial world. Yet it is by one and the same power in the sun that the many different kinds of effect are produced. Let us not, therefore, argue that because God manifests Himself in ways that make us speak of Him as powerful, wise, merciful, just and so on, these many acts which we observe and by which we seek to form a concept of God are expressive of many different parts of God's nature. The sun, therefore, provides us with a model for understanding, however inadequately, the absolute simplicity of God. Maimonides employs a similar illustration: '... he who does not know the nature of fire thinks that there subsist in it six diverse notions, by means of one of which it blackens, whereas it bleaches by means of another, cooks by means of a third, burns by means of a fourth, melts by means of a fifth, and makes hard by means of a sixth - all these actions being opposed to one another, for the meaning of any one of them is different from that of any other. However he who knows the nature of fire, knows that it performs all these actions by means of one active quality, namely, heat. If however such a state of affairs exists with respect to a thing acting by virtue of its nature, it exists all the more with respect to one who acts through will, and again all the more with respect to Him, may He be exalted, who is above every attributive qualification' (Guide i, 53, p. 120). But Maimonides does add, while speaking of God's simplicity: '...the bounds of expression in all languages are very narrow indeed, so that we cannot represent this notion to ourselves except through a certain looseness of expression ' (Guide 1, 57, pp. 132-3). In respect of the inadequacy of our language as a means of speaking about God's simplicity, Maimonides and Aquinas are in agreement. But we have to bear in mind the fact that as regards the traditional names of God, Maimonides holds that they fail entirely to signify God's nature whereas Aquinas holds that they do signify it though inadequately. But Aquinas makes a crucial distinction between modus significandi and ratio significations. On the one hand there is the creaturely mode of signifying the divine perfections, and on the other hand there are the divine perfections themselves existing, we are told, eminentiori modo, in a higher way in God than we can possibly grasp. And Aquinas holds that as regards their ratio significations the names of the perfections are not only appropriately ascribed to God but are more appropriately ascribed to Him than to creatures, for such goodness as</page><page sequence="10">166 ALEXANDER BROADIE there is in creatures is an effect of what we call goodness in God, though our goodness no more adequately represents God's than the warmth of a stone adequately represents the heat of the sun. But as regards the modus significandi of the names in question, they are not appropriately ascribed to God, for they have a mode of signifying which belongs to creatures (S.T. i. 13, 3, c). That is, we understand the names on the basis of our creaturely experience of created things, and if we ascribe them to God while believing them to be true of Him as they are true of us, we have anthropomorphic beliefs about God. The notion of imperfect signifying lies at the heart of Aquinas's criticism of Maimonides. Affirmative terms used to name God do not, in respect of their modus significandi, signify univocally, contrary to the view of affirmative theology. Neither do they signify entirely equivocally as Maimonides holds. They signify imperfectly. The term Aquinas employed to describe this special use of terms was 'analogy'. And the analogical way is the via media between the affirmative way which supposedly founders on the rock of anthropo? morphism and the negative way which supposedly founders on the rock of atheism. But is this really a via media? Our understanding of the names of God is, we are told, imperfect. But how imperfect? And at this point we must give prominence to the concept of divine simplicity. Aquinas, no less than Maimonides, insists that the doctrine of divine simplicity must not be compromised. Yet Aquinas reminds us that God is powerful, wise, good, just, merciful. How, we ask, can all these terms truly be predicated of God if He is indeed absolutely simple? And Aquinas's answer (S.T. 1, 13, 5, c) is that in God power, wisdom, goodness, and so on, are all identical with each other and all are identical with God. For some of us, carried along by Aquinas's logic towards the discovery of a via media, it is discomforting to find Aquinas committed to the doctrine that God's power, His knowledge, and His mercy are identical with each other. Having been reassured by the claim that we can form a concept, even if only an imperfect one, of God's mercy, our assurance may well drain away when we are taught that God's mercy is indistinguishable in God from His knowledge and His power. Of course, there is no difficulty attached to the claim that power and knowledge are required for an act of mercy. But that point is not at issue. The problem arises when it is said that the power, knowledge, and mercy are one. If they are one then there is room for wonder as to whether an advance really has been made beyond the via negativa in reaching the via anal?gica, or whether, instead, the via anal?gica leaves us with a negative account of the names of God. The proposition under consideration, therefore, is that the via anal?gica is not, after all a via media, but is instead a version of the via negativa. If this proposition is correct we cannot say that we have not been given due notice by Aquinas himself. We should here recall</page><page sequence="11">MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON THE NAMES OF GOD 167 his words which I quoted earlier: 'Since we cannot know what God is but only what He is not, we cannot consider in what way He is. Rather we must consider in what way He is not' (S.T. i. 3, Intro.). If indeed these two viae are really one, this fact would explain a curious feature of the philosophies of Maimonides and Aquinas, namely, that in their detailed analyses of the specific names of God, Maimonides and Aquinas are in agreement to a quite remarkable extent. Of course it is open to us to conclude that one or other of those two great philosophers had forgotten his own doctrine on the names of God even while expounding his analysis of those names. I am inclined to accept as more plausible the explanation that the via negativa of Maimonides and the via anal?gica of Aquinas are not different doctrines. The very different formulations mask a sameness of substance. In support of this proposal I shall turn to the evidence provided by the discussions of the two philosophers on the concept of God's knowledge. God has knowledge. But in ascribing knowledge to God what is it that we are ascribing to Him? Is God's knowledge like our knowledge? Maimonides says that we cannot grasp the nature of divine knowledge and Aquinas says that we can do so, though imperfectly. But they agree that the problem for us is that we are familiar with knowledge only so far as it occurs under the conditions of creatureliness. As a first step, therefore, towards forming a concept of God's knowledge, we must engage in the conceptual exercise of determining what our knowledge would be like if the conditions of creature? liness were removed. Both Maimonides (Guide, esp. m, 16, 19-21) and Aquinas (S.T. 1, 14) engage in that exercise, and we shall now attend to the resultant teachings. It will quickly become evident that Maimonides' via negativa is a more subtle method for discovering truths about God than his highly schematic remarks early in the Guide would lead us to believe. His detailed discussion of God's knowledge flanks his account of divine providence, for God's providential care of individuals implies divine know? ledge of individuals, and conversely if God does not take providential care of individuals this may be due to the fact that, whatever God knows, He has a nature which prevents Him knowing individuals. Indeed, Maimonides begins by noting an error made by certain philosophers who observe some excellent people to be in a grievous plight and some wicked people to be in good and pleasurable circumstances. Since those philosophers did not wish to impute negligence to God, they drew the conclusion that God is ignorant of individuals in this world (Guide m, 16, pp. 461-2). And this conclusion was in turn supported by further arguments, first, that particular things are apprehended by means of the senses only, and not by the intellect, but God lacks senses. Therefore, by His nature He cannot know individuals. Secondly, the knowledge of changing things involves a change in the knower. And since God is immutable such knowledge is not possible for Him. Maimonides will</page><page sequence="12">168 ALEXANDER BROADIE reject both of these arguments, as indeed, in due course, will Aquinas (S.T. i, 14, 11 ; 1, 14, 15). But it is to be noted that the philosophers whose errors Maimonides seeks to expose share with Maimonides a recognition that if we are to gain insight into divine knowledge we must seek to abstract from our knowledge those features of it which derive from our creaturely modus essendi; our knowledge is knowledge had by sensory mutable beings. Whatever God's knowledge is, it is not like that. It should be said that Maimonides believed in providence, though providence of a highly elitist sort, for he held that 'divine providence watches only over the individuals belonging to the human species' (Guide in, 17. p. 471), and that it 'does not watch in an equal manner over all the individuals of the human species, but providence is graded as their human perfection is graded ' (Guide in, 18, p. 475). Elitist or not, such a theory certainly implies divine knowledge of individual persons; and if some philosophers argue that divine providence is incompatible with the unsatisfactory distribution of pleasures and pains among the virtuous and the wicked, Maimonides' brief reply, which he elsewhere develops in detail, is that 'things should be considered in their final outcome and not in their beginnings' (Guide m 19, p. 477). If further it is argued that we know individuals through our senses, and God, who lacks senses, can have no conception of sensory experience, the first line of attack is that 'in the case of everyone who makes any instrument, it is clear that unless he had a conception of the work to be done with that instrument, he would be unable to make it' (Guide m 19, p. 478), and this consideration applies no less to God's creative work than to the work of a human artificer. This point is, of course, embedded in a negative theology and has to be understood on that basis. Maimonides is not saying that God has visual experiences of the same character as the visual experiences we have. He is saying only that God knows the use of the eye. How he knows it we cannot say, we can say only that He does not know it as we know it. For God's knowing is unlike ours. How unlike? In the Guide (in, 20) several differences between God's knowledge and ours are discussed. I wish to set what Maimonides says on this matter alongside positions adopted by Aquinas. First, Maimonides writes: '[God's knowledge] may have as its object something that does not exist' (p. 483). Thus we say of God that He has known all the things that are produced anew before they have come about and He has known them perpetually (p. 481). But Maimonides makes a distinction, between that which is at some time brought into existence, and that which never is, and holds that that which at any time is in existence is an object of knowledge for God even while it does not exist, whereas 'that which is never brought into existence is, with reference to His knowledge, an absolutely nonexistent thing, which is not an object for His knowledge,</page><page sequence="13">MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON THE NAMES OF GOD 169 as that which is nonexistent for us is not an object for our knowledge' (p. 481). Aquinas's position, found in his article ' Utrum deus habeat scientiam non entium" (S.T. i, 14, 9), is very similar to that of Maimonides, the chief difference being that Aquinas makes a distinction between scientia visionis by which God knows those things which, if they are not now in in actu, were or will be, and scientia simplicis intelligentiae by which God knows those things which are in potentia dei vel creaturae but neither are nor were nor will be. Secondly, Maimonides writes: ' [God's knowledge] may have as its object something that is infinite' (p. 483). Here however he pauses to mention a difficulty: ' Some of the people of speculation came to profess the opinion that knowledge (i.e. God's knowledge) has for its object the species, but, in a certain sense, extends to all the individuals of the species' (p. 481). This is a cryptic statement. But the position at issue appears to be that perhaps we should say that it is the species God knows directly, and only indirectly through His knowledge of the species does He know the perhaps infinitely many members of the species. For all the obscurity of the passage, however, there is no denying its proximity to Aquinas's teaching on this matter. In his article ' Utrum deuspossit cognoscere infinita' (S.T. 1, 14, 12) Aquinas argues that since God knows all things which are in actu and all things which are in potentia, and since these are infinite, God knows infinite things. And if we include the thoughts and the affections of the heart then God knows infinite things not merely by scientia simplicis intelligentiae but by scientia visionis. But Aquinas adds a point of clarification : the intelligible species in our intellect is a likeness of a thing qua member of a species to which infinite individuals can belong. And hence, through the intelligible species of man, in a way we know infinite men, but not infinite men in so far as they are mutually distinct, but only in so far as they are members of the one species. But God can know each individual member of the species through the intelligible species. There is room for dispute about the precise relation between Maimonides and Aquinas on this matter, but there is no doubt that they are dealing with the same problem and reaching, at least broadly, the same conclusion about divine knowledge of infinite things. Thirdly, Maimonides writes: '[God's] knowledge undergoes no changes in its apprehension of things produced in time' (p. 483). In illustration he writes: 'No new knowledge comes to Him in any way. For, seeing that He knows that a certain man is now nonexistent, but will exist at a certain time, will go on existing for such and such a duration, and will then again become nonexistent, there will be for Him no additional knowledge when that individual comes into existence as He had known beforehand' (p. 480). For Maimonides, therefore, the same considerations that are brought into play in establishing God's knowledge of nonexistents are also relevant to the concept of the immutability of God's knowledge. In a single timeless vision God sees all that for us was, is, and will be. Our knowledge changes as our</page><page sequence="14">17O ALEXANDER BROADIE apprehension changes. But to say that God's knowledge is likewise affected by the object of His apprehension is to suppose that God's knowledge is determined by the conditions of creatureliness. Aquinas devotes an article to the question 'Utrum scientia dei sit variabilis" (S.T. 1, 14, 15) in which he argues that since God's knowledge is His substance and His substance is immutable, so also is His knowledge. All these propositions about divine knowledge demand clarification, and some may prove untenable. My immediate concern, however, is to make the point that those propositions are no less Thomist than they are Maimonidean. The question at issue here is not the extent to which Aquinas was influenced, directly or otherwise, by the Guide when working out his own theory of divine knowledge. The question is instead whether the difference between the via negativa and the via anal?gica can be a substantial philosophical difference, given the close similarity of the analyses which result from the detailed application of those two viae. My contention is that the difference is one of formulation rather than of substance. Maimonides, under the name Doctor Perplexorum or Doctor Dubiorum, was invoked by many philosophers and theologians in the Christian west, his views sometimes accepted, sometimes not. And if I am right they were sometimes accepted where they seem at first, or even at second, sight not to have been. In the Secunda Secundae of the Summa Theologiae St Thomas portrays the Jews as witnesses, even though unconsciously and certainly contrary to their intentions, to the validity of the lex nova. They reject Christ incarnate though accept him in figura. Rabbi Moses and St. Thomas, on a stage which is smaller though, even so, not lacking in cosmic significance, reverse the roles. If the argument of this paper is correct, St. Thomas, even though unconsciously and certainly contrary to his intentions, testifies in his via anal?gica to the richness and persuasiveness of the central proposition of Rabbi Moses concerning the names of God, Even while denying that proposition he accepts it.</page></plain_text>
