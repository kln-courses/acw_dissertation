<plain_text><page sequence="1">abstracts Fanny's Gaze and the Construction of Feminine Space in Mansfield Park by Anna Despotopoulou This article re-evaluates the protagonist of Mansfield Park through the lens of gaze theory, asserting that Fanny Price withstands the gaze of the male characters while imposing her own powerful gaze, which encompasses views, tastes, morality, and emotions. According to this reading, Jane Austen seems to be imparting to Fanny certain principles of the moral philosophy of Adam Smith, who argued that the moral guide for one's actions should be an imagined, potential spectator, not a literal one. While the other female characters submit to the male gaze, Fanny exemplifies agency by employing a moral gaze reinforced by feminine sensibility. Anthropomorphism and Other Figures of Speech in James Joyce's Ulysses by Sarah Joseph This close reading from 'Proteus' shows how Stephen, the would-be writer, projects his mind onto the Dublin landscape. Analysing his anthropomorphism helps explain subjective trans? formations of the objective world in the modern hero's mind. Figures of speech which trap the poet's consciousness are examined in their philosophical context. Stephen's difnculty in crossing the waste land symbolizes the attempt to reach meaning in language and Joyce, while seeming to guide us, in fact deconstructs (invalidates) our interpretative endeavours. Cynic Shamelessness in Late Sixteenth-Century French Texts by Hugh Roberts This article examines the diverse responses elicited by ancient Cynicism's sexual shameless? ness in a wide range of sixteenth-century French texts. The outrageous performance of the Cynics, including public sex and masturbation, was always designed to provoke questioning of civilized norms. Many texts express disgust at the antics of Diogenes and his followers. The facetious dialogues of Bouchet and Cholieres treat the topic of shamelessness euphemistically. In contrast, Montaigne, in 'L'Apologie de Raimond Sebond', seriously considers the Cynic challenge to normative values, and suggests that Cynicism's commitment to nature shows that the normal definitions of vice and virtue should be inverted, in a daring example of paradiastole. Bodily Detours: Sarah Kofman's Narratives of Childhood Trauma by Kathryn Robson Although psychological trauma has repeatedly been described in terms of the body, the relation between traumatic loss, narrative, and the body requires further elucidation. This article explores how Sarah Kofman's autobiographical texts?Rue Ordener, rue Labat and critically neglected shorter texts?deploy bodily figures to narrate Kofman's own trau? matic childhood as a Jew in Occupied France. Where psychoanalytic theory offers a model of articulating traumatic loss through bodily figures, Kofman's writing mobilizes a different model figured through a corporeal 'double bind' that embodies the difnculty and concomitant necessity of recounting traumatic loss. Decorum and Indecorum in the Seconda redazione of Baldassare Castiglione's Libro del cortegiano by Annick Paternoster Between the Seconda redazione (1520-21) and the third manuscript (1524, published 1528) Castiglione rewrote almost half of the Libro del Cortegiano. Where others have examined changes in socio-political and cultural references, this study focuses on dialogue interaction and on the specific use of decorum in opening and closing sequences of the debate in the Seconda redazione. The rebellious behaviour of several characters and the general concern in Book in to guarantee them a fair and equal treatment point towards an open, informal, hori- zontal type of interaction, which will be swept away by the strict politeness rituals of the Cortegiano.</page><page sequence="2">ABSTRACTS 86l Transition Relevance Places and Overlapping in (Spanish-English) Conversational Etiquette by John Ardila Present-day pragmaticists regard Henk Haverkate's work on conversational etiquette as a momentous insight into politeness studies. In spite of recent endeavours to highlight the socio-pragmatic disparities between Spanish and British politeness models, very little re? search has been conducted into conversational etiquette. This paper seeks to examine different models of conversational etiquette in Spanish and English in order to offer an introduction to turn-taking theory, conduct an empirical analysis of turn-taking in these languages in formal scenarios, and discuss the results within the framework of politeness studies. A Cinema of Contradiction: Picazo's La tia Tula (1964) and the Nuevo Cine Espanol by Sally Faulkner This article argues that the contradictions of the historical context of the apertura, and the industrial context ofthe government's promotion of art cinema, were encoded in the films ofthe Nuevo Cine Espanol, focusing on Miguel Picazo's La tia Tula. Picazo adapts Unamuno's abstract tale to the particular circumstances of 1960s Spain and scrutinizes both Francoist gen? der ideology and his own equivocal experience of artistic freedom yet ideological restraint. Heine's Aristophanes Complex and the Ambivalence of Deutschland: Ein Wintermdrchen by David Pugh This article re-examines the 'new song' from Canto 1 of Deutschland: Ein Wintermdrchen in the light ofthe reference to Aristophanes' Birds in Canto 27. From here it explores a series of statements by Heine in which he proposes that this play holds an esoteric meaning for him concerning humankind's foolish propensity to usurp the place of the gods. An 'Aristophanes complex' comes to light according to which Heine associates himself variously with Peisetaerus (the hero of The Birds), with Aristophanes, and with God himself. The identification of this complex renders problematical Heine's advocacy of humankind's self-deification, while also highlighting the ambivalence in the Wintermdrchen. Light is also east on Heine's religious and political standpoints and his attitude to Hegel. Rilke and the Modern Portrait by Helen Bridge In his 'Briefe uber Cezanne' (October 1907) Rilke expresses a particular fascination with Cezanne's portraits, since the human subject represents the ultimate challenge for an aes? thetic based on objectivity and the autonomy of colour. Reading the poem 'Der Balkon' (Au? gust 1907) in conjunction with the 'Briefe iiber Cezanne' reveals the continuity between Rilke's poetic treatment ofthe human subject under Manet's influence in summer 1907 and the more reflective conclusions he reaches after visiting the Cezanne exhibition. This article explores the consequences that Rilke's engagement with modern portrait-painting has for his poetic technique and his conception of reality. From Chudak to Mudak} Village Prose and the Absurdist Ethics of Evgenii Popov by Jeremy Morris The genealogy of the chudak character type in the shorter fiction of Evgenii Popov is consi? dered. In Shukshin and Village Prose the function of the chudak is found to be paradoxical, expressing both conformist and nonconformist views. Popov's modification ofthe type into the mudak parodies Village Prose and also fulfils an axiomatic principle of non-significance, part of an aesthetic project related to absurdism and the grotesque. In reading Popov's project in terms of Bataillian non-utility, linkage is made to the eccentric characters of Kharms and the holy-fool tradition, while allowing in Popov for an updated function of ethical dissidence in a confext of postmodernity.</page><page sequence="3">862 ABSTRACTS Mouseion: The Counter-Institutional Agent of the Literary Utopias of Ricardo Piglia and Dimitris Kalokyris by Eleni Kefala This article focuses on the function of the topos of the 'museum' in the work of Ricardo Piglia and Dimitris Kalokyris, who have both been greatly influenced by the aesthetic prin? ciples of Jorge Luis Borges. In the case of Piglia, the 'museum' is closely associated with the notion of the memoria ajena, which he considers a fundamental feature of the political reality of twentieth-century Argentina, postmodern culture, and the cultural production of 'peripheral' countries like Argentina. In the case of Kalokyris, the 'museum', along with the notions of the dictionary and encyclopaedia, contests institutional narratives by employ- ing a series of aestheticizing processes. Ultimately, in both cases paradoxically enough the (literary) museum emerges as a supreme deinstitutionalizing power.</page></plain_text>
