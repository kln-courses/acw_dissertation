<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORIGINAL ELEMENTS AND MEDITERRANEAN STIMULI IN IBERIAN POTTERY Ricardo Olmos PART2* THE EXAMPLE OF ELCHE: THE LEVEL OF GREEK IMPORTS The second part of this paper centres upon a consideration of the Iberian painted pottery from the site of Elche in Alicante, and expresses in more concrete form the rather theoretical discussion presented in Part 1. The area around Elche is situated about 25km south of Alicante, not far from Murcia, in the south-east of Spain. It is among the areas of the Iberian peninsula most intensely influenced by Hellenism during the pre-Roman period.1 Simultaneously, Elche was open to Punic trade and cultural elements, and at some stages—for instance at the time of early Hellenism—these contacts appear to have been even closer than those with the Greek world.2 Discoveries of Greek pottery have been made in Elche itself (e.g. at the site called La Alcudia) as frequently as in its surroundings. Found with a number of contemporary imports from East Greece, there is a piece which I consider to be one of the oldest and most significant Greek documents, a small Attic kylix dating from the middle of the 6th century BC. Not unlike Samian cups of the same period, it is decorated on the inside with bands and fillets in diluted glaze (pi. 7:1-2).3 On each side, a painted inscription adorns its handle zone: HO ΠΑΙΣ ΚΑΛΟΣ —'The boy (is) beautiful'—a dedication which fits the personal use of the cup very well.4 The cup belongs to the final moment of Phocaea's expanding commerce with Iberia and Tartessus, and thus corresponds to the Greek presence in the south of the peninsula, for which there is particularly abundant evidence from Huelva.5 However, it could also be seen as being already related to the beginning of the subsequent, secondary trade led by the comptoir of Ampurias, where Western Phocaeans took over the metropolis' business deals.

Herodotus would therefore make good sense when he says (I 163): 'the inhabitants of Phocaea were the first to make long sea-voyages and they were the ones who discovered the Adriatic Sea, the Tyrrhenian, Iberia, and Tartessos'. Given the general way in which the Greek author utilizes the term 'Iberia', could it not be that one of the regions of this Herodotean Iberia corresponds with south-eastern Spain, the area with which we are dealing? It is, after all, one of the most Hellenized parts of the peninsula from the 6th century BC, which is precisely the time when the Phocaeans were sailing along the Spanish coasts with their fast penteconters. Our cup could well be a personal gift, an object that a merchant would offer to introduce himself into a new market. Imports of Attic red-figure pottery into the area, including Portus Illicitanus, El Molar, Cabezo Lucero, Elche, etc., are relatively frequent from the second half of the 5th and especially from the 4th century BC onwards. They are evidence of the vigour with which the Ampuritan traders competed with their Punic counterparts based in Ibiza.6 The vessels of the 5th century are of considerable quality and exhibit shapes which are not common in other sites of the peninsula, such as the amphora with plaited handles and the column-krater, together with the much more frequent bell-krater (pi. 8: l).7 With regard to both their shapes and their decoration, the 5th-century imports have a selective character which points to Ampurias as their distributor. On the other hand, it is much more difficult to establish whether the intermediaries through whom these products reached the zone of Elche in the 4th century were Greeks or Phoenicians. Found at Elche, but now kept in the Archaeological Museum of Madrid, a medallion which has been cut from an Attic red-figure cup features the representation of a duck (fie. I).8 The piece is part of the widespread phenomenon in the Iberian world of the reutilization by the natives of carefully cut fragments.9 It is possible that the common Attic motif of the duck has here been reinterpreted or 'mythologized' and that it anticipates the mythical represent ation of the bird, so popular in Iberian pottery. Also from the area of Elche, though found some kilometres further inland at the fortified Iberian site of Pefia Negra, comes a local imitation of an Attic column-krater.10 Taken together, the two pieces—the original Greek fragment with the duck and the local krater imitating a Greek model—clearly reflect the permeability of part of the native population to Greek fashion and trade.

Large sculptures are based on formal models which are clearly Greek in origin.1 This style must be seen in the context of an élite formed since the 6th century Β C by the classes that control the trade with Greeks and Phoenicians. This period coincides with the introduction of the Iberian alphabet or spelling system, obviously a colonial influence whose spread can surely be attributed to trade.12 In Elche and its surroundings, there is a widespread demand for large sculptures whose repertory is characteristic of aristocratic funeral traditions. Whilst the first sculptures represent fabulous Oriental animals typical of Greek Archaic art, such as the griffin or the sphinx (pi. 8: 3),13 there emerges in a second phase (4th century) a style which includes the representation of warriors—using the heroizing motif of the duel or single combat14—and of harnessed horses.15 All these images are characteristic of the funerary world. Representations of bulls (linked to funeral rites concerned with water and fertility in the nearby necropolis of Cabezo Lucero) are also popular.16 Although the introduction of stone-working techniques and Archaic Greek motifs is to be attributed to craftsmen of Greek origin, both formal and iconographie elements of Punic origin have been traced in a number of important cases, such as the funerary sphinx from the Park of Elche which is mounted by a small figure (pi. 8:3). The group is preceded by a small female figure which gathers in and crosses her wings in front of her body, as is typical of the Carthaginian goddess Tanit.17 A lotus flower decorates the breast of this supposed Tanit, an echo of the well known Punic terracottas from the sanctuary of Es Cuieram at Ibiza. These bell-shaped, schematic representations of the goddess show her draped in her own wings.18 It is most probable then that from earliest times the Iberians amalgamated formal and iconographie influences from various Mediterranean peoples with whom they maintained close commercial contacts, especially the Greeks, through their Phocaean colony at Ampurias, and the Phoenicians, established in Ibiza since the 7th century. This dependence is quite clear when one considers the forms. As for the content, which is what the Iberians really accept and incorporate, the problem is more complex. In any case, the end result is something completely original, and in no way a slavish copy of the Greek or Semitic pantheon. In this process, foreign elements were integrated through very well defined social sectors, i.e. the aristocratic subculture or the local élite which controlled trade.19 In monumental Iberian sculpture of the 4th century we also find the seated divinity, a motif which is widespread throughout the Mediterranean area.20 A good example is 11 Cf.

From a formal point of view, the famous Dama de Elche, traditional paradigm of Iberian art, has a distinctly Greek appearance.21 Until recently its characteristics remained essentially unparalleled, but thanks to a recent find from Cabezo Lucero, a necropolis not far from the site of Elche, it is now possible to gain a better understanding of this work.22 The Iberians used two basic sculptural types to represent female figures in stone: the seated woman, who in her function as mistress supposedly corresponds to the iconography of the goddess or heroic female, and the standing woman whom we can interpret as an offerer. One might conclude that such a perfect binary typology, with the standing offerer active and solicitous, and the recipient seated and solemn, offered no room for other possibilities to be integrated into a simple iconographical system of oppositions. Indeed, the peculiar iconography of the bust of Elche prompted lengthy discussions, especially after the discovery of the seated Lady of Baza (Granada). We now know what already E. Kukahn and A. Blanco had rightly suspected, namely that this Lady does not correspond to either of the two models.23 In the case of the Lady of Elche and the Lady of Cabezo Lucero, both of which are true busts, the goddess is conceived as a divine manifestation, or epiphany, with the veil or sacred mantle framing the face. It is likely that what is meant is an anodos, the representation of the instant when the chthonic divinity arises from the earth to reveal herself in her rich adornments. Here, the contrast is not so much between seated woman (i.e. divine recipient) and standing woman (i.e. offerer). Rather, the contrast relates to the divine world itself: the seated divinity as passive manifestation of the woman in the full solemnity of her being, versus the goddess in fieri, in her becoming, in her unveiling, in her transition. It is precisely this dynamic aspect which is emphasized in the pottery from Elche, as we shall see later. A comprehensive reading, which takes into account the stone sculpture of the Lady of Elche as well as the female busts represented in vase-painting, opens up a new path in iconographical research. It explains from within the structure of Iberian religion what has until now not been seen, because of an excessive concern with hypothetical foreign models—whether Greek or Punic—of the famous sculpture. In the case of the Lady of Cabezo Lucero, found in the Spanish-French excavations in September 1987, the context is funerary. The Lady of Elche, on the other hand, was discovered by chance in La Alcudia in 1897. We know that she was carefully protected with flagstones.24 Yet, because of the chance circumstances of its finding and the early period at which it was found, its probable funerary context has never been clearly confirmed or excluded. Like all divinities, it could even have had an ambiguous double role and belonged to the domains both of the living and of the dead. The enigmatic hole in its torso was conceived to hide, in the very body of the goddess, something very intimate. The discovery in 1971 of the Lady of Baza led to a better understanding of the divinity's function as a receptacle or as an urn. The hollow right side of the Lady of Baza received the ashes of the deceased. We have here the stone metaphor of the maternal womb.25 Also found in the necropolis of the present Park of Elche is the 21 Blanco art. cit. pis. 22-3; Garcia y Bellido op. cit. 45-52 figs. 56-9; id., La Dama de Elche y el conjunto de piezas reingresadas en Espaiia en 1941 (1943). 22 E.

Ramos, rightly points out.26 The bull is a theriomorphic manifestation of the divinity and a symbol much beloved by the Iberians.27 On the other hand, we do not know with certainty what offerings were hidden in the hole of the Lady of Elche's torso—a representation of a goddess which holds in its body what man entrusts her with. These observations will allow us to understand much better the frequent representations of a female head rising amongst flowers in vase-paintings of the subsequent centuries, in Elche of the Iberian-Hellenistic and Roman periods. POTTERY The preceding paragraphs draw attention to the prosperity of the area of Elche in relation to the Mediterranean world. They also make us aware of the paradoxical situation of Iberian pottery which, from an iconographical point of view, flourishes only at a later time, following the zenith of monumental sculpture in the 6th to 4th centuries BC. We have already mentioned the social conditions and their probable impact on the world of the craftsmen, reflected in the conservative technique of Iberian painted pottery. The figured pottery of Elche is associated in shape, style, and iconographie repertory with that of a much wider area, comprising the regions of Alicante and of the inland area of Murcia. We shall retain the convenient term Elche-Archena for this extensive group, and although the following discussion will concentrate on the pottery of La Alcudia de Elche, we shall refer incidentally to examples from other sites which will serve as comparanda. In contrast with developments in the research of Greek or South Italian pottery, there has been hardly any study of painters, groups or workshops in the area of Iberian ceramics, nor any detailed analysis of variations of ornamental decoration.28 This is an area which will have to be developed in the future, as a first step towards a systematization of what is known about the activities in the various local workshops. Only then will it be possible to establish a clear chronology and to investigate the relationship between potters and other craftsmen and the interrelationships between various workshops. Later still the possible stemmata of workshops and craftsmen will have to be established so as to enable the systems of production to be studied. At the same time it will be necessary to examine the areas of circulation and to study commercial expansion in relation to market competition. Research which up until now has focused on pottery will have to be linked in the future with an analysis of territorial distribution and, more generally, with spatial archaeology.29 Given the present state of our knowledge we will omit here questions of chronology and attributions to individual hands and place this pottery in the general context of what we call—using this term in a purely chronological sense—the Hellenistic period of Elche. This period coincides with the flourishing of local figured pottery.30 In the 5th and 4th centuries the decoration of this pottery had been limited to a repertory of 26 Art. cit.

Most of the iconography that we shall see appears to point to the domain of the dead, as in the case of the sculptures. In other sites, such as Archena, pottery with themes very similar to those from Elche has been found in funerary contexts. Yet, at a site like La Alcudia de Elche we must assume that most of the vases come from the settlement rather than from the necropolis. This is confirmed by the typology of the principal forms which point to the domain of the living, such as the large storage jars with lids, in which grain or other solids could be stored.32 The problem of the relationship between iconography and context is not very different from that found in Attic pottery, with its ambiguous imagery and with its themes that can belong at the same time to the domains of both the living and of the dead. In the case of Elche's pottery, the indiscrimination or contextual ubiquity of the images, occurring either in the settlement or in the necropolis, could in itself provide a starting point for its interpretation. The vessels are not conceived exclusively for the dead, unlike the large South Italian, and especially Apulian, vases.33 One of the main qualities of the image in certain ancient cultures including the Iberian, is its polyvalency with regard to both its character and function. Its meaning remains incomplete if we consider it in isolation or in the abstract. It is only revealed through its context and when the complex situation of all the people who are associated with it is taken into account—those who commission it, who produce it, and who convey it.34 We must not forget that the painter works within the framework of the society which, directly or indirectly, demands the products, and it is in this interaction, tacit or open, that the works acquire a concrete meaning. When vessels are made for a specific religious purpose, such as a complex kernos used for libations (pi. 13: 1-2), the close relationship between creation, image, and use is more easily visible than in other cases.35 It may be added that Elche is not an isolated case in the Spanish peninsula. Numerous vases with an apparently funerary iconography have been found in the urban settlement of Numancia, forming a whole polychrome series.36 Life and death continually interact in the thought of the ancients, coexisting without being forced to do so. It is in our modern society, which takes refuge in the apparent security of life, that the existence of death is denied and completely segregated from everyday life.37 ICONOGRAPHIC TYPES: FLOWERS AND ANIMALS It has often been said that three fundamental types of themes can be distinguished: the floral, the faunal, and the frontal female face in the scheme known as 'Pepona'. These decorate the majority of the vases of the Ibero-Hellenistic period from La Alcudia. There are also other, isolated themes which we shall try to integrate into a coherent system, so that they may complement each other and thus acquire a more general meaning. We shall 31 See e.g. Pericot figs. 101, 131, 142, 143, etc. Nordstrôm II 117-41. 32 Pericot 78 fig. 98; Nordstrom II 103-7. 33 See H. Lohmann, Grabmaler auf unteritalischen Va«en (1979). 34 Cf. J.

The central motif which unifies almost all of Elche's pottery is of chthonic character, i.e. the representation of what rises from the earth, the anodos of the various forms of nature's manifestations (figs. 2-4).38 On the other hand and in contrast with the group from Liria in Valencia, which presents narratives as well as some pictures of collective festivities,39 the iconography of the Elche group is definitely symbolic. Only in a few isolated cases do they reflect an actual ritual. We shall see how at times representations of this possible ritual could be understood as actualizations of a more general concept.40 The iconography of the Elche group shows above all a dynamic, variegated world, a world in fieri. Action is an essential ingredient of this pictorial world. The vegetation is exuberant and complements or substitutes the representations of animals or humans. It forms a distinct entity and has its own meaning. It is not mere ornamentation covering the vessel, but is living and growing vegetation, in the Greek sense of φυτά , generating nature. It is therefore fully integrated in symbolic representation which we will try to define below. Sprouting, flowering stems invade the decorative field and end in spirals or secondary flowers. Often they envelop animals or human figures, drawing attention to these figures as they appear.41 They are the expression and symbol of the divine anodos itself, yet they exist also in their own right. They can cover metopes or entire areas. In the latter case their symbolic value is intensified: the floral vegetation is here the substitute, and sometimes just an indication or a token, of the animal or anthropomorphic anodos (pi. 8: 2, 4).42 The animal motif frequently takes the form of a protome which arises from the ground, generally between flowering stems (figs. 2-3, pis. 9: 2; 10: 1; 11: 4),43 though on many occasions the complete animal is represented (pis. 8: 5; 9: l).44 There are two fundamental variants: the long-beaked bird and the so-called carnivore. There is no excessive concern for the realistic representation of the animal world—the emphasis is on its symbolic value. This is why, in the case of the bird, we cannot establish whether it is an eagle or some other bird of prey: it is an ideal, generic representation.45 In the Elche group there is only a handful of examples of bird images which can be identified as particular species.46 Also in the case of the so-called carnivore, the jaws of a wolf Fig. 2.

The aim is not so much at realistically portraying an animal, but at conveying the idea, or feeling, it arouses—in this case, that of terror or of power. In the same way, a generic fish acts as a symbol of the nature of the sea.47 Yet, in vase-painting no specific place is attributed to it as an inhabitant of the water; it is depicted intermixed with the animals of the earth and the air. Symbol of the earth is the rabbit—which is more realistically and closely observed by the Iberian painter—and its opponent, the snake (the two are frequently shown in association).48 The latter is stylized into a curvilinear meander, which on occasion can become a decorative frame. On a large jar in the Municipal Museum of Elche we find it as a living being in the hands of one of the winged goddesses or amongst the animals, and also as a decorative scheme, laterally framing the scene (pi. 15: 1-2).49 The dividing line between the decorative and the symbolic is here, once again, ambiguous. The concept of the space and of the figures themselves is analytical. The most significant features are accentuated expressionistically and left reserved, as, in the case of the bird, the round eye, the claws, and the long beak. The wings, as in all expressionistic art, are usually drawn facing the viewer.50 In the 'carnivore' the 'apotropaic' features are emphasized: the huge jaws, from which the enormous tongue emerges, the double row of long teeth, the claws, and on the belly the unrealistic and geometrical representation of the ribs. It is the prototype of the hungry and ravenous beast (pi. 9: 2).51 47 See Nordstrom II 160-1. 48 See ibid. 151 for the rabbit, 154 for the snake.

Often, as is the case here with the birds, the animal is identified with the flower itself from which it emerges, pecking at it (fig. 2, pi. 8: 5).53 The same motif occurs in other Mediterranean wares, for instance in that of South Italy in the 4th century BC or of Hellenistic Cales.54 The combined representation of the animals reflects a vital world of opposites. The concept which they express is not that of a static nature. In this sense they reveal an archaic concept of the world, with opposing forces which are beyond human control. It is true that the confrontation between these animals is usually latent rather than direct; they issue threats, they inspire terror, they pursue each other—but they never devour each other and rarely attack each other (pis. 11: 1; 15: 1-2). This fact also reflects a general aspect of the pictorial conception itself: Iberian painters represent mainly planes and only to a lesser extent volumes. They treat the wall of a vase as a surface and are not concerned with the illusionistic representation of perspective. When they have occasion to depict a scene with depth, as on the vase showing a goddess with two horses (pi. 12: 2), they resolve the problem by practically reducing the volume to a single plane.55 For this reason representations in which one figure overlaps another, are very rare. They are practically limited to the inevitable motif of the rider on horseback (pi. 17: 2). This is a scheme that creates certain difficulties for the painter since he has to depict at one and the same time the rider's leg and the horse's body. The solution usually adopted is to leave in a light colour the best defined and individualized element—in this case the rider's leg which contrasts with the dark silhouette of the horse.56 If the superimposition of two figures can be avoided, it usually is.57 This accentuates the analytical vision of the pottery: each animal remains enclosed in its own sphere, coexisting with the others. Nature is thus expressed as an infinite juxtaposition of these individualities. Order amid apparent multiplicity arises precisely out of the unbridled violence originating in each element, in each individual. It is a cosmos created by the tension between opposites. ICONOGRAPHIC TYPES: REPRESENTATIONS OF HUMAN FIGURES Representations of human figures constitute the third variable in the iconographie world of Elche. Female representations predominate, but in no way reflect the real world of the Iberian woman. We hardly find a glimpse of Iberian daily life, not even with regard to festive or cultural manifestation. As a possible exception, and a rather doubtful one, we should mention a fragment of a plastic vase from La Alcudia de Elche, possibly a perfume flask, made from a mould and then painted, with the representation of two figures reclining on a couch (pi. 11: 2).58 The figure on the right holds a cup in the left hand, whilst the right arm is raised as if it were to embrace the companion by the shoulder. Only the lower part of the face is extant, including the neck, and it could be that of a female figure, 52 H. Obermaier-C. W. Heiss, Ipek 1929, 56ff. pl. 12; Garcia y Bellido figi.

Its frontality would thus accentuate the relief of the vessel itself. If this is the case, and there is no certainty about it, we would have the representation of a symposium with a woman, which would bring us close to the Italic world. The technique of the vessel as well as its theme point to its being an isolated imitation and it is doubtful therefore whether it allows any deeper interpretation. With the possible exception of this fragmentary and doubtful example, Elche's feminine world is always represented in the realm of the divine. The man/woman duality is expressed practically only in this relationship: female divinity on the one hand, male, in generally heroic representations, on the other. So it is the image of the goddess, not of the woman, that appears as the social cohesive in this figurative world of Iberian society. Within this representation of the female we find the same polarity which we observed in the animal world: on the one hand, there is the motif of the protome which arises like a flower, on the other the complete figure, i.e. the female seen in its final realization. The bust that emerges is generally facing the viewer, but it can also be shown in profile.59 The frontal face, the picture known as 'Pepona', is related directly with the viewer; it is another means of dynamic expression—vase and owner—comparable to the interaction between animals we have observed above (pi. 10: 1-2). Here, it is the god who establishes the relationship with man, with the Iberian, and with ourselves. Through this anthropomorphic, yet monstrous and grotesque, image the Iberians who look at themselves as they look at the vase, are drawn into this variegated universe of nature.60 The frontal face of the goddess fulfills then not only a social, but a cosmic, intercessory function. Beside the paradox of this archaic language, the Iberians nevertheless share in a religious feeling which was very widespread throughout the Hellenistic Mediterranean world. As against remote and distant divinities, Hellenism brought the gods closer to the humans, made them έπήκοοι , i.e. ready to listen to humans, and emphasized pathos and sentiment in the representation of the gods. These Iberian masks of frontal faces share in this Mediterranean communication which the Punic inhabitants of Ibiza also knew, as did the Ampurians with their marble statue of their healing god Asclepius, leaning slightly to listen to them.61 Yet, from an iconographie point of view, the Iberian frontal face is still part of the Archaic tradition of the Gorgo image. On one of the large kalathoi from La Alcudia we see a clear formal adoption of the old Greek motif: the round face, the symmetrically divided hair framing the face, the flat nose represented in several horizontal planes, and the semicircle of the smiling tongue in the characteristic 'aprotropaic* grimace of the Gorgo. Yet the face is at the same time a flower: the chin turns into a pointed chalice on which the sepals are indicated (pi. 10:1-2).62 The metamorphosis of the goddess into a flower is made perfectly clear and with it the thematic unity of the whole. The goddess is an integral part of the whole—created by the very nature over which she presides.63 59 See A. Fernindez de Avilés, Ampuriaj 6, 1946, 162-72; Pericot figs. 115, 154 (face in profile view), 127, 138, 151 (frontal head); Garcia y Bellido fig. 572. 60 For these ideas, cf. J.-P.

In fact, the handles are structurally superfluous. They perform a purely ornamental and symbolic function. The arc which they describe demarcates and accentuates the roundness of the goddess's face. Just like the temple that guards the sacred image, this is the most protected place on the vase, in opposition to the open space where the dynamic world of nature unfolds. The face justifies the existence of the handles, not vice versa. Again we find ourselves facing an Archaic motif, for this association—frequent as it is in the pottery of Elche—is the relic of a more ancient situation. The position of the 'Hathoric' head below the handles is documented on some Iberian bronze trays of the 4th century BC, for instance in Baza (Granada).64 Following E. Kukahn's suggestion,65 one could establish the stemma of the motif throughout the Mediterranean basin, especially in its eastern parts, reaching back to the protohistorical era. However, it is not our intention to dwell on the bottomless well of parallels and antecedents. We prefer to examine how the motifs are structured within the Ibero-Hellenistic world of Elche, that is, in what way they can be understood as reflections of its ideological world. On another example, a large cauldron, the bust appears in profile and with wings, also below the handles, whilst huge floral stems sprout on either side (pi. 11: 3-4).66 It is a goddess with long hair whose elongated neck is adorned with a necklace. We are thus getting close to one of the possible formal models of the motif represented here. Fig. 4. Madrid, Archaeological Museum: Iberian jar from Archena (Murcia), found in the necropolis of Villaricos (Almeria). Female head (anodos) between florals (drawing S. Gonzalez). 1:2. The representation on the neck of a jar, probably from the Archena workshop, suggests that the prototype of these images can be interpreted as an anodos (fig. 4).67 The female head in profile emerges between flowers, but as it emerges, it slightly raises its face towards the sky, in the characteristic gesture of the τόν ούραι&gt;όν eioiSeiv, so well known from Attic and South Italian, especially Apulian, anodoi representations.68 The vase was among the offerings found in a tomb at Villaricos in Almeria, an Iberian necropolis which is situated next to a Punic cemetery. This reflects the importance of the site with regard to commercial transactions and interchange between the two 64 Presedo op. cit.

It is thus very possible that the Iberians came here into close contact with the religious world of the colonists: Phoenicians were frequently buried with these images, generally found on small Greek red-figured lekythoi, so abundant during the 4th century BC in the cemeteries of Ibiza. 69 Could the vessel from Archena have been commissioned? Is it, as I have postulated in a recent study, a 'bespoken vase' in which a Mediterranean model is being imitated?70 The problem of chronology remains. Since imports of this motif date from the 4th century BC, and the pottery of Elche-Archena is of a later date, our vase could not be earlier than the 3rd century at the earliest. It is an example of time lag in a peripheral area. In any case, it is significant for our iconographie discussion that the picture of the goddess is to be found in the same place, i.e. on the neck of ajar, where rising protomai of a 'carnivore* or of other birds frequently appear. In the example from Villaricos, the protomai have been substituted for the first time by a female bust. In all three cases we are therefore dealing with different realizations of a similar idea. In the case of the 'carnivore' or the eagle, it is a theriomorphic manifest ation of the anodos\ in the case of the woman, an anthropomorphic substitution through a probable formal Mediterranean, or more specifically Greek, influence. Let us look now at other examples of these formal stimuli in the representation of the female divinity, this time portrayed as a complete figure. On one side of a large amphora with triple handles, framed by serpentiform meanders that emphasize the chthonic content of the scene (pi. 12: 1), the goddess is represented in her entirety, as potnia theron, standing on tiptoe and associated with the theriomorphic world that surrounds her. With her right hand, she grasps one of the birds.71 The painter has not drawn her left arm because it is not essential to the narrative: it suffices to have the long necked bird hovering around with a branch in its beak to indicate that the aerial space belongs to the goddess. Also within her ambit are the fish and the rabbit at her feet, as well as the frontal rosettes which, as we shall see below, are a symbol of her presence. The Archaizing details of her dress indicate another probable formal Mediterranean influence: the goddess wears a tunic with a kolpos and an apoptygma, wrapped just beneath her breast in the Italo-Greek fashion. To judge from votive offerings, this dress was unknown in the Iberian world. This suggests that the vase-painter had an Archaizing cult-statue in mind, dressed in the prestigious Greek fashion. A further example of the formal influence by Greek models on this iconography is provided by the so-called potnia hippon represented on the main side of a large jar from Elche (pi. 12: 2).72 The goddess, portrayed here with wings, is shown again in a frontal scheme. She extends her hands to two horses that in heraldic fashion turn their heads towards her, an expression of their belonging to her domain, of their submission. They are not common horses, but sacred animals. Their large wings which reach from the ground (only one on each horse is shown unfolded) and the characteristics of their heads suggest again an anodos. The goddess does not appear alone, but in the company of the divine chariot. Although the lower part of her body has been lost, she cannot have been represented as a complete figure, for the bodies of the horses appear to be joined to the goddess as if to form a hollow that frames and contains the divine anodos.™ F.

What appears more interesting to us is to examine the imitative process with regard to the form. The goddess is dressed in a short-sleeved tunic girdled just below the breast. This is precisely how a charioteer is dressed in Greek representations. Our vase-painting represents a hierophany, the dynamic representation of a goddess emerging from the underworld in her horse-drawn chariot. She does not even touch the reins as she rises effortlessly, attended by her horses which are mindful of their mistress, the goddess. It is enough for her, as dea otiosa, just to show herself. Following the analysis of these examples, we can then propose that the Iberian religious image acquires human form and expression under the influence of Greek iconography. We have seen that it accepts and integrates the Mediterranean motif of the Gorgo, especially popular in Southern Italy, the face associated with the flower, either as a metamorphosis of the latter into the former, or as a goddess of the flower-stems, as a Rankengôttin.7Î We have also seen the adoption of the Archaic image of the goddess with the peplos or of her hierophany as a charioteer. They are probably variations or particular realizations of a common religious idea that the Iberians synthesize and recreate partially under Greek, South Italian, or even Punic influences. In a similar way, we have seen how in previous centuries monumental funerary sculpture adopted a Greek idiom. Yet the question remains of the extent to which content is introduced together with the image, or whether the contribution relates only to the form, i.e. whether the Iberian artists dress their religious concepts in foreign robes. It would be difficult to postulate the introduction ex novo of a sacred motif, of a divinity alien and strange to the Iberian world, solely as a result of colonial influence, especially in view of the fact that this motif finds such widespread acceptance in the Ibero Hellenistic pottery of the south-east. In our hypothetical reconstruction of the process we have to suppose rather that the Greek idiom is chosen to express a religious content which is latent in the indigenous world. The innovation lies in the introduction of the anthropomorphic representation, which must be considered revolutionary in a traditional way of thinking as markedly an aniconic as the Iberian. And yet, the introduction of the new image transforms the previous iconographie structure and with it the original religious content itself. Therefore, the anthropomorphic image is in itself an affirmation of a religious content which could not have existed before as such. That is to say, the image itself creates myth, manifests it, and defines it. Aetiologically, the process is not so much from myth to its representation as the reverse, producing a complex process of gestation in which one feeds the other. It can thus be seen as a dialectical syncretism. A small kernos (pi. 13: 1-2) which has been studied by several scholars, might provide a good example to synthesize the subject.76 Three small pierced amphorae could receive the various liquid offerings which through a small fourth vessel would finally 74 F.

On the inside of the bowl we find the image of the goddess receiving the libation, her frontal face richly adorned with necklaces and ear-rings. The divine anodos is, once again, inseparable from the world of the animals that surrounds it in the form of birds, rabbits, and fish. The small vase is a microscosmos in itself. The act of offering a libation, which essentially consists of pouring a sacred liquid on the earth, is here carried out on the earth goddess herself who looks at us and on whom we look back. We do not know whether the three small vertical vessels that intercommunicate through the supporting ring (also decorated with images of this floral and animal world) were used by a single officiant pouring three different liquids, or rather by three people placing their offerings in them, as representatives of three family groups joining together in the ritual. In the room where the kernos was found there was also a perfume bottle with a rounded belly and a narrow mouth, as well as an imported terracotta thymiaterion decorated with mould-made protomai?1 The presence of this set in the settlement poses anew the question of the character of the cult practised here. There is no doubt that we are in the presence of a chthonic ritual. It is very possible that this ritual, as in so many other places in the Mediterranean, is invested also with a funerary meaning. Another possibility, to which P. Stengel has drawn attention for the Greek world, is that the differences between the chthonic and funeral cults are secondary rather than primary.78 Suffice it to recall the ritual of the Panspermia in Athens, with the offerings of seeds to chthonic Hermes during the celebration of the Anthesteria, or the day of the Chytrai, a festival of originally funeral character.79 Such an interpretation would justify with new arguments the presence of apparently funerary imagery in the settlement of La Alcudia. We have spoken so far about Hellenizing Mediterranean influences in a particular interpretation of forms, gestures, and even cult objects. It is also certain that a similar comparative argument could be advanced in relation to the Punic world. In the historiographical section we have cited some studies already pointing in this direction. There exist several vase-paintings from Elche which have often been interpreted as images of the goddess Tanit.80 Despite my scepticism about these religious, and to some degree mechanistic, equations, I do not deny that there was considerable Punic influence in the transmission of many of the Greek motifs to the Iberian world. In Elche of the Hellenistic period we find, as in many other sites along the Iberian coast, the well-known imported terracotta thymiateria which show the bust of a chthonic fertility goddess, crowned with ears of grain and fruits (pi. 14: l).81 In the Greek sphere this chthonic goddess would be identifiable with a divinity belonging to Demeter's circle. In the Punic world, from which this image spread commercially into the Western Mediterranean, it can be identified with Tanit. In the context of Elche I believe that this imported image fits in perfectly with the local chthonic divinity which we have been analysing. The combination of the iconographie elements is the same: bust, anodos, frontality, birds, direct association with nature's fertility, etc. It is quite possible that the process of syncretism became a customary phenomenon, whereby the prestige inherent in the imported object could act as a stimulus for the creation and fulfilment of the local image. This is not a new intrusion from the Punic world. Already in the monumental sculpture 77 Ramoi Folqués loc. cit. 78 Opferbrâuche der Griechen (1910, repr. 1972) 144. 79 \ See Kossatz-Deissmann art. cit 232 (with bibl.). S0 Cf. Part I n. 14. 81 M* J.

There are other representations on vases that may reflect the same formal influence. A large amphora in the Municipal Museum of Elche is dominated by the full figure of the winged goddess who is surrounded by rosettes and an abundant vegetation which springs from her.82 She wears a bell-shaped dress reminiscent of Punic terracottas, and like those, she has no feet. Her dress is decorated with a four-petalled flower which on many other vase-paintings from Elche indicates, as a single motif, the goddess's presence.83 On the neck of a large jar in the Municipal Museum of Elche we have the representation of two winged figures facing each other and surrounded by animals (pi. 15: 1-2).84 These figures have been associated with the Punic Tanit. There are two clearly defined zones on the vase, the neck and the belly, separated by a moulding. As on other vases from Elche which can be 'read' horizontally, a 'vertical reading' reveals that the two zones complement each other iconographically. The lower zone shows an animal hierophany, with two large birds facing each other among floral stems. On the wing of one of them is a snake. In the upper frieze, the theophany is anthropomorphic and shows, uniquely in Elche, an almost symmetrical arrangement of two winged figures facing each other. They correspond, as female divinities, to the confronting animals on the belly of the vase. Both women are closely associated with a bird. The bird on the left is perched on the divine hand. The figure on the right, however, grasps a snake by its tail. A large snake also coils around a rabbit that is crouching on the ground between both women. The symbols correspond perfectly with those on other representations where a single anthropomorphic figure is dominant. It we accept the well known theory, we must assume that this representation of two figures is part of the same religious sphere to which the other vase-paintings belong. Here, however, the presence of the chthonic divinity is understood as confrontation, as difference, as tension between opposites, and not as a single goddess or force, as in the kemos. They are, I believe, diverse attempts preceding an incipient human depiction of the sacred; ambiguity then seems inevitable. The same vase shows, moreover, the very close association that exists between the winged figure and the animal. The boundaries between the different types of symbols are not very clear. The same idea can be expressed in different ways. Inversely, the symbol only acquires its precise meaning in its contextual relationship. Sometimes the goddess is herself vegetation, as on a large amphora in the Municipal Museum of Elche (pi. 14: 2). At other times she represents also the animal world. On the 'Pepona vase', for instance, the protome of the carnivore underneath the handles appears right beside the goddess as if both formed part of an inseparable whole (pis. 9: 2; 10: l).85 We have already stated that the symbols mutually define each other's role. Here again, they express the fertile and contradictory multiformity of nature. Metamorphosis itself can have multiple aspects. It is not limited to the transformation of flowers into human faces, as seen in the case of the 'Pepona-Gorgo'.

Menacing wolf-heads frame the panel on both sides of the goddess, emphasizing that she belongs to this animal world. It is an ambiguous realm, transitory as all metamorphosis is. We have already observed that on many occasions the image of the goddess is substituted by her vegetal symbol which, as Kukahn saw in 1962, is expressed by the rosette.87 It is always associated with the goddess's epiphany and occasionally has the privilege to occupy the divinity's place under the arch of the handles (pi. 15: 3). Like the face, it appears at times as a simple rosette, while at others it is winged (pi. 15: 4).88 The wings convey the supernatural and sacred character of all these images. On other occasions the wings are schematized or substituted by volutes on both sides of the flower, possibly also to suggest snakes.89 Like that of the goddess, the epiphany of the rosette is also linked to the exuberant world of branches and the animal world. On the kalathos described above, a wolf with enormous open jaws protects the handle beneath which the divine flower springs up (pi. 15: 3).90 On the large open vase from La Alcudia which we have already examined in relation to the winged head under the handles, the anodos of an eagle is shown in one of the panels, and behind it a rosette with winged volutes appears (pi. 11: 3-4).91 On this vase, as on the kalathos of the ascending eagle and the winged rosette, an insistence, an overcharacterization or symbolic emphasis underlines the multiple manifestations of a single idea. The study of these vases will therefore have to take the interchangeability of decorative schemes into account. The various combinations of elements constitute variations in the realization of one single concept. Once the latter is defined—for which accurate cataloguing is a prerequisite92—we shall be able to understand better the apparent exceptions to this concept. A case in point is provided by a fragment of a large jar from La Alcudia with a procession of male figures walking to the left with branches in their hands.93 They are Fig. 5.

We have here a cult scene, one of the few motifs clearly associated with a ritual in a pottery which is otherwise primarily concerned with symbolic expressions. On a kalathos from La Alcudia the same goddess holds the ritual branches in her hands (pi. 16: l).94 The human scene then could be interpreted as an imitatio dei, i.e. as a festival of men who are recalling the sacred anodos with their ritual march. REPRESENTATIONS OF SINGLE MALE FIGURES R. Ramos Fernândez has recently studied two vases with an apparently anomalous iconography: the first shows a youth and a so-called dragon, the second a man on foot with his horse.95 Let us try to see them under the new light of integration. The vase with the youth and the 'dragon', held in the Museum of La Alcudia, is an amphora with triple handles (pi. 16: 3).96 The fight between the hero and the monster is represented on the obverse. The scene takes place against the background of an immense floral landscape. On the reverse, towards the left-hand side, a great bird of the eagle type, but incomplete, turns its head to peck at a flower. Below the base of each of the handles are rosettes, one with four petals, the other frontal. The elements of the obverse seem to fit very well with the iconographie structure which we have seen thus far. As a peculiar feature the image of a man confronting the monster is shown. The hero is a beardless youth with long hair that falls in individual curls. He is dressed in a short tunic, brandishes a spear and grasps the monster by its enormous tongue. He is characterized not so much by his exceptional strength—nothing in the image seems to indicate this—as by his daring and his courage. He would fit well in the mould of folklore's 'trickster'. The monster, on the other hand, corresponds to the archetype of the devourer; its body and especially its jaws are immense. On its belly, ribs have been drawn, geometricized and indicating its innards. Both the individualization of the hero confronting the dragon and the striking disproportion between the scale of the human and that of the supernatural are significant. The theme corresponds to a widespread and universal motif of the initiation rite. The confrontation between the two opponents must therefore take place in isolation. The individual monsters exist, in the words of Peter von Blanckenhagen, only 'in order to offer potential heroes the occasion to prove their heroic mettle'.97 This large vase from La Alcudia is not an isolated example. A fragment from Albertini's excavations in 1905, now in the collection of the University of Bordeaux, shows the same sequence: a youth confronting a monster (fig. 6).9i In this case the beard is already apparent in the shape of five small individual lines on the boy's face. The theme can be seen in other variations, as on a fragment from Tossal de Manises, in Alicante: the monster confronts a rider who is holding a palm in his right hand (fig. 7)." Both man and horse start back in fear. Beneath the horse, there is again an allusion to the world of nature: two rabbits are sniffing the ground.

The devouring wolf acts in the Iberian world as a monster who mediates between the realm of the living and that of the dead. The same eschatological idea is to be found on a silver patera of the first century BC from Santisteban del Puerto in Jaén. Here, the large wolf's head regurgitates the man from the entrails into the world of the hereafter.101 The image is ambiguous, as in all myths of transition: the monster is devouring or regurgitating what he has devoured, depending on the point of view from which we see the action. Thus, on a fragment from La Alcudia the huge wolf jaws opened to devour or to regurgitate the fallen warrior—of whom we see nothing more than the legs with their elegant boots (pi. 16: 2). Again, we have in all these examples a universal concept, well known throughout the Mediterranean.102 It is not just an isolated motif which has been introduced conveniently or capriciously, but one which fits perfectly in the iconographie model of the Iberian world. The second motif studied by Ramos occurs on a large amphora with three vertical handles from La Alcudia de Elche which depicts a man on foot leading his horse by the reins (pi. 17: l).103 The form of the vessel is not exceptional, and there are other examples from La Alcudia that show how the pictures of the three panels complement each other. One of the examples that is stylistically particularly close has in its three panels a carnivore amongst large flowers turning to the right, an eagle in a similar position, and lastly one large flower arising from the centre to spread symmetrically over both sides.104 On the amphora with the man and his horse, the other two panels show the scheme with which we are already familiar. One depicts the eagle pecking at a flower, the other has large flowers and two metopes with four-petalled rosettes. In the case of the male '00 A.

Particularly relevant are Hellenistic grave stelai on which the heroized male figure is shown on its journey to the underworld. A relief from Jâvea has been cited among the possible models.105 We do not know in our case, if the male who is leading the horse is its master, its friend, its mate, its companion, or its groom. He is wrapped in his cloak and wears a festive, pointed hat and elegant boots with the ends of the laces carefully drawn. Towards the left, a bird flies in the same direction as the walkers. Once again, the important task consists of documenting the possible formal borrowing and of showing how it has been integrated in the Iberian ideology. In the section on sculpture we have already alluded to the horse as a funerary image. Unmounted horses, sometimes saddled as in our case, constitute the decoration on Iberian funeral monuments in the province of Albacete, in the hinterland of this area of south-eastern Spain.106 They allude simultaneously to the death and social status of the buried person. Besides, the representation on the amphora is not foreign to the iconographical world of the pottery from Elche. It joins the floral and animal images to which we have referred so many times. We have also seen the incorporation of the horse in this divine world.107 The foreign Mediterranean model has surely served here, too, to introduce another new anthropomorphic image in the symbolic world of the Iberians. The novelty is incorporated into the old scheme, both transforming it and being itself transformed. In this way we could include other readings, for instance that of the image of the rider on his horse (pi. 17: 2), at times in the heroic context of the hunt, at others armed with a spear, but always isolated, in a heroizing representation. This image is represented on both sides of a large jar from La Alcudia.108 The rider is accompanied by the usual retinue of animals—rabbits, birds, and fish, which belong to the realm of the goddess. Nor are rosettes usually lacking in these scenes, including those with winged volutes, placed beneath the horse's belly, which associate the hero with the supernatural and the divine world; clearly, they are not scenes of everyday life.109 In some cases we can even think of an ascensus, the ride that relates the warrior to the superior world. These are the examples so far. We think that this path of enquiry can be fruitful if we widen iconographical research to include the other workshops of the east and south east coasts of Spain. We prefer this 'integrating approach' to those erudite but interminable searches for parallels and references which, in a unifying comparativism, level everything by applying to the past sterile categories of our modern era. The Iberians, just like the Greeks or the Etruscans, were their own people—a tautology which for all its simplicity is at times important to remember.
