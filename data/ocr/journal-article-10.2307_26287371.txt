<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM BLACK MARXISM TO INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM: RACIAL AND ECOLOGICAL CRISIS IN WILLIAM ATTAWAY'S BLOOD ON THE FORGE John Claborn Known for its tragic portrayal of the early-twentieth-century Great Migration, William Attaway's 1941 novel Blood on the Forge follows in the naturalist and black Marxist tradition of Richard Wright's Native Son (1940). As critic Philip H. Vaughan rightly assesses, one of the novel's central conflicts is the "clash between pastoral and industrial-urban living" (424) as it "becomes an angry repudiation of industrial life as destructive to human values" (422). Employing both naturalism and pastoralism to dramatize this clash, Attaway curiously breaks out of these two representational modes through his use of a relatively minor secondary character named Smothers, a prophetic spokesman for the earth's pain: "[0]ne of the men whispered that Smothers was off his nut. Yet they listened and heard a different sort of tale: 'It's wrong to tear up the ground and melt it up in the furnace. Ground don't like it. It's the hell-and-devil kind of work'" (52-53). His legs dismembered in a brutal steel mill accident, Smothers's shrill prophecies are the product of wisdom gained through suffering, of a heightened sense of what the ground feels as it is mined, smelted, M/s MFS Modem Fiction Studies, Volume 55 number 3, Fall 2009.

FROM BLACK MARXISM TO INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM: RACIAL AND ECOLOGICAL CRISIS IN WILLIAM ATTAWAY'S BLOOD ON THE FORGE John Ciaborn</page><page sequence="2">Ciaborn 567 and made into steel. Because he brings an ecological perspective to the ethical and ontological relations among worker, machine, and earth, his character appears on the literary scene as an enigma not only for the Great Migration narrative, but also, perhaps, all of early twentieth-century African American literature. This article explores this strange anomaly of Smothers and the ecological themes of Blood on the Forge. Literary critics have acknowledged the importance of Smothers for articulating the novel's twin themes of machinic violence per formed on worker and land. Edward Margolies goes the furthest in this direction when he conflates Smothers's worldview with Attaway's, arguing that the novel condemns "a kind of greed that manifests itself as a violence to the land, a transgression of Nature" (xiv). Yet no critic has fully explored its ecological themes, nor asked why a novel published in 1941 and set in 1919 should so strongly antici pate the various environmentalist movements that hit mainstream American cultural and political discourse in the 1960s. Perhaps this marginalization is due partly to the novel's critical reception and clas sification as African American fiction, a category typically perceived as tackling social injustices rather than environmental causes.1 Alan Wald reads the novel within the political context of the late 1930s, calling Attaway a black Marxist "whose exertions were aimed in part at educating the white labor movement about the corrosive costs of continued racial chauvinism" (282). Wald cites Attaway's involve ment with the Communist Party as evidence for his strong political commitments, though Blood on the Forge reveals more an analyst of race and capitalism than a propagandist supplying cultural weapons for an American October Revolution. We never see in Blood on the Forge the triumph of racial ac commodation and assimilation, or the awakening of class conscious ness. Set in 1919, when World War I had cut off migratory flows from Europe and thus depleted the pool of cheap immigrant labor in northern industrial cities, the novel follows the three Moss brothers Big Mat, Chinatown, and Melody—as they migrate from the Jim Crow South to the industrial wasteland of western Pennsylvania. As his torian Carole Marks pinpoints in her analysis of the Great Migration, northern steel mill employers saw that if they could maintain the influx of racially diverse labor, they could rely on perpetual conflict to undermine organized labor (15). The narrative ends tragically with one brother dead, another blinded by a mill explosion, and the third with an injured hand that prevents him from "slick[ing] away" his blues on the guitar (1). The two surviving brothers catch a train ride farther north to Pittsburgh proper, each feeling uncertain about his future. Attaway's protest is bleak, even nihilistic, but it does testify</page><page sequence="3">568 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem to the singular experience of workers who might otherwise be lost in a Chicago School sociologist's or proletarian novelist's progressive narrative of racial assimilation: the Moss brothers do not pass through stages on life's way toward unionization. Great Migration narrative, naturalism, pastoralism (or anti pastoralism), the 1930s literary Left, and black Marxism: all of these frames, of course, help to illuminate the novel, but they also tend to downplay its central figuration of ecological degradation. Building on these critical frameworks, this article argues that Blood on the Forge both complicates and radicalizes the Great Migration narrative and black Marxism by engaging in the same problematic as 1930s ecological discourses. This 1930s problematic consists of questions concerning the short-term and long-term effects of human activity on local and global ecosystems; thus, it focuses on the interaction between social and environmental history. Such an analysis of the novel requires a historical method that folds together its setting—the Pittsburgh area during the Red Summer of 1919—with its late Great Depression publication in 1941. The first half of this article, then, situates Blood on the Forge alongside a paradigm shift within 1930s scientific ecology—a shift partly demanded by human-made ecologi cal catastrophes like the Dust Bowl. In 1935, botanist Arthur Tansley defined the "ecosystem" concept, which signified ecology's turn away from an organismic model of environments and toward what historian Donald Worster calls a more materialist "energy-based economics of nature" (Nature's Economy 306). As I will show, the shared materialist ontology of Marx's philosophy and ecosystem ecology enfolds Blood on the Forge's black Marxism with its ecological vision; its ecology is internal to and inseparable from its radical politics. My subsequent reading of the novel examines how it refracts the highly industrialized and polluted Pittsburgh of 1919 through this materialist ontology, in the process not only paralleling but also participating in 1930s ecological discourses by linking ecological degradation to racial conflict and exploitative labor policies. The last section of this article focuses on how Blood on the Forge develops an ecological ethic that anticipates conservationist Aldo Leopold's "land ethic." For Leopold, the land ethic encapsulates conservationist values, for it "changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it" ("The Land Ethic" 240). Attaway's ecological ethic, on the other hand, focuses more on race, labor, and industrial capitalism than conservation per se; his ethic comes packaged primarily in the form of Smothers, who gives voice to what he calls the earth's "feelin" (53).</page><page sequence="4">Ciaborn 569 1930s Ecology: Arthur Tansley and the Ecosystem Concept 1930s natural disasters arid large-scale industrial pollution conspired with urban infrastructural problems and economic inequali ties to amplify the havoc, urging ecologists like Tansley to consider the blurred distinctions between economics and ecology, between human-made and natural disaster. For instance, the Dust Bowl made the Great Depression as much an ecological as an economic catastro phe. Beginning on April 4th, 1934, a large cloud of dust—nicknamed the "black blizzard"—swarmed out of Texas and dumped millions of tons of dirt on major cities ranging from Chicago to Washington, DC (Worster, Dust Bowl 221). Partly the product of drought, more the bad karma of decades of poor farming practices that depleted the soil, the Dust Bowl was, according to Worster, the "inevitable outcome of a [capitalist] culture that deliberately, self-consciously, set itself the task of dominating and exploiting the land for all it was worth" (4). Like the Joads in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (1939), poor farmers' families—Dust Bowl refugees—were forced to travel west for work (Merchant 106). The Dust Bowl's impact, like its origins, was as social as it was environmental; some ecologists were inspired by this confluence. For example, Paul Sears, author of the Dust Bowl history Deserts on the March, later wrote about the crucial social function of ecology as a method for shaping human and natural environments in his 1939 Life and Environment (129). Closer to the setting of Attaway's novel, this social-environ mental confluence also erupts in Pittsburgh's 1936 St. Patrick's Day Flood, which exposed the consequences of poor urban planning. Over the course of two days in March 1936, heavy downpours added to rapidly melting snow raised the city's water levels to forty-six feet: nearly twice the height of flood stage levels. Trolleys, cars, and many homes were completely submerged or uninhabitable; some 15,000 people were marooned throughout the city (Lorant 359). When the waters receded, approximately 135,000 people had lost their homes, sixty were dead, and hundreds injured; the city suffered $150 to $200 million in property damage (370). This disaster revealed how regional planning and natural forces are especially intertwined in the unique geography of the Pittsburgh region. Situated where the Allegheny River from the north and the Monongahela River from the south converge to form the Ohio River, Pittsburgh had always left itself exposed to flood dangers. In fact, the city saw eleven major floods between 1832 and 1907 (Smith 8). In 1908, the city's Chamber of Commerce appointed a Flood Commission to assess the danger and develop a mitigation plan that would call for multiple protective</page><page sequence="5">570 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem measures, most notably the construction of nine flood control dams north of the city in the Upper Ohio River Valley. But on attempting to implement the plan in 1912, a conflict arose between the United States Congress and the city's local Corps of Engineers, who were wary of federal involvement in regional affairs (Kleppner 171). In an unpublished 1928 report, the Corps of Engineers secretly concluded that it would be more profitable to sustain flood losses than to build the dams (Smith 17). Moreover, the US Congress stated that it would provide federal funding for the dam project only if it aided river navi gation (14). After thirty years of gridlock and cost-benefit analyses, the Congress passed the federal Flood Control Act of 1936 and finally approved the plan in June of that same year, three months after the disastrous Saint Patrick's Day flood (Lorant 370). Disasters like the Dust Bowl and the 1936 Pittsburgh Flood accelerated scientific ecology's rise to prominence in the popular mind throughout the 1930s. By the start of the 1930s, ecology was already an established academic discipline in the United States, cen tered in Midwestern universities like Nebraska, Chicago, and Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where Attaway studied creative writing and took his degree in 1936 (Wald 281). Most of these schools borrowed their vocabulary from Frederick Clements, whose ideas are significant because they represent the paradigm from which fellow ecologist Ar thur Tansley broke in 1935. A botanist at the University of Nebraska, Clements published the highly influential study Plant Succession: An Analysis of the Development of Vegetation in 1916. As Worster sum marizes, "Change upon change became the inescapable principle of Clements's science. Yet he also insisted stubbornly and vigorously on the notion that the natural landscape must eventually reach a vaguely final climax stage" (Nature's Economy 210). Clementsian discourse reflected an ontology grounded in late-nineteenth-century philo sophical holism and organicism; he conceived of plant formations as organs within a "super-organism," as productive citizens functioning on behalf of a "community." These communities follow developmental stages known as "successions," which move toward a "climax state" or a final point of balance and stability (209-20). All the individual members seem to work harmoniously for the community, ushering it toward its highest evolutionary stage. In his pivotal 1935 essay, "The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts and Terms," British botanist Tansley (1871-1955) of fered a direct challenge to the ontological roots of this Clementsian paradigm. Published in Ecology, the leading American journal in the field, Tansley's essay sought to replace the organicist premises of Clementsian ecology with a more rigorous scientific materialism that drew from thermodynamics and systems theory (Kingsland 184).</page><page sequence="6">Ciaborn 571 After critiquing, fine-tuning, or cordially dismissing a number of Clementsian concepts (succession, climax, and organism), Tansley goes on to attack the organicist philosophy of holism that underpins these concepts. He argues that holism implies a closed system, a unified whole—the community or the super-organism—that acts on the parts; it is at worst a non-scientific transcendent vital principle, at best an analytic category without real agency (Tansley 298-99). But Tansley's goal, as historian Sharon E. Kingsland claims, was not to discard a sense of the whole, but rather "to express the concept of wholeness without falling into the circumlocutions of organicism" (184). To do this, Tansley borrowed the term "systems" from physics and substituted it for "community" and "organism" in order to des ignate "highly integrated wholes" that, crucially, included inorganic factors (Tansley 297). In other words, he both expands and limits the "whole" of Clementsian holism: he expands it to include non-living factors, while limiting it to the purely material parts of the various micro- and macro-systems that produce it. Tansley was implicitly replacing an organicist with a materialist ontology, for he extended the field of the living to the non-living while dropping the organicist principle. A fusion of ecology and physics, this materialist ontology lead Tansley to a neologism, "ecosystem," that did not assume ontological distinctions among the organic, inorganic, natural, and human components of a given region or formation. Eco systems form the "basic units of nature on the face of the earth," and include such factors within the physical environment as climate and soil. He asserts the reliance of organic life on inorganic factors: "there could be no systems without them, and there is constant interchange of the most various kinds within each system, not only between the organisms but between the organic and the inorganic" (299). Most importantly, Tansley recognized that nature could not be studied apart from human interference, particularly with the advent of industrialization: "It is obvious that modern civilised man upsets the 'natural' ecosystems or 'biotic communities' on a very large scale." Perhaps while thinking of Depression-era, human-made ecological catastrophes, Tansley bluntly states: "Regarded as an exceptionally powerful biotic factor which increasingly upsets the equilibrium of preexisting ecosystems and eventually destroys them, at the same time forming new ones of very different nature, human activity finds its proper place in ecology" (303). Ecology, in short, must apply itself to environments produced or manipulated by human activity (304). Worster further explains the concept's materialist edge: "all relations among organisms can be described in terms of the purely mate rial exchange of energy and of such chemical substances as water, phosphorus, nitrogen, and other nutrients" (Nature's Economy 302).</page><page sequence="7">572 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem This turn toward what Worster calls an "energy-based economics of nature" would eventually take hold as orthodox ecology by the 1940s (306). Although Tansley was himself politically conservative and a sup porter of Herbert Spencer's social Darwinism early in his career, the ecosystem concept's ontological presuppositions bear striking paral lels to the Marxist politics that inform Attaway's novel. To understand these political implications, one must consider how the Clementsian paradigm derives directly from Spencer's philosophy. In a political reading, Worster locates the origins of Clements's ontology in the Spenserian ideology of social Darwinism that naturalized the capitalist mode of production (Nature's Economy 212). For Spencer, Worster summarizes, profit could be analogized to the healthy growth of the organism, driving the progress and evolution of society toward a "more perfect state of complex organismic interdependence" (213). This vision of progressive evolution, of course, justifies the capitalist exploitation of more "primitive" social formations; it provided a con venient ideology for Europe's late-nineteenth-century Scramble for Africa. It also underpins Clements's theory of developmental stages toward a climax community. Just as Clements and Spencer shared the same ontology, so did Tansley and Marx share the same materialist ontology. In the first volume of Capital, Marx defines labor as the metabolic exchange between humans and nature, a "process by which man, through his own actions, mediates, regulates and controls the metabolism between himself and nature." Just as the human laborer confronts the world as a resistant "force," so too must he mobilize the "natural forces" that belong to his body, through which he acts "upon external nature and changes it, and in this way he simultaneously changes his own nature" (283). Humans are an active part of nature, continually shaping and being shaped by natural, material forces. This connection between ecology and Marxism was not lost on Attaway's contemporary, Kenneth Burke, a leftist literary critic. In his 1937 Attitudes Toward History, Burke saw a latent politics in 1930s scientific ecology that was more Tansleyian than Clementsian. He found there a concealed Marxist critique of profit and exploitation: "[ecology] teaches us that the total economy of this planet cannot be guided by an efficient rationale of exploitation alone, but that the exploiting part must itself eventually suffer if it too greatly disturbs the balance of the whole" (192). While the notion of "balance" evokes Clementsian ecology, "total economy" suggests the human-nature material exchange found in Tansley and Marx. Speaking of 1930s eco logical catastrophes specifically, Burke continues in a more distinctly Tansleyian vein: "laws of ecology have begun avenging themselves against restricted human concepts of profit by countering deforesta</page><page sequence="8">Ciaborn 573 tion and deep plowing with floods, droughts, dust storms, and ag gravated soil erosion" (192). Rather than encouraging natural growth, profit destroys the ecosystem, which then avenges itself on humans. The Tansley-Burke parallelism forms a sort of discursive chiasmus: Burke saw the need to bring ecology into historical materialism, while Tansley saw the need to bring human (and by extension, social and economic) history into ecology. Attaway's novel is a narrative and theoretical extension of this chiasmus: it conceives of the relation between human and natural history and pushes this relation through the Tansley-Burke crucible. Carnegie Steel, Labor Policy, and Ecological Degradation Before turning to the novel, this section provides some of the ecosystemic background for the historical setting of Attaway's novel. It explains the economic, political, and racial factors that produced the Pittsburgh region's two main sources of pollution: industrial wastes and slum living conditions. Because of the sometimes decades-long temporal lag in environmental history (that is, long-term ecological effects), this section covers much of Pittsburgh's "Steel Age," roughly the 1880s through the 1930s, providing some of the background for understanding Blood on the Forge's historical specificity. By the twen tieth century, Allegheny County (the Pittsburgh region) had grown into the world's leading iron and steel producer, owing much of its rise to Andrew Carnegie's entrepreneurial skill and the ready abundance of coke—fuel used for smelting iron and steel—in nearby Connellsville (Lubove 4). It also became a leading polluter. As Pittsburgh historian Roy Lubove says of the early-twentieth-century city, "Few communi ties were so frequently compared to hell" (1). With its air pollution, disease-ridden slums, and rivers full of sewage and industrial waste, the region lived perpetually on the cusp of ecological catastrophe, turning extreme environmental conditions into an everyday way of life for its poorer black migrant and immigrant citizens. The destructive and racist labor policies of Carnegie Steel (later US Steel), the leading steel manufacturer of the Industrial Era, typify Pittsburgh-area business practices. Andrew Carnegie was the most well known of Pittsburgh's entrepreneurs and a figure difficult to caricature as a one-dimensional, top-hat-wearing capitalist. His intu ition for business put him in the vanguard of the industry shift from iron to steel manufacturing in the 1870s. He made millions from his Carnegie Steel, and by the time he sold it to J. P. Morgan in 1901, he was possibly the richest man in the world (Nasaw xii). According</page><page sequence="9">574 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem to his biographer, David Nasaw, Carnegie's love for philanthropy and profit made him a paradoxical figure: the more he gave the more he took. In order to finance his philanthropic enterprises, Carnegie "pushed his partners and his employees relentlessly forward in the pursuit of larger and larger profits, crushed the workingmen's unions he had once praised, increased the steelworkers' workday from eight to twelve hours, and drove down wages" (xi). Publicly, Carnegie cul tivated the image of a reconciler between the contradictory demands of labor and capital; privately, he implemented anti-labor policies and delegated their execution to his subordinates. These anti-labor policies were most notoriously represented in his handling of the 1892 Homestead Strike, which resulted in the long-term dissolution of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (Rees 518). Facing increased competition from rival companies, Carnegie decided to destroy the union at Homestead, hiring Pinkertons and entrusting union-buster Henry Clay Frick with the task. Frick re fused to recognize the union, locked out the workers, and brought in strike-breakers, which led to a violent clash between Pinkertons and strikers that left ten dead (526-27). After Homestead, the union took decades to reemerge. Carnegie's attitudes toward race followed a similar tension be tween philosophy and policy, between public statements and private contempt. His racism took the indirect form of white paternalism, sins of omission, and condescension toward workers. To be sure, Carnegie donated money to the Tuskegee Institute and publicly praised Booker T. Washington; yet he exemplifies the same white paternalism lam pooned by Ralph Ellison in the figure of Mr. Norton in Invisible Man. He reserves his prejudices mainly for immigrants rather than African Americans. In his Autobiography, Carnegie extols the manliness of the native-born "working man," while brushing off the "queer" (235) and effeminate immigrant or "foreigner": "There is one great difference between the American working-man and the foreigner. The American is a man" (237). Presumably these foreigners are European immi grants originating from Slavic countries like Czechoslovakia, Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine. He conceives of American racial identity as primarily a mix of British and German ancestry—a notion, of course, with no basis in reality. Carnegie himself was Scottish and an avid Scottish cultural nationalist: he idolized and frequently quoted poet Robert Burns. But Carnegie failed to see a connection between his exploitative labor policies and his racial views. The industry shift from iron to steel allowed him to hire cheaper, lesser-skilled labor ers, namely immigrants and, later, black migrants: "While iron had to be puddled by hand, technological innovations in steel mills made it increasingly easy to train immigrants and other less-skilled workers</page><page sequence="10">Clabom 575 to replace skilled union men" (Rees 520). Inevitably, his contempt for labor unions would go hand in hand with his contempt for the lesser-skilled immigrant workforce. Typified by Carnegie, the racial contempt of local elites for "foreign" laborers buffered the progress of urban planning, result ing in the formation of chaotic communities that resembled mycelia. First-generation European immigrants and black migrants made up a combined seventy-one percent of the workforce in 1910 (Dickerson 25); this number dropped to sixty percent overall by 1920, though with a ten percent increase in black workers (98). Because zoning laws were not passed until 1923, working-class communities were somewhat of a macabre experiment in "natural" living as they were left to sprout "organically," free from the human intervention of ra tional planning. In his contemporaneous 1928 sociological study of northern city slums, T. J. Woofter Jr. posits the formula "death by density" to characterize the proportion of death rate to population density (78). He blames land-exploitation and the profit motive for these death-by-density conditions: Spaces that should have been occupied by single-family houses have been built up thickly with flats. In other places single-family houses have been built with a common wall, the effect of which is to eliminate side yards and to reduce the amount of light and of air-space to less than is neces sary for health. Front yards have been eliminated by build ing flush on the sidewalk, and the rear yards have then been cut in two by alleys and secondary streets on which rows of houses have been built. (88) In Pittsburgh, a combination of hilly topography and greedy slum lords looking to reap high profits from small plots of land led to the construction of sardine-packed, vertical housing that allowed for little sunlight or open space (Lorant 369). Overcrowding was so rampant in many mill towns that workers often shared the same bunks, alternat ing according to shifts (Dickerson 56). Because they typically lived in areas four times denser than whites (Woofter 78), blacks were more adversely affected by slum conditions, enduring death rates almost twice as high as whites between 1915 and 1930 (Dickerson 58). Most homes lacked running water and sewage systems. In one neighbor hood, Skunk Hollow, steel employees lived in dilapidated shacks built on steep slopes; inadequate toilet facilities sent human waste flowing downhill into the valley below (Lubove 14). Diseases thrived under these conditions, with frequent outbreaks of tuberculosis, typhoid, influenza, and pneumonia (Dickerson 59).</page><page sequence="11">576 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem Companies like Carnegie Steel treated the region's air, rivers, and land as a dumping ground for industrial wastes, further con tributing to this slum-generated ecological degradation. Pittsburgh's transformation from a primarily iron-producing to steel-producing hub led to an increase in coal burning, reinforcing the Steel City's second nickname: the Smoky City. Locals grew accustomed to blackened skies, even going so far as to equate Pittsburgh's high smoke levels with thriving industry, the visual measure of economic prosperity: a "smoky Pittsburgh is a healthy Pittsburgh," many would say (Lorant 364). In a 1912 article, "The Smoky City," John T. Holdsworth attrib uted the "smoke nuisance" to the profit motive and the low cost of coal, the burning of which was a "scourge to vegetation, a defilement of buildings and merchandise, and a positive check upon civic and industrial progress—all because it is cheap!" (86). Historian Dennis C. Dickerson describes western Pennsylvanian mill towns as so pol luted that "street lamps glowed in midafternoon to chase away the darkness created by the smoke-filled skies" (55). The need for smoke control had been a long-debated urban planning and public health issue since the early nineteenth century, but the city government and local elites avoided action for decades; the city finally passed the Smoke Control Ordinance in 1941, although demands for increased wartime production would delay its enforcement (370). These same factories that pumped smoke into the air dumped waste into the Ohio, Allegheny, and Monongahela rivers (Lubove 15). The process of mining the coal necessary to produce steel released a steady stream of sulfuric acid into the rivers; in 1920, 2.5 million tons of acid flowed into the Ohio River, destroying riverbanks and causing massive fish kills (Casner 89-92). The impact of acid drain age was extra-regional too, extending as far as 170 miles downriver (93). Company towns like Homestead beaded the three rivers as far as thirty miles from Pittsburgh's downtown; residents relied on the rivers for their water supply (Muller 54). This dependence on polluted water won the region the dubious distinction for the highest mortality rate in the nation for waterborne diseases (Casner 93). Because of the lack of water treatment facilities, frequent typhoid outbreaks in the early 1900s killed working-class immigrant and black migrants at nearly twice the rate of native whites (Tarr and Yosie 70). These, in short, are the environmental conditions, produced by and intertwined with labor and regional planning policies, that form the historical backdrop to Blood on the Forge.</page><page sequence="12">Ciaborn 577 South to North: Soil Depletion to Industrial Pollution in Blood on the Forge What Attaway represents is the subjective experience of this social and environmental history, as he forms an integrated vision of the Great Migration, industrial landscapes, slum life, and labor struggle. As I will show, in its scope and concern with ecological degradation, this integrated vision engages, on the imaginary level, the same problematic as Tansley's ecosystem concept. The novel fol lows the four stages of the Great Migration narrative as identified by Farah Jasmine Griffin in Who Set You Flowin'?: The African-American Migration Narrative: migration out of the South, initial contact with the northern urban environment, an attempt to adjust to northern life, and finally a "vision of the possibilities or limitations of the Northern, Western, or Midwestern city and the South" (3). Each of these stages, which center on the migrants' changing consciousness, is given a particular ecological inflection in the novel, thus expand ing the purview of both the migration narrative and the ecosystem concept. Blood on the Forge also contributes to black Marxism in its emphasis on steel production's intertwined, ecosystemic byproducts: a wounded earth, injured workers, and slum living conditions. In the novel's opening section, Attaway emphasizes the slow, natural tempo of southern life, which later serves as a striking con trast with the jarring industrial rapidity of northern life. Unlike the later parts of the novel, the opening section follows a dream-like flashback structure, as narrative form imitates the natural cycles of the Moss brothers' environment: the changing seasons, weather cycles, harvest time, and birth and death for both humans and nature. This premigration scene is set in 1919 Kentucky as the Moss family struggles to survive as sharecroppers. Richard Wright describes the sharecropping system's injustice in his 1941 photographic essay, Twelve Million Black Voices: "The Lords of the Land [white landown ers] assign us ten or fifteen acres of soil already bled of its fertility through generations of abuse. They advance us one mule, one plow, seed, tools, fertilizer, clothing and food" (38). Black sharecroppers, Wright explains, are forced into debt peonage, always bound more to their white creditors than to the land. Racial and economic oppression in the South follows a predict able, though tragic, routine that allows the Moss family to cope by means of a blues stylization of life—one that "slicks away" hardship and cauterizes emotional wounds. Melody, the emotional glue that holds the family together, embodies this blues ethos in the novel's opening sentences: "He never had a craving in him that he couldn't slick away on his guitar. You have to be native to the red-clay hills</page><page sequence="13">578 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem of Kentucky to understand that" (Attaway 1). Melody laments the family's wretched condition in a song called "Hungry Blues": Done scratched at the hills, But the 'taters refuse to grow. . . . Done scratched at the hills, But the 'taters refuse to grow. . . . Mister Bossman, Mister Bossman, Lemme mark in the book once mo'. (3) The first four lines characterize failed agricultural labor as futile "scratching," a practice that becomes even more futile in the final lines when the black sharecroppers fall into deeper debt to the white "bossman." The hint of sarcasm in the final lines reveals Melody's awareness of the white creditor and black debtor social relation that determines the farmer's relation to the land. Two forms of inscrip tion—scratching the land and marking the book—also racialize the land as white, shaping the ecosystem into an extension of a hostile creditor. Despite this failure at laboring the land, the blues offer a form of resistance—if only at an intuitive, sensory level—to the endless white creditor-black debtor cycle that dominates the family's relation to the land. Through Melody, the blues are articulated to the land, offering a black vernacular counter-racialization of a land systemati cally racialized by white property owners. Melody cuts through this property relation and holds onto an affective bond to the earth: "Right then Melody was feeling the earth like a good thing in his heart." This affective bond suggests an immediate link between laboring the earth—between the black sharecropper's literal closeness to the soil— and the vernacular tradition of country blues that Melody embodies. Seemingly because of his blues sensibility, Melody intuits that no one owns the earth: "'I got a big feelin' like the ground don't belong to the white boss—not to nobody,"' he proclaims to Big Mat (22). This sublime moment even escapes the codifying force of the blues: "Every once in a while he would get filled up like this with a feeling that was too big to turn into any kind of music" (23). He says this while trekking across Vagermound Common, which borders the Moss farm plot, representing for the brothers a geographic and metaphoric horizon that offers a model and promise of common land. These two factors—Melody's blues and close proximity to unenclosed, public land—allow the brothers access to some sense of nature unmediated by racism and capitalism. Attaway further racializes the land through a counter-pastoralist mode of representation. The Kentucky landscape is neither wholly a pastoral ideal nor an anti-pastoral reality; it is marked by both natural</page><page sequence="14">Ciaborn 579 beauty and racial violence, doubling as safe haven and potential lynch ing site. Crab-apple trees are analogous to African Americans; they populate and racialize the landscape: "Most of the country beyond Vagermound Common was bunched with crab-apple trees, posing crookedly, like tired old Negroes against the sky" (7-8). They seem to follow Big Mat like ancestral guardians: "Against the dark sky the darker crab-apple trees kept pace with him as he walked" (16). The nighttime landscape resembles a color-blind society, an insight sug gested by Melody: '"At night the hills ain't red no more. There ain't no crab-apple trees squat in the hills, no more land to hoe in the red-hot sun—white the same as black'" (11). That in daytime the crab-apple trees "squat in the hills" is significant: it suggests that they are hid ing from a lynch mob: "Hiding in the red-clay hills was something always in the backs of their heads. It was something to be thought of along with bloodhound dogs and lynching" (35). Nature at night offers refuge and cover from racial antagonisms that appear naturally embedded in the daytime landscape. This scene, then, reveals the brothers' (and by extension, all black sharecroppers') contradictory relation to nature and the pastoral. This ambiguous pastoral scene is disrupted by a series of trau mas that eventually render the pastoral condition unlivable for African Americans. Through a flashback, the narrative recounts the novel's primal, traumatic scene—the mother's death at the plow: "She had dropped dead between the gaping handles of the plow. The lines had been double looped under her arms, so she was dragged through the damp, rocky clay by a mule trained never to balk in the middle of a row. The mule dragged her in. The rocks in the red hills are sharp. She didn't look like their maw anymore" (7). The sharecropping system, which forces the mother to help labor the fields, and soil erosion, which leaves the ground hard and rocky, conspire to amplify the trauma of her death. Dragged across this eroded, rocky terrain, her body is mutilated beyond recognition. Although the mother's bodily mutilation may seem an unfortu nate "natural" accident, soil erosion itself is a byproduct of an economy that exploits and destroys the ecosystem. In Twelve Million Black Voices, Wright attributes soil erosion to rampant deforestation: We . . . watch the men with axes come through . . . and whack down the pine, oak, ash, elm, and hickory trees, leaving the land denuded as far as the eye can see. And then rain comes in leaden sheets to slat and sour at the earth until it washes away rich layers of top soil, until it leaves the land defenseless, until all vegetation is gone</page><page sequence="15">580 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem and nothing remains to absorb the moisture and hinder the violent spreading floods of early spring. (78) Poor farming methods were also culprits in soil erosion; the widely practiced one-crop (usually cotton or tobacco) system, as opposed to the crop rotation system advocated by agricultural scientists like George Washington Carver, quickly depleted soil nutrients. Environ mental historian Albert E. Cowdrey states: "any system which covers too many fields with the same plant falls afoul of the ecological prin ciple which states that the simplest systems are apt to be the most unstable" (79). Big Mat complains about this erosion to Mr. Johnston, the white landlord: "Wind and rain comin' outen the heavens ever' season, takin' the good dirt down to the bottoms. Last season over the big hill the plow don't go six inches in the dirt afore it strike hard rock" (Attaway 14). Johnston faults nature rather than the system from which he profits, but, fearing his tenants will migrate north for better work, he decides to replace the mule Mat killed in an angry outburst after his mother's death (15). When he goes to retrieve the promised mule, Big Mat lashes out at Johnston's riding boss for insulting his dead mother. A recruiting agent, or "jackleg," from the north offers the Moss brothers a convenient escape from the lynch mob that will inevitably come after Big Mat; the jackleg arranges for them a free train ride to the steel mills of western Pennsylvania (31). Originating in racism and poor environmental conditions, trauma and its aftermath catalyzes the brothers' move to the north. Attaway focalizes the subsequent descriptions of Allegheny County's polluted industrial landscape—everywhere marked by hu man traces—through the agrarian eyes of the Moss brothers. It is in these northern scenes that parallels to Tansley's ecosystem concept become more apparent. Immediately upon their arrival, the brothers wander about their new home, an unnamed steel mill town along the Monongahela River that reminds them of an "ugly, smoking hell out of a backwoods preacher's sermon" (45). They see the land as the victim of a giant agricultural machine: A giant might have planted his foot on the heel of a great shovel and split the bare hills. Half buried in the earth where the great shovel had trenched were the mills. The mills were as big as creation when the new men had ridden by on the freight. From the bunkhouse they were just so much scrap iron, scattered carelessly, smoking lazily. . . . None of this was good to the eyes of men accustomed to the pattern of fields. (43)</page><page sequence="16">Ciaborn 581 Mixing shock and awe, the lyrically beautiful and the industrially damned, this passage draws parallels and differences between micro agricultural and macro-industrial modes of production. The image of the giant's "great shovel" conflates a farming tool that would be familiar to the Moss brothers with the awesome power of dynamite to "split" the hills as a farmer would furrow a field. When seen from up close, the mills appear to be steel-producing monsters; from a distance, they shrink to mere bits of litter or "scrap iron," suggesting that their power and size are not so great compared to the vaster landscape. This image of a wounded earth also echoes a poetic conceit used by Milton in his description of Pandemonium in Paradise Lost: "Soon had his [Mammon's] crew / Opened into the hill a spacious wound/And digged out ribs of gold" (1833). By linking the industrial environment with the Christian hell, Attaway suggests that tormenting the material landscape also torments human spirituality or subjectiv ity. This objective-subjective, material-spiritual dialectic is mediated by aesthetics: the eyesore landscape assaults the brothers' sense of what nature is, and thus disturbs their own inner nature or habitus. Veteran steelworkers use the slang term "green men" to designate these fresh-eyed, proletarians-in-the-making, easily spotted because they are not yet habituated to their surroundings; their inner nature is not accustomed to the outer (52). Not only the land but also the rivers are polluted. Attaway de scribes the Monongahela River where it converges with the Allegheny River to form the Ohio: in "back of [the Moss brothers] ran a dirty as-a-catfish-hole river with a beautiful name: the Monongahela. Its banks were lined with mountains of red ore, yellow limestone and black coke" (43). Echoing T. S. Eliot's lament for the trashy Thames River in The Waste Land, Attaway envisions the Monongahela under the strain of industrial waste; its beautiful, iambic Native American name serves as a distant reminder of its pre-industrial past. Ore, limestone, and coke are the raw materials needed to manufacture steel, the sediment of an industrial era. To amplify and anthropomor phize the river's horrors, Attaway sets the riverbank as the scene of a violent sexual assault. A gang of boys, as if playing a game, rape a ten-year-old girl they call "ol' Betty": "Twisting and turning, a furious little figure [Betty] was dragged away to the tall weeds up the river bank. The weeds tossed violently and then trembled for a little time" (99). While this scene typifies the naturalist novel (people reduced to animal-like behavior by their brutal environment), it also connects ecological damage to sexual violence. Like most of the working-class immigrants in the area, Betty is probably Slavic. Her image condenses the simultaneous exploitation of a feminized immigrant workforce and</page><page sequence="17">582 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem a feminized nature. It also places her on a sort of sexual assembly line that mechanizes the sexual act itself. Just as steel production causes violence to the landscape and rivers, so too does it maim and terrorize the steelworkers. After the brothers' initial contact with the landscape, Attaway proceeds to connect their aesthetic experience with the labor experience. Still absorbing their new environment, the brothers listen to the testimony of mill workers. Attaway structures these accounts according to the verse-chorus pattern of a work song, as the workers' attitudes col lectively speak like a refrain: "What men in their right minds would leave off tending green growing things to tend iron monsters?" (44). Individual accounts of violence on the job separate these refrains. A worker recounts how one non-English-speaking Slavic immigrant could not understand shouted warnings of an impending accident, leaving him with a '"chest like a scrambled egg'" (44). Another calls one machine a "skull buster," because it involves dropping an eight ton steel ball on scrap metal, sending shrapnel flying everywhere and often wounding or even killing workers unfortunate enough to stand in its deadly path (45). One black worker, Bo, warns the brothers to be careful because the employers like to put green men on the "'hot jobs before they know enough to keep alive'" (52). "Hot jobs" refers to those working the Bessemer furnaces, the most dangerous jobs in the mill. These tales of machinic violence and terror reinforce the literal meaning of the novel's title: steel cannot be made without the crucial ingredient of human blood. For the brothers, life off the job proves as potentially violent and disabling as life on the job. The division between work and home is blurred, not just because of the close proximity between housing and the mills, but also because of the seepage of industrial pollutants into the living space that this proximity enables. The accounts of pol luted slums imply the interconnectedness of ecosystemic processes. The air is heavily polluted by the massive amounts of burning coal; Chinatown complains, '"All this smoke and stuff in the air! How a man gonna breathe?"' (46). The workers do not care whether they work the night or day shift, for the dense smoke blocks the sunlight: "they did not like the taste of sooty air. They missed the sun" (54). The town's infrastructure is almost non-existent: in one enclave there is only one water pump for fifty families (47), people urinate in the streets because the outhouses smell too bad (51), feral dogs and rats scurry around "Mex Town" (69), and kids toss around "kerosene soaked balls of waste" for sport (152). There is no system for domestic waste removal, so garbage heaps are one of the novel's strongest ecological motifs: they block the</page><page sequence="18">Ciaborn 583 makeshift dirt roads, forcing pedestrians to scramble over them; they segregate Slavic from black enclaves, acting as eco-racial barriers. The brothers have two significant encounters with a garbage heap, notable especially for their place in the narrative. The first encounter occurs when Chinatown and Melody get lost while exploring their new neighborhood. Hoping to pinpoint their position, Chinatown climbs the heap and attracts the attention of some Slavs: an "old Slav bent like a burned weed out of the window... . With eyes a snow-washed blue, he looked contempt at Chinatown. Then he wrinkled his nose and spat" (49). This contempt turns to hatred near the end of the novel when the all-white union prepares to combat black strikebreakers. As Melody passes from an increasingly hostile Slavic enclave to his home, he encounters the heap again: He had known that the big pile of ashes and garbage would be in his path, but now it seemed to hop suddenly in front of him. He was too tired to change direction and walk around it. ... He stepped into the soft stuff around the edges of the mound and struggled to the top. The brittle ashes broke under his feet. ... A tin can left a burning streak across one of his ankles. (211-12) Melody climbs this heap under the gaze of the Slavs. It is as though the boiling racial hostility is embodied in the uncanny agency of the trash heap as it "hops" in his path; the tin can that cuts his ankle appears as a weapon-like extension of the Slavic gaze. If the heap symbolizes the "waste" that Melody's life is becoming, it is a symbol that also literally embodies the racial barriers that prevent the broth ers from assimilating into the union and joining the strikers. As suggested in the Mosses' initial encounter with the industrial landscape, each brother's response to his new environment dra matizes the lived subjectivity of the steel mill ecosystem. Sickened and tormented by the relentless heat on the "hot jobs," Melody no longer feels the strength, let alone the inspiration, to play the blues: he is worn down by the strange new "rhythms of the machinery play[ing] through his body" (80). When he does have the time and energy to play, he strums "quick chords" and adopts a "strange kind of playing for him, but it was right for that new place" (62). While he does occasionally succeed in translating the rhythms of his new environment into music, this "new music" is "nothing like the blues that spread fanwise from the banks of the Mississippi" (63). While the rhythms of the steel mill work to undermine the slower tempo of country blues, twelve-hour shifts eventually leave him too tired to even play; thus, Melody loses his ability to emotionally heal himself and those around him with music. Out of a subconscious impulse,</page><page sequence="19">584 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem Melody smashes his right hand, his "'picking' hand," in one of the machines (127). Attaway suggests that this "accident" is intentional, as Melody is tormented by his failing blues: "He had been thinking of the guitar, knowing it could never pluck away the craving that was in him. .. . The last three days of picking at his guitar had wearied him. Yet he knew he would not be able to let the music box alone" (128). Melody's brother Chinatown is similarly affected by work in the mills. After he is blinded by a major blast furnace explosion, Chinatown is, like Melody, emotionally defeated. Reduced to a state of helplessness, he depends on Melody and a Mexican prostitute, Anna, for constant emotional and physical consolation. While Melody and Chinatown are physically and emotionally destroyed by their encounter with the machines, Big Mat thrives in his new environment. The classic Marxist contest of worker versus machine runs aground in Mat's perfect functioning as a steel worker. The other workers' attitudes toward the Bessemers reflect Marx's dictum about mechanized labor: "the instrument of labor, when it takes the form of a machine, immediately becomes a competitor of the worker himself" (Capital 557). When the typical new migrant first encounters the large-scale machines, his attitude is one of de spair at the impossibility of his ever matching the labor-power of the machines. By contrast, Big Mat identifies more with the machines than with his fellow white workers, for they allow him to flourish in a way denied him by Jim Crow: in "competition with white men, he would prove himself." While many workers faint from the heat, Big Mat "proved to be a natural hot-job man," finding his "natural" rhythm in a world of machines and performing at twice the speed of any other worker (Attaway 78). In direct contrast to those of Melody, Big Mat's muscles and body achieve a rhythmic coordination with the machines, expressed in metaphors of musical and natural growth: "His muscles were glad to feel the growing weight of the steel. The work was nothing. Without labor his body would shrivel and be a weed. His body was happy. This was a good place for a big black man to be. . . . Mat's muscles sang" (80). This musical metaphor, which indicates Mat's success—expressing his harmony with machines inverts the parallel narrative of Melody's failed blues. This inversion sets the destructive potential contained within Mat's identification with the machines against the creative potential of the blues in Melody's identification with the southern soil. On this level, one can read At taway's novel as a bildungsroman of a mechanized subject, of a man becoming machine and thus becoming a destroyer of the ecosystem and, eventually, himself. As embodied in Big Mat, this link between machinic and racial violence becomes more pronounced in the novel's climactic strike</page><page sequence="20">Ciaborn 585 scene. As the all-white union plans to strike and picket against the mill owners' brutal policies, Big Mat is deputized and hired to help suppress the white workers. In the historical 1919 strike, black deputies served a particularly useful function for the mill owners as strikebreakers and promoters of racial discord. According to the testimony of an organizer for United Mine Workers, black deputies "started a reign of terror in the town .... Men were jostled along the street at the points of pistols, and men were struck down and shot down" (qtd. in Dickerson 91). Through Big Mat and free indirect discourse, Attaway imagines the subjective state of these black depu ties. While assisting some other deputies to corner a group of strikers, Big Mat relishes the terror he inspires: the "absolute terror in these people made him feel like flinging himself on their backs and drag ging them to the ground with his teeth" (Attaway 215). The authority that comes with being a deputy heals Big Mat's "ruptured ego," for it gives him a "sense of becoming whole again," and completes the self-realization that began with his superior performance on the hot jobs (212). The thought of being an authority figure also fuels Big Mat's fantasies of avenging himself on whites: "All of his old hatreds came back and added flame to his feeling. ... He was the law. After ail, what did right or wrong matter in the case? ... He was a boss, a boss over whites" (196-97). With scathing irony, Big Mat's anger and resentment toward whites makes him the perfect instrument of terror, played by the very powers that oppress him. Once the strike begins and the furnaces start to cool down because there are not enough workers to keep them burning, Big Mat single-handedly tries to keep the machines functioning, as he "rush[es] madly about the yards, knowing that only his will would keep a fatal crack from their big, brittle insides" (213). This impossible effort shows the extent to which Big Mat has himself become a machine. Only as he dies, after a Slavic striker delivers a blow to his head with a pickax, does Big Mat glimpse the reality that, in siding with the mill owners and in becoming a machine, he has become an agent of oppression. Smothers and Leopold:Toward an Ecological Ethic While Big Mat lacks the critical awareness to evaluate and challenge his immediate environment, Smothers, a relatively minor character, opens a space for ecological and ideological critique. Be cause of Smothers, Blood on the Forge in many ways exceeds the scope of essayist and environmentalist Leopold's more well-known articulation of a land ethic. The main tenets of Leopold's land ethic evolved throughout the course of the 1930s, particularly in three key</page><page sequence="21">586 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem published lectures: "The Conservation Ethic," "Land Pathology," and "A Biotic View of the Land." These lectures were substantially revised and sutured into "The Land Ethic," his most influential work and the final essay of his 1949 book A Sand County Almanac. Indeed, Donald Worster claims that the book's famous concluding essay would be come "the single most concise expression of the new environmental philosophy" that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s (Nature's Economy 284). Ultimately, Smothers is a sort of black environmentalist who anticipates the trajectory of Leopold's thought by arguing for the ethical relation between human and non-human. But they differ in two crucial ways. First, Attaway approaches such an ethic from the perspective of anti-capitalist critique rather than conservationism, which leads to a more human-centered focus that strongly correlates worker and public health with land health. Second, the novel criticizes an entire network of productive relations that are more global in scope than is Leopold's preoccupation with certain regions in the United States. This section first summarizes the development of Leopold's land ethic in the 1930s before turning to Smothers and Blood on the Forge's ecological ethic. Along with Henry David Thoreau and John Muir, Leopold (1887 1948) occupies a central place in ecocriticism's canon of American environmentalist writers. He worked as a forester for the United States Forest Service in New Mexico from 1909 to 1928, founded the preservationist Wilderness Society in 1924, and developed the game management profession, for which he received its first professorship at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1933. A theory wrung from practical experience, Leopold's land ethic received its first test run over a decade earlier in "The Conservation Ethic," a lecture delivered in 1933 and later published in the Journal of Forestry (Meine 302). As biographer Curt Meine argues, Leopold's purpose was to seize the vanguard of the conservation movement and add philosophical teeth to its calls for land-use reform measures (303). Drawing at tention to the interdependency of human and environmental history, Leopold finds it strange that "There is as yet no ethic dealing with man's relationships to land and to the non-human animals and plants which grow upon it. Land, like Odysseus' slave-girls, is still property" ("Conservation" 182). He cites numerous inefficient uses of land across the American Midwest and Southwest, all showing how "un foreseen ecological reactions" can "condition, circumscribe, delimit, and warp all enterprises, both economic and cultural, that pertain to land" (185). The ethic he then proposes amounts to the extension of rational planning to nature in order to realize a vision of "controlled wild culture" (190-91). Using musical metaphors later echoed by Attaway, he calls for the "harmonious integration" of economics and</page><page sequence="22">Ciaborn 587 aesthetics, business and culture, in a new orientation toward land that treats it as "not only a food-factory but an instrument for self expression, on which each can play music of his own choosing" (191). By advocating a conservation ethic, Leopold aims to change minds first; politics and economics will follow. Leopold's 1935 lecture "Land Pathology" again argues for an integrated economic and aesthetic use of land facilitated by public private partnerships, with higher education serving as an interme diary ("Land Pathology" 213). Though in this essay he uses the phrase "land ethic" for the first time, "land pathology" is the central concept: "Regarding society and land collectively as an organism, that organism has suddenly developed pathological symptoms, i.e. self-accelerating rather than self-compensating departures from nor mal functioning" (217). The "machine age" is to blame for launching the "self-accelerating" destruction of the land—accelerating because the temporality of the ecosystem's self-replenishing cycles is thrown out of joint. A later address delivered in 1939, "A Biotic View of the Land," shows Leopold taking up Tansley's ecosystem concept for the first time (Flader and Callicott 7). He considers organic and inorganic parts of an environment systemically organized into a "biotic pyramid" or food chain that facilitates the flow and conversion of energy. The biotic pyramid is a visualization of the ecosystem's metabolism, a structure in which land is "not merely soil; it is a fountain of energy flowing through a circuit of soils, plants, and animals" (Leopold, "Biotic" 268). Leopold characterizes the technological interruption of this flow as "biotic violence," against which conservationists must promote a "nonviolent land use" (271). In a parallel to Woofter's death-by-density formula, Leopold correlates human population density with biotic violence: "a dense population requires a more violent conversion of land" (270). In his final mature formulation of the land ethic in 1948, Leopold challenges profit-driven conservation, which advocates conservation on economic rather than ethical grounds. Leopold's argument depends on the premise that "the individual is a member of a community of interdependent parts" that must cooperate in order to survive ("Land Ethic" 239). Human beings must participate in the "biotic community" as citizens rather than conquerors, and take individual responsibil ity for the "health" of the land (240). Reflecting scientific ecology's 1930s and 1940s turn toward systems theory, thermodynamics, and physics, Leopold argues that the biotic community forms an intricate and delicate "energy circuit," and human violence to this circuit has "effects more comprehensive than is intended or foreseen" (255). Though not a philosopher, Leopold basically extends a Kantian ethic to the entire field of the living, arguing that the land—soil, water,</page><page sequence="23">588 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem plants, and animals—should be treated as an end-in-itself. In ecocriti cal parlance, the land ethic is now understood as a form of ecocentric rather than anthropocentric thinking, one that places environmental concerns on par with human ones. As articulated via Smothers, the ecological worldview of Blood on the Forge anticipates and further develops Leopold's ethical vision. Smothers gives voice to the earth's suffering, speaking as though the earth were itself an organic, living entity: It's wrong to tear up the ground and melt it up in the fur nace. Ground don't like it. It's the hell-and-devil kind of work. Guy ain't satisfied with usin' the stuff that was put here for him to use—stuff of top of the earth. Now he got to git busy and melt up the ground itself. Ground don't like it, I tells you. Now they'll be folks laugh when I say the ground got feelin'. But I knows what it is I'm talkin' about. (53-4) Sounding like a fire-and-brimstone preacher, Smothers ascribes a kind of uncanny agency and affectivity to the "ground," suggesting that it will eventually avenge itself against humans. His protest registers a radical shift in intensity from agricultural cultivation of the earth to the outright violence of industrial exploitation. Edward Margolies ties this view to an early-nineteenth-century romanticism, one that condemns the capitalist "greed that manifests itself as a violence to the land, a transgression of Nature" (xiv). He goes on to caution that from "one point of view [Attaway's] feelings about the sanctity of nature now seem almost quaint in an age of cybernetics," though, he adds, this critique does not devalue the novel's relevance to the global environmental crisis (xviii). Part prophecy, part philosophical meditation, Smothers's rants are neither simply romantic nor pastoral anachronisms. Depending on how one defines feeling, Smothers's reference to the earth's "feeling" actually adds to the novel's distinctly materialist understanding of the relations among worker, earth, and machine. "Feeling" in this context cannot simply be explained as an anthropomorphism, for Smothers refrains from projecting distinctly human emotions onto the earth. Rather, Smothers's use of the word in this context resembles Brian Massumi's notion of "affect" as defined in his book, Parables for the Virtual. Massumi draws a distinction between emotion and affect, defining the former as a reification and humanization of the later. "Emotions," such as anger or jealousy, can be named and brought within the bounds of language and human experience; they are, as he says, a "subjective content, the sociolinguistic fixing of the quality of an experience which is from that point onward defined as personal"</page><page sequence="24">Ciaborn 589 (Massumi 28). By contrast, "affect" refers to a pre-personal intensity, felt but never entering consciousness or getting caught in linguistic shackles (36). This means that affect as intensity exceeds the domain of strictly human experience and arises out of the interface between bodies, human or non-human (25). Because "affect" applies to all beings, it forces us to reconceptualize the categories of the human and the non-human as forming an ontological continuum, much like Tansley's ecosystem concept. Smothers's sense for the earth's feeling reveals his heightened, almost scientific, sensitivity to the material process of steel produc tion, a multi-step process of mining, melting, and manipulating iron to produce an alloy. When asked how he knows what the ground feels, Smothers responds: "'Same way I hears bridges talk in the wind"' (Attaway 64). Attuned to the slightest changes in the affectivity of steel-making, Smothers repeatedly warns his co-workers about the destructive power of the machines and is able to anticipate a blast furnace explosion. Though his co-workers think that Smothers's prophecies are only half-mad, shrill rants, Attaway goes out of his way to invest him with a strange dignity and characterize him as a Tiresian speaker of truth. For example, one morning Smothers warns a group of Irish and Italian workers before they start the day's work on the blast furnaces: "'Ever'body better be on the lookout. Steel li able to git somebody today. I got a deep feelin' in my bones'" (145). Initially, the workers tease Smothers, but when he recounts his own tale of getting struck by a hot steel bar, leaving him permanently disabled, laughter fades to shocked silence. Smothers's prophecy does prove true when the blast furnace explodes, leaving fourteen men dead, including himself, and Chinatown blind. His feelings prove superior to the mill's experts, none of whom could predict the ac cident. As the narrator comments: "But steel workers also felt the truth of Smothers' last words: steel just had to get somebody that day. There was no conflict between what Smothers had said and the facts" (160). By granting agency to the ground, Smothers sees that biotic violence leads to violence against the worker: ecological degradation can lead to industrial accidents, understood as the land avenging itself against humans. This ethic differs from Leopold's in that it also serves as a form of ideological critique. In Louis Althusser's classic definition, "ideol ogy represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence" (109). In the world of Blood on the Forge, these "real conditions" can be understood as the interdependent relations within the ecosystem itself. Above all, Smothers's insight into these real conditions grows out of a change in his material rela tion to his physical environment: the steel plant where he suffered</page><page sequence="25">590 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem a crippling injury years before. Through the enhanced perception acquired with his disabled body, Smothers unveils the dependence of all human bodies on the external, inorganic environment—an axiom of both ecosystem ecology and Marx's materialist ontology. The disabled body, in other words, shows forth the real relation of all human bodies to what Marx calls the "second body" of nature: "Nature is man's inorganic body—nature, that is, in so far as it is not itself the human body. Man lives on nature—means that nature is his body, with which he must remain in continuous intercourse if he is not to die" (Manuscripts of 1844 74). Smothers is able to reveal the layers of mediation that conceal the real conditions of the steel worker's existence. To suggest this mediation, he uses the terms "ground" and "steel" interchangeably, which not only establish the material consistency between the two substances but also suggest that a land ethic is inseparable from the circulation of commodities made from the land. Steel is the ground given commodity form: mined iron is melted in the Bessemer converters, and then shaped for (in most cases) railroad tracks or structural components for skyscrapers or bridges. Stripped of mediation, steel—and the living the workers make from its manufacture—is intimately bound to the "heart of the earth": '"All the time I listen real hard and git scared when the iron blast holler to git loose, an' them big redhead blooms screamin' like the very heart o' the earth caught between them rollers. It jest ain't right'" (53). Smothers's intuitive "rightness," then, condemns this particularly violent disruption of the material relations among interdependent parts of the ecosystem on which the capitalist mode of production, in reality, depends. As suggested above, the novel's ecological ethic also takes the problem of commodity fetishism in an ecological direction. Again substituting spiritual metaphors for a material process, Smothers speaks of a "cuss 'o steel" or cursed steel (64). This "curse" suggests the material consistency obscured by the ground's transformation into the commodity form: the steel is haunted by and infused with the ground, its true origin, which now appears to take on its own agency. This agency or curse is distinct from the imaginary agency that commodities in the marketplace seem to have; it is literally the volatility introduced by the ground's chemical alteration, its being toward-commodity. It refers to the ground's surplus, yet substantive counter-agency produced simultaneously alongside steel's illusory agency as an exchangeable commodity used for railroad tracks, structural components, and armaments. It is as though the com modity form is haunted by an earthly residue that makes itself felt unpredictably in the future: the earth threatens to blast apart the commodity at any moment. Indeed, the blast furnace explosion is</page><page sequence="26">Ciaborn 591 itself caused by a surplus byproduct, a residue left over from the production process: "A shelf of hot metal had built itself high up in the faulty furnace. When that shelf had broken the force of its fall had been explosive" (160). Just as the worker's blood goes into the forge, so too does the earth's: an industrial accident is here reframed as an ecological one. More precisely, the industrial accident is an un predictable future event that has its origin in the past violence done to the land. To memorialize Smothers, his co-workers ritually turn the steel scraps from the accident into watch fobs, which they wear around their necks for luck (168). In so doing, the workers give the steel a ritual value that escapes the logic of exchange value; these scraps open up a space for resistance, insofar as they signify the workers' communal bonding. After the accident and Smothers's death, this critique of steel making is extended to a critique of biotic and racial violence on a more global scale. Perhaps so as to register a shift in the workers' consciousness—with the watch fobs serving as material signifiers of that shift—the narration itself seems to gain a heightened awareness of the connection between steel and the ground. On the narrative level, it seems that Smothers is ritually sacrificed for the sake of more direct commentary on steel production as a globally interdependent process: The nearness of a farmer to his farm was easily understood. But no man was close to steel. It was shipped across end less tracks to all the world. On the consignment slips were Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, rails for South America, tin for Africa, tool steel for Europe. This hard metal held up the new world. . .. Steel is born in the flames and sent out to live and grow old. It comes back to the flames and has a new birth. But no one man could calculate its beginning or end. It was old as the earth. It would end when the earth ended. It seemed deathless. (179-80) This passage places steel within both the global economy and the global ecosystem. As an export, it moves from national—the three major US cities—to intercontinental distribution. Used primarily for railroad tracks and large buildings, steel literally serves as the ma terial base for the "new" modern world. The apparent contradiction between steel's "birth" in flames and its immortality is reconciled through its analogy to the earth. Insofar as steel is converted earth, the two substances are coterminous but not the same. Steel appears to the workers as part of the earth's natural cycles, although it is the product of a historically-situated mode of production. That steel only</page><page sequence="27">592 From Black Marxism To Industrial Ecosystem "seemed deathless" becomes clear when the strike proves effective at halting production (213). Attaway's narrative ultimately suggests that, under industrial capitalism, the biotic violence done to the earth is reproduced at the ideological level as racial discord, with labor serving as the mediat ing factor. Whether performed by animals, humans, or machines, labor is a material process that, in Blood on the Forge, divides the earth through the appropriation of natural resources; likewise, race divides labor through management's divide-and-conquer policies of exploiting racial differences and resentments. In one of Smothers's speeches, steel appears to have the ability to affect worker subjec tivity and amplify interracial conflict: "Steel want to git you. Onliest thing—it ain't gittin' you fast enough. So there trouble in the mills. Guys wants to fight each other—callin' folks scabs and wants to knock somebody in the head. Don't no body know why. I knows why. It's 'cause steel got to git more men than it been gittin'" (53). On one level, this passage mystifies the true causes behind worker conflict. The violence Smothers speaks of is racial violence, not the mysti cal power of steel on workers' emotions. Scabs are black migrants shipped in by management to break strikes, for management's policy preys on white animosity toward blacks. On another level, however, it suggests that biotic and racial violence are linked through accel eration—"gittin' you fast enough." If negligence contributes to the blast furnace explosion, it is a negligence that accelerates production levels at the expense of worker safety. The more production accel erates, the more resources must be extracted from the ecosystem, interrupting its self-replenishing cycles, and thus contributing to the destabilization of the system. The destructive logic of the profit mo tive eventually unhinges the whole production process, including its material substratum (the earth). Despite the ubiquity of ecological crisis in American history, Americanist scholars of the literary Left and African American litera ture, with few exceptions, have often sidelined ecology's relevance to their field. Some ecocritics like Timothy Morton and Bruno Latour have called for an expansion of the ecocritical and literary fields' methods and objects of inquiry—an expansion that has begun to be put into practice by critics like Scott Hicks and Monique Allewaert. By looking at Blood on the Forge as an ecological text, then, one can see how the Great Migration narrative, black Marxist politics, and the wider early-twentieth-century literary left participate in 1930s ecological discourses. More broadly, Blood on the Forge shows not only that ecological crisis has already occurred along the color line in places like Allegheny County, but also that this crisis forms</page><page sequence="28">Ciaborn 593 a hitherto unrecognized and yet potentially constitutive element of early-twentieth-century American fiction. Note 1. Lawrence R. Rodgers, for example, categorizes Blood on the Forge as a "fugitive migrant novel," a special variant of the Great Migration novel that challenges narratives about black migrants' socio-economic ascent in northern cities (98). Cynthia Hamilton focuses on the novel's seeming anti-urbanism, but she is primarily concerned with its lament for the decaying cultural forms that once sustained black life in the South. Stacy I. Morgan works within a migration narra tive frame when she argues that the novel shows us how "material culture serves not only to reflect but to shape the lives of poor and working-class Americans" (715).
