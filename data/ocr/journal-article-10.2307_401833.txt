<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOETHE THE THINKER. By Karl Vietor. Translated by B. Q. Morgan. Harvard University Press. 212 pp. $4.00. Viitor's assuredly well-documented and beautifully translated book (Morgan has made a study of the art of translation) closes on this word about its subject: "In Homer the Greeks saw the ideal poet . . . Goethe is such a poet too . . . His genius is great enough to make him one of the great educators, one of the highest authorities - for all nations. " (p. 201) There are two reasons why Vietor's comparison of his poet with Homer is so signally apropos. The first is that it shows in what company the Harvard professor - bolstered perhaps by the Aspen extravaganza recently - would place the idol of his people. The second, and more important, is that in holding Goethe great enough to be one of the highest authorities for all nations, Vi~tor takes his stand overtly with those old Greek educators flayed by Plato for just such authority given by them to the writer of the Odyssey and Iliad In this land of academic freedom, surely there is room for the question as to whether Goethe who held man's thinking inevitably anthropomorphic, and was a voluntarist in philosophy (believing man's will stronger than his reason) is to be taken as a great educator - ranking with the highest authorities - for our broken-down nations. When Plato indicted Homer he was addressing a pagan people, himself a pagan though an extraordinary one. But the writer of GOETHE THE THINKER purports to speak to Christians in a Christian culture. And in what is given as a complete dossier on the German thinker's fitness for the post assigned him in Vietor's book -</page><page sequence="2">280 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Goethe's marvelous versatility, boundless intellectual curiosity bearing fruit in his original scientific researches, all of which is detailed here in a compact account of Carlyle 's hero 's "thousand voiced melody of wisdom' ' - we find his devotee making this plain statement of fact: "That Goethe did not accept the dogma of the Christian faith, the divinity of Christ and its verification in the resurrection and ascension, made him by creed a non-Christian." (p. 88) Let us make no mistake about this man-centered humanist. Like Toynbee he held strongly to the value of religion, believing Christianity" the last thing to which humanity could and should arrive. " He saw the Christian as the highest religious "type'" and he believed that "type " to have been preceded in history by ethnic and philosophic "types." Christ to Goethe (yes, and to his disciiple, Schweitzer) is just the "divine manifestation of the highest principle of morality." There is a very subtle distinction to be made right at this point between what Goethe himself calls the grayness of theory in contrast with the green leaves of the Tree of Life. The great poet knew well how mighty that differ- ence is, and through Mephisto he spoke the truth in these words: "Grau, teurer Freund, ist alle Theorie, Und griin des Lebens goldner Baum." But Mephisto's is not quite the whole truth. The gray mists of theory provide the necessary atmosphere in which that tree is to grow. The writer of these lines by his very lip-service, his belief in Christianity as Saul believed in David's song of life, refuses to let the belief rise to the realm of action: "He saith, 'It is good;' still he drinks not: he lets me praise life, Gives assent, yet would die for his own part." Where, then, can this German poet - who for all his exquisite sense of the pitfalls in the relating of theory to life, yet, by his failure to make the Christian life his own, fell at once into the error dating from Eden - hope to lead ust Is he not himself caught in the very trap against which he warns, the trap waiting for all who bridle from the path of wisdomf To put it another way, he is the blind leader of the blind who takes us into the ditch. We find Vi~itor insisting, even at the end of his discussion of Goethe's non-Christianity, on the Goethean all-out lip-service to Christianity: "Fundamentally, Goethe always viewed and revered Christianity as the highest kind of personal Humanitiit, as sublimest ethics." (p. 93). Elsewhere I have maintained that Goethe really represents that pride by which the angels fell, and further that the debacle in Germany that was nazism is always sooner or later in store for persons or nations following the Goethean principle. Though scholars in Germany and in America (including Hunter's President, George N. Schuster) protested vehemently against the charge that Goethe - on whose cosmopolitan dogmas Hitler and his henchmen put a very soft pedal indeed - was in any way responsible for the diabolism that was nazism, nonetheless I hold to my conviction. And I hold it after reading Vieitor's book, which shows better than has yet been shown the general</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 281 public in America to what extent Goethe was indeed the epitome of human culture -- yet an ephemeral culture with no roots. For the real error in estimating Goethe is that we do not know or care about his reanl philosophy, and do not see how completely anti-intellectualist he really was. The atmosphere of his own green tree of life was just this: a perverse and pervasive nature-worship which though it habitually used Christian terms was as anti-Christian as it was anti-rational. His religion resolved itself into the plaything of his moods (we recall Nature appearing at times as God 's eternal Maytime to Werther, and again the same scene showing her "red in tooth and claw," an everlastingly voracious monster); that he was basicailly agoostic shows through all he said regarding the Christian story, whether in his much-quoted passage in Wilhelm Meister about the three reverences or his letter to Herder calling Christianity a fairytale. Thus - though still holding Goethe as great a poet as Homer if need be - for the same reason that Plato objected to his race's ideal poet being held at once the ideal educator, we who take the Christian creed as divine revelation will never take Goethe as our light and leading in a time of crisis.
