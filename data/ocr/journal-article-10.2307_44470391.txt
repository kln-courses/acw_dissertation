Chandler FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute ABSTRACT The dynamic impact test of a section of passenger airplane fuselage provided an opportunity to measure the loads transferred to an airplane floor by the passenger seat legs. Since placement of a force transducer between the seat legs and the aircraft floor could not be done without adversely affecting the validity of the measurements, it was necessary to develop an alternative instrumentation technique. The method chosen was to install strain gages on the legs of the seats and to calibrate the strain gage output in terms of forces transmitted to the floor of a rigid test fixture during sled tests of each seat. The instrumentation methods, the acquired data, and an analysis of the results of the calibration procedure are presented in this paper. INTRODUCTION KNOWLEDGE OF THE DYNAMIC FORCES acting between seats and the floor of an aircraft during impact conditions is important for developing efficient crashworthy structure for the seats and for the aircraft airframe. Dynamic tests conducted at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI) have provided data describing floor force reactions for a variety of seat types (1,2,3)*, but those tests used a rigid test fixture to simulate the floor of the aircraft. Concern that force data obtained in tests with a rigid floor structure might differ from data which would be obtained with a "real" floor prompted an attempt to measure the floor force reactions in a longitudinal dynamic test of a transport airplane fuselage section. Such a test was initiated by the FAA in 1986 (4). Since installation of discrete force transducers between the lees of a seat and the 'floor of an aircraft would alter the normal load path and thus raise doubt as to the validity of the data thus obtained, it was necessary to develop a measurement technique which would not alter the structure or the installation of the seat assemblies in the aircraft. It was decided to install strain gages on the metal legs of the seat assemblies, and to calibrate the output of the strain gages in terms of reaction force on the rigid test fixture used in the seat dynamic tests. The seats would be installed in the test fuselage section, and strain gage output would then measured during the longitudinal dynamic test. The calibration data obtained on the seat tests would then be used to estimate the floor reaction forces which occurred during the fuselage section test. TEST ITEMS The seat assemblies used in this effort were provided by the FAA Technical Center. All seat assemblies were used and had been taken out of service. Nine triple seat assemblies, four starboard side and five port side assemblies, were provided. They were all the same model. Each had been modified (in accordance with the findings of previous CAMI tests) so that they could withstand the high dynamic loads planned for the fuselage section tests. The modifications included the addition of gussets joining the front and rear lateral tubes of the seat frame to the seat legs and the local filling of the lateral tubes with rigid epoxy at leg and spreader attachment areas to preclude collapse of the tubes. The seat assemblies were rigid, without energy absorbing or load limiting features, and weighed approximately 105 pounds. The seat legs were made i&gt;f thin wall steel tubing with a square cross section. Strain gages had been installed on the seat legs at the locations shown in Figure 1. *Numbers in parentheses designate references at the end of the paper. 1.921 0096-736X/89/9701 -0921 $02.50 Copyright 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">At each location, four strain gages were installed to create a "full bridge" transducer. The gages forming the two active arms of the bridge were aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tube, and the gages forming the two inactive arms were aligned perpendicular to the active arms. Pairs of gages consisting of one active and one inactive arm were installed on opposite external sides of the tube. SEAT DYNAMIC TEST PROGRAM The instrumented seat assemblies were tested at CAMI's dynamic impact test facility in June, 1987. Figure 2 shows a typical seat assembly test setup. Each seat assembly was mounted on the rigid test sled fixture in a forward facing orientation corresponding to that of the fuselage section test. The test fixture, which positioned triaxial load cells under each leg of the seat assembly, was adjusted to provide a flat mounting plane for the seats; i.e., there was no induced floor deformation in these tests. Eight-inch lengths of aluminum floor track were fastened to steel plates bolted on top of the load cells, and the seats were installed in the floor track using their original front leg studs and rear leg locking attachments. Three 50th percentile Hybrid II type anthropomorphic test dummies were placed in the seat and restrained with lap belts. A floor level carpeted footrest was used to position the occupants' legs in the pre-test condition. CAMI's laboratory used a deceleration method to create the impact. The test sled was accelerated gently, at less than 1 g, to the desired impact velocity along a horizontal track by the pull of a cable attached to a falling weight. When the impact velocity was achieved, the weight was stopped so that the tension in the acceleration cable went slack and the sled was allowed to coast forward at a constant velocity for about ten feet. The sled then impacted a set of 0.25 inch diameter steel wires placed across the track. As the sled moved into the wires they were pulled over rollers anchored to the laboratory floor on both sides of the track. The action of the wires being pulled over the rollers plastically deforms (stretches) the wires a slight amount. The energy required to deform the wire controlled the deceleration of the sled. The onset rate, peak deceleration, and trailing edge of the impact pulse were pre-determined by selecting the position of the wires along the length of the deceleration distance, the number of wires at each position, and the length of the wires . Signals from the transducers on the sled and test specimens were recorded with a frequency multiplexed analog recording system and later digitized for filtering, processing, and plotting. The signal conditioning and processing conformed with SAE Recommended Practice J211b (5). High speed motion picture cameras filmed the impacts, and documentary photos were taken before and after each test.

Gage Locations Table 1 lists the tests completed for this project. The seat assemblies were arbitrarily identified with numbers 1 through 9. Since six of the seat assemblies were to be used again on the fuselage impact tests, the impact test severity for the seat dynamic tests was established to insure that the seats were not damaged and that the strain gage transducers would produce a significant range of signal output to enable calibration of the seats at the impact severity anticipated for the fuselage section test. Seat assemblies 1, 2, and 3 were used for this purpose. In these tests it was found that a 9 g peak (Gpk) impact from 26 ft /sec would provide a satisfactory seat dynamic test condition. Tests at higher severity resulted in minor deformation of the seat assembly which was judged unacceptable for seats to be used again on the fuselage section test. Six tests were then conducted for strain gage calibration. The final test was done with a Gpk of 20 g's at a velocity of 52 ft/sec to determine failure loads and where the failures occurred on these seats. RESULTS Figures 3 through 7 show the data acquired from a typical test. Note that the unit of measurement of the data from the strain gage transducers is millivolts per volt rather than microstrain or stress. This unit of electronic output was chosen to simplify the instrumentation calibration procedures and to insure comparability with the data acquired from the fuselage section impact test to be conducted later. It also avoided the implication that these data could reflect some actual maximum strain or stress on the seat assembly. Such an implication would be incorrect since the simple strain gage installation could not measure the complex strain pattern likely to exist in the 1.922</page><page sequence="3">881376 Figure 2. Typical Test Setup structure. Cross plots for selected data from this test are shown in Figures 8 through 13. By generating cross plots from various combinations of data pairs, it was possible to assess the correlation of strain gage transducer data with force data from the floor load cells. The results of this assessment fell into three categories . The first category was easily identified as data with poor correlation between the strain gage transducer and the load cell responses. Figure 10 is in this category. Cross plots of data from these transducer locations were characterized by highly nonlinear data plots with gross hysteresis and often significant offset at the termination point. This poor correlation between the strain gage transducer data and the floor load cell data was attributed to the failure of a transducer or to the complex strain in the leg members which was not reflected in the force measured at the floor. The rear inboard leg gage sensors (locations 6 on port seats and 3 on starboard) seats were in this category. The second category was characterized by fairly close linear correlation of the data during the time period from onset to first peak. Figure 9 illustrates this category. After the first peak, which was usually the highest load point, the plot traces became inconsistent. This result may have been caused by the asymmetry of the seating positions over the seat legs or the complex loads delivered to the seat by the flailing masses of the occupants. These two factors could have induced enough bending or torsion in the leg members to affect the accuracy of the axially oriented strain gages. The rear outboard leg diagonal strain gage transducer (locations 2 for port seats and 5 for starboard seats) were in this category. The third category of cross plots was distinguished by reasonably good linear correlation during the entire test period. Figure 8 shows this result. Plots of the outboard front leg strain (location 1 on port seats and 4 on starboard seats) gage transducers versus the corresponding front leg vertical forces produced the best results. Since the front legs carry a primarily compressive load, the simple strain gage installation provided on these seat legs was capable of indicating that load with some degree of accuracy, so the linear relationship was good. DISCUSSION CALIBRATION PROCEDURE - «This series of sled tests investigated the feasibility of using dynamic impact seat test procedures to calibrate the strain gage transducers on the seat legs in terms of the dynamic force reaction between the seat legs and the floor. These procedures did identify certain strain gage transducers on each 1.923</page><page sequence="4">Table 1.

The test was repeated with A87087. (iii) Seat 2 was tested at 20 Gpk to determine failure loads and where the failures occurred . seat which were more suitable for reflecting certain floor forces. The data also showed limitations in this approach. The usefulness of the data from a strain gage transducer for measuring a floor dynamic load depended on the location of the gages on the leg member and the point in time during the dynamic load interval. The outboard rear legs experienced the highest force of the four legs on these seats. The strain gage transducer located on the outboard diagonal tube (location 2 for port side seats and location 5 for starboard seats) was representative of those forces until the time of the first peak force or strain. An approximately linear relationship was not maintained after that time. Fortunately, the first peak was the higest force measured during the seat test so that a representation of the peak floor force and the time of the peak floor force could be obtained from those strain gage transducers . Some gage locations, such as gage transducer 6 on inboard rear leg diagonal, produced rather unusual cross plot results as shown in Figure 13. However, the shape of this trace was consistent with those obtained from equivalent data on other seat tests. This similarity among test results provided some confidence of repeatability of results from the test procedure even though the data were not as useful for "calibration" of the strain gage transducer when compared to other data. APPLICATION OF RESULTS - The calibration tests with the six seats to be used on the fuselage section tests were all done with an impact of 9 Gpk and a velocity of 26 ft/sec. One of the fuselage section tests was planned for 14 Gpk and a velocity of 40 ft/sec. This more severe impact condition should produce greater strain in the seat legs and greater load in the floor. The calibration data from the CAMI sled tests must be extrapolated if it is to represent 1.924</page><page sequence="5">881376 the range of data expected on the fuselage section test. One of the preliminary CAMI sled tests, A88083, was conducted with 13 Gpk and a velocity of 40.6 ft/sec. This test resulted in some minor deformation of the seat frame. The cross plot of the data from the strain gage transducer on the outboard leg diagonal versus the data from the outboard rear floor load cell was similar to that found in the 9 Gpk tests. Figure 14 shows that the same onset to peak linear response characteristic occurred during the more severe impact. This result provided some confidence that this transducer output should be useful to the 13 Gpk test level. The seat orientation was the same for the GAMI tests series and the fuselage section tests. The impact pulse for the CAMI calibration tests and the fuselage section tests had a similar onset rate. Similar anthropomorphic test dummies were used in all tests. These comparable test conditions should simplify the application of the seat calibration test results to the data from the fuselage section impact tests. The most important difference between the CAMI and the fuselage section tests was the presence of multiple row seats in the fuselage section test. All of the calibration tests were single row seat impacts, while three rows of seats were on each side of the fuselage section. The effects on a seat legs' floor reactions due to the interaction of the occupants with the seats in front of them were not present in the CAMI calibration tests. However, the major portion of this effect will occur after the initial peak load, so that a functional calibration should be effective until that time. A second difference between the CAMI tests and the fuselage section tests was the difference in stiffness between the rigid test fixture used at CAMI and the floor of the aircraft. This calibration effort was undertaken with the assumption that while the difference in stiffness might change the floor forces, it would have little effect on the calibration. While there has been no evidence that this assumption was incorrect, it must be acknowledged that the assumption was important to the application of the calibration data. CONCLUSIONS This procedure of dynamically calibrating strain gage transducers installed on the seat legs did provide a limited method to monitor floor reaction loads in the fuselage section tests. The results of strain gage transducer data versus floor load cell force data correlation showed that not all transducer installations produced acceptable responses. Transducers on the front leg produced the best results. Transducers on the outboard leg diagonal members produced a good correlation of the floor force reaction at the rear outboard seat leg during the initial onset-to-peak time interval of the impact. The first peak force on the rear outboard leg was the highest force measured during the impact, and was thus a critical indication of the forces acting on an aircraft floor. These calibration methods should produce reasonably accurate floor load reaction data without the need for structural modification to the seats or aircraft floor in the fuselage section dynamic test.
