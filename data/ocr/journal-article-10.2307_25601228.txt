<plain_text><page sequence="1">KURT SCHLUETER Shelley's "To Night" and the Prayer Hymn of Classical Antiquity Shelley's poem "to night" has been frequently anthologized,1 which seems to suggest that it has been widely appreciated and under stood. But the amount of commentary it has received remains relatively small and rather controversial. This may be partly due to the fact that it was unfavorably treated at the beginning of the era of close reading.2 Earl Daniels, when teaching the gentle art of reading poetry, took Shelley's poem as a shining example of badness because of its failure to conform to "timeworn principles of unity, coherence, and emphasis" (Daniels 345). In his analysis of "To Night," he undertakes to show that "Shelley is an example of one who frequently sins against organization as a whole." Daniels goes on to describe how he sees the effect of the poet's verse: "Often with him men are made drunk on the sound of words, thinking lapses into inactivity, and feeling substitutes for judgement" (354). Deter mined to show up Shelley's lamentable weakness in conveying precise meanings, Daniels resorts to formulating questions that he thinks Shelley's poem will not answer: i.

Just why he wants her, what she, or he, will do, once she has put in an appearance, remains, I am afraid, something of a mystery. To be sure, line 32 talks of a favour to be asked, one not to be sought of either death or sleep. But unless that boon is simply that night will quicken her pace we are left very much in the dark, and so, unsatisfied. (356) At the end of his so-called analysis, Daniels begins his quod erat demon strandum line with: "At the end a reader discovers little has been said" (358). It is obvious that Daniels fails to appreciate the poem because he does not like Shelley's kind of poetry. This also, at least partly, accounts for his lack of understanding when it comes to determining the meaning of the poem. This blindness is related to a refusal to read the poem in the context of other English poems or to link it to poetic traditions typical of western culture as a whole. Harold Bloom, in the introductory chapter to his book Shelley's Myth making, takes "To Night" as a preliminary example of what he wishes his readers to understand by Shelley's mythopoeic poetry.3 Bloom's reading is informed by Martin Buber's teachings about I-Thou relationships4 as well as the writings of Henri and Henriette Frankfort on myth and mythical forms of experiencing the world.5 Unconcerned by such principles as troubled Daniels, Bloom recognizes in Shelley's "To Night" a form of urgent prayer. Unlike Daniels, Bloom encounters no insuperable difficulties in finding sufficiently precise statements: "In the final stanza the clarifica tion is complete, and the Night of the relationship which is embodied in the prayer that is this poem is exactly defined" (Bloom 7). For Bloom, the meaning of the poem is clear enough: His prayer ... is a prayer for the advent of that fully wakeful con sciousness which alone is life for him, and which comes only in the creative Night of his spirit, in the depth of himself which is the poetic faculty in him. (8) Bloom's reading indubitably marks a decisive advance in the critical appreciation of Shelley's poem. It remains to be seen whether Bloom's view can be strengthened further and perhaps accounted for in even more concrete terms. 3.

He does not seem to have been impressed by anything his younger coUeague Bloom had said about "To Night" some eight years earlier. There is no indication whatsoever that Winters had taken critical notice of Bloom's book. Winters recognizes the widespread popularity of SheUey's poem among readers of poetry, for which he seems to blame the bad taste of numerous anthologists. Like Daniels, Winters diagnoses a deplorable lack of precision when he states: "The poem is a prayer to Night to come quickly, but we are not told why." In attempting to find the meaning of SheUey's lines, Winters relies not only on his own perceptions but also on hearsay, which he supports by biographical arguments and an account of general impressions: I have heard it said that SheUey wished to hasten an assignation with a lady, and this is possible; for one thing, SheUey is the author, and, for another, the imagery is erotic. But it may be merely an expression of the common romantic love of night, the home of mystery and the stars.6 SheUey's poem receives more favorable treatment from Judith Chernaik. Her commentary advances beyond the kind of insights Daniels and Winters offer, but she does not reach a firm conclusion. She seems to have profited so little from Bloom's discussion of the poem that it looks as if she did not read his book until she herself had done with the poem. Chernaik ap proaches the meaning of "To Night" in the light of two other SheUeyan texts. She compares it first with the little-known "Epithalamium," which SheUey wrote for a play by Edward WiUiams, and this causes her to stress the erotic content of the poem: the personal expression of urgent longing for a bridal night. Chernaik then proceeds to compare "To Night" with SheUey's "Ode to the West Wind," which leads her to modify her former insights: "While the 'Epithalamium' is a formal celebration of love, 'To Night' can be read without reference to love or sexual desire, as a poem about the creative imagination, or death."7 FinaUy, Chernaik refers to SheUey's poem "Song: 'Rarely, rarely, comest thou'" and remarks briefly on the different roles of speakers in poems depicting personal distress. It so happens that each of the three texts that Chernaik draws upon to elucidate SheUey's "To Night" belongs to a formal tradition in the poetry 6.

Readers will find it hard to agree with Chernaik's statement that "'To Night' can be read without reference to love or sexual desire," and they should be even more energetically opposed to her description of the poem as being "a poem about . . . death."</page><page sequence="4">242 KURT SCHLUETER of western civilization that makes use of hymnic forms of speech that were once employed by Greek and Latin poets and that can be traced back to what scholars of classical antiquity call the hymnos kledkos. It therefore remains to be seen whether a reading of Shelley's "To Night" in the light of this tradition will be able to furnish us with a better understanding of the poem's structure and meaning. Such an attempt will meet with two kinds of difficulty. First, compared with other poems belonging to this hymnic tradition, Shelley's "To Night" is a relatively short poem. Readers must therefore be prepared to recognize rigorously condensed versions of what were traditionally more elaborate features of the hymnic rhetoric. Second, readers should not expect to find Shelley imitating hymnic forms of speech slavishly. More than many other poems in this tradition, "To Night" shows considerable originality in its use of conventional formal elements. These variations will have to be recognized as such and must be accounted for in the present reading of the poem. It may well be that Paul Fry did not include a discussion of "To Night" in his book on the English Ode8 for the simple reason that in this poem Shelley treats the elements of the hymnic tradition with far greater freedom than in his other poems. It is conceivable that Fry wished to avoid a conflict of aims. The existence of a tradition of imitating the Greek hymns had to be established first before the productivity of this tradition as displayed in daring variations on the original patterns could be recognized. There is a brief description of the hymnos kletikos in Menander's Epideik tikon.9 But since the form of the ancient Greek prayer hymn is not as well-known as it deserves to be, despite the fact that it has proved im mensely productive in English literature as well as in other literatures of western civilization, a somewhat more detailed description of its essentials shall be given here. The rhetorical structure known to students of ancient Greek literature as the hymnos kletikos comprises three basic parts. First is an invocation or section in which a speaker addresses a numinous power in distinctly ceremonial forms. This is followed by a second section in which the specific powers of the deity are praisingly characterized. The third section concludes the hymn with a request. The speaker's praise of a particular deity may take various forms. The name given the deity is usually amplified by honorific titles and references to the god's distinguished ancestors and other important family members. Praise of the god's power usually takes the additional form of stories told about his deeds or, alternatively, lists enumerating such deeds. Another 8. Paul H. Fry, The Poet's Calling in the English Ode (New Haven: Yale UP, 1980). 9. Donald A. Russell and Nigel G. Wilson, eds. and trans., Menander Rhetor (Oxford: Clarendon, 1987) 13-17.</page><page sequence="5">"TO NIGHT" AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 243 distinctive conventional element in the praise section concerns the deity's attendants, companions, helpers, and foUowers, who may also be described in detail or simply Usted. The praise section may also include a brief description of the invoked person's outward appearance or, as is more often the case, a brief reference to bodily parts or significant elements of dress. Mention may also be made of tools or other attributes that are felt to characterize the invoked deity emblematicaUy. The initial invocation and ensuing praise of the invoked power are usuaUy connected by means of relative epiclese. The final part of the prayer hymn is the topos preces containing the speaker's wish. This often begins with a brief renewal of the address. Most importandy, it is preceded by the speaker's request that the invoked deity appear, usuaUy expressed by the optative form of the verb "come" or one of its synonyms. The importance of the wish that the invoked power appear derives from the fact that in original Uturgical usage the speaker thought the deity's presence to be necessary for the deity to be able to put his powers into effect and grant the plea that occasioned a particular prayer. The importance of this precondition is further underhned by the fact that the caU for the invoked power to appear led to the naming of this specific kind of hymn as hymnos kletikos, which UteraUy means calUng upon some one in the sense of wishing their presence.10 The prayer hymn often includes a fourth element, mnemosyne, which is usuaUy wedged in between part 2 (the praising description of the deity's power) and part 3 (the speaker's concluding prayer). At this stage, the speaker often reminds the invoked deity of the good personal relations already existing between them. The topos may therefore refer to instances of help previously given by the invoked power to the speaker and/or pledges and tributes offered up to the deity by the adorant. Clearly, the rhetorical structure of the prayer hymn is a logicaUy coherent and perfecdy ordered form of speech. A speaker with a certain need turns to the divinity he thinks wiU be most able to satisfy that need. After addressing the numinous being in order to gain attention, the speaker praises and characterizes the deity's power in direct proportion to the urgency of his need. The speaker's praise is meant to propitiate the godhead. But in characterizing the supernatural powers of the invoked deity, the adorant can also assure himself of his or her abiUty to help in the special case at hand. Some readers wiU ask how SheUey is supposed to have known aU this. The question wiU be difficult to answer if we are required to name a io. David West, in Reading Horace (Edinburgh: Edinburgh UP, 1967), describes the rhetoric of this particular kind of hymn as "the formula for asking a god to come and help" (92).</page><page sequence="6">244 KURT SCHLUETER specific source for Shelley's poem but relatively easy once we take account of two things. First, Shelley's schooling and poetic leanings mean that he would have been familiar with almost any number of classical texts that display the properties of the rhetorical construct delineated above. Second, his knowledge of literature and mythology probably gave rise to his own very personal mythical approach to human experience, upon which he drew in creating his poetic fictions. Shelley, it has been said, "was never sympathetic to Roman literature, with the . . . exception of Lucretius . . . Lucan, Virgil, and Horace," whereas Greek literature was for him "almost a way of life."11 Be that as it may, anyone who had to study Latin at prep school, at Eton, as well as at Oxford, can hardly have escaped exposure to the so-called "odes" of Horace. Poem 1.35 of Horace's carmina presents a perfect example of the type of poem under discussion here. The humanists of the western world were fully aware of this fact when they gave it the title "Ad Fortunam." It is a hymnically supported prayer to this goddess to protect the Emperor, Augustus.12 Shelley's studies of Latin poetry may also have led to his reading some of the Greek models, in which case he would more than likely have also encountered Sappho's poem to Aphrodite. One could say that a thorough understanding of these two poems alone would have been sufficient to enable Shelley to write the kind of hymnic poetry to which his poem "To Night" must be considered to belong. Add to these and other specimens of the individual Greek lyric the vast realms of choric poetry, the hymns incorporated into tragedies, as well as the many hymnic invocations to be found *in epic writing, and it should become sufficiently clear that the bridge linking the use of this ancient liturgical form by classical poets and its revival by more recent poets is an extremely broad one. In Shelley's case, we must add to the examples of classical poetry those of his English colleagues who, in imitating and adapting classical precedents, had already established a modern, secondary tradition. The first to use this hymnic model were Sir Philip Sidney and John Milton. The so-called pre-romantics, Gray and Collins in particular, came next, then Wordsworth and Coleridge, followed by Keats and Shelley. New studies might show that Sir Edmund Spenser and even Shakespeare also linked up with this tradition on occasion. Besides those poems produced in the course of the revival, continuation, and renewal of this classical tradition, one must also mention such poets 11. Timothy Webb, The Violet in the Crucible: Shelley and Translation (Oxford: Clarendon, io76) 3, and 19. For the later development of Shelley's interest in Greek literature and the influence of Peacock, Hunt, and Hogg, see Webb 53-59, 59-61, and 61-62 respectively. 12. N. E. Collinge, The Structure of Horace's Odes (London: Oxford UP, 1961) 126-27.</page><page sequence="7">"TO NIGHT" AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 245 and those of their poems that seem so adventurous and original in their use of these traditional rhetorical elements that their relation to the main tradition becomes a Uttle harder to detect: for instance, John Donne and his otherwise well-known sonnet "Death be not proud," Milton and his heroical sonnets, Edgar AUan Poe and his "Sonnet?To Science," and Coleridge and his poem "France: An Ode." To this series must now be added SheUey and his poem "To Night," as the foUowing discussion of his use of the various traditional formal elements in this poem wiU show. We begin by reminding ourselves that adjurations start with the caUer's magical wielding of the power's name. It is therefore customary for a hymn to begin with the invoked power's name. The adorant often employs several names, and naming is usuaUy accompanied by epithets and titles that characterize the deity. In SheUey's poem "To Night," the naming of the invoked power as "Spirit of Night" (line 2) is very short and somewhat unusual.13 The form of this invocation may leave readers in initial doubt as to whether the phrase "Spirit of Night" is to be read as a title or a name. But before reaching the end of the poem, they wiU learn that "Night" is the name of the power in question. Readers wiU also recognize that they have not been alone in their doubts. For they wiU hear of other numinous powers in the fictional world of the poem who share their doubts and therefore tentatively answer the speaker's caU. These beings are "Sleep" (24) and "Death" (22), and we wiU have to return to them later. More remarkable stiU is the fact that in SheUey's poem the speaking voice begins with a request: "Swiftly walk o'er the western wave" (1). As already suggested, this is not the request proper but an introductory wish for the invoked power to appear and demonstrate his powers. The rest of the first stanza of SheUey's poem is more conventional. We are given a praising description of the invoked godhead's nature, in which we find the foUowing typical elements: mention of the abode of the addressed power, "the misty eastern cave" (3); the relative pronoun usuaUy connecting the invocation and the description, here represented by "Where" (4); and, finaUy, the taking up of the gesture of address through the use of the personal pronoun "Thou" (5). The essential characterization, however, lies in the very short description of what the deity habituaUy performs, weaving "dreams of joy and fear" (5), which replaces the con ventional story or list of deeds performed. It is this activity that elicits from the poem's persona those emotions that have been described as typicaUy 13- All quotations are taken from Thomas Hutchinson, ed., Shelley: Poetical Works, 2nd. ed., corr. G. M. Matthews (1905; Oxford: Oxford UP, 1970) 636-37.</page><page sequence="8">246 KURT SCHLUETER human reactions to the presence of the numinous: terror and fascination. The poem registers these emotions in the adjectives "terrible" and "dear" (6). The second stanza continues the description of the invoked deity. Again, we find conventional elements being used with considerable originality. Like other personifications, the mythical figure of Night is furnished with pieces of dress and tools indicating the essential nature of the divinity. Night's "mande gray, / Star-inwrought" (8-9) tells us that the speaking persona's visionary power builds upon the normal human capacity for vision. Night's "opiate wand" (13) implies great supernatural power, and we should be aware not only of the sleep-inducing properties of opium but, even more so, of its dream-producing effects. The second stanza further reminds readers that the phrase "Spirit of Night" primarily serves to indicate that in this poem "Night" has been accorded the status of a numinous presence. But despite its spiritual quality, we find this deity furnished with hair that can be used to "Blind . . . the eyes of Day" (10) and (by implication) with a mouth that can "Kiss" (11). Such mentioning of bodily parts is, of course, as conventional as the indication of pieces of dress and the description of emblematic tools. The first stanza reveals that the ability to fabricate dreams is an essential part of invoked Night's nature. The second stanza completes and continues this revelation while clearly suggesting that "Night" has its amorous side, too. The use in this stanza of imperative or optative verbs, which are traditionally reserved for the concluding part of the hymn, is again highly unconventional. In stanzas three and four, the poem's persona reveals how he or she has spent the day. The plea for "Night" to come quickly is supported by the depiction of the persona's urgent longing in stanza three and demonstration of faithfulness in stanza four, where the persona is presented as someone who has turned down alternative offers and deserves to have his or her wish fulfilled. Seen in terms of the topoi of the hymn, these two stanzas should be understood as standing for what critics call mnemosyne, where the supplicant reminds the invoked power of former good relations be tween the two of them. Shelley's two stanzas must be seen as constituting a highly original version of this traditional formal element on account of the content, the length of the passage measured against the length of the hymn as a whole, and its position in relation to the main plea. Stanza four makes use of another set of elements traditionally employed by writers of hymns in further defining the invoked power, namely, genealogical features. The term genealogy as used in this context is often extended to include social relationships that go beyond strict family ties, for a divinity may work together with other numinous powers who are its subjects as well as with powers who are related to it genealogically. Again,</page><page sequence="9">"TO NIGHT" AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 247 we find that SheUey's use of tradition involves significant variations. Con ventionaUy, such groupings are used to indicate the nature of the deity by showing him or her appearing in the company of other family members and/or assisted by other sorts of helpers. SheUey inverts this traditional procedure. He stiU uses family members to define the nature of the invoked power but not by adding their powers to that of the main deity. Instead, he invents a scheme of logical subtraction that shows the family members competing against each other rather than working together. SheUey's invention clarifies the meaning of "Night" by eliminating associations with death and sleep. The poet obviously wishes to stress the active side of his personification of Night: dream-weaving and amorosity. A loving streak might be said to run in the family. "Night" is expected to perform in a distincdy amatory way the tasks it has been set: "BUnd with thine hair the eyes of Day; / Kiss her until she be wearied out" (io-n). "Sleep" offers to nesde near the speaker's side (26). Even "Death," brother and uncle to "Night" and "Sleep" respectively, seems ever ready to run up and soothe a longing soul (22-23). The adorant's main request is mentioned in the poem's concluding stanza: "the boon / I ask of thee, beloved Night" (32-33). What had hitherto been uncertain now becomes perfectly clear: "Night" is not a tide but a name in this context. The epithet, "beloved," combined with the name is untraditional in that it does not characterize the powers of the named being but expresses the personal feeUngs of the speaker. The plea itself is doubly veiled: it is not speUed out but paraphrased and does not appear in the conventional imperative or optative form of the verb, which in this poem is reserved for what is traditionaUy the subsidiary wish requesting the deity's presence. The inexplicit wording of the petition must be deemed very unusual indeed, because it is here that speakers voice their needs. Readers of the poem are not explicidy informed what boon is asked. The power addressed need not be told, for the relationship between adorant and god has been delineated throughout as one between two lovers, one of whom urgently longs to be united with the other but not merely for amorous satisfaction. Readers who are famiUar with the proce dures embodied in the rhetorical formulae of the prayer hymn wiU infer the precise purpose of the plea from the description given of the invoked deity's powers. It wiU then become clear that the speaker?through his or her union with "Night"?seeks participation in the dream-weaving powers of the godhead. The poem is not at aU vague but draws a veil of decency over what experienced readers can speU out for themselves. The author conceives of the process of inspiration as being comparable to the fertili zation of a woman. Though it may come as a surprise to readers, there</page><page sequence="10">248 KURT SCHLUETER can be no doubt that the persona's muse here is a male deity and that the persona seeking an assignation is therefore female.14 Developments sub sequent to the initial mythical encounter are easily foreseen: once the persona has conceived, she will bring the poem into the light of the world after the necessary period of gestation. Readers who have followed the present argument thus far may wish to pause here and deliberate. Is the new reading of "To Night" offered here the result of Shelley's striking originality or the idiosyncracies of one particular critic? Difficult though it may be to accustom oneself to Shelley's revolutionary way of depicting the creative act as an act of insemination, it is not altogether without precedent. Shakespeare's sonnets, for instance, are dedi cated to "Mr. W. H." as to "the onlie begetter."15 Furthermore, readers of Shakespeare may often feel tempted to identify the "muse" encountered in these sonnets with the enigmatic "Mr. W. H." of the dedication. It must be said, however, that "muse" and "begetter" are both used only figura tively in this context. While Shelley's "To Night" does not employ either of these words as such, the concepts they represent may be nonetheless legitimately applied to the relationship between the speaker of the poem and the figure of Night. Dream-weaving "Night" corresponds to the muse with which the speaker longs to be united, and the act of begetting can be expected to take place in the very near future. If the implied act seems shocking because so literal, readers should remind themselves that it is to be imagined as taking place in a fictional universe. The fictionality of the poem has an effect somewhat similar to the figurativeness of the wording of the non-fictional dedication to the sonnets, mitigating the impact on the reader. Shelley's seemingly unique way of depicting the relationship between poetry and the poet may gain further acceptance when we realize that works of art are often thought of as the offspring or children of their makers. The convention can be traced back to Plato's Symposium, where Diotima draws a parallel between procreation and creating poetry in order to express her preference for what she refers to as the offspring of Homer, Hesiod, and other good poets.16 14- Neither the sexual identity of the speaker nor that of the addressee are fixed in the text. But the description of Night's amatory activity better fits a male person. The poem's persona should therefore be thought of as being female. For a discussion of the textual crux concerning the sexual identity of "Day," see 257-59 below. 15. For a convincing argument ruling out the possibility that begetter here could mean "procurer," see the relevant part of the note on the dedication in W. G. Ingram and Theodore Redpath, eds., Shakespeare's Sonnets (London: U of London P, 1964) 3-5. 16. In Shelley's translation, The Banquet, the relevant passage reads: "what posterity Homer and Hesiod and the other great poets have left behind them ... or what children</page><page sequence="11">"TO NIGHT" AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 249 In postulating a parent-offspring relationship between poets and the fruits of their artistic labor, Plato's Diotima is not necessarily implying that male poets must assume the woman's part in the act of creation. Could this, then, be the real stumbUng block that makes the right reading of SheUey's poem "To Night" so difficult? But even the concept of the poet as progenitress is not as unique as it may at first sight seem. Donald Reiman, in The Study of Modem Manuscripts, quotes Gerard Manley Hopkins' sonnet "To R[obert] B[ridges],"17 in which the poet's mind is depicted as an expectant widow mother whose womb, impregnated by "The fine delight that fathers thought" (line i), brings forth an "immortal song" (4) after an Horatian nine-year period of gestation. SheUey, of course, could not have read Hopkins' poem. But who would be so bold as to rule out finding formulations similar to this prior to SheUey's "To Night"? Put another way: why should SheUey's inventiveness have not gone down the same road as Hopkins' did? The case for the reading of "To Night" offered here is further strength ened by SheUey himself in his Defence of Poetry. Timothy Webb, in his discussion of this treatise, teUs us that SheUey found it quite natural to adopt traditional phrases that present poetry as the product of a love relationship: To him, poetry and love were, in some senses, interchangeable terms: both involved a going out of our own nature and an identification with the beautiful. Throughout the Defence love is used as a metaphor for poetry and the poetic process: for example, the onset and departure of inspiration is described in terms which might characterise with equal precision the sexual event.18 In reworking views of the poet as the progenitor or progenitress of a work of art, SheUey's poem draws radical conclusions from the romantic conception of poetry as being quasi-organic. By turning a verbal analogy into a dramatic representation, SheUey reactivated a concept that was already on the way to becoming conventional. SheUey's "To Night" is as original in its depiction of the relationship of the poet to the source of his inspiration as it is in its adaptation of the of his soul Lycurgus has appointed ... or what an illustrious progeny of laws Solon has produced, and how many admirable achievements . . . men have left as the pledges of that love" (James A. Notopoulos, "Shelley's Translations from Plato: A Critical Edition," The Platonism of Shelley: A Study ofPlatonism and the Poetic Mind [Durham, North Carolina: Duke UP, 1949]: 373-603, esp. 448). 17.

Timothy Webb, Shelley: A Voice Not Understood (Manchester: Manchester UP, 1977) 48.</page><page sequence="12">250 KURT SCHLUETER traditional elements of the prayer hymn. The foregoing analysis shows that almost every one of the traditional topoi of the hymn has undergone change, but the most spectacular variation concerns Shelley's use of the topos preces. He first loosens the connection between the plea for divine help from what is traditionally a subsidiary request for the deity to appear, then shifts the emphasis to what was conventionally almost a matter of course by multi plying the request for the deity's presence: "Swiftly walk" (i), "Swift be thy flight!" (7), "Wrap" (8), "Then wander" (12), "Swift be thine ap proaching flight" (34), "Come soon, soon!" (35). Variations of this plea thus energize every part of the poetic utterance. The request, which usually comes at the end of the prayer hymn, now begins and ends the poem and is renewed several times in between. What is conveyed by all this is a sense of enormous amatory urgency. Harold Bloom found in Shelley's "To Night" an excellent example of what he calls mythopoeic poetry. This term describes the poet as the creator of the kind of story that in ancient times told believers about the remarkable actions of their gods. Strange to say, some literary critics have gone so far as to ask whether Shelley believed in the supernatural figures with which he peopled his own creations. In times when poetry was primarily read as the expression of an individual poet's own particular view of the world, such questions seemed more important than they do today, when a poem is primarily seen as a construct of linguistic elements used to present an a-personal meaning. Shelley's use of words in "To Night" does not intend to convince readers that Mr. Percy B. Shelley believed in a divinity called "Night." But the poem can be said to succeed or fail in the same measure as the poet can convince readers through his use of words that the poem's persona believes in the efficacy of using prayer to propitiate a deity of the kind depicted. Jonathan Culler's view, which contends that in post-Enlightenment times all invocations imply a sort of self-critical disbelief, reaches its limits here.19 The fictionality of the world depicted in Shelley's poem concerns both parties in the dramatic encounter, addressee and speaker, and there is not the slightest reason why the poem's persona should distance herself from the verbal action she performs. Just the opposite is the case. It is the depiction of the speaker's absolute confidence in the efficacy of her invo cation that best serves to convince readers of a poetic fiction that makes of Night a numinous power capable of letting mortals partake of his dream-weaving capacities. This can be achieved only by the uninhibited 19- Jonathan Culler, The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction (London: Roudedge, 1981) 135-54, esp. 143-46?.</page><page sequence="13">"TO NIGHT" AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 251 and unashamed use of invocation. Other aspects of the poetic fiction wiU be found to be less immediately dependent on this rhetorical device. These features do not so much demand a wiUing suspension of disbeUef as a wiUingness to think afresh about such traditional views, concepts, and images as the idea that inspirational forces are always female. What readers also need to develop is the abiUty to see that it is possible for a male poet to write poems in which the projected persona appears to be of the opposite gender. Notwithstanding the merely fictional nature of the myth as imp?ed by the ritual represented in the poem, "To Night" lends itself to an aUegorical reading as much as do other stories of this sort. SheUey indicates a first step toward such an interpretation in the very last stanza, where the reference to death has misled so many readers. At no point in the poem does the speaker share the romantic longing for death experienced and voiced by other poets in the poetry of the period. In this poem, "Death" is rejected precisely because it would mean the end of any possibility of experiencing life with the intensity provided by divine inspiration. The life-enhancing and Ufe-sustaining power of inspiration is underlined when the speaker points to the fact that she expects to faU into a state of listlessness comparable to death if the divine force to whom she is praying to appear should forever remain absent. The subsidiary clause "when thou [Night] art dead" (29) cannot be taken UteraUy since mythological personifications are usuaUy immortal. The ad jective "dead" should perhaps therefore be read figuratively as meaning something like "ineffectual" or, better stiU, simply "absent." The main clause "Death shaU come" (29) may be read as either a literal or a figurative statement. Taken UteraUy, the whole Une could be understood to mean that the figure of "Death" dismissed in the preceding stanza would be welcomed should inspiration cease to visit the speaker. But in this context the figurative reading seems preferable. The speaker raises the hymnic praise of the powers of Night to a new and higher plane by indicating that the difference between his presence and absence, between being granted and not being granted the asked-for boon, is to the poetess Uke the difference between living at the highest level of emotional and artistic activity on the one hand and feeling utterly empty, lost, and incapable of artistic conception and productivity on the other. A number of questions remain that cannot be answered by reference to the rhetorical framework of the ancient Greek prayer hymn that has been seen to shape and inform SheUey's poem. Though such questions may be just as important as those that have been dealt with so far, the answers may turn out to be more tentative and perhaps even end in speculation.</page><page sequence="14">252 KURT SCHLUETER Foremost of these questions is why Shelley chose to represent the divine force of poetic inspiration as a personification of Night. The very originality of this choice is in itself important, because it testifies strikingly to the vitality of the interest the author took in these matters. A conventional invocation to the Muses could never have had the same power to convince readers of the same degree of genuine seriousness on the author's part. Shelley's evident interest in these matters is further documented by the multiplicity of his artistic attempts to adduce or create other poetic images with the same function. Even if we select only a few of these, we find images ranging from figures as nearly conventional and literary as the Muse Urania addressed in "Adonais" to other images of inspirational forces that seem to be entirely of the author's own creation. Here, in particular, we should be prepared to recognize the same reality behind experiences as different temperamentally as the onslaught of a tempest and a loving communion, as depicted in the "Ode to the West Wind" and the poem "To Night" respectively. But even if the original and various ways in which Shelley projected his experience bespeak genuine concern on the part of the author, we cannot entirely neglect links between Shelley's "To Night" and other poems suggesting that some parts of the day are more conducive to writing poetry than others. Collins' "Ode to Evening" will immediately come to mind here. Nobody would wish to entirely rule out the possibility of reading Shelley's poem in such a superficial way. But the particulars of the poem's diction, as well as the traditions we sense behind these forms of speech, show such a reading to be inadequate, and they oblige us to search for mythological backgrounds that might be found to be more significant in informing Shelley's choice of Night as a symbol of poetic inspiration. Night as a mythological figure does not play an important role in Greek religion, as is illustrated by the epic poetry of Homer. Many readers will therefore be inclined to disregard the possibility of any Greek influence on Shelley's creation. But Night as a divinity figures more prominently in three different subsections of ancient Greek literature, namely, Hesiodian theogony,20 Aeschylean tragedy, and Orphic rhapsody.21 Any one of these, 20. Hesiod, Theogony, ed. Martin L. West (Oxford: Clarendon, 1966), and Hesiod, Theogony, Works and Days, Shield, trans. Apost?los N. Athanassakis (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1983). 21. See Ivan M.

West, The Orphic Poems (Oxford: Clarendon, 1983), esp. 118 and 234-37.</page><page sequence="15">"TO NIGHT" AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 253 or any combination of them, may have contributed to the creation of SheUey's "Night." Let us discuss each of these three possibilities in turn. The Night of Hesiod's Theogony has an obvious claim to be one of the literary predeces sors of SheUey's "Night," because in this ancient mythological poem Night appears as the mother of Sleep and Death and of the so-caUed brood of Dreams?to mention only those of Hesiod's personifications that reappear in SheUey's poem. SheUey's dependence on Hesiod seems clear even if the hymnic tide "Mother of Dreams" given to "Night" in a draft of SheUey's poem was not retained in the later fair copy and subsequent pubUshed versions.22 Furthermore, "Death" has changed from a child of Night in Hesiod to a brother of "Night" in SheUey's poem. But real obstacles to easy iden tification arise when we begin to consider other differences between the two Nights. Hesiodian Night figures more prominently in the earlier, cosmogonie Unes of the poem rather than in the later, th?ogonie parts. She is one of the primeval cosmic forces named immediately after Chaos has been mentioned as the beginning of aU existence. As such, Hesiodian Night need not be thought of as being anthropomorphic. SheUey's "Night" clearly is. The sexual identity of Hesiod's Night seems to constitute more and more of a problem the longer one thinks about it. The feminine gender of the Greek noun nyx leads naturaUy to a female personification. But in Hesiod's Theogony the situation is more compUcated than this to the extent that female Night is accompanied by her brother, Darkness. The two seem to be as nearly alike as identical twins would be if these could belong to opposite sexes. The next cosmogonie step is Night's giving birth to Day and Brightness, both of whom are fathered by Darkness. Like their parents, the two children also appear to be identical twins in aU but sex. Could it be that the reUgious imagination of the Greeks created these two pairs of seemingly identical twins to replace the bisexual primeval forces of the Orient? We might suspect as much when we learn of a long Ust of other of Night's offspring for which Darkness is not responsible. To speak of parthenogenic births here seems somewhat inappropriate in view of what we are told about Night and Darkness, though it must be admitted that to caU these other ch?dren fatherless would only introduce an unwanted air of Victorian melodrama into the discussion. Let it therefore suffice to say that Night herself can perform feats for which other females need a male partner. 22. Mary A. Quinn, ed., Shelley's 1810^-1821 Huntingdon Notebook: A Facsimile of Hunting don MS. HM 2176, Manuscripts of the Younger Romantics/Percy Bysshe Shelley 6, gen. ed. Donald H. Reiman (New York: Garland, 1994) 16 and 17.</page><page sequence="16">254 KURT SCHLUETER The point about those of Night's children not fathered by Darkness is not only that they are large in number but also that they are overwhelm ingly unpleasant. Readers of Hesiod's Theogony must therefore be prepared to recognize that most members of the tribe of Dreams as mothered by Night do not naturally fall into the categories of fascinating poetic fictions or pleasant illusions. They are rather to be feared as oppressive nightmares. Best to conclude then that, if Shelley did draw at all on Hesiod's awesome divinity, the attractiveness with which he furnished his figure must have been either his own invention or derived from elsewhere. It might be added parenthetically that Hesiod's Theogony may have influenced not only Shelley's figure of Night but also his striking concep tion of how a poem comes into being. According to the mythological thinking of Hesiod, practically everything that exists is first engendered and then born into the world. Primeval Eros is among the deities present at the beginning of the world, and Love is the efficient cause of everything that has ever come into existence. Only a misunderstanding of the demi urgic function of love could lead to the prudish rejection of Shelley's poem by the mid-20th century critic mentioned above. Aeschylean tragedy is another subsection of ancient Greek literature that deserves attention from readers of "To Night," because the speaker in Shelley's poem is effectively shown to have a choice between two rival mythical figures: "beloved Night" (33) and "unloved [Day]" (20). If it is agreed that "To Night" can be read as an invocation to a force that inspires poetry, it becomes possible?given the image of "light r[iding] high . . . / [at] noon" (17/18)?to see the personification of Day in stanza three as Shelley's version of another traditional figure of literary mythology, namely, Apollo, god of poetry and leader of the Muses.23 The reason why the speaker of the poem should prefer to receive inspiration from "Night" rather than the god of day might become clearer if we look at the Aeschylean image of Zeus that is revealed in both the Oresteia trilogy and Prometheus Bound.24 In the Eumenides, the Furies repeatedly claim to be 23. The editors of Shelley's "To Night" in The Oxford Anthology of English Literature, vol. 2, accept Forman's reading of the text as containing both a female and a male figure of Day (Harry Buxton Forman, ed., The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe SheUey, vol. 4 [London: Reeves, 1877] 70-71). The Oxford Anthology note reads: "Day ... his This 'Day' is the Sun only, hence male, and not the mythic female 'Day' of stanza II" (473). 24. The problem of the image of Zeus as projected in Aeschylus' various plays has produced a seemingly never-ending stream of secondary literature. For a good survey of this discussion, see D. J. Conacher, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound: A Literary Commentary (Toronto: U of Toronto P, 1980) 120-37. But the reader of Shelley need concern himself only with Shelley's view of the matter. For a recent scholarly account that seems to tally entirely with Shelley's own view, see David Cohen, "The Theodicy of Aeschylus: Justice and Tyranny in the Oresteia," Greece and Rome 33.2 (1986): 129-41.</page><page sequence="17">TO NIGHT" AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 255 daughters of the ancient and awesome goddess of Night, and they contend against Apollo's and Athena's protection of Orestes because they see it as an infringement of their and their mother's ancient privileges. Apollo appears throughout this part of the trilogy as the spokesman of Zeus. Translated into modern idiom, the figure of Orestes can be seen as the battleground in a caretaker war between Zeus and Night in which Apollo and Artemis on one side and the Erinyes on the other fight Zeus' and Night's battles. To make Shelley's probable intention in "To Night" quite clear, one has to see the Apollo of the Eumenides as the spokesman of Zeus as the latter appears in Prometheus Bound. In that tragedy at least, Zeus is very clearly shown to be a detestable tyrant. He is depicted as a despotic ruler who knows neither justice nor compassion and rules with cunning and an iron hand. For Shelley, the ruler of the Olympian pantheon came to symbolize every form of oppression likely to hinder social and political reform and such progress toward the perfection of the individual as Shelley envisioned. This could explain why, in "To Night," the poet should scorn to seek inspiration from "Day," the spokesman of the very power whose influence Shelley thought he and his fellow poets were working to over come. A subsequently canceled phrase in the draft version of "To Night" strengthens the probability that behind the poetological foreground of this poem there lurks a hidden political dimension comparable to that in the "Ode to the West Wind." The phrase about the "Suns slaves" (Quinn 12 and 13, line 5), which at some stage was probably intended to be included in the last stanza of the poem, indicates that the opposition between "Day" and "Night" in Shelley's poem is not simply one between Brightness and Darkness but one between oppression (connected with the sun) and free dom (connected with Night)?an opposition that is not only fed by influences from Greek mythology and tragedy but may also have been strengthened by the habit, widespread among absolute monarchs of the eighteenth century, of employing painters to depict them on the walls and ceilings of their palaces as the sun god of traditional Greek mythology. Looking back to Hesiod's Theogony, we can now begin to understand how Shelley might have come to turn the somewhat gruesome figure of Night into the attractive person of his own poem. We can see that the revaluation of Night corresponds to a devaluation of Zeus. Hesiod's Zeus rules over the best of all worlds?not the best imaginable but the best of all those that, according to the Theogony, mythological history has seen so far. Hesiod celebrates Zeus as guaranteeing a world-order that is better and more just than that of any of his predecessors. In Hesiod's poem, Prometheus' revolt constitutes a threat that Zeus must needs avert. To</page><page sequence="18">256 KURT SCHLUETER modern readers, however, Zeus's methods appear nonetheless detestable. SheUey, in demoting the figure of Zeus and promoting the Titan Prometheus, shows the poet to be an opponent of a monarch who is unjust toward god and man. How could SheUey be expected to depict the poet as relying on poetic inspiration provided by Zeus's daughters, the Muses, or ApoUo, his son and spokesman? In aUying himself with Night, SheUey, foUowing Hesiod here, sides with a divinity altogether different from the genealogical branch of those powers that led to the rule of Zeus. SheUey's seeking of an aUiance with Night may even have been influenced by one brief passage in Homer from which it emerges that the ancient figure of Night stiU has power over gods and heroes alike and that even great Zeus stands in awe of her and curbs his wiU in order to avoid causing offence.25 If SheUey should have required further help in turning Hesiodian Night into a more positive figure, he might have received this from the rhapso dists. The th?ogonies of the rhapsodists do not whoUy taUy in the lists they give of successive generations of ruUng deities. But in aU of them Night occupies a highly venerable position at or near the very beginning of aU things. In the theogony traditionaUy ascribed to Eudemos, Night is clearly made first principle.26 In those Orphic th?ogonies that make Night daugh ter of Phanes, she assists the parent divinity in his creative work before becoming the sole ruler of the world. Besides creativity, she also possesses other powers that particularly qualify her as an inspirational force. She has the gift of prophecy, which she uses in speaking oracles from the cave in which she dweUs with Adrasteia, the goddess who makes laws for the gods. Succeeding rulers of the world come to Phanes' daughter to seek advice (Guthrie 102-4). No survey of possible sources of the character of Night in SheUey's poem could pretend to be exhaustive, but our Ust would be seriously deficient if we failed to mention the Orphic hymn "To Night," even if it should be considered unlikely that SheUey had any direct knowledge of it. This particular poem, which displays most of the features typical of the ancient 25. Night as a divinity appears only in the 14th chapter of the Iliad. Even here she is mentioned not by the narrator but by her son Sleep, who tells Hera how he once incurred the displeasure of Zeus, who in his anger would have severely punished him had not his mother Night saved him (Iliad 14.256-61). Guthrie finds remarkable resemblances between the position of Night as depicted here and that of Night in Orphic rhapsodies (Guthrie 102 f). 26. "Eudemos, the pupil of Aristotle, was acquainted with an Orphic poem which contained the statement that the beginning of all things was Night" (Linforth 154). For the position of Night in the Rhapsodic theogony, see also Guthrie 75 f, and 102-7, and Martin L. West, The Orphic Poems 234-37.</page><page sequence="19">TO NIGHT" AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 257 Greek prayer hymn, is part of a collection of hymns addressed to various members of the Greek pantheon (Guthrie 257-61). In the poem in ques tion, the speaker calls upon Night to relieve him of fear. He celebrates her as a benign mother who has brought forth gods and human beings alike. He bestows upon her the additional name of "Cypris" to extol her amatory attractiveness. He believes her to be invested with special powers to dispel sorrow and suffering. He proclaims that she rules everywhere and every thing, like Necessity herself. But in this poem there is no obvious connec tion between her and poetry, unless one finds poetry has a remarkably soothing and healing effect.27 We now have to sift through the textual evidence for suggestions that Shelley's figure of Night can properly be understood as being male. We begin with a reminder of an important difference between Greek and English grammar. As we have seen, Night in Greek mythology is predomi nantly feminine because of the grammatical gender of the Greek noun nyx. In English, where the old division of nouns into gender classes has been lost, the connection between the sexual identity of the personification and the gender of the noun from which the figure takes its name is weaker. Bloomfield points to this problem in his essay on the grammatical analysis of personification in English literature.28 The draft manuscript copy of "To Night" in the Bixby notebook (Huntingdon MS. HM 2176) allows a glimpse into the gradual evolution of the poem. A study of this draft shows that irl experimenting with the sexual identity of his personification of Night Shelley operated within the special linguistic situation described by Bloomfield. The manuscript indi cates that, during work on the poem, Shelley variously thought of "Night" as a female and as a male figure. As already mentioned, Shelley's original draft contains the honorific title "Mother of Dreams," which did not find its way into the later fair copy. Against this is to be set another canceled phrase, which documents that Shelley was able to think of "Night" as the father of " Sleep. " 29 Conclusions to be drawn from these textual observations might be formulated as follows. First, if Shelley began his poem with a fixed idea of 27- For a critical text of the Orphic hymn "To Night," see Guilelmus Quandt, ed., Orphei Hymni (Berolini: apud Weidmannos, 1955) 4. For an English translation of "To Night," see Apost?los N.

Bloomfield, "A Grammatical Approach to Personification Allegory," Modem Philology 60.3 (February 1963): 161-71, esp. 162. 29. The second half of line 10 on page 10 of the facsimile is nearly illegible. Quinn, on the page opposite the facsimile, transcribes this part of the line as "thus to me," but she also</page><page sequence="20">258 KURT SCHLUETER the sexual identity of "Night," he was prepared to change that identity. Second, the state of the text in the fair-copy notebook now held at Harvard University provides no written guarantee that SheUey himself would have published the poem without any further substantive alterations, though it may point in that direction. Third, all extant textual versions of the poem leave the sexual identity of "Night" as something that can be only inferred. Any such inferences wiU have to take into account the foUowing obser vations. In the fictional world of "To Night," there is rivalry between "beloved Night" and "unloved [Day]" for the attention of the speaker. For the association of "Day" with ApoUo to carry at aU, "Day" had not only to be associated with the "light r[iding] high . . . [at] noon" but clearly characterized as male. Better, then, to let his more happy rival, "Night," also appear as male. But when, earlier, in stanza 2, "Night" was prevented by "day" from fulfilUng the speaker's wish that "Night" join her as quickly as possible, the rivalry is between female "day" and the poetess for the attention of "Night."30 Polytheistic Greek mythology offers an easy way out of this quandary in that it provides a female personification of the early part of the day caUed Eos, who is present in the poem under the term "dawn" (15). Did SheUey think along these lines? The efforts of readers to make a text yield a clear and distinct meaning and the author's efforts to construct a lyrical text naturaUy differ considerably, but they should meet at some point. It is at least possible that the gradual evolution of the sexual identities of the poem's figures is ultimately bound up with the gradual evolution of the poem itself. Some doubt may remain as to whether this development has really reached a state of clarity and distinctiveness sufficient to inform every part of the poem. One thing, however, is clear. SheUey's hand in both notebooks offers no possible justification for some editors' reading "her" in the line "TiU the weary Day turned to his rest," which would make "Day" a female personification throughout the poem.31 Nor can SheUey's use of the mas provides a textual note on page 84 that reads: "Lines 9-10; PBS apparently wrote 'Whom Love to thy embraces bore', canceled the entire line and then wrote 'Murmured lowly thus to me', with 'to me' written on 'embraces'; ink blot on e of '[befe]'." This reading is the same as that proposed earlier by Harry Buxton Forman, ed., Note Books of Percy Bysshe Shelley: From the Originals in the Library of W. K. Bixby (1911; New York: Phaeton, 1968) 114-15, and Chernaik 244, who both managed to extract the same wording from the jumble of minim strokes and upperlengths in Shelley's holograph. 30. These significant changes in the pairings of rivals were pointed out to me by Mark Spurway. 31. William Michael Rossetti, ed., The Complete Poetical Works of P. B. Shelley (Moxon, 1870; London: Slark, 1881) 3: 89 and 408. Rossetti's conjecture appears to have been silendy adopted by Arthur Quiller-Couch in The Oxford Book of English Verse. Forman calls Rossetti's</page><page sequence="21">"TO NIGHT" AND CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 259 culine pronoun, "his," be explained away as a momentary slip of the pen, because the canceled fossilized reflexive "him" in the original phrasing of this line in the draft notebook shows the choice of the masculine gender to have been deliberate (see Quinn 8 and 9, line 7). The distinction between two figures called "day" and "Day," one Eos, the other Apollo, could be strengthened by the following argumentation. Present-day convention employs lower- and uppercase initial letters to distinguish clearly between nouns used to refer to periods of time and nouns used as personifications. A study of the two holographs of "To Night" reveals, first, that Shelley did not follow this convention and, second, that he nevertheless did not insert initial majuscules and minuscules haphazardly. Let us begin our examination of Shelley's handwriting with the earlier, draft version of the poem. In the phrase "eyes of day," "day" is clearly personified even without the use of capital "D." Quinn transcribes "day" in stanza 2 with a small "d." Her note explains this to mean that she finds a lowercase "d" correcting an earlier majuscule (Quinn 82, note to Une 16). The "Day" of stanza 3 is written with a firm capital "D." The later, fair-copy version shows a reversal of writing procedure in both instances.32 The phrase "eyes of day" in stanza 2 now shows an uncorrected minuscular "d," but the "Day" of stanza 3 now seems to show an earlier lowercase "d" turned into an uppercase letter. Do these corrections mean that Shelley wished to differentiate between two personifications called "day" and "Day" on the basis of sex and orthographic representation? This would be a very unusual stratagem, but all the other personifications in the poem are capitalized and can be thought of as male. That Shelley's figure of Night was influenced by Aeschylean tragedy and Hesiodian theogony is much more likely than its having been influenced by Orphic rhapsody and hymnody. But taken together these texts testify to the existence of an alternative mythological tradition much less well known (even to the average humanist) than the world of the Homeric pantheon. To an opponent of Zeus such as Shelley, this alternative tradition offered in the figure of Night a supreme ruling divinity no less exalted than Zeus but with more ancient credentials, a divine figure no less benign than she was awesome, and possessing both amatory attractiveness and a supreme wisdom that she was willing to dispense in her oracles. Night, moreover, conjecture "a very tempting emendation" but refrains from following Rossetti "in the absence of authority for the change" (Forman, ed., The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley 4: 70-71). 32.

Nor have the supreme powers of Night ever been so seriously threatened as those of Zeus. It seems at least possible that SheUey wished to pay homage to this alternative tradition in composing his poem "To Night," because revolutionaries frequendy replace estab Ushed conventions and symbols with more ancient images and concepts when attempting to project visions of a better future. In turning the primordial goddess of Night into a male figure, however, SheUey recreated the tradition to make it entirely his own. University of Freiburg, Germany</page></plain_text>
