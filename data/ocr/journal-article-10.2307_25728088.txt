The ways in which we read, understand, interpret, translate, debate and represent the Qur'anic text are now informed by a number of approaches, some of which have their origins in disci plines not conventionally associated with Arabist or Islamkunde fields of inquiry. Meanwhile, more established scholarly tradi tions continue to produce significant addi tions to our knowledge of the Qur'an and related cultural and scholarly production, in written, oral and graphical form. This confer ence seeks to provide a forum for investigat ing the basic question: how is the Qur'anic text to be read, translated and interpreted? These are some of the suggested areas: Writing and representing the text: from al Hajjaj ibn Yusuf to HTML Linguistic approaches to the Qur'an Current approaches to the teaching of the Qur'an and its study Qur'anic exegesis and textual analysis The Qur'an in popular culture and the mass media The Qur'an and literature Contemporary issues in Qur'an translation Frameworks for the study of recitation Needless to say, contributions on relevant topics other than those listed are also wel comed. Our objective is to stimulate discussion, debate and research on all aspects of the Qur'anic text and interpretation. If you would like information on the conference and the submission of abstracts, please contact the Centre.

Textual citations and references will be given as numbered endnotes. Authors are required to follow the system laid out below, with particular attention paid to italicisation and the usage of commas, colons and parentheses. First Reference PUBLISHED BOOK Author's name1, Book title: sub title2, editor/ compiler/translator/reviser3, series, number in series, edition4 (number of volumes, place of publication: publisher, date) volume number, page number.5 ARTICLE IN AN EDITED VOLUME Author's name, 'article title' in editor's name (ed.), book title, series name, number in series, edition (number of volumes, place of publication: publisher, date) volume number, page number. ARTICLE IN A JOURNAL Author's name, 'article title', name of jour nal, place of publication: volume number in arabic numerals: issue number (year), page number. Subsequent Reference Note: when references to the same work fol low without interruption, use ibid. Do not use op. cit. PUBLISHED BOOK Author's surname, short title, volume num ber, page number. ARTICLE IN AN EDITED VOLUME Author's surname, 'article title', page num ber. ARTICLE IN A JOURNAL Author's surname, shortened journal title, volume number (date), page number. 1 Initials or forenames first. Arabic names (especially from the classical period) as follows: Shuhra, Full name, e.g., Ibn Rahawayh, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Tamlml. 2 Titles within titles are contained within single quote marks. Arabic titles: only the first sub stantive noun and personal names are capitalised, e.g. Diwan DhJ 'l-Rumma, Kitdb al-maldhin. 3 If there is no author, then editor etc. precedes title. A full stop follows ed. and tr. 4 There is no full stop following edn 5 Where it is more appropriate to refer to bdb, kitdb, fasl, etc., this should be done with care taken that the system adopted is clear and consistent.</page><page sequence="10">110 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Quotation from the Qur'an As an exception to the practice of using endnotes for references, quotations from and references to the text of the Qur'an should be followed by the reference, in brackets, e.g. 'the form tarayinna occurs once (Q. 19:26).' Authors should indicate in an end note which edition of the text they are using, particularly in regard to published trans lations and versions of the Arabic text the surahs of which are numbered using a sys tem differing from the standard numbering. Transliteration and Arabic text Authors are expected to adhere to the convention of transliterating single words and phrases, and short sentences, in italic roman script as per the JQS transliteration scheme. Authors are responsible for the accuracy and consistency of their translitera tion. Arabic, Persian, Ottoman etc. words found in a standard unabridged English dictionary are not to be transliterated or italicised, but treated as English words. Longer passages of Arabic, of approximately forty words or more, may appear in Arabic script, which should be set apart from the main text by one double-spaced line above and below, and should be block indented. Dates and numbers One to ninety-nine spelled out, 100 or more in figures. Dates: 6 September 1998, 9 Jumada II 565. If dual dating is employed, then it is to be employed consistently in each paper.

Readers should come away with a satisfying depth of understanding of the full range of medieval Islamic political thought/ Professor Michael Cook, Princeton University A broad survey of Islamic political thought in the six centuries from the rise of Islam to the Mongol invasions. Based on a wide variety of sources, some of a type not previously considered in works on political thought, it seeks to bring out the enormous scope and high level of historical (and, in some cases, contemporary) interest of medieval Muslim thinking on this subject. The author aims to make Islamic political thought easier for modern readers to understand by relating it to the contexts in which it was formulated, analysing it in terms familiar to the reader, and, where possible, comparing it with medieval European and modern thought. Guiding the reader through this complex history on a tour of one of the great civilizations of the pre-modern world, the book brings out the fascinating nature of medieval Islamic political thought, both in its own right and as the background to political thinking in the Muslim world today.
