Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2001. Pp. xi, 343; black-and-white frontispiece. $45. Lawrence M. Clopper's Drama, Play, and Game: English Festive Culture in the Medieval and Early Modern Period functions in many ways as a summa of a career's work on medieval drama. Synthesizing the arguments of such pieces as "Lay and Clerical Impact on Civic Religious Drama and Ceremony" (1989) and "Miracula and The Tretise of Mir aclis Pleyinge" (1990), as well as Clopper's meticulous earlier work with the Chester rec ords for the Records of Early English Drama (1979) and Modern Philology (1978), it turns on the premise first advanced in the 1990 article that apparent criticisms of or pro hibitions against the drama in the Tretise and elsewhere were directed, not at liturgical or vernacular religious drama, but instead at a (largely lost) genre of raucous parody that jested broadly with sacred subjects. It is this "festive" and parodie aspect of medieval and early-modern English culture?manifested in church ales, somergames, and other sorts of ludi inhonesti?and its relationship to the more "serious" enterprises of liturgical and, particularly, vernacular drama that Clopper explores in this book. What with all the local and specific studies coming out on medieval English drama these days, it is good to see a book that returns to a larger theoretical perspective and looks at the big picture again, albeit in a sometimes summary fashion. One thinks of books like V. A. Kolve's Play Called Corpus Christi (1966) and Rosemary Woolf 's English Mystery Plays (1972) or perhaps, more recently (1987), Four Middle English Mystery Cycles by Martin Stevens (to whom this book is dedicated) from the days before medieval drama scholarship fractured off into increasingly specific records-based regional and local studies?only this book is even broader in its discussion, and informed by a command of the range of English medieval drama as reflected in those very records, as well as the extant texts. It surveys medieval drama broadly around a few theoretical principles and an impressive philological analysis of key terms such as theatrum, ludi, and miracula, ranging from early-medieval reflections on classical drama and games to the persistence of drama in the Tudor and Elizabethan periods. Essentially, Clopper argues, from his interpretation of the fifteenth century Tretise of Mir aclis Pleyinge (supplemented by readings of other texts), that the medieval and early modern period lacked a genuine antitheatrical discourse (like that of later Puritan attacks); instead, apparent prohibitions and criticisms were directed only at irreverent, ribald games and other activities that jested broadly with sacred subjects. The vernacular drama, then, far from being implicated in these criticisms, turns out to be a publicly sponsored response to these raucous parodies, rechanneling their festive energies into appropriate activities that could be effectively controlled. In fact, Clopper argues, lay interest in dispensing moral and religious instruction to citizens, as well as exhibiting power and wealth, lay behind the mounting of vernacular drama, including the northern biblical cycles as well as the East Anglian plays; and because no true antitheatrical tradition against such drama existed, the "persistence" of such drama into the 1560s and beyond, into the early Reformation, can be accounted for. Among its many points of interest, Clopper's argument is useful in returning us to a careful reading of the Tretise of Mir aclis Pleyinge, our most sustained document on the contemporary reception of medieval drama. Indeed, his analysis of the Tretise, presented primarily in chapter 2, can be taken as emblematic of the argument of the book as well as of some of its problems. Generally, the Tretise has been held to be the work of a fifteenth century Wycliffite writer opposed to drama, art, and adornment in general (it appears in a manuscript, British Library Additional 24202, that also contains a treatise against images with a similar iconoclastic orientation). Therefore scholars have found the Tretise illumi nating because of its apparent reasoned opposition to the "quike bokis" (ed. Clifford Da</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 485 vidson, lines 448-49) of drama?including cycle and other vernacular drama. The culprit, however, according to Clopper, is not drama in general but certain "raucous parodies" or ludi th??trales?historically designated as miracles?"mockeries, a kind of inappropriate gaming that leads to lechery, gluttony, and pride" (p. 84). As such, he virtually eliminates the presumed antitheatrical argument of the Tretise, turning it from a Wycliffite iconoclastic argument to a mainstream document, apparently directed toward priests, warning them to stay away from inappropriate ludi. The problem with this argument is the void at its center?these "raucous" parodies and other activities (an interesting choice of words, since raucous does not enter the English language until after 1750, in reference to the sound of a toad) to which Clopper returns often in his analysis (e.g., pp. 44, 48, 60-61, 74, 128) can never be identified in the sur viving texts of the liturgical and vernacular drama, though Clopper finds ample evidence of them in the dramatic records, with which he has worked closely, and in texts such as Dives and Pauper. Surely Clopper is correct to assume that the terms pleye and ludus had different, broader applications in the Middle Ages?that both were a subset of the word game. Yet just as it seems unwise to unduly restrict the argument of the Tretise to vernacular, religious drama, it seems equally unwise to rule out such drama as included in the argument. After all, the N-town play, which Clopper includes as a part of the broader tradition of vernacular drama, states in its "Proclamation" that one who goes to the play will see "this game wel pleyd in good a-ray" (ed. K. S. Block, p. 16, line 519). Certain of the six major arguments that the Tretise's author attributes to his opponents (and refutes) simply do not make sense in terms of Clopper's interpretation. For example, the author speaks more than once of the viewers "wepinge bitere teris" (e.g., lines 193-94; though he does not see these tears as "werrey wepinge and medeful" [line 357] since they are inappropriately directed toward a performance rather than true penitence)?hardly the sort of reaction one would expect to ribald, parodie games. Further, the author's parallel to the plastic arts, allowing a qualified acceptance of painted images as "bokis to lewid men," does not make sense if miracles are not also construed as serious efforts at instruction. Indeed, the Tretise contains within itself a refutation of Clopper's argument: the Wycliffite author makes a distinction between the playing of miracles and the playing of other "japes" or "rebaudye" of the broadly parodie, jesting kind, seemingly eliminating the conclusion that miracles themselves are exclusively "rebaudye." The author says that those who sup port miracles claim that it is better for people to have their recreation "by pleyinge of miracles than by pleyinge of other japes" (lines 209-10). And in his response, the author holds to this distinction: rather than arguing that miracles are themselves raucous japes, as we might expect from Clopper's argument, he argues instead that because people give credence to what they see in miracles, "lasse y vele it were to pleyin rebaudye than to pleyin siehe miriclis" (lines 428-30). The objection seems to be, not that miracles are broadly parodie or derisive, but that, in seeming to be true, they contain "mengid leesingis" and "mengid trewthis" (lines 426-27); in fact, the author implies, open ribaldry is better! Clopper's subsequent chapters propose and discuss a hierarchy of medieval ludic prac tice, varying according to the participants' lay or clerical status and location, ranging from aristocratic monastic and cathedral entertainments to parish ales. Much learned commen tary on vernacular play texts and manuscripts is included, along with some original and surprising readings?for example, provocative speculations on allegory and "realism" cou pled with the observation that Faustus's apparent expanded individuality beyond morality play characters may be only apparent, in part the result of "setting the action in some indeterminable but 'modern' existential space and time" (p. 248). Clopper prefers to treat the moral dramas of East Anglia as of a piece with the biblical drama of the north since, taken together, they constitute the vernacular drama obliquely created as a result of the suppression by the clergy of inappropriate festive activity.</page><page sequence="3">486 Reviews Of particular interest, in light, for example, of the late copying of the Chester manuscripts and the recent revelation (at a 2002 Kalamazoo talk by Alexandra Johnston) of the Tudor rose on the Towneley manuscript, are Clopper's reflections on the "persistence" of medieval drama, found primarily in chapter 8 but implicit elsewhere in the book as well. In this discussion, Clopper's thesis, essentially that the drama persisted because the Middle Ages lacked a true antitheatrical tradition, perhaps obscures the variety and complexity of the drama's responses to the shifting ideological winds of the mid-sixteenth century, particu larly those associated with the developing Reformation. It is not enough simply to note and record the drama's persistence into and past the 1560s: one wants an account of the variety of strategies by which the drama responded to, was appropriated by, and accom modated the advancing Reformation. For instance, the 1560 New Romney "stage play" at the feast of Pentecost with the "curious omission" of Christ in the cast list sounds suspiciously like a post-Reformation nod to the prohibition against anthropomorphic rep resentations of the Godhead, especially since it was staged in conjunction with the central holiday of the Reformation calendar (p. 117). Chapter 6 speaks of the absence of "the clerical agenda" in many vernacular plays as though that agenda were itself static through out the period (and what kind of clerics are we talking about anyway?). Clopper includes a brilliant analysis of the deliberate incorporation in the Chester Abraham of the "Angli can" [sic] practice of Communion in two elements but fails to consider potential implica tions for the rest of the cycle (p. 184). One wants a more systematic social and political analysis of such issues. But these are only a few of the questions that Clopper's expansive book raises. Drama, Play, and Game, broad-ranging in its speculation, sure to provoke discussion and contro versy, is a welcome addition to the corpus of scholarship on medieval and early-modern drama.
