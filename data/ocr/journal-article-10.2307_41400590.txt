<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scott Russell Sanders T*he Common Life ONE college afternoon for spring last year, vacation, while she my invited daughter two neighbor Eva was girls home to from help college for spring vacation, she invited two neighbor girls to help her make bread. The girls are sisters, five-year-old Alexandra and ten- year-old Rachel, both gorgeous, with eager dark eyes and shining faces. They live just down the street from us here in Bloomington, Indiana, and whenever they see me pass by, on bicycle or on foot, they ask about Eva, whom they adore. I was in the yard that afternoon mulching flower beds with compost, and I could hear the girls chattering as Eva led them up the sidewalk to our door. I had plenty of other chores to do in the yard, where every living thing was urgent with April. But how could I stay outside, when so much beauty and laughter and spunk were gathered in the kitchen? I kept looking in on the cooks, until Eva finally asked, "Daddy, you wouldn't like to knead some dough, would you?" "I'd love it," I said. "You sure there's room for me?" "There's room," Eva replied, "but you'll have to wash in the base- ment." Hands washed, I took my place at the counter beside Rachel and Alexandra, who perched on a stool I had made for Eva when she was a toddler. Eva had still needed that stool when she learned to make bread on this counter; and my son, now six feet tall, had balanced there as well for his own first lessons in cooking. I never needed the stool, but I needed the same teacher- my wife Ruth, a woman with eloquent fingers. Our kitchen is small; Ruth and I share that cramped space by moving in a kind of dance we have been practicing for years. When we bump one another, it is usually for the pleasure of bumping. But Eva and the girls and I jostled like birds too numerous for a nest. We spattered flour everywhere. We told stories. We joked. All the while I bobbed on a [7]</page><page sequence="2">8 THE GEORGIA REVIEW current of bliss, delighting in the feel of live dough beneath my fingers, the smell of yeast, the piping of child-voices so much like the birdsong cascading through our open windows, the prospect of whole- wheat loaves hot from the oven. An artist might paint this kitchen scene in pastels for a poster, with a tender motto below, as evidence that all is right with the world. All is manifestly not right with the world. The world, most of us would agree, is a mess: rife with murder and mayhem, abuse of land, extinction of species, lying and theft and greed. There are days when I can see nothing but a spectacle of cruelty and waste, and the weight of dismay pins me to my chair. On such days I need a boost merely to get up, uncurl my fists, and go about my work. The needed strength may come from family, from neighbors, from a friend's greeting in the mail, from the forked leaves of larkspur breaking ground, from rainstorms and music and wind, from the lines of a handmade table or the lines in a well-worn book, from the taste of an apple or the brash trill of finches in our backyard trees. Strength also comes to me from memories of times when I have felt a deep and complex joy, a sense of being exactly where I should be and doing exactly what I should do, as I felt on that breadmaking afternoon. I wish to reflect on the sources of that joy, that sense of being utterly in place, because I suspect they are the sources of all that I find authentic in my life. So much in life seems to me unauthentic, I cannot afford to let the genuine passages slip by without considering what makes them ring true. It is as though I spend my days wandering about, chasing false scents, lost, and then occasionally, for a few ticks of the heart, I stumble onto the path. While making bread with my daughter and her two young friends, I was on the path. So I recall that time now as a way of keeping company with Eva, who has gone back to college, but also as a way of discovering in our common life a reservoir of power and hope. # What is so powerful, so encouraging, in that kitchen scene? To begin with, I love my three fellow cooks; I relish every tilt of their heads and turn of their voices. In their presence I feel more alive and alert, as if the rust had been knocked off my nerves. The armor of self dissolves, ego relaxes its grip, and I am simply there, on the breeze of the moment. Rachel and Alexandra belong to the Abed family, with whom we often share food and talk and festivities. We turn to the Abeds for advice, for starts of plants, for cheer, and they likewise turn to us. Not long ago</page><page sequence="3">SCOTT RUSSELL SANDERS 9 they received troubling news that may force them to move away, and we have been sharing in their distress. So the Abed girls brought into our kitchen a history of neighborliness, a history all the more valuable because it might soon come to an end. The girls also brought a readiness to learn what Eva had to teach. Eva, as I mentioned, had learned from Ruth how to make bread, and Ruth had learned from a Canadian friend, and our friend had learned from her grandmother. As Rachel and Alexandra shoved their hands into the dough, I could imagine the rope of knowledge stretching back and back through generations, to folks who ground their grain with stones and did their baking in wood stoves or fireplaces or in pits of glowing coals. If you have made yeast bread, you know how at first the dough clings to your fingers, and then gradually, as you knead in more flour, it begins to pull away and take on a life of its own, becoming at last as resilient as a plump belly. If you have not made yeast bread, no amount of hearing or reading about it will give you that knowledge, because you have to learn through your body, through fingers and wrists and aching forearms, through shoulders and back. Much of what we know comes to us that way, passed on from person to person, age after age, surviving in muscle and bone. I learned from my mother how to transplant a seedling, how to sew on a button; I learned from my father how to saw a board square, how to curry a horse, how to change the oil in a car. The pleasure I take in sawing or currying, in planting or sewing, even in changing oil, like my pleasure in making bread, is bound up with the affection I feel for my teachers and the respect I feel for the long, slow accumulation of knowledge that informs our simplest acts. Those simple acts come down to us because they serve real needs. You plant a tree or sweep a floor or rock a baby without asking the point of your labors. You patch the roof to stop a leak, patch a sweater to keep from having to throw it out. You pluck the banjo because it tickles your ears and rouses Grandpa to dance. None of us can live entirely by such meaningful acts; our jobs, if nothing else, often push us through empty motions. But unless at least some of what we do has a transparent purpose, answering not merely to duty or fashion but to actual needs, then the heart has gone out of our work. What art could be more plainly valuable than cooking? The reason for baking bread is as palpable as your tongue. After our loaves were finished, Eva and I delivered two of them to the Abeds, who showed in their faces a perfect understanding of the good of bread.</page><page sequence="4">IO THE GEORGIA REVIEW When I compare the dough to a plump belly, I hear the sexual over- tones, of course. By making the comparison, I do not wish to say, with Papa Freud, that every sensual act is a surrogate for sex; on the contrary, I believe sex comes closer to being a stand-in, rather brazen and obvious, like a ham actor pretending to be the whole show, when it is only one player in the drama of our sensual life. That life flows through us con- stantly, so long as we do not shut ourselves off. The sound of birds and the smell of April dirt and the brush of wind through the open door were all ingredients in the bread we baked. Before baking, the yeast was alive, dozing in the refrigerator. Scooped out of its jar, stirred into warm water, fed on sugar, it soon bubbled out gas to leaven the loaves. You have to make sure the water for the yeast, like milk for a baby, is neither too hot nor too cold, and so, as for a baby's bottle, I test the temperature on my wrist. The flour, too, had been alive not long before as wheat thriving in sun and rain. Our nourishment is borrowed life. You need not be a Christian to feel, in a bite of bread, a sense of communion with the energy that courses through all things. The lump in your mouth is a chunk of earth; there is nothing else to eat. In our house we say grace before meals, to remind ourselves of that gift and that dependence. The elements of my kitchen scene- loving company, neighborliness, inherited knowledge and good work, shared purpose, sensual delight, and union with the creation- sum up for me what is vital in community. Here is the spring of hope I have been led to by my trail of bread. In our com- mon life we may find the strength not merely to carry on in face of the world's bad news, but to resist cruelty and waste. I speak of it as common because it is ordinary, because we make it together, because it binds us through time to the rest of humanity and through our bodies to the rest of nature. By honoring this common life, nurturing it, carrying it steadily in mind, we might renew our households and neighborhoods and cities, and in doing so might redeem ourselves from the bleakness of private lives spent in frenzied pursuit of sensation and wealth. # Ever since the eclipse of our native cultures, the dominant American view has been more nearly the opposite: that we should cultivate the self rather than the community; that we should look to the individual as the source of hope and the center of value, while expecting hindrance and harm from society.</page><page sequence="5">SCOTT RUSSELL SANDERS II What other view could have emerged from our history? The first Europeans to reach America were daredevils and treasure seekers, as were most of those who mapped the interior. Many colonists were ren- egades of one stripe or another, some of them religious nonconformists, some political rebels, more than a few of them fugitives from the law. The trappers, hunters, traders, and freebooters who pushed the frontier westward seldom recognized any authority beyond the reach of their own hands. Coast to coast, our land has been settled and our cities have been filled by generations of immigrants more intent on leaving behind old tyrannies than on seeking new social bonds. Our government was forged in rebellion against alien control. Our economy was founded on the sanctity of private property, and thus our corporations have taken on a sacred immunity through being defined under the law as persons. Our criminal justice system is so careful to pro- tect the rights of individuals that it may require years to convict a bank robber who killed a bystander in front of a crowd, or a bank official who left a trail of embezzlement as wide as the Mississippl. Our religion has been marked by an evangelical Protestantism that emphasizes personal salvation rather than social redemption. To "Get Right with God," as signs along the roads here in the Midwest gravely recommend, does not mean to reconcile your fellow citizens to the divine order, but to make a separate peace, to look after the eternal future of your own singular soul. True, we have a remarkable history of communal experiments, most of them religiously inspired- from Plymouth Colony, through the Shaker villages, Robert Owen's New Harmony, the settle- ments at Oneida, Amana, and countless other places, to the communes in our own day. But these are generally known to us, if they are known at all, as Utopian failures. For much of the present century, Americans have been fighting various forms of collectivism- senile empires during World War I, then Nazism, communism, and now fundamentalist theocracies- and these wars, the shouting kind as well as the shooting kind, have only strength- ened our commitment to individualism. We have understood freedom for the most part negatively rather than positively, as release from con- straints rather than as the condition for making a decent life in common. Hands off, we say; give me elbow room; good fences make good neigh- bors; my home is my castle; don't tread on me. I'm looking out for number one, we say; I'm doing my own thing. We have a Bill of Rights, which protects each of us from a bullying society, but no Bill of Responsibilities,</page><page sequence="6">12 THE GEORGIA REVIEW which would oblige us to answer the needs of others. Even where America's founding documents clearly address the pub- lic good, they have often been turned to private ends. Consider just one notorious example, the Second Amendment to the Constitution: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. It would be difficult to say more plainly that arms are to be kept for the sake of a militia, and a militia is to be kept for defense of the country. In our day, a reasonable person might judge that the Pentagon deploys quite enough weapons, without requiring any supplement from household arse- nals. Yet this lucid passage has been construed to justify a domestic arms race, until we now have in America more gun shops than gas stations, we have nearly as many handguns as hands, and we have concentrated enough firepower in the average city to carry on a war- which is roughly what, in some cities, is going on. Thus, by reading the Second Amendment through the lens of our obsessive individualism, we have turned a pro- vision for public safety into a guarantee of public danger. Observe how zealously we have carved up our cities and paved our land and polluted our air and burned up most of the earth's petroleum within a single generation- all for the sake of the automobile, a symbol of personal autonomy even more potent than the gun. There is a con- temptuous ring to the word "mass" in mass transportation, as if the only alternative to private cars were cattle cars. Motorcycles and snowmobiles and three-wheelers fill our public lands with the din of engines and tear up the terrain, yet any effort to restrict their use is denounced as an in- fringement of individual rights. Millions of motorists exercise those rights by hurling the husks of their pleasures onto the roadside, boxes and bottles and bags. Ravines and ditches in my part of the country are crammed with rusty cars and refrigerators, burst couches and stricken tvs, which their former owners would not bother to haul to the dump. Meanwhile, advertisers sell us everything from jeeps to jeans as tokens of freedom, and we are so infatuated with the sovereign self that we fall for it, as if by purchasing one of a million identical products we could distinguish our- selves from the herd. The cult of the individual shows up everywhere in American lore, which celebrates drifters, rebels, and loners, while pitying or reviling the pillars of the community. The backwoods explorer like Daniel Boone,</page><page sequence="7">SCOTT RUSSELL SANDERS 13 the riverboat rowdy like Mike Fink, the lumberjack, the prospector, the rambler and gambler, the daring crook like Jesse James or the resourceful killer like Billy the Kid, along with countless lonesome cowboys, all wan- der, unattached, through the great spaces of our imagination. When society begins to close in, making demands and asking questions, our heroes hit the road. Like Huckleberry Finn, they are forever lighting out for the Territory, where nobody will tell them what to do. Huck Finn ran away from what he called civilization in order to leave behind the wickedness of slavery, and who can blame him, but he was also run- ning away from church and school and neighbors, from aunts who made him wash before meals, from girls who cramped his style, from chores, from gossip, from the whole nuisance of living alongside other people. In our literature, when community enters at all, it is likely to appear as a conspiracy against the free soul of a hero or heroine. Recall how rest- less Natty Bumppo becomes whenever Cooper drags him in from the woods to a settlement. Remember how strenuously Emerson preached against conforming to society and in favor of self-reliance, how earnestly Hawthorne warned us about the tyranny of those Puritan villages. Think of Thoreau running errands in Concord, rushing in the front door of a house and out the back, then home to his cabin in the woods, never paus- ing, lest he be caught in the snares of the town. Think of the revulsion Edna Pontellier feels towards the Creole society of New Orleans in Kate Chopin's The Awakening. Think of Willa Cather's or Toni Morrison's or James Baldwin's high-spirited women and men who can only thrive by fleeing their home communities. Think of Spoon River, Winesburg, Gopher Prairie, Zenith, all those oppressive fictional places, the backward hamlets and stifling suburbs and heartless cities that are fit only for drones and drudges and mindless Babbitts. In The Invasion of the Body Snatchers , a film from my childhood that still disturbs my dreams, an alien life form takes over one person after another in a small town, merging them into a single creature with a single will, until just one freethinking individual remains, and even he is clearly doomed. Along with dozens of other invasion tales, the film was a warning against communism, I suppose, but it was also a caution against the perils of belonging, of losing your one sweet self in the group, and thus it projected a fear as old as America. Of course you can find American books and films that speak as pas- sionately for the virtues of our life together as for the virtues of our lives apart. To mention only a few recent novels, I think of Gloria Naylor's</page><page sequence="8">14 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Mama Day , Wendell Berry's A Place on Earth, Ursula Le Guin's Always Coming Home , and Ernest Gaines's A Gathering of Old Men. But they represent a minority opinion. The majority opinion fills bestseller lists and cinema screens and billboards with isolated, alienated, rebellious fig- ures who are too potent or sensitive for membership in any group. # I have been shaped by this history, and I, too, am uneasy about groups, especially large ones, above all those that are glued together by hatred, those that use a color of skin or a cut of clothes for admission tickets, and those that wrap themselves in scriptures or flags. I have felt a chill from blundering into company where I was not wanted. I have known women and men who were scorned because they refused to fit the molds their neighbors had prepared for them. I have seen Klansmen parading in white hoods, their crosses burning on front lawns. I have seen a gang work its way through a subway car, picking on the old, the young, the weak. Through film I have watched the Nürnberg rallies, missiles parading in Red Square, policemen bashing demonstrators in Chicago, tanks crushing dissidents in Tiananmen Square. Like everyone born since World War II, I have grown up on television images of atrocities carried out, at home and abroad, with the blessing of governments or revolutionary armies or charismatic thugs. In valuing community, therefore, I do not mean to approve of any and every association of people. Humans are drawn together by a variety of motives, some of them worthy, some of them ugly. Anyone who has spent recess on a school playground knows the terror of mob rule. Any- one who has lived through a war knows that mobs may pretend to speak for an entire nation. I recently saw, for the first time in a long while, a bumper sticker that recalled for me the angriest days of the Vietnam War: AMERICA- LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT. What loving America seemed to mean, for those who brandished that slogan back around 1 970, was the approval of everything the government said or the army did in our name. "All those who seek to destroy the liberty of a democratic nation ought to know," Alexis de Tocqueville observed in Democracy in America , "that war is the surest and the shortest means to accomplish it." As a con- scientious objector, with a sister who studied near my home in Ohio on a campus where National Guardsmen killed several protesters, I felt the force of despotism in that slogan.</page><page sequence="9">SCOTT RUSSELL SANDERS 15 Rather than give in to despotism, some of my friends went to jail and others into exile. My wife and I considered staying in England, where we had been studying for several years and where I had been offered a job. But instead we chose to come home, here to the Midwest where we had grown up, to work for change. In our idealism, we might have rephrased that bumper sticker to read: AMERICA-LOVE IT AND REDEEM IT. For us, loving America had little to do with politicians and even less with soldiers, but very much to do with what I have been calling the common life: useful work, ordinary sights, family, neighbors, ancestors, our fellow creatures, and the rivers and woods and fields that are our mutual home. During the more than twenty years since returning to America, I have had some of the idealism knocked out of me, but I still believe that loving your country or city or neighborhood may require you to resist, to call for change, to speak on behalf of what you believe in, especially if what you believe in has been neglected. What we have too often neglected, in our revulsion against tyranny and our worship of the individual, is the common good. The results of that neglect are visible in the decay of our cities, the despoiling of our land, the fouling of our rivers and air, the haphazard commercial sprawl along our highways, the gluttonous feeding at the public trough, the mortgaging of our children's and grandchildren's future through our re- fusal to pay for current consumption. Only a people addicted to private pleasure would allow themselves to be defined as consumers- rather than conservers or restorers- of the earth's abundance. In spite of the comforting assurances, from Adam Smith onwards, that the unfettered pursuit of private wealth should result in unlimited public good, we all know that to be mostly a lie. If we needed reminders of how great that lie is, we could look at the savings and loan industry, where billions of dollars were stolen from small investors by rich managers who yearned to be richer; we could look at the Pentagon, where contracts are routinely encrusted with graft, or at Wall Street, where millionaires finagle to become billionaires through insider trading; we could look at our national forests, where logging companies buy timber for less than the cost to taxpayers of harvesting it; or we could look at our suburbs, where palaces multiply, while downtown more and more people are sleeping in cardboard boxes. Wealth does not precipitate like dew from the air; it comes out of the earth and from the labor of many hands.</page><page sequence="10">l6 THE GEORGIA REVIEW When a few hands hold onto great wealth, using it only for personal ease and display, that is a betrayal of the common life, the sole source of riches. * Fortunately, while our tradition is heavily tilted in favor of private life, we also inherit a tradition of caring for the community. Although Tocque- ville found much to fear and quite a bit to despise in this raw democracy, he praised Americans for having "carried to the highest perfection the art of pursuing in common the object of their common desires." Writing of what he had seen in the 1830's, Tocqueville judged Americans to be avaricious, self-serving, and aggressive; but he was also amazed by our eagerness to form clubs, to raise barns or town halls, to join together in one cause or another: "In no country in the world, do the citizens make such exertions for the common weal. I know of no people who have es- tablished schools so numerous and efficacious, places of public worship better suited to the wants of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair." Today we might revise his estimate of our schools or roads, but we can still see all around us the fruits of that concern for the common weal -the libraries, museums, courthouses, hospitals, orphanages, universities, parks, on and on. Born as most of us are into places where such amenities already exist, we may take them for granted; but they would not be there for us to use had our forebears not cooperated in building them. No matter where we live, our home places have also benefited from the Granges and unions, the volunteer fire brigades, the art guilds and garden clubs, the charities, food kitchens, homeless shelters, soccer and baseball teams, the Scouts and 4-H, the Girls and Boys Clubs, the Lions and Elks and Rotarians, the countless gatherings of people who saw a need and responded to it. This history of local care hardly ever makes it into our literature, for it is less glamorous than rebellion, yet it is a crucial part of our heritage. Any of us could cite examples of people who dug in and joined with others to make our home places better places. Women and men who invest themselves in their communities, fighting for good schools or green spaces, paying attention to where they are, seem to me as worthy of celebra- tion as those adventurous loners who keep drifting on, prospecting for pleasure. A few days after our breadmaking, Eva and I went to a concert in Bloomington's newly opened arts center. The old limestone building had once been the town hall, then a fire station and jail, then for several years</page><page sequence="11">SCOTT RUSSELL SANDERS 17 an abandoned shell. Volunteers bought the building from the city for a dollar and renovated it with materials, labor, and money donated by local people. Now we have a handsome facility that is in constant use for pottery classes, theater productions, puppet shows, art exhibits, poetry readings, and every manner of musical event. The music Eva and I heard was Hymnody of Earth, for hammer dulcimer, percussion, and children's choir. Composed by our next-door neighbor, Malcolm Dalglish, and featuring lyrics by our Ohio Valley neighbor, Wendell Berry, it was performed that night by Malcolm, per- cussionist Glen Velez, and the Bloomington Youth Chorus. As I sat there with Eva in a sellout crowd- about a third of whom I knew by name, another third by face- I listened to music that had been elaborated within earshot of my house, and I heard my friend play his instrument, and I watched those children's faces shining with the colors of the human spectrum, and I felt the restored building clasping us all like the cupped hands of our community. I knew once more that I was in the right place, a place created and filled and inspired by our lives together. * A woman who recently moved from Los Angeles to Bloomington told me that she would not be able to stay here long, because she was already beginning to recognize people in the grocery stores, on the sidewalks, in the library. Being surrounded by familiar faces made her nervous, after years in a city where she could range about anonymously. Every traveler knows the sense of liberation that comes from journeying to a place where nobody expects anything of you. Everyone who has gone to col- lege knows the exhilaration of slipping away from the watchful eyes of Mom and Dad. We all need seasons of withdrawal from responsibility. But if we make a career of being unaccountable, we have lost something essential to our humanity, and we may well become a burden or a threat to those around us. A community can support a number of people who are just passing through, or who care about no one's needs but their own; the greater the proportion of such people, however, the more vulnerable the community, until eventually it breaks down. And that is true on any scale, from a household to a planet. The words community , communion , and communicate all derive from common , and the two syllables of common grow from separate roots, the first meaning "together" or "next to," the second having to do with barter or exchange. Embodied in that word is a sense of our shared</page><page sequence="12">l8 THE GEORGIA REVIEW life as one of giving and receiving- music, touch, ideas, recipes, stories, medicine, tools, the whole range of artifacts and talents. After twenty- five years with Ruth, that is how I have come to understand marriage, as a constant exchange of labor and love. We do not calculate who gives how much; if we had to, the marriage would be in trouble. Looking out- ward from this community of two, I see my life embedded in ever larger exchanges- those of family and friendship, neighborhood and city, coun- tryside and country- and on every scale there is giving and receiving, calling and answering. Many people shy away from community out of a fear that it may become suffocating, confining, even vicious; and of course it may, if it grows rigid or exclusive. A healthy community is dynamic, stirred up by the energies of those who already belong, open to new members and fresh influences, kept in motion by the constant bartering of gifts. It is fashionable just now to speak of this open quality as "tolerance," but that word sounds too grudging to me- as though, to avoid strife, we must grit our teeth and ignore whatever is strange to us. The community I desire is not grudging; it is exuberant, joyful, grounded in affection, pleasure, and mutual aid. Such a community arises not from duty or money but from the free interchange of people who share a place, share work and food, sorrows and hope. Taking part in the common life means dwelling in a web of relationships, the many threads tugging at you while also holding you upright. I have told elsewhere the story of a man who lived in the Ohio township where I grew up, a builder who refused to join the volunteer fire department. Why should he join, when his house was brick, properly wired, fitted out with new appliances? Well, one day that house caught fire. The wife dialed the emergency number, the siren wailed, and pretty soon the volunteer firemen, my father among them, showed up with the pumper truck. But they held back on the hoses, asking the builder if he still saw no reason to join, and the builder said he could see a pretty good reason to join right there and then, and the volunteers let the water loose. I have also told before the story of a family from that township whose house burned down. The fire had been started accidentally by the father, who came home drunk and fell asleep smoking on the couch. While the place was still ablaze, the man took off, abandoning his wife and several young children. The local people sheltered the family, then built them a new house. This was a poor township. But nobody thought to call in</page><page sequence="13">SCOTT RUSSELL SANDERS 19 the government or apply to a foundation. These were neighbors in a fix, and so you helped them, just as you would harvest corn for an ailing farmer or pull a flailing child from the creek or put your arm around a weeping friend. I am not harking back to some idyllic past, like the one embalmed in the Saturday Evening Post covers by Norman Rockwell or the prints of Currier and Ives. The past was never golden. As a people, we still need to unlearn some of the bad habits formed during the long period of settle- ment. One good habit we might reclaim, however, is that of looking after those who live nearby. For much of our history, neighbors have kept one another going, kept one another sane. Still today, in town and coun- try, in apartment buildings and barrios, even in suburban estates, you are certain to lead a narrower life without the steady presence of neigh- bors. It is neither quaint nor sentimental to advocate neighborliness; it is far more sentimental to suggest that we can do without such mutual aid. Even Emerson, preaching self-reliance, knew the necessity of neigh- bors. He lived in a village, gave and received help, and delivered his essays as lectures for fellow citizens whom he hoped to sway. He could have left his ideas in his journals, where they first took shape, but he knew those ideas would only have effect when they were shared. I like to think he would have agreed with the Lakota shaman Black Elk, who said, "a man who has a vision is not able to use the power of it until after he has performed the vision on earth for the people to see." If you visit Emerson's house in Concord, you will find leather buckets hanging near the door, for he belonged to the village fire brigade, and even in the seclusion of his study, in the depths of thought, he kept his ears open for the alarm bell. We should not have to wait until our houses are burning before we see the wisdom of facing our local needs by joining in common work. We should not have to wait until gunfire breaks out in our schools, rashes break out on our skin, dead fish float in our streams, or beggars sleep on our streets before we act on behalf of the community. On a crowded planet, we had better learn how to live well together, or we will live miserably apart. # In cultural politics these days there is much talk of diversity and differ- ence. This is all to the good, insofar as it encourages us to welcome the many distinctive traditions and visions that have flowed into America</page><page sequence="14">20 THE GEORGIA REVIEW from around the world. But if, while respecting how we differ, we do not also recognize how much we have in common, we will have climbed out of the melting pot into the fire. Every day's newspaper brings word of people suffering and dying in the name of one distinction or another. We have never been slow to notice differences- of accent, race, dress, habits. If we merely change how those differences are valued, celebrating what had formerly been despised or despising what had been celebrated, we continue to define ourselves and one another in the old divisive ways. Ethnic labels are especially dangerous, for if we pin them on as badges of pride, we may have difficulty taking them off when others decide to use them as targets. The larger the group identified by a label, the less likely it is to be a genuine community. Haste or laziness may lead us to speak of blacks and whites, of Christians and Muslims and Jews, of Armenians and Mexicans, yet the common life transcends such categories. Sharing a national anthem, a religion, or a skin color may be grounds for holding rallies or waging war, but community is more intimate than nationality, more subtle than race or creed, arising not from abstract qualities but from the daily give-and-take among particular people in a particular place. It is also dangerous to separate a concern for human diversity from a concern for natural diversity. Since Europeans arrived in North America, we have been drawing recklessly on beaver and bison, trees and topsoil, petroleum, coal, iron and copper ore, clean air and water. Many of the achievements on which we pride ourselves are the result not of our sup- posed virtues but of this plundered bounty. We do not have another continent to use up; unless we learn to inhabit this one more conservingly, we will see our lives, as well as the land, swiftly degraded. There is no contradiction between caring for our fellow human beings and caring for the rest of nature; on the contrary, only by attending to the health of the land can we measure our true needs or secure a lasting home. Just before Eva was to leave again for college, she and I went for a hike in a nature preserve along Clear Creek, near Bloomington, to look at the hepatica and bloodroot and listen to the spring-high water. At the edge of the preserve, a wooden sign declared that the riding of horses was prohibited. The trail had been freshly gouged by horseshoes and was eroding badly. Trash snagged in the roots of sycamores along the stream. Much of the soil and its cover of wildflowers had washed from the slopes where people scrambled up to picnic on the limestone bluff.

What would it take to discourage people from dumping their worn-out washing machines in ditches? What would convince farmers to quit spraying poisons on their fields, suburbanites to quit spraying poisons on their lawns? What power in heaven or earth could stop loggers from seeing every tree as lumber, developers from seeing every acre of land as real estate, oil-company executives from seeing our last few scraps of wilderness as pay dirt waiting to be drilled? What would it take to persuade all of us to eat what we need, rather than what we can hold; to buy what we need, rather than what we can afford; to draw our pleasure from inexhaustible springs? Signs will not work that change of mind, for in a battle of signs the billboards always win. Police cannot enforce it. Tongue lashings and sermons and earnest essays will not do it, nor will laws alone bring it about. The framers of the Constitution may have assumed that we did not need a Bill of Responsibilities because religion and reason and the benign impulses of our nature would lead us to care for one another and for our home. At the end of a bloody century, on the eve of a new millennium that threatens to be still bloodier, few of us now feel much confidence in those redeeming influences. Only a powerful ethic might restrain us, retrain us, restore us. Our survival is at stake, yet worrying about our sur- vival alone is too selfish a motive to carry us as far as we need to go. Nothing short of reimagining where we are and what we are will be radical enough to transform how we live. Aldo Leopold gave us the beginnings of this new ethic nearly half a century ago, in A Sand County Almanac , where he described the land itself as a community made up of rock, water, soil, plants, and animals- including Homo sapiens, the only species clever enough to ignore, for a short while, the conditions of membership. "We abuse land because we see it as a commodity belonging to us," Leopold wrote. "When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect." To use our places with love and respect demands from us the same generosity and restraint that we show in our dealings with a wife or husband, a child or parent, a neighbor, a stranger in trouble. Once again this spring, the seventy-seventh of her life, my mother put out lint from her clothes dryer for the birds to use in building their nests. "I know how hard it is to make a home from scratch," she says, "I've done it often enough myself." That is not anthropomorphism; it is fellow feeling, the root of all kindness.</page><page sequence="16">22 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Doctors the world over study the same physiology, for we are one species, woven together by strands of DNA that stretch back to the be- ginnings of life. There is, in fact, only one life, one pulse animating the dust. Sycamores and snakes, grasshoppers and grass, hawks and humans all spring from the same source and all return to it. We need to make of this common life not merely a metaphor, although we live by meta- phors, and not merely a story, although we live by stories; we need to make the common life a fact of the heart. That awareness, that concern, that love needs to go as deep in us as the feeling we have when a child dashes into the street and we hear a squeal of brakes, or when a piece of our home ground goes under concrete, or when a cat purrs against our palms or rain sends shivers through our bones or a smile floats back to us from another face. With our own population booming, with frogs singing in the April ponds, with mushrooms cracking the pavement, life may seem the most ordinary of forces, like hunger or gravity; it may seem cheap, since we see it wasted every day. But in truth life is expensive, life is extraordinary, having required five billion years of struggle and luck on one stony, watery planet to reach its present precarious state. And so far as we have been able to discover from peering out into the great black spaces, the life that is common to all creatures here on earth is exceedingly uncom- mon, perhaps unique, in the universe. How, grasping that, can we remain unchanged? It may be that we will not change, that nothing can restrain us, that we are incapable of reimagining our relations to one another or our place in creation. So many alarm bells are ringing, we may be tempted to stuff our ears with cotton. Better that we should keep ears and eyes open, take courage as well as joy from our common life, and work for what we love. What I love is curled about a loaf of bread, a family, a musical neighbor, a building salvaged for art, a town of familiar faces, a creek and a lime- stone bluff and a sky full of birds. Those may seem like frail threads to hold anyone in place while history heaves us about, and yet, when they are braided together, I find them to be amazingly strong.</page></plain_text>
