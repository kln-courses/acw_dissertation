<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Insofar as the Ruby Wine Seduces Them': Cultural Strategies for Selling Wine in Inter- war Burgundy PHILIP WHALEN Abstract Burgundians developed new cultural strategies to market their wines during the inter-war years. Regional leaders, cultural intermediaries and the wine industry collaborated to overcome overproduction, prohibition and foreign as well as regional competition by exploiting the concept of terroir to develop a repertoire of popular festivals such as the Gastronomic Fair of Dijon, the Paulée ofMeursault, Saint Vincent parades, an annual wine auction at the Hospice in Beaune and a Burgundian Pavilion at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris. These drew attention to the unique qualities of their wines and suggested how they might be best consumed. This aggressive marketing strategy was so successful that it became a model for French agricultural products promoted through the système d'appelation d'origine contrôlée. The result united natural resources, historical memory, marketing strategies and cultural performance into an imaginative and enduring form of commercial regionalism.

The concern of production is over, it's now a matter of figuring out what we are going to do to turn this wine into money. Claude Chatelus, 'Après les Vendanges' (1934) The French wine industry surmounted a dizzying variety of challenges between 1 87 1 and 1940.1 Burgundians needed to look no further than their own cellars to gauge the effects of stiff competition and glutted markets. They responded by developing cultural marketing practices that addressed all aspects of wine production and consumption. An important aspect of this project was to articulate a rustic 'fable of identity' that provided an enchanted 'sense of place' and a restorative economic agenda.2 To this end, Burgundians developed the concept of terroir to identify the qualities of their wines in terms of geo-climatic origin and authenticated methods of production. This allowed uniquely regional products to be marketed through a novel repertoire of wine festivals and gastronomic fairs. The result united natural resources, historical memory, marketing strategies, and cultural performance into an imaginative and enduring form of commercial regionalism that other French regions have since emulated. The challenges confronting French wine-producing regions during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were collectively known as 'the wine crisis' (la crise du vin). Lasting nearly three quarters of a century, the wine crisis haunted the industry's biological, legal, sociological and economic vectors. Three biological blights of American provenance (imported with infected vines) - phylloxera (particularly between 1863 and 1900), mildew plasmopora viticola (1884), and black- rot uncinula necator (1898) - directly attacked the leaves, fruit and roots of French vines. The blights were partially controlled by the application of sulphur and copper fungicides (by les sulfureurs) but were finally eliminated only after cultural resistance to grafting French vines on to American roots was overcome (by les américanistes) . This massive process allowed for new vineyards to be planted in neat rows amenable to tractor cultivation. A gradual recovery was also aided by oenological improvements in the industrial fermentation, stabilisation and preservation of wines. Despite, and in part because of, these advances, the period immediately after the First World War was characterised by general overproduction, increasing production costs compounded by lowered profits, growing competition from Australia and Algeria (the latter officially a département of France), innovatively fraudulent practices and the ever-present threat of union activism and labour radicalisation - as had happened in the Midi region (1907) and in Champagne (191 1). Gains made during early 1920s were again offset by US and Scandinavian prohibition(ism), high foreign import taxes, continued foreign 1 For contrasting views of Burgundian activities during the Second World War see Jean Vigreux, La Vigne du Maréchal Pétain (Dijon: Editions Universitaires de Dijon, 2005), and Donald Kladstrup and Petie Kladstrup 's more problematic Wine and War: The French, the Nazis, and the Battle for France's Greatest Treasure (New York: Broadway Press, 2002). 2 On the concept of cultural 'regionality', see Robert Cantwell, Ethnomimesis: Folklife and the Representation of Culture (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1993), 111-16.</page><page sequence="3">Cultural Strategies for Selling Wine in Inter-war Burgundy 69 competition and a general slump in demand caused by the economic depression of the 1930s.3 The early 1930s witnessed the introduction of new measures, collectively known as the Statut de la viticulture, and intended to reduce wine production and maintain prices.4 The Statut de la viticulture (Viticulture Regulations) limited production by imposing a ten-year ban on the planting of new vines by any growers already cultivating 10 hectares or producing more than 500 hectoliters of wine. A prime d'arrachage (a subsidy for tearing down vines approved in 1934 and implemented in 1936) required all vineyards whose overall acreage had expanded more than 5 per cent since 1924 to destroy 10 per cent of their vines. To discourage overproduction, subsidies were offered on wine not produced in excess of 100 hectolitre per hectare. Another measure required wines produced in excess of allowable limits and, by definition, in excess of what the market could absorb. This had the unintended consequences of bolstering the spirits and 'cooked wine' industry that competed against the vintners' wines. Most drastic, and not without following substantial debate, was the introduction of a minimum pricing index (prix social) to support small producers. Another law, with arguably the longest-lasting impact, sought to regulate quality by prohibiting the use of hybrid varietals for commercial purposes. Far short of resolving the wine crisis (crise du vin), if not entirely ineffective, the Statut de la viticulture regulations angered vintners, who perceived themselves attacked rather than supported by the new policies. Conditions in early 1937 remained so difficult that Burgundian vintners wondered whether or not to tear out their vineyards and turn to farming instead.5 In fact, Burgundians were not ready to concede defeat. They have aggressively and successfully marketed the reputation of their wines since harvesting their first Pinots in the 1370s. The Ordinance of Duke Philip the Bold (Philippe le Hardi) of 1395 asserted that Burgundy produced the 'best and most precious wines imaginable for the nourishment and sustenance of human creatures'.6 Considering their wines to be worthy of the popes and kings they entertained, the dukes and bishops of Burgundy inaugurated a politics of taste. Their strategy proved viable (especially in a day when the chemical properties of fermentation remained more mysterious than understood or controlled), and continues to market and sell regional vintages into the twenty-first century.

Gevrey-Chambertin, reminded contemporaries how 'It must be recognised that it is to an incessant miracle of human labour that the wine owes its character and preservation. Our premier Burgundian wines are as much the children of human effort as the products of the soil.'7 This legacy would require the development of new cultural and marketing strategies during the inter- war period.8 Promoting an agenda of quality over quantity in 1924, Claude Chauveau (1861- 1940) reminded vintners and merchants that they were 'too modest in their dreams and demands'.9 As the senator for the Côte-d'Or (1910-40) and briefly, in 1932, minister of agriculture, Chauveau knew that it was in the region s interest to produce quality wines that could attain high prices. Even Joseph Marie Capus (1 876-1947), first a deputy (1919-28) and then a senator (1930-41) for the Gironde and one- time minister of agriculture in 1924 under Poincaré, who famously opposed AOC {appellation d'origine contrôlée) strategies based on terroir rather than domaine, as the former threatened to undermine Bordelais labelling practices based on the reputation 7 Gaston Roupnel, 'La Bourgogne, Types et Coutumes', Bien Public, 26 May 1936. 8 See Philippe Poirrier, 'Municipalité et Culture au XXe siècle: Des Beaux-Arts à la Politique Culturelle', thesis, Université de Bourgogne, 1995; Bazin, Histoire du Vin de Bourgogne; and Gilles Laferté, 'La construction d'identités territoriales à usage commercial dans l'entre-deux-guerres en Bourgogne', Cahiers d'Economie et de Sociologie Rurales, 62 (2002), 66-95. 9 'Les Réunions viticoles et vinicoles du 18 octobre à Beaune', La Terre de Bourgogne, 24 Oct. 1924, 681-2.

We enlighten consumers about the qualities of our country's different varieties, on the methods practised in the vineyards, and the quality of the vintages.'13 Despite regular good and exceptional vintages (notably in 191 1, 1915, 1923 and 1929), poor sales remained a pressing problem for Burgundy's overstocked cellars.14 Dr Foveau de Courmelles, an advocate of 'fermented grape juice in its multiple forms' and a member of the Congrès des Médecins amis du Vin, lamented that 'wine, far from respected, was . . . hated and blamed for all of our problems'.15 Even the economic recovery of 1925 provided little relief. Richard Bichet, the secretary- general of the Confederation of Vintners Associations of Burgundy, still believed that 'ordinary Burgundian wines' suffered from a 'grave crisis', with sales and profits so low that vignerons {vigneron in the Burgundian context designates both a winegrower and a 10 J.

In all fairness, it should be remembered that Médoc wine producers in the Bordelais had maintained superior sales since the turn of the century precisely by marketing their wines in terms of quality.

The vintner's knowledge of drawing a good wine from his harvest entails pain and perseverance. Arnold Van Gennep, Le Folklore français (1949) The formation of a commercially viable Burgundian folk identity revolving around the celebration of wine necessitated the (re)territorialisation of a broad range of existing and new practices in terms of terroir. As identity and place are mutually constituted, historically contingent, socio-spatial constructs, not since nineteenth- century neo-Romantics first identified patrimoine as a shared national resource have emotional responses to landscape and its products been so adroitly harnessed to a project of identity formation. Endowed with symbolic power and emotional appeal, wine serves as a powerful cultural tool.19 Gilbert Garrier reminds us of wine's religious, honorific, alimentary, medical and tonic uses throughout French history.20 Exuding the confidence of nineteenth-century social positivists, provincial notables and regional leaders made careers during the inter-war period by reducing Burgundy's history, culture and geography (past, present and future) to the seductive operations and necessary determinants of terroir. By the early twentieth-century both the consumption of wine and the geography of terroir had become 'fundamental references' to French cultural identity.21 The relation between French society and its bio-physical environment was systematically examined through the works of Paul Vidal de la Blache.22 Vidal 16 Richard Bichet, 'Les Caves Coopératives en Côte-d'Or', La Terre de Bourgogne, 14 Feb. 102 s. 17 Claude Chatelus, 'Après les Vendanges', La Terre de Bourgogne, 23 (1034), 377. 18 Gaston Roupnel, Histoire de la campagne française (Paris: Pion, 1932), 268, n. 6. 19 Gaston Roupnel described Burgundian wines as a 'subtle emanation from the soil' replete with euphoric qualities responsible for the regional joie de vivre in his preface to Camille Rodier, Le Clos de Vougeot (Dijon: L Venot, 193 1), 27-28.

See also Guy's When Champagne became French (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003), 42-4. 22 Vidal's chief accomplishment lay in linking the insights of Friedrich Ratzel's (1 844-1904) interpretive compromise between human agency and geographical determinism (then known as 'possibilism' and linked to political programs of social reform) to the rigors of Frédéric Le Play's (1 806-1 882) systematic habitat studies. Vidal investigated how biophysical landscapes provide a milieu in which mankind creates unique lifestyles.

Discussed since the seventeenth century, the polymorphous concept of terroir found its greatest practical expression and cultural resonance in twentieth-century Burgundy. 'Burgundians', notes James Wilson, 'are very nearly Freudian about the influence of the soil in shaping the character and the quality of their wine.' Acknowledging that the 'true concept is not easily grasped', he defines terroir as 'the totality of the elements of the vineyard habitat'. In addition to the 'physical elements of the vineyard habitat, the vine, subsoil, site, drainage and microclimate', Wilson includes a spiritual component: 'beyond the measurable ecosystem, there is an additional dimension - the spiritual aspect that recognises the joys, the heartbreaks, the pride, the sweat and the frustrations of its history'.24 Convinced that 'one cannot make sense of Burgundy without investigating the notion of terroir, Matt Kramer asserts that 'the mentality of terroir [although not uniquely Burgundian] . . . reaches its fullest expression there'.25 Indeed, to a review of previous scholarship analysing the micro- climactic and geological influences that contribute to the production of Burgundian wines, Jean-Robert Pitte reflects on the region s unique cultural history: Would the burgundies enjoy such prestige if the coast they came from were not situated close to the ancient capital for the dukes [of Burgundy] and a major travel route for medieval Europe, leading both to the Parisian basin and toward the northern plains? Would the Cîteaux monks, vowed to asceticism, have perfected the viticulture of their Vougeot vineyard to such an extent if they hadn't received all Europe's mighty and powerful at their abbey?26 Burgundians consciously (re)produced this mytho-historical discourse to market their wines during the inter-war period. The Burgundian novelist Colette insisted that wine provided the most direct expression of terroir. 'In the vegetal realm, only the vine renders intelligibly the true essence of the soil. What faithful translation. The secrets of the soil are expressed through the grape.'27 They employed the système d'appellation d'origine contrôlée to ontologise links between regional folkways and the characteristics associated with distinct geographical terroirs.28 By mid-century, this 23 Paul Vidal de la Blache, 'Les genres de vie dans la géographie humaine', Annales de Géographie, 20 (191 1), 193-212, 289-304. 24 James E.

A great Burgundy is like a country gentleman grown wise in the skillful cultivation of his lands.29 'Even in a nation with a rich democratic tradition', Kolleen Guy observes, 'all wines were not . . . equal'.30 The marketing of Burgundian wines in terms of terroir was successful where it sustained existing cultural interests.31 To this end, civic leaders turned to provincial cognoscenti to articulate regionally anchored cultural agendas that could embrace both modern industrial practices and conservative social values through the mechanism of 'applied folklore'.32 Eschewing the politics of Jean Charles- Brun's reconciliatory, Christian regionalism or the atavistic, nationalist monarchism of Charles Maurras, the Burgundian cultural agenda turned, instead, to regional folklorists.33 These men provided a core of valuable ethnographic observations that sought to '(re) cover' an essentialised, rustic and traditional cultural identity that could provide an alternative to the generic model of 'modern', anonymous, urban and bureaucratic national French identity.

This work fashioned a dynamic and rusticised Burgundian vigneron endowed with 'a rude and jovial sense of social life; a solid and dedicated intelligence; and a quick and firm mind' as providing a refreshingly modern and reassuringly rustic model of French labour. Inhabiting idealised villages whose 'narrow intimacy' fostered habits of modern sociability, these half-rural/half-urban vignerons refashioned French rural identity in terms of a distinct regional model that promised both change and stability: 'it is in the vignerons villages that developed the vigorous and alert Burgundian spirit in which vivaciousness is associated with the calm millennial forces emanating from the earth'.36 By virtue of quotidian activities within the Edenic space of their vineyards, Burgundian 'folk' enjoyed a privileged relation to terroir's eternal, transcendent and metaphysical properties. The nostalgic exploitation of terroir s rustic mystique in contemporary marketing practices was evident, for instance, in the commentary that accompanied a promotional film on Burgundian tourism called 'Vacation'. Roupnel provided the accompanying text that used the vignerons language (mâche, chaleur, et flamme) to underscore the link between the transcendent and material characteristics of local vintages. Burgundian wine contains more than the banal voluptuousness of one sense. It is more than the joy of a gourmand or the emotion of a gourmet. While it exalts our physical forces, it also nourishes our spiritual forces with joy and courage. Wine comes brimming with happiness and joie de vivre . . . euphoria, as would say some doctors. It invests you with its magnificent activity. It gives you the great abundance of a happy and moving soul ... To say it all, this good wine is complete . . . 34 Jeanton investigated village fairs, communal practices, folkloric traditions and the relations between urban areas in his Etude se géographie historique: Le Tournugeois; Le folk-lore tournugeois; and Le Maçonnais traditionalist et populaire.

In the Burgundian Côte-d'Or - a centre of Cistercian influence until the end of the Ancien Régime - the Confrérie de Saint Vincent simply became the Société des Vignerons. Henri Vincenot explained the continuing absence of religious figures as resulting from a combination of nineteenth-century republican hostility and the Catholic Church's own censorship of Retrograde and pagan superstitions'.40 The contentiousness surrounding the selection of one saint over another sometimes prompted the Second Empire to disband politicised fraternities. Fifteen different saints - including Bernard, Martin, Sebastian and Vincent - were recognised by Burgundian vignerons as patrons only in the mid-nineteenth century.41 The church exercised its influence on annual religious processions to honor Saint Vernier, while radical and socialist workers' associations with more profane interests preferred the benedictions of Saint Martin. Seeking to maintain control of their own affairs and to avoid legal difficulties, vignerons of the 1860s simply and collectively adopted the fourth-century martyr Vincent of Saragossa as their patron saint to protect their labours and wines.42 By the 1930s, vintners easily conflated terroirs religious and secular narratives to lyrically promote their regional varietals. The event resembled a Corpus Christi celebration dedicated to secular pursuits.

He continued the analogy the following year by likening the vintners' need to market their wines to a spiritual and ennobling crusade.43 Since then, writes Jean-Robert Pitte, 'one or several bishops have come every year for the occasion, marching in procession amid the banners and statues of Saint Vincent, in the cold of January, before celebrating mass, listening to a colorful sermon, and, finally sitting down to a fortifying banquet accompanied by ample quantities of wine'.44 The Burgundian campaign for the Système d'appellation d'origine contrôlée Personal selfishness and general indifference have created the situation in which we find ourselves today . . . I'm not unaware that most if not all would like to see the [AOC] laws applied to their neighbours but not to themselves. Albert Noirot, 'Les appellations d'origine contrôlée', Le Bien Public, 19 February 1936, 7 The concept and mechanism of terroir withstood challenges from competing and discordant small proprietor, local co-operative and corporate industrial interests.45 Burgundians who supported a concept of terroir that identified the merits of regional wines in terms of geographic origins and their methods of production collaborated successfully to defend the Système d'appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) in court.46 Jean-François Bazin notes that self-help organisations representing the professional interests of co-operative cellars, growers, merchants and a few agricultural labourers (as in Ladoix-Serrigny in 1930) gradually converged - despite their competing interests - to support the making and marketing of quality wines during this period.47 From serving as president of the Syndicat des viticulteurs de Chambertin to authoring essential tracts that anchored the AOC system in the Bugundian notion 43 Abbé E.

The government recognised four methods of regulating the French wine industry: terroir in Burgundy, estates (property) in Bordeaux, labels (manufacturer) in Champagne, and varietals in Alsace. Although the notion of AOC based on terroir was limited to Burgundy, it has subsequently been embraced as the dominant paradigm for other agricultural products in France. See, for example, Bazin, Histoire du Vin de Bourgogne, 17-23; Philip Whalen, 'The Development of the Burgundian Système d'Appellation d'origine contrôlée', in Carmen Cullen, Guy Pickering and Rod Phillips, eds., Bacchus to the Future (St. Catherines: Brock University Press, 2002), 593-606; and Marion Demossier, 'Territoires, produits et identities en mutation: Les Hautes-Côtes en Bourgogne viticole', Ruralia, 8 (2001), 141-56.

He contributed considerable rhetorical talents and his national professional academic reputation to promoting Burgundy's wines. Contemporary sources celebrated Roupnel's efforts 'to serve the cause of wine'.48 He wrote an influential article for the Dépêche de Toulouse in 1922 that identified the principle causes of 'la crise du vin'. Speaking as a respected vintner from Gevrey-Chambertin, Roupnel stressed in his analysis the impact of import and export taxes on wine and the questionable quality of so-called fine wines: First we have to understand among ourselves: there's wine and then there is wine. Ordinary wine continues to find the outlets it needs in France ... It is in external markets . . . where fraudulent practices of frightening proportions take place . . .that resides the veritable cause of the wine crisis. He further argued that 'the majority of wines sold behind respectable labels are more often the product of the chemist's laboratory rather than the vintner's cellar'. The remedy, he urged, rested with vintners themselves: 'Follow the example of the young mayor of Dijon [Gaston Gérard] who travels abroad to further the interests of French wines. You must imitate his initiative and counter foreign propaganda [US and Scandinavian prohibitionism] with French propaganda.'49 By 193 1 the Association viticole de la Côte-d'Or threw its support behind legal measures that would 'assure the profitable [rénumératrice] sale of agricultural pro- ducts . . . such as wines needing protection from foreign (and colonial) competition in the métropole'.50 The producer of slightly more than 40 per cent of European wines in 193 1, France only exported 2.5 per cent (as compared with 17 per cent by Italy, 37 per cent by Greece, and 28 per cent by Portugal).51 Given Burgundy's difficulty in selling its wines during the glut conditions of the 1920s and the depression of the 1930s, Roupnel turned to journalism. He crossed swords with Colette over her public support for the mixed and less expensive vin de marque (labels) marketed by unscrupulous négociants (merchants).52 Roupnel championed, instead, the regionally 48 Le Progrès de la Côte-d'Or, 10 Sept. 1937. 49 Gaston Roupnel, 'La Crise du Vin', Dépêche de Toulouse, 2 Nov. 1922, 1. 5U President Jouignot, ^exploitation agricole et viticole de Nuits-St-Georges , La Ierre de Bourgogne, 5 April 193 1, 210.

A dinner held for concerned parties at the Ramponneau restaurant in Dijon on 24 January 1927, for instance, staged a debate concerning the relative merits of vin de cru and vin de marque provocatively described in a flyer distributed to attendees that included important merchants including Albert Geisweiler, Jean Legrand and Thomas Bassot: 'we wish to make you judges in a quarrel that divides Burgundy, where the vins de marques are created with an eye to destroy the vins de crus.'54 By 1932 Gaston Gérard, the major of Dijon, contributed to this campaign when he told the delegates of the Assemblée générale du Syndicat viticole de la Cote-d'Or, 'let's not fight over quantity or price but, rather on our own terms - quality'.55 Etienne Camuzet (i 867-1946), mayor of Vosne-Romanée (1900-29) and a deputy for the Côte-d'Or (1902-32), mobilised regional support for the legal implementation of stricter labelling practices and the regulation of fraud in the wine industry by means of the AOC system.56 This association entailed the development of a formidable working relationship between Roupnel and Albert Noirot, the outspoken lobbyist for the protection of the proprétaires -viticulteurs in the southern Côte-d'Or.57 They had to contend with an equally strong, well-organised and capitalised lobby of merchants within Burgundy. The influential Albert Rossigneux of Geisweiler and Sons, for instance, argued strongly and persuasively against the implementation of AOC regulations before the Commercial Union of the Commune of Nuits-Saint- Georges on 4 October 1909.58 His main points were that territorial delineation did not guarantee quality as wines changed from year to year, that the system of labels associated with a particular merchant or commercial firm did more than anything else to promote honesty, and that very little kept dishonest vintners or merchants from fraudulently identifying their stocks.59 As late as 1923, the president of Beaune's chamber of commerce, Charles Bourchard père, still resisted efforts - such as the ministry of agriculture's continued interest in the stamps or labels of authenticity 53 Gaston Roupnel, 'Le Cru et la Marque', Le Progrès de la Côte-d'Or, 3 March 1930. 54 'En ce moment un des bouguignons presents prendra la parole dans ces termes. . .', 24 Jaunary 1927.

At bottom, he didn't know and little cared, that what he drank under the name of Chambertin came from the village of Morey, or that which he bought under the name of Pommard came from the commune of Santenay or Chassagne. Today we tell him that such practices are fraudulent and he no longer understands anything nor which saint to pray to.64 From 1924 to 1936 the vintner Albert Noirot of Vosne-Romannée, the lawyer Louis Fyot of Dijon, Georges Gouges of the Syndicat générale de la Côte-d'Or, the Marquis Sem-Claude d'Angerville of the Fédération viticole de Beaune, and Gaston Roupnel collaborated in the series of important legal cases collectively know as the 'Côte-de-Nuits' trial which finally succeeded in anchoring Burgundian labelling practices in terms of terroir.65 Following numerous and contentious hearings, the process culminated in the 30 July 1935 AOC law on labelling practices. Léon Blum's minister of the budget, Charles Marie Spinasse, assured the Revue du vin de France of the government's support for a policy of quality over quantity: 'The era when we could sell anything to anybody at any price is over. We must produce quality products to retain the loyalty of our foreign customers.'66 The Revue's editor, Raymond Badouin, who agreed that the pursuit of high-quality wines should be a collective goal and endeavour, wrote, in a response to Noirot and Roupnel's 'Open Letter to the Minister 60 Letter from Charles Bouchard, dated 1 Feb. 1923, to Monsieur le Ministre in Fonds Geisweiler &amp; Fils, Nuits-Saint-Georges, 'Mise en place des A.O.C. 61 See Philippe Chauvet, 'Le Problème des Appellations d'Origine', La revue des Boissons, 4 Jan. 1936, and 'II ne faut pas changer le non de nos vieux crus', L' Intransigent, 1 1 March 1927, 62 Raymond Brunet, 'Les Appellations d'Origine', Le Moniteur Vinicole, 22 July 1936, i, and Raymond Brunet and Marie-Louise Laval, 'Les appellations de Bourgogne', Le Moniteur Vinicole, 23 Jan. 1937, 2. 63 J.

But we can amend it and bring to these reforms an attitude that is consistent with our interests and practices.'69 Roupnel's support for the development of the AOC system along with his famous defence of the vignerons' cru against Colette's vins de marque did more than help the 'Maison Roupnel père et fils' sell its Cazetiers and Mazoyères varieties. These interventions benefited growers along the Burgundian Côtes region, were interpreted as confirming his solidarity with the common folk70 and positioned Roupnel as a respected authority and spokesperson for Burgundian economic and cultural interests.71 Building on his reputation as an eloquent interpreter of Burgundy's historical and cultural traditions, Roupnel served as both a member of the first Commission régionale des appellations contrôlées in 1936-7 and the elected president of the Syndicat de Gevrey-Chambertin in 1936-8. In September 1937, leading vintners, merchants and politicians of the Burgundian Côte-d'Or convened in Nuits-Saint-Georges to listen to Gaston Roupnel's eagerly awaited report on measures necessary to ensure the equitable and successful application of the 1935 AOC laws.72 His five major recommendations included the establishment of loans to 67 Raymond Badouin, Revue du vin de France, 90 (1935), 13.

A central avenue, leading off the Place Wilson, about a mile in length, is covered over and lined with booths . . . Every one in the Côte-d'Or is represented, and the other regions of France exhibit their wines as well. The great sport at the Fair is going from booth to booth tasting; a small glass is sold for a franc. Gertrude Clark Powell, The Quiet Side of Europe (1959) Strategies employing the discourse of terroir and enacted through wine festivals and gastronomic fairs greatly benefited Burgundy's wine industry. Addressing the phenomenon of 'reinvented memory', Jean-François Bazin observes that Burgundian vineyards had forged wholesale traditions - presented as ancient but in reality born of the twentieth century - that represent a reinvented memory: 'Burgundian intelligence and skill have made the vineyards the repositories for vintners' collective memory, thereby allowing it to subsist or be reborn in modern times.'74 The inter- war period saw the creation of numerous gastronomic and wine societies.75 In 1923 the vintners Count Jules Lafon and Jacques Prieur 'revived' the traditional post-harvest dinner known as the paulée in order to 'celebrate the glory of [Burgundy's] harvest and new wines'.76 Lafon hoped that 'everyone could find their place according to their fantasy' at his 'unique spectacle'.77 Both were informed and prepared to exploit promotional techniques and strategies calculated to create lucrative and popular tourist events, with Prieur serving as general secretary of Meursault's 73 See Mack Holt on the creation of new place names calculated to acquire the cachet of particular terroirs in 'Place-Names and Vineyards in Burgundy: or, How Nuits became St. Georges', in Bacchus to the Future, 553-63. 74 Jean-François Bazin, 'La mémoire du Vin: Le souvenir et l'oubli dans le vignoble bourguignon', Histoire et Sociétés Rurales, 5 (1996), 21.

Lafon and Prieurs strategy included the participation of the region s most illustrious personalities.

The event drew the attention of national celebrities such as Louis Forest, president of the Club des Cents and writer for Le Matin. In addition to revealing the panegyric heights to which the rhetoric of the 'Religion of Wine' could waft, the following speech, given at the Paulée de Meursault in 193 1, underscored the events conscious effort to link Burgundian commerce and tourism through the rhetoric of terroir. The Gastronomic Fair! The Paulée! Such evocative expressions! Just to hear them, a fresh atmosphere charged with gourmand promises descends. Aromas dance and expand ... as nostrils flare with pleasure; palates agitate; and taste buds shudder in anticipation of their solemn charge: the wine- tasting session.

The Paulée s success and popularity were such that the National Committee for Wine Advertising imitated the event, hosting the first Paulée of Paris on 18 March 1932.80 The Irish travel writer Stephen Gwynn visited Chenôve in October 1929. He discovered that locals had transformed the annual crushing of the grapes into a harvest festival event open to tourists and visitors. Taking advantage of Chenôve s proximity to Dijon and easy access provided by tram service, Paul Court, a local wine merchant, purchased the ancient stone wine vats and massive wine presses, built in 1238 by Alice of Vergy, the widow of Duke Eudes III, and thereafter belonging to the dukes of Burgundy. Gwynn describes the 'rude beauty' and 'primitive and titanic' spectacle achieved when 'powerful carpentry' crushed tons of freshly harvested grapes: 'the weight of a block of stone weighing over twenty-tons ... is raised and lowered by gigantic screws and lever beams. There is counterpoise, so that one falls as the other rises.'81 In Gevrey-Chambertin, locals revived the 'Feast of King Chambertin', the anthropomorphic composite of local vintages, in 1925 to represent 'majestically' that village's grand cm. Appealing to motorists (automobilistes) the regional newspaper - Progrès de la Côte-d'Or- reminded readers that King Chambertin (seen in Figure 4 in his elaborate chariot) would tour the village accompanied by two monks representing the lineage of the monastic Clos de Bèze, and an escort of twelve young maidens whose 'charms and feminine graces correspond to the local terroir and symbolise the properties of its wines'.82 Further south along the Côte-d'Or, the mayor of Beaune, Joseph Pétasse, continued a tradition (since 1859) of auctioning new wines in bulk (a minimum of 228 litres) by officiating at the event in the cellar of the fifteenth-century Hospice de Beaune on the third Sunday in November.83 'In a long row of bottles all the new wines of Burgundy for the year are set out to be tasted, and visitors come by the thousands to try them and give their opinions. Buyers assemble from all the countries, and the auction goes on à la bougie; a taper is lit as each lot is put up, and the bidding finishes when the little candle has burnt itself out.84 This sale measured the wine trade's opinion of the most recent vintages and thereby regulated the current value of burgundies.85 Also aware of the 'economic urgency' to sell wines during the Great Depression, Mâcon's Georges Rozet further transformed the celebrated annual wine auction of Beaune into a festive two-day, Flemish tableau: 'We had to create an direct, collective, and - in appearance - a disinterested marketing programme whose 80 See Félix Chevalier, 'La Paulée de Paris', Revue du vin de France, $6 (1932), 7, and 'La 2ième Paulée de Paris', 68 (1933), 11-16. 81 Stephen Gwynn, Burgundy (New York: Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1935), 98. 82 'Les Fetes du Vin', Progrès de la Côte-d'Or, 13 Nov. 1925, 3. 83 Berthier and Sweeney, Les Confréries en Bourgogne, 332-3. 84 Gwynn, Burgundy, 80. 85 Ibid., 79-</page><page sequence="20">86 Contemporary European History Figure 4.

There, within the Hospice's ancient walls, 'amateurs and merchants taste, compare and discuss under the dark beams, insofar as the ruby wine seduces them'.87 Charles Bouchard recalled the event as a unique opportunity for buyers and amateurs, who hurried for the pleasure of buying a new bottle of good wine while informing themselves about the general quality of the harvest and the most promising wines of the year.88 The auction promoted the prestige associated with the idea of purchasing wines directly from vintner-proprietors. The two-day spectacle showcased quality vintages (approximately 2,000 bottles) before an important and knowledgeable audience and provided a practical opportunity for collectively identifying promising wines to invest in.89 Beaune s auction and wine festival easily lent themselves to media coverage; observers noted the presence of significant numbers of foreign 86 Georges Rozet, 'La Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin', in Jean-André Gallat, ed., La Côte-d'Or (Paris: Alépée, 1954), I57- 'Les Fêtes Vinicoles de Beaune', La Terre de Bourgogne, 26 Nov. 1927, 756.

The 192 1 fair drew 80,000 visitors to a town of 80,000 and netted, according to the mayor of Dijon s neat formula, 80,000+ francs.93 More precisely, Christelle Guilard has calculated that, for example, the 1926 fair grossed 828,977 francs and netted 92,722 francs after expenditures, salaries, free tickets and taxes; this was a considerable success that confirmed Gaston Gerard's recollection.94 While the fair would not always generate the profit hoped for, especially during the late 1930s, attendance doubled annually, peaking in 1925 when 600,000 visitors came to see the wares of approximately nine hundred merchants.95 Exhibits grew in number from 220 and - with great fluctua- tions - levelled off at 500, while attendance shrank back to an average of 175,000. While Dijon's Gastronomic Fair also drew exhibitors from around the world, it never ceased promoting Dijon's regional leadership. Nor did the influx of Parisian, national or international vendors threaten the fair's regional character.96 Scheduled events and menus continued to reflect preponderantly the Burgundian agenda and provide extended marketing opportunities for local wares and regional products.97 Wine amateurs who gathered in the 'Wine Alley' at Dijon's 193 1 Gastronomic Fair encountered quadruple rows of oilcloth-covered tables laden with artfully displayed wine-tasting glasses. The wine stalls, which, as they filled two contiguous rooms 50 metres long, could easily have constituted a fair of their own, drew the gaze of visitors with 'coquettish installations' calculated to impress the names of vintners, growers' associations and commercial distributors. Memorable stalls included Victor Morot and Co. s glass spiral staircase made entirely of coloured liqueur flasks and Antoine Rodeo s electrical windmill whose sails were covered in wine bottles.98 The most 90 Paul Thierry, 'La Vente des Vins des Hospices de Beaune', La Terre de Bourgogne, 15 Jan. 1933, 18, and Gilles Laferté, 'Un "folklore" pour journalistes: la Confrérie des Cavaliers du Tastevin', Ethnologie comparées, 8 (2005), 1-32. 91 'Voyages en Bourgogne.

A wine-tasting stand at Dijon's gastronomic fair, c. 1930 (contemporary postcard). successful innovation from the 1922 fair was the buvette-restaurant where visitors could rest, listen to music and continue to enjoy the regional vintages they sought or had only briefly sampled. 'On condition that one [did not] linger too long tasting at any one stall', one could tour 'all of the best' wines of Burgundy and France 'in less than one hour'.99 The novelist Marcel Grancher remembered that the wine and food halls offered customers the most: That is where the word 'fair' found its fullest expression.

Consequently there reigned a warm atmosphere, a cordiality, an enthusiasm rarely found elsewhere.100 Another successfully orchestrated wine spectacle included the 'revival' by Camille Rodier and Georges Faiveley of the ancient Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin (Brotherhood of the Knights of the Wine Taster).101 Their cellar (Caveau Nuiton) in Nuits-Saint-Georges first opened on 16-17 November 1934 and remains an important tool in the promotion of Burgundian vintages to this day.

Staged in an atmosphere that invoked Molièresque ribaldry and Rabelaisian gourmandise, the Chevaliers du Tastevin provided the signs of faux- folkloric regional authenticity in the Cistercian cellar of the celebrated Clos Vougeot during the late 1930s.102 These included garish garments, bawdy songs (provided by the Cadets of Burgundy choristers), pig roasts, gaudy furnishings and vague memories of obscure antecedents. The menu from the first chapter included four white and twenty-five red wines to accompany an eight-course meal. Through its highly dramatised, pseudo-historical and candle-lit wine-tasting events ('It's clearly a matter of the invention of public relations!'103), the Order became - and remains - one of the most effective promoters of the regions wines.104 Within a year, by 1935, the festivities of the Caveau Nuiton had to be replicated, for lack of space, at other venues and across an extended calendar: 'The success of our cellars grows daily', noted a journalist. 'People like to come not only from France but from abroad as well! That is why, despite its size, the vast cellar cannot accommodate all the gastronomes who come.'105 The participation in 1937 of the US ambassador, William C. Bullitt, among other foreign dignitaries, assured the annual festivities of an international cachet.106 102 The Clos Vougeot was purchased in 1945 and remains the home of the Chevaliers du Tastevin. See Paul André, Histoire du Tastevin (Neuchatel: Editions Messeiller, 1974). 03 Bazin, Les vins de Bourgogne, 105. 104 The Chevaliers du Tastevin celebrated their i,oooth gathering at the Clos Vougeot among 500 guests representing 20 countries on 10 June 2008. The menu, seeking to simulate that of the first gathering in 1934, was bolstered by five whites, fifteen burgundies, and five liqueurs.

On this Burgundian soil . . . which for centuries has dispersed its riches through the glory of its wines . . . you represent a benign and serene force . . . the example of your labours, of your fidelity to this familial domain where the reputation of your ancestors precedes you, ranks among the most consoling on which to meditate.108 By 1934 these spectacular dégustations had been packaged into a full-scale regional phenomenon. The 'Nuits de Saint Georges' was linked to other important wine- tasting festivities associated with the region's most recently bottled vintages. Together these included the wine auction at the Hospice de Beaune, and the Paulée de Meursault - respectively scheduled for the third Saturday, Sunday and Monday of each November - to form an annual cycle called the Trois Glorieuses.109 Not to be excluded from the marketing phenomena, the president of the Comité Bourgogne refurbished the ancient abbey of Clairvaux to link modern and historical interests through a revived tradition of municipal festivals. Among these was Dijon's first modern Fête de la Vigne (wine festival). Its September parade snaked from Noël- Jules Gerard's emblematic statue (le Bareuzat) of a man crushing newly harvested grapes underfoot to the cathedral for a solemn mass that merged profane and spiritual preoccupations by 'glorifying the Lord who gives us such good wines'.110 Following its success, Dijon's Gaston Gérard and Macôn's Gabriel Jeanton directed the Association for the Renaissance of Popular Burgundian Festivals to create the first Burgundian Wine Festival in 1930. in They received assistance from Dijon's Committee for City Festivals, whose mission to 'develop and encourage initiatives aiming to give Dijon festivals susceptible of favouring commerce and industry', held the organisation of a wine festival as its first priority along the way.112 Eager to participate in this flowering of cultural activity, Jacques Copeau, the theatre director and founder of the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier in Paris, who had helped André Gide to found the Nouvelle Revue Française in 1909, relocated his theatre company in Pernand-Vergelesse, Burgundy, from 1925 to 193 1 to develop a 'rustic' 107 Camille Rodier, Le Clos de Vougeot (Dijon: L.

Beaune s festivities were inaugurated with a parade of historical figures - starting with the Roman emperor Aurelis Valerius Probus, who had planted vineyards in ancient Beaune, through a litany of Valois and Bourbon royals who preferred red wines, to the patriotic poilus (French infantrymen) who courageously held off advancing German armies at Verdun fortified by litres of wine - and were followed by a float on which rode the (beauty) Queen of Beaune 'who responded to the cheers of her subjects by radiating smiles in all directions'. The Vieux-Colombier troupe concluded the day with an evening ballet of 'The Red Wine and the White Wine' in which '[g]racious young women, some dressed in the colour of "Meursault gold drop" with an arched garland of flowers held over their heads, and others in "wine red" holding an amphora on the left shoulder and a Burgundian goblet in the right hand, danced with charming grace to a wonderful musical accompaniment.'118 The strategy of regionally linking cultural and economic agendas through folkloric wine festivals (described as 'the circuit organised throughout Burgundy, designed to allow tourists to become better acquainted with the region's wines') was so successful that it was harnessed to national interests through a National Festival of French Wines. Rotating to a different wine-growing region every year (Macon in 1933, Bordeaux in 1934, Champagne in 1935, Colmar in 1936, La Baule in 1937, and so on) each festival, touted as 'surpassing' the previous, simply replicated the marketing strategies of existing wine festivals and gastronomic fairs on a grander scale.119 Macon simultaneously hosted the first Fête des Vins de France and Congrès des Caves coopératifs on 1 3-1 5 August 1933. The Maçonnais were of the same mind as the organisers of Dijon's 1922 wine parade, who intended their 'essentially Burgundian' event to signal 'an amusing and picturesque reconstruction gaily glorifying [the region's] principal and famous products'.120 The Revue du vin de France provides a 113 See, for example, 'Les Fêtes du Vin', Progrès de la Cote-d'Or, 13 Nov. 1925, 3. 114 Jacques Copeau, 'Jacques Copeau en Bourgogne', La Bourgogne d'Or, 21 (1928), 253-5.

The first day opened with a reception of the wine queens of France (mustard, cassis and gingerbread queens were included as well) dressed in red, white and blue dresses to constitute a French flag. Following brief introductions and speeches, the queens - each representing a different wine-growing region within France - collectively posed with 'ravishing docility' for a 'swarm' of photographers and newsmen'.121 A banquet at midday was followed by an elaborate parade, organised by Lucien Boyer, the 'master of theatrical productions', which represented 'The Splendour of Wine across the Ages' and presented the history of France in terms of its historic relation to wine. Building on the parade techniques and float iconography rehearsed at Dijon's Gastronomic Fair's cortège du vin since 1922, where planners anticipated 'an amusing, picturesque and happy reconstitution of our most celebrated products', the floats of Macôn's 'historical parade' depicted a Grecian bacchanal, Egypto-Roman wine production, the monks of the abbey of Citeaux, the court of the dukes of Burgundy and wine sustaining French poilus in victory at Verdun.122 One observer commented that the parade 'affirmed the French 121 'Mâcon célèbre la Fête national des Vins de France', Progrès de la Côte-d'Or, 14 Aug. 1933, 1. l¿¿ 'La Foire', Le Progrès de la Côte-d'Or, 12 Nov. 1922, 2.</page><page sequence="27">Cultural Strategies for Selling Wine in Inter-war Burgundy 93 cult of wine across the ages; for good wine . . . preserves good humour, eternal youth and an impulsive gaiety . . . recognised by the generous and disinterested'.123 The next day's agenda included the inauguration of a new agricultural research centre in Macon, followed by an afternoon of banqueting and ceremonial speeches. The president of the local touring club greeted the minister of agriculture and invited the assembled three hundred guests to enjoy 'a particularly copious menu' that included nine wines and as many speakers.124 The Queen of French Wines, Mile Paulette Martin, concluded the ceremonies by giving her sash to the city of Bordeaux (host of the 1934 Fête des Vins de France) and leading the bands and choirs in the official anthem of the Fêtes des Vins de France - the 'Burgundian March'. In the evening, less tightly scripted events enabled a more carnivalesque atmosphere. The crowd tasted different wines, endured broadcast drinking songs (to which 'the general public shouted rather than sang the refrains') and visited an open-air, village- style renaissance fair (kermesse) festooned with illuminated fountains, electric signs, multicoloured garlands and a battery of lights resembling 'white clouds dancing overhead'.125 By morning, the following morning's paper assured, 'none noticed the 7a.m. thundershower'.126 The Burgundian pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition It is almost a cliché to declare wine an integral part of French glory and our national spirit . . .

He added that it would provided a fine opportunity to demonstrate the merits of Burgundian AOC wines to 'millions and millions' of visitors and that it was time to organise a local committee to ensure 'the success of this colossal work'.131 The Exposition provided a showcase for the advantages that regional economic strategies and local labour practices offered the national economy. The administrative director of the Exposition's regional committee, 'Commander' Charier, anticipated that 'with each of its regional pavilions - directly produced by the regions and remaining in regional hands - the Regional Centre will be like a "Little France'".132 The regional centre, he asserted, was a vast laboratory 'where the smaller regions (pays) illustrate how to reconcile necessary traditions and contemporary techniques within the larger Country . . . like a vast symphony of French provinces ... it produces the image of ... a dynamic France and proves that regional life remains a present reality'. Charier hoped that visitors who discovered Burgundian gastronomy in the centre's appropriately rustic setting would take home a powerful memory (souvenir) of the region's artisan, aesthetic and folkloric riches. Mindful of tourist interests, the administrative director also expected that they would leave imbued with a strong desire to visit Burgundy for themselves in order to appreciate better its charms in their original scale and setting. The 1,600 sq-m Burgundian pavilion (Bourgogne- Franche-Comté et Pays de l'Ain Pavillon) provided a 'picturesque' composite of 'traditional styles and modem tendencies' in a new vernacular style.133 It showcased examples of high-quality, regional craftsmanship and design. Aware of the economic interests involved, the Exposition's Agriculture committee drew attention to the 'personal advantages that participation in this manifestation would bring'.134 Notable vintages were selected to represent Burgundian varietals at the Exposition's wine-tasting stand (Stand de Dégustations des Vins d'Appellation Contrôlée). Modelled on Camille Rodier's popular cellar (caveau) in Nuits-Saint- Georges, the Expositions rural centre featured a 600-sq-m 'Burgundian cellar'. Any of the cellar's 50,000 bottles of regional vintages could be tasted and purchased 128 Gaston Roupnel, 'Le Pavillon des Vins', in Edmond Labbé, ed., Exposition internationale des arts et techniques dans la vie moderne: Rapport générale, vol. 7 (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1938), 330. 129 Ossip Pernikoff, La France, pays du tourisme (Paris: Pion, 1938, 79). 130 Jacky Rigaud, Millésisme en Bourgogne, 1846-2006 (Clemency: Terre en vues, 2005), 52-3. 131 Albert Noirot, 'Les appellations d'origine contrôlées', Le Bien Public, 19 Feb. 1936, 7. 132 Henri Charier, quoted in 'L'économie bourguignonne vue de l'Exposition', Progrès de la Côte-d'Or, 13 Nov. 1937, 1. 133 Paul Dupays, L'Exposition Internationale de IQ37 (Paris: Henri Didier, 1938), 255. 134 Letter from Le Délégué-Gérant: M.

The tour of the pavilion was completed by a visit to the restaurant, where 'high priests of gastronomy officiated with dignity'. The Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, along with its accompanying choir, the Cadets of Burgundy, presided at the Paris Exposition's 'Burgundian days' on 25 and 26 October. These ended with a 'brilliant soirée' in the Exposition's French wine pavilion. There, in addition to Exposition officials, Dijon's Progrès de la Côte-d'Or reported, celebrated gastronomes such as Gaston Dérys and Curnonsky, leading citizens such as Edmond Chaix, president of the Touring-Club de France, Dr Portmann, Léon Douarche, general secretary of the International Office of Wine, Roland Marcel, high commissioner of tourism, and Prosper Gervais, president of the Society of French Agriculturalists; ranking political technocrats such as M. Monnet, the national minister of agriculture, and Paul Bur, director of France's 13 th French Economic District and president of Dijon's chamber of commerce, Eugène Mugniot, president of the P.-L.-M. rail company, Robert Trébor, president of the Union of Parisian Theatres; and a veritable flotilla of syndicated journalists including Pierre Argence, commercial president of Havas; all told, 350 from Paris and the regions attended what was dubbed a 'magnificent instrument of Burgundian propaganda'.135 Noting that the interests of the Burgundian cultural project were not reducible to ephemeral spectacles and interminable banquets, Georges Faiveley, the originator of the Caveau Nuiton in Nuits-Saint-Georges, presented an important dossier on viticulture to the government's inter-ministerial committee (which reported to the General Assembly's regional committee) in the final days of 1937. While deputies discussed whether to end or extend the Exposition, Faiveley remained focused on addressing the problems and challenges confronting the French wine industry. 135 J.T., 'La Bourgogne à l'Exposition', Progrès de la Côte-d'Or, 29 Oct. 1937, 1.</page><page sequence="31">Cultural Strategies for Selling Wine in Inter-war Burgundy 97 These included fraudulent sales, preferential policies for legitimate AOCs, and the elimination of the appellation ordinaire.136 Although contested by Burgundian merchants such as Geisweiler &amp; Fils, who preferred to invest their 'capital' in recognisable labels, Faiveley s testimony underscored the ascendancy of the Burgundian economic agenda within an industry hitherto dominated by the interests of Bordeaux s much larger Gironde region.137 Although debate over the AOC would continue until the outbreak of the Second World War, Burgundy's centrality to French viticulture was both in the ascendant and incontestably unique. Indeed, one of the French national lottery's themes was the 'Wines of France' series. Its September 1938 drawing was held and filmed in Beaune along with a banquet with the Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin at the Caveau Nuiton. The Burgundian poet Max Cappe noted that the event drew national and international attention to 'the virtues and incessant labours of Burgundy'.138 Conclusion Let the French convince themselves to eat well once again and they will remedy the disease of languor . . . they will salvage their optimism . . . and a great chunk of their economy ... A supplement to wellbeing is priceless; no one can lose by treating oneself to it. Jean-Robert Pitte, French Gastronomy (2002), 178. Burgundy's political leaders and cultural intermediaries collaborated to link economic interests, cultural policies, historical memory and popular politics to create a new form of commercial republican regionalism. They orchestrated elaborate spectacles calculated to reclassify existing, invented and remembered traditions into a provisionally stable and heterogeneous rustic modernity. The rustic and polyvalent sign system of terroir was inscribed on regional products and civic events in order to promote patterns of consumption and consumer identification that could help Burgundians compete in prevailing markets.139 In particular, gastronomic folkways from multiple socio-economic strata and historical periods were assembled into appealing lifestyle templates (genres- de-vie) that contemporaries might use to fashion new self-identities, script an updated collective heritage and reposition Burgundy's economic importance.

[i]f it exists at all is a conjuncture of distribution entirely dependent upon remote processes of production and consumption, networks of communication, lines of economic force'.

He thought that it had transformed a once 'perfectly calm Dijon' into a thriving centre offering all 'the advantages of present times'. He especially lingered on the event's wine festival to recall how visitors admired the floats overflowing with young women representing qualities associated with the region's famous wine-producing villages, which could stimulate sales.140 The vital role early twentieth-century Burgundians played in the development of cultural formations that supported regional economics and not only voiced their expertise but also contested the authority of Parisian administrators, continues to inform France. The ideological cornerstone of Burgundy's cultural identity project, based on quality and reflected in the notion of terroir, remains paradigmatic within French agricultural policies. The Système d'appellation d'origine contrôlée articulated by Burgundians during the 1920s and 1930s was extended to all eligible French agricultural products in 1990. The French ministry of agriculture and the ministry of culture's Conseil National des Arts Culinaires conducted a joint census of all of France's produits du terroir in 1992. Following the Burgundian model, they created a legal framework that made it possible to delineate geographical terroir and regulate agricultural products produced within those boundaries as produits du terroir. Not least of these were the economic rewards.141 The 192 million AOC bottles of Burgundy sold for an average of €6- 7 in 2006- 7. 142 These successes suggests the continued viability of Burgundian-style AOC regulations at a time when the Burgundian wine industry struggles anew with increasing international competition; alternative cultivation practices (verte, organic and biologique), oenological developments that enhance vinification (cuvaison); multiplying and expansive definitions oí terroir (such as the creation of the 100th appellation, 'Bourgogne Tonnerre', on 17 July 2006), labelling practices that variously identify ingredients and/or underscore nutritional and health benefits; evolving consumer tastes and trends; the relative leverage of wine and spirits industries on domestic markets and international trade; and the impact of advertising strategies and campaigns. 140 Albert David, 'Après la 5ième Foire Gastronomique', Progrès de la Côte-d'Or, 23 Nov. 1925, 2. 141 David Menival, 'The Transformation of Ordinary Wines; A New Danger for Vintage Wines', Vineyard Data Quanitification Society Working Papers, 2005, available at www.vdqs.net/Working_Papers/Text/WP_2005/Menival.pdf. 142 'Chiffres-clés de la Bourgogne Viticole', Bureau interprofressionnel des Vins de Bourgogne, available at www.vins-bourgogne.fr/gallery_files/site/392/i932.pdf; Etudes des Centres d'Economie rurale de Bourgogne (2004); Office National Interprofessionnel des Fruits, des Légumes, des Vins et de l'Horticulture, available at www.onivins.fr/; and Centre de Ressources Documentaires - BIVB, available at www.vins-bourgogne.fr.</page></plain_text>
