      <p>This pocket‚Äêsized book, handy for daypack or satchel, is built around Wainwright's fine paintings and drawings. It is a hybrid of field guide and natural history of the larger and most likely to be encountered mammals of Costa Rica. Most bats and rodents are treated only at the Family or Subfamily level. Each account consists of a single page that groups a painting of the animal, its skull, tracks, range map in Costa Rica, and a brief outline of its major features. There is no detailed text description of the species, but the paintings are generally easily recognizable. Each account is accompanied by text with entries for Names (mostly etymology), Range, Size, Similar Species, Natural History, Sounds, Conservation, and References. The natural history section occupies the major part of the text and includes many interesting facts and observations, as well as additional drawings of scats, food plants, burrows, and bones. The information is, as stated by the author, chiefly derived from other sources but, for the most part, it is well researched and accurate. The text sometimes suffers from a colloquial, inelegant style with repetition of information, and is marred by some anthropomorphic interpretations of behavior and deterministic statements about evolution. The taxonomy used is slightly out of date, and the generic names are not those currently accepted for peccaries, paca, and jaguarundi.</p>
      <p>The guide seems aimed largely at tourists or nonscientists who will find it handy, easy to use, informative, and helpful. Scientists and anyone who desires a more complete description of the Mesoamerican fauna may still prefer to carry the larger but not heavier, <italic>A Field Guide to the Mammals of Central America and Southeast Mexico</italic> by Fiona Reid (1997. New York: Oxford University Press), with its species level coverage, elegant illustrations, and concisely written, fuller accounts of natural history.</p>
