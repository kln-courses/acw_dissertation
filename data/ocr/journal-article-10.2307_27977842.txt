<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 The Inca conquest and consolidation of the cotahuasi valley of southern peru Justin Jennings and Willy Y?pez Alvarez This article combines historical records and data from archaeological survey and excavations to describe the Inca occupation of the Cotahuasi Valley of southern Peru. The empire constructed an administrative center, established private estates dedicated to the sun and the Inca, built an Inca road through the valley, and created a ceremonial center from a heal ritual site. The high Inca investment in Cotahuasi was likely due to the valleys natural resources, its position as a transportation corridor, and its low level of political complexity preceding the conquest. Cotahuasi provides a good case study of how imperial power was mediated through heal elites. Este art?cub combina los registros hist?ricos con datos recolectados de una prospecci?n arqueol?gica de superficie y excavaciones de prueba para describir la ocupaci?n imperial inca en el valle de Cotahuasi en la sierra sur del Per?. La ocupaci?n inca en el valle de Cotahuasi es un buen ejemplo de control imperial mediada por b ?lite beai. El imperio construy? un centro administrativo, estableci? propiedades privadas dedicadas al sol y al Inca, instal? un camino principal a trav?s del ca??n, y cre? un centro ceremonial en un sitio ritual beai. El poder Inca pudo sentirse, tambi?n, en cada puebb en las vasijas que usaron y en las estructuras por donde pasaron cada d?a. Este alto nivel de inversi?n parece haber sido el producto de tres factores en h zona: b presencia de fuentes de recursos naturabs, b ubicaci?n del va?e en un corredor natural desde el Cuzco hasta b costa, y el nivel bajo de desarrolb pol?tico. The Inca Empire s impact across the Andes was substantial and the imposition of imperial rule wrought deep political and economic changes on the regions that were conquered. Inca power, however, was not monolithic. Using a flexible and heteroge neous consolidation strategy, administrators adapted their methods of rule to local conditions (e.g., Alconini 2004; Covey 2000; D'Altroy 1992; Menzel 1959). An areas political complexity, distance from the imperial capital, hostility to outside control, ideo logical importance, wealth potential, and other fac tors appear to have significantly shaped the ways in which different groups were integrated into the em pire (Kaulicke et al. 2002, 2003, 2004; Malpass 1993; Schreiber 1992). The Cotahuasi Valley in the highlands of Arequipa was one of the many areas that fell under Inca rule. Unlike the neighboring Coica Valley to the south (e.g., Cook 1982; Manrique 1985), there are very few historic accounts to guide our interpre tations of the Inca consolidation of the region. This paper combines these few accounts of Cotahuasi with Justin Jennings. Department of World Cultures, Royal Ontario Museum, 100 Queens Park, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada, collota@gmail.com.

While we occasionally draw on earlier preliminary archaeological work in the area (Ch?vez Ch?vez 1982; Ch?vez Ch?vez and Salas Hinojoza 1990; Neira Avenda?o 1998; Trawick 1994, 2003), our interpretations are largely based on the results of our ten month survey and excava tion project that took place in the upper portion of the valley (Jennings 2002). This paper is organized into four parts. First, we describe the valleys geography, environment, and available natural resources. Second, we discuss the evidence for the nature of the local occupation dur ing the Late Intermediate Period in order to under stand the conditions that the Incas encountered. In the third and longest section, we consider the Inca consolidation of the valley through the available his torical documents, oral histories, and archaeological data. Finally, we conclude our paper by briefly com paring the Inca impact on Cotahuasi to the empire s effect on other areas of highland Arequipa, and sug gest that the Inca pursued in this region a broadly similar consolidation strategy involving intensive infrastructural investment and the cooption of in termediate elites. Geography, Environment, and Natural Resources With its valley edges rising in places over 3,500 meters from the valley floor, Cotahuasi is the deepest can yon in the Americas (P?rez Vera 1997: 31). Located at 15 degrees south latitude and 73 degrees west lon gitude, the valley lies along the northern edge of the volcanic plateau of Arequipa in the Central Andes (Figure 1). The Cotahuasi-Oco?a is one of several rivers that cut deeply into this plateau as they travel to the Pacific Ocean. Volcanic eruption and tectonic uplift occurred in the Cotahuasi region throughout the Tertiary and into the Quaternary periods (Burger et al. 1998: 187; Olchauski and D?vila 1994). The valleys position as a resting point along a natural cor ridor between the sierra and the sea made it an im portant transportation and communication node in Perus southern sierra from at least the Spanish con quest until the early 20th century (Trawick 1994: 33). The valley's high number of snow-covered peaks and lakes (the Cotahuasi drainage is the second most extensive of Peru's fifty-four coastal rivers [Ch?vez Ch?vez 1982: 31]) makes it the most humid water shed in the western Andes (Ch?vez Ch?vez 1982: 31). This "enormous hydraulic potential," however, is mostly untapped because the steepness and depth of the canyon make this water difficult to harness for irrigation (Trawick 2003: 21). Nonetheless, irriga tion from springs and groundwater flows allow for good agricultural yields in many sections of the val ley (Trawick 1994: 40). In 1993, there were 4,776 hectares of arable land in the valley, although 37% of this land was abandoned or unused. Agriculture today is dominated by maize (62%) and potato (11%) production, with smaller amounts of wheat, oats, onions, quinoa, and other grains and tubers (AEDES 1998: 23). Agricultural terracing in the valley dates to at least the Middle Horizon (Jennings 2002: 216), and maize and other agricultural products figure prominently in the tribute collected from Cotahuasi by the Incas (Julien 1991: 21-31). The region is a rich source of obsidian, gold, silver, copper, and rock salt (Figure 2). One of the major obsidian sources in the central Andes is found above the modern town of Alca and Cahuana, pri marily within the Rio Chococo drainage (Burger et al. 1998; Jennings and Glascock 2002; Rademaker 2006). The valley was the primary supplier of obsid ian to the Cuzco area during the Late Horizon (Burger et al. 2000: 334). The valley also lies within the Puquio Caylloma zone, a set of ore-bearing deposits. The region is one of the principal metal producing areas in Peru and silver, gold, and copper are still mined in the canyon (Canchaya et al. 1995; INGEMMET 1995; Trawick 2003: 46). Prehistorically, the valley and its environs was one of the richest mining zones in the Andes (Oehm 1984: 13), and much of the Cotahuasi's tribute to the Inca Empire likely came in the form of silver and gold (Julien 1991: 32). Al though a few probable prehispanic shafts can be found in the valley (Ch?vez Ch?vez 1982: 60; Jennings 2002: 244), large-scale mining operations 120</page><page sequence="3">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi Figure 1.

The authors' fieldwork location, the Cotahuasi Valley, is indicated on the map. appear to have taken place in the puna above the valley (Julien 1991:32;Trawick 1994:100-101). Near the town of Huarhua, there is a large deposit of rock salt found within limestone and other deep-water sedimentary rocks (Concha Contreras 1975: 74; Jennings 2002: 564-566). HuarKuas salt is currently the most valuable of Cotahuasi s commodities in the barter networks of southern Peru (Concha Contreras 1975: 74; Inamura 1981: 72), and the adjacent town of Huarhua lies on top of a setdement with a Late Horizon component (Jennings 2002: 566). Villag ers living in Huarhua also suggested to us that the site had been an important mine long before the Spanish conquest (Jennings 2002: 564?565). Camelids are another important resource in the valley today and are valued for their wool, meat, and ability to transport cargo (Inamura 1981). Llamas and alpacas were integral to the valleys economy throughout the colonial period, and Cotahuasinos tried vehemently to protect their pastoral lands from encroachment by Spanish elites (Trawick 2003: 59). Early Spanish documents attest that the area was known for its llama and alpaca herds, and Alca was one of only two provinces in Peru that reported during the Toledan reductions that they provided cumbi cloth to the Inca (Julien 1991: 35). The Inca may have also invested heavily in irrigation canals in the region to increase the size of bofedales, the damp mossy habi tat that is preferred by camelids on the puna (Garci laso de la Vega, lib. 5, cap. XXIV; 1985: 203 [1609]). From July of 1999 to May of2000, we directed an archaeological and geological survey of the upper Cotahuasi Valley from the town of Cotahuasi to the town of Puica (Figure 3). The selection of the bound aries of an archaeological surface survey is always ar bitrary to a degree (Jennings and Craig 2001). The 121</page><page sequence="4">?awpa Pacha 29 Figure 2. Map of metal, obsidian, and rock salt bearing zones in the Cotahuasi Valley. basic highland vertical economy of camelid herding in the high puna and agriculture on the valley flanks leads to the formation of settlement systems that stretch over both large areas and steep topography (Brush 1977). Although we recognize the importance of the puna, we limited our survey to the upper ex treme of agriculture settlements (4,000 meters) for logistical reasons. The severe topography also pre cluded full coverage survey within our survey bound aries. Instead, we devised a judgmental sampling strat egy that incorporated local knowledge of site loca tion and basic topographic criteria (Jennings 2002: 162-164). This strategy allowed us to record all of the major sites in the Cotahuasi Valley, such as vil lages and ceremonial sites. Some smaller sites, such as small tomb clusters, isolated lithic scatters, and offering deposits were likely missed. The Late Intermediate Period Despite the antiquity of exchange of the region s geo logic resources, Cotahuasi s material culture changed very little during the Early Horizon and Early Inter mediate Period (900 b.c.-a.d. 600) (Jennings 2002: 265-277). In the Middle Horizon (a.D. 600-1000), 122</page><page sequence="5">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi Figure 3. Map of the Cotahuasi Valley with our survey boundaries marked in bold and modern towns indicated. The dashed line running through the valley is the probable route of the Inca road with the solid portions of that line indicating areas where the road was stilHntact at the time of our survey. Wari influence on local ceramics, textiles, and archi tecture was pervasive, but there is no strong evidence for direct Wari control over the Cotahuasi Valley dur ing this period. Nonetheless, the Middle Horizon was a period of great change in the valley?population increased, trade networks widened, and status dif ferences became more pronounced (Jennings 2006). During the Late Intermediate Period (a.D. 1000 1476), the collapse of the Wari state appears to have had few repercussions on these new trajectories. Cotahuasi s population continued to increase in size, to solidify exchange relations outside of the region, and to become increasingly centralized. Settlement Patterns During the Middle Horizon, there were eighteen vil lages spread out across the survey area (Jennings 2006: 360-361). Many of these villages, for example Tulla (CO-23), Marcapampa (CO-22), and Ancient Alca (CO-2), almost doubled in size by the Late Interme diate Period, and two new villages, Huarhata (CO 123</page><page sequence="6">?awpa Pacha 29 19) and Pukullay (CO-57), were created (Jennings 2002: 195). A few cemeteries and ritual sites clus tered around these villages (Figure 4). The two new villages brought into cultivation the last of the underutilized agricultural lands in the side valley of the Rio Chococo, and agricultural terracing may have increased throughout the valley at this time (Jennings 2002:195). Only two of the sites were fortified (CO 33 and CO-57), although most were found on ridges, promontories, or steep terrain. While these latter sites were clearly defensible, we argue that these locations were probably chosen to protect the villages from landslides (e.g., Bode 1990). Since villages were placed on slopes, houses were often built in rows along domestic terraces. In most cases, two to four houses were clustered around a central patio, and each cluster was sometimes separated from another by a low-lying wall. Although square or rectangular structures were the most common, builders also con structed a variety of irregularly shaped polygonal build ings. Circular or ovoid buildings were rare (Figure 5) (Jennings 2002: 196-197). Architectural elements Figure 4. Late Intermediate Period settlement patterns. Our survey boundaries are outlined in bold. 124</page><page sequence="7">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi and site layout changed little between the Middle Horizon and the Late Intermediate Period and, in broad stroke, are similar to those found throughout the sierra of Arequipa during this period (e.g., Neira Avenda?o 1990; Wernke 2003).

Political Centralization Evidence for village level social stratification can be found in both domestic and funerary contexts. Each well-preserved village had a group of buildings that can be distinguished by their size and architectural elaboration from the rest of the site (Jennings 2002: 197, Appendix). While the logistical con straints of working in the valley did not allow us to map large portions of sites, we did observe that buildings on high ground and/or around plazas tended to be larger and niches, windows, and storage deposits were much more common in these houses. The architecture of the buildings, their or ganization into patio groups, and the as sociated surface scatter of domestic wares suggest that the structures were the remains of elite houses (Jennings 2002: appendix). In cemeteries, a comparison of tombs in dicates that there were clear status distinc tions. Some tombs are larger, better con structed, and contain more architectural embellishments (such as plaster, paint, and niches). Although looted, we also have ar tifactual evidence from tombs that some groups had differential access to prestige goods such as lapis lazuli, polychrome cot ton textiles, and imported ceramics (Jen nings 2002: appendix). Despite the probable existence of vil lage elite, we have no evidence for strong political centralization beyond the village level during the Late Intermediate Period. Significant differences in political power among sites, as reflected in access to pres tige goods, administrative architecture, elite structures, and craft specialization, did not exist. Although there is some variation in site size, the convexity of the site rank curve for this period also suggests that there was little political centralization at the valley level (Figure 6) (e.g., Johnson 1982). While elites were emerging at the village level, we have no evidence that the villages were bound together into a cohesive political unit. 125</page><page sequence="8">?awpa Pacha 29 Ritual Sites During the Late Intermediate Period, there were two locations in the survey that were likely important ritual sites, Ancient Alca (CO-2) and Cahuana (CO 6) (see Figure 4). (See Jennings 2003b for a more extensive description of the ritual landscape during the Late Intermediate Period.) Ancient Alcas size, its unique religious architecture, and the density of ritual remains found at the site, suggest that it may have been the more important of the two sites. The six hectare site was located on a fertile ledge of land over looking the modern town of Alca. Surface collec tions, substantiated through test excavations, suggest that after the Middle Horizon the site almost doubled in size as a large domestic sector grew to the south of the earlier portions of the village (Jennings 2002: 86?157). Ancient Alcas growth in the Late Interme diate Period may have been spurred by a rise in the ritual importance of the site. A long, low ridge, extensively altered by the construction of earthen platforms, dominates Ancient Alca. By the Late Intermediate Period, the people of Alca had built a series of three structures on the west ern extreme of this ridge (Figure 7). These structures, architecturally unique in the valley, would become the preeminent ceremonial places in the region. The first of the three buildings in this precinct, Temple 1 is a niched D-shaped structure that is sunken into the ground on its northern and western sides. The t e S i e LIP Sites \ Log Normal 1 Site Rank Figure 6. Rank size curve of villages occupied during the Late Intermediate Period. second niched building, located to the east of Temple 2, is also D-shaped. Niched, D-shaped structures were the diagnostic form of ceremonial architecture for the Wari Empire (Bragayrac D. 1991: 80; Cook 2001) and the imitation of this form may have lent symbolic importance to the area. In contrast to the first two buildings, Temple 3 is irregular in form with a window in the southwestern side of the temple. Looking into this window from the exterior of the temple, one would have seen an upright slab set within a low-lying circle of stones. The window of the temple was blocked by the construction of Temple 2. The upright slab and window in the building are reminiscent of examples found at Inca temples used as solar observatories (Jennings 2002: 97-99). In terspersed within the buildings on the western side of the ridge are two maquetas, stones carved to repre sent the landscape, and which may have been used in irrigation rituals (e.g., Brooks 1998: 293). No other maquetas were found in our valley survey (Jennings 2002: 95-97). The ritual importance of the sector is further evidenced by at least 14 boulder tombs that ring the southern and western sides of the ridge top on which the three structures sit (Jennings 2003b: 442). Thou sands of stone tablets can be found along the steep slopes of the ridge deposited into the ground, under rocks, and littering the surface (Jennings 2002: 101? 104). Many of the tablet contexts are disturbed from looting or erosion, although at least twenty deposits remain largely intact. In these cases, the tablets were placed in stacks of between 3 and 15 tablets under neath rocks or directly into the earth. Most of the tablets encountered were circular, often painted with red or orange concentric circles (Jennings 2002: 101? 104). At the base of the ridge, we documented three caches of stone tablets that were buried in deep hol lows underneath boulders. Each of the deposits con tained over a hundred tablets placed in layers with loose dirt covering each layer. These tablets were richly painted with multi-colored anthropomorphic and zoomorphic motifs (Figure 8). The site of Cahuana was likely the second most important ritual site found within the survey area. Modern agricultural practices have destroyed a sig nificant portion of the site, but the artifact scatter 126</page><page sequence="9">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi Sector F S1 S2 t l"_ tlBriiiXJa ^_ Modern Agricultural Fields and Artifact Scatter Sector E ^ Figure 7.

The three possible temples are labeled TI, T2, and T3, and the three Inca style structures are labeled SI, S2, and S3. 127</page><page sequence="10">?awpa Pacha 29 and wall remnants within the fields suggest that the site was close to Ancient Alca in size. Like Ancient Alca, the highest point of the site is a low ridge top. The buildings on the top of the ridge, if any existed, were destroyed by Inca renovations of this area of the site (see below). Finely decorated Middle Hori zon through Late Intermediate sherds and fragments of four painted tablets were found eroding out of the hillside underneath the highest section of the reno vated section (Plaza 3) (Jennings 2002: 476). This limited evidence suggests that at least a portion of this section could have been ritually important by as early as the Middle Horizon. The most sacred part of the site may have been a jutting peak that is found to the northwest of the renovated section. The peak, approximately 100 meters high, forms one side of 128</page><page sequence="11">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi the saddle upon which Cahuana sits. There are two reasons to believe that the peak may have been sa cred. First, local villagers consider the mountain sa cred and continue to leave offerings at this location (Jennings 2002: 477). Second, we encountered frag ments of two Late Horizon panpipes on the summit. Musical instruments were important in Andean ritu als (Olsen 2002) and only two other panpipe frag ments (of 1,341 diagnostic sherds) were collected in the valley during both survey and excavation. The discovery of sherds from three Middle Horizon and two Late Intermediate fine ware vessels on the sum mit suggests that the peak may have held ritual im portance before the Inca conquest of the valley. The Inca Conquest and Consolidation of the Cotahuasi Valley We have very little historical documentation of the Inca conquest and consolidation of the valley. The known chronicles are virtually silent regarding the Inca conquest of the Cotahuasi region. While Garci laso de la Vega refers to the conquest of the Allcas, which might be confused with the name of a local town in Cotahuasi, Alca (lib. 3, cap. IX; 1985: 106? 107 [1609]), this passage likely describes the con quest of a group closer to Cuzco, by Mayta Capac. Following the description of the fierce resistence put up by the Allcas, and their ultimate defeat by the Inca, Garcilaso very clearly states that from there the Inca went to other great provinces whose names are Taurisma, Cotahuaci [Cotahuasi], Pumatampu and Parihuanacocha. On his map of Inca conquests, John Rowe indicates that the territory was probably conquered by Topa Inca, but it is very close to regions conquered under Pachacuti s leadership (Rowe 1946: 205). Colonial period administrative documents do provide us some information. According to the Relaciones Geogr?ficas de Indias, the people of the town of Cotahuasi were given in service to the sun, and the people from Achanbi [Achombi] and Toro served as yanaconas (Acu?a 1965: 311 [1586]). The people of Alca were given in service to the Inca Pachacuti and his descendents (ibid. p. 314). This latter point suggests that the conquest of Cotahuasi took place during the reign of Pachacuti. Paul Trawick recorded oral histories of the Inca conquest during ethnographic work in the Cotahuasi Valley from 1986-1989. His informants described Alcas role in spearheading the valleys fierce resis tance to the Inca over the course of several months (Trawick 2003: 43). A similar story of the conquest is also told in the memoirs of Jos? ?larcon Porto carrero, who lived in the valley from 1931 to 1950 (1997: 20-24), and we have heard the same con quest accounts from local residents in different parts of the valley. Garcilaso's account of the Allcas' con quest, however, "differs little from the oral histories that everyone in the valley seems to know" (Trawick 2003: 43). Since Garcilaso's account is one of the most widely read within Peru, his work may be the source for the oral histories collected in the valley. Unfortunately, there is no archaeological evidence for resistance to the Inca that could be used to inde pendently confirm or deny these accounts. What is clear is that the Incas were successful in consolidat ing the valley into the empire. Cotahuasinos fought for the Inca in campaigns in Quito and elsewhere (Acu?a 1965: 311-314 [1586]) and by the time of the Spanish conquest, Cotahuasi and the other valleys in the highlands of Arequipa were among the staunch est supporters of the Incas (Hemming 1970: 247). After the conquest of the valley, the Incas main tained a strong presence in the valley and widely in fluenced local practices. The empire appears to have installed an administrative center, constructed a ma jor road, opened up new agricultural lands, placed a small group of settlers in one village, transformed another site into a ritual center that closely conformed to Inca beliefs, and, perhaps, established private es tates. Inca rule was also felt throughout the valley more indirectly. Inca style ceramics are found at most sites, and local ceramic styles were heavily influenced by the state. At least one Inca style structure was added to each village. We argue that these changes were the result of a consolidation strategy of relatively direct control in the valley that reflects Cotahuasi's impor tance as a resource zone and transportation corridor. This control likely mixed infrastructural investment, institutional penetration, and local realpolitik (see Wernke 2006a). 129</page><page sequence="12">?awpa Pacha 29 Settlement Patterns There were no significant settlement shifts during the Late Horizon. With the possible exception of the abandonment of two half-hectare sites (CO-3 and CO-36), all habitation sites continued to be occu pied during this period.1 One site, Collo ta (CO-8), was either re-occupied after its abandonment in the Middle Horizon or founded during this period (Fig ure 9). This settlement stability is somewhat surpris ing if the valley offered resistance to the Inca. Most sites in the valley are located in defensible locations, and two sites, CO-33 and CO-57, are fortified. In other regions of the Andes that offered resistance to the Incas, there is often evidence for forced resettle ment and the movement of population into and out of the region (Murra 1980: 174-178). There is no archaeological or historical evidence for such practices in the survey area. Moreover, we have no evidence for the construction of qollcas, or storehouses that could have been used to supply troops to control the area. Despite the lack of significant gross settlement pattern changes, there were changes within all sites. At least one Inca style building can be found at Figure 9. Late Horizon settlement patterns with our survey boundaries marked in bold. 130</page><page sequence="13">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi each of the well-preserved villages in the valley.2 Struc tures were determined to be Inca based on both their layout and construction details. In some cases, we identified Inca style architecture based on compari sons with Inca architectural types. At the site of Ullchulca (CO-33), for example, two buildings were constructed at the base of the steps leading up through the site s Middle Horizon fortification wall (Jennings 2002: 536) (Figure 10). The structures are one-room dwellings with tall gables that are clearly in the Inca style and are unknown in the local style (e.g., Gaspa rini and Margolies 1980: 164). In other cases, unique architectural features were used to identify Inca style buildings. A structure at the site of Tulla (CO-23), for example, contains two well-made trapezoidal niches (Jennings 2002: 521-522). Trapezoidal win dows and niches were unknown in the valley prior to the Inca conquest (Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez, 2001a: 154), only rectangular and square niches were used in earlier periods. The buildings walls have an inward batter. Relative to other structures in the valley, the corners were composed of larger, better-worked stones that were fitted together. Embellishing exte rior corners was not a local architectural feature, but was common in Inca structures (Niles 1987: 227). Despite these Inca features, the buildings did Figure 10. Inca style structure at the site of Ullchulca (CO-33). 131</page><page sequence="14">?awpa Pacha 29 not depart in other ways from local building prac tices. Traditionally, locals constructed double-faced walls, approximately 60?70 cm in width, made of fieldstones set in a mud mortar. The fieldstones were not worked and measured 20-30 centimeters on a side. Significant amounts of mortar were visible in the wall's exterior (Jennings 2002: 93-95). Inca struc tures, of course, were also often made of fieldstones in the highlands. Nonetheless, Inca walls tend to be wider, contain larger stones and expose less mortar (D'Altroy 1992: 110; Gasparini and Margolies 1980: 105; Hyslop 1990: 11-12). The similarity between the walls of Inca and local style structures in the val ley makes it likely that they were all built by local laborers. More work will need to be done in Co ta rmasi to understand in greater detail how the con struction of these buildings related to the Inca occu pation of the valley. While the buildings may reflect the imposition of imperial control over the valley's population centers, they may also be the result of the emulation of Inca building practices by local elites. Nonetheless, we can suggest that the builders of the structures had a good knowledge of Inca architec tural canons and construction techniques. The struc tures are therefore a strong indicator of the level of integration of the valley into the empire. After the buildings' construction, the structures would have been omnipresent reminders of Inca imperial power at each of the valley's villages. Inca Ceramics in the Valley We identified Inca style ceramics at each village and within most of the cemeteries from this period. These ceramics, called the "Chapi" style in the Cotahuasi ceramic sequence, are similar in form, surface treat ment, design motifs, and firing technique to Inca ceramics from Cuzco. Another style, "Huayllura," is a local ceramic style that adopted some of the vessel shapes and iconography of Inca wares. During our 1999-2000 survey and excavation in the valley, we collected and studied 1,341 diagnostic sherds. Of these, 103 sherds were in the Chapi style, and 73 were in the Huayllura style. We use the term "Chapi" instead of "Cuzco-Inca" in this article because we are unable at this time to distinguish between Inca style ceramics that may have been produced in Cuzco and those that were produced in the valley. The Chapi pieces are exceptionally well fired, extremely compact, and, unlike most Cotahuasi styles, do not have a gray core. The compact paste of Chapi style wares is distinct from others used in the valley. The paste varies in color from orange to brown. The kind and number of non-plastic inclusions are variable. Feldspar (1/16-1/4 mm), mica (1/8-1/4 mm) and and?site (1/8-1/4 mm) can be found in some examples in densities ranging from 3 to 10%. Chapi forms include open shallow bowls, plates, necked jars, aribabs, keros, and, possibly, one-handled pitchers. The pottery is all well-polished but features a variety of slip and paint treatments. Many of the fragments are completely covered in painted designs. The ceramics are decorated in a variety of geometric designs in black, white, red, orange, and, occasion ally, violet. In general, motifs are repetitive and finely executed and include straight lines, thick bands, hang ing triangles, serrate patterns, black diamonds, "hour glass" designs, crosshatched diamonds, and cross hatched bands (Figures 11 and 12). Huayllura wares are composed of a paste type that is distinct from the Chapi style. The fabric is predominately compact and contains non-plastic inclusions of mica (1/16-1/8 mm) and feldspar (1/ 8-1/3 mm) in densities ranging between 1 and 3%. The most diagnostic feature of the paste used in Huayllura wares is the high density (15?20%) of large quartz inclusions (1/4 to 1/2 mm in size). The color of the paste varies between brown and gray and the fragments appear to have been fired incompletely in an oxidizing atmosphere. Forms include open bowls, shallow plates, and necked jars. Rarely decorated, the vessels are usually slipped in dark red and often bur nished on the exterior (Figure 13). The Chapi style closely resembles imperial Inca ceramics in Cuzco and the provinces (see Julien 2004; P?rssinen and Siiri?inen 1997; Rowe 1944). The forms are Inca (Miller 2004; Rowe 1944: 48), and the motifs well-executed examples of the imperial style. The well-fired, hard, and compact paste of the sherds further separates these vessels from other Cotahuasi wares. The forms used in the Huayllura style emulate Inca examples (e.g., Rowe 1944: 47 132</page><page sequence="15">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi Black Red Cherry Red HI White or Cream I I Unpainted (red-slipped) 5 cm Figure 11. Chapi style ceramics. The aribah neck fragment was found in one of the six Inca-style tombs. 50) and the design elements and some of the forms used in the style are similar to Late Horizon styles found in other areas of Arequipa (Brooks 1998: Fig. 8.11; Cardona Rosas 1993: Figs. 26-30; Malpass and de la Vera Cruz 1990: Fig. 6; Sciscento 1989: Fig. 5.14). Nonetheless, the pastes, forms, and iconogra phy are also firmly based in local ceramic traditions (Jennings 2002). The lack of decorations, high-quartz content, and incomplete firing suggest that the Huayllura style ceramics were more utilitarian items. Both styles were found together in domestic con texts during test excavations in Ancient Alca (Jennings 2002: 134-144), and it is likely that both styles fig ured prominently in typical household ceramic as semblages of the Late Horizon in Cotahuasi. Since a few of the forms and decorations used in Chapi wares depart from imperial canons and match local ceramic traditions, we suggest that at least some of the Chapi wares may have been manufactured lo cally. The paste, therefore, could be a reflection of a 133</page><page sequence="16">?awpa Pacha 29 I I Unpainted (red-slipped) Figure 12. Chapi srvle cerai 5 cm new firing technique and/or the introduction of ce ramic specialists into the valley by the Inca. We did not, however, locate a ceramic production facility within the valley. The presence of a ceramic mold in Late Horizon architectural fill at Ancient Alca sug gests that some production could have occurred within sites (Jennings 2002: 149), but specialized production facilities that made both local and impe rial wares are common in other areas (e.g., Hayashida 1999). A more thorough examination of the varia tion of pastes, forms, and surface treatments within the Chapi style is necessary before determining if any of the vessels were imported from Cuzco. Inca Estates According to the Relaciones Geogr?ficas de Indias (Acu?a 1965: 311-314 [1586]; see also Julien 1991: 125), the residents of Alca served the Inca emperor Pachacuti and his descendents, the residents of Achombi and Toro also served the Inca, and Cotahuasi served the sun.3 Since these Inca holdings were described by the Spanish corregidor in 1586, we cannot be certain that he completely understood the affiliations of these sites in the time of the Incas (Julien 1991: 125). His assertion regarding Achombi, how ever, is supported by two documents that transcribed 134</page><page sequence="17">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi Q Cherry Red I I Unpainted (red-slipped) Figure 13.

Of the four sites, Achombi and Alca were located in our survey area, and we visited Cotahuasi regularly because it is the major town in the valley. Most of the archaeological remains of Achombi (CO-26) are buried underneath the eponymous modern village, and the remainder of the site is al most completely destroyed by modern agricultural fields and a modern cemetery. Nonetheless, ceramics from the site date from as early as the Early Horizon and almost all of the standing structures are similar in size and form to MH-LIP architecture. The only exceptional aspect of the site is a group of five well preserved buildings arranged facing a corridor. Each building has one door that opens up into a 3 5 meter room. The structures are unique for their large stone door jambs. These posts, unknown to the valley, are similar to those found in neighboring Chuqui bamba Valley (Neira Avenda?o 1990: 127). Inter pretations of the disturbed site are problematic, but the available ceramic and architectural data suggest that the site can best be thought of as a local one. The cluster of exotic structures, nonetheless, could point to a group of Chuquibambinos living in Achombi. 135</page><page sequence="18">?awpa Pacha 29 Ancient Alca, occupied from the Early to Late Horizon, is heavily overgrown with vegetation, and large portions of the site have been converted into agricultural fields (see Figure 7). Although time con straints did not allow us to clear and map the entire site, we did survey the site in order to document ar chitectural features. At least three buildings at the site were built in the Inca style. The first two are rectangular structures built next to each other on top of an artificial platform on the northeastern edge of the site. The first structure (Structure 1) measures 20 4 meters and has four large trapezoidal windows and one trapezoidal door (Figure 14). Regrettably, a test unit dug in the interior of this building found no primary deposits of diagnostic ceramics (Jennings 2002: 121-124). The building to the south, Struc ture 2, contains two trapezoidal doors and was sub divided into four compartments. The walls of the structure are too poorly preserved to tell if doors ex isted in these subdivisions. The last Inca style building, Structure 3, was built on the eastern edge of the site. Constructed near the edge of a three meter high terrace, the build ing began as a 4 6 meter rectangular structure with a square window in its western wall. The building was subsequently expanded by building two U shaped additions to the east. The easternmost part of the building is a razed circular foundation that may predate the U-shaped additions. Like the Inca style buildings at other sites, these structures appear to have been built using local construction techniques. We suggest that the three buildings' architectural embel lishments (trapezoidal doors, trapezoidal windows, and tapering fitting corners) and long rectangular form were built by locals to evoke kalUnkas, the long, rectangular halls with multiple doorways that were the architectural embodiment of Inca administration (Hyslop 1990: 18-19). The presence of these structures, along with Inca style ceramics, lends support to the assertion in the Relaciones Geogr?ficas de Indias that Alca served the Inca emperor Pachacuti and his descendents. Since the site's architecture and artifact assemblages dem onstrate a continued local occupation of the site dur ing the Late Horizon (Jennings 2002), it is likely that the residents of Ancient Alca were from the val ley. The site was one of the largest sites in the region during the Late Intermediate Period, and, if the oral histories are to be believed, had the most influence within the valley on the eve of the Inca conquest. By co-opting the residents of the site, the emperor would have not only pulled some of the most qualified Figure 14. Inca style structure at the site of Ancient Alca (CO-2). 136</page><page sequence="19">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi people in the valley into his service, but also removed these people from the indigenous political and reli gious hierarchies (see Rowe 1982: 102). Although the town of Cotahuasi was technically outside of our survey region, we spent significant time in the modern town and discovered no prehispanic artifacts or architecture there. Jose Antonio Chavez Chavez and other previous researchers also noted no archaeological remains in the town. Nonetheless, historical documents suggest that the site existed nearby (Julien 1991: 11). A possible location for the Inca-era site of Cotahuasi is Collota. The site lies on the river plain approximately three kilometers up the river from Cotahuasi. Although portions of the site were occupied during the Middle Horizon (Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez 2001a; 2001b), there is an Inca occupation of a one-hectare section of the site that was first described by Ch?vez Ch?vez (1982: 6, 173) and confirmed by our research at the site in 2005 and 2006. Six radiocarbon assays date the site to the Late Horizon, and Inca style utilitarian ceramics, fire pits, and other rubbish dumps uncovered in our ex cavations suggest that people resided at the site full time. We have no evidence for a Late Intermediate occupation at or around Collota. More work will need to be conducted in order to better understand the Inca occupation at Collota. Since the Incas often extended agriculture into lower elevations in the sierra (Denevan 2001: 144, 201; Murra 1960), it makes sense that a site dedi cated to the sun, and its corresponding fields, would be found in this area (Trawick 2003: 44). The Collota plain is "immense by local standards" (Trawick 2003: 46) and covers an area of over 200 hectares. It was the only significant area of potential agricultural land in the valley that remained unexploited by the Late Horizon. According to oral histories, soon after the Inca conquered the valley, he had his engineers and soldiers construct in two months an irrigation sys tem in Collota, as well as rebuild the canal of the nearby site of Tulla (Trawick 2003: 44-45). These oral histories were lent support in 1989, when la borers in Collota uncovered several portions of a well made canal composed of a mixture of baked lime and sand. The workers also found pottery sherds in the canal walls that were identified as Inca utilitarian wares by archaeologists Pablo de la Vera Cruz and Maximo Neira Aveda?o (Trawick 2003: 311). The location of the site, the sites excavated assemblages, and the associated Inca period canal can be used as evidence to support the suggestion that Collota was the location of the properties of the sun described in the Rebciones Geogr?ficas de Indias. Maulkallacta, a Possible Inca Administrative Center The most significant change in the region was the construction of a seven-hectare site, Maulkallacta4 (CO-12), near the present town of Puica (Figure 15). The planned Inca site sits on a high plateau in the northeastern extreme of the valley. There are excel lent views both up and down the valley from this location and the major access route out of the valley towards Cuzco runs adjacent to the site (see the sec tion on the Inca road below). Maulkallacta is very well preserved with many of its walls standing to their full heights (Figure 16). All of the ceramics found within the planned portion of the site date to the Late Horizon. House types are almost all one-room dwell ings without gables?one of the more common Inca structures (Gasparini and Margolies 1980:160). While it is possible that gables were made of adobe that is now gone, the tops of the walls are even and fin ished. Many of these houses have trapezoidal niches, windows, and doors that are built in the Inca style (Gasparini and Margolies 1980: 13) (Figure ^.Kan chas in the strict sense of the term?walled rectangu lar blocks enclosing a group of one-room dwellings? are not found at the site, but buildings at Maulkallacta cluster loosely around open patios. Such informal kanchas are not uncommon in Inca architecture (Gasparini and Margolies 1980: 186; Niles 1987: 47-50) and may be more prevalent in centers out side of Cuzco. All but one of the ceramics found at the site are Chapi style sherds (n=l6). The lone ex ception is a fragment in a local Inca style from the nearby Chuquibamba Valley. We argue that the site was an Inca administra tive center for a number of reasons. First, the most important section of the site was likely a large, open plaza in the southeastern portion of the site. Along 137</page><page sequence="20">?awpa Pacha 29 Figure 15.

Inca style wall at Maulkallacta. 139</page><page sequence="22">?awpa Pacha 29 the eastern edge of the plaza, we documented a pos sible usnu, kallanka, and six unique tombs. Usnus were sometimes stepped platforms made of stone masonry. The platform was a visible symbol of state power used by the Inca (either the emperor or a member of the nobility) as a throne, a stand for mili tary reviews, a seat of judgment, and a pulpit for rituals (Hyslop 1990: 70-72). Within Maulkallactas plaza, we documented a rubble-filled platform that had been razed to its foundations. We suggest that the platform can best be interpreted as an usnu for two reasons. First, the platforms location within the plaza is not atypical for usnus in administrative cen ters (Hyslop 1990: 74). Second, the poor preserva tion of the structure was the result of a thorough and methodical dismantling of the architecture. This de struction, in contrast to the excellent preservation of most areas of the site, is in keeping with the cam paign by Spanish priests to destroy usnus in order to eradicate idolatry (Albornoz 1967: 24 [1584]). An other possibility is that the structure was a huaca that was destroyed by the Spanish. KaUankas are great rectangular halls that often boast gabled roofs and multiple doorways along one of their longer sides (Gasparini and Margolies 1980: 196). Although kallankas are emblematic of Inca administrative sites, it remains unclear what activi ties occurred within them (Gasparini and Margolies 1980: 199-200; Hyslop 1990: 18). Maulkallactas great rectangular hall is the largest prehispanic build ing that we documented in the valley. The building measures 42 10 meters and has three doors facing the plaza Qennings 2002: 495-496). The walls of the structure are among the thickest that we recorded in the valley (approximately 90 cm). Although the eastern end of the building is preserved to a height of almost two meters, most of the building has been dismantled almost to ground level. We were unable to determine how the structure was roofed in the past. The size, design, and placement of the build ing, nonetheless, lead us to suggest that the structure was a kalhnka. Along the southern edge of the plaza at Maul kallacta, we documented the remains of 14 tombs. Eight of these tombs (six chullpas and two charnel houses) were tomb types that predated the Inca ex pansion into the valley (Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez i.p.). The six other tombs are unique to the valley (Figure 18) and these tombs are similar to examples of Inca tombs depicted in Cuzco and to tombs asso ciated with Inca ceramics in other areas of Arequipa (Guarnan Poma de Ayala, f. 290; 1980: 263 [1615]; Salomon 1995; Sobczyk 2000: 250-253). Found on top of earthen platforms faced with stones, the tombs are two- to three-storied rectangular structures mea suring two to five meters on a side. The lowest floor of the structure is below ground, with the entrance to the tomb at ground level. The roof and the floors of the structures are made out of large stone slabs. All of the tombs were looted but three Late Horizon ceramic sherds, including an aribah fragment (see Fig ure 11), were found in association with these burials. We argue that Maulkallactas architecture, settle ment design, and material assemblages demonstrate that the site was an administrative center built and Figure 18. Interior of looted platform tomb at Maulkallacta. 140</page><page sequence="23">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi maintained by the Inca Empire (see also Neira Avenda?o 1998: 39-40; Trawick 2003: 43). Inca builders may have destroyed an earlier site in order to build the center. On the northern edge of the site, there is a terraced hill (Sector A) where there is a mixture of buildings and tombs. Huayllara, Chapi, and Late Intermediate styles are found in this sector, and many of these buildings are in the local style. While Sector A could date exclusively to the Late Horizon, there is limited evidence that the planned Inca sector of the site was built on top of a previous settlement?the foundations of two rectangular struc tures disappear under the squat, stone-faced platform that forms the northern edge of the plaza in the Inca portion of the site (Jennings 2002: 498). Excavations would be needed to date the construction of these razed structures. Alca, Cahuana, and a Possible Ritual Transformation Since the Inca strove to work local traditions into official imperial cosmology (Bauer and Stanish 2001 : 244; Kolata 1997: 249; Urton 1999: 61-62), the general strategy pursued by the empire was to intro duce Inca gods, but allow, and even foster, the wor ship of ancient, local gods (Cobo, lib. 1, cap. 1; 1990: 3 [1653]; Espinoza Soriano 1997: 435; Spalding 1984: 82; Valc?rcel 1981: 77). This co-option strat egy likely has deep roots in the Andes (Schreiber 2004). Chapi style sherds, and occasionally Inca style structures, at lesser ritual sites suggest that the Incas followed this strategy in Cotahuasi in most cases (Jennings 2003b), but the valley's major ritual cen ter appears to have collapsed. With its temple precinct and the associated tab let tradition, Ancient Alca may have been the most important sacred center in the valley during the Late Intermediate Period. During the Late Horizon, how ever, the area around Ancient Alcas three temples was largely abandoned. No Inca-influenced ceramics were found in the three excavation units dug into the ridge top where the temples sat (see Figure 7) and only two percent of the ceramic sherds collected dur ing surface survey of the ridge were Inca-influenced.5 The abrupt end of the use of the temple precinct coincided with the abandonment or steep curtail ment of the offering of painted stone tablets in the area (Jennings 2003a). While tablets are found in funerary, ritual, and domestic contexts during the Late Intermediate Period, we discovered no tablets in any context dating to the Late Horizon (Jennings 2002: 359-370). The tradition, dating back in the area to at least 2000 B.c. (Kauffmann-Doig 1991), was likely fundamental to Alcas position of ritual prominence in the valley (Jennings 2003b). Despite the disuse of the temples, the site continued to be occupied during the Late Horizon and, as mentioned in the previous section, may have served the Inca Pacahacuti. Cahuana (CO-6) likely replaced Ancient Alca as the valley's major ritual center (Figure 19). Occu pied by the Early Horizon, the site likely held some ritual importance before the Inca conquest. The empire appears to have reconfigured Cahuana to project an Inca vision of religious order (see Jennings 2003b for an extensive discussion). As discussed ear lier, the most important part of the site was a saddle of land and an attached hilltop. Builders destroyed all of the structures on the saddle and replaced them with imperial style buildings (Figure 20). The qual ity of the masonry is second only to Maulkallacta. The site's landscape was transformed to reveal and highlight three red rock outcrops by constructing plazas around these outcrops (in Figure 19 the rocks are found in Plaza 1, Plaza 2, and in a smaller plaza found just to the northeast of Plaza 2), and the out crop in Plaza 2 was ringed by fieldstones set into the ground. Moreover, the Incas appear to have engaged in a massive irrigation project that likely extended and redirected the previous canals servicing the area. Unlike all other canals in the survey area, the main and side canals were made with fitted stone. The ca nal descends some six kilometers from a reservoir in the grasslands, sweeps through the site, and then runs down the saddle to feed a pampa that is heavily cul tivated today (Trawick 2003:43-44). Within the site, gurgling water rushed underneath Inca buildings on the eastern side of the saddle. The Inca also likely co opted the hilltop as well?Late Horizon ceremonies, as evidenced by Inca style panpipe fragments, were conducted on top of the peak overlooking the site. 141</page><page sequence="24">?awpa Pacha 29 \ Figure 19. Plan of the Late Horizon ceremonial sector of Cahuana (CO-6). 142</page><page sequence="25">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest of Cotahuasi fi Figure 20. Vista of Cahuana looking northwest from above Plaza 1. The canal passes underneath the structures that are above the modern trail seen on the left of this image. In sum, we argue that the empire transformed Cahuana into an important sacred site by highlight ing Cahuanas mountain peak, its rock outcrops, and its water canal. Rocks and water held enormous ritual significance in the Inca Empire (Hyslop 1990: 102 145). The people of the valley also likely held these aspects of the natural world sacred (Jennings 2003b: 447-448). But by encapsulating these features within an Inca sector, and by performing rituals at these locations, the Inca created a place of local worship that was not only mediated through the empire, but also served as commentary on what aspects of the ritual landscape were more sacred than others (Jen nings 2003b: 454-455). The Cuzco-Chala Inca Road The Inca developed an extensive system of roads to move tribute, armed forces, and information effec tively through their empire (Hyslop 1984). In Con desuyo, the Inca constructed both a transverse and a coastal road (Hyslop 1984: 265; Manrique and Cor nejo 1990: 23; von H?gen 1976: 150). John Hyslop suggests that Arequipas transverse road from Cuzco to the sea may have been symbolically one of the most important roads connecting the highlands with the coast (1984: 265). This road likely connected with the coast road at Chala, and ascended from there into the highlands via Lake Parinacochas (Hyslop 1984: 262; von H?gen 1976: 154) (see Figure 1). Victor von H?gen actually followed sections of this road by foot and low-flying airplane as it wound its way into the highlands to Lake Parinacochas (von H?gen 1955: 243-245). From the there the road probably turned eastward and passed through the Cotahuasi Valley. The remainder of the route from Cotahuasi to Cuzco can be tentatively reconstructed along what appears to be a long-standing transportation route between Cuzco and the sea (e.g., Burger et al. 1998: 143</page><page sequence="26">?awpa Pacha 29 193-194). The road likely continued northeast to the Chumbivilcas province of Cuzco, and thence north to the city of Cuzco. In Garcilaso de la Vegas account (lib. 3, cap. IX; 1985: 106-108 [1609]), he describes the Inca advancing through the provinces of Taurisma, Cotahuaci [Cotahuasi], Pumatampu, and Parihuanacocha [Parinacochas]. While Garcilaso s account should be used with caution, Hiram Bing ham appears to have followed this same route from Cotahuasi to Parinacochas in 1911 (Bingham 1922: 61?75), and the major caravan trail through the val ley extends northeast towards Cuzco and west to wards Parinacochas today (Jennings 2006: 362). The Cotahuasi-Cuzco portion of this route continues to be traveled heavily today, and the trail to Parinacochas is used to transport rock salt from the mine at Huarhua (Concha Contreras 1975:71; Inamura 1981: 70-73; Jennings 2002: 265-266; 2006: 362-363). The shortest route from Cuzco to Chala thus passes through the Cotahuasi Valley (see Figure 1). Coastal products, like dried algae and fish, have long been moved from the coast to the sierra in Arequipa (Onuki 1981: 12-15; Masuda 1981: 182-187), and this relationship is documented prehistorically in areas just to the south of Cotahuasi (Pease 1981: 194-195). From the Spanish conquest to the mid-twentieth cen tury, Cotahuasi prospered as a major stopping point for llama and burro trade caravans moving between Cuzco and the sea (Trawick 2003: 48-69). The val ley could have served a similar economic role in the Inca Empire. While no storehouses were found in the survey area, this only suggests that there was no extensive provisioning available for the military and administration. Caravans passing through the valley may not have needed locations for long-term storage. Our research in the Cotahuasi Valley identified several possible sections of prehispanic roads through out the region and we have tentatively reconstructed the route of the Inca road (see Figure 3). Typical trails in the valley are narrow (approximately one meter wide) with unmodified fieldstones used as steps in steep terrain. In contrast, some trail sections are much wider (three to five meters), have well-worn stone slab steps, and are occasionally integrated with stone lined irrigation systems. We suggest that these atypi cal sections are the remnants of ancient roads. Five such road sections are found on a trail that descends from the Inca administrative center of Maulkallacta to the modern town of Alca. This trail passes by four sites occupied during the Late Horizon (Purkaya [CO-29], Ullchulca [CO-33], Winyakmarca [CO 43], and Ancient Alca [CO-2]), before converging into the main street of modern Alca. We were un able to track the road along the river bottom, but the modern road through the valley may follow the Inca route. We reencountered what might be the Inca road again below the town of Cotahuasi, where we crossed the river four kilometers downstream. The trail from the river to Huarhua was wide, and contains sections similar to those found above Alca. This trail follows the expected route of the Cuzco-Chala road, and lo cal informants told us that the modern trail follows the remains of the Inca road. The road was not made whole cloth by the Inca. At least two of the road sections along the route from Alca to Maulkallacta were built before the agricultural terraces that clus ter around it. The four sites along the trail date as early as the Early Intermediate Period, and Middle Horizon sherds are found on the surface of agricul tural terraces that abut road sections. Since Inca re use of local road networks was common (Hyslop 1984; Schreiber 1984), the Inca road through the Cotahuasi Valley likely adapted a major pre-existing trail to imperial aims. Cotahuasi and the Inca Occupation of Highland Arequipa Inca investment in the Cotahuasi Valley was substan tial. The empire built Maulkallacta in the upper val ley, placed a major road through the canyon, and created a ceremonial center out of a local ritual site. Private estates may have been established in the val ley, and new fields around Collota may have been developed for the sun. Inca power could also be felt at every village in Cotahuasi?in both the vessels they used and in the structures they passed by every day. The archaeological evidence points to a strong im perial presence in the valley (e.g., Costin and Earle 1989; Covey 2000; D'Altroy 1992; Schreiber 1992; Stanish et al. 1997). 144</page><page sequence="27">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest ofCotahuasi Based on evidence from the better-studied Chu quibamba and Coica valleys, the Inca occupation throughout highland Condesuyo was likely similar in broad stroke to the occupation of Cotahuasi. In the Chuquibamba Valley, there were no significant shirts in settlement structure following the Inca con quest (Cardona Rosas 1993: 132; Sciscento 1989: 253). Inca style pottery is found at most villages, and the local styles were significantly influenced by im perial canons (Cardona Rosas 1993: 82; Sciscento 1989: 152-154). The empire also constructed an ad ministrative center at Itac, where an usnu, kalhnkas, a central plaza, and row of storehouses have been identified (Cardona Rosas 1993:63-70; Sciscento 1989: 210-214). The Inca presence is particularly strong on the puna between Chuquibamba and the sacred peak of Coropuna, where at least three intrusive Inca sites with kallankas are found (Meinken 2001). One of these sites, Maucallacta, contains a well-made, three-stepped usnu (Presb?tero Rodr?guez et al. 2001). The Inca occupation of the Coica Valley was similarly intensive. While Inca influence in the val ley has been documented archaeologically for decades (Neira Avenda?o 1961 ), it was long thought that local political and economic systems were left intact and that Inca investment in the area consisted primarily of a single ritual site in the lower valley near Cabana conde (Brooks 1998: 90; Vera Cruz 1988: 127-130; 1989: 122). Recent work, however, by Miriam Doutriaux (2002, 2004) and Steven Wernke (2003, 2006a, 2006b) demonstrate that the empire was more intrusive in Coica than previously conceived. Al though their data agree with earlier work that sug gested that the settlement system remained largely intact (Doutriaux 2004: 256-259; Wernke 2006b: 184), the architecture and layout of these sites are hybrids of local and imperial styles (Wernke 2006a: 203; 2006b: 186-187). In addition to the Cabana conde ritual site, the Incas also established two ad ministrative centers at Yanque and Antisana that con tain cut stone masonry (Doutriaux 2004:269; Wernke 2006b: 186), as well as at least one secondary center at the site of Kallimarca (Doutriaux 2004: 256-259). Inca investment in the puna was similarly intense, and, according to Wernke (2003: 182-195), may be related to Inca efforts to increase camelid production. The consolidation methods used in the Cota huasi Valley may have been part of a general Inca strategy pursued in highland Condesuyo in order to both increase camelid production and to control the important sacred peaks that stretch across the suyu. We suggest, however, that much of the explanation for the similarity between the Inca occupation of the Cotahuasi, Chuquibamba, and Coica valleys likely rests in their shared circumstances of being politi cally fragmented, rich resource zones relatively close to Cuzco. These shared general circumstances elic ited similar strategies of Inca statecraft (see Schreiber 1992: 68-70). In the case of Cotahuasi, we argue that imperial practices were guided in part by the valleys natural resources, geographic position, and low level of political centralization. The valley contained abundant mineral, pasto ral, and agricultural resources. We know that ninety percent of the tribute assessed from the valley during Toledo's early Spanish administration came from metals mined locally (Julien 1991: 32-33), and that obsidian from the valley was the most commonly used obsidian in the Cuzco region during the Late Horizon (Burger et al. 2000: 344). Cotahuasi also offered valuable agricultural and pastoral lands that were exploited by the Incas (Julien 1991: 21-35). We argue that the empire required a built infrastructure and a strong penetration of local sites to assure the flow of these resources out of the valley. If goods were flowing out of the valley, the lack of storehouses in the survey area, as well as in the Coica Valley, is puz zling. Qollcas could have been located outside of our survey boundaries or storage facilities may have been used that left a less robust archaeological signature. The valley was a resting point along the quick est natural corridor from Cuzco to the sea. By more intensively occupying the valley and running a road through this corridor, we argue that the Inca could more easily control the flow of goods between the sierra and the coast (e.g., Masuda 1985), monitor the export of Cotahuasi s geological, agricultural, and camelid resources, make a display of power that was visible to traders and other travelers that passed through the area, and increase the speed of imperial information and personnel. Roads were essential to state governance (Hyslop 1994). If the Condesuyo road 145</page><page sequence="28">?awpa Pacha 29 ran through Cotahuasi, then a steady stream of traffic likely passed through the valley. A strong Inca pres ence in Cotahuasi would have resulted from the prag matic needs of serving and controlling this traffic. Since there was a low degree of political cen tralization in the valley at the time of the Inca con quest, there was no preexisting administrative site to co-opt (see Schreiber 1992: 22?24). While Ancient Alca might have been elevated to an apex position due to its religious stature, the Inca emperor decided instead to co-opt the residents of the town. Through this action, the Inca ostensibly removed the site and its leaders from local politics. The dampening of An cient Alcas sacred power was just one part of an overarching strategy to fragment all potential valley wide political structures. Oral histories from the val ley suggest that the Inca played communities against each other through gift-giving (Trawick 2003: 44), and the use of Chapi ceramics and Inca style archi tecture at all villages suggests complicity with the Incas by a broad spectrum of local elites. The Inca may have further disrupted the valley's political structure by co-opting certain villages for his or the sun's ser vice, perhaps moving foreigners into the valley, and opening up fertile lands in Collota. These actions likely allowed the Inca to more firmly establish Maul kallacta as the administrative center for the region. The Inca conquest of the Cotahuasi Valley led to the construction of an Inca administrative center, a road, and a ceremonial center. Imperial ceramic and architectural styles were also introduced into vil lages, and some Cotahuasinos found themselves per haps with new foreign neighbors or with their own status transformed. These actions assured a constant imperial presence in all aspects of Cotahuasi society. Cotahuasinos feasted at the Inca administrative cen ter, used Inca jars, gazed on the Inca road from their fields, and conducted rituals at a site transformed by the Inca. We argue that the valley's natural resources, geographic position, and lack of political centraliza tion led to substantial imperial investment into the region. Chuquibamba, Coica, and perhaps other val leys of highland Condesuyos were consolidated in a broadly similar manner because they shared these basic characteristics. The success of this consolida tion strategy is reflected in the region's role as one of the stauncher allies of the Inca when the empire faced its own invaders less than a century later. Acknowledgments We thank the people of Cotahuasi for both their hospitality and for their stories of the past. We also thank the members of the project: Clarence Bodmer, Forrest Cook, Michael Hendrik, Kelly Knudson, Klarissa Morena, Gregory Mazzeo, Cecilia Que quezana Lucano, and Hendrik Van Gijseghem. Our thanks go to Amelia Arg?elles Talavera and her daugh ter Fabiola for opening up their hearts and their home to us over the course of our fieldwork in the valley. Comments by Melissa Chatfield, Adrienne Rand, James Tate, Hendrik Van Gijseghem, and four anony mous reviewers were a great help to us. We thank Katharina Schreiber for her patience, expertise, and editorial eye in preparing our manuscript for publi cation. This research was done with a grant from the National Science Foundation (Award # 9903508) and with the permission of the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Cultura (Resoluci?n Directoral Nacional Nro. 977/INC). Notes 1 In general, once villages in the valley were established they were rarely abandoned. With the exception of two hamlets (CO-3 and CO-36), all of the habitation sites in the valley that contain ceramics dating from the Late Intermediate Pe riod also have Inca ceramics. Of the sites with LIP and LH ceramics, all but one (CO-19) contain ceramics from the Middle Horizon or earlier. Since we have not dated the sites using other dating methods, the dating of all sites is tenta tive. The dating of CO-3, CO-19, CO-36 is particularly prob lematic because local Late Intermediate styles often remained in use in conquered areas (see chapters in Malpass 1993). The number of sites that we documented in the survey area (n=17) is markedly lower than those reported in the area dur ing the Toledo reducciones (n=51) (Julien 1991: 7-10). For example, we documented three villages in Huanyacotas, while Luis Mejias sixteenth century report mentions seven pre-re duction sites (Julien 1991: 7). While we may have missed a few sites in the survey area, we suspect that many of the sites cited in Julien 1991 were located outside of our survey bound aries in the high grasslands. All of the names (including their orthography) reported in this paper are based on those given by informants living near the sites. Very few of the site names 146</page><page sequence="29">Jennings and Y?pez Alvarez: Inca conquest of Cotahuasi on the pre-reduction list match the names for the sites that we were given. 2 There are three village sites (CO-26, CO-27, CO-37) that contain Late Horizon ceramics but no standing architecture. The hamlets occupied during the Late Horizon that have standing architecture, such as CO-21, CO-29, and CO-39, do not contain buildings constructed in the Inca style. 3 According to the ReUciones Geogr?ficas de Indias, the inhabit ants of Alca "estaban adjudicados para Pachacuti Inga Yupanki y luego sus descendientes; y le tributaban, como agora tri butaban, ropa y dinero y ganado en gran cantidad, y hac?an sus ch?caras; y adoraban al Inga y al sol. .." (Acu?a 1965: 314 [1586]), and "los indios deste pueblo de Cotaguaci [Cota huasi] eran y estaban adjudicados al sol, y le tributaban plumas de colores y mujeres y indios galanes y de buen rostro, y le adoraban como a Dios y ofrec?an sarra y otras cosas y yerbas de comer; y los indios de Achanbi y Toro estaban sujecctos y adjudicados al inga, y les daban tributos a ellos por ser yanaconas y privados del Inga" (Acu?a 1965: 311 [1586]). 4 The spelling of Maulkallacta, as well as all other site names cited in the Cotahuasi Valley, is based on the spelling used by local inhabitants. 5 In comparison to the small percentage of Late Horizon ce ramics found on the ridgetop, 23 percent of the sherds col lected across the entire site date to this period. The site of Alca continued to be occupied during the Inca occupation of the valley and surface collections suggest that it may have even increased in size during this period. Some of the finest Inca-influenced ceramics found in the valley come from sur face collections and excavated domestic contexts in Alca (Jennings 2002: 86-157).
