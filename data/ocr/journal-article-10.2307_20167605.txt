"model spirit house" from Fiji MARC ROCHETTE Better one hour's stour than a year's peace With fat boards, bawds, wine and frail music! Bah! there's no wine like the blood's crimson! Ezra Pound, Sestina: Altaforte, 1909 Genuine or Fake? Brandishing a dead crab in front of his students, Gregory Bateson (1979: ch. 1) asked them to tell him how they could assert that what they saw before them had really once been a living creature. Attempting to understand why an object like the burekalou, alias "spirit temple" or "model spirit house/' was made in Fiji amounts to asking quite a Batesonian question: how can we assert today that once upon a time this object too was a "living" thing, that is to say, was used for cult purposes before the collapse of the traditional religion of Fiji? We shall see that the direct evidence, or what there may be of it, is rather slim, at times contradictory and, taken by itself, does not enable us to account for the object in all its cult and symbolic dimensions. In order to wend our way toward the answer proposed here, what we may call secondary evidence is of critical importance in our case. This evidence is not made up of direct observation and testimony about the use of the object in its traditional context, but of certain clues that allow us to place it in a broader category and thus to establish a cultural field of possible contexts of traditional use. In order to answer the question and attempt to advance certain comparisions and hypotheses, we shall proceed to weave a web of references and meanings around the burekalou, uncovering, little by little, its symbolic parameters and ritual. Hence, we shall not seek out information that unfortunately no longer exists, secrets consumed by the fire of time, but try to let this object speak for itself. Our twofold objective will be to detect resemblances in cult practice and culturally related objects that may compare to those of the Fijian realm, and attempt to understand the object's own intrinsic logic by comparing it to what we know of Fijian cult practices before Christianization and the colonial period. To speak in the manner of Carl Schmitz (1956), it will be a question here of seeking out "motifs" in the plastic arts similar to the Fijian burekalou, even if we have to cast our net far from Fiji, all the while remaining in the same cultural area of the Central Pacifie, where influences, borrowings, and reciprocal exchange are well documented.1 A priori, the general shape of a miniature burekalou calls to mind cult practice, since it seems to represent a very accurate replica, striking in its realism, of the traditional Fijian temples (burekalou) as they were to be seen in all the villages before the gradual christianization of the islands during the nineteenth century.2 The size of the different specimens found in 1. In the quotations, words and common names in Fijian have sometimes been updated when the original transcription facilitated understanding of the text. The original spelling has at times been retained when it transcribes the word well phonetically. I am especially indebted to various museum keepers in ethnology, who have all greatly assisted me in my research work. I would like to thank Marie-Claire Bataille-Benguigui and Christian Coiffier, Mus?e de l'Homme (Paris); Sagale Bu?dromo, Fiji Museum (Suva); Dorren Martin-Ross, Field Museum (Chicago); Alison Deeprose and Jill Hasell, The British Museum (London); Amiria Henare, Cambridge University Museum of Archeology and Anthropology; Julia Edge, Horniman Museum and Gardens (Forest Hill); and Rod Ewins (University of Tasmania). The text was translated from the French by Cozette Griffin Kremer and considerably revised by Francesco Pellizzi and Nuit Banai whose help was crucial. Any errors that may remain in this text are entirely my own. 2. There are no reports for Fiji of great autodaf?s or the massive destruction of pagan cult objects by the missionaries of the Wesleyan Society, as was the case elsewhere in Polynesia. Nonetheless, the Wesleyan missionaries instigated a veritable civil and religious war that destroyed the very heart of socio-cult organization. Basing their actions on Western conceptions of the separation of spiritual and temporal powers, they favored entente with "chiefs" (turaqa) in order to combat the "priests" (bete) of the older society and banish everything that was considered to belong to the sphere of the latter. Cult objects, which appeared close to an Occidental conception of tools, hardly corresponded to the missionary expectations of what was supposed to be a "fetiche." They were considered in a neutral way. This quite astonished the Reverend Williams, who noted that "idols" made by men of wood or stone were not the object of any particular cult: "idolatry?in the strict sense of the term?the Fijian seems to have never known; for he makes no attempt to fashion material representations of his gods" (1848:216; see also Larsson 1960:13-14). Still, Joseph Waterhouse reports that, following conversion of the great chief of Bau Seru Cakaubau and his arrival at mass on April 30, 1854, with three hundred chiefs, "On the 8th of May the temples began to be spoiled of their ornaments. One of their deities, the god of rain and fair weather, was brought in triumph to me. The Heathens from the large land predicted my death" (Waterhouse 1857:152-153). But this was not to be all, as even that which had been used in part to make these objects was to perish in the flames: "(On the) 9th?an attack was made upon a sacred forest in our vicinity. The carpenters were conveyed by water on the spot. Solemnly bowing before the great</page><page sequence="3">72 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 museums generally varies from between 60 and 70 cm for the smallest pieces to more than 120 cm in height for the largest. The pieces that we possess today, with the exception of a few examples, are of a remarkable stylistic homogeneity and rarely vary in composition. The temple is divided into three parts, including a base (yavu) on which rises the edifice itself with four square walls, and a single entryway surmounted by an immense roof. The latter is oblong and pointed, making up more than two thirds of the whole and ending in a perpendicular ridge that completes the top (fig. 24a-b). The material used to make the burekalou is invariably braided coconut husk (sinnet) approximately 3 mm in width, called magi magi in Fiji, sometimes tinted with red ochre for the ensemble of the edifice, with the exception of the corners, which were colored with a black dye. Various techniques of plaiting and netting were utilized. Depending on the needs of the construction in question, the coarse cloth (bure) was rolled and twisted on wooden or vegetal shafts (bamboo, stems of plants, etc.) just as for full-sized traditional temples or, according to other testimony, all the rafters, ridges, beams, etc., were themselves often covered in the same way. Some of the miniature burekalou resemble the well-known pictures of the great Fijian temples so strikingly that it is tempting to see them as a work of reproduction possessing a realism uncommon in Oceanian sculpture (figs. 1,12, &amp; 23).3 This fact probably led to a certain degree of caution about research on the object. Neither the academic world nor the milieu of collectors and enlightened amateurs seemed, until recently, to have devoted any particular attention to the burekalou as an exemplary witness to ancient Fijian civilization.4 The prudence which explains this lack of interest in the burekalou as a ritual object seems to hinge on the unavowed fear of finding that one is dealing with an unauthentic artifact, that is, one which was made for purely commercial purposes following contact with the West. This proposition is supported by the existence of certain pieces purposely made for Westerners and on their request. It is the case, for instance, of the handsome example held by The British Museum, which was originally ordered by the botanist Berthold Seemann in 1860-1861 for the Museum of Economic Botany at Kew. It took the Fijians six weeks of work to carry this out and Seemann wanted the piece, more than 120 cm in height, to be identical to the ancient "pagan temples" (Seemann 1862:356). It was thus not a cult object that the naturalist wished to have reproduced, but a vestige of traditional architecture. Besides, his writings on his stay in Fiji do not mention any "miniature temple" used for cult purposes.5 creator, one of the Teachers prayed aloud and besought him to prevent any evil from coming to them while they attacked 'Satan's forest/ They then felled some of the monster i ron wood trees, which have been considered sacred for ages. Some of the poor carpenters trembled very much, lest an evil spirit should kill them. They are taught by tradition, that their forefathers felled some of these trees on occasion, and then retired to rest for the night. The next day, on repairing to the spot in order to square the logs, they were surprised to find that the trees were again in their proper position, and still growing" (ibid:153). Rather than destroy these objects, it seems that the Wesleyans of Fiji preferred to sell or collect them, like the Reverend Cross who, in December of 1836, was already complaining that the Fijians were asking a high price in return for selling him their clubs (Hunt 1846:72). Williams likewise made a personal collection of cult objects that he had apparently recovered from a temple (Erskine 1853:229-230). The Wesleyan collections are now in The British Museum. 3. Following Schmitz for Oceania, I shall use the classical lexical distinction here between "plastic," referring to works made by moulding, in order to distinguish them from "sculptures," made by cutting away material (1956:113). 4. Before the important study by Larssen (1960), this was often likewise the case for anthropomorphic statuary (matakau). The great classical syntheses dealing with Oceanian art neglected the burekalou on the whole, whereas Polynesian objects made of sinnet are generally well known. Doubtless, these objects were considered as hardly demonstrative for the uninitiated public of traditional material production in Fiji. 5. Here is what Seemann reports for his voyage to Fiji as concerns cult objects and temples kept in memory of the ancestors (kalou). His description is so meticulous that it deserves to be quoted in extenso: As soon as beloved parents expire, they take their place amongst the family gods. Bures, or temples are erected to their memory, and offerings deposited either on their graves or on rudely constructed altars?mere stages, in the form of tables, the legs of which are driven in the ground, and the top of which is covered with piece of native cloth. The construction of these altars is identical with that observed by Turner in Tanna, and only differs in its inferior finish from altars formerly erected in Tahiti and in the adjacent islands. The offerings, consisting of the choicest articles of food, are left exposed to wind and weather, etc. [....] Besides their regular gods and deified spirits, the Fijians have idolized objects, such as sacred stones, trees and groves, of which I have already spoken [p. 87]; and in addition to these, certain birds, fishes, and some men, are supposed to have deities closely connected with or residing in them. He who worships the god inhabiting a certain fish or bird, must of course refrain from harming or eating it [. . . .] All Fijian temples?at least those about the coast?have a pyradimical form, and are often erected on terraced mounds, in this respect reminding us of the ancient Central American structures. We meet the same terraced mounds also in Eastern Polynesia, with which Fiji and all other groups of the South Sea share the principal features of religious belief [....] There is in most of them a shrine, where the god is supposed to descend when holding communication with the priests, and there is also a long piece of native cloth hung at one</page><page sequence="4">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 73 Figure 2. A modern-day reconstruction of a burekalou on the island of Bau, Fiji. Photograph: Marc Rochette, 1995. Likewise, the classic ethnographic monographs on Fiji never refer to such an object (Hocart, Quain, Sahlins, Thompson).6 It is true that they were written when traditional society was, at best, a distant memory among a few elderly people. The miniature burekalou were apparently quite sought after by the first collectors of Fijian objects, doubtless to the point of encouraging an artisanal industry that responded to the demand, when orders were not made directly to local craftsmen. In Suva, in 1909, on his way to a collecting expedition of Melanesian objects for the Field Museum in Chicago, Arthur Buell Lewis was able to order Fijian objects directly through the photographer, John William Waters, who traded in them in the capital. Lewis thus felt assured of being able to acquire quality pieces in a minimum amount of time (Welsch 1998:29-59). The objects found in museums are probably the result of this sort of purchase. A photograph of the inside of the home of the first governor of Fiji, Sir Arthur Gordon, shows two small burekalou in the living room among other Fijian objects?clubs, pottery, tapa mats, etc.? artistically arranged on the wall like colonial trophies. A postcard from the same period displays a miniature burekalou as a sort of symbolic witness to a disappearing form of "authentic primitivity" for the Western viewer (fig. 3)7 However, it would seem a end of the building, and from the very ceiling, which is also connected with the arrival and departure of the god invoked. The relations, however, are made by means of the spirit of the god entering the body of the priest, who, having become possessed, begins to tremble most violently, and in this excited state utter disjointed sentences, etc. (Seemann 1973 (1862):391-394). The shrine he refers to in the next-to-the-last sentence of the quotation is not described, but it is probable, since he is such an astute observer, that he would not have forgotten to mention the presence of a miniature temple in such a place, had this been the case. We must therefore take it that he doubtless saw none. Eckart von Sydow used likewise the miniature burekalou as simple model of traditional Fijian temple (cf. Sydow 1923:169). 6. In his monograph on material culture in Fiji, Tippett refers to this object as a reliquary (1968:168). In his notes on the "Waters collection" from the American Museum of Natural History, Robert H. Lowie considers its "bure model" as "of special value" but only as a model of a traditional temple or, as he put it, a "council-chamber" or "guest-house" (Lowie 1910:325 and plate VIII). Its shape is very much like the one represented in figure 3 and figure 15. Oldman considered that the "model temple" (bure) that he collected, very much like the one in the Homiman Museum (see fig. 12), was just "perfect and old" (Oldman 1943:43 and plate 68). 7. Clunie (1998:322) noticed that, in his V?lkerkunde (1887), Friedrich Ratzel had used an engraving of the miniature burekalou kept in the Linden Museum in Stuttgart to illustrate his chapter on Oceania.</page><page sequence="5">74 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 Figure 3.

Courtesy of the Fiji Museum. priori contradictory to doubt the authenticity of the burekalou objects, while Fijian clubs that have survived are regarded as authentic, even when they were no longer used to kill. The heads of lineages (turaqa), in conformity with the customs of pre-Christian times, kept them as ancestral receptacles long after the collapse of the older religious system.8 Most probably, the two pieces photographed at Governor Gordon's home are today in the possession of the Cambridge University Museum of Anthropology and Archeology. Since two out of three of these objects in the museum's holdings come from the personal collection of the former governor, and one from Baron Anatol Von H?gel, friend of the governor, we can safely assume that they were crafted between 1875 and 1880.9 The doubts that surround the making, presence, and use of this object in the traditional cult context have long obscured the possibility of its existence in the rituals of pagan Fijian society.10 In the annotated catalogue of the Fijian objects in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery Collection, Rod Ewins had no trouble in attributing, implicitly, to the miniature burekalou a status of major cult object from earlier Fijian civilization. Taking up a remark by Captain Wilkes, who sojourned six months in pagan Fiji beginning in May of 1840, Ewins sees the object as having a "divinatory" purpose: "much as the 'lightning rod' strip of white masi in the corner of the bure did as serving as 'vehicles' for the spirit" (Ewins 1982:80-82).11 Basing his reasoning on this idea, he even supposes that "small ivory gods or goddesses," generally made in Haapai (central Tongan archipelago) or in Fiji by Tongans, were put into the little temple and that the "appropriate appeasements were offered to them" (fig. 5). Furthermore, according to the same author, miniature burekalou would have been utilized during the luveniwai cults of the "children of water," poorly identified supernatural entities who, among other capacities, possessed the power to render warriors invisible during battles (?bid:82). In two of his writings on the material culture of the islands, another specialist of Fijian objects, Fergus Clunie, comes back to the problem of the miniature burekalou. He too has no doubts about their connection to earlier Fijian culture and even considers these objects among the most gripping ever produced in Fiji (Clunie 1998:323). In order to illustrate his convictions about the antiquity of 8. While doing his field work in the western area of Vanua Levu (Bua) in 1935, Buell Quain was able to observe some of these weapons among the descendants of traditional priests (befe) (Quain 1948:231 et passim). 9. This is at the very least a reasonable supposition suggested to me by Dr. Amiria Henare. See figure 1. 10. I use this term here in its strict etymological meaning (pagan from Latin paganus, from pagus, for "country, village, district") to designate the religion "of the land." 11. Wilkes, apart from having been responsible for one of the first massacres of Fijians by Westerners, brought back firsthand documents on Fijian temples (burekalou). Aside from the excavation of graves of commoners by the anthropologist Horatio Hale?the graves of chiefs remaining obviously "taboo" (cf. Joyce 2001:102-103)?a drawing reproduced in the work on the expedition, and sold throughout the world with fanciful modifications, does illustrate a taqa ceremony in front of the great temple of Levuka, which the Americans attended. See figure 25.</page><page sequence="6">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 75 Figure 4. General view of Bau ca. 1840, after Williams 1859. Note the high percentage of temples among the houses. From the collection of Marc Rochette. the miniature burekalou, he quite appropriately cites some little-known testimony from the missionary John Waterhouse who, during a tour in Somosomo (capital of the great Eastern Chieftainship of Cakaudrove) in 1841, appears to have seen one of these objects that was "the size of a dovecote" (Waterhouse in Clunie 1996:7). Still, the two studies by Clunie, due to the laconic nature of the sources, remain rather vague about the use of the object during cult practices. It is thought to have been utilized to consult the ancestors (kalou) in times of war, when the priests (befe) left the temple where they usually officiated and were to enter into contact with them outside of their frontiers, that is, in enemy territory. Like Erwin, Clunie seems to find the miniature temples kept in museums far too empty, regarding their hypothetical ritual use in pre-Christian Fiji, and he argues that, in this traditional context, the object would have sheltered the anthropomorphic figurines of ivory or wood (matakau), previously mentioned, as well as objects known as "cannibal forks" (/ culanibokola). (See figs. 6 &amp; 7.12) The author is not explicit about the reasons for these inferences (Clunie 1998:323). Doubtless, Erwin and Clunie were thinking of a statement by Theodor Kleinschmidt in the account of his expedition in the central highlands of Viti Levu in 1877-1878, an edition of which Clunie published. In this text, under the section entitled "religious beliefs," Kleinschmidt reveals that: Most revered of all objects were small twinned images, most skilfully carved from a single sperm whale's tooth. Four specimens have been collected, and all are now in the possession of high officials (. . . i.e. British colonial . . .). The whale's tooth images are brown with age and highly polished. They used to be hung up in model "bure ni kalou," skilfully constructed from coconut fibre cordage and standing roughly a meter high. These were placed in real temples. At night they were lain in a basket, supposedly to sleep. Offerings used to be hung on the hooks of the ?mages, and in the old days they are said to have spoken in thin, squeaky voices (Kleinschmidt 1984:187-188). The presence of twin figures in the burekalou documented by Kleinschmidt is made plausible by the fact that, in general, houses were specially constructed 12. Also called bulutoko, the alleged cannibal forks, as Clunie quite well understood (1986:190) were in fact used to feed persons of authority (turaqa), because contact by their hands or mouths with food made it inappropriate for consumption. To the contrary of the a prioris on this subject, the body of a cannibal victim (bokola) was not in any way "sanctified" and it was eaten by the whole of the population without any particular deference. What respect would Fijian warriors have had for a slain enemy whose body was an object of scorn (cf. Sahlins 1985:98)?</page><page sequence="7">76 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 Figure 5.

The priest usually took his place among these treasures of the fale aitu to use the Samoan term with which Douglas Oliver qualifies this general type of structure (Oliver 1989: 348).13 However, the fale aitu were not, in theory, of reduced size as were the miniature burekalou. It is also quite unlikely that it was possible to place small ivory figurines in the miniature temple, hang them up as if on real rafters and, on top of all this, add offerings (Kleinschmidt does not say explicitly what offerings he is speaking of, but all this adds up to a lot for a miniature temple).14 We must also ask?if we indeed allow that 13. In Tahiti and Tuamotu islands, a wooden box named fare oromatua, "house of the sacred bones," was used to collected the skull of lineage chiefs or priests who were to become ancestors. This object was kept in the marae (temple) (see Orliac 2002:106-111 ). 14. It is difficult to imagine agricultural or animal offerings such as sea turtles fitting into these miniature temples and set upon ivory rafters. Using Kleinschmidt, albeit without quoting him, Carl Schmitz, in his posthumous work edited by Douglas Newton, wrote that the miniature burekalou was used to give shelter to the ivory twin figures on suspension hooks. He goes as far as to imagine some unknown miniature burekalou with an ingenious double-doors entry system.

Courtesy of the Fiji Museum. one of the principal functions of the miniature temples was to serve as a shelter for small ivory figurines?just what became of the supposed utility referred to of the miniature burekalou in times of war? What of their use in divination? And why then was it necessary for these anthropomorphic figurines to sleep, and so forth? On what ethnographic observation was Kleinschmidt basing his remark to qualify these figurines as the most "divinized" objects possessed by the Fijians? In comparison with what others? Indeed, any interpretation based on the remarks of the German traveller raises more questions and any number of aporetic implications about the context of traditional utilization of the object. All evidence suggests that Kleinschmidt either interpreted on his own the use he refers to in these notes on the miniature burekalou or that he was told about it by an imaginative Fijian "informant."15 It would be risky indeed to construct a hypothesis about the use of the miniature burekalou on the basis of "testimony" as uncertain as this. George Kingsley Roth, former colonial civil servant and anthropologist of Fijian culture, to whom we owe the first study of the subject, did not engage in such conjectures. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that the "model spirit houses," as he called them, were pre Christian cult objects, while those kept in museums had been made after the conversion to Christianity (Roth 1953:406-407). According to Roth, these objects were the "reproductions of the spirit houses (burekalou:bure an unmarried man's house; /ca/ou-spirit), which were found in most villages up to the time when ancestral spirits began to be displaced by Christianity" (?bid, 406). Although Roth does not speak of any possible use of these objects before the evangelization of the islands, he does refer to a story that a Fijian of great age, from the province of Ra in the north of Viti Levu, had told him some twenty years before the publication of his article, during thel 930s: . . . that a model was kept in the spirit house by the priest and that the model was the temporary shrine of the ancestral spirit when the priest consulted it (. . .) it tallies with the belief that the spirit of the ancestor of a social unit Standing back to back represented Na Lila vatu, the two wives of the chief god worshipped in the Nadi district. It was believed that long ago the god himself gave this sculpture to an old priest, and it was kept in a miniature temple made of woven sinnet cord, which was kept in a larger temple. The miniature temple had two doors, and the object was placed so that the two female figures 'see' out" (Schmitz 1972:336). 15. Ever since Derek Freeman (1999), to whom we must always give due credit, we can no longer afford to ignore the capacity for irony that is deployed and the tricks played on unwitting ethnologists by "informants" all too often quite ready to give to the former just what they came looking for. Notwithstanding this precaution, I would in no way want to depreciate the memory of Theodor Kleinschmidt, who died, as is well known, shortly after his Fijian expedition in 1881 in New Ireland where he was, against his will, implicated in the feuds between planters and natives. The bankruptcy of the Godeffroy Museum and, subsequently, the probable loss of his archives in Dresden during the destruction of the city by the Allies during World War II do not allow us to do justice to his work and know whether he may have changed certain things in his published notes that nonetheless remain of the greatest import for understanding Fiji (cf. Clunie 1984:138-144).</page><page sequence="9">78 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 was wont to occupy a shrine from time to time. The ancestral spirit of one social unit might occupy a bird; of another an animal; or a fish; or a plant; or an inanimate object. And in each instance the shrine was regarded with due respect by all the living members of the social unit (Roth 1953:409). This testimony supports the idea of the miniature burekalou being used as an empty container and not as a sort of shelter for the objects that were supposed to receive the incarnation of the ancestor. The miniature temple should therefore be regarded as equal to the priest (bete), to an animal, or to any other inanimate object, because they all fall into the category of waqa: "reliquaries" of ancestrality. Compared to other waqa, the crafting of the sinnet temple embodied to a high degree a general characteristic of cult implements: It makes possible and regularizes the relation with the invisible world by reducing the aleatory nature of the presence of ancestrality via the intercession of an object-receptacle, a human artifice.16 These miniature temples can be considered as relating to a metaphysics of the object variously elaborated in ancient Polynesian societies: the presence of empty forms used in rites?object-receptacles widely recurrent, and somewhat obscure in their ritual purpose. In general terms, the burekalou seems to be congruent with object-containers of Polynesia: [1] the baskets (kato) of Tonga and the Lau Islands (Kaeppler 1999:42-45), [2] coconut basket from Samoa (ato' to, cf. Hiroa 1930:207-208), and [3] the receptacles of Central and Eastern Polynesia to which we Westerners recognize more obvious cultic use, such as the "sennit and feather gods" of the Cook Islands, the "soul trap" of Pukapuka (Beaglehole 1938:211; Hiroa 1944:348-350), or even the fo'o "staff god" covered with sinnet in Tahiti; as for Hawaii, the hollow basketwork head covered with the red feathers of the "god of war" kufu and the enigmatic Hawaiian wickerwork coffin (ka'ai) that was supposed to have contained the bones of King Liloa (Kaeppler 1982; Meyer 1995:573).17 The utilization of sinnet (magimagi) as material of fabrication is the second element which, beyond any direct ethnographic reference, leads us to place the miniature burekalou among the categories of cult objects. Everything made of sinnet cording possessed a powerful symbolic value. The making of magimagi was generally restricted to older men who surrounded it with a certain number of constraining codes. In reference to this material, it is most certainly appropriate to apply to Fiji what Adrienne Kaeppler noticed about the whole of Polynesia: "The fact of twisting and braiding coconut fiber was generally associated with the recitation by the priests of incantations that wove themselves into the piece during its making" (Kaeppler 1993:83). Contrary to what we might infer, magimagi was neither regarded as an ephemeral material nor considered fragile because of its vegetal origin. Roping made using this technique was practically incorruptible and was also used to construct not only the houses of chiefs or temples, but also canoes fit for the high seas (see Hocart 1929:124 131). As a material essential to all the great cultural constructions, it was exchanged in the form of giant balls that could be up to two meters in height and contain seven miles of continuous string called kava, the shape of which was sometimes "anthropomorphized" in the image of a sovereign chief (tui) with a tapa blanket that entirely covered it, to which was added a small ball of coconut fiber or a piece of carved wood that suggested a head for its massive sinnet body. We might add that the fibers of this monumental ball were quite often dyed red and black.18 The cultural constructions 16. It is well known that the word waqa designates the general class of canoes. The relation between the canoe and what it transports over the sea seems to describe quite exactly the relation between the receptacle and the ancestral being which is "embodied" (vakatolo) in the former, whatever be the nature of this receptacle: priest (bete), bird, rat, fish, or stone, it is what "embarks" (vodoka) that lends this identity. Thus, the term kalou could also designate anything that received the ancestral presence (cf. Hocart 1912:499 and 1954:29). Obviously, there must have been a typology of bearers of the kalou in relation to the status of the individuals in society and their degree of initiation into the "mysteries" of the ancestral cults, as is suggested by this confidential remark on the part of a Fijian of noble status (turaqa) to Hocart: "If a man venerates a stone, the ghost of the dead is there; they have no other kalou. Our bird was the parrot (kula), this ghost (kalou yah) entered into the parrot to join us in battle (. . .); the soul of commoners did not enter into animals" (Hocart 1912:443). 17. According to a pioneering study by Adrienne Kaeppler, in Hawai'i it was thought that by singing while braiding the 'aha (coconut fiber's cord), the virtue of the chant was caught in it and it "could function as a prayer" (Kaeppler 1982:95). Objects made of other materials such as the Maori "feather" boxes (waka huia) or the Hawaiian "divine essence receptacle" appear to respond to a related symbolic logic (Kaeppler 1993:50). In Melanesia, the use of sinnet seems to have above all concerned the making of masks such as those that are well known from the region of South Maprik, or the helmet masks of Tambunum on the Middle Sepik in Rapua-New Guinea (cf. B?hler 1962:93 and 64). 18. We know little of the symbolism of colors in the pre-Christian Fijian islands. Red, as in the whole of Polynesia, was the prerogative of persons of rank (turaqa), black being more often associated with war: warriors (bati) painted their faces black before combat (Lockerby 1982:29). One of Hocart's informants confided to him that they did the same when they were burying a relative (Hocart 1912:441).</page><page sequence="10">RochetterOn the meaning of burekalou 79 Figure 8. Offerings for the ceremonies celebrating the coronation of King Edward VII in Fiji islands, 1902.

Courtesy of the Fiji Museum. for which coconut fiber were indispensable?canoes, chiefs' houses, temples?were often made subsequent to the death of a sovereign chief, for the one-hundredth night after the closing ceremonies of mourning (vakabogidra). The construction of large canoes with double hulls for travel on the high seas (drua) was, in fact, always conceived of as being in commemoration of a deceased sovereign chief (tui). These prestigious canoes (wakatabu) were still called "the net of the dead" (lawanimate) in the Lau Islands (Hocart 1929:183). (See figs. 8 &amp; 16.)19 They were generally given the name of the deceased chief.20 This relation with the invisible which may be channeled by artifacts made of magimagi is expressed in a Tongan origin myth, one of the rare examples that deal with the subject. This tells of the heroic exploits of a "Son of the Sun," an adventurous adolescent born of the union of a high-ranking Tongan woman and the Sun, who courted her. The son, wanting to join his father, uses a canoe, the sail for which he makes out of magimagi, an unusual feat. In this way he succeeds?yet another feat?in meeting his father on the horizon line of the rising sun (freely adapted from Fison 1907:33-35, who had himself adapted this freely from an unknown storyteller). Without seeking in myths the explanation of the symbolism of an object, which they are in no way meant to provide, we can nonetheless note how, in this narrative, coconut fiber offers an excellent "vehicle" (waqa) for bringing the inhabitants 19. Indeed, the word lawanimate refers more broadly to objects "wrapped" (lawa) of sinnet and made as offerings to commemorate a dead chief. Both magimagi and wakatabu belong to this category (cf. Capell 1968:115-116). As far as I know, there is no testimony of miniature burekalou being used as offerings or commemorative objects for a dead chief (turaqa). 20. Ewins recalled that the Consul Pritchard had noticed that no other area in all Polynesia produced as much sinnet as did Fiji: "Special coconuts, niu magimagi, were (and are) cultivated for its manufacture, the nuts reaching to 40 cm or more in length. The husks of the green nuts are baked in the earth oven (lovo), then beaten out onto an anvil (drata ni magimagi) with a mallet (/ samusamu) rather like a tapa beater (. . .), 'combed' to remove debris, and the long tough fibres twisted together with the palm of the hand, often against one thigh. The cord so made is then plaited, generally with a normal three-stand plait." (Ewins 1982:83). Fergus Clunie reports another utilization of sinnet in Fiji. The constancy of association of this material with the temple (i.e. the "spirit house") is noteworthy. "The roll, dressed as a high chief, stood in his stead at the property presentations lifting the mourning, and received in the name of the dead chief the presentations of tabua whale teeth, canoes, digging sticks, mats, barkcloth and other produce offered by the assembled tribes. The kilometer of cordage in the roll, all in one continuous string, may have been used to bind the timbers of the spirit house erected on his grave. In a similar vein, a huge roll of barkcloth swathed in a long tabakau, or coconut leaf mat, was presented by the people of Vanuabalavu at the raising of the mourning for their overlord, theTui Cakau, and stood in his stead at the property presentations, the long barkcloth and tabakau apparently later forming the long train or curtain suspended from the ridgepole of the dead chief's spirit house, down which his spirit was said to flow when called to possess his priest. Presentation of this kind seem to have been widespread on Vanuabalavu, where long tabakau mats were suspended in spirit houses, a barkcloth train being more usual elsewhere in Viti. This singular use of roll or magimagi or of barkcloth to represent dead chiefs may help explain early references to coir sinnet or barkcloth wrapped 'logs,' and even?in at least one case from Viti Levu?a wooden figure enwrapped in coir sinnet, in Vitian and Tongan spirit houses" (Clunie 1986:145-146). Elsewhere in Polynesia, a fine example of covering house beams is well represented in ethnographic materials on the Cook Islands (Hiroa 1944:45-47).</page><page sequence="11">80 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 of the earth into contact with those who live in the beyond. As a sort of "conduction" material, the coconut fiber makes it possible to tame the breath/wind in order to approach what is, by definition, beyond all reach of living human beings.21 The cluster of meanings woven around the object is thus rather complex. We already know that the miniature burekalou, far from being a simple "image," or souvenir item, of the temple that was located in the ceremonial area (rara) of the village, was indeed a true miniature temple meant to be transported outside ancestral territory during military expeditions. Still, we must emphasize that, as a cult object, it possesses its own entelechy?even if it belongs within the broader framework of the cults of traditional Fijian society. It obviously cannot accomplish the same objectives as the life-size temple or any other object whose cult use was shaped by access of humans to the supernatural world of the ancestors (kalou). To a certain extent, it is identical to the temple in which rituals were carried out, but its size and the materials it was made of are singular enough to offer unprecedented ritual associations and impose constraints and limitations on its use that we must examine in order to understand the life of this object. In my opinion, it was because Ewins and Clunie did not pay sufficient attention to the autonomy of the miniature burekalou as a cult object and considered it only as a miniaturization of a temple, hence subject to similar "miniaturized" uses, that they were led, in spite of its obvious appearance, to think of it as a simple box meant to hold other objects (anthropomorphic statuettes, tapa cloth, etc.) that would receive the presence of the ancestors. It is preferable to view the miniature burekalou as a fully accomplished cult form in and of itself and not as a simple supplement to other objects. This approach allows us to examine how it provided a specific path for ritual action and how it fit into traditional representations of the world of the ancestors. The burekalou retains the memory of the temple, which it evokes and of which it is a projection within a new space: hence the painstaking reproduction of defining symbolic parameters that make up the architectonics of the temple, such as the foundation, the square base, the pointed roof, and the horizontal ridge. These elements are reactualized and given a new identity through their portable form and construction out of sinnet, a prestigious cult material for wrapping. This specific character of the burekalou object is doubtless at the origin of its unique function and, in large measure, is responsible for the confusion over its authenticity.22 However, in order to better understand the miniature burekalou in the context of the traditional Fijian world, we must now briefly examine what we know more generally of Fijian temples and consider their relations with the world of the ancestors (kalou), since the temple and its miniature version both refer to an identical cult complex and are both meant to shelter supernatural entities. The temple in the village We have just stated that the miniature burekalou was not simply "made in the image" of the temple but that it was a sui generis creation that reutilized the principal attributes of the Fijian temple. The relation between the life-size Fijian temple and the small temple of coconut husk is not that of an original to a model and still less that of an original to a copy. Rather, both are variants on an archetype meant for different uses. Their ritual functions are similar and related, but different. Thus, while they respond to common objectives each of the constructions provides solutions adapted to the 21. This propensity to use plaited coconut fiber as material for persons of authority (turaqa), chief, or priest was perceptible even far into the highlands of Viti Levu, which were subject to a less centralized and restrictive social and cult hierarchy. Aside from kava cups decorated with magimagi for their use, there was also a stool made of coconut husk reserved for the exclusive use of the priest or chief during consumption of the yaqona (Kleinschmidt 1984:174). For valuable indications about the ways of making and the symbolic implications of coconut husk work in Polynesia (or, *kafa, in proto Polynesian reconstruction) in the building of canoes, Guiot's work (1997:170-171, 341-346, 356-357) is most interesting as are Kirch and Green for their general survey of the importance of this material in "Ancestral Polynesian" societies (Kirch &amp; Green 2001:193-199). Guiot speaks of sinnet as of the "soul" of the canoe and thinks it was conceived of as the vehicle of the mana of the builders once launched (1997:356). We might also note that the Fijian word magimagi probably comes from Tonga, as does the technique for plaiting coconut husk, since in Tonga it designates a particular plaiting technique (Churchward 1959:242, 333). 22. It is true that the size of the miniature burekalou offers us a tempting hypothesis concerning the possibility of holding "Tongan" figurines made of sperm whale ivory. Various stumbling blocks appear immediately as regards this: besides the fact that this use is never mentioned in the literature and was not observed for the objects kept in museums, we might likewise wonder whether?as long as we are putting into the miniature temples the whole of cult objects and relics that we might find in the life-size temple?why not also add miniature clubs, miniature tahua, etc.? These remarks on the autonomy of the burekalou cult object also owe much to the work of Remo Guidieri on cult objects, which he qualifies as a "type" of tool, whose particularity is to escape from the hand of its maker and move on as if becoming autonomous (1999:16).</page><page sequence="12">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 81 circumstances. In this perspective, what can we say of Fijian temples and the ceremonies that took place there? The Fijian temple was without doubt the most highly accomplished cultural product of the pagan Fijian world (figs. 17, 18, &amp; 19). According to the missionary Williams, who was able to observe them on a daily basis, "all that is excellent in material or workmanship in the chiefs' houses, is seen to perfection and in unsparing profusion in the bure, or temple" (Williams 1982 (1858):84). Another reference to the presence of temples in older Fijian society is given by Captain Erskine, who had noticed the various sizes of the many temples on the island of Bau. The complexity of these temples, exterior signs of a vast cult organization with extensive ramifications, inspired his admiration: The principal feature of the town is the great "bure," or temple, which stands in an irregular square, on a basement of a few feet above the level of the ground, its roof being two or three times higher than the walls, beautifully thatched and ornamented with cocoa-nut plait, and the long external ridge-pole decorated with white cowrie shells. Many smaller temples like chapels, similarly adorned, are seen in different directions, and show a much more organized system of religous worship than among the Malayo-Polynesians (Erskine 1853:185). After all, it is perhaps one of the traits of human cultural adaptation to be able to share and practice a cult utilizing sanctuaries as different in scale as a cathedral or a simple portable altar. There was little risk that the early voyagers might confuse temples with other types of construction such as ordinary dwelling houses (vale) or even with the house reserved to chiefs (valelevu, "great house"), another major cultural landmark that was found bordering the ceremonial square (rara) near the main temple of the village, which was generally set facing it. William Carey, who was shipwrecked and spent nine years in Fiji between 1825 and 1834, also provides an excellent description of a temple that the chief of Rewa had built in honor of a great ancestor (kaloulevu), although, quite oddly, Carey believed he remembered the temple as being "perfectly round": The center of the roof went up to the very high peak, which was supported by a post in the ground. Across this peak a spar was fastened, which projected eight feet beyond the house, and was covered with small white shells, and a string of the same ten feet long was suspended from each of the spars. This was built as an offering to the Great Spirit, who had given them power over their enemies, and was placed in charge of the Umbaty (i.e., nabete, "priest"), who was supposed to frequently see and converse with the great Caloo (i.e., kalou, ancestor) (Carey 1949 [1834]:44). From a formal standpoint, the temple (bure) is distinguished from a simple house (vale), because the former is generally built on a square and not a rectangular base (figs. 9 &amp; 21). This construction closely resembles and may have originated from the ordinary dwellings of the "alveolar type" found in the mountainous regions of the center of Viti Levu known as rausina or the burenikalou (temple) of the same area.23 In this context, we might note with George K. Roth that, in these regions, dwellings were not simply called vale but were named vale vakawaqa, "house that serves as a container," and should therefore be classified in the category of waqa, which are in fact vehicles for the ancestral entities (kalou). As already mentioned for the miniature form, the pointed shape and the dimensions of the roof, capped by a highly visible horizontal ridge, easily distinguished the temple from any other construction.24 The foundations (yavu) of the temple, 23. These rausina of the center of Viti Levu also had a central post, which sometimes acquired for them the name of "centre-poled houses" (Freeman 1986:7-8). It is the shape of the roof which produced this "alveolated" effect, the base of the construction being square, and this is perhaps the reason for Carrey's error, cited above. In reference to this, it is also worthwhile to look at the descriptions and drawings of Kleinschmidt, who had already noted in this isolated and, at this time, still pagan region around 1877-1878, when it was suffering the aftermath of a brutal and devastating colonial war waged by the British and their allies from Bau: "Sadly, only a handful of the magnificient old 'burenikalou,' or temples, still stand, most of them having been burnt to their foundations and completely razed. The temples of the upper Sigatoka river, those at Lega and Matabilolevu, for instance, had particularly high mounds and a narrow stone stairway leading up to the door. Several such old 'burenikalou' have since been converted into ordinary 'bure' or new men's houses have been built atop their high mounds" (Kleinschmidt 1984:184-185). In his own time, Hocart had already seen the formal connection between the use of a square base and structure in Fijian temples and the sanctuaries of Melanesia (Hocart 1912:448; 1933:ch. 6). 24. This horizontal ridge would have been a technical necessity and not "ornamental," because Fijian carpenters could not complete the peak of the roof with bamboo (Hocart 1969:168). All the while noting this, Hocart remarked that his informants nonetheless regarded this aspect of its architecture as essential to the balance of the ensemble, beyond any technical considerations. For the rectangular dwelling houses, the horizontal ridge, smaller in this case, which was on the inside of the house was called sala, the "path" (Roth 1973:9 10) and for good reason: in the "upper" part of the house (e cake), that is, the area where the family elder's quarters were, there were pieces of cloth hung up through which the ancestors of the hearth communicated with him. This casts a new light on the presence of the ridge on the outside of the temple as a spectacular display of the sala, the path of the ancestors, when they visited the world of the living. Various methods of construction of the Fijian bure are well illustrated</page><page sequence="13">82 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 Figure 9.

Courtesy of the Biblioth?que nationale de France. reaching between 3.5 and 4.5 m in height (Roth 1953:19), were raised upon two or three levels of tamped earth covered with stones that decreased in size as the base rose.25 The size of a large traditional temple was some fifteen square meters. With regard to the lexical distinction between bure (temple) and vale (house), Hazelwood noted that the term bure was in fact short for burenisa, "a house in which unmarried men or strangers sleep; a public house or house for anyone"; he translates as "a companion, a mate, a fellow, hence a rafter of a house; a similar one" (Hazelwood, in Roth 1953:17). In other words, a bure would have denoted a communal house possessing a ridge. In connection with this, Capell (1968:20) noted that the expression tiko mai bure, "go sit down in the temple," was a figurative way of speaking of the circumcision (cili) of young men.26 Not only was the size of these constructions imposing, but there was also a considerable number of them in relation to the number of dwellings. If we are to believe the various testimonies, the island of Bau may have possessed between twenty and thirty burekalou (Derrick 1946:58; Ewins 1982:80), and some fifty households (Dumont d'Urville 1842:211 )?a ratio of one temple for every two houses (fig. 4). and commented upon from an architectural standpoint by Lehner (1995:68-77). 25. These foundations were square, rectangular or sometimes round as were the examples found by Hocart (1927:192-193; 1969:168-169) and Williams (1982:222). 26. It does pose a problem not to be able to determine clearly whether the term bure designated both common houses occupied by men and temples, as is the case in the highlands of Viti Levu (cf. Von H?gel 1990:52 et passim), or whether one of these two edifices was more ancient than the other. It nevertheless seems that, for the areas under strong cult centralization, as were the east and south of Fiji, it was the temple that on certain occasions served as the "men's house," and this is the conclusion Tippett also came to in his study of the traditional Fijian house (1968:167). Did not Dumont d'Urville, having visited the principal temple of Bau, remark that "entrance to it is open to all and every day it becomes a sort of public place where all the</page><page sequence="14">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 83 The foundation (yavu) of the temples served as graves for the chiefs and figures of authority (turaqa).27 An inhabitant of Rewa, the capital of another great chieftainship, rival to Bau, supposed that it was "in order that the chiefs miraculous power (manamana) might abide in the temple; because the words of the chief were supernaturally effective; also in order that their souls might remain there and the people pray to them and offer them kava" (Hocart n.d.:376). Moreover, this foundation, known by the name of yavunitu, played a defining role in establishing the group's relation to a founding ancestor (vu, literally "trunk," i.e. from which grew the generations of the living). Generations later, people still considered it as their place of origin (Hocart 1967:169).28 In the Tonga Islands, which were culturally and geographically near and where the forms of inhumation of nobles sometimes came from Fiji, the graves (literally, the "sky" langi) of "chiefs" (eiki) also served as cult places (McKern 1929:72; Martin 1827:2: 108-109). This little mound (yavu) on which the temple was located was the veritable center of the life of the clan that officiated there. If people had to leave this holy place because of wars, they took with them a small quantity of the temple's soil and used it to shape (veibuli) the new mound on which they would build a temple (Hocart 1969:183). These mounds can still be seen in contemporary Fiji (figs. 2 &amp; 20). Early testimony supports the idea of understanding the burekalou as the domain where the priest (befe) entered into relationship with the dead. If it was at times difficult for the first European visitors to approach the temple, a visit to the "spirit house" of the village was practically an obligatory outing. Here is what Dumont d'Urville had to say on what one found in the interior: I visited the one of the village where I am (Bau); it seems to me to be well built, if small. Inside, one finds only a few mats stretched out on the floor for the use of those who come here; but the walls are covered with offerings, thanks to the fervor of believers; these consist of lances, mats and clubs. Most often, the native people call these places Amboua (taboo, forbidden), but I do not know whether this applies to the house itself or to the corner of it which is screened by a curtain of tapa and regarded as though inhabited by the god or the inspired priest. The latter is called a befe. Further, nothing is taboo in the shelter, unless it is the mat of the 6efe placed in the corner I just mentioned (Dumont d'Urville 1842:223). This account is confirmed, for example, by the missionary Williams who noticed, in addition to the instruments described by the French navigator, a kava of magimagi (a ball of sinnet) and a miniature burekalou in the corner reserved to the priest (figs. 10 &amp; 11 ).29 We can now sum up what is known about the traditional temple: It was built on the grave of a person of high rank (turaqa) or on a mound meant to commemorate him. Its raised foundations (yavu) recall this original presence and its square shape and pointed roof, prominent in comparison with other constructions, further distinguish it. The horizontal ridge entirely covered with coconut husk that capped its roof (sala) indicated that it was visited by ancestral entities (kalou). However, it would be vain to make an inventory of the temple without going into the specific types of rites it sheltered. After all, the temple is only?as Hocart so aptly put it?a receptacle for ceremonies and can only be understood through the rituals that took place there: "To neglect an opportunity of acquainting ourselves with idle, who are numerous, come together" (Dumont d'Urville 1842:223)? For purposes of comparison, farther away in time and space but coming from a common cultural matrix, we see the inheritor of the whare tipuna or "ancestor house," the equivalent in many respects of the Fijian burekalou (Simmons 1997:15-16). Hocart (1912:447^48) thought that the temple had its origin in the "dwelling house," the "hall" (bure). 27. "They retain a great respect for the dead; the relatives of dead chiefs bury them in the 'spirit house'" (Dumont d'Urville 1842:254). 28. Vu designates the origins and the "founding ancestor" of human groups who, lost in the distant mists of genealogies, blend into the origin of all things. On the contrary, while the identity of the recent ancestors, the kalou dina, is clearly established, no special cult was devoted to the vu, its presence marked only by stelea (vatu) (cf. Hocart 1912). 29. Unfortunately, Williams is not explicit about the region in which he saw this miniature burekalou. He does assert however that: "Several spears set in the ground, or one transfixing an earthen pot, as well as one or more blanched human skulls, are not uncommonly arranged in the sacred precincts. Votive offerings, comprising a streamer or two, with a few clubs and spears, decorate the interior, while a long piece of white masi, fixed to the top, and carried down the angle of the roof so as to hang before the corner-post and lie on the floor, forms the path down which the god passes to enter the priest, and marks the holy place which few but he dare approach. If the priest is also a doctor in good practice, a number of hand-clubs, turban necklaces of flowers, and other trifles paid as fees, are accumulated in the temple. A few pieces of withered sugar-cane are often seen resting over the wall-plate." (Williams 1982:222-223). We may note, still on the subject of visits to temples by Westerners, that approaching them could sometimes be a delicate matter, as is seen in a remark by a companion of Dumont d'Urville, who does not seem to have been able to enter into the temples of Bau as easily as did his commander: "The natives who followed me did not appear very satisfied with my curious obstination and they repeated to me on several occasions 'taboo! taboo' . . . while making signs to me to go on" (Marescot in Dumont d'Urville 1842:391). We may infer from this that the temples had been cleansed before the curious were allowed to enter.</page><page sequence="15">84 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 Figure 10.

War machine If it is sometimes difficult for us today to conceive of a temple, the center of cult life, as a place in which war is fomented, we may do well to remember that Dum?zil noted the extent to which, in archaic Rome, the temple of Mars of the Capena Gate was utilized over an exceptionally long period, the cult being just as actively practiced by plebeians as by patricians (1987:216 et passim). In Fiji, the main prerogative of the burekalou was to solicit and organize military operations and then, a sign of great prestige, to shelter the cadavers of conquered enemies along with their paraphernalia and objects of war, i.e., the lances and clubs of heroes and local chiefs. It is for this reason that the Reverend Joseph Waterhouse, direct witness to the conversion of the</page><page sequence="16">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 85 Figure 11.

Courtesy of the Biblioth?que nationale de France. great chief of Bau Cakobau, qualified these temples as "an appendage of the throne of Satan" (Waterhouse 1866:370). There were reasons for this, if we are to believe his count of the number of killings associated with the temple?from which we might subtract some exaggeration on the part of the Christian propagandist, but which is difficult to evaluate in light of the lack of ethno-archaeological data on the subject. According to Waterhouse, some 350 persons were directly or indirectly killed for the construction of the main temple of Bau, including the sacrifices offered for the mound of the edifice, the vendettas and counter-vendettas brought on by the first murders, and the death of those wives who joined their husbands in death (ibid.:372). Each major symbolic element was marked by a human sacrifice during the building of the temple: When the posts of a Fijian temple, or spirit house, are erected, three, four, ten, or as many human beings as can be obtained at the time, are killed, roasted and eaten. When the white shells are adjusted on the ridge-pole, on the outside of the house, as many more meet with a similar fate. When the posts of the place for the fire at which the priests and their associates warm themselves are arranged, several others are massacred for another feast (ibid.:370). In fact, the first preparations for a war (ivalu) involved repairing dilapidated temples, cleaning altars half covered over by vegetation, and constructing new temples as propitiatory acts (isoro) for the mana of prestigious deceased chiefs that were in the care of priests (Carey 1949:44; Hocart 1954:11; Lockerby:27; Thomson 1968:88). The writings of the first half of the nineteenth century, before the instauration of missionary peace, abound with testimony to temples in constant activity. As Williams remarked at the time "Fiji is rarely free from war and its attendant evils" (1982 [1858]:43).30 30. There is but one piece of testimony from Erskine who, in July of 1827, saw that the temple of Lakeba was in a dilapidated state (1853:168).

While the ceremonies were many and varied, we can only evoke a few instances from the fragments of evidence that we possess. They sometimes involved the first yam crops (isevu) towards November-December. During this short period, called vu la i Ratumaibulu or "the month of the Lord of the Land of the Dead," all unnecessary activity and noise was forbidden, even the consumption of kava (cf. Erskine 1853:245-246; Waterhouse 1866:363). A similar practice was observed following the death of a sovereign chief (tui) when work, cult activity, and noise were also forbidden (Hocart 1929:1 79).</page><page sequence="18">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 87 figures of authority (turaqa) going to temples loaded with victuals, the sign of their allegiance (isoro) to the priests as representing the kalou on Earth. It could also involve ceremonies of preparation for combat (taqa), in which warriors filed in front of the temple; of preparation and training of the same warriors (vuniduvu) by the priest (Clunie 1977:10-11); as well as ceremonies for the return of victorious warriors (bolebole) who had to be consecrated in their new status according to the number of victims they had claimed, a process involving seclusion in the temple for several months (fig. 25). There was also the preparation of the bakola, the enemies killed whose body parts were distributed among the population in relation to their rank (cf. Sahlins 1982:133). The coming of ancestors (kalou) to Earth and into the temple, an event which manifested itself in the ecstatic trembling of the befe who received them as their "canoes" (waqa), rarely had peaceful motives.31 Here is an example of the response of a prestigious kalou, through the medium of an overwrought priest, to an attempt at conciliatory mediation between Bau and Rewa at a time when the two chieftainships were nearing war, as reported by Reverend William Cross in 1841 : I am the god of war. I only am strong and wise to fight. I can do as I please. War is that by which I amuse myself. I love it. I wish now to sport in war. War is the proper exercise of Chiefs: it becomes them. There are two things worthy of gods and of Chiefs?war and feasting. Go on. Build your walls, erect your fences. War is good: I will fight: my hand is strong, and long also; I can extend it to all lands?to Somosomo, to Tonga, to Britain, to all lands. Well, prepare your fences. The people of Vungalei (a town near Viwa) are preparing theirs. All the towns are preparing for war; but none will prevail against Bau (Hunt 1846:136).32 On returning from military expeditions, soldiers (bati) went straight to the temple where the enemy victims were distributed among the different families. If we may believe the romanticized account of the famous beachcomber "Cannibal Jack," alias William Diapea, it seems to have been difficult to return from a sortie with a prisoner (bobula, "captured alive"), which would Figure 15.

Note the absence of a "foundation" (yavu). Courtesy of the Fiji Museum. 31. This "specialization" of ancestor cults for martial rites in Fiji lead Hocart to qualify the kalou as "war spirits" (1954:11-12). Furthermore, the reliquaries consisting mainly of old war weapons, keeping them in temples was considered favorable for future wars. Here is what Hocart reported on the making of a reliquary for an ancestor: "Now the son of the deceased nobleman (turaqa) went to bring their ancient club or spear to stick it on the grave over man's head. ... As for that club which stood over the dead man's head on the grave, four nights after three or four sons (luvena) or brothers (tacina) of the man painted themselves; they decked themselves out very bravely as if apparelled for war; they bore their weapons, then they went to the grave to pull out the club to carry it to the shrine (bure); they might not meet on the way with any man till they reached the house (bure) that was its shrine. The name of the club was the soul of the dead (yah ni mate). It [the yah ni mate] was found in the various families of the noble or common clans in the several families in their several shrines (bure). . . . The name of that shrine was the burekalou, it was ministered to (qaravi) as the spirit of war (kalou ni ?valu) or spirit of sickness (i.e. that heals sickness), or spirit of plantations or fishing or animals, (i.e. hunting). It was the complement (ikuri) of the ancestral spirit (kalou vu) or great spirit (kalou levu)" (Hocart 1912:441). 32. As Wilkes noted, priests must "move themselves" (i.e. enter into a trance state upon the coming of the kalou into their bodies) in general for the following reasons: "to implore good crops of yams and taro; on going to battle; for propitious voyages; for rain; for storms, to drive boats and ships ashore in order that the natives may seize the property they are freighted with; and for the destruction of their enemies" (Wilkes 1853:90).</page><page sequence="19">88 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 Figure 16.

Back from a military expedition with a prisoner and hoping to find respite in a temple, Cannibal Jack had many a problem with a warrior named Waka (a warrior grade rather than a name, meaning he had killed many enemies). The latter apparently could not sleep, tormented as he was in his dreams by an ancestral entity demanding the life of the prisoner. Whether by real or simulated means, he finally entered into a trance, in which the ancestral entity insistently demanded the life of the bakolabobula:33 He was lifting about, and sometimes with one hand only, things which no ordinary man in his right mind could by any possibility have moved, poising at one time a heavy log of wood in the shape of a spear, threatening to dart it end on in among us all, smashing old coco-nuts into atoms on his forehead, and reducing those very hard substances to fragments by the mere clutch of his right hand, just as though they were as fragile as hens' eggs! He was answering questions while his mouth was in a foaming state. The answers to these supposed questions were more than audible to the whole of the inmates then in the temple. These answers were in this wise: "I know your Majesty delights in blood!" "Ill kill more next time for your Majesty!" "Deal easy with me this time, Saka!"?equivalent to "your Majesty" (Diapea 1928:20-21). Only by offering abundant quantities of sperm whale teeth (tabua), the most prestigious objects in the traditional exchange circuit for the priest who kept the temple in which he was sleeping, did Cannibal Jack save the life of his prisoner and soothe the wrath of the ancestor who manifested himself in such warlike fashion. 33. An untranslatable neologism, but not without paradoxical humor, since it is made up of bakola "cannibal victim" and bobula "captured alive." It seems to emphasize the absurdity of bringing back someone destined to be eaten.</page><page sequence="20">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 89 We must thus conclude that the temple was a formidable machine for producing sacrifices. It received the ancestors of persons of authority who, through the intercession of priests, asked them to go to war and to bring back other sacrificial victims: all the better to consecrate new temples. This "system" could, ideally, proceed to expand remarkably as long as no internal conflict within the nobility (turaqa) intervened to stop this frenzy of destruction/creation. It is probable that the impressive number of burekalou on an island as small as Bau, considering the density of its population, was due to the fact that it was nearing this ideal condition: was the isle not the seat of the most warlike of the Fijian chieftainships? We must now consider how this activity of the temple stands in relation to the production of a cult object like the small burekalou of coconut husk. Microcosmos In a comparative study, Lord Raglan analyzed how, in different human cultures, the temple could be considered as a microcosmos: A small image of the entire universe. In traditional societies, he noted, this presented the advantage of being able to destroy the temple at the end of the ceremonies in order to reconstruct it and hence begin a new ritual cycle conceived of as a rebirth of the world (Raglan 1964:135).34 We have just seen that Fijian temples did not escape this cyclical conception of creation and destruction providing the image of a regenerated world after the beginning of each new ritual cycle: It was each "war" (ivalu, we could just as well say "chaos"), that ensured the regeneration of the temple-microcosmos.35 Beyond these ritual uses, the very form of the burekalou?an axis suggested by the arrow-like "spire" of its roof and its inner central pillar linking the wrapped horizontal ridge (passageway of the kalou to the foundations that covered its origins vu)?indicates the presence, in the same space-time of the rite, of worlds parallel to that of the living in a harmonious cosmic totality. Now we can take up once again our initial questions: What is thus the use and specific contribution of the miniature burekalou in this context? As a reduced version of what is already a microcosmos, even if it can evoke the same referents as those associated with the temple, it cannot fulfill the same cult use because of its size. A hollow object, it is a sort of fiction made of sinnet: an envelope, a receptacle possessing the power to receive the kalou dina, "true ancestors," those whose presence is attested when they enable the success of human endeavors such as wars through the mana which they dispense to the living (cf. Hocart 1914). These are both its limits and its strength.36 Obviously, the miniature burekalou does not make it possible to carry Figure 17. Temple (bure) of Na Ututu, ca. 1840, after Williams 1859:170. From the collection of Marc Rochette. 34. Lord Raglan recalls that Latin templum was originally a word taken from the Etruscan vocabulary for divination that designated a part of the sky chosen by the priest to interpret the auguries. Later, the templum was to become an earthly sanctuary dedicated to the gods, representing the projection of this consecrated heavenly space onto the earth (Raglan 1964:137). 35. For those who might doubt the existence of a conception of war as an act of creation, let us recall to what extent this regeneration of the world through chaos occurs as a refrain throughout our literary heritage all over the world. For example, when the young Ernest J?nger speaks of his experience in the trenches of World War I, it is as if we hear an echo of Heraclitus: "It is war that makes men and times what they are. Never before has a race similar to our own entered into the arena of the Earth to empty among itself its quarreling and proclaim the master of the age (. . .) combat, the father of all things, is also our father; he it is who hammered, carved and tempered us to make of us what we are. (. . .) And if he is within us, it is because he is in all places, because it is we who shape the world and not the contrary. . . ." (J?nger 1997 [1922]:32, my italics). 36. I am thinking here of the paradox of the cult object referred to by Remo Guidieri in this pre-Socratic fashion: "The presence of the object is something other than the presence of the entity to which the object may or may not refer" (1992:97). The relation between the object and its ancestral referent could not be encompassed by the tongue in any other than a tautological way: "Instruments of evocation, they refer by their presence to a 'presence-to-be evoked'" (?bid:102).</page><page sequence="21">90 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 Figure 18. Temple (bure) of Na Tavasara, the "great war god" of Somosomo, Taveuni in 1847, after Williams 1859:174. In his journal, Williams stated that this great Bure was one of the strongest he ever saw: "I should think its walls were not less that 12 feet high, and all of vesi (a kind of Mahagony) planking, every inch of which had to be chopped out with an axe. The rough figure on the left of the entrance was cut out solid with the plank on which it appears. The interior was freely ornamented with sinnet. I have seen several dead bodies presented to the god of this house. . . . Na Tavasara's priest was one of the pleasantest old men I ever saw in Fiji. He had several shot wounds about him, and one or two bullets in the flesh. That these did not kill him he attributed to the care of his god" (Henderson (ed.) 1931:122, note 114). From the collection of Marc Rochette. out complex ceremonies that would have taken place in the temple, but it provides, as it were, a sufficient synthesis to receive the will of the kalou and enable the priests to give oracles and predictions, without necessarily having recourse to trance: It would indeed be contradictory that an ancestor should "take up a body" (vakatolo) in two "receptacles" (waqa) at the same time and to do this, far more important, outside the ancestral territory to which its manifestations were usually limited. Here, in extenso, is what probably constitutes the only testimony that has come down to us about a miniature burekalou in action. It will enable us to confirm some hypotheses and develop others: The priest at Levuka pretends to receive oracles from a miniature bure, an engine of superstition of the form represented in the figure, which he keeps behind a screen in a spirit-house. It is about four feet high; the base is about fifteen inches square; it is hollow within, has an ear on one side of it, and a mouth and nose on the other. This oracle is covered with scarlet and white seeds, about the size of a large pea, which are stuck upon it in fantastic figures with gum. To the priest this is a labour-saving machine; for, on ordinary occasions, instead of going through the performance we have described, he merely whispers in the ear of the model, and pretends to receive an answer by applying his own ear to its mouth (Wilkes 1845:89-90). It is revealing to look at this testimony after what we have recalled of the general "ritual work" (cakacaka) of Fijian priests in the temples. With regard to the shape of the burekalou described by Wilkes, if it has the general form of the miniature burekalou?resembling them in size and hollowness?it is a real oddity in not being made of sinnet. Moreover, it has decorations of red and white seeds around it and is even said to have the representation of ears and a mouth. The drawing that accompanies his description is even more explicit: one has the impression of a vague miniature temple that transforms itself into a human head to deliver, smiling, an enigmatic message (fig. 13). As always, it</page><page sequence="22">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 91 Figure 19. Great temple (bure) of Bau, Na Vata-Ni-Tawake, ca. 1840. After Williams 1859:439.

Photograph: Marc Rochette. is wise to maintain a certain caution regarding the anthropomorphic details of Wilkes's description: since the priest listened to the miniature burekalou in order to receive the words of the ancestor by holding it, presumably with the side of the single doorway against his ear, Wilkes, quite logically, inferred the presence of a mouth. His memory could then have added the ears to complete the picture. The illustration in Wilkes's book is unfortunately not sufficient testimony to affirm that a Fijian cult object ever existed in this form: the drawing was probably made according to the description given by Wilkes and not from the original. However, our prudence regarding this exceptional testimony must not lead us to reject one of its essential contributions: the existence of miniature burekalou made of other materials than coconut husk. We find one such example corresponding to Wilkes's description in the collections of The British Museum (fig. 14). All this provisionally suggests that the reductionist substantial ist preconception, which we discussed at the beginning of this presentation about the "proof" that the miniature burekalou is a cult object, can be dissavowed. It is not the burekalou's material, in this case sinnet, which is imbued with an intrinsic capacity to "receive" the supernatural or any other poorly defined spiritual influence, but rather the fact that the object represents an envelope, that is, a shape which covers and entraps at the same time (cf. note 21 above; Kaeppler 1982; Guiot 1997:356). This dissimulation, a fundamental characteristic of the cult object, makes obvious, through its form, "the delicate</page><page sequence="23">92 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 Figure 21. Village of Nabekavu, Viti Levu, ca. 1840. After Williams 1859:493. From the collection of Marc Rochette. chiasm between the visible and the invisible in the representation of the non-human or extra-human, and the necessity of rendering visible that which words can but imperfectly express" (Guidieri 1997:134). Furthermore, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that Wilkes may have seen an example of a miniature burekalou, the details of which did indeed make one think of a human head, or that he may have conceived of it?be it through a confidential remark by a Fijian befe or by his own judgment. To see in the miniature burekalou the figures of heads of which Wilkes speaks in connection with the isle of Ovalau is difficult for us, given that the examples we know of today are often only reproductions made for museums. Thus, our modern view, all the more obscured by the dearth of information we have on the cults of Fiji before the christianization of the isles, certainly prevents us from seeing what the Fijians may well have seen and what Wilkes may have seen too. In the symbolic classifications of ancient Fiji, it would be logical to compare some heads to the miniature burekalou. The head of the eldest in a family (tuaka) was considered the seat of the mana of the ancestors (kalou) whose presence he ensures among the living. What is more, his nickname is "old head" (ulumatua) because it carries the deceased generations (Hocart 1913:111-113). Hence, the head of the eldest and the miniature burekalou, differing only in the context of representation of ancestral entities, have an equivalent function. The eldest represents, above all, the presence of the ancestors of the lineage (kawa) to direct the peaceful and agricultural work of everyday life, while the burekalou of the 6efe acts in favor of wars. Similarly, the name of the ritual assessor of a sovereign chief (tui) is matanivanua, "face of the earth," which refers to the mound, the ancestral grave, from which the clan originates. Regarding the great Eastern Chieftainship of Cakaudrove, Hocart reported how this "face" stands in close relation with war: "the 'face' or 'shrine of the spirits' (mafa ni kalou), that is the clan that went first in war and at the javelin-game" (Hocart 1938:421). We may also recall that the analogy between the skull and the temple is not foreign to human classifications outside of the Oceanian area, as Ananda K. Coomaraswamy and Ren? Guenon remind us, since, in the symbolic tradition of the Far East, it is commonplace that the stupa is a representation of the human skull (Guenon 1986:247 and note 4).37 Hence, we can logically propose that the 37. The Maori of East Coast, Hawke's Bay, Urewara, and the Bay of Plenty consider that the "meeting house" is the ancestor. His head is represented by the summit (Simmons 1997:25). Gu?non also recalls that the word Golgotha means precisely a skull and that it is possible to think that the majority of tumuli, either pre- or protohistorical, may have been intentional symbols of the skull (?bid). On the other hand, nothing indicates in the Fijian sources available to us that the head of the firstborn could have been considered as a waqa as was the body of the priest or other containers that were meant to shelter a kalou. Doubtless, the relation of identity between the firstborn and the generations of the deceased was more obvious, since it was marked from the time of his birth by rites anchoring and specifying this privileged relationship.</page><page sequence="24">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 93 Figure 22. A Burenisa, "sleeping bure," or men's sleeping house, ca. 1840. After Williams 1859:64. From the collection of Marc Rochette. Figure 23.

Courtesy of the Mus?e de l'Homme, Paris. miniature burekalou may have been substitutes for the ancestral skull relics, which we know any number of Oceanian societies in Melanesia used as objects of divination. In fact, isn't what we see here a "transfiguration" of the skull relic of the clan ancestor into a man-made object7.38 In Fiji, this transformation might then have been one of the essential conditions for the centralization of cults and of the social world under the auspices of dominant families (turaqa). Such a transformation would have prevented the ritual treatment of the cadaver of a deceased relative by the families who were subject to them, thus rendering their own presence indispensable for all relations with the ancestral world (kalou).39 As Capit?n Wilkes remarked, the burekalou "engine of superstition" is a genuine "machine," to produce divination or a call to war. Just what is a machine for, if not to replace and perfect human work? Its role is either to improve upon its yield (quantitative aspect), or to make it more accurate and better adapted to the circumstances (qualitative aspect). At the beginning of the nineteenth century, an increase in frequency and duration of wars in Fiji directly contradicted the tradition of a cumbersome ritual-martial protocol, most probably to the point of having made the latter obsolete. In addition, going farther beyond ancestral territory to engage in combat strained the necessary alliance between men and the spirits of the dead who manifested themselves in the village temples. The importance of the miniature burekalou emerges, so to speak, at the crossroads of these contradictions, making it possible 38. The idea of using a model burekalou as substitute for the ancestral skull could be a variation or development of the use of a model "house" to shelter ancestral skulls or relics as it is often the case in traditional culture from Oceania. A well-known example of this are the "skull-houses" (tambuna) of Eddystone (Simbo) island in the Solomons of which Hocart gave a classical account (Hocart 1922:103-111 ). They were supposed to cure leprosy. 39. In this regard, Roth formulated the interesting and likely hypothesis according to which one of the advantages of the construction of a house on the grave of a deceased ancestor was to avoid the cannibal covetry of evil-minded neighbors! (Roth 1973:10). That is to say, to prevent the relative of the deceased from ensuring ritual treatment of the body, which made it possible to fully consecrate an ancestor (kalou).</page><page sequence="25">94 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 Figure 24a-b.

Courtesy of the Mus?e de l'Homme, Paris. not only for the befe to determine the ancestral will without resorting to trance but also to considerably reduce the protocol for access to the kalou, now possible without the actual temple, thus making the priest's activities operational even in enemy territory. In other words, the miniature burekalou is an invention that made it possible to have a portable "center of the world" from which the priest could consult the ancestor and project his power into foreign territory, thus responding to an increase in the divinatory needs of Fijian warriors during the nineteenth century. It is nothing short of a war machine, a divinatory ruse enabling them to continue to frame military action within a cult and symbolic framework that guarantees the proper functioning of the world order. At the same time, it allows the great Fijian chieftainships to maintain the basic symbols responsible for making the centralization of cults around temples one of the essential foundations of a stable hierarchical order on which the expansionist endeavors of these chieftainships were based on the eve of their conversion to Christianity. Destiny What was to be the fate of such a thing that was the synthesis of war and cult? Would it have been to die out with the priests of pagan Fijian religion, only to reappear in the form of a mercantile object commissioned by Western museums? This would hardly be an unusual case in the annals of the commodification of the world, a process to which the destiny of Oceanian cult objects testify with eloquence. However, it seems that the miniature burekalou may not have disappeared from the cult scene of Fiji until after a last desperate attempt to reestablish traditional rites under the aegis of the old priests. The burekalou object may have had a sort of second life after the fall of the traditional cults and the weakening of the priesthood that followed. In fact, the two specimens from the north of Viti Levu, bought in the capital of Fiji by A. B. Lewis in 1909 and referred to above, are accompanied by the following entry in the archives of the Field Museum:</page><page sequence="26">Rochette: On the meaning of burekalou 95 Figure 25.

It is true that these two pieces have formal characteristics all of their own, and if they vaguely resemble traditional temples, they are rather poorly executed, almost distorted representations of them, which suggests that they were made well after the large wave of conversions in the nineteenth century. While the general appearance of the edifice was still reproduced in a square shape, with prominent roof and ridge beam capping it, its foundations are curiously lacking (figs. 15 &amp; 3). It is difficult indeed to understand the reasons for this. Perhaps we must relate the lack of care with which these objects were made to the effects of the bloody repression by the British administration, which outlawed the luveniwai cults in 1887. These cults were also practiced under the names of tuaka, "immortality," kalou rere, "terrifying ancestors," and kalou vatu, "stone ancestor" (Kaplan 1989, 1995:44 50).40 The principal objective of the "children of water" ceremonies (luveniwai) that developed over the whole of the Fijian archipelago was the restoration of esoteric cults under the aegis of the befe, reappropriation of the initiation ceremonies of young men, and, if necessary, the management of warfare. In particular, this implied providing the sectarian practitioners of the cult with an indestructible body, one that would have been capable of taking up combat against the followers of the missionaries in the name of the ancestors after training and initiation practices.41 For the colonial administration, the first 40. According to Martha Kaplan on the occasion of the repression of the partisans of the bete Sadiri, a veritable priest-soldier, by the Anglo-Bauan troups in 1873, 300 persons were killed among the adherents of the pagan renaissance in addition to their chief (Kaplan 1995:44f). Elsewhere in the work of Kaplan, no reference is made to the burekalou objects in cults. This does not constitute formal proof that there were none. 41. We might recall that all these rituals already existed before colonization in order to prepare the bat? (warriors) for combat (Clunie 1977:8-12).</page><page sequence="27">96 RES 44 AUTUMN 2003 objective sign of cult activities was the construction of a "pagan" temple, the burekalou. In the context of such hostility, some priests apparently resorted once again to the miniature burekalou, that little ruse of warfare in traditional society, though this one was an insufficient intervention to reverse the flow of history.
