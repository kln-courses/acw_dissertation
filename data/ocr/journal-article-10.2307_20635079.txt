<plain_text><page sequence="1">John May is Senior Lecturer in government, University of Queensland Journalistic lateralism On Tuesday 6 November shortly after noon an inter-galactic explorer landed in Lake Burley Griffin, the scenic centre of Canberra, Australia. Since the inhabitants were preoccupied with a horse race called the Melbourne Cup the explorer was able to proceed unnoticed and unmolested to the National Library. She chose this base of operations because her physical makeup precluded oral communication and her mission was to study Earthling affairs. After learning the rudiments of written English she elected to concentrate her studies on the library's rich sample of foreign and domestic Press organs. This decision soon led her to the conclusion, among others, that Earthlings show a remarkable interest in lateral movements. As an object of Press atten tion?our alien found?lateral movements often surpass erotica, and Earthlings ascribe such movements to a strange variety of entities. On a single day in 1976, according to widely published wire-service reports, an earth creature called Portugal swung sharply to the left (or, by some accounts, to the Left). This swing resulted from leverage exerted by a Revolu tionary Council which, oddly, seems to be a component or inhabitant of a Portugal. A few months earlier on the other hand, forces called 'national elec tions' caused a New Zealand and an Australia to take right turns (in the latter case, a 'sharp' right turn). Another creature called the British Conservative Party held a conference, evidently with itself, and also shifted to the right. A Prime Minister in or of a Thailand 'tilted' in the same direction, while a Prime Minister described as a 'Canada's' moved in a direction called 'conservatism'. More recently, in the spring of '1978', a Nicaragua's Opposition commenced what a newspaper called The New York Times depicted as a 'quick left march'. 363</page><page sequence="2">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, SPRING, 1980 Such reports left our intelligent alien somewhat perplexed. She managed to discern that a ,Prime Minister is a sub-species of the Earth species homo sapiens, being distinguished from its kind by its occupancy of a political office. She accordingly grasped the physics of lateral swings, shifts, tilts and turns by such creatures, but she failed to appreciate their newsworthiness. She came to understand that Portugal, New Zealand, Australia and Thailand are names of geographic Earth entities called countries or nations or nation-states. She then could appreciate the newsworthiness of lateral shifts by such entities but she was perplexed about the physics. She incurred a like difficulty with respect to the reported lateral shifts of 'parties'. Further study of the world's Press improved our space alien's under standing. Gradually she came to understand that sundry Earth entities governments, armies, journals, union federations and individual organisms, as well as parties and nation-states?are subject to frequent motions, including forward, backward and centrist motions as well as sinister and dexter ones. These movements emanate from gains and losses experienced momentarily by units of two rival teams of Earthlings. Team members evidently are sub-species of avians, as they often are described in the mainstream news media as left wingers and right-wingers. But they also are sentient and wilful creatures, imbued with diametrically opposed attitudes concerning the proper tilt for all Earthly things, for they also are denominated as leftists and rightists. In the intensity of their lateralist passions?our space alien discerned?team members differ. Some are moderates while others are militants (also known as 'ultra-... ists' and 'far-... ists' and 'arch-... ists'). Most of the ones known as 'radicals', moreover, are leftist left-wingers while most 'hard-liners' are rightist right-wingers. Disparities of emotional intensity among co-lateralists create problems, for each camp, of co-ordination. So do disparities of climate and circumstance. These disparities generate some localised eccentricities of nomenclature. In the United States of America the respective wingers often are portrayed in the Press nominally as 'liberals' and 'conservatives'. And in English language publications emanating from, or otherwise aligned with, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the respective wingers are apt to be called socialists, communists, peace-loving nations and workers on the one hand and, on the other hand, capitalists, fascists, imperialists and bourgeois. A few players, our space alien noted, take part in the ongoing lateralist struggle without adhering to the big teams. In the news media these players are called moderates (not to be confused with moderate leftists and moderate rightists) centrists, moderate centrists or centrist moderates; there appear to be no militant centrists or centrist militants. Their efforts on behalf of upright postures and middle courses, as distinguished from what they call 'extremism', are hampered by the hostility they incur from both major camps, whose loyalists stigmatise them as 'opportunists'. Their efforts also are hampered by 364</page><page sequence="3">JOURNALISTIC LATERALISM their own emotional uncertainty: they do not know whether to think of themselves as contestants in the lateralist struggle or as umpires. As she became a more sophisticated reader our space alien discovered the value of the so-called news magazines. These journals furnish summary accounts of the ongoing lateralist struggle. Newsweek of 15 December 1975, for example, yields in just a few pages no less than twenty-three allusions to 'left' and 'right'. These illuminate events in ten Earth nations. One item deals with Australia's recent display of dexterity. Others recount the following events. In Yugoslavia Tito has imprisoned 'right-wing' nationalists and 'ultra-left' professors. In Spain Franco's 'right-wing' heirs oppose the selection of a 'moderate' Prime Minister while 'left-wingers' dislike the new regime and 'far left'-ists call for mass demonstrations of disapproval. In France the 'left' and the 'liberal-centre' have lately defended socialists in a dispute with the government. In Britain the performance of the Prime Minister has evoked criticism from 'both the right and the left'?i.e. from one Margaret Thatcher and from 'Labor left-winger Eric Heffer'. In Lebanon 'left-wing' Muslims ambushed a car, 'factions of the far left' discountenance mediation efforts, a 'leftist' member of the militia spoke to Tony Clifton, and an Ibrahim Koleilat has allied with 'eight other left-wing nationalist groups'. In Portugal a 'left wing' coup has been attempted, following by some months a 'right-wing' coup attempt. In the United States some Republican strategists contemplate a move to recruit for their party's presidential nomination a 'left-of-Reagan' candidate who is not Gerald Ford. In Earth's southern hemisphere meanwhile, Australia's 'sharp right' turn has coincided with electoral gains by 'the right wing of the Liberal-Country Party Coalition' and hence with support for Malcolm Fraser's determination 'to swing Australia rightward', and The Bulletin is a 'right-leaning' publication. Timorese who adhere to the Fretilin group are 'left-wing' while other actors, backed by an 'Indonesia', are 'rightist'. From Laos 'rightist' Cabinet ministers have fled to Thailand. In no case did our literate alien find verbiage in which Newsweek scribes justified their imputations of sinistry and dexterity to the actors and events they name, or in which they clarified their descriptive terms. This also proved to be the case with additional Newsweek remarks that the head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service is a 'hard-lining anti-Communist', that the probable next Attorney-General of Australia is 'considered a doctrinaire conservative', that Libya's government is 'radical', that two warring factions in Angola are 'anti-Communist' while another is 'Marxist', and that the Republican seekers of a 'left-of-Reagan' candidate are 'liberals and centrists'. The absence of verbiage justifying and clarifying such terminology did not, eventually, surprise our space explorer. After scanning a vast amount of newsprint?she is a speed reader and she does not require sleep?our alien 365</page><page sequence="4">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, SPRING, 1980 realised that the use of Lateralist nomenclature and related terms of description is an accepted journalistic convention and is regarded by professional journalists as being suitable for 'straight' news reportage as distinguished from interpretation or 'editorialising'. The journalists evidently assume that their Lateralist idiom is directly meaningful to their readers, is objectively descriptive of events and actors, and is descriptive of momentous events on their planet. But while grasping these points our intelligent explorer also came to discern that although journalistic allusions to right-wingers, rightists, right turns and the like are to be construed as objective, 'fair', 'straight' descriptions, they are not meant to be taken literally. This discovery, achieved only after super intelligent rumination based on the most subtle of clues, proved to be momentous. It discredited our explorer's only coherent account of Earthling affairs. Lateralist terms, she finally realised, signify not physical motions or proclivities but 'political' ones. Yet she was unable to discern from everyday journalistic usages what on Earth are the 'political' connotations of 'right-wing', 'left-wing' and like terms. In her efforts to crack the code, our space explorer occasionally felt she was on the brink of discovery. She came across a dispatch by one Garry Barker, who was billed as chief European correspondent for the leading chain of South Pacific newspapers. Mr Barker mentioned that although the 'largely Muslim' and the 'Christian' forces warring in Lebanon in 1976 were 'known' respectively as 'Leftist' and 'Rightist' combatants, these labels 'do not really bear any true relationship to our own interpretations of the words'. Eureka! Now our space visitor looked eagerly for words specifying the conventional Earthling interpretations of these crucial, everyday bits of journalese. She looked in vain. Our bemused alien chanced also to read a December 1976 issue of The Economist. Her attention was drawn to a promising title and sub-title: 'Left, right and centre. Roll up that outmoded political vocabulary. Reds, blues, golds and purples might work better'. As she read on however her hopes dwindled. According to The Economist's anonymous author the capitalised names of some political parties fail to convey accurately what these parties represent: 'the passage of time has produced conservative Radical parties (Switzerland has one today)', and 'conservatives have artfully given their parties such names as Liberal Democratic (in Japan), Moderate (in Sweden) or People's party (in Austria)'. On this showing 'conservative' means something other than 'radical' or 'liberal' or 'democratic' or 'moderate' or 'people's', and some parties are unmistakably 'conservative' regardless of how they are named officially. But The Economist did not pause to specify the respective meanings. Neither did it supply guidelines enabling observers to discern what modes of partisan behaviour disclose a 'conservative' character. 366</page><page sequence="5">JOURNALISTIC LATERALISM The reader also was left to work out the implications of Economist advice that Earthlings emulate 'the American custom of using obviously meaningless labels', namely Democratic and Republican, for parties both of which are both democratic and republican. The implication seemed to be that some labels (The Economist mentioned Whig, Tory, left, right, centre, conservative, radical, moderate, progressive, national, socialist, communist, democratic, republican, people's and extremist, plus combinations of same, some of them capitalised) are, or have at some times and places been, meaningful. But which? and of what? These questions were not addressed. And yet there was the insinuation that they are answerable. The Economist suggested that parliamentary chambers be circular in form and that 'parties, factions, groups and tendencies' be 'identified' and seated according to a colour code. Pink, red, blue, gold, green and purple would be bestowed upon group ings 'formerly known' respectively as 'left-of-centre' and 'left', 'conservative' 'Liberal' or 'liberals', 'agrarian groups' and extremists and/or radicals and/or ultras. This presupposed that the established labels mean enough to permit their systematic conversion, presumably by objective authorities such as The Economist, into appropriate hues. Our space visitor was no farther along in her quest. She was left to feel vividly her alien status. Behind the figurative lateralist terms used so incessantly to identify political actors and events must lie literal denotations so evident to Earthlings that journalists feel no need to decipher publicly the code. Finally our alien concluded that in order to understand the politics of life on Earth, she must stop reading the mainstream Press. This decision, while possibly being a sound one, was based on a misapprehension. It was based on the illusion that substantively clear and consistent meanings do underlie uses of the lateralist vernacular. When they 'describe' events in terms of leftward and rightward movements, when they 'describe' politicians as Leftists and Rightists, journalists are not giving information. They are sparing their readers and auditors the pain of receiving unwelcome information, namely that many events in the realm of politics are complex and that the implications of many events are elusive. When journalists employ lateralist terms in other words, they are pandering to the popular craving for simplicity and instant intelligibility. This craving is manifested vividly by the prominence, in domestic electoral politics, of party labels. The obligation to vote in occasional elections could impose on Earthlings a painful burden. Choosing between candidates could be painful indeed if voters felt obliged to ascertain just what policies they favour and what voting decisions are consistent with their policy preferences. They would then be confronted with a costly job of information-gathering, whose outcome might heighten rather than reduce their feelings of uncertainty. Voters simplify their electoral tasks by confining themselves to adopting, perhaps just once in a lifetime, a durable 'party' allegiance. Vicariously they 367</page><page sequence="6">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, SPRING, 1980 adhere to ghostly objects called 'the Labor Party', 'the Liberal Party', 'the National Party' and so on. The illusion that such nominal entities are real actors with distinct characters is reinforced by campaign slogans ('Vote Labor!' 'Vote Liberal!') as well as by anthropomorphic pseudo-scholarly discourses on the 'philosophies' of the respective parties. The voter readily learns how to 'vote Labor' or 'vote Liberal' or 'vote National'. And having duly fulfilled a civic obligation the voter is ready to ascribe clear meaning to election returns. The essential news is either good ('my' party won) or bad ('my' party lost); there is no other kind. Party labels however do not serve to confer intelligibility?emotional in telligibility that is?on all political events. Technological developments enable the media to record elections, rebellions, coups, alliances and other contests from localities all around the planet. The contestants do not always choose familiar names for their parties and causes. Sentimental Laborites and Liberals and Democrats and Republicans accordingly cannot instantly ascribe in telligibility (good new, bad news) to changes in the fortunes of Wafdists, Ba'athists, Janatists, Sandinistas and the like. Journalists alleviate this condition by adopting universal pseudo-descriptors. They apply these descriptors to all actors ('left-leaning', 'conservative', 'hard liner') and events ('swing to the right'). The descriptors are nonsensical. Col ours would indeed do just as well. So would letters ('alphaists gained 10 seats at the expense of betaists in yesterday's Turkish election'), or numbers ('the One forces routed the Two forces in jungle battles in Argonesia yesterday'). But these alternatives could have the vexing effect of suggesting?as does that troublesome term 'centrists'?the possibility of more than two ways (good, bad) of characterising events. This would deprive news reports of some measure of emotional intelligibility. The same thing could occur rf journalists paused to distinguish between, say, 'leftists' in Afghanistan, Argentina, Albania and Albury. Competition for audience deters journalists from engaging in more accurate, more ambiguous reportage. But competition is not the sole or even the prin cipal cause of the readiness of journalists to indulge in lateralism. Laziness is another cause. It is difficult to procure a trustworthy account of the policy implications of changes in the standings of factions in Angola or in Italy. It is much easier to tag the contestants (with little regard for how they tag themselves) as leftists and rightists. Another cause of the omnipresence of lateralist journalism is desire to exert influence. When they dispense emotionally charged labels among political actors?treating Bloggs as a left-winger and Smith as a right-winger, in tones suggesting that these labels are as objectively descriptive as saying Bloggs is a farmer and Smith is a lawyer?journalists exert no small influence on these actors' political fortunes. They cannot but know that among their readers, in unequal proportions, these pseudo-descriptions really connote 'good guy' and 368</page><page sequence="7">JOURNALISTIC LATERALISM 'bad guy'. If in the prevailing climate of opinion, 'left-winger' means 'good guy', a journalist who is friendly to Bloggs, can conscientiously identify Bloggs wing wise or can faithfully record the fact that Bloggs is 'reputed' (by unnamed authorities, citing unspecified evidence) to be a left-winger. If left-winger' for the relevant public connotes bad guy however, the journalist can help Bloggs by momentarily spurning the use of substantively vacuous lateralist tags. If 'left-winger' and 'right-winger' are terms of opprobrium moreover, the journalists can help their chosen cause by invoking lateralist terms to characterise, in the guise of simply describing, one of the parties in a dispute. This implies that the other party is 'centrist' or 'moderate' or 'non-extremist'. In the 28 May 1978 issue of The New York Times for example, John Herbers ascribes 'right-wing' proclivities to active opponents of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, while refraining to characterise active proponents in terms of the same metaphor. If professional journalists were bound by ethical canons to purge lateralist tags from all reportage delivered in the guise of straight news, then they would not be able to pander to their readers' hunger for emotional intelligibility, and politically they would be disarmed. They would not willingly surrender such a weapon. 369</page></plain_text>
