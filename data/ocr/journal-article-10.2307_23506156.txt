<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE UNITY OF GOD A Study in Hellenistic and Rabbinic Theology SAMUEL S. COHON t: Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati THE doctrine of Divine Unity climaxed the religious devel opment of the Bible. The teachings of the prophets combine with the commands of the Torah and the wisdom of the sages in affirming the monotheistic faith that the universe was called into existence by the living God, who preserves the highest heavens and sustains the earth, and directs the destinies of men and of nations. This world-embracing creed, proclaimed in the opening words of Genesis, forms the substance of the world-view of the remainder of Scripture and constitutes the foundation of the theocentric view of the Rabbis. By the side of the Creator everything else is a creature. He is the Holy One, the Lord of the universe, of humanity, of Israel and of every individual. Two biblical documents, in which this crowning achievement of Jewish theology crystallized itself, came to form the basic texts of Rabbinic Judaism: the Decalogue and the Shema. The affirmation anochi adonai elohecha ("I am the Lord thy God") of the first commandment is completed by the prohibition 10 10 yihye I'cha elohirn aherim ("Thou shalt have no other gods") of the second.1 They are the positive and negative forms of the doctrine of divine Unity. God is not truly One if there are other gods besides Him.2 No nature deities, no man or animal gods, no creation of man's mind or hand can be placed by His side. He is essentially transcendent, incomparable with anything in existence, high and exalted, eternal and holy.3 1 Ex. 20.2-3; Deut. 5.6-7. Josephus, Ant. III.5, 4 combines the two as the first commandment. So, too, R. Ishmael taught that the two were heard from God together. Hor. 8a; Mak. 23a-24b. 2 Tertullian writes; Deus si non unus est, non est■— If God is not one, He does not exist.

COHON [2] This doctrine, implicit in the Sinaitic covenant between Israel and God negated — first for Israel and subsequently for the entire world — the pantheons and the cults of antiquity. It motivated the protracted struggle against Canaanitic Baalism, the astral worship of Assyro-BabyIonia and the nature gods of Egypt. It formed the battle cry of Elijah on Mt. Carmel. The response of the assembled hosts to his challenge to choose be tween YHWH (Lord) and Baal: "The Lord, He is God; the Lord, He is God,"4 has resounded through the ages. It assumed its classical form in Deut. 6.4, "Hear, O Israel: the Lord is our God, the Lord is one." Hosea had condemned Israel's espousal of other deities as disloyalty to God and as harlotry. "I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and no other god besides Me shalt thou know, and there is no savior besides Me."5 Isaiah acknowledged Him as the author and director of the drama of world history and as the Lord of hosts (of heaven) acclaimed by the angel chorus as thrice holy.6 Jeremiah knew Him as the universal Lord of nature and of humanity, the architect who moulds the destinies of nations as a potter moulds his clay.7 "The Lord God is the true God; He is the living God, and the everlasting King." In His name the prophet defied the poly theistic cults: "Thus shall ye say unto them: 'The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.' He hath made the earth by His power, hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by His understanding."8 Deutero-Isaiah, confronted by Parsi dualism, protested in God's name: "I am the first, and I am the last, and besides Me there is no god ... I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I am the Lord that doeth all these things." As the master of all creation, He is the hope of all mankind. "Look unto Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God י I Kings 18.39. 5 Hosea 13.4. 6 Isa. 10.5 ff. ; 6.3. 7 Jer. 5.22 ff.; 16.19; 18 8 Jer. 10.10 ff., reflecting the ideas of Deutero-Isaiah.</page><page sequence="3">[3] THE UNITY OF GOD 427 and there is none else . . . unto Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Only in the Lord, shall one say of Me, is victory and strength ... In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory."9 The prophetic theology served also as a philosophy of history. For the prophets history formed a continuous whole, with the future growing out of the present and the past. The course of events moved toward a goal, not merely an "end of days" but of meaning and purpose. In their minds the popular expectation of the coming day of the Lord, when He would avenge Israel, was transformed into a day of judgment of Israel as well as of the other nations. The consequences of Israel's sinfulness would be her inescapable punishment administered by God in the course of history.10 The apocalypticists seized upon this belief as the basis for the reign of evil in the world and made it the core of their teaching. For them history is a discontinuity, with the future breaking in upon the present. When God will rise to establish His reign over the world, the power of wickedness will be crushed. The sinful nations will be brought low and God's own people will be vindicated and saved.11 God will triumph not only over the nations, but also over their gods. He will destroy death itself and wipe away the tears from all faces.12 With His exaltation, His people will be exalted. All the nations will throng to Mt. Zion to be taught of His ways and to honor His elect.13 The people, therefore, must prove themselves worthy of their God, who will be a stronghold to the poor and the needy, "a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat."14 Following the judgment and destruction of the wicked nations and their gods, "the Lord shall be King over all the earth; in that day the Lord shall be One, and His name One."15 » Isa. 44.6; 45.7, 22-23, 25. 10 Isa. 2.12-17; Amos 5.18-20.

The unwearying emphasis of the Jewish masters of post-biblical literature on this belief can be best understood in the light of the persistent attacks which it drew from anti Jewish philosophies and competing cults. In the Graeco-Roman world, the non-Jews were disturbed by the Jewish refusal to acknowledge their gods. As their states rested on community of cult-observances, they looked askance upon anything that threatened to weaken their formal structure.16 Accordingly, asebeia, impiety, was regarded a criminal offense. States like Athens took measures to rid themselves of persons like Socrates who entertained ideas about the gods contrary to those held by the state.17 The negative attitude of the Jews towards the cults of their neighbors in Egypt and in Graeco Roman cities could not but evoke resentment. Their aggressive propaganda on behalf of their own religion added fuel to the flames. However, in many instances, the Jewish congregations were by special grant immune from persecution for impiety. The attempt to abrogate their immunity and to compel their conformity to the law of asebeia ran up against the fact that the immunity was a real grant by the heads of state and was not reachable by local legislation.18 Consequently, though the Jews gained the enthusiastic approval of some of their neighbors, they did not escape the odium of others. In Egypt, in particular, the feud between the natives and the Jews had been of long stand ing. From Persian times on the Jews were identified with the foreign rulers of the land and with a form of worship radically at variance with their own. With the translation of the Torah into Greek, the reputation of the Egyptian Pharaohs was tar nished. The Egyptians retaliated by exposing the Jewish people to ridicule. The Jews were presented by the Egyptian priest 14 Max Radin, The Jews Among the Greeks and Romans, ch. XII, pp. 164 ff. " Against Apion II.37. 14 Ant.

While their writings have been lost, quotations from them are cited by Josephus in his polemic against Apion. The first of the classical writers quoted is Mnaseas, a rhetorical historian who wrote before the establishment of the Maccabean state. He tells of an Idumean named Zabidius, who duped the Jews by promising to deliver his god, Apollo, into their hands, and contrived to get into the Temple of Jerusalem and remove from there "the golden head of a pack-ass."20 This calumny reappeared in a variety of forms. It is repeated in a fragment from the writings of Apollonius Molo, a teacher of Caesar and of Cicero, and reiterated by Apion that the Jews adored the head of an ass, and worshipped it with much ceremony. He also circulated the story that Antiochus Epiphanes, on the occasion of his spoliation of the Temple, found there "a head made of gold and worth a high price."21 From Apion the libel got to Tacitus, who wrote that the Jews "consecrated an ass in their sacred shrine." He expressly avoids the allegation that the Jews worshipped the statue, thus modifying Apion's words to fit them into the then established fact, which he states, that "the Jews acknowledge one God only, and conceive of Him by the mind alone."22 The charge of ass worship was particularly vicious. In Egypt the ass was associated with Typhon, and formed an object of fear and hatred. This slander, therefore, was equivalent to charging the Jews with a kind of "devil-worship", at least of venerating a deity hostile to the Egyptians.23 '» Apion I.25. 20 Ibid. II.9. 21 Ibid. II.7, 5 Posidonius is quoted (Radin, op. cit.) to the effect that the innermost shrine of the Temple contained the statue of a long-bearded man, presumably Moses, riding on an ass. So Diodorus (XXXIV. frag.) states that Antiochus found such a statue in the Temple. The charge of ass-worship was transferred to the Christians.

COHON [6] Their imageless worship and their resolute denial of the gods of their neighbors brought upon the Jews the stigma of atheioi, "atheists" or godless. As thoroughgoing monotheists, the Jews disregarded the gods of the heathen as non-existent, or denounced them as elilim, nothings, or shedim and seirim, demons and satyrs, and as toebah, abominations.24 Molo branded them as "atheists and misanthropes."25 Lysimachus of Alexandria repeats the accu sation of misanthropy and charges that they were enjoined "to overthrow any temples and altars of the gods which they found."26 The elder Pliny denounced them as "a race famous for its insults to the gods."27 The forceful measures of Antiochus Epiphanes to win over the Jewish people to Grecian polytheism stiffened their resistance to the point of martyrdom.28 His claim to being an incarnation of Zeus aroused their abhorrence and branded him as Epimanes, the madman. Emperor-worship like the cults of dying andresur recting saviors that peopled the pantheons and cults of antiquity appeared to them as the height of blasphemy.29 In Roman times, the Jews would not so much as permit the Roman troops to enter Jewish territory with their banners which bore emblems of the Caesars. We hear of Hasidim who would not look upon a coin, because the image of Caesar was engraven upon it.30 The national revival which followed the restoration of the state under the Maccabees raised the hope of the fulfillment of the prophetic promise of the conversion of the nations to the worship of the living God.31 The apocalypticists sounded the theme of the imminence of God's judgment over the nations and the establishment of His reign over them.32 An unknown author invoked the authority of the mysterious Roman prophetess, the Sibyl, to urge the conversion of the gentiles to the worship of 24 Lev. 17.7; Deut. 32.17; Ps. 106.37; II Chron. 11.15. 23 Apion II.14, 148. 26 Apion I.34. 2' Hist.

In the name of the sovereign and incorruptible Creator, the Eternal, dwelling on high, who rewards the good and punishes the evil, the Sibyl thundered against the folly of idolatry and the viciousness of immorality. "Be ashamed of making gods of serpents, dogs and cats; ye reverence winged creatures and animals that creep on the earth, and images of stone and statues made with hands, and stones piled together by the roads." Divine judgment will come upon the wicked nations with war and sword and with cataracts of fire and brimstone. "War and pestilence shall come upon all mankind at once, and God shall make the great heaven above frozen" and bring drought over the whole earth. "Hellas, why dost thou put trust in governors, mortal men who are powerless to escape the consummation of death? With what view dost thou proffer vain gifts to the dead and sacrifice to idols? Who has put error in thine heart, that thou shouldst perform these rites and forsake the face of the mighty God? Reverence the name of the Father and forget Him not. Long have the haughty rulers of Greece wrought evil for mankind, holding fast to idols and defunct gods. When the divine wrath will be upon you, ye shall know the face of the great God. And every creature will upraise hands to the broad heavens and shall call for God's help and deliverance from the mighty wrath."33 In a calmer mood the author of the Letter of Aristeas utilizes the Euhemeristic philosophy of religion to refute the wisdom of the Greek myth-makers. Euhemerus, a resident at the court of Cassander in Macedonia (circa 316), gave currency to the idea that the gods of the nations were originally heroes who distinguished themselves either as warriors or as benefactors and who, after their death, received divine worship from the grateful people. The author of the Letter turns this theory against the practice of idolatry. Having set up statues of stone and wood, men acclaim them as the images of inventors of things useful for life, and worship them, despite their being devoid of all feeling. It would be utterly foolish, he argues, "to suppose that 33גג The Sibylline Oracles, tr. Lanchester in Charles' Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha II, Fragment III.17 ff.; also 1.2 ff.; Bk. III.545-561.</page><page sequence="8">432 SAMUEL S. COHON [8] anyone became a god in virtue of his inventions. For the inventors simply took certain objects already created and, by combining them together, showed that they possessed a fresh utility: they did not themselves create the substance of the thing, and so it is a vain and foolish thing for people to make gods of men like themselves. For in our times there are many who are much more inventive and much more learned than the men of former days who have been deified, and yet they would never come to wor ship them." We need hardly speak of the Egyptians and other infatuated people "who place their reliance upon wild beasts and most kinds of creeping things and cattle, and worship them, and offer sacrifices to them both while living and when dead." In contrast to this folly, the Letter of Aristeas holds out the doctrine of Moses that "there is only one God and that His power is manifested throughout the universe, since every place is filled with His sovereignty and none of the things which are wrought in secret by men upon the earth escapes His knowledge." Not even the evil which man devises escapes God.34 The Wisdom of Solomon expands these ideas. The root of idolatry is human folly. From the abundance of good things men do not infer their author. "Neither by giving heed to the works did they recognize the artificer; but either fire, or wind, or swift air, or circling stars, or raging water, or luminaries of heaven, they thought to be gods that rule the world." If the heathen had understanding, "how is it that they did not find the Sovereign Lord of these works?" From the greatness and beauty of created things men should deduce the idea of their creator. Most mis erable are they who called the products of human labor gods, artistic creations in gold and silver, in the likeness of beasts, a useless stone, or the carving of a skillful woodcutter in the likeness of a man or animal, painted and set up as an object of prayer. Modifying the Euhemeristic theory, the author of the Wisdom of Solomon traces idol worship to human error. A father mour ning the death of a child orders an image of the child to be prepared, and then honors the image as a god, instituting 34 See 132-138, and notes by Andrews in Charles, A. P. E. II, p. 107.</page><page sequence="9">[9] THE UNITY OF GOD 433 "mysteries" and solemn rites, which in course of time acquire the force of law. So, too, likenesses of a king are set up to flatter an absent ruler, and are subsequently made the objects of wor ship. The artificer investing his work with beauty, allures the multitude to worship human beings. Thus a hidden danger is created, because men, in times of stress, invoke "stones and stocks with the incommunicable name." Straying in their knowledge of God, the people live in conflict with His laws, disregarding life and morality, "slaughtering children in solemn rites, or celebrating secret mysteries or holding frantic revels in strange ordinances." They kill one another treacherously, engage in thieving and lying, corruption, faith lessness, perjury, adultery, and wantonness. For the worship of those unnameable idols is the beginning and cause and end of every evil. In the style of Deutero-Isaiah and the Psalmists,35 the manufacture of idols is derided and their worship mocked. The idols have neither eyes for seeing nor nostrils for drawing breath, for they are made by the hand of mortal man. "Being mortal, he maketh a dead thing with his lawless hands; for he is better than the things he worshippeth. Of the two, he indeed had life, but they never." Special scorn is reserved for Egyptian worship of loathsome, irrational and unclean animals.36 The major themes of the propaganda literature, the reality and excellence of monotheism and the delusion of polytheism, the spiritual and moral debasement which idolatry produces and the commercialism which supports its practices and cults re appear in Philo and in Josephus. Philo grounds his attack on polytheism and idolatry, in his philosophical theology. In his view, it was the true vision of God as a unity for which Moses prayed, since the mind may be deluded to conceive of Him as more than one, even as the eye, when it is weak may see double, i. e. one object as two. At the burning bush, Moses was charged by God: "First tell them that I am He who is, that they may learn the difference between what is and what is not, and also the further lesson that no name at all can properly be used of Me, to whom alone existence belongs." God is conceived onto 3s Cf. Isa. 40-41 ; 44; 46; Pss. 115, etc. 3' Wisdom 13; 14.12-31; 15.</page><page sequence="10">[10] 434 SAMUEL S. COHON logically as "He who truly is," "the truly existent one" and "the cause of all that comes into being." He is also spoken of as "the Mind of the Universe." Philo concludes his treatise on Creation with the five-fold creed: first, "God has been from eternity," thus opposing the atheists who doubt either His eternity or His existence; second, "God is one," contrary to the polytheists who transfer "mob rule" from earth to heaven; third, "the world came into being," opposing the view that the world is eternal, thereby depriving God of superiority; fourth, "the world, too, is one as well as its Maker," contradicting the ideas of the plurality of worlds; and fifth, "God exercises fore thought on the world's behalf." Only the believer in this creed will lead a life of bliss and blessedness because his character is shaped by the truths that piety and holiness enforce. Philo applies these ideas to his interpretation of the first two commandments of the Decalogue. The major part of humanity, he comments, is under delusion regarding "the tran scendent Source of all that exists." "Some have deified the four elements, earth, water, air and fire, others the sun, moon, planets, and fixed stars, others, again, the heaven by itself, others the whole world. But the highest and the most august, the Begetter, the Ruler of the great world-city, the commander in-chief of the invincible host, the Pilot who ever steers all things in safety, Him they have hidden from sight by the misleading titles assigned to the objects of worship mentioned above. Dif ferent people give Him different names: some call the earth Kore or Demeter or Pluto, and the sea Poseidon, and invent marine deities subordinate to him and great companies of attendants, male and female. They call air Hera and fire Hephastus, the sun Apollo, the moon Artemis, the morning-star Aphrodite and the glitterer Hermes, and each of the other stars have names handed down by the myth-makers, who have put together fables skilfully contrived to deceive the hearers and thus won a repu tation for accomplishment in name-giving." So, too, they divided the heaven into two hemispheres, one about the earth and one below it, and called them the Dioscuri. In contradistinction to these myths Moses forbade the dei fication of any part of the universe. For the world is in process</page><page sequence="11">[11] THE UNITY OF GOD 435 of becoming, and there was a time when it was non-existent. "But to speak of God as 'not-being' at some former time, or having 'become' at some particular time and not existing for all eternity is profanity." Intellectual ineptitude prevents many from knowing "the truly Existent because they suppose that there is no invisible and conceptual cause outside what the senses perceive, though the clearest possible proof lies ready at their hand. For while it is with the soul that they live and plan and carry out all the affairs of human life, they can never see the soul with the eyes of the body." Still more difficult it is to behold "the Uncreated and Eternal, the invisible charioteer who guides in safety the whole universe." Anyone who pays to the creatures the tribute due to their Maker is as foolish as he who bestows on subordinates the honor due to their master. It behooves us, Philo pleads, to refrain from worshipping created things, and to devote ourselves with every faculty to "the service of the Uncreated, the Eternal, the Cause of all." "Let us, then engrave deep in our hearts this as the first and most sacred of commandments, to acknowledge and honor one God who is above all, and let the idea that gods are many never even reach the ears of the man whose rule of life is to seek for truth in purity and guilelessness." Particularly mischievous is the manufacture of idols for wor ship, of giving shape to stocks and stones and silver and gold, etc., according to human fancy, and filling the habitable world with images and wooden figures and other works of human hands. "For these idolaters cut away the most excellent support of the soul, the rightful conception of the Ever-living God." In their ignorance they fail to comprehend that most "obvious truth which even 'a witless infant' knows, that the craftsman is superior to the product of his craft," both in time and in value. Worst of all some image-makers offer prayers and sacrifices to their own creations. They might well be told that inasmuch as the best of prayers and the goal of happiness is to become like God, they should pray to be made "like their images and thus enjoy supreme happiness with eyes that see not, ears that hear not, nostrils which neither breathe nor smell, mouths that never taste nor speak, hands that neither give nor take nor do anything</page><page sequence="12">436 SAMUEL S. COHON [12] at all, feet that walk not, with no activity in any parts of your bodies, but kept under watch and ward in your temple-prison, day and night, ever drinking in the smoke of the victims. For this is the one good which you imagine your idols to enjoy." However, "such advice would be received with indignation as savouring of imprecations rather than of prayers." The Egyptians not only share in general polytheism but have "advanced to divine honors irrational animals, bulls and rams and goats, and invented for each some fabulous legend of won der." Among them are not only domestic animals, useful for men, but also "the fiercest and most savage of wild animals, lions and crocodiles and among reptiles the venomous asp, all of which they dignify with temples, sacred precincts, sacrifices, assemblies, processions, and the like." They deified also dogs, cats, wolves and among birds, ibises and hawks. Fishes, too, have received divine honors. "What," Philo asks, "could be more ridiculous than all this?" "Indeed," he informs us, "stran gers on their first arrival in Egypt before the vanity of the land has gained a lodgment in their minds are like to die with laughing at it," while intelligent people are moved to pity those who venerate these creatures, as men with souls transformed into the nature of those beasts.37 Josephus' apologetic of Judaism follows along Philo's lines. Without urging, as Aristobulus and Philo did, that the wisest of the Greeks adopted conceptions of God from Moses, he claims that their teachings bear testimony to the excellence of the Jewish doctrine of the nature and majesty of God. Among them he includes nearly all the philosophers. However, while they confined their philosophy to the select few, Moses had addressed himself to the masses not only of his day but also to their descendants to all future generations in order to make their practice accord with their teaching. A Greek note appears in Josephus' reference to God as "the blessed being or nature" and in the negative attributes which ■" Quaestiones et Solutiones in Genesin IV.8; Moses 1.75; Decalogue 52-55 and 66-81 (tr.

IV.</page><page sequence="13">[13] THE UNITY OF GOD 437 he applies to God. Divine Unity forms the center of his theology. It is the theme of the first of all the commandments of the Torah. Moses, he writes, represented Him "as One, uncreated and immutable to all eternity, in beauty surpassing all mortal thought, made known to us by His power, although the nature of His real being passes knowledge." He is "perfect and blessed, self-sufficing and sufficing for all, He is the beginning, the middle and the end of all things. By His works and bounties He is plainly seen, indeed more manifest than aught else; but His form and magnitude surpass our powers of description. No materials, however costly, are fit to make an image of Him; no art has skill to conceive and represent it. The like of Him we have never seen, we do not imagine, and it is impious to conjecture." No other explanation of creation is required save His active will; thus dispensing with the idea of the Logos of Hellenistic Judaism. All things issue from Him and exist for Him. From God's unity all other unities derive. Like the cosmos, so humanity proceeds from Him who is the Father and deter miner of destiny. By virtue of God's unity, Israel, too, is one. Josephus boasts of the homogeneity of religious belief among the Jews, producing "a very beautiful concord in human char acter" unknown among other peoples. The contradictory ideas about God among the common people and philosophers of other nations, ranging from arguments against His very existence to denials of His providence, are not found among the Jews. "With us," he claims, "all act alike, all profess the same doctrine about God, one which is in harmony with our Law and affirms that all things are under His eye." The entire Mosaic system centers in the theocracy, which makes Israel the servant of God. As the sole ruler of the universe, God assigns the administration of its highest affairs to the entire body of priests under the direction of the high-priest. The con stitution by which they are guided is the Torah. By it the whole community is guided. "We have but one temple for the one God . . . common to all as God is common to all." Josephus' conception of Divine Unity stands in sharpest contrast to all forms of idolatry, whether Egyptian theriolatry or Greek polytheism. He approaches the task of criticizing the</page><page sequence="14">438 SAMUEL S. cohon [14] foreign cults with reluctance, professing that Moses forbade the Jews to "deride or blaspheme the gods worshipped by others out of respect for the very word God (cf. Ex. 22.27)." However, since the revilers seek "to confute us by a comparison of the rival religions," he is forced to speak out. He gathers courage from the fact that his devastating criticism of the gross and immoral ideas of the Homeric gods was not original with him but was drawn from many writers of "the highest reputation." "Who, in fact," Josephus asks, "is there among the admired sages of Greece who has not censured their most famous poets and their most trusted legislators for sowing in the minds of the masses the first seeds of such notions about the gods?" The fertile imagination of the myth-makers invested the gods with attributes so anthropomorphic and licentious as to evoke the censure and the ridicule of thinking minds. The cause for the spread of these falsehoods Josephus assigned to the legislators who enter upon their tasks without proper knowledge of the nature of God. Hence they allow the poets to invest the gods with all the passions, and the painters and sculptors to devise figures of their own imagination.38 Liturgic Creed It is within Jewry that the doctrine of Divine Unity assumed its characteristic expression. As the watchword of Judaism and the bond of Jewish unity, it has evoked the deepest loyalty of the Jewish people. Believing that their very existence depended upon this truth, Jews in all ages have witnessed to it with their lives and often died a martyr's death with the profession of unity on their lips. As a confession of faith, it holds the center in Jewish worship, mornings and evenings. When the Shema assumed the character of a liturgic creed 38 Ant. II.12, 4; Apion II.33 ff. (tr. H. St. J. Thackeray). Josephus refers to the Septuagint interpretation of Ex. 22.28, "Thou shalt not revile God." He treats this law also in Ant. IV.8, 10. Philo explains this law on the ground that reviling the gods of the neighbors might lead to retaliation "lest they on their part be moved to utter profane words against Him who truly is." Special Laws I.50; Moses II.203.</page><page sequence="15">[15] THE UNITY OF GOD 439 cannot be stated with certainty. The Mishna records that to gether with the Decalogue, the Shema (consisting of three passages:passages: Deut. (a) 6.4-9, (b) 11■ 13-20, and (c) Num. 15.37-41) served as the core of Jewish prayer-service at the Temple.39 The Nash Papyrus indicates that the two were joined in the liturgy of Alexandrian Jews in pre-Christian times.40 To cancel the sectarian claim that the Decalogue represented the entire body of commandments given to Moses at Sinai, it was elimi nated from the liturgy of the synagogue after the fall of the Temple, and the Shema alone was retained.41 We are informed that "the pious used to complete the re citation of the Shema at sunrise,"42 and that it was recited also in the evening, as suggested by Isa. 45.7 and Ps. 72.5. This usage may have been prompted in the first instance by the Parsi practice of hailing the sun at its rising and setting, thus acknowledging Ahuramazda as creator.43 He is said to have charged the ancestors of the race, who were "created perfect in devotion" by him, to perform devotedly the duty of the law, think good thoughts, speak good words, do good deeds, and worship no demons. Their first act on rising was "to wash themselves thoroughly and their first deeds were to acknowledge that Ahuramazda created the water and earth, the stars, moon and sun, and all prosperity whose origin and effect are from the manifestation of righteousness." Subsequently, enmity entered 39 Tamid 5.1; Ber. lib. 4° W. F. Albright, "The Nash Papyrus," Journal of Biblical Literature, 1937' PP• 145176־.

These were spoken by God in person to the people, while the remaining legislation of the Torah He gave through Moses. A similar view regarding the Decalogue is expressed in Tan huma,huma, Vayelech, 2. For other opinions see Mekilta, Bafiodesh, ed. Lauterbach, Vol. II, p. 228 and note; Makkot 23a-24b; Pesikta R., ed.

Another factor which probably contributed toward the use of the Shema as a confession of faith was the spirit of martyrdom which came to be the mark of Hasidic piety in opposition to Antiochus Epiphanes' forceful spread of pagan worship among the Jews. The Parables (written before 63 B. c.) in the book of Enoch seem to assume such a practice. The pious are assured that their works are known and will be judged by the Lord of Spirits. "Then shall they all with one voice speak and bless, and glorify and extol and sanctify the name of the Lord of Spirits." Also the hosts of heaven, the angels, cherubim, seraphim and ophanim will be summoned to "raise one voice, and bless and glorify and exalt in the spirit of faith, and in the spirit of wisdom, and in the spirit of patience, and in the spirit of mercy, and in the spirit of judgment and of peace, and in the spirit of goodness, and shall all say with one voice: Blessed is He, and may the name of the Lord of Spirits be blessed forever and ever." The repentant "kings and the mighty" shall acknowl edge: "We have now learned that we should glorify and bless the Lord of kings and Him who is King over all kings."43 Josephus considers the recitation of the Shema "twice each day, at the dawn thereof and when the hour comes for turning to repose" as an ordinance of the Torah which goes back to Moses.46 The Talmud records a difference of opinion regarding the antiquity of the practice. While one view considers it Scrip "" Cf. ZendAvesta 11-351; III.ill ff.; Bundahis XV.6 fï. Ch.

They answered: "Hear, O Israel our father, even as there is no division in your heart concerning the Creator so there is none in ours concerning Him. The Lord is our God, the Lord is one." Jacob responded: "Praised be His name whose glorious kingdom is forever."48 R. Berechja and R. Helbo cite the opinion of Samuel that this is what the Jewish people say daily, morning and evening: "Hear, 0 Israel out of the cave of Machpela! That which you commanded us is still observed by us: the Lord is our God, the Lord is one."49 R. Pinhas bar Hama is of the opinion that Israel obtained the privilege of reciting the Shema at the time of the giving of the Law at Sinai, for God opened His revelation with the declaration: "Hear, O Israel, I am the Lord your God," and the assembled hosts responded: "The Lord is our God, the Lord is one." And Moses spoke: "Praised be the name of His glorious kingdom forever."50 Accordingly, the recitation of the Shema came to be styled as "accepting the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven." Abudraham interprets the recitation of the Shema as bearing witness to one's faith in God's unity. Hence the texts write large the ayyin of the word shema and the dalet of ehad, spelling ed, witness.51 The Rabbinic Defense Though monotheism established itself as the basic doctrine of Judaism, the danger of the recurrence of polytheism, which pervaded the ancient world, continued to menace the Jewish י" Ber. 21a. 48 Sifre, Deut., Vaethanan 3.31 (to Deut. 6.4); Targum Jerushalmi to Gen. 49.2; Pesahim 56a. 49 Gen.

Hence the zeal of the Tannaim and Amoraim to check the inroads of polytheism. Their lines of reasoning are in basic accord with those used by the masters of Hellenistic Judaism. The rabbinic attitude toward polytheism was dictated by the logic of monotheism. This may be conveniently noted in the comments of the Mekilta on the first two commandments of the Decalogue.52 The opening words of the first commandment stress God's oneness amid His varied manifestations. At the Red Sea He revealed Himself as a warrior doing battle against Israel's foes (Ex. 15.3). At Sinai He appeared as an elder full of compassion (Ex. 24.10). Subsequently He showed Himself "like the very heavens for clearness" (ibid.) and "thrones were placed" and "a fiery stream issued and came forth before Him" (Dan. 7.9-10). Not to afford the nations an excuse for the claim that there are two sovereignties, God specified: "I am the Lord thy God." I am He who was in Egypt, and I am He who was at Sinai. I am He who was in the past, and I am He who will be in the future. I am He who is in this world, and I am the selfsame who will be in the world to come (Isa. 44.6). While the Eternal is "the God of all flesh" (Jer. 32.27), he is in a special sense "the God of Israel," because He conferred His name particularly upon the people dedicated to Him. Having accepted His bounty and His sovereignty, Israel is bound to observe His decrees and to avoid the worship of all deities besides Him. All worship other than His constitutes aboda zara "foreign worship" or akum (abodat kochabim umazzalot), "the worship of stars and planets." On the ground of a detailed examination of each word and phrase of the second command ment, the rabbis prohibited not only the making of idols but also the possession of those already made. Their designation as elohim in the face of the biblical denial of their reality53 is 5J Bahodesh, 5-6; Shirata to Ex. 15.3; Kaspa, 4 to Ex. 34.23; Sifre, Vaetljanan to Deut. 6.4.

The word alterim is interpreted as "holding back" the coming of goodness into the world, also as "turning their worshippers into 'others' [i. e. perverting them] or as those who act like strangers to their worshippers." In the words of the prophet regarding the idol: "Yea, though one cry unto him, he cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble."54 R. Jose takes the indefinite way of referring to idols, i. e. without specifying their names, as in tended to indicate their worthlessness. R. Eliezer explains the expression "other gods" as signifying that the idolaters manu facture for themselves new gods every day. If one owns an idol of gold and needs the gold, he replaces it with one of silver; if he has a silver idol and needs the silver, he makes another one out of copper. If he has a copper idol and needs the copper, he replaces it with one of iron, of tin or of lead. Hence the expression "new gods that came newly up."55 R. Isaac remarks that if we were to enumerate all the idols there would not be enough parchment in the world on which to write out their names. Among idols, R. Hanina b. Antigonos includes any fetish whose power is acknowledged, "even if it be a chip of wood or a piece of potsherd." R. Jehuda Hanasi inter prêts the words elohim aherim as "gods that are later than the last of creation," i. e. man who calls them "gods." The expression "before Me" was taken to exclude the thought that the prohibition of idolatry applied only to the generation of the Exodus. The words "before Me" signify that "even as I live and abide forever and for all eternity, so you and your son and your son's son to the end of all generations shall not worship idols." The further statement, "thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image" was understood as prohibiting not only an image that is engraven, but also a solid one, a plant, a tree, a stone, or an image of any metal or any figure, whether of cattle, beasts, birds, fishes, locusts or reptiles, of stars, of angels, cherubim or ophanim,56 even representations of the deep, of darkness, or of « Isa. 46.7. 55 Deut. 32.17. 5" Cf. Ezek. 1.5 ff.</page><page sequence="20">444 SAMUEL S. COHON [20] reflected likenesses. "Scripture has pursued the evil inclination so as to leave no room for any pretext of permitting idolatry." The words "thou shalt not have them nor serve them" evoked the comment that not only does Scripture condemn the two acts together, but each one by itself. The objectionable anthropopathism of the words "I the Lord am a jealous God" is removed by R. Jehuda Hanasi's comment that Scripture means to say that "God controls jealousy, not that jealousy has power over Him." Similarly, Ps. 121.4, "Behold, He that keepeth Israel doth neither slumber nor sleep" signifies that He rules over slumber, not that slumber has power over Him. Another explanation is: "I zealously exact punishment for idolatry, but I am merciful and gracious in other matters." As to God's jealousy toward idols, a philosopher asked R. Gamaliel : Why is God jealous of the idolaters rather than of the idols? The sage replied with a parable: It is like unto a man who had a son who named his dog after his father. With whom is the father angry, with the son or with the dog? The philosopher objected: "You call the idol 'dog.' Has it no substance? Once a a fire broke out in our province and destroyed all buildings, but the house of the idol was spared. Was it not because the idol could take care of itself?" Gamaliel answered with another par able: "It is like a king who had to put down a revolt in a province. When he waged war, was it against the living or the dead?" The philosopher retorted: "You call the idol a 'dog,' and you call it 'dead.' If so, why does not God destroy idolatry from the world?" Gamaliel replied: "If men served only useless objects, God might have destroyed them, but they worship the sun, moon and stars and planets, brooks and valleys. Shall he destroy the world because of the fools?"57 Idolatry was regarded as the first of the cardinal sins which the Jew must avoid at the very cost of life.58 Whoever acknowl edges idols negates the entire Torah.59 Departure from the Torah is equivalent to attachment to idolatry.60 The sin of the " See also the parallel in Ab.

One must not look at images. The very thought of idolatrous worship was prohibited.61 While Jews were forbidden to mock at anything holy, it was deemed meritorious to deride idols.62 Akiba held that the names of idols may be caricatured.63 This may be the intention of calling Baal Zebub, Baal Zebul in the N. T.64 The Talmud speaks of sacrifices to idols as Zebel, manure.65 The Tosephta enjoins that on beholding an idol, one was to say: "Blessed be the long-suffering One." When seeing a place from which idol atry was removed, he was to say: "Blessed be He who plucked out strange worship from our land. May it be Thy will, 0 Lord our God, that idolatry be removed from our land and from all dwelling places of Israel, and may the hearts of their worshippers be turned to serve Thee."66 Practical necessity led the Jews who lived among idolaters to adopt a more tolerant attitude. Thus the command in Deut. 12.2-3, to destroy all heathen objects of worship, was limited by the Rabbis to Palestine. "In the land of Israel thou art commanded to persecute (idolatry), but thou art not commanded to persecute it outside of the Land."67 Witnessing to God's unity came to represent the distin guishing mark of a Jew. "Whoever denies idolatry is considered a Jew." Ish yehudi is defined as yehidi, "one who professes the unity of God."68 Unity acquired the meaning of reality.

The word elohim in this verse is defined as truth, as we find in Jeremiah 10.10 "and the Lord God is truth."69 This verse supports the thought that "God's signet is truth."70 A late Midrash states: "The Holy One is called truth; the throne which He occupies from of old is truth; His presence faces loving kindness and truth; all His words are truth; all His judgments are judgments of truth; and all His paths are loving kindness and truth."71 One opinion explains the first two letters of EMet as an abbreviation of Elohim hayyim Melech olam, "the living God and everlasting King." Another view, paralleled by comments of Philo and of Josephus states: "Aleph is the first letter of the alphabet, Mem the middle and Tav the end, thus teaching: " 'I (God) am the first,' I have not derived my divinity from another; 'and besides Me there are no gods,' I have no partner; 'and with the last one I am the same One,' for I shall not hand over My divinity to another."72 God's eternity is an aspect of His unity. In sharpest contrast to the mystery religions which centered in the belief in dying and reviving gods, Judaism affirmed that God is from everlasting to everlasting. A rabbinic prayer reads: "Thou wast ere yet the world was created. Thou hast been since its creation. Thou art in this world and Thou wilt be in the world to come."73 He transcends time as He transcends space. He is without beginning and without end. "All things decay but God does not decay."74 He is not merely the living God but He imparts life or being to the Universe.75 He has created and preserves it; and should the world pass away, He will continue to endure.

Pleased with the praise accorded him by its residents, he promised them public works, bath houses, and a water conduit. He went to sleep and did not wake again. Where is he and where are his promises? It is not so with God. "The true God, He is the living God, and the everlasting King."78 The exclamation "Who is like unto Thee, 0 Lord, among the gods!" is explained: Who is like unto Thee among those who serve Thee in the heavens;79 who is like unto Thee among those who call themselves gods — Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, the prince of Tyre!80 Who is like unto Thee among those who are deified by others and in whom there is no substance, of whom it is said: They have mouths but they speak not!81 He is not only one but unique. Reference to other gods is simply a concession to human speech. Gnostic Dualism The doctrine of Divine Unity encountered the opposition of the Gnostic sects which appeared as a threat to Judaism as well as to Christianity in the early centuries of the common era. Gnosticism was not primarily an intellectual system aiming to reconcile philosophical reflection with religion, but a body of knowledge claimed to have been based on revelation and was to be accepted on faith and guarded as a secret. Its ultimate goal was personal salvation or the assurance of a fortunate destiny of the soul after death. The central object of Gnostic 6י I Sam. 2.2. " Ber. ioa; Meg. 14a; Tanlj. Tazria, 3; Midr.

COHON [24] cults was "a redeemer-deity who has already trodden the diffi cult way which the faithful [one] has to follow."82 The esotericism of Gnosticism partly accounts for the obscu rity of its origin and of its character. Its extant expression shows the syncretistic nature of the movement, combining elements of Babylonian, Persian and Greek thought with Egyptian magic. These were variously merged with Jewish teaching. Stray evi dence points to a pre-Christian type of Gnosis in Judaism itself. It is probably against the danger of engaging in its hidden knowledge, that Ben Sira warned his pious readers.83 The Essenes seemed to have possessed some of its secret lore. The Apocalyp ticists, as evidenced by Enoch and its kindred literature, were attracted by its secrets. The mystic lore concerning Creation and the Throne Chariot, the divine Name, angelology, etc. preserved in Rabbinic literature and forming the basis of the Cabbala, is of this character. The Rabbinic adepts of this type of Gnosis included R. Johanan b. Zakkai and some of his leading disciples.84 As a mysterious doctrine it was imparted only to initiates.85 The Mishna interdicts the exposition of Creation before as many as two disciples and of the Chariot before even one unless he be specially endowed with wisdom and with an intuitive under standing.86 Like magic formulae, so this mystic lore was believed to possess the power of initiating action in the upper and lower spheres. Hence Johanan b. Zakkai refused to expound the Chariot before his disciple Eleazar b. Arach. When the disciple surprised the master by discoursing on the subject before him, the Shechina and the ministering angels descended, and a heavenly flame surrounded the trees of the field, which burst forth with song. When two other scholars discussed the Chariot, 82 W. Bousset, art. "Gnosticism," Encycl. Brit., nth ed.

The Mishna admonishes that "whoever pries into four things would better not have been created: what is above [creation], what below, what aforetime, and what hereafter." Such investigations were on a par with "disregarding the honor of the Creator."88 They "produce jealousy, enmity, and strife between Israel and God."89 The very basis of Gnosticism lay in dualism. The world of good and the world of evil are sharply contrasted, the divine world and the material world, the world of light and the world of darkness. In many Gnostic systems no attempt was made to derive one from the other. Men like Basilides, Valentinus and Bardesanes were thorough dualists in their theology. The fall of God into the world of matter was a favorite theme of Gnostic systems. Thereby insensate matter was animated with life and activity. Then arose the powers, both partly and wholly hostile, who held sway over the world. Such figures of fallen deities are Sophia (i. e. Ahamoth = Hochma?) among the Ophites, Helena among the Simmioni, or the Primal Man among the Naaseni. In the Valentinian system the fall of Sophia takes place within the godhead, and Sophia, inflamed with love, plunges into Bythos, the highest divinity. The lower world is thus derived from the suffering and passions of fallen divinity. An approach to a monistic philosophy appears in the system of emanations of Basilides. It assumes that from the highest divinity emanated a somewhat lesser world, from this world a second, and so on, until the divine element of life became so weakened and attenuated as to have made possible the appear ance of the wholly evil world.

T.9° The Gnostic world of evil is full of active energy and of hostile powers derived from Persian dualism. This idea of two hostile powers within the world combined with the Greek dualism of the opposition between spirit and matter into the notion of the corporeal world as the seat of evil, constantly treating the bodily existence of mankind as essentially evil and the separation of the spiritual from the physical as the object of salvation. "Out of the combination of these two dualisms," Bousset concludes, "arose the teaching of Gnosticism, with its thoroughgoing pessimism and fundamental asceticism."91 Gnostic speculation was particularly dangerous since a dual istic trend appeared in Judaism as an expression of piety. Thus the Essenes associated only the good in nature and in human experience with God, accounting for evil as the action of demonic powers.92 Of the four rabbis who entered the realm of Gnosis (the Pardes)Pardes) only Akiba came out unhurt. Ben Azzai beheld the mysteries and died. Ben Zoma lost his reason. Elisha b. Abuya became an apostate.93 What led him to apostacy, according to the Palestinian Gemara, was his concern with the problem of evil.

"It seems," he concluded, "that there is no reward for righteousness and no resurrection of the dead" (i. e. he rejected the belief in a final balance in the hereafter).94 The Babylonian Gemara accounts for Elisha's defection from Ju daism on the ground that on his ascent to Paradise he beheld Metatron seated while recording the merits of Israel. This inde pendent behavior of Metatron in the presence of the Holy One led Elisha to conclude that there are "two sovereignties."95 The Christian Gnostics derived their ideas from Jesus himself and from his disciples with whom they claimed to have been connected by a secret tradition. While Jesus was in complete agreement with Pharisaic Judaism in affirming the unity of God,96 his identification in the minds of his followers with the supernatural Messiah or with the Son of Man of the book of Enoch furnished the basis for dualistic teaching in the early church. He was quoted as saying: "We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of the evil one." He was further reported to have stated: "Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out; and I when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."97 Paul speaks of his ascent to heaven in a moment of ecstasy where he beheld the Christ. The figure of Christ rep resented for him "the likeness of God."

The Christian struggle, he assured his followers, was not "against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places." He is ever aware of the "flaming darts of the evil one."'8 The faith and mission of the early Church crystallized themselves in the formula of Matthew 28.19: "Make disciples among the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."99 The Christian Gnostics make these dualistic elements the basis of their mythologies. Particularly instructive is the example of Marcion. His interest was not theoretical but practical, viz. faith in Jesus Christ and in his Father as a means of salvation. That faith issued in an ascetic life which demanded the rejection of the work of the Creator as much as human conditions allowed. Only celibates were admitted to baptism. The resurrection of the body was denied, since matter is inherently evil. Salvation was only for the spirit. Marcion differed from the Gnostics in excluding any doctrine that could not be derived from his interpretation of the Jewish or Christian Scriptures. His lost work, named Antitheses, con taining proofs of his theology, derived from O. T. statements about God, placed side by side with the opposing utterances of Jesus and Paul. His exegesis combined a high estimate of the objective truth of the O. T. as a historical document — avoiding allegorical explanations such as were current among the Gnos tics — with a startlingly audacious criticism of the N. T., ruth lessly cutting away such books and portions of books as did not fit his preconceived notions, and re-editing the text on subjective grounds. Finding Luke best suited to his theology, he adopted this gospel, though in mutilated and altered form, as the sole reliable portion of the historical writings of the N. T.

Following the Syrian Cerdo, who had some connection with the Gnostics, he maintained that the just God of the O. T. was other than and inferior to the N. T. God of goodness and of lovingkindness. According to Tertullian, Marcion arrived at his dualistic theology by "morbidly brooding over the question of good and evil. He was further stimulated by a saying of Jesus, reported in Luke 6.43 ff., that "the good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit, neither the corrupt tree good fruit." Finding further that Isa. 45.7 declares in the name of the Creator, "I am He that createth evil," Marcion "applied to the Creator the figure of the corrupt tree bringing forth evil fruit, that is, moral evil, and then presumed that there ought to be another god, after the analogy of the good tree producing its good fruit. Accordingly, finding in Christ a different dispo sition, as it were — one of a simple and pure benevolence — differing from the Creator, he readily argued that in his Christ had been revealed a new and strange divinity." The One deity is "judicial, harsh, mighty in war; the other mild, placid, and simply good and excellent.101 For all their antagonism to the Torah, the anti-Jewish Gnostics, in keeping with their syncretistic tendencies and through their alliance with Christianity, recognized — if only for argument sake — the validity of the Torah and utilized some of its teachings in constructing their heretical systems. They turned to it also for weapons with which to fight Judaism. They used the opening chapters of Genesis as the framework of their emanationist cosmogonies. The numerous divine names in the Bible served them as arguments for the plurality of gods or of persons in the Godhead and for a dualistic view of the world. They distinguished between the supreme God and the God of Israel. The latter, they contended, could not be the supreme God since much that is credited to Him in the Torah cannot be reconciled with such a being. They, therefore, insisted י N. McLean, art.

COHON [30] that while elohim (theos) designates the Supreme God, who is the source of goodness, YHWH is the God of this world, i. e. the Demiurgos,Demiurgos, who fashioned the material universe, the satanic cause of evil and of rigid justice. Attaining its most radical expression in Marcionism, this anti-Jewish viewpoint underlies all Gnostic systems. Rabbinic theology countered these Gnostic doctrines by careful reinterpretation of the significance of the divine names. The Gnostic distinction between elohim and YHWH may account for the rabbinic emphasis on the two as expressions of the attributes of justice and of mercy by which God rules the world. Their elevation of elohim above YHWH is probably the reason which led the Rabbis to minimize its use. We have noted the attempt of the Jewish authorities to reintroduce the Tetra grammaton in personal greetings in order to overcome the opinions of the "impious" (Peruzim), a term referring to Jewish Hellenizers and other sectarians whether Gnostic or Christian.102 This may also account for the avoidance of the use of Elohim "in the schools and the synagogues of the first four centuries of Palestine except in quotations from the Bible, in prayers and magic."103 The Gnostic contention further explains the shift in rabbinic interpretation of Elohim and YHWH. A. Marmorstein has shown that originally the rabbis identified YHWH with the attribute of justice and Elohim with the attribute of mercy.104 This view S. S.

Theos = Elohim represents Euer getesgetes the good, the God of love and of benevolence and Kyrios = YHWH (Adonai) denotes lordship, rulership, judgment.105 How ever, a reversed norm appears in the Sifre to Deut. 3.24: "Wherever the term YHWH occurs, it represents the attribute of mercy (as in Ex. 34.6); wherever Elohim is used, the attribute of justice is meant" (as in Ex. 22.8,27).106 This reinterpretation of the meanings of YHWH and Elohim stems from the desire to emphasize that the distinguishing characteristic of the God of Israel is not strict justice but benevolence and compassion. Hence the designation of God as Raljamana, the Merciful One.107 The Rabbis found support for their view in Ps. 145.9: "YHWH is good unto all and His mercies are over all His works." R. Joshua b. Levi interprets this verse: His mercies are over all because they are His works. R. Samuel b. Nahman takes it to mean: His mercies are over all, for such are His works or attributes. He is compassionate. R. Levi takes it to signify: He endows His creatures with His compassion. The difficulties arising from verses supporting the older interpretation of the divine names are solved in this wise: Commenting on Gen. 8.1: "And Elohim remembered Noah," R. Samuel b. Nahman said: וכמה. The Tetragrammaton is used here in connection with punishment: "I ant YHWH — Under oath I declare that I shall exact punishment from them," etc. On the other hand the Mek., Shirata, III, 45a; ed. Lauterbach II, p. 28 states: [זה אלי ואנוהו אלהי אבי וארוממנהו], עמי נהג במרת רחמים ועם אבוחי נהג במרת הרין. ומנין שאין אלי אלא מרת רחמים, שנאמר (תהלים כב, ב) אלי אלי למה עזבתני, ואומר (במדבר יב, יג) אל נא רפא נא לה, ואומר (תהלים קיח, בז) אל ה' ויאר לנו.

The same practice is followed by the Targum of the Prophets. Simeon ben Azzai teaches: "Come and see that in all the laws regarding sacrifices in the Torah neither Elohim Elohim nor Elohecha, Shaddai or Zebaot, is used but only YHWH, the distinctive Name, in order to afford the heretics no ground for their contentions," viz. that the God who commanded the sacrifices is not the same one who rules on high.109 Opposing the Gnostic distinction of persons and attributes in the godhead, a Tannaitic source teaches: "Why was Adam created alone?

The fact that Adam was created single refutes the Gnostic doctrine of syzygies (zugot)(zugot)(zugot)(zugot) or "pairs," representing opposites (i. e. that diverse moral characters are fixed), so that the righteous might not claim that their righteousness came to them by virtue of their descent from righteous parents, nor the wicked that their wicked ness derived from their parents.110 R.

The plural verb in Gen. 35.7: "For there the Elohim revealed themselves (נבלו) to him" (Jacob), is righted by the singular form in vs. 3: "I will make there an altar unto El, who answered (הענה) me in the day of my distress." Similarly the plural form of the adjective modifying elohim is followed by a singular pronoun in Deut. 4.7: "What great nation is there, that hath Elohim so so near (קרבים) unto it as YHWH our God whenever we call upon upon upon Him (אליו)," and in 2 Sam. 7.23: "And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one on earth, whom Elohim went (הלכו) to redeem unto Himself (לו) for a people." The dualism implied in Dan. 7.9: "(I beheld) till thrones (!כרסו) were placed and One that was ancient of days took His seat" is accounted for by R. Johanan on the ground that "God does naught without consulting His heavenly family (פמליא של מעלה) i. e. the angels,111 as it is said (Dan. 4.14) 'the matter is by the decree of the watchers (angels) and the sentence is by the word of the holy ones.' Why the two thrones? One for Himself and one for David (the Messiah). Another explanation is: one for justice {din) and one for charity (zedaka) R. Simlai made a similar reply to the Gnostics who asked him: "How many gods created the world?" "Do you ask me? Why not inquire of Adam, as it is said (Deut. 4.32): 'For ask now of the days past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man (Adam) upon the earth.' " The Hebrew verb "created" is written not in the plural (בראו) but in the singular (ברא). To their retort that the word Elohim in the opening verse of Genesis indicates a plural, he pointed out that the verb "created" is in the singular."3 111 The final decision, however, is His own.

Because it tells the whole account of creation, and records that God was before all, so that all the generations may know that the Holy One existed before the world and that by His good counsel He created the world and all its creatures and not by the counsel of any of His creatures, and that He Himself rules the world."5 The rabbinic rejection of Gnostic doctrine is sharply stated in the Sifre to Deut. 32.39: "See now that I, even I, am He." "This is the response to those who say that there is no sovereignty in heaven (i. e. that the high God is above human contacts). To him who asserts that there are two sovereignties in heaven the reply is: 'And there is no God with Me.' Should one maintain that God can neither revive nor kill, do neither evil nor good» it is affirmed: 'I kill and make alive,' etc. And it is stated by the prophet: 'Thus saith the Lord, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer the Lord of Hosts: I am the first, and I am the last, and besides Me there is no God.'

All other expressions likewise bring out the title of one and the same Being, as for example, the Lord of Powers, the Father of all, God Almighty, the Most High, the Creator, the Maker, and such like.""7 At the same time the Church Fathers adapted the dualistic claims of the Gnostics to their doctrine of Jesus as the second deity. They based their argument on Ex. 23.20-21,23 where God says of His messenger who should lead the Israelites into Canaan, "My name shall be upon him." "The messenger's name was Joshua, the same in the original as Jesus. Starting from this and assuming, rather than admitting, that much which was narrated could not be understood of the Supreme Being, they alleged an idea nowhere even hinted in the New Testament, that the God who had appeared to the Patriarchs and spoken with Moses, was a subordinate being and was none other than Jesus in a pre-existent state.""8 Justin Martyr tells Trypho: "I will endeavor to prove to you from the Scriptures, that he who is said to have appeared to Abraham, to Jacob, and to Moses, and is called God, is another god (that is, divine being), different from God who created all things, another, I say, numerically, not in will, for I affirm that he never did anything at any time, but what it was the will of Him who created the world, and above whom there is no other god, that he should do and say." Justin continues: "Scripture mentions another god and lord, subordinate to the Maker of all things, who is also called angel (i. e. messenger) because of his announcing to men whatever the Maker of all things — above whom there is no other god — wishes to announce."

Neither Abraham, therefore, nor Isaac, nor Jacob nor any other man, ever saw the Father, the ineffable Lord of all, even of Christ himself; but they saw him who, through the will of the Father, was a god, His son, and likewise His angel, ministering to His purpose."121 Adjusting Prov. 8.22-36 to his Christian theology, Justin writes: "God has begotten as a Beginning before all His creatures a kind of Reasonable Power from Himself, which is also called by the Holy Spirit, the glory of the Lord, and sometimes Son, and sometimes Wisdom, and sometimes Angel, and sometimes God, and sometimes Lord and Word." He repudiates the Jewish suggestion that Gen. 1.26 means that God merely said let us make to Himself, as well as the opinion that the words were addressed to the angels, and maintains that "this offspring, which in "י Dialogue with Trypho 56, 60. 120 Cf.

Justin Martyr argues that when fighting Araalek, with Jesus (Joshua) the son of Nun leading the battle, Moses prayed with his arms extended in the form of a cross. If his arms were lowered, thus destroying the figure, the battle went against the Israelites, but as long as the figure was preserved they prevailed. Their final victory was due not to the prayer of Moses but because, while the name of Jesus was in the van of the battle, Moses standing or sitting with his arms extended exhibited the figure of of a cross. The rock on which he sat, Justin takes as a symbolic reference to the Christ. See Huidekopper, op. cit., p. 345; n. 36. Tertullian follows Justin's interpretation of the battle with Amalek. The brazen serpent set up on a tree by Moses was an exhibition of the devil on the Lord's cross. Adversus Judaeos, 10.

He strongly condemns idolatry on grounds of Old Testament teaching. His treatise "On Idolatry" (written about 200 c. E.) contains nu merous points of kinship with the Mishna Aboda Zara.123 His refutation of Marcion proceeds from what he calls "the Christian verity" that "God is not, if He is not one." "The conscience of all men" acknowledges that "God is the great Supreme, existing in eternity, unbegotten, unmade, without beginning, without end." "That Being which is the great Supreme, must needs be unique (unicum — alone of His Kind), by having no equal." "How, therefore," Tertullian asks, "can two great Suprêmes co-exist, when this is the attribute of the Supreme Being, to have no equal — an attribute which belongs to One alone, and can by no means exist in two?" "Nature itself, therefore, if not an Isaiah, or rather God speaking by Isaiah, will deprecatingly ask: 'To whom will ye liken Me? (40.18, 25)' " Furthermore, on what principle, he demands, "did Marcion confine his supreme powers to two? ... If there be two, why not more? Because if number be compatible with the substance of deity, the richer you make it in number the better. Valentinus was more consistent and more liberal; for he having once im agined two deities, Bythos and Sige, (depth and silence), poured forth a swarm of divine essences, a brood of no less than thirty Aeons, like the sow of Aeneas.124 Now, whatever principle refuses to admit several supreme beings, the same must reject even two, for there is plurality in the very lowest number after one. After unity, number commences. So, again, the same principle which could admit two could admit more. After two, multitude begins, now that one is exceeded."125 The argument that Scripture applies the name god to beings 122 Ibid. 60, 61, 62. See A.

COHON [38] besides God126 is dismissed by Tertullian as frivolous, for the question at issue is not that of words but of essence.127 On the other hand, as an apologist of Christianity, Tertullian takes the position that "the designation of God as one in the prophetic scriptures is intended as a protest against heathen idolatry, but does not preclude the correlative idea of the Son of God, with whom 'He stretched out the heavens alone.' "128 In his polemic against Praxeas, he writes that sometimes the devil aims "to destroy the truth by defending it." Out of the doctrine of the unity of God the heresy has been fabricated "that the Father Himself came down into the Virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself suffered, indeed was Himself Jesus Christ." In opposition he sets forth the "rule of faith" that "there is one only God, but under the following dispensation, or οικονομία as it is called, that this one only God, has a Son, His Word, who proceeded from Himself, by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made. Him we believe to have been sent by the Father into the Virgin, and to have been born of her — being both Man and God, the Son of Man and the Son of God, and to have been called by the name Jesus Christ." In the face of the claim that one can believe in God's unity only by assuming that "the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are the very selfsame Person," Tertullian maintains that "the mystery of the dispensation (οικονομία) is still guarded, which distributes the Unity into a Trinity, placing in their order the three Persons — the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: true, however, not in condition, but in degree, not in substance, but in form; not in power, but in aspect; yet of one substance, and of one condition, and of one power, inasmuch as He is one God, from whom these degrees and forms and aspects are reckoned, under the name of the Father, and the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Tertullian defends himself against the charge of dualism or tri-theism by taking refuge in the concept of monarchy as applied to God.

The spirit is the "third from God and the Son, just as the fruit is third from the root, or as the stream out of the river is third from the fountain, or as the apex of the ray is third from the sun." With the Trinity as his basic doctrine, Tertullian proceeds to reinterpret the 0. T. along the lines followed by Justin. It is the Son of God that spoke to Moses and said to the people: "Lo, I send my messenger before thy face" who shall guard thee in the way and introduce thee into the land which I have prepared for thee. "Attend to him ... for my name is upon him." The Son or the Logos was the minister of God in creation and in all His subsequent works. Whatever actions are ascribed to God in the 0. T. refer to him. It is he who descended to converse with men, from the time of Adam to that of the patriarchs and prophets.129 The references to the Messenger in Justin and Tertullian throw light upon the following dialogue reported in the Talmud. Rab Idit was asked by a min (i. e. a Gnostic or a Christian) regarding Ex. 24.1: "And unto Moses He (God) said: Go up unto YHWH." This seems to indicate that the God who spoke must be distinguished from YHWH. Otherwise the verse should have read: "Come up unto Me." He replied: "Metatron spoke these words, for his name is the same as his Master's, as it is said of the angel who was to guide Israel on the way to the promised land (Ex. 23.21): 'for My name is in him.' " "In that case," the min continued, "he should be worshipped." "It is written (vs. 21): 'Do not exchange Me for him (literally, 'be not rebellious against him').' " "Why, then, does Scripture state 'for he will not pardon your transgression'?130 'By our faith!

In the Apocalypse of Abraham Jaoel (Yahoel) figures as the teacher of the patriarch, explaining to him the mysteries of the Merkaba and of the last judgment.133 He tells Abraham: "I am Yahoel... a power in virtue of the ineffable Name that is dwelling in me."134 After Enoch's trans formation into Metatron, he was identified in mystic circles with Yahoel, whose name leads the list of seventy-two names of Metatron that came down from Gaonic times.135 The name "lesser Yaho" figures in Gnostical writings and has been retained also in Merkaba literature.136 Kirkisani claims that the text in Sanhédrin 38b referred to Metatron as the "lesser YHWH." G. Scholem suggests that the name was deliberately eliminated from the Talmudic text because of its heretical connotation.137 132 Kohler, Art. "Angelology," J. E. I, 594; Frank, Kabbala, p. 43; Jellinek, B. H., II.30. 133 The angel Jaoel also taught Abraham the "Song of Unity" based on "a midrashic development of the divine attributes and character as deduced from the various names of God (El, Shaddai, Elohim, Jahweh, Sabaoth)."

Scholem cites a ms. in the possession of the British Museum and originating among the Jewish mystics in Germany of the 12th century to the same effect that Yahoel taught Abraham the entire Torah and that he invited Moses to ascend to heaven, "to that angel whose name is like that of his Master. EL YHWH contains the letters of Yahoel." In the Hechalot literature Metatron plays this role. Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, p. 362, n. 107. 133 Alphabet of R. Akiba, ed. A.

In this light the dialogue of R. Idit rejects the thought of any demiurge as inadmissible in Judaism.138 The answers which the Rabbis gave to the claims of the Gnostics also served their purpose in dealing with Chris tians. Specifically, R. Abahu seems to be answering the Christians in his interpretation of the words, "I am the Lord thy God" in the first commandment: "A reigning monarch has a father or a brother. Not so God. 'I am the first' for I have no father; and 'I am the last,' for I have no brother, 'and besides Me there is no God,' for I have no son."139 R. Abahu explains Num. 23.19: "If a man should tell you 'I am God,' he lies; if he says 'I am the Son of Man,' he will regret it; (if he says) 'I will go up to heaven,' of him it is said: 'He has asserted something which he will not make good.' "14° R. Elazar Hakappor comments on this verse: "God foresaw that a certain man born of a woman would arise and seek to set himself up as God. He, therefore, endowed the voice of Balaam with power to travel from one end of the earth to the other that all the nations may hear, warning them against being led astray by that man, for God is not a man that He should lie; and if he says that he is God, he lies. He will further deceive by saying that he will die and then reappear. Of that it is said: 'He asserts that which he will not fulfill.' "14I R. Simlai counters the claim of the Christians replace the name Yahoel as a vox mystica, it gradually usurped its place." While Metatron holds high rank in heaven, no suggestion appears in the classical Merkaba literature that he is to be regarded as being one with the glory that appears on the throne. He even "remains in the position of the highest of all created beings, while the occupant of the throne revealed in ShiurShiur Komah is, after all, the Creator Himself." Ibid., p. 69.

The Bible indicates the embarrass ment caused by the belief in the existence of angels. Thus, with a few exceptions, the pre-exilic literary prophets and Deutero Isaiah, the Deuteronomic and Priestly Codes consistently avoid references to angels. On the other hand the E document and to a lesser degree J, Isa. 6, and the post-exilic books of Ezekiel, Haggai, Zech. 1-8, Malachi, Isa. 14, a few Psalms, 1 Chron. 21 and above all Daniel assigned great prominence to angels in their theological conceptions.147 While the Hasidim and the Phar isees adopted the belief, the conservative Sadducees persisted in negating it.148 The belief in angels derived from several causes. First, there was the need of harmonizing the lingering survivals of defunct polytheism with the pure faith of monotheism. Accordingly, the gods of the nations and the deified forces of nature were sub ordinated to YHWH, the universal God. Stripped of their independencè, they reappeared as the guardian princes of nations and of individuals, and as angels of fire, rain, snow, wind, healing, death, etc.14" Second, with the growing transcendence of God, it became necessary to bridge the gap between Him and the world.

Foreign religious influences contributed further to this conception. In the Babylonian pantheon the chief deity was attended by nu merous subordinate deities. Persian dualism surrounded Ormuzd and Ahriman with retinues of good and evil spirits or angels. As the King of Kings, YHWH rules over all. Even Satan in the prologue of Job, as in Zech. 3.1-2, while acting as "the district attorney of heaven," operates under God.152 Rabbinic angelology carries forward the biblical ideas on the subject. The Mishna as the authoritative code of normative Judaism, follows the pre-exilic Prophets, the Deuteronomic and Priestly Codes in avoiding all reference to angels.13" Other Tannaitic compilations, too, are reserved with regard to them.154 On the other hand, the Haggada, presenting much of the mystic lore of the Rabbis, abounds in angels. The angelology cultivated by the Essenes and Hasidim and which reached fantastic pro portions in the books of Enoch, Jubilees and the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs and other apocalypses, found adherents among leading Pharisaic teachers. Akiba and Ishmael b. Elisha were adept in the esoteric lore of the "Chariot" and the pamalia shelshel maala. The lore dealing with "Creation"—as part of the Jewish Gnosis — originally confined to initiates, came to be shared by wider circles and was even imparted in popular 1s" Ex. 23.20-23; 32.34.

R. Simeon b. Lakish states: "The names of the angels were brought from Babylonia. Before the Exile, Isaiah spoke merely of seraphim or fiery angels (i. e. they were nameless). After the Exile we have 'the man Gabriel,' 'Michael Prince.' "136 Historical criticism cor roborates the correctness of this observation. It is in Daniel that names of angels first appeared. From Babylonia came the distinc tion between the upper and lower spirits, and the "four angels of the presence of the Lord," who stand near the crystal throne of God, which is encircled by fire and surrounded by Seraphim, Cherubim,Cherubim, and Ophanim. They seem to correspond to the Baby Ionian rulers of the four parts of the earth.157 The seven archangels,158 too, may correspond to the Babylonian seven planetary spirits or possibly to the Parsi Amesha Spentas and the Fravashis.15' Under Parsi influence the fallen angels of Gen. 6.1-4 and Isa. 14 and Azazel of Lev. 16.10160 combine with popular animism to form the hosts of destructive angels (מלאכי חבלה) or demons, headed by Satan or Samael, who is identified with the angels of death, Asmodeus and Lilit.161 The good angels are of numerous kinds. Ben Sira had anticipated the book of Daniel in teaching that "for every nation He (God) appointed a ruler" (17.17, cf. Deut. 4:19-20). As Gen. 10 names seventy nations, the belief arose that there are seventy guardian princes in heaven.162 During the building of the Tower of Babel, '55 Cf. בית דין של מעלה, Mak. 13b. 1s6 Jer. R.

COHON [46] God called the seventy angels that surround His throne of glory and asked them to join Him in confounding men's speech. Hence the text reads (Gen. 11.7) not " I shall go down" but "Let"Let us go down." Having divided humanity into separate nations possessing different languages, He then cast lots for them.163 In consequence, Abraham and his seed fell to the portion of God Himself, whereas each of the seventy angels became the guardian of a separate nation.164 While Ben Sira and the Book of Jubilees (15.32) similarly speak of God as the guardian of Israel, the example of Daniel who names Michael in this capacity, is also followed in the Haggada. As his name is linked with God (mi-cha-el, "who is like God?"),165 he is considered the sarsar zaba or captain that came to Joshua (5.15) to help him fight Israel's battles, who smote the hosts of Sennacherib (2 Kings 19.35), and who will arise to help Israel in the future.166 The destiny of the nation is interlinked with that of its heavenly guardian. God does not punish a nation before He punishes its heavenly guardian.167 As in Dan. 10.20, the guardians fight against each other in the interest of their peoples. The hostility of the nations toward Israel is reflected by the hostility of their guardians toward Michael. They side with Egypt against Israel, but God takes Israel's part. Jacob saw them in his dream, ascending and descending the ladder, and feared that they would ever oppress Israel.168 With the council of the seventy-one, God sits in judgment over the nations.16' Michael who is described in Dan. 12.1 as "the great sar" is not only the head of the guardian angels but also the Prince of the Divine Presence, sar hapanim (cf. Isa. 63.9) and the sar sar haolam, the Prince of the World. The same titles were appropriated for Metatron. Not only is "his name like that of 163 Ibid. !64 Pirke R. Eliezer 24 and Jer. Targ.

Among the seventy names of Metatron are: Yahoel, Yehadriel, Akatriel, Yefefiel and Yeshaiah.172 As there are "Princes" over the nations so there are "Princes" over the elements: Gabriel of fire, Yurkemi of hail, Ridia of rain, Rahab of the sea, Ben Nez (cf. Job 39-26) of the winds, Lailah of the night and of conception, Dumah of death and of hell (also of fire).173 The names of these princes are often formed by the Hebrew name for a nature force or element of life with the addition of el. Thus we have names like Baradiel, Ruhiel, Barakiel, Zaamiel (zaewz-storm), Zikiel (comet), Raashiel (earth quake), Shalgiel, Matariel, Shamsiel, Lailael, Kochbiel, etc.174 The vastness of the angelic hosts may be estimated from the saying of R. Simeon b. Lakish: "There are 12 mazzalot (signs of the zodiac), each mazzal has 30 armies, each army 30 camps, each camp 30 legions,175 each legion 30 cohorts, each cohort 30 corps, and each corps 365,000 myriads of stars under its care."176 Still another opinion estimates their number at 496 myriads, corresponding to the numerical value of the Hebrew 170 Yeb. 16b; Sanh. 94a; Hub 60a. 171 B.

Neither were they among the six things decided upon before creation. In the view of R. Johanan they did not come into existence until the second day when the winds were created (cf. Ps. 104.4), and in the opinion of R. Hanina not until the fifth day, when the winged beings were fashioned. R. Isaac adds: "All agree that they were not created on the first day that it may not be claimed that Michael was stretching the heavens to the north and Gabriel to the south, while God was fastening them in the middle, but 'I am the Lord that maketh all things; that stretched forth the heavens alone; that spread abroad the earth by Myself' (Isa. 44.24). 'By Myself' is written: מי אתי, meaning 'who was with Me as partner' in the world's creation?"180 Though He consulted them regarding the creation of man, He did not follow their advice.181 Still another view is expressed that from every utterance issued by God an angel is created, as it is said: "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their hosts" (Ps. 33.6).182 (Philo similarly conceived of angels as Logoi.)183 It was believed that angels are י" S.E.R.

From these tasks they derive their names.186 In the words of the Yozer: "He is the creator of the ministering angels who stand in the height of the world and together pro claim in fear the words of the living God and the universal King. All of them are beloved, all of them are pure, all of them are mighty, and all of them do in awe and in fear the will of their Master.

And all of them take upon themselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, one from the other, and they give permission one to the other to sanctify their Creator in tranquil spirit, with pure speech and holy melody. They respond in unison and exclaim in awe: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory."187 They join Israel in crowning God with their adora tions.188 To emphasize still further that angels exist only for the glory of God, the belief was expressed that a new body of sends His own words or angels for the sake of giving assistance to those who love virtue" (On Dreams 1.12).

In the Valentinian school the Demi urge takes the place of the seven. These are half-evil, half-hostile powers frequently named "angels." They are reckoned as the last and lowest emana tions of the Godhead. Below them — and frequently considered as derived from them — comes the world of the actually devilish powers. The Mandean speculations present a different and perhaps more primitive conception of the seven, according to which they, together with their mother Namrus (Ruha) and their father (Ur) belong entirely to the world of darkness. They are regarded as captives of the god of light, who pardons them, sets them on chariots of light, and appoints them as rulers of the world. While in Babylonian religion the planetary constellations are reckoned as the supreme deities, in Gnosticism they are subordinate, half-demonic powers, or even completely the powers of darkness. This development Bousset ascribes to the victory of Parsism over the Babylonian religion, reducing its deities into half demons or into demons. These seven are the creators of the material world, which is separated from the light-world of the good God. (See Bundahis III.25; V.i; Bousset, op. cit.). י" See JQR o. s. IV, 247. R. Jehuda b.

That is, God Himself takes care of them, as is borne out by Gen. 30.22; Deut. 28.12 and Ezekiel 37.13. On the basis of Ps. 145.16, the key of sustenance was added to the above. Prayers for these bounties must be directed to no angel but to God.196 These admonitions were necessitated by popular practice. Indeed the miracle-working Essenes and Hasidim and subse quently the Cabbalists put their angelology to practical uses to enlist the celestials as man's helpers. Names of angels even found a place in the public liturgy of the synagogue despite the protests of rationalistic leaders.197 Angels serve in Rabbinic thought as the agents of God's reve lation, providence, and retribution. They communicate knowl edge to chosen individuals. Only to Moses God spoke directly without the mediacy of an angel or a messenger.198 They guard and protect men, intercede in their behalf and carry their prayers to the throne of God. They also record men's evil deeds, and act as instruments of divine wrath. "Angels of peace" accompany the righteous dead to their resting place (as in Isa. 57.2; 58.8), while "destructive angels" follow the wicked (as in Job 33.22 and Ps. 35.6).199 Despite their supernatural character, R. Johanan voices the opinion that "the righteous are superior to angels." Though subject to the Evil Yezer they do God's will. The ministering angels do not begin their song of praise in heaven until Israel offers homage to God on earth.209 195 Jer. Ber. 9.1 (13a). Cf. Rev. 22.8-9. 196 Ta'an. 2a; Jer. Targ.

COHON [52] The Rabbinic endeavor to defend the doctrine of monotheism on Scriptural grounds holds a significant place in man's struggle for a pure vision of God. The Rabbis scrupulously guarded the faith of the Torah and the prophets, and devotedly pre served its light for future generations. Divine Unity connoted for them, as it does for all monotheists, not merely God's nu merical oneness, excluding divisions and distinctions in His personality, but also His spiritual oneness, absolute complete ness and perfection. Only such a God satisfies the quest of the soul for unity amid the multiplicity and chaos of things, and for the unifying goal and purpose toward which humanity must strive if it is to attain spiritual soundness. To the minds of the Rabbis as to those of the masters of the Bible, God appeared as unique, incomparable to anything in human experience. All similes used to picture Him must be taken as mere figurative devices to make Him real to men. While He may not be touched by the senses, He is near to the heart that longs for Him and to the spirit that reaches out after Him. The term which, since Tannaitic times, has come to designate Him in Jewish usage, is Hakadosh baruch hu —"the Holy One, praised be He." Beyond all other designations, He is "the Holy One," removed from all impurity, imperfection, and evil, and embodying within His character all goodness, truth, righteousness, and compassion. In the words of Hannah's prayer: (I Sam. 2.2) "There is none holy as the Lord, for there is none besides Thee; neither is there any rock like our God." Appendix Midrash Otiyot R. Akiba, Aleph, states that when God saw the wickedness of the men of the generation of the flood, He removed his Shechina from their midst and ascended to heaven, amid shouting and the blast of the shofar (as in Ps. 47.6). He took Enoch from among them and raised him up amidst the sound of the shofar to act with the four Hayyot of the Merkaba as guardians of His treasures in heaven, and transforming him into Metatron, appointed him chief of the princes in heaven, minister of God's throne.</page><page sequence="53">[53] THE UNITY OF GOD 477 This legend shows the connection between Metatron and the blowing of the shofar on Rosh Hashana. A private prayer recited during the ceremony reads: "May it be Thy will, 0 Lord my God and God of my fathers, that the blasts of the Tekia, Shebarim, Tekia, which we blow this day be wrought [by the angel Tartiel] into Thy throne of glory, [even as Thou didst receive — i. e. Israel's prayers — through Elijah of blessed memory and JeshuaJeshua Sar Hapanim — Prince of the Presence — and the Prince Metatron]. And mayest Thou be filled with mercy toward us. Blessed be Thou, O Lord of mercy." The composite nature of this prayer is quite apparent. Like the other cabbalistic additions to the Shofar Service, it comes from the school of Isaac Luria (1534-1572), and is based on the angelology of Sefer Raziel, in the German-Polish rituals, but in no Sephardic or oriental ritual. Its earliest appearance, as far as I have been able to trace, is in Herz Treves' cabbalistic prayer book (Thiengen 1560), where the words which I have bracketed are omitted. In a note, Herz utilizes an older cabba listic interpretation of the shofar blasts, presenting the nu merical value of their Hebrew names as equivalent to the names of certain angels. Among others, it reads: "The numerical value of Elijahu Hanabi Zachur Latob corresponds to the numerical value of the abbreviations KRK (Tekia Terua Tekia), i. e. 4°° = 471 = לטוב + 233 = זכור+68 = הנביא+52 = אליהו] ) 400 = קר"ק) • It also equals Jeshaiah (ישעיה with the addition of a ה for God, which is a component part of names for angels), which is the name of Metatron. With slight variations this note is printed in most of the later editions which include the prayer. None of the other early editions of the Ashkenazic liturgy, which I have been able to examine (viz. Pesaro, 1517! Augsburg, 1536; Bologna, 1540; Sobieneto, 1552; Cracow, 1585; Than hausen, 1594, etc.), contains cabbalistic additions to the Shofar Service. The Venice edition of 1567, in the possession of the Hebrew Union College Library is most instructive. Like the other early prints, it is free from the cabbalistic additions. A former owner of the copy, whose name is given as Lewa of Bonn but whose dates are not indicated, inserted a page in handwriting, supplying the prayers which had come into use</page><page sequence="54">[54] 478 SAMUEL S. COHON after the publication of the volume. The text of the prayer follows that of Herz Treves. In a distinctly different hand there was added later, above the line, the part which I bracketed. Next I find the Prague ritual of 1612 (3rd ed.) presenting the entire text, but it reads Joshua (יושוע). The subsequent edition (4th), which appeared soon thereafter, corrects the name to JeshaiahJeshaiah (ישעיה"ה). The Sulzbach ed. of 1699 has Jeshua (ישוע) and the Venice ed. of 1711-15 reads Joshuaiah (יושועיה). In course of time the reading Jeshua was standardized. In all of these and in subsequent editions, the explanatory note to which I referred above remains the same, viz. that Jeshaiah is a name of Metatron. The name Jeshua is the shortened form of Jehoshua, as is clearly shown in Neh. 8.17. The variations, which I have de tailed, may be due either to some printer's manipulation or to some cabbalistic vagary. Obscurity, it must be remembered, is the very atmosphere of Cabbalah. Since Metatron was believed to have shared God's seventy or ninety-two names, Jehoshua Jeshua may have been one of them. The ground for my con jecture is the fact that both Metatron and the conquering hero are called by the same name Wanr-youth. While one fights Amalek, the other resists the forces of Samael or Satan. Thus the Zohar to Exodus 17.9. In the mystic Sefer Raziel the name of Joshua ben Nun is classed with celestial saints (ed. Wilna, 1881, p. 6). Their union in the prayer during the blasts of the shofar, which are intended to frighten away Satan, is thus understandable. The identification of Jeshua Sar Hapanim with Jesus is pure conjecture. A. Berliner, for example, speaks of the "Sehr ver daechtigte Jeshua Sar Hapanim." Another scholar suggests that some unscrupulous fellow of Christian leanings smuggled the name of Jesus into the Jewish ritual. The zealous Bodenschatz fulminates against the "blindness" and the "stubbornness" of the Jews who failed to recognize that the conceptions which they entertain concerning the fictitious Metatron and Jeshua Sar Hapanim are worthy only of Jesus, and adduces proof from Matt. 11.10; Mark 1.2; Luke 1.7, 76; 7.27, 28; I Tim. 6.15; Rev. 16.14; 19.15, 16. What he and others, whether Christians</page><page sequence="55">[55] THE UNITY OF GOD 479 or Jews, fail to grasp is that common elements (viz. Logos, mediacy, etc.) underlie the conceptions of both Enoch-Metatron and Christ, and that these received different development in the Church and the Synagogue. The cabbalistic insertions have been eliminated not only from the Reform rituals (see Union Prayer Book) but also from some modern Orthodox rituals as well. See, for example, Michael Sachs, Festgebete der Israeliten, Neujahrsfest, Berlin, 1855, pp. 135_6; and Adler-Davis, Service of the Synagogue, New Year, London and New York, 1906, pp. 126-7, and notes on pp. 240-42; Philip Birnbaum, High Holy Day Prayer Book, N. Y., 1951•</page></plain_text>
