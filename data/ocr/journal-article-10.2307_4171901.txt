<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RETURN TO THE CLASSICS BY EDWIN GREENLAW Indications are multiplying that a new classical renaissance is at hand. Various reasons are assigned by those who are taking a part in the move- ment: a reaction against a civilization which was not strong enough to prevent a world upheaval; parallels between the scepticism and rejection of authority of our time and the intellectual freedom of the Greeks; a more accurate comprehension of the thought of Euripides or Horace, with which we are just beginning "to catch up "; or, finally, a belief that the Greek, or the Italo-Roman ideal is "the hope of the world." These and other reasons are assigned; it is at least pleasant to get away from the old arguments that one should study Latin because so many technical terms in Botany and medicine are derived from that language, or the debates on the relative proportion of Anglo-Saxon and Latin in the vocabulary of Milton or the pages of the Authorized Version. The Ameri- can Classical League is spending $125,000 on an inquiry into the teaching of the classics in the United States, and has announced the number of pupils in the high schools and colleges who are enrolled in classical courses. For some years now, the Loeb Library has made it possible to review one's college courses or to pursue, under pleasant circumstances, the study of authors formerly known only by name to A.B. candidates. One of the most active of the research groups in the Modern Language Association is that devoted to the study of medieval Latin; it has established relations with the American Council of Learned Societies and with the American Historical Association, and has published a combined directory and biblio- graphy of scholars now engaged in the field of medieval studies. These are but scattered instances. Others might easily be added, such as the increasing popularity of courses in comparative literature in which the classics are read in translation, and the multiplication of books and even series of books in which aspects of classical influence are studied. There are two principal ways in which a classical revival, if we are to have one, may be brought about. One of these is through the study of the original language. Classical scholars, with their disciples, are the flamens of this ritual. Such a method depends upon a cult for its continuance. It is a mystery. Its influence on the general must be furthered through secret channels. The other way is through translation. Now translation does not mean merely the substitution of one set of symbols for another. It is a process of interpretation leading to assimilation-the merging of one culture with another. Such a process took place during the Renais- sance. It was a later phase of humanism, manifested not merely through direct use of the classics but through neo-platonism, through the technique of the drama, through the national epics, through the intellectual freedom of the time and the development of modern institutions. The influence of the classics cannot be measured by so many lines of translation in a day, or by painfully wrought English-into-Latin exercises. 649</page><page sequence="2">650 The Return to the Classics This larger, more formative influence is being fostered today. In large measure, its inception may be traced to the work of men like Gilbert Murray and Ernest Barker. In the translations from Euripides and in his writings on various topics interpretive of Greek culture, Professor Murray has shown the vitality of the classics in the twentieth century. Through his books on Greek political thought Professor Barker has not only given an interpretation complementary to that of Professor Murray but has led the way to the publication of the important Library of Greek Thought. In the present article a number of volumes significant in one way or another in this re-interpretation of classical culture are selected for brief comment. The reviews are not critical, but introductory. The purpose is to point out various examples of an interesting re-birth of classical influence. While the books selected are not so useful to the specialist as to the lay reader, they are capable of aiding powerfully in the development of the interests upon which all study of literature depends. I Instead of source books from which students are to draw their own deductions we find, in the series entitled " Our Debt to Greece and Rome," studies of the influence of the classics through the medieval and modern periods. Of the fifty or more small volumes projected in this series, thirteen have been published.' The purpose of the series, as stated by the general editors, is "to show the influence of virtually all the great forces of the Greek and Roman civilizations upon subsequent life and thought and the extent to which these are woven into the fabric of our own life today." This purpose is carried out through a method common to all the books: an exposition of the significance of the author or of a phase of thought or achievement in ancient times; an account of the manifestations of this influence in the medieval and modern world, and a concluding section on the present time. Often the parallel is simply a resemblance between ancient and modern times, such as Professor Mackail points out in his discussion of Virgil. Other authors in the series speak of the ancient culture as "a constant corrective in the midst of crises," such as "the welter of things resulting from the great war." In such a time, Professor Smith holds, "it should do every one good to turn aside and 1 "Our Debt to Greece and Rome," edited by George Depue Hadzsits and David Moore Robinson.

While only about one-fourth of the projected volumes have been pub- lished, both the range and the quality of the series may be judged. The topics are by no means exclusively literary. Mr. McCartney discusses ancient warfare, by land and sea, in a book based pretty largely on Vegetius but with many parallels drawn from modern military and naval history. The intellectual curiosity of the Greeks is illustrated by Professor Smith in his volume on mathematics. They sought no practical aim, but to discover the secrets of beauty. The usefulness of Astronomy, to Plato, was that "in the midst of these studies an organ of our souls is being purged from the blindness and quickened from the deadness occasioned by other pursuits,-an organ the preservation of which is of more importance than a thousand eyes, because only by it can truth be seen." Mr. Taylor, in his book on Greek biology and medicine, emphasizes the same "clear spirit of scientific investigation." Like modern scientists, the Greeks re. jected all supernaturalism in their effort to find the sources of life. After a brief account of Greek science before Aristotle, Mr. Taylor writes of Aristotle's development of scientific method, his first-hand investigations, his faith in an order in nature, and his usefulness in a modern time when " the vast complexity of research forces most scholars, as well as scientists, into a sort of rodent specialism." Greek religion is discussed by W. W. Hyde especially from the point of view of survivals in Modern Greek. He has little to say about the influence of early religious ideas on the litera- ture and thought of western Europe, but he brings out very clearly the intellectual freedom which led the Greeks, even in their religion, to avoid dogma and creed. In Roman Politics, by Professor Abbott, a scholar widely known for his work in the field of Roman institutions, society, and politics, we have a spirited treatment of a subject important because of the influence of Rome upon modern legal and political institutions. In Language and Philology, R. G. Kent supplies a useful and non-technical compendium, giving good reasons, abundantly illustrated, for the impor- tance of Latin study to an understanding of the English language. It is, however, not through institutions but through personalities that our debt to Greece and Rome is most vital. Such a volume as Professor Showerman's Horace is an admirable illustration. His theme is "a great communion of twenty centuries "; the impressiveness of the story consists in its revelation of what the author calls the dynamic power of Horace, a power which is the property of the few but is at the roots of all human progress. This thesis is developed with eloquence in a book that must inspire the enthusiasm of every reader. The interpretation of the life and thought of Horace, made clear largely through paraphrases of his poems and by Professor Showerman's admirable verse translations, is followed by chapters on "Horace through the Ages" and "Horace the Dynamic." One is tempted to quote passages that illustrate the felicity of style of the author, or to point out examples of his power to handle without pedantry the results of minute research. The book itself is a testimony to the 8 651</page><page sequence="4">The Return to the Classics truth of the author's statement that the immortality of literature and the arts is "the work of the passionate few whose enthusiasms and protesta- tions never allow the common crowd completely to forget, and keep forever alive in it the uneasy sense of imperfection." Mr. Showerman's book has sent at least one reader back to his Horace. To the writing of his account of Virgil, Professor Mackail has brought the fine qualities apparent in his earlier writings on poetry, as well as his experience as a translator. The outstanding quality of his book is that it is a treatise on the nature and mission of poetry, the work of Virgil being drawn upon for illustration. His treatment of Virgil in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance is less satisfactory. The task was a difficult one, partly because of the great amount of material, but no ancient writer save Aristotle has exerted such a tremendous influence, and it is precisely this topic that we should expect to find the principal part of the treatment of Virgil in a series such as the one in which Mr. Mackail's volume appears. Instead, we find rather vague treatment of such topics as "Virgil's World, its meaning for and its likeness to our own world" and "The Italo-Roman ideal, created by Virgil and continu- ing to our own day, as the hope of the world." Even these topics, ambi- tious as they sedm, are briefly and somewhat mechanically treated; they do not compare with the fine analysis of the minor poems that is one of the attractive features of the book. A similar unevenness of treatment is apparent in the volumes on Catul- lus, by Professor Harrington, and Cicero, by Professor Rolfe. The bio- graphy of Catullus is marred by a certain flippancy of style; we come on more solid ground In the chapters dealing with the influence of the poet in the Renaissance and modern times, but even here there is little illu- mination, the treatment consisting, in the main, of parallel passages. In part, of course, this thinness is inevitable; Catullus has no such intel- lectual appeal as Virgil and Horace. Such is not the case, however, with Cicero, whose influence was not only stylistic but philosophical, and was of amazing extent. Yet Professor Rolfe devotes 119 pages to the bio- graphy and contemporary influence of Cicero, and only 49 pages, to the Middle Ages and modern times. Section IX of his book, entitled "The Deistic Movement," begins with Montaigne and the next paragraph treats, with curious results, Ascham, Queen Elizabeth, Sidney, and Samuel John- son. The entire treatment of the subject from the Renaissance on is confused and incomplete. In Mr. Gummere's Seneca, as in most other volumes of the series, we find a well-written and interesting biography. Such a series, however, cannot be tested merely as a group of biographies, since such information may be had in the encyclopedias, nor can it be tested by parallels that may be found or imagined between ancient times and our own. Mr. Gum- mere's treatment of Senecan influence in Chaucer, Montaigne, and Emer- son is adequate for the purposes of a brief handbook; his treatment of Bacon is unsatisfactory, and he does not give us a clear-cut exposition of Seneca's philosophy and scholarship. In this respect his book suffers in comparison with the scholarly and illuminating discussion of Aris- 652</page><page sequence="5">Edwin Greenlaw totle's Poetics, by Professor Lane Cooper. Here we have a brief but very clear statement of what the Poetics is, the plan of the work, and defini- tions of the principal terms. All this is accomplished in 62 pages. So, too, the treatment of the influence of the Poetics since the Renaissance, while owing much to the work of Spingarn and others, is built on the foundation laid by the preliminary exposition, so that the book as a whole conforms admirably to the plan of the series of which it is a part. Pro- fessor Cooper introduces little that is new, of course, and little that he has not presented more extensively in his other books, but he has made a very useful introduction to an important subject, and his treatment of it is truly Aristotelian, having "a beginning, a middle, and an end." High praise, also, can be given to the last book to be mentioned here, Euripides, by F. L. Lucas. The introduction, by R. W. Livingstone, gives the point of view of the series in terms that show how thoroughly he has grasped the idea of the general editors. Euripides is important to our times, he says, because of recent translations that have made him almost a contemporary of ours, and also because the twentieth century sees in him its own critical spirit, its hatred of cruelty and religious shams, its sympathy for women and for the oppressed. Mr. Lucas states his theme in the assertion that "the working of a great spirit is a silent, subtle thing"; its influence is displayed not merely in the few or many literary works in which we find imitations of the master, but also in ways that are imponderable. Thus Mr. Lucas, like Professor Showerman, brings us into contact with a great spirit. Like Mr. Showerman, also, he has a style of distinction. There are frequent ironic thrusts at mod- ern statesmen and others; he knows, and illustrates by his writing, the difference between pedantry and learning; to him the parallel passage method resembles the work of " some horrible little anchorite building himself a hovel with the noble fragments of an ancient temple frieze." It is not the judgment of literary men upon the classics but the humani- zation of scholarship that has so increased, in recent years, the apprecia- tion of Euripides. One is tempted to quote part or all of the eloquent closing paragraph of this book, but instead here is a passage that illus- trates the point of view of the new return to the classics, and gives hope that as such ideas are extended we may indeed witness a new renaissance: "Indeed, the defence of the classics is not that they are venerable and mouldy antiques, the sources of modern civilization; there is little living water in 'sources'; let the dead bury their dead and pedants pedants. Euripides matters today not as an ancient but as a modern, not because he inspired Menander and Seneca and Plutarch but because he can inspire us. ... For about two millennia he has been too modern for men fully to understand." Some of the limitations pointed out in these brief notes are due to the difficulties of the task assumed by the authors of the books in this series. The life and personality of an ancient author, or the way in which his work was received in his own time, or classical thought on some subject 653</page><page sequence="6">4The Return to the Classics like medicine or warfare, are well done, for the authors of these books are classical scholars of distinction. When it comes to dealing with the delicate and complex questions of classical influence on medieval and modern thought and literature, too many of the writers seem unaware of the mass of learning accumulated by investigators in modern languages and literatures and modern history. Papers that have appeared in the classical journals are duly cited; other studies, in journals of modern philology, appear infrequently. It is surely a prime object of this series to sharpen in us the perception of the continuity of classical thought; the medieval and modern portions of the books ought therefore to be even more carefully done than the biographical and critical chapters. The books are more useful to the general reader than to those who desire a careful appraisal of this stream of influence that courses through the ages. It is pleasant to be able to commend without stint the variety and in- terest of the topics, the intelligence with which the series has been planned, the distinguished character of several of the volumes, and the attractive form in which the publishers have presented the books. II The problem of our debt to the classics is approached from a somewhat different angle in a second series of great importance. It consists of selections from Greek literature, chosen in order to illustrate Greek con- ceptions of history, economics, religion, and other topics, and accompanied by an introduction that is both a commentary and a survey of influence on modern thought. The series is edited by Earnest Barker, of King's College, London, and five volumes have already appeared.2 The two volumes by Mr. Toynbee illustrate very well the method and scope of the series. The books consist of introductions and translations from Greek historical literature. At first sight, therefore, they are col- lections of source material. They are much more than this, however, because of the skill with which the editor has carried out his scheme' of organization. His purpose has been to give the philosophy of life held by a great people and expressed through their historical writings, rather than to supply a connected narrative of the external events. The effect- iveness with which this has been done can scarcely be indicated within the limits of a brief review; only one or two illustrations can be given here. The first volume, Greek Historical Thought, consists of four parts: Prefaces from the Historians; the Philosophy of History; the Art of History, and Epilogues. The titles given to his selections by Mr. Toynbee add greatly to the interest of the book. The section on the philosophy of history, for example, opens with a group of selections under the title of Mutability. This group contains a brief translation from the Iliad 2 "The Library of Greek Thought." New York, E. P. Dutton &amp; Company. Volumes published: Greek Historical Thought, and Greek Civilization and Character, by Arnold J. Toynbee; Greek Economics, by M. L. W. Laistner; Greek Literary Criticism, by J. B. Denniston; Greek Religious Thought, by F. M. Cornford. 654</page><page sequence="7">Edwin Greenlaw 655 by Gilbert Murray, followed by Herodotus' account of the pity of Xerxes for the swift passing of the generations of human life, by Thucydides' account of the defeat of Athens in Sicily, and by several selections from Polybius entitled "The Burden of Macedon," "The Burden of Rome," and "The Fulfillment of Scripture." The suggestion of biblical titles is fol- lowed also in the next group: "The Authorized Version," "The Wisdom of Solon," "The Parable of Polycrates," "The Revised Version," "The Day of Judgment," "The Titan in Harness," and "Rationalism." To the freshness and vitality of the organization of his books Mr. Toynbee adds other qualities. His Introduction should be read by all who are inter- ested in theories of history and theories of translation. "A civilization," he remarks, "is never a mere product of physical transmission or local environment. It is a communion of saints (and of sinners) compassed about by that great and ever-increasing cloud of witnesses that have already joined the majority of mankind; and membership in it is there- fore a matter of spiritual rather than of material affiliations." He finds the materials of history, therefore, in literature as well as in chronicle, on which one may compare Mr. Trevelyan's brilliant essay in the Yale Review for October, 1924, and he makes good his faith by including some admirably chosen translations of Greek poetry by Gilbert Murray. Again, our relations to the past, in view of what has been said above, are seen not to be merely chronological: "The remote past embodied in foreign civilizations may be subjectively nearer to the life of our own day than is the recent past out of which our life has arisen. In other words, chronological priority and posteriority have little or no subjective signi- ficance except within the single span of a given civilization." The pur- pose of his study, he says, is to attempt " to find an equation between two independent civilizations." Upon these ideas of history is based Mr. Toynbee's theory of transla- tion. Since his purpose is to equate two civilizations which, he holds, have much in common, he is interested in "translating (say) Plutarch himself, and not merely Plutarch's writings, from the Hellenic world into ours." Plutarch, he figures, would, if so "translated," have been born in 1846 and "would be destined to die in 1925 as a last great survivor of the Victorians." Therefore, we cannot expect to appreciate Plutarch if we depend solely upon North's or Langhorne's translations. For the selec- tions from all authors included in his book, excepting the poets, Mr. Toynbee has made new translations, clothed in the language of today, seeking to avoid a form which would strike the reader as a translation and not an original. His purpose is to clothe in living language his con- ception of an historical vision that "reveals to us a profoundly significant and profoundly moving repetition of human experience on the heroic scale." The other volumes so far published in this series deal with Economics, Criticism, and Religion. In the first of these, by M. L. W. Laistner, we find an excellent introduction treating of the relation between ethics and politics in Greek thought, and separating, so far as is possible, the eco-</page><page sequence="8">The Return to the Classics nomic and sociological elements. The body of the book contains liberal extracts from Plato and Aristotle, with briefer extracts from Solon, Lysias, Xenophon, Aristophanes, and the anonymous dialogue called Eryxias. Mr. Denniston's volume on literary criticism contains selections repre- senting ten authors: Aristophanes, Antiphanes, Plato, Aristotle, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, "Longinus," Demetrius, Plutarch, Dio Chrysostum, and Lucian. The introduction is an encyclopedic sketch of the development of Greek criticism, dealing mainly, of course, with the ten authors named above. Since much Greek criticism, like Greek economics, is contained not in formal treatises but as a part of compositions belonging to other cate- gories, Mr. Denniston arranges his material according to sources found in comedy, philosophy, rhetoric, and miscellaneous writings The result is that the book is far more interesting than most anthologies of criticism. It begins, for example, with a long extract from Gilbert Murray's spirited rendition of The Frogs. The selections from Plato are not as extensive as those found in the volume in Everyman's Library devoted to Plato's literary criticism, but they are admirably chosen. From Aristotle we have the more important parts of the Poetics and the Rhetoric. Dionysius is fully represented on the subjects of rhetoric and oratory, and about thirty pages are given to the treatise On the Sublime, formerly attributed to Longinus. Mr. Denniston finds, at the conclusion of his survey, the following salient characteristics of Greek criticism: the predominant con- servatism of their theories, especially in comedy-the ancients are uni- versally preferred to the moderns; the delight in technical terminology and elaborate classification-" they exalt technique and training at the expense of genius, individuality, and inspiration "; their reluctance to submit the classics to systematic analysis; and, finally, the total neglect, by the later Greek critics, of Latin literature-they have no interest in the comparison of the two great literatures of their time. The unique value of Mr. F. M. Cornford's Greek Religion is due to the number of selections from a wide variety of literature, the careful organi- zation of the book, and the excellent introduction. Nearly a hundred authors are drawn upon; the arrangement is not chronological but is de- signed to illustrate a certain evolutionary process. From the anthropo- morphism of Homer this evolution moves toward monotheism. This is followed by a return, through the attempts of science to explain the origin of the world, to primitive ideas of a living stuff, immortal in the sense of having neither beginning nor end, but without personality. The belief of the Socratic school in a benevolent creator of the world, the debate between Epicureans and Stoics on chance versus the decrees of Providence, the great utterances of Plato and Aristotle, and an interesting collection of fragments illustrating popular ideas of religion, complete the volume. Read straight through, with proper attention to the headings under which Mr. Cornford groups his material, the book is one of extraordinary interest. This interest is enhanced by the introduction, which explains the method of the book and serves as commentary on the selections. Greek religion 656</page><page sequence="9">Edwin Greenlaw was not formulated by priests or theologians, but by artists, poets, and philosophers, hence the tendency to hold poets strictly to account for their religious and moral sentiments. Plato, coming late in the evolutionary process that Mr. Cornford traces, looks on the anthropomorphic views of the poets as later theologians looked on heretics, and excluded them from his commonwealth. Yet the poets cast into literary form traditional and popular ideas; it is hard to tell, in their writings, how far many of these ideas reflect the true views of the writers, or, indeed, of any large portion of society. This last point, suggestive of the danger involved in too sweeping generalization from special instances, is illustrated by the refer- ence to the All Souls festival of Anthesteria, when the ghosts of the dead were supposed to walk about the city, entering their old haunts, until driven off by the injunction: "Out of the door, ghosts! The Anthesteria is over." This saying became proverbial, being addressed to people who expect a repetition of favors received; it goes back, however, to primitive religious beliefs; it may reflect, also, the belief of certain classes even in fifth century Athens, when the more enlightened had got beyond animism. The book is in no sense a study of folk beliefs, being limited to philo- sophical and literary theology; one of its chief merits is that it thus supplements the work of Miss Jane Harrison and other students of early ritual. Like the other books in this series, it contains a brief but carefully selected bibliography and a useful index. The translations, mainly by Mr. Cornford, are similar to those of Mr. Toynbee, uniting simplicity with vigor; by their individuality and freshness they help to bridge the centuries. III The volumes constituting the two series which we have been surveying are designed for the general reader and for the student who wishes to find, in compact form, guides to the study of the influence of classical authors or materials illustrating Greek solutions of some of the problems of thought. In Ancient Rhetoric and Poetic, by Charles Sears Baldwin,a we find a comprehensive study of a special field. The book is an outgrowth of work that Professor Baldwin has been doing for some years at Columbia, and is one justification for the wide reputation of his courses designed for the training of teachers of college composition. In soundness of scholar- ship and felicity of style it proves that a book based, at least in its origin, upon study of methods of teaching need not be filled with "pedagogy." It belongs to the small shelf of books which contribute to the better understanding of the foundations of the study and teaching of English. Professor Baldwin's purpose, as stated in his preface, is to interpret ancient rhetoric and poetic as a step toward the better understanding of medieval and modern traditions of criticism. His book is not a collection of specimen passages, but an exposition, yet so intimate is the contact between the ancient writer and the modern student that we seem to be dealing with the materials at first hand. The authors whose works are 8 New York, Macmillan, 1924. 657</page><page sequence="10">The Return to the Classics thus explained are chiefly familiar as philosophers or orators; Mr. Baldwin presents their views on composition, one of the greatest of classical arts, and illustrates this technic through an accompanying analysis of repre- sentative poetry and oratory, so that we may understand, inductively, their artistic experience. This experience, he holds, is best approached from their conception of composition. "Rhetoric," he remarks at page 134, "meant to the ancient world the art of instructing and moving men in their affairs; poetic the art of sharpening and expanding their vision." The book begins, therefore with the Rhetoric of Aristotle, which is pre- sented as the art of giving effectiveness to truth. Cicero, accepting this theory, supplements it by his study of rhetoric as the art of giving effec- tiveness to the speaker, while in Quintilian we find a study of the influence of rhetoric on ancient education. Dionysius and the author of the tract on the Sublime are drawn upon for illustrations of the literary criticism of rhetoric. In the second part of the book, which is devoted to Poetic, the chapter on Aristotle is followed by an excellent study of Aristotelian theory as illustrated by ancient drama and narrative. There are also modern in- stances, but the author's chief aim is to ground the student thoroughly in the principles. In this carefully studied analysis of rhetoric and poetic alike there is admirable preparation for the study of classical influences on modern literature. Mr. Baldwin sets out "to re-interpret the Poetic (of Aristotle) in 1924." To do this, he says, we should not merely consider the drama and epic of Aristotle's time but according to Aristotle's inten- tion "consider what makes drama, our own as well as his, and what vitally moves it to possess an audience." Such is the practical purpose of the entire book, which deserves the attention of all who are interested in the teaching and criticism of literature. Akin to the volumes in the "Library of Greek Thought," though pub- lished separately, is Professor Lane Cooper's An Aristotelian Theory of Comedy.4 The book is presented, its author tells us, through belief in the wisdom of "utilizing the riches of the ancient classics for the direct benefit of contemporary life and culture." Few studies of the great types of literature are available, and even when such subjects are presented, it is usually from the standpoint of what Mr. Cooper calls anatomy or from that of evolution, both alike neglecting the end or purpose of the type. The Poetics of Aristotle is a signal exception to this rule; by adding to it a theory of comedy we are put in possession of a complete theory of the genres. Such an addition Professor Cooper has supplied as a companion volume to his amplified version of Aristotle's Poetics. This is done through the sufficiently novel device of re-writing and expanding the Poetics from the standpoint of comedy, Mr. Cooper's idea being that it is possible to construct an Aristotelian omic theory to take the place of the hypothetical second book of the Poetics. To the exposition of what he regards as Aristotle's theory is added a translation of the unique Tractatus Cois- ' New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company, 1922. 658</page><page sequence="11">Edwin Greenlaw linianus, first published in 1839 from a tenth century manuscript, this translation being followed, likewise, by an "amplified version." These two versions, one of them conjectural and the other a commentary on the important and little known tractate, are preceded by an elaborate intro- duction which develops not only the scattered references in the Poetics to comic theory but also draws upon Aristotle's other works. The result is a very thorough synthesis of Greek conceptions of comedy, of high value quite apart from the question whether the theory thus set forth is Aristotle's or a composite, and compelling admiration for the boldness of the attempt and respect for the learning which is brought to bear upon the solution. Professor Cooper's proposal is to study the Poetics as containing, with the necessary alterations, a theory of comedy. In this he admits the importance of the Tractatus Coislinianus, though he does not, like Bernays and others, regard it as more important, from the standpoint of comedy, than the Poetics. Rather it is a schematic presentation of a theory of comedy, probably closely representative of Aristotle's views, and of high importance both in itself and as a guide to the reconstruction of Aristotle's lost work. Mr. Cooper also takes issue with the idea held by Butcher and, less emphatically, by Bywater, that Aristotle undervalued Aristophanes. Aristotle's references in the Ethics to "old" and "recent" comedies may be made clear to the modern reader by comparing the broad humor of the Elizabethan comedies with the innuendo of Congreve. Evidence is cited both from the Poetics and from other works to prove that Aristotle knew Aristophanes as Restoration critics knew the Elizabethans. It is quite impossible here to trace the steps by which Professor Cooper constructs his theory; the book is closely organized, each step in the argument being significant. Yet the structure is surprisingly clear in view of the complexity of the material with which the author deals. In the long introduction, a review of Aristotle's method of arriving at his conception of the ideal structure for tragedy is followed by a statement of the elements in this structure, such as organic unity, plot, ethos, dia- noia, diction, melody, spectacle, etc. The chapter on Plato (the " Socratic dialogue" as comedy) and his influence on Aristotle's theory, and the collation of passages, in the corpus of Aristotle's works, which refer to comic writers, comedies, and the theory of pleasure, laughter, irony, etc., show how carefully Professor Cooper has built up his argument. All of this material, and the expanded version of the Tractate as well, must be kept in mind if one is to read with understanding the expanded version of the Poetics which Professor Cooper has presented from the viewpoint of comic theory. IV If we ask, now, what are the conditions on which a new return to the classics may be brought about, the answer is through translation. It is this that makes significant such books as we have passed under review. But by "translation" we mean something more than the ordinary conno- tation of the word. 659</page><page sequence="12">The Return to the Classics Many classical scholars, we know, insist on -a prolonged study of the ancient languages as the only avenue of approach. Many objections have been made to Gilbert Murray's interpretation of Euripides as romantic and dangerously divergent from a true rendition of Greek tragedy. The same objections will be urged against Mr. Toynbee's theory and practise. Yet there is much in Mr. Toynbee's contention that the Elizabethans are in some respects more remote from us than the Greeks. We get on fairly well with Shakespeare, by dint of much high school and-college study of annotated editions, but is it not true that all of his contemporaries, men rated as high as the master by his own generation, are in truth very remote? Spenser, Bacon, even Milton, require "translation" into modern terms, or they require historical imagination and a study of their period sufficiently intense to enable the modern reader to translate himself back into their times. If we require merely the literal translation of the Faerie Queene into modern English, no matter how accurately prepared the student may be in allusion and vocabulary he will still miss the spirit of Spenser. Is not the same thing true of much college study of the classics in the original tongue? By translation, then, we do not mean the word for word conversion of Elizabethan poetry into modern English nor the word for word con- version of Euripides or Horace. Translation involves either the transfer, through spiritual and imaginative processes, of the modern student back into the past age, or the bringing of the past into spiritual and imagina- tive union with the present. The former process, where it can be attained, is historically the more accurate; the second process is more generative. It was the second process, in effect, which operated so powerfully in England toward the end of the sixteenth century and converted humanism into renascence. It is this second process that is being aided by such books as are now before us. In these books four types or techniques may be distinguished. First is the long familiar method of paraphrase and critical comment, inter- spersed with specimens. To this, of course, other elements are added, such as the history of the influence of an ancient author in medieval and modern times. The second technique involves the conversion of the thought of literary works of past times, the message of a great writer, into modern terms through a re-interpretation which follows closely the original in phrase, but connects and organizes the material in a new form. The books by Mr. Showerman and Mr. Lucas are illustrations. The spi- ritual unity between interpreter and original has a subtle effect on the style of such a translation, so that an effect of originality is produced. By some Pythagorean transmigration the ancient spirit once more ani- mates human clay. The third method is that followed by Mr. Toynbee and, less markedly, by Mr. Cornford. The purpose is to equate two civilizations widely separated in time but repeating, on an heroic scale, human experience. Plutarch becomes neither the fleshless monstrosity of the interlinears nor the archaic survival of Thomas North but a late Victorian born in 1846 and destined to die in 1925. The method has its 660</page><page sequence="13">Edwin Greenlaw 661 dangers; well-used it is uncommonly attractive. It is the presence of this spirit that makes the work of Ernest Barker so stimulating to the modern reader; to a certain extent, also, it explains the immense hold of Gilbert Murray. Fourth and last, there is the method of exact definition, the books by Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Cooper being examples. A literal translation will not always serve; the terms used by Aristotle require careful definition, not interlingual synonyms. Mr. Cornford speaks, for example, of the word theos, often rendered "a god." But the Greeks could speak of the reunion of friends after long absence as "a god"; at times, Mr. Cornford says, it is difficult or impossible to determine the exact meaning of the word. Here we return to the first of the two processes of translation, that which involves our becoming, for the moment, Greeks. That, no doubt, is best, and it is the ideal of the scholar. But the imagination may be awakened, and the generative power of the classics realized, by greater attention than we have been in the habit of giving to such collections as "Our Debt to Greece and Rome " and " The Library of Greek Thought," and books like those of Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Cooper, now happily make available.
