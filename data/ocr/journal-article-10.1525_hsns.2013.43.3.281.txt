<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> LEWIS PYENSON* The Einstein-Picasso Question: Neo-Idealist Abstraction in the Decorative Arts and Manufactures ABSTRACT The theories of relativity in physics and the style known as Cubism in painting found a favorable reception by theoretical physicists, on the one hand, and avant-garde art dealers and patrons, on the other hand, across the seven years before the First World War. The climate in bourgeois Europe contributing to this rapid assimilation of revo- lutionary, intellectual work is examined from the point of view of material culture. Emphasis is placed on Neo-Idealist abstraction in urban decoration and design, with a focus on Oriental carpets, wallpaper, and electrical lighting. Elements from all three domains are found in Cubism, and relativity assimilated both vocabulary and images from newly electrified cities. KEY WORDS: Einstein, Picasso, relativity, painting, Belle Epoque, carpets, wallpaper, electrical lighting, shadows, abstraction, Neo-Idealism NEO-IDEALIST MODERNITY: SCIENCE SPLIT FROM ART Although scholars have long pointed to similarities between Einstein’s relativ- ity and Picasso’s Cubism, few personal connections existed between highly creative, young scientists and pioneering, young artists in the Belle Epoque (1890–1914). Artists did not follow the latest discoveries of scientists, and scientists did not follow the twists and turns of artistic fashion.1 In fact, *Department of History, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI 49008-5334; lewis.pyenson@wmich.edu. 1.Meyer Schapiro, ‘‘Einstein and Cubism: Science and Art,’’ in The Unity of Picasso’s Art, ed.

The locus classicus for this interpretation is found circa 1960 among Neo- Idealist writers, who took their cue from philosopher Ernst Cassirer. In his widely read Essay on Man (1944), reissued in 1962, Cassirer summarized: ‘‘The two views of truth,’’ art and science, ‘‘are in contrast with one another, but not in conflict or contradiction. Since art and science move in entirely different planes they cannot contradict or thwart one another. The conceptual inter- pretation of science does not preclude the intuitive interpretation of art. Each has its own perspective and, so to speak, its own angle of refraction.’’ Science seeks causes for or means with things. ‘‘Art gives us a richer, more vivid and colorful image of reality, and a more profound insight into its formal struc- ture.’’3 Philosopher Susanne Langer, translator of Cassirer’s Sprache und Mythos (1925), elaborated in 1957: ‘‘[T]he abstractive process of art is entirely different from that of science, mathematics, and logic. . . . [Art forms] cannot be revealed by means of progressive generalization; this makes the whole development of art and all its techniques radically different from those of discursive thought.

Neither quantum mechanics at the one extreme, nor psychoanalysis at the other, can be of serious use to a painter, whereas he might draw real inspiration from the morphological science which he neglects.’’6 A complementary Neo-Idealist interpretation came from the literary critic Northrop Frye, who wrote in 1963 that science begins with ‘‘the world we have to live in,’’ while art begins with ‘‘the world we construct, not with the world we see.’’ Thus, for Frye, the sciences were intellectual and the arts were emotional, even though ‘‘a highly developed science and a highly developed art are very close together, psycho- logically and otherwise.’’7 A final example of the chasm separating artistic and scientific creation came from the Neo-Idealist geneticist Conrad Hal Waddington, a member of the British Visible College who spent most of his academic career at the University of Edinburgh.8 His notion of the epigenetic landscape, a visual metaphor for 4.

In his study of the relation between art and science during the twentieth century, first appearing in 1969, Waddington held that modern artists saw pictures of scientific objects and used them as raw material, but ‘‘no artist would—or should—have dreamt of using them unless he was convinced that these images had meaning. There has never been, and I doubt if there ever could be, an Impressionism of the scientific image.’’ Rather, the scientific images ‘‘were taken always as symbols . . . . The artists of the 1890s made no use of such images, just because they saw no reason to believe that images of this kind could be meaningful.’’ So, too, the way that art supported science: ‘‘The scientist does not go to the painter for a representation of scientific objects, but for the enrichment and deepening of his consciousness, which comes when he finds a painter in whom the climate of scientific thought has penetrated into the spirit, leading to the production of works in which some of the deeper, less easily expressible, features of the scientific outlook are ‘shown forth.’’’ Consequently, ‘‘looking at paintings . . . is one of the best ways for a scientist to loosen the joints of his psyche, to ‘roll the bones’ of his ideas, and give himself a chance to dredge up from the obscure internal depths something, which will probably have not the slightest obvious connection with the work of art he has been contemplating—but which may be fresh enough to be worth while.’’ Somehow, knowledge and artifice joined on the psychological level: Science and art ‘‘are in true communication,’’10 a conclusion echoing Frye’s assessment and extending the psychological appeal of Sir Ernst H. - (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1984), 81, 319, where in 1934 Waddington sat on the Provisional Committee on Academic Freedom with J.

P. Snow in 1959. The imprint of Neo-Idealism is clear among influential writers addressing Snow, especially writers who embraced a mystical union of all human activity. In lectures from this time, Aldous Huxley elaborated on the idealism that is common to both scientists and humanists. ‘‘I am inclined to think that philosophically minded scientists like Max Planck are right in conceiving that the two worlds, the abstract and the immediate, are simply aspects of the same reality, that the basic Reality is a neutral monism which is seen from one point of view as atomic physics (for example) and from another point of view as immediate experience of value, love, and emotion.’’ Huxley extended Planck’s idealism to the aesthetic writing of Clive Bell, for whom ‘‘the artist gives order to the world in terms of ‘significant form.’ What he does is to try and perceive the forms inherent in nature and to find a symbolic equivalence for these forms which he then imposes upon the world in order to produce the order which he feels to be so supremely important, and which, indeed, we all feel to be supremely important.’’ Huxley continued: ‘‘The artist seeks to impose this order of beauty and of significant form upon both the external reality and the internal reality within himself. He wants always to see himself in relation to the world and to create symbolically a harmony in which both fit.’’ Huxley held that ‘‘the mathematical relationships within the patterns of the outside world are often very close to or identical with the mathematical relations within the symbolic forms which we find satisfactory in art.’’12 Neo-Idealist writings, notwithstanding their variety, united in separating intellectual production from its setting. Historical scholarship over the past several generations, however, suggests that the setting cannot be dismissed so easily. Relativity was not a product of Singapore, and Cubism did not take shape in Manaus. Commentators from Cassirer onwards lived and wrote in an environment as conventionally bourgeois as the environment of the Belle Epoque, where Neo-Idealist sentiment provided fertile ground for the seeds sown by Einstein and Picasso. 11.

From the artistic side, Michael Fitzgerald has emphasized the 1913 auction at the Hoˆtel Drouot in Paris organized by a group of investors in painting known as the Peau de l’ours: ‘‘As the enthusiasm of [Guillaume] Apollinaire and [Andre ́] Salmon demonstrates, many observers saw the auction at the Hotel Drouot as a vindication of Fauvism and Cubism. Economic success stood as a powerful demonstration of the aesthetic quality that many had doubted. This public achievement also placed avant-garde art in a broad social context that made it a focus of the political debate that would dominate the discussion of art during the First World War.’’13 From the scientific side, Einstein’s relativity received attention as the work of a genius, and relativity is partly responsible for his call to Berlin in 1913–14. Helge Kragh has written that by 1910, Einstein’s relativity ’’was probably accepted by a majority of elite theoretical physicists’’ in Europe, and that it was remarked on by the general public, intellectuals, and nonspecialist scientists only after 1918.14 It would be misleading to imagine, as two commentators do, that ‘‘Ein- stein’s approach to the construction of his Relativity Theory was indeed deeply confusing to many scientists at the time. Like much of the art and literature of the period, Relativity Theory seemed to show little respect for the traditional forms, the established ‘manners’ of presentation.’’15 Before 1914, Einstein’s work appeared in a wide range of scientific periodicals, eliciting much sophis- ticated discussion from theoreticians, experimentalists, and astronomers; group 13.

The quick and favorable reception accorded to both relativity and Cubism by the community best able to appreciate the innovations may be called the ‘‘Einstein-Picasso question.’’ The following pages consider certain features of the climate that allowed for this rapid assimilation of strikingly new work. Beginning with Alois Riegl’s formulation of artistic style and Walter Benja- min’s notions of Modernity, the text introduces the environment in bourgeois, European homes which promoted familiarity with abstraction, contributing to an acceptance of Neo-Idealism and sympathy for symbolic forms. The follow- ing discussion elaborates Sir Ernst Gombrich’s clear summary from 1991: ‘‘One thing is not controversial: many critics who were sympathetic to the avant- garde fell back on their memories of Platonic aesthetics to make Cubism more palatable to their readers. Time and again in the articles and pamphlets of the period the rejection of illusionism is equated with the achievement of a higher truth, a more real reality.’’16 That higher truth, in the view of the physicist Max Planck in 1909, was the physical world picture, a conceptual unity of nature that could be accepted by all physicists and ‘‘all cultures, even unearthly and nonhuman ones.’’17 Pictures of the world no longer needed to mimic what we see. Rather, pictures from the realm of abstraction prescribed reality. In 1938, Martin Heidegger generalized using a metaphor from his time and place: ‘‘The fundamental event of the modern age is the conquest of the world as picture.’’18 For the Neo-Idealist Planck, Positivism was the enemy.With Planck in mind, the following pages minimize the impact of Positivism on early twentieth- century developments in theoretical physics and painting. Einstein in the time around 1900 was seduced by Ernst Mach’s Positivism, and he honored Mach until Mach’s death in 1916. But although he was inspired by some of Mach’s formulations in physics, Einstein left behind Mach’s church—surely so when he labored on general relativity.19 Ju ̈rgen Renn has emphasized ‘‘the gradual 16.

Nineteenth-century painting promoted sense impressions, and artists such as J. M. W. Turner anticipated scientists in applying this insight.21 Late in the century, Alois Riegl saw in the paintings of the prominent Impressionist Max Liebermann a desire to represent the causality of natural phenomena. Riegl championed causal connections deriving from directly perceived phe- nomena. In his essay, ‘‘Mood in Modern Art,’’ Riegl coupled a lack of teleology in the natural world with pure seeing, in the sense of Ernst Mach.22 As Meyer Schapiro emphasized, however, ‘‘Impressionists’ persistent search for vague and supposedly illusory tones in the visual field was not an adherence to scientific teaching—although it was compatible in some features with [the color theories of chemist Michel Euge`ne] Chevreul and the spirit of science—or to the conclusions drawn by the scientists as to what a painter should do.’’23 Regardless of the Impressionists’ possible appeal to scientists, the original devel- opments of early twentieth-century painting elaborated, rather than recorded, sense impressions. - (Berlin: Springer, 2007), 569–604, on 571: ‘‘General relativity is deeply Machian in a sense that unfortunately Einstein never managed to pinpoint accurately.’’ Gereon Wolters, ‘‘Mach and Einstein, or, Clearing Troubled Waters in the History of Science,’’ in Einstein and the Changing Worldviews of Physics, ed.

The movement known as Modernism was a particular intellectual current in Modernity. The general introduction to a thousand-page anthology, widely taught today in schools, uses Kuhnian vocabulary to make the point: ‘‘The Modernist paradigm is generally understood to reflect rational liberal humanism and a belief in progress established during the Enlightenment. This perspective presupposes the possibility of objectivity grounded in fun- damental, intrinsic, and universal (or classic) transcendent values and essen- tial, autonomous, and self-sufficient objects, texts, and actions.’’24 Modernism occupies the high tide of Modernity, from 1860 to 1960. Icon- oclasm and introspection, in Peter Gay’s succinct formulation, characterized Modernism.25 In this perspective, the movement Modernism subverted the epoch Modernity. The abstract notion of a better world, which animated the young Einstein and the young Picasso, has gone into eclipse with the passing of Modernism and Modernity. Arthur I. Miller writes: ‘‘If we are going to say that the trend toward abstraction reflects parallel progress in art and science through the twentieth century, we must be very careful. Progress in art and progress in science are very different, and any comparison is a minefield.’’26 He echoes Jack Burnham’s view: ‘‘Words such as progress and evolution appear to have meaning connected to the history of science but none, or a suspected and slight amount, when attached to art.’’27 Back to Northrop Frye, where the notion of progress separated science from art: ‘‘Everything that does improve, including science, leaves the literary artist out in the cold.’’28 And back to Max Weber: 24.

In art, however, there is no progress in this sense.’’29 A circumspect observer, however, can nevertheless affirm that art and sci- ence in Modernity were related endeavors amenable to ‘‘advancement.’’ Both domains received scholarly attention, with appraisal of their products in terms of originality, felicity of execution, and persuasiveness. Professors lectured on progress in the technologies central to both art and science. Techniques of masters past were studied with profit by acolytes seeking to make original and significant contributions. Furthermore, there were wrong answers in science, just as there were wrong answers in art. Both subjects were taught at univer- sities, entailing the possibility that teachers could fail students for submitting incompetent work. Twentieth-century relativism, to which Miller and Burn- ham allude, was a complex weave. Even as breath was leaving Modernity around 1989, some iconoclastic prophets from the 1960s continued to value the ‘‘advancement’’ of learning. Sir Ernst Gombrich’s insistence on ‘‘the stan- dards of mastery without which there could be no history of art’’ is similar to Thomas Kuhn’s resistance to ‘‘replacing evidence and reason by power and interest’’ in history of science.30 In a Periclean oration at the funeral of Moder- nity, the aura of progress would shine. Its afterglow is visible today. Just as progress was central to Modernity, so there can be no doubt that Modernity venerated ‘‘pure’’ or ‘‘fundamental’’ science, an idealist formulation of knowledge.31 Purity is a leitmotif of both modern science and modern art. 29.Max Weber, ‘‘Science as a Vocation [1919],’’ trans.

STYLE FROM THE BOTTOM UP Matters of the mind, hovering above the corruptible world, continue to exert an attraction on writers concerned with the history of science and art, but in addressing an intellectual revolution by directing attention to ordinary life in the cities of Western Europe and North America, the following pages turn away from phenomena that have frequently attracted historians: mass produc- tion in large factories, enormous metropolises with a proletariat and police force, and military conscription for large armies.34 Not one of these broad, social developments is related to a sensibility favoring abstract images. After all, large factories dotted the land early in the nineteenth century in new and old England and in Belgium, large urban agglomerations have appeared in a num- ber of settings in the past, and the leve ́e en masse allowed the French to conquer Europe, all without much enthusiasm for abstract painting or new mathemat- ical tools. Quite the contrary. Furthermore, by the beginning of the twentieth century, factories, armies, and urban sprawl generated a great deal of unfavor- able comment and significant, idealistic movements for reform. During the Belle Epoque, reformist political notions circulated among avant-garde artists 32.

Both Einstein and Picasso fit squarely in their time by setting out to make their name through innovation. They departed from colleagues of theirs who compiled inventories of the natural, philological, and aesthetic world, and they are distinct from architects of political change, who operated in a world of compromise. Rela- tivity and Cubism were nothing if not radically innovative.37 Radical innova- tion in the realm of ideas characterizes the style of Modernism. Style contains the seeds of its own destruction. At the height of Modernity, Erwin Panofsky identified the term ‘‘style’’ emerging among commentators on art in the seventeenth century to replace the term ‘‘manner,’’ which had come to mean painting by rote or the emancipation of painting from nature; the derogatory connotation of Mannerism followed. Style achieved general mean- ing through the eighteenth-century Neohumanism of Johann JoachimWinck- elmann.38 As for Mannerism, classicist Ernst Robert Curtius generalized: The standard classicist says what he has to say in a form naturally suited to the subject. To be sure, he will ‘‘decorate’’ his discourse according to well- tried rhetorical tradition, that is, he will furnish it with ornatus. A danger to the system lies in the fact that, in manneristic epochs, the ornatus is piled on indiscriminately and meaninglessly . . . . The mannerist wants to say things 35. David Cottington, Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905–1914 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998), makes the general point that political agitation unbuttoned the traditional sensibilities of the bourgeoise. 36.

He prefers the artificial and affected to the natural. He wants to surprise, to astonish, to dazzle.39 Dazzling were Expressionist and Surrealist paintings in the 1920s, and dazzling were the publications in theoretical physics before 1927 that led into the canonical version of quantum mechanics. Curtius experienced these develop- ments, having taken a doctorate at Strasbourg in 1910 and then habilitating at Bonn in 1913, where he taught into the 1950s. It is tempting to locate Curtius’s Mannerist degeneration in the course of Modernism between the world wars. The nineteenth-century art historian Alois Riegl was a key figure in formu- lating our notion of artistic style. He worked in a building designed by the architect and art historian Christian Gottfried Semper, at a post created in part because of Semper’s interest in textiles. Riegl rejected Semper’s belief in an organic unity between style and society, but he shared with Semper a concern for the stylistic unity of particular cultures. For Riegl, it was important to study works that reflected the temper of an age. This was the way to establish Kunstwollen, the time signature of virtuosic artistry. Sir Ernst Gombrich emphasized that Riegl, surrounded by crafts in his professional position, rejected materialist explanations. By 1893, he discussed styles without referring to notions of progress or decline, focusing rather on changing modes of per- ception: ‘‘Every style aims at a faithful rendering of nature and nothing else, but each has its own conception of Nature.’’40 In the judgment of Richard Woodfield, Riegl conflated changes in intellectual history with changes in art history: ‘‘One has to think of a kind of preestablished harmony of autonomous streams, not of the interactions of cogs in a machine.’’41 As shall be seen shortly, Riegl played a roˆle defining popular art in his own time. Historians speak about the common habitus of unarticulated practices, and they hold forth about vague and complex entanglement, histoire croise ́e they call it, complete with what seem to be astrological and econometrical charts. They seek to improve on notions such as worldview, spirit of the times, and 39. Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the LatinMiddle Ages, trans. Willard R.

To mention only one setting often invoked by Modernists, Classical Antiquity, something surely connected Prax- iteles, Pericles, and Plato, but what was it? The search for truth conforming to reality? For arbitrary rules of perfection? For agon, eros, or agape?43 Historians also want to know why the ideas of a particular community change with time. Is it sudden, collective shock in the face of innovation? The summation of a generations-long, socio-economic mutation? The sudden release of civil restraint provoked by calamity? These questions remain in the background to the discussion in the following pages, which nevertheless address the temper of an epoch. Forests have been sacrificed in the name of historical theory. These pub- lications are interesting to us today less for the direction they give to scholars than for the insight they provide about past thought. Theoretical sentiment from many disciplines appears in the work of accomplished historians, but for the most part the resulting histories depend on creative use of source material, rather than slavish adherence to method. ‘‘Be wary of theory,’’ Hermann Hesse’s historian priest Father Jacobus admonished the Magister Ludi, Joseph Knecht, in the future of the twenty-fifth century. It is not irrelevant that the figure Jacobus was modeled on Jacob Burckhardt, the marvelous originator of the epoch called the Renaissance. Nor is it irrelevant that Henri Pirenne, the animating spirit of the periodical that redefined the historical discipline in the twentieth century, Les Annales, although he was inspired by the sociological speculation of Karl Lamprecht, nevertheless raised his generalizations sui gen- eris. At the hands of Hendrik De Man, Pirenne’s original medieval history formed the basis for one of the most significant reorientations of the theoretical doctrine that dominated the first part of the twentieth century, Marxism.44 For all these cautions, it remains that cultural critics and historians, like other people, are attracted to theory. With the help of diverse theoretical doctrines, they have tried to explain why the virtually simultaneous and appar- ently independent innovations of Einstein and Picasso were and are often described with similar vocabulary about abstraction with regard to space and time.

Because he was the first to criticize the means itself of criticism, I conceive of Kant as the first real Modernist.’’ Modernism, in Greenberg’s sense, used methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself . . . . Kantian self- criticism, as it now turns out, has found its fullest expression in science rather than in philosophy, and when it began to be applied in art, the latter was brought closer in real spirit to scientific method than ever before . . . . From the point of view of art in itself, its convergence with science happens to be a mere accident, and neither art nor science really gives or assures the other of anything more than it ever did. What their convergence does show, however, is the profound degree to which Modernist art belongs to the same specific cultural tendency as modern science.45 Greenberg attracted a wide following. His view was embraced by Jack Burn- ham: ‘‘What connects art to science is an abiding similarity between the artistic and scientific mind: it is as if both were motivated by the same pangs of discovery and a desire for the consummation of ideas into beautiful totali- ties.’’46 Focused as he is in the quotation above on spiritual essences, Greenberg inspired intellectual historians. Stephen Kern writes: ‘‘The thematic similarity between developments inspired by technology and those independent of it suggests that a cultural revolution of the broadest scope was taking place, one that involved essential structures of human experience and basic forms of human expression.’’47 Attention in these and other writings is directed to high culture; material culture appears for the most part as background.48 45.

The ‘‘sudden flourishing’’ of abstraction was ‘‘the product of network thinking—of ideas moving through a nexus of artists and intellec- tuals working in different media and in far-flung places.’’ The networked revolution occurred between 1911 and 1912, in the view of Leah Dickerman: ‘‘Beginning in late 1911 and across the course of 1912, in several European and American cities, a handful of artists . . . presented paintings that different from almost all of those that had preceded them in the long history of the medium in the Western tradition: shunning the depiction of objects in the world, they displayed works with no discernible subject matter.’’ Borrowing from Robert K. Merton’s discussion of simultaneous scientific discovery, which Merton locates in the normative institutionalization of science, she offers: ‘‘Abstraction, with almost simultaneous ‘first’ pictures appearing in a scat- tering of places, would seem to follow this model. The answer to the question ‘How do you think a truly radical thought?’ seems to be: you think it through a network.’’ But what made people connect with each other? Dickerman offers both things and ideas as a trigger: ‘‘Cars, photography, relativity, and the death of god haunt scholarly explanations of the emergence of abstraction.’’ In the end, she rejects things and settles on ‘‘broad intellectual developments,’’ ideas appear- ing in print, first of all: ‘‘The nature of perception was being redefined across many disciplines; by 1912, one’s ability to describe the world in terms of a firm correspondence between what was seen and what was known had been thor- oughly shaken.’’49 In this view, ideas flow through networks of people like electricity flows through a regional power grid, a formulation that would surely have appealed to Neo-Idealists in Modernity. - Culture, ed.

Analyses over the past twenty years have favored social relations as the cement holding together a particular resonance or worldview. As can be imagined, following this approach, when social relations change abruptly (as in the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution), new ideas can emerge. There is an evident problem when dealing with the Belle Epoque, simply because the dramatic sociopolitical changes occurring then took place far from Europe: in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America. An enterprise uniting many and diverse twentieth-century historians con- cerned examining historical change from the bottom up, ennobling appar- ently powerless people. Bottom-up history assigns significance to popular choices in cuisine, in costume, in music, and in ornamentation, no less than in ideas. This historical sensibility follows the work of Semper and Riegl, who emphasized that style is what ordinary people assent to; Riegl, indeed, ‘‘inclined particularly to those periods in the history of art where artistic anonymity (by no means identical with biographical anonymity) makes a market appearance.’’51 A critic might offer that taste is imposed on pow- erless people. It is true that people are constrained by parameters not of their own making, and they live within the realm of what is possible to achieve. Yet revolutionaries as distinct as Trotsky and Gandhi understood that change relates to the recognition, by ordinary people, of the power available to them.52 The project of empowering ordinary people is attractive because 50.

One task of historians is indeed to sort out upward percolation from downward trickle. Whether declining fecundity in nineteenth-century Europe originated at the bottom or at the top of society is a question that has occupied clever social historians, and it </page> <page sequence="18"> 298 | P Y ENSON there are so many of them, and also because, as Walter Benjamin empha- sized, approaching history in this way discharges a moral debt owed to previous generations.53 Specialist communities embraced the work of innovative thinkers such as Einstein and Picasso during the Belle Epoque. I suggest that, in their daily life, these communities navigated a sea of abstract ornamentation. Their immersion in abstraction informed the rapid and favorable reception of two revolutionary innovations—Einstein’s relativity and Picasso’s Cubism—at a moment when there was, political agitation notwithstanding, no revolutionary change in pol- itics. The focus on images and ideas is intentionally narrow. Attention is directed away from tropes in painting represented over the centuries before 1900, such as rays of light, puffs of wind, and the blurred movement of natural and mechanical forms; little shall be said about developments in physics and mathematics that would have been known across literate Europe, including wireless, radioactivity, and the ubiquitous fourth dimension. None of these themes in the popular experience, taken separately or added together, can explain why the established community of theoretical physicists embraced special and general relativity and why bourgeois patrons of the arts embraced Cubism. Even though interest here is directed to commonplace abstraction, it should be recalled, with Leah Dickerman, that notions of abstraction formed the center of debates in scholarly fields during the Belle Epoque. Georg Simmel’s sociology emphasized the distinction between the abstraction of society (Gesell- schaft) and the organic unity of community (Gemeinschaft). Emile Durkheim introduced the notion of alienation (anomie) in the modern world. Abstraction dominated the Neo-Idealist revival, above all under the influence of Nobel laureate (1908) and Prussian exchange professor at Harvard University (1912) Rudolf Eucken, which led to writings by Henri Bergson, Benedetto Croce, Aby Warburg, and Ernst Cassirer. In 1908, Wilhelm Worringer, elaborating the writings of Alois Riegl, published his influential doctoral dissertation on abstraction and style in art.54 Late nineteenth-century mathematics was above - relates to Einstein’s life.

What could be more abstract or nonfigural than the Rococo and the Gothic styles?56 For all that, from the quattrocento onward, painting took a decisive step toward verisimil- itude; patrons and purchasers of art wanted paintings that mirrored the world they saw.

Worringer’s dissertation, into a third edition by 1911, became a touchstone of the avant-garde after 1918 for its elaboration of Riegl’s ‘‘artistic volition’’ in terms of abstraction: ‘‘That latent inner demand which exists per se, entirely independent of the object and of the mode of creation and behaves as will to form.’’ Art historians do not generally recognize that Worringer was an ambiguous prophet of abstraction. In Worringer’s view, the ‘‘world picture’’ of abstraction in science (presumably mathematical mechanics) compromised the abstraction of Classical art. In typical Neo-Idealist fashion, Worringer saw art in his own time as splitting from science. ‘‘Its delight is no longer the rigid regularity of the abstract, but the mild harmony of organic being.’’ The new art of the twentieth century, with its figural allusion, was self- confident, ‘‘freed from all compulsion and purpose and the bestower of happiness.’’ Wilhelm Worringer, Abstraction and Empathy: A Contribution to the Psychology of Style, trans.

Directing attention to domestic, abstract ornamentation follows the observation of critic Walter Benjamin that Moder- nity featured a new emphasis on interiors; Benjamin’s unfinished ‘‘Arcades’’ project likened the display of ideas in the Modern Age to the covered com- mercial arcades of nineteenth-century Paris.58 In the domain of the arts, the twentieth century saw the decline of landscape painting coupled with wide- spread interest in distortive representations of rooms and their contents; exem- plary in this regard is the work of Picasso and especially Matisse. In a new departure, works with the word ‘‘room’’ in the title came from the pen of E. M. Forster, E. E. Cummings, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf. Major writings by Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka are restricted to a single interior. Sigmund Freud’s enterprise, however it may be interpreted, involved an inte- rior, literary exploration.59 Science, too, focused on interiors. Field-oriented natural history of the kind that inspired Charles Darwin and Alexander von Humboldt deferred to lab- oratory investigations; laboratory space challenged and then surpassed floor space in natural-history museums, which themselves were interiors devoted to the study and the display of the outside world. Twentieth-century physics laboratories were constructed without galleries for meteorological and astro- nomical observations (typical features late in the nineteenth century) and eventually without windows, as physics became ‘‘inward bound’’ (the title of 57.

By the end of the twentieth century, many of the largest physics laboratories (like the iconic Large Hadron Collider at Geneva, Switzerland) were artificial caverns.60 Three interior areas, during the first decade of the twentieth century, reveal how popular taste affirmed a love of the abstract. The three areas are Oriental carpets, wallpaper, and electrical lighting. They are realms of the decorative arts intended for homes and apartments—the personal side to Benjamin’s Mod- ernist arcades of Paris. In these areas, Einstein and Picasso, through the taste of their family and friends, would have experienced nonfigural abstraction. There was a bipolar relation between the bourgeois home and the avant- garde in art. It is true that, by the eve of World War I, the artistic avant-garde despised paintings for the home. They intentionally produced large canvasses that were difficult to display in a domestic setting. For the Russian Construc- tivist Alexander Rodchenko, nonobjective painting was ‘‘the street itself, the squares, the towns and the whole world. The art of the future will not be the cozy decoration of family homes.’’ Dada artists and Surrealists were also antag- onistic to the home. Andre ́ Breton wrote, ‘‘The street is the only valid field of experience.’’ By 1938, the Chilean artist Roberto Matta, in the Surrealist peri- odical Minotaure, was squarely anti-domestic, going so far as to attack the housekeeper as an enemy. In his architectural designs, Matta proposed stair- cases without banisters and ‘‘walls like damp sheets molding and molded by psychological fears.’’ The mid-twentieth-century American avant-garde was squarely anti-domestic. Robert Motherwell affirmed large-scale Abstract Expressionist paintings as an assault on the French attempt to make paintings intimate. Mark Rothko intended his work as an insult to people who craved interior decoration. Picasso insisted: ‘‘painting is not made to decorate apart- ments. It’s an offensive and defensive weapon against the enemy.’’ For the influential critics Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg, ‘‘the domestic was the antithesis of art.’’ Greenberg identified kitsch with knickknacks in the bourgeois home. For him, the mission of abstract painting was ‘‘to find ways of using the decorative against itself.’’ In the summary assessment of Christopher Reed, ‘‘This became the standard of modern art: a heroic odyssey on the high 60.

Historian of science George Sarton’s 1909 novel La chaine d’or situates the advancement of science in a colony of artists located in a rural suburb of Ghent.62 The notion, captured by anarchist Peter Kropotkin (who was closely followed by Post-Impressionists like Camille Pissarro), gave science the task of improving—not fundamentally transforming—the life of ordinary people.63 The pastoral painter Giovanni Segantini urged science to contribute to cele- brating traditional life: ‘‘You, men of science and philosophers, do not flee from us but instead approach, only together can we create a new culture, one we may call ‘the culture of the sun.’’’64 In his last work, Sarton’s contemporary Gaston Bachelard, one of the earliest French philosophical elaborators of relativity theory and quantum mechanics, gave special meaning to preindus- trial technology: Those who lived in the century now past say the word lamp with lips dif- ferent from those of today. Dreamer of words that I am, the word ‘‘light- bulb’’ makes me laugh. Never can a lightbulb be familiar enough to take a possessive adjective. Who now can say ‘‘my electric lightbulb’’ in the same way that he once said ‘‘my lamp’’? . . . The electric lightbulb will never provoke in us the reveries of this living lamp which made light out of oil. We have entered an age of administered light. Our only role is to flip a switch.

He passionately defended gas lamps in 1881; in his view, the electrical arc lamp was ‘‘horrible, unearthly, obnoxious to the human eye; a lamp for a nightmare.’’66 Georgics, the poetic celebration of rural life, suffuse Post-Impressionism, from sensuous bathing in rivers to immaculate harvesting in fields. A consis- tent theme in the Art Nouveau of Gustave Seurrier-Bovy and Henry van de Velde concerned ‘‘an ideal relationship between art and the rural labourer or artisan’’ and the ‘‘splendid vitality of popular art.’’67 In interior design, the organic designs of Art Nouveau played a commanding roˆle until the 1920s, when lean and spare Art Deco replaced it.68 The representation of ordinary people, not the opera or the salon, was the center of gravity in Picasso’s early work. For all their manifestations against domesticity, intellectuals during the Belle Epoque desired to recover the dignity of the home. Making it possible for ordinary people to live in honor and security—bourgeois watchwords— was central to the aims of socialists from Rosa Luxemburg to Keir Hardie. The observation makes it seem less dissonant that innovators in art from Edouard Manet onward sought and found bourgeois patrons for their crea- tions. And while it may be that Vincent van Gogh, who died in 1890, was unsuccessful at marketing his works, no one less than young J. Robert Oppenheimer, born in 1904, grew up in a home with several paintings by this artist. In addition to the vaults of speculative collectors, the home was where innovative art ended up. We see an echo of this domestic setting in the mansions built by Isabella Stewart Gardner, Albert C. Barnes, David and Mary Gamble, and Henry E. Huntington. Although American interior dec- orator and novelist Edith Wharton furnished houses in the New World and the Old World according to traditional sensibilities, other people of wealth 66.

Paintings perform their task of wall decoration rather effortlessly, whether in an appropriate home or in an art gallery.’’70 Scaling down from these palaces, which twentieth-century house- hold would not have liked to display a seriograph by Paul Klee or Andy Warhol?71 ABSTRACT ORNAMENTATION OF ROOMS If we ask about the form of art that would complement a bourgeois room, it is appropriate to focus on what the room contained. Let us begin at the bottom with floor coverings. Oriental carpets were known in Europe since the four- teenth century. Antique carpets are still called as much by the name of the region or the workshop that produced them as by the European painter who included them on his canvasses. In the nineteenth century, they ceased to be an item available only to the very rich. Establishments and ateliers expanded across the Ottoman Empire, from the Carpathians to Cairo, to supply the European market. Aniline dyes, a relatively inexpensive product for achieving brilliant if impermanent coloration, quickly found an application in the indus- try. Quality declined.72 69. Emily J.

Between about 1850 and 1880, prices for carpets had remained low because European dealers were secretive about their purchases and their costs. But early in the 1890s, several highly publicized exhibitions of carpets took place, notably one in Vienna in which Alois Riegl participated, and an exorbitantly expensive carpet, later contended to be something of a fake, was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.73 By 1900, the single most expensive item in a bourgeois European household was frequently an Oriental carpet with its abstract design. In her history of the Exner family of scientists and artists, Deborah R. Coen has emphasized about the Viennese bourgeoisie: ‘‘Absolutely a point of honor to own at least one authentic Oriental carpet.’’74 Although the abstract designs range widely, they are generally geometrical, repeating patterns with both straight lines and gentle curves, and complex forms that originated, perhaps five hundred years ago, as figural representations. For Alois Riegl, in the diversity of carpets was found artistic style.75 Artists were especially taken by Oriental carpets. In 1883, Maxime Du Camp reported Euge`ne Delacroix at play with skeins of wool and commenting: ‘‘The most beautiful pictures I have seen are certain Persian carpets.’’ Paul Gauguin described the self-portrait he painted for Vincent Van Gogh as ‘‘a complete abstraction. The eyes, the mouth, the nose are like the flowers of a Persian carpet, thus personifying the symbolic side.’’ Gauguin’s personal odyssey was part of a more general hankering for abstraction that found inspiration beyond Europe. David Sylvester has related interest in Oriental carpets to ‘‘the growing recognition of the potency of abstract shape and colour’’ on the part of late nineteenth-century Europeans, who, in Sylvester’s view, rejected their own iconographic, anthropomorphic tradition and embraced a new, open- minded aestheticism. Europeans ‘‘looked to cultures specializing in orna- ment—the Celtic, the Mycenaean, the Islamic.’’76 Gauguin, who died in 73. Neugebauer and Orendi, Teppichkunde (ref. 72), 82–97.

You will find everything scientific, but, who knows, the book may be hidden, and you cannot read it.’’77 Carpets trace a path through the paintings of the Belle Epoque, from the living carpets of Van Gogh’s Tulip Fields (1883) and the room carpet in his painting Gauguin’s Chair (1888) through the pointillisme of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. In Signac’s One Sunday (1888–90), in fact, the texture of the quantum-tufted carpet in the foreground spreads to the entire space of a bourgeois salon, including chair, cat, and fern (Fig. 1). Rooms in the last years of the nineteenth century, designed in the Art Nouveau style and inspired by organic nature, are graced by Oriental carpets as a central oxy- moron.

Matisse’s Oriental Rugs (1906), with carpets displayed this way and that, allowed the artist to juxtapose strong reds and blues. Matisse provided the tin-glaze floral pattern for a cov- ered, clay pot, and the pot is depicted in his painting, Statuettes and Vase on a Red Carpet (1908).79 Matisse’s Painter’s Family (1911) is about a magnificent Caucasian carpet around which personal figures are arranged as if they were ornaments.80 Paul Klee’s Carpet of Memory (begun in 1914), often associated with Klee’s travels in Morocco, is better read as a meditation on Oriental carpets from South Central Asia which covered the floors of bourgeois Europe (Fig. 2). From this point of view, Klee’s voyage to Morocco was a search for the source of familiar abstraction. Jenny Anger writes: ‘‘It is an orientalist fantasy that claims Klee experienced an epiphany of pure color in Tunisia.’’ Rather, ‘‘Klee’s abstraction . . . stems from his concern for the decorative in art.’’81 It is not too much of a reach to associate carpets directly with Picasso’s Cubism.

Picasso invariably used the very cheapest of the range, papers most commonly found in working-class homes and cafe ́s.’’85 A large portion of a photographic self-portrait of Picasso in his studio on the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris, made in 1911, shows a big square of floral wallpaper unceremoniously pinned next to Picasso’s abstract and sche- matic drawing, Femme nue debout (1910).86 Jack Ziegler, in a New Yorker cartoon from 1977, hit the nail squarely on its head (Fig. 5). Henri Matisse, in his Interior with Eggplants (1911), shows a bold pattern of wallpaper and carpeting merging together to become the central theme of a room. On the left of the painting, wallpaper and a folding screen help define a wall mirror and a mirror standing on the floor, the latter possibly reflecting a foot and a bit of skirt on an outdoor step, although it is more usual to say that just as the perspective is multivalent, so the floor mirror does not faithfully reflect the eggplants and the table (Fig. 6). Matisse’s Moorish Screen (1917–21) is as much about the wallpaper and Oriental rugs that occupy more than half the canvas as it is about an arched screen; in it, two women dressed in pale pink provide the only relief from a riot of abstract design (Fig. 7).

ABSTRACTION IN ELECTRICAL LIGHTING Between 1890 and 1914, electrical lighting transformed both the interiors and the streets of European cities. Electricity had substantial advantages over gas.

For the Paris Universal Exposi- tion of 1889, two engineers proposed, as a competitor to Gustave Eiffel’s celebration of iron, a 360-meter-high ‘‘Column of the Sun’’ to illuminate all of Paris from a single electrical source.92 Strings of electric bulbs provided gargantuan sculptures of light on bridges and in city squares, like the illumi- nated Metro entrances with Art Nouveau glass fixtures designed by Hector Guimard beginning in 1900—an effect difficult to achieve with gas technol- ogy.93 Electricity competed with gas through the first decade of the twentieth century, when intense experimentation into using rare earths for electrical filaments produced a durable and efficient tungsten filament.94 Radiant color pierced the night when in 1910 commercial neon lights made their de ́but in Paris by the entrepreneurial inventor Georges Claude.95 During the Belle Epoque, Paris blazed as the ‘‘City of Light,’’ for unlike in Berlin, most of its electricity went to lighting rather than to powering industry.96 It has been contended that painting during the last decades of the nine- teenth century records how electricity illuminated indoor public spaces.97 Certainly electrical lighting occupied the attention of painters during the first years of the twentieth century. A pioneering painter in the Netherlands, Jan Sluijters, was seduced by the Neo-Impressionists and the Fauves, particularly Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Kees van Dongen, when he visited Paris in 1906 as the beneficiary of the Prix de Roˆme.

Fauve Kees van Dongen, who early in the century lived close to Picasso at the residence known as the Bateau-Lavoir, embraced the effect of strong, electrical lights in his subjects, and he experimented with electrical lighting in his studio. So did the Swedish painter Axel To ̈rneman, when he worked in Paris in 1905–06.99 The Palais d’Electricite ́ and the spectacular illu- mination of the Eiffel Tower, from the Paris 1900World’s Fair, inspired Futurist Giacomo Balla (Fig. 8).

The examples he discussed, all submitted for a prize competition, are indeed busy, and most of them are symmetrical; he showed nothing resembling Tiffany’s explosion of color or the dramatic glass artistry of the Nancy school of Louis Majorelle, Emile Galle ́, and Antonin Daum.

Bode was favorably im- pressed with the artistic side of American manufactures.104 Across the first decade of the twentieth century, Adolf Loos contended against Peter Behrens, who was the principal designer for Allgemeine Elektrizita ̈ts-Gesellschaft, to eliminate figurative motifs and ornament from lamps and to seek designs in the functional essence of an object. Loos believed that no designers (for example, Behrens and his circle known as the Deutscher Werkbund) could formulate a style for an epoch, and that it was misguided to revive styles of the past. Rather, the style of an epoch arose organically from material needs and opportunities. Loos greatly admired constructions in the United States, especially skyscrapers. His interiors from the years before 1914 have lean and spare lines.105 Just as furniture factories mass-produced arts-and- crafts designs during the Belle Epoque, so the writings of Loos and his fol- lowers contributed to the rise of an opposing tendency—functional, industrial design—and to its incorporation into domestic spaces. The profusion, not to say confusion, of lighting styles led Picasso’s advocate Guillaume Apollinaire to call in 1910 for a museum devoted to lampposts.106 Color is part of light, and it triumphed in the Belle Epoque in the painting of the Neo-Impressionists and their successors, many of whom pondered how colors related to each other in a scientific sense and, indeed, what they 104.

Lanka Tattersall concludes: ‘‘The ways in which artists nego- tiated and explored the contradictions between scientific reason and expression is a central narrative of the development of abstraction, particularly as it con- cerns their work with color.’’111 It is well known that light is at the center of Einstein’s special relativity.112 Less commonly observed is that the business of Einstein’s family involved 107.

Between 1887 and 1891, Einstein &amp; Cie contracted for lighting Schwabing, a suburb of Munich. A 40-hp gas motor drove two dynamos provided by the company; eight arc lamps and 170 incandescent lamps ran from overhead cables. Friedrich Uppenborn, director of the bureau of lighting of the city of Munich, wrote that this innovation had Schwabing take on a ‘‘completely American appearance.’’ When the system switched on, the Schwabing Gemeindezeitung reported, ‘‘the festival square and the streets of Schwabing shone forth with the brightest arc lamps and incandescent light, greeted by those present with lively applause.’’114 Even though the Einsteins were the first to provide electrical lighting for Munich’s Oktoberfest in 1886 (it has been asserted that young Albert Einstein installed apparatus on this occasion), they ultimately could not compete with larger firms like Siemens.115 The Einsteins relocated their electrical business to Pavia, Italy, in 1893, and Albert Einstein lived there until 1895, when, likely with his family’s expectation that he enter the family business, he continued his education in Switzerland. Einstein’s first permanent position, in 1903, was as a patent examiner in Berne; much of his work concerned electrical devices. In his path-breaking study about the quantum theory of solids in 1907, Einstein appealed to experimental results obtained by his former professor in Zurich, Heinrich F. Weber, about the specific heat of incandescent, carbon fila- ments.116 The general question of electromagnetic radiation was the central 113.

Some of the fixtures had shapes that made allusion to pre-industrial forms, such as fluted columns, acanthus leaves, and bases resembling turned wood. But, in common with the products of other factories, the Einsteins’ lamps went beyond traditional forms, in the manner of the designs originating in natural objects found on Oriental carpets. Their lamps, along with most early commercial lighting, created a stark and brutal tableau of light and darkness in domestic interiors. LIGHT AND SHADOWS IN THE BOURGEOIS AND SCIENTIFIC EXPERIENCE Since the Enlightenment projected Modernity, it is not surprising that modern literature featured personal shadows as a persistent trope from the time of Goethe’s Unterhaltungen deutscher Ausgewanderten (1795) and Adelbert von Chamisso’s Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte (1814). Shadows move front and center during the early decades of the twentieth century: They feature prominently in Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897), J. M. Barrie’s Peter Pan (staged 1904), Joseph Conrad’s Shadow Line (1916), Marcel Proust’s A` l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (1919), and the opera by Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Die Frau ohne Schatten (staged 1919). The Belle Epoque is when the Shadow Cabinet, an institution taking shape in nineteenth- century British parliamentary democracy, became known widely by that name.118 Shadows are omitted in nineteenth-century works with significant attention to detail, for example, by the Pre-Raphaelites, but in the twentieth century, they receive emphasis in works by Futurists, Cubists, Expressionists, and Surrealists.119 117.

Experimentalists famously analyzed the sha- dows produced by cathode rays and X rays, the latter in widespread medical use. X-ray diffraction photographs, involving the wave-nature of electromag- netic radiation, resulted in Nobel prizes for Max von Laue (1914) and the Braggs, father and son (1915). Among Einstein’s few drawings and illustrations are the silhouettes he produced of his family—himself and his second wife and daughters as standing shadows.120 An informed assessment of shadows in electrical lighting appeared from the pen of Louis Bell in 1902. Bell had obtained a PhD at Johns Hopkins University in 1888 under Henry Rowland, and Bell subsequently became a consulting engineer and lecturer on electrical power transmission at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.121 In his book, The Art of Illumination, Bell surveyed lighting at a time just before widespread introduction of the tungsten electrical filament. He observed that manufacturers were concerned about the spatial distribution of light. Open arc lamps were notoriously asymmetric in luminos- ity. Most light came from a crater in the upper carbon rod, and it was inter- cepted by the lower carbon rod; the lamp, dazzling blue-white at close range, did not project well, although opalescent glass globes somewhat compensated for both distribution and color problems (Fig. 11). Better lighting could be achieved at greater cost from an array of lamps, typical for interiors, and even today ceiling and wall fixtures have multiple incandescent bulbs to this end. Bell emphasized that arc lamps were more cost-efficient than either incandescents or gas-burners—a crucial consideration for municipalities investing in large light- ing systems. In Bell’s time, nothing compensated for the singing noise of an alternating-current arc lamp, produced by oscillations in the burning arc.122 - Gombrich emphasizes that shadows are portrayed inconsistently in Western painting through the nineteenth century in Shadows: The Depiction of Cast Shadows in Western Art: A Companion Volume to an Exhibition at the National Gallery (London: National Gallery Publications, 1995), for example, 55, two unseen suns in Jean-Le ́on Ge ́roˆme’s painting, Golgotha: consummatum est (1867). An interesting parallel study would concern light passing through water—also portrayed incon- sistently, in the Western European tradition.

Prominent shadows were a byproduct of brilliant public street lighting. An open arc lamp mounted on posts for public lighting projected a characteristic pattern on the street below. A field of brilliant light diminished in a large circle beneath the pole and in wedge-shaped lateral shadows produced by the mounting and the mechanism of the device. The pattern of light and darkness appears in a comprehensive survey of 1914 by the marvelously named Hein- rich Lux, revolutionary and physicist, notable for having converted Charles Steinmetz to the socialist cause and for having identified the contributions of Leo Arons, also a revolutionary and a physicist, in developing the mercury- </page> <page sequence="46"> 326 | P Y ENSON vapor lamp.123 Electrical lighting fired the mind of revolutionaries from Lenin on down, as well as industrial entrepreneurs, painters, and ordinary people. Fixed shadows, whose precise proportions varied from one kind of lamp to another, would have been familiar to anyone walking in the newly electrified streets.124 The notion of shadows in electrodynamics is found in publications in the early years of the twentieth century by physicists Theodor Des Coudres and Arnold Sommerfeld. Des Coudres, in 1900, produced a graphical illustration of the motion of an electron moving faster than light that resembled the projection of light by a shaded electric table lamp.125 In a publication of 1904, Sommerfeld wrote in English about the ‘‘shadow of motion,’’ also from electrons moving faster than light, and he accompanied his discussion with an illustration that resembles the usual picture of Cˇerenkov radiation (Fig. 12).126 The writings of Des Coudres and Sommerfeld were studied by Hermann Minkowski and geophysicist Emil Wiechert in a collaborative research seminar on electron theory at Go ̈ttingen, conducted with David Hilbert and Gustav Herglotz, in 1905.127 These seminar participants would have known about the 123.

In 1907 Wiechert and his student Karl Zoeppritz investigated shells of differing density constituting the earth’s interior; Wiechert considered the possibility of a liquid core on the basis of data taken by his student Franz Linke, who directed a seismological observatory in German Sa- moa.

The domain of shadows lies beyond communication with a moving, material object. Minkowski began the paper describing his graphical representation with a metaphor for space-time—he proclaimed that with his work, traditional notions of space and time would ‘‘sink into the shadows.’’130 A decade later, in 1919, light and darkness pro- jected Einstein’s general relativity to world attention. The moon’s shadow cast in a solar eclipse permitted photographing circumsolar fixed stars, an essential verification for his theory sought by Einstein as early as 1911.131 ABSTRACTION AS NEO-IDEALIST VIRTUE A century ago, the Belle Epoque exhibited a pronounced strain of abstraction and an inclination to emphasize the value of idealism in all its forms. The emphasis on idealism was endemic to advocates of abstinence from alcohol, meat, tobacco, marriage, and war, and to intellectuals concerned with ‘‘race hygiene’’ (Heinrich Lux and George Sarton, cited earlier, embraced these causes).132 Alfred Nobel and his curators certainly emphasized material things over abstract ideas in their prizes for science, but idealism nevertheless remained the principal criterion by which Nobel prizes in literature, and even some Nobel prizes in peace, were conferred. If idealism is seen as a ‘‘hunger for wholeness,’’ then it was everywhere manifest in the years before the First World War. 130. ‘‘Von Stund’ an sollen Raum fu ̈r sich und Zeit fu ̈r sich vo ̈llig zu Schatten herabsinken und nur noch eine Art Union der beiden soll Selbsta ̈ndigkeit bewahren.’’ See Scott Walter, ‘‘Minkowski, Mathematicians and the Mathematical Theory of Relativity,’’ in The Expanding Worlds of General Relativity, ed.

Rathenau’s biographer Shulamit Volkov emphasizes Rathe- nau’s ‘‘rush to highfalutin formulations, his insistence on easy solutions to deep- seated dilemmas, and especially his tendency to seek these solutions in higher spiritual, even mystical realms.’’134 In 1917, Rathenau, whose ideas ranged widely, praised Rudolf Eucken as ‘‘the old master of German philosophy.’’135 It would not have been surprising if the idealists Merz and Rathenau had supported the Positivism that was congenial to many of the practical people who built the machines, produced the chemicals, and transformed the land- scape in their time. By 1900 Positivism was a highly abstract, indeed idealistic doctrine, complete with its own church and prophets.136 Lenin understood the attraction of Positivism for progressive minds, and he vigorously sought to distinguish his own messianic philosophy from it.137 As for Pragmatism, when Americans called themselves pragmatic early in the twentieth century, they meant that they were practical or empiricist rather than idealist, even though in the view of C. S. Peirce, Pragmatism by no means opposed theoretical con- structs.138 Pragmatism was often invoked not because it opposed idealism but 133.

First, by 1914 both Einstein and Picasso lived in comfort, and that would have meant electricity. Their substantial income entailed no real ob- ligations, a situation that modern research scientists and creative artists identify as nirvana. One wonders if this freedom from material want facilitated a pre- occupation with abstraction.140 Second, both Einstein and Picasso had a woman companion who did not speak their own language with native fluency.141 To some extent both men were at ease as cosmopolitans. But there would have been a continual reach for understanding in their homes—Ein- stein’s in German, Picasso’s in French (his knowledge of French was uneven, to judge from the letters he wrote to his dealers). Even more remote and abstract for Einstein would have been his time from 1911 to 1912 as a professor in Prague, the multilingual city (which Mileva Einstein found uncongenial) that gave rise to the Modernist writings of Franz Kafka. 139. The pragmatic spirit of John Dewey dominated U.S. public education in the twentieth century, and it continues to guide colleges of education today. In the course of ten years as a graduate dean, I observed how teachers-in-training are encouraged to formulate ‘‘pragmatically’’ their own, spontaneous, educational ‘‘philosophy,’’ the latter word intended to summarize their feelings about classroom activity.

Fitzgerald, Making Modernism: Picasso and the Creation of the Market for Twentieth-Century Art (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996), 44: By 1913, ‘‘Picasso was already on his way to becoming a wealthy man.’’ In 1913, for example, Picasso’s dealer Daniel- Henry Kahnweiler paid him more than fifty thousand francs. ‘‘The degree to which financial security encouraged Picasso and Braque to pursue the radical experiments of hermetic Cubism and collage remains an unanswered question, and no available documents specify the extent of Picasso’s involvement in his dealer’s business.’’ Christa Kirsten and Hans-Ju ̈rgen Treder, eds., Albert Einstein in Berlin 1913–1933, Teil I.

Almost simultaneously, as Einstein and Picasso rose in the esteem of their colleagues and as their income allowed them to live in bourgeois comfort, their affection for their intimate companion cooled. </page> <page sequence="52"> 332 | P Y ENSON Widespread sentiment in favor of abstraction and idealism before 1914 found a concrete expression in the decoration of bourgeois rooms, and it facilitated a favorable response to relativity and Cubism. More than that, it inclined talented minds like Einstein’s and Picasso’s to explore abstract and ideal formulations of the world. In the opinion of Jonathan Crary, a culture of abstraction, both high and low, originated at the time of the early nineteenth- century political restoration, when people began to view the world in terms of ‘‘autonomous perception severed from any external referent.’’ The change did not follow from ‘‘some deep structure, economic base, or worldview.’’ Rather, it was ‘‘the functioning of a collective assemblage of disparate parts on a single social surface.’’142 With this analysis, we find ourselves in the company of Karl Lamprecht’s psychosocial resonances, a controversial, nineteenth-century notion that became part of the historical paradigm of Henri Pirenne, Marc Bloch, and Lucien Febre, who emphasized, above all, long trends in the perception of ordinary people. Just as anarcho-syndicalism inspired intellectuals at the same time that socialist doctrine did,143 so the desire to break with the past of science led young scientists such as Einstein and Bohr to advance provisional, if incom- plete, hypotheses and to propose revolutionary doctrines. Their path forward was similar to the dogged artistic questioning of Picasso and his circle that resulted in Cubism and ‘‘pure painting’’—in Apollinaire’s appraisal from 1912, ‘‘an ideal beauty which is no longer simply the prideful expression of the species, but the expression of the universe so far as it has become human through light.’’144 Both the physicists and the artists had reached the end of their classical understanding, ‘‘au bout de mon latin,’’ as an exasperated Hen- drik Antoon Lorentz wrote to Henri Poincare ́ in 1906 about experimental evidence apparently disproving his ‘‘hypothesis of the flattening of elec- trons.’’145 Lorentz’s disarming phrase notwithstanding, his mastery of classical 142.

Appealing to ‘‘higher’’ values and forms, they set themselves apart from the venial, material world—the most successful among them eventually retiring to idyllic settings such as Princeton and the French Riviera. Their abstractions became anathema to the socialist world, which was nevertheless unable to offer an appealing alternative. The way out of protracted debate between idealism and materialism, at the end of the century, was the triumph of idiosyncratic, personal taste. In Postmodernity, Epicurus’s celebrated appetite has surely trumped Modernity’s Platonic abstraction.148 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS In Spring 2012, versions of this paper were read to the Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, and to the Escuela de Filosofı ́a, Centro de Estudios Avanzados, Universidad Nacional de Co ́rdoba, Argentina.
