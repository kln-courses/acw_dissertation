<plain_text><page sequence="1">Borgest Puzzk of Paradoxes BRUCE LORICH most of the fictions of Jorge Luis Borges are heretical texts for solipsista Most of them are closest in effect to the arid "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" in that they often heavy-handedly discuss manifestations of the solipsistic viewpoint through intentionally confusing narrators whose identities fluctuate between past and present persons and who are therefore uncertain of the precision of what they are saying and even of themselves. Many of them imply or demonstrate "Eleatic paradoxes," as Borges calls them in that famous footnote story. And while many of the fictions are themselves dreamlike, few successfully portray a dream carried to its frightening fulfillment. Few of the fictions of Borges are authentic fictional wanderings as precise, as well written, as emotionally unbending, and as mentally fulminating as Julio Cortazar's "Axolotl," for example. Disciple Cortázar s stories have those qualities. Few of Borges's do. The Argentine writer has created a complex, labyrinthine puzzle of paradoxes in which pedantic psyche-twisters, related only to themselves and to a philosophical stance, appear more regularly than do ingenious, truly fictional artifices. Most of his so-called fictions are in- tellectual games. Borges has said that his best story is perhaps "The South." It is basic- ally free from the pedanticism of most of his stories, and it is coherent, largely independent of the other stories that compose Borges's puzzle, though it relates strongly to a number of those stories and to Argentina's national epic, Martín Fierro , which it ironically modernizes and whose nostalgia it lacerates. Its universality in the realm of solipsism makes it a perfect little masterpiece, and it assumes some of the traits of familiar fiction because, like Cortazar's "Axolotl," it does not depend upon con- voluted abstractions, but instead removes the physical and internal action from the realm of flux and makes order out of the identifiable but imagi- natively perceived particulars of reality. Both stories illuminate and southwest Review 53</page><page sequence="2">tangibly adumbrate, rather than discuss outright and hedge around, theme and the action that carries it. In "The South" Borges has, more success- fully than in any other story, made fiction instead of theory or instructive pattern. From among the numerous obscurities and scholarly allusions of Borges a key may be rescued to much of the man's work, an idea that intensifies and singles out - and therefore gives dimensions to - the most important and most revealing specific notion from the various philoso- phies that have influenced Borges's brand of solipsism. One of the quali- ties that might well be the most severely limiting factor of Borges's creative renderings is his overindulgence in and overuse of scholarship. But whether his scholarly pursuits have fettered his imaginative abilities or whether in fact his clever use of scholarship has replaced and is an imitation of creativity, Borges nevertheless seems to have built many of his most complex and lively stories around the Eleatic paradoxes men- tioned in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius."1 That story is a weak piece, obviously more instructive than fictional. But besides actually mentioning - certainly so briefly that many readers would skim right over it as just another obscurity - the Greek philoso- phical game of Zeno indelibly stained by the belief in the unity of being and the unreality of motion or change, the story also explicitly verbalizes a sort of illustration of it by reference to Plato's cycle of opposites: "Another, that while we sleep here, we are awake elsewhere and that in this way every man is two men." That line, interesting in itself, is certainly a good example of how Borges's story of a few men imaginative- ly creating a world, or at least causing its history (and therefore succeed- ing in fooling everyone), is based upon the solipsistic, and especially Eleatic, belief in the unity of being; but it is an antifictional kind of telling, and in a peculiarly concrete way it depends directly upon the hidden central abstraction of the story for its punch. In fact, so does the whole story: not only is it pedantically lifeless, it is also not fiction. It is intellectual roaming. Except for the enjoyable labyrinthine Section One, which serves as an introduction to or even a kind of frame for the 1 In the collection entitled Ficciones translated by Alastair Reid (New York, 1962), p. 26; in the collection entitled Labyrinths translated by James E. Irby (New York, 1964), p. 11. Of the two translations, the latter seems more faithful to the original Spanish but the former is the more readable. I quote from both translations, but except for 'Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" I use Ficciones most often. 54 winter 1973</page><page sequence="3">story, "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" is a totally "told" piece in spite of the clever but slight confusion of the narrator's identity. Its point - that only ideas exist, and only in the present, and that the realm of extant ideas is the great labyrinth of the mind - is made in Section Two, which, as opposed to Section One, is mostly verbiage in imitation of a fertile imagination. Such basically dry verbiage is only occasionally relieved. An example is this striking line that turns out to be a rather occult allusion to Kafka's "In the Penal Colony": "the moldy and mutilated torso of a king whose chest bore an inscription which it has not yet been possible to decipher." Original and lively lines are not entirely absent in the story: "Its blue needle longed for magnetic north. . . ." But, mostly, in this particular story as in the majority of the others, Borges depends upon his ambivalent and only somewhat pleasing fictional narrator to explain to the reader what is happening: "he wanted to demonstrate . . . that mortal man was capable of conceiving a world." And finally Borges demonstrates his auctorial-narratorial foolery when he concludes that "the world will be Tlön," and that during the transformation he intends merely to continue casually revising Browne's Urn Burial , yet another indication that the author-narrator is one of the conspirators (or perhaps the only conspirator) against our world. He is the one who is revising our history, creating an illusionary world, so that the so-called real world will seem hardly recognizable and strange indeed. Throughout a number of his other so-called fictions, Borges relent- lessly tells the reader about the purposes of his works; such hints may be good advice to other writers, but they shoot holes through the fictions. In the story just discussed, Borges reminds us that "Tlön was thought to be nothing more than a chaos, a free and irresponsible work of the imagina- tion," and makes clear the solipsistic application to his work by mention- ing that "the dominant notion is that everything is the work of one single author." In "The Circular Ruins," one of Borges's better fictions containing some fine concrete lines (the beautiful lines of a writer, the kind whose perfection, like dreaming an entire world, is "much more difficult than weaving a rope out of sand or coining the faceless wind") and a story depicting the total imaginative powers of the solipsist, we are told that "he knew that his immediate obligation was to dream." In "An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain," about a solipsistic writer, Borges lays down ground rules for new fiction, but ones that can be well or ill used and that too often are ill used by Borges himself: southwest Review 55</page><page sequence="4">these are " 'the essential features of all games: symmetry, arbitrary rules, tedium/ " In the same story, in which he mostly fails to elicit creative use of those rules, Borges also advises that "of the various pleasures offered by literature, the greatest is invention." And Borges even tells us why he chooses to write footnote stories to novels he might have written, at the same time defending his dealings in solipsism: "But the certainty that everything has been already written nullifies or makes phantoms of us all," Borges writes in "The Library of Babel." Mental phantoms are the currency Borges deals in; but he rarely creates them, whereas his disciple Cortázar is most apt in the literary venture. Unlike the Borges pieces already discussed, Cortazar's "Axolotl" never falls back on mere rhetoric. It is a piece of pure and strong imagi- nation even though it owes its method and its theme to mentor Borges. The playfulness and intensity of the story are obvious even when the debt to Eleatic play and to Borges is not. The story is successful fiction because from the first word the narrator is an authentic fictional creation, even if he is entirely a phantom and but one nebulous wanderer in the great labyrinth. It is a highly concrete little gem of circular form; owing a great deal to conventional realistic fiction and to Kafkaesque allegory, it still makes new and pleasing use of the symmetry and arbi- trary rules of which Borges writes. It is, in short, the brilliant sort of Eleatic paradox that Borges speaks about in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius." The narrator of "Axolotl" is as believable as Gregor Samsa of Kafka's "Metamorphosis," and for the same reasons: acute attention to detail rendered into fiction by striking, numerous, and intricately related con- cretes. Fictional verisimilitude, a progress irrepressible by the reader, intimacy between the narrator and the reader (which so heightens the reader's realization at the story's end), unpretentious prose, and a steady intense pace all complement the circularity of the story. It may be begun anywhere and read straight through, disregarding pagination, to the word preceding that which was read first. And it may be read and reread with- out loss of charm. As Cortázar's narrator tells of - or thinks he is telling of, and not actually living - his transition into the larval salamander, the reader's sense of logic fades into a vicarious emotional impression, and immediately the transmogrification is complete: "I saw from very close up the face of an axolotl immobile next to the glass. No transition and no surprise, I saw my face against the glass, I saw it on the outside of the tank, I saw it on the other side of the glass. Then my face drew back and 56 winter 1973</page><page sequence="5">I understood."2 What he has understood is that he has become the object that so fascinated him. As if the progress of the story weren't enough, the descriptions of the axolotl also conjure up the essence of the Eleatic paradoxes that so fasci- nate Borges. The unreality of motion or change is inherent in the sala- manders themselves: "I felt it a lewdness to be peering at these silent and immobile figures heaped at the bottom of the tank," says Cortázar s narrator. "They continued to look at me, immobile; from time to time the rosy branches of the gills stiffened. In that instant I felt a muted pain; perhaps they were seeing me, attracting my strength to penetrate into the impenetrable thing of their lives." As the narrator stands before the fish tank (or so he thinks) with his eyes glued to the glass separating him and the axolotls (or so he thinks), virtually immobile for days on end, the reader sees the unity of being which exists between the narrator and the axolotls even if the narrator himself is only somewhat aware of it. Bringing Eleatic paradox to life are these descriptions by and of the narrator of Cortázar's story (emphasis added): "The axolotls huddled on the wretched narrow (only I can know how narrow and wretched) floor of moss and stone in the tank"; "I saw a rosy little body . . . ending in a fish's tail of extraordinary delicacy, the most sensitive part of our body"; "Once in a while a foot would barely move, I saw the diminutive toes poise mildly on the moss. Iťs that we don't enjoy moving a lot, and the tank is so cramped. . . ." Before the deliquescence of human being into salamander is created in the story, the narrator mentions that he has read that specimens of the axolotl "had been found in Africa capable of living on dry land," completing the phantom anthropomorphism. But the Eleatic and solipsistic influences occur in and are fictionally perfected by both the beginning and the ending of the story. When read in reverse order, they demonstrate the circularity of the work's form: I am an axolotl for good now, and if I think like a man it s only because every axolotl thinks like a man inside his rosy stone semblance. I believe that all this succeeded in communicating something to him in those first days, when I was still he. And in this final solitude to which he no longer comes, I console myself by thinking that perhaps he is going to write a story about us, that, believing he's making up a story, he's going to write all this about axolotls. 2 Julio Cortázar, End of the Game and Other Stories , trans. Paul Blackburn (New York, 1963), p. 8. SOUTHWEST Review 57</page><page sequence="6">There was a time when I thought a great deal about the axolotls. I went to see them in the aquarium at the Jardin des Plantes and stayed for hours watching them, observing their immobility, their faint movements. Now I am an axolotl. Borges's "The South" shares the characteristics of Cortázar s little masterpiece. In "The Circular Ruins" Borges wrote that he "wanted to dream a man; he wanted to dream him in minute entirety and impose him on reality," and the end of that story - more of a punchline than is the end of "Axolotl" because Borges holds off the information of identity until the end while Cortázar begins and ends with the same revelation - is an explanation by Borges of his purpose: "With relief, with humiliation, with terror, he understood that he also was an illusion, that someone else was dreaming him." Borges is rarely the artist Cortázar is. "Humiliation" is an important word for Borges. Like everything else in his world, it is a special kind of humiliation. Its origins lie in the very thing that most intrigues Borges - the mind. And the mind causes his special humiliation because of its play with illusion. As is not too unusual among solipsists, I suppose, the tension that is working in the solipsisti mind between concepts constantly antagonizes and frustrates the concep- tualizer. It is what leads to the pulmonary congestion that kills that great imaginer who, without imaginary bounds, is haunted by past and present reality and by thoughts, and who is incapable of generalized thought - Ireneo Funes in "Funes, the Memorious," a story to haunt the epistemolo- gist in his contemplative library hours. It is what makes Borges lie to himself at the end of "An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain" when he says about the imagined works of the imagined Quain: "The reader, led astray by vanity, thinks he has invented them. I was ingenious enough to extract from the third ... my story of 'The Circular Ruins/ " The reader is not the only one who suffers confusion for being told by a solipsist what he thinks he has invented. The art of illusion can become the humiliation of a man who is misled, confused, and frustrated by it, and who ultimately curses himself for being dependent upon a raging, labyrinthine mind. That seems to be Borges's predicament. It may be a predicament he tries to absolve himself of by writing his fictions, but it is also a predicament that, even when seemingly under control and only a potentiality, haunts him constantly. As he says of a mad purpose in life in "The Circular Ruins": "... to be a projection of another man's 58 winter 1973</page><page sequence="7">dreams - what an incomparable humiliation, what madness!" What it seems Borges fears is a possible understanding "that he had not dreamed" his fictions - a fantastic nightmare - and that he may exist in a "con- dition of empty illusion," to use Borgens own words from "The Circular Ruins." It is the living (perhaps living) hell of the solipsist. After all, it is what Borges himself calls the mental state into which Juan Dahl- mann enters after being treated at the sanitarium, the state he is in after the operation and the state he is in when he eventually heads south, a state that makes him realize that his condition while he dreamed of living at his grandfather's ranch in the South and while he suffered from the super sensations following his mysterious head cut and its ensuing fever was merely like living "in a suburb of hell." Borgens fears and his own humiliation can perhaps be best seen, strangely enough, in his best fiction. "The South" reveals much about Borges the man and about Borges the creator. But, like all good fiction that performs that double task, it does so subtly. In most of his stories, Borgest own personality is not visible (or so it seems, for it may well be, through his solipsistic belief that all men are the same man, which is the subject of "Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote" and is also his most important juxtaposition). In most of his stories, he treats his characters much as Edward Gibbon treats his historical figures - their personal qualities are made (for analysis) into abstract impersonal entities through the technique of narratorial distance - as the author himself hints when he tells us that "this is the story, not of my particular emotions, but of Uqbar and Tlön and Orbis Tertius." "The South" is unlike most of Borges's fictions in another important way in that it is itself a tight-fitting puzzle that does not depend entirely upon ambiguities, vague allusions, or pedantic tone for success. And be- cause it is not scholarly it is successful fiction, much like Cortázar s "Ax- olotl." If the other fictions are also made up of meticulous and anti- chaotic pieces, they are not themselves whole puzzles and depend for their completeness upon "The South" to a much greater extent than "The South" depends upon them - but of course it would be foolish to say that any of the fictions is fully independent; for each fiction, no matter what size piece it adds to the entire Borges puzzle, is a piece, and the whole is incomplete without all of its fragments. What we have with Borges, then, is literary adumbration at its most perplexing, perhaps. At any rate, adumbration of this sort is next to impossible to elucidate, southwest Review 59</page><page sequence="8">a process which may be unnecessary anyway; for in "The South" we have not only the tightest fiction but also the best clues to what Borges is all about. The tone of "The South" may be pedantic, but since the leading character, Juan Dahlmann, a librarian and a frustrated or tired pedant ("the truth was that Dahlmann read very little" in spite of his close association with books), is a more three-dimensional character than those in most of Borgens works, we the readers are removed somewhat from narratorial pedantry. We accept Dahlmann as an almost plausible fic- tional character (almost plausible is good enough - it is all we have in "The Metamorphosis"), and the distance between reader and character which is created by the tone in other Borges stories is successfully bridged here. Freed from the usual scholarly and surreptitiously advanced allu- sions, the story's juxtapositions are effective, even taut. They make us follow Borgest imaginative lines, but instead of depending upon the shock of mono-syllabic-polysyllabic contrast, as the footnote stories do, in "The South" they are a genuine fictional technique because the many concrete images are fluidly blended with choice abstractions that are more exclusively germane to this story than to fragments found in half a dozen other storiesģ For a change, Borges is imagistic: he expresses Dahl- mann^ ideas (as well as his own) and Dahlmann's emotions through clear, precise images. And the story is still solipsistic and, basically, an Eleatic paradox. Although the interrelated images are so profuse that the story, when analyzed, might seem a bit cluttered by them, the overall effect is a smooth, tense story about what must be one of the most important man- against-himself conflicts ever written - that of the identity of a solipsist. Juan Dahlmann, Buenos Airean librarian and therefore a northerner by Argentine standards, and grandson of learned immigrant Johannes Dahl- mann and of maternal grandfather and adventurer Francisco Flores, yearns to escape his humdrum existence for the excitement (and free- dom) of the South, where the abandoned and virtually worthless ranch of grandfather Flores waits for its new owner, Juan Dahlmann; but, being what he is, Dahlmann never even attempts to visit his inheritance until he is advised to do so for convalescence after being treated in a sanitarium for a mysterious injury that has caused a mysterious change in him: the change is from a timid librarian into a full-time solipsist, which 60 winter 1973</page><page sequence="9">also entails a bodily stupor, a condition of lethargy caused by the total mentality of his new world of semiconscious dreaminess. The results are physically disastrous and mentally hellish. The trouble begins in the sanitarium, where "they shone bright lights on him until he was blind and dizzy, auscultated him, and a masked man stuck a needle into his arm. He awoke with a feeling of nausea. . . (Was the man masked so that he could not see himself stick him- self? ) During his recuperation, during which he loses physical sensations, "Dahlmann hated himself in minute detail: he hated his identity, his bodily necessities, his humiliation, the beard which bristled upon his face." But after his release from the sanitarium, "Dahlmann recognized the city with joy on the edge of vertigo: a second before his eyes regis- tered the phenomena themselves, he recalled the corners, the billboards, the modest variety of Buenos Aires. In the yellow light of the new day, all things returned to him." All things mental, that is, and with great intensity. Dahlmann the librarian has mysteriously acquired almost the clairvoyance of Funes the Memorious. But why does Borges describe Dahlmann as hating his humiliation? Is it also a statement by Borges the man of his hatred of physical limitations, of having to be dependent only upon the mind for active living? It is what a man losing his sight, and ultimately blind, would have to depend upon. After supplying us with a background, which is really as important as a precondition in the story of the solipsistic identification of all men with one man as it is a description of how Dahlmann becomes a solipsist (the mysterious head cut is as good a cause as any: exactly when and how does one become a solipsist? ) , Borges begins his story. Every Argentine knows where the South begins and that it is "a more ancient and sterner world." It is, though, in other ways, a freer, a better place to be: it is where the adventurous (as opposed to the merely learned) might go, a more romantic place - and in that sense it is akin to the south of Thomas Mann in his stories of the mentally tortured artist who yearns to escape his cold "northern" life for the warmth and consolation of the south. At the railroad station on his way south, Dahlmann strokes a some- how familiar but aloof cat, which he equates with a "disdainful divinity." But he immediately thinks that his contact with it is "an illusion and that the two beings, man and cat, were as good as separated by a glass, for man lives in time, in succession, while the magical animal lives in the present, in the eternity of the instant." In a short while, Dahlmann, too, southwest Review 61</page><page sequence="10">begins to live in the eternity of the instant: he "closed his book and allowed himself to live." After arriving at his destination, Dahlmann encounters an old gaucho, also immobile like the cat that was always to be found at the same place in the railroad station. Dahlmann is certain that the gaucho is "outside time, situated in eternity," and "that gauchos like this no longer existed outside the South." He has en- countered an aged but Eleatic being, one for whom motion and change are unreal and one who is possible only in the South. Before his arrival, even, Dahlmann had identified with the gaucho, with all men: "it was as if he was two men at a time: the man who traveled through the autumn day and across the geography of the father land, and the other one, locked up in a sanitarium and subject to methodical servitude." And he is, indeed, bound to a methodical servitude, one of the mind: "it might have oc- curred to Dahlmann that he was traveling into the past and not merely south." With time removed as a factor, Dahlmann, at his "destination," which seems preconceived but is actually outside the realm of temporal conception, notices the faded scarlet color of the general store, the same color, he knows, as "the great rose-colored house which' had once been crimson" which he has inherited. And well it might be, for that is the color of the South, as we are told in "The Circular Ruins": "toward the South, the sky took on the rose color of leopard's gums." A mysterious, unexplained event happens to Dahlmann - "the train would not let him off at the regular station but at another," and it ground to a halt "prac- tically in the middle of the plain" - but he is not upset; for long ago he had contented himself with "the certitude that his ranch was waiting for him on a precise site in the middle of the plain." But along with the Eleatic unity of place and thing is the Eleatic unity of person: "Dahlmann thought he recognized the shopkeeper," whom he had never met, and he "was not surprised to learn that the other man, now, knew his name." Preoccupied with the totality of mental associations, Dahlmann is practically nonexistent physically, and "the mechanism of events did not concern him," a nonconcern that is the indirect cause of his probable death. A casual decision to eat at the general store, where he had arrived "to kill time," leads to a series of eerie and unreasonable events that end the story and his life (maybe). Subtly insulted by drunks at the store, Dahlmann attempts to create a totally mental atmosphere, purposely to become truly Eleatic, by denying the reality of the event. But the old gaucho, "in whom Dahlmann saw a 62 winter 1973</page><page sequence="11">summary and cipher of the South," supplies him with a dagger with which to meet the challenge: "It was as if the South had resolved that Dahlmann should accept the duel," and in an "almost instinctive act" he does. Having no experience at but only the notion of knifeplay, Dahlmann goes to the duel "without hope" and "without fear," a condition of fan- tasy. He lives with no belief in the reality of occurrences and without con- ception of time (as though he were even dreaming, or imagining, the entire story). As he goes to his death (real or imagined) without dis- cerning between existence in the sanitarium and in the South, "he felt that to die in a knife fight . . . would have been a liberation, a joy, and a festive occasion, on the first night in the sanitarium, when they stuck him with the needle. He felt that if he had been able to choose, then, or to dream his death, this would have been the death he would have chosen or dreamt." No one can be sure, but the knife may be the needle: he may never have moved off the bed of torture in the sanitarium and he may have dreamed the trip to the South. Or he may be someone else dreaming himself into the role of the contemporary counterpart of the gaucho Martín Fierro, who, ironically in this case, does not return nostalgically to a more humane homeland, as the gaucho of the epic did (or maybe the escape's end is humane, but we mere readers will never know). Or he may be someone else dreaming - but I have played enough into Borges's hands, and refuse to offer further solipsistic possibilities. As a fictional representation of solipsism, though, "The South" is highly symbolic. The South is a place of supposed escape, and in that light the story becomes poignantly ironic and in itself a fulfilled Eleatic paradox. The final passage is a representation of the imagination at work inventing an adventurous romanticism (an ecstatic level of living) which, if extant, could have prevented Dahlmanns withdrawal into the world of fantasy, a withdrawal he both damns and uses for escape. Depending upon how solipsistically you interpret the story, it is either nearly or totally a mental world. But it is a world Dahlmann damns; it is the cause of his humiliation: fearing death, no longer dependent (if we believe the story) upon his body for the sensations of living, he must retreat into his mind, the only place where he is fully alive, and to that extent he has escaped the fear of bodily death; but that is a death that might have provided a lasting extension of the dream world he is living in. No one knows. The only certainty is the bittersweetness of the con- southwest Review 63</page><page sequence="12">dition. The ultimate, unanswered question, then, is whether he hates or merely succumbs to his fully mental dreamlife. The final answers are not found in the story, but may be found in other fragments (very small ones) of the Borges puzzle. In "The Circu- lar Ruins" the South is described as a pure place, a place "where the Zend language has not been contaminated by the Greek and where leprosy is infrequent" - a place, in short, mentally and physically purer than any other. In a footnote in "An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain," Borges mentions an all-powerful solipsism that controls bodily growth to the point of reversing the aging process - a power that saves man from the nothingness after death but which reverses the process so far that man returns to the nothingness of prelife, an extrapolation of Eleatic paradox. But the process is initiated by "certain boreal fruits," so the all-powerful solipsism is a northern phenomenon. In short, the South is the place in which to escape the effects of solipsism. But the Eleatic para- dox is all-inclusive as well as all-powerful: the obvious irony is that, in a world in which time, place, persons, and things are ubiquitous and iden- tical, the condition of solipsism is inescapable: you can't escape solipsism by using it to lose it in a place you have imagined. Such a place is the South. There is no exit for a solipsist of Borgens brand. The condition, when compounded by Eleatic philosophy, cannot be imagined away. The only possible solution - and who can be sure? - is death. Creating an alterbody to bear the onus is not possible, even when you destroy the memory of the alterbody. In "The Circular Ruins," thinking his purpose has been fulfilled by imagining such an alterbody, the man "remained in a kind of ecstasy" until "he understood that he also was an illusion, that someone else was dreaming him." No, the only way out is death - to kill someone or to be killed yourself. In "The End," the immobile Negro realizes that once his righteous task of murder was accomplished "he was nobody. More accurately, he became the stranger: he had no further mission on earth, but he had killed a man." For the Eleatic solipsist, he has killed all men! It is the final stage, the only retreat. It is the same retreat to which poor Dahlmann goes, "without hope" and "without fear," trying not to think of it, trying not to think his way out of it before he is struck by the knife, before death relieves him. Dahlmann tries to preclude a repetition of the irony that lured him to the nonexist- ent South. He tries to let death take him, and the only way to accomplish it is to be mentally numb during the process. That is the condition to 64 winter 1973</page><page sequence="13">which Dahlmann and all of Borges's characters aspire. But, then, no solipsist can count on death, for no solipsist can be certain that his mind will not imagine him back to life even after death, or imagine itself into another body (one about to be born, or conceived?) an instant be- fore death stops his body. Jorge Luis Borges deals in an interchangeable currency of mental phantoms. He is not interested in answers but in representing an in- conclusive game that is all too familiar to him, a practiced solipsist. Rarely do his representations enter the realm of recognizable fiction. But they do, more successfully than anywhere else, in "The South." Per- haps the pieces of his puzzle add up to no more than a warning of the dangers of a too strong imagination. Perhaps their purpose is to instruct other writers, Julio Cortázar among them, how necessary it is to break the boundaries of conventional modern fiction - and perhaps certain fragments of the puzzle are even examples of a new fiction. But one thing is certain: Borges s puzzle is a skillful and carefully calculated addition to the sum of surds in an absurd world of literature. Borgens own words, from "Three Versions of Judas," may well become his own best epitaph: "The writers on heresy, the heresiologists, will no doubt remember him; he added to the concept of the Son, which seemed ex- hausted, the complexities of calamity and evil."</page></plain_text>
