If this is the case, then all I can say in mitigation is that what I have to say here reflects certain thoughts and experiences I have had. If what I say strikes a chord in anyone else, so much the better; if not, then I hope that it will at least stimulate people to explore the reasons for their disagreement with me. A second preliminary remark I want to make concerns my conception of religion and of science. To take science first, as this is less controversial, what I am discussing is contemporary science, realistically understood. In other words, I am taking the theories of science on their own terms, as attempts to understand and describe the world as it really is independently of us. Whether and to what extent scientific theorizing can deliver what it promises is, of course, controversial; however, I hope it can be agreed, at least for the sake of argument, that the prospect of fulfilment of such a promise is and always has been part of the reason people have had for engaging in scientific activity. That we perceive ourselves to be in a world which is independent of us and not fully transparent to our first thoughts and impressions, and that we want to find out more about this world is a large part of the motivation for scientific enquiry. Even if science is also and importantly of great instrumental value to us, its 1 This paper was originally given as part of a symposium of science and religion at the annual conference of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science in Cambridge in September 1990. Versions were presented subsequently at Peterhouse Cambridge and the University of Bradford.</page><page sequence="2">506 Anthony O'Hear instrumental value depends on its actually delivering truths about the world, truths which of necessity are independent of our desires and perceptions. If science is seen as revelatory of a world which has an objective and independent existence apart from us, objectivity, at least in intent, is true of religion as I understand it and wish to consider it. For my purposes the notion of a revelation of a world independent of and transcending human perceptions and desires is crucial to religion. It may be that not all religions rest strongly on the notion of a revealed truth and that the notion of revelation is one particularly attuned to the great monotheisms of semitic origin (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), although I suspect that some notion of a humanly transcendent wisdom revealed in sacred stories and texts is to be found in most religions. Nevertheless, it is the comparison between revealed religion and mature theoretical science which particularly interests me, and which will concern me in this paper. 2 RELIGION AND REVELATION It was in the great period of confrontation between Western science and religion, in the nineteenth century, that strenuous efforts were made by theologians and defenders of religion to prove the naturalness of religion and its conformability to human reason and value. Following the work of Hegel and of David Friedrich Strauss, a flood of books appeared, all purporting to demythologize Christianity, to explain away the miracles of the gospel, to present Jesus as a fundamentally human and historical figure, and to represent the teachings of Christianity as a combination of Hegelian rationalism and secular morality. There were, of course, dissenting voices within Christianity, Kierkegaard naturally and Cardinal Newman, who in A Grammar of Assent memorably insisted that a man who failed to perceive the inscrutable mysteriousness of the revealed doctrine of the Trinity did not understand what it was he was being presented with. However, it was not until the dies ater, the black day in August 1914 when Karl Barth found nearly all the theological teachers he respected endorsing the Kaiser's war, that the tide began to turn against nineteenth century rationalistic, and modernist theology, and the associated attempt to present Jesus as a secular historical figure dispensing some comforting and comfortable version of progressivist humanism.2 In his Church Dogmatics, Barth was to contrast what he referred to as religion-'the most dangerous enemy a man has on this side of the grave'-with the wholly other and utterly transcendent nature of God. For Barth religion was a fundamentally human construction; it is 'unbelief... the one great concern of godless man' ([1936], p. 300). In religion 'man bolts and bars himself against 2 My picture of Barth, and the quotations from his work are drawn from Peter Fuller's discussion of Barth, Ch. 17.</page><page sequence="3">Science and Religion 507 revelation by producing a substitute, by taking away in advance the very thing which has to be given by God' ([1936], p. 302). According to Barth, 'in Jesus the communication of God begins with a rebuff, with the exposure of a vast chasm, with the clear revelation of a great stumbling block' ([1960], pp. 98- 99). For Barth, God was totaliter aliter, wholly other, for the revelation of whom man must prepare himself by not attempting to presume on God's nature by creating religious substitutes for revelation. In theological terms, apart from naturalistic theologizing, Barth's great enemy is Pelagianism, that is, the denial of original sin and the suggestion that man can somehow perfect hismelf without admitting the need for divine grace. In contrast-and here I think Barth's position can seem attractive from a religious point of view-the attitude of the truly religious person is one of humility and patience before the otherness of God; in philosophical terms this may lead to a form of extreme realism about God's nature, an admission that all our thinking about God prior to a divine revelation might be erroneous, a product of human fantasy. Barth is right from a religious point of view at least to the extent that a religion which does not acknowledge the otherness of God, and the consequent need for revelation and grace initiated by God, is likely to subside all too easily into anthropomorphic fantasy and wish fulfilment. Where the otherness of God is not recognized, it will be all too easy for one's conception of God to be no more than a projection of human desires and feelings, a point surely underlined by the history of nineteenth-century rationalistic theology and bibilical study in which God and Jesus are very clearly embodiments of the progressive secular wisdom of the age. (For this, of course, Strauss and other theologians were ruthlessly excoriated by Nietzsche.) I realise that speaking in this way I will pose considerable problems for those who-like myself-do not believe in God or in Christian revelation. If, however, the religious impulse is anything at all it must embrace something of Barth's perception. In other words, it must rest in a strong sense of the limits of human knowledge, of the objectivity and transcendence of the divine, and of the consequent distance between the divine and the human. If the divine is to be object of worship it must lack all taint of contingency: it must be something which, in Aquinas's terms, is 'subsistent existence itself, in no way determined' (Summa Theologiae, Ia.II.4). A being which is not subsistent would be contingent and either dependent on something else or subject to chance. In neither case would it have that completeness and self- sufficiency which would make it right to worship it. It would be a struggler in the realm of existence, as we are ourselves, more powerful perhaps, but an Olympian Kronos or Zeus rather than that eternal being which in Dante's conception turns all else and to which all else tends, and which is turned by nothing in its turn. Equally, to think of God's essence as being in any way determined as being</page><page sequence="4">508 Anthony O'Hear (again in Aquinas's terms) anything other than to exist is suggest that God's essence is somehow capturable by human thought. One might, for example, want to think of God as having power, but this would be very misleading because in our conception power is the ability to overcome obstacles, but for God there are no obstacles to overcome. To speak of God, therefore, as having power is at best a misleading analogy; and the same would be true of anything else we might want to say about God, that he (!) loves, is changeless, etc., etc. All attempts to define God's nature are implicitly to confine God, to make the divine subject to specific and implicitly limited characteristics and hence to open the way to further questioning about the whys and wherefores of God's nature, whereas the direction of the religious impulse is-as we learn from Aquinas once more and from his contemporary followers such as Lonergan- to take us to an act of understanding which leaves no further questions to be asked. If the religious impulse stresses the absolute otherness and self-sufficiency of the divine, it will also emphasise the limitations and imperfections of the human. The doctrine of original sin is an apt expression of the sense of the chasm between the human and the divine, and an apt way of curbing human presumptuousness. Although such things can hardly be quantified it is not, I think, coincidental that the worst societies people have had to suffer under in this century have been inspired by dreams of the Nietzschean superman and a materialist utopia: that is, by a principled and self-conscious denial of human imperfectibility and ignorance. Religion, in emphasizing human frailty and the distance between all human efforts and the truly good and beautiful should clearly have a benign tendency to curb the pretensions to knowledge and wisdom which lead to political totalitarianism. In this respect, Islam may be seen as religiously inferior to Christianity precisely because it lacks any tradition of a distinction between the two cities, the earthly and the divine, and to those quick to speak of Christianity as a theocratic religion, it is worth pointing out that despite well-publicized lapses, more often than not, Christianity has survived and presented itself as a force distinct from, and often actually opposed, to the earthly city and merely temporal rulers. 3 SCIENCE AND RELIGION: CONVERGENCE As I have been emphasizing the way in which religion, properly understood, will tend to reveal truths which could not be foretold by purely human means, and will stress the otherness and objectivity of the divine, let me now, in turning to science, stress the strangeness and otherness of the world-view modern science presents us with. Once atoms had no colour; now they have no shape, place or volume ... There is a reason why metaphysics sounds so passe, so vieux jeu today; for intellectually</page><page sequence="5">Science and Religion 509 challenging perplexities and paradoxes it has been far surpassed by theoretical science. Do the concepts of the Trinity the soul, haecceity, universals, prime matter and potentiality baffle you? They pale beside the unimaginable otherness of closed space-times, event-horizons, EPR correlations and bootstrap models. Thus van Fraassen ([19 8 5], p. 2 58), but now consider to John Pokinghorne on the subject of the intelligibility of quantum mechanics: perhaps we are in the midst of ... (a long) drawn out process of education about the nature of quantum mechanical reality. If we are indeed in such a digestive, living-with-it period, it would explain something which is otherwise puzzling. A great many theoretical physicists would be prepared to express some unease about the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics... but only a tiny fraction of them ever direct serious attention to such questions. Perhaps the majority of them are right to submit themselves to a period of subliminal absorption ([1986], p. 82). The realist about science, here speaking about the quantum world, is not unconscious of the difficulty of understanding the world his physics reveals, any more than Newman was unconscious of the difficulty of understanding the doctrine of the Trinity which his Church reveals. Indeed, in some ways the cases are rather similar: taken individually the various propositions of both the Trinity and quantum mechanics are quite intelligible. The problems arise when you try to put them all together. Maybe the solution is-as Pascal suggested in the case of religion, and as Polkinghorne is suggesting in the case of science-to live with the contradictions, to submit oneself to a period of subliminal absorption in the hope or expectation that eventually a fuller, less paradoxical, understanding might be achieved; I have to say, however, that if a theory really is contradictory, as opposed to simply strange, merely living with the contradictions may produce a mental adjustment to them, but it will not actually do anything to diminish the problem. The realist about the physical world, just as the realist about the divine, might well make the following observation at this point. The human mind, although attuned to reality at certain points, is nevertheless a fallible instrument when it ventures outside its intellectual ecosystem. Is it, then, surprising that it cannot formulate a non-contradictory or unproblematic account either of the divine or of the quantum world? In both cases, the theological and the scientific, an explanation is forthcoming from within the relevant field of enquiry as to why the human mind cannot form an adequate account of the objects in question. In the scientific case, it would be the evolutionary story of the human mind and perceptual faculties being adapted to the perception and understanding of medium-sized physical objects in stable conditions, and not thereby necessarily well-attuned to the very large or the very small. (While some would emphasize the undoubtedly remarkable correlation of mathematical and physical understanding in modern physics</page><page sequence="6">51o Anthony O'Hear something very puzzling in the seventeenth century-I would stress the paradoxes and problems of quantum theory, as evidence of less-than-complete adaptability of mind to matter at this level.) The religious too, will not improperly emphasize the distance between the human and the divine, a distance whose effects of incomprehension on our part are exacerbated by our fall from grace. My conclusion at this point, is that in treating their respective subject- matter realistically, both science and religion lead us into areas in which the human mind is prone to stumble into paradox and contradiction, and in ways that are strikingly similar. 4 NATURAL THEOLOGY What does it mean to have a religious attitude to the world? It is, surely, to take the world and our life and consciousness as being the expression of the mind of a Creating Spirit. It is to see the world as a veil behind which a divine purpose is hidden and, intermittently, revealed. It is to see meaning and will underlying the immense, unrelenting and ultimately meaningless processes of change, growth and decay which make up the physical world. (I agree, by the way, with the traditional theological distinction between deism and Christianity: a truly religious attitide, such as is evinced in orthodox Christianity, would see God or the divine as intimately but silently involved in all material activity, although this may lead to theological difficulties in making the divine subject to the sort of open future classical quantum theory apparently envisages.) If there is a divine face behind the material world, can we learn anything of that face and its purpose from study of the natural world, from what might broadly be called natural theology? The first and most obviously releviht feature of the natural world is its orderliness; the way in which, despite its apparent diversity, complexity and size, its operations manifest a high degree of regularity and mathematically capturable order. Against Richard Swinburne [1979] and others who have argued in this way, we are not entitled to conclude from this that there is or is likely to be a divine designer. The reason for this is that given by C. S. Peirce, namely, that the universe is by definition a unique phenomenon. We have no reason a priori to suppose that a highly ordered one is in more need of a divine creator than a highly chaotic one, or indeed that a highly ordered universe could not have emerged through spontaneous evolution from less ordered states. Nor do we have any experience of supernatural agents creating worlds out of nothing so as to know whether, in the case of this universe, such a thing is probable or not. But we can certainly conclude from the order in the universe that if we are prepared to see the universe as the creation of a divine mind, then that mind must be in comparison with ours, one of great subtlety and intelligence, remembering, of</page><page sequence="7">Science and Religion 511 course, that all such comparisons are strictly relative to our perceptions and natures, and cannot give us any direct knowledge of the divine nature. Apart from the existence of manifold types of order within the universe, the presence of conscious and self-conscious life in the universe may also plausibly be seen as having some significance for religious thought. Unlike some religious thinkers, I am not impressed by the anthropic principle. At least, I find it very hard to accept that from science alone one could deduce anything of metaphysical significance about any chain linking what went on at the moment of the Big Bang to the emergence of conscious life on this earth 15 billion years later. It may well be true that a tiny difference in the conditions obtaining at the Big Bang would have rendered the emergence of conscious life impossible. But it does not follow from that that the scientific evidence supports our seeing the whole universe from the Big Bang onwards as being quasi- intentionally directed to the production of consciousness, if only because of the role of chance and luck. Whatever exists now, clearly and tautologically has to have been foreshadowed in whatever prior conditions were necessary for its development, and, of course, from this tautological truth one might be able to infer a lot from what exists now about what there was and would have to have been ages before (such as covalent bonding at a very early stage in the history of the universe). But one certainly cannot infer from any of this that those prior conditions were put there deliberately to get the later result. The whole process-prior conditions, later result and intermediate stages-could be a product of some overall chance factors. It could, in addition, be chance-ridden at every stage, as on some evolutionary accounts-and rather against the anthropic principle-the emergence and development of life was on this planet. Nevertheless, even if the presence of conscious life in itself gives us no direct argumentative path to the Creator's nature or intentions, it may, like the presence of order, give us some clues as to the nature of the Creator, if there is one. In particular it may inspire us to focus on a notion of the Creator as on having a mind, and as being the mind behind the physical world, and revealed in part by that world. It is from our experience of ourselves and our fellows that we see certain physical movements as expressive of intention and of mind. From a religious point of view, an analogy will be drawn between our embodied consciousness manifesting its intentions in bodily movements, and the divine consciousness permeating the physical world with its meanings and intentions. (Though the problems involved in applying the concept of consciousness to God are immense, for consciousness in us is typically successive and directed towards objects, while for the orthodox, God is both timeless and requires no object outside himself. It is perhaps not coincidental that the notion of the Trinity has often been invoked to deal with these problems, though not, I have to say, in a way that makes them any less intractable.)</page><page sequence="8">512 Anthony O'Hear It will be clear even from these brief remarks that I do not see natural theology as providing any proof of the existence of God, nor indeed any very substantive information about the nature of God, even on the assumption that God exists. The world revealed to us by natural science is, at best, silent on the probability of a divine Creator. 5 SCIENCE AND RELIGION: DIVERGENCES Does science undermine religious faith? Obviously it has done so and often still does, particularly when dogmatic religion over-reaches itself and makes empirically false claims. But such activity on the part of religionists should be condemned as an aspect of perennial temptation which man has to create his own religion in his own image. The question I would like to consider is whether science means that a religious attitude to the world and a patient search for divine revelation is in itself misguided. Playing down the probative force of natural theology, as I have shown, means that scientific investigation can per se have nothing to say either for or against a fundamental religious attitude or insight. What we have in science and in religion are at bottom two separate and non-conflicting modes of discourse. Science is the attempt to classify, describe and explain natural phenomena in mathematico-reductive terms: that is, it sees the great diversity of natural phenomena in terms of the quantifiably describable operations of smaller numbers of objects or processes, which are seen as causally responsible for the phenomena. In so doing, it abstracts from what it sees as causally irrelevant properties of the phenomena, secondary qualities and much else besides. From the point of view of human experience, the scientific picture omits much that is significant and important; this is no criticism of science as such, but only of the attitude of mind which would see scientific discourse as the only valid approach to the world. It is this scientistic frame of mind rather than sciences as such which poses a threat to religion, but such an attitude has a certain shallowness. For one thing, it would repudiate as meaningless questions about the totality of the process within which the objects and processes science treats of operate. One can legitimately fail to follow the religious path in seeing the totality in terms of the intention and sustaining love of a divine will, and, for the sorts of reasons adduced in the section on natural theology, discount the probative power of religious explanations of that totality; but it would surely be misguided to insist that religion is not a genuine attempt to address a genuine question, a question which science cannot within its own terms even raise. In this sense, I agree with John Polkinghorne that theology's 'regal status lies in its commitment to seek, the deepest possible level of understanding' ([1988], p. 1), even though I cannot follow him in thinking that theology (or any actual revelation) actually achieves what it seeks. From where might one come to see the universe in personal terms, and open</page><page sequence="9">Science and Religion 513 oneself to the possibility of some revelation of the will behind the universe? Not, it seems, from science, which for its own purposes strives to eliminate from its world-view everything that pertains to the personal, nor, owing to the inherent weakness of the attempt, from the natural theological attempt to explain the existence of the world in terms of a divine creator. But the failure of natural theology and the ambiguity of the world religiously-speaking, does not mean that the religious can rest on some Barthian notion of a revelation or grace which rests on no human pre-disposition to respond to revelation. At the very least, Barth's position makes it impossible to see why we might be able to respond to a purported revelation at all, or even to see some supposed good news as potentially divinely inspired. In face of the need to find some naturalistic basis for religion, combined with the religiously enigmatic nature of the physical world, the religious impulse to see the world in more than physical terms might most plausibly be seen as stemming from within. It might thus be seen as stemming, in the first place, from that sense of the meaningfulness of our lives which derives from our feeling ourselves bounden by certain duties, duties towards truth, towards goodness, towards beauty, towards our fellow men, towards our ancestors and our children, duties we neither chose nor can abrogate without irreparable damage to ourselves as human beings and to the fabric of human culture and society. The religious impulse might be seen also as a response to the experience of a natural object or a work of art as beautiful: in which we see a thing not just as 'a fragment of nature' (in Wittgenstein's phrase), but as something which mediates between our own longing for perfection and some other world in which that perfection is actually realised. A sense of the unconditional nature of these duties and feelings is undoubtedly sustained by a mature religious faith and, for many religious people at least is made an object of legitimate concern only on the assumption that the universe itself is guided by a personal force which our sense of duty and of beauty in some dim way reflect, and which speaks to us and responds to us through those feelings. Certainly any purely secular account of mortality and aesthetics such as that offered by sociobiology will struggle to make sense of the absoluteness of moral obligation and of the apparently timeless and transcendent sense of rightness one sometimes has in the experience of something beautiful. The non-religious might respond by denying the full force of alleged feeling or sense in either case or by attributing the feelings to sociobiological or psychological causes. The latter move fails to do justice to the intuition many have that thinking of the moral or aesthetic urge in terms of prior causal conditioning does nothing to diminish in them the sense that they remain here and now bound by the absolute demands of morality and aesthetics. If prior causal conditioning extraneous to the actual rightness or wrongness of the demands were all there was to it, once we realised that most, if not all, of our moral and aesthetic attitudes were initially given to us by instinct or upbringing, we</page><page sequence="10">514 Anthony O'Hear would begin to think ourselves as less unconditionally obliged by them than in fact we do. The former move-that of denying the existence of the feelings-of course, remains a possibility: but it is at least arguable that such a denial fails to take into account very significant aspects of human experience. Without being religious one can also find a religious attitude towards one's duties and also towards our need for grace in face of our evident proneness to moral weakness and self-deception ethically and aesthetically preferable to the shallow utopianism of a Marx or to the wilful stridency of a Nietzsche or, even to come closer to home, to the melodramatic posing of a Russell (in A Free Man's Worship) or to the self-proclaimed immoralism of a Keynes (in My Early Beliefs). To treat values and obligations as a matter of choice or as founded in choice and so to be abrogated at will, as Keynes implied, and to see human beings as constrained by nothing higher than their choices and able through those choices to create utopian societies, has not had happy consequences for civilization or for culture, as I hinted earlier. It may also do violence to the psychic health of the individual. Whatever stand one takes on the acceptability of a religious understanding of the world and of human life, though, it is clear that at a deep level, science cannot be seen to conflict with religion, if each activity is properly conceived. The one looks at the world in an impersonal way, prescinding from fundamental questions of the meaning of the whole, while the other takes the whole as given and attempts to see it in terms of personal meaningfulness. Indeed, far from being in a state of mutual conflict, if anything I have just said is correct, science and religion could even be seen to be part of a mutually sustaining harmony. A religious attitude to the world can motivate the desire to understand God's creation better and more truthfully, and also to respect its integrity. Equally the sense of the objectivity and otherness of the world evinced in science can put us on our guard against those religions and ideologies which in effect, and as Barth warned us, idolize human subjectivity. 6 CODA: ANKNUPFUNGSPUNKTE In this paper, I have stressed the way both science and religion treat aspects of reality far beyond normal human experience, the grasp of which may be beyond human intellectual powers. In order to stress the otherness of the subject matter, I have taken as examples of doctrines of science and religion, quantum theory and the Trinity respectively. I have taken a realist attitude to both these doctrines, as I feel that is the only way to take them seriously. I have also focussed on writers, like Karl Barth and John Polkinghorne who, while being realists about their subject matter, are open and explicit about the difficulties the subject matter presents to our understanding, in theological terms about the way it may prove a stumbling block to belief; a scandal to the Jews and to the Greeks, foolishness.</page><page sequence="11">Science and Religion 515 There is, naturally, a danger in this approach. To insist on the divide between divine revelation and our natural experience, and on the way no human language can be adequate to the reality of the divine is to invite the Humean riposte that belief in a God of whom we can know or predicate nothing without falling into error is little different from atheism and liable to lead to scepticism concerning any purported revelation expressed in human and historically definite terms. The hapless Emil Brunner received a thunder- ous 'Nein!' from Barth for his Nature and Grace [1934], for daring to suggest that there were some points of contact (or Ankniipfungspunkte) between human experience and the divine. Therefore, it is hardly to be wondered at that others of Barth's followers were to take the Humean road, and proclaim the death-of- God. Theology's great unfulfilled quest remains that of finding a way of speaking and thinking about the divine while maintaining its otherness, of maintaining the reality and believability of the divine without reducing it to an evident projection of human desires and fantasies. In seeking to locate the soil of religion in human inwardness, as I have done, I am doubtless inviting the Barthian riposte that my approach to religion is merely humanistic projection, particularly as actual religions fail to command my assent. The situation, as I see it, is that we, as humans, have certain inklings of transcendence which it is difficult to naturalise. So the religious quest is not to be ruled out, even if any purported fulfilment of the quest raises as many problems as it solves. But without labouring the point, I am not sure that the situation in physics is so different. Physics, and the other mature sciences, need points of contact, too, between our highly limited and highly specific experience and the worlds they reveal to us. This is a problem which is particularly acute in the case of quantum theory, where the theory itself is beset by paradox and contradiction, but it is one which is raised by any theoretical account of the world which goes beyond whatever we take the experiential data to be. How do we know that it is the account we have which is true rather than the multitude of other possible accounts all equally consistent with our experience? The problem will continue to arise even if we follow Hacking [1983] and Giere [1988] in taking technology legitimately to extend our experience beyond what can be observed by our naked senses. Cyclotrons doubtless give us experience of protons and neutrons; they do not, however, reveal to us what protons are made of or how nuclear forces work. For reasons of which philosophers of science need no reminding, science is always going to strive for ultimate explanations and discoveries, which are beyond human powers to verify or falsify. On the other hand, to push too hard in the direction of empiricism will reduce all our science to some sterile version of instrumentalism. Both science and religion, present the problem of the Ankniipfungspunkt. In both cases, credibility and intelligibility require points of contact between our human world and the worlds of which they speak. There is a sense, too, which we have briefly touched on, in which there is within our human world a need</page><page sequence="12">516 Anthony O'Hear to push out into both those other worlds. In so doing we necessarily begin to lose touch with our own world and, however unwillingly, open ourselves to scepticism and unbelief on the part of our fellows.
