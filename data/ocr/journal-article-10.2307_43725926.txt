<plain_text><page sequence="1">pierre grelot, The Language of Symbolism: Biblical Theology, Semantics, and Exegesis (trans. Christopher R. Smith; Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2006). Pp. x + 238. Paper $19.95. Pierre Grelot's contribution to exegesis and biblical theology, mainly in French, spans five decades. In this most recent work, translated from Le Langage symbolique dans la Bible (Paris: Cerf, 2001), G. provides "in a more critical form, the principles that [he] pro- posed from a theological perspective" (p. 5) in an earlier work (Sens chr√©tien de l'Ancien Testament [Tournai: Desclee, 1961]). In the introduction, G. admits that circumstances pre- vented him from consulting a regular library. Consequently a significant portion of his foot- notes are from his earlier works, giving the book the flavor of a summation of his life's commitment. He seeks "nothing less than a correct understanding of the sacred Scriptures" resulting in "a living relationship with the Holy God revealed definitively in Jesus Christ" (p. 5). This desire forms a backdrop to the book and informs his interpretation of the First Testament. In the first chapter, G. inquires what language is capable of translating faith in order to provide people "a glimpse into the mystery of God and the salvation that is theirs in Jesus Christ" (p. 8). Since both the being of God and the mystery of Christ in glory are "beyond</page><page sequence="2">148 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 any possibility of description" (p. 17), the two Testaments use the language of symbol to "evoke the presence of God, of the 4 world to come,' and of the resurrected Christ in action" (p. 1 8). G. addresses the need for and function of symbolic language to express biblical rev- elation, uncovering in Scripture four categories of symbols: analogical, mythical, figurative, and existential or relational, which are treated in detail in chaps. 2-3. Analogical symbols are the simplest, and they are grounded in the fact that we can speak of God in the image of humanity because we are created "in the image of God" (Gen 1 :27). In chap. 2, G. deals extensively with anthropomorphic metaphors and symbols drawn from family and social life. He claims that our relationship with God, which is part of our interior experience, can be spoken of only by analogy, which is ultimately insufficient because it obscures as much as it reveals. In the third chapter ("Mythical Symbols"), G. defines myth as "any symbolic con- struction that evokes, through imagery, certain domains that are inaccessible to observation" (p. 67). Here he addresses two opposing realms, both of which are unavailable to our imme- diate consciousness but for different reasons: the realm of the divine, or the "world of God," because of "an excess of light," and the realm of physical or moral evil because of an "excess of obscurity" (p. 68). He looks positively on the role of imagination in the construction of symbols, since "[o]ur reason needs support from the imagination if our hearts are to be affected" (p. 70). In chap. 4, G. takes up the figurative symbol, which he claims is found only in biblical revelation and which is typically given insufficient attention by historians of religion. He attributes the development of "the essential language of Christology" to the figurative rereading of prophetic texts. He states that all "prophetic promises" must be reread and rein- terpreted anew in light of Jesus' resurrection. Speaking of the form the relationship with God took in the First Testament, G. regards the faith of Abraham as "the first expression of an interior experience that continues today in the experience of Christians" (p. 150). He traces this Abrahamie experience throughout the First Testament (and then through the NT) through "verbs of relating that describe the search for, or the nearness of, the invisible God, and by expressions that speak of seeing or hearing God" (p. 150). His brief survey demonstrates "God's love for people through the vehicle of the chosen nation, and the commandment for all people to love God in return." Therefore, G. finds it "absurd to contrast a First Testament 'law of fear' with a New Testa- ment 'law of love,' as a strange ignorance of the Scriptures has led some to do" (p. 159). Grelot writes for those who have the task of "translating" the biblical texts into other cultures and languages, which he says "will require a considerable effort if we really want the revelation of God in Christ to take root" (p. 126). He has left us his legacy in this overview of the symbolic language of both Testaments. Helen R.
