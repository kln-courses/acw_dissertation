<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM NOBLE TO NIVEDITA: SISTER NIVEDITA AND HER PASSAGES THROUGH INDIA, 1895-1911 Somak Biswas Studies of the Indo-British colonial encounter have, for a long time, assumed the binary between the colonizer and the colonized as an irreversible process. This binary has informed and imposed an immutability of racial hegemony where empathetic narratives of Indo-British encounter have remained largely a residual category in influencing wider discourses of empire and nation. This paper is an attempt to map the marginal trajectories of such an empathie engagement represented by a transcultural British figure, who - fòr various personal reasons - had made definitive 'passages' to India from the metropole in a non-official capacity. Occupying spaces that were often politically peripheral to the dominant asymmetries of nation and empire, such figures are either sought to be co-opted in nationalist narratives or disregarded in imperialist accounts, their personal passages denied a wider historical significance of their own, the specificities of their anti-imperial gestures of little investment in the discourses of imperialism. This paper would focus on the post- 1896 life of Margaret Noble (1867-1911), the Scottish born Irish disciple of the Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda and her later recognition in public life as Sister Nivedita. Locating Nivedita in a complex set of 'transnational conjuctures', would constitute a close exploration of her negotiations and engagements with a variety of pro and contrarian ideas, individuals and institutions. 'Feeling at Home9 Noble landed in India on the 20th of January, 1898, after deciding to accept Vivekananda as her Master and choosing India as a field to invest her spiritual and physical energies. Her initial years were spent largely on visiting pilgrim sites, attending lectures and making new acquaintances with the intelligentsia of Bengal and India. Much of her earliest correspondences mention these first impressions that enabled her to negotiate an unfamiliar geographical and cultural landscape. Nonetheless, it was the occasional little similarities with her own country that produced a 'home-like feeling', making a complex transformative process a little easier. Such similarities could often be very basic, yet it was these analogous references in her initial letters from India that were fondly remembered and related to her American and British friends within Vivekanda's circle, particularly Sarah Bull, Mrs. Hammond, Josephine Mcleod, and Christine Greenstidel: It is so funny to get to a country in the time of roses and green peas, and to value a rose just as one would do at home.1</page><page sequence="2">Modem India 791 There is a kind of pine, called deodar, very like a larch and very like a cedar, huge, magnificent, and fragrant with the blackberry odour of English autumns.2 It is these references that give us a glimpse of the ways in which the first impressions of India was registered, remembered and negotiated at an everyday level. Replete with tropes of familiarity and difference - details such as botanical minutiae to geographical trivia - become a refrain in the continuous processing of experiences in an alien land to produce a home-like feeling for Noble. Simultaneous to this spatial familiarization were her forays into the intimate lives of the members of the Ramakrishna Mission network. Of particular importance was Sarada Devi, the authoritative and orthodox Brahmin widow of Ramakrishna, who accepted Margaret as her 'daughter' despite all the caste taboos and restrictions that bound her. This was a rare moment of inversion for both Sarada Devi and Noble. This was a remarkable gesture of kindness that touched her deeply.3 It was these little instances of frank affection, these small moments of intimate inversions within the immediate fold of the Ramakrishna Mission network that created a transcultural space of affective connect for her to relate with the object of her service. It also fostered a network of emotive gestures that enabled her to become an insider, erasing much of her cultural otherness. The creation of such a connect or space, however, did not render received notions on the goodness of empire immediately invalid. Such beliefs and assertions existed quite comfortably in her initial days of India, sometimes in ways that betray her ignorance of both the Ramakrishna Mission as well as its relevance in India: this [the Ramakrishna Mission] movement is no less than the consolidation of the Empire along spiritual lines.4 Engaging with India The years 1898-1900 saw her being established as a prolific speaker among the intelligentsia of Calcutta. Her access to the prominent public platforms of the city brought her in close contact with several prominent members of the Brahmo Samaj (of both the Adi and the Nababidhan factions) - Bipin Chandra Pal, the Tagore and Bose families in particular were of considerable significance. The Brahmo Samaj's acknowledgement of Vivekananda's celebration as a 'world' leader of Hinduism was at best labored and ambiguous. In his later life, Keshab Sen had moved nearer to Ramakrishna and sought his company, but the attitude of the Adi Brahmo Samaj remained difficult and tense towards Vivekananda and the Ramakrishna Mission. It seems Nivedita had imbibed these tensions early in her Indian career. Tensions often became frank confrontations with members of the Brahmo Samaj on issues such as Hinduism, Vivekananda and women. In 1900, Bipin Chandra Pal, then a Brahmo preacher and temperance advocate,</page><page sequence="3">792 IHC: Proceedings , 75th Session , 2014 recounts his first impression of meeting Nivedita in New York at the home of Sara Ole Bull, widow of the reputed Norwegian musician Ole Bull, and a wealthy American disciple of Vivekananda: "and she had a deep disrespect for the Brahmo Samaj."5 Pal insisted, quite forcefully, that had the shastric caste injunctions had still been in place, neither he nor Vivekananda could have become religious preachers for they were not Brahmins, and would probably have been stuffed molten lead down their throats for this blasphemous transgression.6 Contending that the orthodox Hindu society has still not accepted Vivekananda as a guru, Pal argued that he was only as a social and religious reformer like Rammohan Roy. Nivedita was furious: "It is a lie. The swami has been accepted as the Guru of Hindus".7 Notwithstanding these frictions, Nivedita went on to write in Pal's paper New India, founded during the swadeshi movement, much of whose material later went into writing her book The Web of Indian Life . Pal praised Nivedita as the only European to have truly identified with India for her complete 'self effacement' and an 'all-consuming passion' for India that few Indians could match in its depth and feeling.8 Yet, her networking with the Brahmo Samaj was not merely an innocent gesture of friendship, but also an ambitious step to convert the energies and clout of the Samaj to that of Vivekananda's fledgling Mission. Vivekananda, visualizing the strategic prospects of her acquaintances for the Ramakrishna Mission Movement, took an active interest in her social circles and advised Nivedita to '[m]ake inroads into the Brahmos'. Accordingly, she arranged a tea party event so that Vivekananda could address her 'Brahmo friends.9 While the senior Tagores and other Brahmo members remained indifferent to Vivekananda and Nivedita's overtures to make inroads, it were the younger Tagores - Sarala and Surendranath - who had warmed up to her and Vivekananda's ideas. Nivedita perhaps overestimated these signs of breach as a rout too soon. There was little love lost on Vivekananda for the Tagore family or vice versa. Nivedita confides in Josephine Macleod, an American disciple of Vivekananda, his contempt for the Tagore family, and Rabindranath in particular about how the swami used to caution her about socializing with the Tagore family in particular: "as long as you go on mixing with that [Tagore] family, I must go on sounding my gong. Remember that that family has poured a flood of erotic venom over Bengal.... my mission is simply to bring MANHOOD to this people.10 Tagore and Nivedita may not have been the best of friends but they certainly shared, between themselves, a deep affection for the brilliant biophysicist Jagadish Bose, also a member of the Adi Brahmo Samaj. Bose's initial impression of Nivedita was, however, not flattering. Nivedita recounts to Josephine that "he told me with some bitterness that ... at present my dreadful narrowness hurt him unbearably." He thought of Vivekananda's guru Ramakrishna as "a man cast in a narrow mould - a man who held woman to be something half fiend - so that when he saw one He had a fit."11 Notwithstanding their differences, both Nivedita and</page><page sequence="4">Modem India 793 Vivekananda attended Bose's lecture on 'Response of Inorganic and Living Matter' at the International Congress of Physics at Paris in 1900. In December Bose suddenly fell seriously ill while he was in England and it was Nivedita who nursed him back to health at her mother's house at Wimbledon. She came to his side at a time when many British scientists tried to shut him out and his efforts. Nivedita undertook to edit Bose's writings at a nominal payment, and arranged with Sara Chapman Bull, a wealthy American disciple of Vivekananda to provide Bose with a handsome stipend to tide over his research fund crisis at London. Her deep interest and extensive reporting on Bose's work and achievements were beyond comparison. Yet, here too, she demonstrated the tendency to appropriate any achievement made by an Indian who followed some form of Hinduism as 'characteristically Hindu'. She projected Bose's scientific hypothesis of a 'vital force' that pervaded all living and non-living objects as an overwhelming account of how Indian seers and their philosophy are easily capable to explain the bases of modern science: "it is not the least remarkable fact about his great theory... that this comprehensive conception should have revealed itself to a Hindu mind".12 Nivedita was, in all these years, trying to make modern science meet what she understood as the Vedantic truth of Unity. Bose's work provided her a hope to realize that conviction. Veering towards the Political: Beliefs in Practice By 1902, Nivedita was gradually veering around the opinion that political freedom for India was a necessary pre-condition for all other kinds of freedom, including the spiritual. Priorities too changed owing to her steady interest in politics, causing the formal separation of Nivedita from the Ramakrishna Mission after Vivekananda's death. Vivekananda provided her with a certain immunity and independence in her activities, despite formally being a part of the Ramakrishna Mission. After his demise, the apolitical' Mission, now seeking ideological compliance and coherence, asked her to choose between politics and religion. Though painful, she could "but acquiesce in any measures that are necessary to my complete freedom".13 Increasingly, her gestures, involvements and commitments shifted to a more political register, where British acts of domination created a sense of self- guilt that consumed her national pride. In this sense, the swadeshi movement provided Nivedita a timely political space to articulate her self-guilit and dissent through a more active participation in anti-colonial efforts within Bengal and beyond. The political turn in Nivedita saw her increasingly networking and corresponding with prominent political figures of the day. The Congress and Congressmen became an interface that mediated this shift to a more explicitly political agenda of anti-British resistance. Dialoguing with several prominent men associated with active politics, she saw in Congress the political</page><page sequence="5">794 IHC: Proceedings , 75th Session, 2014 expression of a wider desire for nationality14, and despite her clear preference for the Extremist side, had cordial relationships with members of both factions. This section will closely examine in detail the dynamics of her interpersonal relationships with various individuals and institutions after her break with the Ramakrishna Mission in 1902 - the Dawn Society, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, R.C. Dutt, Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghose as well as others - the various ways through which she was influenced by and influenced them, and how they created an intricate network of overlapping solidarities through which Nivedita could inspire, identify and invest her energies in. Interests as diverse as but not unrelated ranged from body- building activities to a fight for greater Indian representation in Councils - reflect a telling manifestation of the transitivity manifest in her politics - efforts which she saw as interconnected in the greater design of nation- welding. The modalities of her intersubjective encounters created spaces to demonstrate her Indian-ness in no uncertain terms - acknowledgements and appreciations from noted political protagonists of Moderate, Extremist and revolutionary strands affirmed this process of inclusion from a liminal to a more consolidated mainstream position. Simultaneously, the discovery of a solitary British figure who was more empathetic and energetic in her anti- colonial investments than many others was a rarity that Indian politicians who came to know her coveted and embraced eagerly. Political intersubjectivity, therefore, envisaged strategies of appropriation that were actively deployed by both sides. For Nivedita, it affirmed inclusion and acceptance; for Indians involved in a wide variety of resistances against the British colonial state, it signified a moral victory and vindication of their dissent. The anti-British tenor of Nivedita's radicalism was also greatly nourished by the Partition of Bengal in 1905 and the discourses of extremism and autonomy it bred. The narrative of deficit masculinity provides us an important entry point in the political and intellectual milieu of Bengal at this time. The feebleness, cowardice, volubility and effeminacy of Bengali baboos informed much official and nón-official British discourse on India, and the Bengali came to represent the lowest rungs of masculinity in the colonial ordering of manliness in India. 15 As Nivedita puts it, "through the swadeshi movement, the Indian people have found an opportunity to make themselves respected by the whole world... the note of manliness and self- help is sounded throughout the movement."16 While Nivedita was not impressed by Gokhale's brand of Moderate politics; yet at the same time she was deeply appreciative of Gokahle's efforts within the Council: "it is with very great pleasure that I offer you congratulations on your recent speech in Council and the impression which your scope and attitude have created".17 Acknowledging that his work is more 'stable and enduring', she is emphatic that it will endure because of people like her, who went down the road of uncompromising opposition to British rule.18 Despite obvious differences in their political thrusts, Nivedita valued and cherished Gokhale's friendship deeply - . .1 trust that you will</page><page sequence="6">Modem India 795 not now break off a friendship in which you have already pardoned so much."19 Gokhale's 'manly speech, manly strength' appealed to her immensely, and fitted her frequent emphasis on masculinity as a desirous attribute for her man-making mission to weld India into a potent nationality. As a gesture of friendship and admiration, Gokhale invited Nivedita to attend the Benares Congress, to be held in December, 1905 in which he was appointed as the President. Nivedita was quite excited about the prospects of attending the Congress and despite misgivings about addressing huge crowds "who come prepared to be excited, but not to think"20, she ended up giving a valedictory remark at the Benares Congress. While thanking Gokhale and the Congress members for giving him the opportunity to demonstrate his leadership abilities, she invoked the audience to rescue Britain from itself and restore its traditions of freedom and nationality against imperialism: "Has the England of so many emancipations grievously forgotten her great role.... Indian people! Stand by and redeem English tradition... redeem England... redeem Europe... our dream of an Indian nationality is not a selfish dream for India, but it is a dream for humanity (cheers)".21 A particularly striking feature of this address is her identification, appropriation and presentation of a British past sanitized of its imperial habits, standing for national self-determination and civic freedom. The redemptive mission and vision she placed before the Congress had a dual function: anti-colonial efforts in India and elsewhere were not only about freeing the colony from the imperial metropole, but also the metropole from empire. In such efforts, British and by extension Western European constitutional and democratic practices were not be overridden by any institutional mechanisms pertaining to India's pre-British temporality, but sought to be reclaimed and emulated as an authentic non-imperial traditions necessary for nation-building. Hence, while Nivedita's assertions against British empire were bitter and often vitriolic, her belief in the instrumentality of British modalities was decisive when it came to organizing symbolic and institutional expressions of national self-determination. Imagining the Nation While the anti-partition movement in Bengal had stressed the urgency of nation-building as never before, landscapes - both physical and cognitive were actively rendered into the imaginaries of nation-building. A particularly telling instance of this cartographic imagination found expression in Nivedita's abiding preoccupation with a national flag for India, since at least 1905. In her quest for a symbol that would sufficiently and simultaneously project a cartographic unity and Indian-ness, she was fascinated by the Vajra or the Thunderbolt during her visit to Bodh Gaya inl904.22 In her detailed consideration of the suitability of the Vajra as a symbol for the national flag for India, she completely glossed over the Sultanate and Mughal periods, probably because she did not consider them Indian enough. Through this exercise, Nivedita was not simply constructing an imagery for the Indian nation, but also negotiating her own cultural differences to a more acceptable register. The detailed explanation of the cross-cultural significance of the</page><page sequence="7">796 IHC: Proceedings , 75th Session, 2014 Thunderbolt in the ancient Greco-Roman religious repertoire resonated with her at various levels - not only did it underline its similar, though parallel trajectories in the 'West' and the 'East', its cross-cultural significance authenticated her own efforts and investments in creating a national symbol for India. Nivedita's flag, following Western instances, was an attempt to create an emotive potency around a symbol that would seek to invoke the sentimentality of the nation's geography. The flag and the nation became intrinsic agents to a dual performance - the flag as an affective site to impress the coherence of the Indian nation, and conversely the nation as a site to invoke the urgency of the flag. Idealized images of the Bharat Mata as a Hindu goddess icon were pressed into service during the swadeshi phase to express the cartographic angst represented by the partition of Bengal. Images of Mother India created by Bengali artists such as Abanindranath Tagore and Asit Kumar Haldar during the swadeshi movement were superimposed onto various Indian flags to doubly reinforce the catastrophic magnitude created by the division of Bengal. Nivedita's enthusiastic appraisal of Abanindranath Tagore 's Bharatmata as a 'true Indian painting' led her to theorize elaborately on how art and artistic creations could embed a sense of nationality in a plethora of diverse communities such as India. Indeed, art was no longer simply for the sake of art but "like science, like education, like industry, like trade... must now be followed for the remaking of the Motherland and for no other aim".23 Commending Tagore's Bharatmata, she asserted that the image represents for the first time the "spirit of the motherland, giver of all food, yet eternally virgin, eternally raft from human sense in prayer and gift... is she not after all, our very own,... at once mother and daughter of the Indian land[?]".24 The conscious anthropomorphization of the nation as a desexualized virginal female figure, albeit as a daughter and mother, resonated with the ideal Vivekananda had set for Nivedita - that of a chaste Hindu Brahmin brahmacharini. The identity of the Hinduized iconography of the Bharatmata as a martial goddess was also fused with her personal penchant for the goddess Kali, the fearful, but loving Mother, slayer of demons and evil.25 Anthropomorphic manifestations, in Nivedita's view, sustained and informed the geographical imagination of the nation. R.C. Majumdar, the illustrious historian who was then a student at Calcutta, refers to Nivedita's passionate speeches on swadeshi and nationalism during this time: "When this Irish woman spoke in her brahmacharini 's dress, the audience used to listen to her inspiring message and be spellbound. ...we used to perceive a living image of Mother India through her fiery speeches."26 Nivedita appeal as a feisty embodiment of the spirit of Bharatmata inspired not only Calcutta youths like R.C. Majumdar drawn towards extremist politics, but also distant figures as the C. Subramania Bharathi, a pioneering modern Tamil poet and journalist. Bharathi's biographer, Prema Nandakumar attributes this meeting to a significant shift in Bharathi's perception of and engagement with the extremist ideology espoused by the swadeshi movement and women's education efforts. By 1907, Bharathi became deeply involved in organizing and disseminating the message of extremist politics propounded by Tilak, Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo and Bipin</page><page sequence="8">Modem India 797 Chandra Pal in Madras. In 1908 and 1909, he published his first two volumes on patriotic Tamil poetry, Swadesh Geetangal and Janmabhumi, in which he invokes hymns to India as the Mother and Motherland. Nivedita's profound influence on Bharathi can be anticipated from the fact that he dedicated both these volumes to Nivedita, whom he addressed as 'Gurumani'.27 Conclusion As she gradually veered to a position of complete opposition to the British Empire in India, her position in mainstream Indian politics became more and more secure. The messiness of this transcultural dialectical space produced an excess of meaning that rendered her passage to India a continuously negotiated process, partly dissolving such polarities as subject- sovereign, power-resistance, and mimcry or provincialization, and enabling us glimpses of highly fluid encounters that could go well beyond irrevocable alterities.
