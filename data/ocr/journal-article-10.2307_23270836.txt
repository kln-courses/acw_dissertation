Madison, WI and London: The University of Wisconsin Press, 2011. Paper, US$29.95. ISBN: 978-0 299-24824-6. doi: 10.1017/S0009840X11003271 This volume features six thought-provoking essays on the question of the author and the materiality of the page. B. opens his book with the intriguing history of the page, both as process (the draft) and final product (the book), tracing its adaptation through changing media and technology, from scroll to codex, from manuscript to book, and beyond. The page's materiality, which B. conceives both literally and figuratively, then becomes a hermeneutic framework for his search for six (ancient and medieval) authors: Thucydides, Lucretius, Cicero, Virgil, Seneca and the Carolingian female author Dhuoda. Each essay offers a kind of portrait of the authors 'at work', drawing attention to specific, albeit brief, glimpses in which the page that they write can be seen to become a locus for their material, rather than intellectual, struggle as creators. Thus, for instance, the page on which Thucydides describes the effects of plague of Athens is to B. a 'symptom-riddled text' (Chapter 2, p. 34), its lexical feel being analogous to the manifestation of his own (allegedly?) bodily symptoms. Through the Thucydidean page, therefore, we can rediscover a 'Thucydides (writing the symptoms of plague) reading Thucydides (suffering the symptoms of the plague)', a 'Narcissean' kind of reader, able to contemplate his struggle with the diseased self on the page that he composes (p. 36). Likewise, Seneca's page turns the philosophical writer into another kind of Narcissean reader, as he contemplates and delves into the surface of the wax of his own tablets, searching for the very depth of the soul (Chapter 5). Though each essay approaches the page's material texture from a particular angle (e.g. page as 'decomposition' [Chapter 3]; the 'erasable' page [Chapter 4]; the page as 'mirror' and 'tomb' [Chapter 6]), and with contrasting aims in mind, as a whole, B. sustains the argument that 'what may matter the most about the material text is that it is the most obvious place where writers become their own first readers' (p. 11). Perhaps more pointedly, it invites us, readers rapidly moving into the digital age of reading, to rediscover the page in all its materiality, as a space where the idea of the author, long 'put to death' by Roland Barthes (1968), can be recovered, without compromising poststructuralist credentials and beliefs. It may be the case that, to the reader used to a tight argumentative method and rigour, this book might come across as elusive. In a discursive style that combines a strong lyrical voice with sound classical learning, it resembles the critical manner of Italo Calvino in his Six Memos for the Next Millennium (1988), or Umberto Eco's critical prose. B.'s argumentative discourse, in spite of some distinct differ ences, is not dissimilar from Anne Carson's 'fictional criticism' manner in Eros The Classical Review vol. 62 no. 1 Â© The Classical Association 2012; all rights reserved</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 145 the Bittersweet. Some readers may therefore find that the most concrete ideas explored in B.'s book emerge in somewhat abstract form, while the abstract tends to find its way through tangible, often illuminating, illustrations. This aspect of B.'s work is in itself an indication of the state of play in some branches of literary criticism, which blend critical analysis with a sense of the fictional and abstract (cf. Piglia, Critica y fiction [1986]) and are less preoccupied with conforming to more traditional, strictly scientific, modes of exposition. Methodologically speaking, moreover, the subtitle of this book points to another distinct branch of literary criticism. As with the gradual emergence of 'career criticism', which explores literary careers with the belief that authors are 'mediated through texts, which in turn are received by readers' (P. Hardie and H. Moore [edd.] [2010], p. 1), B. builds his argument from a post-'death of the author' perspective, avoiding the old claims of biographical criticism; '[n]ot the author as authority ... as God ... but ... as one who is working ... the author as writer', as B. puts it (p. 4). Yet it is B.'s coupling of the concepts of reader and author that emerges as the most innovative aspect of his methodology. Chapter 1, 'The Backward Glance', is the best example of this approach: it sees the Orphic look back as a paradigm for grasping the backward glance of poetic imitation (p. 20). This chapter offers the most incisive discussion in the book, especially on the topic of both authorial self revision and the retracing of the textual 'gaps' that an author finds in his reading of the literary tradition. Hence we catch a glimpse of an Orphic Virgil in Aeneid 2 and 9 who retraces the path taken by the Virgil of Georgics 4; or of a more complex Orphic Ovid in Metamorphoses 11, who looks back on Metamorphoses 10 while retracing the steps of Virgil's backward glance. This chapter includes a brief but illuminating note on the retractatio (pp. 20-1), a rhetorical form of (self-) imitation, and a concept which might inspire those interested in developing ideas about authorial 'self-reception'. Also appealing are B.'s analyses of the 'spectacular paradox' that emerges in the Lucretian page at the close of De rerum natura 6, which a fictional Cicero reads as an '(anthropomorphic) composition of a scene of bodily decomposition' (p. 59, Chapter 3), and of Cicero's fascination with the idea of the erasable page, an erasability which implies both a freedom and a fixity of the literary self (Chapter 4). All the essays underscore the idea that 'working authors' are the first (and closer?) readers of their own page, as they engage in scenes of creation, imitation and appropriation of their literary past. Not every essay in this book convinces in equal measure, though, and the argumentative structure can be labyrinthine at times, demanding an effort on the reader's part to hold on to central thoughts while allowing for digressions and detours (a case in point is Chapter 3's focus on the vermiculate as a metaphor for the page decomposition - earlier signposting of the crux of the argument would have enhanced the interesting ideas presented there). Moreover, one is not always certain of how close readings of ancient texts sometimes shift from the literal to the metaphorical in B.'s endeavour to illustrate the analogical force that he posits in them (e.g. his observations about the brief lacuna in the parchment containing the last six lines of the DRN, which Karl Lachmann observed could have been the result of a puncture in the parchment itself, are rendered in a parenthesised note as analogous to 'the skin of victims ... echoed by the skin that tells the story' [p. 61] - an interesting, albeit arguably metaphorically far-fetched point). Lastly, when it comes to matters of textuality, which feature prominently in B.'s visualisation of the page as a 'palimpsest in reverse' (p. 6), one misses a footnote to Genette, as well as to studies of the Genettean palimpsest as a critical and</page><page sequence="3">146 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW theoretical framework for approaching literary studies such as B.'s (e.g. S. Dillon, The Palimpsest [2007]). This book remains a pleasure to read, especially for its intriguing and novel ideas, for its brave attempt to rediscover the concept of the author as reader through a poststructuralist lens, and for offering variant paths to reinterpreting the work and creative drive of canonical writers.
