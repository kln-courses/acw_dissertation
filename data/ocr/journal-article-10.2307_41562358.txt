<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mtepe: The Origins and Longevity of an East African Craft The breeze moving south to north across the gentle swell of the dark blue Indian Ocean was sufficient to fill the sail. On shore a man standing inside his house began to etch a picture into the coral block wall as he watched. Inspired by the sea, the man's knife traced the outline of a ship. It was unlike the Arab ship he had seen the day before, resplendent with a cotton lateen sail. Rather this ship lumbered along powered by a square sail of coconut matting (makuti). The craft depicted in man's drawing did not heel over with billowing sail. Instead, the mast remained nearly upright and as the ship broached the sea the sewn planks of the hull creaked. On the pointed aft deck the navigator held the tiller as he steered a course parallel with the coastline. Some of the fifteen man crew cooked under the makuti roof of the crew hut which had been erected atop the open cargo hold. As a mid -day meal was prepared over a charcoal brazier, a lone fishing member of the crew stood near the 'camel's head' prow on a stringer which spanned the open hull. This same stringer system had been used by the ancient Egyptian shipwrights to fortify the hulls of mortised and pegged ship hulls against the crushing pressure of the sea. Such was the scene which may have inspired the graffiti -type etchings later recorded by Garlake and dated to the thirteenth century A.D.,1 some seven centuries before during the 1930s the last of the Mtepe' s were built by the Bajuni peoples of the Lamu Archipelago.2 This dating, however, does not preclude a much earlier origin of the type, as Thomas Wilson has pointed out: . . . habitation on the [East African coast] must have been continuous and increasing from the ninth century, [although] it is not until about the twelfth century that there is archaeo- logical . . . evidence for the spread of coast [Swahili] culture.3 By the thirteenth century A.D. Swahili towns were flourishing at Mombasa, Malindi, Gedi, Kilepwe, and other sites such as Ungwana on the mouth of the Taña river. All of these sites were located in present day Kenya and Tanzania. As political events on the mainland took a turn for the worse, the Mtepe provided a vital link with that main- land as increasing numbers of more easily defended townsites were founded offshore.4 Thus, the Mtepe may well have been used for several functions during its recorded five-hundred-year history. These functions would have included: 1. Coastal trade. 2. Ferrying people and household effects between island townsites and their respective hinterlands. 3. The transport of food supplies for townsites which depended heavily on the crop and animal rearing hinterland on the mainland. 4. The provision of emergency evacuation craft in case of siege by marauding non-Swahili peoples. 5. Reconnaissance which, because of the relatively shallow draft of the craft may have been useful in exploring shallow creek and estuarine areas found especi- ally in parts of the north Kenya coast. The first dated etchings of the Mtepe correlate with what Allen has referred to as a period of efflorescence for Swahili towns along the East African coast.5 It is quite pos- 1</page><page sequence="2">SENT ANCE sible that variants of the Mtepe were in use along the East African coast well before this period of efflorescence may be said to have begun, i.e., in the ninth century A.D. when, as archaeology indicates, these towns were founded.6 The 'sewn' boats of Rhapta should also be remembered in this context as they were mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea in an area which has been tentatively located by Allen in the Rufiji river of Tanzania and dated to the first century A.D.7 No examples of the Mtepe or possible ancestral variants can yet be established prior to the thirteenth century A.D. Moreover, as the trans-oceanic lateen-rigged Arab dhows helped draw the East African littoral into the Indian Ocean trade nexus with the Far East, opportunities for borrowing Islamic traditions in the form of oculi and flag decoration on the Mtepe were increased.8 9 As Jewell has pointed out the Mtepe must have looked: . . . distinguished at sea with her colourful prow and stern decorations . . . there being an oculus on the stem post as well as the camel's eye at the prow. The red paint is supposed to represent the torturing of the camel at the hands of the impious Arabs . . .10 Prins has used such information to establish an Arabian Gulf provenance for the Mtepe whereas Hornell viewed the decorative oculi on the bow and rudder-post as evidence of Indonesian origin.11 12 By contrast, this paper focuses on the indigenous Indian Ocean technological tradition from which the Mtepe arose. A review of this technological tradition shows the Mtepe to have evolved in response to Swahili coastal community needs. Moreover, the Mtepe performed a variety of functions over a five- hundred-year period with little change in basic technological design. This longevity of service was extended by the cheapness and availability of local materials (maku ti, coir rope, and hard woods) and manpower (an average, roughly, of fifteen men per crew) which went into the building and operating of the Mtepe. This paper will examine the Mtepe from four perspectives: A. The historical interaction of Indian Ocean maritime cultures. B . T rading requirements . C. The relative shipbuilding capability of specific maritime cultures. D. The availability of shipbuilding materials. THE ORIGIN OF SEWN SHIPS IN THE INDIAN OCEAN The first recorded use of sewn boats in lands associated with the Indian Ocean dates to the Tassili frescoes recorded by Lhote in the Sahara.13 These prehistoric records of a time when the Sahara was considerably damper than now have been dated to between the sixth and second millenia B.C.14 Similarly, Oates has postulated the use of sea- faring craft during the fifth millenium B.C. in the Arabian Gulf.15 Oates' assumption was based on non-pictographic evidence whereas the Tassili frescoes have been inter- preted as boats of reed.16 Moreover, Landström considers that papyrus and reed stereotypes of Egyptian river-craft continued to be used well into dynastic times.17 Heyerdahl postulates for the period of the Old Kingdom the use of reed craft in regular trade with proto-Phoenecian Byblos.18 Heyerdahl believes that this trade be- tween Egypt and Lebanon in the Mediterranean involved the export of reeds to Byblos for use in shipbuilding prior to the use of wood.19 Heyerdahl also quotes a reference to Eratosthenes in Pliny suggesting that reed ships were used by the Egyptians in trade with Ceylon.20 Such trade would have meant the use of reed ships in Indian Ocean trade from at least the third millenium B.C. This early evidence has been supple- 2</page><page sequence="3">THE MTEPE merited by Johnstone's conclusion that reed ships were used in trade between the Harappan civilization and the peoples associated with the Arabian Gulf.21 The recording of reed craft use in the north fringing area of the Indian Ocean dated to the third millenium B.C. is indicative of a prolonged period of experimentation before wood was regularly used in ship construction in this area of the Indian Ocean. Moreover, reed craft were bound or 'sewn' together thus providing the reservoir of skills for the 'sewing' of hull planks together. Petrie has pointed to the significance of the subsequent use of copper tools and of improved woodwork.22 The introduction of copper tools into Egypt appears to have coincided with the increased use of wood in Egyptian shipbuilding.23 The use of timber by Egyptian shipwrights enabled the building of durable craft for regular sea trade. Hatshepsut's expeditions to Punt in 1500 B.C. exhibited the most recent developments of Egyptian shipbuilding capability. The papyriform inspired umbels were retained fore-and-aft on Hatshepsut's wooden ships.24 Thereafter, the ability of the Egyptians to 'sew' planks together in hull construction has been well demonstrated in the reconstruction of King Cheops' Royal Ship, a riverine craft.25 Thus, on the basis of maritime technological capability both in Egypt and the Arabian Gulf, it would appear to be a clearly established fact that reed ships were the prototypes for wooden sewn ships of the Indian Ocean. The question of provenance and the subsequent development of sewn hull building techniques in areas of the Indian Ocean, not directly recorded in the Egyptian pictorial record, has to be answered more tentatively. But the Sabaeans, located at the southern end of the Red Sea, are known to have sailed sewn hulled ships in controlling the transit trade of their area during the first millenium B.C.26 Similarly, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea refers to the sewn boats of Rhapta, an area thought to have been located somewhere on the East African coast.27 By the third millenium B.C., when Aegean shipbuilding techniques penetrated the Indian Ocean area during the time of Alexander, the sewn boat tradition of the Indian Ocean had an ancient ancestry of at least four millenia. Interaction between the mortise and tenon tradition of the Aegean and Mediter- ranean and the sewn ships of the Indian Ocean appears to have lead to some hybrid- ization in shipbuilding technique. As early as 1940 Poujade pointed to Macedonian ancestry for the Arab -built Dungiyah,28 while Le Baron Bowen argues for Roman influence in the introduction of frames to the hull construction of Indian Ocean craft.29 Variations of hull building technique were thus early established in the Indian Ocean. Different techniques of hull building not only occurred because of different shipbuilding traditions but also because of the availability of varying materials. Both Heyerdahl and Johnstone have pointed to the early use of timber in shipbuilding by the proto-Phoenecians and the Harappans owing to the availability of suitable ship- building wood.30 Furthermore, the Harappans are known to have traded timber extensively with areas surrounding the Arabian Gulf.31 It was this trade that according to Johnstone encouraged the translation of reed to wood prototypes in the Arabian Gulf area.32 As in the case of Egypt, the introduction of metal tools combined with in- creased trade along the northern fringe of the ocean stimulated the development of sewn, edge-to-edge (carvel) planking. Johnstone points out that the origins of Harap- pan and Arabian Gulf shipbuilding were distinct from each other. As he says: Some of the Harappan examples would have dug-out keel bases and their planking may have been edge joined with dowels and tenons. The Arabian craft, on the other hand, were most likely flat bottomed at first, and only through Harappan influence and timber did they convert in some cases to the dug-out keel principle to give the added strength needed by the mast and sail . 33 3</page><page sequence="4">SENTANCE Ш g ш о t- • со ш а. ш £ ш e п tí V 6 в л J с Ö с/з V +-J и Он св ТЗ 0J rd и О J HnÍ 43 тз о e л &lt;-м О сл &lt;U Sm 2 и 'Sn 6 о £ CJ тз л 6 ьо с s л &gt;н тз Ü с J &lt;*&gt; VJ V» s о &lt;п 4</page><page sequence="5">THE MTEPE Johnstone's explanation of diverse hull construction origins also makes sense in the context of the East African coast. In this area the Mtepe and the Ngalawa have been generally considered to have a historically lengthy use. Both types of craft were made in an area of the Indian Ocean which had ready access to timber. However, both the Ngalawa and the Mtepe have been discussed in the context of Indonesian origin. The Ngalawa , an outrigger craft, is still in use along sections of the East African littoral and arguments for its Indonesian origin seem well founded.34 The Mtepe , on the other hand, has several postulated areas of origin. THE EVOLUTION OF THE MTEPE The Mtepe craft proves of interest in the East African context because an argument for its local evolution would further emphasize the 'gene' pool diversity from which Indian Ocean shipbuilding traditions have evolved. The three main problem areas of the Mtepe for maritime historians, apart from its sewn hull construction, include its camel's head prow, its square sail, and its almost upright mast. The first point in regard to the Mtepe concerns the camel's head prow. Previous articles on the Mtepe have elaborated the idea that the prow of the Mtepe was a repre- sentation of the Prophet Muhammed's favourite camel.35 This interpretation of the origin of the Mtepe' s prow raises several questions. Mookerji has pointed out the injunctions of the Koran against sea -faring. 36 Although injunctions against sea -travel appear to have been watered down as the Islamicized Arabs spread their empire by sea, it remains more likely that the camel's neck derived from a pagan pre-Islamic tradition. These pre-Islamic traditions involved the sacrifice of a prize animal prior to the launching of a ship. Later this sacrifice might have been translated in the form of an anthropomorphic bow designed to bring good fortune to the ship. Such anthropo- morphic bows can be seen depicted in the Tassili frescoes and among drawings col- lected by Winkler in Egypt's Eastern Desert.37 38 Anthropomorphic custom was later reflected in the Minoan ships of the Mediterranean and the Viking long-boats of the Atlantic. Thus, ship prow anthropomorphism was a well established tradition well before the Mtepe got its camel head prow. In view of such information, the infor- mant's statement in regard to the camel head origins of the Mtepe prow might be re- interpreted as a somewhat ethnocentric rationalization for the continuance of a pagan custom in an Islamic region. Therefore, it would appear that the camel's head prow of the Mtepe , if anything, is an indicator of the ship's pre-Islamic ancestry. The camel's head may also have had a functional use akin to the uplifted bows of the Egyptian reed ship bundles. These raised bows added structural strength to the hull and proved useful when the ship needed docking on a river bank prior to the unloading of cargo.39 The conservatism of shipbuilders and sailors has already been documented and therefore it would not be surprising to see a reed prototype of the Mtepe bow retained in its wooden version. Similarly, it may be purely incidental that the Mtepe's mast pitched in a near upright position and not at an angle as required by Arab craft rigged for the lateen sail. The Egyptians are known to have had the use of the sail from the third millenium B.C.40 Subsequently, the upright bi-pod mast came into use on the Egyptian reed ships of the Nile.41 By 1500 B.C. Hatshepsut's ships were made of wood but retained the upright single mast and square sail. The boom on the bottom edge of the sail allowed the rapid furling and unfurling of sail amid the treacherous wind conditions of the Red Sea.42 However, like the Mtepe , the Egyptian ships did not utilize the lateen rig which proved ideal for the manipulation of monsoon winds by Arab sailors.43 This point would appear to indicate that the Egyptian sailors and those sailing the Mtepe 5</page><page sequence="6">SENT ANCE MIE PE CREAR VIEW TO EMPHASIZE RIGGING CONFIGURATION) Source: Line drawing made from pictures of a model Mtepe. located at Petley's Inn, Lamu, Kenya. 6</page><page sequence="7">THE MTEPE did not achieve monsoonal sailing capability on a regular basis. But similarities of sail configuration do not spell the whole story. The Egyptians in using the upright sail on their keel -less but mortised and dowelled hulls, required the additional strength pro- vided by a hog- and -truss. There was no need for the M tepe to have a hog- and -truss because the Mtepe hull had the additional strength of a keel. This keel, although rudimentary, was indicative of the dug-out tradition from which the Mtepe appears to have sprung. Thus, although the camel's head prow of the Mtepe might conceivably hark back to the era of reed-craft pre-eminence on the Indian Ocean, the use of the keel on the Mtepe would appear to indicate the use of more modern marine technology. In view of its incomplete archaeological picture, it is difficult to assess whether the use of the keel was stimulated through interaction with other ethnic groups along the East African coast.44 Despite these reservations, there are sound historical reasons why the Mtepe may have evolved when it did. Datoo has pointed to changed trade patterns along the East African coast during the thirteenth century.45 It would appear that island and estuarine locations were favoured among the Swahili peoples of the coast in this period.46 The Lamu archi- pelago area of the north Kenya coast offered both estuarine and island townsites. Townsites date back to the tenth century A.D. in this area, as has been shown on the island of Mande.47 By the twelfth century A.D. both Ungwana and Kilepwe had evolved as townsites associated with an estuarine location. The occupations of town inhabitants included: wood-cutting, shipbuilding, animal -husbandry, and trade.48 By the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries A.D. trade was extensive.49 This period of Swahili trade and cultural efflorescence continued until after the arrival of the Portu- guese. During the sixteenth century the Portuguese attempted to distort Swahili trade patterns in their favour, while in addition both the Galla from the north and the Zimbe cannibals from the south threatened different Swahili townships.50 By the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries, according to Wilson, mainland Swahili coastal towns were abandoned for islands and it was on those islands that the Swahili culture survived most effectively.51 During these periods of unrest along the northern East African coast the Mtepe would have proved to be the ideal craft for the transfer of large quantities of cargo and people. Not dependent on the imported wood and canvas fabric of India used in the manufacture of the Arab dhow, the Mtepe could be built from readily available materials. These materials included: makuti , coir rope, and local hard woods. This dependence on local materials meant that innovations such as nails or iron pintle and gudgeons (the hinges by which an axial rudder hung from the blunt aft end of the hull) were introduced only much later. Thus the sewn hull of the Mtepe persisted along with its pointed aft which Hornell used to distinguish pre -Portuguese ships of the Indian Ocean from the squared-off afts of their European influenced counterparts.32 Ultimately, the Mtepe endured as a relic of ancient Indian Ocean ship technology into the twentieth century; a monument to Swahili inventiveness and the instrument of their continued survival as a culture. Thus, despite Al Indrisi's twelfth century admonition that the people of Zanj (the East African coast); ... do not have suitable ships to voyage in, but use the vessels from Oman and other coun- tries,53 by the thirteenth century the Mtepe appears to have becomç an integral part of Swahili culture. Moreover, the Mtepe persisted into the twentieth century despite the competition alluded to by Al Indrisi in the form of the trans -oceanic sailing Arab lateen craft or dhow. The Mtepe' s longevity as a sailing craft is best explained in the 7</page><page sequence="8">SENT ANCE context of local carrying needs. Square-rigged craft complete with lower boom have also been reported by Greenhill in the estuarine areas of the Indus.54 These Indian craft were reported in the 1970s and were identified as being built from the dug-out like the Mtepe. Moreover, the Indian craft were used for riverine and estuary trade in areas where wind conditions proved predictable. Obviously, the square sail is not as effective as the lateen in trans -oceanic monsoon sailing, but the square sail appears to have proved adequate both along the East African coast and in the Indus and Ganges estuarine areas of N.W. and N.E. India. Ultimately, the Jihazi filled the role of the Mtepe ; a lateen-rigged craft requiring a crew of only two and less upkeep. Total dependence on local materials could be re- duced with the onset of settled conditions along the East African coast subsequent to the imposition of colonial rule. The pointed aft of the Mtepe with its cumbersome long rudder, gave way to the flattened aft of the Jihazi** This flattened aft with pintle and gudgeon hung rudder was part of a nailed hull configuration which proved congenial to motorization. Unlike the Mtepe' s sewn hull which had to be 're-sewn' at least once every two years the nailed hull Jihazi was less susceptible to shaking apart by motor vibration. In conclusion, it might be conjectured that the Mtepe evolved in response to local conditions along the East African coast, sometime during the twelth or thirteenth cen- turies. The tradition of maritime technology which it drew on in the course of its evolution was ancient and largely indigenous. As such, it may have had an important influence on the siting of some Swahili towns. But despite its remarkable longevity, within the overall context of Indian Ocean trade the Mtepe never assumed more than a position of local significance, its impact remaining limited to its area of origin.
