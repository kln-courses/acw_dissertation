<plain_text><page sequence="1">Response to Parkes Claudia Crawford Dear Graham: I enjoyed reading your comments in response to my evaluation of your book very much. As you know, this question of Nietzsche's idea of the human soul has gripped us tightly. From the beginning of our discussions we have felt that we essentially agree on some things, but not on others and yet it has been, at least for me, difficult to get ahold of the differences at the more subtle levels. I really have to stay with body as Nietzsche's primary locus of soul. The evidence for doing so is too overwhelming in his work as a whole. Yet I know that Nietzsche has mystical strains in his thinking: Dionysian ecstasies, nature mysticism, etc. I think Nietzsche probably had one or more significant mystical experiences (i.e., the experience of eternal recurrence). So my staying with the body in an attempt to define his concept of soul may be rewarded by following the thread of a conjunction between body and mystical knowledge. By mystical knowledge I mean direct (bodily) experience of what is and one's unity with what is. First it is important to repeat the definition of transcendence you offer: "corresponding to the understanding of human soul as extending beyond the physical body would be the idea [following Plato in the Timaeus] of the cosmic soul's 'enveloping' the. physical universe." Human beings, being a part of the physical universe and having been given a soul made of the same stuff as the cosmic soul are also enveloped in the cosmic soul. In this sense the cosmic soul "houses" the entire universe (water, rocks, trees, animals, etc.) as well as the human soul. Thus, it is the stuff of the cosmic soul that acts as a medium of spatial and temporal transcendence. This made your idea of soul much clearer to me. You give examples from Nietzsche of how you think the human soul transcends its physical body through spatial travel: the dionysian ecstatic "being-outside-oneself," the collapse of the principium individuationis from The Birth of Tragedy and the resultant identification with the human race as a whole, and with nature. I do not see how these (psychological) experiences constitute being literally out of the body. It is consciousness, the having of an organism capable of consciousness, sensation, experience, etc. that allows these notions and namings of spatially transcending the body. 99</page><page sequence="2">I have to give the same response to your examples of how the soul transcends the physical body when it travels in time. Your examples are: "wandering through distant historical eras," which you yourself recognize is possible only through being embodied, but you go on to claim that "the past flows on within us in a hundred waves" and "our experience is carried far beyond the spatio-temporal confines of the physical frame." Waves of consciousness and experience, yes. Beyond spatio-temporal confines of the physical frame? How? Nietzsche's and everyone else's excursions in archaic fantasy and flights of historical imagination, even when thought of as an evasion of being here now, can only happen in the present embodied consciousness. Let's look for a moment at the discussion of dreams and archaic inheritance in Chapter 9 of your book. When Nietzsche writes that in the dream a "primordial piece of humanity continues to operate in us," (p. 329) he does not mean that we or a piece of our psyche are once again hunters and gatherers, or should imagine ourselves so in order to add a dimension to our psyche, but that the mechanism of "dream perception is an archaic mode of perception and understanding that we have largely replaced with reason." Nietzsche can say "the dream is a form of recreation for the brain," (rather than its major operation), because dream perception and understanding is more atrophied in modern than in ancient peoples, (p. 329) Consciousness of historical and archaic memories, whether in waking or dreaming consciousness, does not carry us beyond our present bodies in any metaphysical way, but constitutes a function of our changing bodies. If we talk, however, of biological experience of past eras and histories which culminate in the body, that is another thing. Nietzsche's belief, as you amply document, that inherited traits, dispositions, strengths, weaknesses, etc., accumulated over evolutionary generations and the legacy of evolutionary possibility which we could leave for future generations constituted a stream of life transcending any given individual body. Any given individual has only one body but there is a genetic, organic and changing continuity between bodies that stretches back into archaic history (that also means body's operations: consciousness, spirit, cultural valuing, etc.) Again, it is not the content or image of the dream, fantasy, etc. that is literally archaic and thus transports us beyond the spatio temporal confines of our physical frame (all images learned from our enormously complex and multiplicitous life experiences, are of present consciousness) but it is the archaic physiological processes themselves which we confront, instinctual body and thinking which prompts the dream images and metaphors of waking life. In your book you write: 100</page><page sequence="3">Nietzsche's belief in the inheritance of acquired characteristics stems from a salutary refusal to separate soul from body, or spirit from matter; but the important thing is to take remarks about things being "in the blood" in the experimental spirit in which they were meant. The point of Nietzsche's announcement of his discovery that "ancient humanity and animality" continue to operate through him in the present is to invite the reader to understand his or her present experience in this way?to behave and reflect as //every moment of experience were being informed by archaic forces, (p. 331-32) I argue that for Nietzsche it is "in the blood," in the bodily mechanisms (instincts, genetic determinations, etc.) that archaic and other inherited characteristics work. One need not resort to the as if. Therefore, Graham, your examples do not convince me that any temporal transcendence of physical body takes place either as altered states of consciousness or as archaic flights of imagination. You say my view of Nietzsche's soul is too anthropomorphic, you find my assertions that the soul is "strictly human" and "organic growth" as too limiting. "Anthropomorphic" has become a sort of dirty word in our contemporary period; for Nietzsche I'm not so sure this was true. Although Nietzsche's images and awareness of all aspects of the inorganic, vegetal, animal and human worlds was vast, as your book is groundbreaking in bringing to our attention, it is definitely true that he was focused on humans and what would and should become of humans. His sensitivity to and praise of inorganic, vegetal, animal worlds functioned in part as mirrors and enhancements of human awareness of the multiplicity of life. However it may be with Nietzsche, I am not using "human consciousness" in a narrow sense. Human consciousness, and each consciousness is individual, unique, is able to assume states (dreaming, sleep, waking consciousness, ecstasy, love, etc.) which allow experiences of co-feeling and intuitive oneness, with trees, animals, rocks, the cosmos, etc. To experience the transcendence of the principium individuationis is still an experience of consciousness, true, an altered state of consciousness, but still proceeding from human psychological awareness arising from body. The ecstatic feeling of oneness with the universe is just that ?one of the psychological heights (and that it is a height is our cultural judgment) to which human consciousness can attain, a height which we can even say is divine (again, our word, our definition). Graham, before I continue, it is important to stress that I am not equating consciousness with mechanical and material synaptic responses in the brain in any simplistic or reductionist way. It is entirely possible that consciousness also includes elements and possibilities more mysterious than mere reduction to biological concretism. For example, the whole Eastern idea that the locus of the body is in the energy and power 101</page><page sequence="4">of the breath. Yet for human awareness breath needs a body. For Nietzsche healthy organic growth means not just the sternum, the developing health of the body, but also of body's consciousness, mind, and spirit. The spirit or soul, as parts of consciousness, grow and experience organically, just as does the animal and plant. In "Despisers of the Body," a key section for our discussion as we have agreed, Nietzsche writes: "What the sense feels, what the spirit knows, never has its end in itself. But sense and spirit would persuade you that they are the end of all things:...behind them still lies the self. The self is a mighty ruler, an unknown sage...he is your body." (p. 146) Let's look at a passage in Nietzsche's notes (Nov.l887-March 88) which takes up this theme and makes it quite clear. The animal functions are, as a matter of principle, a million times more important than all our beautiful moods and heights of consciousness: the latter are a surplus, except when they have to serve as tools of those animal functions. The entire conscious life, the spirit along with the soul, the heart, goodness, and virtue in whose service do they labor? In the service of the greatest possible perfection of the means (means of nourishment, means of enhancement) of the basic animal functions: above all, the enhancement of life. What one used to call "body" and "flesh" is of such unspeakably greater importance: the remainder is a small accessory. The task of spinning on the chain of life, and in such a way that the thread grows ever more powerful-that is the task. But consider how heart, soul, virtue, spirit practically conspire together to subvert this systematic task-as if they were the end in view! Now here we could say the human body (animal functions, consciousness, soul, etc.) is enveloped not by a metaphysical and transcendent cosmic soul, but by a biological and evolutionary process seeking more strength and enhancement for life. So, in order of hierarchy, Nietzsche has at the bottom and ascending in envelopes or circles of power: 1) ego, spirit, soul, virtue, etc. (all accessories, all contributing factors in the biological means of life-they too are biological); 2) consciousness; 3) body as Self; Self as will to more power; 4) in service of life's will to more power. Ego, spirit, soul, virtue, all developments of consciousness, but nevertheless a "little surface" and surplus of the (animal) body, which is what is important. You warned me in your comments not to be too centered in the vegetal image of the tree to the exclusion of animals, etc. I respond by suggesting that in discussing the human we never leave the animal realm. Nietzsche's hierarchy is a clear reversal of Plato's hierarchy of soul and body. 102</page><page sequence="5">In "On the Tarantulas" in Zarathustra Nietzsche writes: Life wants to build itself up into the heights with pillars and steps; it wants to look into vast distances and out toward stirring beauties: therefore it requires height. And because it requires height, it requires steps and contradiction among the steps and the climbers. Life wants to climb and to overcome itself climbing, (p. 213) And in The Will to Power Nietzsche draws this out in more detail Put briefly: perhaps the entire evolution of the spirit is a question of the body; it is the history of the development of a higher body that emerges into our sensibility. The organic is rising to yet higher levels. Our lust for knowledge of nature is a means through which the body desires to perfect itself. Or rather: hundreds of thousands of experiments are made to change the nourishment, the mode of living and of dwelling of the body; consciousness and evaluations in the body, all kinds of pleasure and displeasure, are signs of these changes and experiments. In the long run, it is not a question of man at all: he is to be overcome. (WP 676) Now, if it is true that by far the most of our lives and development is unconscious biological activity, and we as humans have consciousness, a drive for knowledge, spirit, virtue, soul, but these are only accessory and surface manifestations, then shouldn't we just give up? No, Nietzsche directs us to get to know the body?pay attention to and maximize diet, exercise, climate, work with specific instincts (all detailed in Ecce Homo, "Why I Am So Clever")--in order to make the most of consciousness, do our best at willing and creating ourselves, in other words, work at our highest capacity to create power and overcome ourselves along with the movements of will to power in nature. Graham, you object to my "emphasis on restricted economies of life in contradistinction to the general economy of nature". You say "it belies an anthropocentrism or a biocentrism that is alien to Nietzsche's philosophical project." Can you still assert this in light of the above? You take exception with the idea of autarky, "that the individual life or human organism has to make a place for itself, be conscious of its experimentations on its own authority." If one does not distinguish oneself over and against the stream of nature, then how does one will and create oneself, add one's quantum of power as a particular form of life to nature? This is why I, and Nietzsche, say the human cannot take the unrestricted economy of nature as its model (See BGE #9) You go on to say that nature was a great model for Nietzsche: he wants us to be "renaturalised," "translated 103</page><page sequence="6">back into nature;" you suggest that Nietzsche wants us to squander ourselves and discipline ourselves and "throw our concerns for restricted economy to the winds in order to overflow exultantly into the general economy, throwing ourselves into the 'total household* as Nietzsche often puts it." Yes, but not in an idealistic and nominally mystical sense, not trusting to a metaphysical "beloved fate," or cosmic soul but in being willing to live dangerously, ascetically discipline and experiment with our very bodies, risk madness or death if necessary, go under. These thoughts lead nicely into your discussion of the inanimate, the dead, the inorganic. In my initial responses to your book I defined Nietzsche's soul as a healthy organic growth and I have continued to defend this position, but I agree with you completely that growth presupposes deaths, that organic needs the anorganic. Life tells Zarathustra: "I am that which must always overcome itself. Rather would I perish than forswear this: and verily, where there is perishing and a falling of leaves, behold, there life sacrifices itself-for power." p. 227 Because the general economy of nature includes death as a necessary movement, the restricted economy of life in the form of individual consciousness of life should too. I say should, for Nietzsche urges us to not only accept but celebrate all forms of death, including the death of the body, as you point out. Zarathustra says: "Verily through a hundred souls I have already passed on my way, and through a hundred cradles and birth pangs. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heartrending last hours. But thus my creative will, my destiny, wills it. Or, to say it more honestly: this very destiny-my will wills." Here it is Zarathustra's Self/body as will to power which provides the necessity of his conscious will. p. 199 "Willing no more and esteeming no more and creating no more?oh, that this great weariness might always remain far from me!" The general economy of nature "envelops" or "houses" life and continually wills and creates and overcomes itself in these activities toward more power and thus, too, must one's "mortal" souls conduct themselves as means to life's power. Again, it is precisely because we are caught up in this continual changing movement of organic and inorganic deaths and lives and concomitantly of changing "mortal" souls, that Plato's permanent, transcendent and immortal cosmic soul seems to present an opposite pole from Nietzsche. I also agree that organisms are conditioned completely by inorganic nature: water, air, earth, electricity, etc. These are conditions of our growth just as they are for plants, and thus, they function heavily in our symbolism and imaginations, but do we transcend our bodies in feeling as one with them? Now, Graham, as I said in opening, I think that we both to some extent find my 104</page><page sequence="7">characterization of Nietzsche in these comments, perhaps, too biocentric and there is no doubt that Nietzsche himself had some souls that wanted to and I think experienced mystical states of mind. His Dionysian ecstasies, his mystical experience of the eternal recurrence, his bird flights and profound and mystical solitudes and silences. But these would all be experiments and souls of consciousness brought on by body's biological and evolutionary needs, drives, etc. (SEE BGE #6) Not to be valued the less, but according to Nietzsche, the more! To draw another parallel to your Platonic reading of soul in Nietzsche, let me offer an addendum from Eastern ideas to the images I've already offered in our discussion: on one hand, Plato's man/plant whose thoughts are attached to heaven like roots from his head with body hanging lisdessly below and, on the other hand, Nietzsche's image of the tree which grows richly upward from the earth. I would like to place a human being, a yogi sitting in the lotus flower position beneath its branches, focusing awareness on and within the body (shades of "At Noon" where Zarathustra sits under the entwined tree and vine and has a mystical experience, where what is happening to his body causes him to discourse with his soul). Yoga postures, right diet, physical health and suppleness, attention to breath, the "little things" extolled in Ecce Homo, all bodily prerequisites for true awareness, not of "I" or ego, or soul, but as Nietzsche writes in "On the Despisers of the Body," of the Self/body which directs ego and soul. Meditation: conscious awareness by looking into body as organism and its mind (psychology). Letting wordless body inform consciousness. "Your body and its great reason does not say 'V but does "I." p 146 Looking at dreams, fantasies, repressed problems, reviewing the vast contents of conscious and unconscious past, dreamlives, etc. Growing awareness of Self/body and its accessories, growing awareness of oneness with the multiplicity and impermanence of all (for Nietzsche, all of life's movements in the will to power of nature), at the height of experiencing oneness of Self as all (will to power). One of Nietzsche's most beautiful passages: Man is not the effect of some special purpose, of a will, and end; nor is he the object of an attempt to attain an "ideal of humanity" or an "ideal of happiness" or an "ideal morality." It is absurd to wish to devolve one's essence on some end or other. We have invented the concept of "end": in reality there is no end. One is necessary, one is a piece of fatefulness, one belongs to the whole, one is in the whole; there is nothing which could judge, measure, compare, or sentence our being, for that would mean judging, measuring, comparing, or sentencing the whole. But there is nothing besides the whole. That nobody is held responsible any longer, that the mode of being may not be traced back to a causa prima, that 105</page><page sequence="8">the world does not form a unity either as a sensorium or as "spirit"- that alone is the great liberation; with this alone is the innocence of becoming restored. (TI 500-501) Again: do you want a name for this world? A solution for all its riddles? A flight for you, too, you best-concealed, strongest, most intrepid, most midnightly men?-this world is the will to power and nothing besides! And you yourselves are also this will to power-and nothing besides! (WP 1067) Yogic power (ascetic discipline of the multiplicity we are) to play with the all, to manifest things, to bring death to life, to compel the stars to revolve around one, to create, because one's Self has realized its power and nature as all possibility and creation. The direct conscious (bodily) experience and creation of the all (will to power) within and with the body, not a mere theoretical and metaphysical speculation of heavens and other worlds. The yogic model of internal body and mind awareness of the Self/all reflects Nietzsche's position and multiple psyche pretty accurately. In the yogic mode the consciousness of the individual Self is the all as the all is the individual Self. Strictly speaking, one does not "house" or "envelop" the other. There is only the whole. Just as the body and its accessories in the life of the individual is nature (will to power) and nature is each body (will to power). There is only will to power. Nietzsche's realization of the unity of will to power in the restricted economy of life and of will to power in the unrestricted economy of nature brings him to realize the union of these movements. If will to power in the unrestricted economy wills to will and overcome, then restricted economy should and must-in fact it already is happening so-will to will and overcome, therein "becoming what it is." This mystical experience of wholeness is not realizable using only "little" reason, but by getting to know the body-"great reason." Remember Zarathustra spends ten years in a cave "enjoying his spirit and his solitude," and the saint in the forest calls him "an awakened one:" What does he teach of bodies and souls? Thus, the body goes through history, becoming and fighting. And the spirit [here, we can just as well say soul]-what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, companion and echo. Watch for every hour, my brothers, in which your spirit wants to speak in parables: there lies the origin of your virtue. There your body is elevated and resurrected; with its rapture it delights the spirit so that it turns creator and esteemer and lover and benefactor of all things. (187) 106</page><page sequence="9">The creative body created the spirit as a hand for its will. (147) With knowledge, the body purifies itself; making experiments with knowledge, it elevates itself; in the lover of knowledge all instincts become holy; in the elevated [body], the soul becomes gay. (189) Although I think the yogic model works well in this context you will recognize, as a commentator on Nietzsche's relationship to Asian thought, that Nietzsche's model contains some similarities but also at least one major differences from the general yoga tradition. Similarity: Though concern with the body is central to yoga, the body is nevertheless a tool of consciousness which is permanent and transcends bodies. For Nietzsche body is a tool of will to power. Here at the unitive level body succumbs to the movements of what is. Another similarity: what at first appears different, that Nietzsche does not see will to power as permanent, unchanging, immortal, while Brahma/Self is so for yoga is actually belied by Nietzsche at a deeper level when he writes: A certain emperor always bore in mind the transitoriness of all things so as not to take them too seriously and to live at peace among them. To me, on the contrary, everything seems far too valuable to be so fleeting: I seek an eternity for everything: ought one to pour the most precious salves and wines into the sea?~ My consolation is that everything that has been is eternal: the sea will cast it up again. (WP 1065) We find here that, for Nietzsche, though things change they are also eternal. A third similarity: there is the question of what happens to us when the body dies. As we already said for Nietzsche the soul is dead even before the body. Yet again, at the level of will to power and the eternal recurrence body and its accessory soul does not permanentiy end: the will to power is "force throughout, a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many...with great years of recurrence." (WP 1067) And because all things are eternal and recur through this play of forces, our bodies, we, will be thrown up again and again, even if only at large intervals calculated by human time. However, from the timeless state of will to power and the eternal circulation of force we recur outside of any recognizable time frame. Here, Nietzsche sounds positively yogic: 107</page><page sequence="10">You think you have a long rest until rebirth?but do not fool yourselves! Between the last moment of consciousness and the first appearance of new life lies "no time"?it passes by like a stroke of lightning, even if creatures measure it i terms of billions of years or could not measure it at all. Timelessness and succession are compatible as soon as the intellect is gone." (KSA 11 [318]) The body/Self is so much a ground of soul for Nietzsche that he needed to posit its eternal recurrence. So a major difference from yoga philosophy is that whereas enlightened consciousness drops the body as no longer needed, Nietzsche considers body as always needed to form consciousness and soul. Maybe in light of all of this, Graham, we come to a place where we can meet from our different perspectives and where I think we can reach agreement. Nietzsche: "The two most extreme modes of thought-the mechanistic and the Platonic-are reconciled in the eternal recurrence: both as ideals." (WP1061) Plato leaves out mechanism in favor of idealism. Nietzsche insists on mechanism, the physics of energy acting on and within bodies including, for our discussion, organic bodies and what they are capable of. Yet here, in his idea of eternal recurrence we have a confirmation of his admiration for Plato's idealism, though, I think, filtered through Eastern perspectives. I want to thank you, Graham, for a wonderfully enriching book and discussions. There is really nothing in the above that you are not aware of and which does not, in some sense, find a place in your book and ideas. Our differences have been a matter of different emphases upon certain strains of Nietzsche's vastly multiplicitous and fascinating psychology. Perhaps our differences arise not so much from our "ideas" of soul, but constitute the confessions of our momentary yet eternally recurring complicated and largely unconscious drives and forces. 108</page></plain_text>
