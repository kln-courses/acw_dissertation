I propose in this paper to consider the claims of Cingalese Buddhism. What these claims are had better be stated at starting, from the writings of Dr. llhys Davids, the most prominent advocate of these claims. We are, I think, in debted to him for priceless translations: but a linguist is not always infallible as a reasoner. Professor Beal has given us still more valuable linguistic contributions; and he has taken Dr. Rhys Davids to task. He says that the allegations that Buddha preached "atheism, annihilation, and thc non existence of the soul," are "more easily made than proved."1 This sentence gives us Dr. Rhys Davids's main position. He holds that Buddha preached pure atheism;2 that he taught, also, "in a complete and categorical manner," that man has " no soul, nor anything of any kind that continues in any manner after death; "3 that this Buddhism is the only Buddhism known in the ancient sacred books of Ceylon ?practically, the only reliable authorities on the subject.1 In the north, not earlier than the tenth century a.d., a theistic school arose who worshipped Adi Buddha.5 I shall begin by considering the first two propositions, because it stands to reason that if I can show, from tbe Cingalese scriptures themselves, that Buddha believed in a God and the soul's immortality, the pretensions put forward 1 Romantic History, Introd. p. x. 2 Buddhism, p. 207. 3 Ibid. p. 99. 4 Letter to the Spectator, Feb. 25, 1882. 6 An obstaclo in thc way of this date is a colossal statuo in Western India, erected to Adi Buddhanuth. This must plainly have been erected before the Brahmin persecution had expelled thc Buddhists from those parts. Also, very colossal statues arc not erected to new gods, but gods loug established. Sec Tod's Travels in Western India, p. 276.</page><page sequence="3">420 TnE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. iii favour of the authority of the Cingalese books are on my side of the argument. Buddha, as is well known, was a young prince born in Kapi lavastu, a small Aryan kingdom in North Oude. His father, King Suddhodana, wanted to resign in his favour; but the young man, cloyed with the idle life of the zenana, deter mined to become a religious reformer. I will hero cite a passage from the Lalita Vistara, which gives us the prince's own version of the matter when he was visited by King Bimbis&amp;ra:? "I have given up a powerful kingdom, putting aside earthly ambitions. To obtain calm I have become a Yogi. In the spring-tide of youth, when vigour and grace and beauty are its portion, I desired troops of women and much wealth. And in the middle of my kingdom I gratified my appetites."l Buddha here calls himself a Yogi. What was a Yogi P The answer to this must be clearly understood, as it is the kernel of the question before us. Swedenborg said that the secret of the Christian religion lay in the word " conjoining." The mystic logos conjoined heaven and earth. A similar idea was the key-note of the old Indian religions. There was a realm of matter and material life. There was a realm of pure spirit. Earth, or what we call matter, was personified as Aditi, the mighty mother. Spirit was personified by Brahma the Ineffable. This latter, in Buddhism, became the transcendental Buddha, the "form of all things yet formless,"2 the "omnipresent chief of the Munis," the vajra fttma, the "eternal (literally diamond) being."8 Aditi became Dharma or Prajii&amp;, the universal mother. The " external and internal diversities belonging to all animate nature are produced by her." 4 I must mention, however, that this Buddhist terminology was borrowed from Brahminism. Tho intelligence of the Kosmos was called Buddhi in the S&amp;nkhya philosophy.5 1 Lalita Vistara, Foucaux's Translation, p. 230. a Hodgson's Essays, p. 84. 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 6 Colebrooke's Essays, vol. i. p. 242.</page><page sequence="4">THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. 421 And the greatost of Indian epics, the Mahabharata, is nothing more than an account of an incarnation of Dharma on earth, in the form of the hero, Yudhishtliira. Yoga means " con joining," and so does the word SaiTigha of the Buddhists. The Yogi, when he had mastered his lower life, conjoined the realms of Aditt and the realms of Brahma. He was one with Brahma. As Yajnyavalkya puts it, he effected the " union of the living with tho supreme soul." It is necessary now to say a few words on the way in which this union with Brahma was supposed to be attain able. From the date of the Rig-Veda, the recluse retired to a forest to perform tapas. In every chapter of the Mahabharata these hermits swarm. Many treatises tell us how this Yoga is to be practised. The Yogi is to sit cross-legged, with his back perfectly erect. He must try and stop his breathing altogether. By and by visions are supposed to come to him, and the secrets of the invisible spheres. A curious feature, perfectly unintelligible to modern thought, is the mode in which the god idea changes in his mind during the process. At first the anthropomorphic god peoples his dreams. Then he broods on the symbols alone, the chakra, the gada, the saukha, etc. And by and by the abstract idea can be grasped. He becomes one with Brahma. A pregnant question here arises: How did Buddha view all this P The answer of Dr. Rhys Davids is unhesitating. He swept it clean away, God idea, soul idea, the after life. In the most ancient Buddhism, that of Ceylon, the dhyana, the iddhis, were "relegated to the region of legend and fairy tale."1 It "despised dreams and visions."2 Sweep ing negation was Buddha's "answer to the mystics." In short he was Comte the Positivist, born two thousand four hundred years before his time. Buddhism, instead of starting with a cargo of Brahminism and throwing much of it overboard during the vojyage, set sail in an empty ship, and all Brahmin accretions have been taken on board since. 1 Buddhist Suttas, p. 208. 2 Buddhism, p. 177. vol. xv.?[new series.] 28</page><page sequence="5">422 THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. A priori, there aro difficulties in the way of this view. Here is a statue of Buddha.1 In every Buddhist temple there are hundreds like this. Each is sitting in the attitude prescribed by the Brahmins for practising Yoga. All?even the rudest?manage to give the calm dreaminess of Yoga nidrfl. Every Buddhist idol is seeking dhyftna. And every Buddhist ISraraana has given up father, mother, wealth, and worldly joys; aud he mumbles his mantras, a hundred thousand a day,2 to gain the very dhy&amp;na that his prophet sought to "relegate to the region of fairy tale." And I must say that when I read the Doctor's translations I am very much puzzled. The ideal northern Buddhist, in his view, is a man of many superstitions?a miracle-monger. The ideal southern Buddhist is what we should call a scientific freethinker. Tho Northerns have six Iddhis, or magical powers, which they believe to be acquired by the recluse when the divine vision is attained. I will copy them down from the Lotus of Dharma:? 1. The ascetic must be able to rise into the air. 2. He must rain down fire from his body. 3. He must rain down floods of water from his body. 4. He must make his body expand indefinitely, and then grow infinitely little. 5. He must make it disappear and return to earth. 6. He must rise again into the sky. But, when I turn to the literature of the Southerners, I find six iddhis likewise :? 1. The ascetic, being one, must become multiform. 2. He must become invisible. 3. He must pass through walls, mountains, solid ground, as if through water. 4. He must be able to walk on the water without dividing it. 5. He must be able to travel cross-legged through the sky. 6. He must be able even to reach the world of Brahma. 1 A statue of Buddha was exhibited when this paper was read before tho Royal Asiatic Society. 2 Schlagintweit, Buddhism in Tibet, p. 54.</page><page sequence="6">THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. 423 Really, the only difference between the freethinkers of the south and the miracle-mongers of the north that I can see, is that the Southerners fly through the air " cross-legged," and the Northerners without crossing their legs. I must mention that these iddhis are given to us by Dr. Rhys Davids in a Sutra written, in his view, as early as the fourth century b.c.1 They are detailed to us by tho freethinker Buddha himself. Some will perhaps say: "Could we only conjure up Buddha himself for five minutes, and cross-examine him about union with Brahma! " Those who say this will be surprised to hear that we can practically cross-examine Buddha on this point. They will be still more surprised to hear that it is through the literary activity of Dr. Rhys Davids in giving us the Tevigga Sutta2 that this is possible. And most sur prising is the fact that this Sutra scatters to the four winds all notions that Buddha denied an intelligent, eternal God. When the great Tathagata was dwelling at Manasakata in the mango grove, some Brahmins learned in thc Three Vedas came to consult him on this very question of Union with the eternal Brahma. They asked if they were on the right pathway towards that Union. Buddha replies at great length. He suggests an ideal case. He supposes that a man has fallen in love with the "most beautiful woman in the land." Day and night he dreams of her, but he has never seen her. He does not know whether she is tall or short, of Brahmin or Sftdra caste, of dark or fair complexion. He does not know even her name. The Brahmins are asked if the talk of that man about that woman be wise or foolish. They confess that it is " foolish talk." Buddha then applies the same train of reasoning to them. The Brahmins versed in the three Vedas are made to confess that they have never seen Brahma, that they do not know whether he is tall or short or anything about him, and that all their talk about Union with him is also foolish talk. 1 Buddhist Suttas, p. 214 ; also Preface, p. x. 2 Buddhist Suttas, p. 167.</page><page sequence="7">424 THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. They are mounting a crooked staircase, and do not know whether it leads to a mansion or a precipice. They are standing on the bank of a river and calling to the other bank to come to them. Now it seems to me that if Buddha was the uncompro mising teacher of Atheism that Dr. Rhys Davids pictures him, he has at this point an admirable opportunity of urging his views. The Brahmins he would of course contend know nothing about Brahma, for the simple reason that no such being as Brahma exists. But this is exactly the line that Buddha does not take. His argument is that tho Brahmins know nothing of Brahma because Brahma is purely spiritual and they are purely materialistic. Five "Veils" he shows hide Brahma from mortal ken. These are: 1. The Veil of Lustful Desire. 2. The Veil of Malice. 3. The Veil of Sloth and Idleness. 4. The Veil of Pride and Self-righteousness. 5. The Veil of Doubt. Buddha then goes on with his questionings: " Is Brahma in possession of wives and wealth P " " He is not, Gautama ! " answers Vftsittha the Brahmin. " Is his mind full of anger or free from anger P " " Free from anger, Gautama ! " " Is his mind full of malice or free from malice P " " Free from malice, Gautama! " " Is his mind depraved or pure P " " It is pure, Gautama ! " " Has he self-mastery or has he not ? " "He has, Gautama!" The Brahmins are then questioned about themselves : "Are the Brahmins versed in the three Vedas in the possession of wives and wealth or are they not P " " They are, Gautama! " " Have they anger in their hearts or have they not ? " "They have, Gautama! "</page><page sequence="8">THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. 425 " Do they bear malice or do they not ? " "They do, Gautama!" " Are they pure in heart or aro they not P " " They aro not, Gautama! " "Have they self-mastery or have they not P " " They have not, Gautama! " These replies provoke of course the very obvious retort that no point of union can be found between such dissimilar entities. Brahma is free from malice, sinless, self-contained, so of course it is only the sinless that can hope to be in harmony with him. Vasittha then puts this question: "It has been told me, Gautama, that theSramana Gautama knows the way to the stato of Union with Brahma P " "Brahma I know, Vasittha!" says Buddha in reply, "and the world of Brahma and the path leading to it! " The humbled Brahmins learned in the three Vedas then ask Buddha to "show them the way to a state of Union with Brahma." Buddha replies at considerable length, drawing a sharp contrast between the lower Brahminism and the higher Brahminism, the " householder" and the " houseless one." The householder Brahmins are gross, sensual, avaricious, insincere. They practise for lucre black magic, fortune telling, cozenage. They gain the ear of kings, breed wars, predict victories, sacrifice life, spoil the poor. As a foil to this he paints the recluse who has renounced all wrorldly things, and is pure, self-possessed, happy. To teach this " higher life " a Tathagata " from time to time is born into the world, blessed and worthy, abounding in wisdom, a guido to erring mortals." He sees tho universe face to face, the spirit worlds of Brahma and Mara the tempter. He makes his knowledge known to others. The houseless one in structed by him " lets his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of pity, sympathy, and equanimity; and so the second, and so the third, and so the fourth. And thus the whole wide world, above, below, around, and everywhere, does he continue to pervade with heart of pity, sympathy,</page><page sequence="9">426 THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. and equanimity, far-reaching, grown great, and beyond measure." l " Verily this, V&amp;sittha, is the way to a state of Union with Brahma." And he proceeds to announce that the Bhikshu or Buddhist Beggar, " who is free from anger, free from malice, pure in mind, master of hinself, will, after death, when the body is dissolved, become united with Brahma."8 The Brahmins at once see the full force of this teaching. It is as a conservative in their eyes that Buddha figures, and not an innovator. He takes the side of the ancient spiritual religion of the country against rapacious innovators. " Thou hast set up what was thrown down ! " they say to him. In the Burmese life he is described more than once as one who has set the overturned chalice once more upon its base. In the Br&amp;hmana dhammikasutta this very question of the archaic Brahmin religion is discussed at full length; and Buddha announces that his mission is to restore this Brahmana dhamma.3 I own I am a little puzzled at the attitude assumed by Dr. Rhys Davids in the presence of the Tevigga Sutta. The Sutra is one of the original Pali Suttas which Dr. Rhys Davids considers the paramount authorities on early Buddhism. One of two inferences seems inevitable. Either the pretensions claimed for these Sutras or the charge of atheism must be withdrawn. Dr. Rhys Davids will do neither. Oddly enough too, he confuses Brahma and Brahma. All through tho Sutra he talks of Union with Brahm&amp; ; which was what the Yogi never sought to obtain. And this 'is the more astonishing bocause in a foot-note he lets us see that the P&amp;li writer used the word Brahma.4 Almost the first lesson to the tyro in Indian mythology is that you are not to confuse Brahma and Brahmft. Brahmft is the anthropomorphic god with four heads, who rides on a goose. Brahnia- gets drunk and tries to seduce his daughter.5 Brahmd had one of his heads knocked off in a fight with 1 n. 201. ? p. 203. ?

Brahma, Siva and Vishnu are worshipped in the month of Magna, and then their earthen images are flung into the river. Brahma, on the other hand, is the formless, pure, pervading, eternal, passionless God. An extract from the Mundaka Upanishad of the Atharva Veda may here throw a light on Brahma and union with him. "He is great and incomprehensible by the senses, and consequently his nature is beyond human conception. He, though more subtle than vacuum itself, shines in various ways. From those who do not know him he is at a greater distance than the limits of space, and to those who acquire a knowledge of him he is near; and whilst residing in animate creatures [is perceived, although obscurely, by those who apply their thoughts to him. He is not perceptible by vision, nor is he describable by means of speech, neither can he be the object of any of the organs of sense, nor can he be con ceived by the help of austerities or religious rites; but a person whose mind is purified by tho light of true knowledge, through incessant contemplation perceives him the most pure God. Such is the invisible Supreme Being. He should be seen in the heart, wherein breath consisting of five species rests. The mind being perfectly freed from impurity, God, who spreads over the mind and all the senses, imparts a knowledge of himself to the heart."l Whether or no Dr. Rhys Davids is inspired by Comtist sympathies I cannot say. Certainly one great obstacle to viewing Buddha as Comte born two thousand years too soon is the doctrine of Karma. The Buddhists took over from the Brahmins the idea that a man's actions in one existence regulated his fate in subsequent births. My idea is that it was invented to quiet the minds of the lower castes, when contemplating the superior temporal and spiritual ad vantages claimed by the Brahmins. Certainly tho con tinued life of the individual during the new births was the key-note of the idea. A man could not get rid of the consequences of immorality, until, by a great effort of 1 Rammohun Roy, Translation of the Vedas, p. 36.</page><page sequence="11">428 THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. self-restraint, he had reached the bodhi or emancipa tion. Of this doctrine Dr. Rhys Davids gives a version which differs from any other that I have ever read. He affirms that the Buddhists teach that each individual is annihilated at death, but that the causation of his deeds is handed on to another distinct individual. Thus, if A leads a thoroughly wicked life, B will take up the remorse and moral deteriora tion that result from A's misdeeds. If B conquers his fate and reforms, C will be happy, because B neutralised the errors of A. I shall not dispute Dr. Rhys Davids's assertion that this is an "incomprehensible mystery"; but I must say that not one tittle of evidence is brought to support it. And this new presentment of the doctrine of Karma neces sitates a new presentment of tho Buddhist ideas about the Five Skandhas. Skandha means body, and these Skandhas are bodily aggregations, form, sensation, mental perception and so on. "Upon death," says Colebrooke, writing on these Skandhas, "ensues a departure to another world. That is followed by return to this world, and then the course of error (Avidyft) with its train of consequences recommences."1 These Skandhas, like Karma, are not dissolved until the ac quisition of the Bodhi. But Dr. Rhys Davids, citing Colebrooke, but neglecting to study him, has put forth a theory that at death, annihilation of the individual takes place. And in proof of this he cites a sutta which seems to me to overthrow his theory com pletely. Buddha tells his disciples that tanh&amp; (the mystic " thirst"), which binds men to existence, has been cutoff1 in his case, but his body still remains, and for a short time will be seen by men and devas and then utterly disappear. This proves exactly what I urge. Buddha had then attained the Bodhi. In the view of all Buddhists, both in the south and north, his individuality had visited earth, (and, I may add, refuted Dr. Rhys Davids) exactly five hundred and fifty times.2 Mr. Hodgson's Buddhist Amirta Nanda Bandya says 1 Essays, vol. i. p. 397. 8 Hodgson, p. 96; Bigandet, p. 331.</page><page sequence="12">THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. 429 distinctly that the individual merely changes body after body until his karma is ended by Bodhijnana. He says also that jiva, the soul, is immortal.1 And if this is pronounced northern Buddhism, Migottuwatte, in his famous controversy iu Ceylon, and the heads of viharas when questioned by the Dutch governor, said the same thing.2 Spcnce Hardy, in his chapter on the Buddhist ontology, though he talks about the Skandhas " breaking up" at death, shows clearly that this does not mean cessation of the individual's existence, for in a dialogue between Subha and Buddha, the latter is made to say : " A woman or a man takes life. The blood of that which they have slain is continually on thoir hands. They live by murder. They have no compassion on any living thing. Such persons, on the breakiug up of the elements (the five khandas), will be born in one of the hells, or if on account of the merit received in somo former birth they are born as men, it will be of some inferior caste."3 Hero is another of his citations, drawn from the history of Anguli Mala :? " So long as existence continues, the effects of Karma must continue; and it is only by the cessation of existence that they can be entirely overcome. When any priest attains the rahatship, he cuts off the consequences of demerit." 4 The rahatship is the Bodhi. To a modern Positivist the coffin of death locks up for ever form, sensation, the brain and its dreams. But the Buddhist denies that even bodily shape (rupa) is affected by death. At once the ego goes off to regions of temporary reward or penitence. And in the Lalita Vistara even the Bodhi, or great spiritual birth, only changes the "false Aggregations" for the "Aggregations of the True."5 A 1 Hodgson, pp. 44, 45. 2 See Romantic History, Introd. p. x; Buddha and Early Buddhism, p. 125. 3 Manual, p. 463. 4 Manual, p. 261.

Here (Pl. 1) is Tusita, the highest heaven that a soul can reach before attaining tho Bodhi or emancipation. Above it are the three heavens of the Brahmaloka, that ho must pass through before he loses his form (rupa). And loss of form plainly did not imply loss of individuality when these heavens were partitioned out, for the soul has to pass through the five heavens of the Jinas or Buddhas before he reaches Nirv&amp;napura, which is in four com partments, an idea scarcely consistent with the theory that it means annihilation. I now come to Dr. Rhys Davids* crucial piece of evidence. It consists of three speeches attributed to Buddha, and to be found in one of the "original Pali Suttas" of the "Southern Canon." This sutta is entitled the Brahmaj&amp;la Sutta. The three speeches may be considered the backbone of Dr. Rhys Davids's many lectures, treatises, magazine articles, etc., all of which, on the strength of them, charge Buddha with denying a life after death. As so much importance is at tached to the speeches, I will give them at length. "Priests, among these Samanas and Brahmins are some who hold the doctrine of future conscious existence, and in sixteen modes teach that the soul consciously exists after death. But tho teaching of these Samanas and Brahmins is founded on their ignorance, their want of perception of truth, their own personal experience, and on the fluctuating emotions of those who are under the influence of their passions." " Priests, among these Samanas and Brahmins are some who hold the doctrine of future unconscious existence, and in eight modes teach that the soul exists after death in a state of unconsciousness. But the teaching of these Samanas and Brahmins is founded on ignorance, their want of perception of the truth, their own personal experience, and on the fluctuating emotions of those who are under the influence of their passions." 1 History of Buddhism, p. 74.</page><page sequence="14">THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. 431 " Priests, among these Samanas and Brahmins are some who hold the doctrine of a future state of being neither conscious nor yet unconscious, and in eight modes teach that the soul will hereafter exist in a state between consciousness and unconsciousness. But the teaching of these Samanas and Brahmins is founded on ignorance, their want of perception of truth, their own personal experience, and on the fluctuating emotions of those who are under the influence of their pas sions." Plainty, says the Doctor, conscious existence after death, unconscious existence after death, and existence in a state that is " neither conscious nor unconscious," are here flatly denied. "Would it be possible," he adds triumphantly, "in a more complete and categorical manner to deny that there is any soul, anything of any kind which continues to exist in any manner after death P " Now, considering the enormous superstructure that has been built upon this sutra, the first remark that I have to make is:?Has Dr. Rhys Davids read it ? I will con tinue the passage quoted. It gives us a fourth speech of Buddha on the same subject:? " Priests, among these Samanas and Brahmins are some who affirm that existence is destroyed, and who, in seven modes, teach that existing beings are cut off, destroyed, anni hilated. But the teaching of these Samanas and Brahmins is founded on their ignorance, their want of perception of truth, their own personal experience, and on the fluctuating emotions of those who are under the influence of their passions." l " Would it be possible," I might here say, parodying the emphasis of Dr. Rhys Davids, "in a more complete and categorical manner to affirm that existing beings are never annihilated P " But the subject is very much past a joke. The Brahmajala or net for the Brahmins is constructed to catch every conceivable fish. It belongs to what we 1 Sept Suttas Palis, v. p. 107 (Grimblot).</page><page sequence="15">432 THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. may call the Evangel of Contradiction, the decaying age of Buddhist paradox, and hair-splitting. Buddha is brought on the scene to contradict and condemn every form and aspect of every conceivable question. Burnouf remarked this long ago; and Buddhaghosa praises these "conflicting" judgments as being good for Vinaya (dis cipline).1 If Dr. Rhys Davids considers this Sutra a final authority, I may mention that in many passages the word " soul" is mentioned ;2 and from Buddha's own mouth the doctrine of re-birth is distinctly affirmed.3 He states, more over, that some souls after death will go to that portion of the Brahmaloka which is never destroyed by fire.4 I have more than ouce cited the Lalita Vistara as an authority. It may be answered that Dr. Rhys Davids con siders it no authority at all. " The best authority we have," he says, is the biography that he has translated for us in his ' Birth Stories,' which, he says, is almost word for word the same as Buddhaghosa's life of Buddha in the Attha Kathfl,. Preference is claimed for this Cingalese life on the ground that it is briefer and more free from marvel than the other biographies, points that denote an earlier scripture. I have considered this question at length in my " Buddha aud Early Buddhism." I can only here say that Buddhaghosa admits that his biography is merely a con densation of the Muh&amp;pad&amp;ua Sutta. Dr. Rhys Davids's biography is also confessedly an abridgment from three other books, the Pabbajft Sutta, the Digha Nikaya and an old Cingalese Commentary.5 This disposes of any claims ad vanced on the score of greater brevity, fewer marvels, etc. In the monuments of Asoka the Epic of the Muni (Muni gatha) is mentioned. All the lives of the teachers were no doubt founded on this. The value of the Lalita Vistara in my view is that its many editors have adopted the principle of expansion rather than contraction. We are thus in a better position to judge which was the earlier matter. 1 Tumour, Jour. Beng. Asiat. Soc, vol. vi. p. 624. * Sept Suttas Talis, pp. 72, 73, etc. 3 Ibid. p. 76. * Ibid. p. 78.

I am afraid this is scarcely possible. The whole story of Buddhaghosa and his "compilings" is very suspicious. Buddha died miserably under a tree. His early disciples were required to sleep under a tree every night, and never twice under the same. And yet we are required to believe that three months after his death a pompous Convocation of five hundred Monks, "defined and authenticated" thirty-four tractates, with their long-winded commentaries to boot, a literature as great almost as four of our Bibles, " with a degree of precision which fixed even the number of syllables of which it shoidd consist." l This, it may be added, was at least 200 years before the letters of the alphabet were introduced into India. The second Convocation met b.c. 443. The third assembled at Patna b.c. 309, when Asoka was King. The last two Convocations "reaffirmed" the Canon, a work of super erogation, if every syllable had already been irrevocably fixed. I am afraid we will have to agree with Professor Max Miiller, that the evidence on which we have to rely in the matter of the Cingalese Canon is not what would convince " those who aro accustomed to test historical and chronological evidence in Greece and Rome."2 It must be remembered that at the date when the third Convocation, under the guidance of King Asoka, was " reaffirming " the voluminous Canon, that monarch, in apparent ignorance of the circumstance, caused another list of the chief Buddhist holy books to be in scribed on the Bairat rock. This list consists of seven books, and it differs in toto from tho Cingalese list. I stated this in my work, "Buddha and Early Buddhism/' and an article in the Saturday Rewiew, attributed with justice or injustice to Dr. Rhys Davids, made the following comment upon it. " His argument from the titles on the Asoka monuments 1 Tumour, Journ. Bcng. Asiat. Soc, vol. vi. pp. 605, et seq. 2 Sacred Books of the East, vol. x. p. x.</page><page sequence="17">434 THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. cannot be seriously urged when we know that they are rather descriptions of contents than fixed titles, and may be easily varied."1 I am a little puzzled as to the exact meaning of theso words. If it is meant that each title means a group of books, and not a volume, this, I think, can bo quite disproved. The Munigatha, in the only form that Dr. Rhys Davids sanctions, has, ho tells us, brevity for its most conspicuous merit. The "Admonition to R&amp;hula concerning falsehood uttered by our Lord Buddha" has been restored to us, thanks to the activity of Professor Beal. It occupies two pages of the Chineso Dhammapada.2 The "Supernatural Powers of tho Masters" and the "Terrors of the Future" can scarcely be considered generic titles of large classes of the original Pali volumes by the Doctor, who holds that those volumes ignore " Supernatural powers" in " Masters," and the " Future " altogether. The long winded tractates on Vinaya in Ceylon may have been con sidered a " Summary of Discipline " in those days. It all depends upon the meaning then attached to the word " Summary." I now como to " The Question of Upatishya." Upatishya was one of the names of Siiriputra, Buddha's chief disciple. He was a Brahmin seeking vainly amongst his teachers assurance of immortal life (amrita); and he put to each this question : "Master, what is the method of your doctrine? What advice do you give to your pupil P What is the fruit of an honest life P " Hearing from an ancient Rishi that Buddha had the know ledge of Amrita, he and Maudgalyayana, Buddha's other chief disciple, went off to him. Buddha's answer to the question of Upatishya is recorded in leaf 41 and leaf 50 of the first book of the Dulvi in Csoma Korosi's Analysis of the Canon of Tibet.3 The question of Upatishya and the answer to it constitute, not a library of volumes, but two brief pages of a volume. 1 Saturday Review, Nov. 6, 1881. 2 p. 142. 3 Asiatic Itcscarchcs, vol. xx.</page><page sequence="18">THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. 435 Dr. Oldenberg has suggested another argument, but it seems to me to tell still more completely against the Cingalese school. It is, that tho scriptures which Asoka ordered his monks and nuns to learn by heart are merely " passages." l Passages of what P Tho memory of tho monk was the only vehicle by which Buddhist scriptures ? until the date of Wattaganini, King of Ceylon, b.c. 104 to b.c. 76?were handed down. 2 And if this scanty little fragment was all that the monks were to learn, how has the colossal Canon of Ceylon, in length about as large as four of our bibles, come down to us P I should like very much to agree with Dr. Rhys Davids on the subject, and have overwhelming evidence in favour of such Sfttras as the Tevigga Sutta, but there are many difficul ties in the way. For supposing we admit that the titles on the Bairat rock refer to groups of books, not volumes, they still demolish tho pretensions of Dr. Rhys Davids, because two official classifications of the scriptures of the kingdom differing in toto could scarcely have been drawn up simul taneously. We must be content to conclude that both in north and south we have some archaic Buddhism and much falsification. And it is by stimulating the study of the northern literature, and not, as is the present custom, by discouraging it, that comparisons may be made, and many valuable facts elicited. I will give an instance of what I mean. I alluded in a paper read here last summer, to a litany from Nepal, the Sapta Buddha Stotra. In it, the "Seven Buddhas supreme over all" are invoked in succession, that by their aid the worshipper may obtain " emancipa tion." I will give two of these addresses: "I adore Jinendra, the consuming fire of sorrow, the treasure of holy knowledge, whom all revere, who bore the name of Vipaswi, who was born in the race of mighty monarchs in the city of Bandumati, who was for eighty thousand years the preceptor of gods and men ; and by whom endowed with the ten kinds of power thc degree of Jinendra was obtained at the foot of a Patala tree." 1 Buddhism, p. 134, note. 2 Mahawanso, Chap. 33.</page><page sequence="19">436 THE BUDDHISM OF CEYLON. This is the praise of S&amp;kya Muni : "I adore &amp;&amp;kya.Siiiiha the Buddha, the kinsman of the sun, worshipped by men and gods, who was born at the splendid city of Kapilapura, of the family of the chief of tho Sakya Kings, the life of which best friend to all the world lasted 100 years. Having 6pccdily subdued desire, un bounded wisdom was acquired by him at the foot of the Aswattha tree." l In Ceylon we have this litany also, but another story is told of it. You shall compare the two. It is recorded that when Buddha was on the mountain called the Eagle's Peak near Rajagriha, a demon named Vessavana visited him and gave him a charm to be recited by his male and female dis ciples as a " defence " against all the demons of the universe. I will cite a few paragraphs. " Adored be the all-seeing and glorious Vipassi (Vipassissa nam). " Adored be Vessabhu, the subjector and destroj'er of the passions. " Worship Gautama the Conqueror! " We worship Gautama the Conqueror, the Buddha endued with all knowledge." 2 Here we catch Dishonesty in his studio. The Litany has been explained away to suit the agnostic school. The words "Adoration to Buddha" by a silly story have been trans ferred from a prayer used after his death, to an address made to him whilst he was alive. The Litany was well known to the pcoplo, and therefore could not be entirely obliterated. The Stupa of Bharhut, as I have shown, authenticates this Litany by showing that the early temples had shrines for their seven Buddhas with marble trees corresponding to the list in the Stotra. Although more wild theories are abroad concerning Buddhism than any other old creed, it has oddly enough the most trustworthy archives of all. Within 250 years of the death of the founder, Asoka carved his credo on the rocks : 1 Asintic Researches, vol. xvi. p. 4.*&gt;4.

For equal to this belief I declare unto you, ye shall not find such a means of propitiating Heaven."?First Dhauli Edict (Prinsep). " Among whomsoever the name of God resteth, this verily is religion."?Edict, No. VII. (Prinsep). "I have appointed religious observances that mankind having listened thereto shall be brought to follow in the right path, and give glory to God."?Ibid. No cavilling can explain away the word Isana. To the Brahmin of Asoka's time it meant the Supreme. And on the subject of eternal life of the individual the King is equally explicit. " I pray with every variety of prayer for those who differ with me in creed, that they, following after my example, may with me attain unto eternal salvation."?Delhi Pillar, Edict VI. (Prinsep).

The first, without any of the sinister apparatus of propa gandism, the faggot, the axe, the scimitar, won India, and the second lost it.1 1 Owing to a press of matter there has been some delay in priutiug this paper, and intermediately I havo discovered the epoch of the rise of Agnostic Buddhism.
