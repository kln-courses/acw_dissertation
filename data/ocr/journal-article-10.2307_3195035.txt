<plain_text><page sequence="1">Simian Narratives at the Intersection of Science and Literature Paulo Medeiros The concern with our origins is one of the most pervasive. In an attempt at finding an answer to the perennial question of where we came from we often must question what we are, so that a search for origins is foremost an attempt at definition. The similarity between humans and other primates was inescapable from the beginning and as such it is no surprise that those who tried to find more about humans made use of apes as an approximatory tool of investigation. Especially when it was still difficult to gain access to the human body as a means of research, scientists availed themselves when possible of the bodies of apes, as in the case of Edward Tyson's pioneering Orang-Outang, sive Homo Sylvestris: Or the Anatomy of a Pygmie Compared to that of a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man (1699). Nowadays with technological advancements making such excursions unnecessary, researchers still turn to the study of apes when they want to look at human social features and their possible development.' The very term "simian" and its analogues like "similar" point to a strong correlation between the behavior of humans and other primates. The importance of such a link is made even more explicit through E. R. Curtius' brief discussion of "The Ape as Metaphor" which shows the importance of the concept of "simia" not only as an epithet for writers and other artists but also for the notion of mimetical representation. Scientific writings focusing on apes and dealing with evolutionary issues have found a broad audience, especially after Darwin. Even if the same cannot be said of their literary counterparts, as simian narratives never quite entered the mainstream of literature, many acclaimed authors--Flaubert, Kafka, Dinesen, to name only a few-have chosen to portray apes prominently, thereby attesting to the continuous interest in the ape as a literary character.2 In the West, simian narratives are at first almost exclusively fabulous.3 With the work of Tyson in 1699, it is no surprise then, that this, the first modern scientific look at apes, concerns itself as well with the literary representations of simians. From then on scientific and literary narratives proceed in close relationship until the publication of Darwin's theories. The highmark for the scientific discourse on simians and their relationship to man, also indicates the first dividing line between scientific and literary texts. Whereas the scientific writings will build on Darwin's premises and show in ever increasing detail how the evolutionary process functions, literary texts become involved rather in de-evolution.4 Although hominoid apes were not unknown in the west, as their frequent representation in the plastic arts from the Middle Ages onwards attests to, confusion about their nature and the different species is common until the dawn of the nineteenth century. Tyson's work is illus- 59</page><page sequence="2">trative of this confusion. Searching a great many ancient sources which refer to pygmies, cynecephali and satyrs, Tyson conclusively shows that for the most part the authors must have been referring to some sort of ape if they were not simply inventing or copying from previous sources. While Tyson clearly dispels many myths he also falls into another case of mistaken identity: in his fervor to exclude the greatest number possible of creatures-until then thought to compose exotic races of mankind- from the ranks of humanity, he also considers pygmies to be apes. The anatomical study he makes of the one specimen available to him clearly illustrates differences and similarities between it and men; but it was a chimpanzee and not an orang-outang nor a pygmie that Tyson dissected.5 Indeed, despite the attempt, in great part successful, to draw a clear line between fact and fiction, Tyson's work perpetuates some interesting fictions which would be explored by subsequent authors. Tyson establishes the boundary between humans and animals ultimately on the capacity for speech and this has been upheld with few exceptions up to today." Thus, literary authors also frequently use speech as a main issue when writing simian narratives. The acquisition of speech, in most cases, marks the ascendancy of the ape to human status and its loss, consequently, a return to animality. This is the case, for example, in Kafka's "A Report to an Academy," which prepares the way for the texts concerned rather with de-evolution. In Kafka's text the ape Red Peter tells the academy that it was with his shout of "Hallo," prompted by the emptying of a bottle of schnapps, that he became part of humanity: "..o. weil ich nicht anders konnte, weil es mich draingte, weil mir die Sinne rauschten, kurz und gut 'Hallo!' ausrief, in Menschenlaut ausbrach, mit diesem Ruf in die Menschengemeinschaft sprang . . ." (153; 257: "..0. because I could not help it, because my senses were reeling, called a brief and unmistakable 'Hallo!' breaking into human speech, and with this outburst broke into the human community ..."). One of the fictions which Tyson helped to keep alive is paradig- matic of the interaction between scientific and literary texts as regards simian narratives: the reported miscegenation between apes and humans. When approaching the subject of simian sexuality, it is as if most, if not all, of Tyson's careful rationalization, which enables him to classify the reports of exotic races of men as mere fables, abandons him:7 But whether the Testes being thus closely pursed up to the Body, might contribute to that great salaciousness this Species of Animals are noted for, I will not determine: Tho' 'tis said, that these Animals, that have their Testicles contained within the Body, are more inclined to it, than others. That the whole Ape-kind is extremely given to Venery, appears by infinite Stories related of them. And not only so, but different from other Brutes, they covet not only their own species, but to an Excess are inclined and sollicitous to those of a different, and are most amorous of fair Women. Besides what I have already mentioned, Gabriel Clauderus [68] tells us of an Ape, which grew so amorous of one of the Maids of Honour, who was a celebrated Beauty, that no Chains, nor Confinement, nor Beating, could keep within Bounds; so that the Lady was forced to petition to have him banished the Court. (42) 60</page><page sequence="3">The figure of the ape as lover which captured Tyson's credulity might have had its origins in Indian stories which Tyson throughout his book otherwise discounts as fictional, not even quoting them but merely referring to their existence. It certainly could be found in the Thousand and One Nights where a princess and an ape appear to be enamoured.8 A wide-spread, if perhaps unnoticed version can be found in Voltaire's Candide where in chapter sixteen Candide, upon spotting two women running from two apes, shoots and kills the apes, only to find out by the women's mourning that they were their lovers. After the shooting and the revelation by Candide's companion, Cacambo, that the women and apes were lovers, Candide recalls hav- ing heard stories told about similar occurrences which had resulted in the creation of mixed offspring, "Aegipans, fauns, and satyrs," some- thing which until then he had not believed: "Mais je prenais cela pour des fables" (212; 44: "but I took that for fables"). Tyson, on the contrary, had accepted the possibility of such reports being true: "But that Story of Castanenda in his Annuals of Portugal (if true) is very remarkable" (42). He reproduces the account, according to which a woman who was left upon an island ended by conceiving two children from an ape. When brought back to Europe by sailors she was sentenced upon by the King of Portugal who decreed perpetual cloister confinement as a way of attonement.9 Buffon, in the second half of the eighteenth century, is still deeply affected by this supposed interest of the ape for women, even if he does not provide any story of interspecies offspring. In "Nomenclature des Singes" (Nomenclature of Apes) his description of the orang-outang's and baboon's behavior is worthy of mention. About the orang-outang Buffon writes that: Mais depuis les Anciens, depuis la d6couverte des parties m6ridionales de l'Afrique &amp; des Indes, on a trouv6 un autre singe avec cet attribut de grandeur, un singe aussi haut, aussi fort que l'homme, aussi ardent pour les femmes que pour les femelles.1' (But after the Ancients, after the discovery of the meridional regions of Africa and of the Indies, another ape has been found with that characteristic of greatness: an ape as tall and as strong as man, and as hot for women as for its females.) His comments on the baboon are even more revealing: Ii est insolement lubrique, &amp; affecte de se montrer en cet 6tat, de se toucher, de se satisfaire seul aux yeux de tout le monde; &amp; cette action, l'une des plus honteuses de l'humanit6, &amp; qu'aucun animal ne se permet, copiee par la main du babouin, rapelle l'idee du vice, &amp; rend abominable l'aspect de cette bete que la Nature paroit avoir particulibrement vou'e a cette espece d'impudence; .. . il semble faire parade de toutes ces nudites, pr6sentant son derriere plus souvent que sa tote, sur-tout des qu'il apernoit des femmes pour lesquelles il dnploie une telle 6ffronterie, qu'elle ne peut naitre que du d6sir le plus immod6r&amp;. 61</page><page sequence="4">(127; He is insolently libidinous and likes to show himself in that state, to touch himself, and to satisfy himself in the eyes of everyone; and that action, one of humanity's most shameful, and which no animal allows itself, when copied by the hand of the baboon recalls the idea of the vice and renders abominable the looks of that beast, which Nature seems to have particularly devoted to that kind of impudence; ... he seems to make a show of all those nudities, presenting his posterior more often than his head, especially when he sees women to whom he displays such effronteries, which cannot but be born from the most immoder- ate desire.) Throughout the cited text it is clear that Buffon endows the baboon with rather human-like characteristics which he accordingly then judges from a moral point of view. Especially telling is the rhetorical passage which, to take literally the image of copying, so prevalent when referring to simian behavior, would imply that the baboon at some point must have observed a man flagrante delicto. Modem writers have also seized upon this supposed characteristic of apes and have enlarged upon it. The presumed possible miscegenation is thus at the root of an early story by Flaubert. In "Quidquid volueris" ("Whatever You Want"), the central character, Djalioh, is the product of the rape of a black Brazilian slave by a gorilla. Such an encounter had been cunningly orchestrated by a M. Paul, who thus expected to take his revenge on the slave who had refused his advances and at the same time win a bet that it would be possible to raise the offspring of an animal and a human. The gorilla escaped, the woman died during labor and M. Paul brings up Djalioh as if he were his adoptive son, something for which he receives a prize from the Academy. As the story progresses and M. Paul marries, the reader is confronted by the increasing desire felt by Djalioh for the bride of his adoptive father. Flaubert contrasts the real emotion felt by the beast with the materialistic designs of the man, actually classifying the two as mon- sters of a different sort: "Voila le monstre de la nature qui 6tait en contact avec M. Paul, cet autre monstre, ou plut6t cette merveille de la civilisation, et qui en portait tout les symboles, grandeur de l'sprit, s6cheresse du coeur" (315; 83: "That's the kind of natural monster who was befriended by Paul, who was himself a marvelous monster of civilization outfitted with all its symbols, great intelligence, and shriveled soul"). Following all of Flaubert's ironical comments on the state of civilized society, in the end Djalioh attempts to rape Addle, the object of his impossible desire: first he kills Adble's baby from M. Paul, then his advances towards her result in a struggle which culminates in the death of both, leaving M. Paul to enjoy his new freedom. Not all authors decide to stress the notion of miscegenation even though writing narratives in which the figure of the ape is imbued with strong erotic overtones and even power. For instance, Isak Dinesen's "The Monkey" clearly shows that she had read Flaubert's story and in her story a monkey plays a decisive role in the seduction dinner which has for consequence the forceful union of a young officer with his prospective but unwilling bride. Yet, this story is not concerned with the scientific 62</page><page sequence="5">background but rather in exploring its theme, even if ironically, in an atmosphere of enchantment, complete with a mysterious Walpurgis Night scene and a love potion." The popular works of Jane Goodall, beginning in the sixties, are not without their share of mystery and enchantment, but they clearly fall into the domain of science writing and present indeed a unique view into the life of chimpanzees in the wild.'2 The sexual behavior of the chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream in Tanzania is described in detail as it provides many clues to the way in which the chimpanzee community is organized and interacts. In doing so, Goodall often establishes comparisons between human and chimpanzee behavior as, for instance, when she remarks that though chimpanzees do not form lasting monogamous relationships, their promiscuous behavior is not so different from that of some humans in modem society (In the Shadow of Man, 193). Nowhere does Goodall indulge in the phantasizing over the supposed sexual interest of apes for humans common to Tyson and Buffon. There is no mention of even such a possibility in either of her two earlier books and only a veiled reference in The Chimpanzees of Gombe, when discussing the different reactions individual chimpanzees display when followed by human observers: One adult male, Humphrey, often expressed dissatisfaction with his observers by throwing large rocks at them. It seemed that Humphrey was more tolerant of male observers, and most of his threats were directed toward women. In general, chimpanzees are more likely to take liberties with humans of the female sex. Some adolescent males, for instance, clearly attempt to dominate female researchers at the time when they are struggling to dominate females of their own kind. (57) Liberties is rather a vague term; the reference to attempted domination on the part of adolescent male chimpanzees on the other hand, seems to open the way for more definite sexual connotations.'3 Yet, even if some occurrences happened in which adolescent male chimpan- zees tried to engage human female observers in some form of sexual contact-either as an end result in itself or because such displays are part of the way in which chimpanzees establish and recognize social hierarchy-Goodall's phrasing is very subdued. Shirley C. Strum in her study of baboons presents a more detailed incident of an adolescent male baboon attempting to dominate her: One young male decided that I might be easier bait than the high-ranking female he was trying to entice, so when he gave up on her, he started on me. As usual, I moved away. He moved closer; I moved again. Plan A was definitely not working; he tailed me wherever I went. Finally, I switched to Plan B. I refused to look at him or even let him believe that I could look at him. He threatened; I shunned. We both knew what this meant, but he was stubborn and refused to give up. We moved around in small concentric circles, the juvenile all the time taking a new position directly in front of me. Just when I was getting quite dizzy he moved off. I was convinced; sooner or later you could control what was going on by refusing to acknowledge it. (59) 63</page><page sequence="6">With these two examples in mind it seems clear that when the animals make advancements towards the human female observers they are, first, young males, trying out how to move in the social hierarchy; and second, that both the chimpanzees and the baboon were extending a common behavior pattern to beings which, although different in kind, were in direct interaction with the group even when such interaction was limited to observation. The way in which Buffon portrays his baboon leaves the reader inclined to believe that the animal was intent in crossing the species bar- rier out of an immoral and inordinate desire towards women, something which of course is more revelatory of the observer than of the observed. Strum's conclusions on the functioning and structuring of baboon society make even more evident the peculiar biases which can affect scientific observation. Her attempts at demonstrating that the patriarchal model based on aggression was not in touch with baboon reality, being more a projection of human society, met with great resistance.'4 Of interest too is how Strum decides to approach her objects of study. As she starts observing the "Pumphouse Gang" she notices that an outsider male, Ray, is trying to join the group. Thus, at a period in which her observations are still tentative as regards the meaning of interaction within the baboon group, Strum finds an equal counterpart to herself, the obvious gender and species differences excepted: Ray was still with Pumphouse next day. He again assumed a position that looked like that of an orchestra director, with his devoted musicians in a semicircle around him. Today, and for many days to come, he was the observed outcast, whose aloof presence was soon taken for granted. As I relaxed about Ray, no longer anticipating his aggression, I began to feel easier about my own role. Nothing I did was done rapidly; the whole process took several months. But gradually I was moving closer, and finally, on foot, into the troop itself. (27) The parallelism in the behavior and (to a certain extent) intention, of both baboon and human is self-evident. Just as the outsider male baboon moves in closer and is finally accepted by the baboon com- munity, so the outsider female human moves "into the troop itself." By behaving like Ray, Strum in fact partially assumes the position of a male baboon with respect to the baboon group. Partially, because not only does Strum refrain from active (i.e., touch) interaction with the community, but her gender and difference in species cannot be avoided by the baboons.'- Yet the adoption of baboon behavior on the part of the human observer should be kept in mind when faced with the fact of baboons reacting to humans as if there were no difference between them. Indeed, the very way in which Strum avoids the advances of the juvenile baboon is an imitation of baboon behavior itself. Furthermore, if the similarity between her behavior and that of Ray was clear to the human, it too was clear to the baboon. Describing a confrontation for status on the part of Ray and two adult male baboons, Strum relates how Ray suddenly charged at her: 64</page><page sequence="7">I was more baffled than alarmed; none of the baboons had ever been aggressive toward me, even when they were being aggressive with one another. This, I had reasoned, was another benefit of not interacting with the troop: I was neither friend nor foe. Yet here was Ray, making straight for me. There was no mistaking what he meant, and it took me only a few long seconds to figure out what was happening. Ray wasn't threatening me; he was soliciting my help. He wanted me to support him against the other males! (36-7) This account is in direct opposition to Buffon's description of a baboon. Where Buffon anthropomorphized his subject to an extreme level, Strum presents rather an animal behaving towards the human observer as if she were a male baboon. The anthropomorphizing ten- dency manifests itself in modem scientific texts mostly in the naming of the apes; and the way in which within the narrative process of presenting observations, relationships between apes are given human tones. Thus the reader of In the Shadow of Man is presented at one point with the description of the unusual relationship between two chimpanzees, in which the male is named after Goodall's own husband at the time, Baron Hugo van Lawick: ... we noticed that a strange sort of relationship had grown up between Flo and one of her suitors-a relationship of a type we have never seen since. The male was Rodolf (his real name is Hugo, but two named Hugo in one book are confusing, and so I have given him Hugo's second name). Rodolf, in those days, was a high-ranking and enormously big and powerful chimpanzee, and he became Flo's faithful escort. He walked everywhere just beside her or behind her, he stopped when she stopped, he slept in the nest closest to hers. And it was to Rodolf that Flo often hurried when she was hurt or frightened during those weeks, and he would lay his hand reassuringly on her or sometimes put one arm around her. Yet he did not protest in any way when other males mated with Flo. (97)16 Curiously enough, Bernard Malamud in God's Grace, a book in which he expressly acknowledges the influence of Goodall's In the Shadow of Man, has the central character wed a female chimpanzee. The decision to engage in the inter-species relationship is a difficult one for Cohn, the scientist who had found himself as the sole human survivor of a nuclear holocaust. He is motivated by the desire to propagate human- ity; and his doubts, in the end, are mitigated by the consoling illusion that the results of such a union might show improvement over the humans who had managed to annihilate themselves. His willing bride is the only young female in an island where more and more apes keep appearing and Cohn's semi-scientific motivation is alien to her. It is not that she regards Cohn as a superior biological specimen, but that she has fallen in love with him after he had introduced her to Shakespeare; to her he is a new Romeo: "She told him she was pure. 'I have kept my virginity for you ever since you expwained [sic] the world to me when you first read me Romeo and Juwiet' [sic]" (185). Another modern narrative which shows an awareness of Goodall's 65</page><page sequence="8">In the Shadow of Man is T. Coraghessan Boyle's "Descent of Man." This is made evident by the dining scene where a group of scientists eagerly consumes the brains of a live monkey and by the name given the principal researcher at the Primate Center, Jane Good. Goodall was the first to report on her field observation of chimpanzees eating meat and hunting other monkeys: During the ten years that have passed since I began work at the Gombe Stream we have recorded chimpanzees feeding on the young bushbucks, bushpigs and baboons as well as both young and adult red colobus monkeys, redtail monkeys, and blue monkeys. (In the Shadow of Man, 204) Furthermore, Goodall also specifies that "the brain appears to be a special delicacy" (In the Shadow of Man, 211), and comments that not only should it be no surprise that chimpanzees would eat human babies if given the opportunity, but that "in a great many places throughout their range chimpanzees are considered a delicacy by humans" (In the Shadow of Man, 205).1' This is expanded in The Chimpanzees of Gombe,'8 where basing herself on other researchers Goodall comments on human canni- balism: "Many fossil skulls from that time [mid-Pleistocene] on are char- acterized by a 'careful and symmetric incising of the periphery of the foramen magnum,' which on the basis of comparative evidence is as- sumed to have been made for the purpose of extracting the brain for eating."'" Goodall also reports how chimpanzees cannibalized several chimpanzee infants within and without their own group.20 Boyle's story is narrated by Jane's lover who, amidst the expla- nation from a colleague of Jane on the custom of eating monkey brains, is himself sitting over some, as they protrude from the circular hole in the center of the table. Asking his foreign neighbor what the pinkish dish might be he receives the ambiguous answer, "'Much delicacy"' (11). Its meaning becomes apparent, even if not explicit, when the narrator's leg is suddenly grabbed by a tiny fist from under the table. Throughout the story it is evident that the narrator feels Jane's scientific interests stand in the way of their relationship. The perceived rivalry becomes embodied in the figure of Konrad, a chimpanzee who communicates in American Sign Language. He is an apparent genius who translates into Yerkish not only Darwin's Origin of Species but Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil as well. At one point, excited by the televised coverage of an unspecified war, Konrad prophetizes a revolu- tionary turn-over in the world. Jane's translation gives us the meaning of Konrad's gestures: "Konrad says that 'the pig oppressors' genocidal tactics will lead to their mutual extermination and usher in a new golden age ... '-here she hesitated, looked up at him to continue (he was springing up and down on the couch, flailing his fists as though they held whips and scourges)-'... of freedom and equality for all, regardless of race, creed, color--or genus.'.. ." (14) 66</page><page sequence="9">Even though Jane tries to discount Konrad's intentions by classi- fying them as part "of his daily slice of revolutionary rhetoric" and saying that "he likes to play Che," in the end her experiments take on a new course which might just help bring about Konrad's notions. Having found that Jane left him, her lover decides to search for her at the Primate Center and, overcoming the initial resistance put up by the janitor and another scientist, he barges in upon his former lover: Inside I found Jane, legs and arms bare, pinching a lab smock across her chest. She looked puzzled at first, then annoyed. She stepped up to me, made some rude gestures in my face. I could hear scrambling in the hallway behind me. Then I saw Konrad-in a pair of baggy BVDs. (16) Jane's lover succumbs to Konrad's power and as the story con- cludes, his name, Mr. Home, acquires full meaning but the reader is left to speculate on the result of the experiment. In Malamud's God's Grace on the other hand, Cohn and Mary Madelin, his chimpanzee bride, have a child. Her life is brief though, as Cohn's dominance over the apes quickly erodes until he and the child are killed. With Cohn's death all vestiges of human civilization are gone, the last trace represented by the Gorilla who chants a Kaddish for him. Malamud's novel represents the latest step in this interaction between scientific and literary texts around the issue of apes and their relationship to humans.2' Gods Grace as well as "Descent of Man" present evolution only negatively. It is not so much that the apes progress to the level of humans but rather that humans convert themselves, either freely or as a last resort, to the simian level. God's Grace makes wide use of the new information provided by the work of Goodall in the description of chimpanzee behavior and attributes, down to the characterization of the female chimpanzee's sexual swelling as a "pink flower." Likewise, when Mary Madelin flees from the advances of the male chimpanzees, her actions closely parallel those of Flo in In the Shadow of Man. Malamud's choice of presenting an offspring from the union of a chimpanzee and a man though, goes right back to Tyson and Buffon, except that their preoccupation with the male ape's supposed desire for women is here inverted: it is a female chimpanzee which is forward while presenting a romantic picture, in direct contrast to the supposedly lecherous intents of Tyson's and Buffon's male apes. Thus, Malamud achieves a complete circle in the intersection of science and literature: In God's Grace literature not only turns science into literature but reclaims literature from science. In this brief outline of the way literary texts deploy simian charac- ters in close relation to scientific ones I hope to have demonstrated two points beyond the obvious way in which literature incorporates scientific lessons: one concerns the way in which post-Darwinian literature, even as it relies on scientific information, actually reverses the evolutionary project; the other focuses on the very rhetoricity of the scientific 67</page><page sequence="10">discourse, which, even when far from the wild speculations and con- fusions of pre-modem science, still maintains a fictional quality. With regard to the first point it should be noted that, given the unrelenting questioning of human blindness by Kafka and his explicit criticism of anthropomorphism, literary texts that reused simians as principal char- acters could not but stress human faults. Indeed, even before Kafka's story, it could be argued, as Curtius demonstrates in his consideration of the metaphorical use of "simian," a motivation for the use of simian characters would be precisely to ridicule human pretensions and satirize society. What Kafka accomplishes and other subsequent writers expressly amplify, however, is the consideration that not only is our human per- spective flawed but that it too might perish. In this respect, modem writers are very far from Rousseau and the idealization of nature; they are also distanced from Flaubert: whereas M. Paul survives the death of Djalioh and Addle, Cohn and his mixed offspring are killed. In ref- erence to the second point, it is not so much the reiteration of the way scientific discourse depends on rhetorical strategies that we have come to regard as obvious by now that interests me, as the fact that this par- ticular discourse seems to focus both on power and desire; not that it corrects the more overtly fantastical features of its pre-modern ante- cedent, but that it still is very much preoccupied with the same issues. This too can possibly be explained by the very nature of the scientific study of simians, in which the object of study is as much humanity as the simians themselves. In another way I am conscious too of having but begun to scratch the surface: the preoccupation with simian characters, fictive or not, addresses not only the question of human identity in terms of species, but in terms of gender as well. From all the texts mentioned only Kafka's and Tyson's do not stress sexual aspects. In Tyson's case what is relevant is the genuine mix-up of species and the subsequent blurring of the lines defining humanity and bestiality; in Kafka's case, Red Peter only refers to his sexual companion, a submissive female chimpanzee, to emphasize the oppressive nature of human captivity. All the other writers, however, emphasize various sexual permutations and either indulge more or less explicity in what could be termed fantasies of miscegenation or use it as an element indicative of human insignificance. As Leyla Perrone- Mois6s notes in reference to Flaubert's text, "[i]f Djalioh, animal and black, is M. Paul's other, for Djalioh and for M. Paul, as males, the other is Adble" (148). So that the use of the simian characters as intermediaries between male fantasies and the object of desire appears constant even when it is reversed, as in Malamud's case, or the author is a woman, as in Dinesen's case. This issue is more complex in the case of either Goodall or Sturm, as women who come to dominate in a traditionally male realm, but Sturm's realization that she was being asked to perform the role of a male baboon, might even be ironically reflective of the changed conditions of modem science. Furthermore, given the fact that apes are not native to Europe they are immediately associated with exoticism, or at least provide a degree of otherness that goes beyond simple species differentiation. As such, simian narratives also would need to be seen 68</page><page sequence="11">from the perspective of colonialism and racism. If one considers that- even referring only to the authors mentioned here, their respective dates, and the obvious intertextuality at work-a long and important tradition could be claimed for simian narratives, then one might even claim that these texts indicate the existence of a quasi-apocryphal aesthetics that parallels and mirrors more established lines of influence. Bryant College NOTES 1. George B. Schaller makes this most clear in his introduction to Shirley C. Strum's Almost Human: A Journey into the World of Baboons, xii: "Baboon society is not, of course, a template for human society, early or otherwise. . . Such studies as Almost Human, however, also help to define the spectrum of options open to early humans and the principles that might have governed their societies. This is more than an intriguing scientific exercise, for it emphasizes that humankind is not bound by its heritage into using force, that it can choose to live in peace, harmony, cooperation and friendship. A contemplation of baboons can help humankind correct a skewed view of itself." 2. See H. W. Janson's Apes and Ape Lore in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the only detailed study to date of the use of the monkey as motif in literature and the visual arts. W. C. McDermott's The Ape in Antiquity also provides some information; Margaret Gump in "From Ape to Man and From Man to Ape" takes a look at several ape stories, especially Hauff's "Der Affe als Mensch," Hoffman's "Nachricht von einem gebildeten jungen Mann," Kafka's "Bericht ffir eine Akademie" and O'Neill's The Hairy Ape, briefly relating their satirical quality. I am cur- rently preparing a more comprehensive discussion of the use of simians as characters in modern literature. 3. Aristotle already notes the existence of apes, giving a very straight-forward and informative account, free of any fabulous speculation. He notes their resemblance to man and ascribes them both to the category to which man belongs and to that of the quadrupeds. He concludes his description with a reference to dissection: "In all animals of this sort the internal parts, when dissected, resemble those of man." See Aristotle, Historia Animalium, 1:103-7. 4. For the overall impact of Darwin's thought on literature (especially as it concerns the works of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy), see Gillian Beer, Darwin's Plots: Evolutionary Narrative in Darwin, George Eliot and Nineteenth-Century Fiction. 5. Confused terminology often is also a certain indicator of an undefined perception of the object of study itself. Ashley Montagu on page 10 of his introduction to the facsimile edition of Tyson's work remarks that "Orang- outang" was used indiscriminately to refer to any ape, including the gorilla, until the middle of the nineteenth century. 6. Talking with the animals is a theological as much as a scientific question. But even just within the scientific community opinions will differ greatly as to the capacity of apes to acquire language. The controversy stems mostly from the way one ultimately defines language itself. Although there 69</page><page sequence="12">has been no success in teaching any non-human primate to use human language consistently, several scientists have claimed differing rates of success in eliciting communication from chimpanzees using different "sign" systems from Yerkish to ASL. Jane Goodall provides a most succinct account of these in The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior, 9-12. See also her more detailed study of communication in its varied forms, 117-43. 7. Donna Haraway presents a very informative account of the development of modern Primatology in "Primatology Is Politics by Other Means." Feminist Approaches to Science. Ed. Ruth Bleier, 77-118. Among the many important issues she raises and clarifies is the preeminent importance accorded to sex and reproduction for both biologists and anthropologists in reference to primate studies: ". . . whether monkeys and apes are imagined as old-fashioned organisms or new-fangled coding systems, for primatology, sex and its control are inescapably what need to be known and explained" (91). 8.

Volume Four (1885) contains the story of "The King's Daughter and the Ape" which comes at the end of the three hundred and fifty-fifth night and continues into the next night. This is how it begins: "There was once a Sultan's daughter, whose heart was taken with love of a black slave: he abaited her maidenhead and she became passionately addicted to futtering, so that she could not do without it a single hour and complained of her case to one of her body-women, who told her that no thing poketh and stroketh more abundantly that the baboon. Now it so chanced one day, that an ape-leader passed under her lattice, with a great ape; so she unveiled her face and looking upon the ape, signed to him with her eyes, whereupon he broke his bonds and chain and climbed up to the Princess, who hid him in a place with her, and night and day he abode there, eating and drinking and copulating" (297). The monkey later is killed by a man who takes his place. Also of interest is Burton's note to the word "Baboon": "Arab. 'Kird' (pron. in Egypt 'Gird'). It is usually the hideous Abyssinian cynocephalus ... The beast has a natural penchant for women; I heard of one which attempted to rape a girl in the public street and was prevented only by a sentinel's bayonet." Note too that Burton explicity says he "heard" of the happening, not that he saw it, but his note adds an impression of validity to the otherwise fabulous event of the narrative. 9. It is of note that Tyson, who otherwise provides full translations for his sources, either from Greek into Latin and English or from Latin to English, decides to let this passage remain in the Latin. 10. The first fifteen volumes appeared between 1749 and 1767, the whole only being completed posthumously in 1804. This work was very influential, being translated into several languages and undergoing several editions. I refer throughout to the 1878 edition: Leclerc de Buffon, "Nomenclature des Singes." Vol. 7. Histoire Naturelle. 11. Another important text which explores the figure of the monkey as source of eroticism is Octavio Paz's El Mono Gramdtico. But here too there is no direct concern with scientific texts, Paz being interested rather in exploring deconstructionist possibilities. 12.

Dominance is used as a term to refer to social behavior, linked with hier- archy and power which has no direct bearing on sexuality. Chimpanzees constantly reorganize their relative positions within their communities and it is only indirectly that an individual's dominant position will reflect itself sexually. Goodall makes this clear when she discusses patterns of aggressive behavior in The Chimpanzees of Gombe: "Adolescent males challenge adult females in this way as they begin their long struggle to subordinate them before turning to the lower ranking of the adult males" (325). Conversely, one cannot avoid the often explicit sexual nature of dominance, starting with the recognized submissive posture in which the animal will present itself to the dominant one as if in an offer for sexual intercourse. It is also helpful to refer to one of the many photographs included in In the Shadow of Man: one which, on the back cover, shows a young chim- panzee carefully lifting Jane Goodall's shirt at the waist line while glancing upwards. Curiosity too can have many interpretations. 14. This is a topic which Strum develops at relative length to show that her "conclusion that males didn't really have a meaningful dominance hier- archy met with downright hostility" (163 and 156-67). See also Donna Haraway, "Primatology Is Politics by Other Means" for an extended discussion of the (sexual) politics involved in recent developments in Primatology, clearly delineating the movements which led to the in- volvement (and visibility) of female researchers in field work on apes. 15. Strum describes an early incident which makes clear how much "informa- tion" baboons would have regarding her difference to them: "I decided I would pee on the spot. Trying not to move too quickly, I lowered my shorts. So far, so good. Suddenly every baboon around stopped dead in its tracks. They stared at me in wonder as the sound reached them. I thought I understood what was going on; up until then, I'd arrived, watched and left. They hadn't seen me eat, rest, drink or sleep. They hadn't been fooled into thinking I was a baboon. They knew I was human, but they had never been so close to one before and maybe they thought humans didn't have to pee. They stared, but not one ran away, and when I pulled up my shorts, they lost interest. The next time, they didn't react at all" (36). 16. There are many more possible examples. Strum also names the baboons she studies and as in Goodall's case, the names often reflect those of real people. Another striking example would be the introductory chimpanzee vitae Goodall provides at the beginning of The Chimpanzees of Gombe. 17. Although Goodall mentions two reported cases of chimpanzees capturing human babies, in one instance one infant having reportedly been recovered dead with its limbs partially eaten, she herself did not witness any such cases. This is referred to again at more length in The Chimpanzees of Gombe, 282-83. 18. Although this was published after Boyle's story, Goodall's evidence on chimpanzee cannibalism had already been previously published (1977): Jane Goodall, "Infant-killing and Cannibalism in Free-living Chimpanzees." 19. It seems that Goodall accepts the evidence for the wide-spread practice of human cannibalism without questions. For a dissenting, if highly contested, view see W. Arens, The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology &amp; Anthropophagy. Furthermore, Armando and Barbara Favazza in Bodies Under Siege: Self-Mutilation in Culture and Psychiatry relate that "[t]rephination, the deliberate removal of bone from the skull, is an ancient surgical procedure that has persisted to current times" (64). Their account indicates that the practice was wide-spread with thousands of skulls all over 71</page><page sequence="14">the world having been found with incisions on them. They also list a series of conditions which would have warranted (up to the nineteenth century in England) making incisions on the skull of living patients either in an attempt at healing them or as preventive medicine. 20. Goodall refers to the instances observed by her team on several occasions and also lists other reports of chimpanzee cannibalism which indicate its generality (The Chimpanzees of Gombe, 283-85). The following is but an example, relevant for the description of the incision on the forehead of the victim: "Observers, attracted by the sound of conflict, came upon a party of Kasakela males with Melissa, who was clutching a dead newborn infant. His forehead had been bitten into (which was how Passion and Pom [two in-group females] had killed known victims" (283-84). 21. A later novel, Michael Stewart's 1983 Monkey Business, also shows a clear dependence on scientific texts and it too presents the relationship between a female chimpanzee and the paraplegic former athlete for whom she cares, amidst a profusion of scientific terms related to experimental therapy. Yet, it reverts more into science fiction or gothic horror, when the principal researcher comes upon a drug which gives the apes and the human patient supernatural telepathic powers. And the female chimpanzee recurs to other apes when in estro. The sophomoric plot, crude writing, and the implausi- ble doomsday ending overshadow the novel's thematic interest. WORKS CITED Arens, W.
