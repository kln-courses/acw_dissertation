This English translation and revision of a work first published in German under the title Der Aufbau des Organismus (i) now makes it possible for a very wide range of readers to become acquainted with one of the most important works on theoretical biology published during this century. Professor GOLDSTEIN'S fundamental studies in the com- parative anatomv of the nervous system and in the field of clinical neurology have earned him a world-wide reputation as both a brilliant thinker and an original investigator. From these studies there has gradually emerged a viewpoint concerning the nature of neural and behavioral events which has, in turn, led to a method of approach to (I) Der Aufbau des Organismus, Haag, Nijhoff, 1934.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 391 the study not only of such phenomena but to the study of all vital phenomena relating to the organism as a whole. Those who are already acquainted with the author's views will take up the present volume with a pleasurable anticipation of stimulating thought, in which they will not be disappointed, while those readers who are not acquainted with Professor GOLDSTEIN'S work will find in this volume a revaluation of values which, if they can endure the struggle with the tortuous and Germanicized English of the translation, cannot fail to clarifv their own thinking. The closeness with which the book is written and the complexity of the material discussed, in addition to the exacerbating English, render this book far from being easy reading. It is a book which demands slow and deliberate reading, and a continuous exercise of the reader's critical faculties. So read, it will greatly repav the energy expended. Having spent so much of his intellectual life in the study of pathological conditions of the nervous system in man Professor GOLDSTEIN makes man, and the pathological data relating to him with which he is best acquainted, the point of departure for his study of vital phenomena, of life. This is, of course, a most unusual procedure, and in fact constitutes an inversion of what is customarily received as the " best " procedure in such studies, namely, the study of " normal" processes in organisms ranging from the simplest to the most complex. This latter procedure is made the subject of a penetrating analysis and criticism by Professor GOLDSTEIN, in the course of which he convincingly justifies his own approach. Instead of attempting to lay the foundations of a science of life on the basis of knowledge derived from the study of isolated processes of animals, the simplest to the most complex, Professor GOLDSTEIN believes that methodologically a sounder approach is to begin with the study of the most complex in that creature which we know best. The obvious advantage attaching to such an approach is that since man is a much more knowable organism than any of the lower animals can ever be, without uncritically transferring the findings made in connexion with the one to the other, it is more likely that we will better understand the functioning of other organic forms from the vantage point of an understanding of the most knowable organism. There is a great deal to be said for such a viewpoint particularly when it is developed by so critical a thinker as Professor GOLDSTEIN, who is fully alive to the dangers both of an insidious anthropomorphism and a crass zoomorphism. The use of pathological phenomena as interpretative data Professor GOLDSTEIN justifies on the ground that such phenomena represent significant modifications of normal processes which are capable of yielding</page><page sequence="3">392 ISIS, XXXII, 2 greater insight into the processes of the organism than are normal phenomena. "There is greater revelation in pathological phenomena" (P. 9). The basic principle upon which Professor GOLDSTEIN takes his stand is that " We do not concede the existence of anything ' apart from ' or ' additional to,' but always regard the organism as a whole in which segregation of any sort is artificial, and in which every phenomenon is a manifestation of the whole." (p. 465). This is the principle of holism. " All creatures have a specific nature; all represent wholes having the character of an individuality. Therefore we can obtain insight in all living forms by one methodological principle-the holistic " (p. 476). Only by the study of the organism as a whole is it possible to understand the organism in terms of itself. The isolating partitive techniques of laboratory investigations yield a multitude of isolated facts which offer no clue to that which we directly experience in the living organism. We cannot, by breaking the organism into parts, obtain any knowledge of its intrinsic nature. The reflex, for example, can be understood as a manifestation of the whole, as a special condition during the manifesta- tion of the whole, but the whole can never be comprehended from the reflexes. One cannot understand the nature of a square from the fact that four equal sides are given; one can understand the nature of the sides rather from the whole of which they happen to be a part. Professor GOLDSTEIN is convinced that " a state of greater perfection can never be understood from that of less perfection, and that only the converse is possible" (p. 5I5). If one knew only of the apes one could neither envisage nor understand man, but knowing man we are able, to a certain limited extent, to understand the relationship of the apes to man. Fundamentally this whole-to-part reasoning has characterized much of biological thought, although we must agree with Professor GOLDSTEIN that in their concentration upon the part many biologists have lost sight of the whole, and even of the relationship of the part to the whole. Simple induction is not enough. It is the conception of the principle of evolution as a method which has led many investigators and theorists to the mistaken belief that their own method of investigation was an orthogenetic process leading from the simple to the complex. In reality their method has been chiefly historical, and has proceeded from the most complex, as a starting point, to the simpler, and from the simpler back again to the more complex. This is, of course, the essence of the comparative method, and is in line with Professor GOLDSTEIN's argument. Professor GOLDSTEIN'S criticism of the results obtained by the simplistic application of inductive methods in the fields of neurology, psvchiatry, psychology, psvcho-analysis, and general biology constitutes perhaps the</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 393 most important heuristically critical achievement relating to these fields to appear during this centurv. His attack upon manv of the classical and most fundamental concepts now forming an appreciable part of the structure of these fields, such as the reflex theory, the structure of the nervous system, cerebral localization and specificity, the theory of the anta- gonistic innervation of muscles, the concept of anxiety, the unconscious, consciousness, and much else, is not merely devastating, but highly constructive and clarifying. In short, we may fully subscribe to the concluding words of Professor KARL LASHLEY's Foreword " The work is of prime importance for all branches of natural science which are concerned with the correlation and integration of vital functions."
