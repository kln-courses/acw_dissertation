<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yohanan Muffs. Love and Joy: Law, Language and Religion in Ancient Israel. New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1992. xxvi, 240 pp. This book is really a collection of independent essays. Six of them have already appeared: "Who Will Stand in the Breach? A Study of Prophetic Intercession," "History of Mesopotamian Religion," "Abraham the Noble Warrior," "The Money Came to Me," and two essays on love and joy as metaphorical expressions. Two shorter essays are altogether new. "As a Cloak Clings to Its Owner: Aspects of Divine/Human Reciprocity" concerns the legal and mythic implications of clothing imagery in ancient Near Eastern material, the other is titled: "The Permitted and the Prohibited in Early Rabbinic Literature: The Root DRK, 'To be Empowered.' " To be brief, these essays represent the master-craftsmanship of a skillful artisan. A careful reading of this volume will yield untold riches in a variety of fields: comparative Semitic lexicography, ancient Near Eastern law, and the interplay of law and religion in biblical, Mesopotamian, and rabbinic cultures to name the most important. Many of the essays are written in a very dense style and will require at least a couple of readings to appreciate their finer points. Sometimes, when the writer begins to comment on a whole range of interesting but not always directly relevant matters, one fears that he has lost the main theme of the essay. Other times the footnotes seem to be written in the style of a precis of a future article. This can be taxing on the young reader, but never unrewarding. The first essay, on prophetic intercession, is the most exegetical and hence</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 239 the most significant theological section of the book. Its style is quite different from the remainder of the essays; it seems to have been composed as a lecture and not as a scholarly article. This is slightly disappointing, for one cannot help but think that the writer could have greatly extended the reach of this chapter by altering its form of presentation. The thesis of the essay is that the Israelite prophets had as one of their main responsibilities the task of reminding God of his characteristic quality of mercy. Muffs argues that much of the disturbingly anthropomorphic dimension of the portrayal of divine vengeance and anger can only be understood in juxtaposition to the prophetic responsibility to intercede and blunt this very verdict. Or, to put it another way, it is the Bible's choice to describe God's relationship to Israel in personalist terms that determines the range of emotion accorded to him in the Bible. The usage of this personalist metaphor virtually requires that God's anger be roused when his people act in willful defiance of his stated commands. Occasionally, though, God's anger seems to step beyond the reach of mere punishment and totters perilously close to pure vindictiveness. Yet, as Muffs so adroitly shows, the very descriptions that characterize God's anger in this all-too-human fashion are always set within the context of a prophetic dialogue, thus providing an occasion for a human response. More often than not, the intervention of the prophet is strong enough to alter the initial decree. The prophet then can be defined as that audacious individual who is called to stand in the breach which has opened between God and his people and to summon God back to his merciful ways. The personalism of the Bible, then, displays itself not only in anthropomorphic language about God's attributes but also in the very type of relationship God has with his chosen servants, the prophets. In this view, prophets who refuse to enter into a critical dialogue with God out of an apparent respect for the justice of his original verdict of condemnation are dismissed from their posts. Thus the case of Jonah. This essay is a marvelous mixture of careful readings of selected biblical texts with a really subtle grasp of the mythopoeic dimension of God's malleability in the face of authentic prayer. The type of work exemplified here is similar to that of M. Fishbane and J. Levenson, who also attempt to merge the concerns of a close reading with an eye toward the larger mythic/theological dimensions of the text. The book is also exemplary in the manner in which it utilizes Akkadian, Aramaic, and Rabbinic Hebrew in solving difficult problems in biblical lexicography. At several points in the essays Muffs also summarizes what he considers to be essential features of his own comparative method. These</page><page sequence="3">240 BOOK REVIEWS explicit methodological statements along with the numerous applied examples certainly demand a careful reading. In recent years it has become more common to speak of the limits of the comparative method, and no doubt these limits exist, but Muffs's own work will demonstrate how restricted our reading can become if the voluminous evidence from rabbinic and Akkadian sources is not used to cast light on our limited biblical material. Also helpful is Muffs's ability not to overstate what the evidence will allow. In "Abraham the Noble Warrior" he adduces a good deal of comparative evidence to show how a number of features of Genesis 14 can be better understood in the light of covenant texts from the second millennium. In the past this type of approach was used mainly for the purpose of showing the historical plausibility of the setting in which the stories of the patriarchs took shape (so, for example, in the work of W. F. Albright and E. A. Speiser). Muffs, though, being attentive to the critics of this approach (e.g., J. van Seters, T. L. Thompson), and knowledgeable that the many parallels between Genesis 14 and second-millennium sources, could just as well have come from first millennium material, will not be forced into dating the material where certainty is impossible. Instead Muffs is content to show how several features of this biblical text can be better understood when set over against a particular stream of Akkadian/Aramaic legal material. It should also be noted that Muffs does not simply adduce the parallels here, but suggests several possible historical means by which these legal phrases could have passed from one civilization to the other. The longest portion of the book comprises the last two essays, on the topic of love and joy as metaphors of willingness and spontaneity in ancient Near Eastern law codes and narratives. These essays are probably the best-known examples of Muffs's own work and so a detailed review is not so pressing. They follow directly from the work he did in his dissertation on the Elephantine papyri, though they extend these insights into a vast variety of sources. These essays show most clearly how legal terminology and mythic/narrative sensibility overlap. They should be read by anyone who is interested in the spirit of the biblical law codes and the impact that legal imagery has on narrative material both in the Bible itself as well as in the rabbinic writings.
