<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ultimate Meaning, Suffering, and God Marian F. Sia and Santiago Sia /Loyola Mary mount University I. The Search for Meaning Humans, it may be argued, have the distinction of being perhaps the only kind of creatures who can raise fundamental questions about existence. While requiring basic items such as food and drink in order to survive, humans nevertheless are often made aware that the fulfillment of human existence needs more than these.1 Unfortunately, the answer to the problem is rarely clear. What is less unclear is a certain uneasiness or even dissatisfaction with merely satisfying one's immediate needs.2 Hence, questions such as: what makes us truly human? is life worth living? is there a purpose to life? are asked. Humans, apparently unlike other living beings, can and sometimes do wonder about the significance of being alive and interacting with others. A specifically human concern is whether life itself has any ultimate meaning. It would be naive to think that we humans always ask these questions in such an explicit way. Nor do we address the issue of ultimate meaning with uniform concern and interest. Our list of priorities in life would hardly reveal such in-depth existential values. In fact, we generally set ourselves certain goals, strive after them, and, if we attain them, look for others.3 Nonetheless, the question as to whether life has any meaning at all is a human one not only because, as far as we know, humans alone are capable of reflecting on it, but also because every human being-although in most cases implicitly rather than explicitly?is confronted by it.4 As a matter of fact, we more or less presume the meaningfulness of life by carrying on with our daily routine. We assume that there is some sense to life by engaging in the various 1. Shakespeare expresses this weil when he makes Hamlet cry out: "What is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more." Hamlet, Act IV, Scene 4, lines 33-35. 2. Henry Vaughan's poem "Man" captures this sentiment. 3. Some, like Kai Nielsen, argue that there is no evidence that there is a purpose of life, but that we can fashion for ourselves purposes in life, e.g., freedom from pain and want, security and emotional peace, human love and companionship, creative employment and meaningful work. These can be sources of happiness and therefore provide some meaning to life. Cf. his Ethics Without God (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1973). This argument, however, fails to recognize that having only relative purposes in life is to give purpose to life. That is to say, there is a tacit acceptance of the ultimate significance of possessing a number of relative goals in life. 4. Of.

This is not to say that when queried we can always provide an adequate or enlightening reason. Yet the fact that we are actually carrying them out implies some confidence in the meaningfulness of our specific tasks and of life in general.5 II. The Challenge of Suffering Certain situations, however, appear to conflict with any presumption regarding the meaningfulness of life. Tragedies, suffering, and especially death make any claim that life has ultimate significance rather doubtful. The existence of evil has become a classic argument against those who uphold a theistic explanation of life. It gives credibility to atheism since God who is regarded by believers as the ultimate principle of meaningfulness seems incompetent to eradicate suffering.6 And yet not only do theists continue to believe in their God, but they have also developed arguments to resolve the contradictions in their beliefs.7 It has even been pointed out recently that we must hope that there is a God for only then can there be meaning to the suffering of the innocent.8 What is astounding are the testimonies of those who have suffered considerably and who continue to uphold their faith or who have even discovered God in their suffering.9 For them far from being the occasion when they turn their back on God, suffering becomes the vehicle that enabled them to know the kind of God on which they had always relied. We ought not to forget, however, that there is also absurdity in suffering. The sight of people in agony, the unexpected loss of a loved one, or the fate of a starving nation reminds us that suffering goes contrary to what we wish were true. We then realize that what is happening should not happen. Nor 5. The point we are making here is similar to the argument that transcendental Thomists put forward when they claim that every question implies some knowledge of the answer. Otherwise, the questioner would not have been able to raise the question in the first place. Questions are asked against a "background" or "horizon" of implicit knowledge rather than of ignorance. 6. Theists have felt particularly vulnerable on this point. Consequently, various theodicies have been developed. 7. According to John Bowker, in Christian tradition the reality of suffering has constantly attracted a theoretical and practical response. However, Jesus and Paul seemed to have been more concerned with dealing with the realities of suffering rather than with offering an explanation as to why suffering should exist. Later developments paid more attention to providing a theoretical explanation. Cf. John Bowker, Problems of Suffering in Religions of the World (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1970), 42-98. 8.

Comforting them by showing that others are worse off than they are can be more hurtful than helpful. It is also unfortunate when the victim is told to bear the burden patiently either because it is alleged to be a punishment from God or because there is a greater reward awaiting him or her after life. Such comments neglect to take into account that there is much undeserved misery in the world and that we cannot rule out the issue of injustice. Moreover, we should be particularly alert to any attempt to cover up the miserable plight of people and other creatures which are the consequence of the greed and malice of others. Violation of human rights, for instance, has to be checked. Perpetrators of policies that cripple others, individuals or nations, have to be made aware of their crime. For the kind of suffering that results from their actions cannot be justified. The challenge, therefore, to remove the causes of much of the suffering in today's world is as real as the need to face the threat that suffering brings to a meaningful existence. III. Our Concept of God The claim that suffering has been a route for some people to God together with the observation that we have the obligation to remove as much as possible its causes highlight a side to the problem of evil which does not often get much attention. Earlier on we noted that what has generally concerned theists and unbelievers alike is the threat presented by the reality of evil to the belief in an all-good and almighty God. It is regarded as a stumbling-block to faith and has therefore led to a denial of God's existence.10 But there is also a need to explore further our concepts of God, especially since God continues to be real to many victims of suffering and oppression.11 What kind of God can we still believe in when the fact of evil cannot be denied? In a sense David Hume had referred to this issue as a dilemma for theists.12 But Hume had also argued against the principle of causality on which the traditional proofs for the existence of God had been based. He 10. This is not to deny the importance and the difficulty of justifying the belief in God's existence. 11. This is certainly the more important issue in Latin America today. Cf. Victorio Araya, et al., The Idols of Death and the God of Life (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 1983), and Juan Segundo, Our Idea of God (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1974). Also, Philip Berry m an, The Religious Roots of Rebellion: Christians in the Central American Revolution (Philadelphia: SCM, 1984), 377f. 12. Hume insisted that the existence of evil does not justify the belief in an all-loving and all powerful God.</page><page sequence="4">28 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy pointed out that if the principle were valid, the kind of God that emerges is a rather undesirable one: imperfect or finite. Hume seemed to have been guilty of using a pre-conceived idea of God's nature which did not fit in with the reality of evil. It led him to conclude that theists needed to justify their belief in God's existence rather than their claims regarding the nature of their God. The author of the Book of Job had wrestled with this problem to a greater extent than Hume. He presents the character Job as starting out with certain presuppositions about the God of his tradition. But his experience of undeserved suffering made him not only doubt the truth of traditional claims but also articulate with more urgency and force a different question: who is this God he was dealing with? For Job God was real, but he needed to discover the character of this God. One interpretation of the answer to Job's question is that it was in the form of a revelation: the God he was involved with was a mysterious person whose ways are not our ways. The proper attitude towards this God can only be one of humility and faith. What calls for more attention here is not Job's conclusions but his question. Some will find Job's conclusions rather unsatisfactory. Can life really be meaningful from the theistic perspective if the only hope it offers is acceptance of the mysteriousness of God? Can we not say more about this God? What does the evidence of suffering tell us about God's nature? In wanting to pursue Job's, and to some extent Hume's, question, we are, of course, taking certain debatable issues for granted. Not only are we assuming that there is a God, but we are also presupposing that we can talk about God. We believe, however, that an investigation into our ideas of God is more basic and more urgent than the controversy regarding God's existence. Much atheism actually revolves around questionable concepts of God. The challenge confronting many of us today is to outgrow or overthrow these false notions of God.13 The presupposition that we can and ought to describe God's nature is a more delicate one. There are some who would view the task to be preposterous since it would be dragging God down to our level. Whatever we can say about God would be anthropomorphic. Others will argue that the finite nature of human language makes the exercise a futile one. While acknowledging these difficulties, we still think nonetheless that we do not have much choice. We do make attempts to describe God. Even the concern to preserve God's transcendence and otherness is one description of God. Or the appeal to revelation is itself an endeavor to say something about God. The limitations of human resources, however, should make us cautious about our claims about God. They will always be provisional and 13. See, for example, Antonio Perez-Esclar?n, Atheism and Liberation (Philadelphia: SCM, 1980).</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 14, No. 1, January 1992 29 subjective. This is why the pursuit of more valid statements about God is a continuous one.14 IV. God as Sympathizer But can the experience of suffering, our own or that of others, disclose anything about God? Its existence challenges us in many ways. One such challenge is that we make a practical response by identifying with the victims. Being united with them can be a healing process for both the comforter and the sufferer. It is surprising that many times tragedies do unite people and bring out the good in them. Even when their kind gesture does not always last, the instantaneous response of good-will has a way of easing the burden. When it is followed by practical measures, the relief can be more effective. There is much truth in the belief that much comfort is derived from the realization that one is not alone in one's distress. Psychologists tell us that the deepest need of a human person is the need to overcome separateness. The need is intensified in moments of misery. The lack of solidarity in affliction adds greatly to one's unfortunate situation whereas when others come to one's aid, the burden is less onerous. Because people can be touched, much good work occurs. If love means caring about what happens to others, then caring implies being affected by them. Our feelings for them motivate us to respond positively. Communities, whether primitive or sophisticated, have realized the value of putting people in touch with one another at times of misfortunes. For example, various rituals, religious or not, taught people to share with one another experiences of new life or death. As Rabbi Kushner explains, the Jewish custom of sitting shiva, the memorial week after a death, like the Christian wake or chapel visit, grows out of our need to share our fears and our grief. It reminds us in our moments of need that we are part of a community, that there are people who care about us.15 Knowing that others care, made explicit through rituals or concrete help or mere presence, can be therapeutic. All this is made possible because we can sympathize, that is, share the unpleasant feelings that others are experiencing and the pain that they are undergoing even if not always on the 14.

Hence, the more we have suffered, the more we can sense the agony of others and the more likely we are to help. If we put so much value on sympathetic compassion as a way of dealing with the suffering around us, could we also say that God ought to be conceived as capable of sharing in our sorrows?16 God in Christian tradition has been presented as a God of love (this is one of the reasons why different theodicies have arisen since an evil God does not have to be defended in the face of evil in the world). However, the interpretation of God, at least by some Western theists, tended to exclude sympathetic suffering in God. Anselm, for example, refers to God as "that than whom nothing greater can be conceived." Accordingly, God is described as just, truthful, blessed and "whatever it is better to be than not to be." Concluding that it is better for God to be compassionate and passionless, Anselm then considers how God can be both. He formulates the paradox in this way: For, if thou art passionless, thou dost not feel sympathy, thy heart is not wretched from sympathy for the wretched; but this is to be compassionate. But if thou art not compassionate, whence cometh so great consolation to the wretched?17 Anselm answers his own query by stating that God is compassionate in terms of our experience, but not so in terms of God's being. While we experience the effect of God's compassion, God does not. Commenting on this passage, Charles Hartshorne and William Reese write that Anselm's analogy with experience fails to illumine, in that he has merely shifted the difficulty, since the question of how God "beholds our wretchedness" has still to be faced. They ask: "How can a being know what wretchedness is if no shadow of suffering, disappointment, unfulfilled desire 16. Sympathy is to be distinguished from empathy. The latter means putting ourselves into the inner world of others, recognizing their needs without letting their suffering overwhelm us. In so distancing ourselves we are in a position to help. This distinction is often employed by some defenders of God's impassibility. God is said to empathize rather than sympathize with us. To claim that God also sympathizes with us is to bring God down to our level. We would argue, however, that empathy presupposes sympathy. Because God sympathizes with us, God must also be said to liberate us from all kinds of oppression. 17.

It is a mockery to claim that we feel the effects of God's compassion since the supreme effect of compassion is to give the awareness that someone really and literally responds to our feelings with sympathetic appreciation. Compassion implies that one is truly, and not merely apparently, moved by our plight. Another classical theist, von H?gel, also focuses on the question of God's sympathy. In his view, the correct intuition that God is sympathetic should not be confused with the claim that God suffers. Suffering, he maintains, is intrinsically evil. Although suffering cannot be regarded as identical to sin, he thinks that they are sufficiently alike for it to be exceedingly difficult to treat sin as intrinsically evil if suffering is not treated as evil at all. Accordingly, fundamental religious experience and apprehension do not impute the presence in God of any evil, be it sin or even only sorrow, whether actual or potential. How then can one explain God's sympathy for us? Von H?gel maintains that God's omniscience puts God in a unique position to reach the human heart and will directly. But since God is bodiless and spiritual, we cannot impute physical or psychical suffering to God. In short, von H?gel upholds God's unalloyed happiness. He describes God as "not a Sufferer, but indeed the Sympathizer, God Joy, the Ocean of Joy, our Home."19 Yet if compassion, i.e. sympathetic suffering, is a value that prompts us to alleviate the suffering of others, it is hard to see why, according to some Asian writers, ascribing it to God is seen as limiting God. But before turning to these Asian writers, let us note a point eloquently made by Rabbi Kushner: I don't know what it means for God to suffer. I don't believe that God is a person like me, with real eyes and real tearducts to cry and real nerve endings to feel pain. But I would like to think that 18. Charles Hartshorne and William L. Reese, Philosophers Speak of God (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953), Midway 12 Reprint, 103-106. Charles Hartshorne has been one of the leading and most articulate advocates of God's passibility. He has worked out an alternative concept of God which he calls "neo-classical" (since he formulated it in dialogue with classical theism) and "dipolar" (because God is presented in terms of polar contrasts, active-passive, absolute-relative, infinite-finite, etc.). For a systematic and detailed presentation of this concept, see S.

I would like to think that He is the source of my being able to feel sympathy and outrage, and that He and I are on the same side when we stand with the victim against those who would hurt him.20 Kushner believes that his offer of sympathy became acceptable when people realized that he, too, had suffered whereas as a young rabbi, healthy, gainfully employed, his efforts to aid people in sorrow were resisted. Now that he was really a brother in suffering, they were able to let him help them. There is a strong tendency in us to think that those who have had similar experiences are in a better position not only to understand us but also to offer help.21 Why then Is there a reluctance to extend that observation to our understanding of God's character?22 Kazoh Kitamori in his book The Theology of the Pain of God writes that there is something in Japanese culture that allows for a fuller understanding of divine suffering insofar as even common people are appreciative of tragic themes in their drama. For example, the idea of tsurasa is realized when one suffers and dies or makes his beloved son suffer and die for the sake of loving and making others live. Moreover, the impact of Buddhism on Japan (with its concern for alleviating human suffering) has led to an understanding of "the sickness of great mercy." Consequently, Kitamori's Japanese background has led him not only to affirm divine sympathy but also to talk of divine pain, different from human pain, but just as real. Divine pain, he says, Is God's response to human sin. Jung Young Lee, a Korean, maintains that the idea of a God who suffers is the logical conclusion of an Oriental metaphysics. In his God Suffers for Us, therefore, he develops the idea of divine empathy based on the / Chlng (Book of Changes). He writes that God does not merely feel with (sympathize) the human situation. God feels into (empathize) the human situation and actively participates in it. 20. Harold S. Kushner, When Bad Things, 92-93. 21. Doroth?e Soelle's remark is enlightening: "Gratuitous solidarity with the afflicted changes nothing; precise knowledge that such suffering could be avoided becomes our defense against addressing it. Only our own physical experience and our own experience of social helplessness and threat compel us to recognize the presence of affliction'." Suffering, 15. 22. Richard Swinburne argues that there is a logical connection between love, loss, and suffering. God, as a loving person, must experience suffering because of the sufferings of God's creatures. Cf. his The Problem of Evil," in Reason and Religion, edited by Stuart Brown (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1977), 81-102. This is a main tenet in process thought, some of its representatives being Charles Hartshorne, John Cobb, Schubert Ogden, Lewis Ford, David Griffin, and others.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 14, No. 1, January 1992 33 The relevant point here is that, since one valuable response that we make to the presence of suffering in others is to have sympathetic feelings towards them, then we ought to say that God, too, must be affected by all the suffering around us. If indeed we are to portray God as one of love, God must be said to be capable of identifying with our plight to the extent that God, too, suffers. This should not, however, be mistaken to mean that God suffers in exactly the way we do.23 After all, even our own sympathetic feelings vary in accordance with the kind of person that we are. God is affected in a way that corresponds to God's nature, as the worshipful reality.24 A possible objection here is that we seem to be implying that even God must accept the inevitableness of suffering. Surely God's perfection is being threatened. Is God not competent to abolish it in the first instance? Hence, we must show that God also actively liberates us from every kind of oppression. Another possible criticism is that, by conceiving God as affected by suffering, we are conceding that there is such a definite reality capable of making God suffer. This is an objection that requires a nuanced answer. There is no such thing as suffering itself as if it had an independent existence challenging God in the way some dualistic systems portray the reality of evil. It is people and other creatures who suffer (as well as rejoice). Insofar as we are real, we are capable of touching God in our sorrows and in our joys. V. God as Liberator Previously it was noted that much suffering is dehumanizing. To try to justify it is to turn a blind eye to the hurt and pain we experience and that can sometimes lead to what can only be described as an inhuman kind of existence. This is particularly true of the misery and the degradation of poverty. We may try to impart a theological, biblical, or spiritual meaning to it, yet we cannot escape the economics of it. Nor can we ignore its psychological consequences. Poverty is extreme need or destitution. It 23. In chapter 7 of his book, Divine impassibility, Richard Creel presents in summary form the reasons put forward by passibilists why God must be said to have feelings. His counterarguments, however, ignore the fact that God as divine being and therefore unique cannot be said to react in exactly the same way as we would. Creel brings up instances when suffering would not be an appropriate response and argues from these examples that being impassible is not being unloving, hie overlooks that it is not specific forms of sympathetic suffering that are at issue but simply being touched or moved. How God will be touched or moved will depend on God's nature. 24. Our understanding of God's nature as worshipful follows Hartshorne's. That is to say, only God is worthy of total devotion. This is what constitutes God's perfection. Cf. S. Sia, God in Process Thought, 35f.</page><page sequence="10">34 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy means the way of life of the slum-dwellers of Latin America or of the Philippines, of over-populated India, of the ghettos of America and elsewhere, of famine-stricken Ethiopia and Sudan. Poverty hurts and oppresses people because it deprives them of the necessities of life. It creates the gap between the rich, over-fed landlord and his hungry, grief-stricken tenant. It makes a parent worry over the next crumb for the family. It forces a man or woman to queue at employment agencies in spite of the very slim chance of getting a job. Poverty is what causes grim-faced children to peer into glass-paned restaurants to watch the more fortunate ones partake of life's bounties-as if the mere sight of food is enough to ease the hunger they feel. Poverty is certainly not a welcome word, and its effects are to be dreaded and avoided. Hence, it is crucial that we work towards the removal of the causes of this kind of suffering. We ought to use every resource at our disposal to transform the situation. In claiming that we must root out the causes of this kind of suffering whenever possible-as another practical response to the challenge of suffering-we are implying that God is not its cause. It is unfortunate when poor people are simply encouraged to "accept their poverty" as the lot assigned to them by God. This is really to ignore that often the real causes are the actions and policies of people. The most appropriate loving response then is to identify and remove these causes as part of our struggle to construct a just and fraternal society in which all-and not just the powerful few-can live in dignity and be masters of their own destinies. Third-world writers, for instance, are becoming increasingly conscious of the obstacles put forward by certain economic and social aspects of Western society to the complete fulfillment of their people as human beings. They are critical of the growing dehumanization brought about by structures which are in fact structures of domination. These structures may bring about an accelerated pace of development, but it benefits only a small minority. They speak therefore of the need to liberate those who are its victims, the oppressed majority.25 It is understandable that in these countries there is a conscious effort to respond to suffering in terms of "setting the poor free." Gustavo Gutierrez puts this point across: The poor person is the byproduct of the system in which we live and for which we are responsible. He is the oppressed, the exploited, the proletarian, the one deprived of the fruit of his labor and despoiled of being a person. For that reason the poverty of the 25.

The challenge to us all no matter where we are is "how to find a way of speaking about God that springs from the situation created by unjust poverty in which the great majority of the people live" and to find language that talks of hope which buoys up a people struggling for its liberation."27 Thus, the pressing issue regarding the problem of God is the struggle between the "idols of death" (often perpetrated in different and not necessarily explicit ways by those wishing to preserve the status quo) and "the God of Life". This is because to have faith in God as Liberator, who favors the poor and the oppressed and assists in their struggle, necessarily entails the repudiation and removal of false gods.28 The reality of poverty and oppression, it seems to us, demands that we go further than Kitamori's and Lee's answer to the question of how God liberates us from our suffering. For Kitamori, a recognition of the pain of God will overcome human pain. He writes: "When the pain of man becomes the symbol of the pain of God, man's pain is in turn healed. What heals our wounds is the love rooted in the pain of God."29 Lee holds that God overcomes our suffering through God's suffering. "Faith," he maintains, "emancipates us from suffering alone to be suffering with."30 There is a sense in which such an attitude to suffering can be liberating, particularly if it is beyond our reasonable control to prevent it. However, it could also lead to a kind of fatalism: suffering, is inevitable since it balances the good to produce harmony. It seems to us that to speak of God as Liberator, one who gives life and hope in the midst of suffering, is to recognize that a task lies ahead of us to change the situation whenever it cripples rather than frees people. It means that identifying with the victims of suffering does not mean inaction. Instead, it should spur us on to participate in God's work of liberating us from all kinds of oppression. How and to what extent will of course vary depending on our circumstances. 26.

As Gustavo Gutierrez expresses it, The problem of speaking correctly about God amidst unjust suffering is not limited to the case of Job, but is a challenge to every believer."31 We have suggested that if the way we humans deal with the reality of suffering is through compassion and liberation, then God must also be described as truly compassionate and liberating. Hartshorne's conceptuality, compared to Anselm's and von H?gel's, offers a more credible way of understanding God's compassion. A further consideration is to show how the same God can be said actively to liberate us from our suffering. We have suggested that it is with us that God works for our liberation.32 Our belief in a God of love implies our participation in God's act of transforming creation.33 31.
