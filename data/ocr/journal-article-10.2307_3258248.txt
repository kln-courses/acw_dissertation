<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORTS OF THE DEPARTMENTS American Paintings and Sculpture Among the most important additions to the collections were a head of Lillian Gish, by Isamu Noguchi, given by Miss Gish, and two oils by Georgia O'Keeffe, Clam Shell and Ranchos Church, presented by the artist. We were also given seven early American paint- ings by Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch, including The Falls of Niagara, by Edward Hicks, and a portrait of Mary Boti- can Lathrop, by John Durand. Through the bequest of Mary Fuller Wilson we received a portrait of Luman Reed, by Asher B. Durand. The purchase of First Defense of the Ameri- ca's Cup, by Samuel Coleman, enabled us to add a first-rate early American seascape to our collections. The Museum acquired by purchase William Harnett's famous trompe l'oeil still life Music and Good Luck, one of his finest pictures, and a large tondo by Joseph Stella-Coney Island, painted in I9I5. A catalogue of American sculpture has been compiled by Albert TenEyck Gardner, and is ready to go to press. Mr. Gardner and Stuart P. Feld are completing two fully illus- trated catalogues of American painting, cov- ering the works of artists born before I87I. This project will describe in detail some six hundred paintings and contain biographies of 250 American painters. Henry Geldzahler is preparing an exhibition catalogue of twenti- eth century American art. It is hoped that these works will appear to accompany a com- prehensive American exhibition planned for some time during the forthcoming World's Fair in New York. GIFTS RECEIVED Kate d'A.

ROBERT BEVERLY HALE, Curator American Wing It is hoped that special exhibitions will con- tinue to play an important part in the activi- ties and the confines of the American Wing. The scale and atmosphere of the galleries lend themselves to the periodic display of loan exhibitions of American decorative arts and pictures, which vary the fare for our more constant visitors and attract newcomers by their novelty. Two years ago an exhibition entitled Col- lecting Americana: I956-I96I was organized to show the variety and quality of objects acquired by the Museum through gifts and purchases. In 1962 The Anatomy of a Chair il- lustrated the regional characteristics of Queen Anne, Chippendale, Hepplewhite, and Shera- ton chairs made in this country's eighteenth century cabinetmaking centers. American Art from American Collections opened in six gal- leries of the Wing in March of this year; more than 250 pieces of furniture, silver, glass, por- celain, prints, water colors, and paintings were borrowed from sixty-four private collections throughout the country. The exhibition, spon- sored by The Friends of the American Wing, was not intended to be a definitive study of American arts: the objects, dating from the early eighteenth to the middle nineteenth centuries, were chosen on the basis of their beauty, rarity, and charm. They demonstrated the diversity and extraordinary quality of Americana that remains in private hands de- spite the continuing flow of objects of art into public institutions. The exhibition was accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue intended to document the objects for future students. During the year, the Wing has acquired some outstanding objects of art. Through the gift of Charles A. Poindexter, five New York Chippendale chairs, originally belonging to the Verplanck family, have rejoined their two mates, which have graced the Verplanck Room for many years. A Chinese export porcelain punch bowl, the gift of David Wagstaff, Jr., recreates, in its painted decoration, the hongs, or factories, of Canton from whence the goods of China were shipped to the Western market more than a century and a half ago. Among our most interesting purchases is a finely carved Queen Anne slipper chair, said to have been made for the Taft family of Brooklyn, which adds a unique touch to our collection of New York furniture. 58 William M.

JAMES BIDDLE, Curator Arms and Armor For the first time in many years there are no acquisitions to report, since no superlative examples of the art of the armorer were known to be available for purchase. The departmen- tal library was enriched by the gift of Helen S. Stone and Bromley S. Stone of the spe- cialized library of their uncle, the late George C. Stone, whose bequest of a remarkable col- lection of Oriental arms and armor was re- ceived by the Museum in I936. A small representative collection of Euro- pean and Oriental arms and armor was sent to the Roberson Memorial Center in Bing- hamton, New York for a long-term exhibition Side chair. American (New York), Chippendale style, I760-1765. Mahogany. Height 38% inches. Gift of Charles A. Poindexter, 62.250.I Slipper chair. American (New York), Queen Anne style, about 1745. Mahogany.

Helmut Nickel, Assistant Curator, repre- sented the Museum at the Third International Congress of Museums of Arms and Military History held in London in April. Extensive research work dealing with Mu- seum objects has been accomplished during the year. Considerable time has been devoted to the preparation of a catalogue of the col- lection of European armor, which is planned to be completed in two years. A comparative study is being made of the work of the ar- morers, etchers, gunmakers, bladesmiths, etc., who are represented in the Museum's collec- tions. Work is proceeding with the measure- ments of suits and elements of armor, which will provide useful information on the physi- cal stature of military leaders of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. A comparative study of the construction and characteristics of the Museum's comprehensive collection of Euro- pean and Oriental mail is also in progress. Steps have been taken to replace some of the disintegrating decorative silk flags in the Equestrian Court with rayon flags bearing the heraldic arms associated with some of our most important historical armor. Plans have been made for the Department Study Room, which will be activated when the study col- lection is moved to quarters near the armor galleries. LOANS ACCEPTED Renee Carhart Amory: Helmet (morion) of etched steel, about I575, Italian; combination ax and flintlock pistol, steel with stock of wood inlaid with bone and mother-of-pearl, xvII century, Ger- man; dagger (sword-breaker), steel, xvII century, German; dagger (katar), chiseled steel, xix cen- tury, East Indian. Alastair B. Martin: Miquelet pistol, dagger, and sword with accessories, metal parts of blued steel inlaid with arabesques in gold, all in box of Cir- cassian walnut inlaid with silver wire, xix century, Caucasian. STEPHEN V. GRANCSAY, Curator Auditorium Events The Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium was again filled to capacity for the concert and lecture series this year. The Musica Aeterna series, conducted by Frederic Waldman, which began in I957 with three concerts, has proved so popular that five concerts were given, each on a Saturday and Sunday night, and there were many standees even for the repeat per- formances. This coming year we shall offer nine programs on Saturday evenings, to be repeated on Sundays. There were more vo- cal concerts than in previous years; the high point of these was the joint performance by Maureen Forrester and Gerard Souzay of Hugo Wolf's Italienisches Liederbuch, which was called by The New York Times "one of the major musical events of the season." It is always difficult to make the same music interesting to all the children-of greatly varying ages-who come to our Children's Concerts, but Boris Goldovsky made opera so exciting that two of his programs were re- peated during the Christmas vacation. During the coming year he will give a similar program on the lives and works of great composers. For the first time in our lecture program, two staff members shared the stage during a series of five lectures. Margaretta Salinger, As- sociate Research Curator of European Paint- ings, discussed the paintings of five artists, while Robert Beverly Hale, Curator of Amer- ican Paintings and Sculpture, demonstrated, by making charcoal drawings, how the artists approached and solved certain technical prob- lems. In response to answers to a questionnaire, the lecture course Art for the Traveler was offered at 6 P.M. instead of the usual time of 8:30, thus permitting people to come directly to the Museum from work. Claude Marks's morning course, The Glories of the Medici, and Boris Goldovsky's evening course, The Opera, were so popular that priority numbers were distributed for seats not used by sub- scribers. As usual, the Museum held several concerts by foremost artists. It is always easy to draw large audiences for great names; what gives us especial pleasure is that these same audi- ences will come to hear unusual programs well performed. WILLIAM KOLODNEY, Consultant 6o</page><page sequence="5">The Costume Institute In every compilation of facts and figures, there is not only the tangible, concrete evi- dence of things accomplished, but the intan- gible achievements that cannot be translated into numbers. For example, in addition to fashion designers, students of merchandising and design, and others who use the Costume Institute regularly, there has been an increased use of the collections by designers for the theater and motion pictures, and by univer- sity students majoring in theatrical costume design. A day at the Costume Institute may find Katharine Hepburn, accompanied by her designer, poring over books and costumes for ideas for the motion picture Long Day's Jour- ney into Night; or Donald Brooks, with a dead- line to meet, feverishly finishing sketches to be sent to Vienna for The Cardinal; again, one may find Mary Martin, who is to play the lead in Jennie, discussing costumes with Irene Sharaff, the noted theatrical costume designer. Besides those living in New York and its environs, researchers have come from areas extending from New England to California, Canada to Florida, and, reaching across the ocean, from Finland, Denmark, and England. Among the numerous gifts of the past year are many examples of the rich artistry of Eastern craftsmanship, ranging from the Per- sian Gulf to the China Sea. Especially im- portant is a late eighteenth century man's choga, or coat, from Rajputana, North India, the gift of Mrs. Frederic James Dennis, said to have belonged to the Maharajah of Kapur- thala. It is of tobacco brown wool twill, with minutely embroidered borders and decorative medallions with hunting and garden scenes reminiscent of those found in miniature paint- ings. Other Oriental costumes include an In- dian woman's dress (kudti) of deep blue satin heavily embroidered in multicolored silks with mirror insets, and a Bokharan man's robe, or chalat, of ikat-striped silk. Both are part of a collection of twelve costumes given by Mr. and Mrs. Clarence S. Stein. A group of charm- ing and finely detailed embroideries of the eighteenth to twentieth centuries are in- cluded in a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Maxime L. Hermanos. In addition, there are some nineteenth cen- tury costumes presented by Mrs. Frederick Street Hoppin. They are of historical interest, having belonged to the family of William Warner Hoppin, a former governor of Rhode Island. A group of French dresses of about the same period, from the House of Depret, were presented by Elizabeth R. Hooker. They were purchased in Paris in i867 for the trousseau of the donor's mother, the former Grace Russell of New Britain, Connecticut. Among these is a bride's summer afternoon dress of white pifia cloth, satin-striped in violet, with a matching violet sash, and an elaborate gown of pale blue satin striped in undulating floral brocaded bands, worn by the donor's grand- mother, possibly as the mother of the bride. Three dresses that have a close Museum asso- ciation were presented by Mrs. W. Ogden Ross, whose great-grandfather was Heber R. Bishop, Sr., a Trustee and a Benefactor. The dresses were worn by his daughter, Mrs. James F. D. Lanier. The most outstanding of these, from the House of Jeanne Hallee of Paris, is a ballgown of I897, made of lustrous peach satin, embroidered in delicate floral bouquets and swags in point de chainette. Five daytime bustle dresses, the gift of Mrs. J. Randall Creel, are rich and handsome examples of late nineteenth century French and American fashions. They were worn by the donor's grandmother, Mrs. David Lyon Gardiner, of New York and Gardiner's Island. Additions to the contemporary collection include a child's pink velvet coat and match- ing hat, French, i930, gift of Mrs. Sheldon Whitehouse; a collection of gowns worn by Mrs. James Russell Lowell at the Coronation Ball of Queen Elizabeth II and at the Inau- gural Balls of President Dwight D. Eisen- hower and President John F. Kennedy. A wedding dress of elegant simplicity, with vo- luminous train, designed by Norman Norell, was presented by Mr. and Mrs. Peter L. Briger, the bride and groom. Other contem- porary costumes given by various donors, in- cluding Mrs. Charles B. Wrightsman, Mrs. Samuel I. Newhouse, Mrs. Albert Spalding, Young girl's robe and matching petticoat of self-patterned light blue ribbed silk, brocaded infloral and foliate motifs. French, Louis XV period, about I750. Purchase, Irene Lewisohn Bequest, CI 62.28 a, b 6i</page><page sequence="6">and Mrs. Samuel Dushkin, are designs from Count Sarmi for Elizabeth Arden, Sophie of Saks Fifth Avenue, Balenciaga, Dior, Bal- main, Callot Soeurs, Jeanne Lanvin, Lucille, and Fortuny. A complete list of donors of the numerous costume and library gifts appears on p. 86. Among the twenty-four costume accessions purchased with funds from the Irene Lewisohn Bequest are some splendid examples from the eighteenth century. One is a man's suit of the French Regency period, of delft blue uncut voided velvet. Another is a charming and ele- gant young girl's costume, Louis XV, about 1750, in mint condition. The gown has a matching petticoat, both richly brocaded in silver and gold metallic and polychrome silks. The Party of the Year, the Costume Insti- tute's annual benefit sponsored by the Cos- tume Institute Advisory Council, the fashion industry, and other friends of the Museum, was again a most gratifying success, netting the sum of $72,737 toward the goal of achiev- ing the new Costume Institute. Our thanks and appreciation go to all the committees for the unstinting contribution of their talents, to James S. Schoff, General Chairman, and to Melvin E. Dawley and Adam L. Gimbel, Co- Chairmen, for their dedicated leadership. We are looking forward to the entire recon- struction of the Costume Institute, designed in cooperation with the architect Edward D. Stone. A careful analysis of the collections is being made, and the patterns of past requests, activities, and services are being studied to help plan new exhibitions, lectures, publica- tions, and an expanded student program. POLAIRE WEISSMAN, Executive Director Drawings The acquisitions of the past year have made quite exceptional contributions to the range and quality of the Museum's collection of drawings. Our already impressive group of Italian drawings has been notably enriched by the purchase of a number of sheets of the first importance. A celebrated double-faced sheet of studies by Parmigianino for the deco- ration of the church of the Madonna della Steccata in Parma, a monumental red chalk figure drawing by Sebastiano del Piombo, two brilliant large brush drawings by Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, and three drawings by Annibale Carracci, all connected with impor- tant Roman commissions, require particular mention. The acquisition of a dashing and imaginative pen drawing of three witches around a caldron by Jacques de Gheyn II is a fine addition to our Netherlandish drawings. Our boxes of French drawings were notably enriched by a large black chalk study by Jacques Louis David for the Leonidas at Ther- mopylae in the Louvre, and our unique group of cubist drawings enlarged by the purchase of a powerful early portrait study of the actor Felix Barre by Jacques Villon. These drawings and a wide selection of other recent acquisitions-fifty-six in all-were exhibited in the first room of the Special Exhibition Galleries from March 13 through June 3, I963. Several of the sheets exhibited had drawings on both sides, and these were presented in double-faced frames to permit examination of both recto and verso. In all, the Department has acquired eighty- seven drawings in the past year: eleven by gift and bequest, seventy-six by purchase. These acquisitions cover all the major schools of European draughtsmanship. Friends of the Museum have again been generous, and par- ticular notice should be taken of Emanie Philips's gift of a Van Gogh water-color study of a zouave and of Mrs. William H. Osborn's gift of the remaining two-thirds interest in a fine Direr drawing. Drawings from the Museum's collections figured in two major exhibitions abroad this year. Three important drawings by Delacroix were lent to the Delacroix centenary exhibi- tion at the Louvre in Paris, and our Carpaccio drawing of a young cavalier went to the Carpaccio exhibition held in the Ducal Palace in Venice. Work has begun on a volume that will com- ment on and illustrate some one hundred of the major European drawings in the Metro- politan. This will replace the now unavailable 62 Jacques de Gheyn II (I565-1629), Dutch. Witches Around a Caldron. Pen and brown ink. 94 x I4 6 inches.

Following the pro- grams in October and November by Beatrice Farwell on The Painter's Illusion and by Stuart M. Shaw on The American House and Its Furnishings, single talks were given in De- cember by James Biddle of the American Wing and Caroline Karpinski from the Print Department. In January, Alexander Lieber and Henry Geldzahler, representing the Department of American Paintings and Sculpture, offered a series of four talks on the Background and Development of 20th Century Art. During the month of February, Angela C. Bowlin discussed Medieval Art in Miniature, drawing heavily on masterpieces of craftsmanship from The Cloisters and the Pierpont Morgan Li- brary. During March and April, Friday lec- tures were devoted to the popular Metropoli- tan Tours, which included both a series by regular staff lecturers and three programs by other speakers - The Old and New in Eastern France, by Merrill Lake; Egypt and the Sudan, by Virginia Burton of the Egyptian Department; and Outstanding English Fur- niture Abroad with Counterparts in the Met- ropolitan Museum, by James Parker of the Department of Western European Arts. Com- pleting the series in May, Blanche R. Brown gave four lectures on Travels in France. Exploring the World of Art, the Saturday subscription program for young people of high school age, opened in October with five lec- tures on nineteenth century painting by the Dean of Education and Beatrice Farwell. The response to the second series, on The Greeks and Their Art, by Blanche R. Brown and Stuart M. Shaw, was so enthusiastic that a similar program has been scheduled this fall for adults. Mr. Shaw has been interviewed on Channel 13 about his archaeological work on the island of Samothrace, where he has par- ticipated for the past thirteen summers in a series of expeditions run by the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. In addi- tion, Mr. Shaw, an architect, was responsible for the design and construction of the island's hotel and archaeological museum. The Sunday afternoon program of lectures by invited guests included talks by Helen Lowenthal and John Hayward of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Frank Brown from Yale, Whitney Stoddard from Williams College, John Golding of the Courtauld Institute in London, and other well-known scholars from various museums and universities in this coun- try and abroad. In collaboration with the Board of Edu- cation the Department continued its eight weekly programs in the fall and spring semes- ters for the city's public high schools, the program drawing altogether about three thou- sand students, with their teachers, into the Museum's auditorium and galleries. During the spring the usual Wednesday programs were offered on Mondays as well, to accom- 64</page><page sequence="9">modate additional students and provide more adequate staff guidance. From the Museum Training Program II given jointly by the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University and the Museum four graduate students were selected as Museum III fellows, each to serve for one semester as an apprentice in the department of his choice. Through this program the Institute and the Museum have established one of the principal training centers in the country for curators and conservators. Of the courses in the his- tory of art given by Columbia University after hours in the Museum, two were taught by members of the curatorial staff, Caroline Karpinski of the Print Department and Carl C. Dauterman from the Department of West- ern European Arts. THOMAS M. FOLDS, Dean Egyptian Art The past year saw the completion of the first major step toward the reconstruction of the Egyptian galleries and the reorganization and reinstallation of our collections. Early in the calendar year I962 the builders took posses- sion of all of the main-floor galleries in Wing E and the two southern galleries of Wing H, and the replacement of the ceilings and remodel- ing of the rooms themselves was begun and advanced with gratifying speed. In prepara- tion for the construction work the Depart- ment evacuated nine large rooms and stored their numerous and often massive contents in one of our larger northern galleries. At the same time the galleries unaffected, for the time being, by the work were rearranged so as to enable us to retain on exhibition as many as possible of the handsomer and more impor- tant objects from the galleries under construc- tion, including the famous and popular Meket- re models and some of our finer examples of Old and Middle Kingdom sculpture. Mean- while alteration and restudy of the scale model of our projected new galleries was continued throughout the year, resulting in a number of interesting and effective changes in the schemes originally adopted. The most important accession of the year is a standing statue representing an anony- mous official, whose tomb was located at Ge- belaw, a previously unrecorded site about thirty miles north of Luxor. It is nearly three feet high and is one of the few private statues of the Old Kingdom made of quartzite. The face shows a degree of characterization that is found in some Old Kingdom reliefs but is unexpected in so intractable a material as this, and the workmanship is of excellent quality in every respect. Several details, including a dis- tinct moustache, are preserved on the painted surface. Ernst E. Kofler of Lucerne has pre- sented us with two interesting, if fragmentary, limestone statuettes from the same site; in all three cases the figures are said to have been mounted on secondary wooden bases, which had disintegrated beyond salvage but evident- ly carried the names and titles of the deceased. The absence of such information increases the problem of dating, but from the style of his statue it seems probable that the official in question belongs to the Sixth Dynasty. Departmental editing has been completed on Hans Goedicke's Old Kingdom Reliefsfrom Lisht ("Publications of The Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art Egyptian Expedition," XX), and on two new picture books by Charlotte R. Clark, Egyptian Jewelry and The Crafts and Professions of the Ancient Egyptians. GIFTS RECEIVED Henry G.

HAYES, Curator European Paintings The most important event of the year for the Department of Paintings was the exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa -an event quite unlike anything that has happened in the history of the loans of paintings between countries. It is hoped, therefore, that an ac- count of some of the details of this exhibition may be of interest to our readers. The Museum was advised of the French Government's intention to exhibit the pic- ture here in the late fall as an essential part of its visit to the United States. Also, some time before the picture was sent, the Louvre gave the Museum specifications for humidity and temperature to be maintained in our galleries, based upon conditions in the Grande Galerie where the painting is usually hung. During the month preceding the visit, it proved pos- sible to meet these conditions in the large Medieval Sculpture Hall and to maintain them throughout the exhibition, within the limits requested. The Curator went to Washington on Mon- day, February 4, to collect the picture at the National Gallery. When it was taken off the wall there, its surface was carefully examined in collaboration with representatives of the Louvre and the National Gallery, and the warp of the panel measured. The picture was packed, out of its frame, in the specially con- structed, hermetically sealed metal case in which it had been brought from France. The frame in which the picture is shown at the Louvre, plus the velvet-covered outer frame specially made for the trip, traveled in a sepa- rate box. The truck made the trip under the guardianship of the Secret Service. After reaching the Museum, the painting was again examined, and a second measurement of the warp revealed that no changes had occurred during the trip. It was then installed in an air- conditioned vault, where it was kept under surveillance over closed-circuit television. On February 6 the picture was installed in the Medieval Sculpture Hall, in the door- way of the choir screen from the cathedral of Valladolid. A fireproof niche, protected be- hind by a bulletproof metal plate, was in- stalled in the opening, and the picture was hung against a background of the same mate- rial used behind the statues in the Medieval Hall, which harmonized in color with the red velvet outer frame. Instruments for the meas- urement of temperature and humidity were installed in the niche, and readings were taken daily. An iron railing kept spectators at a dis- tance of approximately eight feet from the picture. It was guarded twenty-four hours a day by Secret Servicemen, New York City detectives, and Museum personnel. The crowds that came to see the picture exceeded any that had been seen in the Mu- seum before, surpassing those who came just after the purchase of Rembrandt's Aristotle in November I96I. These visitors' enjoyment of the painting was apparent, and their pa- tience and enthusiasm can probably best be measured by the record of Lincoln's Birthday. On that holiday, the Museum did not open until I P.M. in the afternoon. It was a cold winter day, and all morning rain alternated with sleet. In spite of this, a crowd of more than four abreast, stretching over a city block, waited as long as three hours to get into the Museum to see the picture. One of the most satisfying results of the Mona Lisa's visit was the interest displayed in other parts of the Museum. A great num- ber, clearly not regular Museum visitors, took the occasion to see the Museum as a whole. The European paintings galleries were as full on weekdays as they usually are on weekends. The largest number were attracted to the parts of our collections where the quality is highest: to the impressionists and moderns - which are, of course, fashionable today - but also to the Dutch school (especially Rem- brandt), the early Flemish, the Spanish seven- teenth century, and the Italian eighteenth century. The gallery containing works of the 66 Pierre Bonnard (1867-1947), French. The Green Blouse, I924. Oil on canvas. 40 X 267 inches. The Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ittleson, Jr. Purchase Fund</page><page sequence="11">nineteenth century Salon painters was also consistently popular. The Italian fourteenth century and the Renaissance, in which we are weakest, did not have the same drawing power, which justifies the Museum's constant efforts to improve our representation in these schools. At the very time the Mona Lisa was on exhibition the Museum also received as a loan two beautiful and highly important Italian Renaissance paintings: Hercules and Antaeus, and Hercules and the Hydra by Antonio Pol- laiuolo. For many years they were treasures of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, but were stolen during the war by two German soldiers and then disappeared. They were recovered in California and were restored to the Delega- tion for Restitution of the Italian Govern- ment, represented by Rodolfo Siviero, Italian Minister for the Restitution of Art. They were shown in Washington and then brought to New York, where they were exhibited for three days. In the absence of newspaper pub- licity during the printers' strike, the Museum informed several colleges in the area that the pictures were here, and invited interested stu- dents to study them during their brief stay in New York. Both small panels are in remark- able condition, and the Department was hap- py to be able to examine them. Again, for the tenth consecutive year, the Department organized a summer loan exhibi- tion. This one contained 107 paintings, mostly by French impressionists and postimpression- ists, from twenty-five private collections, aug- mented by French nineteenth and twentieth century sculpture generously lent by Mrs. Stephen C. Clark. This brilliant array, which included paintings that had never been shown before in this city, again proved to be of the greatest interest to our public. Furthermore, last winter Mrs. Nate B. Spingold and Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ittleson, Jr. lent their superb collections of paintings for display. The Department has arranged an unusually large loan of sixty-two paintings to the Arkan- sas Art Center in Little Rock, Arkansas, a project sponsored by Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Rockefeller. Among the new accessions is the imposing Ecstasy of St. Francis by Tintoretto, given by Robert Lehman, which makes a most sig- nificant addition to our collection of Venetian painters. From the late sixteenth century also dates the stylish portrait of an elegant lady with a dog by the little-known Cremonese artist Bernardino Campi, given anonymously. Of great importance to the Museum's rich collection of impressionist and postimpression- ist paintings is the brilliant and luminous pic- ture The Green Blouse, by Pierre Bonnard, dating from his finest period, which was bought with funds generously provided by Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ittleson, Jr. The acquisition two years ago of our famous Aristotle by Rembrandt has initiated a more intensive study of the Museum's large number of works by this great master. The Museum's conservators have carefully examined most of his paintings in our collection, and in many cases, through cleaning, or simply by refresh- ing old varnish, have brought out their intrin- sic beauty with gratifying success. Among the pictures that have been restored and placed again on exhibition are The Auctioneer, Flora, and the Portrait of a Man from the Marquand Collection. Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer has also been cleaned, and found to be in an excellent state of preservation. When this program has been concluded, it is hoped that the results can be shown in a special exhibition. The conclusion in the near future of several laborious tasks will constitute major achieve- ments for the Department. One of these is the publication of the catalogue of French paint- ings of the nineteenth and twentieth centu- ries, now being edited. This thorough and scholarly publication will not only document one of the most important parts of the collec- tion, but will complete the survey of the Museum's French paintings from the fifteenth century to the present. The long-awaited in- stallation of air conditioning in the galleries will be a further and most important step to- ward the better maintenance and preservation of the paintings collections.

THEODORE ROUSSEAU, Curator Far Eastern Art Gifts from several friends of the Museum have been the chief additions to the Far Eastern collections this year. A standing figure of Bud- dha, of great beauty and dating from the Northern Ch'i period, is an anonymous gift in honor of the late A. Schoenlicht. This piece has long been well known to scholars and gives the Museum an example from a short dynasty hitherto sparsely represented. Tiny in comparison is a seated wood figure of Kuan Yin, given by R. Hatfield Ellsworth, which, aside from its quality, adds to the small number of dated wood statues. It is inscribed, on a paper found in the interior, the first day of the tenth moon of the seventeenth year of K'ang-hsi, or December 14, 1678. Edwin C. Vogel presented ten superb pieces of porcelain, all of the K'ang-hsi period, from his unique collection, on loan since I957 and a star attraction in our great ceramics collection. There came to the Museum this year from Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller the loan of a very famous and beautiful Chinese sculpture of the early T'ang period. It has been here before on loan, and was shown at the Interna- tional Exhibition of Chinese Art in London in I935, at which time it was part of the col- lection of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. Mrs. Rockefeller gave most of her Chinese sculp- ture to the Museum in I942. This loan is a very happy event for us and our visitors. A few notable purchases have been made. A fine figure of Vishnu in bronze from South India, early Chola period, was purchased from the gift fund for Asian art of John D. Rocke- feller III. Also from the same fund the Muse- um acquired a Japanese lacquered wood sculp- ture, the portrait of a Zen priest, done in the fourteenth century. This is the only known example outside Japan of the great tradition of portrait sculpture. A magnificent silk tap- estry imperial court robe and overcoat of the type of the Kuo Ch'in Wang robes were pur- chased. Kuo Ch'in Wang was the seventeenth son of the emperor K'ang-hsi and died in I738. The textiles from his tomb are a valu- able landmark in the history of Chinese tex- tiles. Vishnu.

One, a silk tapestry coat used for temple dances, a composite of an incompara- ble K'ang-hsi robe and fragments of tapestry and brocades of the period, has a design of dragons and clouds in vivid colors in a dazzle- ment against a gold background. The other, a very remarkable temple painting unusual in that it has three central figures (most Tibetan paintings have only one) is one of two such paintings thus far discovered. Another pur- chase is a seated terracotta Buddha on a lotus pedestal, of the sixteenth to seventeenth cen- tury, which comes from Nepal. The fifty-eight porcelains of the John D. Rockefeller, Jr., bequest that were shown in the Room of Recent Accessions from July to October I962 have been temporarily installed on the balcony of the Great Hall. New flooring is being constructed in the south galleries. After this is completed, a simi- lar reconstruction of the northern section will begin. The energies of the staff members are bent on plans for the reinstallation of the whole Far East Department.

ALAN PRIEST, Curator Greek and Roman Art The most important purchase of the year was a gold phiale, or libation bowl, of the third century B.C., published at length in the De- cember 1962 Bulletin. It is of Greek work- manship, but bears a Carthaginian inscription; there exist only a half dozen such bowls in this precious material. When the phiale was placed on exhibition, it was shown with other libation bowls in the collections of the Depart- ment in a variety of materials -gold, silver, bronze, tin, terracotta, and glass. To this ex- hibition Joseph V. Noble and Lawrence J. Majewski kindly lent libation bowls in their collections. Other important acquisitions in- clude a Chalcidian neck-amphora, here illus- trated for the first time, and an Attic aryballos (oil bottle), attributed to the Amasis painter, to be published later. Despite its very small size, the aryballos shows more than twenty- five human and divine figures, offering a fair cross-section of the painter's known repertory, and, in addition, two groups of lions and their prey, never before encountered in the work of this artist. The erection of the new Library necessi- tated the demolition of the small room adja- cent to the large Roman gallery on the main floor, which for over fifty years had housed the wall paintings from the cubiculum of a villa at Boscoreale. The wall paintings have been moved into a newly built room off the Great Hall, just in front of the entrance to the Roman Gallery. In the new setting the origi- nal architecture has been reproduced more faithfully; in addition, a Roman mosaic from a house in the vicinity of Prima Porta, given anonymously to the Museum in I945 but nev- er before shown, has been incorporated in the mosaic floor of the room. Much work has been done, both in con- servation and research, on the collections of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman bronzes. A choice selection of Greek and Roman glass, not shown since I949, has been put back on exhibition. The Department was honored with the vis- its of several distinguished scholars, including Bernard Ashmole of Oxford, who has been doing research on our marble sculptures; Hans- jorg Bloesch of Winterthur and Zurich, who has studied our vases for his comprehensive investigation of Attic shapes; and Pierre De- vambez of the Louvre, who studied our sculp- tures and bronzes in connection with publica- tion of his excavations in Greece and Turkey.

DIETRICH VON BOTHMER, Curator Junior Museum Archaeology-Exploring the Past, the Junior Museum's current exhibition, opened Sept- tember 23, i962 and will continue for several years. More than three hundred objects from eleven departments have been brought to- gether to illustrate this theme. It was chosen for its great fascination to children, as indi- cated by the questions they have most per- sistently asked over the years. The exhibition greatly stimulates interest in the study of his- tory and provides background for understand- ing the Museum's extensive collections of an- cient art. Dramatic display techniques include animated transparencies, photo murals, talk- ing labels, peephole viewers, a walk-in tomb in facsimile reproduction, and a push-button movie. A preview for Members' children and their parents took the form of an Open House on September 22. Guest archaeologists, film show- ings, souvenirs, and refreshments inspired by the subject all contributed to understanding and enjoyment of the new exhibition. For the first time a series of illustrated lec- tures, supplementing the special exhibition, was offered by subscription on Saturday af- ternoons in the Junior Museum Auditorium. Each lecture was given by a well-known ar- chaeologist who drew upon his own experi- ences in presenting a picture of recent dis- coveries in the field of his special interest. For the eighth season a series of unusual concerts for children was offered. The empha- sis in previous years has ranged from charac- teristics of different instruments, through mu- sical literature of specific periods, to programs of serious music selected and presented by eminent soloists and ensembles, particularly for children who were studying music. This year six operas were introduced, narrated by Boris Goldovsky. Mr. Goldovsky's ability to weave into the story fascinating details of his- tory, biography, and musical form made these programs singularly understandable and en- joyable to young audiences. Two loan exhibitions of children's paintings from abroad were shown in the Studio: Chil- dren's Paintings of Bible Stories, lent by the World Council of Christian Education, and Paintings by Boys of Southern Rhodesia, a new selection lent by Mrs. Harold Hochschild. During the remainder of the year changing exhibitions of the work of Members' children enrolled in the Saturday Studio Hours were presented. Three earlier exhibitions originally organ- ized by the Junior Museum for showing in the Studio completed two years of national circu- 72 A wall relief and a boat model excavated by the Museum's Egyptian expeditions illustrate life along the Nile 4,000 years ago.

These were Drawings and Paintings by European Children, Designs by Children of Ceylon, and Children to Chil- dren: An Exchange Exhibition from Italy. School appointments for the Archaeology program and for gallery guidance in the per- manent collections were booked to capacity throughout the year and many, many requests had to be turned down. During the exhibition of the Mona Lisa, when the Museum admitted school classes between 8:30 and 9:30 on week- day mornings, members of the Junior Muse- um staff, assisted by our Board of Education supervisor and teacher and a former staff member who volunteered to help, introduced 11,352 children in 315 groups to this famous picture. The Junior Museum, the New York Junior League, and the Board of Education jointly developed a new afternoon program for ele- mentary schools in New York City's Higher Horizons Program, a program designed to raise the sights of children from culturally deprived homes. The Junior Museum staff trained seventeen volunteers from the Junior League to conduct guided tours in the Ameri- can Wing and the Archaeology exhibition. The program has been working smoothly, and all concerned are enthusiastic about this co- operative method of meeting an educational need. LOUISE CONDIT, Assistant Dean in Charge The Library ART REFERENCE LIBRARY It is a pleasure to report that the construction of the Thomas J. Watson Library is progress- ing according to schedule. It is expected to be completed before the opening of the New York World's Fair in the spring of i964. The Library continues its excellent record of service despite temporary quarters on the ground floor. The decrease in space has not materially affected the use of the Library by the Museum staff and the public -scholars, graduate students, and other researchers. From July 1962 through June 1963, 17,285 readers requested 84,288 books and periodicals. This year 4,819 volumes, including 2,088 gifts, were added to the collection, showing an increase in acquisitions of 2,092 volumes, compared to the I96I-I962 figures. Since July I962 the Library catalogued 5,416 volumes, typed 24,643 cards, and filed 14,213 new cards in its catalogue. The staff displayed its versatility by assisting other de- partments of the Museum with translations of over eighty-five letters. Listed below are several of the outstanding gifts and purchases acquired by the Library. A complete list of donors will be found on pages 86-88. GIFTS RECEIVED Tsuyoshi Asano and Takatoshi Misugi: Old Chi- nese Art, ed. Takatoshi Misugi, I961. Cassa di Risparmio di Roma: Via del Corso, 961.

Josephi Smithii Angli per cognomina authorum dispositus, I755 (Special Li- brary Appropriation). PHOTOGRAPH AND SLIDE LIBRARY During the year 2,839 loans totaling I42,194 slides were made, compared to 2,479 loans consisting of I28,576 slides in the correspond- ing period last year. Not included in these circulation figures is a total of 18,183 slides consulted in the department. Staff and guest lecturers who participated in the Museum's programs borrowed 29,66I slides, and of this number 1,280 were specially purchased from the Lecture Series Fund. The number of slides 73</page><page sequence="18">catalogued and added to the collection during the year totaled 10,249. To make the slides in the collection more easily available to the increasing number of borrowers and to provide for the rapidly ex- panding files of 2 x 2 color slides, cabinets for housing an additional 20,000 slides were pur- chased. During the past few years special view- ing equipment for slides has been designed and built by Museum personnel to facilitate the study of new slides for addition to the col- lection and to expedite the choice of slides by the lecturers. A total of 70,069 reference pho- tographs were used for study purposes in an- swer to a total of 427 requests, of which 175 were from the Museum staff. Thirteen hun- dred and forty-three reference photographs were catalogued. Sales of I ,39 I black-and-white photograph- ic reproductions pertaining to the Museum's collections were made. Rentals of color trans- parencies of the Museum's collections to be used for publication purposes numbered 634, representing an increase of 234 over the pre- ceding year. Of the total number rented, 120 were made on special order, as compared with 72 during the last year. These figures indicate a steadily increasing demand for color repro- ductions of the Museum's objects for many types of books and periodicals. Only a partial number of additions to the Photograph and Slide Library can be cited here; a complete list of donors will be found on page 88. GIFTS RECEIVED William Keighley: 1,560 color slides of the archi- tecture, painting, sculpture, and mosaics from the Holy Land and Italy.

JAMES HUMPHRY III, Chief Librarian Medieval Art and The Cloisters THE MAIN BUILDING Among the Department's new acquisitions was a rare fourteenth century German wooden casket, of small size, its sides decorated with scenes of courtship. It is enlivened with rhymes that may be freely translated: The Man: A boon I seek With thee to speak. The Lady: Speak up, my boy I am not coy. He: I will be thine. She: Thy pledge is mine. He: In truth I woo; Thou wilt not rue. The back portrays a variety of the medieval game of quintain. To the group of early bronzes whose acqui- sition was announced in last year's Annual Report has been added a rare type of lamp, attributed to the fifth or sixth century from Syria. The shape of the lamp itself is conven- tional for the late Roman and Early Christian periods, but the handle is unusual in that it curls up into a series of fantastic spirals ending in canine heads and suggesting a pack of run- ning hounds. A welcome addition to the Museum's series 74 Lamp with handle terminating in knobs and canine finials. Byzan- tine, v-vi century. Bronze. Height 82 inches. Dodge Fund, 62.185</page><page sequence="19">of Byzantine steatites and related ivories is a set of small steatite plaques, showing Christ in Majesty surrounded by representations of the twelve Feasts of Our Lord and groups of ap- ostles, prophets, patriarchs, saints, and mar- tyrs. Datable in the late Byzantine period, they are in a rare state of preservation. Preliminary work for the catalogue of medi- eval sculpture was continued by the members of the Department. The Associate Curator completed his manuscript on French monu- mental entombments of the fifteenth and six- teenth centuries. George Szab6, formerly of the Hungarian National Museum and assigned to the Medi- eval Department as a Museum III fellow in the New York University training program, worked extensively on the bronze aquamanilia in the Museum and at The Cloisters and on other research projects. GIFT RECEIVED Anonymous: Plaque of applique figures with champleve enamel on copper-gilt, late xmii cen- tury, French (Limoges). PURCHASES Bronze metalwork: Oil lamp with handle formed of curling, antler-like projections terminating in knobs and canine finials, v-vi century, Byzantine (Dodge Fund). Bronze metalwork on iron core: Upper arm of cross, x century, Byzantine (Fletcher Fund). Steatite: 13 plaques representing Christ sur- rounded by the Twelve Feasts of Our Lord and other scenes, xIII or xiv century, Byzantine, (Fletcher Fund). Woodwork: Casket (Minnekastchen), poplar wood, end of the xiv century, Alsatian (Rogers Fund). WILLIAM H. FORSYTH, Associate Curator THE CLOISTERS The most exciting acquisition of the year and indeed one of the most important in the his- tory of The Cloisters is a Romanesque cross of walrus ivory, almost two feet tall, carved with extraordinary richness by an English artist for the abbey of Bury St. Edmunds in the second half of the twelfth century. The cross is so high in artistic quality, so ambitious in design, and so complex in a literary and theo- logical sense that it can be called one of the two or three greatest existing treasures of Ro- manesque ivory carving. Represented on the ends and in the central medallions are scenes from the Old and New Testaments and sym- bols of the Evangelists. In addition, the front is decorated with the branches representing the living wood of the Cross and the back with eighteen prophets who hold scrolls in- scribed with texts. These texts are taken, for the most part, from the Old Testament, and prophesy and extol the inevitability of the coming of Christ, his Passion and Resurrection. Another important acquisition of the Ro- manesque period was a complete sculptured marble doorway made in the last decades of the twelfth century for the church of San Leonardo al Frigido near Carrara, Italy. The portal, published several times as a work by the Tuscan sculptor Biduinus, has a handsome lintel representing the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem, and on one of the jambs a large figure of St. Leonard freeing a prisoner from his chains. Four late Gothic sculptures in wood were also purchased for the Cloisters collection: an imposing statue of St. Margaret, said to have been carved by the Austrian sculptor Michael Pacher for the Franciscan church in Salzburg; a delicately carved statue of Mary Magdalene by a sculptor related to the school of Veit Stoss; a magnificent and very appealing Virgin and Child with original paint and gilding, slightly over life-size, attributed to the Aus- trian sculptor Jacob Kaschauer; and an exqui- site small statuette of the Virgin and Child effortlessly supported by three kneeling angels with upswept wings and swirling drapery, richly gilded as if it were a work in pre- cious metals. For the winter months (December 14, I962 through March 17, I963) we were privileged to have on exhibition in the Treasury a selec- tion of over seventy manuscript pages from the private collection of the late Georges Wil- denstein. In spite of the New York newspaper blackout, the exhibition received enthusiastic notices in the press, even from as far away as Virgin and Child supported by three angels. German, late xv century. Linden wood, gilded and polychromed. Height 184 inches. The Cloisters Collection, 63. 7 75</page><page sequence="20">London. We are grateful for the opportunity to show to our public so many fine examples of a great art of the Middle Ages. The Christmas season was again made fes- tive by two memorable concerts of fifteenth century music by the New York Pro Musica Motet Choir under the direction of Noah Greenberg, supplemented by boy choristers from the Church of the Transfiguration. At the Garden Party for Members on June II, the wind ensemble of the New York Pro Mu- sica presented a delightful program of instru- mental music from one of the earliest printed collections of music, published in Venice in 1501. For the Garden Party we placed on exhi- bition for the first time the brilliant silver-gilt and enameled shrine announced in last year's Annual Report. The shrine, probably made by a goldsmith of Paris about I340-I350, is be- lieved to have belonged in the fourteenth cen- tury to Queen Elizabeth of Hungary. The Cloisters lent to the Tilmann Riemen- schneider exhibition at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh its fine small sculp- ture of Sts. Christopher, Eustace, and Eras- mus, three of the fourteen Helpers in Time of Need. The exhibition, organized by Justus Bier, Director of the North Carolina Museum and the foremost authority on Riemensch- neider, was widely acclaimed by the press and the public; Life magazine featured the Clois- ters group in their review of the exhibition, which included a double-page illustration in color of our three Helper saints. One of the most welcome events of I963 was the publication of the new edition of the Cloisters handbook, which has been in prepa- ration for several years. Since the last major revision in I95I, many works of art of the highest quality have been added to the collec- tion; these are described and illustrated in the new edition of the handbook. Among the new entries are the Fuentiduefia apse, the Tred6s and Berlanga frescoes, the Annunciation altar- piece by Robert Campin, the Hours of eanne d'Evreux, the Belles Heures of lean, duke of Berry, two thirteenth century sculptured angels in the style of Reims, and the tapestry called the Glorification of Charles VIII. Large sections of the earlier text have been revised, and many objects are illustrated from new photographs especially made for this purpose. GIFTS RECEIVED Mrs. William Bigelow Neergaard, in memory of her mother and grandmother: A gift of money for the Easter garden in the Saint-Guilhem Cloister. Andre Tressley: Corbel with crouching woman clutching her long hair, limestone, xII century, French.

FREEMAN, Curator Membership Although the building program reduced some of the Museum's services to the public, Mem- bership in the Museum continued to increase during the year, reaching a total of I9,453 Members as of June 30, I963. In mid-November Members were invited 76 St. Mary Magdalene. German, late xv century. Linden wood. Height 481 inches. The Cloisters Collec- tion, 63.13.1</page><page sequence="21">to view the various projects of the building program at a Special Members' Evening in the Museum. Over 4,000 Members came to study the exhibition Planning for the Future, to visit their favorite galleries and talk with the curatorial staff, and to have light refresh- ments in the restaurant. There were several showings of the film Art Heritage, in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, which A. Hyatt Mayor, Curator of Prints, introduced by giv- ing a brief history of the Museum. The re- sponse to the Museum's Open House was most enthusiastic, and it is hoped that such an event will become a tradition. In February, Members were invited to three evening viewings of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Over 15,000 Members came to view the painting, the largest preview audi- ence in the history of exhibitions at the Mu- seum. In March, an exhibition of unusual im- portance, American Art from American Col- lections, sponsored by The Friends of the American Wing, brought 4,271 Members to the opening. In connection with this exhibi- tion Charles F. Montgomery of the H. F. du Pont Museum, Winterthur, lectured on Collecting and Connoisseurship in American Arts to Members and their guests. During the fall a wide range of subjects was presented by eminent scholars at the after- noon invitation lectures for Members. James G. Van Derpool, Director of the Landmarks Preservation Commission of the City of New York, described the architecture of Manhat- tan from the seventeenth to the mid-nine- teenth century; Theodor H. Gaster, Professor of Religion, Columbia University, discussed folklore in the ancient world; Sterling A. Cal- lisen, President of Parsons School of Design, spoke on the aesthetics of archaeology; and Oleg Grabar of the University of Michigan lectured on medieval Jerusalem. This inter- esting variety was maintained in the spring lectures: Lionel Casson of New York Univer- sity described the ancient theaters of Greece and Rome; Clifford Musgrave, Director of the Royal Pavilion and Museums, Brighton, por- trayed the history of the Royal Pavilion; Horst W. Janson, Chairman of the Depart- ment of Fine Arts, New York University, lec- tured on the image of man in early Renais- sance sculpture; Brian A. Sparkes of the Uni- versity of Southampton, England, discussed humor in Greek art; Milton W. Brown of Brooklyn College recreated the period of the Armory Show; and John Jacobus from the University of California analyzed the most recent works of the architect Le Corbusier. The final invitation event, the annual Gar- den Party at The Cloisters in June, showed 3,280 Members and their guests a new acces- sion, a silver-gilt altarpiece of the fourteenth century. A special concert of fifteenth cen- tury music was presented by the Wind En- semble of the New York Pro Musica under the direction of Noah Greenberg. Children of Members enjoyed the many events planned for them, especially the pre- view in September of the Junior Museum's exhibition Archaeology - Exploring the Past. More than 1,500 children came to the party and thoroughly enjoyed meeting guest archae- ologists, seeing several films on archaeology, and exploring the exhibition. The very popu- lar Saturday Studio Hours for Members' chil- dren aged five to twelve were once again filled to capacity. In addition to the events especially for our Members, the subscription lectures, concerts, and children's activities discussed in the Audi- torium Events report continued to be enthus- iastically subscribed to by Museum Members. SUZANNE GAUTHIER, Assistant Manager Musical Instruments The Department, whose exhibition galleries were closed because of the rebuilding around the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, gave much time to preparing plans for a permanent display of a large part of the Crosby Brown Collection of musical instruments, which is to be exhibited in new galleries assigned to us for the future. The Curator, who received a research grant from the American Council of Learned Soci- eties, spent some time in European libraries 77</page><page sequence="22">and museums to continue research on Leo- nardo da Vinci as a musician. He was recently elected a member of the Raccolta Vinciana in Milan for his work in this field. In November, the Curator participated in a special meeting of the International Committee for Museums and Collections of Musical Instruments, which was held in Lisbon and sponsored by the Gul- benkian Foundation. The purpose of the meet- ing was to discuss international rules for the cataloguing, inventory, and preservation of musical instruments. The Department welcomed a number of distinguished scholars in the field of musicol- ogy and organology. We discussed with them the possibility of cooperation between Amer- ican and European museums for international exhibitions of musical instruments and chose a number of outstanding specimens from our collections to illustrate new standard Euro- pean publications. A large number of Euro- pean, Oriental, and American instruments were used for exemplification and illustration in the forthcoming section dealing with musi- cal instruments in the Enciclopedia Universale dell'Arte, being published simultaneously in New York and Rome. EMANUEL WINTERNITZ, Curator Near Eastern Art The Department received some important and interesting gifts, among them, through funds donated by H. Dunscombe Colt, a gold- handled bronze dagger, and, as the gift of Elsa Rabenou, a fine armlet of hairlike gold wire fastened to strips of gold decorated with granular work. These two objects are said to have come from a site in northwest Iran. An arabesque rug with the Doria coat of arms, given by Joseph V. McMullan, adds a histor- ical item to the rug collection. A gold cup decorated with deer in repousse from Gilan, northwest Iran, lent by Mr. and Mrs. Alastair B. Martin, and pottery lent by Norbert Schimmel increase the importance of a group of antiquities from this area that was placed on exhibition the previous year. Two loans, a gold epaulette with repousse de- coration, lent anonymously, and a part of a plaque of similar workmanship, lent by Joseph H. Hirshhorn, make our collection of objects from the Ziwiye treasure in Iran richer. An important purchase was a bronze helmet decorated in the front with the figure of Ea, god of the waters, flanked by two female dei- ties. On the top of the helmet is a bird, and, at the back, a hollow cone for the insertion of a plume, both of silver covered with gold. This helmet, along with our other objects found in the north of Iran, will be discussed in a forthcoming Bulletin article that will show the significance of these antiquities and the interesting light that they throw on Iranian history of the end of the second and the be- ginning of the first millennium B.C. Vaughn E. Crawford worked at the excava- tion in Hasanlu, Iran, in the summer of I962, and after his return to this country set forth again in the spring of I963 to work with the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. These excavations have added to the variety and importance of our collections. Two large galleries of the Islamic section were turned over to the builders; as much as possible has been put on the balcony of the Great Hall, and a few of the largest rugs were hung below. This eclipse is temporary, and the collection will eventually appear with en- hanced glory. Advantage was taken of the lack of space for display in our own Museum to lend an excellent collection of miniature paintings to an exhibition selected by Ernst J. Grube at the Cini Foundation in Venice and later at Asia House, New York. GIFTS RECEIVED Ben-Zion: Figurine, earthenware, i millennium B.C., Iranian (Amlash). Burton Y.

EXCAVATION From Nimrud, Iraq, in conjunction with the British School of Archaeology in Iraq: I I ivories and i additional objects of stone, shell, clay, and glass, all viII century B.C. CHARLES K. WILKINSON, Curator Prints The Print Department's exhibitions serve to mark the development of the collection and to furnish a background for other events in the Museum. The growth of the photograph collection suggested an exhibition of Paris un- der the Second Empire, which filled the lobby of the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium from September into the winter. Prints of various 79</page><page sequence="24">Rembrandt Harmensz. van Ryn (1606-1669), Dutch. Landscape with a Man Sketching, about 1645. Etching. 5? x 84 inches. Gift of Walter C. Baker, 62.664.1 kinds were grouped around photographs that Adolphe Braun took under the reign of Napo- leon III and Eugenie during the heaviest lux- uriance of crinolines and court balls. From October through January the Special Exhibi- tion galleries displayed the original drawings of many of the cartoons that appeared all over the world after the Museum purchased Rem- brandt's painting of Aristotle with the Bust of Homer. This series of caricatures was made into an exhibition called The Stone Guest by adding other prints and paintings in which statues affect people. In February this show gave way to one called The Tastes and Curiosities of a Curator, to give an idea of the amusement and passion that the first Curator of Prints, William M. Ivins, Jr., who died in 1961, had felt as he bought things for his own personal collection. The exhibition included quotations from his writings that revealed his pioneer taste and his force of intellect. June brought the still current exhibition of Man in the Air, organ- ized around a gift of ballooning prints from Paul Bird, Jr. These early prints of balloons and airplanes convey the wonder of drifting with the wind in silence, and the exhilaration of propelling oneself at will through the air. A complete list of donors to the Print De- partment appears on page 88. A.

The third edition, revised in col- laboration with Margaret B. Freeman, Cura- tor of The Cloisters, and the staff of The Cloisters and the Department of Medieval Art, is the Museum's most important publi- cation this year. This book has been a best seller since its first publication in I938, and has gone through two editions and several re- printings totaling more than 200,000 copies. The revised edition, the first in a dozen years, covers many important and popular works not previously included. The book has been redesigned, and for the first time in many years is available in a clothbound edition as well as in paperback. A fully illustrated catalogue, American Art from American Collections, by James Biddle, Curator of the American Wing, was published in connection with the exhibition sponsored by The Friends of the American Wing. It was available in no less than three editions, bound in paper, cloth, and leather; the last of these, a limited edition, was completely subscribed before publication, thanks to our loyal Mem- bers, and the other two were all but sold out by the exhibition's end. Also very popular was another publication issued in connection with an exhibition: the illustrated essay by Theodore Rousseau, Curator of European Paintings, concerning the Mona Lisa, of which over Ioo,ooo copies were sold. A contribution was made to an important Bernard Toro (1672-173 ), French. Design for a title page. Pen and wash. 17 x 94 inches. Purchase, Anne and Carl Stern Gift, 62.590 8i</page><page sequence="26">international series, the Corpus Vasorum Anti- quorum, through the publication of a fasci- cule by Dietrich von Bothmer, Curator of Greek and Roman Art, cataloguing fifty-six black-figured amphorae in the Museum's col- lection of Greek vases. The Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum is, as the name implies, the stan- dard publication of ancient vases; the format -a bound descriptive text combined with loose individual plates-makes possible the direct comparison of works in collections all over the world. Among the other publications of the year were the Bulletin, a number of concert pro- grams and pamphlets (including a handsome new descriptive brochure for The Cloisters), and two school sets: The Byzantine World, by Emma N. Papert, and Greek Mythology, by Roberta Paine. Next year we hope to issue a fairly wide variety of publications. Among them will be catalogues of two important pri- vate collections: the sixth and final volume of the Catalogue of the Irwin Untermyer Col- lection, by Yvonne Hackenbroch, largely de- voted to English silver, and the first volume of the catalogue of the Charles B. Wrightsman collection of French decorative arts of the eighteenth century, by Francis Watson, Keep- er of the Wallace Collection. We plan also to bring out two more sections of the "Guide to the Collections," Prints and Western European Arts; a large, illustrated book reproducing our finest European drawings; a gift book of Aesop's fables, illustrated with prints from the fifteenth century to the present; and a com- plete catalogue of our collection of American sculpture. The publication of this catalogue, plus two catalogues of our American paintings to be issued in the future, has been made pos- sible by a grant, received this year, from the Ford Foundation. GRAY WILLIAMS, JR., Editor Registrar and Catalogue Thirteen hundred and seventy-six new objects were accessioned as additions to the Museum's collections (not including tens of thousands of acquisitions by the Print Department, the Li- brary, and the Costume Institute); 3,627 ob- jects were catalogued. Additions and changes made to the records for objects already cata- logued numbered 2,319, reflecting the new publications and scholarship based on the Museum's works of art. Eleven hundred and fifty-eight entries were made for the Subject Index of Western Art. Twenty-eight objects were de-accessioned. Fourteen hundred and seventy-eight objects were deposited by 386 owners as possible gifts, loans, or purchases, at the request of the curators. Five hundred and eighty-seven were returned to 203 owners. The Museum borrowed 3,889 objects. These included 3,320 for exhibition with the Muse- um's own collections, and were received from 64 lenders. Five hundred and sixty-nine ob- jects were borrowed from 77 owners for special exhibitions. Sixty-one of these objects were for the exhibition Archaeology -Exploring the Past, in the Junior Museum. Nine hundred and eighteen objects from the Museum's col- lections were crated or packed for shipment or prepared for delivery by truck as loans to I o other institutions. IRMA B. WILKINSON, Registrar and Supervisor of the Catalogue Western European Arts The event of the year for this Department was the exhibition of the Mona Lisa in the Medieval Sculpture Hall, which forced us to modify drastically the displays in our sur- rounding galleries in order to accommodate the vast throngs that came to see Leonardo's painting. The rooms leading to the Park en- trance, for example, were entirely emptied of their contents. Following Mona Lisa's de- parture, various improvements in arrange- ment were made during the reinstallation. This was another year of numerous acqui- sitions by gift and purchase. Among the mem- orable gifts were the service of rare black Sevres porcelain, from Lewis Einstein, a mas- 82</page><page sequence="27">terfully modeled Goat with Suckling Kid in white Meissen porcelain, from Mrs. Jean Mauze; and a table top -a richly colorful mo- saic of rare marbles - the product of the grand- ducal Opificio delle Pietre Dure in Florence, from Mr. and Mrs. Francis J. Trecker. Ber- nard Baruch and Irwin Untermyer have again given fine objects of English furniture, and welcome examples of French furniture have come from the Mary Ann Payne Foundation. The Museum has also received as the bequest of Aimee L. May a fascinating collection of more than 250 miniature objects executed in silver. Our principal purchases this year have been sculpture. A fine bronze statuette of the Risen Christ by Giovanni Bologna and Antonio Su- sini, which may be dated I596, was the central figure in a series of eleven pieces made to deco- rate the ciborium of the high altar of the Cer- tosa at Galluzzo outside Florence. It now ap- propriately rejoins two of these figures - Sts. John and Matthew-that the Museum pur- chased in 1957. Other purchases were a superb life-size polychrome wood sculpture of John the Baptist, by the great seventeenth century Spanish master Juan Martinez Montafins, and two dramatic life-size painted and gilded wood figures of Sts. Matthew and Mark, by, or in the style of, the late seventeenth century Aus- trian master Meinrad Guggenbichler. The Museum was also able to acquire at auction in London a remarkable English silver-gilt toilet service from the reign of Charles II. It con- sists of nineteen pieces, each engraved with sprightly scenes in the then novel chinoiserie style. Important loans have come from Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. Wrightsman, R. Thornton Wilson-who added three examples to the notable group of ceramics already donated or lent by him-and Renee Carhart Amory. The special loan exhibition of the art of Carl Faberge, which opened two years ago, continues to attract an admiring public. Sev- eral objects were added to this display by the anonymous lender of the collection during the course of the past year. Work on preparing a guide for this depart- ment has now been completed. Edith A. Standen has written the text, and it is ex- pected to appear during the course of the year. Plans for the installation of the Velez Blanco patio, bequeathed by George Blumenthal, have been a major preoccupation of the De- partment. At the same time plans were made for a gallery adjoining the patio, which will be devoted to Spanish art, and for a series of galleries for the arts of the Italian Renaissance to be located in the area that will become va- cant when the Photograph and Slide Library moves to its new quarters.
