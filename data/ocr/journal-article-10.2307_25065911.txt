Patterns of polyploid evolution in the taxonomically controversial Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata groups were inferred genetically by analyzing 399 individuals from 177 localities for (1) four polymorphic plastid regions yielding aggregate haplotypes and (2) nuclear ribosomal ITS al?ele frequencies. Concordance between patterns observed in distributions of plastid haplotypes and ITS al?eles renders ancestral polymorphism an unlikely cause of genetic variation in diploids and allopolyploids. Combining the degree of concerted evolution in ITS al?eles (thought to reflect gene conversion) with inferred parentage provides support for a quadripartite classification of western European allopolyploid dactylorchids according to their respective parentage and relative dates of origin. The older allotetraploids that generally exhibit only one parental ITS al?ele can be divided into those derived via hybridization between the divergent complexes we now call D. incarnata s.l. and D.fuchsii (e.g., D. majalis) and those derived via hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and IX maculata (e.g., D. elata). Similarly, the younger allotetraploids that maintain evidence of both parental ITS al?eles can be divided into those derived from hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and D.fuchsii, or perhaps in some cases a diploid species resembling D. saccifera (e.g., D. praetermissa, D. purpurella, D. traunsteineri s.l, D. b?ltica), and those derived from hybridization between the D. incarnata s.l. and D. maculata groups (e.g., D. occidentalis, D. sphagnicola). Older allotetraploids are inferred to have passed through glacially induced mi gration bottlenecks in southern Eurasia, whereas at least some younger allotetraploids now occupying northern Europe are inferred to have originated post-glacially and remain sympatric with their parents, a scenario that is largely in agreement with the morphology and ecology of these allotetraploids. ITS conversion is in most cases biased toward the maternal parent, eventually obscuring evidence of the original allopolyploidization event because plastid haplotypes also reflect the maternal contribution. Gene flow appears unexpectedly low among allotetraploids relative to diploids, whereas several mechanisms may assist the gene flow observed across ploidy levels. There is good concordance between (1) the genetically delimited species that are required to accurately represent the inferred evolutionary events and processes and (2) morphologically based species recognized in certain moderately conservative morphological classifications previously proposed for the genus. Further research will seek to improve sampling, especially in eastern Eurasia, and to develop more sensitive markers for distinguishing different lineages within (1) the remarkably genetically uniform D. incarnata group (diploids) and (2) locally differentiated populations of (in some cases unnamed) allotetraploids.

Dactylorhiza Necker ex Nevsky (1937) is a genus of terrestrial orchids with a circumboreal to warm-temperate distribution and centres of diversity in Europe and the Near East. Tax onomy of these dactylorchids is widely considered to have been complicated by relatively great morphological variability within species and high frequency of hybrid ization between species. Recent opinions expressed on the total number of species occurring in Europe, North 1185</page><page sequence="2">Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 Africa/Macaronesia and the Near East range from six (Sundermann, 1980) to 61 (Delforge, 2005), whereas Averyanov (1990) estimated the number of species at 75 world-wide. The mean number of species recognized in published studies has increased progressively through time (reviewed by Pedersen, 1998) and is epitomized by the jump from 49 to 61 species between the first and third editions of Delforge (1993, 2005). Refining, with justification, the taxonomy of the genus has become increasingly important because many putative Dactylorhiza species are declining and others have probably always been endangered narrow endemics. Reconciling morphologically and genetically circum scribed entities (recognized at whatever taxonomic level) is a necessary pre-requisite for a meaningful taxonomic hierarchy, which in turn is needed to accurately character ize their biogeography, ecology and conservation status. It is therefore cause for concern that Bateman &amp; al. (2003: 22) concluded that "For the present (and despite consid erable research effort), Dactylorhiza remains perhaps the most tantalizing of the dominantly European clades of Orchidinae, its phylogenetic history obscured partly by a combination of iterative hybridization and chromosomal instability, and partly by suboptimal species delimitation and misidentifications of chosen study organisms." Many of the European dactylorchids belong to the D. incarnatalmaculata polyploid complex, as defined by Hedr?n (2001a, 2002), which is best viewed as consisting of three groups of species: D. incarnata s.l, D. maculata s.l, and allotetraploids formed by crosses between species of the first two complexes (Table 1). Dactylorhiza incarnata s.l. is an aggregate of diploid taxa (eight or more named taxa, depending on the author) that is morphologically variable but genetically homogenous according to data from isozymes (Hedr?n, 1996) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs; Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001). Dactylorhiza euxina, endemic to the Near East, is a close relative of D. incarnata, albeit clearly distinct (Bateman, 2001; Hedr?n, 2001b; Bateman &amp; al, 2003), which is also involved in allopolyploidization (Hedr?n, 2001b). These species are hereafter termed the D. incarnata group. Dactylorhiza maculata s.l. (hereafter termed the D. maculata group) is a heterogeneous set of diploid (D. fuchsii, D. saccifera) and tetraploid (D. maculata) species that are more readily distinguished in peripheral portions of their respective ranges (e.g., Heslop-Harrison, 1951; Dufr?ne &amp; al, 1991; Bateman &amp; Denholm, 2003). For example, in the British Isles, D. fuchsii and D. maculata are easily separated using floral and vegetative characters and have distinct ecological preferences: the former grows on alkaline to neutral soils that vary from unusually dry habitats to marshland, whereas the latter is an acid-heath specialist. In contrast, in Germany, Austria and eastern France some taxonomists wholly reject the distinction between D. fuchsii and D. maculata (e.g., Baumann &amp; K?nkele, 1988), whereas others identify as D. maculata plants that grow in habitats that in the British Isles would be occupied strictly by D. fuchsii. Hybridization, result ing in the reputedly near-sterile triploid D. xtransiens, occurs occasionally, especially where the two taxa have been brought into unusually close proximity, often by anthropogenic habitat disturbance (Bateman &amp; Haggar, in press). The importance of polyploidy. ? Dactylorhiza maculata has long been viewed as an autotetraploid deriv ative of the diploid D. fuchsii (e.g., Heslop-Harrison, 1951, 1954), a view more recently given credence by their simi lar allozyme profiles (Hedr?n, 1996). Nonetheless, nuclear Table 1. General taxonomy and distribution of Western European species of Dactylorhiza discussed in this paper.

Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza ribosomal spacer DNA sequences (ITS nrDNA: Pridgeon &amp; al, 1997; Bateman &amp; al, 2003), AFLPs (Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001) and nuclear chalcone synthetase (Inda &amp; al, submitted) clearly distinguish between these two taxa, indicating that they are better viewed as independent ev olutionary units. Dactylorhiza maculata is more closely related to other, more clearly distinct diploids, such as D. foliosa (from Madeira) than it is to D. fuchsii (Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001; Bateman &amp; al, 2003; Inda &amp; al, submitted). Moreover, this relationship is reinforced by genetic data obtained in this study, which allowed us to distinguish easily between allopolyploids parented by the diploid D. fuchsii from rarer allopolyploids such as D. sphagnicola (Hedr?n, 2003) and certain populations in northern Russia (Shipunov &amp; al, 2004) that were parented by the tetraploid D. maculata s.str. Hence, D. maculata s.str. and D. fuchsii are here treated as separate species, although rank is a matter of choice and some of us (MH) would prefer to rec ognise these as subspecies because of the evidence found in this and other studies that they often hybridize to such an extent that distinguishing them becomes difficult. Allotetraploid taxa possess a mixture of charac ters derived from members of the D. maculata and D. incarnata groups and are typically referred to as the D. majalis aggregate (sensu latissimo). Although alloz ymes (McLeod, 1995; Hedr?n, 1996, 2001b) and AFLPs (Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001) confirmed their hybrid origin(s), neither technique identified precisely the parental lineages involved in polyploid formation. Multiple origins of allo tetraploids have long been suspected (Heslop-Harrison, 1954,1968). More recently, they have been demonstrated for some taxa in Sweden using allozymes (Hedr?n, 1996) and PCR-RFLPs (Hedr?n, 1996,2003; Devos &amp; al, 2003) in European Russia by combining ITS sequences with plastid and nuclear microsatellites (Shipunov &amp; al, 2004), and by conventional and landmark-based morphometrics (Shipunov &amp; Bateman, 2005). However, to obtain a more complete picture, these intentionally parochial integrated studies need to be expanded to a Europe-wide scale. Relevance of plastid microsatellite and ITS sequences. ? Repeating units of short DNA motifs termed microsatellites are abundant in the plastid genome of higher plants (e.g., Powell &amp; al, 1995). Their variability makes them useful markers to study patterns of diversity within and between closely related species (Powell &amp; al, 1995; Provan &amp; al, 2001), particularly with respect to biogeography. They have already demonstrated their usefulness in genetic studies of orchids (Fay &amp; Cowan, 2001; Cozzolino &amp; al, 2003a, b; Forrest &amp; al, 2004; Shipunov &amp; al, 2004). Furthermore, they are easy to develop and can be used on degraded DNA, such as that typically extracted from herbarium specimens (Fay &amp; Cowan, 2001). In orchids and most other angiosperms, the plastid genome is exclusively maternally inherited (Corriveau &amp; Coleman, 1988), so these markers have the potential to identify the maternal parents of hybrids and thus to indicate the direction of the crosses between the D. incarnata and D. maculata groups that underpin allopolyploid events. They can also provide information on identity and geographical origin of maternal parents and number of times allotetraploid lineages of similar parentage have succeeded in becoming established. The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA have been widely used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships because of their variability and ease of amplification with nearly universal primers (cf. Baldwin &amp; al, 1995). They have also proved useful in the detection of hybrids because for a period following the hybridization event hybrids are likely to display both parental al?eles; examples include Paeonia (Paeoniaceae: Sang &amp; al, 1995), Miscanthus (Poaceae: Hodkinson &amp; al, 2002) and Anacamptis s.l. (Orchidaceae: Bateman &amp; Hollingsworth, 2004). However, this region can undergo concerted evolution (Hillis &amp; Dixon, 1991), resulting in loss of one parental al?ele from taxa of hybrid origin (Wendel &amp; al, 1995; Alvarez &amp; Wendel, 2003; Chase &amp; al, 2003). Previous molecular phylogenetic studies indicated that this phenomenon occurs in Dactylorhiza; only a single ITS al?ele was recovered by PCR from taxa known to be allotetraploids (Pridgeon &amp; al, 1997; Bateman &amp; al, 2003). Considering that ITS sequences from D. incarnata, D. fuchsii, D. saccifera and D. maculata differ by both sub stitution and length polymorphisms (Bateman &amp; al, 2003), more detailed study could distinguish relative contributions of putative parents to at least some allotetraploids. Important contrasts have been observed among groups of flowering plants in patterns of ITS evolution. For instance, loss of one parental al?ele occurred in poly ploids estimated to have formed about 100 years ago in Cardamine (Brassicaceae: Franzke &amp; Mummenhoff, 1999), whereas both parental types have been maintained in older, putatively Plio-Pleistocene allotetraploids of Amelanchier (Rosaceae: Campbell &amp; al, 1997) und Pae onia (Paeoniaceae: Sang &amp; al, 1995). Concerted evolution of ITS is consistently biased towards one parent in some cases (e.g., in Cardamine: Franzke &amp; Mummenhoff, 1999), whereas in others it can convert in opposite directions in different allotetraploids formed within the same genus (e.g., Gossypium: Wendel &amp; al, 1995; Nicotiana: Chase &amp; al, 2003; Clarkson &amp; al, 2004, 2005). Fortunately, comparison of patterns derived from ITS sequences with those derived from plastid microsatellites can reveal such biases. In this study, we use these two categories of marker to study a large number of Dacty lorhiza accessions sampled across a wide geographical area. Sampling was designed to determine whether we can discriminate among putative species in the D. maculata group, explore the extent to which they hybridize and 1187</page><page sequence="4">Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 identify which of them has hybridized with a member of the D. incarnata group during formation of each identi fiable allotetraploid. Additional goals were to investigate possible multiple origins of particular allotetraploid taxa and determine which of the two species was the maternal parent of each allotetraploid lineage. We also explored patterns of gene conversion in ITS nrDNA and assessed the degree to which it can provide a relative time frame for dating formation of these allotetraploid lineages. | MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling and DNA extraction. ? A total of 399 accessions was analyzed, representing 177 localities and 44 named taxa, together sampled widely across the range of genus Dactylorhiza (Electronic supplement). Many of the populations were analyzed for more than one acces sion, particularly if suspected hybrids were observed in the field. Vouchers for many of the accessions consist of pickled flowers (most deposited in the Herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew). Samples of Gymnadenia s.l. (including Nigritella), which is the undoubted sister genus of Dactylorhiza, and Pseudorchis, which is a mem ber of the Platanthera clade that is sister to Dactylorhiza plus Gymnadenia (Pridgeon &amp; al, 1997; Bateman &amp; al, 2003, 2006), constituted outgroups in the phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences. DNA was extracted from leaves or, more often, flow ers using a 2x CTAB extraction protocol (Doyle &amp; Doyle, 1987), but with some modifications. Although most DNA extractions were taken from either fresh or silica gel-dried materials (Chase &amp; Hills, 1991), a few herbarium speci mens up to 100 years old were also used. Most DNAs were further cleaned on a caesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradient (1.55 g ml-1) or with QIAquick columns (Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, West Sussex, U.K., following the manufac turer's protocol for PCR reactions), although some were simply precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 0.25x TE buffer without further cleaning. Plastid microsatellites. ? We first examined seven plastid regions in search of length variation (e.g., mic rosatellites or larger insertions/deletions) by sequencing these from a carefully selected reference set of species that included D. fuchsii, D. maculata and D. incarnata. This permitted us to select for further study four length variable sites in three regions: the trnL intron, the in tergenic spacer (IGS) between trnL and trnF, and the spacer between trnS and trnG. We then developed new primers that closely flanked the length-variable regions producing fragments less than 250 base-pairs (bp) in length. For sequencing, the PCR mix included 45 pL of 1.5 mM MgCl2 Reddy PCR Master Mix 1.1X (ABgene Ltd, Epsom, Surrey, U.K.), 2 pL of 25 mM MgCl2,1 pL of 0.4% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.5 pL of each primer (100 ng/pL), and 2 pL of template DNA. The trnL intron and the trnL-trnF IGS were amplified using the primers c/d and e/f of Taberlet &amp; al. (1991), whereas the trnS-trnG IGS was amplified using the primers of Hamilton (1999). The following PCR program was used: 4 min at 94?C, 28 cycles of 1 min at 94?C, 1 min at 48?C and 1 min at 72?C, with a final extension of 5 min at 72?C. PCR products were purified using QIAquick columns (Qiagen Ltd) following the manufacturer's protocols. Both strands were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator 3.0 (Applied Biosystems Inc., ABI, Warrington, Cheshire, U.K.), and cycle sequencing products were run on an ABI 3100 Prism genetic analyzer, all following the manufac turer's protocols. Sequences were edited in Sequence Navigator and assembled in Autoassembler (both ABI). Alignments were performed manually in PAUP* 4.01M0 (Swofford, 2001), following the recommended procedures of Kelchner (2000). The four length-variable plastid regions are either short, tandem, mixed-base repeats (two) or microsatellites (two with homopolymer repeats). More closely spaced primers were then designed to amplify these four regions: Dact Msl, Dact Ms2 (both in the trnS-trnG IGS), Orchl (trnL-F IGS) and Dact Msf (trnL intron; all in Table 2). One of each pair of primers was labelled with a fluores cent dye. The four length-variable plastid fragments were then amplified cheaply and efficiently in a single 10 pL PCR reaction; fragments were separated on an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer, and the length of each amplified frag ment was determined with Genescan 3.1 and Genotyper version 2.0 (ABI). Each reaction contained 9.2 pL 2.5 mM MgCl2 PCR Master Mix (ABgene), 0.2 pL of 0.4% BSA, 0.1 pL of each of the eight primers (100 ng/pL), and 0.4 pL of template DNA. The program used was 4 min at 94?C, 26 cycles of 30 s at 94?C, 1 min at 55?C, and 1 min at 72?C, with a final elongation of 10 min at 72?C. The four target microsatellites were then combined to define a number of plastid haplotypes. A minimum spanning tree was drawn by hand to summarize the relationships between the haplotypes found in the D. maculata group; no variation was discovered in the D. incarnata group, but this haplotype is so divergent from the others that it was excluded from the minimum spanning tree. nrDNA markers. ? First, the entire ITS region (ITS1 spacer plus 5.8S rDNA gene plus ITS2 spacer) was amplified using the primers 17SE and 26SE (Sun &amp; al, 1994). Each 50 pL volume PCR reaction comprised 45 pL of 1.5 mM MgCl2 Reddy PCR Master Mix 1.1X (ABgene), 1 pL of 0.4% BSA, 1 pL of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), 0.8 pL of ddH20,0.6 pL of each primer (100 ng/pL), and 1 pL of template DNA. The program used was: 2 min at 94?C, 26 cycles of 1 min at 94?C, 1 min at 52?C, and 1 min 30 s at 72?C, with a final extension of 5 min at 1188</page><page sequence="5">TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 Pillon &amp; al.

Sequencing procedures and sequence analysis were identical to those applied to the plastid regions, except for the addition of DMSO to the former (to reduce the effects of paired-stem formation on strand extension). Cloning using standard recombinant DNA techniques was required for ITS whenever direct sequencing re vealed heterogeneity ascribed to the presence of multiple al?eles. Although several thousand copies of nrDNA ITS are present in each individual dactylorchid, we will nonetheless employ the term al?ele in its broadest sense to describe each characteristic, collective nrDNA sequence (i.e., individual repeats are most unlikely to be identical, so this term is used to refer to the consensus sequence). To establish the relationships of each al?ele, phylogenetic analysis was performed in PAUP*4.01blO using maximum parsimony; heuristic searches employed 200 replicates of random taxon entry order with tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) swapping, and no tree limit per replicate. These complete ITS sequences were submitted to GenBank (DQ022863toDQ022894). Length variation was observed in the alignment; moreover, some of the underlying insertions/deletions (indels) clearly distinguished among D. incarnata, D. fuchsii, D. saccifera and D. maculata. In our second phase of analysis, we therefore designed primers to amplify two short, length-variable fragments that taken together would be diagnostic of the al?eles present in each acces sion analyzed (Table 3). These markers are expected to be codominant (unless gene conversion is complete) and thus are useful for determining the parental taxa involved in hybridization. The two polymorphic fragments in the ITS regions were amplified in a single tube. The PCR reaction contained 18 pL of 1.5 mM MgCl2 PCR Master Mix (ABgene), 0.4 pL of 0.4% BSA, 0.4 pL of DMSO, 0.32 pL of H20,0.24 pL of each of the four primers (100 ng/pL), and 0.4 pL template DNA. The PCR program followed that for the plastid regions but with an annealing temperature of 52?C. As in the plastid analysis, ITS frag ments were run on a 3100 genetic analyzer, and fragment lengths for each accession were determined using Gene scan 3.1 and Genotyper 2.0. When multiple al?eles were found in a single accession, their relative proportions were estimated using the signal strength (peak height) on the original electropherograms. Although we recognize that these proportions are not rigorously defined, exact ratios are highly influenced by gene conversion and so are not relevant to our conclusions. However, the fact that the ratios observed are not consistent with expected simple ratios demonstrates that conversion has occurred. | RESULTS Plastid haplotypes. ? The four plastid regions were successfully amplified in all samples, including several herbarium samples collected up to 100 years ago. Only the two longer (approximately 220 bp) microsatellites, Dact Msl and Dact Ms2, failed to amplify from most DNAs extracted from herbarium specimens. Full data for the plastid microsatellites and ITS markers are presented in the Electronic supplement. When analyzed in combination, the four plastid frag ments defined 34 haplotypes. All species of the D. mac ulata s.l. group are characterized by a unique deletion in the trnL-trnF1GS; consequently, the Dact Msf fragment is 4 bp shorter than that of any other Dactylorhiza species. Haplotypes recorded in the D. incarnata group differ so much from those of other Dactylorhiza species that it is difficult to assess how they are related to those recovered from the D. maculata group. The D. incarnata group has been shown to be distantly related within Dactylorhiza to the D. maculata group in analyses of both ITS and plas tid DNA data (Pridgeon &amp; al, 1997; Pillon &amp; al, 2006). Hence, they are omitted from the minimum spanning tree 1189</page><page sequence="6">Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification o? Dactylorhiza TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 Table 3.

When we were assigning individual plants to a particular haplotype, we did not initially characterize them according to which species they had originally been assigned. Nonetheless, it soon became clear that most haplotypes could readily be ascribed to a particular species epithet. Diploids and autopolyploids. Haplotype A occurred in most accessions o? D.fuchsii throughout its range, in cluding the anthocyanin-deficient D. fuchsii var. okellyi from the western seaboard of Ireland and the anthocyanin rich D. fuchsii var. cornubiensis from Cornwall (south western England; cf. Bateman &amp; Denholm, 1989). In contrast, our sole accession of a similar anthocyanin-rich form from the western seaboard of Scotland, D. fuchsii var. hebridensis, contained the B haplotype. This is the most common haplotype in D. maculata s.str, including putative varieties ericetorum from the British Isles and is l?ndica from Iceland. Haplotypes of the B group all differ from the A haplotype by a 4 bp insertion in the Dact Msl fragment. Several other haplotypes (F, M, N, T) derived from the B haplotype were also found inD. maculata. The N haplotype is of particular interest as it was also found in D.fuchsii in many parts of its range (occurring in 14 out of the 108 samples ofD.fuchsii examined). The N haplo type differs from the B haplotype by only a single change and from the A haplotype by two changes. Among rarer haplotypes, only the two samples of D. maculata from Ireland had the M haplotype; only our single accession from Portugal, D. maculata var. caramulensis, had the P haplotype, and just one accession of D. maculata from Sweden yielded the X haplotype (Fig. 1). In a few cases, plants initially identified as D. fuchsii on morphological criteria were shown to contain not the characteristic A haplotype but rather the B haplotype, more typical of D. maculata, and vice versa. 1190</page><page sequence="7">TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification o? Dactylorhiza Dactylorhiza saccifera, a diploid long considered on morphological grounds to be closely related to D. fuchsii (cf. Landwehr, 1977), frequently contained the A haplotype typical ofD.fuchsii. This was particularly true of samples from Croatia, where the two species are known to form intermediates, and Turkey. However, many accessions of D. saccifera contained one of the rarer haplotypes, G and W, which were not found in any other diploids and thus are probably more characteristic of this species. One accession of D. saccifera from Croatia had the E haplotype characteristic of D. incarnata (see below). Although the C haplotype differs only by a single base in one of the microsatellite markers (homopolymer; Dact Ms2) from the A haplotype, it was never found in D.fuchsii. However, the C haplotype was found in a single Greek individual of D. saccifera, the only putatively diploid accession to exhibit this haplotype. Otherwise, the C haplotype was found only in allotetraploids, predominating in some populations (see below and Electronic supplement). In contrast with the Dactylorhiza maculata group, the diploid D. incarnata group maintained its already well established record for genetic homogeneity (cf. Hedr?n, 1996; Bateman, 2001; Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001; Bateman &amp; al, 2003). Although our 55 accessions of the D. incarnata group encompassed six putative taxa and a wide geo graphical range, almost all yielded the characteristic E haplotype. The notable exception was D. euxina from the X--O-P D-Q Fig. 1. Minimum spanning tree showing the relationships of the plastid haplotypes of the Dactylorhiza maculata group. All lines indicate single-step transitions. A is the most common haplotype in the diploid species D. fuchsii, whereas B is most common in the autotetraploid D. macu lata. Haplotype C was found only once in a diploid (a sin gle accession of D. saccifera), but it is common in several allotetraploids. Near East, which had haplotypes K and Y, most similar to haplotype E of D. incarnata. Diploid species phyloge netically interpolated between the D. incarnata and D. maculata groups (Bateman &amp; al, 2003), such as D. (for merly Coeloglossum) viridis, D. aristata, D. sambucina an4 D. romana, maintain distinct (and, in some cases, diverse) haplotypes. Allopolyploids. Allotetraploids yielded ten haplo types, of which the most common, A, B and C, occupy central positions in the minimum spanning tree of hap lotypes derived from the maculata group (Fig. 1). These haplotypes allow division of allotetraploids into two major categories that largely correspond to groups of morpho logically defined taxa: (1) The Dactylorhiza majalis group has predominantly the A (fuchsii-de?ved) and C haplotypes. It includes ac cessions from several morphologically defined species groups?the majalis group (also including D. alpestris and probably D. pratermissa), the traunsteineri group (also including lapponica), the purpurella group (also including D. cambrensis)?as well as the more geograph ically isolated D. b?ltica (southeastern Baltic region and northwestern Russia) and D. nieschalkiorum (Turkey). Except for one accession of D. saccifera from Greece, the C haplotype was found only in some of the taxa in this category of allotetraploids: it was present in the majority of accessions of D. majalis (16 of 25 samples), D. alpestris (4 of 6) and/), traunsteineri (20 of 32). The C haplotype was rarely found in D. praetermissa (only 4 of 19) and never in D. purpurella (20). A geographical split was evident within D. lapponica', the single British sample had the C haplotype, whereas the three Swedish accessions had the A haplotype typical of D. fuchsii. The N haplotype, which occurred in a minority of populations of both D. maculata and D. fuchsii, was also found in three accessions of D. majalis from two populations in France, located close to populations of D. fuchsii that also contained this unusual haplotype. (2) The Dactylorhiza elata group predominantly ex hibits the maculata B or similar haplotypes. The group is geographically disparate, including not only the wide spread western Mediterranean D. elata but also the Irish endemic D. occidentalis (incorporating D. kerryensis) and the northwest European D. sphagnicola. Western European D. elata reliably has the B haplotype, whereas most North African accessions yielded either the O or Z haplotypes. The similar X haplotype was found in one unnamed allotetraploid putatively locally synthesized in Sweden (M. Hedr?n, unpublished data); otherwise it was found only in a single accession of D. maculata, also from Sweden. The plastid haplotypes were sufficiently discrimina ting to allow "forensic horticulture" in the Dactylorhiza elata group.

These plants are most likely hybrids between D. elata and D. foliosa that were created in cultivation. Several other samples of unknown origin collected in gardens, such as the misnamed D.

Many putatively diploid samples yielded two, or even three, ITS al?eles. Although presence of three al?eles in a diploid appears unintuitive, theoretically it could occur if conversion had not yet reached completion when a plant crossed with another plant that possessed yet another al?ele. Less surprisingly, some of the allotetraploids were able to maintain three or occasionally four ITS al?eles. We assigned an approximate ratio (1:1, 1:2 or 1:3) to accessions maintaining two or 1193</page><page sequence="10">Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 more high-frequency al?eles (Fig. 4). In addition, we noted cases when only a trace of an al?ele was present, defining a minor al?ele as one at least three times less frequent than the most abundant major al?ele present. No PCR bias was observed when we performed amplifications of the ITS fragments on samples of known ratios (i.e., when we used a mixture of the entire ITS regions previously cloned as template DNA; data not shown). We estimate from the above mixing experiments that we can begin to detect the presence of a minor al?ele at a frequency some where between 5% and 10%. However, because the al?eles overlap in their respective fragment-length patterns, in some cases it was not possible to exclude the presence of a small amount of one additive type. For instance, when the 72 + 75 bp and 70 + 80 bp fragment pairs were both found in a single accession, we could not wholly reject the potential presence of a small proportion of the mutually overlapping 75 + 80 bp pattern. Most accessions of D. fuchsii had either al?ele V or Illb or both, whereas most accessions of D. maculata had the I al?ele (Fig. 3). In most D. maculata var. isl?ndica accessions examined (4 out of 5), we found evidence for fuchsii ITS al?eles as well as the typical maculata al?ele I. Al?ele VI was found in most samples o?D. saccifera, but in many it was mixed with al?ele V or al?ele Illb, indicating a close relationship with D. fuchsii. The Xa al?ele was found in all samples of D. incarnata s.l, rarely associated with the VIIIc al?ele, whereas the similar Xb al?ele was found in the closely related D. euxina. maculata incarnata occidentalis sphagnicola elata Fig. 4. Examples of traces obtained with one ITS fragment (Dmac). The autotetraploid Dactylorhiza maculata gen erally displays a 72-bp long fragment and the diploid D. incarnata an 80-bp long fragment. Dactylorhiza occiden talis (Ireland), D. sphagnicola (northwestern Europe) and D. elata (southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa) are all allotetraploids formed by hybridization between D. maculata (the maternal parent) and D. incarnata. Both parental al?eles are present in both D. occidentalis and D. sphagnicola, but the maternal al?ele is dominant in the former and the paternal al?ele is dominant in the latter. In contrast, the paternal al?ele has been lost from D. elata. A A A A A Allotetraploids. In allotetraploids, several patterns of ITS al?eles were observed. Overall, they either possessed between one and three al?eles of the D. maculata group plus that of the D. incarnata group or they maintained al?eles of only one of these two parental groups; in most cases it was the D. incarnata group that was not rep resented. Fig. 5 shows the geographical distribution of allotetraploids displaying ITS types from either one or both parental lineages. This demonstrates that complete loss of one parental al?ele is more common in North Africa and southern Europe, particularly in the characteristic allotetraploids of these regions, D. elata and D. majalis s.str. Al?eles I, III and V of the D. maculata group were all frequent in the allotetraploids, whereas al?ele VI char acteristic of D. saccifera was rare. Among allotetraploids, ITS al?eles mirrored the plastid haplotypes in revealing structured patterns that corresponded well with groups of named taxa: (1) Members of the Dactylorhiza majalis group (char acterized by fuchsii plastid haplotypes) had predominantly the fuchsii al?eles V or Illb, but degrees of evidence of the presumed incarnata parent varied both between and within species. Some D. alpestris possessed only the two fuchsii al?eles, V and Illb, whereas in others these were balanced by equal copy frequencies of incarnata al?ele Xa. The single sample of D. b?ltica had only the fuchsii al?ele V. Most of the 25 D. majalis samples had fuchsii V and Illb al?eles, only one exhibiting a trace of the incar nata Xa al?ele. The four specimens of D. lapponica had predominantly the fuchsii al?ele V, but the three accessions from Sweden also exhibited a trace of the incarnata Xa al?ele. The closely related/), traunsteineri was especially heterogeneous. A few individuals had predominantly in carnata Xa al?eles (some also possessed the incarnata haplotype E), and only five accessions lacked any trace of incarnata Xa; nonetheless, in most individuals the fuch sii al?eles V and Illb were dominant. Another variable tetraploid, D. praetermissa, was distinguished mainly by the presence in half the accessions of the saccifera al?ele VI, which ranged in frequency from dominance in two accessions, to presence as just a trace in four. Otherwise, this species contained a mix of the two fuchsii al?eles (V and Illb) and occasionally the incarnata al?ele Xa, although this was rarely equal or dominant. Dactylorhiza purpurellalcambrensis combined the incarnata Xa al ?ele with the fuchsii V al?ele, the former always with at least comparable frequency with the latter. Shifting the geographic focus to Turkey, our limited samples of both D. urvilleana and D. nieschalkiorum exhibited only the fuchsii Illb al?ele. (2) Members of the Dactylorhiza elata group (char acterized by maculata B or related plastid haplotypes) had dominantly maculata al?eles (I, or more rarely its variant, IV). The notable exception was D. sphagnicola, 1194</page><page sequence="11">TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza which dominantly had the incarnata al?ele Xa, most often occurring in a 3:1 ratio with the maculata I al?ele. The single analyzed sample of D. kerryensis had no detectable copies of the incarnata al?ele Xa, whereas the morpholog ically similar D. occidentalis s.str. showed a 3:1 ratio of maculata to incarnata al?eles. As with plastid haplotypes, a clear distinction was evident between accessions of D. elata from North Africa versus those from southwestern Europe. The nine samples from North Africa exhibited only the maculata Illa al?ele (a fragment equal in length to one of the common fuchsii al?eles but showing a dif ferent set of substitutions) or the maculata IV al?ele, with no trace of the incarnata X al?ele. In contrast, the six samples of D. elata from Europe had the maculata al?ele I, occasionally supplemented with a trace of the incarnata Xa al?ele. Correlation between patterns in ITS al?eles and plastid haplotypes. ? There was a significant correlation between plastid haplotypes and ITS types found in the allotetraploids (p &lt; 0.001; x2 test). Most notably, haplotypes A and C were most frequently as sociated with ITS al?eles Illb, V and VI (fuchsii and saccifera markers, respectively), whereas the B haplo type was most frequently associated with ITS al?ele I (maculata markers). The Dactylorhiza maculata group proved far more genetically diverse than D. incarnata s.l, containing four common ITS al?eles and 16 haplotypes. Many samples displayed both D. fuchsii and D. maculata al?eles. The A haplotype typical of D. fuchsii was found in a few acces sions that had been designated at the time of collection as D. maculata, and the B haplotype typical of D. maculata Fig. 5.

Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 was similarly found in a few samples initially identified as D. fuchsii. The frequency of individuals that combined fuchsii and maculata ITS al?eles showed a geographical trend, being frequent in Austria, occasional in France and rare in the British Isles (Fig. 6). Most D. saccifera exhibited the A haplotype shared with D. fuchsii and had a mixture of ITS al?eles characteristic of both D. fuchsii and itself (i.e., al?eles III and V versus VI). However, some Greek samples contained only the typical D. saccifera al?ele VI, combined with plastid haplotypes G and W that were not found in any other diploid species. The D. saccifera al?ele VI was also found in a few D. fuchsii from Croatia and the British Isles. In Britain, al?ele VI was detected only in D. fuchsii individuals cohabiting with allotetraploid D. praetermissa, many of which also exhibited the VI al?ele. This indicated introgression be tween the two species, which differ in ploidy. I DISCUSSION Comparison with previous studies of Docty/o rhiza that used similar molecular markers. ?Our study of plastid haplotypes shares several accessions with a plastid PCR-RFLP study by Hedr?n (2003), which in turn overlapped taxonomically with the PCR-RFLP study by Devos &amp; al. (2003). Not surprisingly, all three plastid investigations yielded broadly similar results. Our ITS work built on previous molecular phylogenetic studies by Pridgeon &amp; al. (1997) and Bateman &amp; al. (2003), but here we have sampled far more extensively within the target species. The main advances in our study are dense sampling of individuals and amalgamation of the two previously separate lines of evidence from maternally inherited plastid regions and a biparentally inherited nuclear region. Fig. 6. Mixing of Dactylorhiza maculata s.str. and D. fuchsii ITS al?eles across Europe. Populations of the D. maculata group that contained ITS al?eles characteristic of D. fuchsii and those characteristic of D. maculata are represented by green squares, whereas populations that contained al?eles of only one of the two species are represented by purple circles. 1196</page><page sequence="13">TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza In all accessions examined in our study, a strong pos itive correlation was observed between particular plastid haplotypes and particular ITS al?eles. This allows us to address Hedr?n's (2003) concern that, on the basis of plas tid data alone, he could not distinguish between ancestral polymorphisms and those due to recent hybridization. Our interpretation is predicated on the assumption that if ancestral polymorphisms were segregating then no strong correlation would be expected between markers from plastid and nuclear genomes (cf. Ramsey &amp; Schemske, 1998; Morjan &amp; Rieseberg, 2004). Thus, for the parental taxai). incarnata,D. fuchsii mdD. maculata, most pop ulations in which more than one marker was detected are assumed to result from hybridization rather than retention of ancestral polymorphism. The positive correlation between ITS al?eles and plastid haplotypes constitutes further evidence that the diploid D. fuchsii and autotetraploid D. maculata should be regarded as distinct species, even though there is clearly current gene flow across the divide of their different ploidy levels in many parts of their shared range (Fig. 6: cf. Devos &amp; al, 2003; Hedr?n, 2003; Shipunov &amp; al, 2005). These species undoubtedly experienced a period of isolation in the past that was sufficient to allow them to develop their distinct morphologies and ecological preferences; some of their secondary contact has resulted from post-glacial migration patterns and also recent human disturbance of the landscape. Evidence that hybridization between these two taxa is a recent phenomenon comes from the fact that the mixing of haplotypes and ITS al?eles now observed in these species rarely occurs in allotetraploids. If local populations of D. fuchsii show evidence of introgression with D. maculata, then locally formed allotetraploids should show similar mixtures of markers, contrary to our observations. Locally formed allotetraploids could have formed from single hybridizations, so it might be expected that such allotetraploid populations would be genetically consistent, but it would be highly unlikely that all parental D. fuchsii/maculata parents of such hybrids would themselves never be introgressed individuals. Most authors are also happy to treat D. foliosa (from Madeira) as a distinct species. This species is more closely related to D. maculata than the latter is to D. fuchsii, so if D. foliosa is recognized as a distinct species, then so must D. fuchsii and D. maculata (if DNA data are considered to have a bearing on which taxa are to be recognized). Molecular markers developed for this study were subsequently employed in the same laboratory as part of a more geographically constrained study that focused on dactylorchids of European Russia (Shipunov &amp; al, 2004, 2005; Shipunov &amp; Bateman, 2005). This demonstrated that in Russia the N haplotype, which is most similar to the B haplotype of D. maculata but is also commonly found in D. fuchsii, occurred only inD. maculata. This observation supports our inference that the N haplotype originated in D. maculata and subsequently became introgressed into D. fuchsii. In European Russia and Georgia, populations of the D. incarnata group contain not only the typical E haplotype but also the similar H haplotype. Allotetraploids occurring in northern Russia, most notably D. b?ltica, exhibited a mixture o? fuchsii and maculata markers, but lacked the C haplotype commonly found in southern Eu rope. Overall, the patterns observed in European Russian Dactylorhiza revealed few new haplotypes and are highly congruent with those reported here for western European Dactylorhiza. Employing ITS al?eles as nuclear markers. ? In this study we took advantage of indels in ITS to amplify length-variable fragments that are usually codominant, unless al?eles are lost through concerted evolution/gene conversion. Our technique allowed us to screen a large number of samples, including herbarium specimens that typically yield highly degraded DNA. We amplified both fragments in the same reaction in small volumes, thereby establishing a highly efficient screening method that did not require cloning when two or more al?eles were present. Analysis of electropherograms from direct sequencing of PCR products containing two or more al?eles was made difficult due to this length variation. However, we found that coincidence of these indels with al?eles dis covered earlier through sequencing (and in some cases cloning) was sufficient to identify each al?ele when the two fragments were considered together. Thus, we made the conservative assumption that neither fragment alone was diagnostic. No apparent bias was detected when evaluating mix tures of DNA of known ratio, as previously observed by Rauscher &amp; al. (2002). However, we observed only infre quently the simple allelic ratios expected from hybrids, indicating that in many cases copies of some al?eles were being eliminated or back-crosses were occurring; both processes "reinforce" one al?ele relative to others. For ex ample, although one accession of D. fuchsii from Sorvilier, Switzerland, had the expected diploid chromosome number of In = 40 (L. Hanson, M. Fay &amp; M. Chase, unpublished data), it also had the D. fuchsii Illb and V al?eles in a 1:2 ratio, which would have been most parsimoniously interpreted as indicating that this plant was triploid rather than diploid. It also proved difficult to analyze patterns from individuals that yielded more than two al?eles be cause one particular fragment length can sometimes be attributed to more than one al?ele (Fig. 3). Nonetheless, we could routinely detect al?eles representing only 10% of the total copies present and could reach 5% with reasonable confidence, showing that this technique is more sensitive than direct sequencing (Rauscher &amp; al, 2002). In summary, ITS fragments were a useful tool for determining parentage of many accessions, but observed 1197</page><page sequence="14">Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 ratios of al?eles were not reliably informative about ploidy levels, nor could complete absence of an al?ele be conclu sively demonstrated. Reinforcement of an al?ele due to backcrossing of the progeny with one parent could also be masked by effects of concerted evolution and/or gene conversion. Significance of concerted evolution in ITS. ? In allotetraploids, a degree of homogenization occurred in the great majority of cases because parental ITS al?eles were generally detected in non-Mendelian proportions. In many cases, one parental al?ele was apparently "lost" (or, more accurately, was reduced to less than 5%-10% of all copies present: Fig. 5). Comparison with maternally inher ited plastid microsatellites showed that in most cases the missing al?ele was the paternal one, generally that derived from the D. incarnata group. For example, examination of a single accession of D. armeniaca, a recently described allotetraploid derived from hybridization between D. euxina and D. incarnata (Hedr?n, 2001b), showed that it lacked the euxina ITS al?ele but possessed a typical incarnata plastid haplotype, indicating conversion to the ITS al?ele of the maternal parent. Among allotetraploids there were two main exceptions to the rule of maternal conversion. Dactylorhiza sphagnicola always had a ma jority of the D. incarnata (Xa) ITS al?ele in spite of having the B haplotype characteristic of D. maculata, whereas the majority of samples of D. purpurella (including D. cambrensis) combined the A haplotype of D. fuchsii with the incarnata-dQUved Xa ITS al?ele, which occurred in equal or more often greater frequency than the fuchsii derived V al?ele. In these two unusual cases concerted evolution appears to be favouring the paternal ITS al?ele rather than the maternal al?ele. Two contrasting mechanisms are most often proposed for concerted evolution of rDNA: unequal crossing-over and gene conversion (Hillis &amp; Dixon, 1991). The strong parental bias observed in Dactylorhiza favours the hy pothesis of gene conversion (Hillis &amp; al, 1991) because it is an unlikely outcome of unequal crossing-over, nor is it clear how a maternal effect could persist across the several generations needed to reduce one al?ele to an undetectable level. Studies of nuclear ribosomal ITS and the 18S rDNA intron in the marine macroalga Caulerpa (Durand &amp; al, 2002) and of ITS and IGS in Drosophila (Polanco &amp; al, 1998) similarly revealed differential evo lution in both directions and rates of concerted evolution that are incompatible with the unequal crossing-over model. Moreover, homogenization of ITS demonstrably occurs in flowering plants even when multiple ribosomal clusters occupy different chromosomes (Wendel &amp; al, 1995; Chase &amp; al, 2003). Exploring origins and migration patterns of allotetraploids. ? One important goal of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using ITS conversion rates to estimate the period of time elapsed since the initial hy bridization event that preceded successful establishment of each allotetraploid lineage and thereby to explore likely implications of contrasting dates of origin for subsequent evolutionary histories of the resulting lineages. It soon became apparent from our data that most of the allotet raploid samples from southern Europe had lost one of their parental ITS al?eles, whereas both parental al?eles were typically still detectable in allotetraploids from the British Isles and Scandinavia (both examined in this study) and from northern Russia (reported by Shipunov &amp; al, 2004; Fig. 5). Although acknowledging limits of sensitivity of our technique for detecting low-frequency al?eles, our results were highly internally consistent; within most study populations, either all individuals had retained both parental types or all had lost one. Because most northern allotetraploids have retained at least some evidence of both parental al?eles, indicating that concerted evolution has not reached completion, we hypothesize that they are younger than southern allotetraploids (in making this assumption we recognize that several other factors, most notably contrasts in effective population sizes, can also influence rates of change in the frequency of ITS al?eles). During the Quaternary, northern Europe experienced several cycles of thick ice cover followed by recolonization. The whole of Scandinavia and much of the British Isles were covered with ice 18,000 years ago, and periglacial conditions persisted until 11,700 years ago. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in Europe the northern allotetraploids became established post-glacially, whereas the southern allotetraploids that have largely eliminated one parental ITS al?ele may antedate the last glacial maximum. Combining the degree of gene conversion with in ferred parentage suggests a quadripartite classification of western European allopolyploid dactylorchids according to their respective parentages and putative relative dates of origin. Older allotetraploids that lack one parental ITS al?ele can be divided into those derived from hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and D. fuchsii (D. majalts) and those derived from hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and D. maculata (D. elatd). Similarly, younger allo tetraploids that maintain evidence of both parental ITS al?eles can be divided into those derived from hybrid ization between D. incarnata s.l. and D. fuchsii (e.g., D. praetermissa, D. purpurella, D. traunsteineri s.l, D. b?ltica) and those derived from hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and D. maculata (e.g., D. occidentalis, D. sphagnicold). Application of a range of molecular techniques has further teased apart the two categories of younger allotetraploids (e.g., Hedr?n, 1996, 2001, 2002, 2003; Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001; Devos &amp; al, 2003) and is partic ularly effective when combined with morphometric data gathered from the same individuals collected for genetic 1198</page><page sequence="15">TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza analyses (McLeod, 1995; Bateman, 2001; Shipunov &amp; al, 2004; Shipunov &amp; Bateman, 2005). Local origins have already been inferred for some of the younger allotetraploids, indicating that they evolved in situ in northern regions (Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001; Hedr?n, 2002; Shipunov &amp; al, 2004; Bateman, 2006, in prep.). However, we infer that the majority of allotetraploids have recolonized northern areas by relatively recent migration from the south because southern markers such as the C haplotype are widespread in many allotetraploids but al most completely absent from their presumed progenitors among diploids and autopolyploids. If so, the pattern of colonization inferred for the D. incarnata/maculata complex is unusual. In most other temperate clades that admix diploid and polyploid species, polyploids have proven to be strong colonizers of Arctic regions (Abbott &amp; Brochmann, 2003), whereas their diploid progenitors have remained much further south. Although we differ in our respective opinions regarding the relative average colonization abilities of the diploids, autopolyploids and allopolyploids, it is evident that one category is not clearly superior to the others, whereas in many other groups polyploids are competitively superior in the boreal zone. Possible reasons for this observation include the fact that, contrary to many other polyploid groups such as the fern Asplenium (Vogel &amp; al, 1999), polyploid species in the Dactylorhiza complex do not have colonization ability enhanced by apomixis. Also, Dijk &amp; Grootjans (1998) argued that, at least in the Netherlands, D. majalis s.str. and D. praetermissa prefer more fertile soils than do D. maculata and D. incarnata, perhaps indicating that these allotetraploids are only able to suc cessfully colonize a narrower range of habitats. Dactylorhiza incarnata group. ? As previously observed with allozymes (Hedr?n, 1996), AFLPs (Hed r?n &amp; al, 2001), PCR-RFLPs (Hedr?n, 2003) and ITS sequencing (Pridgeon &amp; al, 1997; Bateman &amp; al, 2003), remarkably little genetic variation was observed within the D. incarnata group (here defined broadly to include D. euxina), even though we sampled several morphologically circumscribed taxa that together spanned a large part of its overall geographical range. Each individual analyzed yielded only the plastid haplotype E, and most individuals contained only the ITS al?ele Xa. However, al?ele VIII, which differs from al?ele Xa only in possessing a 2 bp deletion, occurred alongside al?ele Xa in a few samples from Wales and Ireland. The only sample from Turkey analyzed had two ITS al?eles, both broadly resembling al?ele Xa but distinguishable by several substitutions. Extended analysis of D. incarnata s.l. from Turkey for allozymes and plastid markers indicated that the species is much more molecularly variable in southeastern Europe than in northern and western Europe (Hedr?n, 2001b, in prep.). The endemic Turkish diploid D. euxina had two unique haplotypes and a distinct ITS al?ele, although as expected both were most similar to those found in D. incarnata. Dactylorhiza incarnata is also profoundly distinct from the D. maculata group as observed with allozymes (Hedr?n, 1996, 2001b), but a few cases of possible in trogression have been observed. The plastid haplotype and ITS al?ele X of D. incarnata were found in a few specimens of D. saccifera from Croatia. We also found on single occasions the fuchsii ITS al?ele V and fuchsii haplotype A in two samples of D. incarnata subsp. pul chella. Furthermore, Shipunov &amp; al. (2004) demonstrated that the fuchsii V al?ele is widespread in some populations of D. incarnata in Russia. Using RFLPs, Hedr?n (2003) and Devos &amp; al. (2003) also revealed some evidence of hybridization and/or subsequent introgression between D. incarnata and members of the D. maculata group in Sweden. Thus, limited gene flow may still be possible between the two divergent parental groups, either directly or via allotetraploids as a bridge (a decidedly less readily detected process). Dactylorhiza maculata group. ? Although morphologically based studies are divided on whether to recognize D. maculata, D. fuchsii and D. saccifera as separate species (cf. Dufr?ne &amp; al, 1991; Bateman &amp; Denholm, 1989,2003; St?hlberg, 2007), there is growing molecular evidence that the former two represent lineages evolved in isolation for a considerable period of time, and most of us (not MH) argue that all three are best regarded as distinct species. They have distinct ITS sequences (Fig. 3: Pridgeon &amp; al, 1997; Bateman &amp; al, 2003) and, at least in Sweden, are readily distinguished using AFLP data (Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001). In this study we found markers in both the plastid and the nuclear genomes that clearly dis tinguish among the three taxa. Admittedly, we have also observed mixing of these markers in several accessions, but we believe that this is due to secondary hybridizat ion and/or introgression rather than incomplete lineage sorting. In this context, an introgression zone including two distinct genotypes within D. maculata s.str. has re cently been documented in Sweden (St?hlberg, 2007). As regards D. saccifera, increased sampling is required from the Balkans to decide whether the taxon is distinct from D. fuchsii; the distinctive ITS al?eles (Fig. 3) found in most accessions of D. saccifera indicates that it too existed in isolation from both D. fuchsii and D. maculata for a significant period of time. Another line of evidence for their distinctiveness comes from the allotetraploids, which allow us to infer genetic content of their parents. In allotetraploids, markers characteristic of D. fuchsii and D. maculata are rarely combined, indicating that at the time and place of the formation of the allotetraploids D. fuchsii and D. maculata were clearly distinct and not hybridizing as extensively as they are today. 1199</page><page sequence="16">Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 A few samples identified as Dactylorhiza maculata that had some D. fuchsii markers (ITS type and haplo type) or vice versa provide circumstantial evidence of hybridization or introgression. Artificial hybridization of these two species has revealed substantially greater fertility in back-crosses than in the first generation (Bateman &amp; Haggar, in press). Distinguishing between D. fuchsii and D. saccifera also proved challenging. The most problematic situation was encountered in the Alps region (eastern France, Switzerland and Austria: Fig. 6), where many samples exhibited both fuchsii and maculata markers, whereas such cases are rarer in the British Isles and southern Scandinavia. A recent set of 20 accessions o? Dactylorhiza sampled from acidic sites that should have been assigned to D. maculata if they were found in west ern Europe (M. Chase, G. Fischer &amp; D. Dockrel, unpubl.) showed that every one of them was a recent hybrid of D. fuchsii and D. maculata (recent because they all exhibited both ITS al?eles). These genetic observations correlate well with morphology, as field botanists regard the two species as more difficult to distinguish in central Europe (Heslop-Harrison, 1951; Dufr?ne &amp; al, 1991; Bourn?rias &amp; Prat, 2005) than in marginal areas in the northwestern part of the Continent (Bateman &amp; Denholm, 1989,2003; Pedersen, 1998, 2004). Furthermore, putative species morphologically intermediate between D. fuchsii and D. maculata, such as D. savogiensis and D. sudetica, have been described in the Alps and contiguous uplands (e.g., Delforge, 2001). Unfortunately, the ploidy of these plants remains unknown. The fact that several ITS types were still detected in some accessions of the D. majalis group indicated that gene conversion had not reached completion, in contrast with southern allotetraploids. If taken together with the absence of mixtures o? fuchsii and maculata markers in allotetrap loids, this indicates that most hybridization/introgression events involving allotetraploids occurred recently, after the formation of at least most allotetraploids. They most likely originated soon after the re-establishment of sym patry between these species when they expanded post glacially out of separate glacial refugia. In this context, it is noteworthy that the alpine region, where the relationship between D. fuchsii and D. maculata appears especially complex, is considered as an important zone of secondary contact among post-glacial migrants (termed a "suture zone" by Hewitt, 2000). However, all markers used in this study are susceptible to rapid fixation, either because they are maternally inherited (plastids) or because they are subject to concerted evolution (ITS). Such markers can reveal ancient genetic exchange between species even though the species themselves apparently remain morpho logically distinct, as has recently been observed among the anthropomorphic species group within the genus Orchis s.str. (M. Fay &amp; al, unpublished data). Such complex situations are best explored further by examination of multi-locus markers such as AFLPs and/or a selection of biparentally inherited nuclear microsatellites/introns in low-copy genes. The occurrence of some populations that combine markers typical o? Dactylorhiza fuchsii andD. maculata can be explained by recent local hybridization, despite their contrasting ecological preferences. For example, the karstic landscape of the Burren in western Ireland sup ports mainly the caldc?le D. fuchsii, but small pockets of peat-rich residual soils dotted across the limestone support the calcifuge D. maculata, bringing the two species into intimate proximity. They also frequently meet in mixed habitats in Scandinavia (St?hlberg, 2007). Admittedly, many other sites where the two species co-occur reflect recent anthropogenic disturbance. Nonetheless, combina tions of markers were also found in several populations where only one of the two species was found, most notably in Iceland where D. fuchsii is not known to now occur. Some samples confidently identified as either D. fuchsii or D. maculata were found to contain markers characteristic of the other species. For example, near Llangurig, Wales, plants with morphology characteristic of D. maculata and growing in typically acid soils yielded markers of both species, even though D. fuchsii was not observed growing in the immediate vicinity. Introgression between the two taxa is a more likely explanation of such observations, probably occurring in both directions. In terms of likely underlying processes, transfer of markers from the diploid Dactylorhiza fuchsii to the tet raploidZ). maculata is possible via unreduced gametes in D. fuchsii. Although D. maculata is generally accepted to be an autotetraploid (Hagerup, 1944; Heslop-Harri son, 1951), few reliable chromosome counts are available (confusion regarding which morphological characters best distinguish between D. fuchsii and D. maculata casts doubts on some determinations; e.g., Tanako &amp; Kamen oto, 1984). Thus, D. maculata may still be diploid in some parts of its range. Conversely, other observations indicate that in central Europe tetraploidy may occur in the typi cally diploid D. fuchsii (e.g., Hedr?n, 2002; Bourn?rias &amp; Prat, 2005; St?hlberg, 2007). Also, Hagerup (1944) noted the occasional development of haploid embryos without fertilization in both D. fuchsii and D. maculata s.str, re sults later confirmed by Heslop-Harrison (1957). If such embryos were viable they could permit gene flow from (auto)tetraploids to diploids. Thus, the theoretical barrier to gene flow between the putatively diploid D. fuchsii and tetraploidi). maculata is probably a less profound obstacle than is generally supposed; moreover, such a barrier has been overcome in Taraxacum, for example (Menken &amp; al, 1995). Except for a unique ITS al?ele, Dactylorhiza saccifera appears to be connected to D. fuchsii by populations with 1200</page><page sequence="17">TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification of Dactylorhiza |l|P$l?ll?IIEt?|?p atypical combinations of plastid markers. Dactylorhiza fuchsii ITS al?eles were found in D. saccifera in Croatia, Turkey and Greece, which was the only region where some samples of D. saccifera (1) did not have markers typically found in D. fuchsii and (2) exhibited distinct haplotypes. We also detected variable populations of D. saccifera from Greece. In addition, we found the D. sac cifera ITS al?ele VI in a few samples of D. fuchsii, not only from Croatia where the two species co-occur, but also in Britain, 600 km from the nearest extant populations of D. saccifera (as explained below, this apparent enigma could reflect occasional hybridization between D. fuchsii and D. praetermissa). Several observations support the origin ofZ). maculata in North Africa or the Iberian Peninsula. The first is the occurrence only in the Macaronesian island of Madeira oiD.foliosa, a diploid species that resembles D. maculata both morphologically and especially genetically (Pridgeon &amp; al, 1997; Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001). We also found a distinct ITS al?ele in the samples of D. elata from Morocco (one parent of which was probably maculata-lik?); this differs from the common D. maculata al?ele only in lacking a distinctive 8 bp indel and thus appears to be plesiomorphic relative to all ITS al?eles recovered from the D. maculata group. We also identified several unique but maculata-like plastid haplotypes in dactylorchids from this region. Cor responding morphological diversity is indicated by rec ognition by some authorities of three segregates from D. maculata s.str. that are endemic to Morocco, Algeria and the Iberian Peninsula?D. maurusia, D. battandieri and D. caramulensis, respectively (Delforge, 2005)?although they are at best only subtly morphologically distinct. Dactylorhiza saccifera may have had a refugium in Greece because this is the only area where genetically it is both diverse and relatively distinct from D. fuchsii', also, Greece is the centre of the present range of D. saccifera. Although we did not include samples of D. saccifera from Italy, another r?fugiai candidate, preliminary results from another study have not revealed unusual genetic diversity in this region (M. Hedr?n, unpublished data). We have obtained even less evidence regarding possible refugia for ?). fuchsii because this species showed little variation in plastid microsatellites (A or, less frequently, N). The fact that an additional haplotype, Q, is common in Russia (Shipunov &amp; al, 2004) tentatively indicates an eastern refugium, although the Balkans and Italy also remain credible candidates. Allotetraploids. ? It is noteworthy that we detected little evidence of gene flow between allotetraploids, in dicating presence of effective barriers to gene exchange. This is perhaps not surprising, given that extensive arti ficial crosses conducted among Swedish dactylorchids by Malmgren (1992) yielded fertile F2 plants only when one of the parents was Dactylorhiza incarnata s.l. or D. sphagnicola, the latter with the D. incarnata ITS al?eles predominating instead of the typical (for allotetraploids) al?eles of the D. maculata group. Bateman &amp; Haggar (in press) created artificial hybrids between D. praetermissa and D. purpurella that showed high fertility in both the first generation and backcrosses. Accessions of D. maja lis s.str. or D. traunsteineri exhibiting maculata markers were rare, and no fuchsii markers were observed in D. elata or D. occidentalis accessions, even though allotet raploids of these two categories often grow sufficiently close to each other to expect occasional cross-pollinations. However, allotetraploid populations that mix fuchsii and maculata haplotypes have recently been reported from Sweden (Hedr?n, 2003) and are also suspected to occur in Scotland (R.M. Bateman, unpub.). Species in the Dactylorhiza maculata group, most commonly D. fuchsii, were maternal parents of the great majority of allotetraploids. As observed in polyploids of other families (Soltis &amp; Soltis, 1999), allotetraploid dac tylorchids of western Europe have several origins; the num ber of plastid haplotypes indicates at least ten independent allopolyploid events. However, three haplotypes occurred in most allotetraploids, having successfully spread across most of the range of the genus: the most common fuchsii haplotype (A), the most common maculata haplotype (B), and the C haplotype, the last concentrated in the south and of an uncertain parental derivation. In addition, it is clear that, although it is always reported to be a tetraploid, D. maculata (or a genetically similar entity) was the maternal parent of several allotetraploid taxa. The C haplotype was found in only one putatively dip loid individual, a Greek Dactylorhiza saccifera. However, this accession also contained the common saccifera ITS al?ele VI, whereas most allotetraploids that possess the C haplotype have the fuchsii al?ele Illb. Thus, our current (albeit limited) sampling suggests thati). saccifera is not likely to be a parent of these allotetraploids. It seems more likely that the diploid species that originally donated the C haplotype to D. majalis and similar allotetraploids is extinct or at least has become sufficiently rare to escape our Europe-wide sampling effort. The C haplotype has a central position in the minimum spanning tree between the A haplotype characteristic of D. fuchsii and the G and W haplotypes found in some D. saccifera from the Greek mainland (Fig. 1). The presumed diploid species that once exhibited the C haplotype was probably for merly widespread, considering that the C haplotype has been found in allotetraploid samples stretching from the Pyrenees to the Tibetan plateau. However, this haplotype declines in frequency northward, being rare in Scandi navia and absent from European Russia (Shipunov &amp; al, 2004). This suggests either that the hypothetical ancestral diploid became rare before the end of the last glaciation or that it failed to migrate northward following glaciation. 1201</page><page sequence="18">Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification o? Dactylorhiza TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 In either case, its contribution to formation of relatively young northern allotetraploids was less important, be ing replaced in this role by typical D. fuchsii. Virtual absence of the C haplotype from sampled diploids and its preponderance in several allotetraploids suggests either that these allotetraploids were not formed in their present geographical locations or (less likely) raises the possibil ity that older allotetraploids may have contributed to the origin of younger allotetraploids (e.g., D. majalis s.str. to D. alpestris). Most allotetraploids with A or C haplotypes had fuch sii or saccifera ITS al?eles, and most possessing the B haplotype had the maculata ITS al?ele; the only exceptions to this pattern were a few samples combining maculata haplotypes with fuchsii ITS al?eles. Putative allotetraploid accessions containing both fuchsii and maculata ITS al ?eles were rarely detected, indicating that introgression between/), maculata and allotetraploids is an infrequent event, even though they share the same ploidy level. The only exceptions found in this study were from Iceland, where four out of five accessions contained both macu lata and fuchsii markers, despite the supposed absence from Iceland of D. fuchsii. Also, Shipunov &amp; al. (2004) reported the presence in northern Russia of allotetraploid populations that do not have D. incarnata as one of their parents but rather appear to be derived from hybridization betweenD. fuchsii and/), maculata. Nonetheless, almost all allotetraploids lack evidence of prior hybridization or introgression between D. fuchsii and D. maculata, and allotetraploids do not currently appear to be operating as a genetic bridge linking D. fuchsii and D. maculata. Moreover, the characteristic Dactylorhiza saccifera ITS al?ele VI was rarely found in allotetraploids examined here, indicating a limited contribution of D. saccifera to their formation. However, the distribution of this al?ele is unusual. It also occurs sporadically and typically at low frequencies across the range of D. fuchsii (e.g., Croatia, U.K.), frequently in D. praetermissa (U.K.; slightly more than 50% of the accessions sampled) and is present in single populations of D. majalis (France) and D. purpu rella (Wales). Thus, although D. saccifera is presently limited to the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East, it is possible that it once extended into western Europe. Alternatively, presence of the saccifera al?ele in other taxa, particularly D. fuchsii, could be the result of local hybridization with sympatric D. praetermissa. However, this hypothesis similarly requires a subsequent major contraction in the range of D. praetermissa to its present northwestern European enclave, after presumably origi nating in, and migrating out of, the Mediterranean region. This seems unlikely, given that D. praetermissa is here characterized as a young allotetraploid. Hedr?n (2001b) inferred that Dactylorhiza saccifera or a closely related taxon was one parent of the allotet raploids characteristic of Turkey because it is the only member of the D. maculata group that currently occurs in the region. However, different ITS al?eles were found in D. fuchsii andZ). saccifera, suggesting that the actual parent of these allotetraploids may instead be a hypothesized diploid that is either extinct or as yet undiscovered. Our data suggest that several widely recognized allotetraploid taxa have multiple origins, including the exceptionally widely distributed Dactylorhiza majalis. In the case of D. purpurella, presence of both D. fuchsii and D. incarnata haplotypes indicates that hybridization events that accompanied polyploidization occurred in both directions or that introgression with its parents has contributed to additional haplotypes after the original allotetraploid was formed. The case of D. traunsteineri and the closely related D. lapponica is especially instructive. Samples of each taxon from the British Isles, Scandinavia (the type re gion for D. lapponica) and the Alps (the type region for D. traunsteineri) are readily distinguished using either haplotypes or ITS al?eles, but within each region, there are no significant differences between the two supposed species, conclusions previously indicated by studies of allozymes (Hedr?n, 1996, 2002, 2003; Bateman, 2001) and AFLPs (Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001). It is clearly advisable to synonymize D. lapponicawith D. traunsteineri across their respective (and virtually coincident) ranges. How ever, the systematist must then make the difficult decision of whether to (1) recognize a single allopolyploid species that has at least three independent evolutionary origins (Table 3) or (2) recognize three separate species that are putatively distinct, one species located in each of the three geographical regions. Perhaps the most appropriate arbiter is whether putative segregated species can be recognized using morphological characters with an acceptable level of confidence. On this basis, Bateman (2006) assigned to D. traunsteinerioides those dactylorchid populations in the British Isles that had received considerable conservation attention because they had previously been ascribed to D. traunsteineri and/or to D. lapponica. However, even given extensive population genetic data and focusing on a restricted geographical area, it can prove challenging to determine with sufficient confidence the number of origins of a particular allotetraploid taxon. For example, Swedish populations of D. sphagnicola col lectively have only one origin according to plastid markers (see also Hedr?n, 2003), but allozyme data indicate at least two origins (Hedr?n, 1996), and fine-scale analysis of additional plastid markers indicates multiple origins (Hedr?n, Nordstr?m &amp; St?hlberg, unpub.). Inferring the current evolutionary status of allotetraploids. ? One of the most important questions raised by the Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata complex is why allotetraploids that we can demonstrate to have the 1202</page><page sequence="19">TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification o? Dactylorhiza same pair of parental species can exhibit substantially dif ferent morphological, ecological and distributional prop erties. Examples of such contrasts include D. sphagnicola versus D. occidentalis versus D. elata (all derived from hybridization between D. maculata and D. incarnata) and D. traunsteineri s.l. versus D. purpurella versus D. majalis (all derived from hybridization between D. fuchsii and D. incarnata). There are two contrasting hypotheses that could, either separately or in combination, explain differentiation and specialization among allopolyploids. (1) Post-origin differentiation of allotetraploids. This hypothesis is predicated on (1) presumed ability of differential directional or disruptive selection to fine tune to contrasting ecologies the products of different polyploidization events between the same two parental species, and (2) using contrasting degrees of ITS gene conversion to provide relative dates of different poly ploidization events occurring between the same pair of parental species. For example, the Irish endemic D. occidentalis is a recently synthesized allotetraploid, whereas the more widespread Iberian/North African D. elata is judged to be substantially older. Its greater age since formation offers selection more time to operate on the D. elata phenotypes and thereby to mould them to fit a distinct set of ecological parameters. This hypothesis predicts that D. occidentalis (a taxonomically controversial species, once tentatively misidentified as an autopolyploid: cf. Bateman &amp; al, 2003; Bateman, 2006) should still exhibit a blend of parental traits, whereas the longer existence of D. elata should have allowed it sufficient time to diverge from parental traits, thereby becoming more specialized and thus more readily recognizable as a bona fide species, a process perhaps assisted by a greater degree of genomic re-organization and integration of the two parental genomes (Parakonny &amp; Kenton, 1995). Furthermore, if older allotetraploids, such as D. elata and/), majalis s.str, did indeed originate before the last glacial maximum, then they would have responded to profound climate change by migrating first southward and then northward, presumably alongside their progenitors. If so, they would likely have passed through at least one genetic bottleneck, which would have further homogenized their genetic, morphological and ecological characteristics (cf. Cozzolino &amp; al, 2003b). In contrast, the more recently synthesized allotetraploids such as D. occidentalis and D. praetermissa, hypothesized to have originated during the Holocene, should appear more heterogeneous. An analogous but probably older case is provided by allotetraploid species complexes in Nicotiana (Sol anaceae). In section Polydiclieae (sensu Knapp &amp; al, 2004), evidence from plastid (Chase &amp; al, 2003) and ITS (Clarkson &amp; al, 2004) DNA sequences indicated that two allotetraploid species, N. clevelandii and N. quadrival vis, were generated from the same parental lineages at different times in their history. These two species now exhibit contrasting floral morphologies and ecologies and have only a slight range overlap in southwestern North America. Given sufficient time, some such entities be come distinct evolutionary lineages that can undergo sub sequent phyletic radiations; examples include Nicotiana section Repandae, which consists of four species with a common origin, and section Suavolentes, which consists of approximately 25 species with a common origin (Chase &amp; al, 2003; Clarkson &amp; al, 2004). (2) Pre-origin differentiation of parents of allote traploids. A contrasting hypothesis can also explain our ability to distinguish morphologically and ecologically most of the independent lineages resulting from sepa rate polyploidization events between the Dactylorhiza incarnata andD. maculata groups, as indicated by genetic data. This focuses more on the considerable degrees of morphological, ecological and, at least in the case of the D. maculata group, genetic differentiation that is evident among various named infraspecific taxa within the two parental groups (Bateman, 2001, 2006, in prep.). Within the British Isles atone, D. incarnata is rep resented by at least six named infraspecific entities: one a specialist of sphagnum bogs and another favouring depressions in dune systems, whereas the remaining four are characteristic of alkaline fens and marshes, occasionally extending into alkaline/neutral meadows (Heslop-Harrison, 1953; Bateman &amp; Denholm, 1985). Moreover, D. fuchsii exhibits the widest habitat toler ance of any British orchid species. In addition to named infraspecific specialists of upland and coastal pastures, populations inhabiting chalk and limestone grasslands, alkaline/neutral pastures, and alkaline/neutral marshes and woodland can all be distinguished by subtle mor phological differences (Bateman &amp; Denholm, 1989). This degree of largely correlated variation in morphology and habitat preference offers much potential for iteratively generating contrasting allotetraploid lineages from within the same pair of parental species. Consider, for example, the three moisture-loving allotetraploids that are shown by genetic data to be the progeny of D. incarnata and D. maculata s.str. As its name suggests, D. sphagnicola preferentially inhabits acid sphagnum bogs in Scandinavia and northwestern Continental Europe, where the most likely maternal parent is the sphagnum bog specialist D. maculata elodes, inheriting from it not only morphologies subtly distinct from those of the parental nominate race but also its extreme ecological preference (cf. Hedr?n, 2003). In contrast, the Irish endemic D. occidentalis tolerates soils varying from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline, especially when subject to anthropogenic disturbance. Both its morphology and ecology suggest that it is more 1203</page><page sequence="20">Pillon &amp; al. Evolution and diversification o? Dactylorhiza TAXON 56 (4) November 2007: 1185-1208 likely derived from hybridization between D. incarnata incarnata and D. maculata ericetorum. Lastly, the rela tively poorly researched, putatively older allotetraploid D. elata from southwestern Iberia and northwestern Africa prefers alkaline pastures and seepages and is hypothe sized to represent hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. (this species also has been under-researched in the southwestern extreme of its range) and one or more of the regional segregates of D. maculata (D. caramulensis, D. battandieri or D. maurusia). The rare Moroccan endemic D. maurusia is of particular interest in this context, as it is morphologically reminiscent of D. elata (e.g., Landwehr, 1977) and, unusually for D. maculata s.str, it inhabits alkaline soils. Separate evolutionary origins are likely for D. elata populations in Iberia and North Africa (the source of the holotype; Pedersen &amp; al, 2003), given their distinct haplotypes and contrasting converted ITS al?eles (Table 4), and the tendency to taxonomically separate French and Spanish populations from the nominate race as infraspecific taxa on the grounds of their subtly dis tinct morphologies (e.g., Nieschalk &amp; Nieschalk, 1972; Landwehr, 1977; Delforge, 2005). This contrasting hypothesis thus relies on the as sumption that these allotetraploids originated locally, in sympatry with their parents, and reflect both the detailed morphology and habitat preferences of those parents. This scenario implies that our ability to distinguish sub tly genetically distinct lineages derived repeatedly from the same two parental species relies more on selection honing the parents prior to polyploid formation than post-derivational selection honing allotetraploid lineages, thereby down-playing the evolutionary (and taxonomic) importance of relative periods elapsed since the initiating hybridization event. This hypothesis is best evaluated by studying morphologically and genetically diagnosable allotetraploids that show unusually restricted distributions and so are assumed to be of recent origin (Bateman, 2006; Bateman &amp; al, in prep.). | CONCLUSIONS Systematic implications of the genetic patterns. ? Of the three species aggregates considered here, the least taxonomically controversial within western Europe, at least at the species level, has been the Dactylorhiza incarnata group. With few exceptions (notably Delforge, 2005), authorities have been inclined to award species status only to D. cruenta among the named taxa within this group, and this elevation is not upheld by genetic data (Hedr?n, 1996; Hedr?n &amp; al, 2001; Bateman &amp; al, 2003). Treatments of the D. maculata group have historically ranged from recognition as a single species (most com mon if study focuses on regions suspected of sustaining relatively high levels of introgression) through frequent recognition of three core species (D. maculata, D. fuchsii and D. saccifera) to further division into local endemic species (Delforge, 2005). Not surprisingly, classification of allotetraploids has been most controversial, varying from most (Sundermann, 1980) or many (So?, 1980) in fraspecific taxa allocated to a single aggregate species, D. majalis, through to highly divided treatments recognizing many species, most poorly morphologically differentiated (Averyanov, 1991; Delforge, 2005). Our own framework taxonomy (Table 4), which cur rently excludes local endemics, is a compromise between these extremes. It represents an attempt to synthesize previous, morphology-based taxonomic circumscriptions (and associated knowledge of ecological preferences and geographical distributions) with more process-oriented Table 4. Recommended framework classification of European members of the Dactylorhiza incarnata and D. maculata groups and their derived polyploid complex. The plastid haplotype and ITS allele(s) given here are considered typical of each taxon. This summary focuses on well-established species, incorporating regional endemics but excluding local endemics.

Evolution and diversification o? Dactylorhiza data on occurrence of gene flow (hybridization/introgres sion), both currently and, by inference, in the past. Divid ing species more finely risks generating taxa that cannot reliably be distinguished using morphology or, in many cases, DNA data, thereby hampering communication and undermining conservation initiatives (the conservation implications of our data are explored elsewhere; Pillon &amp; al, 2006). Alternatively, further amalgamating species into "super-species", in response to evidence of past or present gene flow among component species, obscures our hard won knowledge of evolutionary processes operating within this allopolyploid complex. In particular, morphological, genetic and ecological differentiation evident among both diploids and tetraploids, and evolutionary causes of that differentiation, would no longer be represented in an un necessarily crude taxonomy (consider the extreme cases of lumping certain highly calcicolous lineages of D. fuchsii with the highly calcifugic D. maculata elodes or combin ing ecologically contrasting allopolyploids D. traunstein eri and D. sphagnicola). Our insights into the probable contrasting ages of different allotetraploid lineages, and their consequently contrasting genetic compositions and evolutionary trajectories, would also be ignored. Current co-existence of various diploids and tetrap loids in at least some regions without genetic mixing in dicates that barriers to gene flow are operating. Moreover, differentiation of the taxa has strong ecological as well as geographical components, suggesting that these taxa are likely to operate as distinct evolutionary units and hence supporting our use of the species category. Even where significant gene flow is evident between species in portions of their present ranges (e.g., between D. fuchsii and D. maculata in the Alps), there is evidence that these species have in the past experienced periods of isolation that allowed them to develop substantially different plastid haplotypes and ITS al?eles. Furthermore, the significant correlation between ITS al?eles and plastid haplotypes in both diploids and tetraploids means it is unlikely that lineage sorting rather than hybridization/introgression is responsible for the heterogeneity of these markers ob served in Dactylorhiza. With regard to future field collecting, our primary ob jectives are to intensify sampling in likely glacial refugia in Iberia/North Africa, Italy, Greece and the Caucasus and to extend application of our markers eastward into Asia. Novel haplotypes were found in material from the Russian Caucasus (Shipunov &amp; al, 2004), and a set of just four probable allotetraploids collected in Georgia revealed no less than three unique haplotypes (albeit clearly related to those previously found in Dactylorhiza fuchsii). Only one of our 399 samples was located east of the Urals; this sample, from the Tibetan Plateau, reassuringly yielded a haplotype and ITS profile typical of the dominantly European D. majalis. Limitations to the application of the genetic markers used in this study. ? The two sets of ge netic markers used here, plastid DNA fragment length variants and ITS nrDNA al?eles, are both subject to being "captured": plastid DNA due to its uniparental (maternal) pattern of inheritance and ITS because of concerted evolu tion/gene conversion, which overtime erodes evidence of its original biparental inheritance. Although parentage of young hybrids can be determined with confidence using these markers, older hybrids will not appear to be hy brids because of conversion of one ITS al?ele. Moreover, because conversion usually favours the maternal al?ele, maternally inherited plastid DNA markers are likely to generate sets of relationships concordant with those derived from maternally biased converted ITS al?eles, thereby further camouflaging evidence of past hybrid ization events. However, for the majority of accessions studied here, we were able to use these markers to identify hybrids and determine which species was the maternal parent. An unexpected benefit of quantifying ITS fre quencies was that the degree of loss of the less favoured ITS al?ele indicates relative ages of allotetraploid taxa. This is especially advantageous when, as here, the same pair of parental taxa has generated multiple allotetraploid lineages at different times in the past. Admittedly, even these two complementary sets of markers appear too conservative to adequately interpret some fine-scale patterns. For example, the considerable morphological variation evident within the D. incarnata group has proven invisible to most markers used so far, with the exception of a single allozyme locus (cf. Hedr?n, 1996; Bateman, 2001) and one promising plastid region (M. Hedr?n, unpublished data). Better markers within the D. incarnata group are essential if we are to evaluate our hypothesis that various allotetraploids are still being synthesized locally (e.g., Hedr?n, 2003: Bateman, 2006; Bateman &amp; al, in prep.). Similarly, if parental markers are too highly conserved we cannot detect cases of local hybridization and introgression. The results of this study provide a tantalizing glimpse into the complex evolution and ecology of these widespread European orchids, which nonetheless remain a serious challenge to the taxono mist. | ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Robyn Cowan, Edith Kapinos, Lazlo Csiba and Olivier Maurin for assistance in the laboratory and Dirk Albach, Crinan Alexander, Laure Civeyrel, Sid Clarke, Howard Clase, Helena Cotrim, Tom Curtis, Ian Denholm, Manfred Fischer, Trevor Hodkinson, Pete Hollingsworth, Frank Horsman, Mike Lowe, Yi-bo Luo, Richard Manuel, Ian Phillips, J?ao Pinto, Walter Rossi, Paula Rudall, Fred Rumsey, Andy Sch?nswetter, 1205</page><page sequence="22">Pillon &amp; al.
