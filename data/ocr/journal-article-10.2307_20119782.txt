<plain_text><page sequence="1">"NUESTRO PADRE EL SOL": SCHOLASTIC COSMOLOGY AND THE CULT OF THE SUN IN INCA GARCILASO'S COMENTARIOS REALES NICOLAS WEY-GOMEZ In a section of his Comentarios reales (Lisbon, 1609) dealing with the origin of the Incas and of their civilising role in the Andes, the mestizo historian Garcilaso de la Vega (the Inca) claims that Divine Providence elected from among the Indians of the First Age one whom he calls "un lucero del alba" to accomplish a proto-Messianic mission. This first Inca, Manco C?pac, was designated to teach these "fieras", as Garcilaso calls them, "alguna noticia de la ley natural y de la urbanidad y respetos que los hombres deb?an tenerse unos a otros" (Comentarios 36). In this manner, the Indians of the First Age were to be rendered "capaces de raz?n y de cualquiera buena doctrina, para que cuando ese mismo Dios, sol de justicia, tuviese por bien de enviar la luz de sus divinos rayos a aquellos id?latras, los hallase, no tan salvajes, sino m?s d?ciles para recibir la fe cat?lica..." (Comentarios 36). Warning his readers that the Incas referred to the sun as "Nuestro Padre el Sol" (37) because they boasted of descending from it, Garcilaso signifi cantly bestows the "honor" of recounting the mythical origin of the Incas upon one of his own noble relatives, an uncle of his from Cuzco. This voice from Garcilaso's childhood in Peru among the relatives of his mother, the princess ?usta Chimpu Ocllo, speaks thus to his mestizo nephew: " 'Nuestro Padre el Sol, viendo los hombres tales como he dicho, se apiad? y hubo l?stima de ellos y envi? del cielo a la tierra un hijo y una hija de los suyos para que los doctrinasen en el conocimiento de Nuestro Padre el Sol, para que lo adorasen y tuviesen por su Dios y para que les diesen preceptos y leyes en que viviesen como hombres en raz?n y urbanidad, para que habitasen en casas y pueblos poblados, supiesen labrar las tierras, cultivar las plantas y mieses, criar los ganados y gozar de ellos y de los frutos de la tierra como hombres racionales y no como bestias'" (Comentarios 37-38).</page><page sequence="2">10 Latin American Literary Review Garcilaso' s maternal uncle recalls that Father Sun, having placed these two children of his?Manco C?pac and Mama Ocllo?on Lake Titicaca, said to them: Cuando hay?is reducido esas gentes a nuestro servicio, los mantendr?is en raz?n y justicia, con piedad, clemencia y mansedumbre, haciendo en todo oficio de padre piadoso para con sus hijos tiernos y amados, a imitaci?n y semejanza m?a, que a todo el mundo hago bien, que les doy mi luz y claridad para que vean y hagan sus haciendas y les caliento cuando han fr?o y cr?o sus pastos y sementeras, y hago fructificar sus ?rboles y multiplico sus ganados, lluevo y sereno a sus tiempos y tengo cuidado de dar una vuelta cada d?a al mundo por ver las necesidades que en la tierra se ofrecen, para las proveer y socorrer como sustentador y bienhechor de las gentes. {Comentarios 38) Having cited what he calls the "f?bulas historiales del origen de los incas" (42), Garcilaso writes that, indeed, Manco C?pac installed the cult to the sun during his civilising tour through the Andes. He persuaded the Indians of the First Age to adore the sun for "los beneficios naturales que les hac?a con su luz y calor" (Comentarios 49). According to Garcilaso, the surname "C?pac" denoted the "riches" of this first Inca's soul, namely, "riqueza de ?nimo, de mansedumbre, piedad, clemencia, liberalidad, justicia y magnanimidad y deseo y obras para hacer bien a los pobres" (Comentarios 53). Garcilaso closes his account of the origin of the Incas and of Manco C?pac' s deeds by stating that this civilising founder "debi? ser alg?n indio de mucho entendimiento" (Comentarios 56) and that, seeing the need that the Indians had of "doctrina y ense?anza para la vida natural... fingi? aquella f?bula" (Comentarios 56) in which he and his bride Mama Ocllo appeared as children of the sun. The Indians subjected by Manco C?pac swallowed this tale "[p]orque es as? que aquella gente a ninguna cosa atiende tanto como a mirar si lo que hacen los maestros conforma con lo que dicen, y hallando conformidad en la vida y en la doctrina, no han menester argumentos para convencerlos a lo que quisieren hacer de ellos" (Comentarios 56). Thus ends Garcilaso's account of the origin of the Incas and of the establishment of the cult of the Sun in the Tahuantinsuyu. Garcilaso's account in this inaugural American classic differs substan tially from most early sources dealing with the origin of the Incas and the establishment of the cult of the sun in Tawantinsuyu. As the Andeanist historian Sabine MacCormack has shown, Garcilaso gave precedence to a myth of origin that established primogeniture as the model for Incaic</page><page sequence="3">Scholastic Cosmology in Inca Garcilaso's Comentarios reales 11 succession rights, while the myth of origin that appears to have prevailed for a longer time among the Incas told the story of four brothers whose rivalry had led to Manco C?pac' s triumphant foundation of Cuzco. As MacCormack also notes, Garcilaso gave priority to the invisible deity Pachac?mac as creator of the universe over the anthropomorphic trickster deity Tecsi Viracocha, who so often appeared in pan-Andean myths of creation. Identifying the Sun and Pachac?mac as the only two gods worshipped by the Incas, Garcilaso trivialised the role that other deities worshiped in the temple of Coricancha in Cuzco appear to have played in Incaic cosmology, and the role that the local deities known as huacas had played in Andean life from time immemorial (MacCormack 1990 and 1991). His motivation for doing so is set forth in what follows. Margarita Zamora, whose work on El Inca has contributed greatly to our understanding of his place in the Renaissance, observes that Garcilaso attempted to minimize the importance of solar idolatry among the Incas by suggesting "that the sun was worshiped as a physical manifestation or attribute of the kindness of the supreme and invisible deity Pachac?mac" (Zamora 74). Garcilaso indeed writes that "los Reyes Incas y sus amautas, que eran los fil?sofos, rastrearon con lumbre natural al verdadero sumo Dios nuestro Se?or, que cri? el cielo y la tierra" (Comentarios 61). According to him, they worshipped only the Sun and Pachac?mac, whom they claimed was "el que daba vida al universo y le sustentaba," although, he writes, "no le conoc?an porque no le hab?an visto, y.. .por esto no le hac?an templos ni le ofrec?an sacrificios, mas... lo adoraban en su coraz?n (esto es mentalmente) y le ten?an por Dios no conocido" (Comentarios 62). Zamora usefully argues that this tactic enabled Garcilaso to 1 ) validate Incaic solar worship within a Western tradition that itself considered the sun to be a direct manifestation of God (Zamora 104); and 2) locate Incaic hegemony in the Andes as a requisite preparation for evangelization (praeparatio evang?lica) in the New World (Zamora 114). Among the Christian authors who compared the sun to God, Zamora cites the Italian humanist Marsilio Ficino in his De comparatione solis ad Deum, which reads : "... the Sun can signify to you God himself in the greatest degree... So the invisible things of God, that is, the angelic divinities, are seen particu larly through the stars, and God's eternal power and divinity through the Sun" (181, n. 33). As MacCormack reminds us, it was from his earlier translation of the Dialoghi d'amore of the Neoplatonist Judah Abarbanel (and thus, indirectly from Plato's Timaeus and Phaedrus, among other works) that Garcilaso extracted the philosophical principles that would give credence to his claim that the Incas had intuited the existence of an invisible and omnipotent creator whose divine intellect was manifest in the figure of the sun (MacCormack 1991, 346-47). Although I bear in mind here some of the already abundant scholarship</page><page sequence="4">12 Latin American Literary Review regarding the close connection between Incaic sky-watching and imperial socio-politics, I set aside the discussion of the strata of Incaic cosmology that Garcilaso quite probably included for his Cuzco readers in his consideration of Incaic solar worship, and I focus instead on the readership he inherited by way of his Spanish father, Captain Sebasti?n de la Vega Vargas.11 explore the road indicated by Zamora and MacCormack, among others, in their consideration of Western cosmology. I draw attention to the scientific framework in which this cosmology belonged, and I show the degree of precision with which Garcilaso located Incaic solar worship for his Euro pean readers within parameters sanctioned by Christian science at the time. I chart Garcilaso's systematic construction of the philosophical correct ness?if not the theological orthodoxy?of the cult of the sun among the Incas. Garcilaso has received much attention in recent Hispanic intellectual history for his deft use of the frameworks of interpretation and rhetoric of Renaissance historiography and humanistic philology in a work that he modestly offered as "comento y glosa" on the Spanish historians who preceded him. These historians had, according to Garcilaso, falsified "el discurso de la historia" regarding his Inca ancestors (Comentarios 5-6). It is well-known that the title of his Comentarios intentionally echoed the Commentarii de bello gallico of Julius Caesar, one of Garcilaso's favorite authors. This title also announced the philological urge to reestablish a direct link between a discursive corpus ("el discurso de la historia") and a body of knowledge, or rather a knowable body (the Andean past) the meaning of which had been corrupted?misinterpreted and mistranslated? by Cieza de Le?n, Zarate, L?pez de Gomara, Diego Fern?ndez, Acosta, Jer?nimo Rom?n and other historians who had written about Peru. Nevertheless, the title of this work, as Zamora suggests in passing (53), also indicates Garcilaso's formation within an intellectual tradition that thrived between the 12th and 17th centuries on the reconciliation of Aristotle's rational, natural, and moral philosophies with Christian theology. Let us recall the formats observed by the scholastics both in the design of university classes modeled after Oxford and Paris and in the literature devoted to Aristotle's works: the commentary format (commentatio) con sisted of a part-by-part reading and corresponding explanation of a given text; the question format (questio), of a part-by-part reading, whichincluded a question elicited by the passage under scrutiny, a series of arguments for and against the possible answers to this question, and a corresponding solution that represented the author's considered opinion on the matter under question (Grant 1994: 23-24). Garcilaso used both formats in his Comentarios: he opens his discus sion of Incaic civilization by considering questiones that had been formu lated by scholastic cosmologists in their commentaries on Aristotle:</page><page sequence="5">Scholastic Cosmology in Inca Garcilaso's Comentarios reales 13 parece que fuera justo, conforme a la com?n costumbre de los escritores, tratar aqu? al principio si el mundo es uno s?lo o si hay muchos mundos; si es llano o redondo, y si tambi?n lo es el cielo redondo o llano; si es habitable toda la tierra o no m?s de las zonas templadas; si hay paso de una templada a la otra; si hay ant?podas y cu?les son de cu?les, y otras cosas semejantes que los antiguos fil?sofos muy larga y curiosamente trataron y los modernos no dejan de platicar y escribir, siguiendo cada cual la opini?n que m?s le agrada. (Comentarios 9) The cosmology underlying these questions bears brief recollection. Let us remember that the scholastics conceptualized the world (i. e., universe) as a hierarchically structured physical continuum composed of concentric spheres. Humankind's dwelling place stood still and minute at the center of a finite series of concentric spheres that carried the stars and planets at tremendous speeds around it. The Latin West followed Aristotle and one of his most notable heirs in Antiquity, the Alexandrian astronomer and astrologer Claudius Ptolemy (A. D. 100-178), in assigning the eight middle spheres of this continuum to the observable celestial bodies. This visible heaven (firmamentum) followed the order given to it by Ptolemy: closest to the elements, the moon, followed in ascending order by Mercury, Venus, the sun (which stood at the center of the heavens), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and, on the outer sphere of the firmament, the fixed stars. The convex (outer) surface of the firmament corresponded to the concave surface of the outer spheres. The innermost of the outer spheres, known as the first mover (primum mobile), was responsible for the daily motion of stars and planets around the earth; and the outermost of the outer spheres was known as the Empyrean heaven (caelum), which the scholastics believed to be God's dwelling place. The concave (inner) surface of the firmament surrounded the sublunar region of the cosmos, which housed the four elements?in order of increasing density, fire, air, water, and earth (Grant 1978). In this machine of the world, as some scholastics referred to the spherical con tinuum, the heavens were responsible for the motion and change of all bodies (animate and inanimate) in the region of the elements. I expand upon this matter shortly. Scholastic cosmology was a branch of natural philosophy, which itself was a division of late medieval and early modern learning concerned with the works of Aristotle that studied motion and change in the natural world (Weisheipl 1982: 522-24; Lindberg 1992: 2-4; and Grant 1994: 19-23). Aristotle's concept of natural motion and change was remarkably inclusive: it encompassed the physical displacement of celestial and sublunar bodies as well as the genesis, destruction, growth, and diminution of all animate and</page><page sequence="6">14 Latin American Literary Review inanimate existents in the sublunar region of the world: man, animals, plants, and minerals (Weisheipl 1982:523-527). Scholastic cosmology, for its part, was primarily concerned with Aristotle's treatment of the celestial region in his treatise On the Heavens and with those passages in his natural works? mainly the Meteorol?gica and On Coming-to-Be and Passing Away?that specifically concerned the relationship of the heavens with the sublunar region (Grant 1994: 5-7). The questions posed by Garcilaso at the opening of his Comentarios were widely discussed in cosmological literature. For instance, his question regarding the possibility of the existence of a plurality of worlds or spherical continua appeared in the works of the most distinguished authors of the late Latin West: the Commentary on "The Sphere" of Sacrobosco by Michael Scot (d. ca. 1235), On the Universe by Guillaume of Auvergne (ca. 1180 1249), On the Heavens by the Franciscan Roger Bacon (ca. 1219-ca. 1292), and On Heaven by Nicole Oresme (ca. 1320-1382). His question regarding the sphericity of the heavens appeared in the Commentary by Scot, On the Heavens and the Questions on the Eight Books of the Physics by Bacon, the Questions on "The Sphere" of Sacrobosco by Pierre d'Ailly (1350-1420), and the Questions on the Treatise of the Heavens by Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza (1578-1651). His question on the inhabitability of the earth appeared in the Commentary by Scot and the Questions by Pierre d'Ailly (Grant 1994: 681-741). According to the catalog afforded us by Jos? Durand, Garcilaso owned many works directly concerned with Aristotelian natural philosophy and cosmology. Among them, we find Sacrobosco's Tratado de la Esfera, an early thirteenth-century summary of Aristotelian cosmology and Ptolemaic astronomy which became a basic textbook in early European universities until well into the seventeenth century (Pedersen 1978: 303-37); a Primera parte de la "Filosof?a natural, " which would have contained, if not Aristotle's basic cosmological treatises, their commentary by someone like Saint Thomas Aquinas or Alonso Fuentes (Sevilla, 1547); a Cosmograf?a o repertorio de los tiempos, by Jer?nimo de Chaves (Sevilla, 1554); a treatise De la esfera del mundo, which, Durand believes, could have been a treatise by Chaves, a Sphaera mundi by Francisco S?nchez de las Brozas (Salamanca, 1579), a commentary on Sacrobosco by Pedro Ciruelo, a Sphaera del universo by Gin?s de Rocamora, or, finally, la Esphera y Arte de Marear by Francisco Faleiro (Sevilla, 1535); a volume of the Secretos naturales, possibly De lafisonom?a naturaly varios secretos de la naturaleza (C?rdoba, 1601 ) or De secretis naturae or a treatise by Raymond Lull, which included the natural philosophy of the Dominican saint Albertus Magnus; and, finally, an Alberto Magno, which according to Durand, may have contained his Summa Theologica, or Father Ribadeneyra' s translation of his Tratado de las virtudes intitulado Para?so del Alma (Madrid, 1593), or, in</page><page sequence="7">Scholastic Cosmology in Inca Garcilaso's Comentarios reales 15 all likelihood, his well-known Philosophiapauperum (L?rida, c. 1489), also known as Philosophia naturalis: this popular last work contained the Saint' s commentaries on Aristotle's Physics, his cosmological works, and the psychological treatise On the Soul (Gesamtkatalog 1: 340-45). By opening his Comentarios with these questiones, Garcilaso was establishing a critical interplay between his work and previous histories of the Incas analogous to that which the scholastics had established between their works and Aristotle's. For the scholastics simultaneously assimilated and corrected in light of Christian doctrine Aristotle's interpretation of the natural world. As the scholastics did with the Aristotelian corpus, Garcilaso presupposed a finite and stable body of knowledge (the Andean past) and a discursive corpus ("el discurso de la historia") which required emmendation in light not only of Christian theology but also of the testimony Garcilaso could offer as an "eyewitness" ("testigo de vista"), as aquechua speaker, and as a compiler of information afforded him by his relatives in Cuzco. The interplay founded on the format of scholastic questions and commentaries simultaneously conferred fundamental authority onto Span ish historians who had written on the Incas and castigated their historical and philological inaccuracies. This strategy of deference allowed Garcilaso to disable historical accounts that justified the Spanish conquest of Tawantinsuyu based on the allegations that the Incas had observed barbaric practices (i. e., human sacrifice, idolatry) and had exercised tyrannical rule over Andean peoples, either by having displaced previous legitimate rulers or by engag ing in wars of succession such as the one between Atahuallpa and Hu?scar at the time of Pizarro's arrival in Cajamarca. Explicitly or not, Garcilaso would reopen to discussion in his Comentarios the question of whether the Incas practiced human sacrifice, whether they were idolaters, and if so, of what sort, and whether they held legitimate rule in the Andes. But the cosmological questiones that open Garcilaso's Comentarios armed him with more than a legitimate model of argumentation in light of an established historiographical corpus. Garcilaso answers the questions of the scholastic cosmologists in order to assign Tawantinsuyu a literal (i. e., physical) place in the Aristotelian universe and Incaic thought a "place" within contemporary cosmology in Europe. Garcilaso, for instance, recontextualizes the question regarding the possibility of other universes in order to eliminate the radical difference implied in the term "New World" to designate what we otherwise know as "Am?rica": "no hay m?s que un mundo y aunque llamamos Mundo Viejo y Mundo Nuevo, es por haberse descubierto aqu?l nuevamente para nosotros, y no porque sean dos, sino todo uno" (Comentarios 9). With this answer, Garcilaso partially eliminates in his European readers the anticipated need to resort to a new system of knowledge to apprehend Incaic culture better than Spanish historians had. I state that he does this partially, because</page><page sequence="8">16 Latin American Literary Review Garcilaso identified speaking knowledge of quechua as a fundamental access code to Incaic culture, and first-hand experience as an ultimate arbitrator in the debate over the legitimacy and degree of civility of the Incas. Garcilaso establishes his authority as a witness by situating the geographical boundaries of Tawantinsuyu between the equatorial circle and 40 degrees south, that is, by explicitly locating the Inca empire on the southern half of the torrid zone and a good half of the austral temperate zone. Garcilaso writes that, as a native born in Cuzco, he had been born squarely in the middle of the torrid zone, which cosmologists before the Age of Exploration had, for the most part, considered to be uninhabitable due to the extreme heat generated there by the sun. He had at the age of twenty crossed the torrid zone to reach Spain, a feat that cosmologists had considered to be theoretically impossible for the same reasons. And he had crossed the Tropic of Capricorn southbound into Charca territory well inside the austral temperate zone, reason for which he could attest to the existence of antipodes, the hypothetical inhabitants of the southern hemisphere whose existence had been denied by the great majority of Aristotelian cosmologists preceding the Discovery. Although Garcilaso's formulation of these cosmological questiones is somewhat comical when we bear in mind that European exploration had put them to rest for over a century, Garcilaso was not only rehearsing and authorizing the expository method for his treatment of Incaic civilization, he was also laying the foundations of Incaic cosmology in terms sanctioned by the scholastics. He was not only assigning Tawantinsuyu a place in a region of the world that natural philosophy had for many centuries considered to be theoretically uninhabitable, but he was also preparing to justify the cult of the sun among the Incas within parameters acceptable to his European readership. Allow me to recall briefly the principles underlying the opera tion of the machine of the world as the scholastics understood it. As I mentioned before, the scholastics believed that the heavens directly and systematically caused motion and effected change in the elementary or corruptible region of the world contained within the lunar sphere. Aristotle had laid the foundations for a theory of celestial influence in his Physics and in the cosmological works mentioned before: On the Heavens, the Metereologica, and On Coming-to-Be and Passing-Away. The Physics explained the motion and transformation observed in sublunar bodies as the result of a hierarchical interaction in which bodies pertaining to a lower link in the chain of causation were moved by bodies pertaining to a higher link. The nobler body, called the motor, and the baser body, called the motum, constituted the minimal structure of a virtually infinite chain that linked lower existents moved by others, intermediate existents that both moved lower existents and were moved by higher ones, and higher existents that moved others but themselves remained unmoved.2</page><page sequence="9">Scholastic Cosmology in Inca Garcilaso's Comentarios reales 17 The chain motus-motum linking lower (i. e., inferior) existents with increas ingly higher (i. e., superior) ones culminated in a single self-moving existent which, itself unmoved, directly or indirectly moved all others: the first mover (Physics 8.5). This building block of the cosmic architecture would be of great consequence in the development of the natural and moral philosophies in the Latin West. It provided the paradigm for the concept of the Great Chain of Being, which classified the natural world according to a scale of quasi infinite gradients leading from the basest?most imperfect and soulless? material existent to the noblest?most perfect and spiritual?abstract existent.3 The soul moved (i. e., ruled) the body, and each animate body in the scala naturae (plants, animals, and man) was endowed with a soul that possessed increasingly higher functions by virtue of which it had its place in relation to divinity (nutrition, sensation, and intellect, respectively) (Lovejoy 58-59). The hierarchical relation between motor and motum was also one of the models upon which moral philosophers in the Latin West came to conceptualize the order of polity and the relationship between rulers and their subjects, the first acting upon the second as motor upon motum. In the Politics the natural order prescribed that men endowed with a higher degree and control of reason (those in whom the intellective soul rightfully governed) should move or govern those whose reason had been impaired by the base appetites of their nutritive soul (Politics 1.4-5). As Pagden briefly suggests in his study of the use of Aristotle's moral philosophy in the sixteenth-century debates led by the jurist Juan Gin?s de Sep?lveda and the advocate of the Indians Bartolom? de las Casas over the legality of enslaving New World peoples, the theory of natural slavery forwarded in the Politics was part of a thought system which saw the subjection of man by man as an extension of "the organising principles of the universe itself (Pagden 49). This complementarity is not unique to Aristotle. Plato, for instance, com posed his cosmological Timaeus many years after The Republic, yet framed it within a section of the dialogue in the The Republic which considers the proper hierarchy among the dwellers of the city-state (Timaeus xx-xiv). Aristotle carefully constructed the case for the theory of celestial influence in his treatise On the Heavens, where he establishes a hierarchical physical relationship between the heavens and the sublunar region of the world. No perceptible change had ever been observed in the unending, uniform, circular motion of the heavens around the earth. The sublunar region of the world, on the contrary, showed constant motion and change in the four elements and their compounds: the things of this earth (animate and inanimate) moved in finite manner; they came into being, grew, altered their properties and numbers, decayed, perished. Aristotle's reasoning behind assigning the heavens priority in nature with respect to the elementary region of the world confirmed the ancient belief that the heavens were made</page><page sequence="10">18 Latin American Literary Review of an incorruptible substance nobler than the elements, ungenerated and indestructible, to which he and his predecessors referred as ether (On the Heavens 1.2-3). Aristotle completed the foundations for the theory of celestial influ ence by invoking throughout these works the observed correlation between the sun's yearly fluctuating declination with respect to any given zenith on earth and the corresponding succession of seasons that accompanied the life cycles of plants and animals in the sublunar region of the world. Let us remember that Aristotle subscribed to the predominant view (partially derived from Empedocles's concept of roots) that the four elements, while being the primaries for all sublunar existents, themselves resulted from the various couplings of four fundamental qualitites organized in pairs of contraries: the hot and the cold, the dry and the wet (On Coming-to-Be 2.2.329b.6-330a.29; and Lloyd 1964). Earth was primarily cold and some what dry; water, mostly cold and somewhat moist; air, mostly moist and somewhat hot; and fire, mostly hot and somewhat dry (On Coming-to-Be 2.3.330a.30-331 a.6). The elements and their compounds were generated out of each other as the primary qualities in them gave way to their contraries: water was generated as the dry gave way to the moist in earth; air, as the cold gave way to the hot in water, and so on (On Coming-to-Be 2.4.33 la.7 333a. 15). Change in the elements and their compounds was thus conceived by Aristotle as an unending, cyclical "process of coming into contraries and out of contraries" (On Coming-to-Be 2.4.331a.l3-20). Sublunar existents came into being and perished as the hot and the cold, and the dry and the wet in them gave way to their opposites. Aristotle not only assigned the sun a major role in the occurrence of meteorological phenomena (Metereologica 1.3). He quite logically consid ered it to be the main "generator" of contraries in the natural world (On Coming-to-Be 2.10). The coming-to-be and passing-away of sublunary existents was primarily caused by the yearly advance and retreat of the sun along the ecliptic, an imaginary circle that described an inclined orbit with respect to the earth's equator (The sun lagged behind each day approxi mately one degree [4 mins.] with respect to the previous day, thus tracing on the sky an oblique circle that marked its yearly orbit around the earth). The northernmost and southernmost points of the ecliptic latitudinally corre sponded to the circles (tropics) of Cancer and Capricorn, respectively. These two tropics, as we know, described the northern and southern boundaries of the torrid zone, where, by virtue of lying directly overhead, the sun exerted the most influence. Although Aristotle specifically focused on the sun as the principal source of "efficient causation" in the sublunar region of the world, he very clearly considered the aggregate of celestial motions to be respon sible for the extraordinary complexity of motion and change observed in the elements and their compounds (especially Physics 8.6; and On the Heavens 1.2).</page><page sequence="11">Scholastic Cosmology in Inca Garcilaso's Comentarios reales 19 Aristotle's theory of celestial influence would be fully developed by Ptolemy in the Tetrabiblos, an astrological work which attempted to describe all the permutations of cause and effect between the heavens and the earth, from the most general?pertaining to the domain of what we call the natural sciences?to the most specific, pertaining to the domain of what we often deride as superstition (i. e., horoscope).4 The scholastics univer sally condemned the casting of horoscopes, because this practice presumed to foretell an individual's actions and, thus, contradicted the Christian belief that man was saved or condemned by virtue of exercising his free will. They averted potential doctrinal objections to the practice of general astrology by maintaining that celestial bodies (which they considered to be purely material entities) acted solely upon material bodies below, not upon the human soul, which was a spiritual (higher) entity. Aristotle's physics and cosmology and Ptolemy's astrology still provided a systematic framework to account for motion and change in the natural world.5 Planets and stars possessed properties (Tetrabiblos 1.4-9) that they communicated through ether to the four elements, and through these in turn to the complex of compounds that composed all sublunar existents, animate and inanimate. The sun, for instance, possessed dryness and heat, which it generated in, and subtracted from, material existents by virtue of its annual advance and retreat along the ecliptic. The sun generated life by its presence, and destroyed it by its absence. In the machine of the world, the sun was, as one reads in the Questions on "The Sphere " by Themon Judaeus (ca. 1330 d. after 1371), a "wise king in the midst of his kingdom" or "the heart in the middle of the body" (cited in Grant 1994: 226-27). Many scholastics used the metaphors "king" and "heart" for the main celestial body, including Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), who in one of his earlier commentaries on Aristotle's treatise On the Heavens states regarding the sun's middle location among the celestial spheres that "the king lives in the center of the kingdom and the heart is in the center of animals, so that they can provide equally therefrom for all the people and for the members."6 It is not surprising that Garcilaso, who wrote during the final decades of scholasti cism, should have made ample and conscious use in his own Comentarios of an intellectual tradition that revered the sun as the principal generator of motion and change in the natural world. Let us observe more closely how he does so. Garcilaso does warn his European readers that, because the Incas lacked a writing system to communicate "las cosas sutiles" conceived by their amautas, they failed to make much headway in astrology and natural philosophy (Comentarios 103). The Incas "[a]dmir?banse de los efectos, pero no procuraban buscar las causas, y as? no trataron si hab?a muchos cielos o no, ni imaginaron que hab?a m?s de uno" (Comentarios 104). The Incas lacked knowledge of "las cualidades de los elementos, para decir que</page><page sequence="12">20 Latin American Literary Review la tierra es fr?a y seca y el fuego caliente y seco, sino era por la experiencia de que les calentaba y quemaba, mas no por v?a de ciencia de filosof?a" (Comentarios 103). Nevertheless, while the Incas had not theorised regarding the internal mechanics of the cosmos, they did possess, according to Garcilaso, a basic understanding not only of its structure and behaviour but also of their own place within it. They drew a clear distinction between the various parts of the world: llaman al cielo Hanan Pacha, que quiere decir mundo alto, donde dec?an que iban los buenos a ser premiados de sus virtudes; llamaban Hurin Pacha a este mundo de la generaci?n y corrupci?n, que quiere decir mundo bajo; llamaban Ucu Pacha al centro de la tierra, que quiere decir mundo inferior de all? abajo, donde dec?an que iban a parar los malos.. .(Comentarios 75) The Incas likewise recognised the minimal hierarchy between motor and motum joining the chain-links of Aristotelian physics: Manco C?pac's main inaugural act during his civilising tour of the Andes had been the establishment of a cult of a physical body that moved, that is, generated or ruled over, all others. Incaic natural philosophy, writes Garcilaso, super seded that of the Indians of the First Age, [quienes] no levantaron los pensamientos a cosas invisibles, [ y quienes] adoraban lo que ve?an, unos a diferencia de otros, sin consideraci?n de las cosas que adoraban, si merec?an ser adoradas, ni respeto de s? propios, para no adorar cosas inferiores a ellos; s?lo atend?an a diferenciarse ?stos de aqu?llos y cada uno de todos. (Comentarios 26-27) Disregarding the hierarchical structure of the cosmos, Indians of the First Age had adored "fuentes caudalosas y r?os grandes, por decir que les daban agua para regar sus sementeras,...la tierra...porque les daba sus frutos,.. .el aire por el respirar,... [y el] fuego porque los calentaba y porque guisaban de comer con ?l" (Comentarios 28). In other words, the Indians of the First Age had, according to Garcilaso, mistakenly worshipped, "no solamente los cuatro elementos, cada uno de por s?, m?s tambi?n todos los compuestos y formados de ellos, por viles e inmundos que fuesen" (Comentarios 29). As Garcilaso explains, Manco C?pac had preached to his Indians</page><page sequence="13">Scholastic Cosmology in Inca Garcilaso's Comentarios reales 21 que no en balde el Pachac?mac (que es el sustentador del mundo) le hab?a aventajado tanto sobre todas las estrellas del cielo, d?ndoselas por criadas, sino para que lo adorasen y tuviesen por su dios. Represent?bales los muchos beneficios que cada d?a les hac?a y el que ?ltimamente les hab?a hecho en haberles enviado sus hijos, para que, sac?ndolos de ser brutos, los hiciesen hombres.. .Mirasen, pues la vista los desenga?aba, que las yerbas y plantas y ?rboles y las dem?s cosas que adoraban las criaba el Sol para servicio de los hombres y sustento de las bestias. Advirtiesen la diferencia que hab?a entre el resplandor y hermosura del Sol a la suciedad y fealdad del sapo, lagartija y escuerzo y las dem?s sabandijas que ten?an por dioses. (Comentarios 59-60) Garcilaso further explains that, of the seven planets, the Incas had knowledge of only three, the sun, the moon, and Venus, and that "De los signos no hubo imaginaci?n, y menos de sus influencias" (Comentarios 104]). The Incas followed, according to him, Venus's orbit in relation to the sun, and the various phases of the moon. And, he writes, [tjambi?n el Sol los incitaba a que mirasen en ?l, que unos tiempos se les apartaba y otros se les allegaba; que unos d?as eran mayores que las noches y otros menores y otros iguales, las cuales cosas los movieron a mirar en ellos, y las miraron tan materialmente que no pasaron de la vista. (Comentarios 104) The Incas also understood, explains Garcilaso, that the sun's influence increased or decreased in inverse relationship to its declination relative to a given point on the earth's surface: as? iban experimentando que, cuanto m?s se acercaban a la l?nea equinoccial, tanto menos sombra hac?a la columna que estaba m?s cerca de la ciudad de Quito; y sobre todas las otras estimaron las que pusieron en la misma ciudad y en su paraje, hasta la costa de la mar, onde, donde por estar el Sol a plomo (como dicen los alba?iles), no hab?a se?al de sombra alguna a mediod?a. Por esta raz?n las tuvieron en mayor veneraci?n, porque dec?an que aqu?llas eran asiento m?s agradable para el Sol, porque en ellas se asentaba derechamente y en las otras de lado. (Comentarios 106)</page><page sequence="14">22 Latin American Literary Review As the noblest motor in the natural world, the sun was, implies Garcilaso, the logical object of worship for an empire that had flourished in the very region of its maximal influence. The sun's role as the principal cause of motion and change in sublunar existents explained the fact that the Incas should believe that they had been generated by it. Perhaps no better testimony in favor of this belief can be summoned than that of Aristotle himself, who in his Physics had stated: "In Nature man generates man; but the process presupposes and takes place in natural material already orga nized by the solar heat. .."(1.1.194b, 13-14). Philosophically, not theologi cally, speaking, the expression "Nuestro Padre el Sol" (Our Father the Sun) is correct. This expression found justification in a network of systematic observations regarding cause and effect in the natural world. As I mentioned earlier, the mechanics of the natural world in Aristotle's thought bore immediate resemblances with the structuring of hierarchical polity. The natural and the moral realms both reflected the hierarchical and mutually binding relationship between motor and motum: the sun moved and changed the elements and their compounds, as the soul moved the body, as a given man governed his inferiors. According to Garcilaso, the Incas not only believed that living beings were composed of mortal body and immortal soul, but also differentiated among the various gradations of the soul, attributing an intellective soul to humans, and sensitive and vegetative souls to animals (Comentarios 75). The Incas' apprehension of the minimal structure of a hierarchical chain in the natural world, most evident in their worship of the sun as principal motor of the elements and their compounds, enabled them to intuit other hierarchical dyads. The Incas understood their place not only within the natural world, but also within the moral realm. Hence Garcilaso's emphasis on the parallels between the sun as father of all things, and the first Inca Manco C?pac as father of the Andeans. Furthermore, the understanding that the sun was the principal motor of the elements, and the soul of the body, enabled the Incas to intuit "con lumbre natural" (by natural reasoning) the existence of an invisible mover of the world. This is why Garcilaso tells his European readers that the name of the divine Pachac?mac means "el que da ?nima al mundo universo, y en toda su propia significaci?n quiere decir el que hace con el universo lo que el ?nima con el cuerpo" (Comentarios 62). Garcilaso was partially formed in an exegetical tradition that consid ered the study of nature to be an indispensable tool for understanding and receiving the Creator. This tradition was founded upon a passage found in Saint Paul's epistle to the Romans: "the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made" (Romans 1: 20 [Vulgate]). On the basis of this passage, the Church Fathers (St. Basil, Ambrose, and Augustine) inaugurated a tradition that considered the natural world to be a legible text: the literal meaning of</page><page sequence="15">Scholastic Cosmology in Inca Garcilaso's Comentarios reales 23 this text was evinced by means of natural philosophy, and its spiritual meaning by that of Christian theology (Curtius 1953; Gilson 1936; and Glacken 1990). The words on this subject by the mystic Fray Luis de Granada ( 1504-1588) in his S?mbolo de laf? are worth recalling: "Qu? ser?n luego todas las criaturas del mundo, tan hermosas y tan acabadas, sino como unas letras quebradas y iluminadas que declaran bien el primor y sabidur?a de su autor?" God set before us, he wrote, "este tan maravilloso libro de todo el universo, para que por las criaturas del, como por unas letras vivas, ley?semos la excelencia del Criador" (cited in Curtius 320). It is truly significant in this regard that Garcilaso should assert that Manco C?pac was an Indian "of good understanding" ("de buen entendimiento"). What Garcilaso means is that by inventing (not believing) the fable that he was the son of the sun, Manco C?pac had demonstrated his great ingenuity as a reader of the literal sense of the book of nature, and as someone quite capable of understanding its spiritual sense. This conscious fabrication stands as a signifier of Manco's dual understanding of Creation. The sun was the literal (i. e., physical) manifestation of the ultimate motor, an invisible omnipotent creator. In the portrait of Incaic natural philosophy that Garcilaso offered to his European readers, the Incas not only understood the literal sense of the book of nature perfectly, but intuited its spiritual sense in the elusive figure of the invisible Pachac?mac. Garcilaso's deference to scholastic science in his eulogy of the solar cult among the Incas speaks to the fact that the study of colonial semiosis entails, alongside the search for New World frameworks buried under the rubble of transculturation, also the deconstruction of the frameworks that America has so successfully assimilated from the Western tradition as to render them invisible to itself. A rich understanding of Garcilaso's intellectual accomplishment requires as much a symbolic an thropology of Europe as it does one of the New World.

Scholastic views of Aristotle's and Ptolemy's proposi tions in favor of the theory of celestial influence can be found in Grant (1994: 569 617). His discussion of scholastic cosmology offers and invaluable tool for understanding Aristotle's cosmological works and their impact on the development of Western astrology. North (1986) provides an account of the explanations forwarded for the mechanisms of celestial influence in a tradition that extends from Aristotle, through the Stoics and Neo-platonists, to the late pre-Newtonian scholastics. ^Questions on the Treatise of the Heavens by Galileo Galilei as cited in Grant (1994:227, n. 28).
