<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTRODUCED SPECIES Ecology of Biological Invasions. Cambridge University Press, New York, 1986. 166 pp., illus. $42.50 (cloth). Although recently there have been several texts that deal with intro- duced species, this volume will make a valuable addition to the libraries of both scientists who conduct research on introduced species and persons who are responsible for the manage- ment of a given geographical area. The title is somewhat misleading on three accounts: as stated in the pref- ace, the main focus of the book is on those species that have been intro- duced into Australia; several chapters present anecdotal information pub- lished elsewhere, as well as political, social, and economic considerations, and do not deal with the ecology of invasions; and the text assumes that all biological invasions are the result of anthropomorphic activities. The first consideration is not a ma- jor problem, because several chapters discuss how the Australian situation relates to similar situations through- out the world and provide extensive literature citations. For example, A. H. Arthington and D. S. Mitchell provide extensive lists of aquatic vas- cular plants and fishes that have been introduced into Australia, and pro- vide the reader with information on the impacts of these organisms on a worldwide basis. Conversely, A. E. Newsome and I. R. Noble concen- trate on those species that have invad- ed Australia, but provide a summary of those types of ecophysiological pa- rameters that contribute to the suc- cess of invading species. This list- which includes gap grabbers, compet- itors, survivors, swampers, habitat changes, gap filling, risk taking, com- petitive superiority, and predator re- lease-is applicable to many ecosys- tems, and thus is valuable to those individuals who study invading orga- nisms almost anywhere in the world. The second consideration may de- crease the number of individuals who will read and/or purchase the book. Although the first five chapters ad- dress the ecology of introduced spe- cies, the next four constitute a section on management of invasions. These chapters provide good information relative to the control and possible elimination of exotic species, but the information they provide tends to be parochial. Finally, the last three chap- ters are grouped together in an over- view section. A. Gibbs in his discus- sion of microbial invasions makes some generalizations, but for the most part provides anecdotal infor- mation. K. Myers discusses vertebrate introductions, but places great em- phasis on rabbits. R. H. Groves's chapter gives an excellent discussion of plant invasions and is one of the best, if not the best, paper in this collection. It provides information on species that have invaded Australia and also lists the characteristics of invading plants, including taxonomic position, homoclimes, ecological sta- tus, dispersal characteristics, seed dormacy, genetic systems, and modes of reproduction. Furthermore, areas of future research directions are given. Following the chapters are 12 sum- maries of posters presented at the symposium from which this text was generated. These summaries are of varying quality, and most, as might be expected in an abstract, raise inter- esting questions. Some, such as that presented by R. W. Robinson, G. W. Carr, and J. M. Robin, provide the reader with data and make some im- portant generalizations relative to or- ganisms that have become naturalized in Australia. I doubt that most of the information presented in these ab- stracts will be useful to readers. The title implies a broader scope than the one addressed-the text dis- cusses only introduced species and not other forms of biological inva- sions. Overall, I recommend this book to those involved in the study or management of introduced species. JAY R. STAUFFER, JR. School of Forestry The Pennsylvania State University University Park, PA 16802 Ecology of Biological Invasions of North America and Hawaii. H. A. Mooney and J. A. Drake, eds. Spring- er-Verlag, New York, 1986. 321 pp., illus. $59.00 (cloth). Introduced species have dramati- cally affected many ecological com- munities throughout the world and in some cases have replaced native taxa as the ecological dominants. These alien organisms and the processes by which they become established are the subjects of this book. The papers are from a symposium on biological invasions held in Asilomar, Califor- nia, in October 1984 and organized by the Scientific Committee on Prob- lems of the Environment. In a brief preface, the editors de- scribe a few of the dramatic effects of exotic species, such as their domi- nance in parts of Hawaii and south- ern Florida, their negative impact on agriculture and forestry, and their ef- fects on ecosystem properties. A ques- tion posed by the editors and ad- dressed in many of the chapters is, "What species will successfully in- vade?" An interest in exotic orga- nisms and a desire to accurately pre- dict which ones will successfully establish should make this book ap- pealing to a large audience. The high price is the one unfortunate feature. The book's 16 chapters are ar- ranged into six sections. The first section examines four groups that are common invaders: insects, fish, plants, and pathogens and parasites; the second section discusses attributes of invading species. Section three treats relationships between commu- nities and invading species, including community properties that favor in- vasions; the enormous economic losses in agriculture and forestry that are due to "pest" species, many of which are introduced; and the changes in ecosystem properties wrought by exotic animals and to a lesser degree by exotic plants. In the fourth section, J. Roughgarden pre- sents models of invasions, and in the fifth section four case histories are discussed. The final section consists of a chapter by D. L. Dahlsten on the control of exotic organisms. This book maintains a refreshing balance between animal and plant, microbial and macro-organismal, and theoretical and empirical, and even applied, studies. As is typical of many symposium volumes there is no sum- mary, synthesis, or analysis of con- cepts. Some interesting background information is also lacking. Ecology of Biological Invasions in many ways is an update of The Genetics of Colo- nizing Species (H. G. Baker and G. L. BioScience Vol. 38 No. 1 56</page></plain_text>
