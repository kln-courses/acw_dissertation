<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY AND FINE ARTS E.B. Vadeckaja, Drevnie idoly Eniseja (The An? cient Idols of the Yenisei) (U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences - Institute of Archaeology - Lenin? grad, ? Nauka ? Publishing House, Leningrad Section, 1967, 80 pp., 22 drawings, 22 pis.). M.A. Castren, the great Finnish explorer and philologist, had already called the valley of Mi? nusinsk, situated on both sides of the middle course of the Yenisei, by the macabre name of ? gigantic cemetery ?. And yet the Austrian scholar of pre? history, Gero von Merhart (later to become a university professor in Germany), sent to this remote region as a prisoner of war in the First World War, objected strenuously to being freed ? a case more unique than rare ? after the October Revolution; he wanted to continue the studies begun in captivity on a zone which he realized was of exceptional interest for his science, both quantitatively and qualitatively. He tries in his Siberian memoirs ? vainly, as he remarks ? to give the reader an adequate idea of this distant world's rich archaeological remains: ? In order to offer a more complete picture ?, he notes, ? one would have to know how many kurgans can be found in every square kilometer of the naked steppe. But no human being has ever counted the kurgans in the Minusinsk district; and even supposing that the fabulous day were to arrive on which one could close the inventory of the ancient remains hidden in this earth, that inventory would of necessity ignore all the countless tombs leveled off and removed by sedentary farmers, since the colonization of the region began. The use of mere numbers cannot let us approach a miraculous thing (Wunderding) like the steppe of tombs on the Yenisei ?. We approach the Wunderding of this kurganic steppe on the great Siberian river, in this present monograph, rich not in pages but in what is more important: contents; and last but not least, in rare and well-chosen photographs and illustrations, some of them authentically fantastic, in that they rep? resent the figured and figurative echo of religious and magical conceptions that withdraw from outer reality to express the life of the mythopoeic unconscious. In fact, there arise before us in these images the ancestral idols of the peoples of the Siberian steppe; and this will be the first surprise for those accustomed, by a great amount of specialized literature and by visits to the great museums of the U.S.S.R., Europe and America, to linking this toponym with the famous ? Minusinsk bronzes ?, of which there are by now more than 40,000 and which are scattered throughout the world's mu? seums (not to mention the thousands that undoubt? edly ended up in local crucibles). We are here at the centre of a series of consecutive cultures, Chalcolithic and Bronze Age, which all get their name from the places in southern Siberia in which they flourished: Afanasevo, Andronovo, Karasuk. In the first of them there starts the art of metal working which then flourishes in the cultures that follow. But the present author is not in? volved, in her monograph, with the metallurgical production of this fruitful cultural area, nor does she deal with the numerous problems connected with the origin and development of these consec? utive cultures, or with their relations and cor? relations with the surrounding world (a world that extends from Europe, the Caucasus, Luristan and the Urals, to China). At any rate, the very abundant literature that sifts such problems forms the tacit background of the present booklet. The protagonist of these pages and illustrations is thus not metal (bronze) but stones that arise from the Siberian steppe: the stone slabs carved by the hand of man, the stelae covered with mysterious images, anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, etc., in other words the now-famous kamennye baby, the ?stone matrons?, as the local population called them. As the author recalls, up to the last century those sculptures aroused in the people those ambivalent emotions that are characteristic of religious sentiment: fear and reverence. It is therefore not hard to imagine what an aura of sacred ? numinosity ? must have surrounded these stelae in the distant epochs in which they were carved. Probably the ancient populations made sacrifices before them, put food at their feet, spread cream, tar, animal blood on their lips (traces of all these have been found), while during certain rites they danced and sang around these ? idols ? of the steppes. It is indeed thanks to such primeval sentiments of veneration that these monuments have hitherto been preserved, although the many etiological and other legends circulating 496</page><page sequence="2">about them among the people did nothing but hide their true origin and their probably meaning. The author briefly sums up the history of the more or less scientific researches dedicated for more than two centuries now to these singular creatures of the steppes, already described by such 18th cent, explorers as PJ.T. von Strahlenberg, D.G. Messerschmidt, P.S. Pallas, G. Gmelin, etc. But only in the present century, and especially after the October Revolution, were these monuments studied with modern comparative stylistic and iconographic criteria that also tried to classify them into definable territorial, chronological and, if possible, ethnic groups. In the columns of this journal (EW, XVII, 1967, pp. 131-134), we presented the book by Ja. A. Ser, Kamennye izvajanija Semirec'ja {Stone Monuments of Semiretchensk), 1966, a book that courageously undertakes the long and difficult task of supplying a typology for the kamennye baby, that is, of dividing into iconographic and semantic classes the entire world of these sculptures of the Eurasian steppes, which extend from the mouths of the Danube, through the southern part of European Russia, to southern Siberia and even beyond. In regard to these sculptures, though, both Ser and Mrs Vadeckaja are mainly regional re? searchers: the region most thoroughly known and studied de visu by the former is the ? land of the seven rivers ?, between the Thian Shan and Lake Balkash in Turkestan, while the present archaeol? ogist is a specialist in southern Siberia, and precisely of the region of Minusinsk and the neighbouring Khakasia (the zone around the city of Abakan). A glance at the map gives an idea of the great distance between these two centres. But the stone monuments of the two regions, while belonging to different groups of the typological picture estab? lished by Ser, have one essential characteristic in common: both of them have a cult character, both express what Ser calls ?cult semantics?. In other words, we are dealing in both cases with sculptures that hide a magical and religious mean? ing (the two attitudes are inseparably connected with one another, at least in this psychological religious phase). Therefore the interpretation should always be oriented on the basis of the criteria elaborated by the psychology and history of religious phenomena. The explorer and inter? preter of these representations will have to make an effort to penetrate into that universe of mythical, ritual, cosmological, etc., conceptions, to which these works seem linked, and of which they are, so to speak, the petrified materialization. In the restricted framework of her booklet, the Author was obviously unable to give a thorough examination of a problem that even a palaeo ethnologist and archaeologist of the stature of K. Jettmar judges with marked scepticism, in the introduction to his attempt to make use of the results of archaeology to trace a religious history of northern Eurasia (Die Religionen Nordeurasiens und der amerikanischen Arktis, 1962). As Jettmar justly observes: ?The single facts are almost always plurisemantic (mehrdeutig).only where we can embrace with a glance both the style and the dynamics of a given complex, is it possible to also formulate a judgement as to the religious evolution?. Since this premise rarely if ever comes true, the interpreters of these archaeological cult remains usually recur to one word, which they use as a kind of ?Open Sesame! ?, to unbar the gates that block the understanding of these extremely complex phenomena: we mean the word ?shamanism?, in itself certainly insufficient to cover ? the varieties of religious experience ? of ? primitive ? man, though it is hard to say that M. Eliade is wrong when he considers shamanism ?the most genuine mystical experience in the religious world of the primitives ?. For example, it is all too easy to consider the mystery of the kamennye baby, a mystery at the same time genetic, ethnic and semantic, as being solved by recurring, as does Ser, to ? Turkic shamanism ?. In this respect, one must keep in mind that, despite the considerable number of studies devoted to shamanism in central and northern Asia, the specifically Turkic connotations of the shamanic phenomenon do not seem to have been defined and circumscribed with precision, if they even exist as such. Let us observe en passant that not one of the local populations, actual or belonging to the recent past, mentioned by the Author to illustrate some parallel or related aspect that she thinks can be found between the modern popula? tions and the prehistoric ones, in their attitude to the respective idols, is of the Turkic language or ? race ?. In fact, the Nenets and the Ostyaks are Samoyeds, and the Yenisei Ostyaks or Kets, even ? Palaeoasiatics ?. Then too, it is useless to state that any comparison set up between more or less recent peoples and hypothetical inhabitants of the Bronze Age may be stimulating and heuristi cally useful, but will always remain conjectural, and not scientifically binding. Relatively young ethnonyms such as ? Turks ?, ? Samoyeds ?, and above all the very vague one of ? Palaeoasiatics ?, clearly have a right to belong to ethnography and comparative linguistics, but not at all to prehis torical archaeology. The latter is mainly an empirical science, since it is based on the ? testimony ? of the sources to be weighed, combined and interpreted in an appropriate manner, and thus has to first try to create a solid phenomenological foundation, the presupposition for a later and deeper ideological 497</page><page sequence="3">understanding of these singular lithic monuments of Siberia. The exact location and description of each single complex ? as, in the present case, of that of the steppes of Minusinsk and Khakasia ? is an unavoidable task of Soviet science which, from what one gathers from books such as those of Ser and Vadeckaja, is firmly advancing in that direction. The stylistic classification preferred by the present scholar is, however, far more con? ventional and simplifying than the fairly complex ? iconographic canon ? used by Ser for an attempt at organizing, defining and grouping all the existing material. Our Author, in fact, divides the ancient an? thropomorphic representations on the slabs of the Yenisei into the following three groups: realistic group, simple unrealistic group and complex unrealistic group. The difference consists mainly in the formation and characteristics of the face, to which the sculptor gives almost exclusive atten? tion, while the breasts and abdomen (of the female figures) are only crudely sketched out. All the sculptures seem to be executed with the same technique: after roughing out blocks of gray or white granite, or slabs of brown sandstone, brought expressly from the mountain, the sculptor first sketched out the future design, which he then traced in grooves, often coloured with ochre (the magical-apotropaie importance of red colour needs no documentation), and clearly outlined. In the ? realistic? figures (the smallest in number) the chin is always pointed, the nose straight, and those characteristics that ? as we shall soon see ? are essential to real ?idols ?, are missing: the stripe across the face, the third eye, the head? dress. In fact, in the figures of the second, ? non realistic ? group, made according to a rather prim? itive scheme, we find an oval or round face, with the eyes made of two small holes, while the mouth is shown by a small oval groove and the nose by two points, or often not at all. The face is always crossed by a stripe. An elaborate hair dressing is missing here, but in its place we find ? rays ? that issue from the head. The third and most complex ?unrealistic? group differs from the less elaborate second group, thanks to its extremely complicated facial scheme: here we find three eyes, the forehead is crossed by stripes and the nose and chin are clearly marked. These are the fantastic ? idols ? that, as we have said, have such a great effect on the observer's imagina? tion and sensibility; even the drawings that reproduce them, even if more or less schematically, in the present publication, give the same im? pression. In this third group the very complicated head-dress is worthy of special attention: a ? crown ?, or else animal horns and ears, while a strange vertical strip, often quite long, rises above the forehead. If any doubt still existed as to the magical-religious nature of these sculptured figures, these attributes (the zoomorphic decoration of the head, the third eye and the mysterious stripes or rays) would unquestionably resolve it. At the start of our review, we briefly men? tioned the rather melancholy reputation (that of a Riesenkirchhof, to use Castren's term) enjoyed by the Minusinsk steppes because of the countless kurgans scattered all over them. It is no wonder, then, that even the anthropomorphic slabs found in this zone were interpreted as grave-monuments, contemporary with the kurgans themselves, within whose area most of them really were found. Now, however ? notes the Author ? this tacit con? viction that the two are coeval and that the stelae are grave-monuments must be abandoned, as the result of a surprising discovery, confirmed by extensive controls up and down the entire zone of the necropoleis on the Yenisei: it was found that throughout the area these stone slabs, hitherto considered funerary or commemorative, even though ? obviously ? devoid of inscriptions, really have no connection with the kurganic complexes into whose area they seem to have fallen as if by chance. Or rather, these worked and figured stones, which already existed, were re-used in different periods and in places often far from their presumable first position, by the builders of the kurganic mounds belonging to various epochs. It is clear that such chronological confrontations presupposed a more exact definition of the order in which these mounds, or mound complexes, followed one another in time; in fact, Soviet science has gained great ground in recent decades in just this problem. Even the first researchers in that direction, M.P. Grjaznov and E.R. Schnei? der, were astounded by this kind of spatial and temporal ubiquity of the remarkable stelae, present ? and absolutely identical ? on mounds often separated from one another by several centuries. In fact, if the most ancient kurgans provided with such stone sculptures, can be attributed to the 7th-5th cent. B.C., these carved slabs belong to a far older period, that is, to the last of the three Bronze Age cultures mentioned above, that of Karasuk, which follows the Andronovo culture in the Minusinsk basin and the Altai in about the 12th cent. That culture ? not mentioned by Mrs Vade ckaja in her excellent but highly laconic study ? is considered by certain authoritative scholars to be at least partially extraneous in origin to the area under consideration; it may in the last ana? lysis have an Iranic origin, at least according to another well-known Soviet archaeologist, Mrs N. L. Clenova; it would thus contain certain formative and ideological elements characteristic of the 498</page><page sequence="4">bronzes of Luristan. Still other researchers make the culture derive from northern China. The zone was open, as far back as the Afanasevo period, to outside cultural currents, especially from the West. A. N. Lipskij ? a Siberian archaeologist who carried out important excavations in our zone, and precisely in the necropolis of Tas-Haza, where he brought to light ? group of slabs with anthro? pomorphic figuration ? documented in a study on the Afanas'evskaja Culture (1961) the complex magical-religious background of this culture, pro? duced by the fusion of the autochthonous Neolithic patrimony with elements from the West. Let us repeat: we have here a typically syn cretistic zone, a most ancient melting-pot not only for elements of material culture (pottery, etc.), but also for ideological and religious currents. It suffices to consider some of the iconographic motifs pointed out by the Author, especially those in what she considers the third and ? most com? plex ? group of Yenisei ?idols?: for example, the ? crown ?, or the rays issuing from the head, the zoomorphic attributes, the ? third eye ?. All these motifs, and above all the last, can easily be linked with numerous ? and often over? whelming ? similarities in the universal icono? graphic patrimony, from the most archaic to the most evolved civilizations: from the cave of Trois-Freres to Mohenjo-Daro, to Siva, Marduk, Amon-Ra, to the El of the Phoenicians, to Janus, to the ? Thracian Rider ?, to the Celtic, Germanic, Slavic ? ;dols ?, and so on. If the Russian scholar, by recurring to the comparative method, had wished to deepen the similarities that link the Yenisei figurations to others scattered through? out the entire historical world, she would have found a reliable guide in a well-known monograph by R. Pettazzoni {The All-Knowing God, 1956). The Author arrives at a basically exact ? ge? neral conclusion ?, against the background of such a historical-religious heritage, in the last pages of her work, a work that is a valuable one on the whole, but that can only strike us as incomplete and therefore unsatisfactory: ?... the anthro? pomorphic sculptures of the Minusinsk basin must be considered as cult monuments, as divinities to be feared and placated, and from whom one struggled to obtain some kind of help ?. This is indeed an excessively ? general ? conclusion, which does not take into sufficient account either the semantic peculiarities of these sculptures, or their resemblance to other similar complexes. All in all, we too think that the ? idols ? of the Yenisei, and the ? stone matrons ? in general, have yet to reveal to us all the secrets they have guarded so well for many centuries.
