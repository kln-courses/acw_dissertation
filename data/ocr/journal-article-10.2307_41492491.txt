WRIGHT ABSTRACT. - Comparative studies of ground stone artifacts have been limited, due to widely varying terminology and typological schemes restricted to material from one or two specific sites. Most interim site reports describe such artifacts only briefly. Yet ground stone has important implications for the development of prehistoric technology and therefore deserves at least as much attention as is routinely given to chipped stone tools. This article presents definitions of technological and morphological terms and a general classification applicable to prehistoric Levantine sites. While morphological typology should certainly not be the final goal of ground stone analyses, few would dispute the need for relatively standardized terminology that will permit com- munication of finds. RESUME. - Les études comparatives du mobilier en pierre sont restées limitées en raison d'une terminologie très variable ainsi que d'une typologie restreinte à du matériel provenant seulement d'un ou deux sites. La plupart des rapports préliminaires ne décrivent ces objets que très sommairement. Or, le mobilier en pierre joue un rôle important dans le développement de la technologie préhistorique et mérite autant d'intérêt que celui accordé aux outils taillés. Cet article présente des définitions de termes tech- nologiques et morphologiques, ainsi qu'une classification générale applicable aux sites préhistoriques du Levant. La typologie morphologique n'est pas le but final des analyses de mobilier en pierre mais est nécessaire afin de permettre les comparaisons. Studies of ground stone assemblages from Near Eastern prehistoric sites have been hampered by inconsistent terminology (1). Many typologies are based on a diverse mix of criteria, often loose ca- tegories of shape and size (2) ; most are descriptions of (often small) samples from one or two sites, usually without general definitions that can be ap- plied to different assemblages (3) ; others focus only on a few artifact classes (4) ; nearly all ignore ground stone debitage. Thus, comparisons of assemblages have been difficult to make. By contrast, chipped stone studies employ relatively standard terms useful for such comparisons (5). A standard descriptive classification is a prerequisite for addressing the significance of ground stone assemblage variations. (1) As previously noted by HOLE et al., 1969 : 170; KRAY- BILL, 1977 : 487; HERSH, 1981 : 77f; RUNNELS, 1981 ; NIER- LÉ, 1983; VOIGT, 1983: 247. Type names, definitions and numbering schemes all vary widely. (2) Exceptions to this criticism include DORRELL, 1983; NIERLÉ, 1983; VOIGT, 1983; CLUZAN, 1984; MOUTON, 1984; ROODENBERG, 1986, though the typologies are still site- specific and emphasize different attributes. The studies by NIER- LÉ, 1983; MOUTON, 1984 and ROODENBERG, 1986 are also outstanding in their emphasis on ground stone technology. (3) DUNNELL, 1971; cf. SOLECKI, 1969; NOY, 1979; BANKS, 1980; HERSH, 1981; DAVIS, 1982; DORRELL, 1983; MOHOLY-NAGY, 1983. Among comparative studies of wider scope, KRAYBILL (1977) covers the entire Old World (but in very general terms); essays by FUJIMOTO (1984, 1985) cover the Levant (in Japanese); WRIGHT (1992) has a comprehensive review of Levantine prehistoric material.

The purpose of this article is to present such a classification for application to the prehistoric Levant. Discussions of space-time systematics, specific assemblages and functional significance of the artifact classes are presented elsewhere (6). The term "ground stone" is a misnomer (7). Such tools may be made on flakes detached from cores; some exhibit retouch; others are analogous to "core tools." Here, the term refers to any tools made by combinations of flaking, pecking, pound- ing, grinding, drilling and incising. These include mortars, pestles, grinding slabs, handstones, grooved and perforated stones, axes and other types. How- ever, figurines and beads are excluded. Although abrasion plays a prominent role in the technology, a few artifact categories included here need not have involved grinding (e.g. pounders, choppers). Jelinek (8) suggests that chipped stone assemb- lages mainly reflect stages in progressive modifica- tion of an original "functioning" toolkit. A similar situation has been documented for Levantine ground stone assemblages (9). A morphological classifica- tion based on progressive lithic reduction is here considered the best way of describing assemb- lages (10). This approach avoids assumptions that (6) WRIGHT, 1991, 1992. Specific instances of most of the types presented here are described and illustrated in WRIGHT, 1992. (7) RUNNELS, 1981 : 218f. (8) JELINEK, 1976 : 22; cf. DIBBLE, 1987. (9) WRIGHT, 1991, 1992; cf. JELINEK, 1976; TOTH, 1985; DIBBLE, 1987. (10) MARKS, 1983 : xiii. 53</page><page sequence="2">morphological classes primarily reflect either stylis- tic "norms" or tool functions as inferred from eth- nographic analogy. Variations resulting from function or style will be better understood if tech- nological criteria are addressed first (11). The classification given here is regional in scope (12) and based on defined classes as distinct from individual samples (13). It gives definitions applicable to Levantine assemblages of the Upper Paleolithic through Chalcolithic time range (45,000 to 5,500 b.p.) It was derived from (a) direct exam- ination of 22 Levantine assemblages from diverse environments, comprising 2,713 artifacts and (b) comparison with ground stone presented in site re- ports (14). The typology was constructed to meet three prerequisites : (a) It must be hierarchical, composed of larger classes to which subclasses may be added. This facilitates addition of types when new assemblages are reviewed. The format is similar to that of wide- ly-used chipped stone classifications (15); (b) Classes must be based on explicit, easily-re- produced attributes. (11) JELINEK, 1976; MARKS 1983: xiii; TOTH, 1985: 107 ; OLSZEWSKI, 1986 : 79. Criticisms of chipped stone typo- logies such as those of Bordes center on the scope and interpre- tation of the types (BINFORD and BINFORD 1966; KERRICH and CLARKE, 1967 ; JELINEK, 1976; MARKS, 1981 : 371 ; BIN- FORD, 1982 : 25; DIBBLE, 1987). Recent research stresses tech- nology, but no one disputes the need for classifications that permit consistent description of finds (BINFORD, 1 983 : 96; DIBBLE, 1987 : 116). It should be emphasized that despite functional names here assigned to artifact classes, the classification is not an all- purpose functional typology. Indeed, it is unlikely that such ty- pologies can be created (MARKS, 1983 : xiii). The classification presented here will be useful for subsequent functional interpre- tations if it is remembered that (a) establishing functional attri- butes depends entirely on the research questions asked ; (b) functional interpretations are most reliable at the level of more inclusive tool classes (CLOSE, 1978: 234; GORING-MORRIS, 1987 : 54); (c) general functions (e.g. "grinding") must be dis- tinguished from specific functions ("grain grinding"). Microwear and residue analyses may prove useful for ground stone (ADAMS, 1989; JONES, 1990). See WRIGHT, 1992. (12) Cf. BAR-YOSEF, 1970 : 17. (13) DUNNELL, 1971. (14) WRIGHT, 1991, 1992 in press. The classification is in- tended primarily for Levantine material, but parallels are cited from elsewhere in the Near East. The ground stone assemblages from which this classification was developed come from the fol- lowing sites : UWAYNID 18, JILAT 6, JILAT 8, AZRAQ 17, JI- LAT 22, AZRAQ 32, WADI HAMMEH 27, AZRAQ 18, BEIDHA (NATUFIAN), BEIDHA (PPNB), JILAT 7, JILAT 32, JILAT 26, BA'JA, AZRAQ 31 (PPNB), DHUWEILA (PPNB), AZRAQ 31 5LATE NEOLITHIC), DHUWEILA (LATE NEOLITHIC), JI- LAT 25, JILAT 13, AIN GHAZAL (PPNC + YARMOUKI AN) , ABU HAMID. Unpublished material from AIN MALLAHA, BAS- TA and AIN GHAZAL (PPNB) was also made available to the author. Direct examination of ground stone artifacts from these sites was supplemented by examination of published assemblages. The classification used here was developed from these sources. Forthcoming reports by this author on specific Levantine assem- blages employ a slightly briefer version of the typology given here (e.g. WRIGHT, 1992). (15) BORDES, 1961; TIXIER, 1963; BAR-YOSEF, 1970. (c) Wherever possible, type names should em- ploy terms commonly used in the literature. This typology depends on (a) definitions of raw material properties; (b) definitions of technological terms; (c) definitions of "anatomical" terms for de- scribing individual tools; (d) definitions of vari- ables; (e) a type list; and (f) definitions of classes (types). These are presented below. RAW MATERIAL PROPERTIES Ground stone involves diverse raw materials and there may be relationships between stone and tool types. Physical properties affecting these patterns may include hardness, density, brittleness and rough- ness. Some of the most common raw materials used in Levantine ground stone technology are as fol- lows : Flint. Flint is hard (Mohs = 7) and brittle with high compressive strength and low tensile strength (16). Low resistance to deformation by an impact, conchoidal fracture and fine texture permit predictability in flaking. These qualities make flint disadvantageous for grinding tools, unless the sur- face is roughened via battering. Flint would be best for pounding tools requiring an edge ("pecking stones", "choppers"). Basalt. Feldspar basalts are softer than flint (Mohs = 6); flaking is less controlled due to hete- rogeneous texture. Basalt has lower compressive and higher tensile strength than flint and is more resis- tant to deformation (17). Making vesicular basalt artifacts with stone tools requires "pics" of denser materials with greater compressive strength, but they need not be harder. Nonvesicular basalts have these qualities (18). Vesicular basalt has a natural, durable roughness that limits the need for re-pecking after grinding. Grits are not easily detached and basalt thus permits long use-lives for grinding tools. Sandstone. Quartzitic sandstone is hard (Mohs = 7) and can be flaked (with less control than flint, as a result of its coarse, heterogeneous texture). Coarse sandstones erode quickly under abrasion, a drawback for long-lived grinding tools, since roughening will be required. Sandstone probably played a key role in manufacture (abrasion) of ground stone tools. Limestone. Limestone is soft (Mohs = 1-3.5) but not brittle. Flaking is easily accomplished but edges are quickly dulled. Hard limestone resists deformation by an impact. These qualities make (16) Discussion of raw material properties is based on SPETH, 1972 : Table 1. (17) SPETH, 1972 : Table 1. (18) HAYDEN, 1987 : 18. 54</page><page sequence="3">FIG. 1. - Techniques in ground stone lithic reduction. limestone useful for pounding tools, if long-term durability is not needed. Most limestones are easily smoothed and require much repecking if used for grinding. Granite. Granite is a hard (Mohs = 6-7), por- phyritic igneous rock composed largely of silica quartz and alkali feldspars. Under abrasion, some granites easily lose surface roughness and would require repecking if used for grinding tools. Particles are not easily detached, however, and thus ground products would remain relatively free of grit. Quartzite. Quartzite is a hard (Mohs = 7) meta- morphosed sandstone. Flaking of fine-grained homo- geneous quartzites can be almost as easily controlled as flint. Coarser quartzites of heterogeneous textures permit less control in flaking; but the coarseness may be desirable if the intended use of the tool is for grinding. An important determinant of tool forms is the size of raw material blocks available for tool pro- duction (19). Variations in the form of an original nodule or block exerted a strong influence on sizes and shapes of ground stone tools at certain Levantine prehistoric sites (20). (19) Cf. TOTH, 1985. (20) WRIGHT, 1992. TECHNOLOGICAL TERMS Terms for ground stone reduction follow many of the definitions used for chipped stone. Where they are identical, previously published definitions are cited. Figure 1 illustrates reduction techniques and the traces they produce on artifacts. The usages in this study differ slightly from previous ones (21). The scheme below encompasses a variety of possible reduction alternatives and is intended to be general enough to account for the reduction of most artifact types. Table 1 shows a working scheme for describ- ing reduction stages. Detailed discussion of ground stone technology is given elsewhere (22) ; only a summary of relevant terms is given here. Nodule = raw material from which reduction begins.

Splitting = quarrying (via wedging and pound- ing) from bedrock. Flaking = detachment of flakes either for use as blanks or as debitage from a core to be used as a blank. Secondary Reduction/Roughout = shaping of pre- form (31) Coarse flaking = removal of medium to large flakes (ca. 30-200 mm). Pecking = removal of amorphous pecking frag- ments ("pecking shatter") from a stable tar- get blank, via short percussions directed at random angles to the blank (see fig. 1). Retouch/Thinning = preform thinning and final shaping (32) Edge/Margin Retouch (33) Retouch of accomodation(34) Retouch of shaping (34) = any gracile flaking which produces small flakes or microflakes (&lt; 30 mm) in shaping the artifact. Pecking = as above but more gracile and regular in spacing. Grinding = preform abrasion = removal of micro- scopic rock particles. Drilling = removal of particles via rotary motion of a pointed object directed at 90 degrees into a stable target (fig. 1). Coarse grinding (35) (fig. 1). Fine grinding (35) Incising = cutting of narrow grooves (fig. 1). Finishing = final, nonfunctional surface treatment. Polishing = production of smooth surface which reflects light and is visible to the naked eye. Incising = as above. Relief decoration = additional grinding on a non-functional surface to produce decorative patterns in relief. (26) TIXIER, 1974 : 5.

Rim or Base finishing = abrasion producing symmetrical rim or base. Fire-treatment = any intentional firing of stone. Use = reduction through use Grinding = as above. Pounding = percussion directed through a blunt surface (fig. 1). Battering = percussion of a mobile tool with angular edges blunted by impact against a stable target. Battering scars are internal fractures from percussion force directed into the moving tool. They are usually wedge- shaped and slightly hollow (fig. 1). Chopping = percussion directed through a sharp edge at 90 degrees to the target (fig. 1). Cutting = slicing with cutting edge perpendicu- lar to the target, along a path parallel to the cutting edge (fig. 1). Chiseling = cutting with sharp edge at angle less than 90 degrees to target along a path per- pendicular to cutting edge of the tool. Resharpening = modification of working surface Edge rejuvenation (36) = resetting an edge on a cutting tool using the same process as orig- inally. Repecking = rejuvenation of the roughness of a grinding surface. Ridge reduction = marginal flaking to expose more working surface in an artifact with a heavily-used concave use surface. Transformation = modification into new tools (37) Outils a posteriori = tools made on raw nodules unmodified by primary or secondary reduc- tion (38) Core tools = tools made on core blanks. Flake tools = tools made on flake blanks.

The rationale is that concavity and convexity of certain tools would change with prolonged use (40). To measure curva- ture, the limits of the use surface were located. Using a profile gauge, the long cross-section of the surface was traced onto graph paper. A straight line from each end of the surface was drawn (= LAF, or "Length of Active Face"). Perpendiculars were drawn extending to the use surface (dl, d2, d3) (fig. 4). For a convex surface, the "depth" measure- (40) Cf. BARTLETT, 1933; VOIGT, 1983 : 247.

Metric variables used in construction of the typology are shown in figure 3. Of the nominal variables used in the typology, the most important are the following : Shape of Use Surface in Transverse Section Flat Concave, dished Concave, U Concave, V Convex, arc Convex, rounded Convex, beveled Sinuous Circular (perforations) Number of Use Surfaces Unifacial Bifacial Unipolar Bipolar Multifacial Shape of Use Surface in Long Section Flat Concave, dished Concave, U Concave, V Convex, arc Convex, rounded Convex, beveled Sinuous Biconical (perforations) Cylindrical (perforations) Relationship of Use Surfaces Opposed Adjacent Superimposed ments dl, d2, and d3 were assigned negative values.

Grinding slabs/querns (fig. 4 : 1-12 b) Lower, stationary stone in a pair of grinding tools. Most grinding is in a plane parallel to the side on which artifact rests. Blank : variable. Preform : variable. Use surfaces : broad, long in plan; concave or flat in section; may have striae. Heaviest wear from grinding is at deepest part of face. "Grinding slabs" have rectangular use surfaces or wear striae indicating lateral grinding in a linear path. "Querns" have oval use surfaces or wear striae indicating rotary grinding in an oval path (42). Each type in- cludes subtypes (a) unifacial; (b) bifacial; (c) multi- facial. No. 1 Block Quern Blank : unmodified tabular-stone boulder with naturally stable base. Preform : not applicable. Use surface : unifacial, oval in plan, dished or U- shaped in section. Surface is "closed" (surrounded on all sides) and small relative to blank (length of surface less than 50 % of length of artifact). No ridges; face is set into blank without other modification (43). No. 2 Block Grinding Slab As No. 1, but use surface rectangular; striae indicate lateral grinding. No. 3 Boulder Quern Blank : unmodified irregular boulder, no primary reduction; lacks naturally stable base. Preform : not (42) In the literature, terms for grinding slabs and querns are extremely variable (e.g. "grinding stone" "metate", "meule", "répercutant", etc. Although the term "quern" is widely em- ployed to refer to a rotary handmill such as used since historic times (HOLE et al., 1969 : 170; RUNNELS, 1981), there was a need for a term to distinguish more primitive grinding tools in- volving rotary motion from those involving lateral grinding. "Quern" was considered acceptable. For French equivalents, ROUX (1985 : 45) uses "meule plane" and "meule-mortier" but these terms would be misleading in the scheme used here. Conse- quently, the term "meule" is used here as an equivalent of grin- ding slab (lateral motion) and "moulin" is used as the equivalent of "quern" (rotary motion). Neither the English "quern" nor the French "moulin" is entirely satisfactory but these seem to be the best terms available. (43) Cf. CLUZAN, 1984 : fig. 65, 2; WRIGHT, 1992 : fig. 5- 10, a. applicable. Use surface : as No. 1, but use surface may extend to edges of the boulder (44). No. 4 Boulder Grinding Slab As No. 3, but use surface rectangular; striae imply lateral grinding (45). No. 5 Saddle-shaped Quern Blank : variable. Preform : pecked or flaked on side opposite use surface. Opposed lateral sides par- allel; has concave/convex ("saddle") shape. Use sur- face : oval in plan, "dished" in long section. Surface extends to sides and ends of blank and is thus "open." No ridges (46). No. 6 Saddle-shaped Grinding Slab As No. 5, but use surface rectangular; striae imply lateral grinding (47). No. 7 Trough Quern Blank : core or unmodified boulder. Preform : flaked or pecked. Use surface : oval in plan, S- shaped in long section, curving downward from "shelf' at high proximal end to an opening at the thin distal end. Side walls may rise steeply from the use surface. May have flake scars on lateral ridges, for reduction of side walls. Surface is thus large relative to blank, "closed" on three sides, open on one side. Base usually unstable (48). No. 8 Trough Grinding Slab As No. 7, but use surface rectangular; striae indicate lateral grinding (49). (44) Cf. DAVIS, 1982 : fig. 3.7, 6; NIERLÉ, 1983 : PI. 6, 71. (45) Cf.

The exclusion of flint axes and celts from this typology is arbitrary. The chief technological difference be- tween flint and non-flint axes/celts lies in the role of pecking and grinding/polishing in manufacture. Pecking is not used for flint celts and grinding is often limited to the bit (75). The classification here modifies types defined by Roodenberg (76). Roodenberg distinguishes manufacturing striae on the bit (visible to the naked eye) from use-wear striae (visible at 40x), but it is not clear that this distinction can be consistently applied. Resharpening and reuse often obscure use- wear traces. Here, the categories of traces on the bit are all defined as visible to the naked eye. They include : presence/absence of polishing, grinding, flake scars and whether flake scars are superimposed on a polished bit (or vice versa). These may reflect manufacture, use or resharpening. Roodenberg's types also incorporate percussion traces on the butt. Here, these categories include flaking and pecking. (75) Thus, terminology used here differs from that of MOR- TENSEN, 1970.

Stone vessels (fig. 11) Vessels must have (1) a well-defined, uniform rim; (2) a well-defined base; (3) a continuous ex- terior surface ; (4) consistent (or gradually changing) thickness of walls; (5) exterior finishing. A vessel fragment must have a definite rim or base, or walls of continuously changing thickness and exterior fin- ishing. Classifications are based on relationships be- tween vessel height (HGT), outer rim diameter (RDO), inner rim diameter (RDI), depth (DPTH) and the openness of the walls (see figure 4 for definitions of metric variables). These are considered to reflect lithic reduction and possible ranges of function. Each vessel category may exist in (a) "fine wares" (maximum wall thickness &lt; 20 mm) or (b) "coarse wares" (maximum wall thickness &gt; 20 mm). These can be refined for specific assemblages (100). No. 114 Platter Shallow vessel with large ratio of outer rim diameter to height (RDO/HGT &gt;3) and large ratio of inner rim diameter to depth (RDI/DPTH &gt; 3). Base flat or rounded; walls splayed or upright. Size variable, but RDI exceeds 100 mm. Variants may include (i) oval platters with convex walls; (ii) oval platters with upright walls ; (iii) rectangular platters with convex walls; (iv) rectangular platters with upright walls, etc (101). No. 115 "Potlid" Platter Vessel with large ratio of outer rim diameter to height (RDO/HGT &gt; 3) and little or no depth, i.e. a circular or rectilinear slab with only a slight de- pression. Base is flat and sides upright or slightly convex (102). (100) Stone vessel typologies vary significantly. For a detai- led review, see WRIGHT, 1992. Most typologies are based on a mixture of criteria, e.g. profile shape, base shape, artifact size (ADAMS, 1983; DORRELL, 1983; MOUTON, 1984; ROODEN- BERG, 1986; EPSTEIN, 1988), but employ different definitions and terminology. This is because they are in reality groupings of artifacts from one or two sites, instead of true classifications (DUNNELL, 1972). The classification given here is intentionally general and does not attempt to be comprehensive for all varia- tions. Many artifacts called mortars in the literature are more ac- curately described as vessel-mortars, since they exhibit fine finishing, rims and bases, and continuous or gradually changing wall thickness. Many Kebaran through Natufian artifacts found in archaeological association with pestles, or with other evidence suggesting their use as mortars, should be classified as such. Here, these artifacts would be classified according to the vessel typo- logy, but with the name "vessel-mortar." For example : PERROT, 1966 : fig. 15, 14; fig. 16, 1 (No. 124, Solid-foot Vessel-Mortar); RONEN et al, 1975 : fig. 9 (No. 119, V-shaped Bowl-Mortar). Note that the more general category of "bowl mortars" (No. 16) refers to small mortars lacking fine finishing, rims, bases and continuous or gradually changing wall thickness. (101) Cf.

CONCLUSION Ground stone artifacts are an underused source of information about technology, subsistence and social relationships in the prehistoric Levant. It is hoped that the foregoing will encourage better, more consistent descriptions of ground stone artifacts, es- pecially in preliminary site reports. It is also hoped that excavators will preserve such artifacts without washing them (since residue studies may prove suc- cessful in determining tool functions) (118) and that possible debitage (e.g. non-flint flakes and nodules) will be conserved when encountered in archaeologi- cal deposits.
