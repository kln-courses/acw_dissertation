<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF 'LIVING LANGUAGE' IN CINQUECENTO VERNACULAR PHILOLOGY Ferdinand Brunot, in his Histoire de la langue franFaise, the equivalent of which for the Italian language is so sadly lacking, observes with regard to the sixteenth century: D'abord les efforts que firent les ciceroniens pour restituer la langue latine dans sa puretd antique contribuerent A l'abolir comme langue vivante. and he concludes: ... lui imposer la circonlocution au moyen des mots de Ciceron, meme en y ajoutant ceux du Ier siecle, c'etait le tuer.1 What Brunot might have done, but did not in fact do, was to go on to point out that the very conception he was using was itself the product of the sixteenth century. Nor did Remigio Sabbadini before him, who discussed the same subject in much the same terms, draw attention to the fact that the conception of the 'life' of languages is a product of the Renaissance in Italy.2 Like many other modern philologists, they must have been so accustomed to using it that it did not occur to them to examine it historically.3 This is hardly surprising when we recall that the origins of the concept of 'living language' appear to have been overlooked, not only by those who have studied the history of linguistic thought in general, but even by the long line of those who have written about the Italian questione della lingua. Certainly no one has observed that the terms lingua viva and lingua morta are not used in the earliest writings on the vernacular in the Cinquecento, whereas later in the century they appear as universally accepted technical terms of vernacular philology.4 Here we need only mention, in support of this statement, that they are included by Varchi in his table of classifications of languages in the third quesito of his Ercolano and that Foglietta uses them in his De linguae latinae usu etpraestantia.5 The first purpose of this article is to show how the general conception of the 'life' and 'death' of languages began and how it evolved until the two complementary concepts of 'living language' and 'dead language' were established.6 From such 1 F.

Cf. pp. 75, 76. 3 To remove any doubts about whether 'living language' is a technical term or only a loosely used metaphor we may quote from J. Marouzeau, Lexiqnle de la terminologie linguistique (Paris, 1943), under LANGUE: 'Une langue vivante (Lebendige Sprache, Living language) est celle qui sert aux besoins actuels; une langue morte (Tote Sprache, Dead language) celle qui est hors d'usage, ou du moins qui n'est plus employee que comme langue ecrite par des initi6s qui lui assurent une survie factice.' 4 One writer came near to touching on the problem when he noted that 'theories of language itself as an independent organism were present in some Cinquecento thinking'. Cf. R. A. Hall Jr., The Italian 'questione della lingua' (Chapel Hill, 1942), p. 35. The value of Professor Hall's work appears to have been insufficiently ap- preciated in Italy, largely owing to some un- justifiably hostile reviews of it in its earlier form by the late Professor Giulio Bertoni.

Thus both the concepts 'living language' and 'dead language' are part of the vitalistic conception of languages.</page><page sequence="2">R. GLYNN FAITHF'ULL 279 an analysis it may then be possible to proceed to some observations on the role of symbols in the evolution of ideas and the process whereby technical terms come to be formed. It must be emphasized that we are here concerned with the conception of com- plete languages as living or dead and not merely with that of decay within any given language. The latter conception goes back to classical times, back at least to Horace who introduces it into his Ars poetica in the famous lines: ... mortalia facta peribunt Nedum sermonum stet honos et gratia vivax. Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere, cadentque Quae nune sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus, Quem penes arbitrium est et ius et norma loquendi. (vv. 68-72) Horace, however, is concerned with the life of words, not with the life of a language as a whole. Greek and Roman culture, not being linked through written records and literary heritage to earlier cultures whose languages were no longer spoken, had no conception of 'dead languages' and 'living languages'. The same was true of the Dark and Middle Ages, except in one purely theoretical field, that of the arguments deriving from Judaeo-Christian thought about the original universal language of the newly created world, in connexion with which a tentative approach was made towards the concept of 'dead language '.1 Thus Dante, in the Paradiso, makes Adam say: LTa. linlyta. ih' in na,rlg.i fu, tutta asnntf,a innanzi che all' ovra inconsummabile fosse la gente di Nembrot attenta... (xxvi, 124 ff.) Yet Dante's choice of tile verb spegnere, which he uses to mean 'disappearing completely'-as of a light going out or a soul departing-reveals that the essential element, namely the (lead remains of a once living body, is missing: in other words Adam's language left no written records.2 It was in the Renaissance that Italian vernacular philologists catne to recognize Latin as 'dead' and Italian as 'living'. It may therefore be taken as critical for our study to establish at whlat period the two related terms first appeared together in the same passage, since this is when the conception reaches a complete form.3 We can now begin our study by examining the negative evidence provided by the absence of the concept of 'living language' in early Cinquecento writings on the vernacular. In the first place an examination of these writings shows that the 1 Cf. P. Rotta, La filosofia del lilnguaygio nella patristica e nella scolastica (Turin, 1909), pp. 78 ff. 2 Cf. F. D'Ovidio,' Determinismo e linguistica', in Nuova Antologia, cxxii (1892), pp. 101-4, and also 'Dante e la filosofia (del linguaggio', in Studi sulla Divina Cornmedia (Milan and Palermo, 1901), pp. 486-508. It is interesting to note, since our study concerns the change in con- ceptions of general linguistics which resulted from the rise of vernacular philology, that D'Ovidio considered the change in Dante's views on Adam's language between the writing of the De vulgari eloquentia and Paradiso xxvI to be due to Dante's study of the (levelopment of the vernacular. For a few further points, cf. B. Nardi, Dante e la cultura mediecale (Bari, 1942), pp. 171-5. It may be noted that in the same article (p. 159) Nardi attempts, quite unhistori- cally, to attribute the concept of 'dead language' to Dante. 3 It is not possible to use a strictly chrono- logical method in examining the material because so many of the works with which we are con- cerned (including several of the most important ones) circulated in manuscript form for many years before publication and exact information about their date of composition is not available. A useful but not entirely satisfactory attempt to compile a chronological table has been made by L. Kukenheim, Contributions a I'histoire de la graonnaire italienne, espagnole et francaise (Amsterdam, 1932), pp. 219-23. R. A. Hall has improved on this in a number of details. Cf. op. cit. pp. 57-61.</page><page sequence="3">280 The Concept of 'Living Language' adjective viva, in the sense defined above, is not applied to the noun lingua. Bembo, for instance, describes the vernacular as vicina, natia, propria, naturale and domestica as opposed to Latin, which he calls lontana, straniera, istrana and non naturale. That he does not think of Italian and Latin as differing according to a principle of life is shown by his comparing their use in sixteenth-century Italy to that of Latin and Greek in ancient Rome.l Again, Fortunio, although he reveals in his section on Italian orthography a clear idea of linguistic change 'nelle volgari voci del latino discendenti', evidently thinks of Latin and Italian as co-existing and nowhere uses the term lingua viva.2 Liburnio, in spite of the keen interest in the current popular idiom which he displays in the third book of his lolgari eleganze, also does not use it. He mentions the passage we have quoted from Horace's Ars poetica yet it is significant that he does so, not when referring to Latin, but when discussing 'la mirabile mutazione di vocaboli dalla eta di messer Dante, Petrarca e Boccaccio infin all'odierno giorno'.3 Machiavelli devotes a few penetrating comments to the subject of linguistic change, mentioning that languages either 'col tempo... imbastardiscono e diventano altra cosa' or change rapidly as a result of invasions. Nevertheless, after a reference to Latin and Greek, he leaves the subject as irrelevant 'per non essere la nostra lingua ancora nella sua declinazione'.4 His conception here comes near to that of 'living language' but he also does not in fact use the term lingua viva. Finally, we may add that similar negative evidence has been established in the case of Trissino's Grammatichetta and Castellano, and for those sections referring to language in Equicola's Libro de natura de amore and in Castiglione's Cortegiano. It can also be stated that in these same authors just mentioned the term lingua morta is similarly absent. Yet here again we have one case in which the general conception of the life of languages appears to be emerging. Castiglione, after paraphrasing the passage from Horace quoted above, adds: Considerate che della lingua Osca non avemo piu notizia alcuna. La Provenzale, che pur mo, si po dir, era celebrata da nobili scrittori, ora dagli abitanti di quel paese non e intesa.5 Although the coupling of Oscan (which to Castiglione was an almost completely unknown language) with Provengal shows some confusion, he is clearly giving examples of what he considers to be the effect of the mortality of human affairs in the sphere of speech, thereby extending Horace's conception from words to languages. The next case to be considered is also one in which clear concepts have not yet emerged. Claudio Tolomei, in his Polito, while dealing with the subject of Italian orthography, makes the following statement when he turns to consider Greek and Latin characters: Abbiamo serbata la scrittura e 1' ortografia greca e latina ne' libri loro, ma il ben pronuntiarla, perche si posava nella voce di chi viveva, non s' e potuto mantenere: anzi raffreddandosi per morte le lingue di chi ben proferiva e sopragiungendo chi con 1 Prose della volgar lingua, ed.

GLYNN FAITHFSULL 281 le voci barbare corruppe ogni bel parlare, gli e stato forza cedere alla dura ingiuria della fortuna e insieme co' maestri suoi miseramente seppellirsi.1 Here it is important to note that although Tolomei uses lingue morte he is using lingue only in the primary sense of 'tongues' and not in the metaphorical sense of 'languages'. It would seem almost that he is being careful not to use the metaphor of 'living language'. Nevertheless, in his Cesano Tolomei does not hesitate to use it: Nondimeno a me non par giusta cosa lasciarci dalle costor inique mani ingiuriosamente percuotere e la nostra lingua, nel pid bel fior degli anni suoi, quando ella piti viva si mostra, per morta seppellire.2 After this examination of the early writings in which the concepts of 'living language' and 'dead language' do not appear as clearly established we now come to the author who appears to have been the first to use both terms without qualification and in the same passage. He is Alessandro Citolini, whose Lettera in difesa della lingua volgare was first published in Venice in 1540. In this work we find the following: ... essi parlano di queste due lingue come s'elle fossero in un me(lesimo termine e non s'avveggono che la latina e morta e sepolta ne' libri; e che la volgare 6 viva e tiene ora in Italia quel medesimo luogo che tenne la latina mentre visse.3 Again, in the same work, we find the following: Ella e viva, e come viva, cresce, genera, crea, produce, partorisce e sempre si fa p)i ricca e piu abbondante. Percioch6 non e cosi tosto venuta in luce alcuna (lellk cose cle di di in di nascer si veggono ch'ella 8 vestita di vocabolo volgare.... E benche questi vocaboli non sieno ancora tutti stati dipinti su per le carte, non son perer r p(luti come quelli dalla latina che non si trovano scritti, ma sono di continuo in bocca della vivente favella.4 That the concept of 'living language' is now firmly established is shown by its extension in the series of verbs, crescere, generare, creare, produrre, partorire. Moreover, the final sentence shows that both the concepts with which we are concerned are established in the sense in which they have continued to be used until modern times: 'dead language' does not mean an extinct language of which nothing remains, but one accessible only in written records, while 'living language' includes every spoken word and not just the literary usage of a language still spoken. In the past due attention has not been paid to the work of Alessandro Citolini by those who have studied the Italian questione della lingua and little has been known about him. Although recently Dr L. Fessia has done much to remedy this lack, a correct assessment of his influence on Italian vernacular philology has still to be made.5 Certainly Citolini displays a lasting interest in problems of language. 1 II Polito di Adriano Franci etc. (Venice, of Tolomei, who appears as one of the inter- 1531), f.

From Tolomei's letters to Citolini it can be clearly seen that Citolini was the debtor in the matter of ideas. In one of them Tolomei mentions the loan to Citolini of 'l'operetta mia de' due SS' and says that he is sending him 'due orazioncelle'. Tolomei also reveals that Citolini has written to him for his theories on the letter H: De lo H di cui mi domandate e pregate, io ragiono a pieno ne' libri de' principi de la lingua toscana. Ma per parlarvene or con brevitd dico ...2 We may therefore conclude that although to Citolini falls the credit of having been the first writer who clearly formulated the concepts of 'living language' and 'dead language', he may well have taken the general conception from Tolomei, that fertile source of original ideas about language, to whom other Cinquecento vernacular philologists were also to be indebted. Before proceeding further to examine the evolution of the vitalistic conception of language it is now necessary to observe that the term 'living' did not have the same connotation in the sixteenth century as it has to us moderns. In the inter- vening centuries new sciences of inorganic and organic chemistry, of biology and biochemistry have come into being and have greatly altered conceptions of what may be considered as living. To understand what was meant by lingua viva in sixteenth-century Italy we must move mentally into a world in which our element mercury was argento vivo3 and stagnant (as opposed to fresh) water was acqua morta. It was a time when Cardano could seriously maintain that metals and stones were alive: they could be considered, he argued, as 'buried plants' which were 'born' underground, growing like plants or like bones in animals by means of their 'veins and instruments of nourishment'.4 If, after analysing the conception of life in contemporary natural science, we turn to Cinquecento theories of vernacular philology we can at once observe that similar concepts of 'generation' and 'growth' play a central role. We must note that the former concept is used before the appearance of the term lingua viva. We find it in Bembo's Prose: ...E, lasciando le altre parti da canto, se la nostra volgar lingua non era a que' tempi nata, ne' quali la latina fiori, quando e in che modo nacque ella? Ilquando, rispose M. Federigo, sapere appunto, che io mi creda, non si puo, se non si dice che ella 1 Almost nothing is known of Marcellino and course preserved in the etymology of the older in fact his name does not even appear in some English term quicksilver. modern bibliographies of Italian literature and 4 Cf.

Del come, non si puo errare a dire che, essendo la romana lingua e quelle de' Barbari tra se lontanissime, essi a poco a poco della nostra ora une ora altre voci, e queste troncamente e imperfettamente pigliando, e noi apprendendo similmente delle loro, se ne formasse in processo di tempo e nascessene una nuova... 1 Now this is pure Aristotelian natural philosophy as far as the underlying conception is concerned. Bembo is using the fundamental conception of the De corruptione et generatione that 'every coming-to-be is a passing-away of something else'.2 He is arguing that from the mixture of unlike substances, namely Latin and the languages of the barbarians, a new one, Italian, was born. That he is thinking, moreover, in vitalistic terms, is shown by the remainder of the passage, in which he goes on to argue that the dominance of the Latin over the barbarian component was due to conditio regionis: La qual se piu somiglianza ha con la romana che con le barbare avere non si vede, e percio che la forza del natio cielo sempre e molta, e in ogni terra meglio mettono le piante che naturalmente vi nascono che quelle che vi sono di lontan paese portate.3 The same conception of generatio appears in Castiglione's Cortegiano but here it is more clearly expounded in a form which comes nearer to the actual technical terms of Aristotelian natural philosophy: E primamente dico che, secondo il mio giudicio, questa nostra lingua, che noi chiamiamo vulgare, e ancor tenera e nova, benche gia gran tempo si costumi; perche, per essere stata la Italia non solamente vessata e depredata, ma lungamente abitata da' barbari, per lo commercio di quelle nazioni la lingua latina s' e corrotta e guasta, e da quella corruzione son nate altre lingue.4 In Tolomei's Cesano, however, the terms become quite explicit: Cosi furono cagione di corrompervi in tutto la lingua prima e in Toscana lasciarvene una che dell' antica etrusca un poco, della latina assai, e di questa forestiera lingua in parte fosse composta e ne e seguito che forse contra la voglia loro la corruzione di quelle n' ha un' altra molto leggiadra e molto abile generata. The metaphor then hardens into a scientific exposition and the implied argument by analogy becomes a special case of a general natural law: Perche siccome la generazione di qualunque cosa l'uomo si vogli non puo natural- mente esser senza la corruzione di qualcun' altra, cosi parimente la corruzione delle cose e sempre vera ragion della generazione dell'altre nobili..... There is no need to give many examples of the concept of 'growth' in language since it follows on naturally from that of 'generation' and indeed-to use the words of J. C. Scaliger-can be considered as the generationis continuatio.6 We may note, however, that it also appears before the term lingua viva comes into use. Bembo, for example, not only uses, in the passage quoted above,7 the verb crescere but also 1 Op. cit. p. 10. 2 i. 3. 319a. 4 Op. cit. pp. 76, 77. 3 Op. cit. p. 10.

But this is not a question, by the very nature of the phenomena involved, that can be answered in isolation with any degree of precision. It belongs to the wider problems of the evolution of humanism and the breakdown of medieval conceptions of language. We can begin our approach to this new question by noting that the earliest vernacular philologists failed to recognize their language as new: to them the novelty consisted only in using it for literary purposes. Thus Dante, far from considering Italian as something generated from Latin, considers Latin as some- thing artificially abstracted from the pre-existing, natural vernacular: ... dicimus... quod vulgarem locutionem appellamus earn, quam infantes adsuefiunt ab adsistentibus, cum primitus distinguere voces incipiunt; vel quod brevius dici potest, vulgarem locutionem asserimus, quam sine omni regula, nutricem imitantes, accipimus. Est et inde alia locutio secundaria nobis, quam Romani grammaticam vocaverant.2 What was to a large extent Dante's viewpoint survived at least until the first half of the fifteenth century. Leonardo Bruni, in his famous letter to Flavio Biondo in 1435, although he does not consider that Latin is locutio secundaria, at least believes the two languages to have existed side by side from ancient to modern times and considers Italian to be much the same as the sermo plebeius of ancient Rome.3 That this belief was in process of breaking down, however, is shown by the great dispute which arose on the subject.4 Already in Biondo's reply we find the idea of the vernacular as a new 'mixed' language resulting from the invasions of the Goths and Vandals: ...sensimque factum est, ut pro romana latinitate adulterinam hanc barbarica mixtam loquelam habeamus vulgarem.5 It is noteworthy, however, that in the main this controversy was a dispute of classical philologists rather than vernacular philologists: those taking part in it are not primarily interested in the origins of the vernacular. Even Leon Battista Alberti is chiefly concerned with the loss of Latin, 'la nostra prima cultissima et emendatissima lingua'. 1 This concept of 'stato' is later fully de- 2 De vulgari doquentia I, i, ?? 2, 3. veloped by G. B. Gelli who defines it as follows: 3 Cf.

GLYNN FAITHFULL 285 In order to understand the philological theories of such men as Alberti and Biondo we must turn once again to the conceptions of contemporary natural philosophy. It is necessary to know that of the four kinds of change recognized by Aristotle in his De generatione et corruptione1 another, besides generatio, is relevant, namely alteratio. Generatio means a change in substance, alteratio a change in accidents. Not all corruption therefore leads to the creation of something substantially different. Thus the failure of the Biondo school of Quattrocento philologists to think of the vernacular as something new, even after they had come to realize that it had not existed ab antique, suggests that they thought of the change from Latin to Italian as a case of alteratio. This is in fact implied, if not formally stated, by Alberti: Fu Italia piu volte occupata e posseduta da varie nazioni, Gallici, Gothi, Vandali, Longobardi e altre simili barbare e molto asprissime genti. E, come necessita o volonta inducea, i popoli, parte per bene essere intesi parte per far piu ragionando piacere a chi essi obediano, cosi apprendevano quella o quell'altra lingua forastiera, e quelli strani e adventizi uomini il simile se consuefaceano alla nostra, credo con molti barbarismi e corruptela del proferire. Onde per questa mistura di di in di insalvatichi e viziossi la nostra prima e cultissima e emendatissima lingua.2 Here, the terms used-corruptela, insalvatichire, viziarsi-reveal clearly that Alberti is thinking in terms of alteratio: he sees Italian merely as a corrupted form of Latin and not as something newly generated.3 We may now note that in the early Cinquecento these two theories represent the opposing viewpoints of the classical and the vernacular philologists. The conflict between the two schools of thought is in fact the crucial issue of Tolomei's Cesano. Here we find a statement of the alteratio theory in preparation for its refutation in favour of the generatio theory: Coloro che dicono non esser questa, di che si ragiona, propria lingua, ne tale, che da pregiati ingegni si debbia per bella onorare, o pure in conto alcuno tenersi, sono spinti da una non so che ragione, la quale gli persuade, che ella altro non sia, che lingua latina corrotta, non gia nuova, che per nobile generazione nata sia, perche veggiono, che ella ne' nomi ne' verbi, negli avverbi si conserva quasi tutti i vocaboli latini, ma guasti e corrotti, come molto facil cosa i conoscere a chi pur un poco vi discorre. Onde in quella foggia, che un bel pomo, che poscia s'infracidi e si corrompa, benche la prima sua forma in un'altra trasmuti, in ogni modo pomo guasto e corrotto si chiama, n6 punto s'apprezza, perch6 di tal corruzione non se n'e cosa generata, che degna sia, cosi, distruggendosi per la scorsa de' barbari, la lingua latina e rimasa in questo modo, che oggi l'usiamo stroppiata e caduta talmente, che niuno fiorito ingegno devria in questa affaticarsi, essendo debile e indisposta, ma ingegnarsi di riguadagnare con ogni suo studio il candore, la purita, la vaghezza della romana lingua....4 1 I. 4. 319b-320a.

We find it continuing in much the same terms throughout the century and we may quote as an example of its later treatment Varchi's sixth questio: 'Se la lingua volgare e una nuova lingua da se, o pure l'antica latina guasta e corrotta'.l These then are the changing forms of thought which lead to the emergence of the concept of 'living language'. Much more could be said about the process, especially about the part played in it by the humanistic classical philologists in killing-to use Brunot's phrase-Latin.2 Our analysis of the writings of the vernacular philologists, however, provides enough evidence for us to be able to reconstruct in summary form some of the stages in the evolution of the concept. We can suggest tentatively the following: (a) An early stage in which the vernacular is seen as the primary, natural language existing ab initio with Latin as a secondary, artificial derivative. This stage is repre- sented by Dante's De vulgari eloquentia. (b) Italian and Latin seen as co-existing on different levels ab antique, the former being spoken by the lower classes. This is the position of Leonardo Bruni. (c) Italian seen as a derivative of Latin by a process of alteratio and considered as a corrupt form of Latin. This stage is represented by the writings in the dispute of 1435 of Flavio Biondo and Leon Battista Alberti. (d) Italian seen as a new creation by a process of generatio out of the corruption of Latin. This is the position of Bembo, Machiavelli, Castiglione and probably most of the other early Cinquecento vernacular philologists.3 (e) The elaboration of the generatio theory leads to the view of Latin as dead and the newly generated Italian as living. This general conception appears in Tolomei's works but the complementary concepts first appear in a dual formula in Citolini's Lettera in difesa della lingua volgare. It Would take up too much space here to trace in detail the subsequent develop- ments in the usage of lingua viva and lingua morta. We can only mention that the writings of Sperone Speroni and Valerio Marcellino among the north Italian group of vernacular philologists and Giovan Battista Gelli and Pierfrancesco Giambullari in Florence are important in this respect, while linking the two groups Tolomei continues to be the main source of ideas and inspiration. Before leaving the subject, however, it is well to note that Varchi saw fit to introduce a refinement by sub- dividing lingue morte into two categories: those morte affatto and those mezze vive. By 'completely dead' he means those of which no written records have survived 1 It would extend too far the scope of this to talk of the evolution of Italian as 'cor- article to follow up in detail the further develop- rompere e alterare' or 'alterazione'. ment of these two theories.

By 'semi-alive' he means the following: Alcune altre, sebbene non si favellano naturalmente da alcun popolo in luogo nessuno, si possono nondimeno imparare o da' maestri, o dai libri, e poi favellarle o scriverle, come sono la Greca e la Latina e ancora la Provenzale; e queste cosi fatte chiameremo mezze vive, perche dove quelle prime sono morte e nella voce e nelle scritture, non si favellando piu, e non s'intendono, queste seconde sono morte nella voce solamente, perche se non si favellano, s'intendono da chi apparare le vuole.1 It is a sign of Varchi's perspicacity as a philologist that he saw the illogicality of the new dualism and sought to find a middle term which would better interpret the relationship of tradition to innovation in language. There are, however, certain important implications and effects on subsequent evolution of vernacular philology which must be mentioned. The first of these is the addition of the concept of 'derived languages' to the general body of linguistic thought. Here once again we find ourselves confronted with the remarkable originality of Claudio Tolomei's genius. In a section of the Cesano he raises the question of languages 'nate dalla corruzione dell' altre'.2 This concept had yet further implications of prime importance in the history of linguistics. On the one hand it opened a path which led ultimately to the elimination of the traditional Christian doctrine of the fixed number of languages created at the destruction of the Tower of Babel-usually assessed at seventy-two-while on the other it cut across the Aristotelian theory of the ad placitum creation of languages. On the former point Tolomei, naturally enough, maintains a tactful reticence. On the latter he openly expresses doubts of its validity: Quelle, che primieramente furon da coloro, che in un paese viveano insieme, composte (se alcune furono, che io non so gia quali), ebbero l'arte maestra de' nomi loro: perche, ponendo a questa cosa un nome, a quella un altro, all'intero lor bisogno providdero, e in questa fatica forse avvenne che alcuni forse di migliore ingegno adornati, e da pii destro discorso guidati, s'ingegnarono tanto fare che tutti o la maggior parte di quei avessero in se viva e accesa ragione, perche cosi e non in altra guisa fussero posti.... Basti ben tanto, che creder si dee qualche lingua esser nata in quella guisa dall'arte, ch' io v' ho ragionato pur ora: ma queste, che dal corrompersi solo qualche altra lingua si creano, sono piu spesse, piu facili ad imaginarle, e vieppiu al proposito de' nostri ragionamenti.3 Nor does Tolomei stop at the level of these generalities. He proceeds to cite, not merely the origin of Italian, but also that of Spanish. Ne voglio per ora discorrere negli esempi di quelle, a cui cio e intervenuto, perche forse troppo di lunghezza e di fastidio senza molto bisogno v' arrecarei. Ma basti ne' tempi piu freschi il vederlo nella lingua spagnuola e nella nostra toscana, delle quali la prima si vede esser nata dalla corruzione della lingua latina e da quella della moresca. Conciossiacosache, essendo stata la Spagna molti e molti anni dalle genti more scorsa, abitata e comandata, le quali avevano lingua in tutto dagli uomini di quei paesi diversa, maraviglia non e se, l'una con l'altra mescolandosi, fece questa nascere, colla quale ne' tempi nostri in Spagna si parla. Cosi della toscana nostra diremo, la quale par che sia di tre o forse piu lingue, che stranamente si corroppero, composta: cioe dell'etrusca antica, della latina, che poi vi venne, della barbara e forestiera, portatavi dalle genti esterne, che nella infelice Italia ingiuriosamente trascorsero.4 Op. cit. p. 210. 2 Cesano, pp. 49 ff. 3 Ibid. pp. 49. 50. 4 Ibid. pp. 53, 54.</page><page sequence="11">288 The Concept of 'Living Language' Indeed, it is probably not an exaggeration to say that in this whole section of the Cesano devoted to 'derived languages' we have the foundations for the later development of comparative philology. Secondly, there are important developments in the concept of 'living language' in its relation to theories of literary diction. This is the questione della lingua proper, of which the implications as regards the history of general linguistics are in a sense incidental. We cannot here recapitulate the story of the conflict between the various viewpoints but we may note that the arguments very largely turn on how far contemporary spoken idiom and Trecento literary idiom can be harmonized. The foregoing analysis suggests that the usually accepted terms for these viewpoints, which were introduced by Labande-Jeanroy and accepted by R. A. Hall- ' archaistic', 'anti-archaistic', 'Tuscan' and 'anti-Tuscan' in various combinations1 -can with advantage be replaced by two simple terms: 'vitalistic ' and 'humanistic'. We propose, however, to leave the elaboration of this suggestion for the present and to give two further examples of the usage of lingua viva which illustrate it. In connexion with the former, the vitalistic, viewpoint we must mention the importance of Gelli's above-cited dialogue.2 In it he argues that 'living language' cannot be codified and reduced to rules: Di queste ultime due maniere, tengo io per cosa certa, che le morte si possono agevolmente mettere in regola: ma delle vive che e' non sia solamente difficile il farvi regola alcuna perfetta e vera, ma che e' sia quasi al tutto impossibile.3 The reason for this, Gelli argues, is that since a living language has not finished growing, it is not possible to decide whether its most perfect form-its stato or colmo-has yet been reached. This viewpoint leads him to reject Bembo's humanistic theory that for the criteria of Italian style the period of Boccaccio and Petrarch should be taken as equivalent to that of Cicero and Virgil in Latin.4 Marcellino goes still further and asserts that if the literary language is restricted to the vocabulary of fourteenth-century writers then the vernacular itself will be turned into a dead language: ...non per tanto io non intendo che lo scrittore, che s'ha da ingegnare di seguir costoro, non possa usar voce che essi non abbiano usata. Perciocche se egli altre voci che le loro non ardisse d'usare, farebbe questa nostra favella morta, dove ella e viva.5 It must be recognized, however, that not only do these revolutionary theories have little influence on the actual criteria used by the majority of Cinquecento prose-writers and poets, but also they fail to gain authoritative support. Their effect is that of marginal comments rather than that of a challenge to the prevailing stylistic doctrines. Ultimately the thesis of Bembo's Prose triumphs in so far as generally accepted theory is concerned; the rhetorico-literary principle of imitatio, transferred from the sphere of Latin to that of Italian, remains dominant. A new form of humanism, of which the Trecento authors form the auctores, absorbs the interest of vernacular philologists and with it develops a form of purism based on 1 Cf. T. Labande-Jeanroy, La question de la 4 Bembo's parallel between Boccaccio and langue en Italie (Strasburg, 1925), pp. 8-10, and Petrarch on the one hand, and Cicero and Virgil R. A.

GLYNN FAITHFULL 289 fourteenth-century usage.1 Nevertheless 'living language' remained as a linguistic concept even though it was rejected as a criterion for literature. To understand this development it is necessary to turn back to the theories of Bembo which, as we have seen, were formulated before the emergence of the concept of 'living language . The relevant passage of the Prose in this connexion is that in which Carlo Bembo-whose words represent in the dialogue the views of the author-proceeds to refute the contention of Giuliano de' Medici that to use the language of the Trecento writers in the Cinquecento would be to write 'ai morti piu che ai vivi'.2 At this point Bembo makes it very clear that he considers that a language lives only in its literature; and, moreover, only when its literature avoids contamination with the spoken language: La lingua delle scritture, Giuliano, non dee a quella del popolo accostarsi, se non in quanto, accostandovisi, non perde gravita, non perde grandezza; che altramente ella discostare se ne dee e dilungare, quanto le basta a mantenersi in vago e gentile stato.3 Again, when discussing the language of Boccaccio: N6 il Boccaccio altresi con la bocca del popolo ragion6; quantunque alle prose ella molto meno si disconvenga, che al verso. Che come che egli alcuna volta, massimamente nelle novelle, secondo le proposte materie, persone di volgo a ragionare traponendo, s'ingegnasse di farle parlare con le voci con le quali il volgo parlava, nondimeno egli si vede che in tutto '1 corpo delle composizioni sue esso e cosi di belle figure, di vaghi modi e dal popolo non usati, ripieno, che maraviglia non i se egli ancora vive, e lunghissimi secoli viverd.4 Thus we see that Bembo's conception of 'life' in language was a humanistic one and the opposite of what we have suggested should be called the vitalistic con- ception.5 The conflict between these two points of view is the essential dualism of Cinquecento vernacular philology. The authoritative mouthpiece of late Cinquecento vernacular humanism, of this neo-Bembism as it might be called, was Lionardo Salviati. In the first two chapters .of Book II of his Avvertimenti his dualistic principle is enunciated. They are entitled: 'Se le lingue vive sien da restrigner sotto regola e specialmente il volgar nostro and 'Da chi si debbano, per iscrivere e per favellare, raccor le regole e prender le parole nelle lingue che si favellano e che sono atte a scriversi; e specialmente il volgar nostro'. We can only quote his main conclusion: Perche conchiuderemo, senza piu avanti parlar dell'altre lingue, le regole del volgar nostro doversi prendere da' nostri vecchi autori, cioi da quelli che scrissero dell'anno 1 Toffanin hasalready used the term 'umanista by the younger Pico della Mirandola in the del volgare' in connexion with other develop- polemical exchange of letters between the two, ments in this period.

In his second letter reference to the work of Vincenzo Borghini, that Pico uses (in Latin) the term lingua viva: now early vernacular documents begin to be the ' Oportet itaque gerere animo conceptos Ciceronis, object of an enthusiasm which a century earlier esse praeterea instructos rerum multarum, et was reserved for Greek and Latin codices.

The Cinquecento closes with this vernacular humanism apparently firmly established and generally accepted. By the end of the century the members of the Accademia della Crusca were absorbed in compiling their dictionary in which they attempted to codify the language in terms of Salviatian imitatio. To say how far they succeeded and how far they failed lies beyond the scope of this article, but we may note that the widespread dissatisfaction which the practical shortcomings of their work provoked is an indication of the growing appeal of 'living language' as a guiding principle both for linguistic study and for literary style: 'essendo la lingua nostra viva e non morta come la Greca, la Latina e tutte le altre che solo s'imparano da' libri'.2 Thus the debate continued. Before concluding, we may observe that our survey is not only of interest for the history of ideas in the field of linguistics. It provides evidence of the process whereby scientific technical terms come to be established. It throws light on the fundamental processes of the formation of symbols to meet observable facts and of how facts come to be observable. Starting from the first verb metaphors of Pietro Bembo-nascere, crescere, venire in istato we have traced the emergence of a new conception; or rather, since it assumes dualistic form, of two new concepts and two new technical terms: lingua viva and lingua morta. It is not sufficient to suggest that the origin of the metaphor lies in Horace's Ars poetica, in the lines which precede those quoted above: Ut silvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos, Prima cadunt, ita verborum: vetus interit aetas, Et iuvenum ritu florent modo nata vigentque... (vv. 60-2) For there is an important difference between the annual renewal of foliage on a tree arid the life and death of a tree as a whole. Horace, it seems, could not see the tree for the leaves and we have to explain why more than a millennium passed before the language-tree was observed at all! Clearly we must look for more fundamental phenomena than literary quotations from Latin classics in order to find an explana- tion. In our analysis we have in fact turned to those underlying social habits in the apperception of reality which lie so deep in the individual that they are not felt as metaphors. We have shown that the origins of the concept of 'living language' lie in the transference of an important section of the phenomena of vernacular philology from one classification of natural philosophy to another-from alteratio to generatio-as a result of the realization that Italian was somehow derived from Latin and yet essentially different. Once this step had been taken the emergence of 'living language' from 'generated language' was logical and inevitable. That it did not do so immediately was no doubt due to the dominant rhetorico-literary 1 L. Salviati, Degli avvertimenti della lingua 2 G.

GLYNN FAITHFULL 291 principles of humanistic philology, according to which the living aspect of a language consisted in its being transmitted, in a static, immutable written form to posterity. Putting it in its simplest terms, we can say that our material provides some evidence of how the thoughts of learned Italians about their new, vernacular, literary language evolved during the latter part of the Renaissance. In considering its relationship to Latin they were confronted with the need to study process, for which the analogy of living things piovides the simplest symbol.1 Thus if Horace thought of the phenomena of change in language in terms of the annual cycle of the return of foliage, while the vernacular philologists of the Cinquecento saw it in terms of the birth, growth and death of living things in successive generations- and here we may add parenthetically that the next development after 'living language' is the emergence of the related concepts of 'mother language' and 'daughter language'-the reason is not far to seek. It is that his observations were restricted to the period from primitive Latin written records to Classical Latin whereas theirs began at the same point but extended far beyond, through the Late Latin and Medieval Latin to the Romance period. Underlying the subjective phenomena of our material we can trace the simple animistic belief that whatever grows in size is alive. Here we may note that although J. C. Scaliger tried to draw a distinction between augescere and crescere2 he nevertheless lists increase in size as one of the signs of life: Nam vita percipitur aut ex motu, aut per incrementum, aut ab aliis officiis: non a motu simpliciter. Elementa namque moventur, nec tamen vivunt.3 From the time of Machiavelli's Dialogo onwards vernacular philologists frequently stress the increased and still increasing size of the vocabulary of their language compared with that of Latin.4 Among the most interesting remarks on this subject are those of Marcellino. He not only discusses all the wealth of new words for the inventions and discoveries of his century but he stresses the static vocabulary of Latin. After mentioning some of the neologisms of humanistic Latin he concludes: ...tuttavia l'analogia o proporzione, che vogliamo dire, che hanno queste voci formate dal Navaiero e dal Flaminio, con queste altre che si veggono formate da coloro che le formarono quando quella lingua viveva, puo render per avventura que' grand' uomini degni di scusa. Ma non per tutto cio si chiamerebbono latine le nuove voci non derivate o congiunte per analogia di altre parole che fossero state introdotte in quella lingua, mentre ella viveva: e molto meno quelle che vi fossero portate di nuovo per intera innovazione, secondo che richiederebbono le novita delle cose de' nostri tempi.5 Yet another factor related to this problem is the association of the soul with language. Aristotle had defined voice as follows: But voice is the sound produced by a creature possessing a soul: for none of the soulless creatures has a voice.... So the blow given to the air breathed in by the soul in these parts (of the body) against the windpipe causes voice. For not every sound made by 1 Other metaphors were occasionally used, fusse stato il processo suo...'. Cf. op. cit. such as the flowing of rivers and fountains or p. 21. the building and rebuilding of houses. It is 2 In libros de plantis Aristoteli inscriptos interesting to note that the equivalent word for commentarii (Genevae, 1566), p. 13, col. 2: 'process' is itself used in our period. Gelli, 'Lapides enim non crescunt, sed augescunt'. probably taking the term from medical termino- 3 Ibid. p. 13, cols. 1 and 2. logy, uses it when referring to the growth and 4 We have already quoted such a passage from decline of Latin: 'Nella quale considerando Citolini.

Indeed it is possibly by some such series of associations that the concept of the 'genius' of a language later arose. When one reads, however, the writings of the vernacular philologists of the Cinquecento one realizes that a most important factor was that to them the vernacularfelt alive. Their vitalistic conceptions are related to a sense of the vitality and vividness of their language.2 It felt alive to them because they shared it with living people. Perhaps occasionally, like Machiavelli, they imagined that they entered 'nelle antiche corti degli antichi uomini'; but when the latter, 'per la loro umanita', replied to their questions, was it Latin they used, or was it 'living language ' ~~~~~LI~~VERPOOL R.
