Said BEGINNINGS: INTENTION AND METHOD (Chapter Four) New York: Basic Books, Inc., 1975 Jacques Derrida GLAS (first paragraph, left column) Paris: Editions Galilee, 1974 The left-hand column of the first page of Jacques Derrida's Glas begins with: quoi du reste aujourd'hui, pour nous, ici, maintenant, d'un Hegel? Pour nous, ici, maintenant: voila ce qu'on n'aura pu desormais penser sans lui. Pour nous, ici, maintenant: ces mots sont des citations, dja', toujours, nous I'aurons appris de lui. which, attempting to maintain its symptomatic ungrammaticality, we might trans- late by: what besides remains today, for us, here, now, of a Hegel? For us, here, now, that is what will have been impossible henceforth to think without him. For us, here, now: these words are quotations, already, always, we will have learned it from him. Derrida, then-or, to be faithful to Glas, we should say that which signs itself Derrida-inscribes in the "Here" and "Now" of a beginning, which presumably ought to remain transparent and neutral enough to allow for the play of an originat- ing intention, a question about "Here" and "Now," thus transforming such a begin- ning into the belated repetition of a quote. The quote itself grafts Derrida's text upon another beginning, namely, that of the first chapter of Hegel's Phenomenology, which also begins, appropriately enough, by textualizing the problem of the "Here" and "Now." Derrida's impossibility of an innocent beginning repeats Hegel's. The latter's text does not accept its own beginning as simple or neutral either, and the "Here" and "Now" of the first chapter is not a simple reflexive meditation upon the gesture initiating the trajectory that will lead the authorial voice of the Phenomen- ology to be dissolved in an eventual Absolute Knowledge. The beginning of Hegel's Phenomenology is written from the belated perspective of. the end of the journey. The philosopher who has reached the level of the concept writes the conclusion of the Phenomenology which constitutes its Preface, followed by an Introduction; then, and only then, appears the first chapter, which questions the "Here" and "Now." Hegel's beginning is also a belated beginning, or more precisely, Hegel's beginning is a beginning that can only follow the end. After Eliot's own version of Hegel's beginning the process is only too familiar. EUGENIO DONATO is Chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at UNY-Buffalo.

The fact is that neither the "Here" and "Now" nor their experiential con- tent is available to the philosopher. Philosophizing has of necessity an economic underpinning which is similar to that of the writer-and let us emphasize that for Hegel, and for the major tradition of continental philosophy as well, philosophy exists only as a written activity, as the inscription of a written representation. The acquisition of the sublated, graphic representation of the concept has to be paid for by the sacrifice of the plenitude offered to the individual consciousness by the object. In the original transparency and certitude of the "Here" and "Now," in Hegel's words, "[One instance] is put forward ... as existing in simple immediacy, as the essential reality, the object. The other [instance], however, is put forward as the non-essential, as mediated, something which is not per se in the certainty, but there through something else, ego, a state of knowledge which only knows the ob- ject because the object is, and which can as well be as not be. The object, how- ever, is the real truth, is the essential reality; it is."' This original object which con- ditions truth and essence, or rather, that is truth and essence, and which generated "a wealth to which we can as little find any limit when we traverse its extent in space and time, where that content is presented before us, as when we take a frag- ment out of the abundance it offers us and by dividing and dividing seek to pene- trate its intent,"2 is that which will have to be renounced, the price that will have to be paid by the philosopher, but by the writer as well, for the possibility of hav- ing access to the mediatized representational forms of the object. It is only out of the original loss and primordial murder of this object that philosophical concepts or literary representations can spring forth. It is only by abolishing at its origin what Hegel calls the "fundamental difference" that both self and concept can appear in their conceptual mediatized form. For Hegel the disappearance of the original object will also dissolve the simple spatial and temporal components of the object. Instead of the absolute presence of a "Here" and "Now" constituting the object-and hence "truth" and "essence"- we will have instead a necessary dialectical sublation to reconstitute the mediatized concepts of another "Here" and another "Now" which sustain, if not for Hegel, for any metaphysically oriented epistemology the plural, discrete, universe of subjects and objects. Yet, as Derrida will show, the reconstitution of the concept through a dialectical sublation has its own temporality which is not one of the presence of "Here" and "Now," but one of the absence of an "always already;" hence, the "Here" and "Now" of the philosophical concept and of the literary representation is in fact a derived construct. The object of literary representation, rather than being at the origin and guaranteeing the "truth" of representation, is only a secondary constructed effect. We shall have to come back to Derrida's argument, but for the time being let us return to the text from which we started. Derrida's "beginning" in Glas is emblematic, then, of all beginnings, for it not only affirms the necessity for each utterance to be in the form of a repetition, a. displaced quotation, but uses the repetition to indicate the necessarily mediatized nature of representation, mediated by another text which itself is not original but tells rather of the absence of privileged origins. Derrida's text is, then, a representa- tional fiction which tells not only of the impossibility of finding a non-mediated form of representation for fiction but also of the necessity of representing in fiction the fiction of its own fictionality; in other words, Derrida's text is an exemplary emblem of fiction's need to allegorize itself as fiction.

Yet this privileged origin cannot be one, not only because a text as representation cannot take the place of an origin, since in itself it refers to another origin-and especially not a text which has already questioned its own privileged origin-but because the apparent privilege of Hegel's text is in fact only an after-effect. Its privileged position is a textual illusion, made possible by a repeti- tion which at the beginning repeats nothing, since the original object, or the original "fundamental difference"-to remain within a Hegelian vocabulary-is lost. If the object appears to persist within a belated representation, it is not qua object but as something other inextricably woven into the material web of repre- sentation. It is, in fact, the complexities involved in separating object and repre- sentation that have led to the pseudo-empiricism of contemporary French linguistic formalism, which Derrida's analysis-in particular of the Saussurian semiological underpinning of the system-has shown to be determined time and again by a naive metaphysics. The consequent disappearance of the object seems to have led to two different ideologies regarding the analysis of literary texts. There are on the one hand mimetic theories, which in one fashion or another assume the capacity of linguistic representations to be adequate to an object or to another text, and de- pend in fact upon the uncritical assumption of a neutral perception mediating be- tween object and representation or, in its more complex form, a neutral reading which mediates between the two texts. On the other hand, a number of theories ad- mitting the impossibility of passing simply and adequately through a neutral per- ception, propose the possibility of passing from the relational properties of repre- sentation to the properties of the object, thus bypassing the perceptual component of the object by postulating an isomorphism between the relational order of repre- sentation and the properties of the object. My purpose here is not to concern myself with an analysis of specific examples of either of these two general tendencies, and if I allowed myself such gross gen- eralizations, it is better to underscore what I believe, to be an unduly neglected point in Derrida's argument, one of consequence for any discussion of the proble- matics of the Text. For Derrida, a representational system can only give the impres- sion of identity or adequacy to an object insofar as it is constructed according to specific metaphysical prerequisites to permit a derived form of presence, which will make a presentation of the last object belatedly possible within a primary repre- sentation. What is at play in a linguistic or representational system is not the immediacy and transparency which would render the adequation of object and representation possible; instead, representation is a construction which makes presence belatedly and not originally present. Derrida has analysed two such sys- tems; Husserl's in La Voix et le phenomene and Hegel's in Le Puits et la pyramide. Husserl's system is the simpler of the two. It postulates the possibility of the pres- ence of the object as an original perceptual mimetic moment, and then the in- scription of this original perceptual presence into a representational system. Der- rida's argument will consist in showing how this original moment of presence cannot in fact exist without its representational counterpart which through its materiality, its temporality and its intersubjectivity deprives the origin of presence, and forces within representation a play of absence and temporization. For Derrida, Husserl's system represents the failure of a willed metaphysics. Hegel's system is more complex, and for its understanding I can only refer to Derrida's remarkable analysis. In this context, suffice it to say that Hegel postu- lates at the origin an undifferentiated interiorization of the world. The association of elements taken from this original memory, metaphorized in the form of a dark well, constitutes, in conjunction with elements taken from a productive imagination, the perceptual elements of presence at play in a representational system which, though for Hegel it must first be voiced, culminates in a pyramid as its emblematic metaphor. What should concern us here is the fact that a representational system is not "naturally" given, but has to be laboriously constructed. Presence is not an original given, but the product of a complex and artificial fictional machine. What in fact is constructed is the very process of "meaning." If representational systems and texts "mean," it is not through the natural coincidence of the "order of words" and the "order of things," but because there is at play a Bedeutung which Derrida trans- lates, both in Husserl and Hegel, as a vouloir-dire and which I propose to translate 26</page><page sequence="4">as a will to signification.3 Such a will to signification transforms representation into a signifying machine which eventually creates the illusion of presence. One of the texts most commented upon in France in recent years has been Nietzsche's "On Truth and Falsity in their Ultramoral Sense." The reason is ob- vious: one would be hard pressed to find another text that proposes a critique as succinct, radical, and devastating as that of Nietzsche of the position that language can in any way, immediate or mediated, find an adequation with the object it pur- ports to represent. Since Nietzsche's text as well as its commentaries are well-known, it is hardly necessary for me to analyze it in detail here. I should like simply to note some of its components which I believe to be important for the clarification of Derrida's position. For Nietzsche the Object, Nature, or what he calls the "Thing- in-itself"-let us note in passing that this "Thing-in-itself" is also from the begin- ning a linguistic quote-manifests itself as Force and not as representation. This Force, acting upon a subject, produces perceptually a first anthropocentric and anthropomorphic representation which Nietzsche calls a first metaphor. There is in Nietzsche, as opposed for example to Husserl, no possible continuity at the origin between the order of the "Thing-in-itself" and the order of perception, which is metaphoric, that is to say, already textual. The passage from perception to language is once again the passage between two orders which are discontinuous. Language, then, is twice removed from the "Thing-in-itself," a metaphor of a metaphor: The "Thing-in-itself" (it is just this which would be the pure ineffective truth) is also quite incomprehensible to the creator of language and not worth making any great endeavor to obtain. He designates only the relations of things to men and for their expression he calls to his help the most daring metaphors. A nerve-stimulus, first transformed into a percept! First metaphor! The percept again copied into a sound! Second metaphor! And each time he leaps completely out of one sphere right into the midst of an entirely different one.4 And to the question "What therefore is truth?" Nietzsche replies with the well- known and often-quoted "A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropo- morphisms."5 Curiously, in Nietzsche's argument it is the very "naturality" of the "Thing-in- itself" which places it outside the order of language, that is, the order of culture. Nietzsche, then, treats perception as being already a textual representation. If lan- guage reinscribes perception, then it simply reinscribes an "origin" which is itself a textual representation. What is important, of course, is the fact that the second metaphor, which inscribes the first one, necessarily reads the first one as an identity. In other words, language by its own metaphorical nature will always inscribe within itself the illusion that it is capable of naming the "Thing-in-itself" by its proper name. As Derrida will argue in La Mythologie blanche, that which stands at the origin can neither be perceived nor invested with a proper name. Proper names are, strictly speaking, metaphoric illusions. The illusion stems, of course, from not recognizing the already textual nature of perception. As Derrida writes: "perception does not exist or [...] what is called perception is not primordial [...] somehow everything 'begins' by 're-presentation'."'6 If the deconstruction of presence in perception is the main point of the argu- ment, its major consequence is that every text is of necessity invested with a pseudo-origin, a pseudo-presence, a pseudo-repres6ntational identity, and it is the interplay of this pseudo-origin, pseudo-presence, and pseudo-representational iden- S am translating Bedeutung (vouloir- dire) as will to signification, rather than by the standard English term meaning, for reasons which should be- come clear as the paper proceeds. 4 Nietzsche, F.: Complete Works, ed.

Inasmuch as a text is fundamentally constructed, its naturalness can only be a will to signification aware of itself. The difference from text to text lies primarily in their relative manners of ignoring, hiding, or on the contrary overtly manipulating their Bedeutung, their will to signification. There is no better illustration of this process than another text of Nietzsche's appropriately singled out by Said in his Beginnings: " 'Truth' is [...] not something there, that might be found or discovered-but something that must be created and that gives a name to a process, or rather to a will to overcome that has in itself no end- introducing truth, as a processus in infinitum, an active determining-not a becom- ing-conscious of something that is in itself firm and determined. It is a word for the 'will to power' " (Beginnings, p. 152). It is perhaps fitting that the problematics of the text should come of age intro- duced on one hand by the toll of what Hartman has appropriately characterized as an "epigrammatology,"' on the other by a synthetic, encyclopedic metatext entitled Beginnings. In spite of-and in some ways because of-their difference it is tempting to try to situate Beginnings with respect to Derrida's enterprise. Much of Said's argument regarding the distinction between Origins and Be- ginnings-extended upon a completely different set of texts-parallels Derrida's argument. The novelist, as well as the essayist and the critic, unable to have access to privileged origins, must substitute for them the gesture of begionings, which of necessity situate him in a problematic of repetition. Where Derrida begins with representation, Said begins with repetition, quoting Kierkegaard to the effect that "Repetition is reality, and it is the seriousness of life" [p. 88]. The fictional universe which the author begins and begets and over which he has authority is for Said, as it was for Derrida, radically anti-mimetic, whether it appears in what Said calls the classical form of the novel, or in a later form of fiction which exacerbates its representational ontology: "Whereas in the classical novel there had been both a desire to create or author an alternate life and to show (by molestation) this alterna- tive to be at bottom an illusion with reference to 'life,' the later version of this desire was a revulsion from the novelist's whole procreative enterprise and an intensification of his scriptive fate. Not only does this reaction constitute a critique of the traditional theory of mimetic representation, it also radically transforms the idea of a text" [p. 137]. Where Derrida and Said differ is with regard to the worldly status, so to speak, of fictional representations. If Derrida's philosophical radicalism makes it impossible to sustain an opposition-no matter how ambiguously, complexly or agonistically described-between World and Text, the possibility of "reading" the world is only an after-effect of a primary representation. Said, on the contrary, seems always to view fiction against a world and a history whose opacity resist the attempts of narrative fic- tion to affect it, modify it, transform it, or comprehend it. The nature of narrative fiction is, then, essentially elegiac: "Narrative has come to this, then: a house without wom- en, without fulfillment, without family" (p. 155), and its teleology the mausoleum. I said that the relationship of Said and Derrida to a presumed "world" differed; in fact the situation is perhaps more ambiguous. Said does oppose a "world" and a "history" to the representational world of fiction, but perhaps this "world" and "history" are so opaque and resistant to representation that they end up, curiously, resembling the "Thing-in-itself" of Nietzsche, whereas the representational world of fiction is the only context in which a will to signification can read or impose any order upon them. With respect to this problematic, the novelty of Said resides perhaps in his attempt to reinscribe texts systematically into another history specific to them. Said is concerned with the empirical materiality and historicity of texts, and contributes to this problem some remarkably interesting considerations. A text for him is both a "graphological memory" and a "presence" inasmuch as it occupies a place [p. 209]. Texts in their specific historicity, in fact, reduplicate the specific dialectic of their inscription: "The text leaves behind its origin [...] for the text is the beginning of a series of substitutions which altogether comprise the formal object we call a text. [...] there is really no such thing as an absolutely primal text, each act of composition involves other texts, and so each writing transmits itself, receives other writing, is an interpretation of other writing, reconstitutes (by displacement) other 28</page><page sequence="6">writing" [p. 218]. What we have here is not a simple statement about the neces- sarily intertextual context of texts. The historical inscription of texts not only medi- ates the relationship of individual texts to the world, but also constitutes their own fictional plots which finally have the same status as the plots and representations of individual texts; that is, here again we are face to face with the texts' incapacity to mark "history" with a will to signification. On this point as well it is interesting to compare Derrida and Said. For Der- rida too the inscription of the text within a given materiality is important; it is, in fact, in its necessarily expressive materiality that a will to signify loses its reflexive self-transparency in an irrecoverable non-presence: "The elements of worldly exis- tence, of what is natural or empirical, of sensibility, of association, etc. which deter- mined the concept of indication, will perhaps (certainly across a number of media- tions we can anticipate) find their ultimate unity in this nonpresence."8 The joyful wisdom of Derrida's deconstruction does not concern itself with this loss, seeing in it on the contrary a necessary condition for the constitution of a text. What one senses in Said, on the other hand, is the desire for the mark of a textual tradition upon the ambiguities of history. A parenthetical remark. In his reading of the French critical scene, Said rather markedly valorizes Foucault and Derrida, which can only be explained by the con- cern Said shares with Foucault for the problem of the historical insertion of the text. The paradox here is, of course, that Foucault's epistemology is quite different from both Said's and Derrida's, and could in no way come to terms with their deconstructive strategies. Foucault's epistemology, based on an archeological meta- phor, is primarily an epistemology of presence. Representation is never problematic for Foucault, because representation never quite erases the object so as to mark in repetition its absence rather than its presence. Archeology is based upon an epistemology that postulates the possibility for the fragment to represent the whole, and the label the object. Archeology claims the possibility of reconstructing a "his- tory" which would not be a fiction, and in this we are very far indeed from both Derrida and Said. To conclude, both Derrida and Said have seen the inevitability for texts marked at their beginning by the absence of a transcendental signified-Object, "Thing-in-itself," World, Father, Truth, Phallus, etc.-eventually to erect themselves as funerary monuments. Said points to T. E. Lawrence's text as a mausoleum, and in his last chapter quotes Vico, for whom burial and the cinerary urn are the very origin of culture, hence of language and representation: "This institution [burial] is symbolized by a cinerary urn [...] The urn indicates also the origin among the gentiles of the division of the fields to which is to be traced the distinction of cities and peoples and finally nations" [p. 371]. Further on Said writes: "To bury, in Vico's sense, is to engender difference; and to engender difference, as Derrida has argued, is to defer presence, to temporize, to introduce absence" [p. 3731. Derrida, for his part, shows us that Hegel's will to signify culminates in the metaphor of a pyramid, then pointedly reminds us that the body of the king is absent from the pyramid. If the absence at the origin and beginnings destines texts to erect themselves as funerary monuments, a reverse critical strategy can only have as its function the deconstruction of the monument in order to reinscribe at the end the absence that was there all along, and for which the text was only an emblem. In Melville's words: "The old mummy lies buried in cloth on cloth; it takes time to unwrap this Egyptian king [...] By vast pains we mine into the pyramid; by horrible gropings we come to the central room; with joy we espy the sarcophagus; but we lift the lid and no body is there!"9 ' Speech and Phenomena, p. 37. , Melville, H. in Pierre, or, the Am- biguities, The Writings of Herman Melville (Evanston: Northwestern Uni- versity Press and The Newberry Li- brary, 1971); pp. 284-85.
