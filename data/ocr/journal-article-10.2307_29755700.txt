<plain_text><page sequence="1">Southern Turkmenia and Northern Iran. Ties and Differences in Very Ancient Times by V. Sarianidi There is an almost total lack of knowledge on our part of the territory bordering on northern Iran in ancient times, and when the discovery in southern Turkmenistan of an old farming culture dating from the 6th-2nd millennium occurred, it appeared as a sort of oasis lost in the midst of two great deserts: the Kara-Kum and the Dast-i Kavlr. However, a picture thus drawn does not reflect the true situation but merely the dearth of our ideas about it. But even now ? as will be shown in what follows ? certain inter-connexions are discernible which argue in favour of the view that, historically, a specific common destiny was shared by these two regions constituting the northern outpost of the ancient cultural world of the East. Already at the time the Anau culture was first studied, explorers noted links between it and archaeological sites in ancient Iran (*). As far as the material found is concerned, light was thrown on the problem in a book by D. McCown (2), and likewise by a series of articles published in scientific journals (3). In Soviet specialist literature, the links between southern Turkmenia and the ancient cultures of the Near East have been studied in a general way by S. P. Tolstov (4) and B. A. Kuftin (5). Following the accumulation of a vast mass of archaeological material from southern Turkmenistan, this problem has become the object of special research by archaeologists directly interested in the study of the ancient past of central and southwest Asia (6).

Within the sphere of the ancient farming culture, the deserts of Dast-i Kavir and Dast-i L?t divide ancient Iran, as it were, into three cultural and historical areas. The north? ernmost one comprises the Elburz and the Turkmeno-Khor?s?n mountains together with relative hill country; the second area, to the west, is made up of the Zagros mountains and includes H?zist?n; and lastly, the third area, to the south, stretches along the Persian Gulf. The oldest sites known to us are those in the western area (Tepe Asiab, Tepe Sarab, Tepe Guran), and in particular those that closely resemble corresponding complexes belong? ing to the mesolithic site of Karim Sahir and the neolithic site of Jarmo (7), and can indi? cate the initial stages in the formation of a proto-agricultural economy in this locality. In this respect, of striking significance is the material discovered at the site of Ganj Dareh (8500-7000 B.C.) (8), since it fills a hitherto existing gap in chronology after Karim Sahir O. It would seem that the Kirm?ns?h mountain valleys were the locality that saw the spread of the proto-agricultural tribes of Iran; but the discoveries in H?zist?n put us on our guard, as it were, against such hasty conclusions. The merit of having made clear the cultural sequence of this region is wholly due to L. Le Breton (10). In the last few years still more discoveries have been made in the Deh-Luran valley in the south of H?zist?n (cAli Kos, Tepe Sabz) {xl). We acknowledge their amazing im? portance; yet the conclusions reached by their authors concerning the priority of the alluvial valleys in the development of an agricultural economy in the foot-hills of mountain regions need to be handled with the utmost caution. The presence of pottery consonant with ? tra? dition ? in the oldest phase of cAli Kos (7000-6500 B.C.) must make us wary of such pp. 40-44, 86-92, 106-120; I.

Be that as it may, it is the western area, situated in the immediate vicinity of northern Iraq, that, on the evidence so far available, fostered the earliest beginnings of ancient Iranian agriculture. R. Dyson is surely right when he discerns in the material of Tepe Sarab, Guran and cAll Kos a coherent stage in the spread of pottery of the Jarmo type from northern Iran to H?zist?n (12). In the next area, the southern one, sites dating from such an early period are still unknown to us. For although the material deriving from the lowest layers of Tal-i Bakun B and Tal-i Muski belong, it would seem, to a very remote period (13), it is nevertheless later than that of the sites of the western area. The sites strung out along the shore of the Persian Gulf as far as Kirm?n-Makr?n belong to a still later period (14). It would seem that the lessening antiquity of sites as one moves from southern H?zist?n (cAll Kos) across the intermediate region of Shiraz (Tal-i Bakun) as far as Kirm?n-Makr?n reflects the actual spread and development of the proto-agricultural communities of the southern area. The excavations at Tal-i Iblis have already yielded material dating back to the 5th millennium B.C. (15), and still more convincing is the material from the lower layers of Tepe Yahya that reveals parallels with sites of a Tepe Guran and Jarmo type (16). Assuming that all these sites reflect the spread of populations from west to east, it is clear that the initial stages of this process must be assigned to the 6th millennium B.C. The way farming cultures took shape in the northern area is a yet more complex problem. It is true that discoveries in the region of Lake Urmia (17), and in particular of neolithic sites in this locality (18), have unveiled the past of north-west Iran, but the north? east district, which is of special interest to us, is still almost wholly unexplored. The fact is that even in the Turkmeno-Khor?s?n mountains, despite highly suitable geographic con? ditions (the presence of about 40 species of herbaceous plant in a wild state, for in? stance) (19), proto-agriculture sites are generally quite unknown, and only the total lack of exploration in this region will account for this. However, the very existence of sites be? longing to the neolithic culture of Dzejtun close to the northern spurs of the Kopet Dagh &gt;(12) R.

In this respect the discoveries made in the Gorg?n valley are highly indicative: they are isolated ones at present, it is true, but augur well for the future. This valley, in fact, lying close to the foothill of the Turk? meno-Khor?s?n mountains represents what is essentially the south-west extremity of that fertile plain of southern Turkmenistan which extends as a long narrow strip along the spurs of the Kopet Dagh. Until very recently, on one side of this northern flank of the ancient farming cultures of Asia Minor only the mesolithic sites of the area around the Caspian Sea (Hotu, Gari Kamarband, Dam Dam Casme, and Dzebel) were known to us (20); and on the other side, the sites of the ancient farming culture of the Dzejtun cul? tural group extending for 450 km. along the spurs of the Kopet Dagh. The Gorg?n valley discoveries fill such a gap and appear to suggest a single evolutionary process embracing all the ancient-agricultural tribes of this whole, enormously vast region. Let us now have a close look at the actual material brought to light. The first site affording evidence for a conclusion of this sort is Turang-Tepe, the origin of which would appear to date back to the 5th millennium B.C. Though the cultural layers of this period have not been discovered owing to the proximity of water at this level, I. Deshayes brought his great professional experience and acute powers of analysis to bear on tiny sherds found in bricks used for later construction work, and was thus able to classify the oldest complex of Turang Tepe I (21). One can wholly concur with his statement that this pottery affords quite tangible affinities with the material belonging to Dzejtun culture rather than with that of Siyalk I. All that needs to be pointed out is that the samples published match up better with the late phase of Dzejtun culture, though this does not, of course, rule out the pres? ence of older material at Tureng Tepe. If Turang Tepe indirectly indicates the presence of sites so ancient in the Gorg?n valley, the other site, Yarim Tepe (22), in the neighbourhood of Gumbed-i Kabus, removes all vestige of doubt about it. Although a provisional publication about this site is all we have at the moment, I have been able to familiarize myself with the general pottery stratifi? cation of Yarim Tepe through the kindness of the Director of the British Institute of Per? sian Studies in Teheran, D. Stronach. Its lower layers comprise material typical of Dzejtun culture, while the pottery of higher strata corresponds completely to the pottery complexes of Namazga I-IV identified in southern Turkmenistan. The affinity is so convincing that there can be absolutely no doubt that Yarim Tepe and the sites of south Turkmenistan (20) C. Coon, ?Excavations in Hotu Cave ?, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 96, 3, 1952, pp. 231-249; Id., Cave Explorations in Iran, 1949, Philadelphia, 1951, pp. 10-125; A. P.

Arne, Excavations at Shah Tepe, Stock? holm, 1945, p. 12, Conclusions no. 86. 294</page><page sequence="5">belong to the same cultural cycle. It was only from the Namazga V period onwards that a divergence occurred when there was a diffusion of grey pottery at Yarim Tepe which is the hallmark of the more truly Iranian culture of the Bronze Age of Astr?b?d. It is clear that we have here the first undoubted evidence of the fact that the spread of centres of Dzejtun and Anau culture was not just confined to the northern foot-hills of the Kopet Dagh, but continued westwards along the foot-hills of the Turkmeno-Kho r?s?n mountains till it reached the Caspian Sea in the region of the Gorg?n valley. The aforesaid appearance in this region of sites of the antiquity of Dzejtun is a fact to which the utmost importance deserves to be attributed. Apart from the pottery of the lower layers of Yarim Tepe and Turang Tepe, it is manifest also in the use of clay ?loaves? in building as well as the presence of ovens at Yarim Tepe ? hallmarks, that is, of Dzejtun culture. Though fireplaces of similar construction have been noted here only in the Bronze Age layers (23), there is reason to believe that analogous ones are present in the lower layers of Yarim Tepe ? a fact likewise of some substance arguing a long, tenacious lineage in the evolution of local culture (24). On the one hand the lower layers of Yarim Tepe and Turang Tepe, and maybe a series of other sites in the Gorg?n valley, clearly show the presence in this neighbourhood of certain agricultural sites in very remote ages; and on the other reveal their role in the cul? tural area of the south Turkmenistan cycle. Accordingly, the Turkmeno-Khor?s?n mountains, forming an acute triangle within the confines of Turkmenistan, are seen to be occupied on the northern flank by a small chain of proto-agricultural sites. The furthermost point to the south-west is made up of the Gorg?n valley sites, the furthermost point to the south-east by the sites of Dzejtun culture like Cagylly and Cakmakly, while the apex consists of the neolithic sites in the city of Kizil Arvat. The base of this ? triangle of the fertile lands ? is formed by the valley of Kuc?n-Meshed whose sites await the spade of the excavator and the exploration of which will call for energy and tenacity. It is thought at present that the earliest sites of Dzejtun culture were situated in the central region (Dzejtun, Copan Tepe, Togolok Tepe), and from here at a later stage the Dzejtun tribes spread east (Cagylly, Monzukly) and west (Bami) (25). A supposition of this sort, based upon a mass of data, is fully plausible in itself, yet, as matters stand today, this was not the oldest phase in the history of the formation of Dzejtun culture. It must have been preceded by an older ? pre-ceramic ? stage of agricul? ture whose sites we may suppose to have been in the immediate vicinity of the mountains. (23) Crowford, op. cit., fig. 10. (24) In contrast with the above statement it is a curious fact that these fire-places or hearths in southern Turkmenistan are not known after the age of Anau IA. Cf. V. Sarianidi, ? Keramiceskie gorny vostocnoanausskih poselenij ?, KSIA, 93, 1963, fig. 31. (25) O. Berdyev, ? Stratigrafija Togolok tepe v svjazi s rasseleniem piemen dzejtunskoj kul'tury ?, SA, 1964, 3; V.

The tiny sites of Dzejtun culture stretch for as far as 700 km. from the Gorg?n valley through Kizil Arvat to south-east Turkmenistan; and this fact can hardly be explained in terms of a simple separation of com? munities. On the other hand, in the extreme south-west both Yarim Tepe and Turang Tepe are extensive sites, while the oldest ones are usually very small, faintly outlined in their profile, and hence more difficult to explore. A large quantity of ancient sites observed in the Gorg?n valley (26) including some small-size ones, lead us to suppose that here existed sites still older than those at present known to us. In his latest works, V. Masson was already arguing in favour of a genetical link bet? ween Dzejtun culture and the mesolithic cultures of the Turkmeno-Khor?s?n mountains in particular, instead of with those of the Caspian area; and this seems wholly justified. All we wish to add is that such locally formed agriculture could have been stimulated by a partial immigration of western Iranian tribes from the region of the Kirm?ns?h mountains: tribesmen that at that time had already attained to a productive type of economy. And the finding of turquoise beads and obsidian artifacts at Cagylly Tepe is probably not a pure coincidence (28) but evidence evincing distant links in a still older period. From somewhere, around the middle of the 5th millennium B.C. the neolithic culture of Dzejtun in the central part of southern Turkmenistan was replaced by a proto-chalco lithic culture (Anau I A complex). Corresponding material has been brought to light on the northern hill of Anau (29), at Gavuc Tepe, and in the village of Kousut. This period is marked by the appearance of the first copper artifacts, distaffs, and great innovations in pottery production. Thus, while ceramics of Dzejtun culture usually contained a vegetable element, now besides this pottery luxurious, thin-sided vessels are to the fore, made of high-quality clay with no visible additions. New geometrical ornaments with a net-pattern filling are now fairly widely diffused, while they were previously unknown in this region. D. McCown had observed the analogies with Siyalk II and suggested that the pottery of Anau I should be related to the culture of ? Cesme cAli ? (30), though there is another opinion that sees the formation of such a complex (31) under the influence of Siyalk I type pottery. Alas, owing to the dearth of material, it is not easy to form a sure opinion as to the exact correspondence of the Anau I complex with Siyalk I-II. Worthy of note is the (26) Arne, op. cit., pp. 21-31. (27) V. Mas son, ? ZemledeTceskij neolit jugo zapada Srednej Azii?, cit., p. 90. l(28) O. Berdyev, ?

Cesme cAll ?. Moreover, this ornamental pattern is pre? eminent not only at Cesme cAli but also at Islamabad and Kara Tepe (33), so that the formation of the Anau I A complex is linked not with Siyalk but first and foremost with analogous sites of the Tehran oasis. The analogy is evident not only in the pictorial motifs, but also in the way the pottery is made and even in the additions to the clay. At the same time, undeniable analogies in the anthropomorphic modelling may also be beheld. All this substantiates the view that during the period of Anau I A an infiltration took place of part of the tribes of the Tehran oasis in the direction of the central districts of southern Turkmenistan. In this connexion, the finds at Hissar I A, and above all at Sir-i Sayn are revealing: the pottery of the latter site, if we exclude the animal design (34), corresponds completely to the painting of Anau I A ware. Occupying a position midway between the Tehran oasis and the foot-hills of the Kopet Dagh, such Iranian sites reveal the direction in which these historical connexions, reconstructed from archaeological data, were orientated. Is this not confirmed by the very thin cultural layers of Hissar I A and Sir-i Sayn whose pottery, moreover, bears a clearly imported stamp? (35). It is manifest that Hissar I B pottery was wholly turned on the potter's wheel as though this represented a borrowing from immigrants who were masters of a more advanced ceramic technique. There is every reason for thinking that the supposed (32) H. Schmidt, ? Archaeological Excavations in Anau and Old Merv ?, in Pumpelly, op. cit., pi. 22.2,3. The accuracy of a reconstruction of this sort is borne out by the wide diffusion of this motif in the following period of Anau IB, as Schmidt has already perceptively pointed out {ibid., p. 132).

Another sort of picture in the 5th millennium B.C. can be perceived in south-east Turkmenistan (Mondzukly, Cagylly and Cakmakly) where the early chalcolithic strata are as thick as 3.5 m. and in some instances are directly superimposed on layers of Dzejtun neolithic culture (fig. 2). The pottery stands out for its good quality, and in the painting geo? metrical patterns predominate, often consisting of short strokes within a small oblique net, patterns which afford parallels with Siyalk and Hassuna ware. These analogies are not confined to the pottery alone but extend also to the stone mattocks which exactly match those of Hassuna (36). To complement what has been said we may add that with the pottery of the Hassuna IV-V period there are fairly close affinities in the strata of Siyalk I 3, a fact that in the view of R. Dyson attests the influence of Hassuna. This influence originated in Mesopotamia and extended to central Iran by way of the Zagros moun? tains (3T). The presence of archaeological sites of the Hassuna period in H?zist?n, provided their origin is not a local one (38), reveals what is probably a fairly wide diffusion of such sites on Iranian territory. Obviously, in Iran of the 5th millennium B.C. fairly important population shifts, linked to the migration of tribes of the Hassuna cycle, can be observed. The distant repercussions of this process reach even to the plains at the foot of the moun? tains of south-east Turkmenistan. There is every reason to suppose that this influence occurred earlier in time than the appearance of the Anau I A complex. Indeed, in those instances when the corresponding layers are directly overlying those of Dzejtun (Mond? zukly, Cagylly), their pottery matches the main features of Hassuna IV-V type material rather than those of the ? culture of Cesme cAli ?. In the history of the development of local communities this complex may conveniently be defined as the ?Mondzukly pe? riod ? (39). A little later in the strip of territory at the foot of the Kopet Dagh mountains there arose the sites of the Anau I A type (the northern hill of Anau, Govuc Tepe) that bear witness to the infiltration of tribes belonging to the ? Cesme cAli culture ?. Meanwhile the material culture of south Turkmenistan communities of the early chalcolithic age in all its general aspects continues the ancient local traditions of Dzejtun, albeit at a more elevated level. Copper artifacts appear upon the scene, and weaving is developed. In building, rectangular bricks now take the place of the clay ? loaves ?, but old traditions are preserved in the architecture of inhabited sites. The innovations we have (36) S. Lloyd, F. Safar, ?Tell Hassuna?, JNES, IV, 4, 1945, figs. 19-20. (37) Dyson, ? Problems in the Relative Chron? ology of Iran ?, cit. (38) P. Mortensen, ?

It must be pointed out that C 14 measurement of the late neolithic layer of Cagylly, immediately preceding that of early neolithic, gave the date 5050 ? 110 B.C. In this way, the separate ? Mondzukli period ? can be assigned to the middle if not to the first half of the 5th millennium B.C. 299</page><page sequence="10">mentioned are, broadly speaking, confined to the potter's art; but even here, beside new motifs, we still find triangle-patterns being used in a late phase of Dzejtun culture. The breeding of large and small domestic animals on a wide scale is now part of the economy as well as agriculture, yet domestication dates back to the previous period. The following period, Namazga I-Anau I B, was marked by further progress of the populations of south Turkmenistan in all fields of the economy and culture. Old inhabited sites grew in size till their area extended to 10-15 hectares, and fresh inhabited sites arose. The remains of this period fall into three geographical zones: a western one stretching from the city of Kizil Arvat to Anau; a central one from Anau to Ulug Tepe near Dusak; and an eastern one extending from Dusak to the city of Serahs. In the eastern district in a later period there arose the Geoksjur oasis of chalcolithic sites in the old delta of the river Tedzen. These three zones can be distinguished from one another by reason of certain secondary features and the art of pottery above all; yet in spite of this they indubitably form a single cultural community within the system of the whole of southern Turkmenistan. Accor? dingly, in the eastern zone during the Namazga-Anau I B period, vessels with a light-col? oured priming are more widespread, and likewise those with a red priming in the central and western zones. Broadly speaking, however, they share the same pictorial motifs which show a further development in ornament compared with the preceding period of Anau I A: a few sparse zoomorphic designs form the only innovation. The view has been put forward that the eastern zone took shape as a result of an influx by tribes of the central region (40): but in the light of the latest data, we cannot rule out the local formation of these cultural features, with the neolithic (Cagylly) and proto-chalcolithic (Monzukly) complexes of south? east Turkmenia serving as their foundation. Agriculture was given a further impetus; stock-breeding finally put an end to the monopoly of hunting; and stone artifacts almost entirely disappeared. Tribal sanctuaries were decorated with polychrome wall frescoes (Anau, Jassy Tepe). On the whole, this period is not matched by tangible affinities among the well-known material of ancient Iran. In the following period, Namazga II-Anau II, differences in the cultural physiognomy of the communities in the eastern and central zones may be observed. For instance, in the central one, friezes in light polychrome consisting of tiny geometrical patterns on a yel? lowish background replace the monochrome ware of Namazga I. Drawings of animals and human beings are rarely encountered. An analogous pottery complex has come to light at Yarim Tepe where local prototypes are also lacking, but it is quite absent from archae? ological sites of the Hiss?r-Siyalk type. It has been conjectured that the Namazga II com? plex had an overall local source, though as yet undiscovered, situated within the boundaries (40) G. Lisicyna, V. Mas son, V. Sarianidi, I. Hlopin, ? Itogi arheologiceskogo i paleogeogra ficeskogo izucenija geoksjurskogo oazisa?, SA, 1965, 1, pp. 9 f., 18. 300</page><page sequence="11">of south-west Central Asia and including Iranian Khor?s?n as well (41). At the same time certain affinities are evident in the ornament of Dzovi type ware in south-west Iran; and these show how ancient cultural links were orientated, for they avoided the oases of central Iran (42). Indeed, the data available to us substantiates a prudent formulation of this sort, though it would seem that an appropriate solution of the problem will come from the regions of Iranian Khor?s?n rather than from those of southern Turkmenistan, seeing that here, taken as a whole, the Namazga II complex is devoid of local prototypes. Be that as it may, the analogies with Dzovi type ware we have observed extend a con? necting link that had its origin in ancient Iran and must, to a great degree, have influenced the formation of the Namazga II complex. In the eastern zone in the same Namazga II period, on the other hand, we may observe that the art of pottery underwent an undeniable local development of the previous Namazga I type complex. Some insignificant changes are to be observed only as to the sim? plification of the ornamental schemes (43), Even here, however, cultural links are evident that extend to the southernmost districts. These concern buildings that are round in plan and the pottery which is not abundant but furnished with characteristic decorations with which convincing analogies may be observed in the al-cUbaid culture of distant Mesopo? tamia (44). In this sense, the analogies noted, which reflect genuine interconnexions, could in no way avoid the territory of ancient Iran. In this respect, too, the changes observable in the eastern zone in the late Namazga II period are instructive. At that time there was a wide? spread diffusion of the new pottery complex decorated with polychrome geometrical orna? ment applied to vessels with a red or orange ground. The main analogies for this so-called Geoksjur style ware are to be found in the ? buff culture ? ware of southern Iran, and the funerary chambers (tholoi) have features matching fairly closely those of similarly con? structed tombs in ancient Elam (45). Still more striking are the affinities evident in anthropomorphic plastic modelling, the sources of which are to be traced to the regions of southern Mesopotamia (46), if not of south-west Iran (47). In the central zone at the beginning of the next period (Namazga III), there was a diffusion of animal style pottery, and the origin of this is linked to a direct infiltration by some of the Iranian tribes from sites of the Siyalk-Hiss?r type (48). And anthropological (41) V. Mas son, Pamjatniki razvitogo eneolita jugo-zapadnoj Turkmenii {SAI)9 Moskva-Leningrad, 1962, p. 21. (42) Masson, ibid., p. 21.

Analogous material is well represented, too, at Yarim Tepe, and this is evidence for enlarging the area of penetration by central Iranian tribes, extending it to take in the oases in the foothills of the southern Turkmenistan mountains, and excluding only the eastern zone where, contemporaneously, Geoksjur style pottery was diffused (fig. 3). Clearly, at the end of the 4th and at the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C., corresponding to the period of Jemdat Nasr, we may observe definite tribal migratory movements in the ter? ritory of ancient Iran, extending as far as the fertile oases of Turkmenistan. Assuming, moreover, that in the eastern zone this presumed infiltration is linked with southern Iran (? buff culture zone ?), the remaining part of southern Turkmenistan reflects the influence of tribes from central Iran. Bearing in mind the Mesopotamo-Iranian analogies already noted in central Asian material, it is conceivable that these migratory movements were in some way connected with the general historical situation of Mesopotamia in the period of Jemdat Nasr. An acknowledged process that may be observed in the Mesopotamia of this period is the unification of cities like Ur and Uruk to form a State (50) which sought to incorporate additional neighbouring territories within its confines. In this respect, ancient Iran, owing to its rich occurence of metals and industrial stones was an object of special interest from as far back as the Uruk period. The growing needs of the class society and of the priest? hood and aristocracy in particular could well have encouraged expansion eastwards. The fact is that the contemporaneous infiltration at the end of the 4th and the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C. by Iranian tribes into the regions situated at the foot of the mountains throughout the whole of southern Turkmenistan can hardly be explained by a simple splitting up of communities. While postponing the final settlement of this problem till the Proto-Elamite tablets have been deciphered, we may postulate some sort of precise conflict bound up with the eternal rivalry between Sumer and Elam (51). Furthermore? one may assume that even the erection of an Elamite factory on the ruins of the Siyalk III site (52) was hardly a peaceful operation; while we are already informed by written sources about the hostilities between Sumer and Elam around 2800 B.C. This supposed clash could, like a chain reaction, have set in motion a whole vast world of agricultural communities whose distant repercussions can be observed in the archaeological material of Northern Iran and southern Turkmenistan. However, not one single corresponding site in southern Turkmenistan shows traces of an invasion due to war. Evidently on the northern boundary of the ancient oriental world such infiltration was by and large of a fairly peaceful character. What is more, though in the early stages these (49) T.

Thus zoomorphic motifs practically disappear in the Namazga IV-Anau III period, and the pottery in vogue harks back ultimately to vase ornamentation of a Geoksjur type, albeit sharply transformed in appearance. The designs grow poorer and generally speaking are executed in a monochrome technique. This ? carpet ? style of decoration becomes common to the whole of southern Turkmenistan. Observable secondary variations are merely that in the south-east the painted decoration is applied mainly to a red background, while in the central area the same ornaments are carried out on a greenish-white back? ground. Likewise, in the extreme south-west zone vases are of polished grey, reflecting, it would seem, a slight influence by Sah Tepe II type pottery, and even more faintly, by that of Hiss?r II A. It is clear that even at Yarim Tepe grey vases form only a relatively insignificant proportion of the mass of painted pottery typical of the Namazga IV complex. All told, the whole appearence of the material culture of the second half of the 3rd millen? nium B.C. (pottery, anthropomorphic modelling, funerary rites) affords convincing proof that the development of Bronze age communities in southern Turkmenistan was on pro? foundly local lines. Individual north-Iranian affinities ? e.g. the vases at Muhammad?b?d that are wholly analogous to the corresponding pottery of the Namazga IV-Anau III type (53) and look rather like imports ? come within the bounds of normal cultural con? tacts natural for communities peopling bordering territories. In the following period ? Namazga V-Anau III ? a further development in the history of the life of local populations is evident. The potter's wheel that had made its appearance in the previous period now replaced practically all handmade vessels. Painting vanishes completely, but vessels, distinguished by their elegant and precisely modelled forms, are now light-coloured. The basic forms continue the pottery traditions of the previous age, and this is particularly evident in vessels with narrow fluting and in goblets on high and quite often goffered feet. Use of the potter's wheel now meant that vessels of the Namazga V period could be given a more precise, and even at times mannered, form. Moreover, in sites situated between the city of Kizil Arvat and the Gorg?n valley, the amount of grey ware (54) ? more characteristic of sites in north-east Iran ? increased notably amidst other pottery. There is a widely held view that grey ware came from Central Asia when it first appeared in Iran, but it is noteworthy that the latest data attest a movement rather in the opposite direction. In this respect the results of excavations at Turang Tepe are significant, for here in the period of Turang II (end of the 4th-beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C.) grey ware spread widely (55). Clearly, the regions of north-east Iran, and more par (53) H. Frankfort, Studies in Early Pottery of the Near East, London, 1924, I, pi. VII, 2. (54) A. Ganjalin, ?

In this case we can rather speak of it spreading (in the period of Namazga V) from here to the contiguous territory of south-west Turkmenistan as far as the city of Kizil Arvat, and to a lesser degree beyond in an easterly direction. Although on the whole striking affinities, at times most convincing and evident, are displayed, as to the Namazga V period, in Iranian complexes of the Hissar III type, an inadequately elaborated internal chronology as yet prevents any tangible conclusions from being drawn. To be sure, at the end of the 3rd and at the beginning of the 2nd millen? nium B.C., widespread cultural and commercial ties are evident in south-west Asia. In that age, moreover, Harapp? culture reached its peak in the Indus valley thereby enlarg? ing the historical area of suchlike contacts. The ties between Hiss?r and Harapp? culture are widely known (56), and here southern Turkmenia with its intermediate position be? tween north-east Iran and Pakistan, played no mean role. It has been conjectured that while in the chalcolithic period the inhabitants of southern Turkmenistan were more closely linked to the Sumero-Elamite world, a change occurred in the Bronze age and cul? tural ties became orientated towards Harapp? culture (57). In its itself this is a quite straightforward conclusion, since only towards the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C. did the urban civilisation of the Indus Valley take shape, develop, and begin to play an essen? tial part in the history of neighbouring areas. A very revealing proof of this is the number of imported objects like the ivory toy-sticks discovered at Altyn Tepe (58); and also Indian influences evident in the art of the engraver ? for example the seal in the form of a three-headed predatory animal (59). It would seem, nevertheless, that we must not make too much of Harappan influence, since we know that the Altyn Tepe site itself has yielded up objects of the Hiss?r III type that were clearly imported: examples are a grey carafe and a bronze vessel (60). And further: together with the toy-sticks small square slabs made of elephant ivory with tiny disks incised on them have been found; and these are similar to analogous ones found in one of the Hiss?r III c tombs (61). If we add to these finds the axe fitted with tenons unearthed at Altyn Tepe exactly akin to one at Turang Tepe, and take into account the round and cross-shaped seals clearly matching those of Hiss?r (62), as well as the ? wand ?, an exact copy of which is to be found at S?h Tepe (63), the aforesaid affinities become most convincing (fig. 4). And more general affinities have been left aside: e.g. those evident in large pins with a double spiral decoration, and affinities afforded by stone ? weights ? and beads with serrated edges. For some objects moreover, there are also analogies in the ancient archaeological cultures of Pakistan, and this forces us to be more wary in appraising the connexions observed. Evidently there was a new orientation (56) Piggott, ? Dating the Hissar Sequence... ?, ciL, p. 170. (57) V. Mas son, ? Protogorodskaja civilizacija juga Srednej Azii ?, SA, 1967, 3, p. 189. (58) A.

Links with north-east Iran must, in the nature of things, have been more marked in south-west Turkmenia, and the chance find of an axe in the village of Dajn (64) is the first but not the only piece of evidence of this kind. That southeast Turkmenia came within the sphere of reciprocal contacts with the ancient urban civilisation of India, even in an advanced degree, is something that cannot be ruled out; but by and large the evidence so far points to links with Iran. What? ever the truth of the matter, the culture of the inhabitants of the fertile oases in the foothills of the Turkmeno-Khor?s?n mountains and in those of the Kopet Dagh especially was in an intermediate position, and played a very significant part in linking Harappan culture with areas lying to the west. This will be clearly seen by a glance at a map showing the geographical location of the most important objects found which were mainly imported. The proto-urban culture that was taking shape in southern Turkmenistan in this period is seen to be the outcome of a further development of small local communities. And it is not purely fortuitous that the plentiful modelling of human figures {an emotional ba? rometer) in southern Turkmenistan during the age of Namazga V has provided us with a particular iconographical type (fig. 5) quite different from that of Harapp? and northern Iran (65). Towards the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. the decline of many settlements in north-east Iran and southern Turkmenistan and of the cities of the Indus valley can be observed; but its causes hitherto have not been made fully clear to us. At the same time a number of data cast doubts on the current hypothesis that these events were directly correlated. For example, we can note an actual depopulation of most of the settlements in the Gorg?n Valley during the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C.; but J. Deshayes inclines to the view that the cause of this was the setting in of a period of increasing drought (66). Similarly, in southern Turkmenistan in the age of Namazga VI settlements as huge as Altyn Tepe were completely abandoned and life at Namazga Tepe sharply declined; yet in this very period fresh sites sprang up elsewhere (Tekkem Tepe), and even ancient ones continued to survive (Ulug Tepe): indeed, there then came about the conquest of the delta of the river Murgh?b (Aucin, Tahirbaj). Equally problematical is the question of the nature and period of the destruction of the urban civilization of India (6T). (64) A. Ganjalin, ?

It is noteworthy that at Hiss?r, too, traces of habitation in the early Iron Age have been found, which prove that the life of this tangible settlement was not wholly cut short in the late Bronze Age.

What is in many respects a singular complex dating back to the age of Namazga VI is known to us on the south-west frontier of Turkmenia (culture of ancient Dahistan and displays close affinities, even amounting to identity, with north-east Iran. Especially significant are grey-coloured vessels with a complicated spout, a faithful copy of which has been found in sites like Sah Tepe II A, Turang Tepe, Hiss?r III, and to a lesser extent at Tepe Giy?n I and in the cemeteries of Siyalk B. The analogies are so striking that the view has been put forward that there was a genetical relationship between archaic Dahistan pottery and Sah Tepe type ware (68). The circle of analogies is at present being further widened through the discovery of kindred complexes at Kal?r Dast and above all at H?rvin (69) ? once again in the regions of northern Iran. Clearly, the culture of ancient Dahistan is directly and immediately linked with the culture of the sites we are considering. Therefore, the abandonment of settlements like Sah Tepe and Turang Tepe on the one hand, and of archaic Dahistan culture on the other, was practically contemporaneous and, as far as we know, reflects the migration of the communities inhabiting the Gorg?n Valley towards the fertile lands of the Misriyan plateau. Roughly speaking, then, we can say that in the 2nd millennium B.C. north-east Iran and south-west Turkmenia formed part of one single historical and cultural area, bound up with general historical and cultural destinies, as early as the neolithic age. At the same time, in the south of Turkmenistan and in the Murgh?b Oasis, the culture reflects an inde? pendent line of development the roots of which stretch back into the age-old past of the indigenous inhabitants. The conclusions can be briefly stated. It was not the mesolithic of the Caspian region, but the pre-ceramic culture and ancient agricultural peoples of the Turkmeno-Khor?s?n mountains that served as the basis for the formation of the Dzejtun culture. The birth of a new type of economy in the pre-Dzejtun period could have been a stimulating influence which in the end made an impact in the mountain valleys of Kurdistan. The settlements of the ancient agricultural peoples belonging to the Dzejtun culture covered, right from the start, an immense area stretching from the Gorg?n Valley to south-east Turkmenia. There are solid reasons for believing that kindred settlements also existed at the base of the ? triangle of fertile lands ?, and first and foremost in the valley of Kuc?n-Meshed. In the first half of the 5th millennium B.C. we can observe in Iran the diffusion on a pretty vast scale, extending to the frontiers of south-east Turkmenistan, of the culture of the Tell Hassuna cycle. Somewhat later we note the infiltration of people belonging to the Cesme cAli culture, a reflection of which seems to be afforded by the Anau I A complex. Taken as a whole, this period is marked by an undeniable, albeit limited, pene? tration into southern Turkmenistan by people from ancient Iran. (68) V. Masson, ? Pamjatniki kuPtury arhaice skogo Dahistana v jugozapadnoj Turkmenii?, TrJuTAKE, VII, 1956, p. 431. (69) Vanden Berghe, op. cit., pis. 43-53. 309</page><page sequence="20">During the course of the first half of the 4th millennium B.C., the inhabitants of southern Turkmenistan developed their own settled farming culture. In the central and western areas of the same region in the second half of the 4th millennium B.C. (Namazga II) there spread a new style of pottery the sources of which can ultimately be traced to the regions of south-west Iran. Altogether, during almost the whole of the 4th millennium B.C., a profoundly local line of development is reflected in the culture of the inhabitants of southern Turkmenistan. In ancient Iran at the end of the 4th and at the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C. we can observe a shifting of tribal settlements in a migratory movement extending to the northern foothills of the Kopet Dagh. At the foot of the Kopet Dagh range it was the central Iranian tribesmen who infiltrated, but in south-east Turkmenia the migratory link-up was with south-west Iran. We cannot rule out the view that this second stage in the infiltration of such tribal communities may have been a distant echo of political events associated with the Sumero-Elamite rivalry. Down to the end of the 3rd millennium B.C. the development of local culture was marked by the continuation of ancient traditions. Isolated north-Iranian affinities had no essential significance and were episodic in character. At the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 2nd millennium B.C. a proto-urban civilization took shape in southern Turkmenistan, and this stimulated cultural, and above all commercial, ties on a wider scale. Accordingly, we can observe ties both with Harappan culture and that of north-east Iran, which is to be expected in a territory with an inter? mediate geographical position. Nevertheless, even in this period, traditional ties with Iran are more conspicuous than those with Harapp?, especially as regards settlements in south? west Turkmenistan. Events occurring towards the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. and involving the regions of north-west Iran and southern Turkmenistan are not wholly clear to us; but they did not lead to a breakdown in cultural contacts between these two areas. Indeed, the culture of ancient Dahistan is seen to have a genetic connexion with north-east, a con? nexion that earlier had not extended beyond the areas bordering on the rivers Sumbar and Atrek. This may represent the third period in the history of such ties which, as far as material culture is concerned, are a very tangible reality even though limited in extent territorially.
