SILK Department of Anthropology, University of California, Los Angeles, Calif. 90024, U.S.A. 23 XII 9I For those interested in the evolution of human societies, the scale of human social organization presents an inter- esting problem. A number of authors have argued that human social organization involves cooperation that is too widespread to be explained by nepotism or kin selec- tion (Alexander I987; Boyd and Richerson I990; Camp- bell I975, i983). Instead, they have suggested that wide- spread cooperation in human societies may be based upon reciprocity. This argument relies upon the theory of reciprocal altruism (Trivers I97 I), which predicts that reciprocity will be favored by natural selection if indi- viduals restrict their help to those who help them in retum. This process is favored because, over time, the participants in reciprocal relationships obtain benefits that balance the costs of their interactions. In contrast to kin selection, reciprocity does not rely upon the par- ticipants' being kin. This insight has generated considerable theoretical and empirical interest in the factors that may shape the evolution of cooperative behavior. There have been a number of efforts to formalize and expand Trivers's orig- inal theoretical formulation (reviewed by Axelrod and Dion I989, Boyd n.d.), and there has also been consider- able interest in empirical evidence of cooperative behav- ior in other mammalian species, particularly the nonhu- man primates. Since the nonhuman primates are our closest living relatives, analysis of the patteming of co- operative activities among them may provide important insights into the phylogenetic history of the cognitive and behavioral mechanisms that underlie reciprocity in humans. Coalitions provide a particularly useful context in which to study the patteming of cooperation in nonhu- man primates. A dyadic confrontation is transformed into a coalition when a third individual intervenes on behalf of one of the original participants. Although it is impossible to assess quantitatively the effects of specific behavioral acts upon lifetime fitness, coalitions are gen- erally considered to be a form of altruism which is bene- ficial to the recipient and costly to the donor (see Dun- bar I988 for a full discussion of this issue). The individual who receives support may benefit if interven- tion increases the probability that the opponent will flee, submit, or redirect its aggression to the supporter. The supporter may suffer some costs if it expends en- ergy, suffers an injury, or becomes the target of the oppo- nent's aggression. Over the last I5 years, the frequency and patteming of support in agonistic interactions have been described in a variety of primate species. While differences in sam- pling techniques, behavioral definitions, and methods of analysis make it difficult to compare these studies directly, some general conclusions emerge from them: individuals tend to give the most support to their rela- tives, and the tendency to support kin is particularly pronounced in confrontations with older, larger, or higher-ranking group members (e.g., Gorilla gorilla go- rilla [Harcourt and Stewart, I987, I989], Pan troglodytes [de Waal i9821, Papio ursinus [Cheney I9771, Cercopi- thecus aethiops [Cheney I983, Horrocks and Hunte I983], M. mulatta [Bemstein and Ehardt I985, Kaplan I9771, M. fascicularis [de Waal I978], M. nemestrina [Massey I9771, M. radiata [Silk i982], M. fuscata [Kur- land I977, Watanabe I9791). However, not all support is performed on behalf of kin; virtually all of the studies cited above report that monkeys and apes sometimes support unrelated individ- uals. Reciprocity in support was first reported among unrelated male baboons, which form coalitions in con- tests over access to estrous females (Packer I977). Simi- lar coalitions have subsequently been described at sev- eral other sites, although the extent of reciprocity in support among males has been questioned (Bercovitch I988, Nod i989). Reciprocity in support has also been documented among vervet monkeys (Hunte and Hor- rocks i987) and macaques (de Waal and Luttrell i988). Seyfarth and Cheney have demonstrated that vervet monkeys and baboons provide support in agonistic inter- actions for individuals that groom them (Cheney I977; Cheney and Seyfarth I990; Seyfarth I977, I980), al- though this does not seem to hold true for female bonnet macaques (Silk i982) or rhesus macaques (de Waal and Luttrell i986). Seyfarth and Cheney (i984) performed a particularly insightful experiment in which they explored the condi- tions under which grooming might be exchanged for support among free-ranging vervet monkeys. In this ex- periment, a tape-recorded distress call was played back to a subject from a hidden speaker under two different conditions: (a) after it had been groomed by the caller and (b) when no grooming had been observed. Uf the sub- ject had been groomed by the caller it was more likely to respond to the distress call by staring intently in the direction of the speaker. When the subject and caller were closely related, the subject's response was not in- fluenced by whether or not the caller had recently groomed it. Seyfarth and Cheney's results demonstrated that one form of altruism, support, was contingent upon another, grooming. They also suggested that the rules for social exchange may vary among kin and nonkin, i. ? I992 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

While most analyses of reciprocity have focused upon the exchange of interactions among supporters and those who receive support, some workers have consid- ered the nature of behavioral exchanges among support- ers and their opponents. De Waal and Luttrell (i988) define a "revenge system" as one in which individuals intervene selectively against the individuals who most often intervene against them. They report that male chimpanzees housed at the Arnhem Zoo intervened most often against those who intervened against them but that female rhesus and stump-tailed macaques at the Wisconsin Regional Primate Center did not do so. They suggest that this pattem of intervention occurs in chimpanzees but not in macaques because macaques have more rigidly structured dominance hierarchies than do chimpanzees and are therefore more inhibited about challenging higher-ranking individuals. They con- clude that in macaques "it seems reasonable to assume that complete reciprocity, including both pro and contra interventions, does not occur, whatever the circum- stances" (de Waal and Luttrell i988:iI5). Male bonnet macaques (M. radiata) are known to in- tervene frequently in conflicts among other males both in the wild and in captivity (Simonds I974, Silk n.d.a). In a large and stable captive group housed at the California Primate Research Center in Davis, Calif., mature males intervened in approximately one-quarter of all dyadic contests involving other mature males. Previous analy- ses of these events have demonstrated that males tend to intervene on behalf of reciprocating partners (Silk n.d.a). The purpose of this paper is to assess the nature of these contingent behavioral strategies more fully. The results indicate that in this group males selectively support those who support and groom them, intervene most of- ten against those who most often intervene against them, and are most loyal to their relatives and those who are most loyal to them. These results are note- worthy, in part, because neither "revenge" nor "loyalty" has previously been demonstrated in monkeys. I use these admittedly anthropomorphic terms-reciprocity, revenge, and loyalty-each explicitly defined, because the alternatives are either excessively obscure or cum- bersome. Nothing is implied by them about the cogni- tive processes or motivations that underlie monkeys' be- havior. METHODS The data described here were collected at the Califomia Primate Research Center on the campus of the Univer- sity of California, Davis. The subjects were members of a large group of bonnet macaques housed in a o.2-ha outdoor enclosure. The group was originally founded in October I970 and has been maintained for behavioral research since I975 (see Silk I988 for details). During this period, natal males have been removed periodically and unfamiliar males have been introduced. No females have been introduced into the group since I97I. Few females were removed from the group between I 975 and I983, but in I983 the eight lowest-ranking females and their dependent offspring were removed en masse and installed in a separate enclosure. Matemal kinship rela- tionships were known for all individuals in the group. At the time the study began in September I988, the group contained 70 monkeys. There were i6 mature males (aged &gt; 6 years), 2i mature females (aged &gt; 4 years), and 33 juveniles (aged &lt; 4 years). By chance, there were no males in the group aged 4-6 years. All of the mature males remained in the group until the study ended in August I989. The subjects ranged in age from 6 to I7 years at the beginning of the study. Although many of the males had lived in the group for a number of years, their origins were diverse. Six were born in another group and introduced later into this one. Three were born in the group but belonged to matrilines that were subsequently removed from the group en masse, leaving only them. Two natal males belonged to matri- lines that had no other living members. Five males were bom in the group and belonged to extant matrilines. Data for these analyses were drawn from io-minute focal animal samples conducted on each of the i6 ma- ture males and ad libitum observations of aggressive en- counters and coalitions. The group was observed for 55o hours over the course of the year. Approximately four samples were completed on each male during each week of the study. All local observations were made between o800 and 1200 hours. A total of 2,706 focal samples were completed, and each male was observed at least i 60 times (range I6I-I74 observations per male). During the focal samples, all instances of affiliation, aggression, competition, greetings, and support were re- corded. Also recorded, whenever possible, was the iden- tity of the individual(s) who initiated and terminated the interaction. Aggressive interactions (threats, chases, bites, attacks, acts of submission) and coalitions involv- ing all members of the group were also recorded ad libi- tum. Uf a coalition occurred during a focal sample, the sample was interrupted and the coalition was moni- tored. Then, if the focal sample had been interrupted for less than two minutes, it was finished; otherwise, a new focal sample was begun. All focal data were recorded directly onto a portable computer programmed in BASIC (Tandy Model ioo). Observations of simple coalitions were typed directly onto the computer. Observations of more complicated coalitions were dictated into a tape recorder and later transcribed. All coalition records were coded in a stan- dard format for analysis. These coded records provide information about the (a) date and time of the event, (b) the name(s) of the individual(s) who initated the interac- tion, (c) the name(s) of the recipient(s) in the initial inter- action, (d) the nature of the actions and responses of initiator(s) and recipient(s) before the coalition began, (e) any submissive responses by the initiator(s) or recipi- ent(s) after the coalition began, (f) the names of other individuals who became involved in the interaction (supporters), (g) the party (initiator or recipient) who was</page><page sequence="3">320 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY given aid by each supporter, (h) the form of participation of each supporter, and (i) any submissive responses given by any of the supporters. The analyses presented below are based upon a subset of the total number of coalitions involving adult males that were observed over the course of the year. The sam- ple was limited to coalitions that followed dyadic inter- actions for two reasons: (i) In coalitions involving mul- tiple initiators or recipients of aggression it was difficult to determine whether the supporter was helping one or all of the members of a given faction or directing aggres- sion against one or all of the members of the opposing faction. (2) It was not clear how single acts of aid to multiple initiators or multiple recipients should be ap- portioned. Thus, the analysis is based upon 664 coali- tions that followed aggressive interactions involving just one male initiator and one male recipient. These coalitions constitute 78% of all coalitions involving adult males that were observed. Over the course of the year, 2,6i9 dyadic agonistic interactions among adult males were observed, and I,7I6 (66%) of these were decided before others inter- vened. (A decided encounter was one in which one, but not both, of the participants displayed signs of submis- sion [grimace, tail up].) These interactions were used to assess male dominance relationships. All dyadic aggres- sive contests with clearly decided outcomes that were observed in a given calendar month were entered onto a square matrix. The ordering of males was manipulated to produce the smallest number of entries below the diagonal. Two additional assumptions were used to or- der males who were not observed to interact agonisti- cally in a given month. First, it was assumed that if no dominance interactions were observed in a given month, their dominance relationships had not changed during that month. On average, 52% of the i20 pairs of males interacted during each month (range = 23-80% of dyads interacted per month). Second, it was assumed that male dominance relationships were transitive. That is, if A defeated B and B defeated C but A did not interact with C, then A outranked both B and C. This assumption was justified by the fact that the outcome of 98% of all interactions between males each month on average (range = 92-i00% interactions) could be accurately pre- dicted from their positions in the monthly dominance hierarchy. There was on average only one violation of transitivity per month among the i20 possible dyads. A coalition was defined here as any interaction in which two or more individuals jointly challenged or were challenged by one or more opponents. A supporter was defined as an individual who intervened in an ongo- ing dispute on behalf of the initiator or the recipient of the initial confrontation. When a supporter provided support to the initiator of the initial confrontation, the initiator's and supporter's common opponent or target was the recipient of the initial confrontation. When a supporter provided support to the recipient of the initial confrontation, the recipient's and supporter's common opponent was the initiator in the original interaction. If the supporter threatened, chased, hit, grappled, or bit its target, an active response was scored. A passive response was scored when the supporter and one of the original participants made physical contact with one another but the supporter did not direct any overt aggressive gestures toward the target. (For example, supporters sometimes wrapped their tails around each other, embraced, or ad- vanced toward the target while maintaining contact with one another.) RESULTS The basic structure and context of coalitions among male bonnet macaques are described elsewhere (Silk n.d. a, b). The results of these analyses may be summarized as follows: Male bonnet macaques formed coalitions once every 39 minutes on average over the course of the year. Most coalitions followed spontaneous outbursts of aggression between two males, and supporters intervened on behalf of initiators about twice as often as they intervened on behalf of recipients. Support seemed to be beneficial to recipients and costly to supporters in that (a) the benefi- ciaries of support reduced the probability of being de- feated when they and their supporters outnumbered their opponents and (b) supporters were sometimes in- timidated when they intervened in ongoing disputes. Coalitions were not directly related to contests over ac- cess to receptive females or other resources. Although males did support their mature matemal kin more often than they supported unrelated males on average, not many of the males were related to one another, and all males supported nonkin as well as kin. As a result, sup- port of kin accounted for only 7% of all acts of support observed. Coalitions seemed to have little systematic effect upon the ranks of those who intervened, the ranks of those who received help, or the overall stability of the male dominance hierarchy. Males did tend to intervene on behalf of reciprocating partners. Uf support among unrelated individuals is a form of altruism, then we might expect to find that males com- pensate their supporters in some way for the costs in- curred on their behalf. As do male baboons who recipro- cally solicit each other's help in challenging consorting males (Packer I977), male bonnet macaques might sup- port the males who support them. They might also ex- change support for grooming, as some monkeys do (Cheney and Seyfarth I990 and references therein). Previous analyses of the patteming of support in this group have provided evidence of reciprocity in support but very little evidence that support is exchanged for grooming. These results were based upon correlational assessments of the association between the number of times one male supported or groomed his partner and the number of times his partner supported or groomed him. Here, the data are reanalyzed using a more power- ful matrix manipulation procedure, the Mantel test. This test was designed to assess the association between matrices in which cell entries are not independent (Man- tel i967) and is the statistical test generally recom- mended to assess associations between two kinds of</page><page sequence="4">Volume 33, Number 3, June 1992 1 32I pairwise interactions. (For details about computation procedures, see Hemelrijk iggo.) The probability level associated with the Mantel test statistic, Z, was calcu- lated by the random permutation measure outlined by Hemelrijk (I990). For each test, values from 2,ooo ran- dom permutations were calculated, and the distribution of these values was used to assess the significance of the observed value. The males in the group supported most of their fellow males on at least one occasion. The average male sup- ported I 3.4 (range = 8-I 5) of the i 5 other males in the group. There was considerable variability in both the frequency and extent of reciprocity in support among pairs of males. Overall, however, males consistently supported the males from whom they received the most support (r = 0.3490, n = I20, Z = 7098, p &lt; o.ooi). The exclusion of interactions involving all pairs of re- lated males does not affect the pattem of the results. Males often groomed each other, although the distri- bution of grooming was not as widespread as the distri- bution of support. The average male was groomed by 9.2 other males in the group (range 4-I3). Again, there was considerable variation in the frequency with which males were groomed by each of the others. The Mantel test indicates that males gave the most support to those who most often groomed them (r = 0.2738, n = i10, Z = 385 I, p &lt; 0.00)I. Again, the exclusion of interactions involving pairs of related males does not affect the pat- tern of the results. When males intervene in ongoing disputes, they may be able to harass or intimidate others at relatively little cost to themselves. Uf so, coalitions might provide a means for males to direct aggression toward males that they would be reluctant to challenge on their own. More specifically, in what de Waal and Luttrell (i988) have called revenge, males might intervene against those who had defeated them in dyadic contests or had intervened against them in the past. While the analyses up to this point have focused upon aid given in support of particular partners, this analysis focused upon support directed against specific individu- als. The number of times each male intervened against each of the others was tabulated from the coalition rec- ords, and the number of times each male defeated the other over the course of the year was determined. Matri- ces derived from these data were constructed to assess the patterning of these events. As before, the Mantel test was used to evaluate the associations between the pairs of the relevant interaction matrices. Most males intervened against most of the others. The average male intervened against i2 of the other I5 males (range = 7-I5). Overall, 77% of all interventions were directed toward males who were lower-ranking than the actor at the time. There was at least one de- cided dominance encounter for each pair of males in the group, but the frequency of dominance encounters among males varied considerably. On average, each male defeated i o of the other I 5 males at least once (range = 5-I. Males intervened most often against those who inter- vened most often against them (r = 0.3538, n = i20, Z = 7054, p = o.oi6). However, there was no consistent association between the frequency with which males de- feated others in dyadic contests and the frequency with which those males intervened against them (r = O.I537, n = i20, Z = 670, p = 0.370). In both cases, the exclu- sion of interactions involving pairs of related males does not affect the pattern of the results. These results are somewhat surprising because it is difficult to see how males could intervene selectively against those who intervened against them if they gener- ally avoid intervening against higher-ranking males. One way to explain this contradiction is to consider the timing of these events more carefully. The data pre- sented here were collected during a i2-month period. Numerous rank changes occurred during the course of the year (Silk n.d. b). The tendency for males to inter- vene against those who intervened against them and for males to avoid challenging higher-ranking males might arise as follows: Suppose that A intervenes against B during a period in which he dominates B. Then, B chal- lenges and defeats A. Now, B begins to intervene against A. This would produce the observed correlation without requiring males to intervene against higher-ranking males. The simplest way to evaluate this hypothesis is to consider the pattern of intervention among pairs of males whose ranks did not change over the course of the year. If temporal changes in rank relationships among males were responsible for the observed association be- tween the numbers of times each male intervened against the other, then this association should disappear or even be reversed among pairs of males whose ranks remained stable. There were no changes over the course of the year in the relative ranks of 73 (6i %) of the i20 pairs of males (Silk n.d. b). Among these pairs the num- ber of times that A intervened against B was positively correlated with the number of times that B intervened against A (r = o.2894, n = 73). At the same time, high- ranking males typically intervened against lower- ranking partners more often than low-ranking males in- tervened against higher-ranking partners. Among the 73 pairs of males with stable rank relationships, the higher-ranking of the two males intervened against his partner on average 5.8 times (s.d. = 6.i2), while his part- ner intervened against him on average I.7 times (s.d. = 2.48, t = 5.87, p &lt; O.OOI, d.f. = 72). The data presented above suggest that males selec- tively supported those who supported and groomed them and intervened against those who intervened against them. This evidence of reciprocity and revenge might imply that males sorted other males into distinct categories: allies and adversaries. If they did so, we might expect to find a negative correlation between the number of times one male supported another and the number of times he intervened against that other. In fact, the observed correlation is positive (r = 0.II48, n = i20), and the association between support for and intervention against other males is statistically signifi- cant (Z = 7226, p = o.oo6). The exclusion of interac-</page><page sequence="5">322 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY tions involving related males does not affect the results. This means that males supported and intervened against the same males. Although males supported and intervened against the same males, they may have been more loyal to some than to others-that is, they may have consistently sup- ported some and not intervened against them and vice versa. This possibility can be assessed with the follow- ing dyadic loyalty index: A supports B/A supports B + A intervenes against B. Uf A always supports B and never intervenes against him, the second term in the denominator will be o, and the measure will equal i. If A is as likely to support B as he is to intervene against him, the value will be o.s. If A invariably intervenes against B and rarely supports him, the measure will approach o. The measure is unde- fined for I 5 pairs of males because the focal male neither supported nor intervened against his partner. There proved to be considerable variation in males' loyalty. Possible sources of this variation examined were idiosyncratic differences, kinship, the behavior of the partner, and the identity of the opponent. The average values of the loyalty index for individual males with all of their partners fell within a fairly nar- row range (0.49-0.69), and there was no significant vari- ation among males in these values (one-way analysis of variance, F = 0.4707, p = 0.953I, d.f. = I5,20og). Thus there is no evidence that some males were consistently more loyal to all of their partners than were others. Loyalty was on average higher among the io pairs of related males (mean = 0.73, s.e. = o.o6) than among the 2I5 pairs of unrelated males (mean = 0.54, s.e. = 0.02, t = 2.97, p = O.OI3, d.f. = II.I4). Six of the seven males who had mature male kin in the group were more loyal to their kin than to unrelated males (sign test, p = o.o62) [fig. il. Thus there is some evidence that kinship enhanced the degree of loyalty. o Kin * Nonkin 1.0 ,z 0.8 c &gt; 0.6 '0.4 0 j 0.2 0.0 BG RO RU MA RN JI GR FIG. i. Loyalty among kin and nonkin for the seven males who have relatives in the group. The ordering of males on the horizontal axis is arbitrary. A male's loyalty to his partner was positively associ- ated with his partner's loyalty to him (r = 0.2373, n = 2I0, p &lt; O.OOI). It was impossible to use the Mantel test to test the significance of this relationship because the value of the loyalty index was undefined for a number of pairs of males. Instead, separate correlations were computed for each male. Twelve of these correlations were positive and four were negative, a distribution that differs significantly from chance (binomial probability = 0.038). Thus a significant fraction of the males were most loyal to the males who were most loyal to them. Males' loyalties to their partners in contests with par- ticular opponents were assessed with the following in- dex: A supports B vs. C/A supports B vs. C + A supports C vs. B. This triadic loyalty index equals I if A always supports B against C and never intervenes on behalf of C against B. The i6 males formed a total of 3,600 possi- ble triads. The index could be computed for I,I30 of these triads; in the remaining cases, the focal male did not support either of the other two males in confronta- tions with one another and the denominator was o. The sample size was further reduced by half because the trios are symmetric: A's loyalty to B against C is simply the inverse of A's loyalty to C against B. One male's loyalty to his partner in contests with a particular opponent was consistently related to his part- ner's loyalty to him in contests with that opponent. As before, separate correlations were computed for each of the males. Fourteen of the resulting correlation coeffi- cients were positive and two were negative, a distribu- tion that differs significantly from chance (binomial probability = 0.002). These results suggest that males' loyalties to their partners may depend at least in part upon the identity of their opponents and that males may be willing to support each of their partners against some males but not against others. Uf such patterns were stable over time, they could account for some of the observed varia- tion in the extent of loyalty among males. For example, if males' loyalties were ordered in a perfect linear se- quence such that A was more loyal to B than to C and A was more loyal to C than to D, then we would be able to predict A's behavior in contests among B, C, and D. That is, A would never intervene against B; he would support C in contests with anyone but B and would sup:- port D in contests with anyone but B and C. To investigate whether males' loyalties were ordered in such a way, a loyalty rank order was determined for each male: the partner to whom the focal male was most loyal was assigned a rank of I, the partner with the next highest loyalty index was assigned a rank of 2, and so on. Then the number of times that each focal male had intervened against or defected against each of his part- ners was tabulated. (The term "defection" is borrowed from the game-theory literature, where it is used to mean that one partner failed to cooperate.) For each of these acts of defection, it was determined whether the focal male had supported a male who ranked higher or lower in his own loyalty rank order than the male that he defected against. If males' loyalties followed a linear</page><page sequence="6">Volume 33, Number 3, June 1992 I 323 rank order, then all defections would be on behalf of males who ranked higher in their loyalty rank orders. If males' support behavior was based upon other factors, males would be equally likely to defect against their partners on behalf of males who ranked higher and lower in their loyalty rank order. When defections by all males were combined, 78% were performed on behalf of males who ranked as high or higher in their loyalty rank order (binomial probability = o.oooi). One obvious problem in interpreting these values is that males' choice of partners to whom they were more or less loyal was sometimes constrained. For example, when a male intervened against a male who was ranked at the bottom of his loyalty rank order, he could only intervene in favor of a male who ranked higher in his loyalty rank order. Similarly, when a male intervened against a male who ranked at the top of his loyalty rank order, he inevitably intervened in favor of a male who ranked lower. These two sources of bias do not cancel each other out because the absolute number of defec- tions against those ranked at the bottom of the loyalty rank order is much greater than the number of defec- tions against males ranked at the top of the loyalty rank order. Although this logical problem cannot be resolved, it may be avoided by restricting attention to middle- ranked partners (males ranked 6-io). For partners ranked within this range, the probability of defecting on behalf of males ranked higher in the loyalty rank order was reduced but remained significantly greater than ex- pected by chance (63%, p &lt; o.ooI). DISCUSSION The coalitions described here provide a compelling ex- ample of the complex social structure that underlies the interactions among individuals in nonhuman primate groups. These male bonnet macaques maintained and negotiated a complicated matrix of social relationships with the other males in their group. Virtually all pairs of males groomed each other, fought with each other, supported each other, and intervened against each other. Males in this group rewarded their supporters and retali- ated against their adversaries. They were most loyal to their relatives and to the males who were most loyal to them and seemed consistently to support some males against others. These results are noteworthy, in part, because neither revenge nor loyalty has previously been demonstrated in monkeys. In this group, many males supported the same males that they intervened against. The tendency to intervene both for and against the same males suggests that males did not make simple distinctions between their allies and their adversaries, supporting the former and in- tervening against the latter. This does not mean that males were completely indiscriminate or opportunistic in their intervention strategies. Rather, they seemed to regulate the distribution of support in very systematic ways. The positive association between support given and support received suggests that males monitored how much support they gave other males and how much they had received from the same males. Previous analyses have shown that pairs of males who had the most bal- anced levels of support were the pairs who supported each other most often. This suggests that males may have stopped supporting males who failed to reciprocate (Silk n.d.a). The existence of revenge suggests that males monitored the amount of aggression that they directed toward other males as well as aggression that they re- ceived from other males. Finally, evidence that loyalty was reciprocated suggests that males may have had some means of integrating information about how often their partners supported them and how often they inter- vened against them. These data also imply that the ob- served patterns of behavior are not an epiphenomenon of affinities based upon proximity or antipathies based upon lack of familiarity with other group members. Some readers may be skeptical of the claims that monkeys establish complex social strategies as I have suggested here because we know nothing about the cog- nitive mechanisms that underlie their behavior and in- teractions. The observational data clearly leave many important questions about those processes unresolved. We do not know, for example, how monkeys remember the identity of their partners, what accounting schemes they use to balance exchanges between support and grooming, how long they can remember who has done what to whom, and so on. This kind of information is more likely to come from carefully designed experimen- tal studies than from naturalistic observations. Observa- tional studies are important, however, because they pro- vide preliminary evidence of the existence of complex behavioral phenomena that require explanation at both the proximate and the distal level. Theoretical analyses of reciprocity emphasize the con- tingent nature of cooperative interactions: one individ- ual should help another only if the other helps him (Trivers I97 I). When partners defect, reciprocal relation- ships subsequently deteriorate (Axelrod and Hamilton i98 i). Here, reciprocity, revenge, and loyalty were iden- tified by correlational analyses which measured the di- rection and significance of the association between males' behavior toward their partners and their partners' behavior toward them over the course of a year. These analyses do not directly assess the contingent nature of males' relationships with their partners. In order to es- tablish whether one male's behavior is actually contin- gent upon the behavior of his partner, more detailed in- formation about the temporal sequence of males' interactions is needed. With such information, one might be able to estimate how quickly support is recip- rocated, how many defections are tolerated before alli- ances are jeopardized, and whether males' behavior is directly affected by the behavior of their partners. De Waal and Luttrell (I988), who report revenge in chimpanzees but not in rhesus macaques, conclude that the rigidity of dominance hierarchies inhibits the latter from challenging higher-ranking individuals. There is no doubt that rhesus macaques generally avoid intervening against higher-ranking individuals; 88% of all interven- tions were directed against lower-ranking individuals.</page><page sequence="7">324 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY De Waal and Luttrell cite two other studies of rhesus macaques in which supporters were higher-ranking than their targets 68% and 78% of the time (Bemstein and Ehardt i985, Kaplan I977). The figures for these bonnet macaques are comparable: the supporter was higher- ranking than his target approximately three-quarters of the time. These figures are all considerably higher than the proportion of interventions against lower-ranking individuals observed among chimpanzees at Arnhem (50-52% [de Waal and Luttrell i988]1). There may be several reasons that revenge was found among these bonnet macaques but not among rhesus and stump-tailed macaques. First, there may be real dif- ferences in behavior among these three macaque spe- cies. A number of workers have documented striking differences in styles of dominance, pattems of aggres- sion, and forms of reconciliation among various ma- caque species (e.g., Thierry I986; de Waal and Luttrell I988, I989; de Waal and Ren i988). Second, there may be differences in the behavior of male and female ma- caques. De Waal's data come mostly from adult females; the data presented here are drawn from observations of mature males. Female macaques normally have more stable dominance relationships than do male macaques, and this may contribute to their reluctance to challenge higher-ranking individuals. Third, differences in envi- ronmental conditions, particularly population density, may influence the patterning of behavior. De Waal and Luttrell (i988) found that chimpanzees behaved more like macaques when they were restricted to cramped indoor quarters during the winter months. The ma- caques that they studied were observed while they were locked into a 75 _-M2 enclosure. The rhesus group was composed of 5o-6o animals and the stump-tailed group of 25. The densities of these groups were 0.67 and 0.33 monkeys per square meter, respectively. The 70 bonnet macaques were housed in an i,836-m2 enclosure, with a density of 0.04 monkeys per square meter. Thus the more chimpanzee-like behavior of the bonnet macaques might be a function of the lower densities at which they lived. In this group, coalitions were common and the pattem of intervention was richly structured. Thus, it is some- what surprising that the function of these coalitions is not immediately obvious. Coalitions do not seem to pro- vide males with immediate access to receptive females or important resources. They do not seem to have a clear and consistent impact upon males' dominance relation- ships (Silk n.d. b) and do not consistently enhance inclu- sive fitness. They do, however, substantially change a male's chance of defeating his opponent, as the relative size and collective power of opposing factions influences the outcome of polyadic interactions. Males who are able to recruit more supporters or more powerful sup- porters than their opponents are less likely to be de- feated. However, it may be misleading to equate the proximate consequences of coalitions with their func- tion. In order to understand more fully the adaptive function of coalitions in this species, we may need to examine the behavior in a more realistic environmental context and to conduct carefully controlled laboratory experiments in which critical elements of coalitions can be manipulated. The patterning of reciprocity, revenge, and loyalty among male bonnet macaques described here comple- ments the emerging notion that primates make subtle and sophisticated assessments of their relationships with conspecifics (Cheney and Seyfarth iggo). These as- sessments appear to take into account both qualitative and quantitative components of relationships. For exam- ple, vervets categorize other vervets in several dimen- sions, including relative dominance rank, degree of re- latedness, and group membership (Cheney and Seyfarth iggo). The degree of reciprocity in support and grooming suggests that nonhuman primates also monitor the mag- nitude of costs incurred and benefits received from oth- ers, even when their exchanges involve different behav- ioral currencies and contexts. Taken together, these data suggest that reciprocity may have very deep roots in pri- mate phylogeny. References Cited ALEXANDER, R. D. I987. The biology of moral systems. New York: Aldine de Gruyter.
