<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASPECTS OF LATVIAN FOLKLORE IN HERBERT VON HOERNER'S NOVELLA DER GROßE BAUM John Whiton, University of Waterloo (Ontario) Herbert von Hoerner (1 884-1950), the Baltic German author whose novella Der große Baum * is the subject of this brief study, was born on his family's estate southwest of Jelgava in what was then the Russian Baltic province of Courland. He was essentially trilingual. German and Latvian he learned naturally while growing up. He spoke German to the Germans and Latvian with the Latvians, most of whom were farm workers on his father's lands. And of course he acquired a thorough knowledge of Russian, due to the Tsarist government's Russification policy in force at the time. Hoerner studied painting in Italy and was on his way home via Germany when World War One broke out. Interned as an enemy alien, Hoerner was allowed to return to German-occupied Courland in 1917. In 1919 and 1920 he served in the Baltische Landeswehr, a Baltic German fighting unit supported by Britain and the fledgling Latvian government, which was helping to expel the Bolshevik forces. In 1920, in the wake of the expropriation of the German estates in the Baltic, Hoerner - now penniless - emigrated to Germany and settled in his wife's hometown of Görlitz in Lower Silesia on the Saxon border. There he found employment as an art teacher in a local high school and turned to writing. During World War Two Hoerner served as an interpreter for the German army in occupied Ukraine and later as a Russian language instructor at an army base in Breslau. He was arrested in 1945 on the streets of Görlitz because when he was stopped by the Soviet military police for an identity check he made the fatal mistake of addressing the officer in charge in perfect Russian - most suspicious! Hoerner never saw freedom again and died on May 8, 1950 at the hands of drunken GDR prison guards who were celebrating the fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War by tormenting the inmates. * All quotations are taken from the 1938 edition: Herbert von Hoerner, Der große Baum (Stuttgart: Engelhorn Nachf., 1938).

The precise locale is the domain of a Baltic baron with its vast pine forests, its Schloß or grand manor house, and the thatched, wooden cottages of the Latvians who are employed as farm workers on the estate. One of the latter plays a prominent role in the story. He is the forester to whom Hoerner assigns the appropriately symbolic name "Eglis" which is Latvian for fir tree. This is appropriate because Eglis knows every inch of the forest, every nook and cranny, like the palm of his hand - so much so that he seems part of the wood it is his duty to watch over. The plot is easily retold. On a fine winter's day Eglis has just seen off the local lumber dealer and pocketed his ruble tip when he sees a sleigh approaching. It is the lord of the manor with his precious little grandson and sole heir, Alexander, whose parents are dead. Eglis accompanies the pair on an inspection tour of part of the forest, and is happy to carry little Alexander on his broad shoulders. The boy is fascinated by a magnificent specimen of pine (pinus silvestris), a huge and majestic tree of great age, standing straight and alone on its hillock jutting into the moor. This is indeed the monarch of the forest and the parent of all the pines in the vicinity. Alexander is so drawn to the tree that he asks his grandfather to give it to him, which the old man gladly does, since everything will soon go to the boy in any case. In the winter the days are short. It is time to take Alexander home, for dusk is approaching. As the old man drives his sleigh across the snow to the warmth and protection of the Schloß, where grandmother will have a warm meal ready, a sudden and vehement storm overtakes them. So blinding are the swirling masses of snow that it is only with the greatest effort and no little luck that the elderly baron finds his way to the safety of his house. Foolishly the grandfather allows Alexander to accompany a servant who has appeared to take the horse to the barn. But the stable boy and the horse are too fast for Alexander, and as they disappear into the blizzard, he wanders off in the wrong direction. Soon it is apparent to him that he is lost. It is now dark and bitterly cold, and Alexander is tiring fast from wading through the deep snow. Oh, how he would like to succumb to the sweet urge to fall asleep! But a voice tells him to keep going and to stay awake. Ifheisto survive the night, Alexander must find shelter soon. Is nature a blind, impersonal force, indifferent to human fate? Or is nature's power mysteriously paradoxical in that it can be both life- threatening and life-sustaining at the same time? Hoerner would seem to opt for the second possibility, because what he explicitly calls a miracle is for Alexander the event that saves his life. That very same wind which causes the threatening snow storm is also the wind which blows down the great tree, Alexander's tree. In falling, the trunk is uprooted, opening up a cave-like hole with the large earth-bound root clump forming a protective canopy over</page><page sequence="3">328 John Whiton it. By coincidence (or providence?) Alexander has stumbled upon the fallen giant just in time. He knows he will be safe if he crawls in the hole. Once ensconced there he can safely fall asleep. In that stormy night Eglis had heard a loud crash. He knew instinctively that it was the great tree falling. As soon as it is daylight he goes to inspect the damage. The nervous barking of his dog calls his attention to the hole under the clump of roots, and peering in, Eglis finds little Alexander safe and sound. Then Eglis hears voices. It is the grandfather with a search party. Alexander has been found, thanks be to God! And what is to be the fate of the fallen giant whose straight trunk, in the opinion of the lumber dealer, would make a perfect ship's mast or an axle for a grist mill? The tree that saved Alexander's life must be put to a more appropriate, less mundane use. The grandfather orders that the huge trunk be sawed up into boards, that the boards be stored in the church attic, and that they be used solely to make cradles and coffins. So ends Der große Baum. There are several features of this novella that are suggestive of folklore. There is the androgynous and fertile nature of the pine for example, "Mann und Weib in Eins," as Hoerner expresses it, "Ahn alles Kiefernwaldes ringsum.... Weit verbreitet ist ihr Nachwuchs, und immer noch zeugt sie neuen. Längst sind Kinder und Kindeskinder, jedes Vater und Mutter zugleich, selber Ahnen geworden" (S. 5). The fecundity of the archpine does not diminish with age: "Aber auch in dem Urahn ist noch die Kraft der Jugend. Auch von ihm stäubt es gelb.... Den Segen, maßlos verschwendet im Überfluß, empfangt an der Spitze des Zweiges die Blüte" (S. 5). Androgyny and fertility are ancient archetypes figuring in Indo- European mythology and folklore in many guises. In ascribing these attributes to the ubiquitous pine of his Courland home, Hoerner gives these motifs a specific Latvian reference. Androgyny, as a symbol of wholeness or completeness, is a divine attribute. That the ancient European pagans worshiped trees is well known. In this context, then, it is not without significance that Hoerner associates the great tree in his story with the divine, not only in and of itself, but also in the power of the sacred to unite men in spite of class differences. As Eglis and the old baron inspect the giant pine, we read: "Auch der Herr legt die Hand an den Stamm und schaut zur Krone hinauf. Und wie sie so dastehen... liegt in Blick und Haltung der beiden etwas Verbindendes, von Mensch zu Mensch ein Verstehen. Nicht wie von gleich zu gleich. Herr und Knecht, dabei bleibt es. Aber sie wissen beide, daß vor Gott alle Menschen gleich sind. Sie sind es auch vor diesem Baume" (S. 15-16). And a little later, when Eglis says he hopes the baron will not sell the tree, the old man answers that maybe the tree (note the anthropomorphic personification of the</page><page sequence="4">Aspects of Latvian Folklore 329 pine) wants to become a mast or an axle shaft in a mill to grind our daily bread. Then he adds, "Eglis, was weißt du von den Gedanken des Baumes? Was wissen wir von den Gedanken Gottes?" These juxtapositions of the tree and God are surely Hoemer's way of personifying and quasi-divinizing the tree. There is a good deal of lore about wood, of course - the oldest substance used by man and without which there would be no fire and no civilization. Homo Faber is above all a worker in wood. And wood is significant not only in regard to the sacred groves and trees our pagan ancestors worshiped, but also in the Judeo-Christian context. One thinks of the tree in the Garden of Eden, of the wooden ark Noah built, of the pyre Abraham assembled to sacrifice Isaac, of the thicket wherein a ram was caught which was to be a substitute for the human victim, of the acacia wood of the Ark of the Covenant, of the cedars of Lebanon Solomon used in building the temple, and, of course, of the wood of the cross. In this rich context it is easy to see the tree as a symbol of salvation, as holy wood, as it were, which must die so that Alexander may live. Here it would seem that Hoerner has skillfully blended Christian and pagan motifs - a blending quite suited to the Baltic context of his story, since this is the area, after all, whose people were the last Europeans to be baptized, the area, therefore, where pagan memories were perhaps fresher than in other parts of Europe. The mind of folklore is an animist mind. All nature is alive, every stream, every rock, and, as we saw, every tree is a spirit. This is true even of the wind in Hoerner's novella, which speaks directly to the tree. And in so doing it reveals itself in terms of the most basic and important of all the archetypes underlying the folkloric world: The archetype of death and rebirth. The wind says that it is as old as the world and that it will last as long as there is an earth to blow over. The tree will fall and not be able to get up again, but the wind has the power to die down and to rise up again: "Ich bin so alt wie die Welt. Ich were auch nicht vor ihr aufhören. Du stehst. Aber wenn du fällst, dann liegst du und kannst nicht wieder auf- stehen. Ich lege mich. Aber Ich erhebe mich wieder" (S. 54). And it is the warm south wind which brings the thaw in the spring and blows away the shroud of snow which has covered the earth. This, says the wind, is an annual recapitulation in miniature of the lifting of the heavy grave stone which once pressed down so heavily upon the earth - the glacier of the ice age which the sun melted away in a celebration of resurrection. The wind says to the ancient pine: Ich kann dich entwurzeln. Das ist die schwache Stelle. Es ist nicht Fels, auf dem du stehst, es ist Sand und Geröll und Lehm. Der Gletscher trug es her. Damalswar Eiszeit. Es ist auch heute wieder Eiszeit. Aber nur die kleine. Der Gletscher, ah, das war wohl ein Grabstein von einiger</page><page sequence="5">330 John Whiton Schwere. Die Sonne hat ihn weggewälzt. Da gab es ein Auferstehungs- feiern. Das wird noch alle Jahre wiederholt. Der Schnee ist nur ein leichtes Leichentuch. Morgen komme ich als Tauwind wieder und blase es fort. (S. 55) The circle, which has neither beginning nor end, is the perfect figure. And as such it symbolizes infinity / eternity / immortality, another key archetype which is expressed in numerous folk dances such as the round, where all hold hands and move about a middle such as a Maypole, or in the fast spinning and whirling of an individual dancer around his own axis. The latter motion and the endlessness which it symbolizes also characterizes the wind. "Ich drehe mich im Kreise," it says to the tree, "Darum bin ich unendlich" (S. 55). Earlier we saw that the forces of nature are paradoxically benevolent / malevolent, that the same wind which caused the menacing snow storm also felled the tree which gave Alexander shelter. This dual aspect of nature is the cause of much of man's ambivalence toward her, as expressed in numerous folk songs and tales. One is reminded of this when Hoerner emphasizes two aspects of the wind. It can howl and uproot even the tallest of trees, but at other times it can also waft gently through the boughs, "playing" the tree as one would a violin. The wind is also vital to the tree's reproduction process, since it spreads pollen and seeds. The wind addresses the tree in this regard as follows: Ich liebte dich. Du warst mir ein edles Instrument, darauf zu spielen. Heuteheule ich. Aber du weißt, daß ich auch säuseln kann. Wenn ich dir zart durch die Krone strich, war da nicht jedes Nadelpaar an dir eine schwingende Stimmgabel? ...Und wenn ich den Blütenstaub von dir forttrug, und nachher die geflügelte Saat, war das nicht wonnevoll? ... Ich bin der Bogen. Du bist die Saite. Beide zusammen machen erst die Musik. (S. 54-55) Everyone knows that according to folklore, the wood is inhabited by any number of spirits, by gnomes, elves, sprites, kobolds, ogres and fairies. There are many names and shapes and sizes for these mysterious figures. Sometimes they harm man and are to be feared. Sometimes they help him. Alexander encounters such a being of the benevolent kind in the form of an old gray man who holds out a stick for the boy to grasp as he crosses the moor and is in danger of breaking through the thin ice crust and falling in and getting stuck. Of course, in reality there is no such gray old man. What Alexander has done is to grab hold of a branch and pull himself up. But Hoerner narrates the episode from the subjective standpoint of a lost and frightened little boy, alone upon the moor on the proverbial dark and stormy</page><page sequence="6">Aspects of Latvian Folklore 33 1 night. Who would not see ghosts in such a situation? In giving this scene such folkloric overtones, Hoerner has heightened the poignancy of the boy's misadventure and given his story a deeper dimension. (The same could be said of the novella as a whole, of course.) The encounter with the gray old man and his helping stick is repeated a moment later when the dwarfed moor pines appear to Alexander as old men in long gray beards - a good description of elves. Earlier we said that the wood of the fallen tree was to be put to a specific use: to make cradles and coffins. And the boards were to be stored in the attic of the church. One encounters here, of course, another example of Hoerner's use of the death-rebirth archetype in writing about the great tree. When Laibe, the lumber dealer, asks Eglis, "Was will der Herr mit dem Baume machen?", the forester answers, "Der Herr hat bestimmt, daß aus diesem Baume Bretter gesägt werden." Laibe is shocked: "Aus einem solchen Stamm Bretter? Das ist eine Mühlenwelle, das ist ein Schiffsmast." "Bretter," Eglis repeats, "Und die Bretter sollen sorgsam getrocknet und gut aufgehoben werden. Damit sie nicht mit anderen Brettern verwechselt werden und ihre Bestimmung nicht mit der Zeit in Vergessenheit gerät, werden wir sie auf dem Dachboden der Kirche niederlegen.... Aus den Brettern sollen, sooft daran Bedarf ist, Wiegen und Särge gemacht werden. Nichts als Wiegen und Särge" (S. 62-63). Coffins and cradles are obvious symbols of death and (re)birth. And it should not be forgotten that churches are the place where the central mysteries of the Christian religion are celebrated - the death and resurrection of Christ, as well as baptisms and funerals. Was Hoerner thinking of any specific Latvian folksongs or folktales when he wrote Der große Baurríi This cannot be demonstrated. But it can be said that the spirit, if not the letter of Latvian folklore pervades Hoerner's tale. He was, of course, familiar with Latvian folk songs which he heard while growing up in old Courland. And he knew them as well in Herder's German translation. In his novel Der graue Reiter ( 1 940) there is specific reference to old Latvian folktales as narrated by grandmothers at the hearth. When we add to this folkloric aspect the fact that Hoerner uses Latvian loan words in Der große Baum (and not just here, of course) such as Pastel for shoe, Rogge for sleigh or sled, Kleete and Riege for shed, a fascinating inference can be made that has socio-cultural and historical significance. Hoerner was a "Baltic baron," a member of that small but dominant German aristocracy that ruled in Latvia and Estonia for 700 years and did not assimilate with their non-German subjects, thus jealously preserving their German identity. Or did some of them assimilate in subtle ways never- theless? It could be argued that Hoerner did so in spite of himself, that his love for nature in his homeland predisposed him to see it through the eyes</page><page sequence="7">332 John Whiton of its people, that is, of its ancient and indigenous inhabitants, to see it through quasi-Latvian eyes, as it were, and in so doing to spin a yarn redolent of Latvian folk culture. It could be argued that Der große Baum, Latvian in content , but German in form (i.e., language) represents a symbiosis of the two cultures which had taken place at deeper levels of their psyche than the Baltic Germans (if Hoerner may be taken as their representative) perhaps realized.</page></plain_text>
