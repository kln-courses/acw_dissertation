<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1963-64 Excavations have again been numerous, though, reflecting rising costs of land and labour, many were on a modest scale. The outstanding event of the year was the discovery of an intact treasure of Minoan ritual vessels in the newly-discovered palace at Kato Zakro. Important finds have again been made accidentally throughout the country as a result of building and other works, notably in the Kadmeia at Thebes. Only a small portion of such chance discoveries can be noticed in this short report; for the rest the reader is referred to the voluminous bulletins (Chr) in the 'APXatoloyLKdv AdErtov (ADelt). To C. Karouzos, the Director of the Publications Office of the Greek Archaeological Service which issues this journal, and to the Epimeletria, Mrs A. Kaloyero- poulou, I am again indebted for the loan of photo- graphs and for making forthcoming reports available. Other photographs have been kindly lent by the Secretary of the Archaeological Society, A. Orlandos, whose report on the excavations financed by the Society in 1963 (here indicated by the letters A.S. after the name of the excavator) has already appeared. Indispensable contributions and photographs have also been made concerning their work in the past year by those who excavated under sponsorship of the British School, at Ayios Stephanos (see under Laconia), Nea Nikomedeia (Macedonia) and in Kythera (other Aegean Islands). Other field-work sponsored by the School is reported under Perachora (Corinthia), Pantanassa (Epirus), Macedonia, Herak- leion Museum and Palaikastro (Crete). To the Directors of the other foreign schools I am again indebted for the accounts of their excavations which they have communicated. To them and to all others named in this report, who directly or indirectly have contributed, my thanks are due, and my apologies for any errors that may have crept in during the process of condensation. ATHENS AND ATTICA National Museum. In the epigraphic collection M. Mitsos has completed the important task of re-assembling and exhibiting the fragments of the Athenian ephebe lists, comprising substantial parts cf some fifty stelai. Recent acquisitions of the numismatic collection include two lots of Greek silver coins from Western Asia Minor, among them some rarities. These may come from the same find in the area of Kolophon as those published by C. Kraay in Rev. Suisse de Numis- matique xlii, 5ff. Mrs Varoucha-Christodoulopoulou is publishing these and other acquisitions in ADelt 18 Chr. Acropolis Area. In the sanctuary of Dionysus, a programme of cleaning and systematisation is well advanced. It includes the extension of the site by acquisition and demolition of houses on the east side. A progress report by P. Kalligas, who has been in charge, is in the press (ADelt 18 Chr). Similar improvements, and archaeologically no less rewarding have been carried out under the direction of N. Platon in the Asklepieion. One result will be the restitution of the route which Pausanias followed from the sanctuary of Dionysus to the Propylaea. Kerameikos. A small excavation of the German Institute to the west of the Dipylon, which was directed by G. Gruben, disclosed in situ a fourth-century boundary-stone with the inscription: OPOL TEA- MA TOZ AOHNAAZ. Work was resumed in the cemetery at two points. K. Vierneisel examined an area south of the Sacred Way, between the Antidosis precinct and Piraeus Street. His -purpose was to ascertain the date of the tomb-monument with a stone fagade that stands there, by the study of assoc- iated remains. Many rectangular structures of mud-brick faced with brick were found. One on the east side was datable to the decade 460-50, and Early Corinthian material was associated with one of three to the west. Nearby were found a loutro- phoros (Fig. x) and six other vases of the KX Painter. The mound east of the road junction, excavated by F. Willemsen and U. Knigge, proved not to be a single tumulus, but an accumulation resulting from succes- sive burials. The earliest was in a rough stone structure akin to the EH graves of Ayios Kosmas but without grave goods. There followed two Archaic shaft-graves, neither of them intact. A group of offerings above the Pythagoras Stele, but near no grave, included eleven 'Samian' lekythoi. On the growing mound more burials were made in the first half of the fifth-century, with poor black-figure lekythoi and a few red-figure vases, including an alabastron with two figure groups signed by a new potter, Atitas. Finally the mound received further burials in the Hellenistic period. City Wall. A section of the proteichisma and of the ditch, 4 m. deep and some 8 m. wide, was exposed on a building site at the junction of Th. Negri Street with Syngrou Avenue (ADelt 18 Chr). The line of the wall has thus been clarified at a point which must have been close to the Itonian Gate. At its east end, the section of proteichisma exposed bends northward, to follow the right bank of the Ilissos. In the ditch was found a kore head of the severe style (Fig. 2). Piraeus Street. The excavation of a deep trench for a new sewer between Plateia Eleftherias and the vegetable market, brought to light numerous tombs of the Dipylon cemetery. A few of the Geometric period were found in the section fronting the former Hatzikosta Orphanage, where among vases which had evidently served as grave-markers was a large crater with a funeral procession in two zones. Other finds include a wide-mouthed Geometric jug with a frieze of running goats on the shoulder (Fig. 3), a Proto- attic amphora with sphinxes and some black-figure vases (ADelt 17 Chr pls. 22-26).</page><page sequence="2">4 A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. I Acharnae Gate. A similar operation in Aeolus Street between the junction with Stadium and Sophocles streets, brought to light a number of fifth- and fourth-century graves of the cemetery out- side this gate in the Themistoclean wall. Numerous red-figure vases were recovered including three cylindrical pyxides. A later and poorer section of the cemetery was excavated nearby prior to the erection of the new Lambropoulos Brothers' building in Lycurgus Street. The one earlier burial in this area was a cremation in a Protogeometric hydria (ADelt I8 Chr). Ilissos. A cremation burial and a richly furnished pit-grave of the Geometric period came to light at the junction of Diakos and Anapavsis streets, south of the Olympieion, where, in the area of the later Diomeian Gate, these are not the first indications of an early cemetery. Two pyxides with horse-groups on the lid, a trefoil-mouth jug with a procession of goats, goatherd and dog, and a gold arm-band were among the contents of the grave (ADelt 18 Chr). Plato's Academy. Between the Sacred House and Kratylos Street, F. Stavropoulos (A.S.) has excavated remains of sacrifices dating from the Geometric period, in what had been an open area. Further chance finds have been made in the neighbourhood. In the Veneta earth-pit, marbles found in the Early Christian lining of a well included fragments of an inscribed fourth-century grave relief. More spectac- ular was the discovery in the Mavriki earth-pit of a marble sarcophagus, complete with its gabled lid, carved in the high relief style of the third century A.D. On the front are two griffins in the loops of heavy garlands carried by three erotes, on the back a lion-hunt beneath a vine-entangled tree and on the ends Bellerophon with Pegasus and a mounted horse- man attacking a boar. Other finds from this pro- perty include a cylindrical marble altar of Hadrianic style inscribed 'O)vp~aoddpog CtEtpEV; and an archaistic relief in two registers of Hermes and the Nymphs. Kallithea. The Geometric tombs, and one with Protocorinthian vases, discovered in 196o have been published by Mrs D. Callipolitis-Feytmans in BCH 87, 404 if- FIG. 2</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 5 Ayios Joannis Rentis. At the junction of Ayia Anna and P. Rallis streets a H-shaped tomb-enclosure, which came to light accidentally, was found to con- tain a number of fourth-century burials, seven of them in marble sarcophagi, and two marble lekythoi. With the burials was a number of alabaster vases. Other finds included red-figure fragments of the first years of the fourth century and a black-glaze lamp of the first half of this century containing thirteen silver coins of Athens. Some of these are of types assigned to the third century by Svoronos (Tre'sor des monnaies d'Athines pl. 21, nos. 43, 53, 58 and 59), which this and other finds may justify re-dating in the fourth (ADelt 18 Chr)., Piraeus. The head and upper part of the body of an over-lifesize marble statue of Hadrian have come to light during foundation excavations on Andreas Miaoulis quay (Kathimerini 15.8. 1963). This area was probably shallow water in antiquity and lies some 400oo m. southwest of the spot where the find of bronze statues was made in 1959. According to a recent study by Miss A. Benjamin (Hesperia 32 (1963) 57 ff.), the cult of Hadrian is attested by 94 altars in Athens alone. Salamis. The excavation of an intact Late Helladic IIIB.2 chamber tomb at 'Limnionas' between Ambelakia and Silenia, which yielded stirrup-jars, squat alabastra and other characteristic vases, is briefly reported by Miss A. Andriomenou (ADelt 17 Chr 39). Apart from three interments, there were vessels containing burnt bones and ashes. Eleusis. I. Travlos (A.S.) resumed the excavation of the buildings of the Roman period grouped round an elongated court to the west of the Great Propylaea. Occupying the narrow east end is a small temple with an altar in the courtyard before it, which supports the identification of the whole complex as accommodation for the priests. In one of the rooms was found a small bronze disk with a representation of syncretic type identified as Isis-Demeter surrounded by astrological and other symbols and assigned to the third century A.D. Vari. Following the purchase of an area of the new cemetery (Arch. Reports for 1962-63 8), about 8oo m. from that which produced the splendid Protoattic vases in the National Museum, B. Kalli- politis has started its systematic excavation. From a series of pyre-trenches some useful isolated groups of vases of the seventh and sixth centuries were recovered. One of Middle Protoattic date contained, in addition to a Phaleron-type oinochoe, a fragmentary pottery gaming-table with figurines of weeping women standing at the four corners, the earliest known of its type (ADelt 18 I15 iTff.). Thorikos. H. Mussche, leading the Belgian com- ponent of a new Greek-Belgian expedition, has carried out a preliminary campaign centred on the buildings previously exposed. Perati (Porto Rafti). S. Iakovides (A.S.) has completed his investigation of the LH IIIC cemetery with the excavation of fourteen more intact chamber tombs, four of them containing remains of cremations. Notable among the vases are a stirrup-jar from tomb I IM ......... FIG. 3 155 with a highly formalized octopus and a pyxis from tomb 149 with alternating designs arranged in panels. Small finds include an Egyptian scarab and an ivory spindle with incised decoration. CORINTHIA AND ARGOLIS Perachora. In the L-shaped Stoa the debris accumulated since the original British School ex- cavation was cleared, by A. Megaw and J. Coulton, in connection with the account of the building to be published by the latter in BSA 59. Tests below the floor on either side of the west wall revealed a well- defined but narrow foundation trench, where the latest identifiable object found was a fourth-century skyphos base. The position of the missing south end wall was established and it was found to have rested on remains of an earlier wall of different orientation. Kenchreae. Under the auspices of the American *</page><page sequence="4">6 A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. 4 School preliminary investigations were carried out at four points round the harbour, with support from Chicago and Indiana Universities, by R. Scranton and E. Ramage. A survey was made of the con- siderable remains of the south quay and of buildings on it surviving under water; and a massive foundation suggestive of a temple was identified in deep water at its extremity, from which a mole projects. The buildings on the quay appear to be blocks of ware- houses, Hellenistic but more than once rebuilt, divided by narrow alleys. Where the present fore- shore was excavated sections of the warehouse walls FIG. 5 FIG. 6</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 7 were seen to have been rebuilt in the second century A.D. Considerable remains of a basilican church, partly overlying the warehouses, were also revealed. It appears to have had five aisles, an annexe to the south and others west of the narthex, one of which preserves part of its mosaic floor. The style of the mullion capitals and other marble furnishings found suggest to the excavators a date as early as the fourth century. At the other end of the harbour the east mole and other remains are visible in the water, and excavations on land revealed part of a substantial building of brick construction (Fig. 4). This appears to be have been built in the second century A.D., subsequently altered, and finally destroyed in the sixth. The floors are of mosaic or white marble tesserae without pattern, carried on thick concrete, which with the conduits beneath them and the lead piping found among debris are suggestive of baths. On the harbour side of this building below concrete founda- tions are others of brown poros blocks tentatively assigned to the Hellenistic period. In the central area of the harbour another stretch of quay was identified and behind it remains of commercial buildings, Roman and later. Floors close to the shore and cellar floors at a distance from it, now at sea level, together with the extensive foundations surviving in the sea itself indicate a general subsidence since antiquity of from six to ten feet.' Investigations further inland located, some 8oo m. north of the harbour, foundations and fragments of marble from a temple of the classical period, perhaps the sanctuary of Artemis on the road from Isthmia mentioned by Pausanias. Corinth. The 1963 excavations of the American School, under the direction of H. Robinson, opened a new area to the south of the South Stoa. Between the remains of a substantial Turkish house and the South Stoa, Byzantine houses of the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries were discovered. One of these yielded numerous fragments of Near Eastern glazed pottery, which has been of rare occurrence in previous seasons. From this same area comes a marble portrait head of the Empress Faustina the Younger, and a fragment of a late fourth-century marble relief (Fig. 5) representing Herakles with a dog, apparently not Cerberus. In a second area, west of the museum, the north- west corner of a double portico enclosing the peri- bolos of temple E has been found and, opening from it, a building comprising a small peristyle court and an inner room, constructed after the filling of the ancient quarry in this area in the early first century A.D. West of this annexe of the sanctuary was found a section of what may well have been one of the principal routes through the city towards Acro- corinth in the Roman period. At Anaploga the area of the great cistern exposed in 1962 was further investigated. Here a tunnelled conduit, which evidently tapped a spring at the foot of Acrocorinth, was entered and followed for over 6oo m., at one point as much as 20 m. below the surface. Constructed probably in the fourth century B.c., it served two cisterns and a well en route to an irrigation area to the northwest; most of the vertical shafts used in its construction were closed on its completion. In one of the cisterns, which went out of use with the sack of Mummius, architectural members of poros from Doric and Ionic buildings were found as well as some good terracotta figurines. In the same area a well-shaft filled at the end of the early Geometric period yielded much fragmentary coarse ware together with a number of black-glazed and decorated vessels. At Kokkinovrysi, to the northwest of the city, further investigation of the area of the roadside stela indicates that the terracotta figurines found adjacent to the stela in 1962, were discarded offerings of various dates from a near-by sanctuary. Large quantities of seventh- and sixth-century Corinthian pottery found in an adjacent stream-bed probably come from the same source. It is probable that this lay to the south of the road and that the stela marked its boundary. Some 400 fragments of the Penteskouphi plaques excavated by Washburn in 1905 have been redis- covered in the store-rooms of the Corinth Museum. Study of these and the more numerous fragments in West Berlin by Helen von Raits has produced a considerable number of certain joins between the two series. A man-hole discovered by chance near the Turkish fountain-house of Hadji Mustafa proved to give access to a very elaborate cistern of the Hellenistic period whose tunnel-chambers intersect at right angles. C. Williams began study and conservation work in the Roman Northwest Shops, just below the Archaic Temple. The shops must now be dated in the early third century after Christ and were apparently contemporary with the construction of the Captives' Facade in front of the Lechaion Road Basilica. Mycenae. Acropolis. Adjoining the north wall of the Acropolis, towards its west end, G. Mylonas (A.S.) re-excavated an area previously examined by Tsountas and refilled. In 1962 a corridor had been exposed, passing along the wall and serving a series of small store-rooms on the inner side. Beyond these was uncovered a long building (named building M) subdivided into four intercommunicating rooms. Plentiful LH IIIB sherds were obtained from undug areas within the building and in the corridors by which it was approached, associated in the former case with paste beads, fragmentary figurines and a faience plaque with the cartouche of Amenophis III. In an open area reached by a stair from one of the rooms, was found a minute female figurine of ivory with the hands supporting the breasts. To the southwest of the main building, across a corridor, a row of store-rooms was found. To the east, a broad staircase of dressed poros in one of the corridors led 1 Changes in the level of the sea in the Mediterranean since prehistoric times were one of the topics discussed at an inter- national spelaeological congress convened in Athens in August 1963.</page><page sequence="6">8 A. H. S. MEGAW to rooms over the stores between building M and the acropolis wall, and thence possibly to the upper floor of the former. The whole of this important complex has not yet been uncovered. Re-examination by Mylonas of the scant remains on the summit of the acropolis suggested the presence here of a series of rooms, rather than a 'columnar hall'. Under the existing floor of the 'room of the pithos' he found remains of a burnt pavement indicating a LH IIIB fire prior to the final destruc- tion. Mylonas also exposed on the north slope the Archaic retaining wall of the temple terrace and identified inside the cella wall of the Hellenistic temple some remains of its Archaic predecessor. Mycenae. The Lower City. North of the Treasury of Atreus and adjoining the modern road, Mylonas has now excavated remains of three houses. In the most substantial, that to the west, thirteen basement rooms have been wholly or partly excavated. They have yielded plentiful LH IIIB pottery. Under the northernmost, earlier (LH II) structures were found. Some Protogeometric graves in the area were also excavated. N. Verdelis (A.S.) resumed examination of the new Mycenaean house identified in 1962 some 20 m. east of the House of Sphinxes. The limited scope of this excavation left its layout in doubt, but interesting remains of an underlying Middle Helladic building of Megaron form came to light. Verdelis also estab- lished that the wide street found in 1962 in front of the House of the Oil Merchant continues further north at almost the same width, suggesting that it was one of the main thoroughfares in the lower city. Medea. In association with Verdelis, P. Astr6m of the Swedish Institute, carried out exploratory excavations on the acropolis, in the summer of 1963. Tiryns. An account by Verdelis of the two covered passages leading down to extra-mural springs, which were discovered in 1962, is to appear in ADelt 18 Chr. Preliminary study of the pottery indicates that the passages were intentionally filled in the Hellenistic period, but in the main with material taken from LH IIIB and IIIC levels within the acropolis. The presence of both Close Style and Granary Style fragments confirms the reoccupation of the citadel after the thirteenth-century destruction. New documents concerning Tiryns in the Early Archaic period have come to light in the shape of boustrophedon inscriptions cut, around 600 B.C., on the exposed upper surfaces of some of the cover- stones of the passages. Argos. Six Geometric cist-graves have been ex- cavated by Miss O. Alexandri in a building-site at xo King George II street. The contents included a good range of vases, iron swords, bronze fibulae and pins. South of the ancient theatre, in a site in Tripolis street, forty-three graves were excavated, six of them sub-Mycenaean and poorly furnished and the remainder Classical and Hellenistic. Three of these dating from the late fifth century produced mainly Corinthian pottery and some Argive figurines of good quality (ADelt 18 Chr). Epidaurus. N. Yialouris has undertaken the assem- bly of fragments of the pediment sculptures of the temples of Asklepios and Artemis, previously dis- tributed between the local and National Museums. Many joins have been made (Fig. 6) permitting more accurate reconstruction of the compositions (ADelt 19 Chr). ARCADIA TO ACHAIA Mantinea. Trial excavations have been made by Miss Th. Karageorgha on Gortsouli hill, about I km. from the city walls, where Ptolis, the predecessor of the Classical Mantinea is sometimes placed. On the summit plentiful Geometric sherds were found at a depth of 2 m. and on the west slope remains of a humble sanctuary were located. A simple rectangular cella-foundation encloses another of earlier date with plentiful associated votive terracotta figurines, mainly Archaic, bronze pins, miniature vases, lead disks and other small finds ranging from Geometric to Hellen- istic (ADelt 18 Chr). Sparta. C. Christou (A.S.), searching for remains of the sanctuaries of Pasipha? and Ares Theritas in the direction of Chrysapha, located at 'Ktirakia' a rectangular building of the classical period in heavy construction akin to the so-called tomb of Leonidas. On one of the long sides (southwest) was a portico, to which a fragment of a Doric capital of local marble may belong. An apsidal addition to the opposite side is assigned to a Byzantine conversion, following an earlier conversion into a family tomb in late Roman times, when the interior walls were lined with brick. In a deep pit within the apse a large cache of small marble fragments of relief sculpture was found, which the excavator assigns to a frieze of the Flavian period of Dionysiac character, since the heads of maenads and fragments of erotes cutting bunches of grapes are included. Christou has been notably successful in locating, re-excavating and transferring to the museum sec- tions of mosaic floor which had come to light in the past in and around the town and had been covered again. The earliest of these is of Hellenistic date and was found in 1915 at Magoula (ADelt 4, 171). It has a central panel with a lively Triton surrounded by an inner border of sea monsters and an outer one with athletes and horsemen. Sections of two floors of the Roman period have also been raised. That showing 'Sappho Crowned' found fifty years ago proved to be part of a large floor, measuring some I I X 15 m., with remains of a central scene of the Muses, where the heads and names of Calliope and Urania have survived. The border round it was divided into squares with busts, of which the best preserved is that of Sappho (Fig. 7), and where Alcibiades, Alcman and Anacreon are identifiable from their inscriptions. Two subsidiary scenes of the chase are flanked by personifications of the Sun and Moon (missing), Night and Day, of which Helios is the best preserved. A Medusa head was the centre-piece of a mosaic re-excavated in Nikon Street, where in an adjoining unit of the same building were found scant remains of a scene probably representing the sur- render of Briseis to Agamemnon, to judge by the</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 9 FIG. 7 three preserved heads and their inscriptions BPIZHI2E, [TAAOY]BIOZ and [HATPO]KAOZ. Save for a panel with two panthers confronting across a cantharus, geometrical motifs complete these floors (ADelt 19 Chr). Trials by Miss Th. Karageorgha in the 0. Para- skevopoulos property south of the acropolis revealed well-constructed Roman walls and, in a pithos, a store of some 200 lamps. These are of Corinthian fabric and of types current in the first half of the third century (ADelt 19 Chr). Ayios Stephanos. The excavations sponsored by the British School at this site on the edge of the Helos plain were resumed by Lord William Taylour. In the central area (A) of the flat-topped hill, among disrupted house remains, further burials were found ranging from EH to LH, many of them close below the surface, which is here much eroded. Notable FIG. 8 was an MH cist grave of a woman who wore thin elliptical earrings of bronze, a bronze finger-ring with an oval bezel, a necklace of cornelian beads and a bronze dress-pin of exceptional size, which can be matched among the finds from grave circle B at Mycenae (Fig. 8). On her chest was a shallow bi-conical bowl of coarse fabric decorated with incised designs. The grave also contained several other complete vases, including a goblet of local Minyan ware. In another MH grave, which con- tained two burials, were two cups, one of very fine ware, and a miniature bowl, probably a lamp. The single Mycenaean burial contained the remains of a bronze dagger, a pair of bronze tweezers and a bone toggle-pin but no pottery. In the same cist grave were found the remains of an earlier burial FIG. 9 associated with a hoard of thirty-five obsidian blades, a flint scraper and a bone pin. Towards the northern edge of the hill (area A), where some Mycenaean burials had previously been found (Arch. Reports for 1960-6I, 32), further graves were excavated (all but one of them without grave goods), in one of which the bone positions suggested that the feet had been tied, and the hands also, behind the back. On the south edge of the hill-top (area B) where the soil is deeper, intensive occupation in the LH IIIB period was attested by three super- imposed floors associated with walls of three distinct building phases. In one floor, from which fragments of a restorable crater were collected (Fig. 9), a pit was found containing four skulls. A deep sounding below the lowest floors in one sector indicated that undisturbed MH remains may here be found since only MH and earlier sherds were encountered. In this area also there were numerous burials, many of them children. With one was a complete Mycenaean figurine of the IIIB period and with another a quantity of paste beads (Fig. zo).</page><page sequence="8">i0 A. H. S. MEGAW FIG. 10 In a trial trench on the east slope, what seems to be the foundation of a fortification wall was found; it is 3'5 m. wide and formed of small stones laid on the rock. Numerous LH IIIB deep bowl fragments were found against its inner face, indicating that the settlement was fortified in the thirteenth century, though possibly not for the first time. In the same trench, but a few metres higher up the slope, possible remains of another, but much smaller defensive wall were found. Messene. (Mavromati). A. Orlandos (A.S.) has continued the excavation of the buildings surrounding the Hellenistic Agora. Next to that on the west side identified as a temple of Artemis, three more have been excavated forming part of the same architectural scheme, but less well preserved. In each the bases which carried statues or sculptural groups were in situ, but of the statuary only small fragments were found. Nor do the inscriptions (one of them hon- ouring a wrestler Antisthenes son of Polystrates, an Olympic victor) disclose the precise function of the individual units. One is of the same tripartite plan as the temple, but with the lateral compartments closed with walls not colonnades. Each is entered, like the temple, through a trivelon divided by piers with engaged half-columns inside and out. In the southernmost, apart from the panels closing the lateral openings, the space within the central one was enclosed by a barrier which prevented close access to the semicircular plinth on which the statuary or other exhibits were displayed. Sapienza. A team from the Greek under-water organisation, in association with P. Throckmorton on behalf of the Pennsylvania University Museum, has located and surveyed a cargo of red granite columns sunk in 8 fathoms off the north point of the island. An account of this wreck has appeared in Expedition 5 (1963) no. 2. A few hundred metres to the north, a group of three stone sarcophagi and their lids was found on the sea-bed at the same depth. Their simple ornamentation of swags, bucrania and ros- ettes date this second wreck to the third century A.D., which is confirmed by some amphora fragments and a small glass bottle collected among the ballast (ADelt I8 Chr). Pylos. Palace of Nestor. Continuing his part of the joint exploration of Western Messenia, in which he is associated with Sp. Marinatos, C. W. Blegen resumed investigation of areas contiguous to the Myc. IIIB palace at Englianos, already uncovered to its full extent (for plan see Arch. Reports for 1958 8, fig. 7). Along the northwestern scarp some evidence of the stratification of the accumulated debris on the hill was secured, some stubs of stone walls were exposed, and an I m. length of a substantial one, I m. thick was brought to light, built along the edge of the hill below the Wine Magazine. Further southwest were found segments of several walls and a vast amount of discarded pottery from alternating black and yellowish strata. Coarse and fine wares were represented, all Mycenaean, as well as bits of bronze, obsidian, flint and ivory, and several terracotta whorls. On the southern periphery of the Palace further trenching confirmed the results previously obtained in the southeast sector: stereo at no great depth and pockets filled with structural debris cleared from the central area in preparation for the erection of the Myc. IIIB palace. G. Papathanasopoulos resumed his investigation of the deep habitation deposit that lies just outside the northwestern exterior wall of the palace. A good many pieces of fine early Mycenaean pottery (LH I) were found, and the history of the early occupation of the hill was clarified. The task of cleaning the floor of the portico of the palace was completed. The division into squares and many of the decorative motifs have now been re- covered. The central section of the floor of the vestibule was also cleaned; but very little of its decoration has survived. An underlying earlier floor was divided by double incised lines into rec- tangles containing faint vestiges of linear patterns. Good headway was made with the study of the finds from twelve years of excavation, a task which it is hoped to complete in 1964. The great quantity of household pottery recovered offered an unique opportunity for analysis. The capacities of 788 vases were measured for comparison with the units of analogous measurements recorded in the Linear B tablets from the palace. Miss M. Lang continued</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE II her work on the frescoes, establishing new com- positions and correcting some earlier interpretations (the pink griffins from Hall 64 have been trans- formed into dogs). More of them have been recorded in restored watercolour drawings, including the Blue Birds (Fig. Ii). Koukounara. Sp. Marinatos (A.S.) excavated the second of the two tholos tombs previously discovered at 'Akona' (Arch. Reports for 1959-60 12). Like the first, it had been repeatedly used and the deposit on the floor contained two thick layers of ashes. Several of the skulls found were on the surface of the deposit, FIG. II where a stag's antler and half its skeleton were also found. Associated pottery relates the latter to re-use of the tomb in the late Geometric period. In a rectangular pit in the floor of the tomb, which had been robbed, was found a lentoid seal of green chalcedony carved with a youth leaping to mount a wild goat. The fragmentary pottery assigns the original use of the tomb to LH IIIB. Further sifting of the earth in the main tomb at 'Gouvalari' recovered an even finer, probably LM I, seal-stone of white chalcedony with two wild goats, also a few more fragments to join the vases from this tomb now restored in the Pylos Museum. These include two craters with strange swan-like birds which match, for the first time in Greece, the kindred representations on Cypro-Mycenaean vases. Tragana. The central part of the Hellenistic tumulus at 'Tsopani Rachi' is occupied by the house of the finder of the mosaic glass bowl and other objects mentioned in the 1962-63 report, but G. Papathanasopoulos has been able to excavate its northeast sector. Here a group of three intact built graves was found, containing multiple burials, numerous vases and silver coins. These date the tumulus to late third or early second century (ADelt 18 Chr). Olympia. In the German Institute's winter cam- paign E. Kunze and A. Mallwitz resumed the ex- cavation of the area to the southeast of the Altis. The function of the Octagon complex was revealed by the discovery of hypocausts and other features of a Roman bathing establishment. Its south rooms were des- troyed by the encroachment of the Alpheus in medie- val times. It was confirmed that further search in this direction for remains of the hippodrome would be fruitless, since the river has carried away everything down to, and below, the lowest Greek level. South- west of the Octagon the massive Greek foundation to the north of the classical altar of Artemis, now fully exposed, is datable to the first half of the fourth century. Between the Octagon and the Stadium also, removal of the deep deposit of alluvium has revealed some remains of the Roman and earlier buildings which the river has spared. In this Octagon area, some fifty wells have now been found and of these twenty-five have so far been exca- vated. Like those in the Stadium area, they have produced a great wealth of important finds of the Archaic and Classical periods, particularly bronzes. The arms and armour include twenty helmets of all types, a greave on which the knee is decorated with an embossed lion-skin and another with seventh-century palmette- ornament. Notable among many attachments from tripods and other vessels are two exceptionally large helmed warriors, and an earlyArchaic ram's head (Fig. I2). The numerous vessels include a Phoenician bowl with two animal friezes (akin to Olympia iv, pl. 52. 884). The statu- ettes found include the upper part of an Archaic bearded Libyan, probably from a Busiris group; a superb dancing silen, in many respects close to that from Dodona; and a Zeus of the severe style hurling a thunder-bolt. A curious find from a fourth-century fill was a joining fragment of the drapery of Cladeus in the east pediment of the Temple of Zeus. FIG. 12 The range of pottery is from the eighth century to Roman times, including Attic and Laconian frag- ments of the best quality: from a band-cup of the time of Lydos, from a large severe-style volute-krater and from a column-krater by the Pan Painter. Among vases of local fabric is a late classical red- figure calyx-krater with a boy (Apollo?) and girl</page><page sequence="10">12 A. H. S. MEGAW seated and playing the 'how many fingers?' game before two laurel trees (Fig. 13). Further exploration by N. Yialouris of the new museum site has revealed remains of prehistoric house-walls, a paved hearth(?) and plentiful EH and MH pottery of fine quality. Some important bronzes and other Archaic and Classical material were recovered from the upper levels and from what, in antiquity, had evidently been a water-course where surplus votives from the Altis had been dumped. They include helmets, greaves, shield-handle frag- ments (one embossed with a lion attacking a bull, side: the innermost and earliest (early fourth century B.C.) of light construction; the second with both internal and external buttresses, contemporary with the second parodos wall; and the third built of re- used materials. Against the earliest west parodos wall the 23 degree slope of the original auditorium was exposed and on it some foundation blocks for the later seating. In this area five Submycenaean- Protogeometric graves were found. They contained one or two vases each, and one of them a bronze horned sword with well-preserved hilt-facings of bone. On the east side of the theatre, the one FIG. 13 another with a horseman, rosette and part of a chariot: Fig. 14), a griffin's head and part of an Assyrian crater-stand embossed with demons and sacred trees (ADelt i9 Chr). In the neighbourhood of Olympia, at the locality 'Rhenia', near Platanos, Yialouris has excavated a chamber-tomb which though looted yielded a good group of restorable vases of Myc. IIIC types. On the right bank of the Kladeus, about 2 km. north of the village which has taken its name (formerly Stravokephalo), six more chamber-tombs were dug producing plentiful late Mycenaean pottery (ADelt 19 Chr). Elis. N. Yialouris (A.S.) in collaboration with Miss V. Leon of the Austrian Archaeological Institute continued the excavation of the theatre. Three successive retaining walls were identified on the west retaining wall which has been exposed corresponds with that of the second phase on the west. Much of the orchestra was also excavated and in the scene building clearance and reconstruction of the re- mains previously excavated were undertaken. An account of the Middle Palaeolithic industries identified in the regions of Killini, Amalia and Katakolon by the French expedition led by A. Leroi- Gourhan is published in BCH 88 (1964). Araxos. E. Mastrokostas (A.S.) resumed his in- vestigation of the prehistoric fortification identifiable as the Teichos of the Dymaeans. The altar by the main gate, where the names of the deities revered were later inscribed, proved to be a construction of the Geometric period resting on a burnt layer with pottery attesting the origin of the cult in Mycenaean times. The deposits associated with the altar itself</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 13 range from Archaic to Hellenistic. On the ramparts, structures of both Mycenaean and later date were excavated, the former producing restorable Myc. III vases. CENTRAL GREECE AND EUBOEA Thebes. Discoveries on a building site in the centre of the Kadmeia, on the northwest corner of the inter- section of Pindar and Antigone Streets, led to an extensive excavation under the direction of N. Platon by Mrs E. Stassinopoulou-Touloupa. Remains of buildings were found aligning with the Mycenaean palace excavated by Keramopoullos a little to the north (for plan see AE 1930, 31 fig. I) and like it overlying earlier structures going back to the Early Helladic period. On the assumption that these buildings are contemporary with the palace (des- troyed in LH IIIA. 2) special interest attaches to a later Mycenaean structure on a different, north- south, alignment in the southwest corner of the site. Its walls, of masonry below and mud-brick above, are I.20 m. thick and extend outside the excavated area to south and west. Here were found 35 cylinder- seals, a few of Mycenaean types (e.g. griffin, 'Potnia Theron') and the others Near Eastern. Two of the latter, of which photographs have been published in the press, are of Middle Assyrian type, though the inscriptions appear to be Kassite. With these engraved cylinders, which had evidently been kept in a box, were several blanks. Other finds include gold jewellery, agate beads and remains of the fresco decoration of this building, which first reports assign to the LH IIIB period. Later structures, of which remains were found on the same site, include a substantial building of the fourth century B.C., possibly of public character, and a massive medieval structure, including a bath with hypocaust, which extends to the area excavated by Keramopoullos. Excavations on a second site at the northeast corner of the same street intersection disclosed further remains of Mycenaean date, including a section of courtyard or road paved with cobbles in three successive layers. Further to the southeast, in Pelopidas Street, several tombs of a prehistoric cemetery (late EH to early MH) have been excavated beneath remains of Mycenaean buildings, from which some bronze vessels found in the tombs had evidently intruded. The overlying structures yielded several clay tablets with short Linear B inscriptions, a number of bronze weapons and a pair of ivory colonettes, probably from a piece of furniture (Kathimerini 19.4-1964). A first preliminary account of these important discoveries is to be published in Kadmos. Sanctuary of Ptoios. J. Ducat and C. Llinas cleaned the remains previously excavated by the French School and carried out supplementary soundings. Tiles and pottery from the temple on the upper terrace justify a return to the fourth-century dating of the building originally proposed. A sounding adjoining the buildings on the lower terrace struck a deposit containing some bronzes as well as abundant pottery, evidently thrown here in antiquity. Many sherds bear dedications 'to the hero Ptoios'. More of these were found in a 'West Building' newly discovered. Eretria. B. Petrakos has identified a few more fragments from the pediment of the archaic temple of Apollo, including a horse's hoof (ADelt 17 Chr I44 f.).

MEGAW (ADelt 17 Chr 144 ff.). He includes a reconstruction of the lately discovered tholos. New finds of funerary inscriptions from the gully to the west of the site have located a cemetery area outside the wall. The identification of the supposed Thesmophorion on the acropolis has received support from the discovery nearby of a marble bench with the fourth-century inscription HFEMONH AlIMHTPI on the front edge (ADelt 18 Chr). Inaugurating joint Greek-Swiss excavations at Eretria, K. Schefold's initial campaign (spring 1964) was in the main directed to a survey of visible remains. Medeon. Prior to the construction of a plant for the treatment of bauxite to the east of this walled acropolis on the Gulf of Antikyra, the area was partially exca- vated by the French School and the Archaeological Service conjointly. The ruins in this area, first reported by Leake, proved to overlie habitation remains of the Roman period and to contain the shell of an eleventh-century church. This was of the type in which a large dome is carried on squinches and it stood over a crypt. Much of the contemporary marble iconostasis was recovered. The church was later converted into a cruciform tower by rectangular additions on all four sides. On the route of the approach road to the new installations, which passes close to the acropolis wall, numerous tombs were also excavated. Their contents are now in the Delphi Museum. These range in date from the Mycenaean period to the fourth century B.c. MH occupation is also attested and within the walls a tholos tomb is reported (BCH 87, 839 f.). Mariolata. In this village near Gravia, below the walled acropolis of Boion, remains of a three-aisled Christian basilica and of its mosaic floor have been excavated by P. Lazarides (ADelt 18 Chr). Prousos. In the Monastery of the Prousiotissa, in the tangle of mountains between Karpenisi and Agrinion, the later frescoes of 1518 have been removed from the walls of the cave or 'crypt', against which the church is built, to reveal an earlier decora- tion. This was executed in a lively if provincial style of the thirteenth century and is to be published by P. Lazarides, who was responsible for the work (ADelt 17 Chr I86 f.). Ayios Ilias. A Mycenaean chamber tomb and four tholos tombs have been excavated in and around this village near Aitoliko by E. Mastrokosta (A.S.). The chamber tomb contained three burials, pottery of LH IIIA types, numerous cornelian and paste beads and a few of gold, bronze knives and a scarab with the cartouche of Amenophis III. The largest of the tholos tombs, at the locality 'Seremeti', is 5'27 m. in diameter, but recent bull-dozing has spared only a few courses of its walls and dromos. The burials had been disturbed in antiquity, but a number of gold beads with embossed decoration, 1,444 of cornelian and other small objects were recovered. The other three tholos tombs, all at the locality 'Marathia', are better preserved. Marathia I and 2 stand 19 courses high at some points and the dromos of the latter retains its slab roofing. All had been robbed, but Marathia 3 yielded a small group of IIIC vases. EPIRUS Pantanassa. A short account of the Middle Palaeolithic site in the Louros gorge discovered by E. G. Higgs in 1962 has appeared in Man lxiii 2 f. In the summer of 1963 S. Dakaris undertook a trial excavation there, in which Higgs participated. Strata representing two cold phases were identified and, between them, artifacts were found stratified on two horizons attesting two distinct industries in the warmer intermediate period. The one is Middle Palaeolithic and the other possibly the earliest Upper Palaeolithic Homo Sapiens industry identified in Europe. The site is on the west side of the Louros gorge, upstream from Pantanassa. Continuing his search for early sites, Higgs located, on the east side of the gorge, near Ayios Georghios, two caves with surface evidence of Mousterian and later deposits. Michalitsa. Near this village north of Nikopolis and some Io km. from Preveza, S. Dakaris has excavated a series of tombs dated by coins to the second half of the fourth century B.c., one of them containing a trefoil-mouth bronze jug with a bearded head in relief below the handle. Fragments of marble sculpture and other remains of tomb monu- ments come from the same area. Here Dakaris would place the ancient Charadra, which he equates with the town later founded, or refounded, by Pyrrhus and named in honour of Berenice (ADelt 17 Chr 187-194).- Arta. In the centre of the town, Dakaris has followed-up the discovery of massive foundation blocks on a site in King Pyrrhus Street cleared for the building of shops. They might well have carried a temple, a conclusion which the discovery of an Ionic volute supports. Apart from remains of its walls incorporated in the Byzantine castle, little else of the ancient Ambracia is at present to be seen. The principal monument of Byzantine Arta, the Pare- goritissa Church, is the subject of a recent Archaeo- logical Society monograph by A. K. Orlandos.1 It contains good colour and black and white repro- ductions of the late thirteenth-century mosaics of the Pantokrator and Prophets in the dome, the excellence of which their recent cleaning has revealed. Mesopotamos. S. Dakaris (A.S.) has completed the excavation of the ancillary buildings of the Thesprotian Nekyomanteion lying to the west of the 'House of Hades' (Arch. Reports for 1960-61 15 and fig. 15; . . . for 1961-62 13). It was evidently through this western area that those who wished to consult the spirits of the dead approached the main building. Through a gateway in the outer north wall a courtyard was reached. from which the long north corridor with its adjoining waiting rooms was then entered. Priests' houses and the like enclosed the courtyard which, with the exception of some additions of Roman date, are of the same Hellenistic construction as the sanctuary proper. Finds from the area included a few classical sherds but material of the Geometric and Archaic periods is at present lacking. An LH cist-grave was found in the court- yard. A Mycenaean type of dagger came to light 1 'H HapqyopwTtaaa aTg "ApzT7g, Athens, 1963.</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 15 during tree-planting close to the sanctuary (ADelt 18 Chr). Dakaris has summarised the results of his work on this site in Antike Kunst Beiheft i, 35-55. Dodona. Prior to the restoration of the retaining wall of the theatre on the east side, which is now in progress, Dakaris examined the area immediately outside it. Here the theatre was seen to have cut an FIG. 15 earlier wall running towards the southwest angle of the acropolis enclosure. This may survive from a predecessor of the existing late third-century peribolos wall round the sanctuary, which lies to the east (recent plans in Antike Kunst Beiheft i, 40-41). In the third-century fill against the wall of the theatre were found numerous units of burnt brick, seven of which when fitted together form the circumference of an Ionic column of maximum diameter at least 88 cms. Bedded in the lime-mortar and stuccoed to imitate marble, they evidently served to revet the weight- carrying core of the column, which perhaps included a stout wooden post. By the south gate into the acropolis was found the massive cast-bronze shoe of the door pivot and, in situ, the socket plate in which it had turned (ADelt 18 Chr). THESSALY Sesklo. D. Theocharis (A.S.) has resumed his re- examination of the prehistoric acropolis near Volos with the excavation of two areas on the northeast side. In Area I, a substantial building of the classic Sesklo culture (Early Neolithic IV) impeded exam- ination of the earliest levels. In Area 2, a thick deposit of the earliest pottery phase produced only a small number of sherds and a miniature vase with impressed decoration. Beneath it a few fragments of experimental character were found which the excavator dates to the mid-seventh millennium and which suggest a gradual transition from the pre- pottery phase without any cultural break. The presence of the same type of microliths and stone 'ear-studs' in both the pre-pottery and the earliest pottery levels points to the same conclusion. Demetrias. Theocharis reports the discovery and partial excavation of a second Christian basilica which he assigns to the late fourth century, outside the walls on the south slope of the Prophet Elias hill. It is of the usual three-aisled type but has the curious feature of an apse or exedra in the middle of the south wall (ADelt 18 Chr). Philia. Following illicit excavations at the locality 'Hamamia' by this village on the right bank of the Sophaditiko river, 18 km. southeast of Karditsa, D. Theocharis has investigated the area. This proved to be a sanctuary and the source of numerous bronze figurines and attachments of Geometric date which have appeared on the market. Many similar bronzes were found, including figurines (one of the type Richter, Handbook 18o, fig. 270), animal attachments and numerous fibulae (a catch-plate, Fig. 15). From the same site comes the very worn marble head of an early fifth-century kouros. Inscription fragments include one from a decree of the second century B.C., one word of which invites the restoration ['A]O1v&amp;[;]. For the Sophaditiko is generally equated with the Kouralios which, accord- ing to Strabo (ix 5. 17), flowed past a sanctuary of Itonian Athena to join the Peneios. Two deep FIG.

Laying of water-pipes in the Ayios Athanasios quarter exposed mosaic floors at two points, possibly to be connected with that of the Asklepieion previously discovered (Kathimerini 16. 11.1963). Homolion. Following an accidental find of jewel- lery of the Classical period in 1961, at the foot of the 'Dapi Rachi' ridge at the outlet of Tempe, D. Theocharis completed the excavation of the tomb where it was found. The remaining contents included two polychrome glass alabastra and a small black-glaze hydria. Outstanding among the jewel- lery is a pair of lunate gold earrings, the ends of which are linked by plaited chains hanging below. Each is ornamented with concentric bands of applied anthemia and radial leaves with granulated edgings, and on each stands a Pegasus, surmounted in one case by a dove (Fig. I6). An adjoining tomb yielded a finger-ring with a swivel bezel of lapis lazuli, between facings of crystal. On one of these is carved a representation of Thetis on a hippocamp bearing the arms of Achilles, and on the other Eros on a dolphin (ADelt 16 Chr 176 f.). MACEDONIA With the sponsorship of the British School, E. S. Higgs continued his search for Palaeolithic sites in Western Macedonia undertaken for the Cambridge Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology. His other discoveries were over-shadowed by the finding of an Acheulian hand-axe near Palaiokastro, south of the Kozani-Grevena road (Antiquity xxxviii 54). This artifact, now in the Verroia Museum, ranks as the earliest yet found in Greece. Nea Nikomedeia. A second campaign of excava- tions sponsored by the British School was conducted by G. Clark and R. Rodden at the Early Neolithic settlement, for whose first phase a radio-carbon date in the latter part of the seventh millennium B.C. was obtained in 1961. The area previously examined (see Arch. Reports for 1961-62 30) has been extended to include almost the whole of that part of the mound o- o S1963 ........ | i : I ?

This campaign has elucidated the settlement pattern at the time of the earliest occupation (Fig. 17). In addition, a trench 8 m. in FIG. 18 width was opened up to the northeast of this main area, with the aim of defining the limit of the settle- ment, but the perimeter was not reached. Indications of two Early Neolithic building periods were found in both areas, where the foundations of buildings of the second phase overlie, and in several instances cut through the wall-slots of the earlier houses. The houses attributable to the earliest building period were rectangular, generally one- room structures, measuring 6-8 m. long; they were arranged round a much larger central building, which may have served some ritual purpose. This structure was approximately 12 m. square and was divided into three sections; when it was rebuilt after a serious fire, the tripartite arrangement was pre- served. The objects found within it confirmed its special function; they included five female figurines made of unbaked clay (Fig. I8), two unusually large green-stone axes, measuring 20o ms. in length, gourd-shaped pottery vessels and several caches of unworked flints, each comprising about 40o blades. Parts of eight houses pertaining to the second period of building have been defined; they all follow a slightly different orientation, and they include two-roomed as well as one-roomed structures. In both periods the same methods of construction were employed. On account of the high water-table, the foundation trenches and post-holes are often very deep, and it is apparent that these were filled with drier material or with clay-marl, which was allowed to dry before the wall was built. In most cases the walls had a sturdy framework of posts, between which reeds were woven, and were completed with mud- plaster inside and out. There is some evidence that the mud floors were plastered onto a matting of grasses or reeds. Twenty-three burials were dis- covered, contracted and usually in shallow pits outside the houses, singly and without grave-goods. Preliminary study of some 25,000 animal bone fragments suggests that sheep and goats were of primary importance, but that pigs and cattle were also kept. Wheat, barley, lentils and peas were cultivated, while wild fruits and nuts augmented the diet. A great number of bone points and awls were discovered; there are also small delicately-worked needles and pins and five very well made bone fish- hooks. Local flint was worked into small blades, probably for mounting in wooden or bone hafts; there are also two flint blade trapezes. Serpentine or greenstone was used for small axes, adzes and chisels, for three amulets carved in the shape of frogs (one of them pierced for suspension) and for very small pins or studs of excellent workmanship, sug- FIG. 19</page><page sequence="16">18 A. H. S. MEGAW gesting they were objects of value, possibly used as head-dress ornaments. A number of stamps were found, made from baked clay, the designs on them carved when the clay was semi-hard (for these and other finds see Ill. London News, Apr. I I and 18, 1964). The pottery includes between thirty and forty com- plete specimens, among them a number of miniature vessels and three gourd-shaped pots, two with oval bases, for which as yet no parallels are known (Fig. xg). Plain wares are commonest, and the predom- inant shapes are fairly high-walled, open-mouthed bowls and slightly closed-mouth forms, both with ring bases (Fig. 2o). Parts of five anthropomorphic pottery vessels were found; these bear indications of FIG. 20 a human nose and eyes modelled just below the rim, and are comparable with vessels found at Hacilar and Hassuna. The contemporaneity at this site of the impressed ware, the red-on-the-cream painted ware and the rarer white-painted ware observed in 1961 has been confirmed. The types indicate close connection with the Thessalian 'Proto-Sesklo' and 'Pre-Sesklo' phases and also suggest some relation- ship with the earliest certainly verifiable Neolithic settlements in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Roumania. There is evidence that baskets also were used: a number of sherds bear clear impressions of basketry or matting made by twining; the excavators believe this to be the earliest evidence for twined basketry yet recorded. Verroia. Petsas reports the excavation of a Hellen- istic two-chamber tomb found with some of later date on the site of the new Girls' Gymnasium on the Kozani road (ADelt i9 Chr). This tomb is note- worthy for the unusually large size of the several terracotta figurines it contained, each some 50 cms. high. Another Hellenistic tomb was found intact in the 'Ergatiki Estia' quarter, while in a third, by the Tripotamon, remains of frescoes attested its re-use for Christian worship (ADelt I8 Chr). Naoussa. Petsas reports the discovery of a cave at Rhodochori which has yielded material (now in the Verroia Museum) characteristic of the Late Neo- lithic Larisa culture (ADelt 19 Chr). Following construction of an external access staircase to the great tomb at Levkadhia with the two-storeyed facade (see Arch. Reports for 1960-61 19), the original entrance was re-opened. Petsas (A.S.) then excavated the central part of the ante- chamber, through the vault of which it had previously been entered. Finds from the disturbed filling included four curious leaf-shaped objects of clear, moulded glass, the largest about o1Io m. long. In the forthcoming volume of Arch. Ephemeris Petsas publishes a third-century inscription recording ten sale contracts, which was found during the excavation of the tomb. The contracts are dated by naming those who held local offices at the time, including priests of Asclepius and the rayoi of the city, which is unnamed. The accidental discovery of a mosaic pavement at the neighbouring locality 'Baltaneto' led to the partial excavation by Petsas of a building of the Roman period, possibly a large villa, of which the northern limit only has been established. The floors, which are exclusively of geometric designs, appear to be earlier than those found by E. Stikas at 'Tsifliki' south of Levkadhia in I959 and are assigned to the second century A.D. Vergina. 65 of the mounds excavated in 196o/61 on the line of the new road between Vergina and Palatitsa, where it traverses the great tumulus cemetery, have been published by Ph. Petsas (ADelt 17, 218 ff.). Six of these contained one or more Early Bronze Age burials, one of them no less than 59; most of the remaining tumuli were of the Early Hellenistic period. The contents of eight more, which are similar, are to be published in ADelt 18 Chr. These do not include the two tumuli damaged during construction of an irrigation channel, one of which produced what is perhaps the outstanding find from the whole cemetery: a bronze sword of northern type. Pella. While work continued on the protection of the remarkable late fourth-century floor mosaics previously discovered, Ch. Makaronas in 1962 extended his excavations in the adjoining insulae, without, however, discovering any more. In insula 6, across the road from the house of the Stag Hunt, four Doric capitals attested the presence here also of a house of the best class with a peristyle, but this had been replaced by a series of small rooms evidently used as stores and workshops. In one were found over Ioo lamps of the first century B.c., apparently unused, as well as evidence of metal working. Insula 2, north of that containing the house of the Lion Hunt, also appears to have been in artisan occupation, to judge by the presence of a kiln and figurine moulds, already in the Hellenistic period. Here there are earlier structures similarly orientated but aligned to a different frontage, evidently antedating the final Hippodamian grid. On the Acropolis, to the southeast of the rectangular</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE I9 building excavated in I960, possibly a sanctuary, Makaronas excavated a monumental propylon. The bases of its dividing piers, which had engaged Ionic columns, were in situ and the capitals of the flanking pilasters were also found. Nearby was the base of a votive tripod, the fourth in this area (ADelt 18 Chr). Salonika. Excavations in 1962 on the site chosen for the new Law Courts disclosed substantial remains of a Late Roman odeum. Ch. Makaronas, S. Pelekanides and G. Bakalakis jointly directed the work, and Miss Ph. Papadopoulou is reporting on it briefly in ADelt 18 Chr. The marble-paved orchestra is slightly elliptical and the lowest seats are raised above it on a high plinth. The proscaenium wall has eleven niches, alternatively semicircular and rectangular, constructed in brick faced with marble and flanked by stairs leading to the proscaenium. Before it were found two headless marble statues of Muses, identifiable by their attributes as Thaleia and Erato. The scaena is paved with mosaic, at the level of the orchestra floor, in meander and interlace designs. Monumental doorways lead from it to vaulted lobbies under the lower seats, whence the orchestra is entered. The lower part of one of the broad stairways leading to the diazoma was also found. The construction, of rubble masonry alter- nating with bands of brick, is characteristic of the monuments of the Tetrarchy and a Corinthian capital found in the building would fit that dating. S. Pelekanides reports that the remains discovered to the east of the church of St. Sophia belong to a predecessor: a large three-aisled basilica of the fifth century. Part of the apse was found and west of it the steps leading up to a platform for a clergy-bench, evidently one of a pair facing each other across the altar (ADelt 17 Chr 253 ff.). The restoration of the church of the Prophet Elias has been completed, including the reconstruction of the small domed chapels. Parts of these were discovered, together with some of their fresco decorations, at the four angles of the building on removal of massive Turkish buttresses. Dherveni. Makaronas is publishing in ADelt 18 Chr an account of the exceptionally rich late fourth- century graves found in 1962 (Arch. Reports for 1961- 62 15). Among the cremation ashes in the magni- ficent bronze crater in grave B was a gold triobol of Philip II, and there was one of Alexander the Great in grave F. Inscribed on the crater in Thessalian dialect is the name Asteiounios of Larisa, son of Anaxagoras, doubtless its owner. Excellent photo- graphs taken after cleaning have appeared in BCH 87 pls. 18-20. A silver jug from grave B is illustrated in Fig. 2I. The papyrus recovered from the remains of the pyre overlying grave A, from a commentary on Orphic theogony, has been published by S. G. Kapsomanos in Gnomon 1963, 222 f. Close to the graves-in all six were excavated-a trial trench encountered, at a depth of 5 m., walls of heavy limestone blocks excellently constructed and joined by iron clamps set in lead. Stratoni. In 1962 P. Themele excavated a small sepulchral Heroon of the Roman period accidentally discovered at this village on the east coast of Chal- cidice. Within what was evidently an unroofed enclosure three marble funerary statues were found. One, female and complete, had fallen from a central podium against the back wall and is possibly to be connected with a funeral meal relief found nearby and inscribed: NEtLKOarTEApa, 'EmUtKOvz, pCIpa), taypE. The flanking statues were male and headless, but a head of Julio-Claudian type evidently belongs to that by which it was found. A sarcophagus stood on one FIG. 21 side, while below the floor were a cist grave and pithos burial, all robbed (ADelt 18 Chr). Philippi. S. Pelekanides (A.S.) resumed the un- covering of the well-preserved mosaic floor dis- covered below the marble paving of the Octagonal Church and belonging to a predecessor of basilican form. One section comprises a series of square panels between broad borders, the panels containing such motifs as birds beneath a tree and a krater between confronting peacocks. To the east of the Octagon and extending northward to meet the Via Egnatia, a street was excavated which forms the limit to the Baptistery-Baths complex to the north of the church. The excavation of the baths themselves has also been completed and along the frontage to the Via Egnatia a paved colonnade has been exposed. Subsequently, beneath the earlier church which the</page><page sequence="18">20 A. H. S. MEGAW Octagon replaced, a Macedonian tomb came to light. It appeared to be empty, but excavating below the 'floor' D. Lazarides found a remarkable series of gold objects, including a wreath of oak- leaves, an ornate diadem, a buckle and embossed bands (Kathimerini 13.11.1963). FIG. 22 Kavala (anc. Neapolis). The productive exca- vations in Theodore Poulides Street, which revealed a stretch of the peribolos wall of the Parthenos sanctuary, and struck a rich but partly disturbed archaic deposit, is the subject of a recent summary report by D. Lazarides (ADelt 17 Chr 235 f.). To the account in BCH 1962, 830 ff., this adds an illustration of the 'Melian' amphora which was one of the out- standing finds (Fig. 22). It carries the foundation of Neapolis back into the seventh century. The subject on the neck is identified by Mrs Papaspyridi-Karou- zou as Thetis, attended by dancing Nereids, about to receive the embrace of Peleus; on the body, much defaced, is a chariot drawn by winged horses. THE CYCLADES Andros. N. Drandakis has identified the site of a basilica with mosaic floors and marbles of fifth-century type at Palaiopolis, locality 'Tou Platou,' and the probable site of another nearby (ADelt 18 Chr). Kea. The American School excavations directed byJ. Caskey with support from the University of Cincinnati were resumed at the Ayia Irini settlement (Arch. Reports for z96z-62 19-20), while at the Kefala cemetery, some 2 km. to the north, work was completed. The Kefala graves occupy a cleft in the rock at the southern foot of the headland on which the corresponding settle- ment has been identified. They had walls of stone and were covered with a series of narrow slabs. They had generally been used for several successive burials in a contracted position, but bodies of infants in jars were found in single graves. Offer- ings, which were not plentiful, included a small ithyphallic terracotta. The pottery, which like that of the settlement is of a coarse, friable red-brown ware, is sometimes decorated with plastic bands, incisions and burnished patterns. Jars with upright rims and small incurving bowls are common. Affinities with Late Neolithic wares sug- gest that the Kefala settlement is among the earliest yet known in the Cyclades. Deep soundings at Ayia Irini furnished ample evidence of Early Bronze Age occupation. Sherds of sauce-boats and small bowls of types well known in EH II on the mainland were found on the rock, and, in some places, neatly-constructed house walls. For the Middle Bronze Age successive phases of rebuilding are attested, the pottery including ring-stemmed goblets and angular bowls with high ribbon-handles in grey Minyan ware, matt-painted of mainland and Aeginetan types and a fragment of imported MM 'Kamares' ware (Fig. 23).</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 21 FIG. 23 More of the defensive wall of the LH settlement, 2 m. wide at one point, was exposed on the landward side of the promontory; the sherds associated with the main structure indicate that it antedates the principal fortifications of the Mycenaean mainland. Within the settlement the substantial remains in Area A to the east of the church of Ayia Irini (for plans see Hesperia xxxi, 267 and 269) are now seen to belong to a single large establishment comprising a courtyard, staircase, corridors and deep cellars, the latter filled with debris fallen from the upper rooms and attesting widespread destruction by earthquake. The range of the assignable pottery, which includes many fine pieces imported from Crete and the mainland as well as other Cycladic islands, is from ... . . .. LMIA to LMII and LHI to LHII, including the Palace style (Fig. 24). A Linear A graffito on a fragment of a plain jar indicates its function, for one of the two signs is common to Linear A and B and, in the latter, stands for wine. The excavation of the temple was resumed; this adjoins the Area A building to the northeast, across a narrow alley. It was found to terminate at the inner end in two narrow rooms side-by-side. On the floor of one of these a group of fifteen or more frag- mentary terracotta statues was found, associated with objects datable not later than LH/LM II, confirming the destruction date indicated for Area A. All the FIG. 25 statues seem to be female, with flaring skirts topped by heavy bands at the narrow waist; some have jackets open in front to expose the breasts in the Cretan fashion. The heads are surmounted with thick coils (Fig. 25) and the hair, gathered behind, falls in a long braid down the back. In the outer rooms of the temple, the earliest floors, which slope down below sea level, yielded LHI-II pottery, one end of a bronze boat and the upper part of a solid bronze statuette of a youth saluting, an import assignable to LM I. Re-use of the temple with some structural alterations is attested by upper levels of debris, one of them with much Myc. IIIC pottery; and a long series of successive floor levels in the room of the statues marks the continuation of the cult with little interruption down to the Greco-Roman period. The head of one of the statues installed on the original floor was apparently found some 700oo years later and set-up on a platform of stones on a pavement in use in $@t%</page><page sequence="20">22 A. H. S. MEGAW the second half of the eighth century. Votives from an Archaic level include cups of Attic and Corinthian types, among them the base of a skyphos with a graffito dedication to Dionysus, whose cult is also attested by a fourth-century graffito. There was however, no general post-Mycenaean re-occupation of the site. Delos. Exploration of the North Quarter was resumed for the French School by P. Bruneau with Cl. Vatin, U. Bezerra and Anne Bovon. A second house, which forms a single unit with the House of the Comedians, has been excavated. On two sides the court has colonnaded porticoes which it appears were repeated in the upper storey, but with a parapet. The principal room was on the north and paved with mosaic. At the centre of a geometrical field were two figured panels, of which one had been removed in antiquity. In the other, an Eros flies above a sea- creature carrying a be-ribboned rudder. Poorer houses to the north and a broad street on the west were also partly excavated. Occupation of this sector seems to have been short-lived; between 125 B.c. and one of the first-century destructions. Paros. N. Zapheiropoulos reports promising results from a trial excavation in the coastal area to the northeast of Paroikia, where the Archaic cemetery was situated. In a small area by the Ayii Anargyri torrent, several graves of children and two cremations were found; these yielded a small group of Protc- corinthian vases and two of Corinthian. One of the cremations was in an amphora with Geometric decoration like that in Dilos xv pl. 8. 29; it was covered by a Protocorinthian kotyle. Many geo- metric and orientalising sherds were found out of context, and it was established that in the same area other graves exist at greater depth (ADelt 18 Chr). Excavations by A. Orlandos (A.S.) have revealed further remains of earlier buildings under the Justinianic Katopoliani church. A double entrance to the demolished atrium was found close to the southwest corner of the existing building, to which the atrium is now assigned. This small por(h has niches in its lateral walls. Re-used material in an adjoining wall included a second century A.D. ephebe list under a gymnasiarch Zenon--riT Aanpda H1apo v :dTAEo;. Under the floor of the central part of the church, beneath the dome, the lower parts of four column-shafts were found, two on either side. These are not associated with an earlier floor and are no longer thought to belong to an earlier wood- roofed basilica, since no continuation of these 'colonnades' was found further west. The existing church is now seen to have replaced not a temple of Demeter as some thought, nor an earlier church, but a secular structure of the Roman period. Remains of the mosaic floor of one of the rooms of this building have been found in the central part of the church and extending into the north arm. The Labours of Herakles were arranged in a border round the central panel; the Erymanthine boar and the Ceryneitan stag alone are fully preserved. The figure style and the character of the borders indicate a date around A.D. 300. Naxos. N. Kondoleon (A.S.) resumed his excava- tions near the town interrupted since i961. On the slopes of Aplomata hill the ravaged Protogeometric and later cemetery yielded some informative if fragmentary pottery, including a notable proportion belonging to the so-called 'Parian' vases of the Geometric and Orientalising period. A trial to the south of the Cycladic houses excavated close to the shore in 1949 confirmed the continuation of the settlement, but at a depth of 6 m. Finds here included a fragment of Minyan ware with a graffito akin to the trident symbol of Minoan Linear A. The remains of the Mycenaean town were also further examined. Among house-remains assignable to various phases of Myc. III were found, apart from imported Mycenaean pottery, further fragments of the contemporary local ware which favoured poly- chrome decoration, including a few pictorial pieces (lion, bird, etc.). Ch. Doumas has examined two of several curious enclosures which illicit excavations had disturbed at 'Alonakia' near Tragea. The best preserved, about 9 m. in diameter, has two concentric walls and en- closed a pyre 2-50 m. across containing ashes, burnt bones and an iron sword beneath a covering layer of clean sand. Round about the enclosure were smaller pyres and a paving of rough stones, among which were wedged coarse pots (compare Arch. Ephem. 1912, Io f.), filled with sand. Finds included three bracelets each consisting of a double length of gold wire, twisted at the looped end and formed into several coils (ADelt 18 Chr). Thera. Apart from the important Attic vases excavated in 1961 by N. Zapheiropoulos by the ancient road on the northeast slope of the 'Sella' saddle (BCH 86, 871 ff.), a recent report (ADelt 17 Chr 268 ff.) illustrates an interesting local imitation of a Rhodian orientalising plate, a type previously known only from fragments. In 1963 Zapheiro- poulos excavated a few more graves, one of them a cremation in a Kertch style pelike with Amazons. He also recovered a red-figure kylix of the severe style from a burnt deposit near a previously excavated grave. OTHER AEGEAN ISLANDS Samothrace. With the sponsorship of the American School and the support of New York University, and with Phyllis Lehmann as Acting Director, J. McCredie resumed work on the Hellenistic West Stoa of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. At the north end where the rock is lower, the search for evidence of an interior colonnade was rewarded by the discovery of three platforms of boulders at 6 m. intervals, which must have carried the columns of the Ionic order, at double the spacing of the outer Doric colonnade. Investigation of the great Ionic propylon dedicated by Ptolemy II was also started. Robbing of the marble pavement of the forecourt since the Austrian excavations ninety years ago has revealed that it was carried on a series of limestone sleeper walls (Fig. 26). In front of the forecourt was found a well-preserved</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 23 and unusual terracotta water-pipe, the junctions of which were bound with broad collars of lead. Mrs. E. Dusenbery and A. Vavritsas resumed ex- cavation of the South Necropolis, extending in a southerly direction. Here a pyre site with an accu- mulation of burnt matter, in places nearly 2 m. high, yielded many small objects, including Archaic bronze fibulae; while Attic figured vases as well as examples of the local Archaic wares were found in single cre- mation burials nearby. In the west part of the new area a number of rich Roman burials in tile tombs were found, with plentiful blown glass in large and datable groups. From one of them came a yellow lead-glazed vase on a pedestal decorated with reliefs of Dionysiac masks and cult objects, for which affinity with Arretine kraters indicates a date early in the first century A.D. Volume 4, part ii of the Samothrace publication, The Altar Court, by the late K. Lehmann and D. Spittle has now appeared. Thasos. Continuing the French School excava- tions, F. Salviat resumed exploration of the area to the east of the Agora. Here, behind portico IX and the apsidal room and passage found in 1962 (BCH 1963, 548 ff.), a large public square was laid out in the replanning of the area in the Roman period, bounded on the northwest by the previously-excavated North Building (BCH 1932, 276 ff.). Further south, the paved way, which was the principal thoroughfare of the city, has been laid bare for a length of some 55 m. C1. Rolley has started excavation of the Evraio- Castro sanctuary after study of the Christian basilica which replaced it. The basilica, partly obscured by a modern chapel, had three aisles and a narthex and is assigned to the fifth century. At the north end of the narthex, a small circular chamber was added, probably in the sixth century, and here a tomb was later installed. Of the earlier sanctuary the principal visible feature is a terrace wall of the mid-fifth century, but the sanctuary existed before it to judge by the discovery in the terrace fill of antefixes (Fig. 27) and votives of earlier date, some of them from the late sixth century. In the same context were numer- ous kernoi and female terracotta figurines of Attic and Rhodian as well as local types, mainly of the severe style. Hellenistic votives were found in the layer overlying the terrace-fill. The inscriptions found designate a civic sanctuary, one where the Apaturia FIG. 26 FIG. 27</page><page sequence="22">24 A. H. S. MEGAW were celebrated; Zeus, Athena, Artemis, the Nymphs and Kore are all named. At the Gate of Zeus, where the surviving relief is now considered to represent Iris before Hera enthroned (BCH 1962, 945), new fragments of sculpture have been found by R. Martin. These indicate that on the opposite jamb a second relief depicted Hermes before a seated Zeus. Further excavations in the sanctuary at Aliki by FIG. 28 J. Servais and F. Salviat have uncovered beside the building previously found (BCH 1962, 950 fig. I6), a second one of similar plan datable around 500 B.C. Its portico has five Doric columns between antae (the earliest known use of the order in Northern Greece); and the larger of the two compartments entered from it has a central altar-eschara with a marble kerb. In front of the building was found a stele giving in a stoichedon inscription of about 450 B.c. the distances from place to place in a circuit of the island. D. Lazarides reports the excavation by Miss A. Rhomiopoulou of a cave, close to the Aliki sanctuary, containing votive pottery and figurines, including many of Archaic date. Corinthian ary- balloi and other small forms predominate, but there are fragments of a Rhodian plate, with a deer, of the classical Camiran style of the late seventh century (ADelt 18 Chr). Lemnos. S. Charitonides reports a find of fifth- to third-century terracottas on the castle hill at Myrina and a monogram of Demetrius Palaeologus from the medieval castle at Kotsinos (ADelt 18 Chr). Mytilene. At two points in the town Charitonides reports the observation of mosaic floors indicating the presence of Christian basilicas, and elsewhere in the island surface indication of 18 others previously unrecorded. Clearance work undertaken by Charit- onides at the basilica at Eresos published by A. Orlandos (ADelt 12, 29 ff.) disclosed that the narthex also was paved with mosaic and uncovered an apsidal extension of the north aisle. Indications that it overlies an earlier church were also found (ADelt 18 Chr). Samos. In an autumn campaign, the German Institute, with H. Walter in charge, re-examined the area of the 'Rhoikos altar' in front of the temple of Hera, originally excavated in 1932-33 (AM 58 (1933) 146 ff. and 211 ff.). Within the rectangle enclosed by the foundations of this structure Buschor had discovered the remains of a series of earlier altars, but had left a considerable area undug. Near his Altar III and half under water, the stump of a tree was found which, since it lies on the axis of the earliest temple, is to be regarded as a relic of Hera's sacred Chaste Tree. This area was particularly rich in Geometric and Archaic terracottas, while the pre- sence of Mycenaean sherds carries the cult back into the second millennium. The contents of a well just outside the east foundation included a sixth-century kore statuette of bronze, in excellent condition (Fig. 28), and a griffin protome. The Orientalising period was well represented by finds from both sides of the east foundation, which included ivories and other imports from the Near East and Egypt. E. Homann-Wedeking carried out stratigraphical soundings in the previously-excavated north area of the sanctuary. Above the remains of the EH settlement lie thin LH and Early Archaic layers, to which belong the scant remains of a megaron-like structure. The Northwest Hall was extended into the area examined in the Archaic period and at a higher level are Hellenistic and Roman walls. Rhodes. 59 inscriptions from excavations in the city have been published by G. Konstantinopoulou (ADelt 18, 1-30). Of several statue-bases, one gives the name of a third-century sculptor Theudoros of Paros and another, of the first century B.c., that of Aristokrates of Rhodes; both previously unknown. I. Kondis is preparing an account of the walls of the ancient city, of which the first part dealing with the</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 25 literary sources has appeared (ADelt 18, 77 iff). Recent discoveries enable him to argue convincingly against the prevailing view that during the great siege of 305/304 B.C. Demetrius was encamped at the northernmost point of the island. Excavations in forty-one building sites examined by FIG. 29 Miss K. Phatourou in 1962 clarified the plan of the ancient city at many points and uncovered remains of some major buildings, from one of which were recovered substantial fragments of architectural decoration in stucco, painted in the first Pompeian style. Some of the sites lay in the cemetery areas. In the earliest of these, to the south of the acropolis, the contents of the tombs excavated include some perhaps as old as the synoikismos. A Hadra type hydria dates early in the second century the complex of built vaults found on the road to Lindos (ADelt 18 Chr). Kythera. Trial excavations sponsored by the British School have been made at and around 'Kastri', the Minoan settlement identified by Miss S. Benton in i931. They were conducted by G. Huxley, N. Coldstream and R. Hope Simpson with support from the Pennsylvania University Museum. A line of trenches on the west slope of the promontory, extending down to the former mouth of the Palaiopolis river, disclosed under a Roman overlay numerous house-walls associated with plentiful Minoan pottery, both locally-made and imported. The lowest levels yielded sherds at least as early as MM II, including some of 'Kamares' type, which places this among the earliest Minoan colonies outside Crete. The height of its prosperity was reached in the sixteenth century B.c., to judge by the predominance of LM I pottery. Together with fragments of Cretan fabric are many from locally-made jugs with tortoiseshell ripple decoration and spirals, and others from goblets of 'Vapheio' type. Whole vases of this local pottery were recovered from tombs which had been exposed in the road adjoining the site and partly cleared in 1957 (Fig. 29). Most of these have now been fully excavated and planned. In one (tomb C) a fine steatite bowl was found and another (tomb D) yielded as many as 132 vases. Tomb E, on the nearby Asprogas ridge, proved to have six side-compartments opening off the central rectangular chamber. The abundant MM IIIB to LM IA pottery found was disturbed and broken when the tomb was re-used in Roman times. Restorable vases included an imported mug of 'Vapheio' type, two large shallow cups imitating metal forms and three pottery imitations of steatite 'blossom' bowls (Fig. 30). Although none of the material from the five tombs excavated is later than LM IA, the Kastri settlement was not abandoned until about the middle of the fifteenth century. Among the latest pottery from the trial trenches Minoan wares still predominate, including examples of the marine style, but LH IIA fragments also occur. As yet no evidence has been found of a violent end and no trace of fire, and it seems possible that the abandonment of this Minoan settlement at Kastri was in the nature of a strategic withdrawal in face of the Mycenaean threat to Crete. Some fifth-century B.C. sherds were collected but the centre of the Archaic and Classical settlement in the area, identifiable as the ancient Skandeia, has not FIG. 30</page><page sequence="24">26 A. H. S. MEGAW yet been located. Casual finds include a fragment of a large marble acroterion, a metrical epitaph and a marble table, the two last of Roman date. CRETE Fifteen new Greek inscriptions, many of them in the new museum at Ayios Nikolaos, have been published by K. Davaras (ADelt 18 141 ff.). One of them, in the Metaxas collection in Herakleion, gives FIG. 31 FIG. 32 a substantial addition to the fragmentary Insc. Cr. iv 184, a treaty between Gortyn and Gaudos. Herakleion Museum. Four new rooms have been opened, one of them entirely devoted to the spectacu- lar new finds from N. Platon's excavations at Zakro. In another is being arranged a display of finds associated with the final destruction of the palace at Knossos. Included in this exhibit are some vases recently restored, as the result of M. Popham's researches, from sherd material preserved in the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos. They include a fine LM IIIA amphoroid krater, one of the earliest of the vases of this shape (Fig. 31). This has been restored from sherds, some found by Evans in the Eighth Magazine, some from the contents of a re-occupation buttress wall in the S. Propylaeum and some from material found in the same general area. Some of S. Hood's finds from the LM IB deposit beside the Royal Road are also on display for the first time. Another new gallery has been assigned to the Yiamalakis collection, acquired by the Greek state in 1962 for the equivalent of ?47,ooo. Three hoards of Byzantine and later coins have been acquired for the Museum: ninety gold nomis- mata found near Ayies Paraskies (Herak.), eight of Nicephoras Phocas (BMC type 2) and the remainder of Basil II and Constantine VIII (as BMC no. I); sixty-nine silver skyphate nomismata of John II and Manuel I from Itia (Siteia); and forty-six Venetian gold bezants, mostly of Francesco Foscari, from Bentenaki (ADelt 18 Chr). Katsambas. S. Alexiou (A.S.) continued his ex- cavation of the rich Late Minoan cemetery of the Harbour town of Knossos begun in 1951 and 1953 (Kr Chr 1952, 5 and BCH 1954, I50). He has uncovered a fine tomb, plundered in antiquity, whose dromos was found 9 m. below the surface. Out- standing among its contents, which included two larnakes, kylikes, a fine three-handled amphora and stone vases, are a carved ivory pyxis with a scene interpreted by Alexiou as the capturing of a wild bull in the mountains (Fig. 32), and an ivory comb en- graved with a confronting pair of sphinxes. It is reported that traces of bright blue paint were found on one part of the floor of the chamber, the roof of which was supported by a central column of rock. The vases are LM III A in style though the ivory pyxis and some of the stone vases are considered to be heirlooms of an earlier date. Gazi. In a trial excavation in this coastal area west of Herakleion, Alexiou (A.S.) identified a MM III-LM I farmhouse at the locality 'Ellinika'. Phaistos. D. Levi has completed the Italian School excavations in the area of the town selected for examination at 'Chalara' on the southeast slope of the Palace hill. The north and south sections previously excavated in this area were united, re- vealing a street of the Hellenistic complex which, like that in the south section had originated in the Geometric period. Fragments of Gnathia and Hadra wares, rare at Phaistos, were found in the adjoining Hellenistic buildings. Overlying the latter, remains of an extensive late Roman building</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 27 of poor construction, perhaps a farmhouse, had been found, while soundings beneath their floors revealed structures datable to the first Proto-palatial phase. Continuous occupation of the area was better attested in the south section where, beneath the imposing Late Palatial house previously excavated (itself followed by LM IIIA structures and eventually by the Hellenistic complex), earlier walls were found attributable to the third Proto-palatial phase by the associated FIG. 33 finds, which include two conical rhyta of early type. At one point, a well-defined Chalcolithic stratum was reached, close to the rock. To the west of the Palace, further investigation of the complex remains of all periods in the area of the lower west 'Piazzale' brought to light an imposing paved ramp, leading up from it to the theatral area. This ramp, which belongs to the second Proto- palatial phase, formed a terrace outside the entrance to bastion II, whence it divided into two opposite branches: one leading to the upper floors of the Palace, the other westward to the western edge of the theatral area. A massive wall with buttresses protected and retained the ramp, which in several respects recalls the early access ramps of Troy. FIGro. 34 Metropolis (near Gortyn). Following the discovery of a mosaic pavement, M. Michaelides and K. Davaras have uncovered much of a three-aisled Christian basilica. It has an exedra opening from about the middle of the south aisle. A further fragment of an inscription naming Trajan (Kret. Chron. 14 (1960) 460) has been found (ADelt 18 Chr). Mallia. Resuming the French School's explora- tion of the area north of the palace, H. van Effenterre excavated the buildings adjoining the North Court or 'Agora'. Their rather humble character contrasts with the imposing orthostats which face the court, and although a 're-occupation' building was exposed in the southern part of the east frontage, the hopes of finding a Mycenaean palace here were not realised. The well-constructed facade with re-entrants at this point was found to belong to an earlier building where LM I vases of floral style were found in situ. Further north, a building of small compartments, constructed on a burnt destruction layer, yielded numerous LM I stirrup vases. FIG. 35 In a cellar at the northeast corner was found abundant pottery of the second period of Mallia, including many vases with ripple decoration. Its consistent character is suggestive of a merchant's stock and lends colour to the tentative identification of the adjoining 'Agora'. The road network ex- posed to the north connects with the north gate into the court. It was established that it goes back to the first period, but was modified in the second. The public character of the court and its early date are thus established.

Pelon excavated an area east of House E, to follow-up a 'Mycenaean' level previously discovered. Three strata were recog- nised: the upper 'Mycenaean', accompanied by walls of feeble construction; the second characterised by pottery of LM IA type; and the lowest with an irregular calderim floor, which produced rippled ware jugs, dark painted pottery and some polychrome sherds. In this lowest level was found an ivory prism with two hieroglyphic signs of advanced type on each of its four faces (Fig. 33). Palaikastro. In conjunction with the British School's new stratigraphical excavations in the Minoan town site, the rehabilitation of the remains exposed in the original excavations of 1902 to I906 was undertaken at the request of the Archaeological Service. This task has now been completed under the direction of H. Sackett and M. Popham, and the new soundings started in 1962 have been rounded-off. Only part of the area at Roussolakkos uncovered in the original campaigns had been left open, that comprising parts of blocks F and A of the excavation plan (BSA Suppl. i pl. i). Here the floors have been cleared, lost structures re-formed in dry-stone walling and the surrounding retaining-walls rebuilt. Tests below floor level in A were unproductive, since the area had previously been disturbed below the LM level; but in the bathroom of block F a number of plain cups were found in a section of the LM IIIA deposit incompletely excavated in 1903 (BSA Suppl. i 84). In the new block N, two rooms of the LM IB house excavated in 1962 which had only been par- tially exposed have now been cleared. The larger, evidently the main room of the house, extended to the back wall and had apothekes on either side. One of these yielded a large number of plain vases including over 100 small cups, and another contained a pithos and a large jar, each filled with nests of similar plain cups. Overlying these LM I B remains, scant traces of LM III occupation were found, and, in a deep sounding, the footings of an MM wall on the bedrock. In the previously excavated room I of block X, a sounding started in 1962 was continued below the paved LM floor. Here a deposit, including some 40 MM I vases was found crushed on a clay floor, which covered traces of an EM building. The deposit included a good ivory seal, with an animal (lion?) at one end and a star at the other, pierced laterally in the centre with triple stringholes. Among the vases was a bowl decorated inside and out in white on a black matt paint (Fig. 34). A test below the floor of the adjoining room 4 struck a small deposit including a goblet of EM II Vasiliki type ware. Another sounding north of block B (square N3 on BSA Suppl. i pl. I) produced upper levels with LM III, LM I B and LM I A sherds overlying strata rich in MM pottery. From the trials made in 1902 on Kastri hill some scant traces of walls alone survived. Three areas</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 29 have now been cleared. Sherd evidence indicates that the walls are of LM III C date. A test below one of the associated floors revealed on an earlier floor destruction debris datable to an earlier phase of the same period, if not to LM IIIB, including a bowl (Fig. 35) which is the twin of BSA Suppl. i, II4, FIG. 38 the only vase from Kastri previously published. A second test produced some fine EM III decorated pottery, including a large hand-made jug of the finest quality (Fig. 36), in a pocket of debris below an LM III floor. Work has progressed on the cleaning and mending of the material from the 1962 excavations. A pre- liminary viewing of this well-stratified material indicates that it will confirm the original excavator's findings and provide a welcome fund of fresh detail. Kato Zakro. In a third campaign, N. Platon (A.S.) resumed excavation of all three sectors of the Minoan town, in the case of the now confirmed Palace (area F) with spectacular results. In area A parts of four houses have been uncovered. Under the floors of one, MM III remains were found; another had been partially re-occupied in LM IIIA.2. In area B, which like A lies on the 'eastern spur' of the original excavator's map (BSA vii, 125), 26 rooms of house B have now been excavated and, across a stepped street, parts of two more. The results obtained in these areas were over- shadowed by the dramatic developments in area F, between the eastern and western spurs, in the gully which Hogarth did not test. The scale of the building (Fig. 37), where the thirty-six rooms excavated are probably less than half the total, and the wealth of its contents have confirmed its palatial character. South of the storage basements and of the room E, where the elephant's tusks and copper ingots had been found in 1962, fallen from the upper storey, have now been excavated: an archive room (H), where in the recesses formed in the south wall a number of Linear A tablets was found; a shrine (0) containing a whole series of rhytons and a bench for idols and ritual vessels; a lustral area (X); and, above all, a treasury (0) with its store of ritual vessels intact. These include rhytons of various forms, of alabaster, marble, porphyry, rock-crystal and other materials, FIG. 39</page><page sequence="28">30 A. H. S. MEGAW 'communion chalices' of obsidian and marble (Fig. 38), plastic vases of faience in the form of animal heads or nautilus shells, ritual double-axes of bronze, one of them elaborately chased, and many vases, in all over ioo items. The largest unit (Z$) with a light-well in one corner (Ee) has not been fully excavated. Here were found two exceptionally fine rhytons; one of steatite in the form of a bull's head like that from Knossos but smaller (cover picture), and the other carved in low relief with a representation of a peak sanctuary, rising from a rocky landscape with altars and a sacred tree (Fig. 39). Two wild goats leap among Athens. the rocks and four more of these representatives of the deity sit at ease upon the roof. All the indications are that the palace, and likewise the houses, flourished for only a short period in LM I A and B, and that they were destroyed by earthquake and not sub- sequently disturbed. In the gorge to the west of the site, where early burials in caves were found by Hogarth, Platon excavated one cave containing five undisturbed burials of the EM II period. Notable among the contents were vases of Vasiliki type and a squat stone pyxis similar to that of green steatite from Mochlos, with a reclining dog on the lid for handle. A. H. S.
