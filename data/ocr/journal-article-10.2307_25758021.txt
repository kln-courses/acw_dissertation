A significant number of scholars, for example McLuhan, has already paid attention to this topic and tried to sketch the nature of the interaction between these 'shining' and 'enlightening' and human subjects. Usually screens are immediately associated with the eyes, with vision, with the supremacy of the visual. This, however, is a culturally biased, superficial and confined association, as not only McLuhan, but also a series of other scholars, film theorists and artists have attempted to demonstrate. The main goal of this article is to show that there is a lot more involved than sheer vision when watching screens or that is not only our eyes which are touched by what we seen on film, TV and PC screens, but our whole body. Our world has become a world of screens. For decades their predominant place was in film theatres, but since the invention of the TV and the PC they spread like wildfire. Today screens form part and parcel of the interiors of offices, hospitals and homes almost everywhere in the world. We are surrounded by and live with screens. We use them to remain informed about what is going on in the global village, to enter cyberspace and to express our ideas, for example when writing an essay or an article. Our relation with TV and PC screens has become almost as important as with fellow human beings, so it appears. Small wonder therefore that screens have become the object of study of many a scholar. The number of books and articles in which screens, especially film and video screens are dealt with from a variety of angles has become so vast, that it is impossible for one person to read and digest them all during a lifetime. And this, of course, enhances the possibility that what I try to bring forward in this piece already has been touched upon by others and possibly in a better and more convincing way. However, this disquieting sense is not strong enough to keep me from presenting a few observations, reflections and speculations regarding our relation with film, TV and PC screens and what they mean for and 'do' with us. Recently Slavoj Zizek launched a few interesting and above all intriguing questions with regard to screens, the cyberspace and the fate of the body. When floating in the cyberspace or in virtual reality, so he says, we experience not so much being bodiless, but 'possessing another - etheric, virtual, weightless - body, a body which does not confine ETNOFOOR, XV(l/2) 2002, pp. 21^6 21</page><page sequence="2">us to the inert materiality and finitude, an angelic spectral body which can be artificially recreated and manipulated' (2001:54). Yet, 'we should not totally forget our body' and 'maintain our anchoring in "real life", by returning, regularly, from our immersion in cyberspace to the intense experience of our body, from sex to jogging' (ibid.). However, so he continues, all this traveling in the cyberspace by means of PC screens not only means that we temporarily can lose our immediate material body', but also that we 'learn that there never was such a body', that 'our bodily self-experience was always-already that of an imaginary constituted entity' (ibid.:55). Though I find these statements captivating, I nevertheless cannot accept them, in particular not Zizek's idea regarding the loss of our immediate material body when visiting the cyberspace. In my view such a visit does not imply that the visitor experiences this loss, but, on the contrary, just experiences his material body in particular ways. Instead of emphasizing what many fans of trips into the cyberspace and Virtual Reality1 like to do, namely that it enables one, at least temporarily, to escape embodiment, I want to stress here that this completely overlooks the fact that such trips would be impossible without a material living body on the one hand, and specific material objects, especially screens, on the other. We should not be misled by what modern technology enables us to experience, that is, alleged disembodiment. In this essay I want to concentrate on the living material body in relation to screens as the means by which we are confronted with other 'real, Active or virtual worlds', on what happens to 'us' when 'seeing' or 'watching' these worlds on or through screens. No new topic, for a significant number of scholars, for example McLuhan, has already paid attention to it and tried to sketch the nature of the interaction between these 'shining' and 'enlightening' objects and human subjects. Usually screens are immediately associated with the eyes, with vision, with the supremacy of the visual. This, however, is a culturally biased, superficial and confined association, as not only McLuhan, but also a series of other scholars before and after him have tried to demonstrate. The main goal of this article is to show that there is a lot more involved than sheer vision when watching screens or that it is not only our eyes which are touched by what we see on film, TV and PC screens, but our whole body. In order to show this I will deal with the work of a number of scholars from different disciplines, who have argued that a rigid use of the Cartesian mind-body split and ocular-centrism are not of much help for developing a deeper insight in what screens, and what they show or reveal, mean in an emotional and cognitive sense. Some of these scholars emphatically state that a better understanding of their impact can only be reached if we perceive our relation with screens not in terms of a subject object relation, but of a subject 'subject' (or body to 'body') relationship. I think that paying attention to these issues can be relevant for anthropologists in general and for anthropologists with an interest in our relation with material culture (or the whole arsenal of materialized human thoughts) in particular. But before I start with my tour through works pertaining to these issues, I deem it important to sketch why I developed an interest in them in the first place. When the editors of Etnofoor launched the idea to publish a special issue on screens, I immediately realized that this would be a good opportunity to try to bring together a few themes - which have caught my attention already for a long time - in order to shed some 22</page><page sequence="3">light on the meaning of screens in our lives. Let me briefly outline them. Since I wrote the last sentence of my dissertation: 'The distinction between infrastructure and superstructure is as unusable as the one between body and mind' (1977:235), I have been thinking and writing on the necessity to bring the body back in or on the question how to take seriously the adagium: 'it is impossible to understand what goes on between human beings, if one does not pay attention to what goes on inside them at the same time' (cf., for example, Verrips 1980a, 1980b, 1983, 1988 and 1996). In the beginning it were anthropologists with an interest in proxemics (Hall 1959) and kinesics (Birdwhistell 1952) or non-verbal behavior and the biogenetic structuralists, especially Lex (1979), who inspired me very much. The latter tried to get rid of the Cartesian split and to tear down the walls between the disciplines built on it, for instance, by devoting attention to the influence of the (split) brain and autonomous nervous system on our ways of behaving in ritual contexts. In the early nineties I felt very much attracted by the work of anthropologists propagating the necessity of paying attention to the undeservedly neglected field of the 'varieties of sensory experience' (see Howes 1991). As already noted the functioning of the body in general and of the senses in particular seem to be directly involved when we consume what is presented to us on and through screens. However, I think that not only my interest in the body and the senses can be related to screens, but also this other field of interest of mine: the tendency to see and treat material objects as being endowed with a spirit, a will of their own, in short our habit to humanize and anthropomorphize things, especially extremely complex technical tools, for example, computers (see Verrips 1993). In the following I will therefore try to subsequently deal with the tendency to treat TVs and PCs not as simple objects but, for instance, as co operative or aggressive 'subjects' and, especially, how looking at screens (constituting these 'subjects') involves more than the eyes alone or how the whole body is involved in consuming what is shown on them. I When in the early nineties of the last century, I started to develop an interest in the ways in which we in the Western world perceived all kinds of material objects in our homes and offices not as simple objects, but very often as a kind of beings with a will of their own, and in the question how widespread were anthropomorphized representations of material culture, I thought that I was rather original. Now I know how wrong I was, for in these years a number of social scientists studied the same topic. Stewart Guthrie, for example, wrote an extensive study on anthropomorphic thinking and its relevance for a better understanding of the phenomenon of religion, in which he touched upon computers as special foci of personification (1993:127). Almost at the same time Deborah Lupton wrote a fascinating article on 'the embodied computer' in which she states to be interested in 'the "psychotopography" of the human/computer relationship, the ways that humans think, feel and experience their computers and interact with them as subjects' (1995:98; 23</page><page sequence="4">Okay, Du machst jetzt genau das, was ich sage! Figure 1 see also Lupton and Noble 1997). According to her this relationship is not 'a simple matter of self versus other', but implies 'a blurring of the boundaries between the embodied self and the PC (ibid.). Before people like Guthrie, Lupton and others, including myself, started writing about the tendency to turn objects into 'subjects', and more in particular about animistic and anthropomorphic representations of such complicated tools as TVs and PCs, photographers and cartoonists, ad- and filmmakers had already extensively dealt with the latter phenomenon. In such classical movies as 2001. A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick and Demon Seed by Donald Cammell, we are confronted with obstinate and, in the last instance, unamenable humanlike computers. In the cult film Videodrome by David Cronenberg we meet TV monitors who 'begin to throb like living, breathing flesh' (Shaviro 1993:121). However, photographs, cartoons and advertisements are a much richer source if one wants to illustrate anthropomorphic images of TVs and PCs. In general one can discern representations of these objects in which they figure without human features but are treated as if they were humans, on the one hand, and representations in which they appear as either big faces with hands and feet or just square heads on human bodies on the other. Let me give a few revealing examples which will lead me to the next topic of this essay, that is, the involvement of more sensorial experiences than the visual alone or, more broadly, of the whole body when watching screens and displays. Rather regularly one can come across cartoons of TVs and PCs, which apparently do not do what they are supposed to do and therefore are threatened by angry persons with pistols or revolvers (see figure 1). But images of TVs and PCs - either in human shape or as machines - pointing guns on their users or behaving ferociously are as frequent. So these 'things' are not only seen as targets for aggression by angry human beings, but also as 'subjects' threatening 24</page><page sequence="5">Figure 2 the people looking at them. But next to negative emotions, it is also positive emotions of persons towards humanized machines and vice versa which are represented, for instance mutual love.2 Particularly striking are the images of display monitors as terrible mouths that (threaten to) bite,3 eat and swallow their users. In this connection one can think of the Microsoft ad for Access 0.1, which shows a man whose head is disappearing in the screen of a PC (NRC HB 18 November 1992).4 Finally there are the representations of hitting fists, strangling arms and caressing hands coming out of PC screens (see figures 2 and 3).5 In these cases one is confronted with particular variations of tactility or manifestations of literally being touched by the displays of computers. The represented material object apparently does something to us or affects us. Though one might be inclined to think of these rather surrealistic and sometimes rather funny images of 'haptic screens' as pure products of the imagination lacking each and every empirical basis, I want to argue that they might not be as silly as they look. In my view they can be seen as a peculiar metaphoric representation of a specific phenomenon we tend to overlook or do not want to accept, because it is not yet scientifically proven that it really exists. But, as Joerges has remarked, '[m]etaphorisches Wissen geht oft empirischem voraus' (1996:31), by which he means that fantastic (folk) representations often are nothing less than a foreshadowing of more refined scientific knowledge (cf. Hufford 1982; Verrips 1989, 1992; McLenon 1994). The big issue, of course, is what exactly is going on between us and the screens we watch, of what nature this interaction between subject and object might be. A few years ago I wrote an essay on the popularity in Western societies of, for instance, films and videos replete with excessive sex and violence, in which I tried to make clear that there might be a direct relationship between their widespread consumption on the one hand and the imprisonment of the actual 'touch' in Western societies (that is, the strict taboo 25</page><page sequence="6">Figure 3 on touching others whom one wants to love or redress) on the other. By consuming these and similar products, so I reasoned, one remains in con-tact with an essential dimension of the self (the need to touch either to love or to protect, if necessary by destroying a threatening other) which for social reasons is not allowed in its rude, uncultivated form, but which cannot be denied or abolished. Though I stated in the aforementioned essay that I perceived the touch as the most fundamental of all our senses, because the four others can be reduced to it or are in the last instance nothing else but variations of the touch or tactile processes,6 I did not develop the fundamental idea there, at least not clearly, that looking at films on screens in itself is not merely a visual but above all a tactile process, a process in which our total body is involved and not only our eyes, let alone our mind. In a sense I then missed the chance to support my views on retrieving the incarcerated touch via mimetic means and the fundamental character of the touch or the tactile nature of all our sensorial experiences by relating them to the work of scholars, such as Marshall McLuhan, who long before I touched the topic wrote about the tactile nature of looking at moving images on screens. Sometimes the existence of boundaries between disciplines functions as an enormous obstacle to a less repetitive and more fertile exploration of fascinating fields of interest.7 In the next section I will try to sketch a number of visions on what happens with us when we consume (audio) visual products in movie theaters or via our TV and/or PC. Though what reaches us in these ways nowadays almost always consists of a combination of moving images and sounds,8 many approaches display a profoundly visual bias. In other words, when talking about watching moving images on screens, the fact that they are accompanied by sound is often automatically assumed and not explicitly mentioned. This biased inclination pinpoints the existence of ocular-centrism, which has very old roots in the Western world, as for instance Synnott has shown (1991, 1993).9 I notice this before 26</page><page sequence="7">starting with my next section in order to avoid the accusation that I also overlook the importance of sound when people 'devour' moving images on screens. II When TV became popular at the end of the fifties several people in the village in which I was born talked about the TV screen as 'the eye'. Through this 'third eye' they saw what was going on elsewhere in the world and got an amazing amount of new information and knowledge about it. However, not everybody was happy with this flickering new 'window' on the world outside the community. Many a person, and not only orthodox Calvinists, feared that its influence would drastically undermine familiar norms and values as well as old forms of knowledge. If one watched for too long, so it was said, one, especially children, would end up with 'square eyes' (cf. Valkenburg 1997). So there immediately was this idea that what was shown on TV screens might have an unsettling and disorienting influence on people, reason enough for some to vehemently refuse to bring this 'machine of the devil' into their houses, for 'this eye' would spoil each and everything, especially an individual's mind. Though one spoke of a physical transformation of the shape of the eyes - they would become 'square' - , one nevertheless emphasized how a person would mentally change in a morally wrong direction, if he or she watched too much TV. In accordance with the in the Western world widely accepted Cartesian split, the influence of the TV was not sought in how the images and sounds this new medium offered to the eyes and the ears in the last instance affected the body, but, on the contrary, the spirit or the mind. So concerning the possible effects of the TV, my villagers, just like so many scientists, cherished an ocular-centric and - in its wake - a mentalistic and rather rationalistic vision or perspective. That one saw and learnt a lot through TV was not so much contested, but one disagreed about where all this might lead to. In the nineties of the last century a great number of studies has been published in which predominantly Anglo-Saxon scholars active in a wide range of disciplines have launched attacks on the great emphasis placed on the eyes as the only or the most important instruments through which we gather knowledge with regard to the world we live in.10 Completely in line with this, many maintain that people who use screens as intermediary media to get informed, collect knowledge or to be entertained do not relate to these screens with their eyes or more abstractly: their minds alone, but that their other senses are also involved. In anthropology it has been above all David Howes who formulated a kind of programmatic perspective to bring the senses back in The Varieties of Sensory Experience. A Sourcebook in the Anthropology of the Senses (1991). In the meantime a small group of anthropologists has come into existence propagating the need to systematically pay attention to the role of the senses in human interaction and the ways in which they play an important role in, for example, processes of in- and exclusion (cf. Synnott 1993; Classen 1993). A truly original effort to put the senses on the map again was undertaken by Michael Taussig in his book Mimesis and Alterity. A Particular History of the Senses, in which he - very much inspired by Walter 27</page><page sequence="8">Benjamin - speaks of the eyeball as 'an extension of the moving, sensate body' and the necessity 'to ask ourselves why vision is so privileged, ideologically, while other sensory modalities are, in Euroamerican cultures at least, so linguistically impoverished yet actually so crucial to human being and social life', for instance, 'tactility and tactile knowing, and ... the great underground of knowledges locked therein' (1993:26). However, Taussig just touches upon this very intriguing topic, but does not work it out. This is regrettable as much more could have been said about the eyeball and tactility in relation to screens and gaining knowledge. Though anthropologists recently have done a lot to criticize the visualist bias in their discipline (cf. Fabian 1983; Classen 1998) and started to study, for instance, culturally different 'sensotypes' and the relevance of the body in interaction, it is impossible to stay within the boundaries of one discipline, if one wants to reach deeper. As I already remarked, a series of interesting approaches of vision, in general, and of what happens with people when they watch moving images on screens, in particular, have recently been developed by scholars active in a number of disciplines, for example, film studies, philosophy, cultural studies, communications, English, drama, media studies, and sociology. Before I will address a few of the most spectacular and thought-provoking of these recent approaches, I want to go back in the past. For it turns out that the flood of studies in the nineties in which the hegemony of vision is undermined, form part of what one could call a tradition in which a less one sided, visualist and mentalist position is propagated. The founding fathers of this tradition were persons who already in an early stage of the cinema started to think about what this new medium meant and/or did to people. An interesting person in this respect is the French film director and film theoretician of Polish origin Jean Epstein (1897-1953). I learned about him and his ideas with regard to cinema through the fascinating article by Malcolm Turvey: Jean Epstein's Cinema of Immanence: The Rehabilitation of the Corporeal Eye (1998). In this article Turvey shows that Epstein (1897-1953), in spite of the fact that he wrote in 1921 that 'the cinema creates a particular system of consciousness limited to a single sense' (Epstein in Turvey 1998:25), that is sight, took very seriously its 'corporeal effects on the spectator'. That Turvey takes great efforts to demonstrate this, stems from his idea that it would be wrong to dismiss Epstein's film theory because of its emphasis on cinema and sight and his statement that sight is the most developed of the senses, as a kind of outmoded and therefore irrelevant Cartesian type of theory. According to Turvey it would, however, be wide off the mark to consider Epstein as an adept of a Cartesian model of vision, which, on the one hand, implies that 'physical, corporeal vision, along with sensory perception in general, is rejected as an inadequate ground for certain knowledge and truth', and, on the other, nevertheless the employment of 'ocular metaphors for the mind' (ibid. :28) perceived to be the real cognitive instrument. Epstein put great emphasis on how the film camera (just like the telescope and microscope) augments visual perception and in so doing becomes an important cognitive tool improving 'the spectator's sensory knowledge of the world' (ibid.:29), reason why one might think that his theory represents 'an instantiation of an outmoded... "Cartesian scopic regime"' (ibid.:32).n Yet Epstein also paid attention to how the mobility of the 28</page><page sequence="9">camera led to effects 'unambiguously located in the corporeal density of the spectator's body' (ibid.:34).12 According to Turvey, Epstein does not deal with a disembodied 'eye-subject' transcending 'the laws of matter and time'. Throughout Epstein's writings, the strong, overwhelming physical nature of... sensations ... is a central component of his prototypical spectator's perceptual experience of the cinema. He often equates, for example, the intense pleasures of this experience with bodily penetration and need, comparing the affect... of close-ups with 'needles', and the 'extremely pleasant intellectual state' attained during viewing with 'a sort of need, like tobacco or coffee'. Such a striking characterization of spectatorship, with its emphasis on physical need, stimulation, and, more generally, the state of being acted on by physical forces unleashed by camera mobility, pulling and pushing the body as 'projectile', is diametrically opposite to the disembodied transcendence of the physical world and body that is the central figure of Jay's 'Cartesian scopic regime' (ibid.:34). How important 'bodily contact', 'ingestion', 'sensuous proximity' and 'corporeal inti macy' are in Epstein's vision of the consumption of moving images on screens speaks, according to Turvey, clearly from passages in his work such as this one: The close-up modifies the drama by the impact of proximity. Pain is within reach. If I stretch out my arm I touch you, and that is intimacy. I can count the eyelashes of this suffering. I would be able to taste the tears. Never before has a face turned to mine in that way. Ever closer it presses against me, and I follow it face to face. It's not even true that there is air between us; I consume it. It is in me like a sacrament. Maximum visual acuity (Epstein in Turvey 1998:35). But Epstein not only valorizes 'the cinema's ability to induce corporeal intimacy with the world' (ibid.:34), he also claims that what is recorded by cameras and shown on cinema screens plays an important role in revealing to the viewer the 'soul' or 'the interior life' of people and things (ibid.:38), reason why he calls the cinema 'animistic'. The camera, as a strange magical tool, makes the immaterial visible and brings it to life. Turvey illustrates this claim by referring to what Epstein once wrote about the close-up of a revolver, namely that '[I]t has temperament, habits, memories, a will, a soul' (Epstein in Turvey 1998:40). When I read this, I immediately had to think of the revolver coming out of the TV screen in Cronenberg's Videodrome. Important in this connection is that Epstein, according to Turvey, was of the opinion that certain 'immaterial' phenomena (for example, time, emotions and family resemblance), got 'a sensuous, palpable incarnation within the people, objects, and events depicted by the cinematic image' or got 'embodied' so that they could be observed, experienced and become known with the corporeal eye (Turvey 1998:42). If one combines this with Epstein's notion of the 'sensuous proximity' and 'corporeal intimacy' that watching films may imply one has to conclude that this is a rather early example of a materialist theory. Not merely the visual plays an important role in, for instance, gaining knowledge of the world, but - in the last instance - the viewer's whole body. According to Turvey, there is a striking resemblance between Epstein's ideas on how seemingly immaterial sides of humans and objects, because they got a specific incarnation in cinematic images, could be seen, recognized and even experienced as alive, and Wittgenstein's ideas on 'aspect-dawning', occurring when people look at a picture-puzzle 29</page><page sequence="10">(for instance, the duck-rabbit) or simply a picture of a smiling woman on the wall. Both scholars employed 'the language of "animism" to articulate precisely the type of visual experience' (ibid.:45) of respectively cinematic images and pictures. And both developed a non-Cartesian perspective on 'the visual experience of aspect-dawning', because for them seeing an aspect was 'a sensuous, physical experience', not a matter of the abstract mind's eye but of the concrete corporeal eye of the beholder (ibid.:48). Turvey's piece on Epstein and Wittgenstein brings home that recent efforts to get rid of Cartesian approaches of watching moving images on screens and replacing them by others in which not only the sensorial experience of seeing but also the other senses and the body play a role in getting sensations and gaining knowledge of the world, have rather old roots. The observation that watching films implies a continuous touch of the corporeal eye and by extension of the whole body returns, albeit in a different shape, in the famous essay by Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technische Reproduzierbarkeit (The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, originally published in 1936). The same holds true for the observation that people through this continuous tactile experience get to know about a range of aspects of things and people that, though they exist, were nevertheless not seen. In Benjamin's classical piece tactility, as a crucial sensorial experience in grasping the meaning of diverse art forms such as painting, architecture and film, plays an important role. Let me briefly address those aspects of Benjamin's essay that I deem particularly relevant in this context.13 In the first place, I was struck by his comparison of the film maker (or camera man) and the painter with respectively the surgeon and the magician, who each in their own way can touch the body of a patient in order to heal (1977:158). When the magician touches his patient he reduces the distance between them by the imposition of his hand and at the same time increases it enormously by virtue of his authority, whereas the surgeon works the other way around, for he radically decreases the distance and only slightly enlarges it by the care with which his hand moves between the organs of his patient. Contrary to the magician, the surgeon penetrates the body of his patient. By this revealing comparison Benjamin wants to make clear that a painter keeps a natural distance to what he wants to paint and ultimately comes up with a total image, whereas a filmmaker, by deeply penetrating into the body or - more generally - the fabric of the circumstances, ends up with a series of broken images, which 'hit' and 'shock' people going to the movies.14 This brings me to my second point: the tactile quality of film. At a certain point Benjamin states that the fact that the Dadaists turned the art work into what he calls a 'Geschoss' or projectile, which hit the people who looked at it, furthered the need to see films 'dessen ablenkendes Element ebenfalls in erster Linie ein taktiles ist, namlich auf dem Wechsel der Schauplatze und Einstellungen beruht, welche stossweise auf den Beschauer eindringen' (ibid.: 164; italics JV).15 When watching a film, the beholder cannot contemplate as he can do in front of a painting, no: Vor der Filmaufnahme kann er das nicht. Kaum hat er sie ins Auge gefasst, so hat sie sich schon verandert. Sie kann nicht fixiert werden. (...). Darauf beruht die Chockwirkung des Films, die wie jede Chockwirkung durch gesteigerte Geistesgegenwart aufgegangen sein will. Kraft seiner 30</page><page sequence="11">technischen Struktur hat der Film die physische Chockwirkung, welche der Dadaismus gleichsam in der moralischen noch verpackt hielt, aus dieser Emballage befreit' (ibid.: 164?165, italics in original, underline JV). In order to illustrate the importance of a tactile next to an optical reception or observation, Benjamin uses the example of buildings that are not in the first place appropriated by vision and contemplation but by tactility and habituation. 'Die taktile Rezeption erfolgt nicht sowohl auf dem Wege der Aufmerksamkeit als auf dem der Gewohnheit. Der Architektur gegenuber bestimmt diese letztere weitgehend sogar die optische Rezeption' (ibid.: 166). Though Benjamin could have been more explicit about what he exactly meant by tactility and habituation, he made perfectly clear - at least to me - that consuming moving images on screens is not only a matter of the (mind's) eye, but above all of being physically shocked by them.16 Finally Benjamin, just like Epstein (and Wittgenstein), emphasizes the revealing and informative nature of watching films, for they (in the same way as psycho-analysis) bring to the surface aspects of people and things which hitherto went unnoticed and formed part of the 'the optical unconscious' (ibid.:37). In the next section I will return to this cognitive function of what is shown on screens. Much more could be said about how early film theorists said something about the fact that watching movies was far from a purely visual experience alone, but that it also was a haptic or tactile affair involving the physical body of the beholder.17 However, as the point is clear, I would like to leave it at this and continue now with a sketch of the ways in which tactility and the touch continued to crop up in the work of scholars who studied television and later the PC. In the cases of these new machines, the screen remained but changed its character. Whereas formerly moving images were projected on the silver screen from which they rebounded on the beholders, this time these images in a sense were directly projected on them through the display monitor. Ill It was Marshal McLuhan who in his thought-provoking book Understanding Media (1966) presented a series of intriguing ideas with regard to the TV and the ways in which this new medium introduced what he calls a 'sensuous revolution', because TV images exerted 'a unifying synesthetic force on the sense life of... intensely literate populations' (ibid:315). In his vision it was not film, which he calls 'cool' and only demands a low degree of audience involvement, but the 'hot' medium TV that led to the rapid decrease of the fragmentation of our sensory life.18 For McLuhan the TV was 'a massive extension of our central nervous systems' enveloping 'Western man in a daily session of synesthesia' (ibid.). So the TV in a sense brought something back which due to the emphasis on literacy disappeared into the background. In a striking passage strongly reminiscent of Benjamin's military metaphor of the projectile for the work of the Dadaists and the film, McLuhan in a poetical way refers to the TV as a kind of 'canon' hitting the TV viewer19 31</page><page sequence="12">in a penetrating and revealing or enlightening manner: 'With TV, the viewer is the screen. He is bombarded with light impulses that James Joyce called the "Charge of the Light Brigade" that imbues his "soulskin with sobconscious inklings'" (ibid.:313).20 Whereas the invention of photography and the radio according to McLuhan led to an extension of respectively the visual and aural sensory experience, the TV 'is, above all, an extension of the sense of touch, which involves maximal interplay of all the senses' (ibid.:333). If one reads his expose on the TV, one is struck by the many passages in which he tries to bring this point home. In the end his hammering on the fact that TV 'is not so much a visual as a tactual-auditory medium that involves all of our senses in depth interplay' (ibid.:336) starts to sound like a soporific magical formula. Against this background, the last two sentences of his piece on TV sound a bit odd: 'It [the TV medium, JV] involves us in moving depth, but it does not excite, agitate or arouse. Presumably, this is a feature of all in depth experience' (ibid:337). However, what he means here is that watching TV can really hit or shock us - in a Benjaminian (physical) sense I would say - without leading to hot-headed behavior of sorts. I think that McLuhan's very outspoken emphasis on the significance of the touch when watching TV is very relevant. He must have said once: 'the medium is the massage' (De Kerckhove 1966:14). However, instead of sharply contrasting this type of watching with the consumption of movies, it would have been better if he had seen both as variations on a theme, for in the latter case the touch or tactility also plays an important role. Apart from this I think that is it is McLuhan's great merit that, by paying attention to such a new medium as the TV, he forces us to rethink and revise our fivefold sensorial classification with the sense of vision at the top and the touch at the bottom of the hierarchy.21 In a sense he not only reverses this hierarchy in case of TV watching, but he also seems to go in the direction of understanding the sensorial experiences of vision, hearing, taste and smell as specific instances of touching or tactility in a physical sense, which I think is crucial for developing deeper insights in what happens when we are confronted with 'moving things or processes', for example, in our environment or on screens of sorts.22 Though McLuhan has been severely criticized for his rather radical ideas with regard to the new media (cf. Miller 1973), his work had a tremendous influence on a host of scholars who studied the meaning and influence of the rapid advance of TV and PC screens in the global village. A scientist who worked along the lines set out by McLuhan is Derrick de Kerckhove, who advocates the idea (in his book with the telling title The Skin of Our Culture) that the TV talks with the body and not with the mind, that this medium directly influences the nervous system and calls forth 'submuscularization' of the whole body.23 According to him watching TV implies that we as viewers are scanned by this medium, that it 'watches us instead of we watching the TV (1966:7-12).24 In the same vein as McLuhan, De Kerckhove emphasizes the tactility of the medium. The fact that some Virtual Reality (VR) researchers are now concentrating on the development of convincing simulations of the touch is no coincidence, for according to him the touch forms the basis of our reality and a fundamental condition for understanding.25 If one thinks, for instance, that 3-D is something visual in the first place, one makes a mistake, for it is rather something 32</page><page sequence="13">tactile. A VR walk implies contact of the whole body with the environment in the same way as one is enclosed by water in a swimming pool. The fact that already since a few decades there are attempts to get rid of our shyness with regard to the touch and touching and even to develop an electro-tactile technology, has according De Kerckhove directly been set in motion by the spread of the TV, because this medium gave rise to a desire to bring the underestimated body back in (ibid.:37-38). Although I think that this view needs to be modified, when one takes into consideration that film triggered and still triggers a similar kind of desire, I nevertheless find this view relevant and important, for it once again underlines the necessity to reconsider the idealist emphasis on (the mind's) eye and the neglect of the body for a better comprehension of our relation with the material world (for example, with screens) we live in. In the same decade as De Kerckhove wrote his book, a whole series of other scholars published works in which they dealt with (the history of) vision and visuality in general and with watching moving images on screens in film theaters and the screens of TVs and PCs in particular (cf., for instance, Sobchack 1992; Crary 1992; Jay 1993; Buck-Morss 1994; Denzin 1995; Burnett 1995; Jenks 1995; Schneider 1997; Heywood and Sandywell 1999; Williams 1999; Moore 2000; Grimshaw 2001). In many of these works the tactile nature of vision and the role of the body in perceiving the world are touched upon. Crary, for instance, shows how in the nineteenth century 'the sense of touch [which] had been an integral part of classical theories of vision in the seventeenth and eighteenth century' got dissociated from sight 'within a pervasive "separation of the senses" and industrial remapping of the body' (1992:19). The loss of touch as a conceptual component of vision meant the unloosening of the eye from the network of referentiality incarnated in tactility and its subjective relation to perceived space. This autonomization of sight, occurring in many different domains, was a historical condition for the rebuilding of an observer fitted for the tasks of 'spectacular' consumption (ibid.). What Crary tries to outline is the coming into existence of a denial of sensuous contact between beholder and objects in the interest of consumption. I see a direct link here with what Rebecca Schneider has remarked a few years later about the fundamental significance of the disavowal of 'explicit and ready tactility between viewer and viewed' for capitalism: The separation between viewer and viewed institutes an insatiable desire across the divide by which the viewer has the desire, the product is the desired. Sensuous complicity, literal and immediate contact between seer and seen as always already operative must be disavowed to service the status of 'desire for contact' which keeps commodities circulating. Tactility is deployed and simultaneously secret(e)d, becoming an optical 'unconscious' as we are consciously habituated to a seemingly a-sensuous dislocation between viewer and viewed (1997:89). We are confronted here with a very intriguing political economical side to the extolment of 'pure' vision on the one hand and the denial of the tactile nature of sight on the other in the interest of a smooth exchange of commodities. Instead of elaborating this highly intriguing issue, I want to continue with a brief discussion of the work of Vivian Sobchack and Linda Williams in which screens and 33</page><page sequence="14">the touch figure prominently. Sobchack has developed a fascinating phenomenological perspective on our comprehensive relation to screens that is exactly the type of perspective I think we need to achieve progress in understanding this relation. She got her inspiration from Merleau-Ponty's existential phenomenology, which as she says 'stresses the embodied nature of human consciousness and views bodily existence as the original and originating material premise of sense and signification'. Contrary to scholars as McLuhan and De Kerckhove, Sobchack seems to make no distinction between how we relate to or are affected by film on the one hand, and screens of TVs and other display monitors on the other. 'We sit in a movie theater, before a television set or in front of a computer terminal not only as conscious beings but also as carnal beings. Our vision is not abstracted from our bodies or from our other modes of perceptual access to the world. Nor does what we see merely touch the surface of our eyes'.26 No, our whole body is touched by what we see, even if what we see is a no-body, as so often happens in modern products of the imagination. In this connection I want to emphasize that the play with the disappearance of the body in all kinds of SF (video) films and -games, as well as the fact that in modern hospitals the concrete body of patients appears to be less relevant than its representation on different types of screens (cf. Frank 1992:82-83; Lammer, this volume) does not at all mean that the lived body is becoming less and less important, on the contrary. Exactly the existence of all these screens in hospitals point to the great value attached to a proper treatment of ailing bodies, so that their existence will be prolonged. When glancing through the recent literature on our 'moving-image culture' and how 'we live cinematic and electronic lives', to borrow a few telling expressions of Sobchack, I was struck by the fact that her work is very enthusiastically referred to by female scholars (cf, for example, Marks 1998 and Del Rio 2000). In general it seems that women pay more attention to the touch and tactility in connection with our large-scale consumption of moving images on screens (see Synnott 1993:220). What I have read about it in the works of men is often less detailed and less impressive. But, of course, there are exceptions, for example, Ron Burnett who states that we need to look very carefully at the implications of an approach of the new media in which the body devolves into the eye, sight rebounds against itself and viewers loose their senses of touch, smell and hearing (1995:5). A female scholar who felt greatly inspired by Sobchack is Linda Williams, who in the late eighties published a thorough study on pornographic film. For the new edition she wrote a really interesting epilogue in which she tries to develop a deeper insight in 'the nature of pornography's solicitation of the bodies of its viewers' (1999:xiii). In this piece she is very explicit in her appreciation of Sobchack's idea that we (can) have generalized sensual experiences that cannot be reduced to sight alone when watching films. The following quote can illustrate what Williams finds so valuable in Sobchack's approach: The perception of a moving image of an object (or body) that is not literally there to be touched, gives rise to an attraction towards - a solicitation by - the mediated object or body. This solicitation is an attraction of not just of the eyes but the flesh. Indeed, our entire sensorium is activated in a synaesthetic manner with one bodily sense translating into another. Sight ... commutes to touch. We do not touch the flesh that appears on the screen but our senses 'make 34</page><page sequence="15">sense' of the vision of touch in our own flesh. It is in this sense that we can say we are 'touched' or 'moved' by the virtual bodies on the screen (1999:290). This is exactly what I once tried to formulate in my piece The Consumption of "Touching Images'" (Verrips 1996). However, what I failed to do in my article and what Linda Williams also neglected in her new epilogue is to refer to the work of clinical psychologists who studied, often in laboratory situations, the physiological effects the watching of erotic films has on both men and women. Ellen Laan, for instance, found that contrary to the popular belief holding that women are not sexually aroused by explicitly sexual, visual stimuli, that 'explicit erotic film reliably produces genital and subjective arousal in women' (1994:154).27 In this context the idea of Susan Buck-Morss that the surface of the cinema screen functions as a prosthetic organ of the senses or an artificial organ of cognition, which she considers to be both physical as well as intellectual, is also pertinent. Watching films implies according to her a sensual shock, which is characterized by the fact that 'the nervous system is subject to a double, and seemingly paradoxical modification: On the one hand there is an extreme heightening of the senses, a hypersensitivity of nervous stimulation. On the other, there is a dulling of sensation, a numbing of the nervous system that is tantamount to corporeal anaesthetization' (1994:55). Though the beholders are bombarded 'by physical and psychic shock' they remain passive, because 'the continuum between cognition and action is snapped' (ibid.:57). This reminds us of what McLuhan said earlier about the TV involving viewers in moving depth, without leading them to excited and agitated behavior. What he and Buck-Morss describe shows, by the way, a strong family resemblance with altered states of consciousness which might result, when the two subsystems of the autonomous nervous system (that is, the ergotropic and trophotropic system) are sensitized or 'tuned' at the same time (cf. Lex 1979:137). Though the body is dealt with by Buck-Morss, she does not explicitly speak about the touch or tactility, but both are clearly implied in her piece, for instance, when she uses of particular words (like 'sensual shock') and because of her reference to Benjamin's comparison between cameraman-painter and surgeon-magician (Buck-Morss 1994:56). IV That the touch is a very important cognitive tool, says De Kerckhove, has already for a long time been acknowledged by artists, but instead of naming a few of them he continues with his scientific expose. At another occasion I have outlined that it can be rewarding for anthropologists to pay attention to what, for example, novelists and filmmakers have produced with regard to certain topics (cf. Verrips 2001). Such artists can not only help the former to revive their interest in neglected or even forgotten, yet crucial dimensions of particular phenomena, but also to support (or confirm) specific perspectives on the basis of their work and to develop new and rewarding approaches of classical issues, such as 35</page><page sequence="16">the relation between screens, the senses and the body. For many anthropologists this type of border crossing in order to remember, to find confirmation or new inspiration is not yet routine,28 but I would like to make a plea for having some guts in this respect, for, as I hope to show with this piece, it will turn out to be a fruitful excursion. In this connection De Kerckhove could have mentioned Cronenberg, whose famous cult film Videodrome (1982) literally, albeit in an exaggerated way, shows what McLuhan (and in a certain sense also De Kerckhove himself) writes about how TV touches and enervates us.29 Shaviro succinctly formulates the nature of this exaggeration: The videodrome project... marks the end of the primacy traditionally accorded to representation. As vision is technologically rationalized and turned back upon the body, its physiological effects take priority alike over the ideological forms of representation and over the contents being represented. The function of vision is no longer to show, but directly to excite, the nerves. Sight is not a neutral source of information, but a gaping wound, a violation of the integrity of the body (1993:123). In Cronenberg's film touching the screen as if it was a living 'subject' and being touched (even swallowed) by it, as well as the transformation of a subject into a screen all play a prominent role in a manner that does not leave the viewer undisturbed, in its turn proof of what the movie tries to show.30 Another artist who is interesting in this context is the Austrian Valie Export, who in 1968 shocked large audiences in Western Europe with her performance project Tapp und Tast Kino. 'With a simple box buckled to her naked chest, she went out into the street in several cities and invited people to "visit the cinema" for five minutes. A woman's body became the screen, the film, which could not be seen but was instead expanded to include another aspect of perception, the sense of touch'.31 In the box were two holes through which passersby could lay their hands on the bare breast of Export. The text she wrote with regard to her performance started in this revealing and striking way: The screening takes place in the dark as usual: except that the movie room has shrunk a little. It only has room for two hands. In order to see the film, which in this case means to sense and feel it, the 'spectator' (consumer) has to put both hands through the entrance to the movie house. The curtain, hitherto raised only for the eyes, is now, at long last, raised for the hands as well (ibid.). Although Export wanted to make clear by this project that women were turned into objects in the movies (Cornwell 1992:207), she at the same time illustrated McLuhannesque themes of the body becoming a screen and the relevance of being touched in front of or by (TV) screens. With a dazzling act she brought home how complex our relation to moving images (of bodies) on screens is; that it is not simply a matter of the eye seeing something moving and the mind digesting it, but a much more encompassing tactile experience which involves also the rest of the physical body next to the eye. In this connection it should be mentioned that Export was not the only artist who staged performances that challenged current approaches of looking, watching, viewing, gazing, et cetera, by using the naked body. As a matter of fact, a whole series of artists, especially women, has been active in this respect from the sixties onwards. A famous example is, for example, Carolee 36</page><page sequence="17">Schneemann with her project Eye/Body (1963) in which she used her body not only as ' "visual territory" as if to declare: If I am a token, then I'll be a token to reckon with', but also to suggest4a complex theoretical terrain of perspectival vision on the flip', for 'Eye/ body suggested embodied vision, a bodily eye - sighted eyes - artist's eyes - not only in the seer, but in the body of the seen' (Schneider1997:35). Another example is Annie Sprinkle, who staged the performance Post Porn Modernism in which she invited people to have a look at her cervix by shining a flashlight through a speculum she had inserted into her vagina. Schneider, who extensively describes and analyses this very specific visual project on the basis of herself being one of the spectators, refers to her very strong feeling that Sprinkle's cervix was an eye itself looking back. This reminded her of 'Benjamin's efforts to "invest" an object or the objectified with its own gaze, as if it might not already possess such capabilities of its own' (ibid.:56). In this case it is not the screen watching us, but a specific part of the body. What I deem important here is the representation of other parts of the body than the eyes as 'eyes', for this phenomenon, which is rather old and widespread (cf. Dundes 1992:280 ff.), points to the 'fact' that 'seeing' and in its wake understanding is not a matter of the eyeballs and the mind's eye alone, but of the whole body.32 A fine illustration of this occurs in Valie Exort's film The Practice of Love (1984) that invites us to look at it 'through our sense of touch' as Elena del Rio remarks. The bodies in this film 'are not blindly and inertly submitting to the viewer's gaze, for they are shown to possess their own vision. As the superimposition of a gigantic eye slanted across a female torso indicates, theirs is a vision capable of looking back at us and, moreover, not rigidly localized but dispersed across the body's entire sensitive surface' (Del Rio 200:53). So apart from using performances in order to question common notions of seeing and the priority of the sense of vision above the other senses in the process of knowing, such artists as Export and Schneemann, as well as a host of others, have also done this in and with video-films. Laura Marks recently dealt with this 'genre', which 'appeals to a tactile, or haptic, visuality' (1998:332). She distinguishes this type of perception from optical visuality. Haptic perception is ... defined as the combination of tactile, kinaesthetic, and proprioceptive functions, the way we experience touch both on the surface of and inside our bodies. In haptic visuality, the eyes themselves function like organs of touch. Haptic visuality ... draws from other forms of sense experience, primarily touch and kinaesthetics. (...) Touch is a sense located on the surface of the body: thinking of cinema as haptic is only a step towards considering the ways in which cinema appeals to the body as a whole (Marks 1998:332). The relationship between viewer and screen in the case of haptic visuality is a relationship of the viewer with another skin or another body, reason why it can become erotic (ibid.:333), for one not only touches this screen-skin or screen-body with one's own eye/body, but the touched also reaches back with a caress (ibid.:341) as if it belongs to or is a 'subject'.33 Though I find Marks' piece very enlightening I disagree with her when she wants to limit the haptic visuality to a particular genre of artistic videofilms only. As must be clear by now, I think that this is always more or less involved when we watch moving images on screens. We are totally caught by these images, not just by a tiny little 37</page><page sequence="18">bit of our corporeal surface, I mean our eyes. They move, hit, and shock us and in doing so they inform and teach us, each and every time we consume, digest or embody them. Each and every time, for I think that there is no fundamental (at best gradual) difference in this respect between irregular and addicted watching. Screens help us at a deep corporeal level to grasp aspects of the world we live in, aspects that were not yet visible or graspable because they were hidden in time and space.34 We express ourselves in and on screens, and screens express themselves on and in us. On screens not only the outsides but also the insides of people and things are brought to the surface in an enlightening and penetrating, though sometimes frightening and disorienting manner.35 V As I have shown in the foregoing pages there exists a category of scholars with different backgrounds as well as artists who - contrary to what Zizek seems to claim with regard to the temporary loss of 4our immediate material body' on travels in the cyberspace - each in their own way emphasize the great relevance of the material body in our adventurous and informative meeting with moving images on screens. These scholars and artists have tried to make clear how 'screenic' images in a certain sense come to life, reach out, hit and shock us not only in the eyes but our whole body or how the 'movies' move us. In this connection I want to point out a number of important things. Right now we live in an era in which the classical dream of telepresence seems to come true due to the rapid technological progress achieved in the sphere of telecommunications and VR.36 Because of the fact that one can experience the presence of somebody via screens who is not actually there but elsewhere in (time and) space more and more people think that the body becomes less and less important. In my view, however, this is just wishful thinking. The fact that scientists are working very hard to improve, for example, the tele-communicated images of persons (as well as of things) in such a way that one can get more and more the impression that these images are no images of persons any longer but instead 'real' persons able to use all their 'senses' and to 'hit' or 'caress' us points to a deep-seated desire for the nearness of an immediate material body. In our times nothing seems to be as important as the body.37 If one really wanted to get rid of the physical body, then it would be logical if less time and energy were spent on the creation of virtual copies almost indistinguishable from real bodies. Against the background of the recent developments one might say that the moving images on the silver screen first and on TV and PC screens later are a kind of adumbrations of what is still to come: moving images of persons and things on more sophisticated screens who with still more reason than up till now are experienced as both graspable and touching. Theorists of the type I have dealt with might in the near future be praised for the fact that they were on the right, materialist track with their emphasis on the significance of the corporeal eye, the embodied view or tactility in our meeting with 'screenic' persons, things and events. For a materialist track it is, because it tries to take seriously our physical experiences in consuming moving images on screens and 38</page><page sequence="19">especially the sensorial experience of the touch, which not only plays a basic role in the mastering and understanding of our social and natural environment, but also can be seen as the master sense because all the others senses can be perceived as variations of the touch. In the last chapter of her thought-provoking book The Color of Angels Constance Classen (1998) makes this perfectly clear when she sketches how Laura Bridgeman and Helen Keller, both blind-deaf, learned to develop a full range of ideas and emotions through the touch. The problem in this connection, however, is that this idea of the touch as the master sense has not yet led to a revision of our sensorial classification system and terminology, which makes it not easy to write in such a way that confusion is avoided.38 As long as we stick to this system and terminology and as long as vision in the Cartesian tradition will call forward associations with an immaterial mind's eye) instead of with a specific kind of physical touch, it will not be easy to develop crystal clear materialist approaches of what is at stake when people digest moving images on screens. All the authors and artists I dealt with were and still are in a sense involved in a struggle with an old and deeply rooted, idealist, Cartesian type discourse which they want to replace by a new one in which the material body matters more in spite of the fact that it now seems to quickly evaporate in VR and cyberspace. Another point I want to very briefly deal with in this conclusion concerns the difficult and complex issue of cognition or how we apprehend moving images on screens touching us. I think that they tune our body, more in particular our brain, amongst other things via the process Wittgenstein called aspect dawning. This is an instructive process, which helps increase our knowledge of the world we live in and how to behave in it. The fear of so many people that we will be spoilt and corrupted by a lot of what reaches us via screens can be tempered by the observation that being touched by it does absolutely not imply that people will be so excited, agitated or aroused, to use McLuhan's words, that they will start with making a mess. The massage of the media turns out to be much more conservative, as well as banal, than often claimed (Verrips 2001). Finally I think that it would enrich the work of anthropologists, if they paid more attention to the fact that the relations of human beings with their fellow human beings, other animals as well as things, such as screens, always imply tactility. Though we westerners have learned to think that there are only five different senses with sight at the top and the touch at the bottom, because the former is associated with the mind and the latter with the body, we should do everything to get rid of this fivefold, Judea-Christian and Cartesian type of hierarchical classification. It blinds us for the fact that we relate to the world through the touch of the cornea of our eyes, of the tympanum in our ears, of the receptors in the mucous membrane of our nose, of the papillae on our tongue, of the sensors in our skin and/or of our whole body. Instead of an anthropology of the senses, we need an anthropology of the touch and how people have learnt to fragment this basic human experience in such a way, that it, for instance, hampers our understanding of our relation to screens.

I borrowed the designation 'haptic screens' from Marks (1998) and the designation 'corporeal eye' from Turvey (1998). 1. See for illuminating definitions of cyberspace and virtual reality Featherstone and Burrows (1995:2-3). 2. At the AAA Conference in Washington in 1996 I attended the workshop 'Signs of the Cyborg' in which two Dutch scholars, Arthur Elsenaar and Remko Scha, gave a remarkable performance. The face of one of them was covered with electrodes. In the background one could hear the voices of two computers who tried to find out what the facial expressions of their human research object meant when they activated one or more electrodes: a really remarkable reversal of the subject-object relation. 3. See, for example, Randy Glasbergen's cartoon 'Technology Bytes' which shows a display monitor transforming into the jaws of a shark. 4. This ad shows a striking family resemblance with the stunning scene in Cronenberg's Videodrome, when Max Renn sticks his head into the mouth of Nicki Brand on the screen of his TV set: another striking illustration of the blurring of boundaries between persons and things. 5. Again I want to point to a family resemblance, this time with the age old emblematic motif of 'ownerless legs or arms stretching from the sky' (cf. Scholz 1989). 6. In a footnote I wrote, for instance, the following: 'If one looks at these sensory experiences from this angle, one can rather easily understand why particular ways of looking, particular sounds and smells are interpreted as "caressing" and "stroking" or "hurting" and "polluting" the body and evoke positive or negative bodily reactions towards the humans producing them'. 7. The recent rat race in academic circles leads more and more to a repetition of similar ideas regarding the same topics as a direct consequence of the rapidly increasing, but apparently unstoppable gap between the production and consumption of publications. 8. Ultra-sound scan forms an exception, for in this case ultrasonic vibrations are translated into an image visible on a monitor. There is a family resemblance here with sonar as well as with radar that makes objects visible on screens via rebounding electro magnetic waves. 9. According to Synnott our ocular-centrism goes back to such ancient Greek philosophers as Aristotle who equated sight and reason on the one hand, and the Judaeo-Christian equation of God and light on the other (1993:210). 10. In his study Downcast Eyes Martin Jay (1993) pays attention to the way in which French scholars in the twentieth century have been busy with what he calls the denigration of vision. See also Denzin (1995:194 ff.). 11. It was Jay (1993) who coined the expression 'Cartesian scopic regime'. 12. This 'corporeal density of the spectator's body' unmistakably refers to Crary's expression 'carnal density of vision' (1992:150). What Crary, who wrote a fascinating study on vision and modernity in the nineteenth century, means by this density is very well summarized by Williams: 'Crary introduces the term carnal density in opposition to the previously reigning Cartesian influenced models of vision that posited a disembodied, centered, unitary human subjectivity capable of knowing the objective truths of the world. The body of this "decorporealized" observer was not implicated in vision's knowledge of the world; it registered, from a singular centered, dematerialized point of view inside the camera obscura, a stable material reality "out there." In the wake of the breakdown of such idealist and decorporealized models of vision, and with the rise of materially new techniques of observation, Crary argues that a new relation of viewer to viewed arose' (Williams 1999:334). 40</page><page sequence="21">13. I don't want to deal here with Benjamin's argument that film as a new medium leads to the loss of the aura of the actor. The only thing I want to say is that I am surprised that he did not even take into consideration the possibility that cinema also had an aura itself. 14. Benjamin's comparison of filmmakers with surgeons who penetrate bodies calls forth asso ciations with the directors of so-called splatter movies who are experts in showing in really gruesome ways and with a great love for details the inside of bodies and how they can fall into pieces. See also Lammer (this volume). 15. See Constance Classen (1998:156-159) for a revealing expose on the efforts of the Futurists, for instance Marinetti, to develop tactile art. 16. See for an exegesis McCole, who remarks: 'The uses of tactile nearness to break the spell cast by visual distance would later be crucial in the theory of aesthetic perception developed in "The Work of Art-" Benjamin's "pathos of nearness," then, had an inextricably spatial and tactile dimension' (1993:246). 17. Miriam Hansen, for example, wrote with regard to Siegfried Kracauer's (1889-1966) ideas on film: 'The material elements that present themselves in film directly stimulate the material layers of the human being: his nerves, his senses, his entire physiological substance' (quoted in Moore 2000:115-116). 18. This fragmentation in his view was a direct consequence of the fact that the literate process favored the detached and noninvolved, visual mode of perceiving above all other sensorial modes. But see in this connection the novel by Peter Verhelst Het Spierenalfabet (Alphabet of the Muscles, 1995) that deals with reading as a purely physical experience. 19. Recently Swedish researchers discovered that a particular type of new screens 'exhale' tri fenylphosphate, which might cause a skin allergy (cf. www.delta.tudelft.nl/jaargangen/32/29/ p3vlamvertrager.html). 20. In an interview Serge Toubiana had with Gilles Deleuze the latter said: 'The brain is the screen. I don't believe linguistics or psychoanalysis is of great help for cinema. On the other hand, there is the biology of the brain, molecular biology. Thought is molecular ...(...) Cinema, precisely because it puts the image in movement, or rather endows the image with a self-movement, never ceases to trace and retrace the circuits of the brain. (...) The screen, namely ourselves, can be the tiny deficient brain of an idiot as much as a creative brain' (1998:48^19). 21. See in this connection the very interesting debate in Behavioral and Brain Sciences (2001 [21]: 195-261) on the thesis launched by Stoffregen and Bardy (2001) that one might question the assumption that perception is divided into separate domains of vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. 22. In this connection the following passage is very revealing: 'It begins to be evident that "touch" is not the skin but the interplay of the senses, and "keeping in touch" or "getting" in touch" is a matter of a fruitful meeting of the senses, of sight translated into sound and sound into movement, and taste and smell. The "common sense" was for many centuries held to be the peculiar human power of translating one kind of experience of one sense into all the senses, and presenting the result continuously as unified image to the mind. In fact, this image of a unified ratio among the senses was long held to be the mark of our rationality, and may in the computer age easily become so again' (McLuhan 1966:60). Personally I would have preferred it, if McLuhan had said that seeing, hearing, tasting and smelling are all forms of being touched, instead of that the touch is the interplay of the senses, which I think is less radical. 23. As a motto for his book De Kerckhove choose the following remarkable statement by McLuhan as a motto: Tn the electric age, we wear all mankind as our skin'. In May 2002 Philips announced that it had developed the prototype of a screen, consisting of a mixture of liquid crystals and polymer substances, which could be painted on a range of diverse bases, for example, clothing. In a sense the teletubbies with TV screens in their bellies are examples of beings that nicely illustrate McLuhan's statement and Philips' invention. 41</page><page sequence="22">24. We may be used to the fact that we are 'watched' by cameras, by not yet to the fact that screens which function as inter-faces between viewer and cameras might do the same. 25. This reminds one of Berkeley, who already in the eighteenth century claimed 'that objects can only be known by touch, which he considered as the ultimate means of exploration and knowledge of the world' (Mark Jeannerod in Wilson 1998:366wl6). 26. The quotes are from Sobchack's article The Scene of the Screen: Envisioning Cinematic and Electronic 'Presence' as it is available on the Internet. It is also published in: Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht and K. Ludwig Pfeiffer (Eds.), 1994, Materialities of Communication. Stanford: Stanford University Press. Pp. 83-106. 27. In the conclusion of her dissertation Laan states: 'Clearly, if a researcher wishes to study relatively high levels of genital arousal in the laboratory, use of erotic films depicting intercourse, or manual or oral stimulation of the female actor's genitals, is the best option. In fact, erotic film stimuli have proven to be effective in inducing predictable levels of genital arousal over time. When subjects were shown a hierarchy of film stimuli, slowly increasing from kissing and caressing up to intercourse, a reliable and systematic increase in genital arousal occurred in virtually all subjects' (1994:155). See for a similar conclusion with regard to men Koukounas and McCabe (2001). 28. But see Classen (1998), for she pays a lot of attention to the question how the Futurists and the Surrealists tackled the senses. 29. Another interesting film he might have used is Ring (1998) by Hideo Nakata. It is about a video killing everybody who watches it. 30. The mixing up of screens and humans comes also to the fore in the movie by the following phrase of Brian O'blivion (what is in a name?), the murdered media-prophet and inventor of videodrome: 'The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye; therefore the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain' (Kauffman 1998:128). 31. See http://thegalleriesatmoore.org/publications/valie/valietour3.shtrnl; Comwell 1992:206 207). 32. In fact Schneider's book The Explicit Body in Performance is nothing else but a gigantic effort to develop other ways of knowing (or 'seeing') than the ones we are used to in the West and which are 'traditionally wrapped up with visuality, with vision set forth as proprietary, transcendent of tactility, omnisciently disinterested, and essentially separate from the object which it apprehends' (1997:22). Her big question is: 'how can we see otherwise?' 33. It is exactly this erotic touch that is feared by many people, reason why they can become angry and start campaigns to censor particular moving images on screens. I think that their claim that consumers of these images are influenced is absolutely correct, but almost never in the direction they fear so much: immoral and socially disruptive behavior. 34. Due to the widespread diffusion of TVs and PCs millions of people nowadays possess a modem version of the faculty of scrying, which Andrew Lang at the end of the nineteenth century defined as that of 'seeing, faces, places, persons in motion, sometimes recognizable, in a glass ball, or in water, ink, or any clear deep' (quoted in Bestermann 1924:2). Once only specialists practiced the art of scrying with, for instance, mirrors, water, glass and, last but not least, crystals. According to Bestermann 'the first use of crystals in scrying was to place a crystal in water, which was thus made fit for the use as a speculum' (ibid.:3), which immediately calls forward associations with the liquid crystals used in screens and displays today. Of course, there are differences between watching moving images on modem screens and looking to such images in crystal balls, but what I want to emphasize here is the age-old and still occurring connection between such materials as glass and crystals, seeing and gaining knowledge about the world. With regard to the central theme of this essay: the relation between, vision, tactility and screens it is interesting to know that at least one of the theories developed at the beginning of 42</page><page sequence="23">the twentieth century concerning the appearance of images in crystal balls deals with the touch of the optical nerve by reflecting light (ibid.: 120). Whether this theory is empirically correct or not, it can be seen as at least showing a striking family resemblance with the kind of theories developed concerning moving images on screens which physically touch (and transform) us. 35. Examples of films showing the inside of the human body are The Miracle of Life and The Human Body (cf. NRC Handelsblad d.d. 11 January 2002). See for a fine study on the transparency of the human body Van Dijck (2001). 36. According to Grau telepresence implies that a 'user' can be present in three different places at the same time: a) the place where his physical body is, b) through teleperception in an image space and c) through teleaction in the place where a robot reacts directly by the 'user's' movements (2000:239). 37. A significant indication for this importance is, for example, the flood of books and articles on the body by social scientists since the eighties of the last century. 38. According to Classen such a revision is not possible without a conceptual break with visual culture. 'One means of creating this break is by considering the aesthetic experiences of the blind and the blind-deaf. What better antidote to Western society's hypervisualism than the tactile universe of Laura Bridgeman or Helen Keller's world of touch, smell, and taste?' (1998:160). Though this suggestion sounds very interesting, I think it is not radical enough, for it only seems to imply another emphasis, this time on the non-visual senses, and no wish to conceptualize our perception of the world as a tactile process.
