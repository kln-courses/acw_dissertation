<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION IN PRE-ISLAMIC INDONESIA Karabi Mitra The pre-Islamic Indonesian culture presents a mosaic of different religious systems comprising indigenous systems of worship and south Asian elements namely, Saivism, Vaishnavism, etc. From the political point of view the region witnessed the rise of Central Java (late 6th century A.D.), followed by the rise of East Java (early 10th century), Singhasari (early 13th century) and Majapahit (late 13th to early 16th century). The present discussion will be focused on Central Java. The chief sources of information are inscriptions, images, literary sources. India and Indonesia developed a close cultural contact since early centuries of the Christian era and religion was a common sphere where both the cultures shared each other's elements. The Bali presents the most prominent example of the ancient religious influence from India till date. The 'temple boom of central Java' (570-927 A.D.) was preceded by economic prosperity caused by flourishing international trade and ample agricultural production leading to great economic prosperity.1 Prof Hall described the development of 'eco-regions'; in central Java where local chiefs contended for authority. However in view of the similarity of their resource base and lineage-based legitimacies it was difficult to assert supremacy. Therefore, to 'acquire a superior legitimacy that would distinguish them from the others, they sought the help of Hindu and Buddhist theocracy so that they 'could claim a relationship to higher gods, a relationship fitting for higher kings',2 and the king 'could demonstrate his spiritual superiority, his connection to these higher gods and to a higher knowledge, through elaborate rituals and state ceremonies conducted by Buddhist or Hindu holy men'.3 In this manner the temples and stupas acted as 'teaching devices'.4 Indian Brahmans and monks were highly venerated in Javanese society. The Stone of Kanjuruha refers to the 'officiating priests versed in the Vedas and adept in rituals, together with the best of yatis (ascetics) and the astrologers5 while the Ci-Aruton Rock of Purnavarman referred to the 'endowment of a thousand cows to the brahmans'6 and 'construction of a guest house for the twice-born class 'in the Stone of Kanjuruha.7 The religious systems propagated by the Indian Hindu Brahmanas and Sramanas were acceptable to the Indonesian milieu who internalized the alien systems which had similarities with their local tradition. The immense influence of Indian religious systems</page><page sequence="2">1030 ÍHC: Proceedings , 72nd Session, 2011 strengthens the theory of Brahmanic penetration in the area under discussion.8 As discussed earlier, early Indonesian society was egalitarian and in order to form the infrastructure of state system the ruling class invited the Brahmanas. They were isolated from the rural milieu and kept in touch with their patrons. They disseminated the Dharmasastras , Arthasastra and Silpasastras and served as 'development planners'.9 As for example the inscription of Mulavarman (around 400 A.D.) mentioned 'they had come here' and Herman Kulke concludes that they came from India and the king was consecrated by the Brahmanas and later on obtained tribute from them.10 Therefore it is clear that Indonesian rulers invited the Brahmanas for legitimating their power with the help of Sastric injunctions and developed their states by way of 'outsourcing' their service. H.B. Sarkar has drawn attention to the charters referring to the Sanskritized names of administrative heads as for example Raja, Rajadhiraja, Samanta, Nayaka, Likhitopatra, etc.11 Besides, religion became a tool in the hands of the rulers who were deified after death and identified with their favourite deity. Reference may be made in this context to king Purnavarman of Borneo, King Airlangga of Belahan who were identified with Vishnu and the Singasari image of Queen Dedes as Prajnaparamita. The phallic symbol of Shiva was considered as the source of royal power. In India it was represented as the 'virile father-god.12 The inscriptional references and available images of Shiva in Indonesia testify to the deep reverence shown to him. An expert described a bronze image of the God (Tegal, North Java) as 'concentration of contained and yet outward directed energy emanates from this figure... The fine workmanship of the image seen in the modelling of the hands, the execution of the ornaments and the garments testifies to the mastery attained by Java's ancient Bronze casters.13 King Sanjaya, the self- declared Saivite ruler left the imprint of his deep veneration in the beuatiful Sanskrit compositions in the Canaggal inscription (8th century, A.D.). Probably King Sanjaya of central Java founded the first Saivite sanctuary. Dieng plateau was a place of pilgrimage and several candis were named after the Pandavas. Candis or Tjandis were 'mortuary temples'14 with 'the ashes of royal personalities were deposited in a stone casket within a central pit. Above the pit was erected a commemorative statue of a king or a queen in the shape of a Hindu or Buddhist deity.15 The word may be connected with 'Tjandika Durga'.16 The Saivite pantheon including Parvati, Ganesha and other Gods were represented with a peculiar feature of 'anthropomorphic animal mounts of the principal gods....'17</page><page sequence="3">Counļries other than India 1 03 1 Indian Saivas are divided into several communities. According to Bosch the Saiva Siddhantas from South India penetrated Central Java.18 The guru's role as seer, ability to 'change water into amrta' ere suitable for the transmission of the concept. He further explained the process of how the role was expanded into advisorship of the king, court poet, chief justice, astrologer, supreme authority in religious affairs, initiator and keeper of the holy tradition.19 However, Prof Sarkar emphasized the role of the Pasupatas from Bengal who reached there 'at some unspecified date before A.D. 860'. 20 An expert observed in other context the political connotation of the phallic worship representing a 'indivisible Trinity' consisting of the linga, the ruler and the Brahmana. While Siva is the supreme God in the heaven, the ruler is the supreme authority on the earth and the Brahmana ranks top in the social hierarchy. Besides, he is the 'mediator who obtains his linga from Siva and hands it over to the founder of the dynasty as the palladium of his royalty' and 'the tradition ... is generally applicable in the Javanese situation'.21 The Gods and Goddesses of the Shiva and Buddhist pantheon like Ganes, Kumar Kartikeya, Saraswati, Sri, etc., are changed in the Balinese context22 and also represented in regional art forms. While Shiva, the divine father represented the patriarchal tradition his consort Durga was internalized within the indigenous matriarchal tradition. In the early socio-economic scenario the women played a crucial role in the system of production of resources. They were believed to possess magical power of mediating 'between mankind and the spirit world'.23 the deities to some extent represented the indigenous social norms. For example the well known image of Mahisasuramardini in Java presents Durga not as the slayer of the buffalo rather she is shown as taming the animal which is quite natural in an agricultural society and 'perhaps an acknowledgement of its essential role in the cultivation of rice'.24 A study on the art form of the Durga images numbering thirty- two (dating from the 7 th- 1 5 th centuries) in the collection of the Museum National, Jakarta showed several common features. "All the images .... exhibit the same basic features .... The goddess is standing very relaxed in various poses on the back of a buffalo cowering under her feet . . . close to the buffalo's head arises a small, dwarf-like figure; the goddess either grabs the figure by its hair or touches its head, a humiliating gesture in javanese eyes."25 However, the author also referred to the 'exceptional features' resulting from increasing Tantric influences. As a result she was metamorphosed from a serene, superior, relaxed goddess to 'a frightening demoness in graveyards and cremation grounds from the 15th century onwards.26 In Bali 'the powerful figure of Durga became interlaced with stories of the Balinese widow (Rangda)</page><page sequence="4">1032 IHC : Proceedings , 72nd Session, 2011 Calón Arang, so frightfully powerful that, if angered, she could destroy the entire country.27 In this context her image resembles that of Chamunda of the Devipurana. Prof. Sarkar referred to the influence of Pala art form on the representation of the goddess.28 burga was a much- adored deity in ancient Java and Bali. In the Timbangan-Tungkal inscrition (913 A.D.) Rudra and Durga were invoked jointly.29 King Airlangga worshipped the goddess in the Terap hermitage in forest and when he recovered his capital the hermitage was declared as tax-free zone. An expert referred to the development of three concepts namely, the benevolent goddess of the Saivite temples, mahasakii , a powerful goddess who took part in the creation of the universe and Batari Durga, a terrifying deity. Actually the art form of the deity depicts her as the goddess of death who rides on a buffalo. Possibly she was worshipped to get rid of death and achieve immortality.30 It may be argued that, the projection of Durga was in a way a challenge to the introduction of Shiva, the patriarchal god imported from India. The crucial role of women in the traditional social system has already been pointed out. Though mythological ly Durga was the consort of Shi va yet as a feminine deity she was conceived as a awesome deity holding more space in popular life than Shiva. The Hindu pantheon of Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara were highly venerated by the ruling authority. The Canggal inscription of King Sanjaya described the Gods in the following terms: 'May the self- created Lord the object of worship of the world, whose pair of feet- lotuses are revered by the Gods, who has fixed the regulations of the World to the post of the Vedas: who is the source of religion, worldly prosperity and desire, whose body dazzles like gold and whose matted locks are comparable to the flames of the fire of his own body' ((Brahma). Mies on the surface of the watery bed, the petals of whose eye-lotuses are red through meditation who is be hymned by the Gods for protection: who is frowningly viewed by the Goddess Sri, on seeing the beauty of her own images reflected on the side-levels of the jewels on the up-turned crown of the king of the serpents....'31 Another interesting dimension is added with the development of syncretic cults namely Harihara, Sivabuddha, Harichandana, Sivaditya who were referred to in the inscriptions. King Airlangga was stated to have 'released in the Siva-Buddha regions' after death. Besides 'an arca (cult-statue of Siva-Buddha) was also mentioned in the N agar akr tagama?2 Agastya, the mythological Indian pitcher born rishi was also popular. The Stone of Kanjuruha (760 A.D.) presents the earliest</page><page sequence="5">Countries other than India 1 03 3 specimen of old Javanese scripts and records that King Gajayana founded a temple of Agastya and the statue was made of black marble.33 The earlier statue was made of Devdaru wood. Probably it was destroyed and replaced by the stone image. Prof Sarkar observed that, the cult of Agastya was introduced at Dinaja in the middle of the 7lh Saka era.34 The Vajrayana form of Buddhism earned great popularity. The great stupa of Barabudur built by the Sailendras ( circa 760-860 A.D.) testifies to the fact. Prof. Sarkar described the monument as 'a sepulcharal monument containing the relics of the founder of the Sailendra dynasty, besides being a replica of the universe'.35 John N. Miksie pointed at the uniqueness of the monument and commented that 'The genius of the creators of Borobudur is that one monument combines numerous symbolic elements from different sources. It is at once a multi-tiered terraced structure like the pre-historic religious sites of Indonesia; a mandala with concentric rows of sculptures representing Buddhist deities: a symbol of royal might composed of over two million large blocks of stone: and a device for inculcating wisdom through its gallery of 1,350 narrative reliefs.'36 The Stone of Kalasan (700 saka) referred to the foundation of a 'splendid' temple of Tara, the Buddhist Goddess. A dwelling place for the monks who knew 'the Great Vehicle of Disciple' was also built. The Sailendra king's order was carried out by the *adesasastrins'37 The village of Kalasan was granted to the temple. The temple was described as the 'common property of all men'.38 The Stone of Kelurak (704 saka) recorded the foundation of the temple of Manjusri.39 The inscription significantly referred to a royal preceptor hailing from Gauridvipa, i.e. Bengal,40 and presence of Buddha, Dharma, Sangha and Brahma, Visnu, Mahesvara in the image of Manjusri.41 This definitely points to the syncretic nature of the prevailing religious tradition. In the Copper plate of Kancana (820 A.D.) both a Buddhist and a Brahma priest' are referred to as conducting religious ceremonies.42 The royal authority practiced Tantric rites and there was synthesis of Tantric and Buddhist practices. Interestingly the indigenous practices of spirit worship and ancestral worship find ample references in the inscriptions as well as in the Balinese practice till date. Whenever a freehold or a land was demarcated for religious purposes a number of spirits were invoked to protect the place from intruders43 or indigenous items for religious offerings were referred to which show no or very lttle connection with Indian practice.44</page><page sequence="6">1034 ÍHC : Proceedings , 72nd Session, 2011 How were Indian religious practices internalized in the indigenous society of Indonesia? A close look at the Balinese countryside may furnish some data to understand the complex process of religious osmosis. Prof Sarkar commented that', ... It is obvious that, already in the beginning of the eighth century this veneration for the hill spirits coincided with respect paid to the Sivalinga by king Sanjaya .... who could be trusted to pay his traditional homage to the similar looking menhirs ... There is hardly any doubt that, the hill spirits reigning in the mass-mind from pre-historic days became equated with the menhir- like Siva lingas introduced by the Indians'. He identified the Siva linga with indigenous susu-kulumpang ' which outwardly looked like a linga ... and representative of the pre-historic menhirs' and it had to be pacified and worshipped with Indonesian accessories to which Indian elements were added, as Indian gods were also invoked in a similar refrain'.45 Water could easily be accepted as pure and sacred and the concept of the purity of the Ganges or the Gomati, etc., was also accepted.46 The Indian Sastric practices of abhiseka and Sraddha were widespread. In this context reference may be made to the inscription of Mulavarman who was consecrated by the Brahmanas,47 and the N agar akr tagama , a text dated 1365 where detailed description of funeral customs is available. Contemporary practice of cremation in Bali also subscribe to the same custom. Prof. Sarkar also pointed out some differences with the Hindu system of Sraddha probably due to domination of the Buddhist Tantric rites.48 Exploration in the field of ancient religious of Indonesia opens up a very interesting area of cultural study. The puzzling features of the contact between India and Indonesia may be clarified to some extent since one can explain the process of cultural osmosis through evidence from the inscriptions, images as well as literary sources. The critical process of amalgamation of Hindu and Buddhist elements within the indigenous tradition testifies to the birth of a unique cultural system beyond the territorial boundaries and thereby efflorescence of a great Asiatic tradition.
