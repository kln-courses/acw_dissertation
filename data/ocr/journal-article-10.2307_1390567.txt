<plain_text><page sequence="1">BUDDHIST RESPONSES TO CHRISTIAN SPIRITUAL PRACTICE A Response to Reflections on Buddhist and Christian Religious Practices Ursula King University of Bristol I appreciate the opportunity to respond to these essays of personal reflections, com- paring Buddhist religious practices with some Christian examples. The different essays are rich in detail, engaging and challenging; they explore new vistas but also point to larger horizons that remain to be explored. Each contribution is so differ- ent; each can be read in multiple ways, and further questions can be asked about all of them. Although each contributor has chosen a specific focus, a particular way of interpreting Buddhist religious experience and practice, for me a common thread connects them all. The overarching question, implicitly present even when not explicitly formulated, seems to concern what religious and spiritual practices are really all about. What is the nature and content, and even more, what is the purpose of religious practice? Can very different practices be compared across different religious tradi- tions? Is it legitimate to compare Buddhist and Christian religious practices, even when they occur in very different contexts and are undergirded by different histories and systems of thought? Is the purpose of all religious practice always spiritual growth and transformation, or is the ultimate goal (if there is such a goal) utterly different and distinct from all such strivings? There can be no doubt that both external and internal religious practices can be compared at some level, that certain common patterns, shared meanings, and signif- icance, can be discerned in a wide variety of religions. It is these commonalities that phenomenological approaches to the study of religions have extensively explored and classified, but theological, philosophical, and spiritual comparisons are more difficult to delineate. Yet they do exist and have been investigated by many Eastern and West- ern thinkers. The religious practitioner, who may or may not be a scholar, more often than not remains unaware of the myriad of subtle scholarly distinctions that inhabit a long-trained rational mind. For such a practitioner the strength of spiritual commitment and the practical help in the business of daily living seems to count most when assessing the benefits or otherwise of religious practice. Somehow I find it impossible to capture the ultimate significance of religious practices, whether Bud- Buddhist-Christian Studies 22 (2002). ? by University of Hawai'i Press.

We always seem to deal with preliminaries, with passing realities rather than abiding truth and ultimate wis- dom. Yet we all know of the paradox that there is no other way to the Ultimate than through the Ordinary. It is through the manifold religious practices, however routine and repetitive, that spiritual experience patiently plots its path and weaves its pattern in order to arrive at some eventual destination or be engraced by the gratuitous joy of sudden transformation. These essays by academic colleagues and friends appealed to my spiritual imagi- nation, and some passages moved me deeply. Their Buddhist insights are enriching and thought-provoking, their references to numerous Christian parallels-whether perceived in meditation, prayer, confession, almsgiving, asceticism, vows, gestures, use of religious texts, or reference to the need for community- sometimes drew my attention to links not seen before, comparisons not encountered earlier. From a Christian perspective I also recognized that some comparisons are only made in pass- ing, so that several comments on Christian religious practices are not as developed as one might expect from an insider's point of view. All religious traditions, not just Buddhism and Christianity, involve movement, process, and transformation. Each faith tradition, grown over so many centuries and practiced in different societies and cultures by so many different individuals, possesses an ocean of riches that none of us can receive fully. There are major directions and patterns, there are mainstream and marginal practices, but no one would be able to follow them all, nor even want to practice them all, and some may even need to be discarded as obsolete or spiritually unhelpful. There exists always an excess of spiritual and ritual resources, an abundance of means whereby to find spiritual advance and fulfillment, just as there are a great vari- ety of individual gifts and needs. This is for me the glory and strength of humanity's spiritual heritage that there is so much to select from to be nourished and enlightened by. This is also part of the beauty of interreligious encounter and dialogue that we can help each other on the spiritual path through sharing and mutually illumining parts of our traditions for the benefit of each other. Several contributors have commented at length on prayer and meditation (Ken- neth Tanaka, Taitetsu Unno, Rita M. Gross), highlighting the similarities and differ- ences between Buddhist and Christian approaches to spiritual practices. They also demonstrate that far more parallels can be discovered than previously thought, once one ventures behind existing surface understandings and discards widely held stereo- types, which often contrast these two forms of spiritual practice more than necessary. Tanaka's image of "Megan's Christian prayer" as "conversational, personal, and hope- ful" and his emphasis on the petitionary element of Christian prayer do fit many cases of ordinary Christian practice (he judges Christian spirituality as "more accessible to 'ordinary' people"); yet they do not capture the heart of the Christian spiritual tradi- tion, its greatest depth and finest expressions. Christian saints and mystics know of "infused contemplation," nonverbal and imageless forms of prayer, which may well be analogous to certain forms of Buddhist meditation. I therefore see specific forms</page><page sequence="3">RESPONSE TO REFLECTIONS ON RELIGIOUS PRACTICES of prayer and meditation not so much as dualistically opposed to each other than as ultimately convergent forms of the spiritual life. The decisive criterion seems to me to be more related to the differences among the kinds of practitioners than to the dif- ferences among the practices themselves. Buddhist religious practices have been much more dominantly shaped by monastics rather than by ordinary lay people, whereas in Christianity there seems to be more of a mixture and balance of lay and monastic spiritual traditions-and depth and superficiality of religious practice can be found in both streams of the tradition. But due to the deeply incarnational approach of Christianity, Christian spiritual practice is much concerned with the spiritual trans- figuration of the ordinary, of all of life's experiences in this world, because the divine center and presence in all things transforms everything, so that all ordinary experi- ences can become the occasion for divine encounter and disclosure. There is a dyadic structure in this pattern, yet not a dualistic one; it is ultimately a unifying process that leads through different means and paths to ultimate oneness and fullness. Such transformation of the ordinary is certainly at work in the use of the simple but very effective Jesus Prayer of Orthodox Christianity, which Taitetsu Unno and Robert Aitken compare so helpfully with the Nembutsu of the Buddhist Pure Land tradition. The Jesus Prayer belongs to Eastern Christianity, where the affinities to Eastern thought and practices are much stronger than in the Christian traditions of the Latin West. The wider appeal and knowledge of the Jesus Prayer has only come to Christians in the West during the last century. Although it has earlier roots in the Greek Fathers, the Jesus Prayer came into its own in the Byzantine contemplative and ascetical movement of hesychasm, especially as developed by Gregory of Palamas (1296-1359). In this practice, repetitive prayer formulae-especially the Jesus Prayer-are integrated with bodily postures and controlled breathing in order to reach a state of deep inner peace and mystical union. The Jesus Prayer is also seen as "the prayer of the heart." The praying person is seated rather than standing (as was the custom in the East) and is advised to direct the eyes, together with the intellect, toward the middle of the body, to the navel or to the heart, the deep center of unity. Breathing should be carefully controlled in rhythm with the Jesus Prayer or may be coordinated with the beating of the heart itself. Thus the intellect can dispel all thought and search inwardly for the true place of the heart, where inner simplicity, free from all images and discursive thinking, is reached. According to Gregory of Palamas, the prayer of the heart leads eventually to the vision of the divine light, which even in this life can be seen with the eyes of the body. This light is identical to the radiant splendor that surrounded Jesus at his Transfiguration on Mount Tabor, for it is none other than the uncreated energies of the Godhead. The physical techniques of controlled breathing and concentrated attention upon specific psychosomatic centers of the human body bear similarities to those of Yoga and Sufism. It is possible, though unclear, that the Byzantine hesychasts were influ- enced by Sufi masters. It is certain, however, that the development of hesychasm helped Eastern Christianity to survive almost four hundred years of Muslim occupa- tion after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Hesychast spirituality inspired monks</page><page sequence="4">URSULA KING and laypeople alike; its simple character and precepts allowed its techniques and prayers to be handed down without schools, literature, or clerical leadership, at a time when Orthodox spirituality no longer enjoyed official support. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the practice ofhesychasm enjoyed a great renaissance throughout Bulgaria, Serbia, and Russia. The publication of the Philokalia (1782), an anthology of Orthodox ascetical and mystical writings from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries, and The Way of the Pilgrim (1884) made Ortho- dox spirituality and mysticism, especially the teachings on hesychasm and the Jesus Prayer, widely known to the modern world. Whereas the Philokalia consists of texts originally written by and for monks, its eighteenth-century editors intended it for all Christians, and the anonymous Way of the Pilgrim is perhaps the work of a devout Russian peasant much inspired by the earlier collection of texts and the hesychast practice of prayer. As a pilgrim traveling through Russia and Siberia he learned the Jesus Prayer from a master who also taught him to read the Philokalia with the eyes of the spirit. In turn, his work, Way of the Pilgrim, became widely influential and inspired many people in the twentieth century to discover Orthodox spirituality, in many ways so different from that of Western Christianity, and to adopt the practice of the Jesus Prayer. Many could follow on the pilgrim's spiritual path and experience for themselves what he expressed with such intensity when he wrote: "The prayer of the heart provided me with such delight, that I doubted if there were anyone happier than I on earth, or if there could be greater and finer delight in the very kingdom of heaven. Not only did I feel this in my innermost soul, but also all that was around me appeared to me in a delightful form, and all prompted me to love God and to thank him, people, trees, plants, animals, everything was akin to me, on all I found the impress of the name of Jesus Christ." This passage expresses a holistic and environmentally conscious attitude that hints at the interconnectedness of all beings, and thus resonates with a profound Buddhist insight. Many such resonances and affinities are explored in considerable detail in Robert Aitken's essay on Buddhist and Christian formal practice. Much of this prac- tice is undertaken by the individual, even when together in a group. Aitken mentions in passing the Roman Catholic mass, but much more could be made of the central Christian community rite of celebrating the Eucharist, which not only remembers or makes present Christ's Last Supper, but also brings to mind other invisible commu- nities, such as the communion of saints and that of "all souls" departed. Compari- sons between the spiritual group experience of the Buddhist sangha and the Chris- tian understanding of spiritual communion and community might perhaps provide a counterbalance to the often too individualistic emphasis on spiritual practice. However illuminating the comparisons between particular spiritual practices are, the main question remains of how such practices spiritually transform people, a ques- tion raised more than once in Rita M. Gross's essay on meditation and prayer. What difference do they make to the people practicing them? Gross has structured much of her discussion around the Christian serenity prayer and some of its Buddhist ana- logues. Other kinds of Christian prayer would invite comparisons of a different kind. 108</page><page sequence="5">RESPONSE TO REFLECTIONS ON RELIGIOUS PRACTICES For example, much of Christian prayer is devoted to the adoration of God's very being, greater glory, and intimate presence, or to offering thanks and praise for cre- ation, the giving of life, the sending of Jesus, the utter graciousness of all gifts bestowed on us. These examples would invite other comparisons, as would much of Christian spiritual experience that is expressed in sacred music, from Gregorian chants to the fugues of Bach or the celebrated pieces of Olivier Messiaen or John Tavener. Or what about the spiritual experiences that undergird Christian art and architecture in comparison to those that have shaped the glories of Buddhist art across Eastern continents and cultures? These enshrine not only the experiences of individual practitioners and artists, but express the spiritual vision and experience of an entire culture. Perhaps cultural and communal dimensions are not sufficiently taken into account in Buddhist-Christian dialogue? Gross describes the theological differences between Buddhism and Christianity as "striking and uncompromising," but considers the forms of spiritual practice as "more similar than different." I wonder, however, whether there is not, between the phenomenological similarities at one end and the theological differences at the other, a middle common ground, a meeting of the ways, where the spiritual transformations achieved by different practitioners on Buddhist or Christian paths are more similar than different? This leads back to the fundamental question of what spirituality does or, more precisely, what spiritual practices do to people, rather than what those practices are. Do we become more compassionate, loving, and wise? Are we more peaceful, just and kind, equanimous, and generous through following the practices of a particular reli- gious tradition? And do other people perhaps achieve the same result through other means, sometimes even secular ones? The postmodern conditions of our present age present us with such (immensely confusing) possibilities of choice, which also apply to the area of religion and spirituality. While our ancestors in more traditional ages of the past were shaped by the forces of tradition, we are compelled and constrained by the inevitable need for selection. This has opened up immense possibilities of free- dom, but it also exercises a quite unforeseen, new form of bondage and a new kind of blinding that makes some people miss the spiritual dimensions of human life alto- gether. Besides exploring parallels in Buddhist and Christian religious practices, it may be beneficial to investigate on another occasion how these two religious tradi- tions perceive the beginnings of spiritual awakening and what educational and pas- toral means they have used to bring about such awakening, which can lead to pro- found spiritual transformation. I would like to add here some further reflections on the difference between prayer and meditation. Many people today, both young and old, have some knowledge and experience of these two different modes of centering. It is not my intention, how- ever, to provide a survey here. I only offer a few thoughts of my own. I was surprised to find that the recently published, quite splendid Oxford Companion to Christian Thought (eds. Adrian Hastings, Alistair Mason, and Hugh Pyper, OUP 2000) has no entry at all on either meditation or contemplation, which it only mentions in pass-</page><page sequence="6">URSULA KING ing in the long article on prayer. What does that say about Christianity or, rather, about the late-twentieth-century consciousness of Christian scholars about their own religious tradition? All religions know different forms of prayer. During the First World War, the Ger- man scholar Friedrich Heiler wrote a famous comparative study on prayer, which has recently been republished. But meditation, in contrast to prayer, was far less known in the West until quite recently. How do these two forms of religious expression- prayer and meditation-relate to each other? Human experiences and formulations of prayer comprise many dimensions, which range from a few personal words to widely known, set prayers used over many generations, from private to public prayers to deeply mystical, wordless prayer expe- riences of exultation, adoration, supplication, and abandonment. One might almost say that oral prayer moves on into contemplative (using images without words) and meditational (without images or words) exercises. I think an important distinction is the fact that prayer always seems to be addressed to a personal God (or, in some reli- gions, to several gods)-a very special, great person, almost a "super-person" when seen from an anthropomorphic perspective, but always a personal "Thou" whom we intimately, lovingly or imploringly, speak to. The worship of a personal God is there- fore always connected with human prayer, whether traditionally formulated prayers like the "Our Father" in Christianity, spoken by an individual or a congregation, or the Orthodox "Jesus Prayer" which is much more a silent inner prayer. Such deep prayers have been described as the language of the heart, and it is in this deeply per- sonal prayer that our soul breathes and grows in its intimate conversation with God. All faiths possess a rich heritage of prayers, as can be seen from contemporary anthologies and interfaith services-prayers that human beings have created and uttered in all kinds of different life situations, from the cradle to the grave. There are prayers to address all needs, to plead, to thank, to eat, to travel, to grieve, to celebrate, to adore, for different times of the day and the year, for rites of passage as well as fleet- ing events-the list is as long as the rich patterns of human life. Prayer seems to be mostly connected to linguistic expression in words, or even song. Comparing prayer to meditation one might be inclined to emphasize the con- trast between such a word-centered religious activity and the silent, wordless inner meditation. But I think it is a mistake to overemphasize such distinction, which, after all, is again an external one. Meditation is for many primarily understood as con- nected with Eastern religions, especially Buddhism and Hinduism. Meditation has especially arisen within faith contexts that are centred on an impersonal Reality or All, and is thus connected with an illumination or enlightenment understood to be utterly transpersonal. Meditation is closely connected with deep inner concentration and outer withdrawal; meditational techniques bear down on a deep inner center, a transcendent All-ground, although some methods also work with visualizations. But on the whole we associate meditation more with an imageless realization or experi- ence than with anything else. This kind of experience has usually been called "con- templation" in the Christian mystical tradition, whereas the word "meditation" orig-</page><page sequence="7">RESPONSE TO REFLECTIONS ON RELIGIOUS PRACTICES inally meant in Christianity the meditative reflection on specific themes or images, often drawn from the life of Jesus or from other biblical sources. Comparing prayer and meditation one can say that the intentional direction of prayer is mostly one from inward to outward, from self to other, in that the prayer addresses another Person, the great "Other," so that the self finds a transcendent cen- ter for itself, whereas Eastern meditation consists rather of a movement from outward to inward, an effort to reach the immanent center of the self in a deeper dimension within. Thus the direction of prayer and meditation differ; their center is found in a different place and experienced in a different way. But ultimately this difference dis- appears in that the transcendent and immanent reality touch each other in the depth of being and are ultimately interrelated. One can therefore speak of an interweaving and a continuity between prayer and meditation-the deepest prayer experience of Christian mystics ultimately translates itself into a meditative depth experience of union with the divine ground. There exists much discussion today regarding the different methods of medita- tion in East and West. But to speak of meditation is perhaps already a contradiction, because meditation is above all linked to personal practice of concentration and deep inner experience apart from words. And yet such practice requires guidance and train- ing; thus, meditation invites both reflective thinking and practical exercises. We need to learn how to open our mind and heart, how to open ourselves inwardly to be seized by divine grace, or be at peace, be attentive, and be ready to receive the power of the spirit. For Christians, this is connected with the dynamic of divine life, the experi- ence of all-sustaining love-whereas the Buddhist may experience ultimate enlight- enment as both emptiness and fullness. Eastern religions have developed many helpful means for practicing meditation, whether one thinks of bodily postures, breathing exercises, helpful images such as the mandala, or repetition of words in a mantra. All of these have by now become widely familiar and are used by many Western people today. A fine example of interweaving Christian prayers with Buddhist meditation is found in Penelope Eckersley's Nepal notebook Holding the Silences (Glastonbury: Abbey Press, 1998). High up in the Himalayan mountains she described her experience: "I closed my eyes to draw myself down into my own stillness, undisturbed by the sights around me and the thoughts to which they give rise." But she also talks of bringing "prayer and meditation out of the limited world of introspection, ethical choices, and self-improvement, into a greater involvement with all that is" (pp. 93 and 89). I think it is very important to see how closely interrelated prayer and meditation are, and it may be part of the contemporary spiritual renewal to combine the best of the two. In Christian churches people pray a great deal, but there is often not enough meditation. There is far too much emphasis on the spoken word and external action, and yet many people can no longer easily relate to the art of praying. In contempo- rary culture we are externally overstimulated by words, images, and constant noise, which seem to drown the quiet search of our inner being. Many contemporaries are therefore looking for new wholeness; they need a time and place for quietness and</page><page sequence="8">URSULA KING spiritual nourishment. That is why meditation is so popular-a practice many are attracted to, whether they are religious or not. The Sri Lankan Jesuit Aloysius Pieris has characterized the Christian encounter with Buddhism as "love meets wisdom" (see his book Love Meets Wisdom: A Christian Experience ofBuddhism, Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis Books, 1998). More recently another Sri Lankan priest, Mervyn Fernando, has explored a number of different Buddhist and Christian challenges and parallels, including the interesting comparison of the Buddhist arhat and the Christian saint (see his book In Spirit and in Truth: An Explo- ration of Buddhist/Christian and East/ West Crosscurrents, Ratmalana: Vishva Lekha Publishers, 2001). Many other parallels and comparisons are discussed in the helpful history of Buddhist-Christian dialogue by Whalen Lai and Michael von Briick (see their Christianity and Buddhism: A Multi-Cultural History of Their Dialogue, Mary- knoll, N.Y.: Orbis Books, 2001). An ever growing number of high quality, well- informed publications by Buddhist and Christian practitioners and scholars (not to forget the earlier annotated bibliography, Resourcesfor Buddhist-Christian Encounter, produced by the SBCS in 1993) help us explore further what comparisons and par- allels exist in our respective traditions in the practices and aims of the spiritual life. I celebrate these quite new possibilities of sharing spiritual practices and experiences across our different faith traditions as one of the golden opportunities for discover- ing new horizons and new spiritual meaning for human life, not only for particular individuals, but for all humanity.</page></plain_text>
