The brief compass of this review has necessitated the elimination of a number of matters that ought to have received some attention, e. g., the character of the scholia Tricliniana and the methods where- by they are distinguished from the vetera, or the re-evaluation of the position of Demetrius Triclinius in the history of classical scholarship. There are things of which I for one do heartily approve, but lack of space forbids going into them. Consequently, some of my remarks may appear to give a negative cast to my opinion as a whole. To offset any impression of fault-finding, which would be entirely erroneous, let me state unequivocally that this is a splendid new work, a book from which I have learnt much already, and expect to learn more. This edition cannot be neglected by any student of Aristophanes, and it is both an intellectual and an aesthetic joy to use. This is a significant advance in the study of Aristophanes in particular, and of Greek letters in general. WALTON MORRIS. TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA. DANIEL BABUT. Plutarque et le Stoicisme. Paris, Presses Uni- versitaires de France, 1969. Pp. 598 + iv (unbound Addenda et Corrigenda). (Publications de l'Universite de Lyon.) Since the nineteenth century dissertations of H. Bazin (Nice, 1865) and of K. Giesen (Miinster, 1889), entitled respectively De Plutarcho Stoicorum adversario and De Plutarchi contra Stoicos disputationibus, there has been no single comprehensive work on Plutarch and Stoicism. Some basic assumptions of these works, viz. that Plutarch had no profound understanding of Stoic doctrine, or lacked independence in the use of his sources, seem to have gone largely unexamined. Moreover, three general views of Plutarch's relationship to Stoicism have not been reconciled. He was: (a) a determined adversary of Stoicism; (b) an eclectic thinker vacillating between the Academy and the Stoa; and (c) a Stoic malgre lui. Babut has filled a significant lacuna in the interpretation of Plutarch's thought with a study that is broad in scope, covering the Moralia and Vitae, and including works not obviously or specifically concerned with Stoic doctrines and themes, e.g. De E apud Delphos (cf. pp. 148 f.). He presents, moreover, a detailed analysis of a number of Plutarch's writings, taking account of such problems as chronology, and sources of and relationship to Stoic views. A preliminary problem concerning the meaning of "Stoicism " is briefly handled by Babut (pp. 15-18). Whatever the stability of this philosophy, it no doubt underwent some transformation since 485</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. ca. 300 B. C. Hence, the thought of a Stoic of Plutarch's time should not be completely identified with that of a contemporary of Zeno or Chrysippus. Babut further notes, however, that in his polemical works against the school, e. g. De Stoic. rep. and De comm. not., Plutarch seems to deal exclusively with representatives of early Stoicism, principally Chrysippus. Moreover, those of the middle period, e. g. Panaetius, scarcely seem to have a major place in his conception of the school. Despite this and other considerations, Babut maintains that limiting discussion to Plutarch on early Stoicism would have the grave defect of overlooking the fact that for Plutarch Stoicism was not a dead philosophy, " mais une pensee vivante a laquelle il a dfi confronter sa propre fagon de voir" (p. 17). In sum, Babut deals with Plutarch vis-a-vis Stoicism from its early period up to and including that of the early first century A. D. The over-all purpose of Babut's study is to understand not only the historical problem of Plutarch in relation to Stoicism, but also Plutarch's own thought. He writes: " c'est la pensee de Plutarque qui devrait en etre le centre et la fin, la relation avec le Portique n'etant qu'un moyen pour en faciliter la comprehension" (p. 12). Accordingly, the study is divided into two major parts: the first deals with the various connections between Plutarch and Stoicism ("Plutarque et le Portique," pp. 15-270); the second treats Plutarch's own thought in comparison with several essential Stoic themes (" Plutarque et la vision stoicienne du monde." pp. 271-527). The first part of the study is further divided into two books, entitled respectively "Le Stoicisme dans l'oeuvre de Plutarque" (pp. 19- 180) and "Les Stoiciens dans l'oeuvre de Plutarque" (pp. 181- 270). Babut justifies this latter division on the basis that Stoicism had a twofold aspect for Plutarch: (a) as a collection of ideas or themes transmitted by a literature and a tradition; and (b) as a living philosophy which he personally knew. The second feature is reflected by persons, real and fictional, in whom Plutarch dis- closes something of contemporary Stoicism. But consideration of individual Stoics cannot be limited to Plutarch's own period. He also mentions important past thinkers of the school, e.g. Zenn, Chrysippus, Posidonius. Hence, the need for a special consideration of the representatives of the Stoa mentioned by Plutarch. In general, the format of the book is clear and well organized. Moreover, Babut is careful to note his conclusions at the end of each chapter, and there is a summary conclusion at the end of the work (pp. 529-34). A "Table analytique des matieres" (pp. 589- 598) is especially helpful in providing summaries of the content and conclusions of individual chapters which are sometimes of considerable length, e. g. Chap. III of Bk. I is sixty-four pages. Babut also often presents his material in detail and with judicious- ness, the summaries sometimes being necessary for focusing the argument. In the first major part of the book, Babut concludes: (a) Plutarch was a determined adversary of Stoicism throughout his life; (b) this attitude contrasts with his general amiability toward con- temporary Stoics, and his lack of rivalry or spite toward them; 486</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS. (c) there is no reason to doubt Plutarch's knowledge or com- prehension of Stoicism. The ambiguity of his attitude toward this philosophy (a and b) can be clarified only by a comparison of the two systems of thought, and this is accomplished in Part Two where Babut argues: (a) Plutarch's general philosophical principles and views of the cosmos never coincide with, but oppose, those of the Stoics; (b) Plutarch's own views are defined by contrast to those of Stoicism; and (c) though Plutarch seems at times in formal accord with the Stoics, especially concerning religion, there are deep differences in their beliefs and spiritual attitudes, notably in connection with divine transcendence. In general, the Stoics are " adversaires privilegies" (p. 531), and it is not in eclecticism, but in Plutarch's opposition to this general tendency of his era, ready to confound views of the world as different as those of Stoicism and Platonism, that Plutarch's attitude toward Stoicism is ultimately discovered. Despite the persuasiveness of Babut's conclusions, there are some questionable procedures in his reconstruction of Plutarch's attitude toward Stoicism. For example, four pages are devoted to a dis- cussion of De fato (pp. 157-61), although Babut acknowledges "... peu de commentateurs defendent aujourd'hui l'authenticite ...." (p. 157). Babut's only defense for treating the work is found at the end of his discussion (p. 161): Sans pretendre trancher la question d'authenticite, contentons- nous de remarquer qu'il n'y a rien la qui contredise ce que nous savons de Plutarque, en particulier ce que nous avons appris de ses rapports avec la philosophie du Portique. No account is taken of the several convincing arguments against the authenticity of De fato, especially the complete neglect of hiatus (for a summary of the arguments, see K. Ziegler, " Plu- tarchos," R.-E., XXI [1951], col. 726). A similar problem arises in connection with Babut's discussion of De vita et poesi Homeri. Although Plutarch's authorship of this work cannot be denied categorically, Babut offers no decisive arguments for its genuineness. His justification for its treatment is that not only the material found in it is Plutarchan, but also "le mouvement de pensee" (see especially p. 161, n. 2), somewhat subjective or imprecise criteria for determining authenticity. In general, if one's purpose is to understand Plutarch and those works attributed to him without doubt, then strong arguments should be given for the genuineness of De fato and De vita et poesi Homeri, and this Babut fails to do. On the matter of Plutarch's knowledge of the works of individual Stoics, or sources for them, Babut's treatment is generally cautious and convincing. For example, in discussing De Stoic. rep., Babut presents perhaps as good a case as possible for concluding that Plutarch had firsthand acquaintance with several works of Chrysip- pus, and that his knowledge of Stoic texts was generally superior to what is often believed (see especially pp. 28-9). Still Pohlenz's suggestion that Plutarch was relying on an Academic work based 487</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. on Carneades' refutation of Chrysippus cannot be completely ruled out (see his "Plutarchs Schriften gegen die Stoiker," Hermes, LXXIV [1939], pp. 1-33). In a later discussion of Chrysippus, Babut adopts a somewhat questionable assumption, namely, that "la presence de Chrysippe dans l'oeuvre de Plutarque ne se limite certainement pas aux passages ou son nom est explicitement men- tionne" (p. 231). Whereas Chrysippus was probably for Plutarch and his contemporaries a Stoic representative " plus haute," a more circumspect methodological principle would be to assign nothing to Chrysippus unless Plutarch explicitly attributes a doctrine to him. Babut's treatment of Plutarch's knowledge of Posidonius is judi- cious. It is possible, for example, that several ideas of Posidonius are reflected in De facie in orbe lunae, but, according to Babut, the importance of these has been " exagere," and in any case, it is impossible to view the entire dialogue as being influenced by Posidonius (pp. 126-7). Similarly, Babut maintains that there is no proof that Plutarch had direct access to the philosophical and scientific work of Posidonius. His conclusions concerning Zeno, however, seem less satisfactory, for although Babut shows that Plutarch's numerous allusions to Zeno are often not very important philosophically, e. g. anecdotal and apothegmatic, and that "nous ne savons pas s'il lisait directement ces ouvrages de Zenon" (p. 223), e.g. IIepL 7roL0r7LK?7 aKpoao-ews, he nevertheless concludes ". . que Plutarque ait eu directement acces a l'oeuvre du fondateur du Portique, c'est, en effet, ce qu'on ne saurait exclure pour plusieurs livres . . ." (p. 225), e. g. IIept 7ror7LtKr acKpaoa-eWc. In short, after almost ruling out that Plutarch had any important, firsthand knowl- edge of Zeno's works, Babut seems to persist in thinking that Plutarch may have had direct access to some of them. In his dis- cussion of Plutarch's sources for Zeno and other Stoics, Babut takes little or no account of Plutarch's use of " notebooks " (v'rouvx 'aTa). He refers to these once (see p. 73, n. 1 on 464F), but perhaps more consideration of the use of "notebooks" would have en- hanced Babut's discussion of sources (see H. Martin, Jr., A.J.P., XC [1969], p. 186). In the second major part of the book, Babut usually treats Stoicism as a whole. His discussion of the similarities and con- trasts between Plutarch and Stoicism on metaphysics, ethics, and religion is generally informative and well presented. In some re- spects, this part is more readable than the first owing to the sys- tematic nature of the subject matter. Especially important is Babut's discussion of ethics, which for Plutarch and the Stoics was the center of philosophy. Despite this and other similarities, Babut convincingly argues against Zeller's view that Plutarch's ethics was "ein gemilderter Stoizismus" (" un stoicism adouci" ; see pp. 318 f.). At the same time, Babut succeeds in harmonizing Plutarch's seemingly incoherent views on a7rdOeLa, using their anti-Stoic char- acter as a starting point (see pp. 329 f.). The chapter on religion is also well done and makes perhaps a good supplement to Nilsson's treatment of Plutarch in Gesch. der griech. Rel., II 2 (Munich, 1961). Whether Babut succeeds, however, in showing that Plutarch " va plus loin que les Stoiciens dans sa critique de l'anthropomorphisme " 488</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS. (p. 444), is questionable. What Babut seems to have in mind concerns strictly the Stoics' and Plutarch's conceptions of deity. Despite their differences on the divine nature, both rejected anthropomorphism. In conclusion, Babut is to be commended for treating a large and complex subject with care and in detail. The book is a mine of useful information, and though it will probably have primary interest for students of Plutarch, it should also have attrait for those of Stoicism. The notes usually contain references to the most recent work on Plutarch, though it is unclear why Babut refers to Ziegler's 1949 edition of Plutarchos and not to that in B.-E., XII, 1951. Greek is used intelligently, the text sometimes quoted in full, usually in the footnotes. The book contains a selective bibliography, indices locorum et nominum, and an unbound list of addenda et corrigenda. There are, however, two uncorrected misprints: on p. 367, line 12 read "l'alliance" instead of "'lalliance" ; on p. 538 in the title of Hadzsits' article read "first" instead of "fisrt." JACKSON P.

Short books should get short reviews; it will therefore save space to refer to two competent reviewers (M. Ostwald, C. W., LXIV [1971], pp. 164-5; A. Boegehold, A. H. R., LXXVI [1971], p. 752) who have pointed out both the importance of the oath in antiquity and the need for an up-to-date, comprehensive account of the subject and then gone on to show that Oath and Perjury fails to fill that need, and that Plescia has, among other things, garbled the Greek sources, misrepresented institutions, and given imprecise references and wrong spellings of terms and names. This is, unfortunately, all true, but it would not suffice just to add further examples of such faults, though they are not far to seek: to Ostwald's list of misspellings one could add Cirrhae (p. 62), Orpheism (p. 88), and Antiochus (p. 68, for Antiochis); to Boegehold's list of misrepresented institutions, the contorted account of the diaitetai (p. 37); and within the first four pages one meets at least two examples of fractured Greek: the extraordinary notion (p. 2) that the phrase epi martyroi exists, and means "sureties" as distinct from " witnesses," and the rendering of Ne Dia (p. 4) as "Yes, by God" which obscures the fact that we are dealing with 489</page></plain_text>
