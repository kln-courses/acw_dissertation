<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IDEA OF GOD IN HINDUISM A. S. WOODBURNE Madras Christian College, Madras, India This article is the outcome of discussions with students in India who found diffi- culty in apprehending the Christian conception of God. It presents for Western readers those aspects of the idea of God which are characteristic of Hinduism. First is set forth the majestic conception of Brahman, the All-creator. Then the aspirations of practical faith as satisfied by Vishpiu and 8iva are considered. The idea of God is the pivotal doctrine in any religion. The whole fabric of religious beliefs rests on that basis. If one understands what a people thinks about God, he will be able to formulate a pretty clear conception of their thoughts about man, evil, salvation, and the future life. For many of these beliefs are inevitably subsidiary to the doctrine of God. One of the corollaries of that truth is that a discussion of the doctrine of God unavoidably leads one to include matters which in a sys- tematic treatise might seem to belong rather under one of the other captions of theology. In attempting to summarize some of the important elements in the Hindu idea of God, it ought first to be said that it would be more correct to speak of Hindu ideas of God, for the history of that religion, like the history of Christianity and of other faiths, discloses an astonishingly large variety of ideas. Poly- theism, henotheism, pantheism, and monotheism are all to be found within Hinduism, so that a thoroughgoing treatment of Hindu theology from the historical viewpoint would be a task for a corps of scholars who could devote years to the study. There is always the danger, in attempting to delineate the characteristics of any phase of Hindu thought and practice, that someone else will arise and say that it is quite unfair. The present article is concerned only with indicating some developments of the idea of God current among Hindus today with particular reference to the problem of personality. 52</page><page sequence="2">THE IDEA OF GOD IN HINDUISM 53 I It may be said without much fear of contradiction that the majority of educated Hindus are adherents of the Advaita Vedanta, that is, the non-dualistic Vedanta as interpreted by ?ankara. The particular scriptures on which this teaching is founded are the Upanishads, which are known as the "end of the Veda." According to this doctrine, the Brahman is all in all. It is that mysterious cosmic power which emanates from everything associated with the cult. To begin with, it was the spoken hymn or magical formula, from which it came to signify the power inherent in the hymn or prayer. Then, when the sacrifice displaced the hymn, Brahman came to signify the power in the sacrifice which, being considered the most potent force in the universe, readily provided a word to signify cosmic energy. So Brahman came to be the term of all-inclusive con- notation which it is today, the word which signifies the supreme reality. To be sure, the whole course which metaphysics takes in its speculations regarding the character of the Brahman has a bearing on the development of religious ideas, since in the adva- ita thought the Absolute is God. But two or three points in particular are deserving of notice because of their present-day functional importance. These are (i) the relation between Brahman and atman, (2) the relation between Brahman and the material world, and (3) the extent of our knowledge of and ability to describe the Brahman. Since reality is one, it is obvious that the relationship be- tween the atman (the self or individual soul) and the Brahman (the world soul) must be one of identity. But the word atman from referring to the individual soul came to be applied to the inner spirit of the universe. This was the intermediary stage to an identification with Brahman. A score of references could be given in the Upanishads in support of this doctrine, e.g., in Brihaddran.yaka 2.5.1 we have the succession of synonyms: "this soul (atman), this immortal, this Brahman, this All." The two great conceptions, Brahman attained cosmologically and</page><page sequence="3">54 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Jtman attained psychologically, are thus merged and the words used interchangeably. This carries with it the necessity of viewing the individual soul also as a piece of reality. That which you call the self or individuality is indeed the world-soul within one's self. The great desideratum is to transcend the apparent duality of the self and not-self, or the apparent plural- ity of subject and objects. This seeming plurality is only an illusion, and most of the ills to which man is heir may be traced to ignorance of this great truth about reality. The Chandogya Upanishad contains the famous passage wherein 8vetaketu is instructed by his father Uddalaka concerning the key to all knowledge. The teacher makes use of one parable after anoth- er that illustrates natural forces such as heat and digestion, and then tells his pupil that he must think of himself as identical with each one. "Believe me, my dear, that which is the first essence, this world has that (truth) as its soul. That is Reality. That is atman (soul). That thou art (tat twam asi), 8vetaketu."' According to this doctrine, religion has sometimes been defined as the realization of the divinity already in man. Since the self is a manifestation of reality, self-realization is equiva- lent to realizing the divine nature of which one is a partaker. The goal of all our striving should thus be so to chasten the mind that one may achieve an indissoluble union with Brahman. Only thus can the shackles of karma and sainsara be broken, and the dtman attain moksha or liberation. It will be apparent that the religious appeal of such a doctrine is the appeal of mysticism. The mystic everywhere conceives of God as amen- able to intimate social relations with men, on the basis of which he strives for a life that is hid or absorbed in the divine life of the universe. It is not surprising that it makes a powerful appeal to the religious consciousness of the philosophically minded Hindu. As Professor Radhakrishnan says: Nature summons us to the spiritual reality of life and answers the needs of the soul. .... From the beginning of reflection this oneness of ' Sixth Prapathaka, Hume's translation.</page><page sequence="4">THE IDEA OF GOD IN HINDUISM 55 subject and object, the existence of one central reality, pervading and embracing all, has been the doctrine of the devout. Religious mysticism and deep piety witness to the truth of the great saying, "That thou art," "Tat tvam asi."' What is the relation of Brahman to the material world? It is quite commonly supposed that the answer of the Upanishads to that question is pantheism, and there are many passages which seem to justify the conclusion. For example, in Chindo- gya 3.14 we read: Verily this whole world is Brahman. Tranquil, let one worship it as that from which he came forth, as that into which he will be dissolved, as that in which he breathes. .... He who consists of mind, whose body is light, whose conception is truth, whose soul (atman) is space, containing all works, containing all desires, containing all odors, containing tastes, encompassing this whole world, the unspeaking, the unconcerned, .... that is the Soul of mine within the heart, this is Brahman. Other interpreters of the Upanishads find more than one doc- trine as to the relation between God and the world, while still others deny that they teach pure pantheism. About one mat- ter they seem to be in agreement, namely, that Brahman is the genesis of life in all living beings, the principle of unity in all apparent multiplicity. He is essential to the existence of the world, yet not in the relation of cause to effect or creator to creation. He exists in the world and yet should not be identi- fied with it, since that would reduce him to its limits and rob him of his transcendence. He exists in the world, nevertheless is capable of existence apart from the world or of relationships. He is self-sufficient. Deussen has taken the prevailing view of the Upanishads to be that the Brahman only is real, and consequently that there is no material world, but that what appears to us as phenomenal world is maya or illusion. Das Gupta seems to follow the same interpretation: All creation is mayd. .... In reality all creation is illusory and as the creator also is illusory. Brahman is at once the material cause as well as the efficient cause of the world. There is no difference between the 1 Indian Philosophy, I, 170.</page><page sequence="5">56 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION cause and the effect, and the effect is but an illusory imposition on the cause-a mere illusion of name and form. .... This world, inasmuch as it is but an effect imposed upon the Brahman, is only phenomenally existent as mere objects of name and form, but the cause, the Brahman, is also the true reality.' In his recent work on Indian Philosophy, Radhakrishnan takes exception to this view on the ground that the Upanishads never make the infinite exclude the finite. "Wherever they assert that Brahman is the sole reality, they are careful enough to add that the world is rooted in Brahman, and as such has a share in reality" (p. 190). So he argues that the Upanishadic idea of God is not pantheistic, because in that case the nature of the absolute would be completely exhausted by the course of the world: The Upanishads declare that the universe is in God, but they never hold that the universe is God. God is greater than the universe, which is his work. He is as much and more beyond this, as the human personality is beyond the body, which is the instrument of its life here. They refuse to imprison God in the world. .... God expresses himself in the world, and the world is the expression of his life ..... God is transcendent as well as immanent.2 There is no doubt that something should be said for the protest of Radhakrishnan against the ordinary interpretation. The Upanishads certainly teach a doctrine of immanence, but that should not blind us to what they have to say about transcendence. The world is thought of as an expression of Brahman, and the Brahman is immanent in it. But it is he that is the intelligent source, the reality behind all appearances. Illusion is the mistaking of the world of appearances for the Real. "This soul of mine within the heart is greater than the earth, greater than the atmosphere, greater than the sky, greater than all worlds . . . . this is the Brahman. Into him I shall enter on departing hence."3 "Over both the perish- able and the soul the One God rules. By meditation upon I History of Indian Philosophy, I, 438-39. 2 Op. cit., pp. 202-3. 3 Chandogya 3.14. 3,4.</page><page sequence="6">THE IDEA OF GOD IN HINDUISM 57 him, by union with him, and by entering into his being more and more, there is finally cessation from every illusion. ..... The Eternal shall be known as present in the self. Truly there is nothing higher than that to be so known. When one recognizes the enjoyer, the object of enjoyment, and the univer- sal actuator, all has been said. This is the threefold Brah- man."' It is such passages as the foregoing which teach a doctrine of transcendence which is sometimes neglected. Yet we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that there are other passages which, taken at face value, certainly speak the lan- guage of pantheism. "Verily, the whole world is Brahman."2 "Brahman indeed is the whole world."3 "Truly everything here is Brahman."4 The question resolves itself into whether or not the pantheistic conception is the dominant one in the Upanishads, and concerning that there is no unanimity. There are those who deny it, and others who insist upon it, which seems to be very good evidence that either position can be substantiated by reference to the text. A third problem which follows is the problem as to the extent of our knowledge of and our ability to describe the Brah- man. One of the most insistent beliefs is a belief in the trans- cendence of the Brahman over all limitations. Any quality whatsoever which would appear to be a curtailing of the infinity of God is to be strenuously opposed. For this reason, the whole question of the knowledge of God is open to criticism. If we say we know God, knowledge suggests the employment of sensory or ideational processes. And God is too high either to be sensed or thought or taught. "There the eye goes not, speech goes not, nor the mind. We know not, we understand not how one would teach it. Other is it indeed than the known, and moreover above the unknown."5 There is a suggestion in some of the Upanishads that is akin to the Christian idea that the way to God is the way of faith rather than of knowl- ' 8vetaSvatara I. 10,12. 2 Chandogya 3.14.

They who know him with heart and mind as abiding in the heart, become immortal."' "They who, possessing faith, make oblation of themselves . . . . to them indeed one may declare the knowledge of Brahman." If knowledge itself is a limitation, it is because the knowledge is incomplete, is adulterated by ignorance. But the real knowledge, the knowledge of the Real, is man's supreme need. Such knowledge so transcends all other knowledge as to make it appear to be the darkness of ignorance. For knowledge that is imperfect is even worse than a sincere confes- sion of ignorance. Though Brahman is utterly inconceivable, yet, paradoxically enough, the knowledge of him should be the goal of all our endeavor. One is reminded of the New Testa- ment phrase, "to know the love of God that passeth knowl- edge." It is the longing and language of the mystic who seeks to fathom the unfathomable and comprehend the incompre- hensible by way of the heart when the head has failed. Such is the knowledge which results in the ineffable union of the mystic with the object of his faith. "This has been sung as the supreme Brahman. In it there is a triad (the world, the indi- vidual soul, and the cosmic soul). It is the firm support, the Imperishable. By knowing what is therein, Brahman-knowers become merged in Brahman intent thereon, liberated from rebirth. .... By knowing God one is released from all fet- ters."3 The effort to emphasize the illimitability of the Brahman has resulted in a good many descriptions of a negative charac- ter. The idea seems to be that a positive characterization would be a limitation, and that consequently a negative ex- presses the opposite. So we have such negations used as the following: "invisible, ungraspable, familyless, casteless, without sight or hearing, without hand or foot, imperishable" ;4 "sound- 1 8vetdSvatara 4. 20o. 2 MuJ4daka 3.2.10. 3 9vetagvatara I. 7,8. 4 Mu4gdaka i.1.6.</page><page sequence="8">THE IDEA OF GOD IN HINDUISM 59 less, touchless, formless, imperishable, tasteless, odorless, begin- ningless, endless";' "void of any mark (alinga)"; "void of qual- ities (nirguna)";3 "indemonstrable, spotless, beyond space";4 "endless, without an earlier and without a later, without an inside and without an outside";5 "imperishable, not coarse, not fine, not short, not long, not glowing (like fire), not adhesive (like water), without shadow and without darkness, without air and without space, without stickiness, intangible, odorless, tasteless, without eye, without ear, without voice, without wind, without energy, without breath, without mouth, without personal or family name, unaging, undying, without fear, immortal, stainless, not uncovered, not covered, without measure, without inside, without outside, unconsuming and unconsumable";6 "limitless in every direction, incomprehen- sible, unlimited, unborn, not to be reasoned about, unthink- able";7 "the unspeaking, the unconcerned."' So the Brahman is portrayed as free from every differentiating quality, free from every limitation of sense perception, free from every conceivable property that the human consciousness might ascribe to it. To every suggestion of a qualification which might be made, there is but one possible response: "Neti, neti," "Not this, not this," "for there is nothing higher than this (negative definition) that he is thus."' We have here the reason why many Hindus quite object to any attempt at defining God. To attempt a description of God is indicative of failure to appreciate the most elementary truth about him, namely, that he is inconceivable and undefin- able, that he is beyond human knowledge because he is illimit- able and infinite. The Hindu criticism of the Christian and Islamic doctrines of God is precisely from this viewpoint, that 1 Katha 3. 15. 2 Katha 6.8. 3 gvetAgvatara 6. 11. 4 Brihaddranyaka 4.4.20. s Ibid., 2.5.19. 6 Ibid., 3. 8.8. 7 Maitri 6.17. 8 Chndogya 3.14.2. 9 Brihaddranyaka 2.3.6.</page><page sequence="9">60 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the Hindu is convinced that Christian and Muslim attempts are limiting God, are making of him something finite and smaller than he is, that they display a lack of appreciation of the most elementary principle of the Deity-his indescribability. Chris- tian philosophy is sure that in ascribing personality to God it is crediting him with the highest conceivable value. Hinduism agrees with Christianity in recognizing that God belongs to the realm of value. Belief in God is even more of a value judgment than an existence judgment. But the Hindu parts company with the Christian in what constitutes the higher values. The Hindu believes that illimitability is a higher value than personality. But the Hindu idea of God recognizes at the same time that there must be some positive content. The thought of an unthinkable, the concept of an inconceivable is too high for our practical religious needs. There is a "lower" type of knowledge as well as the "higher." There "is both the higher and the lower Brahman."' The higher is above the plane of human thought, limitation, and change; the lower belongs to the mundane world. As Isvara he creates, sustains, and destroys the universe. "There are assuredly two forms of Brahman: Time and Timeless. That which is prior to the sun is the Timeless, without parts. But that which begins with the sun is Time, which has parts ..... "0 The lower Brahman is thus phenomenal, with sense qualities. The passages in which the doctrine of two Brahmans occur are all in the later Upanishads, and the reconciliation is effected by declaring that Reality is one, and the manifoldness is appearance or illusion (mdyd). It is fairly obvious that the authors of the later Upanishads had come to recognize a psychological fact which in our time is common property. We human beings are limited in our think- ing to the use of images, symbols, or anthropomorphisms. The stuff of thought is imagery. We have no equipment, either native or acquired, for thinking without some sort of symbol, I Pragna 5.2 ff. 2Maitri 6.15, 22.</page><page sequence="10">THE IDEA OF GOD IN HINDUISM 61 visual, auditory, verbal, or what not. To think of God at all means that we must have recourse to our own experiences for imagery. If thinking our best thoughts about God is to limit him, then it is inevitable that we should limit him. Yet surely none of us imagines that he has exhausted the thought of God by his thinking. The apparent duality which the authors of the later Upanishads recognized is this: we recognize that thinking of God implies the use of limiting categories, yet we insist that he transcends our best thoughts. The whole fabric of religion is social. We cannot pray, offer votive gifts, sacri- fices, praise, or worship without personalizing God. The essence of religion is communion with the universe conceived as amenable to social relations. "Except for a few excessively logical people who wish to push their principles to their extreme conclusions, there cannot be a religion without a personal God. Even the philosopher when asked to define the highest reality cannot but employ terms which reduce it to the lower level."' In spite, then, of the protest on the part of the philoso- phically minded that personality implies a limitation which he is unwilling to make in his thought of God, the Hindu does personalize God when he worships. If personality means an anthropomorphic realism, then Christian and Hindu alike would regret the concept. If it be an ideal with untold possi- bilities, if it be a sharing between man and God, between jivdtman and paramdtman, of ideals and tasks that are cosmic, there is no reason why both may not agree to it. For assuredly both insist that to God must be ascribed the highest conceivable value to the nth power, and that even that does not exhaust him. II The Advaita Veddnta of Sankara portrays the Brahman as the philosophical Absolute rather than as the God of reli- gious faith. Though the Hindu speaks much of the Brahman in this speculative way, the object of his devotion is very I Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy, p. 97.</page><page sequence="11">62 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION seldom Brahman. As a god of religion, Brahman is regarded as the Creator, and along with him two other deities arose to whom were ascribed some of his attributes, and who have become the objects of worship: Vishnu and Siva. A tradition has been current for some years that there is one and only one temple in the whole of India dedicated to Brahman, but it is now known that there are several more. Nevertheless, the number of such temples or of inscriptions is small. There are a few, however, like that near Jubbulpore, Central Provinces: "Let us adore Him who is knowledge and bliss, the Supreme Brahman, .... the Great God, the God of Gods, the Parent of the world."' But the general feeling is that in his creative activity, Brahman completed his work, so that worship is super- fluous. "Men worship ?iva the Destroyer because they fear him; Vishnu the Preserver because they hope from him; but who worships Brahman the Creator? His work is done."2 Notwithstanding the absence of any extensive cult of Brahman, yet he is revered as the tutelary deity over sacrifices on several occasions, including weddings and funerals, when he is repre- sented by a Brahman priest, to whom prayers are made for protection, property, and health. In the later Upanishads, IJvara is represented as the active side of Brahman. Even in the earlier Upanishads there is a practical identification, e.g., in Brihaddranyaka I.4. Io,II, where Brahman is made to say, "Whoever worships another divinity (than his self), thinking, 'He is one and I another,' he knows not." Among the gods who are named as manifestations is Igvana, the equivalent of IEvara, meaning "Lord." A pas- sage in the Svetdsvatara illustrates the later development: "Higher than this is Brahman. The Supreme, the Great, hid- den in all things body by body, the One embracer of the uni- verse, by knowing him as Lord (I-) men become immortal. I know this mighty Person (Purusha). .... Only by knowing I Epigraphia Indica, II, I9. 2 Quoted by Carpenter, Theism in Medieval India, p. 192.</page><page sequence="12">THE IDEA OF GOD IN HINDUISM 63 him does one pass over death" (3-7.8.). ISvara is thus identi- fied with the lower form in the doctrine of the two Brahmans, and is described as active in creation, preservation, and destruc- tion.' These are the activities that become divided among the trimiirti, Brahman being Creator, Vishnu Preserver, and 8iva Destroyer, three forms of the one Supreme. It is not surprising that we should find tendencies to identify Vishnu and Giva, especially in the earlier periods of their importance, with Brahman. Even the qualityless (nirgunca) Brahman is identified with 8iva, who has been portrayed as Creator and Father of the world, though he also employs Brah- man in creation. Vishnu also has been adored as the soul of all things, the immanent power who is in everything, including the human soul. So that the rise of cults of Vishnu and Siva does not mean necessarily a departure from monism, for many who are religiously adherents either of Vaishnavism or 8aivism are philosophically monists. The rise of Vaishnavism and 8aivism may be said to be due to the failure of the transcendental monism which many found in the Upanishads to satisfy their religious needs. It was too cold and speculative, and religion needs the warm atmosphere of prayer and devotion for its life. It is not possible for the religious consciousness to find any satisfaction in abstractions, be they ever so lofty. Religion finds its source in a feeling of need and dependence, and, no matter how cultured the people who are religious, there never ceases to be an element of emotion. And emotion feeds upon the intimacy of personal relationships. Radhakrishnan is profoundly right: "We cannot love a shadow of our minds. Personality implies a capacity for fellowship, or communion, or a feeling together."2 Metaphysics and religion have certain interests in common, and metaphysics and theology have still more. Nevertheless it is to religion rather than metaphysics that men turn when they need to describe God; religion seeks to establish a commun- SPragna 5.2.7. 2 Indian Philosophy, I, 559.</page><page sequence="13">64 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ion between God and man. Metaphysics may posit an Abso- lute; religion makes him relative to man's deepest needs. Met- aphysics deals in abstract speculations; religion establishes a great personal relationship. The rise of Vaishnavism and Saiv- ism in Hinduism was as inevitable as the advent of the Mahaya- na Buddhism. Both were due to the failure of metaphysics to satisfy the hunger of the human heart for divine communion and help. Both were a protest against what William James described as the right of any pretended logic to deny men the right to faith in God. gankara, the great advaita interpreter of the Upanishads, was religiously a Saivite. Tradition has it that he himself was an incarnation of Siva, the means which that deity adopted for the resuscitation of Hinduism. He taught an esoteric doctrine of Brahman as nirgunza, and an exoteric doctrine of Brahman as sagunta. The higher knowledge is knowledge of the qualityless one; the lower knowledge is of Brahman in its phenomenal manifestation. Under the latter he found a place for the exer- cise of religion, including the worship of a personal God and even of idols. Worshipers of a personal God are really worship- ing Brahman in its phenomenal manifestation, and idols are symbols for those who cannot attain the comprehension of the higher Brahman. It happens that the great majority of San- kara's followers are 8aivites. There does not seem to be any sufficient reason, other than tradition, why those who hold the advaita doctrine might not have been Vaishnavites just as well as 8aivites. But long associations have determined it to be otherwise. When Saivism arose, there were ready those who desired to identify Siva with Brahman as the Creator, or to say that Siva employed Brahman for creative activity. Professor Carpenter quotes the poet Sripdla: "I will praise that will power of the Lord of the worlds (Siva) on whom the silent seekers after salvation meditate as on the advaita Brahman, which playing with new mundane eggs-producing and destroy- ing them at their times--ever amusing itself according to its</page><page sequence="14">THE IDEA OF GOD IN HINDUISM 65 desire."' The Siva of this new cult is quite another figure from the Rudra of Vedic times from whom he came. Rudra was the personification of the destructive powers of nature, and Siva became the Destroyer in the trimfirti God. But Siva means "auspicious," and in modern aivism is a divine Person filled with beauty, power, wisdom, grace, and benignity. It was in the Tamil country pre-eminently that this cult of Siva, the personal God, the gracious Lord and Protector, attained its finest expressions. The hymns of the Tamil 8aivite saints portray a depth of emotion and a height of devotion that is seldom surpassed. They are among the sublimest reaches of the followers of the bhakti-marga. The rise of Vaishnavism presents many parallels to the origin of Saivism. Vishnu is worshiped monotheistically as a personal God, even as Siva. In both cases worship is depicted as spiritual, and rising high above mere ceremonialism and dogmatism. The imperishable Vishnu, as the auspicious Giva, is identified with Brahman. And salvation (moksha) is attained through devotion to the Deity. Vaishnavism also gave birth to a devotional literature paralleling Saivism, and the hymns of the Alvars were full of passionate devotion as well as moral wisdom. It was in association with Vishnu that the doctrine of the various incarnations (avataras) arose, so that when cults of Rama and Krishna sprang up, these were natu- rally regarded as types of Vaishnavism. As gankara was a gaivite, so Ramanuja was a Vaishnavite, and for traditional reasons the followers of his school of philosophy-qualified non-duality (ViSishtadvaita Vedanta)-have been mostly Vaish- navites. Ramanuja was a mystic as well as a philosopher, and was more concerned with giving a philosophic basis to religion than was 8ankara. At the same time he shared in 8ankara's desire to give an authoritative basis to his teaching, the authority being the Upanishads or end of the Veda (Ve- danta).

Critical Hindus sometimes affirm that the idea of personality in God involves a limitation. It has been the object of this brief sketch to show that Hinduism itself could not escape from thinking of God as a Person. There is undoubtedly a confusion in the minds of some between the Absolute of metaphysics (nirguna Brahman) and the God of religion (sagunta Brahman). The everlasting problem of the monist is to show that there is no ultimate duality between the two. And the religious con- sciousness is not to be considered the counterpart of a meta- physical consciousness in a dualistic human mind. Neverthe- less, it is not to metaphysics but to religion that man turns in the time of his greatest needs. He longs for a converse, a fel- lowship with a Power greater than himself, and by faith and devotion (bhakti) he reaches out for God. The hymns of the gaivite and Vaishnavite saints reiterate the common experience of man, that when he seeks for God, he finds God already seeking for him. Religion is social. It is fellowship, commun- ion. It must have a personal God. And Hinduism is no exception.</page></plain_text>
