<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion Among American Indians By RUTH UNDERHILL Abstract: The primitive religious ideas of the American Indians. their ritual- istic forms, their social function, and their chief practitioners are described in this article. The persistence of these ideas and the manner in which they affect the Indian's acceptance of the white man's ways are illustrated. Special atten- tion is paid to the rise of the Peyote Cult and its development into the Native American Church, which appears to be a transitional institution ultimately lead- ing to the acceptance of the white man's religion.-Ed. THE American Indian of pre-Colum- bian days, at least the male, spent much of his time and effort in activity involving the supernatural. With little knowledge of natural science or medi- cine, with small acquaintance with other peoples outside a few neighboring friends or enemies, a large section of his world was unknown, mysterious, and, possibly, threatening. His techniques for dealing with this unknown, which he conceived as supernatural, I shall speak of as re- ligion. Few groups had any consistent the- ology. Their interest was in action which would secure health and pros- perity and protect them from danger. Explanations of the spirit world for the average man might be fragmentary and even contradictory, although, as Radin has pointed out, there was usually a group of thinkers who strove toward greater consistency and understanding.1 Nor had the spirit world much connec- tion with ethics. It is true that in ad- vanced cultures like that of the Pueblos and their pupils, the Navahos, there was an emphasis on peacefulness for those en- gaged in religious activity. Even there, Paul Radin, The World of Primitive Man (New York: Henry Schuman, 1953), pp. 37 ff. however, such offenses against society as murder, theft, lying, greed, adultery and so forth were dealt with by the family or council. Only when a group became so large and mixed that these local agen- cies lost their effectiveness did the priest take over with his threat of supernatural punishment. Such a situation was rare in any group north of Mexico. The spirits did indeed punish, but not for what a modern would call sins against society. What drew their wrath was a breach of taboo, such as failure to per- form a ceremony correctly or disobedi- ence to ceremonial rules concerning a mother-in-law or a woman in childbirth. Such emphasis on ceremonial regulations is a familiar stage of religious develop- ment, long known in the Old World. PRE-COLUMBIAN RELIGIONS In sketching the religious attitudes of Indians in North America, I shall use the past tense. It is true that many of these attitudes and usages developed from them are still in force. However, many have been given up and many have changed, either in historic times or recently. Therefore, my attempt in the first part of this paper is to outline early religious attitudes. One may see Ruth M. Underhill, Ph.D., Denver, Colorado, a lecturer and writer, is Emeritus Pro- fessor of Anthropology, University of Denver and member of the faculty of New York State Teachers College. She was a Supervisor of Indian Education, U. S. Indian Service. Her latest publication is Red Man's America (1953). 127</page><page sequence="2">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY that even through changes, much of their essence has persisted. Mana and taboo Most Indian religious attitudes have worldwide counterparts, and some seem so fundamental that they may have been brought by the first paleolithic immi- grants. Among these are the concepts of mana and taboo.2 The Melanesian word mana has been standardized by anthropologists to refer to a widespread primitive belief in some invisible force pervading the universe. It can be focused on any object, animate or in- animate, endowing that object, for the time being, with supernatural power. Sacred places, objects used in ceremony. or human beings under certain circum- stances can be imbued with this power. The Siouan word wakan, the Iroquoian orenda and the Algonquian manitou all refer to it, and many other tribes have the concept if not the name. As a corollary, the focus of power was dangerous to one not in a sacred state. This is the familiar concept of taboo which is as worldwide as that of mana. It regards the focus of power as untouchable. not because it is unclean, but because it belongs to the supernatu- ral world with which contact may be dangerous. To meet the situation, an age-old technique has been developed whose remnants are visible even among modern people. Briefly, it requires that anyone who has been in contact with a supernatural power, either voluntarily or involuntarily, must negate the danger by withdrawing both from human society and from bodily activity. As inter- preted by various Indian groups, this can mean seclusion; fasting; abstaining from speech. sleep, looking at the sun or at fire. touching the head (the most 2See among others, Rafael Karsten, The Origins of Religion (London: K. Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., 1935), pp. 30-31, 66. important part of the body), or touch- ing the lips with water. The life crises This technique, in whole or in part, was used by many Indian groups at the life crises of birth, puberty, and death. These were occasions when an uncon- trollable biological event swooped in to affect human life. Those under its in- fluence were considered subject to super- natural power, and they practised the techniques which would keep them safe and also keep others safe from them. Such an attitude was found most often in the food gathering and hunting groups where organization was simple. With ag- ricultural groups, who had a wealth of ceremonies, the seclusion rules, especially those for women, were often obscured or omitted. Here we must differentiate between girls' and boys' puberty. The acknowl- edgment of maturity for boys, as we shall see below, is usually accompanied with ordeals and initiations undertaken on the boy's own initiative. A girl's pu- berty, without any effort on her part. fits her to perform the miracle of child- birth. The menstruant and the partu- rient are considered under such strong supernatural influence that. unless they withdraw, they would be in danger themselves and would certainly bring danger to men. This attitude is par- ticularly true of the hunting and food- gathering groups. On the Northwest coast. a girl's withdrawal at puberty might last for months and might in- clude the use of a scratching stick and drinking tube to avoid touching hair or lips. With some California groups, as in parts of South America and the Basque region of Europe, the husband was considered so intimately connected with his wife that, after childbirth, he, too, must abstain from action. There is no theology involved in this behavior. No priest or medicine man 128</page><page sequence="3">RELIGION AMONG AMERICAN INDIANS needs to participate, for the so-called purification which sometimes follows seclusion does not always take place. Various statements are made as to dis- eases or misfortunes which may follow if the woman fails to withdraw, but they are not always the same. They seem to belong to an elementary system of magic unconnected with the spirit world. They coexist with various ideas about gods and spirits and are uncon- nected and unexplained. With some older Indians, these ideas about women's seclusion are still in force. One reason for their fear of hos- pitals is the fact that the white nurses are known never to seclude themselves. A male patient cannot tell when they may be spreading supernatural danger. Even converts to Christianity find the taboo hard to forget. I remember a young woman who refused to teach her Sunday School class during her periods because of danger to her boy pupils. I also remember a man with important matters to put before his local council who could not attend because his wife had just given birth. Withdrawal in some degree was prac- tised by the bereaved after a death. and sometimes by enemy slayers, murderers, even whale killers. Here there is an ex- planation. There is danger from the soul of the departed which either wishes to take a loved one with it for company or to injure its killer. Here is the be- ginning of a theory about the super- natural which is different from the pure magic of the restrictions at childbirth. It seems possible to me that, early though such theories are shown to be, the withdrawal at childbirth, uncon- nected with any spirit, may antedate them. The spirits A belief in spirits and a purposeful attempt to conciliate them is found in every Indian tribe. Spirits of the dead. just mentioned, did not play the all-im- portant part sometimes found in the Old World. True, some far western tribes imagined them as stealing the souls of the living and so causing illness. A few thought of them as acting the part of guardian spirits, and others conceived of them as reincarnated in children. As a rule, it was thought that the average dead person existed in the afterworld only until the last person who remem- bered him on earth was gone. A few might be elevated to powerful spirits or gods. This afterworld was a shadowy place to which both good and bad went indis- criminately. Days of withdrawal were often observed by mourners or corpse handlers while souls were supposedly on their journey thither, and they were supplied with food for this journey. Some tribes also supplied their dead with goods to keep them contented so they would not return. To this end, too, their dwellings were often destroyed and their names never mentioned. This belief and practices cause difficulty for Indians in going to hospitals, for many have died there, but the building stands replete with supernatural danger. They also make it difficult for white men tak- ing census because names of the dead must not be mentioned. Other spirits were those of animals, plants, and natural phenomena. To most Indians, there was no sharp divid- ing line between these and human be- ings. The Sioux spoke of all living things as the two-leggeds, the four- leggeds, and the wingeds. All these had life and must be treated as fellow be- ings. So must even the plants and Mother Earth who bore them. A Co- manche on being urged to plow and reap objected: "Shall I stab my Moth- er's breast and cut my Mother's hair!" True, agricultural tribes did dig the earth, but usually they had a tradition of a supernatural visitant, perhaps the 129</page><page sequence="4">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY corn plant, which had bidden them do so. Every act connected with planting was a religious ceremony. Every wild thing, too, was treated with considera- tion. The Papago woman asked per- mission of the plants which she plucked for basketry. The Zuni apologized to the deer he killed. Although it is hard to reconcile this attitude with the life of the hunter who killed for a living, there was a sav- ing explanation. The plant or animal eaten was only an outward form as- sumed by an immortal spirit. When that was consumed, the spirit returned to its home. If it had been well treated, by way of ceremony and proper dis- posal of the remains, it would return in a new dress to serve man again. To this end, seal bladders and salmon bones were thrown into the sea, so that they might return to the seal and salmon vil- lages. Deer horns and buffalo heads were kept in a sacred place. The vari- ous "first fruits" ceremonies for plant and animal foods were an example of respect shown to what must be used. Sometimes mana was thought to be concentrated in a particular representa- tive of a genus; the Algonquians be- lieved in an Owner for each sort of ani- mal. On parts of the Northwest coast, the belief was that the animals, which were so much better able to get food than primitive man, had once owned the earth. They had their present charac- ters but could take human form when they wished. In fact, they can do so still, and thus they appeared to fortu- nate visionaries. A number of tribes believed that an animal was either the ancestor of a human group, married an ancestor, or magically assisted him. Such totemism might result in clan names, clan functions, sometimes a pro- hibition against eating the animal as with the Yuchi of South Carolina, or a ceremony involving it as with the Hopi Snake clan. However, there were also kin groups without totemic connections. Nor was it always true that a group with one animal patron must not inter- marry. An animal might be the cre- ator of a whole tribe, as the coyote was with the Miwok of California. It might be a culture hero or a trickster-transfor- mer, like the hare with the Winnebago or the raven with the Tlingit. In fact, the word "totem" cannot be used in America without a careful definition of the concept as used in the group con- cerned. Animal spirits appeared in some form in almost every Indian group. In ad- dition, the more organized peoples im- ported or devised anthropomorphic con- cepts like the War Gods and Kachinas of the Southwest or the False Faces of the Iroquois. A few horrifying beings appeared like the Cannibal Spirit or the Windigo of the North Woods. (Has the gloom of the forest anything to do with this sort of imagination?) As a rule, there was no sharp division be- tween good and bad forces as is found in monotheistic religions. To use the well-known simile of the electric cur- rent, power was thought to harm or benefit according to the channel through which it passed. Thus, the same sha- man, according to his attitude, could dispel a disease or use it to kill. A Guardian Spirit helped as long as proper behavior was observed toward it. If not, it might injure or kill its protege. Occasionally, there is mention of a bad or deceptive spirit, but this concept was a vague one. Nor is there any proof of a High God, keeping the spirit world in order. Certain beautiful expressions occur, such as the Algonquian Great Spirit and the Creek Master of Breath. These generally turn out to have been very limited concepts, either of a dis- tant creator who later ceased to func- tion or merely of a spirit higher than the others. The spirits were approached in two 130</page><page sequence="5">RELIGION AMONG AMERICAN INDIANS very different ways and were closely connected with the economics of a tribe and its degree of organization. The two ways are vision and ceremony. The vision Across the northern part of North America stretched an area of hunting peoples. They lived for most of the year in seminomadic small bands with little organization and little chance for large assemblies. Much of the time, the hunter faced his dangerous task alone. His need was for health, cour- age, and luck for himself, but the fate of others hardly concerned him. In this area the individual male sought a vision which would assure him of the luck phrased as spirit power. The vision took numberless forms among the different tribes and was sought under varying circumstances. With the Woodland Algonquians of the East, the Salish of the Northwest and some Plains tribes, it was sought at pu- berty. Here, every boy (and a few girls) hoped for supernatural help to guide his career and ensure success. To that end he practised seclusion and fast- ing, sometimes repeatedly, but before the supernatural experience, not after as with women. Sometimes he added or- deals to gain the spirits' pity and show his courage. In fact, this was a re- ligious ritual based on a definite the- ology, not a blind observance of taboo. It served as a substitute for boys' initia- tion ceremonies, rare in North America. The puberty vision followed a stand- ard form for which the boy was well prepared. An animal appeared in its human guise and took him to its vil- lage in the forest or under the sea or perhaps delivered instruction on the spot. This consisted of a song to be used when power was needed and usu- ally a fetish which was given or which he must find or make. With the fetish went a rudimentary ritual which must be followed on pain of losing power or being injured by it. Even an unimagi- native youth was likely to achieve such a vision after repeated trials. Often he had some supervision from an older man or a whole group of them. If his hal- lucination was not of acceptable form he was likely to be told: "That was a false spirit. Try again." After the puberty vision, the boy went into an apprenticeship to realize the promised power. He did this with an absolute conviction of success and an image of himself as one favored by the spirits. This was a potent incentive to success. It was just possible that in such an arduous occupation as whaling, he might fail in spite of this psychologi- cal help. In that case, there was no distrust of the spirits. He decided or was told that the vision coming to him had been an evil spirit in disguise. We can hardly overestimate the value of this vision experience at a time when a boy's character was being formed. The lack of it in boarding schools seems to me to have been one cause of Indian demoralization. To an Indian with cul- ture history so different from the white culture, the Hebrew-Christian teaching rarely provided a substitute. With the Woodland Algonquian the voluntary, strenuous vision quest ceased after puberty, but on the Plains it was carried on much later. In the Sun Dance of the Dakota and Mandan, ma- ture men were tortured in a group in expectation of a vision to come. Indi- viduals, at other times, practised seclu- sion and torture for added power. In other Plains tribes, men, at least, prayed and fasted when special help was needed. This idea of supernatural help through revelation has much in common with Christian concepts. Some Christian teachers have, indeed, built on it, only suggesting that the direction of power be changed from success in war or hunting, now inessential, to success in 131</page><page sequence="6">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY righteous living. Most have insisted, however, often without much study, that all the old practices be swept away. As a response the Indians, particularly in the Plains area where the vision was prominent, have worked out their own combination of vision and ethics. The resulting Peyote religion will be dis- cussed below. Going west and south from the Plains and the Plateau Salish, the vision ex- perience becomes less strenuous. It might even arrive unsought. In a large area including the Great Basin and much of California, even some of the Southwest, it came as a dream in sleep. A Mohave of southern California found himself on the sacred mountain at the beginning of the world and learned a power like scalping or the right to sing a clan song from the lips of the creator, himself. Luisefo boys in California had visions in a group, under the influence of a drug, datura. Along the Pacific coast, beginning in northern California, spirit power may come unsought (al- though not always) and even unwanted. One is reminded of mediums of eastern Asia and the Pacific by the way in which the recipient of power is tempo- rarily affected with either illness or mad- ness. Here the power is less often an animal than the wealth spirit, or the war spirit. With the Kwakiutl of Van- couver Island, the whole power concept is reduced to a dramatic show and a means to prestige. A highborn boy pre- tends to be kidnapped by the Cannibal Spirit and returns, pretending madness. Lowborn people were not expected to have visions. The shaman The medicine man, or shaman, was the arch visionary. I define such a person as one whose powers came from direct contact with the supernatural, rather than from inheritance or memo- rized ritual. True, it is impossible to make a clearcut distinction for often the son or relative of a shaman was thought to have a better chance of in- spiration than others. Also, his prede- cessor might teach him some of the sleight of hand which sometimes accom- panied exhibitions of spirit power. Ac- cording to the area, power was obtained, just as it was for the average man. either through quest and ordeal, or often unsought through dreams in sleep. The difference was that the shaman's experi- ence was more prolonged and often more strenuous. Sometimes he had several spirits, providing different powers. The chief function of the shaman was curing. Here he used a method so an- cient and widespread that it may well have been brought over by some of the earliest immigrants.3 This method rests on the belief that illness is caused by an intrusive object, such as a worm or a stick, shot into the body by some malign influence. The shaman sucked out the object, sometimes varying his process by rubbing, smoking, and blowing. Then he exhibited the object to spectators. Shamans were frequently accused of sleight of hand in this process. Still, I can testify that many actually believed in their power and felt that a few tricks were necessary drama for the ignorant. Granted what we now know of psycho- somatic medicine, the faith generated in the patient by the shaman's procedure may have had real therapeutic value. A less widespread belief about dis- ease and its removal was that of spirit possession. Here the shaman actually exorcised an evil spirit and sent it away. Another belief, found chiefly around the Pacific coast, was that illness was caused by the loss of the patient's soul which had strayed or had been spirited away 3 Forrest E. Clements, Primitive Concepts of Disease, "University of California Publica- tions in American Archaeology and Ethnol- ogy," Vol. 32, No. 2 (Berkeley: University of California, 1932), pp. 209-16, 213-19. 132</page><page sequence="7">RELIGION AMONG AMERICAN INDIANS to the land of the dead. Special prac- titioners, sometimes in a public cere- mony, made a trip to the other world to retrieve the soul. Among the Eskimo, as on the east coast of Asia, shamans dramatized a flight to the moon or to another spirit world. The shaman's function proliferated, especially in the West, where there were war shamans, weather shamans, bear shamans, and snake shamans. Some were merely diviners, foretelling the fu- ture or selecting curing practitioners. This last function was necessary where a number of different curing methods had accumulated in one area. In some form or other, the shaman existed in al- most every North American tribe. With the agricultural Hopi, who had cere- monial means of curing, he was reduced almost to disgrace. With the Zuni, he was given the aegis of a society. His curing function had such appeal for the average man that the shaman may often be found in a tribe which has given up most other native practices. The communal ceremony Standardized ceremonies, at regular dates, required certain conditions. The simplest was that it must be possible for a large group of people to gather and be fed. This was impossible for hunters and food gatherers at most times of the year, since such a gather- ing would frighten the game animals and use up the wild plants. Second, the people must all have a common in- terest, so that they all sought from the supernaturals one and the same boon. This, too, did not apply to hunters, ex- cept when there was a herd of animals to be surrounded. That was the case when the Southern Paiute held their yearly antelope drive or a Plains group its great buffalo hunt. On each of these occasions, there was a standardized cere- mony, although much of the Sioux Sun Dance, it is interesting to see, consisted of a vision quest pursued by several men in company. The groups whose chief contact with the supernaturals was through standard- ized ceremony were the agriculturists. True, they retained many elements of the visionary and shamanistic belief, since they had, at some time, lived the hunting life. However, their needs were now different. Much of their work in the fields was co-operative, and the in- dividualistic attitude was not useful. Moreover, the rain or sunshine which they needed must come to all alike. For them, a communal appeal to the spirits was the natural thing. The spirits, too, were new ones, having to do with weather and agriculture. It seems possible that they and their ac- companying ceremonies were imported along with the magic-working plants they fostered. Wherever the ceremonies were worked out, they had a good deal of resemblance to the ritual imposed by a spirit on its individual protege. In its simplest form, this meant a song and the honoring of a sacred object. However, as the place of ceremony remained the same, sacred objects could be elaborated into masks. costumes, images, and even theatrical properties like the Hopi snake at Palii- liikonti. The song could be expanded into a whole suite of songs and dances. The same officiants could be used from year to year. These tended to stand- ardize the ceremony, learn it by heart, and transmit it to successors. THE PRIEST Such a ceremonial officiant I shall call a priest. True, his ritual had a supernatural source, but often it was thought to have been dictated by the spirits long ago, and his present duty was merely to follow it without error. However, he handled sacred parapher- nalia and therefore must practice some 133</page><page sequence="8">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY form of withdrawal, at least seclusion and fasting. The Pueblos, at least, brought in ethical considerations by de- manding that he should have only peace- ful thoughts. The priest and the sha- man were two separate functionaries, often practicing in the same society. However, the line between them might be blurred, the shaman developing a little ritual, the priest supplementing his ritual by vision. The ritual form The most usual rituals were often for the sake of weather and crop growth. For the latter, there might be two or three rituals, corresponding to the life crises of birth (planting); maturity (green corn) and death (harvest). Others were special pleas for rain, rituals to help or to celebrate war raids, and pil- grimages to obtain blessing-the Papago salt journey or the Pawnee Hako and great ceremonies "to keep the world in order." Ceremonial officiants can also cure, but in quite other circumstances than those that call for the shaman. They treat afflictions arising supernatu- rally from breach of taboo generally connected with a ceremony. The cure consists in performing the ceremony, or the injured part of it, correctly; thus erasing the error. The famous Navaho chant, which is a curing ceremony for an individual, comes partly under this head. It is performed with memorized ritual, on a Pueblo pattern, by a priest for a patient who is thought to be "out of harmony" with the world. However, the myth behind it involves visits to su- pernatural animals in their villages, in the northern hunter's style. Each tribe had its own series of cere- monies and its own fostering spirits, often those of the plants themselves. There is not enough space here to name all the ritual acts worked out, but they fall within a large common framework. This included purification of the par- ticipants, which might mean all those present or only officiants. It might be by a sweatbath, as with the Sioux; vom- iting, as with the Navaho and Creek; or confession, as with the Iroquois. There were offerings to the spirits: tobacco, food or, in the Southwest, the feathered wands called prayersticks. There was little blood sacrifice. Individual Plains Indians sometimes cut off a finger to gain the spirits' pity. A dog was ritu- ally killed and eaten by some tribes, and the Pawnee killed a human captive to help the crops. The concept of vicari- ous sacrifice in Christian belief seems, therefore, strange to many Indians. Other concepts not usual in the com- munal ceremonies are those of humility and worship. The ordeals of the indi- vidual vision seeker, as I mentioned, are sometimes phrased as appeals for pity. In the communal ceremonies, the atmos- phere is more often that of a bargain between respected allies. The priest, having performed his ceremony and made his offerings without error, ex- presses his confidence that the spirits will give man the rain and crops he needs.4 In spite of these differences, thousands of Indians are now members of Christian churches. It is interesting to see which sects have proved con- genial to the different tribes-Catholics to the Pueblos, Presbyterians to the Pimas, and Quakers to the Iroquois. Granted that historic opportunity had a good deal to do with the case, still, the Pueblos were already given to page- antry, the Pimas to a town-meeting style of discussion, and the Iroquois to a dream dictation very much like that of the "inner light." 4For details see Ruth M. Underhill, Cere- monial Patterns in the Greater Southwest, "Monograph of the American Ethnological So- ciety," Vol. 13 (New York: J. J. Augustin, 1948). 134</page><page sequence="9">RELIGION AMONG AMERICAN INDIANS POST-COLUMBIAN RELIGIONS The coming of the whites brought successively a period of frustration and insecurity to various Indian groups. As has happened all over the world, this usually meant a religious revival and the leadership of some seer or prophet who preached a solution to their prob- lems. In the early days, this solution was simply a return to the old ways with abstinence from all food and equip- ment which came from the white man. Special ceremonies on an Indian plan might be added. The promised result was the disap- pearance of the white man and the re- turn of the old life, either through magic or through successful war. Such move- ments I may call reversion religions. Reversion religions Some of the most important of these looked forward to successful war. Among them can be named that of Pope, lead- ing to the Pueblo revolt of 1680; that of the Delaware prophet and Pontiac's conspiracy, 1672; that of the Shawnee prophet, brother of Tecumseh, and the Ohio revolt, 1805. All of these wars came to grief. As time showed the hopelessness of war, the visionaries began to promise a magical solution involving the disap- pearance of the whites or the finding by the Indians of some new and peaceful land. Such leaders were Kanakuk of the Kickapoo, 1827; Tavibo of the Paiute, 1870; Smohalla of the Sokulk, on the Columbia River, 1889-90. In re- sponse to a vision claimed by Wowoka, a Paiute, many tribes, especially from the Plains where disruption was ex- treme, accepted Wowoka's gospel. This meant the Ghost Dance, with special costume, songs, and dances dictated by the prophet on a Paiute pattern. The contention of the devotees was that they intended no attack on the whites, but expected their magical disappearance. These gatherings among the Sioux were misunderstood by the whites and re- sulted in the massacre of Wounded Knee. Since its prophecies were not fulfilled, this type of reversion religion died out like the other. Amalgamation religions After Christian teachings had become somewhat familiar, there was a series of what I may call amalgamation religions. These did not contemplate the conquest or disappearance of the whites. In- stead, they aimed at peaceful living for the Indians under the new conditions. Though they often kept old Indian cus- toms and eschewed Christian theology, they included definite ethical teachings. The need for such teaching was obvious since Indian groups were breaking up, and the old clan and family influence was not sufficient to control behavior. Above all, liquor was making its in- roads, and the new preachers demanded total abstinence as well as peaceful and upright living. Among such preachers was Handsome Lake of the Iroquois, 1799-1815, who was profoundly influenced by Quaker missionaries. In the Southern Puget Sound country, in 1881, John Slocum founded the Shaker religion, a com- pound of Christian elements and Indian style vision. Both of these cults are still functioning. The most widespread of all was the Peyote religion, many of whose adherents were brought together in 1918 as the Native American Church. Like other cults, Peyotism involved a combination of old Indian practices with social ethics. It had no one prophet, although several Southwestern tribes tell of a suffering individual who had a vi- sion after the old pattern. He saw the peyote plant in human form, was given the directions for a ceremony and ethi- cal maxims, and was bidden to teach these to his people for their salvation. 135</page><page sequence="10">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Peyote (Mexican peyotl) is a small globular cactus with a root like a carrot found growing on both sides of the Rio Grande. It contains a number of alka- loids, the chief being mescaline, and has the power of producing hallucinations with intense and varied colors. It was used by Mexican Indians, notably the Huichol in elaborate ceremonies. Late in the nineteenth century one of the Plains tribes, perhaps Kiowa or Co- manche, roved into \Iexico, brought back the cactus, and evolved a Plains- type ceremony centered around its use. Peyotists in Oklahoma were organized in 1918 as the Native American Church and since then eleven other states have issued charters to several denominations of Peyotists. Nearly all groups are affili- ated with the Native American Church, which has national officers and the larg- est membership of any Indian group in the United States.5 The Peyote religion teaches an ethical doctrine much like those of the mono- theistic religions. However, it eschews specific Christian theology, its expo- nents often stating that while Christ came to the whites, peyote came to the Indians. This is an obvious reaction to the subordinate place so often given to the Indian converts in a church organi- zation. Indians resent being treated as inferiors in religion as elsewhere. Their meetings, which have been at- tended by a number of anthropologists including myself, are like some Prot- estant prayer meetings, where the pro- gram includes singing, prayer, and testi- monials. They are held in a tepee strewn with white sage in the Plains manner and with a half-moon shaped earthen altar as in some Kiowa cere- monies. During the evening, a drum and rattle are passed around clockwise, one man singing a song. supposedly of his own composition, while a man on 5 J. S. Slotkin, The Peyote Religion (Glen- coe: Free Press, 1956). one side of him drums and on the other rattles. Meanwhile heads of the cactus, usually dried, are passed around, each person expecting to eat eight during the evening. After midnight, when the round has been made once, there are testimonials from individuals who have been helped to follow "the straight road," giving up liquor and other faults. At dawn comes a token meal of old In- dian foods, then prayers asking God's help for Indians, whites, and all the world. Statements have been made that Peyote meetings are wild orgies like those due to marijuana. Obviously, these opinions are expressed by persons who have never attended a meeting. The effect of peyote is color visions ac- companied by extreme lassitude and un- willingness to move at all. Its prin- cipal ingredient, mescaline, is now be- ing investigated by several scientific groups; the conclusion so far is that it is not habit forming. To produce any bad effects such as shortened respira- tion, at least 350 mgs. of mescaline are needed; white experimenters have taken as many as 700 without harm. The standard buttons (eight) taken at meet- ings contain only some 107 mgs. Membership in the Native American Church is growing and for obvious rea- sons. The Indian is at a point where he really desires to share the advan- tages of the white man, yet he still feels something of a maladjusted outsider. A religion which provides him with pur- pose and with self-esteem would seem desirable help, unless we get scientific proof that it is injurious. The areas where it is spreading most are those un- der present stress, like the Navaho res- ervation. On the contrary in Oklahoma, the place of its origin, I was told that some of the younger, more fully accul- turated men object to the Indian ele- ments in the religion and are joining the white man's church. 136</page></plain_text>
