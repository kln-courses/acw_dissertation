Schubert Division of Social Sciences Alfred University Alfred, New York 14802 This book offers a number of potential benefits to political scientists, any one of which might justify the investment of reading time. Most importantly, it provides a useful empirical basis for beginning intelligent discussion, perhaps in a seminar, of the biosocial roots of one fundamental property of hu- man politics, although there is no chapter included on political deception. The editors' intentions in this book are summarized in the concluding sentences of its Epilogue, "We think the time may have come to put away our quotation marks and our disclaimers (about nonhuman cognition) and to face up to the implications of the fact that some cognitive terms do provide a convenient language for describing com- plex organization in nature" (p. 361). However, just as the editors use the term "convenient" instead of "common" or "general," they also fail to provide the integrating discussion necessary to organize the various data presented in the book into a coherent theoretical treatment of deception across species. Readers are left at the end of the book with a brief set of general summary principles accompanied by references to some human and nonhuman anecdotal examples. Overall, the title of the book is somewhat mislead- ing in that, while there is some treatment of decep- tion in humans, the emphasis is on nonhumans. One positive result, however, is that a number of fascinat- ing studies of deception in nonhumans are included, many of which are based on systematic data collec- tion and analysis. These papers report on deception in stilts (birds), mixed species bird flocks, fireflies, stomatopods (shrimp), macaques (monkeys), ele- phants, and chimpanzees. In most of these studies, concepts are defined and operationalized, data are collected through direct observation, and hypothe- ses are tested. As a set, the papers do a nice job of illustrating the various methods and problems of animal behavior research. Most of the studies collect data through field observation, although one uses experimental design. The field studies include both fully naturalistic as well as zoo-based observations. Methodological issues in ethological research are interestingly revealed in the positions adopted on the logically central problem of intuitive judgments by observers and anthropomorphic interpretations of intentionality in animal behavior (e.g., de Waal).</page><page sequence="2">112 Miles' chapter, "How Can I Tell a Lie? Apes, Language and the Problem of Deception," ad- dresses the problem of discriminating instances of intentional deception from cases where the human observer perceives deceit associated with simple communication errors on the part of the animal; error by the observer in understanding the meaning at- tached by the animal to a sign; and learning by the animal that the innovative use of a sign in a particu- lar context produces a desired outcome, but without any manifest intention to deceive. Miles applies the principle of parsimonious interpretation to explain events in terms of these categories of unintentional deception, before accepting interpretations of "in- tentional deception" or "deception with false cues." Applying a fairly rigorous approach to inference, Miles presents a very interesting and convincing report on deceptive behavior by Chantek, an orang- utan at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga that had been taught a version of Pidgin Sign English, with data based on event frequencies and not isolated, anecdotal incidents. Vasek's, "Lying as a Skill: The Development of Deception in Children," is an especially appropriate piece for this book because it provides those read- ers unfamiliar with current literature in developmen- tal and cognitive psychology with a point of compari- son for interpreting the proximity of deceptive behavior in chimpanzees and apes to deceptive behavior in humans. In terms of cognitive develop- ment, humans have the capacity for fully intentional deception by approximately age 5 and, through game and nongame applications, quickly begin to hone their skills. There is no suggestion in other papers that birds or fireflies engage in intentional deception, although their behavior functions to de- ceive (especially predators). Intentionality is claimed, however, with respect to arctic fox, ele- phants, and chimpanzees, as well as with Chantek. It appeared to this reader that more widespread application of Miles' principle of parsimonious inter- pretation could have led to more cautious inferences in some studies, but overall, an interesting and plausible case is made for intentional deception across select species. In Chevalier-Skolnikoff's "An Exploration of the Ontogeny of Deception in Human Beings and Non- human Primates," she finds evidence of intentional- ity in deception for apes and humans, but not monkeys. Applying Piaget's Sensorimotor Series, she concludes: ... deception develops gradually in a stage-by- stage sequence concomitant with sensorimotor intelligence and is inextricably related to intelli- gence. While studies on deception in young human children and apes are few, these data suggest that children and apes both become capable of deceiving at the early age of around 18 months to two years, (p. 217) With respect to similarities in human and nonhu- man (those without human language training) de- ception, the clearest analogy to emerge in the readings involves physical feints. De Waal describes an incident involving chimpanzees at the Arnhem Zoo (a group featured in his book on Chimpanzee Politics, 1982) in which a male captured a female: Nikkie aggressively pursued a female, Spin, who sought cover behind a tree trunk. Nikkie started to turn to the left, and Spin responded by moving to the right. At the moment Spin appeared around the corner, Nikkie threw a brick, but almost without losing speed, so that he was able to catch his victim when she jumped back to the left in order to avoid the projectile, (p. 235) In Mawby and Mitchell's, "Feints and Ruses: An Analysis of Deception in Sports," Jose Torres is paraphrased by Floyd Patterson, "A feint is an outright lie. You make believe you're going to hit your opponent in one place, he covers the spot and your punch lands on the other side. A left hook off the jab is a classy lie" (p. 317). Clearly, a proposition of similarity in the nature of physical deception across species enjoys a measure of face validity. It would have been intriguing had the editors included a systematic cross-species comparative treatment of the ontogeny of such specific intentional acts of physical deception as feints (perhaps in play group situations). They do include a paper on human military deception that translates physical feints and ruses from the individual to the group level of analysis and that integrates physical and linguistic communications. One of the explicit benefits that political scientists might gain from this book involves methodological stimulation. Ethologists do direct observational stud- ies, using both field and experimental research designs. With the exception of a virtual handful, political scientists do not do direct observational research, behavioral or otherwise. While geologists, astronomers, biologists, chemists, most physicists, even anthropologists spend time, often a good deal of time, directly observing their subject matter, few political scientists actually watch their subject mat- ter, let alone actually produce published research based on systematic direct observation and mea- surement. Fenno (1986) began his presidential ad- dress to the American Political Science Association, "Observation is at the heart of political analysis. Observing the behavior of U. S. senators involves watching them.. . (3)." One way to begin consider- ing the uses of observational research in political science is to learn how other disciplines do it and what methodological problems they confront.</page><page sequence="3">113 A second possible benefit for political scientists involves theoretical stimulation. We hardly need reference to the recent flap in the U. S. over "disinformation" to note that deception is among the means by which "A gets ? to do something that ? would not otherwise do" and, thus, provides one means for the exercise of political influence. Of course, intriguing theoretical questions arise from the controversy that sometimes surrounds the dis- covery of deception by political leaders. If deception is an accepted medium of Realpolitik in foreign policy, its use is subject to a variety of structural and normative constraints in domestic politics. Given analogous evolution of the capacity for deception, albeit at different levels of complexity, across spe- cies, we may wonder whether common principles characterize the use of different forms of deception, for instance, in intragroup versus intergroup rela- tions. I am proposing that we might gain theoretical insights into human political deception, its ontogeny and phylogeny, and the nature of political power by attention to nonhuman deception. Certainly all politi- cal scientists recognize the "logic" of comparative analysis. However, with extremely few exceptions, we tend to regard human political behavior as so contextually unique as to exclude valid and useful cross-species comparative analyses?even with chimpanzees and apes. Of course, deception is only one of several areas of relevant research in ethology. Other political concepts of concern in animal behav- ior research include leadership and leadership change, coalition formation and competition within groups, conflict and conflict resolution processes and post-conflict reconciliation, to name a few. In short, I find both methodological and theoretical grounds upon which to recommend this book. Cer- tainly, it does not provide the final word on the problems addressed, nor does it pretend to. Hope- fully, it will help stimulate growing attention to the fully comparative analysis of the bases of social and political animal behavior, broadly conceived.</page></plain_text>
