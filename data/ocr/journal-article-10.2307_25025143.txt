<plain_text><page sequence="1">Medieval Death: Ritual and Representation. By Paul Binski. (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. 1996. Pp. 224. $3995.) This "essay" on "art, religion, society, the body, and ritual" resembles, in many ways,T S. R. Boase's Death in the Middle Ages (New York, 1972). Both address general readers and students; the quality and diversity of their illustrations is comparable; and each has eleven fine color plates. What differentiates them is textual. For the most part, Boase let his photographs of memorials to the dead and depictions of the afterlife, funerals, the dance of death, and the ars moriendi, speak for themselves. He confined his analysis to an occasional indi cation of historical trends, and ended with a dismissive remark about the me dieval "debasement of things spiritual to anthropomorphic crudities." Paul Binski has more to say, and his remarks are a good measure of the change in ap proach and tone that recent scholarship has brought to the interpretation of this fascinating material. Binski presents the Christian belief in the salvific power of Christ's death as the foundation of a Western European "medieval death culture" whose central feature was the doctrine of resurrection, and many of whose peculiarities, from the cult of relics to the doctrine of purgatory and the art of the macabre, had to</page><page sequence="2">76 BOOK REVIEWS do "with the spiritual significance and representation of the body." He does not elucidate how this came to be, but he explores it in rich detail, at least for the later Middle Ages. For example, Binski explains the history of late medieval memorials in terms of a "politics of space [and] the body" that led the wealthy and powerful to compete for recognition after death in increasingly crowded churches through ever more elaborate tombs and commemorative structures. The tension between such behavior and Christian ideals of penitence and hu mility led to the re-emergence of flat tomb slabs for floor burials?humble but unforgettable?as well as the radical iconography of the transi tomb, which was not a response to the anxieties of life in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but "an internal development of medieval visual culture itself," its macabre rep resentation of the cadaver a reaction against the false decorum of gothic effigies and renaissance idealizations of the human form. The treatment of dead bodies, in this world and the next, and their represen tations in art, meant much to medieval Europeans, as they do to us. By focusing on the body as "an ambivalent sign" of the state of the soul?and the social standing of the deceased?and on the "transactional" nature of medieval fune real art, which engaged its viewers in a dialogue about suffrages and selfhood, Binski situates the artistic products of "medieval death culture" within the com plexities of late medieval culture as a whole. Unfortunately, he has less to say about the period before 1200. His text is also occasionally marred by lecture hall witticisms ("the culture of the video nasty," the "sorry sadism" of a saint's life) and often strained evocations of Foucault, Freud, and Lacan. Still, this lively and informative account marks a significant advance over previous treatments and should be a welcome addition to any course of readings on medieval cul ture or the history of death.
