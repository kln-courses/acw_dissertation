In the past, exhibitions and catalogues fre- quently pretended to be devoted to a substan- tive topic and to present new understandings of African art, yet simply displayed selections of beautiful objects while providing little or no conceptual framework. Such catalogues add little to our knowledge about African art and its makers, although we may enjoy the objects pictured in them. Lately, however, a new genre of exhibition and catalogue has emerged that contributes to current discus- sions in African art history, history, and anthropology. Incorporating the theoretical and methodological insights of these fields, these exhibitions and catalogues translate aca- demic debates into a different format of repre- sentation and make them accessible to a wider audience. At the same time, they do away with many of the stereotypes obscuring the understanding of African art. "African Reflections: Art from North- eastern Zaire," an exhibition organized by the American Museum of Natural History in New York (see review, p. 76), is a perfect ex- ample of such an undertaking. It focused on the art of the Mangbetu and their neighbors that was collected by members of the American Museum of Natural History's Congo Expedition. In 1908, German-born Herbert Lang, a twenty-eight-year-old mam- mologist for the museum, and James P. Chapin, an eighteen-year-old student at Columbia University and later a well-known ornithologist, were chosen by the museum to conduct scientific research in the Congo. They left in 1909 and did not return until 1915, spending six years in what is now northeast- ern Zaire. In pursuit of the elusive okapi, a rare animal that had captured the Western imagination, they studied the fauna and flora of the region. In addition, Lang devoted him- self to anthropological research. His extensive fieldnotes, over 10,000 photographs, and 4,000 objects constitute the material basis for the exhibition and accompanying catalogue. Co-curators Enid Schildkrout, an anthro- pologist, and Curtis A. Keim, a historian who has carried out fieldwork among the Mang- betu, combined their considerable talents for this project. They also drew on the expertise of other colleagues in the field. Four of the .(0 CL m (l .. 6 a. 14 j</page><page sequence="2">DAN, Height 123/4" Ex collection: DE HAVENON twelve chapters in their catalogue were con- tributed by other specialists: the ethnomusi- cologist Didier Demolin, the anthropologists John Mack and Thomas Ross Miller, and the historian Jan Vansina. The result is convincing and quite extraordinary, for the catalogue is not only au courant with recent scholarly debates, but also opens up a few new ones. Several theoretical and methodological insights form the core of the book. Although Schildkrout and Keim focus mainly on the Mangbetu, because there are by far the richest data available on them, they advocate a regional approach to the study of "Mangbetu art." That label has been used erroneously by Western connoisseurs and scholars to refer to what they saw as the art of one ethnic group cum kingdom. Rather, as Schildkrout and Keim reveal, the Mangbetu were a multieth- nic composite and had formed numerous polities. "Mangbetu art" really referred to par- ticular styles in carving and pottery that were produced by artists of diverse ethnic back- grounds in northeastern Zaire. Clarifying their conceptual framework, Schildkrout and Keim write: "Our central premise...is that in order to understand Mangbetu-style art and culture-or those of any people in this re- gion-we must view the art producers in a regional context, in dynamic interaction with their neighbors, both allies and enemies" (p. 25). Certainly, previous publications and exhibits have focused on art regions, but they often saw them as static and treated the ethnic groups within them as discrete art-producing units, thus ultimately reverting back to the "one tribe, one style" paradigm. By contrast, the emphasis here is on relationships and interaction between peoples, on regional pro- cesses rather than on stasis. In order to untangle the dynamics of this region, Schildkrout and Keim interpret the arts in their historical and ethnographic contexts, thus realizing the demand of many scholars that history be more fully integrated into the study of African art. They suggest that the arts were continually redefined throughout history as people migrated, extended trading net- works, entered into marital alliances, con- quered each other, and resisted conquest (p. 27). The ever-changing nature of the arts, then, complements and reflects the shifting nature of this multiethnic and politically complex set- ting. The impact of colonialism on material production, another fascinating theme taken up in the catalogue, is understood as just one phase in the constant redefinition and trans- formation of art traditions. The book contributes to other debates as well. A recurring theme is the representation of the Other: the exploration of the views of Europeans and how these shaped their obser- vations of and writings about the peoples of northeastern Zaire. Modes of representing the Other in word and image have become a major concern of many scholars exploring the cultural, institutional, and political discourse about Africa conducted by the West, which implies an unequal relationship between the powerful and those ruled. (The term "Africanist" is used here as the equivalent of the term "Orientalist.") Yet rarely has writing about art taken such serious account of the impact of Western representation on a body of ethnographic data as has this book. The sec- ond chapter, titled "Through Western Eyes: The Making of the Mangbetu Myth," is devot- ed entirely to recounting Western (mis)con- ceptions of the Mangbetu. Throughout the catalogue, however, we are also confronted with evidence of Africans' views of the Western Other, most poignantly expressed in portraits and depictions of Westerners. For example, two pipe bowls in the likeness of Chapin and Lang convey an element of keen observation that is present in other renderings of Europeans as well. The authors' examination of the rise and decline of anthropomorphic art, such as the well-known harps and figurative clay pots, becomes the testing ground for many of their theses. According to received wisdom, these objects constitute classic "Mangbetu art," produced by anonymous artists of the cen- tralized Mangbetu kingdom in the "darkest heart of Africa." In revealing the colonial ori- gins of this particular genre of "Mangbetu art" and the true identity of its makers, Schildkrout and Keim present rich ethno- graphic and historical contextualization, with data mostly. derived from Lang's fieldnotes and writings by early explorers. A careful 16 I is</page><page sequence="3">analysis of these sources demonstrates that anthropomorphic art was neither exclusively Mangbetu-the harps, for instance, were mostly produced by artists of the neighbor- ing Azande-nor a dominant form in any of the earlier artistic traditions of the region (p. 256). The genre flourished in response to European demand. Considering this variety of themes, the question arises: How well do the authors deal with them, and do they successfully inter- weave these topics to create a coherent cata- logue? The following overview will allow readers to fathom the scope of this work. The first chapter, titled "Art, Ethnography, and History in Northeastern Zaire," briefly outlines the authors' objectives and theoretical concerns. I was particularly intrigued by the second chapter, "Through Western Eyes: The Making of the Mangbetu Myth," which pre- sents an excellent analysis of stereotypical views surrounding the Mangbetu to this day and stands as a fine contribution to the grow- ing body of literature examining the represen- tation of the Other. In this chapter, Schildkrout and Keim note that the first European ever to visit the Mangbetu kingdom was the German explorer Georg Schweinfurth in 1870. His ele- gant and gripping prose about his fabulous experiences at the court of King Mbunza had such an influence on later visitors to Mangbetu country that they expected to encounter the same impressive sights-and the Mangbetu kings obliged. In an interesting turn of events, the Mangbetu began to represent themselves so that they would live up to the Western myth, and thus became more "Mangbetu-ized" as time went on. The myth ultimately affected and created reality. The third chapter, "Collecting in the Congo: The American Museum of Natural History Congo Expedition, 1909-1915," unravels the background of the expedition. Chapters four and five provide detailed insights into the history of northeastern Zaire and the social organization of the Mangbetu and their neighbors at the turn of this centu- ry. "Reconstructing the Past" is a painstaking exercise by Jan Vansina to untangle the his- torical shaping of the landscape of northeast- ern Zaire, the continuous cultural changes affecting the peoples in the region, and, final- ly, the genesis of the polities visited by Europeans in the second half of the nine- teenth century. Schildkrout and Keim's clear discussion of Mangbetu social organization in chapter five sets the stage for the following three chapters on the arts. Arguing that "the basic esthetic princi- ples of the people of northeastern Zaire are expressed in a wide variety of useful objects they make that embody a vibrant sense of design," the authors carefully link art with aspects of aesthetics and thought in the chapters that follow (p. 233). Chapter six deals with "The Art and Technology of Daily Life," including architecture and house design, production and the division of labor, ceramics, fiber and gourd objects, bark boxes, woodcarving, and metalwork.

"The Art of Adornment," which describes the repertoire of practices and objects used to shape and adorn the head and body to indi- cate age, gender, and class, is one of the most intriguing chapters. The description of body adornments includes body painting, jewelry, knives (which were worn as adornments), barkcloth, and the famous women's back aprons, the negbe. Chapter eight, "The Craft of Power and the Art of Kings," begins with an account of Schweinfurth's visit to the court of the famous Mangbetu king Mbunza in 1870, using it as a backdrop to a discussion of the Mangbetu style of leadership and how partic- ular types of performances and objects relate to kingship. Rulers of not only the.several kingdoms that had sprung up among the Mangbetu, but also other kingdoms modeled on the Mangbetu style of leadership had to possess two essential qualities: nataate (the quality to be someone) and nakira (skill and intelligence) (p. 147). Both qualities were enacted in the kings' public dancing, which figures prominently in Westerners' accounts. After briefly discussing the kings' wives and courtiers, the authors then focus on symbols of power. In its examination of the objects surrounding Mangbetu kings, this part of the chapter resembles similar discussions of other royal arts, be they Asante, Benin, Bamum, or Kuba. Keim provides historical insights in an examination of economic administration, the early colonial changes in kingdom organization, the Belgian Congo (1908-1960), and independence. "Dealing with Destiny: Aspects of Mang- betu Thought" (chapter nine) presents a well- crafted and complex analysis of Mangbetu beliefs and actions dealing with the supernat- ural and natural worlds. The authors investi- gate some of the "conceptual underpinnings of Mangbetu ideas about social order, in par- ticular how the individual is thought to fit into the grander scheme of nature and the forces that control it" (p. 169).

Chapter ten, co-authored by Didier De- molin and Thomas Ross Miller, provides use- ful information about the social organization of Mangbetu music, covering such themes as the origin of the Mangbetu harps, court music, dance costumes, ritual music, and music for entertainment. Although this is an interesting chapter, it is slightly repetitive: some of the issues it presents were previously discussed in other contexts. In fact, the cata- logue as a whole could have been a little bit tighter in this respect, for replication also occurs in the analysis of the region's history. In some instances different authors, particu- larly Vansina and Keim, suggest different models. This divergence is actually beneficial, for it lessens the authoritative voice and leaves room for speculation. The next chapter contains John Mack's excellent analysis of "Art, Culture, and Tribute among the Azande." As neighbors and com- petitors of the Mangbetu, the Azande are deeply interwoven with them. This chapter is a welcome and necessary addition to the text, for some of the most outstanding sculp- tures in the exhibition were produced by Azande carvers. One example is the wonder- ful mother-and-child figure that graced one of the posters publicizing the exhibition at the National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C. In the final chapter, Schildkrout and Keim summarize the aims they pursued in this book, at which they have succeeded ad- mirably. They reiterate and expand upon their findings on the origins of Mangbetu anthropomorphic art and set that art fully into the colonial context. We are introduced to artists such as Songo, a Zande chief who carved in wood and ivory. One particularly fascinating discussion focuses on the oeuvre of artists who engraved gourds and ivory. They clearly enjoyed working for the foreign patrons, and they were bursting with creativ- ity. Some of their engravings of scenes of Mangbetu life are rendered in the catalogue as line drawings at the beginning of each chapter-precious little vignettes demon- strating how the Mangbetu saw themselves and wanted to be seen, how they reinvented themselves according to colonial perceptions. Other works show the colonials and derived from the artists' direct observations and their collections of European magazines. By exam- ining these aspects of the arts of northeastern Zaire, the authors may open the way for other studies of similar phenomena, which thus far have been neglected by researchers. Any shortcomings of African Reflections are certainly minor in light of the authors' tremen- dous achievement. I have already mentioned a certain repetitiveness. Another problem seems to arise from the nature of historical sources on material culture, an issue that deserves future attention. While early records-espe- cially ones in the German tradition of scholar- ship-often contain detailed descriptions of 22</page><page sequence="6">objects and their production, they seldom con- sider their symbolic aspects. Only in-depth interpretation, and, as in this case, analysis in the field, may fill the void. Yet Keim, who is first and foremost an economic historian, may not have revealed rich symbolic meanings and associations. The references to materials and their meanings tend to be a bit tedious, not symbolic analysis of the Victor Turner or Mary Douglas kind. One wonders about color sym- bolism, for example, or the particular proper- ties of some of the plants and animals mentioned in the text. Nevertheless, the authors went probably as far as they could considering the materials at hand. This smart and provocative book does away with old paradigms and popularizes new directions of inquiry. Although collec- tions and data as rich as the ones from the Congo Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History may be rare, they are probably not unique. It might be worthwhile for curators of older and more established museums to make forays into their rich his- torical holdings and make them equally accessible, as they were intended to be. Finally, this is an appealing book, beautifully designed and illustrated with Lang's superb field photographs and Lynton Gardiner's excellent images of the objects in the collec- tion of the American Museum of Natural History. The authors ought to be congratulat- ed for having made an outstanding and last- ing contribution to the understanding of the history of African art.

Reviewed by Robin Poynor I- This handsome book by Herbert Cole was published in conjunction with the exhibition of the same name at the National Museum of African Art, October 25, 1989-September 3, 1990 (reviewed by Philip Peek in African Arts, April 1990, pp. 81-82). The exhibition grew out of three thematic shows, each focusing on a recurrent image or theme in African art, that Cole organized at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art between 1983 and 1985. But Cole does not limit his discourse in this vol- ume just to objects in the Washington exhibi- tion. This is far more than an exhibition catalogue. He takes a comparative, cross-cul- tural approach to explore those recurrent themes and "the contexts, uses, and meanings of a wide variety of work from different times and places" (p. 8). m~~~~ i~1 25 tozj</page></plain_text>
