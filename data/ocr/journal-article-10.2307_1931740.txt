<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEES 1 Suitable for both lay and technical readers, this book gives a straightforward account of the gist of nearly four decades of intensive in- vestigation on problems indicated by the title. In substance it is the text of three lectures given by Professor von Frisch at Cornell University, The American Museum of Natural History, and the University of Minnesota, during a lec- ture tour of the United States in the spring of 1 von Frisch, Karl. 1950. Bees-their vi- sion, chemical senses, and language. 119 + xiii pp., 61 figs. Bibliography. Ithaca: Cornell University Press. $3.00. 1949. Like the lectures, the book is a model of scientific discussion for a mixed audience of scientists and laymen. interestingly presented in a direct, succinct and clear manner. It is an attractive book, cleanly printed and well illus- trated. This is the first inclusive account in English of the author's discoveries on a whole set of complex and difficult problems concerning the honey bee, including both results previously brought together in the author's "Aus dem Leber der Bienen" (now in its fourth edition) and more recent findings. The new book is valuable not only because of its content of ori-</page><page sequence="2">July, 1951 REVIEWS 563 ginal scientific results, but also because to an appreciable extent it gives the reader a com- prehension of the methods and thinking of an outstanding scientist at work. An ecological question concerning the rela- tionship of bees to flowering plants stands out in Chapter I, on "The Color Sense of Bees." Von Hess had drawn the erroneous conclusion that bees, since they collected in the green and yellow-green bands in his preference tests, must have a visual system equivalent to that of a color-blind human eye for which these are the brightest areas of the spectrum. Von Frisch showed that bees can distinguish wave-length stimuli visually, although the bee's color sense does not duplicate man's. Bees are red blind, for one thing. As Kiihn found in extending this work with spectral lights, bees can differen- tiate Yellow, Blue-green, Blue, and Ultraviolet qualitatively. This is a significant set of facts for ecology. Valuable discoveries by von Frisch and others have followed, concerning flower adaptations and distribution; the role of birds, adequately red-sensitive, and of red-sensitive butterflies, in pollinating certain flowers not visited by bees; the finding of an ultraviolet visual sensitivity in bees and many other insects which makes possible their visiting ultraviolet-reflecting blos- soms which are red or otherwise colorless to insects; chemoreceptive functions closely re- lated to vision in flower-visiting, and so on. For ecologists, there developed a picture of bees and flowers closely and mutually interrelated in evo- lution, as selective factors. "One can see that the colors of flowers have been developed as an adaptation to the color sense of their visitors." Further questions about flower-visiting led to the author's pioneering work on chemore- ception, discussed in Chapter II, "The Chemical Senses of Bees." Here, as in other chapters, readers learn how difficult scientific problems can be approached through a simple yet ade- quate methodology, guided by insight and in- genuity. Not only the sensory physiology of bees, but also questions concerning the evolution of flowering plants, receive clarification in these concise discussions. The story of comb-dancing by honey bees and its significance for flower-visiting, first reported by von Frisch about 30 years ago, is presented in Chapter III, "The Language of Bees," and in an appendix. But the "dances" cannot be considered alone. The effect of the finder bee upon the hive concerns a whole system of pro- cesses involving behavior, scent-gland function, chemoreception and odor-conditioning, and oth- ers based on the properties of bees in relation to flowers. Ecologists in particular will note the significant fact that finder bees, returning from flowers often at great distances, regurgi- tate from the honey stomach nectar containing flower perfume, unreduced in intensity by flight unlike substances carried on the body surface. The role of the scent-gland secretion is involved both in hive arousal and the finding of specific food places. Because of such relationships, sec- ondary bees normally are not only aroused in the hive but may be specifically influenced in their foraging behavior. The principle topic of the third chapter is the dancing of returned finder bees on the comb, long an unexplained phenomenon for which von Frisch's work has indicated the significance. The dancing, first of all, has a general arousal function, and also transmits olfactory stimuli from scent-gland secretions and from perfumes carried by finders. But von Frisch has demon- strated other functions beyond these. When steps are taken to rule out olfaction, dancing is still effective in specific ways. From results reported in 1946, von Frisch has corrected his initial interpretation of the "round dance" as a specific stimulus for nectar-gathering bees, the "wagging dance" as specific for pollen gatherers. In his terms, the round dance "announces" food at a nearby source, the wagging dance food at distances greater than 50 or 100 meters. But the wagging dance "tells" more. First of all, other bees are "informed" as to distance, which is "indicated" by a decrease in the number of wagging turns per unit time with increasing distance. "The time or the effort needed to reach the food seems to be the basis for the bee's estimation of distance"-since for example a head wind on the return slows the dances whereas a tail wind quickens them. In some manner, secondary bees are able to "understand the meaning of the dancer's rate of turning and can perceive the distance they must fly to reach the food." The wagging dance can have another effect, recent experiments show: from it secondary bees "learn the directions in which they must fly." The basis is an orientation of the finder bee to directed light, the "light-compass" effect first reported for ants by Santschi and later for bees by Wolf. The surprising result found by von Frisch for bees is that, on the comb in the dark, the direction of the wagging run with respect to the vertical corresponds to the direc- tion of the food place with respect to the sun. For instance, if the straight run is upward on the comb, "this apparently means 'The feeding place is in the same direction as the sun,' " if down, "'Fly away from the sun to reach the food.' " An interesting problem is revealed by this shift from visual terms to those of gravity on the dark comb, involving intersensory transposition, not unknown in invertebrates although better studied in vertebrates. The straight median run in the dark somehow depends on gravity, for it does not occur when the comb surface is</page><page sequence="3">564 REVIEWS Ecology, Vol. 32, No. 3 laid horizontally (in the dark). Von Frisch does not pursue the problem, but remarks simply "We may be sure that this meaningful relation- ship has developed gradually, like other abilities, in the course of the history of the species." As for the bees which are aroused by the dancing on the comb, they "recognize the angle of the dance relative to gravity, and in flying out to the food they remember this angle and relate it to the position of the sun." At any rate, the secondary bees somehow are direction- alized through the dance, for (with odor con- trols) their subsequent behavior bears a signifi- cant relationship to it. In one of the tests (at 250 meters), of 257 bees: 125 reached the actual food place, 95 diverged no more than 150 to either side, and the rest diverged no more than 450. Unfortunately, the writer of the book's jacket description overlooked this part, or he could not have misinterpreted the author's re- sults by stating that other bees go to "the exact spot . . . even if it is as far as three miles from the hive." The dances, and particularly the wagging dance, are a remarkable adaptation which greatly increases the efficiency of bee foraging. How are we to explain them and, in particular, their effect upon secondary bees? In view of von Frisch's precautions to exclude olfactory cues in the critical experiments, the finder bee's belhavior during the straight median run must somehow provide the cues. But when one ob- serves the dance situation in the motion-picture record or on the comb of an observation hive (through red glass), no immediate solution is apparent. Other bees are seen crowding ex- citedly around the finder during her run, hurry- ing after or beside her during the double-loop phase or shifting along in various positions during the straight median run, often axially placed and frequently oriented toward her ab- domen in this last phase. Von Frisch himself has said in a recent publication, "I do not know by what means the bees can appreciate the direction of the dance." In his major publica- tions on this topic (see Zoolog. Jahrb., Zool. Physiol., 1921, 38: 1-68; also Experientia, 1946, 2: 397-404), he has used the word "Sprache" in quotes, and there is no reason to believe that expressions of his such as: the wagging dance "tells" . . . and other bees are "informed" . . . (reviewer's quotes) are intended to suggest an anthropomorphic interpretation of his findings. It seems regrettable that, inevitably, some read- 2 von Frisch, K. Dances of the Bee. 16 mm., 850 ft.

Box 231, Cathedral Station, New York 25, N. Y. ers will conclude that such an interpretation is intended by the context. In this book, as in his scientific papers, von Frisch reports his evidence without any system- atic explanation of its psychological meaning. Actually, his results demonstrate a correspond- ence between the behavior of finder bees and of secondary bees in certain specific situations. The results do not, however, provide a basis for any particular theoretical explanation of the casual nexus between these parallel sets of events. As Dr. Griffin says in the Foreword to this book: "Von Frisch does not present us with vague or mystical speculations but rather with phenomena which, however astonishing they may be, are nonetheless concrete and readily observed." In view of this statement, this re- viewer considers it unfortunate that the Fore- word offers a vague psychological interpretation which goes considerably beyond the evidence in Chapter III of the book. It is not correct, as is implied, that "complex" behavior (as this certainly is) is necessarily "intelligent" in a higher-level sense. The reviewer, in his own studies on insect learning and "instinctive" phenomena, has been impressed with the capac- ity of insects for exceedingly complex behavior. Cases were studied which had been cited as ex- amples of higher mental capacities in insects. However, investigations directed specifically at psychological analysis showed clearly that the complex behavior was carried out without bene- fit of higher level (i.e., mammal-like) processes. It is assuredly not imperative to insist upon holding a simple explanation (i.e., one assuming lower-level psychological processes) provided this is demonstrated to be less adequate than a more presumptive one. Although this reviewer accepts the evidence of the book and of the von Frisch experiments, he cannot agree with the implication in the Foreword that "higher men- tal faculties" are involved. Nor can he fall into line with the recurrence of this thought in the statement that "We shall now be obliged to readjust our thinking about animal behavior in the light of these findings and the implications that flow from them." Other kinds of implica- tions also flow from these findings. Let us re- adjust our thinking appropriately as new evi- dence warrants a logical rearrangement of our previous concepts about phenomena, but let us not leap to extreme readjustments on a basis of analogies and impressions. This reviewer obtains from the von Frisch results an indication of a very complex, but nevertheless insect-like, bee-like mode of com- munication, rather than a human-like, really symbolic set of language processes. The ges- tural symbols of man are learned and are modi- fiable through experience, whereas the dances of the bee seem rigid and unstable under uni-</page><page sequence="4">July, 1951 REVIEWS 565 versally similiar extrinsic conditions. They are a product of a long-term biological evolution, it would appear, rather than of cultural pro- cesses. What the finder actually transmits to the secondary bees in the wagging run is still an unsolved problem; however, as a psychologist, this reviewer dobts that, when known, the transmission processes will meet the accepted psychological criteria of "symbolic communica- tion." No previously studied case of insect communication has met these criteria. The book ends with a fascinating sequel to the previous discoveries. Tests described in Chapter III show that finder bees (observed on a horizontal comb) dance not only with respect to direct sunlight hut also to light from a patch of sky. Experiments with filters show that light polarization is involved. In the Appendix are reported further investigations bearing on this phenomenon, performed since the 1949 lectures. Through the use of an ingeniously devised "artificial eye," von Frisch has demon- strated that the single ommatidium of the bee's eye with its 8 sensillae functions as a differential light-polarization analyzer, permitting orienta- tion with respect to particular brightness pat- terns of the sky. Thus we stand, the author says in closing, "at the theshold of new pro- blems." Thanks are due to Dr. Donald Griffin, whose initiative and efficient management made possible both the 1949 lectures and this valuable book. T. C.
