<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Revised View of the Nacrmr Palette W. A. Fairservis, Jr. The palette of Nacrmr (figs. 1, 2) is well known for its obvious importance as an historical docu- ment recording the earliest evidence so far avail- able to us of the unification of Egypt under a single monarch. It needs no reference here to emphasize how often it is described as a seminal statement for the rise of Pharaonic Egypt. In spite of the fact that the discovery of the palette by Quibell was not accompanied by the neces- sary documentation essential to modern archaeo- logical method, which leaves the location of the find uncertain, it does seem clear that it was found close to the "main deposit" in the so- called "temple enclosure" at Hierakonpolis.1 Hierakonpolis is, of course, generally recognized as the center of the worship of Horus of Nekhen. The correlation of Nacrmr with Nekhen, based on both the discovery of the palette and of a fragment of mace head bearing his name, adds a geographic fact to the pervasive idea that a king whose seat was in Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt. The palette itself on its two surfaces apparently shows Nacrmr as king of both Upper and Lower Egypt, as the two traditional crowns of the two lands appear to attest. Consequently, a literature has grown which attempts to cor- relate Nacrmr with Menes, the celebrated unifier of Egypt, according to Manetho. In this some- what controversial effort, the Nacrmr palette clearly has a central place.2 One must be challenged by what may be flaws in the interpretation of the palette and the atten- dant role given it in the history of the Pharaonic order. In the first place, the palette, along with the other objects of Archaic Egypt found at Hierakonpolis, were not in situ. That is, they all appear to have been "junked" by later occupiers of the temple area and are not thereby associated either with architecture or definable habitation layers in the stratigraphy. Indeed, our more re- cent excavations in the Kom el Gemuwia indi- cate that the expansion and main occupancy of the settlement was in the later First Dynasty.3 This, of course, does not obviate the probable fact that even in Nacrmr's day, the place was important; but it certainly puts into question its role as the capital of a newly unified Egyptian state. What is problematic about interpretations of the palette itself is what appears to be a signifi- cant methodological flaw. This is best illustrated by Sir Alan Gardiner's treatment of it; a treat- ment followed in one way or another by Egyp- tologists and others since the recovery of the object.4 Gardiner on the one side "reads" the combination "catfish-chisel" (which objects are inserted into the serekh found at the top of the palette) as "Nacrmr." This is, of course, based on the Middle Egyptian phoneticizing of these two objects. As Gardiner remarks, "Old Egyp- tian passes with but little modification into Mid- dle Egyptian." He makes a stab at phoneticizing the objects found over a kneeling figure (fig. 1, R-II) on the recto side of the palette as wc, harpoon, and s, pool, i.e., Washi, a possible name for the anthropomorph. He then aban- dons this approach and reads the palette accord- ing to its apparent iconography or what he 1 See B. Adams, Ancient Hierakonpolis, 2 vols. (Aris &amp; Phillips, 1974). 2 See W.

The Nacrmr Palette, recto.</page><page sequence="3">A REVISED VIEW OF THE NA'RMR PALETTE 3 Fig. 2. The Nacrmr Palette, verso.</page><page sequence="4">4 JARCE XXVIII (1991) refers to as "a complex of pictures which the spectator would then translate into words." This leads to a translation. ''The falcon-god Horus (i.e., Nacrmr) leads the captive inhabitants of the papyrus country." He accepts the idea that the papyrus country is Lower Egypt in the same reference. The verso of the palette can then be interpreted as representing a Nacrmr victory which he, as king of Lower Egypt, has brought about with the two long-necked felines repre- senting "the union of the two halves of Egypt." This interpretation can be said to be followed with one emphasis or another by Egyptologists, art historians, archaeologists, and others. However, one must question whether or not the abandonment of hieroglyphic translation for iconographic interpretation (or the abandonment of the former for the latter) is not, at the least, methodologically suspect. Our recent detailed inspection of the palette in the Cairo Museum as a part of the Hierakonpolis Project reveals that a considerable number of the symbols found on both surfaces of the palette are recognizable hieroglyphs or their prototypes. That inspection is necessary not only for the identity of the sym- bols themselves (petal-markings, sandal straps, papyrus lines, etc.), but also because there is a tendency in the drawing of the palette to leave out some elements. Note, for example, Emery's Archaic Egypt (his fig. 4, p. 45) where the rosette is left out of the drawing by the sandal -bearer on the verso side as well as the hawk-harpoon combination above the boat on that same side. The ancient detailing of the symbols and their order on the palette was made with great pre- cision as even a cursory review will show. It raises the question as to whether or not the scribal artist intended more than an obvious pictorial statement of royal or chiefly power. One notes, for example, that the so-called sandal - bearer does not hold the sandals in his hand, but rather they are attached to his wrist (fig. 1, R-II); the rosette in his proximity may not be simply a decorative element; the door-bird-boat-hawk- harpoon combination above the beheaded cap- tives could be more than a statement of the success of the ruler in using boats in battle; the long necked lion-headed beasts - which are cen- tral to one side of the palette - may not be the acceptance of a Mesopotamian motif for palette purposes as some would have it. The argument then, is that the ancient artist intended for the most part to have the palette read as a text, however skillfully he used the iconographic elements to reinforce what was literally stated. In other words, if we are to be consistent in the use of the palette as an histori- cal "text," we cannot abandon a hieroglyphic reading for an iconographic one - without sub- stantially investigating just how far one can go, both in reviewing the orthography and in re- assessing its interpretation. This was particularly manifest to this writer while examining the so-called "harpoon" (re- ferred to by Gardiner as w c). The usual harpoon in Predynastic Egypt is one with a single tang, a type common in Archaic Egypt as well. On the reverse of the Nacrmr palette, this harpoon type is depicted surmounted by a hawk (see fig. 2, V-II). Indeed, Gardiner's "harpoon" is not rep- licated elsewhere.5 Furthermore, at the notch are a series of incised grooves which indicate that the notch was critical to the function of the artifact (fig. 5, 26). Thus the evidence shows that the object is not a harpoon, but more than likely a toggle, line-hook, or pin, made of a carvable substance. There is no clear duplication of the object in the assemblages of artifacts known to be from the Archaic period. Notched or sculp- tured objects of this character are known, and usually they are identified as hairpins or toggles. In general, toggles or pins were made of ivory or bone (wood, apparently, was not generally used for objects of this kind). It needs no reference here to state that numerous ivory or bone objects of the period were commonly ornamented by notches or incisions. Following the methodology apparent in the rebus, "catfish-chisel," i.e., "Nacrmr," could it be that the "pin" and the rectangular "pool" beneath are intended to be read in a similar way? Gardiner (Sign List, U.23) briefly discusses the possibility that the sign \ , ostensibly meaning chisel (rar), could also be read as 3b. He points out that the sign may represent a hairpin. Since 5 See W. M. Petrie, Tools and Weapons (1917), PI. XLIV-24. Some early examples have several tangs, but the single tang is the more usual. Note also Winifred Needier' s Predynastic and Archaic Egypt in the Brooklyn Museum, (1984); 47-199. In later Egypt, note F. LL. Griffith, Beni Hasan IV (1896), PI XIII, for the persistance of the single tang.</page><page sequence="5">A REVISED VIEW OF THE NA'RMR PALETTE 5 we do have a depiction of a chisel in the palette, there is a possibility that there was a term mean- ing hairpin or toggle syllabized as Bb, and that Y is not a chisel, but a hairpin (or a pin or fastener used on the person). This would also be in keeping with the possibly decorative incisions at the notch or, conceivably, as a mount for other ornaments. If 3b is the syllabization, it must refer to something fundamental to the palette. The con- text relates it to the larger scene of ruler and those subordinate to him in one way or another. This is evidence that either the place of, or the name of, the kneeling figure (with which the "glyphs" are associated) is meant. Thus, the sign may mean ivory, Bbw , the material of which the pin is made which carries (almost paradoxically) a determinative for "harpoon" in its Middle Egyptian form ( fj^).6 It suggests that the ancient scribe may have intended to indicate by shaping the piece to broadly resemble a har- poon, that he meant "ivory," as in harpoon points, but not a harpoon per se. This is, of course, a viable alternative to the identification of it as a pin or toggle as outlined above, or more likely a natural convergence of form, mate- rial, and syllabization. If we grant the possibility the 3b was the syllabization involved, the "pool of water" sign, sn(t) or ns or s viably follows. Or is it possible that the grapheme is a determinative? On the face of it 3b refers to Elephantine, the land of (or for) ivory, \ J^K} &gt; anc* tne P°°l to tne marshy or watered conditions at the first cataract: thus Bbs. The other possibility is that ns refers to the expulsion of enemies from 3b ( ^ -A ), in keep- ing with the battle action shown on the palette; or possibly sni (c= JL )&gt; "repel" or "encircle." However, it is possible that sn (snt) refers to a person, as in ^s==&gt; , or J^^ , as in "sheriff" or "constable," with the large figure of the king (and his follower) the determinative for the indi- vidual involved. We can thus establish Bbsn as a likely reference to the ruler of Elephantine - the bearded personage who kneels haplessly before Nacrmr. It is significant that Hilda Petrie lists only three signs from the Nacrmr palette in her com- pendium of Archaic Egyptian signs and that Kaplony, whose definitive study of Archaic Egyp- tian is represented largely by seals and sealings, does not deal with the palette at all.7 It is par- ticularly the latter, however, who demonstrates the phonetic value of Archaic Egyptian gra- phemes based primarily on Middle Egyptian. This is vitally important in the application of the rebus principle to the Nacrmr palette itself. This method then, is to identify the grapheme clearly in terms of what it represents and then to find its phonemic value in Middle Egyptian when possible. Once in possession of the phone- ticization, one can then apply the rebus principle. In implementing this principle, some care must be taken to identify sources in the Pyramid Texts or other potential sources for Old King- dom material. That this is not always possible is attested to by the following sign list. The Sign List Recto (figures 1, 3, 4, 5) 1 Serekh (srh) Facade of a temple or palace: a common Meso- potamian motif.8 Used to frame the names of leaders (kings?) during the Archaic period.9 the Nacrmr example appears to represent a gate with niched walls on either side. The serekh is usually associated with the Hr name of the ruler. 2 Catfish Generally accepted as representative of the syllable ncr- with some hesitancy.10 It is pos- sibly homophonic to terms for "fear," "dread," and "charges after enemy," ^ , with suitable determinatives.11 6 Note H.

The Nacrmr Palette. has to be duly considered. Note mnh as "power- ful" in this context, »|| . 4 Bovid head with human face There are four such heads, two on each side of the palette, forming the initial and terminal ends of the topmost stanza and bounding the central serekh in each case. Each face is differ- ent from the other in terms of how the bovid- bounded space is filled and in the expression of the mouth and eyes. That bulls are repre- sented is arguably evident in the context of the palette itself. Furthermore, the heads de- picted are so massive, the curve of the horns so distinct that they suggest buffalo.14 Egyp- tian cattle are generally shown with straight or ow^-curving horns.15 Vandier conceives of these heads as representative of the goddess Hathor,16 and this is followed by others.17 Ex- cept that the human faces are beardless, this assignment to a goddess appears tenuous, to say the least. It should be noted that other representations of human-faced bovids are rare appearances for First Dynasty Egypt. A more likely interpretation of this motif is that it is intended to emphasize the strength and power of Nacrmr. Thus a reading of mr- hnt with (^] "£?$ hnt as "face" to differen- tiate from &lt;£&gt; , hr, "the bearded face." Hnt in this case is homophonic to hnt without the determinative for face, meaning "in front of" or&gt; as fffi ^^ &gt; hnty, foremost. Thus a read- ing of "foremost bull" as an epithet for Nacrmr is possible; or if the intention in differentiat- ing among the bovid heads is to describe different individuals, it may be that the combi- nation with the serekh means to place him as "foremost among leaders." It should be noted that human-faced bulls are a well-known motif of Early Dynastic Sumer.18 5 Seven- or six-petaled flower As such, this grapheme is confined to the First Dynasty, but its identification as a flower is quite clear, since the petals are well drawn and center about the carpel. In Middle Egyp- tian, the determinative for flower is hni (Sign List, M2), drawn as a group of flowers ^^_ . 14 Compare, for example, the heads of a buffalo with those of cattle in U. Mochi and T. D. Carter, Hoofed Mam- mals of the World (Scribners, 1953, 1972), chs. 23 and 25. 15 For example, Mereruka, Vol. II, PL 153, The Mastaba of Mereruka, Saqqarah Expedition, Vol. II (Chicago, 1938), 153.

The develop- ing stalk is perhaps represented at Beni Ha- san.19 Since only the reed, lotus, papyrus, and sedge are represented in the Archaic period along with the lily, it is likely that the deter- minative for flower was carried over - nu, forms of the lily or its relatives in the marsh- lands. In any case, the polysyllabic hrrt for flower does not appear to be a viable syllabiza- tion for this symbol. On the other hand, hn(i) |^L, has rebus meanings in keeping with the palette context. Thus, |^jj , "govern," andJ^^O^ ^, hnw, "commands." The lily flower or rosette motif is common in Meso- potamian Early Dynastic seals or earlier.20 6 Lotus rhizome This is associated with the flower (#5, above) on the palette and mace head and related to the subordinate male (fig. 7). The rhizome takes two forms in Middle Egyptian, Q , $ (Sign List, M31, M32) and as ^ in J (Sign List, Ml 2). A likely translation in the context of the palette is that it is the latter meaning that is indicative, i.e., "thousand." Note the absence of this sign for thousand in Archaic Egyptian. Here it can be syllabized by hS. 7 Figure of a young man Clearly this figure relates to at least four graphemes (8, 9, 10, 11) and the hieroglyphs (5 and 6). As such, it can be considered a kind of determinative for the whole, whose intent is to reinforce or describe the relationships or qualities of Nacrmr. It is notable that many of the anthropomorphic determinatives of Mid- dle Egyptian leave the arm hanging, while the other performs or holds the object involved. His walking stance, suggestive of "follower," indicates the term ^ fj± , sms, "to follow" or "accompany"; note smsw. 8 Pendant hanging from the neck of grapheme 7 The orthography indicates that the ribbon or cord from around his neck is bound to a bar or bead slightly raised at the end. The ends of the ribbons then protrude below. There are Archaic hieroglyphic examples of these pen- dants.21 The evolution of the sign then ap- pears to be ^ (from ^ - a reconstruct) to ^ ^ . This is in contradiction to Gardiner's assumption that the cnh was a sandal strap (Sign List, S34). The syllabization allows us to establish a rebus for ^ @ , "person" or "captive," with the subordinate anthropo- morph sign 7 as determinative. 9 Pair of sandals It should be noted that the sandals are attached to the wrist of 7 and not held by the hand. The sandals are elaborate-appearing and are, we assume, the property of Nacrmr. The terms tbt or tbwty, $ f or s^J ^ $$ , have no homo- phonic cognates viable for the palette context. We must conclude that the barefootedness of Nacrmr shown on the palette is a sign of contempt for his enemies (see sign 13). How- ever, it is possible that the sandal bearer's name was Tbwty, possibly a high status title at the time. 10 Girdle knot This is triangular in shape with pendants, one of which appears to be a bull's tail (see sign 18). The prominence of this triangular knot suggests the term tst, as in "girdle knot," if fXI7 JLo or ^T *s meant - the binding of the two pendants; perhaps the meaning in context being tst, ^ j§ &gt; or "troops." 1 1 Handled vessel with spout This type of vessel is shown in Archaic seals. It is associated with a special oil, hnm.22 As such, it has determinative and homophone cognates in hnm, &lt;j}j^fl , "to unite" or "unity." 12 Thin flat platform This serves as a base for Nacrmr and some of his followers or representatives. It acts as a 19 F. LI.

It is then, the one the account set forth on the palette involves and whom the graphemes in the serekh label. The idea of demonstrating dominance by compara- tive size is often a characteristic of royal su- periority in Dynastic Egypt and needs little reference here.23 14 Headdress worn by Nacrmr This is, of course, the white crown worn by the rulers of Upper Egypt in Pharaonic times. It is presumed to be of basket or cloth manufacture since it was apparently worn easily. The term hdt, } o ^. , for the crown carries at least two homophonic cognates: |l , "mace" and \q\ , hdt, "white" and "dawn." Nacrmr's mace- wielding attitude on the palette and the pos- sibility that the shape of the headdress is a stylization of the piriform mace-head common to the times have particular importance to the origin of the headgear. In turn, the relationship of the color white and its implication of "dawn" suggests that there was a further symbolic mean- ing, that of the east. The constructive aspect of "red" for the other Nacrmr headdress (sign 35), with its implication of "sunset" gives a certain validity to the idea that Nacrmr, at least in his day (that is, at the beginning of the Archaic Age), was regarded as a ruler from or of the east. 15 Artificial beard and band securing it to the face That this appendage is artificial in character is clear from the construct with a real beard as seen on the bearded figure represented in signs 21, 22. Bearded heads are used as ideograms for "head," tp, © (Sign List, Dl) and "face," &lt;? , hr, in Middle Egyptian. They are also graphemes in Archaic Egyptian.24 The latter hr is a common hieroglyph of Archaic Egyp- tian, though it does not apparently come into usage as a hieroglyph per se until the Second Dynasty.25 Since it is the side view with which we are dealing here, it is obvious that there is a specific meaning attached to that aspect of artificial beard-wearing. Noteworthy is the fact that other figures on the palette also wear artificial beards (signs 25, 29, 47, 53, 55, 58). The reading of tp provides a direct homo- phone in words for "chief" or "head" (as leader).26 In the context of the palette this reading indicates that all artificially bearded individuals are to be "read" as "chiefs" - with Nacrmr, of course, paramount among them. Beards as markers of heroes, kings, or power- ful beings are found in Sumerian context as well.27 16 Wielded piriform mace In this context, with the figure of Nacrmr as determinative, the action of striking is in- tended. As such, the verb skr, p g^ , "to smite," with its mace determinative, is the most suitable reading. The piriform mace was not a principal weapon in Mesopotamia and appears to be an essentially Egyptian weapon. 17A Skirt, girdle and shoulder piece This accoutrement worn by Nacrmr is domi- nated by four bull's head ornaments made apparently of beads and fine thread hung from the metal heads which we can assume were attached to the belt. The belt itself is decorated with a net design of diamond shapes with punctate centers. The whole was attached to the plain over- the- left- shoulder shirt held by a thick knot-clasp, suggesting that the garment was of leather or heavy cloth. The richness of the girdle and skirt combination indicates its symbolic importance. In particular, the four 23 For example, B. de Rachewiltz, Egyptian Art (New York, 1960, English translation), 52. 24 Petrie, II, III (1927); Kaplony III, abb. 279, and II, 1130, III, 419 and II, 1149. 25 Note F.

Ac- cordingly, we can interpret his dress as a prototype for the later sacred robe of Pha- raonic Egypt. 17B Dress worn by Nacrmr This is on the verso side of the palette and exhibits the over-shoulder and knot combina- tion of sign 17 A. The belt too is ornamented with what appears to be a similar design. The skirt, however, is ornamented quite differently. It appears to consist of two rectangular com- partments, the left one characterized by dots or spots arranged in slanting rows, the right side by similarly slanted lines. The divider is a vertical band which meets a similar band at the right angled hem. There is apparently no particular symbolization implied here; rather, perhaps, the intent is to contrast the two robes of Nacrmr - one as an expression of power, the other, of affluence. 18 Bull's tail with handle The long hairs of the bovid are clearly seen as is the bound handle (see sign 55). This is not a lion's tail, as some would have it. A lion's tail has a distinct plume at its furthest end. The term for tail, sd, P n^ , significantly carries a similar plume as its determinative. In context, the idea of the bull-like power of Nacrmr is symbolized by the attachment of this object to his person as represented on both sides of the palette. The possible rebus in P^3^^ , sd3, "to tremble," is perfectly in keeping with this concept. 19 Hawk or falcon The discovery of the palette at Hierakonpolis or Nekhen, sacred in later times to Horus of Nekhen, leaves little doubt that the palette hawks are simply an early example of the relationship of that cult god to the ruling power, i.e., the concept of the ruler as the living Horus. The hawk most frequently ap- pears upon the serekhs of Archaic kings.29 In the palette setting, the hawk, or Hr, has a decided secularity and there is no evidence that the relationship between Hr and Nacrmr is that of god and ruler. Rather, it is another demonstration of the iconographic statement made by reference to bulls (signs 4, 57). Here Hr as the hawk is probably to be taken as the bird who attacks from above or "falls upon," ^ ^ y hry: that habit which is natural to birds of prey. Indeed, the grapheme is inevi- tably found above what it seizes or honors. 19A Hawk with human arm This sign carries through the concept of a hawk's ability to seize, combined with the ruler's identical ability to do so. The term for arm, ^J0 , c (or cnd) is also that for region or province30 and, in combination with Hr, car- ries the meaning of the seizure of a certain region presumably stipulated in the palette by the rope and victim below. 20 Cylinder seal associated with Nacrmr's hand This is often misinterpreted as Nacrmr grasp- ing the top knot of his victim. Close inspec- tion proves that the object rests on the back of his hand or closed fist. There is a faint line across the wrist suggesting a "strap," but this is not confirmable. An object of the shape depicted is most probably an illustration of a seal. Thus, fj^g , htm, for which the deter- minative, Q , (Sign List, S20) or £v&gt; . (S19), appears to be a viable equivalent for the Nacrmr example.31 The context here is that the ruler puts his seal on the victim and thus on his property. The purpose of seals is, of course, to identify the seal -user symbolically in any setting - even when the seal-user is not present. 21 A bearded human head - attached to a lozenge- shaped body from which six papyrus stalks protrude. This is obviously to be read in com- bination (signs 22, 23, 24).

The head hair falls in eight stanzas as if carefully arranged in an ethnically determined style. Clearly it is sup- posed to represent a particular people. 23 Clump of papyrus stalks and flowers This has a parallel in the determinative, &amp; , hz. Characteristically a bunch of three or four stalks forms a papyrus grapheme in Archaic Egyptian.32 The significance of the number of papyrus stems is lost. It may well be that it represents six districts symbolized by the indi- vidual papyrus stalks. In conjunction with sign 24, this may be the case. In any event, the syllabization, hz, for papyrus in Archaic times appears to be valid, since the alternate deter- minative for papyrus in Middle Egyptian, ^ , is absent. 24 Part of the combination with sign 22 In its completed form, it is &lt;=&gt; , which, with plants growing out of it, carries a connotation of wetland or inundated lands: sB, £B (Sign List, M8).33 In combination with sign 23, it refers to marshland. The hz in combination with sign 24 probably refers to inundated land or, in effect, the Nile's alluvial lands, 25 Kneeling figure, head turned to the right The figure wears a loin cloth, has an artificial beard, and the hair is arranged in three stanzas at the back with waves at the top. According to the interpretation of sign 13, the individual represents a chief whose physical position gives evidence of complete subjugation. His identity is established by the graphemes (signs 26, 27, 28) located close to the back of his head. 26 Notched pin or fisherman's line -hook This object is made of bone or ivory and is nicked at the notch, as if to specify its func- tion and material. It is the nicking at the notch and the tusk shape that evidences that the piece represents ivory.34 That it is not a typical bone harpoon is signified by the usual depiction of harpoons in the Archaic (sign 50, for example).35 As ivory, it is syllabized as Bb. In terms of place, this is possibly a homo- phonic cognate for Bbw, ^ J , Elephantine (see p. 5). 27 Grapheme for "pool" combined with that for "water" The identification of "pool" (Sign List, N37), s, involves an inundated area in its early form. 28 Stylization of ££ : the sign for "water" (Sign List, N35), nt. The combination &lt;=&gt; fit as snt is probably homophonic to Jt^ , meaning "sheriff" (see 6, 7), with the kneel- ing homophone as determinative. 29 Two naked figures or chiefs (see sign 15) They are looking over their right shoulders and appear to be running (or swimming) away, presumably from Nacrmr. The hair style of both is suggestive of the kneeling figure (sign 25). There are a number of examples of swimming figures in Archaic Egyptian.36 As such, the syllabization, nbi (Kaplony, nbj) is involved: T^~E also GLS^ • The rebus nb, ^zp , meaning "all," "every" (Faulkner, 129) provides a translation, namely that the swimming posture was a deliberate determina- tive designating all the people involved as fleeing from Nacrmr. 30 Battlemented enclosure - found commonly in Archaic Egyptian.37 The Middle Egyptian de- terminative for "wall" is apparently derived from this grapheme (Sign List, O36 - see foot- note). The glyph itself depicts the complete 32 Petrie(1927), 401-8, 433-34. 33 This sign should not be confused with signs for "land," like &lt; ... * (N16) or "sandy tract" &lt; * (N18). The asso- ciation with plants, meaning "watered land," is specifically intended. There is often a confusion in distinguishing be- tween the papyrus and the lotus determinative. But the crescent-shaped papyrus and the cup-shaped lotus are clearly different. However, both plants are water plants and in context, can refer to marshland. 34 See W. F. M.

The Middle Egyptian with its particular deter- minative, "enclosing wall," carries the notion of capture. However, it is possible that the causative sbhE, "to make to flee," PJruj^k , or simply "flee," bhi&gt;, or bhSw, "fugitive" is meant. 31 Girdle knot with a papyrus head motif. This combines the knot motif (sign 10) with the papyrus (sign 21), thus, ts(t) with h3. The combination carries a sense of capture with ts related to "tie" or "bind up" (Sign List, S24).

The homophonic cognate, bij, Jj &lt;] jg^ y , for "bronze" or "cop- per" and "king" or "marvelous person" bi(S)ty (sign 36) and that of the word for "hundred," sn I snt "to surround," JL^Lo (e.g.). provides the sense of crown-wearer as one who captures "hundreds" (many) foes, animals, lands, etc. Excursus The color combination of red and black in the crown in contrast to the white (hdt) crown, where "east" is a possible reading (sign 14), carries the notion that originally the red crown referred to the west, the place of red sunset and the consequence when "all" (snt) became en- closed by black night. 38 Flagellum or flail The nhlhE, flail, ^ \ \ m I \ K, of the Pyra- mid Texts (Faulkner, 137) is possibly cognate to words meaning "victory," gp* ^ , or "strong" or "to protect," *JST»-^ . 39 Piriform mace held horizontally or displayed vertically 4 , hd (see signs 14, 16). 40 Striding woman - mistakenly referred to by Vandier as a scribe.42 That the figure repre- sents a woman is established by the conven- tional long hair, the swell of the breast, and the skirt- like garment or dress which is tied by a loop knot at the neckline. Her dress, which leaves her right shoulder bare, is decorated with a peculiar dotted ornamentation sugges- tive of a leopard skin. In front is a tail-like object which reaches to the knee, perhaps a sash ribbon. Her left arm crosses her body reaching to the right shoulder while the right arm is held vertically with the hand open and facing to the rear. She wears sandals and strides determinedly forward. Notable is the long narrow eye area suggestive of the con- ventions of eye makeup of later times. 41 Woman's dress with two papyrus plants bending downwards - apparently springing from the shoulder knot. The attitude of these plants recalls the determinative for queens in Middle Egyptian (37). Her active position in front of Nacrmr carries that royal notion as well. 42 Tethering rope for animals with the syllabic value i (Sign List, V13). 43 Loaf of bread with the syllabic value t (XI).43 Excursus The proximity of these hieroglyphs (see signs 42, 43) to the striding woman suggest that they refer to her; hence, tt. She also appears on the Nacrmr mace head, but only with sign 41. Thus her name was probably (t(v)t(v) and was Nacrmr's queen of that name. 44 Four standard bearers - marching before Nacrmr and his queen. Each of these wears an artificial beard except the first from the left. The leftmost two are clad in the apron-skirt characteristic of the time and each dress is tied at the waist with a girdle knot. The ribboned girdle knot found on the recto side occurs on the two rightmost figures, but in this case they appear to be naked. The differentiation made by dress, or lack of it, is also demonstrated by the heads. The two righthand figures have hair hanging to their shoulders. The next from the right has hair cut off at the neck, while the leftmost figure has a more rounded scalp and a tight hair arrangement like those of sign 55. These carefully delineated differen- tiations give evidence that the standard bearers represent the variety of peoples subject to and supportive of the ruler. One notes, for ex- ample, the likeness of the two righthand figures to the lowermost group on the recto side 41 Griffith, Beni Hasan III (1896), PI IV-52. 42 Vandier, Manuel, 1,598. 43 Kaplony I, 242.</page><page sequence="15">A REVISED VIEW OF THE NA'RMR PALETTE 15 of the palette and the fact that the double- ribboned grapheme represented by the girdle knot is equivalently associated. 45 Standard - on which are entrails or excrement (Sign List, F52). Note the Middle Egyptian sign, ^3 , is the reverse of sign 44. The syllabization, hS, \ y *£&gt; , has a rebus in hsi, \ \~j± &gt; "to turn back" (defeat) or ' 'confront" an enemy. The standard thus symbolizes Nacrmr's defeat of enemies but is also probably a descriptive icon which, like Nacrmr's bare feet, carries a connotation of contempt for his foes. 46 Jackal bearing standard This is a jackal (not wolf, note the pointed ears). The syllabization, sib, for jackal carries a homophone, sUb, \*Kyj^ &gt; a "warden" or "governor." 47 Woven cloth on a standard topped by a hawk The two hawk-dominated standards are for all intents and purposes identical. Clearly the right angled objects below the animals are the significant symbols in relationship to hr, or hawk. There are pieces of cloth delineated by woof threads on the horizontal side and by the completed cloth marked by the warp on the vertical.44 The general term for cloth, hbs, I J PT &gt; gives us a rebus for hb, "to celebrate a triumph" (?). Thus hr hbs, the "hawk king" triumphant, is given double emphasis by the paired standards. 48 Door - note the panelling in the detailing. This is a well-known grapheme in Archaic Egyptian.45 The door is known as a horizontal determinative in Middle Egyptian (Sign List, O31), hence % "door." The rebus for "great" or "greatness" is probably here, Tl\ ^fl • How- ever, the door itself gives a sense of place, thus S^ , cd, "column" or "pillar" (as in a build- ing) may be meant. This is then modified by the adjectival wr which follows on the right. 49 Swallow Note the square tail as indicated in Gardiner's Sign List (G36). Hence, wr or "great." This is a modifier for sign 48, CS; wr perhaps a superla- tive in Nacrmr's title signifying "greatness." However, it could mean "great door" in refer- ence to a certain place (see sign 48). 50 Single barbed harpoon This is represented in the Pyramid Texts as ^-, thus ^5 1 , w c (Sign List, T21), equivalent to "one." Thus, Hr wc with hr, meaning Nacrmr, to be interpreted as the only one, the unique one, i.e., the great one; carrying the sense of the leader having accomplished events by himself, or because of his unique power.46 51 Boat with high prows and cabins with the emblem of Neith (sign 52). The boat was probably a warship considering the events celebrated on the palette as a whole and with the presence of the arrow goddess, Neith. Hence, chjt, • JD*^ , "warship," x with • t lei , m x root morphemes in t chS, ftfyjl , "to right" m and chjw, /j^^«-« &gt; "arrow." 52 Symbol of Neith The crossed elements that make up the symbol of Neith are by no means confined to arrows.47 The evolution of the symbol is still uncertain, but it is found in the late Predynastic in Upper Egypt.48 In other words, though Neith is known from Dynastic times as the patron goddess at Sais in the delta, her antecedents are known in Upper Egypt. Indeed, the fact that her crossed arrow emblem is found on the ribboned poles associated with the sacred stan- dards49 indicates that a sacred quality adhered in Upper Egypt. Thus the appearance of the Neith symbol on the Nacrmr palette is not of itself sufficient to involve him with the delta district. 44 Petrie, Royal Tombs I, VI 4, 8; note the vertical threads are left hanging. 45 For example, Petrie, Royal Tombs I, PI XV- 16; Kap- lony III, abb. 389, 391, 399. 46 Note the use of the grapheme in Hr-Chi&gt;, second or first monarch of the First Dynasty, e.g., Emery, Archaic Egypt, fig. 9. 47 For example, note Petrie (1927), 769 and 775. 48 W.

Nt, ic^^ , the box- like center of the motif as it appears on the palette is, however, not depicted elsewhere, to my knowledge. Here, it is possibly an artist's convention. 53 Ten decapitated bodies bound at the elbows - set in two rows of five each. Two on the upper left have their feet turned to the left, but the remainder are pigeon-toed. Possibly this is an artist's convention, but it may have had an- cient significance in view of other detailing on the palette. The heads (sign 54) lie between the legs of the executed. It appears that the depicted victims were ten in number because the scribe wished to iden- tify them collectively. Thus, md, 0 , can be related to ^^| ^ , "bonds" (Faulkner, 123), indicating the bound captives and hence to j^* i 3k^ ^ &gt; mdDiv, the people of Medja(y), of Nubia. 54 Heads belonging to the group of sign 53 All of these appear to possess artificial beards and thus can be identified as chiefs (sign 15). Nine of the heads have a peculiar headdress suggestive of feathers, which one can assume aided in identifying their "barbaric" and eth- nically demonstrative status. This is in keep- ing with the Medja(y) presumed to be depicted in sign 53. The heads, per se, may be read as dn tp, SS^&gt;£&gt; , "beheaded chiefs" of the Medja(y) or possibly, T^"^ , sni.

The central and dramatic stanza of the verso side Figure 2, V-III 55 Two artificially bearded men- with scalp- clinging hairdos, appropriately skirted, each holding a rope. The ropes are held slackly. The artificial beards (sign 15) signify the chiefly status of the individuals involved. Both bend at the waist and their legs are apart and situ- ated as if ready to take strain, if necessary. The hair is depicted as a series of tight knots or cords, differing from all other hair depictions on the palette, except possibly for the standard bearer on the left in sign 45. This type of hair is characteristically found among the negroes of Africa.50 Notable are the skirt garments which apparently possessed an apron-like tie in front, now made obvious by the leaning forward of the wearers. 56 Two panthers - with long serpent-like necks which wind about one another forming a circular pocket at center. The intertwining of the necks of the panthers creates the impres- sion of a fundamental unit and the relative ease with which the two men hold the atten- dant ropes provides the notion of a state of watchful well-being. ? I /I /I The term for "panther," 3by, ? ^^^^* I /I /I , coupled with that for "neck," nhbtf ^|J ^ , and hence "to harness" or "yoke," nhb, ^ I J 21d y nhb, indicates that the panthers are symbolic of a place or people, the Bby, possibly the people of Elephantine (see sign 26). In this case, the paired animals may repre- sent the two parts of the region which are now united under Nacrmr, a fact not necessary to include in the account found on the recto side of the palette where the rulership is being established (note f J JLj , Sbh, "to unite"). In all, suggestive of the total conquest of that part of Nubia (including the Medja(y)?), but most likely both banks of the Nile Valley in the Elephantine and Edfu districts. 57 Tethering rope - held in signs 55 and by the hawk of sign 19; probably ^ O^I^ nwh, hence nwh "to bind enemies."

The tail of the animal replicates that shown on Nacrmr's person (signs 13, 18, 34). As a fighting or charging bull, it re-identifies the term "Nacrmr" (signs 2, 3). It is not simply a bull, per se, but an active enemy attacking, hence, "Nacrmr." 59. Semi-circular battlemented structure This falls into the category of sign 30. How- ever, its broken quality shows that it was intended to depict a smashed fortress for which the bull, i.e., Nacrmr, was responsible. For this reason, the determinative for "overthrow," based on the fallen wall ideogram, fits the situation. Thus, jM3,^ »^u , whn, or pos- sibly, PSs^C^, shnn, "demolish." In this sense, the grapheme is meant to be verbal with the bull, sign 58, as substantive. 60 Grapheme - whose central position in the structure, sign 59, appears to identify it. The sign appears to represent a storehouse with sloping sides and two pillars in support. The roof is flat between the pillars. That it is probably not a shrine is ascertained by com- paring it with depictions of early shrines which usually have curved and/or rounded roofs, and often steps leading up the slopes at the base.51 The best identification appears to be that it represents a granary. Here the two supports at the sides and the slope of the sides and the flat roof, are represented in the deter- minative (Sign List, O51). However, this gra- pheme is represented for the Archaic as well.52 Thus snwt, Mori , "granary," or J^ &lt;£&gt;, snw, "to enclose" (grain?), is the possible syllabiza- tion. But note "shrine" as snwt, HI £c"3 (Faulkner, p. 230). 61 Three small rectangles - by the head of sign 62 and part of the enclosure, sign 59. These are replicated in one way or another in the so-called Libyan tribute palette, now in Cairo. It appears that three small geometric figures are representative of weights (of metal?). One notes, for example, their representation in the Old Kingdom, as in the case of the nobleman Mereruka.53 The rectangular symbol is also a determinative in dbn, JLc=&gt; • It is not difficult to conceive of these graphemes in the various palettes as representing the "treasure" or, in this case, "loot" of a besieged town: in effect, the amount taken from the granary or store- house, sign 60. The equivalencies in value are, of course, unknown, but clearly each rep- resented great value at the time - here multi- plied three times. 62 Naked, artificially bearded male figure being trampled by the great bull. The hair is long and has a distinct sweep, while the arms and the backs of the hands to the ground give a sense of helplessness - possibly even death. The identity of the fortress and its helpless inhabitants whose settlement is being looted by Nacrmr, appears to rest on the identifica- tion of sign 60. If it is a shrine, then it must refer to a particular shrine, since shrines in general are not usually referred to in Pha- raonic history. The references appear to be consistently specific, however listed. Conse- quently, one can assume that this particular structure refers to that of a given place or people. The reference in the upper stanzas and on the recto side, to Nubia as Bbw or Medja, suggests that Nacrmr looted their shrines. However, there is a different look to the victim here, as noted above. Thus a "place" called snwt or snt or even snwt or snt is pos- sible. Note also - J^NlM , snbw, "battle- ments." The long hair suggests the notion snw as long-haired one, JJos"^ • Thus the "looting of the fortress of the long-haired" is a possible reading here. A Possible Translation of the Nacrmr Palette A "translation" of the Nacrmr palette can be made on the basis of the interpretation of the signs which make it up. These are arranged by stanzas and by sign clusters as set forth in the figures. 51 Petrie, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, 593, 594, 595; also Gardi- ner, 18-20; Davies, Ptahhetep I, 36. 52 Petrie, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, 599 and 600.

Summary and Conclusion On the basis of this "translation," it is likely that the palette was created for Tbwty cnh (the "sandal-bearer") who was a commander in Nacrmr's military force when they were cam- paigning along the Nile Valley in Upper Egypt and Northern Nubia. Nacrmr is referred to as "Charging Bull," "powerful bull"; and so it is clear that cattle had a substantive symbolic meaning. John McCardle has pointed out that in locality 29 (the late Predynastic site), Hiera- konpolis cattle constituted 53% of the fauna identified, most of them mature beasts. The evi- dence indicates that "the Predynastic people maintained individual cattle for longer periods of time than they kept either goats or sheep." He goes on to suggest that cattle were important for reasons beyond their value as walking reser- voirs of protein.54 The importance of cattle in Pharaonic Egypt is obvious: royal epitaphs over many periods, portrayed in the tomb reliefs of the Old Kingdom; stipulated yearly cattle events by the Fifth Dynasty (and these events depicted graphically in the models of Maket-Re); Snefru boasts of bringing back 200,000 cattle from his Nubian campaign; the name of the reported founder of Dynasty I, Menes, may well have meant herdsman, j^ ft/) , mni (etc.), and that of a late "Monarch" of that same dynasty, Smrkht, may well be translated as "Bull's Son." 54 J. McArdle, "Preliminary Report on the Predynastic Fauna of the Hierakonpolis Project" in The Predynastic of Hierakonpolis- an Interim Report by M. A. Hoffman, 1982, Pub. No. 1 (Egyptian Studies Association), 119. In that same publication, note the article "The Predynastic Flora of the Hierakonpolis Region" by M. N. el Hadidi, 109. In it, he notes "a wetter climate which created a habitat favorable for agriculture, pastoralism, and an arid wooded grassland where Impereta and Balanites may have . . . provided pasture for the grazing animals."</page><page sequence="19">A REVISED VIEW OF THE NA'RMR PALETTE 19 In all, it is evident that cattle were prized not only for their qualities of strength and for their nutritional value, but also as a sign of wealth and power for the individual who possessed them in great number - cattle as a sign of wealth is ethnographically widespread.55 There is evi- dence that in Nacrmr's day, some cattle were probably kept specifically as markers of wealth - whatever their role as a nutritional resource. In a period when rainfall, and thus the moistening of pasture land, was so uncertain that the condi- tion of the land often approached total aridity, the maintenance of large herds of cattle was precarious.56 As a consequence, it is not difficult to imagine conflict - already age-old - between the agriculturists on the flood plain of the Nile and the semi-pastoralists, whose wealth and power depended on the availability of grass and water. The major responsibility of late Predynas- tic and early Archaic leadership was to balance the land and water needs of both. The tradi- tional tendency of herding people to look down upon cultivators may have been an underlying factor in the aggressiveness of the former toward the latter - a major theme of the Nacrmr and other palettes.57 There is little doubt that con- flicts involving attacks on the strongholds of cultivators and their semi-pastoral allies were regular events in the early Archaic age. The word "allies" has to be qualified. Apparently as conquests were made, an integration took place by which the pastoralist and the cultivator be- came a "people" living in a particular geo- graphic area, often engaged in hostilities with people of other areas up and down the Nile Valley. Some balance would take place when cultivated land and herding land could be shared in some kind of symbiosis - always under the adjudicating surveillance of powerful leaders. These areas then became staging grounds for aggressions elsewhere, the complex causes for which probably arose from the need for land and other resources, fed by ethnocentrism and personal ambition. The pride of the cattle owner is clearly evident in the Nacrmr palette; and that very pride suggests that the early "states" of the Nile valley were dominated by pastoral ethno- centrism; the ensuing symbolism evidence of integration with the world of the cultivator. The Nacrmr palette offers convincing evidence that a hieroglyphic system of considerable sophis- tication was already in place and, along with it, a symbolic order anticipating the conventions of Old Kingdom Egypt. The white and red crown motifs which on the palette suggest east and west, and bent lotus of the queen, the use of standards, the serekh, the dress of Nacrmr, etc. - all attest to the evolution of symbolism not entirely accounted for in Predynastic Egypt. In- deed, the hieroglyphic system exhibited on the Nacrmr palette - whatever the origins of certain Predynastic symbols - must have developed in a major way by Nacrmr's time.58 Arguments per- taining to the Mesopotamian origin of some of these motifs are beyond the scope of this paper. Suffice it to note that pastoralists had wider contacts than cultivators and it is not beyond the realm of possibility that long-range and adapted interactions by an unknown number of middle groups brought certain traits of western Asia into Egypt. However, a development as advanced as that of the hieroglyphic system of the palette, on the present evidence at least, can only be conceived as the consequence of stimulus diffusion based on indigenous symbolism. But from whence came that stimulus? One good guess is that local genius, caught up in the complexities of the 55 For example, among the Nilotes and Cushites of East- ern Africa: G. P. Murdock, Africa, Its Peoples and their Cultural History (1959), 314ff. Note most of these people also practice, or have practiced, some cultivation. There is, and has been, an enormous variety of economic emphases among these people, ranging from "strict" nomadic pastoral- ism to trans -humanance; from seasonal agriculture and herd- ing to, eventually, cultivation alone. In almost all cases, however, cattle have had an important place not simply as food animals, but as a symbol of prestige and property. 56 See K. W. Butzer, Early Hydraulic Civilization in Egypt (Chicago, 1976), 26ff. 57 For a particularly lucid account of both the causes of conflict and the important role of leaders in these affairs, see F. Barth, Nomads of South Persia (Boston, 1961), 78ff. 58 Note recent studies of the origin of hieroglyphics: i.e., M. S. Arnett, The Predynastic Origin of Egyptian Hiero- glyphics (University Press of America, 1982). Note in particu- lar his views as to the Nacrmr palette, 29-41; W. A. Fairservis, Hierakonpolis - The Graffiti and The Origins of Egyptian Hieraglyphic Writing, The Hierakonpolis Project (Vassar, 1983).</page><page sequence="20">20 JARCE XXVIII (1991) integration process between cultivator and pas- toralist, invented the hieroglyphic system- what- ever the origin of the symbols - out of a need to record graphically the individuals and events of the time, along with an accounting of the com- modities involved. The evidence seems to indicate that the Nacrmr palette is not documentation of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, but instead repre- sents a victory by the leader of the Edfu district over the Nile Valley south into Nubia. The recent work of Bruce Williams on the archaeo- logical material in Northern Nubia substantiates the wealth of the region in the Archaic and Predynastic periods; and so it is logical to as- sume that ambition to seize that region may well have motivated Archaic Period leaders such as Nacrmr.59 The evidence for a northern con- quest, at least as far as one can read what is on the palette, rests almost solely on whether or not by Nacrmr's day, the red crown symbolized Lower Egypt and whether or not the papyrus symbols represent the Delta. The first question, I believe, is answered by a review of the sign itself (see signs 34-37); the second, by the translations given those motifs. I find it difficult to imagine a major unification of Egypt under Nacrmr (if he was Menes), given the great interest in Nubia and the local region. The fact that he is represented at Abydos and possibly at Turah argues against permanent con- quest and unification under Nacrmr.60 Further, it was characteristic of powerful chieftains of the time to engage in far-flung efforts to obtain commodities for themselves, whether they were considered essential or luxurious, and these for- ays need not be construed as conquests, per se.61 In sum, I interpret the Nacrmr palette, based on the evidence I have adduced here, as a memo- rial to Tbwty Dnh, an officer in Nacrmr's military forces who participated in the conquest of both banks of the Nile Valley south of Edfu (or Nek- hen) and into Northern Nubia. Furthermore, the palette is a testament to the level of sophisti- cation of both the Archaic iconography and hieroglyphic writing in general, the origins of which merit more study than has yet been ac- corded them. The study of the palette to date has been, I feel, too cursory. The methodological use of hindsight from later Pharaonic Egyptian iconography by itself, has led to serious errors of fact. I hope this new interpretation will lead to more detailed observation of the palette which, in turn, will lead to new and more focussed insights and ultimately to a more correct evalua- tion of Nacrmr's place in the development of the Archaic period.

It should be noted that the Nubian origin of leaders like Nacrmr is entirely possible. Indeed, there is no reason why critical motifs in the Nacrmr palette's iconography could not have been Nubian in origin. 60 Note the important article by Kemp on Abydos as the actual burial place of First Dynasty Monarchs' remains. This fits with the idea that Nacrmr was lacking in representa- tion at Saqqara and thus was not involved in the conquest of the Delta. B.
