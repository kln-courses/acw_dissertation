<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GROWTH OF FAMILY TREES: UNDERSTANDING HUAORANI PERCEPTIONS OF THE FOREST LAURA RIVAL London School of Economics &amp; Political Science This article discusses how a group of Amazonian people, the Huaorani, relate their perceptions of vegetal growth to their understanding of social relations. They recognize two different processes of growth and maturation. These are used to classify plant species and categorize social principles, as well as to understand why their society goes through cycles of peace and expansion followed by times of warfare anid demographlic collapse. The article establishes ethnographically that social properties are derived from, and are directly shaped by, the experience of life processes. It thus challeniges the dualistic view of the relationship between nature and society which takes 'nature' as a source of symbolic representations for describing social life. A growing body of work shows that people's interactions with their natural environment form the bases of their social practices and understandings of the social. Recent studies by Bird-David (1992a;b), Bloch (1992 a;b), Descola (1992), and Ingold (1993a; 1993b) are distinct but by no means incompatible theoretical efforts to account for animistic beliefs and to imagine social relations with refer- ence to the experience of biological processes. There are marked differences between these authors (who, Bloch excepted, focus on the relationship between people and animals), but sufficient similarities to make a comparison fruitful. Descola, for example, shares with Bird-David an interest in symbols and repre- sentations, but, as he tries to develop a structuralist model of (unconscious) cultural invariants, his approach is not too remote from Bloch's who, as a pioneer in cognitive anthropology, is looking for non-linguistic mental models. Bloch and Ingold share a strong materialist bias against symbolic interpretations which divorce perception from action and ignore non-mediated forms of knowledge. Finally, both Bird-David and Ingold, while disagreeing over what is the best theoretical model to explain the particular sociality of egalitarian societies, con- nect this sociality to the perception of natural surroundings as a 'giving environment'.1 In other words, despite their theoretical differences, these four authors stress that many hunter-gatherer and horticulturist societies view natural objects and human beings as forming a single social field, and that the corre- spondence between certain properties of social life and the experience of organic life should formn a crucial part of anthropological analysis. I take their consensus as an important point of departure from which to chal- lenge reductionist or dualistic views of the relationship between nature and society and to re-conceptualize nature, so that natural categories are no longer Mani (N.S.) 28, 635-652</page><page sequence="2">636 LAURA RIVAL seen solely as metaphors for social categories (Hastrup 1989; Richards 1992). When the relationship of people to nature is re-considered in terms of engage- ment, practical experience and perceptual knowledge, nature ceases to be a mere reflection of society. The basis on which totemism is thought of as a metaphorical representation and a conceptual objectification of nature might thus be ques- tioned. Since the master work of Levi-Strauss, the identification of people with plants and animals has commonly been understood as a symbolic manifestation of a classificatory mode of thought originating in the 'cognitive need for under- standing' (Levi-Strauss 1962; Morris 1987: 270-91). For Levi-Strauss, there is no doubt that people's interest in plant and animal species (and its ritualized, totemic expression) stems primarily from an intellectual concern with difference and anal- ogy, that is, with the codification of discontinuities. Therefore, people's concrete knowledge of the world they live in is meaningless, unless transposed to an abstract level where it can be used to classify and order the social. In other words, the practical experience of, or communication with, animals and plants is irrele- vant for the analysis of totemic beliefs, for these should be seen as a linguistic code to think the world of nature only in sofar as it can be contrasted with the cultural world of humani beings. This is the ontological dualism (humanity v. animality; culture v. nature; or intellectuality v. affectivity) that Ingold has unremittingly opposed in order to look at the concrete and personal interactions through which humans and non-human life forms constitute one single social world. For Ingold (1991; 1992), animals may be 'good to think', but they are, above all, 'good to relate to', so we should focus on perceptual rather than representational knowledge. Bloch's recent re-analysis of Zafimaniry society (1992b), although using a completely different model from Ingold's, is also an attempt to conceptualize social relations on the basis of material processes and everyday practices. Bloch's 'central mental models' result in a form of non-representational cultural knowl- edge akin to Ingold's practical knowledge based on perception and engagement. Blocli suggests tlhat natural objects do not function as metaphors for social pro- cesses, 'because social relations are experienced as natural' (1992b: 130-2). He identifies the process of growth and maturation, a process that equally affects all living beings, as a particularly forceful illustration of how people derive a practical knowledge of the social from their concrete experience of the world around them. Following Bloch, I will try to show that the Huaorani's conceptualization of their society is informed by their perceptions of differential growth processes in their forest environment, as well as by certain important symbiotic relations existing between plants, animals and people. I briefly consider the Huaorani's material experience of the forest as a 'giving environment', before examining how the specific qualities of two important tree species, Bactris gasipaes (com- monly known- as peach palm), and Ochroma lagopus (balsa) express the cyclical nature of Huaorani society and give meaning to the cycles of destruction and growth through which it is reproduced. The Huaorani view ofgrowth For the Huaorani of Ecuador, growth and maturation is a matter of on-going interest. More like hunter-gatherers2 than horticulturists, they spend much time</page><page sequence="3">LAURA RIVAL 637 'cruising' in the forest, exploring it slowly, collecting what they need for the day, and monitoring its potential resources for later use. Their constant checking of the maturity of fruit trees, and of the number of pregnant monkeys or bird nests, is commented upon at length on return to the longhouse. This interest in plant growth and maturation is more than mere pragmatic resource management: they have a genuine aesthetic delight in observing plant life, particularly the growth of new leaves, and explicitly relate this to certain aspects of human physical growth. Notions of growth and maturation are also applied to the population as a whole. Population growth and the rise and fall of local groups are matters of great concern, and group social dynamics are conceptualized in relation to forest groves, rather than with reference to the life span of individual trees. As we shall see, both social groups and forest groves exhibit two contrastive patterns of growth and regeneration. The Huaorani3 number about 1200 and live between the Napo and Curaray rivers in the Ecuadorian Amazon region. Fierce isolationists, they have, until recently, avoided all peaceful and continuous contact with the outside.4 Their homeland is characteristic of much of the western Amazonian rain forest, except that, given the relatively high rainfall averages (around 3000 mm per annum), seasons are almost non-existent. As with many Amazonian societies, kinship ter- minology is Dravidian, and the preferred marriage is between bilateral cross-cousins. Traditional longhouses - of approximately 10 to 35 members - are typically composed of an older polygynous couple, their married daughters and unmarried children. These residential units, although autonomous and dispersed over a relatively vast area, maintain close relations with two or three others, with which they form strong alliances. Each of these regional groups, huaomoni (the 'we-people'), strives to preserve an optimum degree of endogamy and autarchic stability through sustained and controlled hostility towards all the others, called huarani (literally, the 'others', that is, the 'enemies'). Society is at peace when huaomoni groups are united around inter-married pairs of brothers and sisters (a special case of cross-cousin marriage), and when endogamous marriages are se- cured. But when shortage of spouses, internal divisions and disagreements over marriage alliances force huaomoni groups into political re-alignments with huarani, violence and destruction not only brings population numbers to alarmingly low levels, but may lead to the disappearance of entire groups. Before examining these social features in more detail, it is necessary to set out Huaorani views on growth processes. These are primarily based on people's experience of how different tree species grow, mature and reproduce. Although people's understanding of the rainforest ecology seems limitless, special attention is given to a few features, all associated with growth and age. These features are the distinctive characteristics of three different kinds of trees, the tallest canopy trees (such as Ceiba pentranda or Cedrela odorata), the soft wooded trees (such as Ochroma lagopus or Cecropia spp), and certain palms of the Arecaceae family (Bactris gasipaes). The most respected and talked about are undoubtedly the large emergent canopy trees (iiene ahue). The fascination which these trees exert is due to the fact that they mature very slowly, but eventually grow to be the tallest trees of the forest. However, their growth depends on specific conditions, and they may</page><page sequence="4">638 LAURA RIVAL remain young, immature trees (huinehue) for many years. People often point to these young trees by the trailside, stressing the fact that their juvenile form is strikingly dissimilar to their adult one. Another characteristic of these and other young trees to which people are very sensitive is their new leaves. These look smooth and shiny and their distinctive and delicate colours - slightly pink, purple or red, or when green, of a very pale, almost yellow shade - are contrasted with the deep, uniform green of fully grown leaves. Although never made explicit, what seems to be most significant about the large emergent canopy trees is that they reach maturity, and start flowering, between 40 and 60 years old, and they can live for up to 200 years. That is, they reproduce at the oldest age people can live to, and their life span roughly corresponds to five human generations. In addition to their longevity, these trees are also admired for their solitary character (they do not grow in groves, but are sparsely dispersed throughout the forest), as well as for their profuse entanglement. They are hosts to many plant and animal species, and a mass of lianas and climbers assists their growth, while helping them stand upright in the wind. The two other important types of tree are two middle-canopy species, Bactris gasipaes (peach palm) and Ochroma lagoptis (balsa). These two species are well known by forest botanists as pioneer species, i.e., first colonizers in natural forest gaps and clearings. They both flower and fruit at about 20 metres above the forest floor, and attract large concentrations of animals. 0. lagopus is the first tree species to grow in forest openings, but it matures fast and dies out in one generation, while B. gasipaes grows slowly in the shade of soft and fast-growing trees, and reproduces in the same groves for many generations. Ochroma lagopus5 grows so fast that it reaches 12 metres in less than three years (Richards 1964: 383). The soft texture and low density of its timber are conse- quences of its rapid growth. The Huaorani say that balsa trees need much sun, and die in the shade; that they mature very fast, though their groves do not last more than a generation. They flower and fruit heavily, attracting many birds wllich disperse the inass of seeds across wide areas. Their seeds, like the seeds of other opportunistic, short-lived trees, remain viable for a few years, and are present in the soil throughout the forest in large numbers, waiting for gaps in the canopy. When large trees fall, the sudden increase in temperature and light levels causes the seeds to germinate, and the young trees grow rapidly (Collins 1990: 64-5). Compared with B. gasipaes, the use of 0. lagopus is very limited. The wood is used only to manufacture two essential objects: the fire kit and the ear orna- ments,6 both of which combine balsa and palm wood. I will show later that the complementarity of hard and soft wood in cultural objects and myths is of great symbolic significance. The third tree species of importance for the Huaorani, Bactris gasipaes, is a managed, incipiently domesticated plant.7 It is believed to be a cross between two wild species (Guilelma microcarpa and Guilelma insignis), and to have origin- ated somewhere in Ecuador or the Ucayali region (Ballick 1979: 11-28; Clement 1988). There exist numerous varieties, more or less altered genetically from their wild state, and exhibiting thornier to smoother trunks, and orange-red to yellow- green fruit. This palm reproduces by seed propagation. Each fruit contains a single relatively large and heavy seed. Its flesh, starchy, oily and with a high level</page><page sequence="5">LAURA RIVAL 639 of carotine, contains twice as much protein as bananas, and more carbohydrates and proteins than maize (Newman 1990: 136). Because of an enzyme, it cannot be eaten except when cooked, or very ripe - almost rotten. The Huaorani have not deliberately cultivated B. gasipaes, but their cooking activities have encour- aged its germination and propagation.8 The cooking process heats the seed to the temperature required for germination. Given the low level of light and tempera- ture at ground level, too few seeds could germinate without human intervention for the species to survive. The tree's sexual maturity is reached between its fifth and seventh year. An adult tree bears 13 full fruit clusters, each weighing up to 100 kgs (Duke 1977: 60; Ballick 1979). A fully grown tree is about 20 to 25 metres high and typically belongs to the middle canopy. Even in comparison to other palms, it grows slowly, and its wood is extremely hard. The most common type is called tewe in Huaorani, which literally means 'hard wood'.9 Individual growth and vital energy In this section, I want to explore a salient aspect of Huaorani cultural knowledge: their understanding of human growth. Huaorani conceptualization of human growth is informed by sensory perceptions which assimilate bodily maturation to the vital energy contained in leaves or shoots, and the process of aging to vegetal decay. The high energy of fast-growing plants is used to stimulate the physiologi- cal development of toddlers. As they grow older, children are encouraged through a non-authoritarian education to become independent and self-sufficient individuals. But upon adolescence, a ritual intervention is considered necessary to make them old enough to marry. I have already mentioned the Huaorani's admiration for new leaves. There exists a vast repertoire of songs that endlessly embroider on the colours, textures and aspects of new leaves, and on their beauty. One song, for example, says that 'trees with beautiful leaves grow well', and that 'it feels good to live where such trees are found, for their leaves, sweet enough to be eaten, never touch the forest floor'. Another talks about a person 'as handsome and weightless as a large young leaf swung by a gentle wind'. These songs illustrate the close association between 'new' and beautiful. This association is found again in a common expression used of babies, huiiienga huemongui bapa, which can be translated as 'it has beauty'. Babies and young leaves are associated not only because both are beautiful, but also because both are vigorous and full of vitality. However, the vigour of babies and young children must be protected, and their fast growth secured through a series of precautions. Food taboos, meant to accelerate the process of growth and encourage the right bodily composition, are observed by both parents from a few weeks prior to birth, until six months afterwards.10 In Huaorani thought, babies are intrinsically energetic, but their vigour depends on breast feeding, and young mothers explicitly state their need for nourishing food (such as monkey meat and palm fruit) in order to produce nutritious and abundant milk. The greatest bodily change and physical development is that from toddler, teque inFaringa ('in the process of ageing'), to that of 'young person', piquena bate opate gocamba (literally, 'to start being old enough to go on one's own'), a status which lasts until the ear-piercing and wedding ceremonies described below. In other words, walking, talking and eating meat are seen as three simultaneous</page><page sequence="6">640 LAURA RIVAL acquisitions which mark the beginning of personal autonomy, and which can be stimulated by the application of fast-growing plants."1 Once the fragility of the new human life is overcome, parents are mainly concerned with accelerating the process of growth in their children. It is to this effect that the legs and arms of toddlers, who are gradually expected to walk and participate in subsistence acti- vities, are gently beaten with nettles and the shoots of certain trees. Only when they can walk on their own do toddlers start wearing the distinctive cotton string around the waist. Huaorani children are, by any standard, very independent and self-sufficient, and relations between adults and children are totally devoid of authority. Adults do not have a sense of hierarchical superiority, nor are they over-protective (Rival 1992: chs 5 &amp; 6). In Huaorani terms, independence is measured by the ability to bring back food to 'give away', that is, to share with co-residents. Children's participation in subsistence activities lies largely outside adult control, as children often go to the forest in bands, with the oldest teaching and supervising the youngest. The next important maturation stage for both girls and boys is when they are ready to stop 'being on their own', that is, when they are considered mature enough to marry and have children. Two ceremonies mark this important tran- sition, the ear piercing ritual and the wedding ceremony. Sometime during adolescence, boys and girls have their ears prepared for the distinctive Huaorani ethnic marker, the 5 cm wide earplug made of balsa wood. They are suddenly assailed by several men of their house-group (usually older uncles), who pierce their ears with a long needle made of B. gasipaes wood hardened by fire. In subsequent months, increasingly bigger discs of balsa wood are inserted until the holes reach the desired size. Adolescents are expected to overcome their surprise and bear the pain in silence, while listening to the chants of their adult kinsmen and women. The chants exhort them to work hard, hunt and gather diligently, and bring home sufficient surplus to give away. They must remain healthy, be strong and eat sufficient monkey meat to enable them to walk for days without feeling tired. The surprise and the pain is intended to make the initiands feel angry (pi-),12 the typical male-adult expression of vigour and force. As the ear lobes swell and hurt, adolescents - particularly boys - must grow agitated and irritable. Peace and tranquillity are not restored until the holes are the right size, although the piercing itself is never forgotten. Ear piercing is explicitly talked about as a punishment for not obeying, though this idea of 'punishment' should not be taken literally. Rather, it is a pronounce- ment - a command - by which senior male relatives force adulthood on young Huaorani. In this ritual, structured by the violent coercion of maturing young persons (Bloch 1992a), growth takes on a more symbolic meaning. The fact that the needle used to perforate earlobes (the site of obedience, i.e. of acceptance and conformiity) is made of hard, slowly grown wood, is as significant as the fact that the holes, once enlarged, are filled with soft, light, beautiful balsa discs painted with white clay.'3 As a fast grower, balsa wood represents the vitality of plants that need bright light and heat, offer shade to palm seedlings, but die after one generation. Balsa earplugs thus signify cultural continuity (they are an essential ethnic marker), and, as part of a pre-marital rite, symbolize social continuity. Looked at from this perspective, the ear piercing ritual completes the growth</page><page sequence="7">LAURA RIVAL 641 process and maturation of the youth by combining the complementary effects of slow reproductive growth and fast one-generational growth. Conjugal life and the birth of new children cannot occur before the young are made old enough to marry through the fusion of these two growth principles. The wedding ceremony (the pairing of 'matured' huaomoni boys and girls) is the logical outcome of the ear piercing ceremony and also takes the form of an unexpected 'attack'. Marriages are celebrated during drinking ceremonies, when the whole huaomoni group is gathered. The oldest members of the regional group (who are the real or classificatory grandparents of the spouses-to-be) seize the girl and boy they want to match, and force them into a hammock where their feet are bound together and where they are made to share a large bowl of ceremonial drink as all their married kin crowd around them to sing the wedding chants. The last maturation stage, ageing, is like the first one, in the sense that it is an individual process. The skin of old people, like old leaves, loses its smoothness and shine. A number of songs and metaphoric expressions about old people refer to decaying leaves, though the imagery is less elaborated than for young leaves, and no direct parallel is drawn between old people dying and leaves decaying. As soon as they have one or two married children, people start preparing for death by inserting B. gasipaes wood splinters on both sides of their noses. The wood protects them during the voyage across the Napo River (symbolically represented as a giant boa) to reach the land of the dead. Without these splinters, the body would stay behind and rot. Apart from this one reference to individual death and afterlife, there is very little cultural elaboration on decay and ageing. However, it is worth noting that by the time their children reach the age of two or three, mothers are said to have aged. Mothering is thus talked about as a withering process, and women - espe- cially their breasts - are said to 'droop' like leaves when they become old. Old age seems to be a taboo subject. People are considered too old to go on living when their grandchildren are married and are about to become parents them- selves. In the past, old people, especially widowers, were abandoned and left to die. Today, in sedentarized villages, old widowers live by themselves and are clearly neglected. Slow growth, continuity and symbiotic relations I have suggested that the physiological development of persons results from the same vital energy as that found in leaves, shoots and fast-growing plants, but that the social maturation of adolescents requires the application of a different sort of growth - 'slow growth'. Before elaborating on the link between the regeneration of B. gasipaes palm groves and the social dynamics of huaomoni groups, I outline the relationship between slow growth, B. gasipaes hard wood and generational continuity. The location of all the Bactris gasipaes groves in the forest is known, for each is associated with specific huaomoni groups. These groves are explicitly seen as re- sulting from the activities of the group's forebears: monito memeiri qui inani (they belong to our grandparents). Like many Amazonian groups, sedentary Huaorani plant B. gasipaes trees in their gardens and around their houses, though they apparently did not do so in the past. It is noteworthy that when families disagree</page><page sequence="8">642 LAURA RIVAL with their village leaders, and move out to join relatives in other settlements (a rare and dangerous undertaking), they carefully destroy all their B. gasipaes trees, but do not go to such lengths for their banana and manioc plantations. Moreover, people differentiate the B. gasipaes trees they have planted themselves from the traditional groves which they continue to visit every year, and which mark the settlements of previous generations. Such visits continue not only because the fruit of Bactris gasipaes is an important food, but also because it provides a crucial link between past and present generations of 'we-people'. It is this link which makes the forest a 'giving environment', since living people, receiving nourish- ment from the past (palm fruit are seen to result from the activities and lives of past generations) ensure the feeding of future generations through their present consumption activities. People talk about the B. gasipaes groves with great excitement and pleasure, for they are a source of pride, security and rejoicing, the concrete and material sign of continuity. They last longer than human lives. When passing through them, people recall the deceased, usually a grandparent or great-grandparent of the oldest members of the house-groups who come to collect the fruit. As these groves often spring from seeds deposited around long-abandoned hearths, do- mestic debris (bits of broken clay pots or stone axes) still lies barely buried, a further confirmation that 'the grandparents' lived there. Although long estab- lished groves could well be self-perpetuating,14 the scattered seeds from human intervention clearly contribute to their reproduction. The Huaorani calendar is further evidence of the cultural importance of B. gasipaes, and of how the link established between different generations of 'we- people' - materialized by B. gasipaes groves - also plays an essential role in monkey reproduction. The year is divided into three seasons. These do not reflect the changing position of the stars as in many Amazonian cultures, but a series of maturation processes linked with Bactris gasipaes fruiting cycles.15 The first season, the 'peach palm fruit season', runs from January to April. It is fol- lowed by the 'season of fat monkeys', which ends in August. People, like monkeys, also fatten with this seasonal diet, and laugh at the idea that their bodies grow softer and bigger. Monkey meat becomes more palatable, with a yellowish colour and a milder taste. It is said that it almost melts in the mouth, and is so delicious to eat 'because the females are now pregnant'. Then comes the 'season of wild cotton', when kapok, an essential part of the hunting gear,16 becomes available in large quantities. The months of February to April are usually the months of greatest mobility, as huaomoni house-groups converge on the sites where fruits are ripening. Their main concern during these months is to balance their desire for grand drinking ceremonies17 with the need to leave enough palm fruit for the monkeys to feed on, fatten and reproduce. It is during the peach palm fruit season that the link between past and present generations is most clearly experienced, as past people provide in abundance for their descendants. Monkeys and other animals feeding on peach palm fruit are said to 'steal' food that legitimately belongs to humans, but, since it allows them to fatten and reproduce, they should be permitted to partake in the grandparental bounty. Monkeys have limited territories and their families reproduce in parallel</page><page sequence="9">LAURA RIVAL 643 to the human ones, albeit at a greater speed. If people were to treat them badly, by not leaving them enough fruit to eat, for example, monkeys could steal the seeds and this time, the theft would be final. The symbiotic relationship uniting people, animals and palm trees is thus perceived as necessary for securing renewal and growth. Hunting practices provide further evidence of the symbiotic relationship be- tween people and monkeys. Before the introduction of shotguns in the mid-1970s, only two types of hunting were practised: the blow-gunning of canopy species (monkeys and certain species of birds) and the killing of collared peccaries (wild boars) with long wooden spears.18 It is significant that although both weapons are made of the same material - B. gasipaes wood hardened with fire - the practice of blowgun hunting, as well as its signification, stand in syste- matic opposition to spear hunting. Huaorani notions of killing and hunting are clearly separated. People do not 'kill' canopy animals, but hunt them, in contrast to prey animals like jaguars or harpy eagles which do not hunt, but kill. Hunting, oJinga eenqui pi, means 're- trieving' (literally, 'to carry dead flesh back home'), and to go hunting, oonte go, to go blowing. Game is relatively plentiful in the Huaorani homeland; birds and monkeys are found throughout the forest, their territories are limited, and their behaviour, largely determined by their feeding habits, predictable. Blowgun hunting, a rather solitary operation often involving tree climbing, is practised by men and sometimes women as part of their frequent trips to the forest, and produces the most regular supply of meat. When talking about monkey hunting, people say that the momentum of unpoisoned darts is insufficient to be fatal; curare is what kills monkeys. It is as though they sought to reduce the causal link between hunting (the action of blowing) and killing (the monkey's death). Fur- thermore, babies of hunted female monkeys are neither killed nor eaten, but kept as 'pets' and breast-fed. In fact, Huaorani longhouses, filled (through blowgunning and gathering acti- vities) with adopted animals and collections of forest products, can be seen as prolongations of the symbiotic relationship epitomized by the peach palm groves which develop on old dwelling sites. Longhouses offer clear evidence that spatial oppositions are drawn neither between domesticated and wild spaces, nor be- tween forest animals and longhouse residents. Pets are not domesticated, but adopted, and, as such, treated like longhouse dependent members. For example, birds and mnonkeys are fed with bananas and other fruit, and harpy eagles with hunted monkeys; when they die, they receive a proper burial. The fact that older men and women become shamans by adopting 'jaguar sons' provides a further illustration of the widespread phenomenon of adoption, albeit symbolic in this latter case. As already mentioned, spear hunting, a sporadic, collective, noisy and bloody affair, is opposed to blowgun hunting. In fact, hunting with spears is called 'killing' (tapaca huenonani). Although there is no space here to elaborate on the assimilation of spear hunting to warfare (see Rival 1992: ch. 2), it is important to point out that spears are made of B. gasipaes wood. From a myth accounting for the twin origin of very hard wood and deadly spears, we learn that, before they were made aware of the existence of B. gasipaes palms by the son of the sun, the</page><page sequence="10">644 LAURA RIVAL Huaorani used balsa wood to make their spears, but these were too blunt and soft to kill. Consequently defenceless, the Huaorani were leading a miserable exist- ence at the mercy of powerful 'cannibals' and enemies. This myth clearly presents B. gasipaes spears as essential for the maintenance of a separate ethnic identity and the continuity of huaomoni groups. Manihot esculenta: thefragility offast growth and social expansion I suggested at the beginning of this article that the Huaorani have a hunting- gathering perspective on the forest which they experience as a 'giving environment'. My concern in this section is to show that the continuity of B. gasipaes groves, and the symbiotic relations on which it is based, can best explain their confidence in the forest and their disengagement from continuous garde- ning.19 Although not primarily horticulturists, they do grow Manihot esculenta (sweet manioc), and it is to the specific meanings of this gardening activity that I wish to turn now. I will first detail the particularities of Huaorani resource management, then outline their gardening practices, and finally analyse ritual drinking parties in terms of growth symbolism. It is my contention that resource management, gardening and ceremonial drinking are all organized according to the same cultural logic contrasting slow and fast growth. More explicitly, sweet manioc is identified with 0. lagopus, for both are characterized by fast, non-re- productive growth. This identification elucidates the Huaorani's reluctance to garden (unusual in Amazonia), as well as their association of horticulture with warfare. We already know that Huaorani people spend a great part of their time cruis- ing through the forest, sometimes collecting food within a radius of 5 km - or less - from the longhouse, sometimes going as far as 20 km away. Forest trips are considered successful and productive as long as the necessary jungle products are brought back. A trip in the forest often means spending more time in the trees than on the ground. A wide range of fruit species are collected, as well as germi- nated seeds, a relished food, dug from beneath certain trees. Many semi-cultivated species are 'grown in the wild' so as to always be at hand during expeditions: for example, fish-poison vines along creeks, fruit trees along certain hunting trails and banana and plantain trees in natural clearings used as hunting bases. In relation to horticulturist standards, Huaorani gardening requires a minimum input of human labour, very little technological elaboration and no magical knowledge. Despite the fact that gardening techniques are very basic, with no burning and a minimum number of trees felled, gardening, 'doing something tiresome in the bush', is said to require a lot of work, and as much effort and pain as transporting heavy loads. Before the increasing availability of metal tools from the 1930s on, forest patches were cleared with stone axes and gardens cultivated and weeded with bamboo machetes. Longhouses were built on hilltops, where natural gaps in the forest are more frequent and gardens easier to clear. Gardens are essentially manioc groves and this is exactly what their name, quehuencori, means in Huaorani. Varieties of manioc are primarily differentiated according to the relative sweetness of the roots and rates of growth, and most of the ones Huaorani cultivate produce edible roots in 4-6 months. Although</page><page sequence="11">LAURA RIVAL 645 people know of wild varieties of manioc, and claim that their forebears trans- planted them to gardens when they had no access to domesticated varieties, it is clear that they have also known sweet manioc for a very long time.20 Neverthe- less, a number of factors suggest that Huaorani horticulture is incipient and undeveloped. Firstly, they know only sweet manioc varieties, apparently the sweetest and juiciest Amazonian varieties. The roots are so sweet that people eat them raw in the garden. Secondly, they do not have the elaborate preparations known among expert horticulturists such as the Shuar and the Quichua, or among those who, like the Tukanos, grow bitter manioc. Even today, manioc is often simply boiled and crushed in water, like boiled bananas - the Huaorani's staple drink. Even when the mash is mixed with saliva, the brew is not allowed to ferment into a true alcoholic drink. Thirdly, gardens have always been com- paratively small (15 m x 18 m) and hardly suffice for the daily consumption of sedentary households today. Even in villages with schools where manioc is most needed, only about one third of the conjugal families cultivate gardens and feed those who do not, according to the typical guest-host demand-sharing relation- ship (Rival 1992: 172-89). All these indications confirm that the Huaroni's use of cultivated manioc is sporadic and is aimed at providing feast, rather than subsistence food. Huaorani can go for months without manioc, and when they do decide to cultivate it, it is with the explicit objective of organizing a large drinking ceremony in which, in contrast to peach palm drinking parties to which only 'we-people' are invited, distant relatives and allies participate. As a feast food artificially re-creating the seasonal abundance of palm fruit - the gift from previous generations - manioc can be used to challenge the segmentation of Huaorani society into bounded huaomoni groups. Before elaborating this point, it is necessary to consider briefly the relationship between manioc gardening and vegetal growth more generally. The manioc plant is called 'the thing that lives, that is life' and the root 'edible thing'. There is some evidence to suggest that manioc is understood as having propagation habits similar to Ochrorna lagopus. Manioc, like balsa, takes advantage of the full light in canopy gaps to grow and mature fast. People favour the wide dispersion of manioc, rather than its reproduction in situ, just as the feeding habits of birds result in the wide dispersal of balsa seeds. This conceptualization of propagation explains well why people hardly weed their gardens and never use a plot more than once - except today in sedentarized villages. Weeding, and using the same garden for a number of years, imply a system of agricultural production which is foreign to the Huaorani preference for extractive activities. Another practice illustrates the association between manioc and balsa. When bundles of stalks are ready to be planted, they are beaten with large balsa leaves, a process aimed at vitalizing the stalks by transferring to them the balsa's fast-growth energy, just as we saw earlier it was transferred to young children. Clearly then, manioc belongs to the category of fast-growing, short-lived species. The fact that manioc is preferably planted in the natural gaps left by the fall of old emergent trees pro- vides further evidence of the close association between manioc and balsa, for both need the sudden influx of light and new space in order to develop. By the</page><page sequence="12">646 LAURA RIVAL same token, Manihot esculenta is contrasted with Bactris gasipaes which can only grow in the shade. Let us now turn to the ritual preparation of manioc roots and to the symbolism of drinking ceremonies. Much of what is said here also applies to drinking parties in which palm fruit or banana drinks are prepared, with the difference that manioc drinking parties are more formal and more ritualized. The greater the number of guests, the larger the plantation, and the longer the roots are left to grow. The reason for this is quite obvious and pragmatic, but the social and cultural implications of this increase in scale are worth emphasizing. As shown below, sweet manioc, in addition to allowing for greater social integration, gratifies a cultural passion for abundance and plenitude. The decision to hold a manioc drinking ceremony is usually left to a married couple who become the 'owners of th-e feast' and lead the collective labour entailed in its preparation. The harvested inanioc is stored in a feast house built by the couple's house-group. The unpeeled roots are gently barbecued over embers, and, once the skin has been removed, are buried in pits for about ten days, during which the 'owners' must follow a special diet and observe a series of restrictions. They must not leave the feast house, which no one else can enter. They must rest and eat only boiled manioc. Sexual intercourse is expressly forbidden. After ten days, when the ma- nioc smell 'strong and sweet', the pulp is scooped, mashed, chewed and stored in large containers. Th-e transformation undergone by feast manioc is quite explicitly described as a change from root to fruit. People say that when it is extracted from the pit, manioc is 'as sweet as a fruit'. This is important, given that all other drinking parties make use of fruit. The fact that the couple which organizes the drinking ceremony is sometimes called ahuene, an expression which literally means 'of the tree', lends further support to the idea that this lengthy transformation turns manioc roots into fruit. This term, normally used to refer to the big solitary trees that are so admired, also means 'great person', 'leader', or 'chief, and is some- times used to refer to the heads of house-groups or huaomoni groups. The close association between trees, fruit and feasting is further evidenced by the fact that the guests at a drinking ceremony compare themselves to birds gathered on a big tree during the fruit season. They sing all night long that: We human-s are like birds, like them we enjoy feasting to the last drop, and then we leave. Each goes oni carrying out their own business. In this way lived our grandfathers, and so do we. For my purpose here it is important to emphasize the concrete experiences and practices of daily life, rather than the ritual knowledge associated with drinking. For this reason, I focus on people's excitement and pleasure at over-consuming fruit drinks 'like birds on a fruiting tree', rather than elaborate the undeniably rich symbolism and imagery of the birds and fruit themselves. Whatever the meaning of the metaphors they use, and whatever the deeper symbolic interpretation one might offer for such ritual experience, drinking ceremonies are first and foremost the way people partake in the fruiting season. Above all, a feast is about presen- ting abundance as natural and feast-goers as pure consumers, very much like birds gorging on fruit in season.</page><page sequence="13">LAURA RIVAL 647 Botanists say that two-thirds of the world's flowering plants are found only in the tropics, and out of the extraordinary diversity of the rain forest has developed the complex web of relationships between bird pollinators and flowering plants.21 Most plants also use birds, bats and monkeys as seed dispersers (Collins 1990: 70-2). Huaorani people, with their sophisticated knowledge of their forest envi- ronment, and particularly of animal feeding habits, not only understand that plant reproduction is absolutely dependent on animals, but also that pollinators and seed dispersers 'do their job' by gorging themselves and then dispersing in all directions. Therefore, whatever else they do when they feast, they play the part of bird pollinators reproducing the ahuene by consuming fruit drinks bowl after bowl. If one accepts that ahuene is not only a person or a couple, but a name for the huaomoni group as a whole, it is easier to grasp the full significance of the transformation of manioc roots into fruit, and to measure the contrasting social outcomes of palm fruit and manioc drinking ceremonies. While B. gasipaes groves are about the social continuity of endogamous nexi centred around pairs of inter-married brothers and sisters, manioc groves are about social expansion and new marriage alliances beyond the huaomoni limits. Gardens are synonymous with increased sociality, growing children and multi- plying households. They are associated with times of stability, peace and plenty, when 'enemy' house-groups meet for feasts and marriages, and when there is neither feuding, flight nor death. The term for happiness is 'another serving of manioc drink we laugh happily'. This indicates that manioc is the special basis for rejoicing with potential affines. Such alliances are perilous and need the strict control and guidance of strong leaders. A good illustration of the political nature and dangerous character of manioc drinking ceremonies is the fact that male guests who come to feast with the 'enemy' must jab four or five palm wood spears bearing their personal designs in a banana trunk before entering the feast house. Such alliances cannot be reproduced as easily as those between pairs of brothers and sisters who marry their children together. When commenting on the difficulty of marrying outside the huaomoni group, people occasionally refer to the fact that manioc gardens do not last. As a corollary, they imply that endogamous marriages, like peach palm groves, do last. Manioc gardens last only for the duration of a drinking ceremony, new clear- ings must be prepared and stalks continuously replanted. As the clearings are small, often barely larger than natural gaps in the forest, and as they are aban- doned immediately following the harvest, old gardens are quickly invaded by Ochroma lagopus and other pioneer trees. In less than three years, the metaphorical association between the owners of the feast and a large fruiting tree, between the feast participants and birds, and between the garden produce and fruit, are made physically real by the growth of secondary forest. In one sense, manioc groves facilitate the growth of balsa wood and of the pioneer trees they are designed to imitate. Peach palm groves, on the other hand, continue to yield fruit, feed the descendants of those by whom they exist, and reproduce the families of monkeys. Gardens also attract animals, especially tapirs, deer and large rodents, but these are not traditionally eaten. Therefore, unlike peach palm groves, manioc gardens do not create a symbiotic relationship between people, animals and plants. More- over, trust in ahuene leaders can be short-lived, and violence can strike them just</page><page sequence="14">648 LAURA RIVAL as thunder strikes the large emergent trees (iiene ahue) that destroy neighbouring trees in their fall and leave large gaps in the forest canopy. This is why the Huaorani say that times of peace and growth are always followed by times of destruction and near-extinction. The ahuene give generously, but their proffered abundance is not as reliable or as secure as the grandparents' seasonal yields of palm fruit. Conclusion In this article I have tried to show that growth is central to Huaorani thought. Like all Amazonian Indians, the Huaorani live in autonomous local groups, hunt, fish, gather and garden. But to say this is to say very little, for there are many ways in which these activities can be organized and thought about. For example, many native Amazonians dichotomize the world by opposing nature to culture (see, for example, Seeger 1981). They physically and symbolically transform their environment by setting domesticated spaces - gardens and human dwellings - against wild spaces. I have already mentioned that among the Shuar (Descola 1986) and the Quichua (Whitten 1985), two Indian groups whose agricultural production has supplied missionaries, traders and travellers for centuries, and who today are in close contact with the Huaorani, gardening, and more particularly manioc cultivation, is a highly sophisticated art, as well as a complex symbolic practice. The Huaorani, in contrast, are reluctant gardeners, and their manioc plantations, grown for feasting rather than daily consumption, involve very little physical or symbolic transformation of the forest. Their peach palm groves, on the other hand, result from symbiotic relations perpetuated through consump- tion, and are not planted. From a botanical point of view (Clement 1992: 70-1) sweet manioc and peach palm are domesticated species, but neither of them is traditionally cultivated by the Huaorani. Domestication implies not only control, planned intervention and transformation, which all contradict the Huaorani's ideal of natural abundance and of a 'giving environment', but it also presupposes dependence on plants whose growth is much faster relative to human growth and maturation processes. In addition to illuminating Huaorani resource management strategies, growth, which is a property of social life as much as a life process, also explains why kinship and social groups undergo short and long development cycles. While growth obviously affects all living forms alike, this does not necessarily entail that human processes be conceptualized in terms of plant categories, nor that growth be used as a metaphor to describe social processes. Through active and direct engagement in the world, the Huaorani know (i.e. perceive) that trees grow and mature at different rates, and, on this basis, draw a fundamental distinction be- tween living organisms that grow slowly and perdure as groups, and those that grow fast but die off. On the basis of this distinction, the developmental process of peach palm groves, which grow and endure on a time scale commensurate with the passage of human generations, parallels that of huaomoni groups. Em- bodiments of past human activity, these groves reproduce through the enduring relationships created by endogamy and feasting. As their growth and the growth of local groups form a continuous and interlinked process, Huaorani history and the natural history of Bactris gasipaes coalesce.</page><page sequence="15">LAURA RIVAL 649 This examination of growth in Huaorani thought and practice brings me back to my opening remarks. Given the wide range of evidence upon which I have drawn, a question might remain about the ontological status of growth: is its meaning conceptual, symbolic or metaphorical? My purpose here is not to debate the symbolic nature of social facts, or the innateness of symbols. More modestly, I simply want to emphasize that growth belongs primarily to the domain of practical knowledge, or, in Atran's words, to common sense 'which is responsible for the phenomenal givens that people ordinarily apprehend' (1990: 252). Per- ceived, experienced and conceptualized, growth is knowledge about the world. As such, it is a non-mediated perceptual knowledge which orders social relations between people, and between people and other living organisms. But growth is also symbolized and even ritualized. Once formed conceptually, it is interpreted and imagined, and then recast as, for example, the vital energy communicated sympathetically to children, or the complementarity of hard and soft wood. Evoked metaphorically during drinking ceremonies, it stands for the ripening of fruit and becomes maturation. Transformed into an abstract and vague property that can be extracted from the organic context and applied to the social order, growth becomes more evocative and symbolic than conceptual, as when, for instance, the fast-growing and highly productive manioc gardens are used to foster new political alliances and exogamous marriages. This kind of symbolism would lose all its potency, however, if some families and some trees did not grow more slowly than others. NOTES Fieldwork amon-g the Huaorani was carried out between January 1989 and June 1990 and was supported by the Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, with additional fund- ing from the Linineanl Society of London. This article is based on a paper originally presented at the an-thropology seminar at the London School of Economics in November 1992. I should like to thank the participants for their contributions and criticisms, especially H. Reid. I am very grateful to M. Bloch, G.T. Prance, T. Ingold (who suggested the title for this article), H. Moore and P. Riviere for their many helpful suggestions. I owe special thanks to Hastings Donnan and the anonymous readers for their editorial suggestions. Ultimate responsibility for the final product is, of course, mine. l This phrase gained popularity with the publication of Bird-David's article (1990) in which she argues that gathering and hunting populations 'view their environment as giving' and that 'their economic system is characterised by modes of distribution and property relations that are constructed in terms of giving, as within- the family, rather than in terms of reciprocity, as be- tween- kin' (1990: 189). 2 'Food collectors', which conveys well the undifferentiated pattern of obtaining food and ma- terials in the forest, might be a better term. The characterization of people through their subsist- en-ce activities has led to difficult terminological problems in Amazonia, although Amazonian spe- cialists usually define the people they work with as hunters and swidden horticulturists. Most of them, however, would be extremely reluctant to consider marginal Amazonian groups such as the Huaorani as 'hunter-gatherers', and would say that the literature on hunting-and-gathering societies has no relevance for Amazonia (Levi-Strauss 1968; Lathrap 1973; Arcand 1981). I see their position as a reaction to the deterministic and evolutionary biases of the early South Ameri- can cultural typologies (with, for example, the concept of cultural devolution), and of some hunter-gatherer studies. However, such a position implies too great a cultural uniformity and does not allow for an adequate understanding of cultural variations between great gardeners such as the Shuar, Canelos Quichuas, Napo Quichuas and Tukanos on the one hand, and much more mobile food collectors such as the Huaorani, Cuiva, Siriono or Maku on the other.</page><page sequence="16">650 LAURA RIVAL 3 Adjectival form derived from the substantive huao (person, human being) and -rani (plural marker). 4 One, possibly two, sub-groups are still protecting their complete isolation by hiding, con- tinuously moving and killing those who try to force contact upon them. Known as 'Aucas', a Quichua word meaning 'savages', they speak a language related to Ssabela, a single and unclass- ified language which has wrongly been taken for a Zaparoan dialect (Rival 1992: 50-7). In the past, they bordered the Zaparo on the south and southeast, but these were totally decimated through enslavement and disease during the rubber boom (Whitten 1978; Reeves 1988). When Zaparo survivors found refuge with montania Indians (Canelos Quichua and Shuar) at the begin- ning of the century, the Huaorani expanded within their abandoned territories. Today, they are surrounded by lowland Quichua and white settlers who have gradually moved eastward, a move- men-t which has dramatically accelerated since the oil boom in the early 1970s. i There are a number of Huaorani words to refer to different species belonging to the Och- roma and Cecropia generi. Oine is called gopocahue (the tree that comes and goes); another, mdn- imeIzue (?); hiuelme (young tender tree). 6 The Huaorani never used balsa wood to make floats. They avoided rivers, and when they had to cross one, even with heavy bundles, they preferred to bend trees on each bank and tie them together as an arch. 7 Clement argues that B. gasipaes is the only domesticated American palm. He has identified at least ten land races ('the morphologically distinct races developed by humans in different geo- graphical areas'), some of which show an increased fruit weight of close to 5000%. On the basis of the substantial modifications he has observed in certain varieties, he concludes that B. gasipaes has been- managed and cultivated for more than 12,000 years (Clement 1992: 75-6). 8 Posey (1985; 1988), who has worked extensively with the Kayapos of Central Brazil, has sinimlar ecological information to report. For him, it is clear that the Kayapos do not just adapt to their n-atural en-viron-ment, but make it; for example, they create and maintain forest patches in savainina en-viroins. On the basis of suchl findings, he suggests that human- intervention (through conlscious planiniiiig anid/or unintentional resource management) might be held responsible for the bewildering ecological diversity of the Amazon rain forest. 9 This term is a combination of tei (hard) and ahue. It is clear from the Huaorani lexicon that the term ahue (wood/tree) is polysemic, and that its core meaning is 'wood'. On the basis of ample semantic and lexical evidence, Witkowski et al. (1981) have argued that the concept of wood has developed prior to the concept of tree, and that it is only recently that 'tree' has become a category in itself Atran (1990: 278) has criticized their view, and has asserted that size (trees are taller than human adults), not woodiness, is the determinant feature of the life-form 'tree'. It seems to me that Huaorani thought privileges wood, albeit for different reasons from those put forward by Witkowski et al. First, growth is identified as a similar process in trees and human-s, which are differentiated on the basis of longevity. Second, the significant features of palm trees - their hard wood and abundant fruit - is attributed to their comparatively slow growth. 10 A man who avoids eating certain meats in connexion with a woman's pregnancy acknow- ledges his fatherhood and makes it public. Taboos on certain meat are said to protect the foetus or the infant from diarrhoea, that is, from liquefaction, therefore securing the strengthening or 'hardening' of the body. 11 See Chaumeil (1988) for an insightful discussion of shamans' anthropomorphic visualization of vital energy. Chaumeil argues that the notion of power in Amazonia is closely linked to the capacity to control energy. 12 This is a complex emotion, a mixture of rage, hatred and bravery. In men, it is a sign of moral strength and determination. 13 White clay, dai, is said to be deposited in shallow creeks by the rainbow, daime. It is an essential element. Women make clay pots with it for boiling meat - the staple food - and, in times of war, it is mixed with water and drunk as a substitute for food. The clay coating there- fore recalls domesticity (clay pots and cooking) and survival (the runaway's drink). 1 Specialists disagree on this point. Clement thinks that B. gasipaes cannot survive long after beinig abanidoned (1992: 75). 15 Descola (1986: 92) notes that the Achuar, who base their calendar on the position of stars and welcome the peach palm fruiting season as a time of abundance, do not seem to grant this</page><page sequence="17">LAURA RIVAL 651 fruit any particular symbolic importance. The Shuar, however, celebrate the return of the peach palm fruiting season every year with elaborate fertility rituals, around which their calendar is structured. 16 A fluff used as wadding and feather, kapok eases the passage of darts along the grooved stave of blowpipes. Interestingly, kapok is produced in large quantities by the largest emergent tree, Ceiba petranda. 17 For ceremonies, drinks are prepared by extracting the seeds, pounding the flesh and mixing it with water. They are not allowed to ferment into alcohol. 18 Only these three types of animals were hunted with any regularity, and older people still express a great aversion for game widely hunted by most Amazonian people, such as tapirs, agoutis or capihuaras. Although Huaorani do not seem to resent eating imported food such as rice, sugar or oats, and even drink coffee, they would never touch beef, pork or even tapir meat. 19 The contrast drawn by Ingold (1993a) and Bodenhorn (1989) between trust and confidence does not apply in this context because the Huaorani do not conceptualize natural abundance as the outcome of moral relations among people, or between people and animals. They emphasize both their skills and knowledge, and the work, skills and knowledge of past generations, rather than a moral contract between hunters and game. Moreover, their emphasis on past generations is devoid of any idea of ancestral sanction (Bird-David 1990). 20 According to Lathrap (1973), manioc was domesticated between 5000 and 7000 BC in the Amazon Basin. It is the most important food plant of the tropics. 21 The rain forests of Ecuador are particularly known for their large numbers of bird-pollinated plants (Professor Prance, Director of the Royal Botanical Gardens, personal communication).
