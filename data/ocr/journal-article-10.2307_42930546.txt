<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF KUMAON REGION, NORTH INDIA JEEWAN KHARAKWAL* The Kumaon-Garhwal Himalayas (28° 44' to 31° 25' N; 77° 45' to 81° 1' E) are endowed with famous shrines, tourist spots, mild climate, scenic beauty and a wide range of variegated flora and fauna. It is therefore that the region attracts pilgrims, tourist, trackers, mountaineers and researchers. The study area is spread over 51,125 sq.km. out of which 7,632 sq.km. is covered by snow, 48,830 sq.km. by mountains and 3800 sq. km. by the plain land known as Terai Bhawar (Fig. 1). The Lesser or Sub-Himalayan Zone is largely composed of crystalline, granites, gneisses and schist rocks. The slate rock of Almora Nappe is injected with granites and also bears lenses of quartz. This rugged but beautiful mountainous area supports temperate forests predominated by Pi nus roxburghii , Quercus incana , Quercus Himalayansis, Cedrus deodara , Rhododendron arborium and large number of fruit trees eg., Mehal (Pyrus pashia ), Makhoie (Solanum nigrum), Kaphal ( Myrca ragi), Timla ( Ficus roxburghii) Bedu ( Ficus pumifera) etc. The fauna of this region is as varied as its flora. A number of game animals dwell in these forests including leopard (Panthera pardus), barking deer ( Muntiacus muntijak), Sambhar (Cervus unicolor), deer ( Axis hodgosni), bharal (Ovis nahura) and various other mammalian species (Atkinson 1989). All the major perennial rivers of this Himalayan area such as the Alaknanda, the Tons, the Bhagirathi, the Western Ramganga, the Koshi and the Kali are flanked generally by two and rarely by three fold alluvial terrace system. These fertile terraces were the main centers of ancient habitation in these hills. Stone Age The earliest archaeological remains, belonging to the stone age were reported by Das (1961- 62:103) in the early sixties of this century. He found a few early stone age artifacts near Kalsi in Dehradun district, which were rolled. About twenty years later a team of H.N.B. Garhwal University, led by Prof. K.P. Nautiyal, reported stone age tools from Srinagar and Dang located on the terrace of Alaknanda (Nautiyal et al. 1982). This includes a variety of scrapers and a tanged fan-shaped convex edged artifacts, which look like scrapers. They opine that these tools show a near resemblance to the Late Sohan industry and to the tools from Sirsa and Sohan basin in Himanchal Pradesh, discovered earlier by Y.D. Sharma. Recently, Mathpal (1987) also reported choppers and flakes from the western Ramganga valley. Some of his illustrations look like cleavers. All these artifacts, like other places in India, have been make of quartzite. But so far no factory site or any tool assemblage in primary context has been found. * Department of Archaeology, Rajasthan Vidyapeeth, Udaipur 313 001.</page><page sequence="2">Bulletin of the Deccan College 58-59 (1998-1999) Fig. 1: Region showing distribution of archaeological sites of Kumaon</page><page sequence="3">The Archaeology of Kumaon Region, North India 163 Rock Art Paintings In the late seventies Agrawal and Joshi (1978: 75-77) discovered a painted rock shelter at Dalband near Barechhina in Almora district, for the first time in the Himalayan foothills, which eventually led the discovery of several rock art sites in Kumaon-Garhwal hills. A few years later Saklani (1983: 217) brought to light a painted rock shelter from the right bank of the Alaknanda in Chamoli Garhwal, which bears human and animal figures depicted in red pigment. Nautiyal and Khanduri (1986: 83) reported another rock shelter from Kimni village of the same district where painted motifs such as a dagger like weapon and reptiles were identified. In the following year Mathpal (1987) also located a few more painted shelter in the outskirts of Almora town. Recently three more painted shelters were added to this list (Kharakwal 1993) and hence to this date more than 41 rock shelters, 15 of which bear paintings, have been discovered. In order to find out inter-relationship, stratigraphy and chronology of these paintings an analytical study was carried out and a total of 170 figures from different shelters were copied by direct tracing technique, using transparent polythene sheets on the wall of the shelter. While tracing Munsell colour chart was used to compare tone of the colour. The paintings of these shelters are classified under following six major categories: 1) Male human figures, 2) Female figures, 3) Child, 4) Motifs, 5) Animal figures and 6) Colour patches. The stratigraphy and chronology was established on the basis of superimposition, colour used in different phases in the individual shelter and style of painting. Five different phases of paintings were identified. Generally the size of figures, often represented by stick like lines, is very small. Human figures those wearing headdress and gown like clothes and with breasts were identified as female ones whereas small ones (measuring 4 to 5 cm) were identified as children. Following is the distribution chart of the shelters. Shelters Location Site Number of Painted rock shelters 1 Likhudyar (LIKDR) 3 2 Kasardevi (KDVI) 3 3 Lakhiudyar (LKDR) 4 4 Petshal (KFKT) 2 5 Falseema 1 6 Kimni 1 7 Doongri 1 Prehistoric man generally depicted animals in a very naturalistic form in the caves and semi- open rock shelters. The paintings of Mesolithic period and the later depict hunting scenes. In Kumaoni rock art, however, we do not find a wide range of subjects. It seems that the artists were greatly interested in drawing dancing figures, running bands, geometric motifs and other decorative figures. The paintings are dominated by human figures in different styles</page><page sequence="4">164 Bulletin of the Deccan College 58-59 (1998-1999) i.e., stick-like, partially abstract, suggestive and so on. A total of 577 human figures were found in all these shelters, excluding the last two sites. In comparison to male the female figures and children are rarely depicted. As such there are no hunting scenes, but in shelter LKDR 1 at least at four places the figures may be attributed to hunting scene. On the right part of the shelter, a horse like animal shown falling down and an unidentified animal without head appears to be bewildered; a man, viewer of this scene, is perhaps excited as he is shown with raised hands. At other place two goats look frightened by the presence of men. On the left flank of the shelter some human figures are depicted running after a small unidentified animal. In KFKT 1 a goat looks frightened and a jackal like animal also gives similar impression. The appearance of these animals suggest that they were not domesticated. Some paintings may be attributed to decorative motifs eg. semi-circular, wavy zigzag set of lines in LKDR 1 , half diamond structure and zigzag lines in LKDR 2 and a similar structure in Falseema shelter. It seems that to some extent the motivation behind these paintings was to decorate the dwelling place also. The paintings are generally made in monochrome, but in LIKDR 1 four tree like figures in dark red were outlined by white, possibly at a later stage. A group of dancers at LKDR 1 is similar to that of Bhimbetka (Mathpal 1984: fig. 36) and Fatehpur Sikri (Bajpai 1975). This group at Bhimbetka represents the earliest layer of historical paintings. Like Bhimbetka, decorative motifs were found almost in all the phases in Kumaon. They are attributed to a geometric pattern. The figures have generally been depicted very small, which may be called micrographie. There is also a close similarity of Kumaoni rock art with rest of the Indian rock art. Since there are no domesticated animals, figures like horse-riders, soldiers, metal weapons or anything which suggests agricultural activity it would not be reasonable to call them paintings of historical age. Perhaps they may represent a transitional phase between Mesolithic and Chalcolithic stage. Several layers of painting suggest a long time span of occupation in these shelters. Most of the painted shelters of Kumaon are semi-open, which bear close similarity to the other Indian rock art sites. Though the contents of Kumaoni rock art are confined to human figures in dancing, running, carrying objects, hunting and decorative motifs, but they are very significant to view, at a glance, the prehistoric society in the middle Himalayan region. To represent human figures abstract, stick-like, arrow like and stylized motifs were executed. Only one figure on the shelter KFKT 1 was made by executing out line whereas the abstract and arrow like styles were employed right from first to fourth phases. The stick-like human figures were mainly executed in the second phase. Decorative motifs were found in all the five phases. The similarity of subject matter, colours and styles of younger paintings suggest continuation of an art tradition. It also creates a striking uniformity in Kumaoni rock art. A random sampling of different painting styles was done in order to identify the composition of pigments with the help of sophisticated chemical analysis for such analysis one requires a microgram or nanogram quantity, which can be collected without destroying the paintings. Thus, in the black pigment used at Lakhiudyar (LKDR-I) we found 5.73 ppm iron and 12.1 ppm cobalt. In the same rock shelter the red pigment gave 320 iron and 13.4 ppm cobalt. This indicates that the source of ochre must have been different for these samples.</page><page sequence="5">The Archaeology of Kumaon Region , North India 165 Cup-Marks Besides paintings a variety of cup marks, deep vertical, conical and pear-shaped pits and engravings have also been found in these hills. They have been excavated either on rock exposures on gentle mountain slopes or in rock shelters of micaceous slate, quartzite, sandstone and granite. W.J. Henwood was the pioneer to locate a few cup-marks at Devidhura in Pithoragarh district as early as 1856. H.R. Carnac noticed similar evidence in 1872 at Chandeswar near Dwarahat. In last two decades over two dozen such sites have been found in this region (Joshi 1986-87; Mathpal 1992; Kharakwal 1993). A total of 850 engravings including cup marks and petroglyphs were found at these sites, out of which 437 are small cupules, 176 cup like marks, 208 medium sized conical pits, 9 large pits and 20 engravings of different objects, bull, squarish object, foot prints, etc. (Kharakwal 1993). The nuclear zone of these pits appears to be the catchment area of the Gagas and Suyal rivers in Almora district. For a long time, the existence of cup like marks and other petroglyphs has remained an enigma; even today their antiquity is questionable. Most of the petroglyphs of Western Europe and Great Britain have been ascribed to an astro-archaeological significance (Steinberg and Lanteigne 1992). In California the Key Stone petroglyphs are associated with fertility rocks, upon which Pomo couples wished for children (Parkman 1989: 70). On the other hand, it is believed, on the basis of existing ethnographic parallels, that the cup marks of Kenya are related to a local game bao. Perhaps, like the bao game of Kenya small dot and cup- like marks of Kumaon were also associated with some kind of games(s), as the squarish patterns of Devidhura and parallel or linear arrangements at Suraikhet and Petshal suggest (Kharakwal and Rane 1997). Dubelaar may be close to the mark in saying, "Petroglyphs are more than products of playful pastime, considering the time, energy, inventories, artistic skill, etc., which they required and considering sometime nearly inaccessible spots where they are located" (1992: 30). The cup marks in rock shelters and stone alignments at Petshal, and in the Chitai Reserve Forest suggest that the authors were semi-nomadic or pastoral people of these hills (Kharakwal 1993). The cupules of Kumaon are similar to the ones found in association with the Megalithic culture in Vidarbha and northern Karnataka regions. In absence of contextual evidence it is difficult to state whether they were created by the Megalithic people in Kumaon. Over four hundred cupules were examined but no one was found bearing any chisel or cut mark. Perhaps these dots or cupules were made by pastoral groups long before the introduction/wider occurrence of iron in these hills. However, cup- like marks and motifs bearing cut marks or cup- marks with polished surface could be dated to the middle of first millennium BC when iron had become common. Some of the medium and large size pits may have even been made during the medieval or late medieval period, though no dating material has been found in these pits so far. Perhaps, the medium and large sized pits were derived from dots, cupules or cup like pits. They were made with a definite purpose in mind which is obvious from the amount of time, energy and skilled labour that went into their creation. The medium sized pits may have served the purpose of grinding some substances however, the large sized must have been used for storage. The wide occurrence of a variety of cupules, large sized pits, engraved motifs and the present use of Ukhal in the middle Himalayan region altogether seem to indicate</page><page sequence="6">166 Bulletin of the Deccan College 58-59 (1998-1999) that there has been a fairly long tradition of engraving and petroglyphs. Copper hoard Although we are not aware of any Chalcolithic site from Uttaranchal so far, the discovery of a copper hoard, containing over half a dozen anthropomorphs, weighing 2.5 to 3.5 kg., at Bankot in Pithoragarh district (IAR 1988-89: 87) is very significant. They contain 98% copper, 1.22% iron and a minor impurity of arsenic. (Pant 1991: 41). It is also worth mentioning here that there is an old mining and smelting tradition in Uttarakhand, which has been dated back to first millennium B.C. (Agrawal and Kharakwal 1998). Iron Age Over half a dozen Painted Grey Ware (PGW) culture sites have been reported from Uttarakhand, out of which Thapli (Tehri) and Purola (Uttarakashi) are located in Garhwal and remaining in Nainital district (IAR 1965-66: 53- 54, IAR 1986-87: 80-82). Thapli (Nautiyal et al. 1978-79), Purola (Nautiyal et al. 1989) and Kashipur in Nainital district (IAR 1965-66: 53- 54) were also subjected to excavations. Besides PGW, Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW) has also been found in Nainital district. Burials A few stone lines burials were discovered at Malari in Chamoli district by D.P. Agrawal and S. Dabrai in the late fifties. Subsequently, a small scale excavation was conducted by Nautiyal and Khanduri (1986) and found spouted pots, which bear vertical and horizontal grooved lines forming a sort of geometric pattern all along the body and also on the oval handle. Mathpal (1986: 20-22) reported stone lined burials from Western Ramganga valley in Almora district and subsequently Garhwal University excavated some of these burials at Sanana and Baseri. They found dolmenoid cists and urn type burials, which were rectangular on plan, oriented east-west and ranging in size from 128 X 40 cm to 232 x 58 cm. Their discovery of urn burials at Baseri seem to be interesting, which were separated from the twin cist chambers by a wall running north-south. Regarding the wall the excavators opine that such a need could be felt if the two burial types belonged to two different groups of people. The cist burials were either in east-west or in north- south direction. (IAR 1987-88: 105-106). They discovered bowls, dishes, jars and miniature bowls of grey and red ware. Some of these pots contain painted designs similar to the PGW pottery. Disarticulated human bones including femur, tibia and fibula were also found in these burials. Extensive explorations were launched between 1990 and 94 to locate more burial sites in this region. As a result of intensive exploration, a large number of stone lined rectangular burial sites were discovered on the aggredational terraces of the western Ramganga, Gomati, Ghangli Koshi and Mansari Naia in Almora district. The burials at Ganai-Chaukhutia in the Western Ramganga vary from 60 to 127 cm in length, 42 to 57 cm in width and 25 to 65 cm in height whereas at Ladyura (Ghangli) the length was found varying between 130 to 184 cm, width 49 to 88 cm and height 40 to 50 cm. To erect these burials 3 to 10 cm thick Himalayan cist slabs were used. The burials discovered in the valleys of Kosi, Gomati and Mansari naia are also similar in size (see for details Agrawal and Kharakwal 1 1998).</page><page sequence="7">The Archaeology of Kumaon Region , North India 167 Ladyura Another burial site Ladyura is situated about 5 km north of Baijnath in the fertile valley of the Ghangli, a tributary of Gomti in Bageshvar district. Following our discoveries a team of Archaeological Survey of India led by Shri A.K. Sharma excavated two cists at Ladyura in June 1991 in order to confirm their plan. These rectangular cists were erected inside grave pits cut into the shale bed rock. They are oriented N-S length-wise and vary in size. For the cist no 2 the 'U' shaped grave pit was 80 cm deep, 190 cm long, 80 cm wide at the top and 55 cm wide at the bottom. The cist measured 184 cm in length, 53 cm in width and 45 cm in height and was filled in with the same soil obtained by cutting the pit. Initially, the rectangular cist of the upright stone slabs was perhaps covered with more than one capstone. The space between the upright ends was packed with stone chips. Generally, the capstone of the burials is bigger and projects on all sides across the top edges of the orthostats. Two post holes (measuring 16 and 13 cm in diameter in layer 3), were made almost equidistant from the upright orthostats of their respective sides, one on the NW end and the other on the SE end of the cist. Perhaps there were two more similar post holes, one on the SW and another on the NE end of the cist. The excavator opines that, "... after internment of the mortal remains and other funerary objects and after filling (two on each side) and one central beam was erected over the burials" (Sharma 1991: 77), perhaps to support super structure. This appears to be a unique feature of Kumaon cist burials, though further excavation is needed to confirm this. Besides burials, cairns and menhirs have also been discovered in these hills. Unlike the peninsular Indian cist burials the Kumaoni cists are buried at a depth ranging from 40 to 150 cm, and typologically cists, are quite close to the Kherai graves (Kharakwal 1993; Kharakwal and Harbola 1996). Pottery shapes like convex sided bowl, pedestalled cups, high neck globular jar and convex sided bows with knobs of grey and red ware were found from various exposed burials. These shapes of Kumaon are similar to those found in the Kherai graves and also at Tahirbai Depe. The excavation of Sanana and Baseri also yielded grey and red wares, which is similar to PGW assemblage, according to the excavators. The Kumaoni graves are located on the river terraces (sometimes near the confluence or on one or both sides of a river) and quite close to the hill slopes. This is also a striking similarity of selection of location with respect to those of the Swat, and Kherai graveyards. At the present state of our knowledge, the Kumaoni burials may be categorized into the following types: 1. Cists with a single capstone, 2. Cist with more than one capstones, 3. Twin cist chambers, 4. Cists with slab at the bottom, 5. Burials that are protected from all the sides, by a wall of dressed stones, and 6. Urn burials. Sometimes there is an overlap of two or more types, thus giving rise to a new type. e.g. 1 and 4. The Kumaoni cist burials are secondary, perhaps, evolved from primary burials. Since the primary burials have not been encountered so far it may be assumed that the authors of these graves entered these hills with a latter trend of disposal of their dead. However, interestingly a horse skeleton was excavated at Malari (Nautiyal and Khanduri 1986: 88), located to the NW of Kumaon, in the Himalayan zone. Possibly, the authors of the Malari and Kumaoni burials were same people and they entered Kumaon through Malari. According to Stacul's scheme the Kherai graves date back to the mid-second millennium</page><page sequence="8">168 Bulletin of the Deccan College 58-59 (1998-1999) B.C. where both primary and secondary burials were erected. On the basis of similarity of pottery shapes and burial typology, the Kumaon burials may be of a slightly later date than those of the Swat (Kherai), thus giving us a tentative date between second millennium B.C. and the beginning of the first millennium B.C. It may, therefore, be stated that the authors of these burials perhaps introduced iron technology in Kumaon sometime in the first millennium B.C. if not earlier. Metallurgy Kumaon-Garhwal hills are known for its hoary metallurgical tradition; copper, iron and lead were mined extensively in ancient times (Atkinson 1981: 259-98). Several ancient mining sites eg. Rai-Agar, Sira, Gangoli, Kharahi (of copper), Asurchula, Lukhani Uleni, Lob (of iron) have been discovered. Apart from slag at every site furnaces and retorts were also found at Rai-Agar, Lukhani and Asurchula. An analytical study was done with the help of XRD method and it was found that people mined ores which contain high amount of haematite, Malachite and Goethite. The metal technology had come into existence as early as first millennium BC if not earlier as Uleni, an iron smelting site, has given a C-14 date of (PRL 1648) 2770 ± 90 BP (Agrawal and Kharakwal 1998). Perhaps copper-bronze technology was already in practice as over half a dozen copper anthropomorphs from Bankot have been assigned to Chalcolithic phase (Joshi 1992). Moreover, the find of large bronze tridents in early medieval temples and extensive use of copper utensils in these hills suggest that people had discovered these metals in remote past. It is worth mentioning here that the Tamta community of Kumaon still practice traditional copper mining and smelting. Ethnographic studies revealed that traditionally 'Agar' name is associated with those villages where smelting or mining of metals was carried out since centuries. Iron technology was perhaps introduced in these hills by the authors of Megalithic culture. Historical Phase It seems that this mountainous region was an important cultural entity of the kingdom of Ashoka as the famous inscription of Kalsi is located in Dehradun district of Uttarakhand. The Kušana rulers seem to have reached these hills as their coins have been discovered from various sites in Kumaon-Garhwal. Moreover several sites, e.g., Rainhat, Kashipur, Panduwala, Narayankali, Bharatmandir, Itoli, Kansyari and many others have yielded Kušana type bricks and pottery. Joshi (1989, 1992) also strongly argues that the Kunindas and Arjunayans jointly drove out the Kusanas from these hills. The Kuninda tribe appears to have been very powerful during the early centuries of the Christian era as a large number of copper and lead coins, issued by them, have been discovered from Uttarakhand and its adjoining regions. They were possibly responsible for habitation deposits at several sites, e.g. Baijnath, Kansyari, Ladyura, Chaukhutia, Vibhandesvar, Kashipur, Purola, Ranihat etc. Their coins on palaeographical grounds have been dated between 2nd cent. B.C. to 4th cent. A.D. (Joshi 1989). The Historical, Early Medieval and Late Medieval phases of these hills are characterised by the construction of thousands of Indo-Aryan style temples, Brahmanic icons, forts, water springs and other secular structures. The Katyuri kings ruled these hills from 7th to 13th cent. A.D. and theirs' was the golden phase of architectural activity in this region. Following are the details of some historical sites in Kumaon region.</page><page sequence="9">The Archaeology of Ku m ao n Region, North India 169 1. Narayankali Narayankali, located 12 km east of Almo ra town, is well known for Goddess Kali's shrine. There is a complex of 51 small and big other shrines of shikhara style dedicated to Kali, Shiva, Lakulisa, Vishnu, Rama and several other regional deities datable to medieval and late medieval period. A number of icons of lord Vishnu, Shiva, Lakulisa, Matrika pattas of Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrāni and Chamunda with Narshingh, Kartikeya and Ganesha have been enshrined in these temples. These icons are identical to those of Katyuri period and this complex is situated on the terrace of Binsar- garh, a tributary of the Suyal. There is a small law mound located on the same terrace spread merely over an area of hectare and the entire terrace and the modern flood plains are littered with pottery. Local villagers have almost levelled the mound for agriculture and they recount that often large pots or pot sherds, bone fragments, stone object get exposed while ploughing. The following wares were found at the site: A. Plain Red ware, B. Red-slipped ware, C. Coarse Grey ware, D. Black-slipped ware. The pottery is made of levigated clay fired at high temperature as the oxidised core, in case of red ware, would indicate. This red ware is predominantly found at the site and a variety of shapes were noticed i.e. globular and carinated jars with externally thickened rim; basins, bowls and dishes. In some cases red wash or slip has been applied on the exterior. This ware largely matches with that of Ranihat period II B and Hastinapur period III as far as shapes are concerned. Few fragments of fine grey ware were also found. It is made of fine levigated clay and small pots, bowls and miniature posts were made in this variety. The surface treatment of this pottery is similar to the grey ware tradition of PGW. Besides these, one fragment of a dish of Black-slipped Ware (BSW) was also found. It has featureless rim, vertical sides and possibly had a flat base. It has a grey core and is treated with black slip, which is then burnished. It is similar to the BSW associated with Northern Black Polished Ware (NBP). This potsherd has provided a clear indication that the Kumaonis were well aware of BSW tradition if not NBP during the early centuries of Christian era. Apart from pottery, T.C. beads and spindle whorl were also picked up from the site. 2. Chaukhutiya Chaukhutiya is situated near the confluence of the western Ramganga and Kaurav garh, about 16 km north of Dwarahat in Ranikhet tehsil of Almora district. The Kaurav garh, flowing south- west, joins the Ramganga at Ganai and both the rivers have enriched the entire area with roughly 2 km wide fertile alluvial terrace. A number of cist burials were discovered in the aggredational terrace near Koorman village and Agneri shrine where the Early Historic pottery deposit is superimposed the cist burials. A low and small mound was located on the same terrace at Chaukhutiya, which has been levelled by the villagers for farming as still about one meter habitation deposit can be seen in the exposed river section. According to the local tradition the later Katyuri shifted their capital from Baijnath to Chaukhutiya. A few pot sherds of red ware were picked up during the explorations from the flood plain of Chaukhutia. The pottery was made of fine clay to which was added lot of sand and gritty material possibly to strengthen the core. The collection comprises carinated and globular jars and bowls. The shapes of this assemblage match with Ranihat Pd. III.</page><page sequence="10">170 Bulletin of the Deccan College 58-59 (1998-1999) 3. Kansyari Kansyari is located about 3 km southeast of Baijnath in Bageshwar district, where two small mounds are located each at Kansyari and on the right bank of Gomati river in Purara village. A large number of cist burials were also encountered in this area (Kharakwal 1993) some of which yielded dull red and grey ware pottery. The mound at Kansyari has been destroyed and levelled for farming, however at Purara roughly half a hectare area of the mound is still intact. A well dressed rectangular memorial stone (145 x 45 x 21 cm) was also found at Kansyari close to the mound. Here also the agriculture fields are littered with pottery and burnt bricks (39.5 x 24 x 6 cm, 34 x 22 x 6.5 cm) and brick bats. The villagers recollect that while levelling the deposit at Kansyari a paved floor of Himalayan cist stones, a Siva linga, a few stones similar to the once used in Katyuri temples, were found. It is therefore quite likely that there was shrine next to the habitation. The assemblage consists of a variety of flared-sided bowls, globular jars, basins, lids, lamps and dishes. In few cases paintings in black was also noticed on the rim portion. The red ware pottery, as far as shapes are concerned, when compared, is similar, to that of Hastinapur. 4. Baya/ is Sera Baijnath was the seat of Katyuri kings who ruled over entire Uttarakhand and its adjoining areas between 7th and 13th century A.D. Bayalis Sera is located, on the bank of Gomati, near the well known Baijnath temple complex at a distance of 2 km from Kansyari, in Bageshwar district. The site appears to have spread over an area of 1.5 hectare of which less than a hectare is intact. The surface collection of the low mound yielded Red and Grey wares and bricks. Besides, the agricultural fields of Hat village, located near Bayalis Sera, are also littered with pottery and brick pieces. The ceramic assemblage of this site is similar to that of Kansyari. 5. Bhilkot Bhilkot (29° 54'; 79° 39'), is situated about 5 km north of Baijnath on the fertile valley of Ghangli, a tributary of the Gomati, in Bageshwar district. This area is popularly known as Malla Katyur and is composed of two-fold terrace system. Two low mounds with less than a meter thick deposit were noticed each at Ladyura and Teet-Amsyari villages. It is, however, also recorded here that the agriculture fields of this valley are littered with pottery, predominantly Red ware and brick bats. This ceramic asseblage is also predominated by shapes like cups bowls, medium and large size globular jars, basins and dough plates of Red ware. Besides pottery, a squarish broken tablet (measuring 4.5 cm) and an iron nail were found apart from slag. This area also has yielded large number of cist burials, two of them were subjected to excavations, which yielded dull Red ware and bits and pieces of bones. However, a grey ware bowl with three knobs, a cup and Red slipped ware of coarse variety are discovered during the explorations. 6. Gochar Gochar is located 3 km south of Dwarahat in Ranikhet tehsil about 74 km north west of Almora on a gentle hill slope. Dwarahat was also one of the important centres of Katyuri Kingdom as a large number of Rekhaduel style temples are located here. The illustrious examples of trirath, panchrath and octagonal temples belonging to Katyuri art assigned between 9th and 13th century are worth noticeable at this place. The agricultural fields between Gochar and Chandeswar are littered</page><page sequence="11">The Archaeology of Kumaon Region , North India 1 71 with pottery, the concentration of which was noticed near Chandeswar. A few pot sherds were picked up during the exploration, which comprise Red ware bowls and jars. 7. Bibhandeswar Bibhandeswar is located at a distance of 5 km from Dwarahat enroute Jalali. A low mound was located at Itoli which yielded sprinlers, bowls, jars and basins of red ware belonging to Kushana period, besides bricks (34 x 22 x 6.5 mm). The mound, though destroyed now, spreads over an area of about 2.5 hectare (Agrawal et ai 1991). 8. Bagwalipokhar Bagwalipokhar (29° 44' N: 79° 29' E) is located about 60 km north of Almora on a fertile valley of the Gagas river in Almora district. The agricultural fields here are also littered with large amount of pottery predominantly red ware and brick bats, the concentration of which was noticed near the State Bank of India office. The villagers recount that there was a low mount close to the Bank building which had partially been levelled over the years for agriculture and remaining was destroyed during the metalled road construction about twenty years ago. It is, however, recorded here that an exposed section in the seasonal rivulet, close to Bagwalipokhar station, about a meter thick habitational deposit was noticed. Apart from ceramics a few glass bangle fragments and terracotta beads were also found during the explorations. 9. Bisar Bisar is situated about 5 km north west of Pithoragarh town on the hill slope facing west. A sun temple, datable to 10-1 1th cent. A.D., of Rekhadeul style was found in the village. A standing sun icon has been enshrined. A few Red ware pot sherds, made of fine clay and fired at high temperature, were collected from the agricultural fields located near the temple. The shapes include of bowls, jars, lids and basins. 10. Bhatkot Bhatkot is located on the outskirt of Pithoragarh town where a thin deposit measuring 50 cm was found covering an area of about half a hectare. A few red ware pot sherds were picked from the site. The pottery is made of fine clay and fired at high temperature as their oxidised core would indicate. The assembage consists of bowls, jars, handis and globular pots. 11. Banasur Fort Banasur fort is located about 5 km west of Lohaghat town in Pithoragarh district. The fort is built by dressed stone masonry at a height of 1910 AMSL on a terrace like plateau which has natural rock proturberance. The fort is about 90 m long (N-S) and 20 m (E-W) wide and a total circumference is about 230 m and total height is 8.70 m. To the north-east of this fort, at a distance of about one km, a circular structure/defence wall was found which is locally known as Ukhakot. Usha (Ukha) is supposed to be sister of Banasur (Asur-Bani-Pal?), the Assyrian king. The maximum diameter of this structure was measured 30.80 m (NW-SE), average thickness 1.50 m and height 2.80 m. Some rectangular structures were found inside this defence wall. A terracotta cake and few pot sherds of Red ware were collected from the Banasur fort and Ukhakot. The pottery is made of find clay to which was added sand as tempering material. It was fired at high temperature as their oxidised core would indicate, but their body is very porous. An iron</page><page sequence="12">172 Bulletin of the Deccan College 58-59 (1998-1999) mining and smelting site known as Lukhani was also discovered in this area. Thus it is clear from the above discussion that the Kumaon-Garhwal region has great archaeological potentiality as man undoubtedly occupied this hilly terrain right from stone age. Conclusion This paper is an attempt to present the results of our explorations with chronological sequence. It is now clear from the above description that this region has great archaeological potentiality and it was occupied right from stone age. Leaving aside the prehistoric rock art, the stone age repertoire is meagre compared to the Nepal and Punjab Siwaliks, perhaps due to lack of explorations. The chrono-stratigraphy of rock paintings of Uttarakhand have been established. As many as five different layers of paintings were discovered. Besides sampling for AMS dating, identification of organic material was also conducted. A variety of rock engravings and cuplés were also studied in pan-Indian context. The discovery of a large number of cist- burials and several ancient mining and smelting sites have pushed the date of iron technology back to first millennium BC in this region. Similarly, several Early Historic settlements are also discovered during, the course of explorations in these hills. A number of locations eg. Pithoragarh, Uttarkashi, Bagwalipokhar and others containing lacustral deposit are yet to be studied for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic data. In fact, it is an attempt to put forward the archaeological discoveries of Uttarakhand made so far, which may give birth to many more new questions for future research.
