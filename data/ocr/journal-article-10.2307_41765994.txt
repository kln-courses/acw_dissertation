<plain_text><page sequence="1">Further Reading Brewing an Ancient Beer, page 24. The classic work on Sumerian beer making is A.L. Oppenheim and L.F. Hartman, On Beer and Brewing Techniques in Ancient Mesopotamia ( Jour- nal of the American Oriental Society , Suppl. 10), 1950. S. Katz and M. Voigt, "Beer and Bread: the Early Use of Cereals in the Human Diet," Expedition 28 (1986) 23-34 revives the Braidwood- Sauer debate. J.S. Hough, TheBiotech- nology of Malting and Brewing (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985) is the best single source on the subject. R. Braidwood et al., "Did Man Once Live by Beer Alone?" American Anthro- pologist 55 (1953) 515-526 presents the original arguments for and against the early production of beer. M. Civil, "A Hymn to the Beer Goddess and a Drinking Song," in Studies Presented to A.L. Oppenheim (Chicago: Oriental In- stitute, 1964) is the original transla- tion of the "Hymn to Ninkasi." Pequot Country, page 34. For a useful study of the archaeology and history of the Pequots, see Laurence M. Hauptman and James D. Wherry, eds. , The Pequots in Southern New England: The Fall and Rise of an American Indian Nation (Norman: The University of Oklahoma Press, 1990). On the his- tory of the Pequots in colonial times, see Francis Jennings, The Invasion of America (New York: W.W. Norton, 1976). Neal Salisbury, Manitou and Providence (New York: Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1984). Neil Asher Silber- man, "The Pequot Massacres" in Military History Quarterly 1:3 (Spring 1989) 74-81. Sacred Stones of Hawaii, page 40. Recommended are Mary Kawena Pukui, Nana I Ke Kumu , volumes one and two (Honolulu: The Queen Lili- okalani Children's Center, 1972).

Marija Gimbutas, The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe (Berkeley: The University of Califor- nia Press, 1982). This book has gener- ated considerable controversy. Its main thesis is that the Neolithic cul- tures of "Old Europe" worshiped a pantheon of gods and goddeses that was dominated by a Great Mother Goddess. Suzanne Greub, ed., Expres- sions of Belief: Masterpieces of African, Oceanic, and Indonesian Art from the Museum voor Volkenkunde , Rotterdam (Rizzoli: New York, 1988). A catalog of a recent traveling exhibition that fo- cuses on tribal artifacts, many of them figurines, from a little-known ethno- graphic collection in the Netherlands. The catalog underscores the myriad uses and meanings of anthropo- morphic figurines among modern, nonindustrialized societies of the Third World. Lauren E. Talalay, "Rethinking the Function of Clay Fig- urine Legs from Neolithic Greece: An Argument by Analogy," American Jour- nal of Archaeology 91 (1987) 161-169. Us- ing historical and ethnographic ana- logues, this article argues that a type of Neolithic figurine from southern Greece was intentionally designed to split apart, each half acting as an iden- tifying token or primative contract. Demitrios Theochares, Neolithic Greece (Athens: The National Bank of Greece, 1973). To date, this is the only general and well-illustrated book on Neolithic Greece. Contributions cover topics such as agriculture, animal husbandry, trade, and burial customs. Peter' Ucko, Anthropomorphic Figurines (Royal Anthropological Institute Occasional Papers 24), An- drew Szmidla, New York. A pioneer- ing and detailed book that focuses primarily on predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete. Digging a Rebel's Homestead, page 54. Perhaps the best all-around history of seventeenth-century Vir- ginia is still Edmund S. Morgan, American Slavery, American Freedom (New York: W.W. Norton, 1975). The un- 78 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">paralleled wit and style of Ivor Noel Hume, Martin's Hundred (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1979) brings together scholarship and the excitement of ar- chaeology in his book on one of Vir- ginia's earliest English settlements. William Kelso, Kingsmill Plantations (New York: Academic Press, 1984) is a summary of his work at seven- teenth- and eighteenth-century plan- tations near Williamsburg. The book covers sites of tenants, servants, over- seers, innkeepers, and plantation masters from the early seventeenth century through the eighteenth cen- tury. This remains the premier - if somewhat pricey - work on Virginia historical archaeology. For a discus- sion of architecture and the social conditions of seventeenth-century Virginia see Cary Carson, Norman Barka, William Kelso, Gary Wheeler Stone, and Dell Upton, Impermanent Architecture (Winterthur Portfolio, 1981). The two classic historical treat- ments of Bacon's Rebellion - taking opposing pro-Bacon and pro- Berkeley stands - are T.J. Werten- baker, Torchbearer of the Revolution (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1940) and Wilcomb Washburn, The Governor and the Rebel (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1957). A more recent work by Stephen Saunders Webb provides the most detailed account of Bacon's Re- bellion yet published. Webb's book, 1676 : The End of American Independence (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984) also places the Rebellion in a broader perspective that includes King Philip's War in New England and the Iroquois League of Peace.</page></plain_text>
