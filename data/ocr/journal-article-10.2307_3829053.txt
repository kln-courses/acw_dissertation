<plain_text><page sequence="1">VICTORIAN BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR 1997 Edward H. Cohen, Editor This sixty-sixth annual bibliography has been prepared by a committee of the Victorian Divi- sion of the Modern Language Association of America: Edward H. Cohen, chair, Rollins Col- lege; Michael H. Bright, Eastern Kentucky Uni- versity; Andrea Broomfield, Wheaton College; Cheryl Cassidy, Eastern Michigan University; Christopher C. Dahl, State University of New York, Geneseo; Maria Frawley, Elizabethtown College; Anthony Giffone, State University of New York, Farmingdale; Anne L. Horn, Temple University; Edward S. Lauterbach, Purdue Uni- versity; William Scheuerle, University of South Florida; Richard C. Tobias, University of Pitts- burgh; Christine Tootill, Liverpool John Moores University. The bibliography attempts to list the noteworthy publications of 1997 (in- cluding reviews of these and earlier entries) that have a bearing on the Victorian period, as well as selected publications of earlier date that have been inadvertently omitted from preceding Victorian Bibliographies. Unless otherwise in- dicated, the date of publication is 1997. Refer- ence to a citation previously listed (for example, to a work cited in the Victorian Bibliography for 1996, published in the summer 1997 issue of Victorian Studies, p. 776) is indicated by the form: "See VB 1996, 776." All "See VB" refer- ences are to the original citation. Researchers seeking reviews should examine each issue of the bibliography published since the listing of the original entry. In general, subsequent cita- tions are continued up to five years. The com- mittee normally does not cite reviews of fewer than three hundred words. The Victorian Bibliography is organized in a six-part division. Some significant cross-references are noted, although not all that are possible. Sec- tion I lists both enumerative bibliographies relat- ing to the period and studies of printing, publishing, libraries, and book production. Sec- tion II lists documents, general histories, and stud- ies in historiography. Section III (subdivided into six parts) lists titles on Victorian economics, edu- cation, politics, religion, science, and social envi- ronment. Section IV lists references to all arts except literature, including studies of architec- ture, household arts, landscape, music, painting, the performing arts, photography, and sculpture. Section V is exclusively given to literature, literary history, and the development of literary forms. Section VI lists individual authors, first citing sig- nificant new editions of their works and then list- ing critical and biographical studies; journals devoted to individual authors are enumerated in this section in single, extended entries, but reviews appearing in their pages are listed under the title of the book reviewed. Entries in the bibliography conform as closely as possible with the mechanics of documentation described in The MLA Style Manual (1995). Initials and standard abbreviations are used regularly to provide essential information with minimal use of space. Acronyms used for journal titles are those assigned in the 1995-97 MLA Directory of Periodi- calt, for serials scanned by the committee but not included in the MLA Directory, a list of titles and their abbreviations appears below. Place of publi- cation and publisher are often shortened (for ex- ample, NY for New York and Oxford UP for SUMMER 1998</page><page sequence="2">Victorian Bibliography for 1997 Oxford University Press); when the place of pub- lication is clear by designation (for example,Uni- versity of Chicago Press), the entry lists only the publisher. For commercial publishing houses, only the first name is given (for example, Harper for Harper and Row). The bibliography continues the policy of cit- ing in Section VI only publications bearing on the Victorian period for Conrad, Shaw, Wells, Yeats, and other transitional figures who pub- lished major works in the twentieth century. A more comprehensive list of current studies of these writers appears in the annual MLA Interna- tional Bibliography. The editor gratefully acknowledges the assis- tance of Luna Anico in the preparation of this bibliography and the financial support of Rollins College.
