<plain_text><page sequence="1">ETERNALLY EVE: IMAGES OF EVE IN THE HEBREW BIBLE, MIDRASH, AND MODERN JEWISH POETRY. By Anne Lapidus Lerner. Pp. xii + 238. Hanover, N.H.: Brandeis University Press, 2007. Cloth, $60.00. Paper, $26.00. Eternally Eve is not an exhaustive history of images of Eve through the ages but an organized set of feminist readings and intertextual explorations of carefully selected works. Lerner brings a literary sensibility to her read ings in all three genres mentioned in the subtitle, the last including works in</page><page sequence="2">Hebrew Studies 51 (2010) 399 Reviews English, Hebrew, and Yiddish; her analyses are nuanced and often persua sive. The book fulfills its own stated feminist goals?indeed the author's skills at times seem to exceed the demands of this kind of feminist rubric. Regardless, the literary analyses stand on their own and together serve as a provocative but sensible guide and annotator of Jewish texts in a variety of periods. The story of Eve eating a fruit from the tree of good and evil and the story of her creation are the central biblical texts in which Eve appears, in spiring a wealth of literary and visual art. To be more precise, the creation of woman described in Genesis 2 and attributed to J is the one most often attended, the more colorful and anthropomorphic of the two creation stories, in which man is created first and woman is fashioned from his side or rib. Each of Lerner's three chapters is devoted to a different episode or period in the life of the biblical Eve?the creation, the Garden of Eden, life after Eden?each juxtaposing a number of texts from the three genres and periods. This organization based on the chronology of Eve's life rather than of the works read, supports the books goal of "interpreting biblical text in light of later texts" and of cultivating a "three-way conversation" (p. 2). The clarity of the book's structure allows it and the reader to move lightly between poem and midrash and biblical text via theme and contrasting ways of interpreting, apologizing for, re-writing, or critiquing the Hebrew Bible. Lerner is less interested in tracing any particular thread in the history of Eve (indeed her selection is at odds with that desire) than in intertextuality and interpretation themselves, the power of poetic allusion or midrashic in terpolation to change the way one reads an earlier work?in Lerner's words, "how later writers have uncovered multiple dimensions in Eve's stories" (p. 12). The book takes a decidedly second-wave feminist stance consistent with this methodology. Eternally Eve hopes to "break open texts" and make Eve's story resonate for twenty-first century readers in order to reveal "exe getical possibilities inherent in the text, but not attended, that interest us as readers" (p. 4). Eve is the welcomed excuse for these rich readings. The first chapter of Eternally Eve undermines popular notions of woman's secondary status in two ways. Lerner retrieves the implications for woman of Gen 1:1-2:4, challenging the valorization of the second creation narrative. In the first, "male and female" are both called by the name of Adam and seem to be created at once at the end of a six-day marathon of creation that begins with the creation of light. Turning to the second story of creation, Lerner undoes interpretations that put the woman at a disadvantage. Eve's "secondary" status here, Lerner claims, may in fact make her superior: man is created from the earth while the material of woman is at a remove from that lowly substance. Lerner re-reads Gen 2:21-22 showing how translating tsela as "side" rather than as "rib" puts the woman on a better</page><page sequence="3">Hebrew Studies 51 (2010) 400 Reviews footing. (The latter translation was that of the Rabbis; in their dialect and that of subsequent readers, rib is the primary definition of tsela.) Lerner's own translations are careful and, in the context of biblical exe gesis, respond well to the ambiguity and contradictions of the text. For example, her decision to translate adam and ha-adam as adam (italicized and lower case) and the adam, respectively, rather than as the man or Adam, helps bridge the gap for the English reader: it underscores a meaning of the word most often lost in translation, adam as the name of the species (i.e., both male and female). The book is invaluable for readers with access to the Bible and midrash in translation alone. Instead of simply deciding for the reader, or allowing other translators or interpreters to do so, Lerner succeeds in explicating the biblical and midrashic passages by showing how they work. The analysis of midrash would seem to have little connection to the book's goal of breaking open the biblical text for twentieth century readers, but it figures in at least two ways in Eternally Eve. Along with the poetry and Lerner's own readings, the selected midrash provides an interpretation of the biblical passages at the center of this project. Lerner does a fine job of explicating midrash, attending to its interpretive methods and the finer points of argumentation. The midrash also serves as an example of how readings of the Bible can magnify an anti-female bias or even introduce it where the biblical text is neutral. Lerner draws out the gender ramifications of these readings, pointing out some of the more misogynist moments. At times, the poems act as an antidote or alternative feminist interpretation. While the author is clearly aware of the claims of higher biblical criti cism, she chooses not to integrate them into her analysis. She is interested in the Bible as canonized, a complete work enriched by its fissures and contra dictions. This is certainly a legitimate stance, and Lerner is in good company among critics in implicitly identifying the literary with lower biblical criti cism. Yet the book's repeated insistence on the ambiguity of biblical texts (e.g., pages 60 and 74) draws attention to the distinct and sometimes feuding voices and had this reader wondering at the divide maintained between documentary or supplementary hypothesis and literary readings of the kind Lerner practices. Perhaps the question of the relevance of higher biblical criticism ought to be asked anew for each reading. What is lost and what is gained by this divide between the philological claims of lower and higher biblical criticism or, put another way, between the "purely" literary and the philological-historical questions of authorship? When is it unnecessary, when productive? These questions arise most pointedly in chapter one of Eternally Eve because the creation of Eve is part of and has ramifications for the larger creation narratives, as Lerner herself indicates. Given that Lerner's reading tries to undo the prioritizing of the J narrative over the story of</page><page sequence="4">Hebrew Studies 51 (2010) 401 Reviews creation, the motives of these authors might be useful in deepening the reader's understanding of how the literary results, including ambiguity, are determined. At least in some instances, an integration of other literary methods, broadly understood, might have added complexity to the literary method in the narrower sense of the word. The clarity of Lerner's writing makes this an accessible book suited to readers with an interest in biblical exegesis or in modern poetry inspired by the Bible. With its careful treatment of the Hebrew Bible, midrash, and Yiddish and Hebrew poems, the book will be welcomed by readers without knowledge of these languages who have an appreciation for how much may be lost and often is lost in translation.
