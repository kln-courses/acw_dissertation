A Politico-Legal Study with a Pageantry of American Indian History By Jennings C Wise Ed by Vine Deloria, Jr (New York Macmillan, 1971 xiv + 418 pp Appendixes, notes, and index $8 95 ) The time frame for Red Man m the New World Drama extends from about 1000 to 1971 The author, with broad thematic strokes, sweeps through the impact on aboriginal America from the Norse discovery, the successive modern European and Anglo-American contact and, finally, near annihilation by the United States In this time frame the history to 1871 is more romantic conjec- ture than reality From 1871 to 1971, with Vine Deloria's editorial amendments, the work becomes analytically germane and commandingly relevant In the pre-1871 section, however, the author's historical license is tempered by incisive comment on constitutional dilemmas Concerning the Indian and the Constitution of 1787, he states ''In an age of broadened charity toward men, reacting alike against the narrow bigotry of Calvin and Loyola, the self-ap- pointed champions of human freedom showed themselves powerless to liberate either the Indians or the Negroes from the tyranny of the modern democracy . The one was deliberately left subject to a political servitude that they might be exploited by the states, the other for purely economic reasons, in bondage, so that all the freedom the Constitution m fact guaranteed was reserved to the white man" Also in the pre-1871 section there loom here and there points which, through reader synthesis, can explain the evolution of tribal status from vassalage to quasi-sovereign dependent community to wardship managed by a generally indifferent and often callous bureaucracy Great weight is given to the role of Indian leadership m attempting to thwart the process of cultural genocide set upon aboriginal America by the United States government Joseph Brant, Little Turtle, Tecumseh, Osceola, Sitting Bull, and Geronimo are cast as patriots seeking to protect and preserve tribal identity and values against the Anglo-American military-bureaucratic jugger-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 683 naut. He rates Geronimo as "perhaps the finest fighting man ever produced by the American Indian race." Once the Indian ceased to be a military problem his management became the exclusive concern of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The author likens this agency to a "Russian bureaucracy" engrafted "on American Democracy" in its tyranniz- ing management of the American Indian. The author contends that from 1871 to 1934 there was no hope for the Indian because of an immutable cycling of legislation adopted for the management of the American Indian. All Indian bills moved from congressional committees on Indian affairs to the secretary of the interior who turned to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for counsel. Thus legislation "reflected the views of the Bureau. ... One hundred years of such responsibility, with little outside supervision, had crystal- lized the methods of the Bureau in an undefeatable system." The process was devoid of "guidance with respect to the sociological needs of the red race." The "texperts were to be found, not in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but in the Smithsonian Institution. However, their superior knowledge was bitterly re- sented by the politically appointed clerks in charge of Indian affairs. ... Great ethnologists like Powell and Morgan and Mooney, whose lives were devoted to the study of the nature and peculiar needs of the red race ... were jealously excluded from consideration by the committees of Congress charged with passing on the policies and measures framed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 'Impractical dreamers' they were called." A revolution in management of the American Indian occurred in 1934 when Congress adopted the Wheeler-Howard Act (Indian Reorganization Act). This statute recognized Indian institutions as having a valid place in American life. Pervasive changes included tribal constitutions and legalizing Indian religions on the reservations. The commissioner of Indian affairs assigned the task of implementing the new law was John Collier, an anthropologist. He committed himself to the concept of cultural survival as a means of bringing the Indian tribes into the modern era. Deloria's comments indicate that the 1960s and 1970s have been a time of renaissance in aboriginal America. It is genuine because it is constructed on a continuum of Indianness which survived the obscurantist, cultural genocide campaign of the United States government. This determined survival has been explained as a psychic phenomenon due to the Indian's mental resistance to strain. "This mental quality on the part of the red race had undoubtedly resulted from the spiritual poise born of a philosophy of life that makes God not an anthropomorphic deity but a universal, omnipresent, benignant force in nature" which gave the Indian staunchness, self respect, dignity, and strength of mind. "A system which discounted this quality, confusing it with inherent stolidity and mental ineptitude, was grossly faulty." UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA ARRELL M. GIBSON</page></plain_text>
