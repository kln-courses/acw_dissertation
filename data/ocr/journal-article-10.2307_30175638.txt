KOCH EARLY EARLY A QUARTER Of a century ago this writer left the immediate ranks of public-school workers and joined those on the so-called higher level. Since that time he has been engaged largely in the training of personnel for the secondary schools. Five years as a teacher and five years as a high-school principal afforded a rich ori- entation for this later phase of his experi- ence. When he knew that he would stand before classes in secondary education and share the responsibility for their later suc- cess, he asked himself whether he would repeat the error of those who had trained him by painting teaching only in ideal and therefore unrealistic hues, preparing the unwary neophyte for disillusionment on the job, or whether he would portray the EDITOR'S NOTE: Most teachers, says Dr. Koch, have never had an opportunity to obtain more than an "incomplete, dis- torted, and indistinct" concept of the pro- cedures and problems of administration. And this lack of understanding works to the disadvantage of teachers, administra- tors, and the school system. Dr. Koch is professor of education in the School of Education, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich. work of a teacher in its true colors-a mixture of both bright and dull. As he thought over his own experiences in the classroom and in the office, he de- cided to do the latter and has since had no cause to regret the decision. In the meantime, it has been strengthened by more than a decade of incalculably rich experience which has taken him into hun- dreds of schools and given him contacts with superintendents, principals, some thousands of teachers, and innumerable citizens and boards of education. He has seen much that was self-sacrificial and courageous and in keeping with correct tradition, and a great deal that was igno- rant or servile or selfish. From all of this have come some very definite conclusions about the human factor in school administration. As far as the teacher's concept of administration is concerned, it is rather obvious that it is at one and the same time incomplete, dis- torted, and indistinct. Such an inadequate understanding of an office which so pre- dominantly affects the teacher's professional welfare-and therefore inescapably his per- sonal life-is probably due to a variety of reasons, such as these: 1. No part of his formal preparation for teaching deals systematically with adminis- tration as a specialized field. 195</page><page sequence="2">196 The CLEARING HOUSE 2. No administrator through in-service channels gives the teaching staff a syste- matic insight into his place in the scheme of things. 3. More or less adventitious, run-of-the- mine contacts with administrators and their behavior consequently and inevitably lead the teacher to identify school execu- tives as anthropomorphic creatures who talk largely in the negative, mysteriously about the budget, and compellingly about the "policies" of the board of education. Moreover, across-the-table gossip of others as faultily advised as he is fortifies him in such convictions. 4. And, sad to relate, despite standard principles of procedure and codes of pro- fessional ethics school administrators as in- dividuals have wittingly or unwittingly confirmed teachers' suspicions by placing their personal interpretations upon what constitutes ethical conduct, loyalty, satis- factory achievement, and the like. 5. Finally, the teacher is being forced to take sides by a rising army of unionized teachers who are convinced that adminis- tration, and therefore administrators, must be categorized as essentially hostile and treated as such. But to get on with the job of considering what the secondary-school teacher should know about school administration let us point out that he should understand these things: 1. That he is identified with a specialized level of the school system-namely, the high school-with its own administrative head whose rights and responsibilities are not unique but are delegated and there- fore generally have no status in law. 2. That, because of the foregoing fact, the high-school principalship most clearly emerges in the largest schools but tends to become progressively indistinguishable from the superintendency as schools grow smaller. 3. That such coalescing of functions ex- poses the teacher to the administrative over- sight of two executives, rather than one, who may or may not see eye to eye on all policies and procedures. 4. That through a combination of fac- tors, including the traditional attitudes of teachers themselves, high-school principals are largely reduced to the status of man- agers of plants-scarcely accepted as educa- tional leaders. Obviously the teacher should recognize a few irreducible factors in the teacher-ad- ministrator relationship. For instance: 1. The teacher is a party to a startling paradox, to wit, the teacher is more signifi- cant than the administrator, or, as a certain writer recently put it, "she is fundamentally more important than her boss . . . we venerate the great teacher and laugh at the man in the administrator's chair."1 Para- phrased, this means that we extol the teacher for whom all others are hewers of wood and drawers of water. 2. School administration, in and of it- self, has no excuse for being; instead, its sole purpose is to make education available to those who can profit from it. 3. In most instances, this task has become so complex that the teacher cannot func- tion effectively without special personnel to prepare the way before him. 4. To meet the involved exigencies of his job the school executive must be as definitely specialized in a multitude of related areas as the teacher must be in relatively few. 5. Making education at any level avail- able to a community has long since ex- ceeded the powers of a single individual and therefore is fundamentally a coopera- tive undertaking. 6. Since educating the rising generation is a joint responsibility, its successful out- come turns upon the point of mutual 1George H.

What trends or signs of the times should the teacher discern? 1. A definite movement, as yet scarcely out of the talking stage, is gaining mo- mentum toward more so-called democracy in administration. On this point, however, a certain writer recently said, "Surely administrators must know and practice the techniques of co- operative educational effort. They must abide by the principles of democratic fel- lowship. If they do not they will inevitably bring about their own professional down- fall. But this constant anti-administration propaganda indulged in by some petty educational preachers has become a sort of buffoonery. It practically serves to stimu- late suggestible and neurotic teachers to attacks of educational dyspepsia. If we need administrators, and for practical reasons we seem to, let us give them the authority they need for genuine performance. If they misuse their authority, it is our business to displace them."2 2. Regardless of the present status of co- operative participation in administration, another two-way relationship is farther ad- vanced-to wit, the pooling of judgments in curriculum construction and in the re- vision of classroom procedures. Almost twenty years ago, Stuart A. Courtis argued for such an approach to educational problems under the general caption of the philosophy of efficiency versus the philosophy of growth in school management. He contended then that a one-way relationship between executive and teacher, whereby orders and suggestions with the force of orders flowed from the office to the classroom but nothing flowed back, got results quickly but led to little growth; whereas, the converse (the two- way relationship), wherein the teacher tested such orders and suggestions and then passed critical observations to the office, was conducive to much growth although at the sacrifice of a degree of efficiency. Also twenty years ago, still another writer, Herbert H. Foster, delimited such a cooperative relationship as follows: "Every member of the [high school] or- ganization shall participate as fully in the determination of administrative procedure as is consistent with the efficiency and unity of that procedure as well as with the placing of the responsibility that such determination involves." Obviously the limits of an article like this will not permit the cataloguing of many specific administrative procedures which teachers should understand. For them to have such understanding would help not only them but their executives also. For instance, what should they know about budgeting and other basic fiscal procedures; the building of a high-school schedule and other programming practices; the interpreting of the school to the public; and so on, through the whole range of executive responsibilities? Perhaps one may generalize by saying that, by and large, the more fully teachers understand the work of the school executive, the more will such knowledge illuminate their own sphere of action. Certain it is that those executives who systematically introduce their teachers to the mysteries of administration multiply themselves many fold and cultivate peace and satisfaction for all concerned.
