<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART MICHAEL WALKER Edinburgh University In recent years, some new sites of naturalistic anthropomorphic and zoomorphic rock paintings and also of schematic rock paintings have been found in south-east Spain. The discoveries extend the area previously known of the naturalistic rock paintings of eastern or 'Levantine' Spain, see fig. I, and demonstrate their geo- graphical overlap with the zone of Andalusian schematic rock paintings. This article describes some of the sites, and comments upon the archaeological significance of the 'Levantine' art and its age. Many years ago, don Sebastian Chanes of the village of El Sabinar, in the termino municipal of Moratalla (Murcia), observed some rock paintings at rock shelters on his land, high in the side of a limestone canyon in the Sierra de Taibilla, near the point at which the four provinces of Murcia, Albacete, Almeria, and Granada meet around the headwaters of the Rio Taibilla, a tributary of the Rio Segura.

The rock shelters lie on the north side of a valley which runs from east to west, and bears a stream feeding the Rio Taibilla. It is common for sites of naturalistic 'Levantine' art to be situated on the north slopes of canyons and valleys, where they are known in Spanish as solanas because they are exposed to the full force of the sun for most of the day. The shelters are to be found between the hamlet of Calar de la Santa in the east (at approx. N. 380 10' 45", E. I' 31' 00", see Sheet 889 of the I :5,ooo of the Instituto Geografico y Castastral map series),' and in the west, the hamlet of Royo Tejera, also known variously as Arroyo Tejera and Arroyo Tercero (at approx. N. 380 II' I2", E. I 29' 15 on Sheet 888). Several rock shelters bear traces of paint, of which only four have recognisable motifs, since the others are much obscured by smoke from fires lit in the past by shepherds. The adjacent piece of land to the north of the painted shelters is called Calar de Tapia or Escalar de Tapia, after which the sites have been numbered in a preliminary note (Walker I969). It seems preferable, however, to refer to the sites using the names proposed by the first two students of the paintings (Martinez Sanchez I969; Carbonell Escobar I970) in ignorance of whose work my earlier note was published, and who named the first two rock shelters after the canyon itself, the Canial'ca del Calar, and a third after a freshwater spring in the canyon, the Fuente del Sabuco. However, there is another rock shelter in the canyon with a single, schematic anthropomorphic representation, although this has not been illustrated here, as it lies in the shade and is hard to photograph. The first three shelters have also received mention in Beltrin Martimez (i968a). The Fuente del Sabuco site (plate i, fig. 2) is at approx. N. 380 II' i0", E. I' 30' 00". The paintings are on the curving rock wall of the shelter, which has a smooth floor that rises to merge with the rear wall. They consist of two groups of anthropo- morphs painted at very different scales; one group averaging between ten and twenty centimetres in height, the other only four or five centimetres and more schematically drawn. Some of the figures carry bows and curved staves. One 44; FIGURE 2. Fuente del Sabuco.

An obscure human figure is on the back of a large quadruped (equid?). The fauna includes another, more convincing equid towards the right-hand side of the panel. A caprid may be seen in figure 2, as also a canid (wolf?), an indistinct animal that has been interpreted as an ursid (Beltrain I968a), and a small, indistinct quad- ruped with horns. Other animals are portrayed outside the area reproduced in figure 2, including a horned animal (bovid?) and a cervid (see Walker I969, whose illustrations are not reproduced here on account of their inferior quality and inaccuracy). Below the large equid on the right is a skeuomorphic motif in a pale shade of red (see Walker I969). A number of other anthropomorphs can be distinguished beyond the area reproduced. All the paintings are executed in a dull red, except for a few in a lighter, pale red.2 Some 500 m to the east of the Fuente del Sabuco rock shelter, and about half that distance from the spring itself, lies the first of the Caflaica del Calar rock shelters (plate 2, fig. 3), at approx. N 380 II' 07", E. I' 30' 14" and about i,I6o metres above sea-level. Only a small part of the painted area is reproduced in the accompanying illustrations (for a comprehensive drawing, see Walker I969). Outside the area here reproduced, there are two very strange animals with long tails painted in white, and also white dots. The schematic anthropomorphs, cervids, dots, and rayed 'sun' motif shown here are painted in red. The style is utterly different from that of Fuente del Sabuco, resembling that of the Andalusian schematic rock art school rather than the 'Levantine' naturalistic school. About Q RC C FIGURE 3. Cafalaica del Calar, El Sabinar, Moratalla (Murcia).</page><page sequence="4">556 MICHAEL WALKER five hundred metres to the east yet again, there is the second rock shelter of the Cafiaica del Calar (plate 3, fig. 4). The figures here are in the naturalistic style, and most elegantly painted. The animals are clearly cervids and caprids, and an archer and a crouching (stalking?) anthropomorph are painted. The third rock shelter lies a little to the east of the second, and has a single, schematic, anthropomorphic representation on a shaded wall of a rocky cleft, which is rather inaccessible. Further up the Taibilla valley, in the pedanta of Rio Moral and opposite the cortiUo of Pedro Andres, in the te'rmino municipal of Nerpio (Albacete), are the well- known paintings at Solana de las Covachas, which have been the subject of a study by dofia Julia Sanchez and don Samuel de los Santos (Sanchez Carrilero i956-6i). The paintings are situated at approx. N. 380 o6' 55s', E. I' I9' 32', and some I,500 metres above sea-level (see map Sheet gog). I have attempted some not very successful drawings of the paintings (Walker I969) that failed to bring out some of the detail of Sanchez's photographic plates. Some photographs are shown here, taken from colour reversal film, and reproductions of details by Mrs de Meric (plates 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, figs. 5a, 5b, sc). Once again, Cervus elaphus and Capra ibex (pyrenaica) dominate the fauna. The anthropomorph painted in solid colour with out-turned lower limbs, and carrying a bow or wand dominates shelter 5 (plate 4a) and has what may be a penile projection. It is comparable with a painting at the Cueva de la Vieja, Alpera (Albacete) (Breuil et al. I9I2), where a similar large figure is associated with bulls which have been overpainted with antlers, so-called 'pseudo-cervids' (Maringer I963) that may have been either hunting decoys or may have had unknown and esoteric significance. Archers may be seen in plate 4a, and skirted anthropomorphs (and see also plate 4b, for details from plate 4a). Plate 4a also shows superpositioning of animal figures on the left-hand side. There is another interesting parallel between Solana de las Covachas and Alpera. At each site there is a cervid with palmate antlers, portrayed in a very different manner from the antlers of Cervus elaphus at these sites, or, for that matter, at other Levantine sites. Breuil claimed that the cervid at the Cueva del Queso, Alpera, was an elk, an attribution disclaimed, however, by Cabre Aguilo (i9i5). The elk was FIGURE 4. Caialca del Calar.</page><page sequence="5">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 557 also held to be present at Minateda (Albacete) by Obermaier (I924) and also at the Cova Remigia (Castellon) (Obermaier I937). Despite the absence of giant cervids from eastern Spain in prehistoric times, as far as excavations are concerned, the form of the Solana de las Covachas antlers might be interpreted as representing Megaceros or even Alces, although C. elaphus may be the probable species intended. However, it should be pointed out that the identification of the animal as a giant cervid species does not demand the acceptance of Breuil's contention that such species are cold-adapted, periglacial ones, nor that the Levantine art should there- fore be interpreted as a periglacial phenomenon and thus contemporary with Upper Palaeolithic Franco-Cantabrian cave art. Far from it: Kurten (I968) holds that giant cervid species require 'parkland or savannah', and it is just such an open 'non-sylvan' profile that is demonstrated by layer b at the Cueva del Toll (Barce- lona), and where the 'non-sylvan' fauna contains species such as Capra ibex, that common subject of Levantine art, and not the cold-adapted and extinct fauna of the lower layers that correspond to the last glaciation (Donner &amp; Kurten I958).3 The drier climatic conditions indicated by layer b probably occurred around the time of the post-glacial climatic optimum, perhaps roughly equivalent to the Atlantic climatic phase recognised in north-western Europe in the fifth and fourth millennia B.C., although perhaps having a rather wider range in the Mediterranean zone, say 6,000-2,000 B.C. as extreme limits. As will be seen below, the internal evidence of the paintings has never convinced Spanish archaeologists of an Upper Palaeolithic date for the Levantine paintings. The extinct, cold-adapted fauna of the Upper Palaeolithic Franco-Cantabrian painted caves is not a characteristic element of the eastern Spanish painted rock shelters, and one must therefore doubt their contemporaneity with the Franco-Cantabrian art, which dates roughly from the period 30,00079,000 B.C. * * * * * Wild caprids are, like Cervus elaphus, a recurrent feature of Levantine rock shelter art. The chamoix, Rupicapra rupicapra, is portrayed in the Taibilla valley near Nerpio at the Prado del Tornero rock shelter. Nowadays the chamoix is confined to the Cantabrian and Pyrenean mountain ranges of northern Spain, and K\~~ ~ ~ \ '\' -;t7it % / ., '= '#J.~~~~~~~~~/A4 FIGURE 4.-Canalca del Calar. FIGuRE 4.

Solana de las Covachas, Nerpio (Albacete). is not found in the south-east. Other wild goats are found, on the other hand, notably the Spanish ibex, or cabra monte's. Some authorities divide the ibexes into two separate species, Capra ibex, the Steinbock, and Capra pyrenaica, the Spanish ibex, and subdivide these again into five and four subspecies respectively (Miller I9I2; Ellerman &amp; Scott I95I; Harris I960-I; Huerta y Ramlrez &amp; Palaus I967). However, there seems to be some interfertility between all wild goats (Zeuner I963: I40, but see Payne I968: 379-80 for qualification), so that the taxonomic specific and subspecific categories are biologically suspect. Perhaps the groups are better referred to as subspecies of C. ibex or even varieties (personal communication from Dr Michael Ryder of the Animal Breeding Research Organisation). The differences are based on details of the horns. In the domestic goat the horns are very labile in form, but the differences may have taxonomic validity for some wild goat groups. The ibex has a scimitar-shaped horn which is flattened antero- posteriorly and has circumferential ribs. The modern Alpine domestic variety of goat has similarly shaped horns except that they are keeled anteriorly as in the bezoar, from which it is believed to be derived. The bezoar is the wild species Capra hircus (aegagrus), a species never found west of the Aegean archipelago. Nevertheless, and despite the superficial similarities between some wild and dom- estic goats, there is a curious feature that distinguishes all wild from all domestic goat populations. The latter have horns that are homonymous (the right horn curls in a clockwise spiral, the left anticlockwise), whereas wild goats show the opposite phenomenon of heteronymity (Harris I960-I). Capra ibex (pyrenaica), sometimes qualified as (hispanica), is still found in the Levante, including the Sierra de Cazorla and the Sierra de Segura. Cervus elaphus is also found in this region. The mouflon, Ovis musimon, is also found in the Sierra de Cazorla (Huerta y Ramirez &amp; Palaus I967), but seems to have been introduced in recent times from Corsica or Sardinia, doubtless for purposes of the chase. It has no relevance to possible interpretations of sheep in Levantine rock paintings as at the site of El Mortero, Alacon (Teruel). Some Levantine rock paintings, however, show what may be domesticated goats. At El Polvorim (Castellon), there is what seems to be a man with bow and arrows leading or pulling a goat by a rope. An anthropomorph depicted at the Barranco de los Grajos also seems to be shown as grasping a caprid by a horn (see fig. 6b). Certainly, much more comparative caprid osteology needs to be undertaken</page><page sequence="8">56o MICHAEL WALKER 6a 6b FIGURE 6. Barranco de los Grajos, Cieza (Murcia). before we can exclude the wild caprids of the peninsula from the ancestry of the prehistoric domestic caprids there. Apart from a possible representation of a bovid at the Fuente del Sabuco shelter (Walker I969), bovids are not portrayed at the Taibilla valley rock shelters. At other sites near the boundaries of the provinces of Murcia, Albacete, and Alicante, however, they are portrayed. At the shelters at Cantos de la Visera, Monte Arabi, near Yecla (Murcia), there are both bovids and a finely drawn equid (fig. 7), FIGURE 7 Cantos de la Visera, Yecla (Murcia).</page><page sequence="9">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 56I and also a large bird. Bovids are not uncommon at Levantine art sites. The role played by wild Bos primigenius and Equus caballus in the ancestry of prehistoric domestic cattle and horses in the Peninsula is likewise unknown. Solana de las Covachas lies twenty kilometres south-east of the El Sabinar rock paintings, but between them in the Taibilla valley are several sites of rock paintings of both naturalistic and schematic art, largely discovered by the investigations of Dr Garcia Guinea. The naturalistic sites are: Abrigo del Prado del Tornero i; Hornacina de la Pareja; Abrigo de las Cabritas; Covacho de la Llagosa; Abrigo de Sautuloa; Abrigo del Cazador; and Abrigo primero de las casas de los ingenieros de la Presa del Taibilla (Garcla Guinea &amp; Krapovickas i958-9; Garcla Guinea I961-2; I962), to which list may be added a new site near Casa del Sapo (personal communication from donjaime Carbonell 1970). As at the Cafialca del Calar, there are also sites with schematic motifs, namely: Abrigo del Prado del Tornero 2; Abrigo del Idolo; Abrigo de los Idolos; Abrigo del Castillo de Taibona; and Abrigo segundo de las casas de los ingenieros de la Presa del Taibilla. Another group of recently discovered naturalistic paintings from the province of Murcia is in the termino municipal of Cieza, eighty kilometres east of the sites in the Taibilla valley. The finds were made in I962 by don Eduardo Lopez Pascual of Cieza (Lopez Pascual I968) and the paintings have been studied by Beltran Martimez (I968a; I968c; I968d) whose photographs and drawings may be compared with the illustrations presented here. There are five painted panels in three rock shelters which face north-west, a rather unusual situation for Levantine art sites, in the side of a limestone canyon called the Barranco de los Grajos in the Sierra de Azcoy at approx. N. 380 I6' oo", E. 2? I8' 33" and at about 500 metres above sea-level (see map Sheet 86i). The principal panel comprises a group of anthropomorphs many of which wear knee-length garments. The anthropo- morphs do not show obvious secondary sexual characteristics, with the possible exception of one very elongated anthropomorph with what have been inter- preted as pendulous breasts. One figure has a kind of head-dress, and another is carrying an object from his waist which could be interpreted as a hafted axe. Of the ten quadrupeds illustrated, at least two are cervids; one is an ibex; one a possible bovid; and four are strange-looking headless beasts with large bodies filled in with skeuomorphic lines. They also have tails and spindly legs, and may perhaps be sheep, although they cannot be accurately identified4. The figures are painted in two shades of red, perhaps indicating execution at different times. In the same shelter on the opposite wall is a small painting (fig. 6b) of two skirted anthropo- morphs with outstretched arms, one figure apparently grasping a caprid by its horns. Fifty metres further up the canyon is a large rock shelter containing many fallen blocks. The side wall of this shelter bears a series of strange figures which includes bitriangular anthropomorphs carrying staves painted in black and partly covered by a layer of calcite, indicating at least some antiquity. There are also two small quadrupeds in black whose limbs terminate in circles, a small anthropo- morph whose arms terminate in circles also, and another small quadruped with a tail. Farther over, there is also a larger anthropomorph in red and what appear to be letters in red. These figures are likely to be medieval, and are certainly quite unlike other examples of Spanish schematic or naturalistic rock art. However,</page><page sequence="10">562 MICHAEL WALKER further back in the rock shelter in a niche there is a sinuous red anthropomorph that is probably prehistoric. About three hundred metres farther up the canyon again there is another small rock shelter in which a single, black anthropomorph is painted. The Barranco de los Grajos anthropomorphs are rather more stylised than those from some Levantine rock art sites, and the execution demonstrates less attention to detail. The scale of the figures is larger than in the paintings of the schematic type. A site with schematic paintings has recently been found near the headwaters of the Rlo Segura on a mountain called the Collado del Guijarral which, whilst being in the province ofJaen, lies behind the cortio of Parolis in the termino of Yeste (Alba- cete). About 50 metres below the summit of the 1,217 metre-high mountainthere is a rock shelter at approx. N. 38? I6' 25", E. I' 13' 55" (map Sheet 888) containing schematic rock paintings (pl. 6). My attention was drawn to the paintings by don Samuel de los Santos of the Albacete Museum, and a visit to them was made in the company of don Jaime Carbonell Escobar in 1970. The paintings seem to have been known to the villagers of Parolis for many years. A prominent feature of the site are the oculus signs, which are also found at rock shelters in the Taibilla valley near Nerpio, and at many schematic art sites, as well as painted and en- graved on bone phalanges found at many sites of the Almerian and Valencian Copper Age. Two nondescript quadrupeds are portrayed, and two archers, one of whom is wearing some kind of knee-length garment. There are a number of large butterfly-like figures interspersed among the other figures, perhaps birds. The strangest figures of all, however, are the large centipede-like paintings, which defy interpretation. Relationships of Levantine paintings Naturalistic rock paintings typical of the Levantine style of rock art are found at some Andalusian sites on the other side of the Segura watershed. These are: Peio6n de la Tabla de Pochico and Cueva del Prado del Azogue, Aldeaquemada (Jaen); Cueva del Santo, Santa Elena (Jaen); Cueva de las Grajas, Almaciles (Granada); Cueva del Coto de la Zarza, Topares (Almerla); Cueva Chiquita at the cortio of Los Treinta, Estrecho de Santonge,5 and Desfiladero de Leira (also known as Lavaderos de Tello), all three of which are near Velez Blanco (Almerla). There is also an unpublished site near Nerpio, actually in the termino of Moratalla (Murcia), called Abrigo de la Mujer and studied by Garcia Guinea. This is presumably that shown near Nerpio on a distribution map in the Murcia Museum drawn by don Manuel Jorge Aragoneses. The Abrigo de la Mujer is mentioned in Beltran Mar- tinez (i968a: 247) although Beltrain also refers to another site in the termino of Moratalla (i968a: 226) reported by sr. Jorge which is apparently not the same one. New discoveries in the provinces of Cuenca and Valencia, along with the paint- ings of the Segura basin, have resulted in a southward shift of the centre of gravity of the Levantine paintings away from the Tarragona-Teruel-Castellon area to the north. The interest in this lies in the westward extension of rock art from Almerla, Granada, and Jaen across Andalusia to Estremadura. The rock art of this type is of the schematic kind which has been well studied by Breuil &amp; Burkitt (1929), Breuil (I93 3; 193 5) and Acosta (I968). As has been seen, paintings of schematic and naturalistic types are found in the rock shelters of the Segura basin close together.</page><page sequence="11">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 563 Indeed, schematic art occurs at many places in the Levantine zone, as a cursory glance at Breuil's study indicates (and see Appendix 2). The schematic art is over- shadowed by that of Andalusia, but nonetheless is present, emphasising that there is geographical overlap between the two types. Moreover, there are echoes of the naturalistic style further west, at the Cueva de la Pretina (Ca'diz), and at Las Batue- cas and Garcibuey (Salamanca) (Breuil I9I8-I9; Hernatndez Pacheco 1922). It is not only with the schematic art that the naturalistic art shows geographical overlap. A glance at the distribution map (fig. I) shows that there are a few sites in eastern and south-east Spain of Upper Palaeolithic Franco-Cantabrian art, both rock paintings and mobiliary art. Breuil repeatedly suggested that the Levantine art was contemporary with Franco-Cantabrian art (Breuil 1912, etc.), representing stylistically the Perigordian art of the Franco-Cantabrian series in eastern Spain. However, even if the artists possessed a backed-blade tool-kit (so-called 'Epi- gravettian'), neither on stylistic grounds nor on the basis of typical Perigordian lithic and bone industries, can the Spanish painted rock shelters be compared meaningfully with the Franco-Cantabrian Perigordian I-V stages, much less with the late East European Perigordian derivatives therefrom. The faunal evidence, which Breuil and Obermaier claimed indicated a period contemporary with the Franco-Cantabrian Upper Palaeolithic cultures, seems to point in a quite different direction towards a much later chronological period, as has been argued above. Indeed, apart from Bosch-Gimpera (I964), the faunal evidence has never convinced Spanish archaeologists of an exclusively Upper Palaeolithic attribution for the paintings (thus Cabre Aguilo I9I5; Hernandez Pacheco I924; I959; Pericot 1942a; 1942b; 1952; Martimez Santa Olalla 1946; Almagro 1947a; 1947b; I95I; 1952a; 1952b; 1954; I956; Beltran Martinez i968a; i968b). Some authorities suggest that the paintings are chiefly Neolithic or later (Martinez Santa Olalla I946;Jorda I964; I967). Jorda (I967) has stressed the need to pay more attention to the fauna than has been customary. There is a difficulty here in that we must try to distinguish between the wild and domesticated species of an animal genus in a zone, the Penin- sula, where faunal atavisms have lingered late. Cervus elaphus, Capra ibex (pyren- aica), and Sus scrofa roam the mountains of south-east Spain even today, especially in the Sierra de Cazorla, Sierra de Segura, and Sierra Nevada, and in Valencia in the Sierra Martes. Bos primigenius, Equus caballus, Rupicapra rupicapra, and perhaps even Ursus arctos and Canis lupus, were also available wild as subjects for the Levantine artists. Bears today are not found in the south-east, nor are the chamoix, but both species occur in the Pyrenees and Asturias. Various Neolithic and Bronze Age sites have yielded bones identified as Bos taurus, Cervus elaphus, Capra hircus, Sus scrofa, Meles meles, Vulpes vulpes, Ursus arctos, and various canids and felids (Siret &amp; Siret 1887; Blance I960; Boessneck I969). On the other hand, portrayals claimed by Breuil of Merck's rhinoceros, the saiga antelope, lion, and bison at Levantine shelters, have failed to convince most workers, who, from Cabre (I9I5) onwards, have stressed the absence of such fauna from Levantine excavations (Jorda I967). Nevertheless, Almagro (I956) has remarked on the proximity of the Upper Palaeolithic painted caves of Los Casares and La Hoz (Guadalajara), to the Levantine rock paintings of the Sierra de Albar- racm (Teruel), and the possibility may exist that cold-adapted fauna survived into</page><page sequence="12">564 MICHAEL WALKER post-Palaeolithic times in the mountains of the Levante. Among the animals portrayed at Los Casares is Gulo gulo, the glutton (Ucko &amp; Rosenfeld I967), other- wise unknown, and a mobiliary carving of Magdalenian style reputedly from Alcaniiz (Teruel), shows the reindeer, Rangifer tarandus (Breuil I964), a species which Breuil also believed he could identify at Minateda (Albacete), although reindeer bones are likewise unknown from eastern Spain. As has been mentioned earlier, Breuil also claimed to identify the elk, but as has been argued, neither giant deer nor elk are necessarily indicators of glacial or periglacial conditions, and cannot be used to give an Upper Palaeolithic date to Levantine art even if the identifications are correct. At the Cueva de Parpallo (Valencia), the engraved stone plaques of Solutrean and Magdalenian age in any case point not to a cold-adapted fauna replete with the extinct forms so often portrayed in the caves of the Dordogne or the Cantabrian Mountains, but rather to a fauna similar to that of the Levantine rock shelters (see Pericot 1942b). The presence of elegant, perspective drawings, on the one hand, and of stiff, awkward drawings, on the other hand, recalls a similar mixture from many sites of Levantine art. Indeed, the origins of Levantine art were sought plausibly in the Magdalenian by Burkitt (1925). The paintings from the Upper Palaeolithic site at the Sierra de Montsia (Tarragona), have also been compared with Levantine art (Ripoll Perello I964b). The Barcelona school of prehistorians has always preferred to relate the first phases of Levantine paintings to the late Upper Palaeolithic (thus Pericot ig5oa; 1952). Upper Palaeolithic art is known from other Valencian caves, Les Mallaetes and Rates Penaes (Gurrea Crespo &amp; Pefialba Faus 1952; Jorda 1954a), and a Catalan cave, San Gregori de Falset (Vilaseca 1939). A new plaque with animal art is known from Can Butinya near Barcelona (Vicente i Castells I968). A few Levantine sites have been regarded as 'archaic' by Spanish prehistorians, especially the bovids of Cogul (Lerida), and Cocinilla del Obispo (Teruel) (Almagro I944; I947b). Various workers have proposed stylistic sequences that would derive Levantine art from the Upper Palaeolithic to a greater or lesser extent, the latest scheme being that of Beltran (i968a; I968b). In the last analysis, the significance of stylistic differences between different sites, or between different figures at the same site, is a matter of personal taste and opinion. The differences are of an order comparable with that in the Franco-Cantabrian series, and within many other series of primitive rock paintings. Whether such differences signify artistic individuality on the part of the painters, or whether they signify different contemporaneous, perhaps regional, artistic 'schools', or alternatively different successive artistic 'styles', are matters for speculation. And these, alas, archaeological investigation cannot resolve. The most we can say about Levantine artistic origins from the internal, painted evidence, is that the cold fauna, that is so prominent a feature of Franco-Cantabrian cave paintings, occurs so rarely in the Levante that, when it does, some exceptional explanation seems more likely than one which sees such fauna as a 'link'. Nowhere is that fauna portrayed in sufficient quantity to suggest a chronological overlap. On the other hand, it is possible that the Valencian caves, with Magdalenian en- graved plaques showing a fauna similar to that of the Levantine paintings, represent a phenomenon that may have lasted late in time when contrasted against the French and northern Spanish Upper Palaeolithic cave art, and that may just have been late</page><page sequence="13">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 565 enough to influence the earliest Levantine artists. However, as will be argued later, there may still be a gap between the end of the Magdalenian in the western Mediterranean and the beginnings of Levantine art of some two or three thousand years, for which we have no concrete evidence of cultural continuity as yet. Indeed, the caves with Upper Palaeolithic art in eastern Spain, whether wall paintings or mobiliary engravings, are conspicuous within the region by their very difference from the Levantine rock shelters, and if some connexion were to be postulated, it would have to be on the basis of the existence of many intermediate types of site demonstrating continuity of lithic assemblages, and traditions of naturalistic engraved plaques coexisting with Levantine paintings. Such inter- mediate sites are yet to be discovered. Arguments based on the internal evidence of Upper Palaeolithic and of Levantine art alone will not do. Indeed, the various approaches towards Upper Palaeolithic cave art of Leroi-Gourhan (I968) and of Ucko &amp; Rosenfeld (I967), when contrasted against the sequential and 'cyclical' stylistic hypotheses of Breuil, should caution modern archaeologists against basing speculations about the archaeological attribution of prehistoric art merely on arguments derived from examination of its internal details. For instance, super- positioning of figures, such as we have noted at Solana de las Covachas, was held by Breuil to indicate that different layers of motifs belonged to different evolutionary stages of the art. More economical hypotheses can be proposed based on ethno- graphic parallels drawn from modern, primitive, rock artists in Australia and else- where, who sometimes 'superpose' figures at very short time intervals for a wide variety of reasons. Supposedly stylistic variation between the different layers of the 'palimpsest' may represent no more than the varying skill of the draughtsmen who participated at the site. The invocation of different 'schools' or 'styles' is not a necessary assumption. At Minateda (Albacete), Breuil thought that there were thirteen layers of painted figures representing six major stylistic periods. Until a cave with such a series is found in which there is a good parallel series of lithic assemblages, preferably with fallen pieces of painted rock wall embedded con- veniently in some of the layers, the proposal that the painted layers demonstrate a chronological sequence spread over long periods of time and associated with known material assemblages from other, different sites, does not represent the most economical hypothesis available for the explanation of superpositioning. Moreover, the Franco-Cantabrian cave art is found in the dark zones of caves, which may even have been chosen to allow an orderly arrangement of artistic motifs (Leroi-Gourhan I968). It would be very hard to reconstruct such 'sanc- tuary' organisation at Levantine rock shelters. In any case, these are not only not hidden from the light of day, but, on the contrary, are often located on those hill- slopes that receive the maximal sunlight available, as has been earlier pointed out. This is a most important functional difference between the two types of site. It cannot be explained on the grounds that in the Levante the warmth of the climate did not necessitate recourse to the deeper parts of caves for various reasons. For in the first place, the Levantine rock shelters are unpleasant, cold places in the winter, swept by fierce winds, and secondly, in the summer they are equally unpleasant, scorched places, where the rock is too hot to touch with comfort. Moreover, the Parpallo fauna indicates a temperate climate, and yet the Magdalenian artists did take to the caves in the manner of the Franco-Cantabrian artists. Certainly, both in</page><page sequence="14">566 MICHAEL WALKER summer and in winter the deeper parts of caves provide a more constant and more equable climate. The difference between the situation of Franco-Cantabrian and Levantine painted sites must be a functional one related to different, unknown, characteristics of the cultural groups responsible for them. It renders unlikely any cultural affinity between the two groups of artists. There is yet another major difference between Levantine and Franco-Cantabrian art. In the latter, anthropomorphic representations are few and most obscure, In the Levantine paintings, in contrast, human beings are plentiful, and clearly de- picted in recognisable activities (hunting, dancing), sometimes in relation to each other or to animals. The anthropomorphs of Upper Palaeolithic age close to the Levantine region at the cave of Los Casares (Guadalajara), are poorly conceived, if not perversely indistinct (see Cabre I940-ib; Beltrain &amp; Barandiaran I968). The Levantine anthropomorphs are very differently executed in an 'expressionist' manner (Porcar Ripolles I943a; I953) with clearly recognisable accoutrements and weapons. Furthermore, there is an important scaling factor. The Levantine figures may be as small as 4 or 5 cm in height, whereas Franco-Cantabrian representations can be very large and impressive. Again, most Levantine figures are painted in monochrome, whereas polychromy is a feature of some Franco-Cantabrian sites. The lively scenes vibrating with human interest of the Levantine paintings cannot be paralleled from any Franco-Cantabrian, Upper Palaeolithic painted cave. The archaeological attribution of Levantine art Although it must be remembered that only a small number of caves with Franco- Cantabrian paintings have yielded material assemblages (Blanc I964), nevertheless they are far more numerous than the number of Levantine art rock shelters which have provided archaeological remains. The caves of San Gregorl de Falset and Les Mallaetes, from which Upper Palaeolithic engravings are known, have given lithic assemblages that include Perigordian, Solutrean, and post-Palaeolithic ('Epi- gravettian') backed-blade tool types, and Parpallo has both Solutrean and Magdale- nian assemblages. Except for isolated finds of possibly Solutrean points from the Cueva Chiquita (Almerla), and Cantos de la Visera (Murcia), Upper Palaeolithic tools are unknown at Levantine art sites (Pericot I95ob; I96I). The industries that have been described are of a post-Palaeolithic facies: backed-blades of small size, scrapers on the ends of blades, thumb-nail scrapers, awls, denticulate and serrated pieces, and geometric forms. The industries are all rather nondescript and lack characteristic bonework. Epipalaeolithic industries have been described from Cogul and the Sierra de Albarracim sites (Almagro 1944; I947b; I952b, etc.). At Cocinilla del Obispo, a site with so-called 'archaic' bovid paintings, the assemblage con- tained trapeze and crescentic geometric elements compared with the Valencian cave, the Cueva de la Cocina (see below), whilst at the Donia Clotilde site, which has more schematic art, a fully trapeze industry was found. Recently, a backed- blade industry has been found at a site close to a rock shelter with Levantine art at the Barranco de los Grajos (Murcia), from the upper layers of which there is pottery, including cardial-impressed ware, and a single crescentic geometric flint. The site also yielded red ochre, perhaps used for execution of the art (Walker, in preparation). A microlithic trapeze was found near the La Joquera Levantine art site (Porcar Roig I932). Sometimes artefacts of Neolithic and even Bronze Age</page><page sequence="15">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 567 type have been found at Levantine rock shelters with art, including polished stone tools, pottery, and even a segmented bone pinhead (Pallares I9I5-20; del Arco I9I7; Ortego I946; I948; I950-I). In addition to the backed-blade element in the post-Palaeolithic of eastern Spain, there is also a strong geometric element (cf. 'Sauveterrian' and 'Tardenoisian' in north-western Europe). It has been suggested that the backed-blade element derives from the Perigordian, and that both backed-blade and geometric forms continue side-by-side, each contributing towards the Peninsular Neolithic (Jorda 1949; I953; I954b). Perhaps the geometric forms can be derived from the small proportion of such implements found' among the Magdalenian assemblage at Parpallo where trapezes, notched blades, and microburins occurred in addition to the more typical Magdalenian (see Pericot I942b). One may note that even in the Perigord the Magdalenian VI assemblages acquire backed-blades (not unlike Gravette points), shouldered points, and geometric crescentic forms, in addition to the usual Magdalenian tool-kit. These are capable of comparison with an assem- blage from layer 4 at the Malaga cave of Hoyo de la Mina (Such I919; I920). Immediately above this layer was a layer with backed-blades of microlithic size, small awls on blades, burins, and other atypical forms. Above this, in turn, was a layer with symmetrical trapeze points, crescents, awls on small backed-blades, end-scrapers on large blades, and unretouched large blades, as well as coarse, plain pottery. This lay below more typically Neolithic deposits. Whilst it is possible that geometric forms arrived in coastal areas of Spain from further east and north in the Mediterranean basin in the early Neolithic, it is perhaps as likely that the Peninsular examples derive via post-Palaeolithic trapezes from Upper Palaeolithic ones in the Peninsula. At the Cueva de la Cocina (Valencia), there were found three layers that yielded symmetrical trapeze points and scalene forms (Pericot I945 ;Jorda I949). However, the uppermost layer contained coarse pottery, and the lowest layer also contained backed-blades. The pottery includes an example of cardial-impressed ware, and also a sherd with two incised animals depicted schematically. From the middle layer there were a number of stone plaques engraved with skeuomorphic motifs, likened by Jorda (I967) to Azilian painted motifs on pebbles. It would be equally reasonable, however, to compare these with skeuomorphic plaques found in Magdalenian contexts at Parpallo (Pericot 1942b) and the Cueva de la Paloma (Asturias) (Hernatndez Pacheco 1923). Skeuomorphs also occur alongside natural- istic figures in Levantine paintings, as at Fuente del Sabuco (Walker I969). It is unnecessary to invoke Azilian parallels. Pericot (1948) suggested that the inhabitants of the upper layer at the Cueva de la Cocina might have painted the naturalistic figures of Levantine style at the nearby art site of Cinto de la Ventana. The la Cocina assemblage may be compared with a prolific industry from the Covacha de Llatas (Valencia), where a layer of predominantly crescentic geometric forms over- lay a series of predominantly trapeze forms, and both plain and incised sherds occurred (Jorda' &amp; Alcacer 1949). This stratigraphy makes it hard to argue, as is sometimes done, that trapeze forms are somehow more 'Neolithic' whereas crescents are somehow more 'Mesolithic', and should caution against the view that crescents are intermediate chronologically between backed-blades and trapezes. (There is no intermediate layer at la Cocina, anyway, of that sort.) As Hugot (I963)</page><page sequence="16">568 MICHAEL WALKER and many other prehistorians have demonstrated, geometric forms and micro- burins represent blade-tool derivatives quite different in kind and manufacture from backed-blades. Trapeze forms are arrow-points, whereas backed-blades are knives strengthened by abrupt retouch to provide a working surface for the finger- tip which can exert pressure in the same way as with a modern pen-knife. Possibly crescents represent backed-blades made on the by-products of the microburin- trapeze manufacturing technique. Nevertheless, differentiation of the different tool- types in archaeological deposits is only to be expected from time to time if the various tool-types are functionally separable, even among contemporaneous forms. Geometric industries in Portugal have been dated by radiocarbon to the fifth millennium B.C., and it is interesting in view of such dates and the presence of cardial-impressed ware at both the Barranco de los Grajos and the Cueva de la Cocina, to note that a fifth millennium date has been obtained for a site with cardial-impressed pottery, the Coveta de l'Or (Alicante), in keeping with similar dates for sites with cardial-impressed pottery in France, Italy and elsewhere. At the Coveta de l'Or, the pottery occurred with polished stone axes and a geometric industry, and at higher levels there were found bifacially worked barbed and tanged arrow-points, and pottery which was plain and decorated both with incised and relief cordon ornament. At the Cueva de la Sarsa, as at some other Levantine sites, cardial-impressed pottery was found associated with bifacial arrow-points. This has led some workers to see two components in the Levantine Neolithic, one consisting of cardial ware lacking a strong geometric industry, the other consisting of plain ware and geometric flints. The evidence for such a view is open to criti- cism. It should be noted, however, that cardial-impressed pottery has been found at some Spanish sites that are probably as late as 2,000 B.C., and that presence of such pottery at a site cannot be taken as proof of an early Neolithic date by itself Moreover, pottery with incised animal ornament like the la Cocina sherd has a late date of around 2,000 B.C. at other sites where it occurs in the Peninsula (see below). Two small caves have recently been discovered near Villena (Alicante), which are very close together, but which have yielded a geometric and a backed-blade industry respectively (Soler Garcla i968-9). Backed-blade assemblages occur stratified above Solutrean layers at the Valencian cave of Les Mallaetes, but they also contain a few shouldered points and geometric forms. At the Cueva Volcan del Faro near Cullera (Valencia), a backed-blade assemblage that has been compared with some tools from Parpallo by the excavators, lay stratified above a layer that yielded the only known Magdalenian spear-thrower or bMton de commandement known from eastern Spain (Fletcher Valls &amp; Aparicio Perez I969). Both at Les Mallaetes and the Cueva Volcain, the backed-blade layers yielded plaques bearing traces of paint. It seems reasonable to conclude that both backed-blade and geometric flint working traditions derive from the Upper Palaeolithic of the Levante itself, and it is with the fauna portrayed in the Magdalenian engraved plaques of that region that the Levantine rock shelter art has its nearest parallel. The flint types are probably functionally distinct, rather than distinguishable as the type-fossils of two, separate, cultural groups, and both tool-types can be associated both with the Levantine paintings and with the earliest pottery-using communities in the Levante.</page><page sequence="17">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 569 It is not necessary to look beyond the Peninsula for the origins of these tool types. It is, however, relevant to dispel suggestions that they and the Levantine rock paintings have north African associations (e.g. Obermaier 1924; Pericot 1952). Balout (I955) has emphasised that the Capsian of north Africa cannot be compared with the Peninsular post-Palaeolithic. The Capsian has transverse points on blades, a tool type unknown in Spain (Clark I958), and large backed-blades that are not really comparable with those of the Peninsular 'Epigravettian' (see McBurney I960; Tixier I963), as well as some very curious limestone carvings of human faces and other elements foreign to Spain and Portugal. Moreover, the distribution of the Capsian sites is an inland one in Tunisia (Tixier I963), and they are absent from those coastal areas through which the culture would have had to pass before embarking for the Peninsula. On the other hand, it is only fair to point out that the microlithic nature of the Peninsular, post-Palaeolithic, flint industries can be over-emphasised. However, the larger scrapers and blades can be derived quite satisfactorily from the Upper Palaeolithic, without any need to invoke the Capsian. On the other hand, in the Neolithic of Spain and Portugal, and especially in the south-west, there is a common type of bifacially worked, flint arrow-point which has a concave base (see Savory I968), and which ultimately derives from the Egyptian Neolithic, spreading from the latter to the north African 'Neolithic of Capsian tradition'. Indeed, many north African sites (e.g. the fourth mnillennium site of Meniet, see Hugot I963) have yielded artefacts that can be recognised in the Peninsular Neolithic, but this is most likely due to the uniformity and generalised nature of primitive Neolithic assemblages adapted to similar circum-Mediterranean ecological conditions, rather than to direct contact. AtJaatcha in Tunis, a site dated to around 3,000 B.C., there is even animal art on stone (Balout I955). However, maritime contact between Spain and Algeria-Tunisia under sail is difficult (Jaiuregui 1949) and must have presented insuperable problems for post-Palaeolithic and early Neolithic peoples. The matter of north African contacts in the Iberian Neolithic is further compli- cated by the occurrence in the Peninsula of a type of bifacial flint point foreign both to Egypt and to the Algeria-Tunisia region of north Africa, but which is especially well-developed in eastern Spain, although also found in Andalusia and Portugal. This is a bifacially worked arrow-point that is essentially barbed and tanged, but which undergoes a wide range of variation through stellate and rhomboidal forms to leaf-shaped ones. It is interesting to speculate on the ecological conditions that led to the great diversity of Neolithic arrow-points in some regions of Spain and Portugal, and the functional differences implied by the variations in shape. However, in north Africa such arrow-points are also found, though not, as has been stated, in the area most accessible by sea for maritime contact with Spain, Algeria-Tunisia, but rather in the north-west and especially in the more inland Saharan regions. The origin of these industries is mysterious, but is perhaps to be sought in the north African Aterian complex (Forde-Johnston i959). It is possible that the Aterian itself, at a much earlier, Upper Palaeolithic date, received in- fluences from the Spanish Solutrean with its fine, bifacially worked, barbed and tanged arrow-points (Howe I967: I7I), although here there are insuperable geo- graphical obstacles, especially for peoples who are not known to have possessed ships.</page><page sequence="18">570 MICHAEL WALKER Be that as it may, the north African Aterian Upper Palaeolithic complex has a bifacially worked, barbed and tanged, arrow-point industry, and whilst this gives way fairly rapidly to the Oranian cultural complex in those areas that border on the Mediterranean, to the south, in the Sahara, it can be invoked as a precursor of the Neolithic barbed and tanged arrow-points there. Contact between this complex, which is hard to date, and the Peninsula, would have to be assumed to have occurred via north-west Africa on this theory. The principal disadvantage of the theory is then exposed, because it is in those areas of the Peninsula, the west and south-west in closest relation to north-west Africa, that the barbed and tanged arrow-points are least common. Tarradell (I958; 1959) has demonstrated that by the Bronze Age north-African-Peninsular contacts were unimportant, and a similar verdict seems likely for the Neolithic and post-Palaeolithic periods. Although there is some animal rock art in north-west Africa, the Saharan paintings that are most comparable with those of the Levante are a long way from those areas of north Africa closest to Spain, being in the central Sahara, such as the Tassili n'Ajjer series. Not only are the geographical obstacles to direct contact, and the awkward intervening areas lacking the expected cultural type-fossils, serious drawbacks to theories of cultural relationship, but furthermore, such chronological evidence as is available suggests that the Neolithic artefacts of both Africa and the Tassili rock paintings are not earlier than, but rather, contemporary with if not later than, the Iberian post-Palaeolithic and early Neolithic assemblages, whereas the Capsian is considerably earlier. Similarities between the different circum-Mediterranean cultural complexes are better sought on the basis of cultural convergence dictated by uniform ecological conditions at the time of the post-glacial climatic optimum, itself responsible for their rough contemporaneity, rather than on the basis of trans- Mediterranean maritime contacts. Artefacts depicted in Levantine art The hunting techniques depicted in the paintirngs have been discussed in detail by Bandi &amp; Maringer (I952) and need not be entered into here. The large arrow- points employed by the archers at some sites, e.g. Solana de las Covachas (fig. sb), Cueva de la Vieja, Alpera (fig. 8a), and at the Cueva Saltadora (Castellon), suggest bifacially worked arrow-points, although another figure at Alpera (fig. 8b) might be employing a microlithic form, since two barbs are not depicted, but only one. Bifacial barbed and tanged arrow-points are typically Neolithic, but it is difficult to say with certainty how soon they were introduced. They are especially common in late Neolithic and Copper Age contexts, but they are also known earlier in the Neolithic. This is an unfortunately vague statement. The recurved bows of the Alpera archers (figs. 8b, 8c) may be compared with recurved bows depicted at the Sharon rock shelters of Ozaneare, Jabbaren, and Sefar in the Tassili n'Ajjer group (Lajoux I963). The Tassili rock shelters have been dated by radiocarbon to the fourth and third millennia B.C. (e.g. Delibrias et al. I964; I966). Perhaps the re- curved bows spread to the Sahara from Egypt; certainly, one of the Sefar anthropo- morphs holds an axe the head of which is typically Egyptian and bulbous in form. Now recurved bows were made from solid pieces of wood by the Egyptians, and a Middle Kingdom example of this type is in the Royal Scottish Museum at Edin- burgh, dating from around I,750 B.C. Such bows were probably made by the</page><page sequence="19">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 57I _~~~~~~~~~~~ ! Ii ar b FIGURE 8. Cueva de la Vieja, Alpera (Albacete).</page><page sequence="20">572 MICHAEL WALKER 4%f i, 8c FIGURE 8. Cueva de la Vieja, Alpera (Albacete). same method as they are today, that is to say by treating the ends of the piece of wood in boiling water or with steam. Bows with recurved ends made this way out of single pieces of wood are stronger than simple arcs such as the long bow, known technically as 'self bows', and have the advantage that they allow the same potential energy to be built up from the same expenditure of energy by the archer in drawing the string, whilst being less cumbersome and thus more suitable for the chase than the long self bows, and are preferred by some archers even today for these reasons. They are convenient for close range hunting of the type practised by the Levantine huntsmen according to the evidence of their art. Nevertheless, recurved bows made from single pieces of wood accumulate con- siderable internal stresses after the arrow is notched, and do not recover well from extremes of curvature (Elmer I952). There are other types of recurved bow that could possibly be those depicted in the Levantine paintings. When fuilly drawn, all assume an elliptical or parabolic simple arcuate form, and are then indistinguishable from the self bow. The other types of recurved bow include a form in which two curved, fixed, weighted, end- pieces are attached to a working arm which bears the hand-grip. The weighted end-pieces may be made of horns or of wood. Such bows were made using oryx antlers from early times in Egypt in the late pre-dynastic period and early dynastic period (Wolf I926). They have ben used in Asia up to modern times. They tend</page><page sequence="21">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 573 to be very short, and in this they differ from the longer bows depicted in Levantine paintings. The third type of recurved bow is the composite, laminated bow, which is a present-day favourite with target archers. This bow overcomes the disad- vantages of stress and recovery of shape inherent in the other forms, but appears later in prehistory, being introduced into Egypt by the Hyksos (McLeod I962). It has been proposed that the recurved bows of Levantine paintings are composite bows. Thus Jorda' (I967) gives them a date late in the first millennium B.C. on the grounds that such bows are otherwise unknown in the Peninsula until they are found portrayed on late Bronze Age stelae in the south-west (Almagro I966). In particular, the late Bronze Age and early Iberian Iron Age defended settlement site ofEl Macalon, near Nerpio (Albacete) in south-east Spain is referred to, from which the excavators found, among other exotic objects, socketed arrow-heads with pedunculated sockets that carry a small barb (Garcia Guinea &amp; San Miguel Ruiz I962). It is proposed that these indicate eastern European influences on weaponry, but the arrow-heads are not like the Scythian ones found at various sites in western Europe, and it is not possible on the strength of these finds to assume that the recurved, composite bows arrived in the Peninsula from such a source. Moreover, the site itself is exceedingly remote and inaccessible, and one might have expected to find more numerous traces of such exotic influences at better-known sites further north in the Peninsula. Furthermore, the archers at the Levantine sites near Nerpio of the Abrigo Sautuola and Solana de las Covachas are not portrayed as using other than self bows. A similar late Bronze Age and early Iberian Iron Age settlement has been excavated (Walker I97I) only a few hundred metres from the Levan- tine art site at the Fuente del Sabuco. This has not yielded traces of such influences as would have been expected on the basis ofJorda's view of the El Macalon arrow- heads. Rather, it seems to share a number of characteristics with that and other south-eastern late Bronze Age and early Iron Age sites which point, if anything, to Carthaginian influences. Moreover, the Fuente del Sabuco archers do not seem to know the recurved bows. The conclusion must be that the Levantine artists were not influenced by foreign weaponry introduced in the first half of the first millen- nium B.C., presumably because the paintings had been executed several millennia previously. Indeed, archery fluctuated in popularity at different times in antiquity (Clark I963), and the same seems true both for the shapes of bows and the shapes of arrow- points. Clark points out that recurved bows were known quite early in central Europe, being depicted on a decorated slab from a megalithic construction at G6hlitzsch on the River Saale belonging to the Corded Ware-Single Grave com- plex of cultures, and which themselves receive influences from as far afield as the Copper Age on the steppes north of the Caucasus around 2,000 B.C. It was a shape known, therefore, at periods much earlier than those of Thraco-Cimmerian and Scythian incursions. The contemporaneous presence of recurved and self bows in post-Palaeolithic and early Neolithic Spain seems to indicate no more than a diversity which might have been anticipated on the basis of the variation in arrow- points. Agricultural activities are never explicitly depicted in Levantine paintings. Indeed, the only plant portrayed is a stylised tree from which fruit appears to be falling at the cave of Dofia Clotilde (Teruel), which may be a later, schematic</page><page sequence="22">574 MICHAEL WALKER painting. A sheep has been discerned at El Mortero (Teruel) (Ortego I948; Savory I968). At El Polvorim (Castellon), a man with bows and arrows is leading or pulling a goat by a rope (Vilaseca I948). A number of sites show obscure paintings that have been interpreted as a rider on a horse (e.g. Fuente del Sabuco, El Mortero), and a man leading a horse is depicted at Boniches de la Sierra (Cuenca). Possible representations of hafted polished stone axes have been interpreted at the Barranco de los Grajos and Solana de las Covachas, but such weapons have not been dis- covered in the excavations at the former site to date. At one of the caves near Dos Aguas (Valencia), a skirted anthropomorph taking large strides carries a basket on one arm, as if sowing seed, and baskets are shown also at Raco de Molero (Castel- lon). Baskets are carried, too, by the figures climbing with ropes to obtain wild honey at the Cueva de la Arania (Valencia) (Hernandez Pacheco I924; Jorda &amp; Alcacer Grau I95 I), the only Levantine painting to depict insects apart from Cingle de Mola Remigia. Basketry, as Blanc (I964), has pointed out, may well have been known throughout the Upper and post-Palaeolithic, and was known by the early Bronze Age since baskets were found at the Cueva de los Murcielagos (Granada) (G6ngora I868). Agriculture seems to have been a peripheral activity to an econ- omy that was based on a symbiotic relationship between nomadic huntsmen and wild or partly domesticated herds of animals. On the other hand, it would be hasty to conclude that hunting art can onily be executed by artists belonging to a culture at the hunting and gathering economic level. At the Turkish Neolithic township of 9atal Hiiyiik, town-dwellers who are believed to have lived by agriculture, saw fit only to paint scenes of the hunt on the walls of their buildings in the seventh and sixth millennia B.C. The paintings show some resemblances to Levantine art, again probably due to convergence of cultural assemblages and hunting patterns in similar ecological conditions, rather than to a more direct relationship of the kind suggested by Jorda (I967). 9atal Hiiyiik may have had several thousand inhabitants, and yet hunting played a large part in the minds of the people, and perhaps in their diet, as it did right up to the Middle Ages in many parts of western Europe. Hunting pictures, indeed, are popular even in the second half of the twentieth century, although few who nowadays decorate their houses with them have ever hunted wild animals at all. Hunting by itself, therefore, does not withhold the paintings from Neolithic or Bronze Age attributions. The internal faunal evidence, and to some extent the evidence of the arrow-points, suggests that the art belongs to the post-Palaeolithic and earlier part of the Neolithic before the onset of extremely arid conditions in the second millennium that we know occurred in south-east Spain. Some paintings may be Bronze Age, however; the swords depicted at Calapata and Tivisa (Cabre I9I5; Hernandez Pacheco I92I; Breuil I935), and the Iberian inscription added to the Cogul rock shelter (Almagro I957) indicate continued interest in some rock art sites late into the first millennium B.C. Such late features are uncommon, and one must conclude that the Levantine art had passed its hey-day by the Bronze Age. The clothing of the anthropomorphs does not tell us much. Like the Upper Palaeolithic anthropomorphs at Los Casares (Guadalajara), those at many Levantine sites seem to be naked. Only where prominent genitalia are displayed can the anthropomorphs be securely sexed, however. Flax cultivation was known in Spain by the Bronze Age, and esparto grass clothing has been recovered from some sites</page><page sequence="23">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 575 also. It seems likely that sheep were reared for wool by that period, moreover. Knee-length one-piece garments are portrayed in many Levantine paintings. Some of the figures wearing such apparel have pendulous breasts and may be female. An archer at Collado del Guijarral also seems to wear a similar garment. Other archers, such as the well-known one from Els Secans (Teruel), wear short trousers (BeltraIn I954). Some figures have flowing headgear (e.g. fig. 6a), and others arm and leg bands, sometimes with streamers. It is hard to say whether particular types of clothing were confined to one or other sex from the paintings, although it is often claimed that the women wore the one-piece garments, whilst the men either wore no clothes or short trousers. One might bear in mind that in Iron Age Britain the men are known to have worn trousers, presumably also wore kilts in some areas, and are reported as going naked into battle. Nakedness in north-west Europe in cool, damp Iron Age times must have been unpleasant and uncom- fortable, yet this odd practice of the Celts must make one wary of accepting Bandi's assumption (Bandi I964) that nakedness indicates a necessarily warm climate. In any case, Upper Palaeolithic anthropomorphs are usually naked when painted in Franco-Cantabrian art, yet the conditions were presumably cold. Other arguments, such as those based on the faunal evidence given above, must be em- ployed to locate Levantine paintings in the most appropriate climatic stage. Chronological considerations The time gap between the Upper Palaeolithic and the early Neolithic in the western Mediterranean basin has narrowed in recent years. The latest dates for the end of the Upper Palaeolithic are between io,5oo and 7,500 B.C. in this region, viz. Pi-iig from Levanzo in Sicily of 9,694 ? IIO B.P. (Before Present: dates B.C. are obtained by subtracting I,950 from the B.P. date)6 from a layer containing a stone engraved with a bovid7 (Ferrara et al. I96I; Graziosi i964); M-IO23 from the Cova de Bora Gran in Gerona of 11,470 + 500 B.P. (Crane &amp; Griffin I965); and Gif-I3o from the Cueva de Santimaminne in Vizcaya, a cave from which mobiliary Upper Palaeolithic art is known (Graziosi I960), of 9,470 + 400 B.P. (Delibrias et al. i966). Such dates recall those from Taforalt in north Africa where post- Palaeolithic deposits have given the following dates: Sa-I3 of io,8oo ? 400 B.P.; Sa-I4 of I2,700 + 400 B.P.; Sa-I5 of IO,500 ? 400 B.P. (Delibrias et al. I964). Even if such late dates as Pi-iig, M-Io23, and Gif-13o are accepted for the closing phase of the European Magdalenian culture, they are still some 2,000 years too early for the Atlantic climate stage to which the Levantine art is assigned in the present article. Arguments have already been presented to the effect that it is not yet possible to relate the Levantine artistg or the post-Palaeolithic lithic assemblages to those of the Upper Palaeolithic with any degree of certainty in the absence of intermediate forms, although the affinity is stronger perhaps for the tool-kits than for the paintings. The radiocarbon dates from the Portuguese middens near Muge, whose geo- metric flint industry is comparable with that of the Cueva de la Cocina (Valencia), may have some relevance for the latter site. They are: Sa-i6 from Moita do Sebastao of 7,350 + 350 B.P. (Delibrias et al. I964); Sa-i94 from Cabeco da Amoreira of 6,oso + 300 B.P., and from the same site also are Sa-i95 of 7,030 ? 350 B.P., Sa-i96 of 5,I50 ? 300 B.P., and Sa-i97 of 6,430 ? 300 B.P. (Delibrias et al.</page><page sequence="24">576 MICHAEL WALKER I965). These are comparable with Mesolithic dates from Brittany such as Gif-221 from Hoedic of 6,575 ? 350 B.P. (Delibrias et al. I966). It will be recalled that pottery, including cardial-impressed ware, occurred in the upper levels at the Cueva de la Cocina, and not far away in the province of Alicante, cardial-impressed pottery found with polished stone axes at the lower layers of the Coveta de l'Or is dated by radiocarbon from samples KN-si of 6,I50 ? I50 B.P. and H-I754/I208 of 6,265 ? 75 B.P. (Schwabedissen &amp; Freundlich I966; Schubart &amp; Pascual I966; Schubart I965). Such dates for the late post-Palaeolithic and early Neolithic cultures in the Peninsula agree well with the climatic evidence based on the faunal interpretation of Levantine art. It is not difficult to imagine the relationship between the naturalistic and sche- matic rock art of south-east Spain, and it is possible to date some of the motifs of the latter by cross-dating, thereby indicating dates by which it may be supposed that the naturalistic style had died out. Martnmez Santa Olalla (I946) placed the schematic art in the advanced Neolithic, if not later, and this seems correct. Angular 'stick-drawings' of animals of the kind shown in the schematic paintings occur on incised pottery from the Cueva de la Cocina, although judging from the depth at which they were found in the deposits, these are possibly rather early, and on the well-known vessel from grave i5 at Los Millares (Almerla), which is now in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, as well as on the beaker pottery from Las Carol- inas near Madrid, these last two being Copper Age in date, say around 2,000 B.C. Angular cervids are found engraved on a megalithic tomb also, grave L5 at Montefrlo (Granada) (Leisner &amp; Leisner 1943). Schematic rock paintings are known at the Cueva de la Pileta (M6laga), which yielded decorated Neolithic pottery from the same chamber (Breuil et al. I9I5). However, there are also Upper Palaeolithic artistic motifs at that cave, to which Ripoll prefers to refer the schema- tic motifs (Ripoll I964a). Recently there has been found a rare piece of painted red-on-buffCopper Age pottery at a burial cave nearJummilla (Murcia) (fig. 9), that shows a rayed 'sun' motif of a kind often depicted on schematic rock paintings (e.g. plate 2). The sherd occurs with other red-on-buff painted ware decorated in solid triangles and chevrons (Molina Grande in press) similar to those from the Cueva de Montgo and Torremanzanas in Alicante, and the painted decoration on the alabaster vessel from the burial cave at Blanquizares de Lebor in Murcia. These Copper Age burial caves date to the first half of the second millennium B.C. Several of them have yielded bone phalanges on which there are engraved or painted oculus motifs like those from Collado del Guijarral and other schematic art sites. Much incised 'symbolkeramik' of the south-east Spanish Copper Age bears similar oculus and rayed 'sun' motifs. There is some overlap between the distribution of Levantine and schematic rock art. At fifty-two sites with schematic art in the Levantine zone, eighteen have naturalistic motifs also. Apart from the presence of naturalistic motifs at Las Batuecas and Garcibuey (Salamanca), and the Cueva de la Pretina (Cadiz), there are echoes of the naturalistic style in schematic art at Palomas I and Cochinos (see Breuil &amp; Burkitt I929) and Valdejunco in Portugal (Breuil I9I7). The schematic art seems to lie well away from the areas of primary Copper Age settlement in Andalusia and Portugal, and in a like manner the naturalistic Levantine art of the south-east lies away from such coastal sites of primary Neolithic settlement as the</page><page sequence="25">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 577 0 25 FIGURE 9. Painted sherd. Cueva de los Tiestos, Jumilla (Murcia). Coveta de l'Or. The distribution of lithic assemblages in the Lower Ebro region (Vallespl Perez I959) also seems to show a distribution rather different from that of the Levantine art paintings. One may speculate, and it is no more than speculation, that the development of the valleys by farmers, and the subsequent exploitation of the mineral ores of the mountains by prospectors, combined with a gradually increasing aridity of the mountains of the south-east around 2,000 B.C., led to a general westward drift of the nomadic hunting groups responsible for the rock art. Alternatively, it is possible that it was the influence of new Copper Age com- munities in the coastal regions that led to the adoption by the huntsmen in the hinterland of new symbols, more schematic in form, and thus stimulated a new burst of artistic activity in the schematic rock paintings. This is no more than speculation, however. Even more speculative are associations claimed by Ortego (I956) and Jorda (I964) between the anthropomorphs wearing knee-length garments painted in relation to bovids at some rock shelters, notably Cogul, and human-bovid ritual activities of Minoan Crete. Such representations are excessively rare in Levantine art, and where they do occur they are hardly well-organised scenes, frequently containing material extraneous to such an interpretation. The hypothesis is less than convincing, even assuming for the sake of argument that the skirted anthropo- morphs are always female, as they are at Cogul. There is a large geographical gap, and probably a large chronological gap also. Moreover, there is a long tradition of human-bovid activities in the Peninsula itself, and there is no reason to suppose that they are not indigenous. They can be traced with some certainty back to Iberian times (Blanco I96I-2; Arribas I964; Encyclopaedia Britannica I968). Attention may be drawn to the destroyed Clunia sculpture of a man with a sword (matador?) confronting a bovid (Hiibner I893). Bovid figurines go back as far as the early metallurgical settlements of Almizaraque (Almerna), and Vila Nova de Sao</page><page sequence="26">578 MICHAEL WALKER Pedro in Portugal (Blance I960). Even if one does wish to look to Minoan Crete, a far closer, if somewhat absurd, parallel to the Cretan activities may be drawn in the pega pega attack of modern Portuguese bull-fighters, and even the Cretan skirts are better paralleled in ceramic figurines made by present-day Portuguese country- folk (Feltham I965). This is, of course, irrelevant to Levantine art, but serves to point to the dangers in hastily seizing upon objects only superficially alike and drawing unwarranted parallels. There is no evidence, in any case, to suggest what the ethnographic significance of the paintings might have been, whether cultic, totemic, secular or aesthetic. Ucko &amp; Rosenfeld (I967) have given modern paral- lels for all such possible significances in modern primitive rock painters; indeed, there are even some who have no idea why they paint at all, much less what the extinct animals are that they assiduously execute. The Hadza of east Africa even go so far as to disclaim responsibility for paintings they have been known to execute. In short, the presence of cults, myths or religions in some parts of the Old World in antiquity cannot be invoked as evidence that all Old World prehistoric activi- ties not obviously connected with subsistence or survival when seen from the standpoint of 1970 A.D. are religious whenever we encounter them. To enquire about the 'meaning' of prehistoric art is to embark on a wild-goose chase, and is unproductive unless it is accompanied by qualifying those contexts within which meaning is sought. The only valid context for an archaeologist is the archaeological context, with which this article is concerned. Further ethnographic speculation cannot be resolved by archaeological methods. NOTES I thank the following for their help and assistance: Mrs R. de Meric, Professor J. D. Evans, Mr P. Morrissey, Professor Stuart Piggott, the Provost and Fellows of The Queen's College, Oxford, the Oxford University Committee for Advanced Studies, the National Geographic Society, the University of Edinburgh Travel and Research Committee, Commercial Plastics Ltd., Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., Kodak Ltd. I This series of maps is based on the Madrid meridian, and not Greenwich, and the co-ordi- nates given here refer to the Spanish meridian as published on the map sheets. 2 Care has been taken in Mrs de Meric's reproductions to copy the original colours and brush- work. The figures here shown are black and white reproductions of her work, which was executed using printing inks of different colours painted on heavy gauge polythene sheeting on which the figures were traced with blue pencil. Artistic reproductions in colour alone can give true representation of the original colours and details of prehistoric brushwork (cp. Porcar Rippolles 1943b, 1945; Thompson I960). The black and white plate, plate i, was taken with black and white infra-red Kodak film. Although this film allows considerable detail to be retained, which is lost with ordinary film, it can be seen that far more detail can be dis- tinguished by a trained artist. Moreover, the curvature and fissuring of the rock, and conditions of light and shade, confuse the interpretation of photographs. More recently, I have tried to overcome these difficulties by using infra-red colour reversal film. Daylight colour reversal film was also employed and the projected slides were used by Mrs de Meric as a check on her reproductions. However, slight variations of lighting, or of photographic exposure, can produce considerable colour distortion that is avoided by artistic reproduction. Much is of necessity lost in the accompanying black and white copies of Mrs de Meric's colour paintings. If there is a disadvantage attached to life-size, painted reproductions, it is in the arduous and time-consuming nature of the work, and the quantities of materials needed for large rock expanses. Outlying groups of figures tend to be sacrified if time and/or materials are short, and extremely indistinct figures and painted 'smudges' also present difficulties of exact copying at such a large scale of reproduction. The method is most suitable for supplementing rapid, small- scale, projected sketches, especially for complicated scenes replete with artistic detail. The same disadvantages also apply to photography, of course. 3Alternative interpretations of the Toll flora and chronology, however, are proposed respectively by Butzer &amp; Freeman (I968) and Rossello (1970). Horse and deer are common</page><page sequence="27">SPANISH LEVANTINE ROCK ART 579 at the Cueva de Volcan in Valencia, but not goat, which was, however, common at Parpallo (Davidson in press). 4 Since writing this, I am informed by Iain Davidson of Selwyn College, Cambridge, that he has identified sheep bones from an aceramic layer with end- and pyramidal scrapers beneath three layers of Neolithic with pottery excavated by Sr Javier Fortea of the University of Salamanca at the Cueva de les Mallaetes (Valencia). Mr Davidson also informs me that the sheep bones reported from the Sant Gregori site (Vilaseca I939) are not now accepted as sheep, even by the excavator. However, the possibility of sheep in pre-Neolithic Spain is a real one (see, for example, Murray 197I). 5 There is some doubt about the existence of rock art at this site. 6 The dates given are calculated on the 5,570 year half-life of CI4 and can be corrected to the more probable 5,730 value by multiplying them by 103. It must be borne in mind that dates for the fifth millennium and earlier may be up to 5oo years too low in absolute terms, possibly due to fluctuations in the terrestrial magnetic field (Bucha &amp; Neustupny I967). 7 Since writing the above, a further radiocarbon date from the next layer up at this site, with Epigravettian artefacts, has been published. As at other Epigravettian Italian sites, this is in the eleventh millennium B.C., R-566 of ii,i8o + I20 B.P. or 9,230 B.C. (Alessio et al. 1970). Doubt is therefore cast on the validity of the tenth millennium Magdalenian date. APPENDIX I Key to map (fig. I).
