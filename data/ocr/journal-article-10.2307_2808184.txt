III, No. 1 MARCH, 1928 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW of BIOLOGY THE SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS, WITH A REPORT ON THE ABILITY OF THE NOTED DOG "FELLOW" TO RESPOND TO VERBAL STIMULI BY C. J. WARDEN AND L. H. WARNER Animal Laboratory, Department of Psychology, Columbia University T HE material selected for discus- sion in this paper naturally falls into two major divisions as indicated in the title. The at- tempt is made in the first general section to present, very briefly indeed, a fairly systematic account of the more important aspects of the capacities and behavior of the dog, insofar as these have been revealed by careful observation and experimental analysis. Vastly more in- formation is at hand on the sensory capacities of the dog than on what we usually think of as general intelligence. The sections covering such capacities, especially visual, olfactory and auditory, are accordingly large while that on in- telligence is correspondingly small. The distinction here made is, of course, one of convenience only, inasmuch as general intelligence must be, in the very nature of the case, a function of sensory and other capacities. A short section treating of the special fitness of the dog to serve as a subject for extensive and intensive be- havior studies in the modern animal laboratory will follow that on intelli- gence. The second major division of the paper will consist of a fairly detailed account of certain tests, recently conducted by the writers, on the German Shepherd Dog "Fellow" -widely known on stage and screen-to determine to what extent, if any, his reputed ability to understand human language is justly warranted. Before entering upon the main discus- sion it may be not entirely out of place to remind you that the attitude of the mod- em comparative psychologist is one of healthy skepticism toward supposed cases of animal genius and human-like levels of animal intelligence. It is not that the student of animal behavior has a grudge against the infra-human kind, or any scientific or philosophical objection to a high evaluation of their abilities. For, in point of fact, no one more than the com- parative psychologist welcomes evidence tending to confirm his belief in the essen- tial continuity of all living forms on the I QUAR. REV.

He merely insists more emphatically than formaerly that evidences of this character must run the usual gauntlet of scientific criticism; that claims of this sort must first be established by the most painstak- ing and defensible scientific methodology. Much of what the average man "knows" about his own dog, and about dogs in general is, of course, quite un- known to the animal psychologist. For no animal has a richer heritage of lore, sentimental and lofty, representing an accumulation of the long ages since primi- tive man first made the dog his hunting companion and his domestic ally. It is difficult for any of us to escape entirely this traditional influence; most difficult indeed to observe with clarity of purpose and uncompromising logic the behavior of a dog, or other pet, to which we have formed an attachment. Only a few dec- ades ago, and even in certain circles now, the method of anecdote with its unfailing tendency toward anthropomorphic in- terpretation stood in high favor, and passed itself off under the guise of science. Selecting cases to bolster up a theory may be an interesting diversion but it is hardly worthy of the trained mind in any field. We have deliberately eliminated from the following discussion all anecdote and have meant to include only such observa- tional and experimental results as ap- peared to us to be worthy of the attention of the serious scientist. 1. SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE Visual capacity Consideration of the experimental lit- erature on the visual capacity of dogs indicates that the average dog has far more faulty vision than most dog-lovers suppose. Behavior evidence for this con- clusion is supported by anatomical study of the eye. Slonaker (43) reports that the dog possesses no fovea and that even the so-called "sensitive areas" are only vaguely defined. Numerous opaque nerve fibres are said to penetrate the retina, and these must be considered as blind spots. The pupillary opening is always relatively large and the pupillary response, while rather quick, is not strong. Johnson (zz) and others have demonstrated convergence. The method ordinarily used in testing the dog's eyesight has been called the discrimination method, and in most cases involves the use of the original "discrimi- nation box" designed by Yerkes and Watson (58), or some modification of this. The dog being tested is faced with a choice of two alleyways, the one leading to a compartment in which he will find food, the other to a compartment where he is usually given a light electric shock. Whether or not the dog makes a fortunate choice he is faced with this situation again and again. Sometimes the reward is to the right and the punishment to the left, sometimes just -the reverse. The only way the animal can be sure of making a correct choice is by attending to signals or cues (stimulus patches) which are presented at the entrance of the alleyways. In testing for brightness discrimination, for example, a very bright light may be placed always at the entrance of which- ever alley in that trial leads to the food, a less bright light at the other alley entrance. Many precautions must be taken to insure the fact that there are no other stimuli than the signals being studied which might give the animal a clue as to which alley to enter. Use of his nose to detect the side of the box at which he will re- ceive food will not help the dog for there is food in both compartments, though in the punishment compartment, it is screened off so as to be inaccessible. The experimenter must be entirely eliminated</page><page sequence="4">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS 3 from the situation, for the dog, more perhaps than any other animal, is quick to take advantage of the to us almost imperceptible movements that the on- looker often and quite unwittingly makes in indication of the correct direction. This method has been used in the study of brightness, size, and form discrimina- tion in the dog but not, as yet, in the study of color discrimination. Under adequate experimental conditions positive results as obtained by this method may be accepted as final, but it is to be noted that negative results cannot be considered conclusive, since it is conceivable that an animal might be capable of somewhat more delicate discriminations in a less arbitrary or complex situation. Szymanski (5i) used this general mnethod in studying brightness discrimi- nation. His dogs were a cross between a Spitz and a fox terrier. His results were entirely negative for slight differences in brightness. Only when one alley was brightly lighted and the other entirely dark was he able to get a discrimination habit. Very similar results were ob- tained by Sutherland (46) using the same method. His dogs, mongrels, discrimi- nated between a light and no light, but not between one light as opposed to two lights, or even as opposed to four lights. Form as well as brightness discrimination would have been involved in these cases of course, since the bulbs were actually in view. Stone (45), however, using a male and a female fox terrier found evidence for a much finer degree of brightness discrimi- nation. Having built up a discrimination habit for two lights differing considerably in brightness he gradually reduced the intensity of the brighter until a point was reached where the habit broke down. He then increased the difference between the two lights until the habit was reestab- lished and again gradually approached the threshold value. Stone also tested three human subjects by the same method -except, of course, that these subjects indicated by word of mouth rather than by turning to the right or left which light was in their opinion the brighter. The men could, on the average, distin- guish a light of i c.p. from i.i c.p. The male dog discriminated between a i c.p. and a i2. c.p. light, while the female dog did slightly better. The dogs were thus inferior to the men, but only slightly so. All the work on form and size discrimi- nation except that of the Russian school is in accord with the conclusion that the dog is very deficient in these respects. Johnson (2a3), using an English bull terrier, was unable to establish evidence for discrimination between vertical and horizontal lines, these lines, alternately black and white, being 3.9 mm. wide on a circular field 6 cm. in diameter. Skia- scopic examination of the dog's eyes, both with and without mydriatic, seemed to indicate that objects at a distance of twenty feet or more, i.e., at a distance such that the light rays were approximately parallel, were focussed on the retina. Nothing is known of the ability of the dog to accommodate, and thus it might have been that failure to discriminate in Johnson's case resulted from inability to focus upon objects so close to the eyes as the signals were placed. Johnson considered overcoming this difficulty by equippingthe dog with a pair of spectacles. Instead, however, he introduced a system of lenses before the signals in such a way as to throw the light reflected from them onto the dog's eyes in parallel rays. But even with all these advantages that science offered the dog did no better. It could not even distinguish between a plain field and one of black and white stripes, 3.9 mm. in width. Each of these stripes subtended a visual angle of 33' 32!' or an</page><page sequence="5">4 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY angle larger than that subtended by the sun's disc at the earth. Johnson states that this coarsely striped field is "closely comparable with that of a plank fence, the units of which are 6 inches wide and 6 inches apart, viewed at a distance of 50 feet." Most dog-lovers would refuse to believe that their pets were incapable of such a discrimination. Data on form vision have been reported by Williams (56) and by Szymanski (5i). In neither case were)-the experimental conditions so admirably controlled as in Johnson's study. Williams was unable to establish discrimination between a square and a circle of equal area, although he did find discrimination between a con- stant and an intermittent light, the latter flashing at 2. second intervals. Szymanski was unable to establish response to a white pyramid standing in bold relief against a black background. Johnson alone of American workers has studied size discrimination (2a2). His dog apparently discriminated between a circle 6 cm. in diameter and circles with diameters of i, 2., and 3 cm. respectively. The 4 and 5 cm. circles were not certainly discriminated from the 6 cm. circle. The intensity of the light transmitted through the pairs of circles used was always con- stant. Thus it was impossible to say whether the animal's success was due to size discrimination or to luminosity. To test this matter Johnson equated the 6 and the 3 cm. circles for luminosity by reducing the larger circle to 2.5 per cent of its original brightness. As a result the dog no longer discriminated, choosing now one and now the other circle. His dis- crimination had therefore been based on luminosity differences. The students of Pavlov, working in Leningrad, have reported data bearing on the sensory capacities of dogs. Unfortu- nately we are at present largely dependent on secondary source material, and thus a critical evaluation of the Russian work cannot readily be made. The method employed is quite different from that used by these other investigators, and the work still awaits verification in other laboratories. It involves the establish- ment of a conditioned salivary response to a given stimulus, as for example a black patch, by presenting this stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus, food, simul- taneously a large number of times. After this conditioning is firmly established a second stimulus to be discriminated from the conditioned stimulus (a white patch, for example) is presented. Food is never presented with the white patch, whereas the black patch is often reenforced by the simultaneous presentation of food. Such training finally results in a differential response to the white and to the black patch, each presented alone, the one causing secretion of saliva, the other inhibiting such secretion, provided, of course, the sensory capacity of the dog is such as to permit such discrimination. Not only the visual capacity of the dog, but its auditory, olfactory, thermal, tact- ual, and gustatory capacities have been studied to some extent by this method. In general it may be stated that where the results of the Russian workers and those of other investigators are not in agree- ment, the findings of the former group seem to indicate greater sensory capacity. There are at least two possible explana- tions for these discrepancies. The sali- vary response method may be a more deli- cate measure of discriminatory ability involving, as it does, a more simple learning problem. On the other hand it may very well be that, due to technical errors in the application of the method, the dogs studied by the Russian students were responding to secondary criteria. That the latter is true of much of the</page><page sequence="6">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS 5 earlier Russian work seems evident. H. M. Johnson has subjected such studies to rigorous criticism. Partly as a result of such criticism, no doubt, radical changes have more recently been made in the technique employed by Pavlov's students. Whether or not these sufficed to entirely elitninate secondary clues cannot be said with our present indirect knowledge of their procedure. They have, apparently, succeeded in eliminating the experimenter from the situation, but this has necessi- tated the introduction of complicated mechanical devices for the presentation of the stimul'i, which in themselves may conceivably offer secondary cues. It seems necessary, then, for us to present their results, largely on the basis of their report in Pavlov's recent volume, Con- ditioned Reflexes (35), with the hope that it will not be long until their experiments are known to us in greater detail and furthermore, have been verified in other laboratories. Concerning the discrimination by the dog of intensity and luminosity differences the Russian work supports the results of Stone (45) mentioned above, who found greater acuity in this respect than any other investigator excepting the Russians. Frolov (35) using the Zimmermann series of grey papers, ranging from white to black, found the dog studied to be slightly superior to human beings, whereas Stone, using a different breed of dog, found them only slightly inferior to man. With respect to the discrimination of form and size, Orbeli reports results conflicting radically with those of other workers, since they seem to indicate discrimination of a large letter T from such forms as a square, a circle and so on. The luminos- ity and size factors, however, were appar- ently uncontrolled. It seems that the work on size discrimination must be thrown out on the same grounds. Fur- thermore, Orbeli's work was done in I907 before the improved technique was introduced (57) in Leningrad. The work of Shenger-Krestovnikova (3 S) reported in I92.i cannot be criticised on the grounds of failure to control luminosity, since this investigator used figures constant in area and intensity, differing only in form. The two forms to be discriminated were a circle and an ellipse. At first an ellipse was used, the ratio of whose semi-axes was as z: i. The discrimination was apparently made. This was followed by using a series of ellipses gradually approx- imating the circle in form. The ellipse whose semi-axes bore the ratio 9: 8 proved to be the limit at which differentiation just failed. Returning to the flatter and longer ellipse, and reestablishing the discrimination for it, the threshold was again approached and with the same result. The indication is therefore for an acuity not far inferior to that of man. This conclusion is, however, not supported by any other modern work from the Pavlov laboratory so far as we know, and is, furthermore, contrary to the bulk of evidence from all other sources. Can the dog see colors or is his visual world composed of only lighter and darker shades? The general opinion of animal psychologists, in the light of tests mad-e on various forms, is that no mammal below the monkeys and apes is capable of color discrimination. No study of color vision in the dog has been made by means of the Yerkes-Watson method described above. So far as the writers are aware the latest investigation in this field is that of Smith (44) pub- lished in i9i2.. Experimentation on color-vision in dogs has been, almost without exception, of the crudest sort. Even the experimenter has not been eliminated from the situation. Prismatic colors have never been employed. Usu-</page><page sequence="7">6 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY ally light reflected from colored pieces of paper, painted food containers, colored balls, and the like has been utilized. Control of the intensity factor has never been adequate and in many cases has been quite overlooked. The results reported, and they are about equally divided for and against the existence of color vision in dogs, therefore cannot be taken seriously. Perhaps the least inadequate study making use of reflected rather than transmitted light, is that of Smith. This writer has been generally quoted as having concluded in favor of color vision (see Washburn, Animal Mind, p. i56). A careful reading of his paper shows that this does not fairly represent his position and that the data he presents certainly support no such conclusion. Although Smith is inclined to suppose that certain dogs may be able to discriminate colors to a limited extent, he emphasizes his opinion that such dis- crimination "is highly unstable and cannot be supposed to play any part in the animal's normal existence." For all practical purposes this is equivalent to a denial of color vision. This tentative conclusion is quite in agreement with the work of the Russian school, as is indicated by the following quotation from Pavlov (35, page 132 f.): "Dr. Orbeli in a first series of experiments was unable to detect any differentiation of colours on the part of his dogs. In a second series of experi- ments, however, positive results were obtained in one dog, but only with great difficulty, and even in this case the experi- ments were still open to criticism. The results obtained by other investigators, both Russian and foreign, lead to the conclusion that colour vision in dogs, if present, is only of a very rudimentary form, and that in most dogs it cannot be detected at all." It must be concluded, therefore, on the basis of laboratory tests that the dog's vision is decidedly inferior. The casual observations made at home and in the field do not conflict with this conclusion. In the every day life of the dog it is no doubt a supplementary sense, rather than the dominant sense as in man. In the laboratory it seems called into play only when the more dominant senses, the olfactory and the kinesthetic, fail to bring the animal success. The discrimination experiments already reported are examples, and there are others which even more clearly indicate the tendency of the animal to overlook visual clues in favor of those of other modalities. This conclusion applies only to still and not necessarily to moving objects. De Jong (X4), after training his dogs to open a box by lifting a latch in order to obtain food, turned the box ninety degrees, in the dog's absence. The dogs then went to the point on the box where the latch had previously been and made the movement of the paw that had formerly served to lift the latch. This of course failed to produce the desired results, but the dog nevertheless continued to attack that same point for some time, entirely overlooking the rather prominent latch, which, although at a new place, was still clearly within his visual range. Learning to open the door with the box so turned seemed to be an entirely new problem, accomplished in the usual trial and error manner. Only after the position of the box had been shifted a number of times, and relearned as often, did the dogs finally come to respond to the latch itself, and even then not necessarily on the basis of vision alone. Experiments similar to these have been made by Johnson (2o)with similar results. An even more striking demonstration of the insignificant role of eyesight is found in other of Johnson's experiments. He found that problem boxes were solved as readily by dogs temporarily deprived of</page><page sequence="8">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS 7 the use of vision as by their normal companions and, furthermore, that normal dogs worked in the dark almost as effi- ciently as in the daylight. Hamilton (I3), Buytendijk and Hage (5), and others have attempted to facilitate the solution of problems by introducing prominent visual cues, which one would expect to be of real aid to the dogs, with but little or no effect. Although there is little experimental evidence on the subject of moving versus still objects as visual stimuli, such as there is agrees with casual observations of a number of investigators to the effect that the dog is extremely sensitive to objects in motion. A preliminary study of the subject has been made in the laboratory of Pavlov, but no limits of discrimination have been determined. Interesting indication of the great sensitivity of the dog to slight movements is to be found in the several examples of the Clever Hans error-an error which is as likely to occur in the study of dogs as in the case of the famous horse after which it was named. It seems probable that the cues imperceptible to us which the animal gets from the experimenter are chiefly visual, although audition may be involved here also. In the early experiments on auditory discrimination made by Kalischer (75), Rothmann (37), Swift (47 and 48), and others it seems very probable that the dogs obtained secondary cues from the experimenter, who was always present. Swift, for example, seems to give his case away in the following statement (48): "I found at first he (the dog) was inclined to react to motion rather than sound, and watched me closely for the motion accom- panying the low tone, and would react to that." According to the conditions of the experiment the dog was allowed to take food from the experimenter's hand when this low tone was sounded. In spite of the above-quoted statement that the dog appeared at first to react to slight movements of the experimenter no effort seems to have been made to eliminate the experimenter in this case, and the writer goes on to assume the problem to have been learned on the basis of auditory cues. Johnson, studying the same problem (zo), apparently had evidence for pitch dis- crimination in the earlier part of his work, during which the experimenter was pres- ent, but when the conditions were so modified that the experimenter was en- tirely concealed the discrimination could not be made. This indicates rather con- clusively that the dog had been reacting not to sounds, but to slight movements made by the experimenter. Olfactory capacity The dog is popularly accredited with the possession of a remarkably efficient nose. It is through his superiority to man with respect to olfactory acuity that he has most frequently been of practical service to his master. He has been used to trail and retrieve game, to find lost articles and people, to detect fleeing and hiding fugitives from justice. Very little strictly laboratory work on the subject has been reported. None such has ap- peared from laboratories in this country. No doubt the chief reason for the paucity of work on olfaction, not only in dogs but in almost all animal forms, lies in the rec- ognition by investigators of the great difficulty of controlling the stimuli in question. An instance of the dog's olfactory acuity and, incidentally, an illustration of the difficulty of animal experimentation, is to be found in an early study of Johnson's (zz). This careful investigator, while studying visual acuity in an English bull terrier, obtained such a fine degree of visual discrimination as to render him</page><page sequence="9">8 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY incredulous. One by one he checked over the possible secondary criteria which might be giving the animal the clue for its choices. He was using an electric grid to punish wrong choices (in addition to a food reward), and it occurred to him that the animal might in some way be able to detect which of the two grids was elec- trified in a given trial. He therefore ran a control series with both grids electrified, cutting off the current on the side of cor- rect choice only after the choice was made. The habit broke down immediately, the animal now responding quite by chance to the right or left side. It seemed that the difference in potential between the charged electrodes had caused a release of ozone, in minute quantities, but evidently sufficient to be the basis of the discrimi- nating behavior. The first question we should try to answer relates to the kinds of odors to which dogs will respond. Binet and Passy (X) claim that dogs respond to animal odors but not to odors arising from vegetable matter. Heitzenroeder (I5) using a Spitz obtained evidence leading him to the conclusion that the threshold for odorous mixtures of animal origin was far lower in the dog than in man but that the threshold for odors of plants and perfume was lower in man than in the dog. His method was that of introducing the air carrying the odor by means of a funnel- like arrangement over the dog's nose and taking as indication of sensitivity a sniffing movement or change in the breath- ing rate. That lack of such overt response would indicate lack of sensitivity is to be seriously doubted. Seifrin (39) used Heitzenroeder's method and reached simi- lar conclusions. Henning (i6) recognizes three possible explanations: (i) the olfac- tory continuum shows prominent gaps or breaks; (z) all odors are sensed, but some types have a disproportionately high threshold; (3) such motor responses as sniffing are given, normally, only to biologically important odors. Henning apparently felt that the last possibility was most likely the true one, for in his study he used a different form of response. Henning's principal method involved the use of nine handkerchiefs scattered on the floor of an empty room. One of these was saturated with a definite odor. In an adjoining room the dog was given the opportunity of smelling the odor in question and was then sent into the test room to retrieve the scented handkerchief. The position of this handkerchief was varied from trial to trial. A Dobermann and a fox terrier are said to have retrieved without error the correct handkerchief when the following odors were used in intensities equalling the human threshold (subjectively determined): vanillin, helio- tropin, cumarin, oil of rose, oil of geran- ium, jasmine, oil of lemon, peppermint, wintergreen, and others. A greyhound could not be trained to do this. This test gave no evidence of discriminatory ability but only of sensitivity, since only one odor was used at a time. Further tests of a rather informal nature indicated that the dogs could discriminate between food odors and flower odors. Buytendijk (4) presents data not only on the lower threshold but on discrimina- tory ability. He employed two methods, principally. In the first of these, two boxes were used, exactly similar and each containing a biscuit. The lid of one was fastened shut, while that of the other could be opened. A small vessel contain- ing a chemical, diluted in paraffin or water, stood before each box, and it was supposedly only by detecting the odors that the dog could tell which box was unlocked. Buytendijk apparently did not take care to eliminate the experimenter from the situation, and we cannot be sure</page><page sequence="10">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS 9 that the animal was not responding to some cue from himself. The results reported seem to indicate that the smells of nitro-benzol and benzaldehyd, which man cannot distinguish, are also confused by the dog. On the other hand, o.oi per cent nitro-benzol was analyzed out of a mixture of o.I per cent each of eugenal, ionon, linalool, and zimtaldehyd. A number of other mixtures were also suc- cessfully analyzed. As to absolute thresh- holds, vinegar was distinguished in a dilution of i: ion, salt and vinegar acids in dilutions of I: Io5, salt and quinine in dilutions of I: 04. Buytendijk's second method made use of glass dishes which contained the odorous substances each held in a sort of basket with a handle permitting the dog to pick them up singly and retrieve them. The procedure was essentially that used by Henning with the handkerchiefs, except that but three re- ceptacles were used at a time. Solutions of formic and of sulphuric acid containing one part in ten million were correctly responded to, as were also extremely dilute solutions of a number of other acids. All such solutions were said to be quite odor- less to man. Here again there exists the possibility that the dog reacted to cues given by the experimenter. To what practical use can the dog put his olfactory ability? In the first place it is so generally accepted that certain dogs are able to follow the trails of other animals that special tests of this ability have apparently seemed unnecessary. This does not mean, however, that a dog can distinguish between the trail of animal x and animal y of the same species nor, perhaps, that he can distinguish between the trails of individuals of closely related species, although most hunters will say that dogs readily do so. Bingham (3) reports that a setter who normally pointed birds very skillfully had on occasions followed trails which proved to have been made by turtles, and he states that other cases of this sort have been brought to his attention. It seems probable that olfactory reception is dominantly if not solely responsible for much trailing be- havior. That trails are followed more readily when they have been recently made is doubtless due to the fact that the odor- ous particles, emanating most probably from the footprint of the trailed animal, diffuse rapidly and finally reach a degree of dilution such as to render them below the lower threshold of the dog. Tests made by Buytendijk on a German Shep- herd dog (4) indicate, among other things, the effect of wind on the trail. When following a trail leading straight into the wind, or when following a trail behind an obstruction which cut off the wind the dog followed almost exactly the steps of the man being trailed. But when the trail crossed open country at right angles to the wind the dog did not follow exactly the path of the man but ran along rather uniformly from one to two meters or more to the leeward of this path. Although Romanes' tests of the sense of smell in his female setter (36) have fre- quently been referred to, certain interest- ing details have been overlooked. It will be remembered that this animal could trail Romanes successfully even though a number of people were made to walk single file behind him in such a way as apparently to obliterate his trail. By appropriate tests Romanes found that the dog would not follow his trail when he was barefoot, in stocking feet, or wearing a pair of new boots, that the dog would follow the trail of a stranger only if that stranger wore a pair of Romanes' old boots. It was apparently the old boots which were being trailed. Romanes then proceeded to paste heavy brown paper en-</page><page sequence="11">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY tirely over his boots, soles and all. The dog was unable to trail him when he wore his boots so covered. After walking some distance a small bit of the paper wore off the heel of one of the boots. When the dog, which had been led along the trail far behind in the meantime, reached the point where the heel had worn through and was thus making contact with the ground it picked up the trail at once and soon caught up with Romanes. This little incident hints at the extreme deli- cacy of the stimulus which is apparently effective in trailing behavior. A charac- teristic of trailing which has never been adequately explained, as Johnson has pointed out (Q.i), is that a dog when coming upon a trail at right angles seems able to detect almost at once the direction taken by the animal or man making the trail. It seems impossible to imagine what the cue can be to such behavior. Romanes' dog could apparently dis- criminate by odor his boots from other boots. A more thoroughgoing test of the ability of a dog to select objects be- longing to a specific individual has re- cently been made by Lohner (X8). In this case not trailing, but retrieving was the behavior employed to demonstrate the ability to distinguish between the odor traces left by various individuals. But one subject, a two year old female German Shepherd dog, was used, and in every case the object to be retrieved was one which had been handled by her keeper. The objects in question were small pieces of pine wood. One of these was just held in the keeper's hand, and then placed, with forceps, with ten to twenty other pieces which had not been so handled. The dog was allowed to sniff her keeper's hand and was then told to get his piece of wood. She was successful in every case. An attempt was made to discover to what extent it was necessaryto handle the pieces. Apparently the shortest duration neces- sary to their identification was 2. seconds and the smallest surface was that touched by the finger tip. Washing the hands of the keeper in alcohol before touching the wood did not interfere with the identi- fication. Even though four or five pieces of wood handled by others than her keeper were introduced amnpng the dummy pieces, the dog appeared able to select her keeper's piece. At no time was the dog asked to retrieve pieces held by anyone but her keeper. Apparently these ex- periments were conducted extremely care- fully, but, unfortunately, it is not stated whether or not the keeper, or other observers with knowledge of the correct object, were within the visual range of the dog during the selection. If this was the case (and mention would probably have been made of it were it not) the results could scarcely be accepted. It may be, however, that a dog is cap- able not only of following human and animal trails but of selecting objects which belong to, or have been handled by its master. Whether this ability to identify the odor traces of an individual person extends to other than the dog's own mas- ter has not been established. Nor has it been proven that, upon being given the hat or some other article belonging to a stranger, the dog can select that stranger from among a group of persons. In spite of the fact that the dog's ability along these lines is not definitely known, evi- dence which depends directly upon such ability is admitted by the courts of many states of this country and also in certain foreign lands. Much more of the validity of such evidence should be known if convictions are to be made on the basis thereof. Realizing this, certain German police officials, notably Police Lieutenant K. Most, with the cooperation of Pro- fessor Pfungst conducted a series of tests a</page><page sequence="12">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS II few years ago, in Berlin. These are reported by Craig (7), who, however, fails to give the original reference. The tests were open not only to police dogs but to all comers, and retests were per- mitted after failures when so desired. A number of prize winning dogs of various breeds were entered and tested individu- ally. Four types of test were given. The first involved the following of a fresh human trail among other recently made trails. No dog proved able to do this reliably, although most were able to follow a fresh trail over older trails. Among fresh trails the dogs often switched from one to another, the angles of inter- section seeming to play a prominent part in determining which trail was to be followed. The tendency was for the dog to follow any fresh trail extending in the same general direction taken by the trail he had just been following, i.e. if the trail he was following in a northerly direction turned abruptly east, at a point where it intersected a second fresh trail which from that point extended northerly, the dog usually followed the second trail. The second test involved the following of an old trail over ground entirely free from other trails. Twenty tests over trails from 521 to 6- hours old resulted in absolute failure. Trails were followed well only when not more than 30 minutes old. The third test involved the selection from a group of objects of the one pre- viously handled by a person who had been pointed out to the dog. In other words, this corresponds to L6hner's experiment except that other individuals than the dog's master were used. In no case did a dog make a correct choice more often than he might have by chance. The last test was the converse of the previous one. The dog was given the glove of a person and told to select the owner, who, together with nine other men, stood in line with their backs to the dog. In no case did the men know whose glove had been given the dog to smell. This precaution prevented the "guilty" man from revealing his identity in any way. The dogs all failed in this test as completely as in the previous ones. The conclusions drawn were that those cases of successful detection of criminals by dogs (as demonstrated by subsequent confessions) were probably made on the basis of slight movements of the criminal resulting from his fear of being detected. Those cases where a dog had apparently trailed a criminal to his lair were inter- preted as examples of the Clever Hans error. It was supposed that the police sergeant holding the leash on which the dog was led while trailing often had a sagacious guess as to the probable hiding place of the criminal and, all unwittingly, led the dog to that place, rather than being led by the dog, In other words it was a case similar to the "muscle-reading" by which so-called mind-readers often successfully entertain parlor audiences. As a result of such tests, so Craig reports, the use of dogs in criminal detection is now forbidden bythe Prussian government. How are we to interpret these results? It seems to the writers that these negative results cannot be taken as definitely proving a lower degree of olfactory acuity in dogs than had previously been granted them. It is more probable, in view of the other evidence in favor of extraordinary acuity, that these tests indicate that the problems were not properly set for the dogs. To use, for the sake of simplicity, an anthropomorphic term, we have no evidence that the dogs understood what was expected of them. Negative conclu- sions are always difficult to support, and they are certainly not justified in the absence of evidence that the problem at</page><page sequence="13">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY hand has been adequately set and that sufficient motivation has been brought to bear upon its solution. We are not at all inclined to belittle the dog's olfactory acuity and feel that the bulk of the evidence shows it to be far superior to our own. Auditory capacity Experimental evidence on hearing in dogs appears to indicate that they are at least as sensitive as man in this respect, while their capacity for auditory discrim- ination is less certainly known. Only one study of intensity discrimi- nation has been made, that by Tihomirov, a student of Pavlov. He used an organ pipe with an arrangement for damping the sound as desired. The results seem too good to be true and are perhaps best covered by quoting from Pavlov (35, p. I35):" . . . it was found that an intensity very closely approaching the one employed as a positive conditioned stimulus could be differentiated by the dog with an absolute precision even when a pause of 17 hours was made between the two stimuli. The experimenter found himself able to detect a difference between these two intensities of the sound only when they succeeded each other immedi- ately. . . . In the continuation of these experiments the intensity of the inhibitory tone was brought still nearer to the in- tensity used for the positive conditioned stimulus, and an absolute differentiation was obtained even after a pause of 'three hours between the stimuli. Unfortu- nately these experiments were conducted in our old laboratory where the effect of the inhibitory stimulus was easily dis- turbed, and it must be left to the future to repeat these experiments under more perfect conditions in our new laboratory." The bulk of the experiments on pitch discrimination leave much to be desired in the way of technique. The experimenter has usually been present, and pure tones have seldom if ever been used. All in- vestigators but Johnson have found some degree of pitch discrimination. Johnson's work was inspired by reports of some of the earlier work done in Pavlov's labora- tory (by Selionyi and by Beliakov) in which it was claimed that dogs could discriminate differences of one quarter and even one eighth of a tone. Johnson justly criticizes this work in the article reporting his own results (2o). He used the Yerkes-Watson discrimination appa- ratus employing both punishment and reward. The experimenter was elimi- nated. The sounds were produced by electrically driven tuning forks. To one note the dog was required to turn to the right to be rewarded, to the other he was required to turn to the left. Although the dogs were given a prolonged training series there was no evidence that they could learn to make the discrimination. Pavlov set Anrep on the problem of re- peating the earlier work of Selionyi, which had not been accepted by American investigators. Anrep (i) criticizes John- son's work on two grounds. The first criticism is methodological. It is his opinion that the problem as set by John- son is far too complicated. The animal is rewarded for both sounds, although at different places and, similarly, when it makes a wrong choice it is punished while both sounds are being given. We are forced to agree that the Pavlov method presents the animal with a far simpler learning problem. The one note is con- tinually reenforced by food, the other note is never so reenforced. Anrep's second criticism relates to the production of the tones, it being his claim that it is impossible to eliminate entirely the noise of the '"make and break" when using electrically driven</page><page sequence="14">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS I3 tuning forks. Anrep used electric reso- nances and a synchronous motor, driven by alternatin'g current producing, sup- posedly, a sinusoidal curve. As a sound generator in the experimental room a pair of telephones was used. These were placed close together, each attuned to the pitch which it was to transmit. Anrep reports discrimination in the case of one dog of two notes differing but slightlyin pitch, the one 637.5 d.v. and the other 68o. d.v. The controversy regarding pitch dis- crimination in the dog can only be settled by further work. The only data on the upper limit of the auditory range in the dog come from the Leningrad laboratory (Bourmakin, Andreev). These indicate a sensitivity to sounds far above the highest note audible to man, or up to IOO,OOO d.v. Other work by Pavlov's students indicates remarkable discriminatory ability for notes alike in pitch but differing in timbre or tone color, and also extreme sensitivity to differences in the periodicity of the beating of a metronome. That the dog is able to localize the source of sounds with reasonable accuracy has been demonstrated by Johnson (wo) although he did not study the limits of their sensitivity in this respect. Regarding the ability of the dog to respond to the human voice there is a wealth of anecdote but a paucity of experimentation. There is, of course, no question but that they can hear spoken words, but as to the number of spoken words that can be discriminated by a given trained dog there is very little evidence. It has been proven in the case of certain dogs who have been supposed to give differential response to a large number of words that they were merely following a routine, that if the commands were given in an altered order the dog would respond as though the original order had been repeated. Don, the talk- ing dog, is the classic example of response to routine (i9). A bull terrier, Jasper by name, was claimed by its owner to have an understanding of several hundred words. No thoroughgoing tests were made of the dog, but Watson was in- clined, as a result of observations of his behavior, to consider such a claim far too extravagant. (5 5, page 3 I 5). Edinger (g) trained a female Shepherd dog to respond appropriately to a number of simple commands. She could turn the knob of a door and open it. She could also close doors but often confused the two responses, turning the knob of an open door, and so on. If she was told to close a door which was swung open away from her she was quite helpless, not making the response obvious to us of going around behind the door and pushing it shut. Edinger believes that the re- sponses were not given to the spoken commands as words, since nonsense words served just as well if corresponding in- flections were maintained. Schiche (4o), on the other hand, believes dogs to be capable of a rather fine degree of discrim- ination of consonants. He trained police dogs to sit at the command of "Setz" and to lie down at the command, "Platz." To such similarly sounding syllables as "seck," "retz," "petz," and "ketz" the dogs did not react. We judge, however, that the experimenter was always present. Perhaps the dog for whom the most astounding performances have been claimed is the Airedale, Rolf, often re- ferred to as the dog of Mannheim (Q7, 30). This dog was usually present during the daily lessons of some young children. One day while chastizing the children for failing on some simple arithmetical problem the tutor remarked that the problem was so simple that even Rolf</page><page sequence="15">X4 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY could solve it. Thereupon Rolf proved himself worthy of such opinion by tapping out the proper answer with his paw. This led to a systematic education of the dog involving not merely the simpler arithmetical problems but also square roots and so on. The dog also learned to spell, using taps of the paw to represent letters. It is said that at the suggestion of his mistress he manufactured his own alphabetical system, and it is claimed by his proud owners that, apparently in the interests of efficiency, this system involved the fewest number of taps for those letters which are ordinarily used most frequently. It is difficult to evaluate the so-called tests made of this dog because of their uncritical nature. Every opportunity was given for the operation of the Clever Hans error. Only one incident reported cannot readily be explained on that basis. In this case the cards, on which the problem given the dog was presented, were shuffled by the observers and shown the dog at ran- dom and without any of the observers knowing just which card had been presented, and thus what reply to expect. Unfortunately these conditions were not maintained often enough to yield results of statistical validity. The attention of Claparede, one of the scientists to test the horses of Elberfeld, was called to the dog, and he planned to subject him to critical tests. Probably the most brilliant thing Rolf ever did was to be taken sud- denly ill soon after Professor Clapar6de's arrival. Other modalities Of the other sensory modalities little can be said, since there are at present no data upon which we might base an esti- mate of sensitivity and threshold values. That kinesthetic stimulation is highly important has already been suggested in connection with our consideration of the r6le of vision. It apparently domi- nates visual stimulation in determining the behavior of the dog under ordinary conditions. Beyond the fact that dog and man are sensitive to the same general types of tactual, thermal, gustatory, and electric stimuli little is known. To sum- marize: it seems probable that the average dog is far more sensitive to odors than is man; that he is not strikingly unlike man with respect to sensitivity to sounds; that his vision for still objects is decidedly inferior to that of man, while his acuity with respect to moving objects is great, although there is not sufficient data to warrant a comparison with man in this respect. Learning ability The learning ability of dogs has been tested by means of the usual laboratory methods. Dogs have been used by Thorn- dike (53), Johnson (zo), and others on the problem box, by Szymanski (49) in the maze, by Hamilton (I4) in a quadruple choice device, by Hunter (i8) and by Wal- ton (54) on the delayed reaction set-up and by Shepherd (4I) in situations involving the pulling of a string to draw food into their reach. Apparently they have yet to be tested by the Yerkes multiple choice method. One gets a clearer impression of the dog's learning ability not by perusal of the quantitative results but by a comparison of these results with those obtained on other animals. Without going into detail it may be said that as tested on such devices the dog appears to be superior to the cat, slightly inferior, perhaps, to the raccoon, and probably inferior to monkeys and apes. This last conclusion is, however, based only upon tests which are much more suited to the motor equipment of the monkeys and apes. Even though a dog and a monkey might be equal in intelli-</page><page sequence="16">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS gence we should expect the latter to be more adept in the manipulation of knobs, sticks, strings, and the like, because of his well developed hand. Perhaps if monkeys and dogs were tested on a similar maze, where the responses involve only loco- motion, the standing of the two forms would be reversed. We have no way of knowing, however, for this has not been done. Similarly, the only demonstration of the raccoon's superiority to the dog has been on a problem box involving man- ual manipulation. The raccoon's fore- paw is modified so as to be fairly efficient in grasping articles. The dog's paw is, of course, ill suited for such uses and, as a matter of fact, a dog often prefers to use his mouth. Dogs have shown very little ability to imitate each other or man, but this lack does not place them below other animals, since experimentation has shown that true imitation is rarely found in any animal form, even among the higher apes. A few words on the dog as a psychologi- cal subject may not be out of place. As is well known the rodents are represented in behavior studies by the white rat. The selection of a single representative species upon which all experimenters interested in the lower mammals should do systematic work is, of course, a great advantage, since it renders possible the collation and comparison of a vast amount of data. If some workers used squirrels, others guinea-pigs, others weasels and so on, this valuable intercomparison would scarcely be possible. Among the Car- nivora there has not been such a definite concentration upon a single form, al- though the dog has been the chief object of study. There are a number of reasons why the dog would seem to be the logical animal to represent this group. In the first place more is already known of his sensory and learning capacities than of those of the cat, the raccoon, the porcu- pine, or any of the other animals of this group which have been subjected to experimentation. In the second place less interference by emotional disturbancc is encountered in the case of the dog than in animals not so able to adapt themselves to the necessary experimental situation. That the emotional status of the animal during testing is highly important and should be kept as constant as possible does not seem to be sufficiently recognized. This is especially true of the higher, morc complex forms. We cannot blame pio- neers for having tested animals under conditions rendering them more or less frantic with hunger and fear. But it seems surprising that such a recent worker as Williams (56) should take seriously his negative results on form discrimination in dogs when his subjects were, judging from his descriptions, highly nervous and fearful during the tests. To quote: "' . ... a dog occasionally develops the obsession that he can not get out of the blind alley and stands yelping, en- during for a time the punishment (electric shock). In such a situation it may be necessary to move up the secondary coil thus making the electric current stronger till it is of sufficient intensity to overcome the obsession and force the dog to become more diligent in search of a way out." Williams used punishment only. To quote again: "With the method of pun- ishment by electric shocks, little time need be wasted, if all parts of the apparatus are in good working order, as the animal can be forced by the shocks to move to any part of the apparatus at the will of the operator." No doubt such an investi- gator would consider it a waste of time to become sufficiently en rapport with the dog to permit the use of the normally strong desire of a dog to please his master as motivation.</page><page sequence="17">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY This brings us to the third qualification of the dog which renders it capable of becoming an ideal laboratory subject. The dog is unquestionably more sensitive to the whims of a man who has won his confidence than is any other carnivore, or perhaps any other infra-human animal, for that matter. The cat, for example, is scarcely at all dominated by man, except in his role as provider. Thus starving or using some such punishment as electric shock is practically necessary to produce sufficient motivation to insure their attacking laboratory problems. Even in monkeys and apes the problem of motivation is a difficult one if we may judge from reports in the literature. The dog has continually demonstrated his ability to adapt himself readily to the wide variety of conditions which man has imposed upon him. He has cooper- ated with man in war and in peace, in the forests, in pastures, and in the city. Nor has he failed to cooperate even in the psychological laboratory except when no effort has been made to deal with him in a manner befitting his high degree of com- plexity and sensitivity. Many examples might be given to show his willingness to play his part in experimental situations in the absence of harsh forms of motiva- tion. The dogs used in the Leningrad laboratory are said to jump up onto the experimental tables without command and to lift up their feet one at a time to permit the adjustment of the necessary hamess. An early study of Hamilton's on a young bull terrier (I4) gives an ad- mirable instance of adjustment to an experimental situation. The problem pre- sented to the dog was an extremely difficult one, that of releasing himself from a box by the manipulation of a system of pedals. This dog worked daily on the problem over a period of many weeks with, apparently, unflagging zeal even though no punishment was used and the reward consisted not of food but only of petting and a few kind words. It seems only reasonable to suppose that an animal working under natural and un- disturbing conditions would be more nearly capable of giving a performance record, whether of discrimination or of learning, that would represent its maxi- mum capacity than would an animal working under the stress of punishment or too severe hunger. The dog is one of the few animals which will work without such motivation. One of the reasons for the discrepancies that exist among experimenters on the dog's capacities is no doubt the fact that all sizes and sorts of dogs have been used from highly bred bull terriers to an assort- ment of mongrels. It would no doubt be well to settle upon a representative breed for systematic experimentation, but the writers are at present in no position to make a definite proposal as to which of the many breeds is best suited to the purpose. II. RECENT TESTS OF THE ABILITY OP FELLOW TO RESPOND TO VERBAL STIMULI (OR TO UNDERSTAND HUMAN LANGUAGE) Fellow is a thoroughbred German Shepherd male, between 4 and 5 years of age, with a long line of famous blooded ancestry behind him, and owned by Mr. Jacob Herbert of Detroit, Michigan. Mr. Herbert has made a hobby of fine dogs for years and selected Fellow from among scores that he has bred, and sought to teach him in various ways to understand human language in the sense of responding in the appropriate manner to commands. This type of training is, of course, not especially new. The verbal cue has been often employed in professionally trained animals, and everyone has taught his dog to do, upon proper command, a few tricks at least. But Fellow, as Mr. Herbert</page><page sequence="18">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS explains, has been talked to constantly almost from birth in much the same manner as a young child during the years of taking on language, and it was this fact of the extensiveness of such experience and its possible effect upon the dog that made his case particularly interesting. Mr. Herbert believes that Fellow has picked up from this long contact with mankind some four hundred or more words, and that he understands these words in much the same manner as a child under the same circumstances would. By the term "understanding" Mr. Herbert seems to mean no more than that definite associations have been formed between specific words on the one hand and specific objects, places or acts on the other. As a layman he has no opinion to offer re- garding any so-called mental or subjective content of the dog's mind in connection with these words, claiming only that the words operate in some manner as the essential signals in determining the dog's behavior. From conversation with him we gather that he doubts the ability of the dog to recall the words voluntarily, in a manner supposedly characteristic of human thought processes, and thinks of the dog as being capable of merely recognizing or identifying the object, place, or act when the word is spoken in the presence of the corresponding thing or event. He does not consider the facts in the case to offer any positive evidence of reasoning in the more technical sense. Our personal acquaintance with both the dog and his owner began on September 29 last when we went to the Pasadena Hotel, New York City, at the request of Mr. Herbert to witness the performance of Fellow and to make such tests as we might see fit. Mr. Herbert was anxious to have his opinion of the dog's ability checked up by psychologists. Aside from the matter of responding to words, no special claims were made for the dog. As his master explained, Fellow was not a trick dog-had not been trained to perform any unusual stunts. He had quite successfully played, indeed, the usual roles allotted to his species in movie-melodrama-those of protecting the helpless and saving the drowning child, had starred in "Chief of the Pack" and other animal cinemas, but no special effort had been made to develop in him unusual motor performance. His claim to special attention lay in his accom- plishment of responding to a large number of human words in some sense or other, and the problem before us was to deter- mine in precisely what sense. Mr. Herbert recognized the possibility of error in a layman's opinion regarding the ability of Fellow along linguistic lines and received us in a questioning rather than an argumentative mood. From the first he showed every willingness to cooperate with us in an honest effort to discover the facts in the case. In truth, Mr. Herbert deserves great credit for the straightforward attitude which he has maintained throughout the tests, regardless of their effect on his own per- sonal opinions concerning the ability of his companion and friend. He has not sought to explain away failure in certain cases by insisting that the tests were unfair, the dog indisposed or tired, or by any of the escape mechanisms often employed by professional trainers to preserve the reputation of their protege, or their own personal illusions of special or mysterious genius. That the owner of the dog was thus able to enter into the scientific spirit of the enterprise and give us a free rein in testing the dog had much to do with whatever success has attended our efforts. Our first examination of Fellow was strictly private, only one person being</page><page sequence="19">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY present in addition to Mr. Herbert and the writers. We watched the dog per- form for half an hour or so-remarkably well it seemed to us in spite of our chronic skeptical attitude. We noted that no attempt was made by the owner to use identical phrases in the commands cover- ing the same preformance, nor was any set order followed in the performances. The commands were given in a natural conversational tone as if the owner were holding a conversation with the dog. We were quite convinced before the examina- tion was over that the performance of the dog was far above the level of routine so characteristic of the usual animal trained for purposes of exhibition. Even when we, ourselves, determined the order of the commands in a hit and miss manner the performance was perfect. Our opinion that the different acts were quite isolated from one another and involved no element of routine whatsoever has been fully borne out by all later tests. The problem as to the nature of the stimulus cues determining the responses of the dog could not, of course, be so easily disposed of. The first point to settle was whether the essential stimuli were actually auditory or not. For after all the dog might be depending upon unintentional gesture, or other visual cue so long as he performed always in the presence of his master. The possibility of the "Clever Hans" error must be effectually ruled out in view of the fact that Johnson (zo) had found it to be a complicating factor in his work on audi- tory sensitivity in dogs. Certain pitch discrimination habits, or what seemed to be such, broke down entirely when the experimenter absented himself from the room during the experiment. In the absence of a screen, Mr. Herbert was stationed in the bathroom of the suite and gave his commands through the closed door while the writers remained in the room with the dog to observe and to give the necessary signals for the successive commands. We were very careful not to aid Fellow in any way by movements of body, head or eye. Although not perfect, the dog's performance was on the whole quite satisfactory, and especially so in view of the fact that the arrangement of having the master absent was entirely new, and the commands were noticeably less audible. It was evident that visual cues from Mr. Herbert were quite un- necessary to successful response in many cases at least, the essential stimuli being auditory in character. It would have been desirable to run a series of control tests to determine more precisely the nature of the auditory cues and particularly what, if any,&lt; language elements were involved. We were handi- capped at this point, however, by the fact that Fellow is a one-man dog and has been trained not to respond to the com- mands of others than his master. Such training is perhaps necessary if an animal is to play his part well on the stage or in a cinema r6le. It was impossible to carry out our original intention, therefore, of making systematic tests in which the commands should be given by other per- sons with varying pitch and different intonation. We had thought of introduc- ing a woman's voice in this connection. We did find that Fellow woulld obey the commands of persons with whom he has been associated for some time, after getting a nod of approval from his master. Furthermore, Mr. Herbert varied his own voice in pitch, intensity and intonation- sometimes giving the commands in a monotone-without disturbing the dog's performance. It was evident that the dog has associ- ated certain sounds, of the human, verbal pattern type, with definite responses, but</page><page sequence="20">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS was this equivalent to understanding words in the human sense? The question as to whether a spoken word is a true language element, or merely an auditory stimulation of the non-language type, is after all a highly technical one, and de- pends in the last analysis upon an accept- able definition of an elementary language element. So far as the present writers know a satisfactory distinction on this point has not as yet been made. If we define too strictly, many responses of the human that we ordinarily think of as language are probably not really such, whereas a broader definition of the term might easily overthrow the distinction entirely. Perhaps we are here faced with the usual difficulty of scientific classifica- tion, where genuinely discrete elements are not involved but only differences in degree. May it not be that here as in most cases we have not distinct classes of stimuli-language vs. non-language- but a graded series of stimulus situations in which the application of arbitrary classificatory criteria is almost worthless, if not absolutely misleading? The prob- lem is not strictly confined, moreover, to studies of auditory responses in infra- human forms. In the human infant and young child it bobs up again and again to disturb the human psychologist. A genetic account of the development of language in the child would undoubtedly throw much light on our own problem. Perhaps it would be found that in this case words are responded to at first as purely auditory stimuli, and as develop- ment proceeds these sounds take on more and more of the attributes which we have come to associate in our thinking with language in the more exact sense. As a result of the completion of this first examination of the dog we issued the following statement to the press in order to avoid the usual scandal of newspaper accounts. That we were not able wholly to escape will be seen when this statement is compared with the headlines that have appeared both at home and abroad in connection with the test. We have just completed a test of an hour and a half on "Fellow," the famous movie-actor dog and it is a most remarkable dog in many respects. It is certain that the dog obeys commands given by the human voice with remarkable speed and facility. The commands do not need to be given in any set order as the dog has been taught so well that a routine line of command and performance is not at all necessary. This is the more surprising in view of the fact that no punishment has been used in training the animal-he has been given much the same treatment by Mr. Herbert as one would give a child. One point is definitely settled-the dog does not require gesture in addition to the human voice, at lcast in many of its performances. Mr. Herbert gave commands from an adjoining room with the door closed, and with no one but total strangers in the room with the dog. The animal would go to the window, go into another room and do various things, pick out objects from among several, etc., when the commands were given from the room in which Mr. Herbert was concealed. One point remains to be settled, if indeed it can be settlcd at the present state of our knowledge of animal behavior. That is, does the dog understand words in the human sense? This is a difficult point to settle inasmuch as it is possible for an animal to obey com- mands to words, not as words but as sounds. Such tests as were made, that of changing the tone in which the commands were given and of giving confusion commands still leave the matter in doubt. Personally wc arc of the opinion that the dog has learned to associate certain sounds, rather than words in the human sense, with the proper objects and commands. However, the large number of associations clearly mark the dog as most extra- ordinary. (Signed) PROFESSOR C. J. WARDEN AND DR. L. H. WARNER. It will be noted that the statement is in general conservative and contains no comparison whatsoever between the intel- ligence of Fellow and that of a child. Such comparisons are manifestly absurd since a common rating scale, or test applicable to both has not yet been de-</page><page sequence="21">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY vised, if indeed it ever can be. The news- paper headliner to the effect that we had found the dog equal in intelligence to a child of six or eight years of age must have been invented by the printer's devil. Or perhaps it originated from a dullard's confusion in connection with a statement once made by Mr. Herbert that the dog understood as many words as a child of this age. The newspaper publicity began when Mr. Herbert came out to Columbia, at our request, to make a demonstration performance (not a test) before a class of graduate students in comparative psychol- ogy. The press got wind of this demon- stration and attended in a body, and the next day five of the principal producers of movie news reels were on hand with their usual irresistible insistence. Although Mr. Herbert and Fellow were very busy a short series of tests to be carried out in the psychological laboratory at Col- umbia was arranged. It seemed desirable to repeat the test designed to rule out the possibility of visual cues, under better controlled conditions (that is, with no one at all present during performance) and to secure data regarding the total number of words to which the dog would thus respond. Furthermore, we wished to test the ability of the dog to identify and retrieve a given object from among several upon command. The usual stage per- formance of Fellow is from zo to 30 minutes whereas our test periods ranged from one to two hours, since we wished to secure as much data as possible at such times as the dog could be placed at our disposal. The use of long test periods was unfortunate inasmuch as Fellow often gave every indication of being weary of his task before the end of the longer periods, although continuing to work when duly encouraged by his master. Aside from the word "Shame" or "That's no good," spoken in a somewhat scolding tone, no punishment has ever been used either in training or testing the dog. In re-testing the dog's ability to respond to conmmands in the laboratory Mr. Herbert and both experimenters were concealed behind screens so that there was no opportunity whatsoever for the Clever Hans error to enter into the results. Several chairs, tables, and such other ob- jects as were to be used, were placed in chance locations about the room, which included also two windows and one door. The behavior of the dog was observed through a slit in the screen by one observer and recorded, while the other reported to Mr. Herbert and indicated the command to be given next. Reaction times were not taken in this series of tests. On all three days the command-performance test was given after Fellow had been working for an hour or more at the retrieving-objects test, to be described later, and naturally he was not at his best on all occasions. It soon became apparent that certain commands could be carried out as per- fectly under our test conditions as when the master was present but that others could not. After some attempt at analysis we discovered that the repertory of com- mands classified readily into two quite distinct groups. Type I, as listed in table I, did not involve any very definite iden- tification of object or place, but consisted of some movement of the animal's body in whatever place he happened to be at the moment. Type II, on the other hand, required the animal to identify and orient himself toward some object or place after the command had been given. The for- mer response could be made immediately after the command issued, the latter usually involved a delay of considerable length. In fact, it constituted a typical delayed reaction situation except for the fact that the signal was a sound, or word instead of a light and presupposed that a</page><page sequence="22">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS 2.1 TABLE I Items selected from this list in command-performance test TYPE I-NO SPECIAL ORIENTATION TO OBJECT OR POSITION REQUIRED I.

The work of Hunter (i8) Walton (54) and others on the delayed reaction experiment, which is relatively simple compared to the present test, should have served as a warning against expecting favorable results in this case. We know of no instance in which even the higher apes have actually dem- onstrated their ability to pass such a test when all visual cues have been ruled out; and of course Fellow could perform even the type II commands when his master was not behind the screen. Without further tests we are unwilling to say that the dog cannot come up to the type II level of response, since the ar- rangement of hiding the master behind the screen was new and perhaps disturbing to Fellow. This may have been due, not altogether to lack of visual cues, but perhaps also to the fact that the dog was, under this condition, removed from his usual position for performing, i.e., on the stage in front of his master. Some evi- dence for disturbance arising from this and other conditions imposed by the test can be gathered from a close study of the detailed records. October 30, 2:00 P.M. (all three persons present behind screens). The following commands (type II) were given along with many of the simpler sort (type I), all of the latter being correct: i. "Jump upon the table"-Correct. 2_ "Put your head on the chair" -dog jumps up on table again. 3. Command repeated twice-dog hesitates, looks toward screen, goes over to the window and looks out. 4. "Go over to the door" -dog leaves window and stands near screen. 5. "Go look out of the window"-dog jumps up on table near by. 6. "Put your head on the table"-dog looks at and approaches screen. It was now decided to make a deliberate attempt to confuse the dog, by having Mr. Herbert come from behind the screen and issue the commands, at the same time looking away from the place or object</page><page sequence="24">SENSORY CAPACITIES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS 2.3 which the dog was supposed to approach in performing, with the following result: i. "Go put your head on the chair"-dog jumps up on table at which Herbert is looking. 2. "Jump over the chair, good dog"-dog goes over to window at which Herbert is looking. 3. "Go over to the door -approaches table at which Herbert is looking. 4. "Go over to the door now, I say'-goes to window slowly, toward which Herbert has turned. 5. "Go take a walk around the room"-dog goes to door at which Herbert is looking. Mr. Herbert was then blindfolded and the test repeated to see whether Fellow got his cue from watching his master's eyes or from the general orientation of head and body. Similar results were now obtained showing that the latter factor is most likely the important one. The dog was again tested as before with all persons present behind screens, and with similar results on November 4, and November io. Only two commands of this order out of a total of 2-o were properly executed-less indeed than pure chance should give. On their face these results seem to show that Fellow does, and must use visual cues in carrying out commands of this type. It should be pointed out, however, that not all items of the type II were tried out under test conditions and some of them would appear to be much easier than others. This point did not occur to us until we were analyzing the data a few days ago, and it was then too late to make further tests. The fact that the dog did not fail at all on the more than fifty different commands of type I, even when these were given over and over again along with the more difficult sort, shows very clearly the ability of the dog to form associations between sounds, or verbal patterns, and definite acts on his part. Furthermore, it will be seen that the dog did very well indeed on the retrieving-objects test, which happens to be the third item in our type II list, but which was tested under a more natural arrangement. We have the feeling that if Mr. Herbert would use the screen ar- rangement for a while in training the dog until he became accustomed to performing with his master out of sight, many if not all of the commands of type II could be carried out successfully without any visual aids whatsoever. Even in the present results, it is only the object, or place in connection with which the act is to be performed, and not the act itself that seemed to require visual cues. It is more than likely that a greater amount of practice had been given the name-act associations than the name-object, or name-place con- nections and hence we should expect the former to be more firmly fixed and more easily utilized. The retrieving-objects test According to Mr. Herbert, a large number of common objects and places are known to Fellow by name. The partial list which he gave us included the follow- ing items: table, chair, pillow, bed, sofa, window, door, back door, front door, car, truck, elevator, water, milk, tree, wall, keys, brush, lady, gentleman, baby, boy, little boy, big boy, girl, little girl, big girl, dog, cat, puppy, shoes, baby's shoes, baby's doll, gloves, package, hat, coat, dollar (silver), money (paper), stick, ball, roof, fence, house, horse, post, lap (of person), collar, strap (leash), bite (of food), foot, head, mouth, paw, names of some 40 people and other dogs in Detroir, etc. In addition he suppos- edly recognizes certain terms of praise (good dog, that's fine, that's right) and certain words indicating blame (shame, that's no good). The retrieving-objects test was designed to determine to what extent genuine name- object associations had been formed as he assumed. A number of familiar objects were placed in a room in one corner of</page><page sequence="25">24 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY which an observer with stop watch was seated behind a screen. Mr. Herbert was stationed along the wall outside the room about six feet to the right of the open doorway and hence completely out of view of the objects located some I5 feet inside the room on a line with the door. The objects when retrieved were returned before the next command by a third person stationed outside the room with Mr. Herbert, who distracted the dog in the meantime by playing with him. The dog always stood outside the room facing his master when the commands were given. He must then turn about, go to the door, enter it and approach the objects lying iS feet ahead and retrieve the proper object. The commands were often repeated but great care was taken not to repeat a command after the dog had reached the threshold of the door. This means, of course, that we have here, as in the case of all type II situations, a delayed reaction experiment and not a simple dis- crimination or object-recognition set-up. Inasmuch as Fellow moves about rather deliberately the interval of delay between the auditory signal (command) and the essential response (picking up the proper object) was quite considerable. The de- lay was never less than 5 nor more than 35 seconds and in most cases was about iS or 2o seconds, as can be seen from table z. A preliminary test, October 30, in which at first ten and later five objects were employed, led to the decision to use only three objects in the test proper. A large number of objects could not be placed in the room so as to be equally accessible to the dog on approaching them, and the objects themselves naturally differed greatly in size. The low visual acuity of the dog for still objects has already been commented upon and suggests the need of ruling out any large differences in dis- criminability of objects in making tests of this sort. Three of the following five objects were used in each test: a man's kid glove, a seven inch scrub brush, a hotel key with tag attached, Fellow's chain collar, and a package 4 x 5 x I in. in size. The three objects were placed in a row about 2. feet apart and the order kept constant during each of the three test periods. The results of this series of tests (table 2) are rather encouraging in view of the difficulty of the task. According to chance IS of the 36 responses should be successes and 24 should be failures. Only iS definite failures occurred as compared with i6 clear cut successes. Three of the five doubtful cases should probably be counted correct since the proper object was actually retrieved after a wrong object had first been picked up and dropped. The other two doubtful cases occurred in connection with the return by the dog of the wrong object brought on the previous trial. He failed to drop the returned object and came back with both it and the correct one in his mouth. These should probably be scored errors. On this accounting 53 per cent of the responses were correct as against an indication of 33I per cent by chance. The general arrangement of this test was more natural than the earlier one in which Mr. Herbert was concealed behind the screen, since the dog now came in contact with his master between trials. Fellow showed a slight tendency to bring the same object that he had brought the previous time, but this does not account for many of the errors. A more important factor was probably the relative ease with which the various objects could be picked up. Fellow has lost two teeth on one side, which inter- feres somewhat with the use of his mouth in retrieving objects. He appeared to avoid the package when it was lying down flat, and therefore difficult to pick up,</page><page sequence="26">TABLE 2.

The brush was also avoided when the stiff fibres were upturned and likely to irritate his nose, but was picked up readily enough when turned the opposite way. Strict control of this factor was not possible at the time, otherwise we feel the results of the test would have been more satisfactory. The results here presented need to be greatly supplemented and the testing of Fellow extended in several directions be- fore a true evaluation of the dog's ability can be arrived at. However, there would seem to be no doubt that scores of associ- ations between verbal stimuli and definite responses have been well fixated by the patient teaching of Mr. Herbert during the past several years. The evidence for associations between verbal stimuli and objects or places would doubtless be forthcoming if a test were arranged in which object-discrimination could be made without the element of delay be- tween stimulus and response entering in. We hesitate to make an interpretation of the present findings in terms of the dog's capacity for making a delayed reaction, on account of the meagreness and incon- clusiveness of the data. In the type II command, which really includes the retrieving-objects test, we have a delayed reaction in which the essential signal for response is an auditory associate of the object, or locality in space, in connection with which the response must occur. Since the auditory stimulus gives no clue as to the localization of the object or place, orientation cannot be had as in the usual delayed reaction situation by the maintenance of gross bodily attitudes. If further tests should reveal certain evi- dence of such ability, as is more than suggested by the results here reported, then the dog would merit a much higher rank in the scale of mental evolution than most of us have been willing to ac- cord him in the past.
