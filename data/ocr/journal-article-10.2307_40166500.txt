<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Dante Bibliography for 1993 CHRISTOPHER KLEINHENZ bibliography is intended to include notice of all the Dante translations published in this country in 1993 and of all Dante studies and reviews published in 1993 that are in any sense North American. The latter criterion is construed to include foreign reviews of American publications pertaining to Dante and essays on Dante published in foreign journals by residents of North America. The listing of reviews in general is selective, particularly in the case of studies bearing only peripherally on Dante. Items not recorded in the bibliogra- phies for previous years are entered as addenda to the present list. Generally, the citation of an individual study from a collected volume representing several authors is given in brief, while the main entry of the volume is listed with full bibliographical data in its alphabetical order. Issues of this journal under the former title Annual Report of the Dante Society continue to be cited in the short form of Report, with volume number. With this issue of Dante Studies we are beginning a move to change the format of the annual bibliography. We hope eventually to publish only those annotations and abstracts of individual entries that have been pro- vided by the author or extracted from the works themselves. Therefore, authors wishing to supply abstracts of their works should send same to the compiler of the bibliography for inclusion. I would like to thank my research assistant, Silvia Monteleone, for her invaluable help in the anno- tation of this bibliography. We are also beginning the practice of including commissioned reviews and review essays in the journal. Critical appraisals of individual works or 301</page><page sequence="2">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 rassegne of works on similar topics will appear within a reasonable period of time following publication.

Dante's "Paradise": Translation and Commentary. Scranton, Pennsylvania: University of Scranton Press; 302</page><page sequence="3">American Dante Bibliography, Christopher kleinhenz London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1993. 268 p. The volume includes a translation in blank verse of the Paradiso, togeth- er with a running prose commentary, such that the volume is divided into thirty-three "chapters" consisting of a mixture of text and commentary. Torrens comments on his procedure as follows: "My text is an attempt, above all, to keep readers from being discouraged, to open the doors as fully as possible to them, as they delve into the poetry. The approach here, abolishing endnotes, is to intersperse helpful prose, either as introduction to a given passage, or as a follow-up to it, providing necessary information or some critical insight."

"Much Virtue in Ma: Paradiso xdc, 106, and St. Thomas's Sed contra" In Dante Studies, CXI (1993), 195-211. In form and in content, the Eagle's answer can be read as the article responding directly and comprehensively to the question of pagans that St. Thomas never wrote: an accurate summa of comments he dropped while answering other questions. It follows him exactly, in recognizing two ways into Paradise for pagans. We have still to recognize the general significance of the one not limited to the past but opening Dante's text to the future (as does Beatrice's promise to Virgil), the way exemplified by the importunate prayers of Gregory. The Eagle takes from Thomas the examples of Gregory and of Hezekiah and the hopeful conclusion his dialectics draws from them: Prayer cannot alter Predestination, but that truth does not destroy the value of Prayer, [ma] Ardizzone, Maria Luisa. "The Genesis and Structure of Pound's Paradise: Looking at the Vocabulary." In Paideuma, xxii, No. 3 (Winter, 1993), 13-37. Proposes a rereading of Ezra Pound's Paradise utilizing unpublished material. With this material the author examines eight key words to be found in Pound's Cantos and makes connections among these words, seeking to put into focus the structure of Pound's Paradise as organized by Pound in opposition to Dante's Paradise, utilizing what Ardizzone indi- cates as Cavalcanti's function in the Cantos and connecting it to Confucian 303</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 philosophy. Pound's knowledge of medieval culture is investigated most- ly through his criticism of Aristotle's philosophy and his putting forward of the medieval philosophy of light. Pound's Paradise, however, is embed- ded in twentieth century culture, as Ardizzone shows by examining the word "jagged" through which Pound defined his Paradise and connecting it, on the one hand, to DAnte and Aristotle and to quantum physics, on the other hand, [mla] Barolini, Teodolinda. "Why Did Dante Write the Commedia? or The Vision Thing." In Dante Studies, CXI (1993), 1-8. Barolini presents her answer to the question within the context of at least one of the goals of her recent book, The Undivine Comedy, which was "to suggest that the time has come for us to rehabilitate the Commedia as a vision, not making the positivist error of seeing earlier visions as sources of the Commedia but reengaging Dante's text in a dialogue with the vision- ary tradition." She notes that "while dantisti continue to debate whether or not to consider the Commedia a vision, scholars in others disciplines have been working to understand the common ground that underlies all vision literature. If we wish our more nuanced sense of the Commedia to have any impact on such discussions, we must remove it from its isolated high- culture peak and come to terms with it not only as a literary artifact but also as the record of a visionary experience. Dante's own suggestions regarding what is clearly a mystical experience have been handled with an excessive timidity that has its roots in our susceptibility to Dante's narra- tive realism and our desire to keep poets safely segregated from prophets, as though our tradition were not replete with the complex contaminatio of poets and prophets, language users and visionaries, wordsmiths and truthtellers." An examination of the Comedy against the backdrop of earli- er visionary literature discloses the extraordinary nature of Dante's achievement. Birns, Nicholas. "The Trojan Myth: Postmodern Reverberations." In Exemplaria, v, No. 1 (Spring, 1993), 45-78. Discusses the Trojan myth in the context of medieval readings of the classical epic tradition. Birns deals briefly with Paradiso XX, explaining the presence of Ripheus in heaven because of his Trojan identity, which makes him compatible to Christianity and adaptable to it after Revelation has come. 304</page><page sequence="5">American Dante Bibliography, Christopher kleinhenz Boswell, Jackson Campbell. "Dante's Fame in England: 1536-1586." In Dante Studies, cxi (1993), 235-243. Cites hitherto unnoted references to Dante in eighteen works pub- lished in England. This collection supplements previous references by E J. Toynbee, F. R Wilson, and J. C. Boswell. Taken singly, the references appear to be relatively unimportant; however, added to those cited in pre- vious collections, they clearly show that Dante's fame in England was far greater than has been appreciated, [jcb] Botterill, Steven.

"II Canto xvii del Paradiso e i commentatori del Cinquecento." In Italica, lxx, No. 1 (Spring, 1993), 60-68. Examines the views expressed by sixteenth-century commentators on Paradiso XVII and, in particular, on the Aristotelian metaphor of the cube ("tetragono") and on the problem of the relationship between human free will and divine foreknowledge. Brown, Phyllis R. "Penance and Pilgrimage in The Divine Comedy and The Song of Roland" In Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching, IV, No. 1 (Spring, 1993), 17-26. "Perhaps more than any other medieval work, Dante's Divine Comedy teaches the intricacy of the internal and external aspects of medieval pil- grimage in its political, social, and religious manifestations. In Dante's poem the three cantica correspond to the three stages in the pilgrimage to God: 1) in Hell, the reader is led to recognize and understand the nature of sin - to learn what sin is in order to avoid it; 2) in Purgatory, to recog- nize and understand the nature of true repentence; and 3) in Paradise, to recognize and try to understand the true nature of God's justice, not from a limited, human view, but rather from a divine point of view. Thus the Commedia can be seen as a sort of guidebook - like the medieval guide- books to pilgrimage sites such as the Pilgrim's Guide to Santiago - but a guidebook for the soul, not the body." 305</page><page sequence="6">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 Brownlee, Kevin. "Dante, Beatrice, and the Two Departures from Dido." In MLN: Modern Language Notes, CVin, No. 1 (January, 1993), 1-14. The essay explores how the two departures of Dante's guides in the Comedy are informed by Aeneas's two departures from Dido in the Aeneid. Brownlee argues that the exchange between Aeneas and Dido at the moment of his departure from Carthage works as a subtext for the con- frontation between Dante and Beatrice after the disappearance of Virgil in Purgatorio xxx and xxxi; the definitive separation in the underworld is the model for Dante's reaction to the disappearance of Beatrice in Paradiso XXXI. What distinguishes Dante from his predecessor is the power of his words to move the listener: verbal communication is ineffective in the Virgilian subtext, but successful in the two parallel scenes in the Comedy. This is caused by the fact that we have in Dante a Christian sublimation of erotic love that makes the figure of woman central in the Comedy, whereas she was eccentric and an obstacle to the protagonist's destiny in the Aeneid. . "Literary Genealogy and the Problem of the Father: Christine de Pizan and Dante." In Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies, xxiii, No. 3 (Fall, 1993), 365-387. Christine de Pizan linked the issue of gender to that of authority, relat- ing herself to a privileged set of model authors and, in particular, to Dante. Brownlee shows how in the Livre du chemin de long estude the Dantean model functions through a process of textual reminiscence and citation that involves authority and difference simultaneously. Christine's genealogical connections with Dante function both as authorizing links and demarcating lines. Calenda, Corrado. "Purgatorio XV." In MLN: Modern Language Notes, CVin, No. 1 (January, 1993), 15-30. In Purgatorio XV the motif of light and the image of the eyes, directly or indirectly, in a literal or figurative sense, mark the development of the nar- ration. The thematic of light modulates the development of Dante's advancement and his progress to Truth. The Cambridge Companion to Dante. Edited by Rachel Jacoff.

Fifteen specially commissioned essays ... provide background information and up-to-date critical perspectives on Dante's life and work, focusing on areas of central importance. They explore the literary antecedents, both vernacular and classical, of Dante's poetry, the intellectual background to his writings (biblical, philosophical, and theological sources), and their historical context, both political and social. There are introductory essays to each of the three canticles of the Divina Commedia, as well as chapters on Dante's other works.

Suggests that the master builder trope for every sort of composition is fundamental to the Middle Ages and that it specifically evokes mnemon- ic technique. Carruthers argues that in the Comedy buildings, such as the "amphitheatre" of Hell and the noble castle, function for Dante as mnemonic cues to matters he has stored away and now has the opportu- nity to use. These images function as mnemonic structures, not informa- tive but inventional, whose visual appearance in the text serves as the stimulus for further meditation. 307</page><page sequence="8">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 Cavanagh, Michael.

In Dante Studies, cxi (1993), 153-175. This essay attempts to support and develop Erich Auerbach's claim that the figure of Lady Poverty in Dante's account of St. Francis's life is erotic in nature. Working on the background of the writings surrounding the Canticle of Canticles, Dante interprets Francis's commitment to poverty as a mystical choice to embrace the goods of the next world directly, with- out the dressing of this world. The metaphor he chooses for this excep- tional spiritual passion is that of sexual consummation within marriage. The essay also argues that Lady Poverty represents a positive version of Purgatory's seductive siren, the only other figure in the Comedy whose role is clearly sexual, [mc] Cogan, Marc. "Delight, Punishment, and the Justice of God in the Divina Commedia.n In Dante Studies, cxi (1993), 27-52. Virgil's statement (Inf. XII, 87) that Dante has not come to Hell for "delight" embodies Dante's fundamental principles of action, punishment and reward. For medieval Aristotelians, all action, sinful or pious, begins in desire and ends, if successful, in delight. Since the punishments of Hell replicate the actions which condemned their agents, sinners in Hell can be said to be there for "delight" in a double sense: for desiring wrong delights while alive, they were condemned; in replicating those actions in Hell, they experience a parody of the same delights. Their punishment is pre- cisely to experience wrong delight eternally. Since the blessed also repli- cate their blessed actions, they eternally experience proper delight. One single justice permeates all realms of the other world: as people chose 308</page><page sequence="9">American Dante Bibliography, Christopher kleinhenz delight in this life, so are they rewarded (or punished) by experiencing the same delight forever.

In Encyclopedia of Cosmology: Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology, edited by Norriss S. Hetherington (New York and London: Garland, 1993), pp. 139-148. A biographical sketch of Dante's life followed by a succinct account of the moral underpinnings to Dante's elaboration on the Aristotelian cos- mos. Attention is paid to the Neoplatonic, Islamic, and Christian sensi- bilities that demanded certain adaptations to the system of the universe inherited from the Greeks. Dante's descriptive and metaphoric use of the stars is traced from his early works to the last word of the Paradiso. The moral geography presented in the Divine Comedy is contrasted with the scholastic cosmogony proposed in the Questio deAqua et Terra. The Comedy also offers an original vision of how the sensible and supernatural worlds might intersect. [AC] . "Dante's Moral Cosmology." In Cosmology.

"Why the Commedia Is Not the Model for the Cantos and What Is." In Lectura Dantis, xii (Spring, 1993), 16-25. Breaking with the critical tradition that reads the Cantos as a modern Comedy, Dasenbrock argues that when Pound refers to a structural resem- blance between his poem and Dante's work he is asserting his difference from that model. The Cantos resemble not the Comedy, but express instead the Renaissance epideictic idea of epic practiced by Tasso, Varchi and Tassoni. De Girolami Cheney, Liana.

In MLN: Modern Language Notes, CViii, No. 4 (September, 1993), 696-709. Examines the origin of the legend of the eaten heart and its develop- ment in medieval narrative. Dante's vision in chapter in of Vita Nuova rep- resents a radical departure from the conventional articulations of the legend, because of its inscription within a framework defined by the Eucharist and the cult of the Sacred Heart. Emiliani, Cesare. "The Veltro and the Cinquecento diece e cinque." In Dante Studies, cxi (1993), 149-152. Because there are only three words in medieval Italian that rhyme in-inque, and Dante uses all three in Purgatorio xxxin (w. 41, 43, 45), the common interpretation that DXV means DUX is probably correct. This unidentified leader, whose origin will be "tra feltro e feltro," is termed by Dante a veltro, which is a big dog or a "gran cane." Villani, whose Cronica was started in 1308, notes that Cane means "emperor" in the Mongols' language and reports that Cangius (Cinghis Khan) was made emperor "in su un povero feltro." Marco Polo, whose Milione was trans- lated into Tuscan in 1309, reports that felt was widely used by the Mongols for their tents, to cover their carts, and to make idols. Marco Polo lavishly exalts both "Cinghis Kane" and especially "Coblam Kane" (Kublai Khan), who is more powerful than all other leaders of the world put together. It would seem that Dante's veltro is a great leader patterned after the great Khans of the time, but without their thirst for land zndpeltro. [CE] Ferrante Joan M. "Why Did Dante Write the Comedy?" In Dante Studies, cxi (1993), 9-18. 311</page><page sequence="12">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 In her reponse to the question, Ferrante first reinforces her already expressed view "that Dante wrote the Comedy to deliver a political mes- sage" and "that his main purpose in writing the poem was to preach the need for political unity, for independent states, cities or kingdoms, work- ing together under the only umbrella large enough to cover them, the empire, which can only function properly in conjunction with an apoliti- cal church purified of all secular wealth and power, and individuals who recognize their responsibility to participate in and contribute to the com- mon cause." She then passes to a consideration of "why he delivered the message in the form he did, or how he presents his coming to it, how he chooses to order what happened to him, often revising his earlier views, and to see it in the context of universal as well as local history and see him- self as the bearer of a divine message." She concludes with an examination of the role of women in the poem, which attests both to Dante's evolving thought on political matters and to his revised view of the Aeneid. Ferrucci, Franco. "Dante e Chretien de Troyes: sublimazione classico- cristiana del romanzo cortese." In Lectura Dantis, XIII (Fall, 1993), 3-21. Examines the symbolic ritual of identification in the Comedy in light of how it was presented by Chretien de Troyes. Like Chretien's heroes who decide to hide their name because they are in a condition of guilt or default, Dante refuses to reveal his name to Guido del Duca because he has not yet demonstrated his poetic eccellence. The subtext provided by Chretien seems to organize the most important scenes of the progressive identification of Dante and to serve as a constant point of reference in the Comedy. Flosi, Linda. "Geometric Iconography in the Commedia: Paradiso and the Circling of the Square." In Italian Culture, XI (1993), 31-44. Attempts to demonstrate to what extent the "metaphysical and physical merge in spatial, geometric imagery" in the Comedy. . "Visual and Semantic Multistability in Dante's Commedia.99 In Lectura Dantis, XII (Spring, 1993), 26-33. Using Claude Gendelman's translation of reversible visual patterns in the semiotic interaction between signifie and signifiant, Flosi identifies in the Comedy three semantically multistable signs: wise, spirare, and punto. She shows how these share a visual element that can be graphically 312</page><page sequence="13">American Dante Bibliography, Christopher kleinhenz expressed in a line, a spiral and a centerpoint and demonstrates that Dante gives through them a geometrical unity to the work. Frank, Maria Esposito. "La 'concreata e perpetua sete' del Paradiso.99 In Esperienze letterarie, xvin, No. 3 (luglio-settembre, 1993), 41-55. Frank notes that she has "attempted to reexamine the traditional inter- pretation of Paradiso n, 19-20 that considers 'La concreata e perpetua sete / del deiforme regno...' to be the same 'sete naturale' of which Dante speaks elsewhere in the Commedia. [She has] analyzed the various places in the Convivio, the Commedia, and the Letter to Cangrande where Dante express- es his concept of desire in the light of his choice of adjectives ('naturale' and 'concreata e perpetua'). [She] believe [s] there is a distinction, for Dante, between human earthly desire - a desire which finds its ultimate and complete satisfaction upon the soul's arrival in paradise - and heav- enly desire, which exists alongside this satisfaction, continually rekindled by the experience of the 'infinito eccesso.' In this regard, [she] see[s] a connection with the Augustinian concept of 'unsatiable satiety' in the heavenly community, with the mystic Richard of Saint Victor's 'fourth degree of Charity' as the ultimate union with God, and with Saint Paul's charis, which is both grace and gratitude." Franke, William. "Dante and Modern Hermeneutic Thought." In Lectura Dantis, xii (Spring, 1993), 34-52. Treats the question of the truth or historicity of Dante's narrative. The critical tradition established by Erich Auerbach and Charles Singleton asserts that the Comedy must be taken to be literally and therefore histor- ically true; Franke argues that the most significant implications of the poem's claim to truth and historicity concern not the literal and historical senses of the narrative so much as the existential historicity of the reader. The locus of the making of history is not the plot of the poem so much as the act of reading. Gertz, Sun Hee Kim. "The Readerly Imagination: Boccaccio's Com- mentary on Dante's Inferno v." In Romanische Forschungen, cv, Nos. 1-2 (1993), 1-29. Boccaccio the critic is also an author who gives a decidely literary turn to his observations.

'Why Did Dante Write the ComedyT In Dante Studies, CXI (1993), 19-25. In response to Charles Davis's challenging question, the author of this brief paper argues that Dante's choices for the composition of his mag- num opus involved him in three linked if apparently paradoxical posi- tions: the poem is theologically grounded, against the statements of St. Thomas (and others) denying to poetry a major cognitive role; despite this stance (Dante as "theologus/poeta"), the poem welcomes classical learn- ing in ways that would seem at odds with its theological interests; further, it goes on to sponsor, against its classicizing bent, the supremacy of the "low" vernacular, a stylistic choice that is related to its sense of the "sermo humilis" as the stylistic register most fitting for its God-centered poiesis.

"Decoding the Parallelism of Three Descents into Dante's Hell." In Quaderni d'italianistica, xiv, No. 1 (Primavera, 1993), 111-119. Argues that the repetition of the noun "color" and of the formula "vo' che sappi" constitutes a linguistic code that joins together the descents of Christ, Virgil and Dante into Hell and affirms the commonality of their purpose. All the descents are concerned with saving souls: Virgil descend- ed so that one soul might be saved from the pain of the ninth circle (cf. Inf. rx, 25); Christ descended to save a host of souls from the torments of Hell (Inf. in); the Christian reader of Dante's book may also be counted among those who will be saved from Hell.

(Brill's Studies in Intellectual History, vol. 38) "One of the burning issues of late medieval and early Renaissance Italy was the question of the language. The single most important figure to treat this subject in the late Middle Ages was Dante Alighieri. The Dantean argument on language with its implicit acknowledgment of a classical bilingualism and its faith in the efficacy of the vernacular stimu- lated and defined the debate on language among the humanists of the fif- teenth century. [Mazzocco's] book aims at a novel and open-ended reading of Dante's literature on language and at a systematic reconstruc- tion of the whole body of humanistic literature on linguistic phenomena. In so doing, it recaptures the theoretical assumptions - philological empiricism, political ideology, stylistic imperatives, literary aspirations - that shaped the thinking of Bruni, Biondo, Alberti, Guarino, Poggio, Filelfo, Valla, Landino and Lorenzo de' Medici. The work, therefore, goes beyond the strict, technical periphery of linguistic enquiry, and it becomes a study of intellectual history."

To trace the circle of Dante's intellectual concerns, Mazzotta examines the structure and aims of medieval encyclopedias, especially in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; the medieval classifica- tion of knowledge; the battle of the arts; the role of the imagination; the tension between knowledge and vision; and Dante's theological specula- tions in his constitution of what Mazzotta calls aesthetic, ludic theology.

"Dante's Bear: A Note on 'Cos! nel mio parlar'." In Dante Studies, cxi (1993), 213-222. The author inspects the bear-lore available to Dante in encyclopedias, bestiaries, and vernacular poetic traditions in assessing the relevance of the image of the bear at verse 71 of "Cos! nel mio parlar voglio esser aspro" to the themes and langauge of the canzone more generally. In light of this bear-lore, the author argues that the lover-as-bear in "Cos!" is linked to Dante's presentation of the lover's lust and violence, but to his skill and dexterity as well; rich in anthropomorphic attributes, the bear was com- pared in medieval texts to a naked man, a comparison germane to the ambiguous status, between humanity and ferality, of the lover in the rime petrose. The author also sees in Dante's reference to the beating of the lover by Amor an instance of the vernacular poetic topos (Rigaut de Berbezilh, Chiaro Davanzati) of the "beaten bear" strengthened by ill-treatment.

The symbolism and narrative of Purgatorio VIII are based largely upon the various prayers and hymns of the office of Compline. Dante draws on the texts of this office in constructing his account of the princely souls and the serpent's assault on their Eden-like valley: the liturgy provides him with the images he uses to demonstrate that the tendency toward sin has yet to be purged from the princes. Dante also refigures the liturgical action of Compline in his narrative to underscore the return to original innocence that the Mountain represents, [amcc] Musa, Mark. "Rereading Inferno DC."

"Rejection, Death and the Eternal Law: The Wounded Tree' in Inferno and 'Villa Chigi'." In Lectura Dantis, XII (Spring, 1993), 53-64. Recognizing in D'Annunzio's adaptation of the image of the wounded tree an echo of Dante's "alberi strani" in Inferno xiii, Nissen suggests that the canto is the direct font of inspiration for the whole poem, where D'Annunzio consciously reverses Dantean imagery in a distinctly non- Christian and pessimistic context. Parker, Deborah. Commentary and Ideology: Dante in the Renaissance. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1993. xii, 248 p. "The Divine Comedy played a dual role in its relation to Italian Renaissance culture, actively shaping the fabric of that culture and, at the same time, being shaped by it. This productive relationship, in which both the Comedy and Italian Renaissance society existed in mutual defini- tion and redefinition, is examined in Commentary and Ideology.... By study- ing the social and historical circumstances under which commentaries on Dante were produced, the author clarifies the critical tradition of com- mentary and explains the way in which this important body of material can be used in interpreting Dante's poem. Parker begins by tracing the criticism of Dante commentaries from the nineteenth century to the pre- sent and then examines the tradition of commentary from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. She shows how the civic, institutional, and social commitments of commentators shaped their response to the Comedy, and how commentators tried to use the poem as an authoritative source for various kinds of social legitimation. Parker also discusses how different commentators dealt with a deeply political section of the poem: the damnation of Brutus and Cassius. Differences in the commentators' 320</page><page sequence="21">American Dante Biblwgraphy, Christopher kleinhenz intellectual roles and their various audiences are shown to have affected both their remarks on the poem and the subsequent fate Divi of their commentaries. Parker concludes with an examination of the publishing history of the Divine Comedy in the Renaissance and argues for the devel- opment of a bibliographic code, which would extend critical assessment of literature to the format of books."

"Ideology and Cultural Practice: The Case of Dante's Treatment of Beatrice d'Este." In Dante Studies, cxi (1993), 131-147. Underlines the limitations of the dominant formal mode of reading the Comedy. As an example, Parker takes Dante's condemnation of Beatrice d'Este's remarriage (Purg. vill). The different account of the story offered by the Trecento commentators, who recall to us the social and legal mech- anisms that determined Beatrice's action, shows that more attention to the poem's interpretive tradition can help us detect differences between Dante's representation and contemporary social practice. Pertile, Lino. "Dante's Comedy beyond the Stilnovo." In Lectura Dantis, xiii (Fall, 1993), 47-77. Argues that the dolce stil novo is revisited by the poet of the Comedy not to recuperate or redeem it, but to disclose its limitations and transcend it. In Purgatorio xxvi we are shown that Dante must transcend that style through the figure of Arnaut Daniel who underlines how limited and cieco Dante the character still is even at this late stage in his journey.

Poulakidas, Andreas K. "Kazantzakis: Dante's Translator and Rhapsodist." In Studies in Medievalism V: Medievalism in Europe (1993), 225- 238. Politically and poetically devoted to the advancement of demotic Greek, Kazantzakis "acquired the conviction that his mission recapitulat- ed that of Dante and Luther, since they had also advocated and promoted the vernacular language of the people." In 1932, the year he completed his epic poem The Odyssey, Kazantzakis began his hendecasyllabic translation of the Comedy.

"Attributo e predicato di pie(de) in Inferno 1.30." In Italica, lxx, No. 2 (Summer, 1993), 212-216. Considering the widely disparate critical interpretations (e.g., Enrico De Negri and John Freccero) of this verse - "si che '1 pie fermo sempre era '1 piu basso" - , Stefanini suggests that here Dante informs the reader that he has turned to the left and is moving up the slope on a diagonal course, such that the right foot is always higher up (toward the mountain) than the left (toward the valley), and thus sempre piu basso. .

"For Dante, the Indus is in the East, a distant periphery to the Christian-Roman geo-political space serving as an imaginative cultural horizon outside the Christian world. Dante conceives of this world as beyond the political-cultural aspirations of his own sphere, and by includ- ing the Indus, Dante introduces a difficulty with his religio-imperial map, for the lands and peoples beyond its borders are a challenge to its ideo- logical certainties." Schnapp, Jeffrey T. "Injured by the Light: Violence and Paideia in Dante's Purgatorio,9' In Dante Studies, cxi (1993), 107-118. Examines the representation of Dante-pilgrim's body with relation to the light imagery of Purgatorio. Whereas in Hell the pilgrim's corporeality is mostly taken for granted and in Paradise there is no way to answer the question of whether he travels inside or outside of his body, Purgatory is the realm of embodiment and Dante's fleshly presence is marked from the beginning by an elaborate pattern of allusions to the violent interac- tion between his body and the sun. These interactions, shaped by con- temporary optics, cosmology and metaphysics, are shown to be essential to the second canticle's overall allegory of the pilgrim's spiritual renewal. [JTS] Tomer, Enrique. "Valle-Inclan's Luces de Bohemia as a Parody of Dante's Inferno." In Hispanofila, CDC (septiembre, 1993), 33-47. 324</page><page sequence="25">American Dante Bibliography, CHRISTOPHER KLEINHENZ While it is widely recognized that Luces de Bohemia is a parody of Dante's Inferno, Torner argues that "the parallelism of structure must be studied, not only through Dante, but also through the esoteric perspec- tives of the Cabbala, theosophy, and occultism, since Valle-Inclan was steeped in this esoteric atmosphere. The structure of Luces de Bohemia must be understood both through the Divine Comedy and Numerology." An examination of Max Estrella's pilgrimage through Madrid discloses that "he appears in nine different locations, and that the events taking place in these locations are a parody of the moral meaning of the nine cir- cles of Dante's Inferno." Usher, Jonathan. "Pieces of Dante Among Cipolla's Relics." In Lectura Dantis, xm (Fall, 1993), 22-31. Argues that there is an insistent and consistent Dantean subtext in the novella of Frate Cipolla by Boccaccio (Dec. VI, 10) and that this subtext goes beyond the quote itself. Usher identifies in Cipolla's relics, the "relics" of a reading of the Comedy disclosing Boccaccio's serious scholar- ly approach to Dante. Vallone, Aldo. "Purgatorio 14 e VApocalisse." In Quademi d'italianistica, XIV, No. 1 (Primavera, 1993), 5-16. Identifies the unifying idea of the canto in the use of images and sym- bols of apocalyptic tone, at the center of which is the image of the Arno as a monster. A closer reading discloses parallels between Dante's text and the Apocalypse. Verduin, Kathleen. "Sayers, Sex, and Dante." In Dante Studies, CXI (1993), 223-233. The success of Dorothy L. Sayers's translation of the Divine Comedy (published by Penguin 1949-1962) may be credited in part to her alertness as a popular novelist to the needs of contemporary readers: decades before the current concern with reader response and literary reception, Sayers tacitly recognized that acts of reading are culturally placed. Part of her self- appointed project, therefore, was to rehabilitate Dante for a twentieth- century readership by detaching both the poet and his texts from the matrix of the nineteenth-century Dante revival. Explicitly rejecting "Byronic" and Pre-Raphaelite constructions of Dante, Sayers was most exercised against the Victorian absorption of Dante and Beatrice into the 325</page><page sequence="26">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 cult of feminine purity and idealized love. Charles Williams's revisionary reading in The Figure of Beatrice (1943) functioned as a necessary autho- rization for Sayers, but it was she more than any other writer of her gen- eration who strove to uproot Dante from nineteenth-century gentility and credit both him and Beatrice with an inexorable sexuality. Yet her sup- pressed frustration is suggested by her repeated swerving from the Beatrician center to women at the periphery of Dante's story - the Donna Pietra, the Donna Gentile, and especially Gemma Donati. Sayers's sus- tained attention to Gemma valorized Dante's appreciation "not only of the Beatrice traditionally idealized, but of the real, sensual, and fertile mate ... closest to Sayers's expressed idea of herself." [kv] Warner, Michael Lee. "One-Man Minorities: Multilingual Dante, the Modernists, and a Mookse." In Lectura Dantis, XII (Spring, 1993), 102-112.

Watts, Barbara J. "Dante's Role in the Nineteenth Century Rediscovery of Botticelli." In Italian Culture, XI (1993), 59-81. Examines the emergence of Botticelli as an object of critical study in the nineteenth century thanks to the writings of Walter Pater and John Ruskin, both of whom were led to their understanding of the artist through Dante. Weinfield, Henry. "Lacrimae Rerum, or, Why Dante Weeps." In Hellas, w, No. 1 (Spring, 1993), 11-18. Dante weeps in Purgatorio because he is conscious of the problem of representing the ineffable of Paradise, which is beyond human experi- ence. The poetic is ineluctably tied to the human and hence to the tragic; and when we arrive in Paradise there is a sense in which we leave poetry behind. In this view Virgil does not represent Reason, so much as he rep- resents Poetry; and when Virgil deprives us of himself, there is a sense in which his disappearance deprives us also of poetry. 326</page><page sequence="27">American Dante Bibliography, Christopher kleinhenz Reviews Dante Alighieri.

Dante's Vision and the Artist: Four Modern Illustrators of the "Commedia." New York: Peter Lang, 1992. xiv, 154 p. (New Connections. Studies in Interdisciplinary, Vol. 4) "The book explores the interconnections of Dante's Divine Comedy and four modern painters: Nattini, Rauschenberg, Dali, and Phillipps. It argues for Dante's painterly vision, and in this context establishes the medieval poet as a pre-Renaissance presence, pointing to his Classical, naturalistic manner of seeing, among other things, the human figure. His optic ... is so forceful that it has imposed its anatomical realism on most illustrators from the Renaissance [epitomized by Michelangelo] down to the present. The premise holds through the poetic realism of Nattini, the socio-political expressionism of Rauschenberg, the psychological surreal- ism and devout religiosity of Dali, and the pictorial figurative and non-fig- urative art of Phillipps."
