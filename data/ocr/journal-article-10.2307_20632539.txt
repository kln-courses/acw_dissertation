<plain_text><page sequence="1">Child's eye view Teresa Doran Published originally in French in Quebec and now No Spots for this Giraffe. Lucie Papineau. Merlin. 32 pp 6.99pb 23 cm 1-903582-24-5. translated for the European market by Sheila Flischman, this is a picture book story, telling the tale of Gilda the Giraffe, who on account of her loose spots and her fear that a wind might dislodge them, lives in a cave. When one day, the North Wind comes suddenly and her spots are blown away, she feels naked and has to enlist the help of all the other animals in the jungle to help her. At first they give her their coats to wear; and children will delight to see a giraffe done up like a zebra, a panda or even a fish. However nothing is as good as her own spots, and her animal friends help her to find them again. No Spots is a beautiful story, gently told, which is perfectly complemented by soft pastel illustrations with lots of curvy lines and wonderful swooshy blends of colours. However, there was one instance that grated against the</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IRELAND 2003 February 29 overall charm of the book. For while I would not expect drawings of animals for children's books to be anatomically correct in every sense, I would expect them to be consistent. Gilda is mostly giraffe-like (even with the wrong skin), but in the picture describing her flight from the North Wind she becomes a chimera. Her hocks have become knees and her forelegs shortened to arm-like proportions. Disturbingly she reminded me of the Scissor-man in Strewelpeter. Having been previously disturbed by the Deecee books for A Monster in the House. Carole Tremblay and Dominique Jolin. Merlin. 32 pp 6.99 pb 23 cm 1-903582-25-3. the very young (and proved wrong), I was curious to know what this, for a slightly older child, with its bug-eyed baby cover, would be like. I was pleasantly surprised. The humans actually look human, albeit in a 'Rug-Rat' sort of way - and the illustrations are strong on imaginative detail. Told from the viewpoint of an older sister, the book is about Victor, a true baby from hell, and how his arrival and growth wreaks absolute havoc on his long-suffering family. Fortunately his father, being an ingenious man, combats the various terrible scenarios caused by this one-baby home wrecker, by providing ear-plugs for the neighbours, hard hats for the family, giant wipers for the walls, combination locks for the kitchen cupboards and a giant plughole in the centre of the house, for when Victor next leaves the taps running. The years pass, and as Victor finally reaches school-age and his behaviour becomes closer to normal, their father is forced to sell the house and all its weird and wonderful modifications. However, not only does it prove ideal for keeping gorillas, but gives Victor and his Dad a life-long interest in studying the creatures. Oozing with warped humour, both in the text and illustrations, this is sure to be a hit. A warm-hearted anthropomorphic story of two fox cubs, Brush : a tale of two foxes. Pierce Feiritear. Pixie Books, 72 Cabra Park, Dublin 7.100pp 5.99 pb 20 cm 0-9543544-0-0. Ash and Misty their parents and their escapades as they struggle to survive over a snowy Christmas. Food is scarce and the foxes must use all their ingenuity and courage to find enough to eat, while avoiding the evil McLugs and their ferocious hound Raptor. While retaining their foxy natures, this family group is humanised to allow young readers to better empathise with their situation. Mr Feiritear wisely avoids moralising or falling into the trap of animal rights debate, simply he tells a story from the animals' point of view, not unlike Bambi or Tarka the Otter. Complementing the text perfectly are Conor O'Brien's wonderful illustrations - detailed line drawings, full of atmosphere and character. The skill of the artist is all the more extraordinary when the fact that Conor is only fourteen is taken into account. Terry Myler may look out! Mr Feiritear is the author of several children's books as well as being a primary school teacher - Conor O'Brien being one of his past pupils. There is obvious empathy between author and illustrator, and I look forward to the next collaboration. Ms Jacob has both written and illustrated this excellent, Sandy on Holiday. Lucinda Jacob. P?olbeg. 64pp 6.50pb 20 cm 1-84223-078-6. true-to-life story about two girls who bring their hamsters on holiday From the title and cover illustration I was expecting a humanised-animal story not unlike Brush of the escapades of yet another canny critter and I was pleasantly surprised to find that Sandy is nothing more than a hamster; small, furry and with a propensity to escape. Katie's best friend Carol is brought on a seaside holiday with the family, and, in the same way that some small girls bring their Barbies everywhere, these girls bring their hamsters, which are at first confined to their cages. However the girls' curiosity leads them to see how their hamsters will like the sand - as after all "they are from the desert". At first all goes well, but unlike Barbies, hamsters do not always stay where they are last put, and to the girls' terrible dismay, Sandy goes missing. What happens next is so totally realistic it reminded me of evenings spent searching for guinea pigs in the garden - lying flat in the grass trying to coax them out from under the cotoneaster. Related in the first person by Katie, the story is totally believable and the dynamics between the two girls and Katie's younger brother Declan, utterly authentic. Clearly and humorously written, this book should inspire interest and confidence to readers in the 7-8 age bracket. Not so much a story as the unfolding of a court case, when The Trial of the Big Bad Wolf. Liam Farrell. Children's Press. 64 pp 439pb20 cm Thomas Blake-Burke Wolfe is on trial for menacing three pigs, one granny, Little Miss Muffett, Bo Peep and even Jack and Jill. Judge Bill Boar declares it an open-and-shut case and it is up to Wolfe's lawyers, a canny weasel and a frog to prove otherwise. At first the dice appears stacked against Wolfe; not least that the judge is related to the three pigs and Wolfe's unfortunate choice of clothing is a sheepskin coat. However, by twisting the evidence as presented by the various witnesses and in spite of certain dubious testimonies from the other side, Wolfe's lawyers manage to keep the case open, until even more unusual circumstances force the abandonment of the trial. Type and layout would appear attractive to the beginner reader - but unless the child is a fan of TV courtroom dramas, the presentation of the story, with diary entries, flashes of newspaper reportage and differing accounts of the same story, may prove frustratingly confusing. A very clever book nonetheless, and there should be a prize for discovering the greatest number of other stories and characters alluded to within this one. Very loosely based on the legend of the voyage of St Brendan and the Whale. Clare Maloney. Veritas. 24 pp 7.95 pb 22x25 cm wide 0-86217-645-X. Brendan, Clare Maloney recounts in rhyme what happened to Brendan and his intrepid crew of monks as they cross the ocean in an overlaree currach in search of 'the Land of Promise'. They encounter an island inhabited by giant sheep, are entranced by psalm-chanting birds, scared by sea monsters and attacked by burning rock throwers. When they are almost totally exhausted, they finally find a place to land. It is Easter, and although Brendan is uneasy, he puts his trust in Cod. It is only when the brothers light a fire, that the 'island' moves and is revealed to be an enormous whale. However, Brendan realises that this fish is a benign emissary of God, sent to give them rest, just when rest was most needed. I am often doubtful about books with an overtly religious message, but this, with its spirited mixture of history, fantasy and Christianity, has much to recommend it. The full-colour illustrations are expressive and amusing and the verses themselves wonderfully atmospheric; including such memorable lines as: "Stars broke out like beads of sweat Glistening on night's blackened brow" which to my mind, is pure magic. Finn is not cool. He has red hair that sticks out in all Bad Hair Day. Catherine Doolan.

Taking matters into his own hands, Finn creates a concoction of everything</page><page sequence="3">30 February2003 BOOKS IRELAND he finds in the bathroom, including hair dye, shampoo and head lice preparation. Imitating his mother, he applies it to his head, but the resulting effect is that his hair falls out in clumps. With his mangy-dog hairstyle, Finn looks worse than ever and, as last resort, he is brought to a hairdresser and has the remaining bits shaved off. Dreading his return to school with a shaved head, he is pleasantly surprised by the reaction of his friends, who consider him very cool indeed. With lots of simple but expressive illustrations, this is a book that is sure to encourage beginner readers. Cookie and Curley. Frank Mulligan. Children's Press. 64 pp 4.99 pb 20 cm 1-901737-38-1. Cookie is a cat with attitude, as readers familiar with the first Cookie book will remember. This time the threat to his easy way of life does not come from a resident mouse, but from a kitten that strays into his space. Young readers will delight in the simple text recounting the dilemma experienced by cats (and children), with the arrival of a new addition to the family. Irish Political Review In 1969 British Ambassador Gilchrist reports to London that Major McDowell of the Irish Times rang 10 Downing Street to seek guidance on lines to take in his paper, adding "McDowall is one of the five (Protestant) owners of the Irish Times, and he and his associates are increasingly concerned about the line the paper is taking under its present (Protestant, Belfast-born) Editor, Gageby, whom he described as a very fine journalist, an excellent man, but on Northern questions a renegade or white nigger...."
