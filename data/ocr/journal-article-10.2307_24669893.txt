Fraade, Introduction to the Symposium:Symposium: What is (the) Mishnah? (Introduces the four following papers which were originally presented at the annual meeting of the SBL in 2006. The ques tion of b. Qid. 49a, "What is [the] Mishnah," is still central and has not yet found a conclusive answer); 225-234 Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, Recent Literary Approaches Approaches to the Mishnah (After a brief survey of the use of literary approaches to rabbinic literature in recent research, A. concentrates on the study of the liter ary analysis of Mishnah Rosh ha-Shanah by A. Walfish, a Jerusalem dissertation of 2001. He describes literary features of the Mishnah in order to understand its chapters and tractates as coherent compositions and attributes these literary char acteristics to a conscious redaction of the Mishnah; its raw materials can still be seen in parallels in the Tosefta and halakhic midrashim. A. compares Walfish's approach with that applied by J. Rubenstein, Talmudic Stories, but misses the social contextualisation of the Mishnah; she also discusses methodological prob lems connected with the use of tannaitic parallels in order to establish both the Mishnah's uniqueness and commonality with other tannaitic documents); 235 249 Ishay Rosen-Zvi, Orality, Narrative, Rhetoric: New Directions in Mishnah Research Research (A series of recent publications on the Mishnah share basic methodolog ical assumptions—a holistic attitude to the Mishnah, interest in genre and style and literary devices and the use of paradigms from rhetoric, cultural and perfor mative studies. R.-Z. discusses E. S. Alexanders Transmitting Mishnah [2006] and her innovative use of the concept of orality in Mishnah Shevu'ot which fur ther develops M. Jaffee's studies of rabbinic orality, and her understanding of casuistics not as typical of early legal style, but rather as a conscious educational tool. Alexander rejects Lieberman's thesis of the oral publication of the Mishnah and prefers an oral/written coexistence theory. R.-Z. criticizes both, referring to Y. Sussmann's recent study of Oral Torah which insists on exclusive orality until the 8th c. In the second part, R.-Z. presents a number of recent studies, includ ing his own book on Mishnah Sotah, The Rite That Was Not [Hebr., 2008], that no longer understand mishnaic descriptions of Temple rituals as authentic, but rather as a result of second-century debates and representing the concerns of the post-Temple era. The Mishnah artfully combines Temple and priestly traditions with post-Temple reality, biblical exegesis and ideological innovations. Ritual narrative in the Mishnah must be studied foremost from a rhetorical perspective; at least some of them function not only as manuals for performance but are in © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009 DOI: 10.1163/157006309X410680</page><page sequence="2">282 Review of Articles / Journal for the Study of Judaism 40 (2009) 281-306 fact themselves rituals. This might shed new light on the place of the Temple in the Mishnah where the destruction is almost absent); 251-262 Moshe Simon Shoshan, Between Philology and Foucault: New Syntheses in Contemporary Mishnah Studies Studies (S.-Sh. centers his discussion on Rosen-Zvi's analysis of Mishnah Sotah. He sees in it and similar recent studies the confluence of the classical and more modern approaches, based in some way on structuralism and poststructuralism, and the conceptual-analytical approach of the Lithuanian yeshivot. The rite of the sotah in this analysis is not something ever actually practiced, but a product of the late 2d c., concerned with perennial issues of gender and authority. The cultic descriptions of Mishnah Sotah are a fantasy of total control of the female body. To a large extent, this is close to Neusner's notion that the Mishnah creates an alternate reality, an imaginative narrative world. Thus the legal discourse of the Mishnah has much in common with aggadah; halakhic and aggadic agendas overlap to a significant degree); 263-289 Avraham Walfish, The Nature and Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative:Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative:Purpose of Mishnaic Narrative: Recent Seminal Contributions (W. focuses his paper on M. Simon-Shoshans dissertation, Halakhah lema'aseh: Narrative and Legal Discourse Discourse in the Mishnah [2005], which studies the purpose of narrative texts in the Mishnah and their relationship to the halakhic contents. Simon-Shoshan deals mainly with legal narratives, distinguishing between realis and irrealis narra tives, i.e. case stories and casuistic halakhic statements, and emphasizes the vary ing degrees of "narrativity" in the Mishnah. Different from Neusner, he sees the Mishnah as an inherently complex and ambiguous text not easily to be reduced to clearcut statements. W. doubts the assumption that narrative presentations imply a lack of conceptualization or that the structures of mishnaic language reflect the nature of halakhic thinking. He also doubts that the "discourse of authority" was as central to mishnaic narrators who mainly speak to their own ranks, as it is to us today. Other disagreements arise as to whether individual sto ries have to be read from an "illustrative" or a "representational" perspective. In W.'s view, Simon-Shoshan's reading of mishnaic narrative is sometimes too hala kho-centric. But he agrees that the alternative reading methods proposed in recent studies are not exclusive, but complement each other); 291-297 Christine Hayes, What is (the) Mishnah? Concluding Observations (All the new studies of the Mishnah presented in this symposium study the Mishnah in its own right, but without the extremes of Neusner's documentary theory, approach it syn chronically and adapt theoretical and analytical tools from other disciplines. The plurality is remarkable. The question of the Mishnah's redaction, whether there is a strong overarching redaction or no common redactional unity, the Mishnah getting its shape in repeated performances, is clearly connected with the question of the Mishnah's purpose as a halakhic code or a primarily didactic work. Another point of difference is the way tannaitic parallels are used, either to corroborate the results of the literary analysis, or to generate the interpretation of textual phe nomena. E. S. Alexander, on the other hand, does not try to determine chrono</page><page sequence="3">Review Review of Articles / Journal for the Study of Judaism 40 (2009) 281-306 283 logical priority of parallels and emphasizes non-linear forms of connections between them, diverse performances of traditions. Presently "mapping" the results of diverse projects is more desirable than a synthesis); 299-334 Alex P. Jassen, Prophets and Prophecy in the Qumran Community (The thesis that proph ecy ceased in the early post-exilic period has been contradicted with examples from the Second Temple. But it is clear that prophecy as it was performed in the pre-exilic period had come to an end and was replaced by new prophetic models performing similar functions. This raises the problem as to how we can identify prophecy in the Second Temple period. Here the systematic representation of Biblical prophets in this period is decisive. This is discussed with special regard to the Dead Sea Scrolls. J. analyzes in detail 1QH1 12:5-13:4: The opponents are described in explicit prophetic language whereas the hymnist does not apply such language to himself. They claim to possess prophetic revelation whereas he estab lishes his word as the explicit divine voice and sees himself as legitimate mediator of the divine word. The new language of prophecy advocated in the Qumran community expresses itself in revelatory exegesis, the reading and reconfiguration of prophetic scripture as a prophetic experience. This approach already present in Dan 9 is characteristic of pesher exegesis. Another mode of prophetic revelation in Qumran may be termed "sapiential revelation" as exemplified in the portrait of David as a prophet in 1 lQPsa 27· A last section deals with sapiential revelation in the Hodayot. If we do not apply the criteria of prophecy as used in the Hebrew Bible to later periods, but acknowledge the permanent transformation of proph ecy, we clearly find prophecy in Second Temple Judaism, especially in Qumran, and in later Judaism as well).

(This paper examines the claim that the translation of עלמה by παρθένος in LXX Isa 7:14 bears the marks of a theologically purposeful deviation, transforming the more neutral term עלמה "young woman" into the more specific παρθένος "virgin." The main thesis is that definite borders between the meanings "young woman" and "virgin" are difficult to ascertain both in Hebrew and in Greek, so that determining whether the LXX translation has a special theological significance is a difficult, if not impossible, task. In the paper, the occurrences of παρθένος in LXX Isaiah are surveyed. The author then moves to an evaluation of some contemporary explanations of the use of the term in 7:14. After this evaluation he explores the ranges of meaning and significance of the terms παρθένος, בתולה, and עלמה including some notes on their representation in the LXX. On the basis of this analysis he offers his own suggestion on how best to approach the choice of παρθένος as a translational equivalent for עלמה). J. T. A. G.

In the present article, the reasons for this change of opinion are exam ined, and it is concluded that in most cases the decision about authenticity is taken on the basis of extraneous considerations relating to the composition of the book or the course of history which it purports to relate. The arguments advanced in relation to the documents themselves are the same as those which were com monmon a century ago, and to that extent may be answered in the same way as before. In particular, insufficient attention has been paid to the fact that from a literary point of view it is the documents which determine the shape and wording of the narrative, not vice versa. It is therefore most natural to conclude that they existed already prior to the composition of the book. Only in two areas are there new data to be considered—language and the epistolary form of the documents.

Each heuristically represents a distinct path to perfection: Abraham, the</page><page sequence="20">300 Review of Articles /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 40 (2009) 281-306 first philosopher, exemplifies a life of contemplation, teaching, and inquiry; Isaac exemplifies natural perfection; and Jacob a life made perfect through righteous action. For Philo, the Essenes and the Therapeutae further represent historical communities that exemplify the pursuit of human perfection, the Essenes in the path of Jacob and the Therapeutae in that of Abraham. Most of us, however, are neither Essenes nor Therapeutae, and Philo discusses the possibilities, and chal lenges, that ordinary mortals face as we pursue human perfection). J. T. A. G. M. van Ruiten JudaicaJudaicaJudaica 64:2-3 (2008), 118-135 Emmanuel Friedheim, "Hilaria": On the Historical Historical Meaning of a Pagan Celebration Mentioned in the Land of Israel MidrashimMidrashim (F., author of Rabbinisme et paganisme en Palestine Remain [2006], here discusses a particular Roman feast mentioned in Sir. Rab. 4:4 and Pesiq. Rab Kah.Kah. 28, namely the hilaria, a feast of rejoicing. Since Pesiqta de Rab Kahana sug gests a public celebration in which the ruler played a central role, it was suggested to identify the hilaria with the feast for the coronation of a new king, known from classical Greece. But there is no evidence from the rabbinic period. The hilaria hilaria festival in honour of the goddess Isis, still celebrated in the 4th c. C.E. on November 3, is not connected with the rite of the emperor and, more impor tantly, not at all popular in Palestine. It is therefore suggested to identify the fes rival with a ceremony for the Phrygian goddess Kybele, observed on March 25· Beginning with Emperor Commodus, even the emperors participated in the mass procession and celebrated this day. Since archaeological finds document the exis tence of the rite of Kybele also in Roman Palestine and its surroundings, it is most likely that the unbridled debauchery of this festival was contrasted by the rabbis with the festival on which the To rah was given).

B.C.E. to the early 7th c. C.E. In the Roman period there is a clear distinction between the southern part of the area with much less imported ceramics than in the area closer to Sepphoris or even more so to Nazareth. It is suggested that this is due to different levels of observance of Jewish purity rules. In the Byzantine period these regional differ ences in the distribution of ceramics disappear, probably due to cultural and reli gious changes. There is a high density of settlements, mostly of low-status farms and small villages, but no Roman-period villas, and there is no evidence of Jew ish or Christian religious structures; there are no signs of a "monastic landscape" around Nazareth.

The authors suggest that the octagon church excavated in Caesarea Maritima in the 1990s is a martyrium dedicated to Philip mentioned in Acts 8.

The author highlights in particular questions pertaining to the literary and tex tual development of the biblical tradition, the ascription of authority to particu־ lar texts, and the formation of the canon of the Jewish Bible. It is emphasised how the past 15 years of scholarship has given birth to entirely new views on the formation of the biblical writings and the canon. Second Temple Judaism is accentuated as a pluriform entity, which also included the early Jesus movement. Finally, the author discusses the occurrence of sapiential, mystical and apocalyp tic currents in the Qumran material.

Although parallels between the election of Christ and the Teacher of Righteousness, chosen to be a founder of a community and understood to be an interpreter of scripture, exist, there is no trace of the latter undergoing suffering and crucifixion. Both with regard to chris tology, eschatology, and ecclesiology, 1 Peter reinterprets election by seeing the Christ event as the epitome of election and the ultimate reason for its applicabil ity in the context of Christian identity).

Fragment 7 is even more composite than the rest of the text; it combines Sabbath and sacrificial rules with community rules and rules about the impurity of a woman after childbirth. It is suggested that this text follows the sequence of subjects in Jub. 2-3. The book of Jubilees may have determined the sequence of the entire scroll, similar to the relationship between the Pentateuch and the "Reworked Pentateuch," as S. has shown in his study of 4Q251 which follows the order of Exod 21-23. In both cases, the redactors seem to have assembled miscellaneous rules of different literary genres following the order of an authoritative and well-known text. If this is correct, it would underline the importance of Jubilees at Qumran). Giinter Stemberger</page></plain_text>
