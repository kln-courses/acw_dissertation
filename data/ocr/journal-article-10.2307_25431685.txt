<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATERIA NON MEDICA An inland lifeboat What do you do to transfer a patient in urgent need of treatment from her home 25 miles to the hospital, 25 miles from the coast inland, when the roads are blocked by snow drifts and no transport can get through, when the trains are halted by iced points, and when the local RAF helicopters are grounded because of poor visibility ? Recently, when Norfolk experienced the worst weather conditions since 1947, such a problem arose : three patients in urgent need of haemodialysis were marooned in Great Yarmouth and unable to reach the Norwich renal unit. Road and railway communications were blocked, and helicopters at RAF Coltishall, far from being able to take off in the blizzard conditions, could not even be brought out of their hangers. The lifeboatmen at Gorleston, with the same courage and resourceful ness which produced Norfolk's best-known lifeboatman, Henry Blogg of Cromer, answered the emergency call and brought the three patients inland up the river Yare to Norwich. As the coxswain said: "It was pretty dodgy: it's not surprising really, whoever heard of a lifeboat going on a twenty-five mile trip inland ? We couldn't have done it without radar. We hit packs of ice and debris, and in places it was difficult to spot where the river went because of flooding." After a two and a half hour journey the three patients arrived in Norwich in fine form and treatment started soon after.?d b Hamilton (senior medical registrar, Norwich). The duck on the turbulated tricycle I was disappointed to miss the clockwork monsters?Alain Bourbonnaise "turbulents"?actually moving. They are among the many memorable exhibits at the Hayward Gallery's "Outsiders" exhibition (on until 8 April). Working from no cultural tradition, and seeking no recognition, these are artists who create an "art without precedent" or Art Brut. At least 24 of the 42 artists here were psychotic, though this does not apply to all Outsider exhibitions. These works, claims the catalogue, are "about intense experience which, if we are receptive, we will recognise as our own." Does this apply to, say, Friedrich Schr?der-Sonnenstern's paintings celebrating the monstrousness of the human body, or to Francis Marshall's hideous figures (made of nylons and rubbish from the banks of the Seine tied together with string) suggesting the banality and squalor of French rural life ? However that may be, much of the work is thought-provoking and intriguing, and sometimes beautiful with a surrealist improbability or monumental detail and symmetry. These artists, we are told, "dared" to be original, to reject cultural traditions. Many of them had little choice, having deprived or humble backgrounds and sometimes bizarre careers. Henry Darger worked all his life as a lavatory cleaner; Schr?der-Sonnenstern, in and out of prison and asylum, was a thief, smuggler, confidence trickster, fortune teller, and leader of a mystical sect. A few did have cultural back grounds, which they later rejected. Louis Soutter, for instance, did thousands of drawings and silhouette finger paintings with a primitive energy that broke right away from his early art studies. But by this time he was mentally ill. Presumably kicking over the traces, artistically speaking, becomes easy?or inevitable?for the psychotic, at least for those who have the talent. Think of Louis Wain and his cats: his anthropomorphic and social cats and the increasingly stylised cat faces of his schizophrenia. Apart from an altered mental state, however, the psychotic artist has a vast emptiness: the emptiness of institutional life, usually, as well as of social withdrawal?with no "persons from Porlock" to interrupt his art. Many of these artists spent decades in institutions ; because of his violence Adolf W?lfli spent his last 23 years in a one man cell that he crammed with manuscripts and drawings. And many of the others have led isolated lives. To most of us our involvements and our full lives are precious; and we would dismiss as one-sided Francis Marshall's saying that "Rules, restrictions, work torture people, . . . deform them, crush them, rot them." But I think this exhibition is good for us in pointing to possibilities we should not lose sight of, and to our need for some empty spaces in which to explore and be in touch with ourselves.?daphne gloag (London). The science and art of government among the Scots 1979 is the quatercentenary of the publication of George Buchanan's Dialogus de Jure Regni apud Scotos. Although the book was badly received by King James VI (to whom it had been dedicated) and by the Establishment, and was condemned by the Scottish Parliament, banned after the restoration of Charles II, and ordered by the Uni versity of Oxford to be publicly burned by the common hangman, the book had a profound influence on political thinking of the time. The book had been published in Scotland just after the Scottish people had forced Mary Queen of Scots to abdicate in favour of her infant son James VI, and Buchanan argued the right of the people to bring the King to order. This at the time was a remarkably novel principle and appealed to those seeking a more democratic parlia mentary system. Indeed, in England the Parliamentarians frequently cited Buchanan to justify their own proceedings against their King, Charles I. And the ideas Buchanan enunciated were woven later into the constitution of the United States, which was brought home when the will of the American people forced the resignation of their presi dent, Mr Richard Nixon over the Watergate affair. The Dialogus of George Buchanan has been ignored in English universities and, surprisingly, has been neglected in Scottish universities, but in European seats of learning it is considered a major classic in the art and science of good government. George Buchanan has been maligned by several British historians, but this Gaelic-speaking Highlander was a great Latin scholar, poet, historian, (he wrote a massive history of Scotland), reformer in education (he reformed St Andrews University), religion, and politics. He died in 1582, penniless, his grave being marked by a simple throckstane in Greyfriars Kirkyaird, Edinburgh.?W Watson Buchanan (Hamilton, Ontario).</page></plain_text>
