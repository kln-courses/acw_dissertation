<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion and ritual in sixth-millennium B.C. Mesopotamia Joan Oates Religion is often cited as a major 'prime mover' in the rise of civilized societies, yet in Mesopotamia, where the development of a pristine civilization is well attested, prehistoric evidence for religion is hardly impressive. Only with the relatively late establishment of farming villages in Sumer itself (some time before 5000 B.C.) do we find unambiguous evidence for the pattern of town and temple so characteristic of later Sumerian and Babylonian society. The argument for religious continuity from these 'Ubaid villages to historic times is persuasive, has often been discussed (Lloyd and Safar 1947: 93-4; Oates I960: 44-6; Oates and Oates 1976: 122-32), and is therefore not repeated here. In this article the earlier prehistoric groups of northern and central Mesopotamia are examined. Here evidence that can be interpreted as indicating some form of religious belief is often minimal, surprisingly so in view of contemporary Qatal Hiiyik, not far to the north-west. In considering the subject of religion the prehistoric archaeologist is unable, perhaps fortunately, to join the anthropological quibble over its meaning. Yet if he is to say anything of value, he must at least conform to some pragmatic definition. The distinction between magic and religion or religion and ritual, if indeed such distinctions have any real validity, lies beyond the bounds of his data, though in Durkheim's sense of corporate Church (1954: 44) the identification of unusual or apparently non-secular buildings must provide his most reasonable basis for assuming the performance of public rites. Before the al 'Ubaid period (fifth millennium) such specialized buildings are rare. In this very specific sense there is as yet no evidence whatsoever for religion on sites of the Hassuna phase, and virtually none at Samarran sites. At Tell es-Sawwan the association in the earliest level (I) of unusually large buildings, said to be lacking in domestic debris, with numerous infant graves in which were found an extraordinary number and variety of alabaster grave goods (plate i) has led to the identification of these buildings as 'religious' or 'mortuary' structures (El-Wailly and Abu es-Soof I965; Al-A'dami I968). However, it should be noted that no other types of building have been reported from Level I, i.e. that all buildings have associated graves, and that plain coarse (?domestic) pottery has been recovered from them. The 'T-shaped' buildings of the later Samarran levels at Sawwan, at first also identified as 'religious', are now seen as undoubtedly domestic in character (Wahida I967; Yasin I970). At Samarran Choga Mami, despite the superficial resemblance of the standard house plan to later temples, the only evidence for 'ritual' activity lies in one small room (I 7 x I'7 m.) in each corner of which had been set a World Archaeology Volume 10 No. 2 Archaeology and religion</page><page sequence="2">I8 Joan Oates small orthostat. Before each stone there was a hearth; both hearths and stones, which showed signs of burning, had been carefully plastered over (plate 4b; Oates 1969: 19 and plate XXIV). Only at sites of the later Halaf phase is there persuasive evidence for religious buildings. The tholoi of Arpachiyah have long been interpreted in this light (Mallowan 1935), an assumption apparently confirmed by recent evidence of a special tholos precinct surrounded by an enclosure wall (Hijara, below). However, at Yarim Tepe II, the only extensively excavated Halaf site, round buildings are purely domestic in function (Merpert and Munchaev 1973: I Io). Another Halaf structure of possible ritual purpose was found by Mallowan at Tell Aswad in the Balikh basin in northern Syria (1946, fig. 2). This carefully plastered rectangular building was only partially excavated, but revealed unusual mud pedestals and, carefully set in one doorway, an ox skull, a feature reminiscent of similar traditions at Qatal Hiiyiik (Mellaart i967) and, much earlier, at Ganj Dareh Tepe in Iran (in the latter instance the skulls of wild sheep, set in a niche (Smith 1972: 166)). Burial practices If religion is defined as belief in spiritual or supernatural 'beings' or 'agencies', then burial practices may provide the archaeologist with his best clues, since ritual structures can well reflect public ceremonial which is not 'religious' in this sense. Here again evidence from Hassuna levels is minimal, though it must be noted that no Hassuna cemeteries have yet been discovered. Grave goods are rare, though not unknown, and the only unusual interments so far reported, 'dismembered' skeletons from the earliest level at Yarim Tepe I, may reflect no more than special burial rites (Postgate 1977: 318). Burial practices at both Halaf and Samarran sites, however, can only be interpreted in terms of some belief system which must fall within the 'supernatural' definition. Once again the Halaf phase is most informative, but the most striking evidence comes from the level I cemetery at Tell es-Sawwan. Here a very large number of burials have been found under and clearly associated with all the level I buildings so far excavated: in the lowest level of the Mound B sounding, to the west of the excavated buildings towards the Tigris cliff and on the northern fringes of the site (in the first season 126 graves were discovered under Building I alone). The grave goods consist of an extraordinary number of beautifully carved alabaster bowls, diverse types of predominantly female alabaster figurines, often with elongated bitumen head-dresses and inlaid shell eyes, animal figures, also in alabaster, a few apparently phallic objects, and beads of various materials (plate I; El-Wailly and Abu es-Soof I965: figs 66-74; Al-A'dami i968: 80-94; Yasin 1970: plates XX-XXV; colour illustrations in Oates and Oates 1976: o05). A high proportion of the graves are those of very young infants, a fact which is not as significant as often assumed, since relatively high frequencies of infant burials are not uncommon elsewhere (Tobler I950: III; Mallowan 1936: I8; Merpert and Munchaev 1973: 103). The Sawwan graves have also been cited as proof of 'ranked' society (Flannery 1972: 403) but it should be noted that all of the very large number of graves are richly and similarly furnished and that they include a significant number of adult and adolescent</page><page sequence="3">Religion and ritual in sixth millennium B.C. Mesopotamia iI9 burials (almost a quarter of the first season's graves were identified as adult or adolescent while in many others no bones were preserved). The significance of the figurines is difficult to explain since some appear to be male, and the rest are enormously varied in style, do not occur in all infant graves and are found in some adult and adolescent graves. One unusually rich grave in Building I (no. 25), which contained at least one adult body, was furnished with six such statuettes together with eight vessels, an animal figure, also alabaster, and turquoise and dentalium beads (El-Wailly and Abu es-Soof I965: 25). The richest of the Building 4 graves, that of an infant, contained three statuettes and seven vessels (no. 2oIa, Al-A'dami I968: 6o, 91). At Sawwan some alabaster objects have been found within the level I buildings as well as in the graves, which with a very few exceptions are confined to level I (Yasin 1970: io). No comparable statues have been recovered from any other site, though there are a few similar alabaster bowls in archaic Hassuna contexts at Umm Dabaghiyah and at Kill Tepe and Tell es-Sotto near Yarim Tepe (Kirkbride I973: 4 and plate VIII; Postgate I977: 3I9). Clearly the Sawwan cemetery was unusual and it would seem reasonable to assume that it performed some special function, perhaps serving a much wider area than the immediate environs of Sawwan itself. It is even possible that the prehistoric cemetery at Samarra, some 11 km. to the north, the site of which is now lost but which appears to have revealed no settlement debris, served a comparable purpose at a slightly later date (Herzfeld I930). Certainly both sites are similarly situated on the cliffs overlooking the river, and contain unusual numbers of richly furnished graves. The significance of the alabaster statuettes, however, and why the Sawwan cemetery was apparently of such short duration, remain inexplicable on present evidence. Several types of apparently ritual interment are attested on Halaf sites. One unique example, a collective burial of individual skulls in elaborately ornamented pottery vessels, is described elsewhere in this volume (Hijara, below), while at Yarim Tepe II (level VII) there is evidence for cremation associated with 'ritual breakage'. In one case the cremation of a 12-I3-year-old girl was carried out in a specially constructed oven. At the time of cremation six clay and three stone vessels were intentionally broken into pieces and thrown into the oven together with a variety of small objects and some hundred beads of gypsum, clay, rock crystal and obsidian. The burnt bones were later collected and placed in a large painted vessel. A second such cremation was discovered in the same level, and in the seventh season four more were identified in earlier levels, though these were not as richly equipped as those of level VII. This new evidence for cremation and ritual breakage raises the interesting question whether a similar rite may not have taken place in the TT6 'potter's shop' at Arpachiyah, where Mallowan records a number of 'cult objects' at one end of the room and where a large collection of some of the finest Halaf pottery had been smashed into tiny pieces and heavily burnt (I935: 99, io6). Ritual breakage is occasionally reported in later prehistoric Mesopotamia and indeed in Sumerian times, but in association with shrines (Oates I960: 45; Delougaz and Lloyd I942: i66 and fig. I25). Also of interest is the fact that a stone vase, deliber- ately broken in one of the Yarim Tepe II cremations, appears to have a long history as a ritual type (Oates and Oates 1976: io8; Frankfort and Jacobsen 1935: fig. 27; see also Parrot I960: plates 282, 348 (B) and the miniature alabaster vase from Tell es-Sawwan, plate ia; an identical clay vessel was recovered from an early Halaf level at Chagar</page><page sequence="4">12o Joan Oates Bazar, Mallowan 1936: plate I, 6). Ethnographic parallels suggest a variety of possible reasons for the breaking of objects as a funerary rite, from the releasing of the spirit of the object to accompany the deceased to ritual toasts, the prevention of quarrels among surviving relatives, or the destruction of the enemies of the deceased (Grinsell I96I). The most recent excavations at Yarim Tepe II have also revealed a number of possibly ritual hearths with associated animal bones, in which were found two of the most spectacular objects recovered from this site - an elaborately decorated zoomorphic vessel in the shape of a pig 30 cm. high (a smaller and less ornate example was found by Mallowan at Arpachiyah, 1935, plate Va) and an extraordinary jar, 15 cm. high, in the shape of a female figure with long wavy tresses down the back, reminiscent of the hair style of the recently discovered Arpachiyah ladies (fig. I, p. 126). Similar wavy-haired women or 'dancing ladies' also constitute a striking decorative motif on Samarran pottery (Herzfeld 1930: 11-2; Braidwood et al. I944: numbers 280, 292), a coincidence which strongly suggests some ritual common to both cultures. The unusual sherd from Choga Mami (plate 4a) may also portray a ritual scene (?dancing), but the true meaning of such symbolism lies beyond the perceptions of prehistoric archaeology. Also unusual, and reminiscent again of Arpachiyah, is the discovery at Yarim Tepe II of two separate adult skulls, placed outside the buildings in small depressions (Postgate 1976: 78). No comparable evidence for funerary ritual has been found at the Hassuna settlement, Yarim Tepe I, nor indeed at the few excavated Samarran sites. With the exception of Samarra and Sawwan, of course, no cemeteries have been identified, though some graves (often of infants) have been discovered within the settlement area of most sites. Thus it is impossible to say what, if any, special significance was attached to village burial, nor is it clear whether the few examples of mortuary ritual are genuinely rare. Clay figurines Small figures of baked and sometimes unbaked clay, both human and animal, are found in abundance on many sixth-millennium B.C. sites in Mesopotamia and indeed in even greater quantity on marginally earlier Zagros sites like Jarmo. Such objects constitute the category of evidence most widely cited in support of prehistoric religion, but their remarkable diversity undoubtedly precludes any single explanation of their purpose. With the exception of the archaic phase identified at sites like Tell es-Sotto and Umm Dabaghiyah, standard Hassuna levels, surprisingly, have yielded no figurines whatsoever, the few examples from Hassuna itself and those from Yarim Tepe I all coming from levels with an admixture of Samarran material. By contrast, there is a wide variety of Samarran figurines, of which perhaps the most interesting feature is the association of particular types with specific sites. Neither the cross-legged figures from Sawwan, for example, nor the ladies with flounced skirts of Yarim Tepe I have so far been found elsewhere (plate 2c, d; Oates i966a: plates XL, XLI; Merpert and Munchaev i973: plate XLIII). The ladies of Choga Mami constitute another recognizable group (Oates i969: plates XXV-XXX), though certain features such as 'coffee-bean' eyes and applique necklaces are shared with those of Sawwan (but not Yarim Tepe), and similar types, as yet unpublished, are said to be represented at Chogha Mish in Khuzistan (Delougaz and</page><page sequence="5">Plate r (a) Alabaster vessels from level I graves, Tell es-Sawwan, (b) Alabaster statuette, Tell es-Sawwan, bitumen head-dress, inlaid shell eyes, turquoise beads.

Mesopotamia 121 Kantor I973: i9I). The Choga Mami figurines are unusual in reminding us in many respects of later types, for example the 'lizard-headed' 'Ubaid specimens from Ur, while features such as hair style and ornament are identical with those on stone heads as late as the Jamdat Nasr and Early Dynastic periods (Oates i966b: plates I-IV). At each of the prehistoric Samarran sites so far excavated, however, not only is there a diversity of types but considerable individuality can be seen among specimens of the same type. A number of Halaf figurines have been found, both animal and human, and at Arpachiyah a comparable variety of types is displayed. Indeed Mallowan remarks that 'it is difficult to point to exact resemblances with the divergent forms of the "mother- goddess" found at Arpachiyah ... no one figure is identical with another' (I935: 82). At Chagar Bazar, however, there would appear to be a much more standardized type, a squatting figure with pinched head, the arms encircling the large breasts. These were sometimes seated on small stools (Oates and Oates 1976: 108), a fact which led Mallowan to see them as 'Mother Goddesses' depicted in child-birth (I936: 20 and fig. 5). Alone among sixth- to early-fifth-millennium figurines, this type has an impressively wide distribution, from Tell Halaf in the west to Tepe Gawra in the east, a distance of well over 300 km. A similar figure has been found at Yarim Tepe II, but here Halaf figurines appear to be less common than elsewhere. The largest group is very schematized in form (Postgate 1976: 78), a type found occasionally at other sites in the neighbourhood, Tepe Gawra and Chagar Bazar (Rimah survey IIo, Tobler I950: CLIII: i, Mallowan I936: fig. 5, 20). It has long been common to refer to all these female figurines as 'Mother Goddesses' or, at the least, 'fertility figures', and to see in them symbols of some widespread fertility cult. In questioning this view, two points must be emphasized (i) the great diversity of these figures, i.e. with the single exception of the Chagar Bazar type, there is no common 'standard' form, and (2) the fact that, with the exception of the alabaster statuettes from Sawwan, all such artefacts have been found in ordinary settlement debris. Only rarely do these figures reveal any convincing signs of pregnancy while many examples are almost totally formless (cf. Mallowan 1935; fig. 47). The exaggerated hips and breasts - and even these features are far from prescriptive - may represent no more than stylized convention. The ideal of feminine beauty is ever subject to whim of fashion, and one has only to imagine a Rubens nude transformed into clay to appreciate the fallacy of assuming that our prehistoric figures are necessarily fertility 'idols', at least in a religious sense! It is possible that Samarran site-specific types may symbolize particular deities associated with particular towns or villages - the pattern of historic times. But the general diversity of even these figures makes such an assumption highly speculative. It must not be for- gotten, however, that we are undoubtedly classifying together objects of different purpose, simply because they are made of clay. The almost certain presence of toys and 'gaming pieces' should not be allowed to obscure the possibility that some figurines may reflect a genuine religious iconography, or serve some apotropaic purpose, an undoubted function of some later Babylonian and Assyrian figurines. Whether the associated rituals represent 'religion' or sympathetic magic is another question. Ethnographic data provide a wide range of possible functions for such figures, from use in initiation rites, for instruction, as instruments of magic or witchcraft, as simple 'charms' or, often, as mere children's toys (Ucko I968; Cory x95I); they provide too</page><page sequence="10">122 Joan Oates some useful cautionary tales. The differentiation of dolls and protective figures, for example, clearly involves a degree of ambiguity, and archaeologists should note that neither American nor African dolls used for sympathetic magic differ stylistically from those used exclusively in profane contexts. The difficulty in distinguishing sacred from profane among such figures is well illustrated by plate 3c. These are three of a large variety of modern clay figures from Mymensingh in Bangladesh which, although some display features of religious iconography, are made purely and simply as children's toys. The resemblance to some Mesopotamian figures is startling (cf. especially Woolley 1956: plate 20; Mallowan 1935: plate V). Another instructive example comes from the modern Navaho, where a variety of animal and human figures, some of which closely resemble 'fetishes' found on archaeological sites in the area, are in fact made by children (Fewkes 1923). Here as in prehistoric Mesopotamia the majority of the human figures are female. Among the Tallensi in Africa the boys model the dolls and the girls play with them; among the Valenge the girls both model them and 'carry them about continuously, taking great care that they do not break' (Ucko I968: 422). Conclusions Although there can be little doubt that religious beliefs and rituals played an important role in the societies of sixth millennium B.C. Mesopotamia, surprisingly little unequivocal evidence for religion survives in the archaeological record. Part of the reason for this is inherent in the nature of archaeological data, yet even granting this fact of life, the relevant data are minimal. Evidence for 'ritual' is clear at Halaf sites, though the beliefs behind the ritual cannot be ascertained. The precinct at Arpachiyah was almost certainly 'sacred' but to what purpose remains unknown. Only at contemporary 'Ubaid sites such as Eridu are there buildings which, because they resemble the temples of historic times, can be identified unquestionably as religious shrines. Some community belief lies behind the Sawwan cemetery, but the significance of the alabaster figures, male, female and animal, remains uncertain. The very widespread occurrence of the bukranium motif on Halaf pottery, together with occasional bull's head amulets, has led archaeologists to speak of a 'bull cult', but a single ox skull at Tell Aswad provides the only hard evidence. The fate of the 'Mother Goddess' is even more certain. Although some of the figurines, especially among those from Arpachiyah, may have been 'charms' or purveyors of sympathetic magic in pregnancy, there is no reason to associate the vast majority of Mesopotamian figurines with any form of fertility cult, or even with child birth. We must conclude that despite some very interesting, at times even spectacular, evidence for what are certainly ritual practices, we know nothing of the 'religion' behind them. Perhaps our only consolation is the realization that even the more informative data of social anthropologists are often inadequate for the differentiation of 'natural' and 'supernatural' or 'ritual' and 'empirical' actions. 3.iv.1978 Girton College Cambridge</page><page sequence="11">Religion and ritual in sixth millennium B.C.

Mesopotamia Surprisingly little evidence that can be interpreted in terms of religious ritual or beliefs has survived from sixth-millennium B.C. Mesopotamia. From the Hassuna phase there are virtually no relevant data, and only the cemeteries of Sawwan and Samarra reveal the existence of 'religious' beliefs among Samarran communities. Halaf settlements have yielded evidence of both ritual activity and buildings, but there is no persuasive evidence for either a 'bull cult' or that of a universal 'Mother-Goddess'. Only with the earliest 'Ubaid villages in Sumer do we find buildings that can be described unequivocally as 'shrines'.</page></plain_text>
