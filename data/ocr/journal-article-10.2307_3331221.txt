<plain_text><page sequence="1">Article Review Modes of Myth MARION B. SMITH The Uses of Myth is the record of a symposium held during the Dart- mouth seminar on the teaching of English. The editor's introduction, "On Myth and Education," and Albert L. Lavin's position paper, "On the Meanings and Uses of Myth," are followed by the "responses" of the other members of the panel - William Wallace Robinson, George Cameron Allen, and Barbara Hardy, with additional comments by Paul Olson and Albert Lavin. The first task of this high-powered group of Anglo-American scholars was that which faces most readers of mythic literary criticism, to find out what they were talking about. Each of the experts had come to the Seminar, "dragging" in Olson's words, his particular "tin god from the pantheon of Modem Criticism - Leavis or Frye or Robertson or Klein or Freud." In the end, they chose to agree to differ, recognizing that the word "myth" means different things to different people and that MARION B.

SMITH in using it "they were not talking about the same thing but a series of things bearing a family resemblance to one another." Sweet are the uses of diversity, but in so short a book the facets of individual insight, however indicative of intellectual treasure, do not come together into the precious jewel of structured argument which might have resulted from a more unified discussion. "Myth" remains throughout as it had been at the beginning, a Greek story about the relationships of gods and men, the theogony of any culture, a narrative dealing with religious or cultural concepts, a narrative which embodies or symbolizes the received values of a particular culture, a phantasma- gorical story with psychoanalytical implications, or a tale which explains in anthropomorphic terms man's perceptions of the workings of physical nature or social life. When they came to discuss the uses of myth in education, however, all the speakers, despite their various interpretations of the meaning of "myth," agreed in their advocacy of caution. Myth should not be em- phasized at the expense of the central disciplines; it should be studied for its own artistry and its relevance to the human condition rather than as knowledge instrumental to the better understanding of literary allu- sions. We should not, however, fall into the perfectionist trap of insist- ing that learning about myths in translation is worse than not learning about them at all. Ancient myths may well have relevance for modern man, but tracing moder uses of ancient myths in current literature must not be allowed to degenerate into arid analogue-hunting, and students should also be made aware of modern myth-making and its significance. There has been no attempt, insofar as this reader can judge, to turn the materials of the symposium into learned articles. The papers and the comments on them are set down as tentatively or as vigorously as they were delivered, so that the book, brief and inconclusive as it is, has an engaging freshness. It is a record of exploration rather than definition, a probing into the relevance of myth for today's education. The three longer works on myth and drama have a narrower focus, but they nonetheless illustrate both the diversity of approach which characterized the Dartmouth discussions and the problems of emphasis and relevance with which they were principally concerned. On occasion each of the authors is misled by the fascination of the myth-hunt into distorting materials to fit a preconception. Sometimes, awareness that today's readers are not familiar with even the classical myths is made an excuse for prefacing critical comment with overdetailed narration.</page><page sequence="3">MODES OF MYTH 171 These three writers are at their best in demonstrating the ways in which myths, new or old, are used to develop a dramatic theme or to render the stage a more vivid mirror of the times. At their worst they sometimes neglect George Cameron Allen's warning that, in communi- cating the "impalpable essence" of myth, the minute used to "set the score" (allowing for "overtones") may be more important than the hour spent "crossing the t's." Though all profess to be discussing myth in drama, they all pay too little attention to the theatrical aspects of myth and to the reasons that, even more than in the novel, mythic themes, plots, and characters have become so significant an aspect of moder drama. With the exception of Professor Belli, who sticks to her critical last except where political doctrines are involved, these critics seem sometimes more concerned to preach or to prophesy than to analyze and evaluate, to judge the playwright from the philosophical and sociological rather than from the dramatic point of view. The tendency to moralize is especially evident in Myth and the Mod- ern Stage, though Professor Dickinson's approach to his subject is specific rather than general. For the purposes of his inquiry he defines "myth" as "those stories, immemorially old, received from the cultures of classical Greece and Rome, which deal not only with man's rela- tions with his kind, but also with gods and the supernatural in whatever form it may be represented." He limits his analysis to the work of ten playwrights ranging in "a roughly chronological order," from Gide to Ionesco. Six of these are French; four, if we include T. S. Eliot, Amer- ican. The professed purpose of the inquiry is to demonstrate how these writers adapted their ancient materials to give them modern relevance and, in terms of the contemporary theater, dramatic effectiveness "with- out succumbing to mere imitation." This is a laudable aim clearly and succinctly expressed, but over and over Professor Dickinson deviates from the pursuit of this goal to praise or condemn the world-views of particular writers. The introductory chapter, for example, promises us a discussion of "background"; what we get, after glancing allusions to Schlegel, Shelley, and Offenbach, is a long, impassioned and frequently illuminating examination of Nietzsche as man and philosopher. There is nothing, at this point, about the ways in which the Nietzschean mythology has become a part of modern drama or, indeed, about the problems of making myths, ancient or moder, come to life in the theater in terms which have relevance for moder man.</page><page sequence="4">172 MARION B. SMITH One of the ways in which the playwright copes with mythic material is to recreate it in his own image, a process which Professor Dickinson discusses in his second chapter, "Andre Gide: Prometheus as Puritan." Gide's treatment of myth is individual and psychological; his heroes are not the victims of fate but carry within them an "inner fatality" which drives them to their heroic exploits. Ironies of circumstance are directed not by chance but by unconscious choice, paradoxes of charac- ter have a psychological explanation not rational but discernible by reason, and "The Gidean hero is his fate, as, a generation later, the Sartrean hero is his freedom." For Gide, "myth is not miracle but motive." Focusing upon three plays - Philoctetes, King Candaules and Oedi- pus- Professor Dickinson sees in Gide's recreations of Greek myths a search for a new ethic which will release man from all moral sanctions outside himself and yet enable him to transcend himself. The ambiva- lences and paradoxes in which these plays abound reflect Gide's unre- solved personal conflicts, the poison and the antidote which, as he himself said, were present in all his writings. In his examination of Antigone, Orphee (both play and film) and The Infernal Machine, Professor Dickinson shows how Cocteau simpli- fied the Greek myths and stripped them, in presentation, to the bare bones of significance in order to justify his conviction of the superiority of "theater poetry," as direct sensual experience, to the metaphysical poetry of word and symbol. Jean Giraudoux, as the subtitle of his chapter, "In Tune with the Finite," indicates, is that rarity among the serious dramatists of this century, a playwright who takes an optimistic view of man, presenting, in his plays, what Francois Mauriac referred to as "a magnificent little [shorter?] catechism for humanists." This optimistic view, as embodied in Amphitryon 38's presentation of human friendship as superior to any happiness the gods enjoy, is less easy to sustain in tragedy than in comedy. In Giraudoux's two tragic treatments of myth, La Guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu and Electra it clashed with the perversity of life which has its roots in man's nature, in the ambiguous and imperfect motives which theologians regard as the taint of original sin. But for Professor Dickinson, Giraudoux's attempt to give dramatic expression in both tragedy and comedy to those myths which can be interpreted as displaying man as the measure of his universe is self-justifying regard- less of its success. "Giraudoux's love of humankind," he concludes, "is for me one of the most moving things in modern drama, and it does</page><page sequence="5">MODES OF MYTH 173 not become less so as his hope for self-achieved perfection grows more hopeless." As Cocteau attacked symbolism by means of myth, Jean-Paul Sartre uses myth to destroy those myths "which he regards as inimical to human freedom." This is abundantly clear in Les Mouches, which re- tains the story outline of Aeschylus's The Libation Bearers for the greater part of the action, then departs from it to make Orestes' double murder of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra the defiance of authority which must precede the attainment of freedom. In contrast to Gide, Sartre's heroes create their natures by their actions; their actions do not arise from the psychological complexities of their natures. Thus Orestes chooses the role of scapegoat, demonstrating his altruism and his commitment to his people by going into exile with all their sins upon his head. Whereas Cocteau uses myth to exalt art as superior to man and there- fore to life, Anouilh uses it to express his sense not only of the absurdity of life but of life as the destroyer of innocence and the ultimate cor- rupter of all purity, truth, and love. Professor Dickinson's ethical obses- sion is nowhere more evident than in his assessment of Anouilh as a dramatist: Anouilh is generally admitted to be the most expert playwright in Europe, possibly in the world, today. He seems able to contrive any theatrical effect he wishes: no mixing of emotional tones, no fusing of contrasts, seems beyond his artistry. He is limited only by his view of man and his valuation of life; but these limitations are so extreme as to invalidate his art. And that is only the beginning. Pages of denunciation follow, over- praising Anouilh's art and over-damning the view of the human con- dition it mirrors. Ionesco, the last of the six playwrights of the French theater to be considered, escapes damnation despite his insistence on the absurdities of the human situation and despite the structural deficiencies of the action of his plays, because his drama asserts his faith in the significance of man. Ionesco does not use myth in the same forthright fashion as the others; rather, he uses certain mythic elements so contemporized as to be unrecognizable at first glance. In Rhinoceros, for example, the mythical element is minimal, the faint but inescapable echo of the story of Circe's men turned beasts. It is this play which, for Professor Dickinson, most clearly exemplifies the "two propositions" of Ionesco's "dialect of the absurd": that man's duty to humanity is identical with his duty to himself, for to betray the one is to betray the other, and that constancy in that faith will not enable</page><page sequence="6">174 MARION B. SMITH him to say "I am free" or "I no longer fear death," but will affirm "something without which neither statement would have any meaning or worth." Professor Dickinson selects Robinson Jeffers as the first of his Amer- ican playwrights to be discussed although, by his own admission, Jeffers' "mythic" plays were either not intended to be performed or were "such as producers and critics have alike ignored." But it soon becomes evi- dent that it is not Jeffers's stagecraft or his use of myth per se, but his "inhumanism," his iconoclastic view of the human condition which fascinates him. The author's view that modem drama, and especially modern Amer- ican drama, uses myth to propound a deeply pessimistic view of man is reinforced by O'Neill's treatment of the Oresteia material in his trilogy, Mourning Becomes Electra, a work which he sees as presenting "life as a continuing horror" to which extinction is to be preferred. It is the chapter on O'Neill, however, which supplies at last the approach neglected in the other analyses, a discussion of the relationship of his work to prevailing tendencies in the theater of his time and to subsequent trends in "mythic" criticism. O'Neill is the first, Professor Dickinson asserts, "to attempt the transposition of classical myth into the theatrical style of modem realism" and to integrate the "mythical archetypes" into original materials rather than to make them merely suggest them. The trilogy's interlocking repetitions and ironic reversals, in which positive attitudes become their negative opposites, he sees as "demonic" in Northrop Frye's use of that term. T. S. Eliot, in contrast, does not integrate his myths into the form and action of his dramas, though their themes often suggest them. For him the myths are, as he said, "points of departure" rather than models. Eliot, in Professor Dickinson's opinion, fails to use myths effectively in his plays because his primary interest is in evoking "intellectual assent" rather than "emotional belief," in the "arts of persuasion" rather than the "art of mass illusion." Tennessee Williams is less successful in adapting classical myth to his purposes than in creating his own myths from the traditions of the deep south. His first attempt to use the Orpheus-Eurydice theme, in Battle of the Angels, was a disastrous failure, in part because he was unable to achieve a harmonious integration of mythic material and realistic treatment. Unwilling to abandon a theme which fascinated him, he rewrote the play several times until he was reasonably satisfied that he had said what he wanted to say in Orpheus Descending, though</page><page sequence="7">MODES OF MYTH 175 this play had a run of only sixty-eight performances. Realism was no longer a problem. Williams had abandoned that approach as long ago as The Glass Menagerie. Instead, the play is frankly theatrical, with prologue, formal chorus, direct address to the audience, and arbitrary lighting effects. Yet characterization is attributed in statement rather than presented in action and the tragic ending is inconclusive. Williams alters the myth so that Val-Orpheus dies for love of his Eurydice but does not make it clear whether in losing his life he has saved it. In his final chapter, "Myth and Mystery," Professor Dickinson briefly summarizes his conclusions about his ten playwrights who have used myth as the basis for "dramas which ... make serious statements about contemporary man by expressing, through language and the other arts of the theater, the inward significances rather than the outward appear- ances of his nature, actions and destiny." There, as in the chapters devoted to particular writers, what is lacking is any systematic explora- tion of the ways in which moder dramatists have used language and the other arts of the theater as well as structure, plot, characterization, and theme in their adaptations of mythic materials. It is a pity, for from a director of theater with so extensive a knowledge of the texts in per- formance we might have hoped to derive a mosaic of myth in the theater which set before us the problems of integrating the archetypal, the lit- erary, the critical, and the theatrical elements of modem drama and the ways in which these representative playwrights attempted to solve them. It is perhaps asking too much, but despite the richness of critical insight and philosophical inquiry provided for us in Myth and the Modern Stage, the book leaves us with the impression that Professor Dickinson is himself open to the charge he makes against T. S. Eliot, that he is less interested in drama than in doctrine. The structure of Angela Belli's handling of similar materials enables her to avoid some of the problems of unity and continuity which have beset Professor Dickinson. She focuses on particular plays rather than playwrights and groups them according to the author's approach to the problem of giving the universality of myth a particular relevance for our time and circumstances - psychoanalytic, religious and philosoph- ical, rebellious, political and social. Something of what she gains through structural patterning, however, she loses by the principle of selection her thematic approach implies, in that several of the plays she chooses to discuss are more representative of the particular "approach" under which they are included than of "modem drama." This is not to say that major works of major playwrights are neglected.</page><page sequence="8">176 MARION B. SMITH Professor Belli gives Cocteau's La Machine Infernale, O'Neill's Mourn- ing Becomes Electra, Eliot's The Family Reunion, and Sartre's Les Mouches, for example, careful attention, and some of the less-well- known plays, if they have not greatly influenced moder drama, do provide interesting insights into the possibilities of myth for political and social comment of a kind not likely to be welcomed by "the estab- lishment." A case in point is Professor Belli's analysis of the work of the "militant antifascist," Lauro De Bosis, who incorporated in Icare (1930) his view of the modem tragic hero as the bold venturer willing to hazard himself for discovery of the truth and its dissemination in the cause of human freedom. Icarus as a symbol of man's intellectual in- quiry is common to many Renaissance writers, providing both Marlowe and Shakespeare with a source of recurrent imagery, and De Bosis alludes, in a letter, to a sonnet of Philippe Desportes which praised "le jeun audacieux,/Qui pour voler au ciel eut assez de courage." In the same letter he says he has chosen this myth because it "incorporates, more than any other, the spirit of our time. Also, it has never before been made the subject of a tragedy." His Minosse is not only a tyrant in the ancient Greek sense of the term, but a modern dictator, using all the tricks of demagoguery in order to achieve his ambition to rule not only Cnossos but the world. He bribes Daedalus with false promises of a share in future conquests to provide him with a new and superior weapon -the metal iron, which the Athenian engineer and inventor fashions into a wondrous sword. His son Icarus is shocked that his father should let his invention be used for purposes of enslavement rather than liberation of mankind. Daedalus is the idealist who seeks knowledge for its own sake and who takes no responsibility for the use others may make of his scientific in- ventions. Icarus, the poet, sees his function as that of mediating between the material and the spiritual world, of spreading the truth to all comers of the world, of inspiring men to dream and to turn their dreams into "vital energized reality." Icarus therefore makes his flight alone; his father, lacking the vision, remains earthbound. It is Icarus who, like De Bosis himself showering antifascist leaflets on Rome from a borrowed airplane, shouts from on high his message of resistance to fate and thus inspires Theseus and his band of Athenian fellow-prisoners to believe that their sacrifice to the minotaur is not inevitable. Professor Belli's purpose is less all-embracing and her point of view more detached than Professor Dickinson's. While she is concerned with the dramatic effectiveness and the literary quality of the plays she dis-</page><page sequence="9">MODES OF MYTH 177 cusses she is not concerned with their purely theatrical aspects, and her emphasis is frankly thematic. She sees myth as "enjoying a unique existence outside the flux of time" and mythic materials as therefore liberating the dramatist to "create events and characters believable and relevant to contemporary experience" and to "bring heretofore unexplored meanings to the surface of the old tale." Within the limits set for it, Ancient Greek Myths and Modern Drama is a useful and interesting study of the purposes for which twentieth-century playwrights have used the materials of myth and, at its best, provides illuminating critical as well as philosophical insights. Father Porter's intention, as stated in his Preface, is "to examine American Drama in the light of its cultural milieu." "Myth," for him, is not restricted to the ancient legends of Greece but embraces all mythologies and folk tales in addition to the cultural stereotypes of our own time. The social and cultural "milieu" reflected in moder Amer- ican drama is a cumulative one, comprising not only "the immediate cultural situation" but also the entire heritage of Western culture - "in effect, all those attitudes, ideals and traditions that determine or affect values, supply strategies and pattern human activities." It is the common ground which makes communication possible between stage and audience. Thus Father Porter introduces us to a world of myth-in-drama both more general in scope and more particular in relevance than that of the two critics previously considered. The Orestes material, in Mourning Becomes Electra, and the use of the Alcestis myth in The Cocktail Party are discussed in the light of their relevance to specifically American life- patterns, the one as anti-Puritan, the other as denying "that indefinite progress is desirable and possible." Archibald MacLeish's J. B. is seen as using the unresolved questions of the Book of Job to expose "an ambiguity in American culture between an anthropomorphic view of God and a nostalgic view of nature." To an English reviewer, the hero of Death of a Salesman is an unpleasant "small man who has no creed in life beyond that of making money"; to the American critics, "Success is a requirement Americans make of life" and Willy Loman is a tragic figure because he accepts the "success ethic" without question and, in every instance in which he makes its assumptions his guide, it fails him. The myth is that celebrated in popular American literature from Ben Franklin's Poor Richard through the Alger books, Conwell's Acres of Diamonds and Dale Carnegie's personality-peddling to Bruce Barton's portrait of Jesus as a successful advertising executive in The Man</page><page sequence="10">178 MARION B. SMITH Nobody Knows. Death of a Salesman is the antimyth, the rags-to-riches formula in all its details, but in reverse. Similarly, A Streetcar Named Desire dramatizes the death of a myth- that of artistocratic and gracious living in the old South. In both plays dramatic tension is derived from the audience's ambivalence towards values they know rationally to be fallacious or obsolete but which appeal to their prejudices, their sense of romance, or their nos- talgic yearnings. It is perhaps this ambivalence which makes tragi- comedy (or more often, perhaps, comi-tragedy) the characteristic genre of modern drama. Other American "myths" in the plays Father Porter analyzes are: the detective story, in Sidney Kingsley's play of that name; the con- frontation of due legal process and the right to dissent in The Crucible, and the myth and antimyth of the small town or suburbia in Our Town and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? In his consideration of Wilder's play he discusses the theatrical aspects, in particular the stage-manager as Greek chorus-leader liberated to step into and out of the action under various personae. Albee's attack on the myths of success as the sole measure of worth, marriage as a romantic adventure, and adultery as fun and games is in accord with Northrop Frye's assertion that "as struc- ture, the central principle of ironic myth is best approached as a parody of romance: the application of romantic mythical forms to a more realistic content which fits them in unexpected ways." It sets the con- ventional romantic values of Martha's father, the university president, against the reality of "the games people play." In his final chapter Father Porter attempts to account for the failure of the American theatre to produce a first-rate dramatic masterpiece or a playwright of consistent genius, despite a number of promising starts. These disappointments and the associated decline of serious drama as popular entertainment, he sets down to the absence of epiph- anies and resolutions. Today's drama presents man's plight but offers him neither explanation nor assurance and very little hope. Its handling of myth may give man's universal perplexities a local habitation and a name but promises no solution, now or hereafter, in either the universal or the particular context. Polarities are left unreconciled, and there is no affirmation of the spirit of community; traditional values are demon- strated to be illusory and no acceptable substitutes for them are offered. We have quiet and remorse in plenty, but no regeneration. The fault is not in our dramatists but in ourselves- that is in our culture- that their message is despair.</page><page sequence="11">MODES OF MYTH 179 Writing at the end of a London theater season, one wonders why Father Porter regards the negativism of the drama as a distinctively American phenomenon. More and more one leaves the theater vaguely dissatisfied with plays-however effectively produced-which fail to communicate any clear view of the human situation or which are con- cerned only to communicate all too clearly its all too familiar despair. In addition to this general absence of hope, however, American play- wrights and audience, in Father Porter's view, have a particular sense of deprivation. Not only are they the prisoners of time, with its burden of quiet and isolation; with the loss of the frontier which gave prom- ise of escape and of new beginnings they have become prisoners of space also, and this without the consolation of putting down roots. The geo- graphical "milieu" is insistent and confining, but it is not "home." Father Porter's prognosis for American drama is as bleak as the plays he has analyzed. The ritual expectation of redemption through suffering which drama traditionally evokes is fulfilled only in second- rate plays and television serials; serious drama consistently denies them. Perhaps contemporary drama must evolve new patterns of convention and a new ritual if it is to survive.</page></plain_text>
