Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1993. vin + 430 pp. 188,00 DM.?In his initial dissertation (1991) the author asked the question of "naturali zibility" of self-conscience; in the following book he has already criti cized "naturalism" as a defect idiom. He takes language (the cognitive function of metaphors) as a tool of his critical strategy. He refers to the paradox of the anthropomorphic understanding of nature and the physiomorphic self-understanding of man. There are three main parts in the book. First, various naturalist strategies, starting with American Naturalism, are exposed. Human language has been characterized as an unconventional means of description of natural and factual contents ("nat?rliche Sachverhalte," p. 83). Three areas, or "paradigms," have been found exemplary for the "naturalism at work" (p. 107), evolution ary theory, psychoanalysis, and cybernetics. The next part centers in two chapters on the "language dualism" where there is a concept ten sion caused by the spirit-body problem and the two universes of dis course, in accord with the ideals of naturalism, should not be ontologi cally substantiated. In accord with the fundamental theory, one can assert a mentalist or a physicalist discourse, the language of action or of occurence, or also the intentionalist or mechanist idiom. The third main block of exposition analyses the two basic types of metaphors, namely, the anthropomorphic and the physiomorphic. Before starting his survey of five metaphor theories, Keil expressly rejects the Iconic Signification Theory. He is sure metaphors are hyper-conceptual ele ments of language. Two of the theories present more virtues than defects, the Theory of Interaction and the pragmatist Theory of Indirect Communication. At the end of these reflections the author confronts the metaphor of man as a machine with teleology and, on the other hand, thinks of problems linked with the human spirit ('Geist', not 'mind' or 'consciousness') as a computer metaphor. Two chapters form the finale of the book. In accord with Keil the concept of nature in the natural sciences seems to have died out resulting in "naturalism" becoming a conceptually unclear term. Another problem is causality, for the "propter hoc" is not unfolded in the world of bodies. Relations, including causal ones, are abstract entities. The notion of causality in nature cannot be counted as an intentional concept but, at the same</page><page sequence="2">664 GIUSEPPE BUTERA AND STAFF time, causal theories of knowledge and action cannot serve to natural ize intentionality. Keil's book is a thorough study. It includes a twenty-page bibliogra phy that goes up to 1991. His most quoted authors are the following (listed alphabetically): Aristotle, Blumenberg, Davidson, Dennet, Fodor, Habermas, Kant, Nietzsche, Quine, Ryle, Searle, Strawson, Witt genstein. Citations in English have not been translated into German which facilitates purposeful orientation in original terminology. Some terms the author often uses have not been included in the subject index (for instance, "artificial intelligence," "language dualism," "eliminative materialism," "spirit"). Confronting metaphor with the methodological monism of natural ism is a good idea. Thus several more general principles, such as an thropism, mental functionalism, intentionality, conventionalism of signs, dispositional concepts, could be included. To the traditional three metaphorical models (biomorphic, sociomorphic, and technomor phic) Keil adds, as an independent one, the visual version. Philosophy of religion has not been covered in this treatise as a potentially disputed area although it, in an important way, draws terms from this world to metaphorically express otherworldliness. Among earlier renowned authors in the field P. Ziff or P. Wheelwright were not mentioned. The book may be of interest for university courses, and in both criti cism of naturalism and an introduction to metaphor theories, it is a good guide.?Milos Dokulil, Masaryk University, Brno.</page></plain_text>
