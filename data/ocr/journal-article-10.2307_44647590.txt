Nuckolls Federal Aviation Administration Technical Center ABSTRACT Program SOM-LA (Seat/ Occupant Model - Light Aircraft) has been developed for use in evalu- ating the crashworthiness of aircraft seats and restraint systems. It combines a three- dimensional dynamic model of the human body with a finite element model of the seat struc- ture. The seat analysis has the capability to model large displacements, nonlinear material behavior, local buckling, and various internal releases for beam elements. The final phase of validation included simulation of dynamic tests of production general aviation seats. Model predictions are compared with test data for one of these seats. A DIGITAL COMPUTER PROGRAM, SOM-LA (Seat/ Occupant Model - Light Aircraft), has been de- veloped under the sponsorship of the Federal Aviation Administration for analysis of aircraft seats and restraint systems in a crash environ- ment. The program combines a dynamic model of the human body with a finite element model of the seat structure. It is intended to provide the design engineer a tool with which he can analyze the structural elements of the seat as well as evaluate the dynamic response of the oc- cupant during a crash. The original model was described in a re- port that was published by the FAA in 1975 (1)*. A number of modifications have been made to the model since then to improve simulation quality and add desirable output. Several testing pro- grams have been conducted by the FAA Civil Aero- medical Institute (CAMI) to provide data for val- idation of the mathematical model. The final model and its validation are described in Ref. 2, and instructions for use of the computer program, in Ref. 3. The purpose of this paper is to de- scribe the final phase of validation, which con- sisted of simulating dynamic tests of production *Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. general aviation seats. Capabilities of the pro- gram are described first, followed by a discus- sion of the actual simulations. OCCUPANT MODEL Program SOM-LA includes a three-dimensional model of the human body, which consists of 12 rigid segments, as shown in Fig. 1. The mid- torso, lower neck, shoulder, and hip joints are ball-and-socket type, each possessing three ro- tational degrees of freedom. The upper neck, elbow, and knee joints are hinge-type joints, each adding one degree of freedom. In total, the occupant system possesses 29 degrees of freedom. Resistance at each of the body joints is modeled using both a nonlinear torsional spring and a viscous torsional damper. The rel- ative contributions of each of these elements can be varied to simulate either a human occu- pant or an anthropomorphic dummy. In modeling motion of the human body, resistance of the joints is controlled mostly by viscous damping, whereas resistance in dummy joints is dominated by a constant frictional torque. The external forces that act on the 12 body segments can be characterized as either contact forces or restraint forces. The contact forces applied to the occupant are those forces exerted by the cushions and floor, illustrated in Fig. 2. They are calculated by first determining, from occupant displacement, the penetration of a ri- gid contact surface fixed to a body segment into either a cushion or the floor. Using this de- formation, the force is then computed using an exponential model: F = A(eb5 - 1) To each normal force, a damping term is applied which is proportional to the deflection rate. A variable damping coefficient is proportional to the instantaneous stiffness.

External forces of cushions and floor. are also applied by the seat bottom cushion and the floor. Each friction force is directed op- posite to the tangential component of relative velocity between the occupant segment and the appropriate cushion or floor surface. The method used in calculating the forces exerted on the body by the restraint system dif- fers considerably from that described above for the contact forces. The primary reason for this difference is that the restraint forces do not act at any fixed points on the occupant, but rather, the points of application vary with the restraint system geometry. Although other configurations can be se- lected by the user, a restraint system consist- ing of a lap belt and diagonal shoulder strap will be used as an example. The restraint loads are transmitted to the occupant model through ellipsoidal surfaces fixed to the upper and lower torso segments. These surfaces are shown in Fig. 3. The locations of the anchor points A., Ap, and A~ and the webbing properties are determined by user input. The buckle B for a single shoulder belt is located according to an input parameter which specifies the distance from the appropriate anchor point, in this case A., along the path of the lap belt. For a double-strap shoulder harness, the buckle is placed on the abdominal contact surface between its intersections with the thigh surfaces. Al' A2 A1 A2 Fig. 3. Restraint system configuration parameters. The restraint forces are determined in the same manner for both the upper and lower torso. First, the belt loads are calculated from the displacements of the torso segments, and the re- sultant force on each segment is then applied at the point along the arc of contact between the belt and the ellipsoidal surface where the force is normal to the surface. Friction between the shoulder belt and the chest along the length of the belt is taken into account by reducing the load in the belt between the chest and buckle by a constant fraction of the load in the free length between the anchor point and the body sur- face.</page><page sequence="3">CRASHWORTH INESS ANALYSIS 3 . 93 The capability of the point of application of resultant belt loads to move relative to the torso surfaces allows simulation of submarining under the lap belt. Characteristics required by the occupant model for each of the segments are the length, mass, center-of-mass-location, and mass moments of inertia. Also needed are the dimensions of body contact surfaces that are used for calcu- lation of external forces exerted on the occu- pant by the seat cushions or restraint system and for prediction of impact between the occu- pant and the cockpit interior. For two stan- dard occupants, a 50th-percentile human male and a 50th-percentile anthropomorphic dummy, all the required data are stored within the program. For other occupants, the above-listed data must be provided as input. SEAT MODEL The seat structure is modeled using the finite element method of analysis, selected be- cause it is not dependent on previous testing, and it has the flexibility to deal with a wide range of design concepts. The SOM-LA seat anal- ysis includes triangular plate elements, three- dimensional beam elements, and spring elements. It has the capability to model large displace- ments, nonlinear material behavior, local buck- ling, and various internal releases for beam elements. Nonlinear material formulation is based on a uniaxial elastic-plastic stress-strain law for beam and spring elements and a biaxial elastic-plastic stress-strain law (von Mises yield criterion) for plate elements. Internal releases for beam elements include shear (trans- verse sliding joint), moment (transverse hinge joint), thrust (axial sliding joint), and torque (axial hinge joint) releases. Also, a simple local buckling model for thin-walled tubes sub- jected to axial compressive and/or bending loads was incorporated into the program. This model simulates the reduction in bending rigidity of the tube as the cross section distorts during local buckling. SIMULATION COMPUTER PROGRAM The digital computer program based on the occupant and seat models described above has been written entirely in FORTRAN to ensure a high degree of compatibility with various digi- tal computer systems . During development, the program has been run on IBM, Univac, and CDC computer systems. Input data are read by the program in the following seven blocks: 1. Simulation and output control informa- tion. 2. Cushion properties. 3. Restraint system description. 4. Crash conditions. 5. Occupant description. 6. Seat design information. 7. Cockpit description. Cushion load-deflection characteristics are described by an exponential function, whose coef- ficients are provided as input data. The equili- brium (zero load) thicknesses for both the seat and back cushions are entered, as is the cushion damping coefficient for zero deflection. The restraint system used in the simulation may consist of the lap belt alone or combined with a single- or double-strap shoulder harness. A lap belt tiedown strap can also be included. The webbing force-elongation curve is approxi- mated by three linear segments, which are de- scribed by input of points on the curve. The force is computed by linear interpolation in this table. The slack in the webbing is also provided by input in units of length. The an- chor points for the lap belt, shoulder harness, and tiedown strap are located by input of rec- tangular coordinates in the aircraft reference system and may be fixed to either the aircraft or the seat. The aircraft crash conditions are defined by the initial velocity and attitude and the ac- celeration as a function of time. Six compo- nents of velocity are required: three transla- tional in the aircraft coordinate system and the yaw, pitch, and roll rates. Each of the six acceleration components, which define the mo- tion of the aircraft coordinate system, is de- scribed by up to 16 points in time and accel- eration. The input data required to describe the seat consist of nodal coordinates, material properties, cross-section geometries, element locations, and attachment conditions. For prediction of impact between the occu- pant and the aircraft interior, ten planes are used to represent the cabin surfaces. During execution of the program, the distance between each of the occupant contact surfaces and the cabin surfaces is calculated. When contact occurs, the relative velocity of impact is computed and stored for output with surface identification. The initial position of the aircraft occu- pant is computed for the input parameters shown in Fig. 4. It is assumed that the occupant is seated symmetrical ly with respect to the air- craft (X« - ZJ plane or, equivalently, that the body segment y axes are all parallel to the Y* axis. The angular coordinates y. (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) define the rotation of segments 1-4 relative to the Z« axis and, because of the symmetry con- ditions, segment 6 is parallel to segment 4. The angle y5 describes the position of the fore- arms relative to the upper arms. The distance Xn is the initial X-coordinate of the heels. Tne initialization procedure consists of seating the occupant in such a position that static equilibrium is achieved among the forces exerted</page><page sequence="4">3.94 D. H. LAANANEN, ET AL. U ' ' &gt; - XH Fig. 4. Initial position input parameters. by the seat cushion, floor, and either the re- straint system or the back cushion, depending on the aircraft attitude. Output data consist of ten blocks of infor- mation that are selected for printing by user input. The data include time histories of the following variables, which are stored during the solution at predetermined print intervals: 1. Occupant segment positions in the aircraft coordinate system (X, Y, Z, pitch, and roi 1 ) . 2. Occupant segment velocities in the aircraft coordinate system (X, Y, and Z) . 3. Occupant segment accelerations in the segment-fixed coordinate systems (x, y, z, and resultants) . 4. Restraint system loads. 5. Cushion loads. 6. Aircraft displacement, velocity, and acceleration. 7. Injury criteria (Severity Index, DRI, etc.) . 8. Details of contact between the occu- pant and the aircraft interior. 9. Seat structure nodal forces. 10. Seat structure element stresses. Printer plots are provided for occupant segment accelerations, restraint system loads, and cushion loads. The option of two different filters is provided for the occupant segment accelerations and cushion loads. Data are stored by the program for subsequent picture plots of occupant and seat position at user- selected times during the simulation. GENERAL AVIATION SEAT TESTS To complete the SOM-LA validation, CAMI conducted a series of dynamic tests with pro- duction general aviation seats, purchased from dealers of used aircraft hardware. The tests which will be described here utilized a seat with a frame of rectangular aluminum tubing. The seat and 50th-percentile (Part 572) dummy prior to the initial dynamic test are shown in Fig. 5. In order to achieve sufficiently high de- celeratile loading to cause deformation of the seat frame, it was necessary to strengthen the floor (sled) attachments. The modified right- front leg of the seat is shown in Fig. 6, where it can be seen that the track roller has been removed and the track roller housing has been pinned to an inverted steel T-section. The web of the T-section has been notched to permit pitch rotation of the seat leg. The two rivets that secure the roller housing to the lower end of the leg have been replaced by 3/16-in. high-strength steel bolts. All four of the seat legs were mod- ified in this manner. A general aviation-type three-point re- straint system was used, with the shoulder belt passing over the dummy's left shoulder and an- chored above and to the left of the seat, in a position typical of an aircraft installation. Forces were measured in both sides of the lap belt and in the shoulder belt, between the dummy and the anchor point. As shown in Fig. 5, a displacement transducer was installed to measure forward motion of the seat frame. For some tests a footrest was included, mounted at an angle of 45 degrees relative to the horizontal and bolted to a load cell. In tests simulating a flat air- craft floor, foot forces were not measured, as the feet are propelled away from the floor very shortly after impact. Accelerations were mea- sured in the pelvis, chest, and head of the dummy. The initial finite element model of the seat structure, illustrated in Fig. 7, used 28 nodes, 36 beam elements, and 2 triangular plate elements. The approximation to the cross sec- tion of the 6061-T6 aluminum beam elements is shown in Fig. 8. The tests given greatest attention in the simulations, because of bending in the seat struc- ture, were those conducted in a forward-facing configuration with a purely longitudinal 12-G sled deceleration (Fig. 9). Two tests, A81-110 and A81-111, were conducted under similar conditions which differed only in the inclusion of a foot- rest in A81-110. Results were similar except</page><page sequence="5">CRASHWORTHINESS ANALYSIS 3 . 95 Fig. 5. General aviation seat and Part 572 dummy prior to CAMI Test A81-108. that without the footrest dummy x-accelerations reached somewhat higher magnitudes. Also, in test A81-111, without the footrest, the shoulder belt load reached a higher value, and the dummy, rebounding rearward, caused failure of the seat back. This failure was not reflected in the model because the latching mechanism on the ac- tual folding seat back was more vulnerable to rearward loading than the finite element model, which assumed the frame to be continuous from the seat pan to the seat back. Examining the model in Fig. 7 and using the right-hand side of the seat as an example, the area in question is represented by beam elements connecting nodes 10 to 11 and 11 to 12. The cross section of these elements is that of the tubing shown in Fig. 8, rather than the thinner material actually used in the latch. This structure is further supported by a triangular plate connecting nodes 8, 10, and 12, resulting in a structure that is much stronger than the actual hardware. In the SOM-LA simulations, the impact of the rebounding dummy into the rela- tively rigid seat back produced a spike in the segment accelerations, particularly the chest, as shown in Fig 10. The effect of this impact with the seat back on occupant motion can be seen in the last two plots of Fig. 11. The finite element model was revised to more closely represent the structure in the vi- cinity of the seat back latch. This revised model is shown in Fig. 12. The short beam ele- ments that connect nodes 8 to 10 and 22 to 24 contain torsional releases to allow pivoting of the seat back about the lateral horizontal line from node 8 to node 22. Crushing or buckling of the seat back latch mechanisms is modeled by nonlinear spring elements that connect nodes 11 to 12 and 25 to 26. The revisions to the seat model reduced the severity of the occupant's impact with the seat back by permitting deformation of the latches (spring elements). However, at 0.237 sec, after nodes 9 and 23 at the top of the seat back had been pushed more than 5.4 in. rearward, the sim- ulation was halted due to ill conditioning in the seat stiffness matrix. Occupant position just prior to this time can be seen in Fig. 13 and the seat, in Fig. 14. Graphs of remaining SOM-LA predictions for test A81-110 (45-degree footrest) are compared with measured data in the Appendix. According</page><page sequence="6">3 96 D* H* IAANANEN, ET AL. Fig. 6.

Yielding was initiated at node 3, in the beam connecting nodes 3 and 4, and at node 5, in the beam connecting nodes 5 and 6. Fig. 15 il- lustrates the predicted progression of plastic deformation through the seat structure up to 0.115 sec, when the maximum stresses were reached. The maximum nodal displacements in the forward direction (at 0.115 sec) are listed in Table 1. For comparison, the displacement transducer measured a maximum forward displace- ment, at the seat cushion level, of 0.56 in. at 0.118 sec. CONCLUSIONS The Seat/Occupant Model - Light Aircraft (Program SOM-LA) provides a method for analyzing the performance of a seat and restraint system in an aircraft crash environment. The finite element seat analysis permits modeling of de- tails that can significantly affect seat and occupant response, as illustrated by the simu- lations described in this paper.</page><page sequence="9">CRASHWORTH INESS ANALYSIS 3 . 99 9 9 9 ^ ^ 9 t = 0.105 sec / ļ- - 0.115 sec / ® ■■■■ Yielded element ô Fig. 15.
