<plain_text><page sequence="1">Katrin Kogman-Appel The Sephardic Picture Cycles and the Rabbinic Tradition: Continuity and Innovation in Jewish Iconography The history of the Jewish art of the Diaspora re- flects and illuminates the religious, political and social encounters of Jewish minorities with non- Jewish majorities in their immediate environ- ment'. Often, the amount of cultural interchange is surprisingly large in view of the actual political situation. Although Jews were regarded as infidels in both Christian and Muslim Spain, their status varied considerably in the two societies. During the Ummayad dynasty and the Taifa Kingdoms (750 - io86) they were tolerated as dhimmis, nei- ther better nor worse than the Christians under Muslim rule. This atmosphere of toleration facili- tated a fruitful cultural symbiosis between the two religionsz. Although the Jewish population, under the Almoravid (io86 - 1146) and the Almohad (from II46 on) rulerships, was subject to violence and persecution, and looked for safety to Chris- tian rulers in the north of the peninsula, the recon- quista brought to Spain the Christian concept of serfdom and a tradition of anti-Jewish violence that had developed during the centuries and had culminated in the period of the Crusades3. The completion of the reconquista in the mid-thir- teenth century (only the small Emirate of Granada remained in Muslim hands) ushered in a recrudes- cence of the centuries-old tradition of anti-Jewish intolerance and culminated in the persecutions of 1391 and the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. The cultural encounters that took place dur- ing the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were therefore very different than those that occurred under the Ummayads. Unfortunately, no examples of Jewish visual art survive from the Islamic period to document the Islamic-Jewish cultural interchange. There are, however, echoes of the Islamic tradition in the fre- quent use of Islamic formal motives in the archi- tectural decoration of synagogues in Christian Spain, as well as in the exclusive preference for Is- lamic style and design. Jerrylyn Dodds has shown that this use of an Islamic formal repertoire in the later Middle Ages reflects both the high degree to which the Jews were integrated into Islamic cul- ture during the Ummayad dynasty, and an orien- tation towards the artistic tradition of the Islamic Nasrid dynasty of fourteenth-century Granada, of which the Alhambra is the chief monument4. The Jews never achieved the same degree of cul- tural integration in Christian societies, which scholars have characterized as &gt;persecuting soci- etis&lt;. Herein lies the basic difference between the 'Research for the present article was carried out at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in I993/94. I wish to thank Irving Lavin for his encouragement and interest. I am also indebted to Evelyn M. Cohen, Joseph Gutmann, Herbert L. Kessler, John Lowden, Elisabeth Revel-Neher and John W. Williams, who read earlier drafts of this paper and made numerous suggestions and comments. I thank Kenneth Neal for editing the english version. A shorter version of this paper was pre- sented at the International conference of Medieval studies at Kalamazoo, May I994. 2 Mark Cohen has recently published a study comparing the status of Jews under Islamic rule to their status un- der Christian rule. He examines both the myth of the &gt;Golden Age, of Sephardic Judaism during the Islamic period, as well as the revisionist countermyth of long- standing Muslim animosity towards Jews, and discuss- es the reasons for the difference in status.

The formal lan- guage of Christian art was never absorbed by Jew- ish artists, architects or patrons to the same extent as the Islamic artistic tradition. While, the Roman- esque and Gothic synagogues of Central Europe, such as those in Worms or Prague, do indeed re- flect the Romanesque and Gothic traditions in their decoration, their overall design and spatial concept have nothing in common with Roman- esque and Gothic churches. The following article will focus on another encounter with Christian art, one in which the exchange was strikingly dif- ferent from that discussed by Dodds in the case of the Islamic-Jewish encounter. Among the many documents of Sephardic cul- ture to survive from the Christian period is a group of illuminated Passover Haggadot from the fourteenth century. These contain continuous Biblical picture cycles preceding but disconnected from their texts - a feature also found in Latin Psalters from France and England from the twelfth to the fourteenth century. The following discussion will focus on two Passover Haggadot of Catalan origin6. The earlierst manuscript is the British Library's Golden Haggadah of ca. 1320, so called because of the diapered golf-leaf back- grounds of its miniatures (Fig. i, 6, 8, io, 14, 23, 25)7. It contains fourteen full page miniatures, adorning only the flesh sides of the parchment. Each page is divided into four framed compartments, and each compartment contains one or two (fol. 3r, Fig. 25, top left) Biblical scenes. The cycle follows the books of Genesis and Exodus, illustrating the Bib- lical history from Adam naming the animals to the dance of Miriam after the passage through the Red Sea. At least two artists seem to have been involved in its creation: the first painted fol. 2v to 9r (Fig. i, 6, 8), the second fol. iov to the end of the cycle (Fig. io, 14, 23, 25). The British Library has another illuminated copy of the Haggadah, to be referred to in the following as &gt;&gt;Or. 2884&lt;&lt; (Fig. 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 17, 19, 27)8. This manuscript, dated to the middle of the fourteenth century, differs stylistically and technically from the earlier Golden Haggadah, but bears a close iconographic relationship to its picture cycleg. It contains thirty-four full page miniatures, each di- vided into two compartments with one or two scenes a piece. The illustrations appear on either side of the folios. The cycle begins with the crea- tion of Adam and concludes with the dance of Miriam. Despite the close iconographic relation- ship between the two manuscripts, numerous dis- crepancies and a different selection of scenes sug- gest that Or. 2884 is not a copy of the Golden Hag- gadah, but that both derive from a common mod- elI'. Their relationship can be demonstrated by to the Alcazar in Seville and the style of the Abulafia synagogue derive independently from the contempo- rary Nasrid tradition of Granada.

As Narkiss's nomenclature of the Sephardic Haggadot is based on subjective, interprative consider- ations and reflects his own conclusions about their &gt;sibling, relationship, I should like to replace his names with more technical, objective designations. I thank Evelyn M. Cohen for her discussion of this matter. Sed- Rajna refers to Or. 2884 as the &gt;Catalan&lt;, Haggadah, a name also based on scholarly analysis rather than on the objective data of the manuscript, which contains no collophon and is therefore of uncertain provenance. Moreover, the name is somewhat confusing since the entire group of Sephardic Haggadot appears to be of Catalan origin. See G.

These two Haggadot belong to a group of Sephardic Passover manuscripts of similar charac- ter. Four other codices will be briefly introduced here, so that the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884 can be analyzed in the light of the entire group. Probably the best-known of the Sephardic Hagga- dot is the Sarajevo Haggadah (Fig. 12, I3, 16)". It contains the most extensive cycle of the group, with illustrations from the books of Genesis and Exodus. Two fragments, one preserved in Bolo- gna, the other in Modena, have been identified by Mendel Metzger as belonging to a single manu- script, known as the Bologna Haggadah'2. Stylisti- cally and iconographically it is closely related to the Sarajevo Haggadah; however, its cycle is much smaller, consisting of only a few Exodus scenes. Another manuscript of this group is housed in the John Rylands University Library in Manchester and therefore known as the ,Rylands Hagga- dah?'3. It has a close relative in the British Library, to be referred to in the following as ,,Or. 1404? (Fig. I5)'4. These two manuscripts share a similar style and selection of scenes (from the book of Exodus only), and their iconography is almost identical'. The Biblical picture cycles of these manuscripts reflect common compositional and iconographic patterns that are also well known from Christian Biblical cycles, indicating that the pictorial models derived from Christian scriptoria'6. However, these basic compositional patterns were enriched with numerous interpretative interpolations bor- rowed from Rabbinic commentaries of the Bible, known as Midrashim. The interpolations display a rich iconographic diversity, as well as a high de- gree of invention and originality. Whereas the Is- ,oNarkiss (as in n. 6), 77.

The Jewish illuminator in late medieval Spain was not interested in merely reproducing suitable Christian models, he also wanted to repu- diate the purely Christian interpretation of the Biblical history and emphasize the Jewish identity of his work. It is this aspect of the Jewish-Chris- tian cultural encounter that will be discussed in the following pages. The Sephardic Haggadot have hitherto almost exclusively been discussed in the light of Kurt Weitzmann's recension theory'8. Bezalel Narkiss established a stemma demonstrating a possible re- lationship between the manuscripts in question and distinguished two recensions stemming from a hypothetical thirteenth century Jewish proto- type'9. In this approach, the existence of one or more models and the process of copying played a dominant role. All the cycles in these manuscripts are marked to some extent by the interpolation of Rabbinic elements into their iconography, and it is this feature - common not only to the manuscripts in question, but to Jewish art at all periods - that leads Narkiss to postulate the existence of a com- mon hypothetical Jewish prototype. He considers these elements to be reminiscences of late antique Jewish art, transmitted via medieval Christian and hypothetical Jewish cycles.

Or. 2884, London, British Library, MS Or. 2884, fol. Iv, the creation of Man ing that all these depictions derive from a common late antique prototype. The assumption of a per- petual Jewish pictorial tradition was postulated earlier by Otto P~icht2I and is shared by many scholars of Jewish art. In recent years it was prima- rily Gabriella Sed-Rajna who dealt with the Sephardic cycles in the light of a potential late an- tique prototype22. Joseph Gutmann, however, does not accept the dependence of Jewish medie- val picture cycles on lost Jewish prototypes and observes &gt;a rich diversity of iconography and styles23. The following remarks will show that Sephardic late medieval illuminators, while creating Biblical picture cycles spontaneously incorporated nu- merous elements of Rabbinic Biblical exegesis in the iconography of their miniatures in an attempt to enlighten the specific Jewish character of their works of art. In most cases their acquaintance with the Rabbinic tradition leaves no doubt of their Jewish identity, although none of the manuscripts to be discussed names a specific artist. Suggesting that the illuminators placed numerous Rabbinic interpolations to enhance the specific Jewish char- acter of their picture cycles leads to the assump- tion that they did not exclusively rely on pictorial models, but rather engaged in various expressions of artistic invention and innovation. Like their Christian colleagues throughout the entire Middle Ages, the Sephardic illuminators used models for various reasons, some of which we may not be aware of. Certainly, this reliance on models had definite technical, practical and economic advan- tages, especially for an artist confronted with the task of painting a complete cycle containing doz- ens of pictures. Moreover, tradition played an im- portant role in medieval culture that is difficult for us to appreciate today. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to regard this practice as a meaningless, mechanical process performed by unskilled and uncreative artists. The manuscripts under discus- sion show a remarkable variety of approaches to models, Biblical texts and the exegetical tradition; no rules governed the artists' working methods or their appropriation and modification of pictorial sources. The Sephardic illuminator, when moti- vated to emphasize the Jewishness of his work, 20 According to a text by Paulinus of Nola this subject was depicted as part of the fresco cycle in one of the church- es at Nola, R.

Herein undoubtedly lies the contribu- tion of the individual Sephardic artist. Under these circumstances an exclusive reliance upon one or another research method can add little to our un- derstanding of manuscript painting; rather, each cycle in its own way reflects the peculiar historical circumstances and the cultural and religious at- mosphere in which it was created. On the following pages the cycles of the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884 shall undergo a compara- tive analysis revealing that they share common compositional patterns that are well known from Christian Biblical cycles. However, this compari- son also elucidates an iconographic divergence be- tween the Jewish and the Christian cycles on one hand and between the individual Jewish cycles on the other. It will be shown that this divergence re- veals itself primarily in the specific Jewish aspects of the iconography. This iconographic diversity is 457</page><page sequence="8">6. Golden Haggadah, London, British Library, MS Add. 27210, fol. 3r, Abraham in the fiery furnace especially striking when it comes to the very Mid- rashic elements and undermines the idea of their derivation from a common prototype. It is this observation of diversity concerning the Midrashic contents in contrast to a relatively high degree of conformity amongst the basic compositional pat- terns that leads me to the assumption that the ma- jority of Rabbinic elements24 appear to be the in- dependent creations of individual Sephardic art- ists working from Christian models, their aim ap- parently being to emphasize the peculiarly Jewish character of their art. The cultural, political and religious atmosphere of fourteenth-century Cata- lonia and the nature of the encounter between Jews and Christians provide the context for this working method. As one would expect, each artist chose a different method of achieving this aim, modifying his Christian models according to dif- ferent Jewish textual and pictorial traditions and his own imagination. Avoidance of the Anthropomorphic Figure of the Lord Diversity of method, with its consequent icono- graphic diversity, is clearly seen in the strategies used to avoid the anthropomorphic depiction of God so common in Christian picture cycles. God's intervention in the stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, and Moses can be indicated either by an angel, as in the Golden Haggadah (fol. 2v, 4v, Fig. I, iov) and Or. 2884 (fol. 3r, 13r), or, in a solution unique to the artist of the Sarajevo Hag- gadah- as golden rays of light emanating from the burning bush (fol. 2Iv). In the creation cycle of the Sarajevo Haggadah (fol. Iv-2r), divine interven- tion is represented by golden rays of light that emerge from heaven and touch the object of crea- tion. Concluding the creation cycle, the illumina- tor transformed the figure of the Logos resting on the seventh day, well known from Christian art5", into the modest figure of aJew resting on the shab- bat26. As these examples show, Sephardic artists of the fourteenth century did not share common conventions for representing the divine presence. For that matter, they did not agree on whether the taboo extended to other supernatural beings as well. The illuminators of the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884 saw no objection to anthropomor- phic angels and freely used them as substitutes for God, whereas the miniaturist of the Sarajevo Hag- 24 The textual sources of most of these elements have been dealt with exhaustively in former research. See already D. H. Miiller and J. von Schlosser, Die Haggada von Sarajevo. Eine spanisch-jiidische Bilderhandschrift des Mittelalters, Vienna 1898, and more recently, Schubert (as in n. 21), Narkiss (as in n. 6) and Sed-Rajna (as in n. 9). 25 There are several different types. The depiction in the Sarajevo Haggadah was inspired by the figure of the Logos resting on a bench or a throne, not a globe. Many of the Christian examples show the Logos resting his head on his raised hand and the position of the man's head in the Sarajevo Haggadah seems to suggest such a version as a model.

It is hard to imagine a common Jewish model that would have incorpo- ford, Bodleian Library, MS 270b, fol. 5v. The majority of Christian examples, however, show the Logos in a gesture of blessing, as in the English Psalter in Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, clm 835, fol. 8v. 26 A parallel to this iconography is found in an Ashkena- zic manuscript from the i5th century, known as the Sec- ond Darmstadt Haggadah, Darmstadt, Hessische Landes- und Hochschulbibliothek, Cod.

This portrayal of the resting Jew on the shabbat is not related to a creation cycle but to a liturgical poem referring to the shabbat.

Golden Haggadah, London, British Library, MS Add. 272IO, fol. 9r, Moses presented to Pharaoh rated all these approaches to the theophanic ele- ments; instead, the evidence suggests that these elements were created independently by individ- ual artists. Iconographic Diversity and the Midrash The scenes to be discussed in the following section illustrate how the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884 diverge in their rendering of Midrashic elements, despite the assumed common model. Both cycles include depictions of Lot escaping with his daugh- ters from Sodom (Gen. 19:24ff). Their basic com- positions reflect a scheme that has numerous me- dieval Christian parallels27; however, the Golden Haggadah (fol. 4v, Fig. i) assignsfour daughters to Lot instead of the customary two, as shown also in Or. 2884 (fol. 4r, Fig. 3). The appearance of four daughters illustrates a Rabbinic tradition that at- tempted to resolve a contradiction in the Biblical text: in Gen. 19:8 Lot describes his daughters as unmarried virgins, but in Gen. 19:14 he urges his sons-in-law to flee the impending destruction of Sodom. The commentators therefore explained that Lot had four daughters, two of them engaged to the sons-in-law and two still virgins28. This in- terpretation does not appear in late antique Jewish or early Christian art, nor in medievalJewish man- uscript painting. It seems to be unique to the Golden Haggadah29. The binding of Isaac (Gen. 22)30 appears in the Golden Haggadah (fol. 4v, Fig. I), but is omitted from Or. 2884. The miniature shows Isaac lying on 27 The basic scheme already appears in the Cotton Gene- sis, London, British Library, Cod. Otho B VI, fol. 29v, K. Weitzmann and H. L.

Mazal, Wiener Genesis. Purpurpergamenthandschrift aus dem 6. Jahrhundert. Vollstindige Faksimile Ausgabe des Codex theol. gr. 31 der Osterreichischen Nationalbibliothek in Wien, Frankfurt/Main 1980. Here Lot is accompanied by four persons: two daughters and two sons-in-law. This probably reflects another Rabbinic tradition, one in which Lot's wife was concerned about her daughters being married to natives of Sodom, who fled with them from the city. See Pirqei de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 25, G. Friedlinder, New York 1981, 186; Sed-Rajna (as in n. 9), 33; in the Byzantine Octateuchs Lot is also accompa- nied by four figures, but these are not easily identifiable as male or female; for example Vatican, Biblioteca Ap- ostolica, Cod. gr. 746, fol. 76r. The gender of the figures in the Golden Haggadah, however, may also be open to discussion and Sed-Rajna identifies the tall figures in the second row as the sons-in-law and relates this detail to Pirqei de Rabbi Eliezer and the Octateuch tradition. 460</page><page sequence="11">the ground, his hands bound, while Abraham kneels over him holding a knife. Abraham looks back to where a winged angel appears in a segment of sky; the angel points to the ram, which is hang- ing from a tree. The poses of Abraham and Isaac and the absence of an altar are entirely unparal- leled for this subject: the composition seems to have been invented by the artist of the Golden Haggadah. As the sacrifice of Isaac was of major importance in Christian Old Testament iconogra- phy as a prefiguration of the crucifixion&gt;', it is pos- sible that the Jewish artist radically altered his model to minimize its christological associations. Its omission from Or. 2884 suggests either that it did not appear in the common model or that it was depicted there according to Christian conventions that the illuminators of the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884 deemed unacceptable. The artist of the Golden Haggadah invented a new composition; that of Or. 2884 simply omitted the scene. The art- ist of the Sarajevo Haggadah (fol. 8r) also modified the common Western type, showing Abraham with a knife instead of a sword. The Hebrew ver- sion of the text refers to a knife (ma'akhelet), while the Vulgate specifies a sword (gladius), as shown in Western Christian depictions of the sacrifice. Despite its omission of the binding of Isaac, Or. 2884 contains a richer selection of scenes, especial- ly of Genesis scenes, than the Golden Haggadah, including some that incorporate Midrashic ele- ments. In the creation of Adam (Gen. 2:7, fol. Iv, Fig. 4), for instance, Adam is seen as a naked figure standing in the center of the composition. Two kneeling angels hold his hands, and two more an- gels stand on either side of him, seeming to touch his head. This group is flanked by four more an- r `~ .,~i. ~7""".' +?' ?~ ~~;i?! ?? 1 :._:z;c~?~:~;r;;~;ipI~C~kl~S-=%I~IC~~a~ : i??:?~11101FIi~7':~? ?i~ I 9?

This iconography is unique, and, as Ursula Schubert32 has suggested, probably represents a modification of a very common formula of the creation well known in medieval Western cycles. In the fifth-century Greek Cotton Genesis the dif- ferent acts of creation take place in the presence of The details of the costume are not clearly recognizable, their long hair identifies them as women, however, since young men in the Golden Haggadah are usually depicted with short hair. 30 For a general summary of depictions of the binding of Isaac in Hebrew manuscripts, see J. Gutmann, ?The Sacrifice of Isaac in Medieval Jewish Art,&lt; artibus et historiae, XVI, 1987, 67-90. Gutmann believes that the various Jewish depictions cannot be related to a com- mon prototype and that many rely on Christian picto- rial sources. 31 For a summary of the christological and the typological background of the binding of Isaac in Christian art, see for example H.

However, because the unique composition of Or. 2884 has no parallel, it is entirely possible that the artist of this manuscript or that of its model inde- pendently modified a Christian model. This image of the creation of Adam has nothing in common with the one in the Sarajevo Haggadah (fol. 2r), which, following a different iconographic tradi- tion, shows Adam sitting in the garden of Eden surrounded by animals. On fol. 8v of Or. 2884 there appears an extremely rare scene of the arrival ofJacob's sons in Egypt. It is accompanied by the following inscriptions: &gt;Joseph's brothers talking with the scribe&lt; and ?the scribe who lists at the town gate all those who come and leave.&lt;c The illustration (Fig. 5) shows a scribe sitting next to a gate and writing on a scroll; to his left appears a guard, and Jacob's sons ap- proach from the right. Although there is nothing in the Bible about Jacob's sons meeting a scribe at the gates of Egypt, Rabbinic commentaries men- tion that Joseph had established a regulation re- quiring visitors to Egypt to be listed at the gates, and even go so far as to identify the scribe as Joseph's son Menasse36. This scene has no paral- lels,37 and the possibility that it is an invention of the artist cannot be excluded. When closely similar versions of Midrashic inter- polations appear in both the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884 but do not appear elsewhere, we can reasonably conclude that they were created by the artist of their common model, and that this model was of Jewish provenance. The following scenes to be discussed focus on Midrashic interpolations shared by the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884, but unknown in other cycles. Both manuscripts con- tain a depiction of Abraham in the furnace of the Chaldeans, a scene that is not mentioned in the Bible but rests entirely on extra-Biblical sources. The legend of King Nimrod throwing Abraham into a furnace, from which he was rescued by an- gels or God himself, exists in many versions38. The two pictures share the same basic iconography and ii.

In both, the angels are in the fire and receive Abraham with open arms. The furnace in Or. 2884 is mis-drawn: no cylindrical shape can be discerned, but only orange flames forming a trian- gular shape. Abraham is pushed towards the fire from the right. This particular version of Abraham pushed into the flames and received by the angels with open arms has no direct parallels. A compar- ison with depictions from Ashkenazic and Chris- tian manuscripts reveals that there were many dif- ferent renderings of this subject during the Middle Ages, each of them probably reflecting a different textual source. As Gutmann has pointed out, the existence of a common prototype for all of them is rather doubtful39. Another Sephardic Haggadah, housed in the British Library40 has a marginal de- piction in which Abraham stands within a cave- like furnace, flanked by two angels with whom he is apparently conversing. The Sarajevo Haggadah does not contain this subject at all. Among Ashkenazic examples, we find an illustration in the Leipzig Mahzor (early fourteenth century)4' that shows Abraham on a stake, extending his arms toward the hand of God that emerges from the sky. Abraham's brother Haran and his father Terah appear before Nimrod, a reference to the Rabbinic tradition that Haran was cast into the fire as well. A kneeling figure in front of the throne, which occurs only in this manuscript, has been interpreted by Gutmann as a jailer who, in some versions of the story begs Nimrod to spare Abra- ham's life42. Examples of a vastly different charac- ter are found in twin manuscripts from Franconia (ca. I465-70), known as the Second Nuremburg3 and the Yahuda Haggadot44. They portray Abra- ham as a naked infant who, as indicated in the ac- companying rhyme, knew the Lord at the age of three45. He is seen inside a brick stove; an angel approaches from above.

It therefore must be a creation of the Sephardic artist of the common model. The Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884 also include unique depictions of Jacob's dream (Gen. 28:Iff). The most common Rabbinic element in this scene, frequently encountered from Late Antiquity through the Middle Ages, shows Jacob's head resting on three, four or twelve stones, symboliz- ing the three patriarchs, Jacob's four wives, or the twelve tribes of Israel46. However, the Golden Haggadah (fol. 4v, Fig. I) and Or. 2884 (fol. 4v, Fig. 2) omit this and illustrate instead a different tradition: two angels (three in Or. 2884) have stepped down from the ladder and seem to sit next to the patriarch and contemplate him. Another angel steps up to a window-like hole in the sky, in which the faces of one (Golden Haggadah) or two (Or. 2884) angels can be observed. This iconogra- phy combines a Rabbinic tradition with medieval Christian pictorial renderings of this scene. Ac- cording to the Aramaic Targumim, which elabo- rate the Biblical narrative (Gen. 28:Inff), the two angels who went to Sodom were expelled from the heavenly realm for having revealed the secrets of the Lord of the World. They wandered on earth until Jacob left his father's house, when they ac- companied him to Bethel. On the night of Jacob's dream they climbed the ladder and summoned their fellow angels to see this righteous man. The other angels then came down and contemplated Jacob. The miniature seems to show the contem- plating angels on the ground, with one of the ex- iled angels calling to the others in heaven. The 16. Sarajevo Haggadah, Sarajevo, National Museum, fol. 27v, the departure from Egypt &gt;window? in the sky recalls Christian depictions of this scene from the high and late Middle Ages where the bust of an anthropomorphic figure of the Lord appears in a similar opening47; however, this common iconographic type has been trans- formed to reflect a specifically Jewish tradition. The influence of the Targumim can be detected as tion um die Wende des ersten Jahrtausends und die alt- spanische Buchmalerei, Bonn - Leipzig 1922, fig. II.

The accompanying text reads ?angels of the king of the world climb up and down from the ladder? instead of ?on the ladder? as given in the Biblical text. The composition in general, however, has very little resemblance to those in the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884: Jacob rests on a pile of stones, there are only two angels and there is no &gt;windowe in the sky. It is therefore highly unlikely that a shared pictorial source can be taken into consideration. This doubt is con- firmed by the fact that the &gt;contemplating angel? is omitted in the Second Nuremberg Haggadah, the Yahuda Haggadah's twin and the accompany- ing rhyme does not recall the version of the Tar- gum49. Finally, the illustration in the Sarajevo Haggadah (fol. ior) has nothing in common with those in the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884. Another image peculiar to these manuscripts shows Pharaoh's daughter holding the infant Mo- ses in her arms and presenting him to the king, while the court magicians foretell that Moses will some day destroy Egypt (Golden Haggadah, fol. 9r, Fig. 8, Or. 2884, fol. izr, Fig. 9). In both pictures, Pharaoh sits enthroned on the left, surrounded by his counselors. Three women approach him from the right, one of them with the infant in her arms. The inscriptions in the two Haggadot are not iden- tical: in the Golden Haggadah it reads simply &gt;Bithia brings Moses before Pharaoh?, while Or. 2884 has &gt;Pharaoh's daughter shows Moses to Pharaoh? and ?the magicians say that he will de- stroy Egypt in the future.? The iconography de- rives ultimately from a tradition told by Josephus Flavius, according to whom Pharaoh's daughter brought the infant Moses before her father and laid him in his arms5o. The inscription of Or. 2884 appears to refer to another tradition known from Josephus as well as from various Midrashim and frequently depicted in medieval Jewish and Chris- tian cyclesS'. This tradition claims that one day the child Moses took the crown from Pharaoh's head and put it on his own. The magicians, alarmed at this performance, tested Moses by presenting him with a glowing coal and a piece of gold. If he took the gold, it would prove that he had supernatural knowledge and reveal him as the future savior of Israel. However, with the aid of the angel Gabriel, Moses prudently chose the coal and thereby suc- ceeded in passing himself off as an ignorant chilts .

These illustrations are certainly rela- 468</page><page sequence="19">cess as &gt;Bithia?, rather than the &gt;Thermutis? of Josephus, suggests that its immediate source was Midrashic. As these depictions have no direct par- allels53, they probably represent an innovation by the artist of their common model. It is interesting that the inscription in the Golden Haggadah makes no mention of the magicians and their pre- diction. Perhaps the artist of the model was unfa- miliar with the full version of the legend, and knew only that magicians had been present on this occa- sion or he knew a now lost version of the story about a presentation of the infant before the king. In both the Golden Haggadah (fol. I3r, Fig. io) and in Or. 2884 (fol. Isv), the plague of darkness (Ex. Io:2Iff) and the despoiling of the Egyptians (Ex. I2:35-6) are juxtaposed within the same com- position. This is based on a Rabbinic commentary, according to which the Lord gave the Israelites the ability to see the treasures of the Egyptians during the days of darkness54. There are no parallels to this particular rendering of the Rabbinic interpre- tation of the plague of darkness. The Rylands Haggadah (fol. i8r) and Or. 1404 (fol. 6r) include the despoiling of the Egyptians, but do not con- nect it visually to the plague of darkness. The same is true of the Second Nuremberg (Fig. ii)55 and Yahuda Haggadot56. They include pictures of the despoliation, which, unlike those in the Sephardic cycles, show Israelite women searching through the chests of the Egyptians and allude to the Mid- rash in an accompanying rhyme, the plague of darkness, however, is depicted few pages earlier7. Again, it appears that the artist of the immediate model of the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884 was responsible for developing an image based on the Rabbinic interpretation. In view of the lack of close iconographic relatives, it is unlikely that he relied on a visual model. '' i ~Sr~?3 ~i~JS :?~ ?.) ~,~"c~ ~3 1-: t C: r i~j~3 ji~ff~ .I.i~.l?

Second Nuremberg Haggadah, Jerusalem, Schocken Library, MS 24087, fol. 35r, Jacob wrestling with an angel An examination of the cycle of the Sarajevo Hag- gadah supports these observations. It includes a number of Rabbinic elements, some of which are peculiar to it and can therefore be taken as evi- dence of innovation. These elements occur pre- dominantly in those scenes that were not taken over into the cycle of the Bologna Haggadah, the close relative of the Sarajevo Haggadah that pre- sumably shares the same pictorial model. Indeed, the Bologna manuscript displays none of the Mid- ted to the Josephus tradition as well, but represent a different version of it.

Or. 2884, London, British Library, MS Or. 2884, fol. 8r, rehabilitation of Joseph rashic elements found in the Sarajevo Haggadah. Since the Bologna Haggadah contains no Genesis cycle and only a portion of the Exodus cycle, it is impossible to say whether the artist of the Sarajevo Haggadah or the artist of the common model, should be credited with these innovations. It is entirely possible that the common model was as limited in its iconography and its selection of scenes as the Bologna Haggadah, and that the Sarajevo artist not only expanded the model but was solely responsible for most of the Rabbinic elements in the cycle. Whatever the case may be, the Sarajevo cycle, like those of the Golden Hag- gadah and Or. 2884, bears witness to a Sephardic artist's attempt to enhance the Jewish character of his art. One representative example will demon- strate this point. The Sarajevo Haggadah contains a unique illus- tration of Cain murdering Abel (Gen. 4:8, fol. 4r, Fig. 12). Instead of the more common version in which Cain raises his tool over his brother, who has already fallen to the groundss, we see Abel on the ground with Cain to his right, holding his 20. Schocken Bible, Jerusalem, Schocken Library, MS 27084, fol. Iv, scenes from the books of Genesis and Exodus 470</page><page sequence="21">brother's head with his left hand and cutting his throat with a knife. Blood gushes from the wound. This imagery is inspired by the Rabbinic belief that Cain killed Abel in the same way as Adam had earlier killed an ox, cutting him ,&gt;at the throat and its vital organs&lt;59 in a manner reflecting the laws of ritual slaughter. As this depiction has no earlier parallel, it was probably created by the late medie- val Sephardic artist6?. Like the Bologna Haggadah, the Rylands Hagga- dah and Or. 14o4, whose cycles illustrate Exodus only, are surprisingly poor in Rabbinic elements. The few peculiarities that they borrow from the Jewish tradition do not provide conclusive evi- dence of innovation in these cycles. Clearly, the Sephardic illuminators took widely varying ap- proaches to Midrashic interpolations: the artists of the Rylands Haggadah and Or. 14o4 were relative- ly faithful to their Christian models, while those of the Golden Haggadah, Or. 2884 and the Sarajevo Haggadah took greater liberties. Common Jewish Conventions The Sephardic cycles do share a number of icono- graphic conventions that can be regarded as typi- cally Jewish. However, minor iconographic dif- ferences indicate that even these conventions have been approached individually by the artists. For example, the fourth plague (Ex. 8:2Lff, Hebrew text 8:I7ff) is always depicted as wild beasts attacking the Egyptians. This interpretation of arov - the Hebrew term referring to the fourth plague - cor- responds to the Rabbinic exegesis6', while Chris- tian renderings of this scene as a plague of flies correspond to the Septuagint and Vulgate transla- tions of this word62. Within the basic Jewish inter- pretation, however, the shape and character of the i i: ~~IHy~ ~7~ 1 ~=1?11~ 3~7~11 Y~II " ?' i' ~llis~ .?. .?I ~?~n ~-..rUU1, ,- nc;l~'~*njCr E?~~*PS-?- ' II ~if~l~f~i~l r~M ?trc~ ~ ?i~ .. ..t 1~ ~o~a .8? ;g~PSj rii:ll C~~ ia~6 ~--cr B: '~S~,;Sr~g~3!'~.~f~'t~iF~)~X~Ba6~.~jw~a~f.'l : * ii. ..? ??:?::'':?:?'ii: i' a ??4~ *? 1 ?*f "' "L~L~1~1~1 "i~:L; ""'' II .. ?'

The Sarajevo Haggadah (fol. 23v, Fig. 13) depicts snakes and scorpion-like creatures, recalling the commentary of the eleventh-century scholar Rabbi Itzhak ben Shlomo, known as Rashi and active in northern France: ?all kinds of wild beasts, snakes and scorpions,63. The parallels in the Rylands Haggadah (fol. i6v) and Or. 1404 (fol. 4v, Fig. i5) must rely on a similar text. The beasts in the Golden Haggadah (fol. I2v, Fig. 14), on the 58 Or. 2884, fol. 2r, for example, follows the common Christian type. This scene is omitted from the Golden Haggadah. 59 Genesis Rabbah (as in n. 28), 22:8, vol. I. 248. 60 The closest parallel occurs in the Castilian Bible of the Duke of Alba, Madrid, Palacio di Liria, fol. 29v, 1422-30, J. Schonfield (ed.), La Biblia de Alba, Madrid I992. It goes back, however, to a different Jewish source, the Zohar, Sepher hazohar lerabbi Shimon bar Yohai, vol. I, Jerusalem 1925, 54b, and shows Cain biting Abel to death, see C. O.

Although vultures do not appear in the Golden Haggadah, fowl of a rather fantastic kind occur in Or. 2884 (fol. 14v). The departure from Egypt - the most relevant subject in the context of the Passover holiday - is depicted in every cycle. With the exception of the Golden Haggadah, the Israelites are shown armed (for example in the Sarajevo Haggadah, fol. 27v, Fig. 16)65, in keeping with the Rabbinic interpreta- tion of the Hebrew text. The meaning of the word hamushim (Ex. 13:18) was unclear to the Rabbis; most authorities, however, understood it as ?armed&lt;66. The Sephardic versions of the depar- ture from Egypt indeed share most of their icono- graphic characteristics, some of which date back as far as a wall painting in the synagogue of Dura Europos from 244-45 C. E.67. The armed Israelites and the architectural setting that represents the land of Egypt both appear at Dura. The manu- scripts also contain elements that are not known from Dura, such as the raised hands of the Israel- ites, referring to Ex. 14:8 (,high hand"), to be inter- 64 Midrash Tanhuma Bo 4, vol.

ISV, Joseph meeting an angel preted in the sense of &gt;triumphant,68, or the out- stretched arms of the Egyptians, who seem to be waving to the departing Israelites69. An Additional Jewish Pictorial Source? The above examination of Midrashic interpola- tions in Sephardic Biblical picture cycles shows a great deal of divergence and indicates familiarity of the illuminators with the Rabbinic traditions and their conscious incorporation of these ele- ments into the cycles. Some of the Rabbinic ele- ments, however, possess iconographic parallels of different, sometimes rather remote origin. Two groups of such interpolations can be distinguished according to the origin of their parallels: such par- allels can be found either in medieval Jewish cycles or in late antique Christian ones. Both the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884 com- bine Jacob wrestling with the angel with a depic- tion of his family crossing the Yabbok. Besides some minor compositional differences, the scene in Or. 2884 (fol. 5v, Fig. 17) departs from the Gold- en Haggadah (fol. 5r, Fig. 23) in showing three little jars in the right corner. According to the Rabbinic interpretation of Gen. 32:25, Jacob stayed behind when his family left to cross the Yabbok in order to save some small jars which were his lawful 68 Sed-Rajna (as in n. 9), 94. 69The depiction in the Bologna Haggadah, fol. 6r, Metzger (as in n. 12), fig. 21, contains most of these ele- ments. This scene, however, is combined with the one showing the pursuing Egyptians; the waving Egyptians therefore are omitted and replaced by pursuing sol- diers. 474</page><page sequence="25">25.

This element is unknown in other Sephardic cy- cles, but it appears in the Second Nuremberg (Fig. i8)7' and Yahuda Haggadot72, as well as in a copy of a lost picture Bible of the late fifteenth-century Venetian Jewish artist Moses dal Castellazzo73. A further example of a relationship to Ashkena- zic Jewish art is the depiction of Joseph's rehabili- tation in Or. 2884 (fol. 8r, Fig. 19). Joseph is seen riding a horse, accompanied by attendants and musicians. This disagrees with the Biblical text ac- cording to which Joseph was driven in the &gt;vice- roy's chariot?&lt; (Gen. 4I:43); however, a rather rare and late Rabbinic tradition describes him seated on a horse and accompanied by musicians74. Paral- lels occur in a thirteenth-century Ashkenazic Bi- ble in the Schocken Library in Jerusalem (Fig. 20)75, the Second Nuremberg (Fig. 21)76 and the Yahuda Haggadah77 as well as in the copy of the Castellazzo picture Bible (Fig. 22)78. The entire scene is omitted from the Golden Haggadah; therefore, it is impossible to determine whether this iconography existed in the common model, or was introduced by the artist of Or. 2884 from an additional Jewish model, related in some way to the Ashkenazic cycles and the Castellazzo Bible. 70 Babylonian Talmud Hullin 9Ia. 7' (As in n. 43), fol. 35r. 72 (As in n. 44), fol. 34r. 73 Formerly Warsaw, Jewish Historical Institute, Cod. 1164, fol. 45, K.

In 1977, however, Joseph Dan demonstrated convincingly that this book must have been written in the early sixteenth century in Naples. See ,When was the Sepher ha-yashar Written? (Hebrew), in: Sepher Dov Sadan, Tel Aviv 1977, Ioyff; and his introduction to the above cited edition of the Sepher ha-yashar, 7ff. The Sepher ha-yashar is there- fore disqualified as a direct source for this image, 476</page><page sequence="27">There is reason to believe, then, that the Sephardic artists occasionally drew upon a supple- mental Jewish model, a &gt;relative&lt; of which must have been known to Ashkenazic illuminators and later to Moses dal Castellazzo. Our current knowledge about the dynamics of picture cycles does not enable us to determine the character or the origin of such a source. The parallels between the Sephardic examples and their Ashkenazic or Italian counterparts, though few, are nevertheless discernible and striking. It is to be emphasized that this Jewish model was not the source of all the Midrashic elements found in the Sephardic Bibli- cal cycles. Late Antique Reminiscences A small number of Rabbinic elements, finally, is paralleled frequently in late antique and medieval Christian cycles, which therefore suggests com- mon late antique roots rather than innovations by the Sephardic artists or an inspiration from later Jewish models. One such element is the presence of Rebecca in the scene of Isaac blessing Jacob (Gen. 27; Golden Haggadah, fol. 4v, Fig. i, Or. 2884, fol. 4v, Sarajevo Haggadah, fol. 9v). Al- though the Biblical text credits Rebecca with initi- ating the deception of Isaac, Jacob enters Isaac's room alone. Some Rabbinic commentaries, how- ever, postulate Rebecca's presence in the room and claim that she added a blessing of her own?79. This is a rare Rabbinic tradition and was apparently unknown to Christian commentators of the Bible; nevertheless, it became the most common icono- graphic type for this episode in Christian art from Late Antiquity on8?.

There is no parallel for this detail, and it may well be an addition by the illuminator of the Sarajevo Haggadah. The basic iconography, though, is certainly not an innovation; rather it follows a common convention, whose roots ap- though we may assume, that a version of this tradition existed in some earlier textual source. G. Vermes, Scrip- ture and Tradition in Judaism, Leiden 1961, 68 suggests that the Sepher ha-yashar is based on ancient midrashic sources. 75 Jerusalem, Schocken Library, MS 14940, Southern Ger- many, ca.

In the episode of Pharaoh giving the order to kill the male newborns of the Israelites (Ex. I:IS), we see two counselors next to the throne (Golden Haggadah, fol. 8v, Or. 2884, fol. IIv). This element also dates back to Late Antiquity and reflects Jew- ish roots84. The counselors appear in the depiction of this scene as early as in the synagogue of Dura Europos85 and soon became a common feature of the iconography of this scene86; their appearance in the Sephardic cycles cannot be interpreted as a conscious interpolation or innovation. A number of late antique reminiscences occur in the Joseph cycle. On his way to Dotan, Joseph, according to the Biblical narrative (Gen. 37:I5-7), meets a man who shows him the way to his broth- ers. In the Golden Haggadah (fol. 5r, Fig. 23) and Or. 2884 (fol. 6v) he encounters an angel instead of a man, consistent with the Rabbinic tradition which identifies the ,man&lt; as Gabriel87 or simply as an unspecified angel88. Most Christian cycles show a man, but an exception can be found in the Vienna Genesis, which contains two scenes related to this episode: in the upper register Joseph meets an angel; in the lower register, on the same page, he is seen talking to a man (Fig. 24)89. There is another striking connection to the Vien- na Genesis in the illustrations of Potiphar's wife attempting to seduceJoseph (Gen. 39:7ff). Accord- ing to Rabbinic tradition, this happened on an Egyptian holiday: while all the people of Poti- phar's house were assembled at the Nile, his wife pretended to be ill and stayed in bed, planning to seduce Josephgo. Like the Vienna Genesis (Fig. 26)9', both the Golden Haggadah (fol. 6v, Fig. 25) and Or. 2884 (fol. 7r) incorporate this tradition and show Potiphar's wife sitting in bed. The Sephardic illustrations also include Potiphar entering the house through a door at the left. As a similar figure appears in the Vienna Genesis a few scenes later in the cycle92, the Sephardic examples apparently represent a conflation. It seems unlikely that this is an innovation by the Sephardic artists and P~icht93 and Schubert9" have suggested a common pictorial source. It is indeed probable rather that their im- mediate model contained a similar version. A re- lated iconography also appears in a marble relief from the thirteenth century in Santa Restituta in Naples95. The Rabbinic tradition is reflected in the Sarajevo Haggadah (fol. 13v), though the detail of the approaching husband is omitted. This version has a parallel in a wall painting formerly in San Paolo fuori le mura, indicating a continuity from early Christian art96. Parallels occur in some Cru- sader manuscripts97, but most Western examples of the later Middle Ages depict Potiphar's wife standing in the door of the house98. Despite their richness in Rabbinic elements, the Second Nurem- berg and Yahuda Haggadot99 represent the more common Christian version. One of the pictures of the Joseph cycle in Or. 2884 illustrates the feast that Joseph gave for his 82 K.

Joseph and Benjamin sit at a separate round table underneath an arch, while the rest of the brothers are seated behind a rectangular table to the right. In front of Joseph we discern a large goblet. The picture is accompanied by the following inscription: ?Joseph who eats with Benjamin and prophesies with the goblet.? According to a Rabbinic com- mentary, Joseph, who had not yet made himself known to his brothers, pretended to use his goblet when placing the brothers according to their ages; the same goblet was later found in Benjamin's sack (Gen. 44:I2)Ioo. This scene is omitted from the Golden Haggadah, but there is a close parallel in the Sarajevo Haggadah (fol. i6r), whose cycle, as we know, is unrelated to those of Or. 2884, the Golden Haggadah and their common model. Picht cites two Christian depictions of Joseph prophesying from his goblet, related to a Joseph story by Ephrem the Syrian. One of these, a six- teenth-century illustration to the Greek version of the story'o?, shows Joseph and his brothers at a round table; Joseph is crowned and holds the gob- let in his left hand. The other, an early Christian version on an ivory pyxis from the sixth centu- ryI02, shows the brothers sitting at a small round table, on top of which the goblet can be discerned. Picht is certainly correct in thinking that the illus- trations in the Sephardic Haggadot hark back to the same late antique pictorial tradition as the two eastern Christian examples; it is unlikely that a similar iconographic type was independently in- vented twice. He errs, however, in concluding that the illustrator of Or. 2884 was unaware of the actu- al content of the Rabbinic tale. Picht's conclusion is due to a mistranslation of the accompanying in- scription: ?Josef sitzt beim Mahl mit seinen Briidern und gibt sich ihnen vermittels des Be- chers zu erkennen'oI3. The original Hebrew in- scription says nothing about Joseph making him- self known to his brothers; true to the Rabbinic source, it describes Joseph prophesying from his goblet. Not only was the Jewish illuminator aware of the meaning of his model, he even modified it to bring it closer to the Rabbinic tradition. Knowing that Joseph was supposed to have placed Benjamin next to himself, apart from the others, because they had the same mother, he depicted Joseph and Benjamin at a separate table, a detail omitted in the Christian examples and the Sarajevo Haggadah. The picture in Or. 2884 therefore reflects the Rab- binic tradition more precisely than the other ex- amples. Picht is also wrong to call the version in the Sarajevo Haggadah ?gedankenlos&lt;&lt;: the ac- companying inscription refers to the age of the brothers and thus to the same Rabbinic tradition. There is more evidence for late antique roots in the Joseph illustrations than in other parts of the Sephardic cycles. Independent Joseph cycles were quite common during late Antiquity and the Mid- dle Ages, appearing, for example, on the Cathedra of Maximian in Ravenna'04, in a group of Coptic Haggadah and Or. 2884 in other respects, as Narkiss has pointed out (as in n. 7), 63f. It is especially noteworthy that the scenes run from right to the left. 96 Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica, Barb. lat. 4406, fol. 46, S. Waetzold, Die Kopien des i7.

It is possible that the Sephardic Joseph illustrations ultimately derive from an independent cycle with late antique roots. However, late antique Rabbinic reminiscences are rare in other parts of the Sephardic cycles and con- clusions drawn from the Joseph pictures cannot be extended to the complete cycles. The foregoing analysis of Rabbinic elements in Sephardic picture cycles indicates that many of them should be regarded as conscious innovations by the artists, not as derivations of a common Jew- ish prototype. These artists relied on various Christian models, all of which were related in one way or another to the Western tradition of Old Testament illustration, but they were concerned with emphasizing the Jewish character of their work. They were well-acquainted with the Rab- binic tradition, and incorporated elements from it as innovative iconographic features, inspired di- rectly by the writings or oral interpretative tradi- tions rather than by earlier visual models. However, it can be observed that the methods of these illuminators, their approaches to the Rab- binic material and their motivation slightly varied. The artists of the Rylands Haggadah, Or. 1404, and the Bologna Haggadah were the least involved with the Rabbinic background. They remained faithful to their apparently Christian models and offered few if any modifications. It cannot be de- termined what their motivation might have been. Were they, for some reason, less familiar with the Rabbinic tradition than their colleagues? Might in these cases Christian artists have been employed? Were these illustrators told by the commissioners of the manuscripts to be faithful to their models? Was their appreciation of the pictorial tradition and the model different than that of the illumina- tor of the Golden Haggadah, Or. 2884 or the Sara- jevo Haggadah, who freely altered their models? Since no information about the identity of these miniaturists is available, we are unable to answer these questions. Our analysis reveals, however, that other artists were more concerned with the Jewish character of their art and introduced Rab- binic elements frequently and more freely. The artist of the first part of the Golden Haggadah probably altered the iconography of Lot escaping from Sodom and composed an innovative picture of the binding of Isaac. The illuminator of Or. 2884 was probably responsible for the specific render- ing of the creation of Adam and Joseph's brothers at the gates of Egypt; however, it is possible that these scenes belonged to the common model of the Golden Haggadah and Or. 2884. The artist of this common model must have been responsible for the compositions of Abraham in the fiery furnace, Jacob's dream, the presentation of the infant Mo- ses before Pharaoh, and the juxtaposition of the plague of darkness with the despoiling of the Egyptians. The artist of the Sarajevo Haggadah appears to have created the unusual iconography of Cain killing his brother and added further Mid- rashic interpolations. There is a possibility that a Jewish pictorial source was available to all these Sephardic illustra- tors. This same pictorial source - or more likely a version of it - might have been known also in Ger- many during the fourteenth and the fifteenth cen- turies, as indicated by the parallels in the Schocken Bible of ca. I300 and the Second Nuremberg and Yahuda Haggadot of ca. I465-70, several parallels with the copy of the picture Bible of Moses dal Castellazzo shows that a related version of this pictorial source must have been available later also 'o5 L.

II, Jerusalem 1994, 25-32. 480</page><page sequence="31">in Venice. This model was used independently by the Sephardic artists in addition to Christian pic- torial sources that they relied on. For example - the illustrator of Or. 2884 seems to have borrowed the little jars in the scene of Jacob wrestling with an angel and the detail of Joseph riding a horse at his rehabilitation. The parallels with Ashkenazic manuscripts and the Castellazzo Bible do not al- low us to make far-reaching conclusions about common roots or a greater dependence on com- mon pictorial models. The Ashkenazic, Italian and Sephardic cycles intersect at very few points only. For example, although the Second Nuremberg Haggadah and the Golden Haggadah resemble each other in some respects, their common de- nominator is extremely small. The interrelations between the Castellazzo Bible, the Golden Hag- gadah and Or. 2884 are more complex: they are rel- atively rich in Midrashic elements, and parts of the former clearly belong to the same iconographic tradition as the latter. However, their points of resemblance pertain almost entirely to their Chris- tian models; the number of shared Rabbinic ele- ments is exceedingly small. A few scenes rely upon much earlier icono- graphic types, indicating late antique Jewish roots. These elements include Rebecca's presence at the blessing of Jacob, the attendants who ac- company Pharaoh when he commands the slaugh- ter of the Israelite male newborn, Joseph meeting an angel on his way to his brothers, Potiphar's wife lying in bed, and the goblet at Joseph's feast. These have frequent parallels in Christian cycles and are unlikely to have been re-created independ- ently by the Sephardic artists. Their appearance probably is due to a further supplemental model, that was - strikingly enough - not known to the illuminator of the Second Nuremberg and the Yahuda Haggadot'I7. The limited evidence of late antique reminiscenc- es in the Sephardic cycles suggests that neither a late antique prototype nor its medieval offspring played dominant roles in the production of the cycles. Instead, the Sephardic illuminators used contemporary Christian picture cycles or model books which they modified and enriched with numerous elements that express a specifically Jew- ish attitude towards Biblical history and a specifi- cally Jewish interpretation of the Biblical text. The fact that they drew upon Christian models has no deep religious or cultural significance - these were simply the only models available. Admittedly, it is somewhat strange, even disturbing, to see a Jewish artist depicting his own sacred history through images borrowed from his persecutors: this may explain why scholars of Jewish art attempted to locate these models in a Jewish environment, in a late antique tradition that was passed on in Chris- tian as well as in Jewish milieus. This assumption, however, is difficult to accept in view of the fact that no Jewish cycles from the period between the third and the thirteenth century survived and only slight continuities can be observed between late antique and medieval Jewish cycles. It is precisely this gap in the Jewish artistic tradition, from Late Antiquity to the high Middle Ages, that explains the reliance on Christian models. Lacking their own tradition of Biblical picture cycles, Jewish artists had to rely on Christian models, as frequent iconographic similarities testify. But these Chris- tian models had to be reclaimed for Judaism; ac- cordingly, the artists, acting independently of one another but with the same motivation, altered them to reflect their own exegetical tradition, a tradition of which most Christians were unaware. In an act of liberation, so to speak, they trans- formed Christian images of Biblical history into Jewish images of Israel's history.
