<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lha: Towards Assessing Discontinuity in Paradigms of the Sacred by Francisco Ayll?n Presentation This paper presents a tentative proposal for an analytical/explanatory model on how the sacred (*) is conceived in Tibetan societies, within a historical perspective and with Bon always in the background. More specifically, the focus is on aspects of the tension between what are termed secular and clerical understandings of the numenal entities known generically as lha (2). An essential premise in the building of this model is the need, in the study of Tibetan Bon's early development, to draw on anthropology of religion and ethnology in an effort to counterbalance and complement the historiographic, textual approach. Secondly, and concurrent with this premise, is the need to place this field into a broader, comparative context, as much geographical, social and ethnographic as historical. Lastly, a case is made for incorporating thorny theoretical issues of human sciences, such as deconstruction or the criticism of Western ethnocentrism, in search of enriching points of view that add new perspectives for observing Bon, while trying in the process not to fall into yet another kind of dogmatism: a postmodernist one. In the end, the model proposed here is specifically presented as a tool for assessing the chances that Bon, whether arrived at from outside or evolved entirely from within the Tibetan plateau, may have introduced radical alterations on the preexisting spiritual milieu of the local peoples at some historical point in Zhang Zhung or early Tibet. i1) I follow the terminology for divine, Holy, numinous and sacred defined in Rappaport 1999. Since the present article deals with how the alleged existent object (the divine) of religious experience is conceptualized, I will deliberately ignore the pure, non conceptual aspect (the numinous) of the Holy implicit in that experience, and will be concerned instead with its discursive component which can be expressed in language: the sacred. Furthermore, I will avoid for the most part the use of terms as god, deity, spirit or spiritual, favoring numen and numinous instead. (2) Throughout the paper, lha, by reference to a simple, well-known traditional classification, will be understood as 'jig rten gyi lha (folk numens, generally rendered 'worldly gods', in contrast with the higher class myang 'das kyi lha which includes Buddhas and Bodhisattvas). [1] 31</page><page sequence="2">Problems in Translation The departure point for this paper was a professional translator's surprise when attention was drawn to what may seem but a tiny curiosity: in Spirit Mediums..., John Vincent Bellezza (2005) explicitly rendered in a number of occasions the term lha ri as mountain god. Some occurrences can be noted as example: 'The chief mountain gods {lha-ri) found in the pantheon of many of the spirit-mediums are [...]' (p. 16); '[...] the actual possession is overseen and regulated by the chief lha-ri (mountain gods)' (p. 74); '[...] an epithet for important lha-ri (mountain gods)' (p. 187); '[...] and the lha-ri (mountain gods) and other yul-lhd (p. 388). From a strict, conventional translator's view, this seemed a strangely anomalous translation: should not lha ri be god mountain rather than mountain god, just as bus school is not the same as school bus? Therefore, lha ri would indeed be an entity that is primarily a mountain (that is to say, something of a physical, material nature) rather than a god (something of a spiritual dimension). It is not a god that has something to do with a mountain. At most, (but I will argue that not even necessarily so) it is a mountain (a physical thing, I emphasize) that is viewed as somehow sacred. It should be noted that the standard Chinese translation of the term renders it in the a priori correct way: shen shan {spirit mountain), adding to the need for examining this problem more carefully. Some Distortions in Our View of Early Tibetan Paradigms of the Sacred In the same book, Bellezza reverses the order of the elements in his translation in cases as these: '[...] Gangs-dkar ti-se was the bla-ri (soul mountain) and mTsho ma pham the bla-mtsho (soul lake) of the Bon of Zhang-zhung' (p. 250); 'Jo-bo lha-ri (Elder Brother Divine Mountain)' (p. 234);'[...] in the classic iconography of the lha ri (divine mountain) yul-lhd (p. 173). The relevant question is if this case of seemingly anomalous translation of lha ri, revealing a somehow erratic nature or apprehension of the concept involved, can be seen as a symptom of a hidden misconception of Tibetan spirituality. Furthermore, this paper calls into question the very core of the concept: a spiritual being associated or identified with the mountain. Three Sources of Distortion Three sources of distortion affecting our view of Tibetan original sacred consciousness (original in terms of both historical antiquity and ethnic or regional roots) may be identified. I state them here in a rather crude manner; their content will be unfolded and elaborated further on: - First, a pre-imperial (3) priestly class (whether truely existent or fabricated later on and retrospectively imposed, it does not really make a difference) that, (3) Pre-imperial is understood in this paper as the time prior to the reign of Srong brtsan sgam po. 32 [2]</page><page sequence="3">serving the interests of legitimization of the lords or kings of Zhang zhung or of the Yarlung dynasty, would have embarked on a progressive subversion of the nature of the locally preexistent sacred legacy. This manifested as a variety of sophisticated and grandiloquent rituals and an inclination to reification (4) and deification. Such symbiotic relation between religion and politics is amply attested in the history of Buddhism in Asia (5). Similar patterns of political clerical alliances are abundant in World History. Indeed, the absence of that kind of mutual reinforcement in pre-imperial Tibet and/or Zhang zhung between the existent priestly class (belonging to a form of Bon religion or otherwise) portrayed in primary sources and the political leadership would be an anomaly (6). - Second, the rushing in of Tantric Buddhism from India following the collapse of the Tibetan Empire. Bon ritual creation remained active, now as the growing corpus of a clearly recognizable Bon religion, in a two-way symbiotic relationship with the new Buddhist Sarma movement in which both legacies nourished each other. The great artistic, ritual and symbolic complexity that esoteric Buddhism brought are highly suitable for theistic interpretations. - The third source of misconception is indeed that of the scholars' theistic, anthropomorphic religious patterns pertaining to a Western Judeo-Christian cultural (4) The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy 1994, 1996, 2005: To reify is to treat as a thing. To describe philosophers as reifying is usually to charge that they are misled by verbal form into thinking simply because some noun has a use, there must be something to which it refers. Thus Platonists are charged with reifying numbers or universals, and people are supposed to have improperly reified great varieties of things, including sets, infinite collections, finite things, sensations, physical objects, the future, the past, the possible, or the will of the people. The charge is itself not entirely transparent, and the fault these philosophies commit may more helpfully be put as treating things of one type as if they were things of another'. (5) For a brief overview on this, see Morris 2006: 74-76. A careful analysis of how such a process marked the arising and development of Indian tantric Buddhism is found in Davidson 2002. For an account of the royal-sponsored rise to hegemony of Buddhism in 11th century's Burma against a mysterious group called the Ari monks, with interesting parallels with the support of Buddhism in Tibet for supremacy over Bon, see DeCaroli 2004: 148-71. (6) Charles Allen (1999: 229-30) proposed a very interesting description of the development of Bon religion in three waves of foreign influence from Central Asia. The first one, around 500 B.C., included 'elements of Mithraist sun and fire worship and blood sacrifice'. He then identifies the second, shortly after 233 C.E., with the arrival to Zhang zhung of the ston pa gShen rab, 'a charismatic shaman who is both prince and priest', some of whose followers 'remain in Yarlung as shen to the Tibetan kings and are regarded as magicians with great powers'. In the third stage, around 500 C.E., 'what might be termed proto-Vajrayanists with strong tantric beliefs' would have brought 'complex, orally-transmitted meditational doctrines as well as Sanscrit and Bactrian texts. In Shang-Shung these new teachings acquire the patronage of the existing Iranian-Bactrian deities imported two and a half centuries earlier. Out of this fusion emerges Yungdrung Bon'. Allen is a writer, not a scholar proper, and his assumptions, looked at in detail, may prove wrong or right, but show how the arising and evolution of Bon on the Tibetan plateau could fruitfully be examined in terms of diffusion, change and political vicissitudes. [3] 33</page><page sequence="4">context. The ground for this was already well prepared (and had been so for many centuries) by the two previously mentioned factors (pre-imperial reification/deification and post-imperial 'tantrization'), so that the omnipresence of gods and deities was for Western scholars a totally obvious concept, with no need of any further scientific validation. It was a given. Two Biased Approaches The bulk of the encyclopedic work of those great Tibetologists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from which Tibetan religious studies are still amply drawing, is of a philological, textual nature. We continue to be fascinated by the impressive corpus of medieval religious textual material still to be translated (and more so in Bon studies). But they carry a view that was first politically constrained within the boundaries of a pre-imperial body of priests, and later of a tantric movement tightly linked to the power and traditional interests of the aristocratic families. In Ronald M. Davidson's assessment of Indian esoteric Buddhism, he warns researchers not to be misled by the partiality, even bias of the Buddhist textual records, but to look for every possible means of material findings for their external validation, and to give more serious consideration to the political factors that heavily contributed to shaping them and obscuring their real sources: Political and social realities, then, have been rarely applied to the formative process of much of this material, even though it has been examined in questions of its cross cultural transmission to other countries. Systematic epigraphy of medieval Buddhist venues is virtually unknown and questions of critical assessment are held hostage to systems privileging hagiography over intelligent history. [...] esoteric Buddhism has a very strong political dimension that is occluded in the modern Buddhist apologia. We are often privy of the conversations between religious and political authorities, conversations determining the outcome of specific traditions or the exchange of ideas and power. Even a casual examination of the documents reveals that the economic and political context was influential, sometimes overwhelmingly so. Indeed, the records of these conversations are not the humble textual artifacts from the personal expressions of enlightened saints. (Davidson 2002: 22-23). Very naturally, situations similar to these may well be present in the early history of Bon, which surely did not evolve in a sociopolitical vacuum. It is Bon tradition itself that uncompromisingly and proudly claimed about their lost glorious past: Thus this is one of the ways in which the king, the priest and the doctrine came into existence side by side on the earth' (Karmay [1972] 2001: 34). The second biased view is our Judeo-Christian frame of reference. If a politically, ideologically favored corpus of medieval ritual texts by an intellectual elite speak about and worship such and such lha, there was no need to doubt that Tibetans believed in gods: dozens, hundreds of gods. 34 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Mircea Eliade, not himself suspected of holding any extremist postmodern view of religious studies, expressed his doubts about the use of the word religion (7). Noticing its cultural specificity and lamenting that he lacked a better word to name the subject matter of his field, he pointed out that the term could still be regarded as useful, but precisely because it does not necessarily refer to beliefs in God, gods or spirits, but more fundamentally, to the human search for meaning and truth. The criticisms of ethnocentrism and of the theoretical excesses of a whole generation of formidable scholars in the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries have greatly transformed Human Sciences in the past decades (8). In addition, the deconstruction movement that Jacques Derrida initiated, with translation issues as a departing point, has further shocked the very foundations of the whole enterprise of this group of disciplines. This is not the place for a thorough examination of the fascinating ideological and methodological implications of the anti-ethnocentric, post-modernist, de constructive debate (9), but let me just choose some quotes from a recent publication by a philosopher of Religion to get an idea of the style of these criticisms, specifically on some points relevant to the present article's topic: Religion among primitive people is partly, perhaps almost entirely, the result of projection. The tendency of anthropologists to project their own gods on to the societies they investigate is already manifest in Herodotus. Without a trace of self consciousness he projects the gods and temples, or rather the theoi and hiera, of Greece, on the non-Greek nations he describes. Egypt, Persia and Syria were fairly easy; barbaric Scythians in the direction of Russia were more difficult, but he happily gives them gods with Greek names, Zeus, Ares and so on, and where there is nothing better available, describes large piles of brushwood as temples. [...] In modern times missionaries and anthropologists have credited primitive people with amazing deities. [...] Missionaries to the Marquesans reported that they had innumerable gods, 'one for every island, one for every fisherman' 2, and not only that but for every disease and every remedy, a goddess of syphilis, a god for recovery from syphilis and so forth. [...] Even the young girls have gods. They are the fingernails of their mothers. [...] Is any justification possible to applying the same word 'god' to all these things? [...] Evans-Pritchard uses 'witchcraft' to translate mangu, which actually signifies 'a material substance in the bodies of certain persons. It is discovered by autopsy in the head' (p. 226). That is certainly not what 'witchcraft' signifies in English and, as Evans Pritchard warns us, to speak of mangu as being for the Azande 'a supernatural agency hardly reflects their own view of the matter, since from their point of view nothing could be more natural' (Theories of Primitive Religion, p. 110).

Ronald Davidson (2002) gives a more cautiously balanced account of the same matters in his introduction. [5] 35</page><page sequence="6">Semantic and Etymological Considerations The primary meaning of the word lha lies in its association with that which occupies a high position, and so this word was selected to represent those realms of existence higher than that of human beings in the standard Buddhist cosmology. From here, the term was further employed to translate into Tibetan the Sanskrit deva, literally 'those whose situation is very easy and enjoyable' (10). Furthermore, the word is, by implication, also an epithet for persons who are higher than oneself, particularly like sovereigns, ministers, etc. Note that here we have an account of a transformative process of the meaning of the word under historical and religious factors. This implication can be further tracked in a number of ways. Particularly interesting is the trilogy lha klu gnyan gsum, that Samten Karmay comments upon amongst a number of threefold schemes 'Au niveau populaire' [at the popular level] (Karmay 2003: 69). What we have here is a division of space into three domains: lha at the top (sa steng), gnyan in the middle (sa bla) and klu at the bottom or in the underground {sa log). Other sources situate them in a more concrete relationship with the elements of landscape: lha would refer to the upper part of the mountains, the high summits; gnyan to the slopes and woodlands, the intermediate zone; and klu to the masses of water and the underground. From here the next step would suggest that the word lha and others, amongst which klu and gnyan are typical cases, were designations of geomorphologic features in some non-institutionalized contexts. One then has to explain in what manner they were reified to denominate something evocative of deities or gods. I contend that deliberate political movements linked to the glorification or legitimization of monarchs, aristocrats, lords, or clan lineages must have played a key role (n). Another fascinating field is that of etymological correlations between the words lha, bla and la. In fact, the word that is usually held to mean in a high position or from above is bla. But as it is well known, in textual sources lha and bla frequently appear interchangeably, and their semantic distinction seems to have been rather blurred in remote times. This interchangeability in turn speaks of the celestial connotations of lha, which, in ancient texts, are often found in relationship with other entities of clear celestial provenance, as phywa and mu/dmu/rmu (Stein 1961: 62-64), and leads easily to ideas such as high or from above. This should suffice to highlight that what we face is a problem of change over time, suggesting that the early meaning of words such as lha did not necessarily (10) Duff 2007, under the entry deva. (n) For a well documented case of a seemingly artificial clan mythology recreation in Tibet over time, see Davidson 2005: 267-69.1 am aware that to make up a myth of a family's descent from a divine figure is not the same as making up a divine figure from a geographical concept. The latter transformation involves a more complex matrix of social, ritual, historical and religious factors, but I remain convinced that in some instances, a careful search should reveal evidence of powerful political factors too. 36 [6]</page><page sequence="7">match their later ascriptions which were modeled to accommodate Indian Buddhist notions. At this point, let me tentatively suggest an alternative translation of lha: the substantive/adjective pair majesty/majestic (from Lat. majestas, as in Rudolf Otto's classic formulation of The Numinous). It is my hope that this will encompass all situations and stay more loyal to the Tibetan sense without over-imposing Indian Buddhist or Western Judeo-Christian notions. It keeps internal coherence (the same root for adjectival and substantive functions). Although the etymology only tangentially fits the idea of high or from above (it really means big, not high) (12), in Western languages it evokes the glory and magnificence that we confer to all kinds of things (highly respectable people, works of art, monuments, landscapes...), in what, albeit perhaps only partially, it matches the Tibetan sense of lha, with its strong associations with queens and kings. Consider some examples: majestic mountain {lha ri); majesty of the place (yul lha); majestic yak {lha g.yag); maternal majesty (mo lha); paternal majesty (pho lha). The Cornerstone of the Model: Secular versus Clerical (13) Both Bon and Buddhist religious traditions created and have perpetuated sets of dogmas and practices that were strongly conditioned by political agendas of propaganda, authority and power, and therefore may not reflect the real understandings of common people, either in present-day or in the ancient past. Anthropological research in particular is an essential counterbalance to avoid over focusing on the analysis of the textual record, in order to assess the extent to which the common people's beliefs are concordant with the official religious Establishment. A survey of forms of divergence between the secular and the religious systems regarding lha and other numens may reveal a very informative outcome. We need a sound understanding of how these kinds of diverging attitudes emerge in today's Tibetan areas and to what extent they can be traced back in time through historical records. An example is the mountain cult, which has been described as a lay affair in marked contrast with the official religious understandings and predating Buddhism (12) Harper 2001: From old French majeste ('grandeur, nobility'), and this from Latin majestatem ('greatness, dignity, honor, excellence'), stemming out from major (comparative of magnus, 'great'). (13) This is obviously to some extent an artificial distinction. If one ought to choose only one thing to summarize Martin A. Mill's analysis of authority and power in Tibetan societies (Mills 2003), this might very well be his remark on the blending between peasant and monastic processes of ritual, transformation and authority: Tibetan institutional Buddhism, far from suppressing previous lay conceptions, having in them its very foundation makes them an integral part of its structure and action, to the point that Ht is precisely the chthonic productive consciousness of the peasant that is truly hegemonic in Tibetan societies' (ibid.: 345). With this in mind, I wish to keep a low profile in my use of the words; I understand here clerical along the lines of its Middle Age meaning as 'learned men' (Harper 2001, under the entry clergy), and in contrast to it, secular as standing for 'non-learned men'. [7] 37</page><page sequence="8">in the region (14). I wonder on what grounds the appellation cult (13) is given to a gathering of men that can easily be described as a civic activity aimed to reinforce kinship, national, communal or ethnic identity, and ties with a sense of belonging to the land. For contrasting views about sacred entities, Martin Mills offers some relevant illustrative commentaries in a study of a Geluk monastery in a small village in Ladakh (India): Laity regularly spoke of household and local area gods with a warmth and affection that contrasted markedly with monastic disdain and ambivalence. Whilst householders spoke of their particular household gods and yullha as srungma ('protectors'), monks portrayed them as merely rogspa ('helpers'), otherwise capricious and vain, and certainly improper objects of refuge. (Mills 2003: 252). In another example, although modern scholarly literature has focussed at length on the Tibetan conception of spiritual entities embodied in people from their birth {skyes lha), the concrete nature of these in real secular communities is multifarious and not yet elucidated: [...] some or all of these [local] divinities formed the skyes-lha or 'birth-gods' that existed within the person's body from birth: they were born with (lhan-skyes) the person and will die with them. [...], the specifics of such multiple inhabitants varied, involving local area gods, household gods and clan divinities depending on local tradition. Their presence nonetheless marks individuals as being in some way part of specific chthonic and kin groups, although beyond this their precise function is unclear. (Ibid.: 255). From all that has been said, it is time to distill the essence of the criticism that is the basis of this attempt to formulate an analytical model for the idea of the sacred in Tibetan societies. I hope that at this stage I can easily be understood if I say that cliches such as 6lha means god7 or 'Bon is the indigenous religion of Tibet' are extremely simplistic characterizations (based on a variety of cultural, ideological, historical and scientific prejudices) that in certain cases can be misleading, at the very least. Reality is much more complex in terms of historical developments, social differentiation and (as we will soon see) geographical or ecological conditions. Firstly, provided the mutability of terms such as lha, bla, and la, it is hazardous to mechanically translate lha as 'god' or bla as 'soul', particularly in a proto-historic or early historic Tibetan context (16). A second dubious matter is how adequate the (14) See Karmay [1994] 1998 and [1996] 1998. A brief comparative description of a relevant class of ritual, the oboo-type ceremony, widespread all through Inner Asia, can be seen in Halemba 2006: 168-70. (15) Although there is nothing exceedingly religious in the etymology of the word (Harper 2001), its religious connotations among modern Western people are undeniable. (16) I would add that I find it quite surprising that the concept 'god' is also uncritically assigned equally to such a miscellaneous collection of things varying from something that is located on your left shoulder, through 'domestic gods' to powerful beings inhabiting whole great mountain ranges. I am 38 [8]</page><page sequence="9">adjective indigenous is, and I will briefly mention this later. Lastly, as we will see in the next section, researcher's flattening views also tend to erase the significant differences in the bosom of Tibetan societies regarding notions of the sacred, both in terms of social organization (what I call here secular and clerical is one instance of this) and of geographical or ecological influence. All this amounts to claims of giving much more consideration to factors of discontinuity, particularly when analyzing the early development of Bon on the Tibetan plateau and its impact on Tibetan paradigms of the sacred. The First Step: An Echo-cultural Paradigm There are many indicators of the predominance that the ancient native Tibetan culture gave to the elements of the natural landscape, fauna and geography. I referred earlier to the lha klu gnyan gsum as a key idea in Tibetan folk understanding of spatial arrangement. Another clear example is the interaction between a mountain and a lake, or sometimes a mountain and a valley, frequently invoked in the origin myths of the Tibetans (Karmay [1996] 1998: 432). The genealogical relationship between people and mountains is asserted specifically referring to the Tibetan kings (ibid.: 434). Familiar terms (grandmother, grandfather, ancestor, elder sister, father...), which 'are reminiscent of the genealogical relationship between people and mountain deities in the ancient cosmogonies' (Bellezza 2005: 388), are frequendy found as parts of the names of yul lha. The same is mentioned by Karmay in reference to 'local mountain deities' (Karmay [1996] 1998: 434). Indeed, in the traditional Tibetan societies there is a strong sense of identification of the person and the social group with the native land. While highlighting one point of tension between secular and clerical concepts in his research of the Ladakhi village, Martin A. Mills notes: [...] Ladakhi understandings about birth and the constitution of personal identity were not always couched in an individualistic karmic idiom. A person's link with the place they were born was often equally salient. As we saw in the discussions on the household and the attribution of ritual pollution at birth and death, persons also existed within the context of ideas of social and ritual jurisdiction and responsibility that were corporate in nature. (Mills 2003: 255). Secular Suffused, undifferentiated, non-anthropomorphic (in various degrees) Clerical Concrete, differentiated, zoomorphic or anthropomorphic also tempted to compare at least some of these entities with the multifarious elves of European agrarian societies, with which they seem to share features and behavior, and which we never call gods; but this is altogether a different matter that is awaiting further exploration. [9] 39</page><page sequence="10">And referring to sky es lha (the so called birth-gods): Their accepted presence implied an understanding about people's intimate connection to the place (zhi or gnas) in which they were born, a connection which occurred primarily through physical embodiment (luschan) - or birth - there. Similarly, notions of the life-essence' (la) of individuals and groups were often linked to specific places and geographical features [...]. (Ibid.: 256). This paper tries to posit that on the Tibetan plateau these links between numenal entities and spatial, geographic arrangement, besides (or even instead of) the cosmogonical and religious connotations usually assigned to them, may be better understood as social patterns that inform and regulate both self-identity as a group and individual behavior within the same social body. It also leaves open the question of whether at some point in pre-imperial times socio-ethnic self-identity, not religious matters, may have been the chief factor that conformed a knowledge system expressed as a lucid perception of people's dependence upon, and belonging to, landscape. I posit a hypothetical configuration in which it was not to a god, but rather literally and consciously to a mountain itself, that ritual action was addressed. From their point of view nothing could be more natural. Just as the study of butterflies must encompass much more than the all important task of hunting them, pinning them on boards and classifying them (how about their life, habitat, behavior, geographical distribution, migrations, evolutionary interaction with other insects or flowering plants...?), Bon studies are in need of a perspective much broader than the strictly historiographical, meticulous hunting, classifying and comparing of written texts. The role of Anthropology in general, and also of Anthropology of Religion in particular, can be truly invaluable here. Just to illustrate this point, and without any pretension of conclusiveness (given the huge scope of the kind of comparative, cross-disciplinary approach I advocate), I want to take time to present at some length the posthumous contribution of the anthropologist Roy A. Rappaport (1999), where at the end of his fatal illness he compiled more than 30 years of research and academic activity on the subject of ritual. His view of the genesis of religious concepts cannot be more unequivocal: [...] religion's major conceptual and experiential constituents, the sacred, the numinous, the occult and the divine, and their integration into the Holy, are creations of ritual. To put the matter into logical rather than causal terms, these constituents are entailments of the form which constitutes ritual. (Ibid.: 3). Rappaport's extremely detailed and extensive analysis of ritual, impossible to summarize here, draws from information theory, language and symbolization in human biological evolution, and the real context of his anthropological research in New Guinea and other colleagues' findings. On that basis, he sees the specific symbolic features of ritual as the very foundation of all religious ideas: 40 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Ritual is [...] the furnace within which the image of God is forged out of the gifts of language and the power of human emotion. This argument suggests that the idea of the divine, like that of the sacred, is as old as humanity [...] [...] the idea of the sacred is precisely as old as language and, [...] contingent upon each other, they emerged together in a process of mutual causation formally similar to, and in all likelihood concurrent with, that which is said to have organized the independent evolution of human intelligence and technology. [Ibid.: 399, 418). The key for understanding this special faculty of ritual to reify feelings or perceptions into religious beings and concepts is its performativity (17): [...] a performative expression which in its liturgical utterance establishes some cosmic entity, quality or power as a social or cultural fact makes it subsequently possible to construe that self-same expression as a statement. To establish God's existence as a social fact through the ritual recitation of, say, the Shema, makes immediately possible to interpret the sentence The Lord Our God the Lord is One' as a report or description of a state of affairs existing independently of the sentence or, at least, any instance of its utterance. [...] As far as present day society is concerned, Jupiter, Woden, En-Lil and Marduk are no longer anything more than figments of ancient imaginings, for no one continues to establish or re? establish their being by calling their names in ritual. (Ibid/. 279). Ritual, a symbolic act concurrent with human language, is therefore the very act that creates, and through careful repetition recreates or perpetuates, all religious conceptions. Rappaport explains that among the characteristics that define the divine (the ultimate entity that is perceived in the numinous experience and predicated by the sacred, i.e., God, Jupiter or lha) is its being: it is. Another is that it Institutionalized religion + Politics Reifying, deifying Ritual, performativity (17) A lengthy and didactic discussion of performative statements, with particular application to tantric ritual, is found in Mills 2003: 108-20. Rather than stating a formal definition, let me quote a couple of examples from these pages: Thus, the assertion "I now pronounce this couple man and wife", cannot be read as a recognition by the celebrant at a wedding of some kind of "marriedness" in the couple standing at the altar; rather, his authoritative statement acts to make them so. =[...]= So, while we may be hard pushed to say whether the statement "I name this child John James Ferguson", as uttered by a priest during a baptism, is true or not, this performative statement does itself become the basis for subsequent truth judgements. I can, after all, then ask of the child "Is he John James Ferguson?" and people will be able to say "Yes, he is", i.e. it is true that he is John James Ferguson. In other words, having happened, such performative statements become terribly important to our understanding of descriptive truth. Effective performative statements thus become moments of truth creation'. [11] 41</page><page sequence="12">seems to be alive. If the divine, as the sacred and the numinous, is a social convention established by the performative role of ritual, and if it is seen as a real, live entity, it follows that there can be no doubt that we are before an act of reification: The truths of nature, that is, of nature's regularities, must be discovered if they are to be known, but are the case whether they are known or not. [...] In contrast, the fabricated truths particular to humanity, verum, are true only if they are known, for they must be known to be accepted and are true only so long as they are accepted. We may recognize them to be truths of sanctity and that they are, in essence, moral. They declare the truths of 'should' against which actions and actual states of affairs are judged and often found to be wanting, immoral, or wrong. They also include expressions declaring the ultimate metaphysical ground upon which the moral stands; that, for instance, Yahweh is god and Marduk is not, or vice versa. They are the truths upon which social systems have always been built and in the absence of adequate alternatives continue to be built. (Rappaport 1999: 296). The political role of ritual and the religious concepts it establishes - their critical role in shaping and controlling social behavior - are delineated here, but we will visit these issues later. I mentioned before the hypothesis of an early configuration on more echo cultural than explicitly religious grounds. The idea is in itself a simplification and purely theoretical. It has not, indeed, been demonstrated for Tibetans. Also, although it is claimed here that much more ethnographic and anthropological research is needed, and then is to be integrated within the study of Tibetan religious History, and specifically Bon, I am well aware that no modern ethnographic finding can be simply extrapolated to, let's say, a Tibetan fifth's or sixth's century situation. An additional complexity is that there may not be a single explanation of general applicability for the whole Tibetan plateau, as we can infer from Agnieszka E. Halemba's study of the Telengits, a Turkic-speaking pastoral nomadic people in the ex-Soviet Republic of Altai (Halemba 2006). All throughout her book she highlights that secular belief systems, cosmogonical arrangements and rituals diverged greatly inside a single ethnic group and a single geographical area. This echoes views held by her colleges studying Mongolian and Turkish groups in Inner Asia. Altaians exhibit a notorious alternation, where the same numenal entity is perceived sometimes as an indefinite immanent force and sometimes with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic features. Furthermore, folk people's perceptions of their place and relationship with the landscape, and the nature of the sacred entities they believe in, may vary depending on whether they live and move through high, open grasslands or through rough, alpine, forested areas. She also depicts the circumstances on the Tibetan plateau: [...] local deities occupied the land before the Buddhist expansion; the land was encountered by the Buddhists not as a fixed or given, but as an agent with great potential for change and movement. These deities were sometimes equated with features of the landscape, so it was impossible to say if a particular mountain was worshipped as a place or as an abode of a certain spirit. (Ibid:. 70). 42 [12]</page><page sequence="13">This has important implications for our approach to the role of Bon in (allegedly) pre-imperial times. One of the points that Halemba emphasizes is plurality and alternation of different modes of perception of spiritual entities, different modes of their existence, different modes of spatial understanding, etc., within a single group and within a given geographical area. I have suggested here the view of an underlying secular belief system on the Plateau in terms of suffused, non anthropomorphic powers or agencies as a plausible position (18). From that view, we may consider the arrival and development of pantheons of anthropomorphic divine entities, a form of what later would become the Bon religion, as an intrusion. But there is also a possibility that they were still an internal development, for following Halemba, we should not necessarily expect uniformity of spiritual paradigms within the Plateau, but rather an all-changing situation with alternating views along the lines of geography, clan constitution or individual propensities is also a real possibility. The situation is further complicated since patterns of remarkable regularity are found along with change and ambivalence. Halemba's explanations of the term ee as a concept of masterhood that 'is found widely throughout Inner Asia, among both Turkic and Mongolian-speaking peoples' (ibid.: 63) seem to fit the Tibetan bdagpo (we will return to this later). Equally universal amongst all these Inner Asian groups is the stratification of the world into upper, medium and lower strata. This calls for looking at the wider perspective and for more ample comparative ethnic research regarding Tibetan belief systems, if we are to truly understand the early history of religious ideas and practices in Tibet in all their complexity. It also calls into question the claims made about one or another Tibetan belief to be indigenous (is Tibetan bdag po, 'master', indigenous?). The reality instead presents those beliefs more probably as a very complex matrix featuring internal multiplicity and alternation in the midst of universality. The Second Step: History, Ideology and Politics Loosely institutionalized Social forces, more or less intangible self-organization (in various degrees) Tightly institutionalized Politics-clergy alliance 'The king, the priest and the doctrine' Means for organizing: a) ritual; b) political (18) Consider these words from Giuseppe Tucci ([1970] 1980: 167): 'So infinite in number are the transcendental forces surrounding the Tibetans, so indeterminate for the most part are their characteristics that it is difficult to subject them to a fixed and intrinsically justifiable system of ordering. So it happens that the pantheon is continuously extended and regenerated out of the powers of imagination [...] = The numina of this type are not only ambiguous and indeterminate; at times they do not even have a name. They are then no more than a vague indication of a sacred presence. If one asks why it is better for one to keep away from a certain place, or how one should behave oneself there, then one receives an almost universal answer: "Because there is a lha (god, spirit) there"'. [13] 43</page><page sequence="14">Trying to assess (if we depart from the hypothetical presumptions presented in the last section) the historical and political factors that from the early days contributed to configure a corpus of fast-growing variety and number of gods, spirits, deities and demons, and their ritual paraphernalia, both in Bon and Buddhism, is a task of threatening proportions and difficulty. We have seen Ronald M. Davidson's assertion that the political involvement of Buddhism has been largely overseen by Western scholars on the subject (due, I remark, to researchers' particular biased propensities). In particular, tantric Buddhism appeared as a perfect affirming and manipulative tool for those who sought power. Davidson offers an extensive analysis of what he calls The Imperial Metaphor as the core of the development of tantric Buddhism in India, and the characteristics that made this spiritual force an ideal choice for medieval Tibet: Thus the Buddhist tantric movement is a consequence of the new culture of military adventurism, which brought the apotheosis of kings and their mandalas of vassals, with the concomitant feudalization of all forms of Hindu divinities. [...] Little wonder that the esoteric tradition should emulate in ritual form and ideological substance the most potent narrative of the period - becoming the Supreme Ruler of a circumscribed spiritual state. [...] the mandalas found in the institutional works were accepted and supported by the monarchs on the Indian borderlands, for they understood that Buddhist institutions had provided them with exactly the right combination of political and religious authority. (Davidson 2002: 167-68). Davidson notes that esoteric Buddhism, which had strongly appealed to the warlords of medieval India in constant bloody conflict, precisely due to the extreme political and social volatility in which it had grown there, found a perfect flourishing ground in Tibet: Indeed, it is paradoxical that the Tibetan emperors eventually looked at tantric Buddhism with much wariness and that the great period of the system's efflorescence in Tibet was not the result of the Tibetan imperium but of its collapse. [...] the institutional form of Buddhist esoterism served the purposes for which it was so well designed: the sacralization of feudal authority. (Id. 2005: 23, 142). Davidson is stressing, in fact, the political and historical reasons behind the unprecedented success of the tantric movement in Tibet. A Shift in Paradigms John Bellezza commented on one case that would be very interesting to investigate in depth as a possible exploitation spurred on by political motives: The srid-paxi sgra-bla are attributed with the defense of three important tribes of proto-clans of Tibet, the Phywa, dMu and gTsug. [...] Similarly, the lha-ri are also assigned the status of tribal and proto-clan protectors, but their ultimate ancestors are the Phywa. [...] This is allegorical evidence to show that the srid-paH sgra-bla 44 [14]</page><page sequence="15">occupy a more fundamental cosmogonic position then [than] the lha-ri. This crucial difference between the two classes of deities is used in Bon to theologically demonstrate that the srid-pai sgra-bla are a superior group. (Bellezza 2005: 388). One is tempted to conceive that at some point Bon religion assisted in assigning srid pai sgra bla a status higher than that of lha ri in a move to legitimate some leaders or clan lineages before others. Political motives behind a seemly artificial distinction between those groups of numens remain pure speculation. But it is not unreasonable to venture that a careful search of the beliefs previously present on the Plateau can reveal evidences of early priestly {gshen or bon po) transformative interventions throughout ritual on ideological or political grounds. A perfect precedent for such kind of much needed enquiry is found in a very intelligent study of the Naxi and Mosuo peoples in Yunnan (China) by Christine Mathieu (2003). The author submerges herself in very complex analysis of historical documents and ethnographic evidence, recurrently revolving around issues of political critical points in history and their impact in modeling mythical genealogies, genealogical chronicles, ancestral rituals and kinship status. Aside from the invisible, unconscious social forces, she strongly argues for considering the human, individual factor as an active, decisive agent of cultural transformative processes having profound implications: What I propose is an explanation for social change that takes place in political history, that is in real time and by the conscious agency of political will and exigencies. [...] the Naxi chiefs initiated social change by purposefully manipulating key elements of tradition - kinship, mythology and ritual. [Ibid.: 37-38). If one has to understand Bon traditional sources relative to Tibetan Bon inception as arrived from outside as true (or at least based on real facts, however later distorted), then there is relevance in asking whether the apparition of Bon on the Plateau might have sparked a process of deification (conversion into deities) of geographical entities and/or immanent forces conforming the identity, sense of belonging and ritual behavior of Tibetans, a process which was alien to them. A slightly different interpretation is also possible: that Bon on the Plateau started from within at some point in history. An internal deification process would still be very plausible in view of Halemba's descriptions of variability of beliefs within a single human group. In the first case, the very intrusion of elements from an external polytheistic religion would by itself imply such a change of paradigms. In the second case, other internal circumstances (social, political...) should be identified. Over the centuries, this hypothetical rarefaction, would meet two strong reinforcements: First, later interpretations that made those spiritual conceptions fit into newly imported Buddhist cosmological and ideological systems (see, for instance, Buffetrille 1998). Instances of well documented cases of story re-elaboration, and of [15] 45</page><page sequence="16">manipulation or invention of religious texts in Tibet are abundant enough; these activities were often fruit of political motives and at times prevalent (19). Examples of intermingling of Buddhist ideology with the seemingly pre-Buddhist notions are notorious: I never witnessed any offering rites to bodily birth-gods, who were not regarded as being 'persons' (gangzag) in the same way that the external deities they represented were. However, Dagyab Rinpoche (1995: 95-96) refers to offering rites to such gods - which he refers to as 'the gods born together with [the offerer]' and other divinities and spirits as a means of repaying karmic debts to such beings. (Mills 2003: 256). Secondly, there is the intellectual bias from Western adventurers and scholars. The case of prostration seems a good example of combined Buddhist-Western distortion. Western people are readily open to believe the explanation of prostration which has been repeated by institutional religious masters as a practice for overcoming pride, purifying negative karmic traces, creating merit and showing submission to powers greater than ourselves. Much to the contrary however, as we will see later, if we focus on the other extreme (the secular) in the tense pair of institutionalized and non-institutionalized knowledge, the act of prostration can also be understood within totally different parameters: it fits very well into a reference frame of total impregnation of people with land. In her account of the Altaian peoples, Agnieszka E. Halemba makes a point of repeatedly declaring her view that the people and land are often simply not differentiated at all: The relationship between the Altai and its people goes beyond the object-subject division. It is probably unwise to use the word 'between' here at all because it presupposes ontological existence of two spheres - between which the relation can be established, broken, sustained or abandoned. Instead, the Altaians and the Altai are so tightly bound up that at times they cannot be considered as ontologically separate. The more accurate phrasing would probably be that personhood includes the Altai just as it includes parts of the body, emotions, hopes, feelings and sensual abilities. This is to say more than just to acknowledge that the Altai is a spiritual being, a subject with consciousness and intentionality. Instead, people and land are one. (Halemba 2006: 18). What is most interesting of Halemba's work is that she believes the Telengits, and the Altaian society as a whole, to be on the brink of a change of paradigmatic importance in their conception of the sacred. After decades of direct suppression of religious activities under the Soviet era, the Altaians have a growing sense of urgency to reaffirm both their national character and religious self-identity. Halemba describes the situation as a difficult step for a society that understands the spiritual (19) Ronald M. Davidson's (2005) extensive analysis of the Sarma movement after the collapse of the Tibetan Empire is particularly blunt and bright in this respect. In particular, he (ibid.: 232-35) illustrates how entire tantric texts were in all probability newly tailored on the spot on a significant scale. 46 [16]</page><page sequence="17">world as full of flexibility, vagueness and mobility, when the situation advocated by those promoting national unification requires a completely new perspective: that of fixing the spirits and stabilizing the whole spiritual and existential milieu that informs people's lives. One key element of this tension is the issue of accepting or rejecting the persistent attempts of introducing Buddhism, which has always been marginal in the area: [...] I argue that the very fact of stabilizing the spirits, fixing their images and naming them, points towards a paradigm shift that had already happened in those places where Buddhism (or other institutionalized practices) had gained a certain level of influence, as in Tibet or the Himalayas. The idiom of subjugation or taming remains in my analysis a crucial concept [...]. Still, it is vital to point out that before the local spirits can interact with the institutionalized traditions through relations of contest, conflict, submission or replication, they must first begin their existence as deities, so the way in which the spirits exist has to change. There must be the possibility of knowing them in a way that is different from the flexible experiences and the processes of understanding that are characteristic of shamanic knowledge. Spirits must become objects of authoritative knowledge. [Ibid.: 153). Precisely, the two fixing agents that Halemba identifies as historically having (20) always distorted the spiritual realities of Telengit society basically match the two sources of the distorted view I argued earlier: one is, as we have just seen, the representative of an institutionalized religion, through naming and categorizing, plus the stabilization provided by sacred scriptures and the erection (which has encountered harsh resistance among Altaians) of st?pas and temples; the other is the scholar who imposes his/her construction of an organized religious system where there is instead ambivalence, flexibility, change and mobility, where the spirits, as they are perceived by the people who know (the Telengit spiritual specialists), 'are in constant flow, they change their characteristics, they arrive and disappear, change their voice, appearances, moods and they are not easily predictable. = [...] = [...] all the attempts at creating a coherent "cosmology" out of bits and pieces of information derived from different biler kizhi [the people who know] are bound to fail' (ibid:. 135, 141). Halemba then moves to describe the stories people tell about recent encounters with Buddhist representatives which are live ethnographic testimonials of the clash between these two modes of handling knowledge. The lama, as she names him, typically stands in the middle of a valley and starts explaining the spiritual beings (of a kind called eezi) in the landscape to the people: He points at the mountain and says that there is an eezi there, who is a young man, and that at that sacred spring there the eezi is a young lady. He also reveals to (20) There is also a modern third agent: the intellectual or the political activist interested in fostering the construction of an Altaian national movement. [17] 47</page><page sequence="18">people what he calls the real names of the places, using names, which have never been heard before. [...] I argue that through the practice of naming the spirits and fixing their images, the lamas prepare the way for the subjugation of the land [...] They create the spirits as deities, thereby establishing them as partners for the future dialogue between different religious traditions. On coming to Altai, the Buddhist protagonists are not just entering into dialogue with the pre-existing systems of belief, but they are actively creating such systems in order to be able to interact with them. {Ibid.: 161). According to Halemba's analysis, the Altaian people do recognize and value Buddhist representatives as ones who hold a highly authoritative knowledge. What is more, 'people do not usually say that lamas are wrong or that they make mistakes in identifying the spirits or that they are ignorant about a spirit's character' (ibid.: 162). The reason they have persistently resisted the assault of Buddhism is rather more to do with their concern about the way the subject interacts with the source of spiritual knowledge, which here is in total disaccord with the stability that the institutionalized religion procures: Generally, in their evaluation of spiritual knowledge, the Telengits shift the emphasis from its content (e.g. precise claims about the characteristics of spirits) to the way in which the subject (spiritual specialist) arrives at the claims he or she expresses. Hence, one encounters a great variety of claims that, at the level of content, can be contradictory. Moreover, the contradictory character of the claims can be seen as desirable as it is an indication of the way in which the claim was reached - a specific encounter of a specific individual with specific indices of the occult. In contrast, the knowledge held by practitioners of institutionalized religions is seen as a corpus of things to know. It is imagined as something which has a content, which can be retracted and presented in a systematized form - for example, as a book. This feature of this kind of knowledge is, on one hand, desirable and appreciated as it gives a basis for authority and stability; on the other hand, the very same feature points towards an important paradigmatic shift, which would require a rephrasing of the religious experience based on flexibility and movement. (Ibid.: 164). The situation of Tibetans now or in pre-imperial times does not necessarily fit with the Altaians' situation. But as I have variously tried to highlight, the evidence of historical transformation in concepts is undeniable and calls for careful retracing. In another example, there is ample room to suggest that gestures such as prostration have undergone direct, premeditated, ideological change, superimposed on its quality of expression of the community with the land and its powers. What is more, here I am calling for consideration of whether Bon, from its institutional role in pre-imperial Tibet (whether real or retrospectively imposed), is as responsible for religious transfiguration of the local beliefs as Buddhism, particularly if it arrived from outside. Also, as logical consequence, one must consider whether the romantic view of Bon as the original, indigenous religion of Tibet, is not in need of revision. 48 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Loose Ends By now, my analysis has probably gone too far away into very interesting but also very unexplored and highly speculative areas. Since I don't intend to give answers, but rather to open questions, just let me briefly enumerate a few historical issues that I identify as potentially able to shed additional light in support or otherwise refutation of my hypothesis: A focused reconsideration of the indigenous religion of pre-imperial and/or imperial times that has been evoked by eminent scholars (Tucci, Macdonald, Stein...), the concrete details of which remain evasive and polemic. An examination of the possible clerical, institutional background, in early history, of religious specialists such as lha pa or sngags pa. An in-depth revisiting of the fascinating old story of Gri gum btsan po's duel with Lo ngam rta rdzi, with the paradigmatic cultural change that scholars perceive behind this story and the problem of the first suppression of Bon that this religious tradition asserts which was undertaken by Gri gum. Identifying and defining key methods and literary subterfuges for historical/legendary recreation and fabulation in Bon textual sources. Characterizing and evaluating this literary process surely would clarify a great deal about the real and the imagined early history of Bon (21). [knowledge Secular Clerical heritage] Suffused, undifferentiated, non-anthropomorphic (in various degrees) Concrete, differentiated, zoomorphic or anthropomorphic [organization] Loosely institutionalized Social forces, more or less intangible self-organization (in various degrees) Tightly institutionalized Politics-clergy alliance The king, the priest and the doctrine' Means for organizing: a) ritual; b) political (21) John R. McRae gives us a very lucid, inspiring precedent for this kind of inquiry in Seeing through Zen. His subject is early to Song Dynasty Chan in China, and he includes a penetrating synthesis on the literary transformative aspects. Idiosyncratic Chan sounds somehow very much Bonpo (McRae 2003: 14-15): 'Time and again we find we are dealing, not with what happened at any given point, but with what people thought happened previously. We deal not so much in facts and events as in legends and reconstructions, not so much with accomplishments and contributions as with attributions and legacies. The legends and reconstructions, not the supposedly "actual" events, determined latter religious and social praxis. This observation may have a broad application beyond Chinese Chan, in describing what it is that makes traditions traditions. 15 But it is certainly applicable to Chan: not true, and therefore more important'. [19] 49</page><page sequence="20">Conclusion: Redefining lha As said before, the term lha expressed that which was in a high position, particularly the monarchs. In its adjectival function it may be more appropriate to render it as superior, exalted or sublime, than divine. Moreover, thinking of its use as a vocative for sovereigns, it seems in part more akin to the His/Her Majesty that Europeans applied to their kings and queens. In lha ri we may not at all be dealing with a mountain god or a mountain that is a god (an interpretation that can certainly be evoked), but rather with an exalted/excellent/sublime/majestic mountain. And I suggested that the last one (majestic), although not as close to the above concept as the other ones, may be a more practical option. To follow this line would lead us to redefine this and other related terms that are always called gods, deities or spirits. Rather than as entities that are perceived as individual, separate and with human attributes, it is proposed that they may have originally been seen and defined in a more vaguely symbolical, ritualistic and metaphoric form. Although expressed in a context different from the present discussion, namely how the birth-gods fit or do not fit into the Buddhist notions about emptiness and self, the following words from Martin A. Mills indirectly shed light on the case that concerns us here: Rather than suggesting any fundamental essence or identity, terms such as dagpo and la, and the deities of the body, implied something closer to powers or jurisdictions, whose translations into Christological ideas such as soul overly reifies what are more accurately perceived as processes of agency. [...] By extension, sadag and zhidag become the formally defined 'agency' of certain territorial domains (rather than simply their owners), producing wealth and fertility within them, and representing the matrix of ritual influence that correlates with certain corporate human groups, such as households and household estates that share the same p'alha or yullha. (Mills 2003: 256-57). Mills explains that while bdag po is a transformation of bdag, a term cognate with I or self, it does not exactly carry the same idea, and it is used by the speaker to refer to himself when narrating a story (22). I would add that it is like a conventional I, or even like a fictional one, one with a ceremonial, ritualized or honorific connotation (from which it derives its application for denoting meanings as master or owner). This idea has a fascinating parallel: the Tibetan bdag po, as mentioned before, seems to correspond with a concept of masterhood that the Altaian Telengits name ee and share with other Turkish and Mongol-speaking peoples of Inner Asia: (22) Mills 2003: 256. The term bdag has usually been employed to translate the Sanskrit ?tman. Also, interestingly enough, it is attested that the usual meaning of bdag po as master or owner was given in early historical times (at least as far as early 9th century) to bla (Karmay [1987] 1998: 311), along with others such as king or lord. 50 [20]</page><page sequence="21">In the literature ee is most often explained as a 'master' or a 'host' of a particular place. [...] It can relate to spiritual entities like the masters of mountains, lakes or rivers. The term is also used to describe people: for example the host of the house and the Emperor. Generally, the idea of ee allows people to talk about the inner or concealed power of entities and to create relationships with them. (Halemba 2006: 64). One cannot but find affinity with the figurative or honorific quality of bdag po. Halemba gives a long, very illustrative explanation of all the uses and qualities of the term ee, which seems to encompass a very wide range of situations: it forms the term Jerdhj eezi, which seems very close to sa bdag (Jer 'means the earth, a country or a place') and 'may be seen as the master of a particular place or of all the motherland (Altai)'; it is also present inside people ('However, this ee is not a separate entity or a further aspect of a person [...]'); but the interesting part is that, even if (perhaps as a consequence of that ubiquity and wide range of applications) sometimes Jerditj eezi can manifest itself with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic aspects, and there are stories about its characteristics, 'people seem to understand and perceive it rather as a kind of spiritual energy, which is important for its very essence regardless of the form it takes' (ibid.: 65). So, the different lha may be seen as people's suffusion with their natural surrounding - an agency that they share with it - which pervades both, is embodied in the person and defines the functional role of the social groups. Martin A. Mills sees the whole thing in terms of reification, where the primary factor is the social interaction and self-identity within the landscape, from which the ideas of spiritual entities take symbolic shape through ritualization: I argue [...] that [...] local deity worship in Tibetan and Himalayan regions is part of a powerful (but largely implicit, or at least not textually formulated) cultural construction of the social and ritual capacities of humans, one which conceives of embodied person-hood as the nexus of productive and reproductive relationships with local chthonic sources, embedded within the wider landscape in which a person is born. These relationships are reified through models of the body as an internal 'map' of local chthonic influences. (Mills 2003: XVII-XVIII). In the example of the king, his attributes and his ritual function emanate very naturally through a scheme of his belonging to a network of ritual and social meanings, all of them embedded in the landscape. That is why the king was lha. He was literally an embodied emanation of a great mountain (the physical mountain: not necessarily at all, I argue, a god within, or a god that is the mountain) with the social and ritual function that this involved. This intermingling between the human sphere and the landscape, as we saw before, defines identity and belonging through its genealogical nature. It is no wonder that, in terms of behavior, it manifests itself in very physical forms of expression. One of the most notorious is the act of prostration, which implies a total contact of the body with the land - a kind of impregnation, in contrast with the [21] 51</page><page sequence="22">usual discourse of the Tibetan religious representatives. Charles Allen gives us a vivid description in a passage about the Tibetan traditional secular pilgrimage to places of power: It is a direct sensory relationship between a person and a place in which physical contact through every one of the senses is all-important. The pilgrim sees, using both eyes and mind; vocalizes through players; listens, for messages external and internal; centres the body, aligning it so as to be at one with the bla; touches with hands, forehead or body; tastes by accepting blessed food and water or by eating some part of the ground; collects, by taking some small part of the place; and exchanges, leaving some article of clothing or bodily part behind. [...] Direct physical contact with the bla-gnas leads to spiritual empowerment. Unlike the acts of self-mortification found among penitenti in Catholicism and some sects of Islam, it is all about empowerment. (Allen 1999: 92). To conclude, I find Martin's analysis full of lucidity throughout his book. As a final note let me quote his words that express some of his most interesting ideas about the interpenetration of natural, social, ideological and spiritual elements in the rural Ladakhi community of his study: [... ] cosmologies as the three-layer system do not constitute beliefs about the world as an objective phenomenon, but maps for orientating oneself within any particular 'frame' of ritual, social and economic action. Such 'orientations' are profoundly embodied ones - acting through the body as a complex social signifier. [...] Thus the operational reality of cosmological maps lies in the bodily actions, disciplines and dispositions they invoke within particular social frames, activities which in turn strengthen and lend 'reality' to the more abstract dimensions of those maps. [...] the environment in which people move becomes invested with the significances of their social actions, projecting concepts of purity, superiority, and divinity onto certain spaces and orientations that are routinely treated in particular ways. (Mills 2003: 162). Here I face a direct counter-proof of my hypothesis that institutionalized religions (including Bon, perhaps earlier than Buddhism) altered previous local, secular arrangements. Martin is talking about a process in the opposite direction: internal reification and deification on its own within the secular sphere itself and later absorption of those elements into the institutionalized religious system. But Halemba in Altai is a witness of things going the other way round. We need to remember that the secular-clerical axis in my model is a gradient in which we should expect continuous variation as well as sudden radical breaks, where there are most likely intermediate situations responding to factors as diverse as historical influences, ecological environment, clan constitution or even people who know's individual propensities. Both immanence and transcendence; both continuity and discontinuity in paradigms of the sacred; both internal developments within the local community, departing in various degrees from the understanding of lha in purely suffused, 52 [22]</page><page sequence="23">immanent terms, and external breaking input from institutionalized religious actors; and the latter, at times free and at times strongly conditioned by political agendas. What is needed is to clarify this complex matrix, and not to impose artificial uniformity or disregard any line of enquiry. We may, for example, see certain factors from a different angle: inquiries of how likely it was for the inhabitants of the Tibetan plateau in pre-imperial times to hold theistic beliefs; whether Bon beliefs and rituals draw from those of the laity or rather imply an input completely new and/or strange; whether change and innovation played a role of paradigmatic significance in those times prior to the advent of Buddhism. Some possible answers for these have been suggested here as real possibilities but are still awaiting rigorous assessment.
