<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INTEGRITY CF CHRISTIAN ETHICS (Presidential Address) J. Philip Vfogaman The best thing about this otherwise intimidating assignment is the opportunity it gives to express personal gratitude for the stimulation, insight, and cxitician which msnbership in this company of scholars has afforded through the years. The great diversity of approaches to Chris tian ethics, both theoretical and practical, represented here is a major source of strength for all of us. At best, we are a civilized body— which means, to borrow a phrase frcm the late John Courtney Murray, we are men and women locked together in argument. At least, we are spared premature consensus on matters of importance. The presidential address is, I take it, an invitation to some poor soul to contribute to argument by exploring a problem of general interest to members of the society, in the confident expectation that the last word on the subject will be spoken by others. There could be no more important intellectual problem for this society than the question whether Christian ethics, in the final analy sis, contributes anything at all. Can Christian ethics be pursued with intellectual integrity? Can we seek to apply Christian faith to the moral dilenmas confronting individuals and society today in the expecta tion that good can be served and humanity not be misled by our efforts? If so, what is the basic nature of our contribution? There are identity problems in all areas of theology today, not excepting Christian ethics. For Christian ethics the problem is partly the tension that ccmes frcm being at the intersection of normative disci plines and the sources of anpirical knowledge. I know no way to avoid the tensions implicit in the vocation of interdisciplinary thinking, either now or in the future. But the identity problem runs deeper in our time because the ultimate status of Christian truth claims is under serious question. So far as Christian ethics is concerned, that problem is often posed for us by the claims and criticisms of the different kinds of philo sophical ethics. There are, indeed, frequent misunderstandings between moral philosophers and Christian ethicists. There is a tendency among</page><page sequence="2">sate philosophers to treat Christian thought as a "soft," insufficiently rigorous enterprise which may, at best, add to the emotional tone of things. It is as though too many philosophers had overheard the wards of the social gospel figure George D. Herrón: "Great spiritual facts and principles are not apprehended but distorted by the intellect. Not the clear in head, but the pure in heart shall see God."1 Qi the other hand, there is sorretimes a tendency among Christian ethicists, even when they would not agree with Herrón, to think of moral philosophy as superbly competent analysis of all the trees in the woods which regret tably neglects the forest itself. Sometimes Christian ethicists react defensively to the seemingly more rigorous ethics of the philosophers; sometimes we make uncritical use of their work. It is an open question whether Christian ethicists and moral philosophers try very hard to learn from each others' work. From our side, this is a pity because hard philosophical analysis may be what is needed most now to help es tablish whether Christian ethics can, in fact, be pursued in good faith. In this paper, I wash to suggest several points where philosophi cal analysis and criticism can help to clarify the contribution of Christian ethics and to propose that philosophical ethics has need for that contribution if it is not itself to be a "soft", insufficiently rigorous discipline. A good starting point is R. M. Hare's declaration that "the tran scendent God is bound always to be an idle element in our religious life. His existence or non-existence cannot possibly make any difference, either to what w*e ought to do, or to what is going to be the case."2 While Hare's logical point rests partly upon his failure to relate tran scendence to inmanence in the orthodox conception of God, it is clear that his overall analysis of ethics treats theology as fundamentally irrelevant apart frcm its addition of a certain tone to humanistic ethics and, perhaps, a certain imprecise support for belief in a moral order. Most other moral philosophers manage to deal with ethical questions with out invoking Christian or other religious ethics at all. At best, Christian ethics would seem to be harmless baggage. Che recalls Voltaire's remark that it is possible to kill a flock of sheep by means of witchcraft if one feeds the sheep enough arsenic at the same tine. Joan Robinson cited this remark to indicate the non-inportance of the labor theory of value in the basic economic analysis of Karl Marx: "fferx's penetrating insight and bitter hatred of oppression supply the arsenic, while the labour theory of value provides the incantations."2 Is it the situation that whenever Christian ethics contributes moral truth it is really hard philosophical analysis that provides the "arsenic" while the theological component is only incantation? If I understand the objection truly, it may be stated in this way: Since morality pertains to our concrete actions and attitudes (always within the sphere of human culture and society), our operative reasons for doing something wri.ll also arise within that sphere and wri.ll have to do, in seme way, with well-being within that sphere. Any reasons other than these operative reasons are not real reasons. They are only harmless</page><page sequence="3">baggage or, as same philosophers may say a bit patronizingly, they con tribute to the motivation we have for doing the things we know, on other grounds, we ought to do. Thus, good Christians oppose war because it kills people and causes suffering and destroys property. These are good reasons for opposing war—Christian or not. Similarly, good Christians are opposed to racial discrimination because it undermines the unity of the human ccmnunity and has harmful psychological results, both among the victims and the perpetrators of discrimination. These are good reasons far opposing racial discrimination—Christian or not. Likewise, Christians consider it to be a moral obligation to feed the hungry because if the hungry are not fed they starve to death or suffer the de humanizing effects of malnutrition while also complicating the historical destinies of their better fed brothers and sisters. These are good reasons for feeding the hungry—Christian or not. And so on. What has the Christian ccmpcnent added to the substantive ethical reasoning? To say that God wills it does not seem to add anything because, as Kai Nielsen and others suggest, it is possible to describe the reasons why "God wills it" without changing in the slightest the reasons why any non believer also might will it. Could we not go further and say that the divine ccmmand is only useful in supplying motivation for those who care little about their moral duties unless convinced that a superhuman power requires them to attend to than, which would be faint praise for Chris tians indeed. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to review the status of those "real reasons" a bit more closely. Why ought I act so as to oppose racial discrimination, war, hunger, etc.? The reasons given above are objective conditions resulting frcm these important problems. But what is wrong or bad about such conditions? Indeed, why should these even be described as problems? In what way do such objective conditions validate an ought statement about than? Oie wiay or another, every "hard" philo sophical analysis has to confront that question. The utilitarians sought to do so by locating the ought in the psychological claim that pleasure seems to have upon us, building on that foundation a broader conception of social good. Even in its more sophisticated forms, that doctrine proved vulnerable to the argument that it had caimitted the naturalistic fallacy of identifying a factual state with moral good. G. E. Moore, who pressed this pxoint, thought to avoid the naturalistic fallacy by treating "good" as an irreducible quality and by relying extensively upon intuition in locating the good in concrete circumstances. Thus, while good is a primary, universal quality, the forms of its actual embodiment and of its normative claims upon us are clarified through experience and reflection. We ought, morally speaking, to act so as to further the good (as encountered and understood) through our actions and choices. The claim of good supplies the non-naturalistic basis of the ought. To vjhich the reply of A. J. Ayer is that no good or ought is, as such, verifiable; such claims therefore have no logical status except as subjective, active expressions.6 since Ayer is not one of the patron saints of Christian ethics, we may need to attend to his view® with great er care lest sane nugget of truth slip past us unawares. In this case,</page><page sequence="4">the nugget may also have slipped past many other moral philosophers as well. As I read Ayer, his implication is that Moore has not escaped the naturalistic fallacy after all. The following passage supplies the background: The criterion which we use to test the genuineness of apparent statements of fact is the criterion of verifiability. We say that a sentence is factually significant to any given person, if, and only if, he kncws hew to verify the proposition which it purports to express—that is, if he knows what observations would lead him, under certain conditions, to accept the propo sition as being true, or reject it as being false. If, on the other hand, the putative proposition is of such a character that the assumption of its truth, or falsehood, is consistent with any assumption whatsoever concerning the nature of his experience, then, as far as he is concerned, it is, if not a tautology, a mere pseudo-proposition. The sentence expressing it may be emotionally significant to him; but it is not liter ally significant. 7 Ayer's distinctions between practical verifiability and verifiability in principle and between the strong and weak senses of verifiability relieve his argument of the necessity to show that factual statements which are technically difficult or even practically impossible to verify are necessarily nonsense. But he does insist that any characterization of "good" or "ought" which treats these as primary qualities, in the manner of G. E. Moore, constitutes meaningless appendage to intellectual dis sentiments", and for such "moral sentiments" to be shared broadly within a given culture. But the existence of such sentiments cannot validate a value claim without reliance upon the naturalistic fallacy. It is thus possible to say that certain experiences tend to yield pleasure, that people find what they or others consider to be fulfillment by observing certain principles of behavior, that certain social practices or patterns are functional with respect to objectives proposed by seme people that certain political, economic, or social interests are served well or badly by certain typical policies. Such statements are all susceptible of verification. But such verification is all at the natural or factual level. The question pressed by Ayer, not simply upon Christian ethics but upon moral philosophy in general, is how we are to leap out of that descriptive level into any "ought" statements at all. Thus he seeks to justify his famous conclusion that "in every case in which one would ccmmonly be said to be making an ethical judgement, the function of the relevant ethical word is purely 'amotive. ' It is used to express feeling about certain objects, but not to make any assertion about them,"8 I have not gone into this in order to disagree with Moore nor to agree with Ayer, but only to suggest how difficult it is to avoid the naturalistic fallacy. Correspondingly, it is very difficult to establish clearly and firmly the basis of any statement about what is "good" or</page><page sequence="5">about what people "ought" to do. In other words, the "hard" side of ethical reasoning—the arsenic, so to speak—can be surprisingly soft until it caires up with an acceptable ultimate rationale for its con ception of the good. Even Kantian or existentialist approaches to ethics may present us with much the same problem when efforts are made to state such positions without reference to religious presuppositions. The Kantian position, with refinements and expansions subsequent to Inmanuel Kant himself, seaningly rests upon an absolute normative foundation which can be established through reasoned analysis of the moral will. Its ultimate norms, (the good will and universal moral law which can alone obligate the moral will,) apparently are not dependent upon cultural variations or religious particularities. The good will is the only thing of which it can be said without qualification that it is good in and of itself, and the good will can apparently be analyzed in universal but non-reli gious terms. The position has been refined with particular clarity in. the personalistic formulations of E. S. Brightman, Walter G. Muelder, and L. Harold DeWblfH—with emphasis upon the consistent (non-self contradictory) will, the priority of ideal values, respect for persons as ends in thanselves, and coimitment to persons-in-ccmnunity. Kantians and personalists are together in considering the principal result of inmoral acts and attitudes to be the disintegration of the moral will itself, although immorality is also likely to be destructive of the good in and for others as well. The question is, of course, in what sense this matters ultimately—either to oneself or to others, Muelder and DeWblf have attempted to ground their approach to moral law metaphysically and theologically, and a number of passages in Kant himself likewise suggest that metaphysical assumptions about the character of reality it self are needed to back up the significance of the moral will. The metaphysical basis of the free moral will in Kantian and personalistic ethics may in fact mean that such ethics are religious ethics when presented rigorously. In any event, without an ultimate frame of refer ence beyond the formally good will, ethics remains as it were suspended in a vacuum. Existentialism presents scute of the same difficulties and openings. There is also a certain quality of absoluteness implicit in the existentialist "courage to be." Yet, despite the efforts of seme existentialist thinkers to derive the moral absolute from that personal decision alone, such a decision may presuppose a good deal about reality as a whole. What is the question that the self asks of itself when it confronts the choice of being vs. ncn-being? Perched atop seme ledge, so to speak, what does one ask oneself in those last moments of decision unless it pertains to the ultimate worthfulness of the venture of life? Does not the yes or no hinge upon an implicitly ultimate assessment of reality? Tillich's account of the presuppositions of absolute faith suggests perceptively that such faith, even when apparently devoid of specific content, includes "the experience of the power of being" and "the acceptance of being accepted.it is possible to conceive of an existentialist faith caimitment or decision based upon utter individu alism, possibly of a Nietzschean sort, but few moral philosophers would be interested in the ethical corollaries.</page><page sequence="6">I suspect we could pursue this kind of analysis at much greater length than this occasion permits without finding a dependable basis for ethical judgments until we are able to ground our conception of the good, and the sense of moral obligation that flows frcm it, in an ulti mate framework of valuation. It is the judgment that the framework of valuation is ultimate that makes it possible to break out of the naturalistic fallacy. For example, if I am a thoroughgoing nationalist, I can assert that everything that helps to preserve the continued identity, pcwer, and prosperity of my country is good. It may be possi ble, within limits, to verify what does and what does not contribute to such ends. If I argue simply that such things are good because they manifestly maintain and enhance the nation, I can well be accused of involvement in the naturalistic fallacy. But if I go further and say that the nation is morally ultimate, not because it has existence and I like it, but because I really do believe it to be the ultimate embodiment of value, then I have perhaps escaped the naturalistic fallacy. Such a center of value, to use H. R. Niebuhr's term, fairly bristles with problems. But so long as we have not argued that the nation is the ultimate source of good just because it exists or just because other people say it is, then we may have avoided the naturalistic fallacy. We have, in Max Stackhouse's inimitable phrase, marked the nation off as what is "really real"-1-^ (if by that term Stackhouse has sought to disting uish betwaen an ultimate framework of valuation and other realities which may be, in tension with it). Will we have avoided Mr. Ayer's charge that ethical statements are meaningless because they are unverifiable? I take it that any statement is meaningful in his terms, whether or not true, if it asserts the exist ence of a factual reality. Our problem, when seeking to establish an ultimate frame of reference for valuation, is that we are forced to make judgments concerning the whole of reality. That the whole of reality exists factually is indubitable. But in caning to terms with the whole of reality is logically verifiable—or verifiable in principle, as Ayer would say—but it cannot be verified practically speaking. Ayer himself indicated that whether or not there are mountains on the hidden side of the moon is verifiable in principle, although practically it is beyond our means of information gathering. We have gone on bo deal with the moon, of course, but it is safe to say that the ultimate character of the whole of reality is permanently beyond actual knowledge. But that makes it no less real and no less important for the ethical enterprise for us to cane to terms with it. A statement concerning the good can, indeed, be based upon an "is"—and I think it finally must be. But that "is" is the nature of reality as a whole. Even the more limited center of value inplied by nationalisa inplicitly represents a judgment about reality as a whole: namely, that everything other than the nation-state is void of significance except insofar as it contributes or detracts frcm the nation-state. A better illustration might be ethical humanism, which regards the human as the apex of existence and considers all other aspects of being as possessing a lover order of reality. A Bertrand Russell or Albert Camus can even view the universe as a profoundly hostile or absurd</page><page sequence="7">or meaningless environnent but at the sane time consider the reality of humanity as an important enough reality to warrant serving as center of value. My point is that such conceptions in principle involve mare than the country or humanity, they also involve the rest of reality. Which means that such conceptions always extend far beyond actual knowl edge. If what we have been saying is true, it is true for everybody. No ras with the body kncws all of reality. Yet, if we are to ccme to terms with the good in any ultimately normative sense, we must in some sense ground our being and thinking and doing upon conjecture. In this sense, at least, a "hard" ethics does not exist—if by that we mean a foundation for our understand ing of the good that expresses absolute, undeniable truth. We could spare ourselves a good deal of intellectual arrogance if we could bring ourselves to acknowledge that rather obvious fact about the human predicament. But if we also take both truth and goodness seriously, we will seek to relate to ultimate reality on the basis of what we can knew. Thus, what we believe about reality as a whole is an expression of seme aspects of reality which we have experienced and which ws consider to be decisive indications (or revelations) of what lies beyond inroediate experience. In that sense we must relate to the whole of reality through metaphor, 'This does not mean that such knowledge is purely subjective, since metaphors vary in their capacity to encanpass objective realities that are experi enced. But ultimate reality is still mare than any experience or any metaphors. Our choice of metaphors is obviously very important. It is decisive in determining the character of our view of reality and, deriva tively, of our ethics. I use the word metaphor here to refer to any aspects of experience that have ever functioned or will ever function as the basis for interpreting the whole of reality. Por example, we may take the causal relationships among natural pro cesses, as disclosed by the methods of science, to be the decisive clue as to the nature of all reality. If we do so, our tendency will be to reduce all other aspects of experience, including human consciousness, to purely objective factors. When behaviorism extends beyond the disciplinary limits of a branch of psychology to become an all-inclusive philosophy, that is what has happened. Unless I am mistaken, that is exactly what is going on in much of the work of B. F. Skinner, The ethical conse quence can be a reduction of ethics to a manipulative structuring of human existence into patterns which reflect sane conception of goodness thought to be natural and reasonable by the manipulator. Or, with reality reduced to natural process, soie may take a purely hedonistic ethic to be the logical consequence. The scientific metaphor has had great power in western culture for half a millennium. (It is interesting to trace the successive birth of the major branches of science, noting hew each in turn has been seized upon by devoted followers, not simply as a productive new avenue for important knowledge, but as the one decisive metaphor on the basis of vdiich all reality can best be interpreted. Newtonian physics had in this way great influence upon the development of deism. Darwinian biology gave rise to "social Darwinian". And so on.)</page><page sequence="8">Other metaphors have had great influence historically. The Nie tzschean superman had immense influence in the ethics and politics of certain cultures during the first half of this century, combined to a considerable extent with scientific metaphors. Dialectical materialsm combined, perhaps illogically, with humanism to produce the Marxist view of reality and a consequent ethic. The exploration of the various metaphors by which humankind has interpreted ultimate reality and its own responsibilities is obviously an endlessly complex undertaking. By my main point is that we should be skeptical of any effort to ground a conception of an "ought" or a "good" that presumes to avoid reliance upon such metaphors. Christian ethics must thus be particularly interested in the meta phorical representations of Christian faith, their adequacy as organizing conceptions of reality as a whole, and their consequences in the attitudes and behavior of individuals and catmunities that take them seriously. In one way or another, the historical figure of Jesus Christ is bound to be central. To state it minimally, Christian ethics depends for its founda tion upon the notion that when Jesus Christ is correctly understood he is himself a decisive clue as to the nature of reality. The Letter to the Colossians puts the claim powerfully: "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation: for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together, . . For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross." (1:15-17, 19-20). Exactly how reality is revealed in Jesus Christ is, of course, subject to endless elaboration and to no little controversy among contending schools of theology. Proba bly most of the interpretations express same particle of the truth. Taken as a whole, the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus, the quality of his life, the depth of his love revealed in the acceptance of the cross, have been regarded by Christians as the decisive revelation of what goodness means ultimately. The resurrection faith adds the belief that that good ness is characteristic of the source of all being and thereby the notion that to lj&gt;g good is ultimately to be real and to be real is ultimately to be good. As a whole, this provides metaphorical basis for Frederick Carney's interpretation of religious ethics as a response to "gracious reality. "" Jesus Christ, as the central Christian metaphor, stands in a specific historical-cultural context—including the rich and important covenantal traditions of more than a thousand prior years of Hebrew experience. And the past two millennia of intellectual interpretation of Christ also affect presentday Christian perceptions. All specific value claims, human actions, institutions, patterns of culture and behavior wall be judged by Christians by the degree to which they cohere wdth that central revelation of goodness, Jesus Christ is not the only metaphor for Christians, but it establishes in sane wey the decisive clue or revelation of the character</page><page sequence="9">of reality. For reasonable Christians, this decisive revelation oo-exists with a vast ocmplex of other sources of knowledge, including those disci plines we call by the name of science. Moreover, in Christian trinitarian formulations it co-exists with other elements substnied under conceptions of the Fatherhood of God and the Holy Spirit. A fuller discussion of the complex interrelationships of Christian metaphors with other non-theological metaphors is, of course, beyond the scope of this paper. But our central question remains: can Christians rely upon their metaphors of reality with intellectual integrity? In part, for a reasonable person, are the Christian metaphors capable of. bearing the full weight of the ultimate meaning of actual experience? That, incidentally, is the proper question to raise frcm Ayer's point of view although he would not like the application.) For this is how claimed truths about the viole of reality are verified: i.e., by their adequacy in bringing the whole of life experience into coherent focus. In our time there are certainly many reasonable people vio do not think that the Christian metaphors can bear this weight, partly on grounds of the alleged incompatibility of Christian views and scientific views of reality and partly on the supposition that the inmensity of suffering and evil on earth is too great to permit continued belief in the ultimate reality of goodness as constitutive of the source of all being. Ms may sympathize with such doubts and frcm time to time entertain them ourselves. Nevertheless, I do not consider it to be unreasonable to believe that the source of reality itself is not less benevolent and purposive than the hurtan level of reality with which we are all familiar. Of course this is all rather anthropomorphic. An anthropomorphic view of being is burdened with problems if it is asserted that reality is nothing greater than the human (with God, perhaps, pictured as the man upstairsK But it may be quite another matter if we hold that the source of reality is no less than the human. For the human, in any account, has always been potential in the most basic foundation stones of the universe, whatever they may have been. I do not offer any of this as "proof of the existence of God," but only to say that those who draw their metaphors from the experiencing of the human are not merely voicing superstition. And in light of the existing traditions concerning Jesus Christ, it is not irrational to regard him as the profoundest revelation, in the human sphere, of the ultimate nature of reality itself. Christians can work out of the meaning of this and its ethical ramifications in good faith. I realize that I may have overshot seme objections that those who do philosophical ethics might want to enter. Have I, for instance, been arguing that all ethics is religious ethics? If so, have I taken up the position that William Frankena has carefully dissected in his paper "Is Morality logically Dependent on Religion?" In a sense, I have. And in defense of ny position, it seems to me -that his views are unacceptably tied to a theistic definition of religion. Thinking of religion more in terms of a Tillichian definition (religion as ultimate concern) or in</page><page sequence="10">10 terms of H. R. Niebuhr's conception of a center of value, it should be apparent that an ethical View which is not in sane sense religious does not have ultimately normative farce. Even James Gustafson's careful analysis of the contribution of Christian ethics to the enterprise of ethics in general probably gives too much away in acceptance of an autonomous ethics that is uncommitted religiously.2® Even on a quite conventional level of discourse, we can all think of religions that are not essentially theist—such as Taoism, most Hinduism, much Buddhism —even before taking up secular creeds such as fterxism or fascism that are often spoken of as religious phenomena. In arguing this point I do not seek to open matters up for an inside track for religious mysticism or for particular revelation claims, but rather to note that Christian ethics is not sate wholly different enterprise built upon sentimentality. Not the least among the contributions of this perspective is the fact that it farces all Büpfcoaedly secular or autonomous forms of ethics to cate clean about their own fundamental reference points. In other words, returning again to Voltaire, the real arsenic may in fact turn out to be the religious component—not the rest. Which raises another interesting objection that theological ethics occasionally must answer. That is the argument that regardless of the truth or error of par ticular religious interpretations, this is a pluralistic world. It may be best to base ethics, not en seme particularistic religious claims but rather upon values and principles that all reasonable persons might accept. Frankena, again, puts the viewpoint well: ...one is impelled to wonder. . . if there is anything to be gained by insisting that all ethical principles are or must be logically grounded on religious beliefs. For to insist on this is to introduce into the foundations of any morality whatsoever all of the difficulties involved in the adjudi cation of religious controversies, and to do so is hardly to encourage hope that mankind can reach, by peaceful or rational means, sate desirable kind of agreement an moral and political principles. It also encourages ethical and political skepticism in those who do not or cannot accept the required religious beliefs, that is why it strikes me as important to reject the view that all morality is logically dependent on religion and to leave open the possibility that at least seme important ethical judgments can be justified independently of religion and theology—a possibility which, fortunately, many theologians already accept.21 John Rawls' theory of justice obviously seeks to function on this plane, as does Daniel Callahan's work on population ethics, to mention just two contemporary philosophical ethicists of wide influence. In disputing the point, I do not wish to be misunderstood. Certain ly Christian ethicists must not talk only to themselves, and as thsy make their contributions to the wider dialogue on ethical matters they must</page><page sequence="11">11 surely not imply that the practical points they make could logically be made only on Christian foundations, for that is rarely so, Christians can agree with almost everybody that murder is wrong, that generosity is ennobling, that it is good to provide the ocnmunity with a good sanitation system, that habitual lying is destructive of trust, and so on. There are intuitive insights into the good which are shared by persons representing all kinds of traditions which are sustained by culture at irrmediate, non-religious levels. Vfe ought to be able to ccmnunicate on a caimon-sense level with persons who share similar specific values. But when the "why" questions are pressed in upon us, ought we not always to be able to relate our values and judgments clearly to our center of value? Thus being prepared to account for the hope that is in us? I wonder, too, whether Frankena's views—and others like his—may not be too much captive to secular assumptions which continue to have great power in our culture but which are no less particularistic in their cwn way than Christian ethics. It is a question of hew we should go about discussions of ethics in the marketplace of ideas: should it be an the basis of a search far the least-camion-dencminators afforded by secular life or should it be on the basis of each person or group sharing its cwn deepest insights on the matters at hand. The fact that the farmer often seams mare productive than the latter may say more about the per sistent superficiality, even triviality of this culture than it does about what is inevitably the best strategy for coping with ethical dis course in a pluralistic setting. For my part, when taking up a serious moral problem with a Moslem or Hindu or Marxist, I would rather get it straight frcm the heart of that person's center of value than I would frcm the surface of sane least-ccmmon-dencminator. I think that is what real moral communication finally means: a sharing among persons concern ing their deepest values insofar as they are engaged in a matter of cannon interest or concern. But I am also concerned about what may be slipped through unannounced by least-aormcMi-denaninatar ethics. Far example, many of us have been helped greatly by Bawls' theory of justice. Yet it is of more than passing interest that the "original position" is defined there in terms of hew each person might best protect his/her cwn interests when nobody's current status and vested interests can be known. Principles of justice "are the principles that free and rational persons concerned to further their cwn interests would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the fundamental terms of their association,"22 Bawls thinks this will lead to a conception of fairness and equality which will, in a just situation, be the reigning presumption guiding policy. I agree with most of the end result. But the foundational assumption concedes a degree of individualism and self-centeredness which Bawls himself is anxious later in his analysis to avoid. The problem may be similar to that of the idealistic politician who wonders whether he should appeal to the conscience or the pocketbook of his constituency. It is a genuine</page><page sequence="12">12 dilemma. But if it always resolved on the pocketbook side, the politician may find himself helping to confirm attitudes that will in the long run undermine everything he stands for. Surely the ethicist is under an even heavier constraint to avoid conceding anything at all formally to values Which he/she does not accept. It should also be said that the arrival of consensus in ethical discourse concerning the desirability of values such as freedom, justice, ccumunity, and the like may avoid confrontation with real differences and prevent arriving at deeper levels of consensus through a proving of what these terms mean in their ultimate contexts of valuation and in their contextual applicability. Thus, when we are asked to do our ethical thinking on the plane of what all reasonable persons might accept, we may find ourselves begging too many questions. The problen is that the word "reasonable" is not value-free. We shall always have to define people out of the conversation by the values we exclude as being "unreasonable." For reasonable surely means more than the judgment that certain persons possess the faculty or reasoning. Everybody has that, more or less. Nor is it a judgment of intelligence quotient, for sane intelligent people impress us as being unreasonable, and there is also such a thing as being "dumb but not stupid" —i.e., not unreasonable. Nor is it a matter of our exercising our capacity to reason—for everybody does that too. It is rather in the shared canmitments, values, and assumptions which are taken to be charac teristic or reasonable people. A certain circularity appears when we take "reasonable" to mean those who are most susceptible to the arguments we find persuasive ourselves. Such a definition of reasonable would have been perfectly acceptable to Tbrquemada in his conversations with Spanish heretics or to Calvin in his dialogues with the condemned Servetus. Presumably, on the other hand, a reasonable person is one who will acknowl edge logical flaws in his argument when they are pointed out to him. But even here, more is likely to depend upon the basic presuppositions than upon the logic vfith which we expound them. Of course it is also possible that those wishing to base ethics upon a foundation acceptable to all reasonable persons have in mind their own ultimate metaphors concerning reality—metaphors derived frcm Socratic, Platonic, Stoic, Kantian, or like rational traditions. If so, that point should not be concealed be hind the notion that ethics is in principle altogether independent of metaphysics, ontology, or religion. I shall not pursue this point further, but a final question cannot be avoided as we seek to tie all this together. Where, exactly, do those metaphorical representations of ultimate goodness and reality ccme frcm if we think we are basing our judgments about the world of experience upon a realm of being that is above or beyond that world? At tie bottom line, so to speak, do the philosophers turn out to be right after all? Are not our conceptions of goodness or Tightness gained by intuitions or reflections wzithin, not above, the world of concrete experience? There is no other world for us to do our thinking and intuiting in, no other source for our moral knowledge. And that world is not the "whole of reality" or "ultimate reality" or any such pretentious notion.</page><page sequence="13">13 But that may not yet be the last vrord. It seons to me that the response that a religious ethics, including Christian ethics, must make is this: when a specific concrete value claim is made (or when a quality of life is judged to be "good"), there is a sense in which a declaration of ultimate significance has been made if it is taken to be binding in any final terms, G. E. Moore was probably right (if I under stand him correctly) in saying that we confront and identify goodness intuitively. We know ourselves to be valuing creatures. The contrasting claims of good and evil, right and wrong, better and worse are among the primary experiences of human consciousness. But to experience something as "good" is not to experience an abstraction: rather it is to experience a true or false claim concerning reality. That is why it is both possi ble and necessary to speak of ultimate reality in metaphorical terms drawn from historical, communal, and personal experience. That is also why there is an ultimate circularity at the base of ethical reasoning which cannot, in this creaturely existence, be avoided. We encounter what we take to be good, we attribute it to the whole of reality; thence it measures and in turn is tested by other moral claims and realities as experienced. Christian ethics reflects upon the historical experience of a community of faith that has encountered goodness in the person of Jesus Christ, attributed it to God, and thereby acknowledged its claim upon the fashioning of its owrn existence and that of the whole family. I believe that Christian ethics can undertake that task, and all of its subsequent ramifications, with integrity.</page><page sequence="14">14 NOTES 1. Oaoted in Paul H.
