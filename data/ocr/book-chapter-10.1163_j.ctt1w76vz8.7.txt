<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Ohaptn IV  The Founding Mythe of Y6i-nan Ritual  1. Editor's introduction  Verschueren's accounts of Yéi-nan myth and ritual abound with  references to his dispute with Wirz and Nevermann about the pres- en ce of totemism among the Yéi, and about their identification  of the yeva1e with ancestors. In this dispute he went to the  extent of denying the presence of any form of totemism among the  Yéi, except where this had been borrowed from the Marind. In this  he was decidedly wrong; his own data prove that totemism consti- tuted part of their tradition. However - and here he was right - it was a form of totemism which differed widely from the cult  totemism of the Marind which, combined as it is with multiple  totemism and an elaborate ancestor cult, is of the Australian  type. The totemism of the Yéi is more like that of the Keraki as  described by Williams, and that of the Kiwai as we know it from  the works of Landtman. It is a kind of totemism with hardly any  ritual implications. Unfortunately, Verschueren was not an anthro- pologist and was not familiar with any of these books.  His opinion that the yeva1e are not ancestors, and certainly  not ancestors of the type of the Marind-anim dema, is better  founded, though at times doubts about this arise. Many yeva1e are  localized spirits who stand in a certain relation to a particular  local jéi and can be invoked by its members. However, the myths  related in Chapter IX depict them as a kind of spirits which are  more akin to those of Landtman's Folktales than to the Marind- anim dema. The few examples we came across in Section 3 of the  previous chapter, as weIl as those we shall find in Chapter VIII,  point in the same direction. The Yéi are always on their guard  against the yeva1e, who, more of ten than not, are harbingers of  evil. Actually, there is only one weak point in Verschueren's  argument for refusing to classify the yevale with ancestors: the  few times he speaks of the Yéi-nan ancestors he omits to mention  the native term by which they are designated by his informants.  Nevertheless, this can hardly be a reason for not placing in him  the confidence which he deserves as a gifted and dedicated observ- er. The Ie ss so because the data furnished by him form a consist- ent and coherent whoIe. They con front us with an out-and-out  phallic cult of which Verschueren himself had not even an inkling.  Under these circumstances we are weIl advised to take him at his  word.  Two errors barred his way to a correct understanding of his  mythical material. The one is his underestimation of the signifi- cance of headhunting in Yéi-nan culture as a result of his regard- ing them (like so many others) as victims rather than as agents  </page> <page sequence="2"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 37  of the practice. Nevertheless, the fact that the Yéi preserve  not only the skulls but also the long bones of their victims and  arrange these into a kind of still-life displayed on the central  pole of the communal house - the Yéi are wholly unique in this  respect - should have warned him that there was more to it.  His second error was the result of his being confused by the  fact th at the Yéi have two main myths of origin. His conclusion  was that there are two mythical cycles, the one social and the  other magico-religious, and he treated these separately, the one  (the cycle concerned with Ndiwe, Nak and Telie) in the context  of the origin of the clans and moieties, the other in that of  magic and religion, disregarding the fa ct that this second "cycle"  is not really a cycle. It begins with one important myth, the  myth of the orei tree, which has little to do with the other  "religious" myths, which are relegated here to Chapter IX. The  myth of the orei tree, however, is given a place in this chapter,  not because it stands in contrast to the myths of Ndiwe, Nak and  Telie, but because it forms their complement. The reasons for  this will become apparent in due course.  2. The myth of Ndiwe  Like the upper Bian people and the Boadzi, the Yéi assume that they  did not originate in their present area of residence. Together with  the Boadzi, the upper Bian Marind, the Aroba [a Suki group?] and  the Kanum, they owe their existence to Ndiwe, the demiurge who  among all these tribes plays the role of originator. Ndiwe (also  called Ndiwa or Nggiwe) is not a creator, but rather an improver  who brings the shape of man to perfection and gives him his social  institutions. Before Ndiwe's intervention the upper Bian Marind had  no females, the Boadzi lived underground as pigs and the Aroba were  cassowaries at the mercy of a malignant supreme being. The Yéi, for  their part, lived somewhere in the middle Fly region 1 in a subterra- nean hole, together with the other "nations" just mentioned. None  of them had either mouths or noses, eyes or ears. It was Ndiwe who,  by cutting them open, finished their human shape. They immediately  started talking. Ndiwe listened. Hearing their speech, he said to  some of them: "You are upper Bian Marind", to others: "You are  Boadzi", while others again he called Yéi, and finally there were  those whom he called Kanum. He then divided them into groups and  escorted them one by one to the country where they belonged: the  Marind to the upper Bian, the Boadzi to the upper Fly, and the Yéi- nan to the Maro.  In a more detailed version we are told that Ndiwe came from the  east or northeast [the three documents are not consonant on this  point]. He came from the middle Fly, and was accompanied by his  old mother. He brought the ancestors of the Yéi. They entered the  Maro reg ion at Karopo, a place on the upper Bárki River, east of  the heart of the present-day Yéi-nan territory. Arriving on the  Burrau (the Maro River) , they discovered the territory to be occu- pied by other people. But Ndiwe commanded: "These people do not  belong here. We must chase them away; so we must fight them".  (According to an alternative version, told at Kwél, the Burrau did  </page> <page sequence="3"> 38 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  not yet exist at that time. It came into being af ter the first oc- cupants had been expelled.)  The ancestors who followed Ndiwe did not have any personal names.  Ndiwe now gave each of the men his proper name, at the same time  handing him a kupe, a disc-shaped stone with a hole in the centre.  Through this hole a stout stick, usually a rattan one, may be pass- ed, making the whole thing into a club, the formidable weapon of  the Yéi. But the stones may be of various kinds. Besides the disc- shaped stones, the kupe proper, there are also egg-shaped ones  (bawa) and stones that are notched (giri-giri). They all serve the  same purpose, and the term kupe can be used for all of them.  Editor's comment. The kupe mayalso be placed on the pöggul, the  ceremonial staff (and club) of the gab-elul (headman) described  in Section 2 of Chapter 11. The pöggul is the exact counterpart  of the Marind pahui, described and discussed in Van Baal 1966:  617ff., 662f., and 730-43 as one of the latter's most important  ritual attributes. Among the Marind the disc-shaped stone (kupa)  is a female symbol, the egg-shaped one (wagané; Yéi: bawa) a male  one (Van Baal 1966:273). On their use as parts of the pahui (Yéi:  pöggul) and their possible association with each of the two moie- ties see Van Baal 1966 Chapter XII, in particular p. 742. It is  not impossible that the Yéi made a similar distinction, equipping  the Nak with a bawa and the Telle with a kupe for their pöggul.  Unfortunately, this must remain hypothetical.  Another interesting character in this context is the old mother  who accompanies Ndiwe on his peregrinations in the territory of  the Yéi. She plays an important part in Boadzi myth and ritual,  notably in the ritual surrounding headhunting. What is more, she  is identified with the stone disc on the pahui of the Boadzi, an  association which is in perfect harmony with her place in the  present story. For relevant literature see Van Baal 1966:590-7,  726ff., and in particular 730.  Ndiwe, then, handed such a stone to each of his companions, simul- taneously defining the receiver's identity by bestowing a personal  name on him, viz. Kupe gön, bu Dambu ... Kupe gön, bu Kello ("Here  is a kupe, you are Dambu ... you are Kello"), etc. 2 And this, the  Yéi will add, was the origin of the jéi. [Note that Dambu and Kelle  are jéi names!]  But Ndiwe did more. According to an informant from Kwél, Ndiwe  had kept behind two kupe passed over a shaft topped by a beautiful- ly carved fretwork blade. Once everyone had received a kupe, Ndiwe  let the men run a race. The two winners were Nak and TelIe. Each  of them received one of these beautiful ceremonial clubs, pöggul,  and thus became the first gab-elul, war-leaders, of the Yéi-nan.  Now fighting broke out. They first expelled the people of the  southerly area and chased them down the Maro River to beyond Tayas.  Then they returned to drive out the occupants of the upper reaches  of the river and chased them to the Kumbe and the Bian. On their  flight the Northerners left their drums behind, which were taken by  Ndiwe and his men. Then Ndiwe said: "Now this is your country", and  he gave each of the ancestors a territory of his own. These ances- </page> <page sequence="4"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 39  tors then took their kupe and everyone laid his kupe down in the  centre of his own territory. And this division of the land into jéi  territories has persisted until the present day. Af ter the division  of the available land among the jéi, a big feast was held at Gelei,  a place near Benóong [exact location unknown] .. (According to an al- ternative version from Bupul the Yéi-nan originated here, in Gelei,  during the celebration. They emerged one by one from a hole in the  ground. )  The story testifies that the jéi originated as territorial groups,  and that their names are those of their ancestors [cf. above and  note 2], which names sometimes do and sometimes do not have a mean- ing in the Yéi language. There is no question of any totemic rela- tion, however. Down to the present day the jéi-stones are still kept  where they were laid down, each in its own territory. They are call- ed komen, in order to distinguish them explicitly fr om other stones  and objects which spring from the yevale themselves and will be dis- cussed later [which promise remained unfulfilled]. These komen are  deeply revered but not worshipped. They are simply designated the  "heart" or "navel" of the territory.  [In ms. C the data on the komen are summarized as follows: The  ancestors laid down their kupe as the navel of their property in the  centre of the territory assigned to them. Their descendants, who  have adopted the name of their ancestor as the name of their group,  consider the still treasured kupe as the centre of their inherited  territory. These stones, komen, are reverently preserved but not  worshipped, uniess, as is quite of ten the case, they have been  chosen by yevale for their abode.]  Editor's comment. The passage just quoted from ms. C is of inter- est because it gives substance to the distinction made between  reverence and worship. Evidently, there is no question of ritual  taking place at the location of the komen unless it is at the  same time the residence of a yevale. The same idea is expressed  in the curious passage introducing the account of the myth of  Ndiwe in ms. B, a passage which we have passed over in silence  because it contains a few elements which, in an introductory state- ment, would have a confusing rather than an elucidating effect.  The passage, which is more in place here, runs as follows:  "As has already been noted by Wirz, the entire jéi system is  focused on a stone of the most fantastic form. Every jéi, as a  territorial group, has somewhere in its territory, on some spit  of land or other - sometimes in a coconut garden, then again in  a clearing in a dark forest, in a bamboe grove, or simply in the  centre of an open plain - a stone which is guarded with every  sign of respect. The ground around the stone is kept scrupulously  clean, and croton shrubs are planted around it, with one or more  hardwood poles added. These stones are cal led komen; they are  the permanent property of the local jéi and are deeply respected."  However, as even Wirz admitted: "Der Schwerpunkt liegt nicht so- sehr in dem Naturobjekt aber im Jewale, dasz er unter Umständen  darstellt" (i.e., It is not 50 much the natural object as the  yevale occasionally represented by it that matters) (Wirz 1925  (III) :202).3  </page> <page sequence="5"> 40 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  Although the quotation is incorrect and out of place - as Wirz  said this not of the komen but of the totems which he believed  to be associated with the yevale - the author's intention is evi- dent: the place derives its ritual importance from the occasional  presence of a yevale. The description of its outward appearance  is intriguing. Why are one or more hardwood poles planted here?  The answer is not too difficult. What can they represent but the  shaft of the club or pöggul from which the ancestors took their  kupe when, on their return from the campaign against the foreign  occupants of their territory, they put it down at the navel of  their newly acquired territory? It is a tempting thesis, reminis- cent of the procedure, described later on in this chapter (Section  7), whereby a returning war party pay their respects to the arow  yevale, where the gab-elul then plants the shaft of his pöggul  af ter taking off its kupe (the fretwork blade having already dis- appeared in the battle).  It is a hypothesis to which we shall have to return later. Here  another problem demands our attention. It is raised by Verschue- ren's description of the komen as stones of the most fantastic  shape, while at the same time assuring us that they are kupe. He  does not explain the discrepancy. Apparently we must assume that  the Yéi, in the firm conviction that their komen are the one-time  kupe of their ancestors, did not bother too much about such devi- ations in form. They were once kupe, and in things religious this  is enough. Nevertheless, further inquiry into this matter teaches  us that the Yéi were not as indifferent on this point as Verschue- ren's rather haphazard description suggests. Wirz, too, has seen  these stones and has given a short description of five of them.  Two were stones of the size of a human head (111:204), the third  was a real kupe (111:207), the fourth was a stone with an artifi- cially incised groove, suggesting its former use in grinding axe- stones, and the fifth again a kupe, but this time with an unfin- ished hole (both p. 208).  3. The myths of Nak and Telle  [The mythical account of the exploits of the ancestors was broken  off at the point where they met at Gelei to hold a big feast. From  now on no more ment ion is made of Ndiwe. Af ter having divided the  people into clans and moieties and distributed land and kupe among  them, he fades out of the story.]  The feast at Gelei was a glorious feast, but it ended in chaos,  as a result of the crime committed by Belám, a Marind man of the  Kumbe River who, with his wife Genggen and their baby daughter,  lived in the bush not far from Gelei.  Every day Genggen went to the nearby swamp to catch fish, leaving  Belám alone with their little daughter. Belám was working on a new  drum, which would bear his own name, Belám. However, he also had  to take care of the child. It was so young that it was still lying  in a cradle. This caused him a great deal of trouble and vexation.  When his wife stayed away toa long, this irritated him. Neverthe- less, she brought home fish and sago, and thus he controlied him- self and kept quieto In the long run, the constantly returning bur- </page> <page sequence="6"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 41  den of having to look af ter the child became too much for him, the  more 50 because he heard the sounds of the dancing and singing of  the merry-makers at Gelel every night. His drum was almost finished  and, putting the final touches to his work, he sang: Oh, oh, oh,  Belám ah, Gelel ago ah. But the child started crying again. It  drove Belám out of his mind. Suddenly he arose, took the baby,  cradle and all, and threw it into the fire, where everything burned  to ashes. He then took his drum and hurried off to Gelel, where he  was jostled into the centre of the crowd of dancers, 50 that his  wife would not be able to find him.  On coming home, Genggen soon discovered what had happened. She  was furious. She fastened the sharp nails of a cassowary to her fin- gers and toes and tried them out on a banana stem. They passed right  through. She now turned herself into a lean dog and went to GeleI  in search of her husband. All over the feasting-ground she sniffed  at the legs of the dancers, who, in their irritation, kicked her  off, wondering who the owner of that lean dog could beo But Genggen  did not give up till she became tired and lay down on a rubbish- heap to sleep. The second day she was more successful. She managed  to penetrate into the inner ring of dancers and there, indeed, found  Belám dancing. She straightaway started biting and scratching at  his body with her cassowary nails. Belám screamed and cried 50 loud- ly that all the dancers took a tremendous fright and ran off, back  to their country, without 50 much as thinking about their pos- sessions. Nak and Telie, too, ran off and did not come to rest un- til they reached the Obat River, where they had their domains on  opposite- sides of the river. (According to an alternative version  Telle fled alone to his house and Nak followed him later.) On their  flight each of them had salvaged at least some of his possessions,  Nak the fire and his bow and arrows, Telle the sago.  Nak and Telle were friends, and even more than friends: they were  men of the same age, yát. Consequently Nak invited Telle to go  hunting on one of the elevated spits of land on his side of the  river. "Let us go hunting, yát", said Nak. "All right, but how will  I catch any game?" asked Telie, because he did not have a bow. And  Nak answered: "You just throw a stick at the game". Telle replied:  "All right. You stay here and wait and I shall run around the hilI  and drive the game in your direction". He collected a couple of  sticks and then took off. He did not know that Nak had a bow and  arrows, nor that he had concealed them in a hollow tree. As soon  as Telle had left, Nak took them out and without any difficulty  shot a cassowary and a wallaby. He put his bow and arrows back in  their hiding-place, and painted a couple of sticks with the blood  of the animals he had killed. When Telle turned up, breathless and  empty-handed, he praised Nak's dexterity. "Yes", said Nak, "I aimed  carefully and hit them in the right spot". Then he fairly divided  the catch, and Telle returned to his own territory.  Nak secretly made a fire, singed the hair off his catch and roast- ed the meat. But Telle had to eat his meat raw, with hide and hair.  Fortunately he had sago which he mixed with the raw meat, whereas  Nak had to make do with sand for a side-dish. Consequently Nak's  teeth wore down unevenly, and more and more came to resemble those  of a wallaby.  </page> <page sequence="7"> 42 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  Whenever Nak and Telle hunted together, the same thing happened  all over again. At last Telle became suspicious. He thought: "Why  is it that Nak always catches the game and that he eats of it so  weil?" He asked Nak about it, who answered: "Weil, I always aim  very carefully at the head of the animal. That is where you must  hit them. And the meat, weil, it is dry because lexpose it to the  sun for some time." But Telle was on the alert. One day he received  a portion of meat with part of an arrow in it which had broken off  on striking the bone. Besides, part of the hide had been scorched  by fire. "Ah, that's it!", he thought, ukulede kene gen, ban kane  gen [translation lacking]. He said to Nak: "Yát! Let us go hunting  again; and this time I want to go a long, long way. When you no  longer hear me calling, you will know that I am far off." Before- hand he had decorated a pole in such a way that, from afar, it re- sembled a man wearing a headdress of cassowary and bird of paradise  feathers. He made off, now and then running very fast, and finally  disappeared in the bush, to return in secret to the place where he  had left Nak. The latter had been scanning the plain, and had sight- ed the feathered pole. He smiled and went to the hollow tree to  fetch his bow and arrows rand, according to another version, the  fire]. Telie, who had seen where he kept them, hurried off in search  of game. When he finally returned, Nak had already shot a few ani- mals. Telle was empty-handed, and complained: "I never catch any- thing!" Again Nak explained that he should try to hit the head,  and Telle replied: "Indeed, I should throw better. Perhaps I would  do better if you, yát, did the driving and I stayed here and waited."  Nak agreed and made off, but hardly had he disappeared when Telle  took the fire, the bow and the arrows from the hollow tree and  hurried back home. He set the savannah afire to let Nak have his  part of the fire, but kept the "head" of the fire for himself. In  the meantime Nak ran af ter him. As the grass-fire went out, he over- took Telle at Kindél, on the palwa River. But they did not fight.  They were yát. Nak praised Telle for his shrewdness and taught him  how to make a bow and arrows for himself. In return, Telle filed  Nak's long teeth until they we re as neat and even as his own.  The story of the fire and the bow is sometimes combined with that  of the sago, Telle giving sago in exchange for Nak's bow. Another  alternative version is the following: Nak asked Telle how he kept  his teeth so nice and even. Wishing to keep his possession of sago  a secret, Telle answered: "By adding mud to the sand which I eat  with my meat". Nak tried this out, but the mud stuck to his pa late  and he realized that Telle had tricked him. The next time that they  had hunted together, he secretly followed Telle on his way home and  saw how Telle took sago from a bag, and mixed it with the meat which  he had brought home. Now Nak had taken his two trained red cockatoos  with him. He ordered them to perch on the banana trees near Telle's  house, and there make all the noise they could. They did this, and  Telle immediately jumped to his feet to run af ter the cockatoos.  Meanwhile Nak snatched the bag with sago and ran off. Telle happen- ed by accident to look over his shoulder, and immediately realized  that he had been outwitted by Nak. Smiling, he returned, and said:  "Yát, you found it", and taught him the technique of sago-making.  The two red cockatoos also play a role in a variant version of  </page> <page sequence="8"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 43  the story of the fire which was told in Erambu. Telle had noticed  that Nak was burning his garden site. He wished to get hold of the  fire but could not come ne ar enough, because the two cockatoos  warned their master as soon as anyone approached. So he asked a po  mermer (lizard) cl inging to a coconut tree to steal the fire for  him. But the po mermer could not carry it. Then he appealed to a  bengkaron, a somewhat larger lizard with a tilted head, but the  bengkaron refused. Finally, he asked the small dagole lizard, this  time successfully so. Unfortunately, the firebrand was too large  and the dagole burned its chest. And this is why the dagole has a  red spot on its breast up to the present day. In return for the  fire Telle taught Nak everything about the sago.  The exchange motif recurs in the story of how Telle taught Nak  to build a house. Telle had a house roofed with sago leaves; Nak  slept under a large tree. Telle told Nak how to construct a house,  but Nak complained that he had no sago-trees there. "Then take  eucalyptus bark", Telle answered, and explained how to cut the bark  with a shell. He sat down, giving instructions, and Nak did the  work. When Nak had finished his house, they were both happy, Telle  because of the bow and arrows, Nak because of his house. And each  of them stayed in his own house.  There are lots of stories about Nak and Telie. One of these  relates how Nak terrified Telle by beating a drum which he had se- cretly manufactured. But the most instructive of all these stories  are those about their making a fish-trap together.  One day Nak said: "Yát, you should come here to fish. The water  is dropping. On your side of the river there is only bush, and the  fish are scarce there". As it happened, Nak had erected a weir  in the [small] river. On one side of this he had placed a number of  fish-traps (bubus). When they came to the river bank, Nak said to  Telie: "We must dive here. Each of us will take a strip of rattan  with him. If you see a fish, then wait till it opens its gilis. If  you are quick, you will be able to thrust the strip through them."  He pointed out where Telle should dive (on the side without the  fish-traps), and they both descended. Nak swiftly emptied his traps  and emerged with his rattan strip full of fish. But Telie, in spite  of all his efforts, caught no more than only one single fish. Back  on the river bank, they collected their catch and divided it into  two equal portions, because they were yát. But Nak mocked Telie,  saying: "You are just like a small boy with that tiny little fish  of yours".  Telie, weil aware that Nak had tricked him once again, kept  silent. The next morning he hid himself ne ar the weir and saw  how Nak pulled up his fish-traps, weil filled with fish, and then  placed the traps on a fallen tree to dry them in the sun. And to- ward evening he noticed Nak tying up the open ends of the traps and  placing them back again into the holes in the barrier under the  water. The next morning, before dawn, Telle emptied the traps. He  tied the fish to a rattan strip and hid everything under the water  on his side of the barrier. Putting on an innocent face, he now  went to Nak and proposed going fishing once more. This they did.  Telle emerged with his rattan full of fish and Nak empty-handed,  because Telle had forgotten to tie up the open ends of the traps  </page> <page sequence="9"> 44 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  af ter clearing them. Nak was furious. Back on the river bank, they  fought, Nak beating Telle with a fish-trap and Telle thrashing Nak  with the fishes. Then they made peace, and Nak told Telle how to  make and use a fishing-weir. He promised to come to Telle's side  of the river to help him construct one for himself.  So they worked together on a new barrier. Nak descended into the  river to stop the barrier with sago leaves which Telie, standing  on the upper edge of the barrier, handed to him. Now Telle was ac- tually a woman, though he was wearing a penis shell. Nak emerged  from the water, saying: "I am getting cold. I think it is your turn  to deseend." Saying this, he looked up and saw something really  startling. He cried out: Mugu gen bu, Elisame, Kamé Kamé!: "You  are of the Mugu- jéi, of the Elisame, of the Kamé jéi!" All three are  Telle jéi. And from this moment on he refused to call Telle yát.  Yet they finished the fish-weir and made a fire. Then they in- spected the fish-traps and collected an enormous arnount of fish.  Telle fetched firewood and nibung-spathes with which to raast the  fish, and Nak brought kava from his garden. That night Nak brewed  a really potent kava drink for Telie. He himself took only a small  sip. Telle got completely drunk, but Nak took a torch and inspected  Telle's genitals. That night he made her his wife. He gave her a  si nak (women's apron) and said: "You must discard your possé (penis  shell) because from now on you are my wife".  Finally [this is added in a noteJ, there is a last alternative  version which tells how Nak and Telle came to blows near a fish- trap and then changed into a nak ( = fish-eagle) and a telle ( =  hen-harrier) .  Editor's comment. There could be no better proof of totemism  arnong the Yéi than precisely this last addition to the myths  about Nak and Telie, made more or less as an afterthought. Only  here do we learn that their names are the names of birds of prey,  a fish-eagle and a hen-harrier. The pair finds an exact parallel  in the moiety totems of the Keraki, about which F.E. Williarns  wrote: "We may first briefly consider the hawks, which alone find  a wide and more or less consistent distribution as totems for the  two moieties. The two principal species which are cornrnonly ac- knowledged by Bangu and Sangara respectively (the two moieties)  are wana ... and inifiak ... The former is the large brown kite  with white breast which hunts for snakes and bandicoots; the  latter is a somewhat smaller white-headed hawk" (Williams 1936:  89). We shall not attempt an exact identification of the two  birds concerned. Geurt jens (Woordenboek pp. 406-7) identifies the  nak and telle (spelt tale by him) with the kidub and kéké of the  Marind, i.e. the fish-eagle and the hawk. The scientific names  are not as important as the question of why Verschueren never  gave a thought to the fact, altogether too familiar to him, that  his heroes bear birds' names. The answer is that he was too much  engrossed in their human traits, which led him to make the follow- ing cornrnent:  1. The most obvious feature of the stories of this cycle is that  they are concerned with ordinary human beings. They do not bear the  </page> <page sequence="10"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 45  marks of a "sacred history", but are purely human tales which mirror  the relations of dependence prevailing between the two moieties as  weil as between husband and wife. That Nak is the male and Telle  the female is not borne out by the scene on the fishing-barrier  alone; it is reflected throughout the whole cycle. Nak is a fisher- man and possesses such male articles as a bow and arrows, fire and  drum, whereas Telle has sago and a house. The stories are an ex- ample of how a husband and wife should supplement one another, form- ing a dualism based on true friendship and togetherness, which time  and again lapses into the comical conflicts arising from good- natured trickery. The story as a whole is a gem reflecting deeply  human, psychologically weil observed relations in which the recur- ring tensions are ultimately reconciled to give substance to their  unity.  2. The myths reflect the ideal relation between the moieties. The  one needs the other, and not merely because of the marriage system.  On every occasion of social importance the other moiety is invited  as the indispensable complement. Big hunting and fishing parties  require the cooperation of members of both moieties. At the cel- ebration of a marriage the young women (all of the bride's moiety)  assist the newly wed in making a new sago garden which, ultimately,  will be the property of the husband and his moiety. At a pig-feast  it is not the feast-givers who eat the pigs, but the guests of the  other moiety. At the inauguration of a newly finished canoe, others,  the members of the opposite moiety, must test the new dug-out.  3. The playful element characterizing the adventures of Nak and  Telle plays a comparable role in all celebrations. At the end of a  pig-feast, when the raisers of the pigs receive their share of the  meat, they find themselves suddenly drenched with water poured over  them by their guests to the boisterous hilarity of all those pres- ent. Something similar befalls the male guests who, on behalf of  their hosts, pull a newly finished canoe to the river bank. They  will suddenly find hot embers on their path, be besprinkled with  stinging ants, and be made the butt of other such jokes. Even the  mourning ritual has its playful elements. A few days af ter a mature  man's death, the wives of the deceased's in-laws [i.e. his classi- ficatory sisters!] present pantomimes portraying past events and  exploits in which the deceased has had a hand. The women are dress- ed up as males, and their travesty, combined with their clumsy imi- tations of male behaviour, are a source of mild amusement.  4. The question arises whether and to what extent this notion of  complementary dualism can be extended to the homosexual relations  between a boy and his pederast. True enough, he is always a member  of his own exogamous moiety. Men of the other moiety live too far  off to be able to participate in the daily guidance of the boy. Yet,  if we consider the boys as girls in disguise, their role reflects  that of Telle in the myth establishing the institution of moiety  dualism. She was a woman in the guise of a man, a brother who be~  came a wife. The travesty motif is clearly present in the episode  relating how Telle filed Nak's teeth. Nak had to lie down on the  ground with Telle sitting on top of him.  </page> <page sequence="11"> 46 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  4. The myth of the orei-tree  Editor's introduction. The myth of the orei-tree explains the  origin of the yevale. There are various myths of this category,  says Verschueren, but they all agree on the point that all yevale  "originated from the orei-tree (magic palm) ... (and) came to the  country in an orei-canoe which was made from that tree. And they  all took a chip of the orei-tree with them as a magical implement  (the kupör or bullroarer). At the end of their peregrinations  they all disappeared into the ground ... "  The elaborate version of the myth presented by Verschueren is  the one related in the southern part of the Yéi territory. "It  betrays relations with the Kanum as weIl as a certain influence  of the Marind", he adds. However, I must confess that I have not  been able to discover what these specific Marind-anim influences  can have been in this myth, unless the author means - as is prac- tically certain - that the myth bears clear traces of totemism,  just like the story of Nak and Telie. That these traces of totem- ism go back to Keraki (and allied) forms of totemism rather than  to Marind-anim influence need not be argued again.  A large orei-tree (a wild areca palm) stood somewhere in Elijéi, in  the open plain formed by the delta of the confluence of the Maro  and Wanggo rivers. Once upon a time all the yevale of the Boadzi,  the Marind and the Yéi had assembied here. But the Kanum were ab- sent. The tree stood inside the territory of the Aroba, a small  tribe usually classified with the yam-eating Kanum. Every night  the neighbouring Kanum heard the sound of singing and dancing. They  did not know where the sound came from. They went in search, and  finally came near the orei-tree. But every time they came near, all  the occupants of the tree entered their tree through a hole, and  all the Kanum were able to discover were the traces of a celebra- tion.  One of the Kanum men hid near the tree and listened. Af ter some  time he heard the sound of people inside the orei-tree. He went  home and told his tribal fellows: "They are lodged inside the hollow  orei-tree". He went to fetch rattan from the forest to tie his stone  axe to its shaft, because he wished to cut down the orei-tree. In  the meantime the yevale had come out again and were dancing, but  as soon as the man with the axe appeared, they ran back and crowded  into the hollow tree. The Kanum man took his axe and gave the tree  a hard blow. The tree was hollow and its bark very thin. The axe  struck one of the tree-yevale on the forehead, and this is why some  people suffer from headaches.  But the orei-tree feIl apart, and all the yevale came tumbling  out. Each of the yevale took a chip of the tree and took it to his  own country; these became the kupör, the bullroarer-like or spatula- like objects used in all forms of magic. And the wood-cutter took  fright and ran off to his house to teIl his people what had happen- ed.  The orei-tree had fallen to pieces, and each of these pieces con- stituted a canoe, in which the yevale went to their country. The  Yéi-yevale had their own canoe, and so had the Boadzi and the  </page> <page sequence="12"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 47  Marind. They all went their own way.  But Orei made all his men, the Yéi-yevale, enter his canoe  (Kwar).4 The canoe was full to the brim because, in addition to  the yevale, everything had been loaded into it that is typical of  the Obat River region. This included a slim hardwood palmtree, loam,  mud, sago, wild kapok, bamboo, and pandan trees. They put off. Orei  had pushed off his canoe with a certain kind of nibung, and now  wished to change it for a bamboo. But the nibung fell from the  canoe, and this is why nibung trees abound near the mouth of the  Obat. Then he began to scrape the ringworm scales off his body.  Where he threw them away at the mouth of the river's tributaries,  they turned into sago. The canoe was overloaded, and so he put a  yevale ashore at every tributary. At the mouth of the Jármu, Korew  was disembarked, at the Wuj River, Kupale, Godye was put ashore at  the Waimon, and Tsakwe at the Tawái. And each of the yevale was  given his kupör to take with him.  At the Sembe, Orei set Jögwul down, and gave him his kupör in  token of his authority there. At the Yelma, Paltye and Mub were  disembarked. The one is the yevale of the earth-hog [echidna?], the  other of the fish cal led ikan saku in Indonesian. Kworeo, the ikan  duri (Indonesian, meaning thorny fish), was set down here too, be- cause, as Orei said, we are still far too many in the canoe. In  Mamter he put Balgo, the yevale of Yoakema, ashore. With Balgo,  Dedegiam also left the canoe. And at Wanggepo he set Widi down.  When they arrived at the Yób River, Orei began to cut down a  tree (Indonesian name: pohon susu). It was meant to fall across the  Yób River. A friend of his by name of Wolpaka wanted to help him.  Orei had concealed the rattan strip by which he had tied his axe  to its shaft. Wolpaka, not knowing any better, tied his axe with  a bark string. He had hardly begun cutting when it snapped. Orei  said, "You had better look in the forest for a new string". Whilst  his friend was in the forest, Orei finished felling. The tree was  very high and began to swing. An ant-nest fell southward, and came  down near the mouth of the Wanggo River. But the nest of a wood- pigeon was hurled northward and landed near Beow. Af ter some time  his friend returned. Only then did Orei teach him that he should  use rattan for an axe-string. "Dunce", he said, "this will not work.  Turn around; there you will find rattan".*  The tree had fallen across the Yób River, and Orei told Wolpaka:  "You be long here. It is your home. Go up the river." And he pre- sented him with the yevale of the yam, of the tuba (Indonesian for  fish-poison) and of the stone axe, who were all with him in the  canoe. And Wolpaka set out. He accidentally lost his penis shell.  It changed into a turtle which crawled into the river. When Wolpaka  became aware of the loss, he put all his things down and went in  search. He found the shell and tried to pick it up. But the shell  said: "No; I am a turtle now, and I want to stay here". Wolpaka  returned to the spot where he had left his possessions, meaning to  * In Kwél the story of Orei and Wolpaka is related as one of the  adventures of Nak and Telle, a context which seems more appro- priate.  </page> <page sequence="13"> 48 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  pick them up. But his things cried out: "No, no! Leave us here, be- cause this is henceforward our country." Thus Wolpaka continued,  until he arrived at the head of the river, where he remained.  But Orei had continued on his way in his canoe, putting yevale  ashore everywhere. Arriving at the Omboge, he set down Daberow and  Alabel. Daberow changed into a cassowary, Alabel into an eel. At  the mouth of the Watseda, Yegerep went ashore, and near the Ugu,  Sangwol. At Bádgóbberter, in the vicinity of Kekayu, he set down  Bád, who entered a large rock which is still there. At Grigripele- bák he put a young girl ashore. By now the canoe had become very  light, and therefore he no longer let anyone out. All that had been  left in his canoe were the trees, the mud and the water-lilies. He  rowed straight on to the head of the river. There, at Mallin, he  put down his punting-pole. It changed into a bamboe clump. The  canoe had run aground. To set it afloat again, he went down on  his knees. The imprint of his knees is still visible there. But he  did not get the canoe afloat. He now unloaded everything that was  left: all the various kinds of sago, the yellow clay, the shells,  the frogs, the thick bamboe (Indonesian: buluh) and the abal (a  thorny kind of wood), and also a young girl whom he had brought  with him. Orei stayed there together with her. And he left the  canoe where it was. It had delivered all the yevale on its way,  each with his own arow and his own country.  My informants of Polka (Kekayu) admit that they certainly did not  mention the names of all the yevale who were put ashore from the  orei-canoe, but they are absolutely positive in their assertion  that all the yevale came by the orei-canoe. Those of the other  rivers [note that the journey here described is confined to the  Obat River only!] also came to their country by the orei-canoe.  Some assume that the canoe, at high water, travelled overland  to the Maro River, something which is technically quite feasible.  Others believe that Orei went all the way up the Maro River first,  and then returned to follow the Obat. The main point is that all  yevale originated from the orei-tree, that they were brought to  their home country in the orei-canoe, and that they all carried a  kupör with them as the symbol of their authority.  Editor's comment. Before turning to Verschueren's exposition on  the nature and functions of the yevale (and to his theories on  that subject) in the next section we will need to dwell for a  while on the factual content of the above myth, in particular  the identification of the yevale with the orei-tree and their  close association with the kupör. In ms. A Verschueren makes a  few revealing comments on this point, but before examining them  one purely formal problem will have to be solved. This is the  regular recurrence in mss Band A of an alternative term for  kupör, namely kupoi, or, less frequently, kupoï. The documents  being typewritten copies of Verschueren's handwritten papers, it  is obvious that the copyist (Father Hoeboer) had difficulties  with Verschueren's handwriting. As it is highly improbable for  kupoi to become corrupted into something like kupör in swift  writing, whereas it is easily conceivable that kupör would be  read as kupoi or kupoï, I have accepted kupör as the correct term.  </page> <page sequence="14"> IV The Faunding Myths af Yéi-nan Ritual 49  In ms. A Verschueren states that arei is the special kind of  wood of which bullroarers are made everywhere in South New Guinea.  "The Marind name is ganggei." From Van Baal 1966 we learn that  the word ganggei (gangai) is also used as an alternative term for  bullroarer (sasam) and even for pahui. The point is of interest  because in this same ms. A, Verschueren repeatedly designates the  concept of kupör with the word arei. Apparently, the two terms  are interchangeable. But there is more to it than that. Orei re- fers not only to the bullroarer or bullroarer-like object used  in ritual, and not only to the tree, either, but also to Orei,  the leader of all the yevale taken by him to their respective ter- ritories in a canoe which again is called arei. It is reminiscent  of the fact that the Marind-anim bullroarer, sasam, is in effect  the same as Sosom, the dema, who is the brother of Waba, the cen- tral dema of the great Mayo ritual.  Nevertheless, there is also a difference. Among the Marind the  sasam (bullroarer) is terminologically differentiated from the  tang, the bullroarer-like object used in all magie, the object,  too, which is presented to all the new initiates at theconclusion  of the Mayo initiation (Van Baal 1966:534). Outwardly, tang and  sasam differ anly in as far as the one has a hole for a cord to  swing the implement by, and the other does not. Among the Yéi the  two are terminologically identical as well. There, too, the new  initiate receives one (a kupör) during his initiation. Whether  this is one with or without a hole will be left undecided; really  important only is the fact that it is handed out to young males  at their initiation, and that every male must become identical  with arei by symbolically swallowing the implement. The ideal is  to become an orei-kerau, that is, an arei-man or medicine-man (cf.  Chapter V). What, then, does the implement stand for?  There can be no doubt on this point. As early as 1963 I argued  that everywhere in Sou th New Guinea and Australia the bullroarer  is the symbol par excellence of the male sex. Three years later  I elaborated the point with regard to the bullroarer among the  Marind-anim (Van Baal 1966:485ff.) and demonstrated that the  pahui is identical with the bullroarer, and, like the Yéi-nan  pöggul, symbolizes a large penis piercing a small vulva (Van  Baal 1966:724-43). This symbolism of the kupör turns the myth of  the arei-tree from just another myth of origin than that of Ndiwe,  into its logical as well as symbolical complement. Ndiwe's men  brought female symbols to the territory, the kupe which are kept  in the centres (navels) of their respective territories. In con- trast, Orei's men brought male symbols, kupör, which as su eh  stand for the shafts which turn the kupe from mere stones into  formidable war-clubs or ceremonial pöggul. We noted above  (Section 2) that on the site of a kamen hardwood poles are never  absent, and also that, on the return of a war party, the gab-elul  leaves the remains of his pöggul (notably its shaft) at the resi- dence of the araw yevale, a residence described in the same terms  as that of a kamen. One thing is certain: the kamen (kupe) is by  origin associated with warfare, which kind of association is not  foreign to the kupör, either, for when the central headhunting  pole of a new house is erected, a kupör is planted at its side  </page> <page sequence="15"> 50 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  (see Chapter VII, Section 3).  We will have to go more deeply into this matter. To that end a  closer examination of all Verschueren's data and theories on the  yevale is necessary. Not only are his explanations of ten con- fusing, but his facts also give rise to controversy. For instance,  he states that all the yevale originate fr om the orei-tree and  that they all brought a kupör with them. Yet there are also fe- male yevale, amd though we are not told anywhere that they, too,  brought a kupör, this is nowhere denied, either.  5. The yevale and their role in the headhunting ritual  At the outset of his observations on the yevale in the uncompleted  chapter on Religion and Magic in ms. B, Verschueren states that  the term yevale is best translated with "spirit", more or less in  the sense of the Marindinese term dema, but with the exclusion  of the latter's connotation of totem-ancestor. The yevale consti- tute a group of anthropomorphic beings, gifted with exceptional  powers, who are spread all over the territory. Af ter performing  their extraordinary feats, they all settled in one or another  area inside the country, always the basin (arow) of one of the  numerous affluents of the Maro River, where they retired in some  such place as a tree, a weil, a brook or a stone. Obviously, the  tree or the stone is not considered as a yevale by the Yéi, being  no more than the place of residence of a definitely man-like  being. Such places are revered as sacred places by all the people  of the relevant arow.  There are male and female yevale, and though apparently the  Telle preferably worship female and the Nak male yevale, this  cannot be generalized for the whole of the territory. In ms. A,  however, the author is more specific, saying:  Among the yevale males and females are of about equal numbers. It  is intriguing that almost all the female yevale are found in Telle  territory, and the male ones in that of Nak. This once again stress- es the male-female relation, and this time not only in the social  field, but in the magico-religious one as weil.  Editor's comment. Actually, this paragraph contains one of the  most dubious of all of Verschueren's statements concerning the  yevale. The myth related in the previous section rarely ever men- tions the sex of the yevale who were put down from the orei- canoe, though the story seems to imply that, with two exceptions,  they all were males. Of these two exceptions one is the consort  of Orei, the other a girl disembarked somewhere ne ar the head of  the river; moreover, neither of the two is explicitly connected  with a specific arow. The one yevale who, besides Orei, is expli- citly identified as a man is Wolpake. He is the arow-yevale of  the Yób River, which is not a Nak but aTelie arow (cf. the map  in Section 3 of Chapter 11). What is more, the final phrase of  the quotation from ms. A with its emphasis on Nak and Telle and  their male-female relation strongly supports the suspicion that  the association of the sex of the yevale with that of Nak or  </page> <page sequence="16"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 51  Telle is a generalization based on an over-simplified interpre- tation of the existing moiety-dualism rather than on the facts  yielded by research. Verschueren's interpretation of the impact  of moiety dualism represents, in fact, a misjudgement of the dia- lectics inherent in dualism. It never goes to the extent of op- posing an all-male to an all-female moiety. Besides, the myth it- self repeatedly presents Telle as a male.  The worship of the yevale is connected primarily with the fact that  they unite the various jéi occupying a common arow through a new  bond of a religious nature. They all share the same yevale.  What, then, is the relation between the yevale and humans? The  yevale are not creators; hardly any of them are said to have made  or transformed anything at all. They are not spirits of the dead or  ancestors, either, because they have acquired their functions in  their human, corporeal form, a form cast off by the dead. 5 What  they really are is guardians of the rules of morality, judges of  the good and evil acts of mankind. Virtually all of them are asso- ciated with one or other aspect of human life, with regard to which  specific aspect they give the individual their support or punish  him when he misbehaves. Because of the strong impact of war on Yéi- nan culture, several of them have a close relation with headhunting.  Editor's comment. Ms. A is more detailed on one point. It says  that some things which are dear to the Yéi originated or received  their present form through the medium of yevale, adding that we  never find this stressed in the mythology, and thus conveniently  forgetting that the myth of the orei-tree makes mention of several  of such cases. One page earlier the same document states that ad- mittedly several yevale had all sorts of goods which are useful  for mankind, such as yams and fish, with them on their arrival in  their specific arow, but also that no indications are found of  any specific relation between a yevale and his treasures, or the  descent or family relations of the jéi concerned. In other words,  there is no totem relation. Ms. Badvances similar views. It  states that in a few, rather rare, cases the yevale appear as a  kind of totem-ancestor, but adds that, nevertheless, these totems  have no specific relationship with the peple concerned. The author  stresses that this totemic element is found only among the sou th- ern Yéi, and that this suggests borrowing from neighbours,notably  the Marind, based on a partialor complete misunderstanding.  In the introduction to the present chapter the remark was made  th at the totemism of the Yéi, far from having been adopted from  the Marind, is akin to that of the more easterly tribes, a view  which was corroborated in my comment on Nak and Telle (Section 3,  above). The myth of the orei-tree includes several examples of a  yevale turning into an animal (fish, an echidna, a cassowary),  and even speaks of the yevale of the yam and the tuba. As the  yevale concerned are bound to a specific arow, and every arow has  connections with at least one jéi, arelation between yevale,  totem and jéi seems obvious. But Verschueren denies this, at  least for the more northerly communities. He also denies the exis- tence of totemic food taboos. Now, totemism can exist without  </page> <page sequence="17"> 52 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  food taboos but not without clans or other social groupings with  an exclusive relation with the totem. Must we agree with Verschu~  ren, then, that totemism is, at the very best, an imported insti- tution among the Yéi? Most certainly not. Later, in the chapter  on Death and Burial, we will come across the use of a maker, a  sign used for identifying either its manufacturer or a particular  addressee. These maker are of a totemic nature and are used as the  distinctive mark of the totem group concerned, a fact which is  documented in detail by Nevermann. In other words, totems are  connected with groups, and there are no indications that this is  confined to the southern groups.  On the contrary, the data collected by Wirz provide undeniable  evidence that the more northerly jéi, too, had their totems. Per- haps not all of them did, for Wirz states (1925(111) :202) that  the Yéi include clans without a totem, a circumstance due to the  fact that their yevale (translated as "ancestor" in the sense of  clan-ancestor by him) had no relation with a particular natural  species or object. In this translation of yevale with "ancestor"  lies the reason for Verschueren's stubborn refusal to recognize  the totemism of the Yéi as genuine. He does not deny that certain  jéi have specific relations with certain yevale and consider these  yevale as belonging to them, but only that these relations can be  described in terms of descent. His point is that yevale are not  ancestors, even though in some cases they do resembie them. For  Verschueren, who derived his knowledge of totemism from the Marind- anim form, the descent relation is essential for totemism. This  explains his contempt for Wirz and Nevermann, as weil as his at- tempts to play down the facts concerning Yéi-nan totemism to the  extent of making himself guilty of tendentious description.  The yevale punish those who misbehave, for which the sanctions  applied are illness and death. The punishing aspect is predomi- nant and is more in evidence than those of mutual support and  assistance. In the chapter on Sickness and Healing quite a number  of data have been assembied which are unanimous on the point that  the cause of illness lies invariably in sins against tribal rules  and norms. These illnesses are of two kinds, namely male or fe- male, and it is interesting that the male illnesses are, in prin- ciple, always curable, whereas the female ones, those caused by  the female yevale Baderam, may bring on death. But we should not  anticipate too much what will be discussed in detail in Chap- ter VI, and confine ourselves to a consideration of what ms. B  has to say on the nature of the yevale in general. This is that,  all things considered, the yevale are not feared because they  are respected, but respected because they are feared, an idea  subscribed to also in ms. A.  This statement is too general, however. Ms. A, without for a  moment denying the fear inspired by the yevale, stresses that  they also give help. Every yevale has his own arow and inside  that arow takes care of everything, though this care may of ten  be specialized. One will ensure a good game-bag, another a rich  catch of fish; one will pro vide fire, another garden produce. But  in principle they are all universal in their responsibility,  which is most emphatically reflected in the expectation that the  </page> <page sequence="18"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 53  yevale will give assistance on headhunting expeditions. In the  sphere of headhunting the active communication of the local com- munity with its yevale is at its most intensive. Af ter every  headhunt the heads taken are immediately taken to the yevale's  residence to show him the catch. And that is not all. A grand  feast is held in the presence of the heads in the same spot. The  area around the yevale's residence is cleaned up and decorated,  and the ceremony is concluded with a meal. Besides, even before  the expedition the community of the males has visited the yevale  to invoke his protection, because, according to the senior men,  formerly the yevale went with the headhunters in person to see  to it that they made a good catch. Ms. B discusses these topics  in more general terms. It states that the abodes of the yevale  were kept meticulously clean, that their assistance was invoked  whenever the people concerned were in need of anything,and that  it was more specifically a headhunt which prompted them to sol- icit the yevale's assistance and to offer a thanksgiving when  all had gone well.  Af ter a short observation on the respect paid the yevale also  when the Yéi speak of them in daily life, the document turns to  a more theoretical consideration of the subject.  Characteristic of the yevale is their magical power, their under- world aspect: theyare said to originate from the orei-tree (amagic  palm);. they travelled in an orei-canoe; they all brought a chip of  the orei-tree with them as a magic implement (the kupör or bull- roarer), and they finally disappeared into the ground. The lat ter  circumstance contrasts them with the sun. As for the sun, the few  times there seems to be mention of an absolute, supreme being, this  being is the sun. Finally, some details from the total cycle of  myths give rise to the thesis that they all form part of a single  great moon-myth, the moon as such standing in opposition to the sun.  6. Editor's synthesis  The author's final observations on magic and the underworld, on  the possible role of the sun as a supreme being, and on the rela- ti on between the yevale and a supposed moon-myth tell us more  about the difficulties of the author in placing the yevale in a  more general context than about the forms of belief current among  the Yéi-nan. The available data do not give any ground for such  speculations. There is never any mention of an underworld, nor  is there any mythical material on hand which can be interpreted  as a moon-myth, let alone that the moon is mentioned in it. Refer- ences to the sun are confined to the statement that the souls of  men who have died in combat go skyward in the direction of the  sun (see Chapter VII, Section 1), and nowhere is there any question  of a supreme being. The one thing that is certain is that the  author uses the latter term loosely, even extremely loosely. In  one place (p. 5) he refers to the yevale as supreme beings!  Besides, these reflections on the nature of the yevale general- ly are always ad hoc and dependent on a fortuitous context which  at the given moment was foremost in the author's mind. A case in  </page> <page sequence="19"> 54 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  point is the statement about the respect always shown the yevale.  This is not true. They are regularly chased away without any sign  of respect (Chapter 111, Section 3; Chapter VIII, Sections 1, 2).  Another is the statement that all the yevale came by the orei- canoe and carried a kupör. I have already expressed my doubts  on this point. It is evident that the yevale are of different  kinds, and above all we are in need of a more systematic de scrip- tion of these various kinds.  There must be myriads of yevale. We are told that they sneak  unseen into the communal house and make the children ill (Chap- ter 111, Section 3). Before hauling a newly hewn dug-out from its  pI ace in the jungle, the yevale must be chased away (Chapter VIII,  Section 1); the same must be done at the pigsties before a pig- feast. Apparently these yevale are just malignant. A really malig- nant one is the ogress of Chapter IX, Section 2, who is killed by  crocodiles or annihilated by fire. In all these cases there is  no ancestorship involved at all; they are merely (more or less)  localized dangerous spirits who have to be avoided, chased away  or, in myth, killed. Even the benign woman yevale of Chapter IX,  Section 1, cannot be an ancestress, either; she is carried off by  the Boadzi. There is no referer.ce to the orei-tree in connection  with the yevale mentioned thus faro Apparently informants have  not been questioned on this point.  If they had been, the re sult might still have been negative be- cause the yevale originating from the orei-tree are different.  They are associated with authority over the arow of their area  of residence, with the origin of certain plants and animaIs, and  with the headhunting ritual, in other words, with positive func- tions of protection for certain specified processes and activi- ties, among them hunting, fishing, gardening, the fire, and, the  most important of all, headhunting (see above~ Not mentioned above  are the yevale involved in healing rituals. They are, for the so- called "male" illnesses, the bamboo and the rattan yevale. No  names are mentioned for them, but their totemic relation with  plants which provide the raw materials for the implements of the  headhunter (the bamboe knife and the handle of the club respecti- vely) makes this understandable. The situation is different with  respect to Baderam (Chapter 111, Section 3; Chapter VI), the  yevale of the female illnesses who spirits a woman's apron into  her victim's body. Reportedlya special myth is told about her.  We are kept in ignorance of its contents, but a woman's apron is  not quite congruous with a kupör, an instrument, moreover, which  is more beneficial in its effects.  The ancestor role imputed to the yevale by Wirz has already  been discussed (Section 5 above), our conclusion being that the  relationship between a yevale and "his" jéi is not definable in  terms of descent but in the vaguer ones of "belonging to". We  will not need to return to this point, as we will to that of the  kupör. Of some four or five of the yevale it is explicitly stated  that they had their kupör with them, and of one of these that  Orei handed him his kupär at his departure in token of his author- ity. The supposition that the term kupör is used here as an alter- native for pöggul, the ritual implement which is the symbol of  </page> <page sequence="20"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 55  the gab-elul's office (Chapter 11, Section 2), is not too far- fetched. It certainly argues in favour of an arow yevale whose  special function is the protection of the party of head- hunters, whom he accompanies on their expedition. The fact that  the kupör (whether or not it is a pöggul) functions as a symbol  of authority constitutes another argument against the supposition  that female yevale could ever have carried one.  However, a caution is weil in place here. Although the various  yevale all acquired their own arow in the course of their journey  in the orei-canoe, this does not mean that they are all arow  yevale. The arow yevale is the spirit of the headhunting ritual  who affiliates several jéi into a common worship as weil as head- hunting unit (Chapter 11, Section 2; Section 5 above). On p. 51  Verschueren also stated that not all yevale, but only several of  them are connected with headhunting. Yet, yevale not associated  with headhunting have their own arow as weil. The point is that  the term arow denotes not a genealogical, but a geographical con- cept (Chapter 11, Section 1) and can be used in different con- texts. If one tries to trace the orei-canoe journey down the Obat  River on the map, one glance will suffice to convince the student  that it stopped at many more rivers which became the specific  arow of the yevale who disembarked there than there are or pos- sibly can be headhunting-arow. The arow yevale, or war-gods, form  a special group among the numerous yevale who maintain positive  relations with certain jéi. As war-gods, they are more appropri- ate -bearers of the kupör than anyone. Though other male yevale  mayalso be associated with the kupör as the indispensabie imple- ment in most forms of magic, the kupör is closely connected with  the headhunting pole in the centre of the communal house (Section  4, p. 49), and, as we have just noted, mayalso be associated with  the pöggul.  7. A note on headhunting  Headhunting was instituted by Ndiwe. Though headhunting as such  is not explicitly mentioned in the story, the fact that Ndiwe  equipped his men with kupe, the essential component of the head- hunter's club, and moreover two of them with a pöggul, leaves no  room for doubt on this point. The war-gods proper, however, are  the ye7ale originating from Orei. This circumstance alone is  enough for us to assume some kind of a relationship between the  myth of Ndiwe and that of Orei. Verschueren, too, inclined toward  this view, but his reflections on this point led him into specu- lations of a pseudo-historical nature which are not very helpful.  In a note on the Orei myth he wrote:  The contrast between the social cycle dealing with the origin of  mankind and that concerning the yevale is evident. Both cycles run  parallel to the extent that neither the origin of mankind nor that  of the yevale is considered as a tribal affair, but both are put in  a kind of "international" context. Ndiwe accompanied not only the  Yéi, but also the upper Bian people, the Boadzi and the Kanum on  their path through life. The yevale who congregated in the orei- </page> <page sequence="21"> 56 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  tree belonged to the Boadzi, the Marind and the Yéi. But there is  also a contrast between mankind and the yevale. Mankind came into  existence earlier, and the yevale owe their origin to human beings  (the Kanum) who were already present. The activities of the yevale  are of no importance for mankind until weIl af ter they have been  released through human interference.  Editor's comment. I do not believe that this brings us to the  he art of the matter. In order to arrive at a more meaningful in- terpretation we should first surnrnarize what we know of the head- hunting practices of the Yéi. Our information on this point is  scant.  In the introduction to the myth of Ndiwe, I pointed out (Sec- tion 1 above) that the Yéi are unique in their treatment of their  war booty. The heads were suspended from a two-metre long rattan  loop, with the long bones of the victims fastened at either end  to each side of the loop, like the rungs of a ladder (cf. lVirz  1925(III):Tafel VIII no. 1, and cover). The artefact was ultima- tely suspended from the central pole of the house, where it mark- ed the dividing-line between the soama and wake. The presence of  the long bones (those of the legs and arms of the victims) is  suggestive of cannibalism. The latter supposition is confirmed  in one of the teachers' papers and in the myth of Wane, the good  sister, at the end of Chapter IX, Section 1, where cannibalism  is presented as a normal practice.  We also know that of the gab-elul of a particular arow the first  in rank was the headrnan whose jéi "owned" the arow yevale (Chap- ter 11, Section 2). And further that, in spite of Verschueren's  eulogies on the gab-elul as an arbiter and whatever else (Chap- ter 11, Section 2), he was first and foremost a (ritual) war- leader (Chapter VIII, Section 4). Of his functions as such we  only know that, before a war party set out, the community of the  males paid its respects to the arow yevale and invoked his pro- tection, and above all requested his participation in the expe- dition (Section 5 above). Once the party had met the enemy, the  headman tried to thrust his pöggul between the legs of a fleeing  enemy so that its fretwork top broke off. He would then raise the  shaft of the implement, now simply a club with a kupe at its end,  and feIl the enemy by striking him between the shoulder-blades.  The club was taken back home together with the remains of the  shattered fretwork, which had been collected on the spot, and  were afterwards deposited near the residence of the arow yevale  (cf. ms. B, p. 31). The document does not teIl what happened fol- lowing the felling of the victim, but on this point we can be  certain. As everywhere in these parts, the victim will have been  beheaded with the aid of a bamboe knife. The document restricts  itself to the information that on its return, the war party goes  to the residence of the arow yevale for a thanksgiving. The gab- elul, af ter taking the stone ring (kupe) off the shaft of his  damaged pöggul, carries it ceremonially around the misár, the  pole with the heads, and inserts the shaft in the qround near  the yevale.  Ms. A gives additional information (on p. 14). The heads are  </page> <page sequence="22"> IV The Founding Myths of Yéi-nan Ritual 57  taken to the yevale's place for display (apparently they are sus- pended from the misár). The place is cleaned and decorated, and  the ceremony is concluded with a meal. The au thor does not pro- vide any further information, but there can hardly be any doubt  that this was a cannibalistic meal.  One problem that remains is where the yevale's residence was.  Obviously this was at the komen. In Section 2 above we pointed  out that the komen is quite of ten chosen as a place of residence  by a yevale. The description of the place testifies that it is  suitable for the holding of a headhunting ceremony. It is deco- rated with croton shrubs and hardwood poles. The latter feature  in particular suggests that the place was once used for some cer- emonial purpose including the planting of hardwood poles. The  only occasion about which we know of such a thing happening is  the final headhunting ritual (particularly in connection with the  misár and the shaft of the gab-elul's pöggul). Besides, as has  been argued in Section 4 above, the komen is, ritually, a kupe,  and as such is directly associated with headhunting. On top of  all this, what the gab-elul does on the return of the war party,  namely remove the kupe from the shaft of his damaged päggul which  he then inserts in the ground near the yevale, is the exact com- plement of what the ancestors did on their return from the cam- paign against the foreign occupants of the country. They removed  their kupe and laid them down in the centre of their respective  territories as the latter's navels.  The symbolism is plain. Ndiwe was accompanied by his mother,  Atu, the Bad Woman of Boadzi ritual and mythology (Section 2  above). She is the instigator of the practice of headhunting and  is identical with the kupe, the implement which the ancestors  placed on the ground as a vulva awaiting renewed copulation with  the kupör (pöggul). In my analysis of the functions of the pahui,  the Marind-anim pöggul, I arrived at the conclusion that head- hunting is in these parts a symbolic form of copulation (Van  Baal 1966:725-45). It may in fact even be classified as a fertil- ity rite, which conclusion I elaborated in my contribution to  Gilbert H. Herdt's book on ritual homosexuality in Melanesia (in  the press) . Fertility is, ultimately, the prerogative of the  males, and they promote it by killing: life springs from death,  just as it does from sexual intercourse. The interconnection of  the two is embodied in the pöggul, the death-inflicting implement  which is at the same time a penis piercing a vulva.  Subconsciously, the men are aware that their almost exclusive  claims to fertility are void. In this context Verschueren's re- marks on the temporal precedence of Ndiwe over the yevale are of  interest. Only, it is not mankind in general, nor even Ndiwe who  came prior to the yevale, but who came first of all is Atu, the  great mother of both Ndiwe and mankind, who lies waiting as a  stone vulva - also a deadly implement - for renewed fertilization  by the warriors, the orei-men, the bearers of kupör and pöggul,  who, like the yevale, are maleness incarnate. Yet no mention is  made of the komen. On the surface, all the honour goes to the  males. All the same, the presence of the woman, whether she be  called Atu, kupe or komen, is the basic condition for the honour  </page> <page sequence="23"> 58 Jan Verschueren's Description of Yéi-nan Culture  that is paid to the arow yevale. And it is probably no coinci- dence that Orei and Ndiwe both came fr om the east. The east is  the direction in which most of the Yéi-nan's headhunting expedi- tions led them.  To a reader unacquainted with the ethnography of the southern  New Guinea lowlands, these comments must seem a mystification  rather than an explanation. However, if he perseveres, he may  learn in the next chapter how deeply the ideology of the kupör  and of ideal maleness has affected the ways and thoughts of the  Yéi-nan.  </page> </plain_text>
