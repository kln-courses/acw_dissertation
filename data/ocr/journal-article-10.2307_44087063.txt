<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITOR'S NOTE Recently, when I was speaking at the Université de Poitiers about interdisciplinary ecocriticism and the efforts of many ecocritics to make their work mean something beyond the Ivory Tower, a col- league in the audience mentioned Oscar Wilde's famous statement that "All art is quite useless" and asked how ecocritics might respond to such a thought. It seems to me, of course, that many (perhaps most) ecocritics would recoil from the idea of art for art's sake or, so to speak, criticism for criticism's sake. The practice of environmental writing and criticism, while not numb to the intrinsic value of beauty and interesting ideas, tends to reach outward toward practical impacts on social transformation and environmental protection. At the very least, our work typically- and perhaps by definition- engages with the world beyond textuality (or with the idea of the world out there). For instance, Adele H. Bealer's study of ecocriticism and perform- ance theory, which opens this issue, vigorously expands beyond the merely academic context, suggesting that "eco-performance" is not just "a way to read environmental texts, but also ... an inducement to perform them" and that such performing out loud might "encour- age readers of environmental writing to respond more proactively to its arguments." Bealer's call to "make audible the performative dis- courses" inherent to environmental texts helps to remind us that much of this beautiful writing about nature and culture seeks to achieve more than art for art's sake. A perennial tension in certain circles of the environmental humanities is the potential rift between imagination and empirical veracity. The "Nature Faker Controversy" of the early twentieth century is an especially notable event in this tradition, presaging in certain ways Dana Phillips's critique in The Truth of Ecology a century later. In her article on Mabel Osgood Wright, Kim Perez highlights the writer's "moderate stance" on the issue- her notion that "nature could be a 'field for fiction'." As a community builder who was active in the bird conservation move- ment and who wrote nature books for children, Wright was especially Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 19.1 (Winter 2012) doi: 1 0. 1 093/isle/iss057 © The Author(s) 2012.

Interest in and concern for the natural world- what Susan Rosowski called Willa Cather's "ecology of place"- is precisely what Rachel Collins reveals in her examination of burrows, tunnels, dugouts, and basements (subterranean dwellings well adapted to the prairie landscape) in Cather's 1918 novel My Antonia . Writing "So you come to inhabit your body , like music/' Emily Carr, in her study of con- temporary Mississippi poet besmilr brigham, emphasizes the writer's uniquely aural sensibility- her use of "echo-location" as a special process of getting beyond the text in order to "remap our human position in the natural world." Branching into film studies, Ryan Hediger uses the much- discussed Grizzly Years (and other filmic texts) as a springboard toward considering "real questions about human species identity and about human conduct toward animals and the wild." Identifying texts and reading strategies that enable us to gain traction on "real questions" and to grapple with what Hediger calls "Bears Themselves" (in other words, the world itself) is intrinsic to the ecoc- ritical process. In focusing her study on "adventure-nature films," Salma Monani is treating works that emphasize nature as "a wild space [that is] habitually outside the boundaries of the viewer's life." This project, too, grapples implicitly with the extra-textuality of the world in critiquing the ways that judgment, appropriation, and control of places and non-human species occur even in films that aspire to be documentary reports. Judith C. Mueller's analysis of William Blake's poetic rendering of "The Universal Groan" suggests that the granting of creature-hood to all things, while "radically anti- nomian" from certain Christian perspectives, may also be a control- ling, "textualizing" impulse- a placement of non-human phenomena within the human context of divine redemption. Do bears and caribou, rocks and rain, need to "be delivered"? Roland Racevskis wrestles with another kind of appropriation, or potential appropria- tion, the presentist impulse in much ecocriticism- the frequent focus on certain kinds of recent texts or the reading of earlier literature from a present-based perspective. The double-consciousness he pro- poses, by which twenty-first-century ecocritics might aspire to read early texts "that resonate with present-day reality but that maintain the specificity of their historical setting," seems fundamentally akin to the imaginative process of attaching human meaning to that which is not human, while also granting the nonhuman its own "meaning," which is likely to be beyond our grasp.</page><page sequence="3">Editor's Note 3 The experience of travel and the process of reporting on such experience may also be parallel to the encounter with non-human phenomena and with human cultural artifacts from other historical eras. All of these experiences involve grappling with otherness- making sense of the other and also allowing the other to have no par- ticular meaning. In following poet Elizabeth Bishop to Brazil and meditating on Bishop's words in tandem with the cultural and envi- ronmental reality of the Southern Hemisphere, Elizabeth Dodd ulti- mately focuses on her own desire for "connection/' her yearning to "set eyes on the actual things we've only read about." Does it matter what we call these "actual things"? What words we affix to the reality? For nature writer Bill Sherwonit, it does matter that we call the thing by the right name, especially if that thing is nature writing itself. Perhaps it's appropriate to conclude my meditation on the efforts of ecocriticism to grasp beyond the word to whatever may exist "out there" by acknowledging Sherwonit's avowedly unfashion- able and heartfelt protest. Let's not be in such a hurry to give up on "this beauteous and inspiring creature." In the first of his two "CircumTam" poems published in this issue, Ian Marshall, ecocritic and poet, writes: "Deviating from / modifying / improving upon / tradition." Although describing the ritual walks around Mt. Tamalpais, north of San Francisco, that celebrate the October 1965 stroll of Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Allen Ginsberg, Marshall's words also repetitively evoke the process by which critics and writers work endlessly through intractable and deeply familiar problems. Do environmental writers and critics do their work for its own sake? Yes, of course- to some extent. But we also hope there's more to it than that. Scott Slovic</page></plain_text>
