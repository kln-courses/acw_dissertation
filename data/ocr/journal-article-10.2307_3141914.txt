<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMUNION WITH GOD IN THE BIBLE PROFESSOR JOHN E. McFADYEN, M.A. Knox College, Toronto, Canada II. IN THE HISTORICAL BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT Difficulties of many kinds beset the attempt to exhibit the piety of ancient Israel on the basis of the historical books of the Old Testa- ment. The memoirs of Ezra and Nehemiah constitute practically the only autobiographical material we have; consequently the glimpses that we get into the hearts of the actors in the great drama of Hebrew history are for the most part few and indirect. Again, though biog- raphy forms a relatively large proportion of the historical literature, in the main it is the story of the nation that is told in its pages-the rise, the progress, the decline, the fall of the nation, and its recon- stitution as an ecclesiastical community; and naturally the men whose life-stories are told, are revealed rather in their public relation- ships and duties than in the intimacies of their private and personal religious life. We know a good deal, for example, of Josiah the reformer, but very little of Josiah the man. For the earlier period the case is further complicated by the promi- nence, in the historical narrative, of theophanies and similarly primi- tive expressions of religious feeling. The appearance of divine messengers to Abraham and Lot, and of an angel to Hagar by a foun- tain 'of water, the ladder at Bethel upon which angels ascended and descended, the "man" who wrestled with Jacob in the lonely night, the voice that spoke to Moses from the bush that burned and was not consumed-these and a score of similar phenomena belong rather to the world of religious imagination than of historic fact, and cannot prop- erly be used, as they have often been, to prove the unique intimacy of the patriarchs with God. And when we come down to times that may without challenge be described as historical we find that phrases which to us suggest communion with God can only be historically explained in a way which goes far to rob them of the spiritual sugges- tiveness which we are apt to associate with them. When we read, 249</page><page sequence="2">250 THE BIBLICAL WORLD for example, that David (I Sam. 23:2) or Saul (I Sam. I4:37), on critical occasions, sought to ascertain the will of God, it is not to prayer that they resort, but to the oracle; it is the priest with his ephod (I Sam. 14:18, LXX), Urim (I Sam. 28:6) and Thummim (I Sam. 14:41, LXX) that they consult. At the same time, it must not be forgotten that even those primi- tive and mechanical expressions of religious feeling are not incompat- ible with a real spiritual communion. The David who consults the priestly oracle is the David who, in moments of darkness and sorrow, finds his refuge in God. Undoubtedly the historical David was a man of prayer. When, in an early stage of his career, the people spoke of stoning him, "David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God" (I Sam. 30:6). The dark hours of Absalom's rebellion are brightened for him by his faith in God (II Sam. 16:12); into his hands he commits his case, and his stern discipline he meekly accepts (II Sam. i6:io; 15:25 f.). Again, it seems altogether probable that the spiritual implications of the early patriarchal stories have frequently been underestimated. Theophanies may not be historical, but it does not follow that they therefore mean nothing. Do not their bold and picturesque imagina- tions point to a real fellowship between man and his God, vaguely apprehended it may be, impossible of definition or explanation, but real and vital to the soul that, in the presence of certain natural phe- nomena or spiritual experiences, felt herself to stand before a Mystery, a Person-felt that that Person was speaking to her, and that she could commune with him ? The Bible is crowded with dialogue- the speech of God to man and man to God: and can we suppose that all this is just a pretty fiction ? It is impossible to believe this when we remember that the speech of God to man is not confined to the Mosaic or pre-Mosaic period, but occurs also in the books of Samuel and Kings, in Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and even in the New Testament. When we read that Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend (Exod. 33: 11; cf. Num. 12:8)- even although the anthropomorphism is softened, almost corrected, in the same chapter (33: 20 ff.; cf. Deut. 4: I2)-we must surely suppose that behind such a pictorial expression lies some great spiritual reality. We do not dispose of it by simply saying that it is naive. It is the</page><page sequence="3">COMMUNION WITH GOD IN THE BIBLE 251 ancient man's way of expressing his sense of a great and good man's communion with God. Indeed, this must have been the interpreta- tion put upon such narratives by the later priestly school which incor- porated those writings among their own-a school whose theology was as austere and unromantic as our own. (Contrast the severity of Gen., chap. I, with the poetry and anthropomorphisms of Gen., chaps. 2 and 3.) Old Testament piety may be summarily described as the fear of God, or more pictorially, as a walk with God. This latter phrase, how- ever-used of Enoch and Noah--seems to point to some high and unique dignity, and the piety of ordinary mortals is usually character- ized as a walk before God. Life is consciously lived in his presence. Devout men are those who "fear Jehovah, walk in his ways, love and serve him with all the heart and with all the soul" (Deut. io: I2; cf. I Kings 8:23), who "walk before him in truth and with a perfect heart, and do that which is good in his sight" (II Kings 20:3). The supreme religious act and attitude is trust (Gen. 15:6); this is the condition of security and prosperity (II Chron. 20: 20; cf. Isa. 7:9)- There is something very charming about the simple piety of the earlier stories: as when, for example, Abraham's servant "looked steadfastly on Rebekah, holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not" (Gen. 24: 2I)-there is a whole world of religious significance in that earnest gaze-or when Laban and Bethuel, smitten by the wonder of the whole episode, acknowledge: "The thing proceedeth from Jehovah; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good" (Gen. 24: 50). Life is pervaded by a sense of the presence of God: he is the "Shepherd" of all the good man's days (Gen. 48: I5)-he goes with him, and never fails or forsakes him (Deut. 31:8). In some lives this haunting sense of the presence and providence of God is peculiarly conspicuous. Take, for example, the story of Joseph. He recog- nizes that his God can inspire him with the power to interpret Pharaoh's dreams. He acknowledges repeatedly and emphatically the gracious providence that has shaped his mysterious career and brought him through persecution, calumny, and imprisonment to his seat beside the king with its immeasurable opportunity for doing good. "It was not you that sent me to Egypt," he says to his brothers, "but</page><page sequence="4">252 THE BIBLICAL WORLD God. You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good" (Gen. 45:5, 7, 8; 50:20). This sense of a providence, of a divine care which watches sleeplessly over the fortunes of the individual and of the nation, is one of the most precious things in the Old Testament, and it appears very early. In both the Jehovist (Gen. I2:I) and the Elohist (20:I3) narratives, Abraham's westward "wanderings" are interpreted as due to a divine impulse. It was not accident, but the voice of God that called him. This same Abraham assures his servant, about to set out on his quest for a wife for Isaac, that God will send his angel before him and prosper his way (Gen. 24:7, 40). For our purpose, the age and historicity of these narratives are quite immaterial; they are, in any case, a testimony to the writer's over- whelming faith in a providence that guides and guards the careers of those that are dear to it. It is the same thought that Deuteronomy so persistentlyreiterates,in its review of the national past (cf. Hos. I 1: I ff.): "He led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint, and fed thee in the wilderness with manna" (Deut. 8:15 f.). Such a God deserves to be trusted; but more, he deserves to be loved, and the duty of love to God is urged by Deuteronomy, with noble earnestness (6: 5; II : , etc.). Indeed, it is not so much a duty as the natural human response to the infinite and undeserved (9:5) love of God. This communion with God, which in one aspect is the fear of him, in another trust in him and the love of him, was sustained in ways both public and private-by public worship and private prayer. We gather from the question put to the Shunammite by her husband that it was the custom to visit the prophet, no doubt for religious instruction and inspiration, on the new moon and sabbath (II Kings 4: 23). If the prophet was, as he must occasionally have been, a man of the stamp of the great literary prophets, however inferior he might be to them in ability, souls must have been helped and stimulated by such a meeting. The more formal worship of the country sanctuaries, and later at the temple, though exposed to abuses of many and shame- ful kinds, must have helped to keep alive and bright in many a heart the sense of the goodness of God, manifest alike in the gifts of nature and in the wonders of their national past, with which the festivals were, at least in later times, connected. The religion encouraged by these festivals was, at any rate in the pre-exilic period, a glad religion:</page><page sequence="5">COMMUNION WITH GOD IN THE BIBLE 253 "There ye shall eat before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand to, ye and your households" (Deut. I2:7). But the Old Testament knows very well that that communion, which finds its public and formal expression in the worship of the sanctuary, may be gravely imperiled by prosperity, and altogether destroyed by luxury. Many and earnest are the warnings against forgetting Jehovah; and this temptation, it is seen, is one that is peculiarly apt to come upon men who "have eaten and are full, who have built goodly houses and dwelt therein, whose herds and flocks and silver and gold are multiplied" (Deut. 8: 12 f.). Then it is that the heart is apt to be lifted up, "and thou forget Jehovah thy God who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness " (8:14 f.; cf. 31:20). It was when Jeshurun waxed fat, grew thick, and sleek, that he forsook the God who made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation (32:15). Here is surely a profound interpretation of the power of prosperity to drive God out of human life, and to disturb that communion which it ought to confirm. For prosperity, although always a menace to the spiritual life, is not necessarily a curse: it only becomes so, if it tempts a man to think or say, "My own power and the might of my own hand hath gotten me this wealth" (8:17; cf. Amos 6:13). But he who remembers that "it is Jehovah thy God that giveth thee power to get wealth" (Deut. 8: 18) may continue in happy communion with his God. Just as prosperity may lead to forgetfulness of God, so distress may drive men to him, or deepen in them a sense of his reality (cf. Judges 3:9). Face to face with perplexity or danger, the appeal to God was natural, and, to an ancient Hebrew, inevitable. Jacob, for example, on his return to his own land, anticipating danger from the brother he had wronged, earnestly prays to be delivered from his hand (Gen. 32: 11). Moses, vexed by the murmurs of the people for water, turns and appeals to his God (Exod. 17:4), just as David strengthens himself in his God when the people propose to stone him (I Sam. 30:6). Of peculiar interest is the case of Hezekiah who, thrown into consternation by the menace of Assyria, went up to the temple, and offered a fervent prayer for deliverance, after having first spread "before Jehovah "-almost as if Jehovah were bodily present to look and listen-the letter which he had received from the messengers (II Kings 19: 14 ff.).</page><page sequence="6">254 THE BIBLICAL WORLD Prayer is the natural expression of a vital communion with God. Yet, considering the power which the idea of God exercised over the thoughts and lives of the nobler Hebrews, the prayers in the historical books of the Old Testament are surprisingly few. This may be explained partly, as we have suggested, by the fact that, as the history is a national one, these books exhibit the men, on the whole, in public rather than in private relationships. But there may be other and deeper reasons. It is at least conceivable that a living faith could express itself in the general attitude and direction of the life, without formally expressing itself in language. This may partly explain the absence of prayer from the story of such a life as Joseph's. Occasions enough there were for it. For long he trod a path of sorrow. He was destitute, afflicted, tormented. It was through a very stern discipline that he was ultimately brought to a wealthy place. He was, too, a man of noble piety, yet it is never said that he prayed. Of course no historian or biographer is bound to report everything and the argument from silence is notoriously precarious. Still the silence is remarkable and perhaps significant. If, however, there is no recorded prayer, there is in its place a mighty sense, as we have seen, of the overshadowing presence and the vigilant providence of God. "How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God ?" The piety of the man, if not, in the record, formally expressed in prayer, is inter- woven with his life. It is different in the story of Daniel, whose career was in many ways so similar to that of Joseph. Both narratives are full of dreams and interpretations, the heroes of both were cap- tives and they both rose in the land'of their captivity to positions of exceptional honor and influence. But in the story of Daniel prayer and allusions to prayer are frequent. The same great faith in God animates both narratives, but the one expresses itself in prayer, the other does not, and the reason is probably to be sought in the simple fact that the story of Daniel is about seven centuries later than.that of Joseph. During this interval prayer shared in the development which characterized the religion generally. The prayers of the post- exilic period are at once more numerous, more elaborate, and more formal than those of the pre-exilic.' iThe substance of this paragraph I have taken from my Prayers of the Bible, pp. 72 ff.</page><page sequence="7">COMMUNION WITH GOD IN THE BIBLE 255 But whether the records attest it or not, we must suppose that prayer was, from the beginning, an integral, if not a prominent part of Hebrew religion; and, even in the earliest records, prayers of all kinds find a place-petitions, thanksgivings, intercessions, confes- sions-though naturally confessions appear much more frequently in the later period, when stern experience and prophetic teaching had deepened the sense of sin. More or less throughout the Old Testa- ment, but especially in the earlier period, petitions gather round things material--food, drink, raiment, prosperity; "the dew of heaven, the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine;" deliverance from danger, sickness, and death. Prayers for children are naturally of frequent occurrence. Hannah entreats Jehovah, with prayer and promise, for a son (I Sam. : i i), and David beseeches him with prayer and fasting for the recovery of Bathsheba's sick child (II Sam. 12: 16). Occasionally there occur unlovely, though not unintelligible prayers for vengeance (of Samson, Judges 16:28; of Zechariah, II Chron. 24: 22). There is a quaint and simple beauty about the prayer of Abraham's servant for a prosperous journey: "O Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, goodspeed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham, " etc. (Gen. 24: 12). But it goes without saying that the prayers of men like the Hebrews were not exhausted in petitions like these. Solomon is represented as praying for a wise and understanding heart (I Kings 3:11 f.), and Moses as entreating a vision of the glory of God (Exod. 33:18), a glory which is at once explained as a revelation of Jehovah's grace. Communion with God naturally finds expression not only in petition for oneself, but in intercession for others. Samuel regards intercession as part of his duty, the neglect of which would be a sin (I Sam. 12: 23). It is perhaps, however, not altogether an accident that practically all the intercessory prayers of the Old Testament are offered by prophets. Moses, whom Deuteronomy (34: io) regards as Israel's greatest prophet, repeatedly appears in the r61e of intercessor -pleading for the removal of the plagues from Pharaoh, of the leprosy from Miriam (Num. 12: 13), of the serpents from the sinful people (2I:7); and he touches almost unparalleled heights of self-sacrificing devotion (cf. Rom. 9:3) in his prayer for the apostate people: "If thou wilt forgive their sin . . .; and if not, blot me, I pray thee,</page><page sequence="8">256 THE BIBLICAL WORLD out of thy book which thou hast written" (Exod. 32:32). As the prophet was peculiarly charged with the spiritual welfare of others, so he bore them on his heart before God. The goodness of God is frequently acknowledged in prayers of gratitude. Abraham's servant blesses God for the successful issue of his journey (Gen. 24: 27); thanksgivings are offered for victory in war (Exod., chap. 15), for the ripening of the fruits of the soil (Deut. 26: 5-IO), for recovery from sickness (Isa., chap. 38), for an unex- pected turn in the national fortunes (Ezra 7:27 f.). Nowhere perhaps is the humility of true gratitude expressed with a more exquisite or affecting simplicity than in the prayer of Jacob: "I am not worthy of the least of all the love and the faithfulness which thou hast showed to thy servant" (Gen. 32: 10). A few brief confessions of sin are found in pre-exilic literature, but the post-exilic confessions are very much longer and more elaborate (Ezra, chap. 9; Neh., chap. 9). "Behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness;" "I am ashamed," Erza confesses, "and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens" (Ezra 9:6). In prayers of petition, intercession, thanksgiving, confession, we get a glimpse of the inner side of Hebrew piety. We shall now look briefly at the manner in which it affected conduct. The consciousness of the divine presence is at once a cleansing and an inspiring influence. The cleansing power of the " fear of God" is happily illustrated by the Law of Holiness: "Ye shall be holy, for I am holy" (Lev., chaps. 17-26). The Hebrew who recognizes his true relation to his God will conform to the highest ethical demands in his relations to society; he will be scrupulously honest, he will be tenderly considerate of the deaf, the blind, the hired servant, he will scorn all intrigue and slander, he will love the stranger and honor the aged (Lev., chap. i9). The fear of God keeps Nehemiah (5: 14 f.) from taking an unjust advantage of his official position. It will keep any true man from hardening his heart and shutting his hand against the poor (Deut. 15:7). It will enable him to abandon, without murmuring, his most cherished hopes (Deut. 3: 26; 4: 22), to accept with meekness the discipline that is sent and the fortune that is allotted (II Sam. 15:25 f.), to obey</page><page sequence="9">COMMUNION WITH GOD IN THE BIBLE 257 the divine voice though his heart be breaking (Gen., chap. 22), to commit his case with quiet hope to God (II Sam. 16:12). But the sense of the divine presence, besides being a support in sorrow, and a power that searches and purifies the motives of conduct, is no less an inspiration to the courageous performance of duty. "Be strong and of a good courage. He it is that doth go before thee. He will be with thee: fear not, neither be dismayed" (Deut 31:8). Jehovah of Hosts, Master of the resources of the universe, can equip his servants for the work which he gives them to do. He is able and willing to endow a poor speaker with the power of ready and effective speech (Exod. 4:12), and to impart wisdom and understanding to one to whom is committed the high task of administration (I Kings, chap. 3). In short, the devout man feels that his life is evermore being "kept," and that a gracious face is shining upon him (Num. 6: 24-26). It is worthy of note that most of the great figures of Hebrew history, even in the realm of action, are men of prayer: for example, Moses, David, Elijah, Nehemiah. Of the first two we have already spoken. Elijah's titanic energy was sustained, at least in part, on prayer: he prays for the widow's son, he prays in the great scene on Carmel, and elsewhere. But of all the glimpses we get of the prayer life of Old Testament worthies, surely the most delightful is that afforded by the autobiographical memoirs of Nehemiah. He is a true man of action -look at him on his midnight ride round the walls of Jerusalem, or later organizing their restoration and defense-but he is no less a true man of prayer. His plans for Jerusalem are not his own, they are what my God put into my heart (2: 12), and it is his God who puts it into his heart to draw up a list of the burghers of Jerusalem (7:5)- In such language we breathe the very purest atmosphere of piety: they are the words of a keen and vigorous man whose whole life must have been a conscious walk with God. Up and down his book ate scattered prayers, dropped often quite incidentally into the course of his narrative, that his God would remember him for good. The Persian king, he tells us, granted him permission to return with official authority to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of my God upon me (2:8); and when he reaches his destination, and, after investigation, proposes to the leading men to restore the walls of Jerusalem, "I told them of</page><page sequence="10">258 THE BIBLICAL WORLD the hand of my God which was good upon me" (2: I8). This phrase indeed seems to be characteristic of the piety of the period (cf. Ezra 8: 22, 31). When some influential men jeered at Nehemiah's proposal, he has his answer ready: "The God of heaven, he will prosper us: therefore we his servants will arise and build" (2: 19 f.). And when those same scoffers, provoked by the rapid progress which the walls were making, began to plan cunning and violent measures to check that progress, "we made our prayer unto God and set a watch against them day and night" (4:9). This fine recognition of the necessity of work as well as prayer and of prayer as well as work, comes out in his appeal to the men whom he has organized for the defense of the city: "Be not afraid of them: remember the Lord, and fight" (4: 14). Here is a man of splendid practical gifts, of deep insight into the needs of a situation, and of large appreciation of the way in which those needs may best be practically met, and the necessary forces organized and kept efficient; but he recognizes no less clearly the indefeasible importance of prayer. He understands the inspiration that religion brings to the man who has difficult or dangerous work to do. He knows that men will fight better for remembering the Lord. He knows all this out of his own experience. All his activities are rooted in God: all his life is sustained by the inspiring and sheltering sense of God's presence: "Remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of thy loving-kindness " (13: 22). Nowhere does this receive so remarkable expression as in the story of his interview with the Persian king, from whom he wishes to beg a favor which is likely to have far-reaching effects upon the welfare of his dear distant home-land. The king asked him what was the nature of his request. "So I prayed to the God of heaven, and I said to the king, etc." (2:4 f.). This swift, silent, unrecorded prayer for help which he sends up to heaven before venturing upon an answer is a most eloquent testimony to the atmosphere and quality of his life: surely such a man lived in the Presence. One is involuntarily reminded of the later promise, fulfilled already by anticipation in such a man as Nehemiah: "Be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak; but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye" (Mark 13:These charming memoirs, with their straightfor)ard, soldier-like These charming memoirs, with their straightforward, soldier-like</page><page sequence="11">COMMUNION WITH GOD IN THE BIBLE 259 statements, and their simple, open-hearted confessions are of inesti- mable value as a first-hand utterance of the faith-alike on its practical and its devotional side--of one of Israel's great historical figures; and they deepen our regret that the Old Testament has no other quite similar document to offer. What would we not give for such a memoir from the hand of one of the martyrs who fell in the persecution of Manasseh, when the streets of Jerusalem ran with "innocent blood very much" (II Kings 2I:I6) ? The Psalms, it may be said, supply this lack of autobiographical memoirs in the historical books. In part they do; but the clue to the historical origin and setting of a psalm is so seldom recoverable that we have to content ourselves, in the main, with the revelation it affords of the Psalmist's religious experience and spiritual temper. This is much, but it is not every- thing. The concrete details of an important historical situation, the glowing faith which enabled a man to move among those details with sovereign ease and authority, and the story of all this in the man's own words-these things are peculiarly welcome and precious. We have not the intimate knowledge we might desire of the great leaders of the Hebrew people; but enough remains to show that, whatever form their work may have taken, they were men who stayed their souls on God.</page></plain_text>
