<plain_text><page sequence="1">EL DIABLO MUNDO IN THE LIGHT OF CARLYLE'S SARTOR RESARTUS English scholars trying to define the genre of Sartor Resartus have been as dissatisfied with conventional classifications as have Hispanists studying the Diablo mundo, in both instances because of the hybrid nature of the works. Northrup Frye brought real progress with his naming of the literary forms present in Carlyle's prose masterpiece. The Canadian critic identified a kind of autobiography and satire, to which some would add his category of the "romance." 1 Frye's "anatom- ical" analysis is particularly helpful because it enables us to look beneath surface differences and find a similar framework in Espronceda's lengthy poem. This re- semblance invites us to ask if Carlyle and Espronceda had like motives for making use of different vehicles to bring out ideas in the same composition and whether their means suited their ends. At first glance, to be sure, it would seem to require a conjurer's trick to have Sartor shed any light on the Diablo mundo. Under the strange Latin title Carlyle offered, in his words, "a kind of Didactic Novel" or "Satirical Extravaganza on Things in General." 2 He was trying to describe a work which consists mainly of portions of a supposed treatise on "Clothes, their Origin and Influence," as well as chapters from the autobiography of Diogenes Teufelsdrickh, the German scholar who authored it, and the complaints and comments of an Editor who tries to sort out the,material and make sense of the whole. As for the Diablo mundo, Espronceda mentions the title in the body of the poem (v. 2079), and implies that man, expelled from Eden, inhabits a world controlled by the Devil, and not God. 3 This is challenged by a diabolic figure in a grandiloquent introduction. How the six completed cantos answer the question, or if they bear out the suggestion of the title is not absolutely clear. The uncertainty arises in part because the poem was left unfinished at the poet's death and, in part, because it is difficult to tie together what we do have: the story of an old sage who is rejuvenated; the adventures of the new and innocent youth, Adin, which take him to jail, to the embrace of the ardent Salada, an attempted robbery at the home of the Condesa de Alcira, and an interview with a sorrowing mother; and the famous second canto, Espronceda's lament for the loss of his beloved Teresa. 1 George Levine proposes this addition (p. 23) in an admirable essay to which my discussion is deeply indebted, "Sartor Resartus and the Balance of Fiction," The Boun- daries of Fiction: Carlyle, Macaulay, Newman (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1968), pp. 19-78. There is a shorter version with the same title published as an article in VS, VIII (1964), pp. 131-60. Frye's categories are explained in his Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1957), pp. 303-14. 2 Quoted from a letter to his publisher, reprInted (pp. 303-04) by Charles Frederick Harrold in the valuable edition of Sartor Resartus (New York: Doubleday, Doran, 1937) from which all my references will be cited.

In this respect, studies on Sartor Resartus also help us to understand the composition of the Spanish poem. Moreover, for all that Sartor and the Diablo mundo contain very different material, one finds surprising coincidences in episodes and details. A comparison of these isolated resemblances will bring into focus my view that Carlyle and Es- pronceda set themselves similar technical problems of exposition and did so because of like concerns of a spiritual nature. Carlyle lays the foundation for his discussion by presenting Teufelsdrickh as "a new Adamite" (p. 58), one who speculatively would like to return man to his innocent state. The scholar reasons that beneath the clothes by which we carry out our public life exists the naked world. Society is founded upon conventions in raiment, for distinctions in dress or ornament mark hierarchies of power and wealth. This external covering, Teufelsdrickh argues, is a vesture cloaking a fundamental human sameness in the world of flesh. With mounting glee he allows his imagination to consider what would happen if clothes simply disappeared: Often in my atrabiliar moods, when I read of pompous ceremonials... how Duke this is presented by Archduke that, and Colonel A by General B, and innumerable Bishops, Admirals, and miscellaneous Functionaries, are advancing gallantly to the Anointed Presence itself, every mother's son of them, stand straddling there, not a shirt on them; and I know not whether to laugh or weep. ... Lives the man that can figure a naked Duke of Windlestraw addressing a naked House of Lords? ... The Woolsack, the Ministerial, the Opposition Benches - infandum! infandum! And yet why is the thing impossible? Was not every soul, or rather every body, of these Guardians of our Liberties, naked, or nearly so, last night; 'a forked Radish with a head fantastically carved'? And why might he not did our stern fate so order it, walk out to St. Stephen's, as well as into bed, in that no-fashion... ? (pp. 60-62). The picture calls to mind the slap-stick and hilarious scene in Espronceda's third canto. The child-like Adin, unaware of his nudity on the first day of re- juvenated existence, startles and shocks the landlord and his wife; fleeing from their outcries and the shouts of the other boarders, who fall all over themselves in confusion, he escapes into the streets of Madrid. Chaos ensues as wild rumor creates fears of uprising and anarchy. More sharply critical of society and government than Carlyle in Sartor, Espronceda carries exaggeration to the absurd in telling of the cannon unlimbered and the declaring of martial law (vv. 2581-2612). 4 There are major differences, of course, but both authors use nudity to expose how established institutions of rule and justice lose sight of human, naked reality, free of pretense and artifice. A detail in some nocturnal thoughts of Teufelsdrickh catches the attention. He is reflecting on the disorder of men's lives, and he expresses it in these images: 4 The scene, and Espronceda's passing reference to the naked youth as Hercules, are major points in Ambrico Castro's suggestion that Voltaire's L'Inginu may have influenced the poet; see "Acerca de 'El Diablo Mundo' de Espronceda," RFE, VII (1920), pp. 374-78.</page><page sequence="3">48 MONROE Z. HAFTER RI:HI, XXXVII (1972-1973) "Upwards of five-hundred-thousand two-legged animals without feathers lie around us, in horizontal positions; their heads all in nightcaps, and full of the foolishest dreams. Riot cries aloud, and staggers and swaggers in his rank dens of shame; and the Mother, with streaming hair, kneels over her pallid, dying infant, whose cracked lips only her tears now moisten. - All these heaped and huddled together, with nothing but a little carpentry and masonry between them..." (p. 23). That small vignette of riot in dens of shame, separated by thin walls from the mother, grieving over a dying infant, is very much like the mysterious section at the end of Es- pronceda's sixth canto. In it a certain Maria weeps over her dead daughter, while raucous laughter is heard from the bordello on the other side of a partition. Carlyle only sketches what Espronceda develops with added dialogue, but both picture in similar fashion the irrationality and disarray of life. An interesting parallelism is suggested by the accounts of how Diogenes and Adin first met the world and of the experiences which were to shape their growth. It leads both authors to digress and reflect on the powerful effect the name has on a person. Carlyle avails himself of the clothing theme to represent one's name as a garment which gives a configuration to an inner being, while both covering and denoting it (pp. 86-88); Espronceda lays stress on the fatality by which glory or failure of past generations are laid on the successor to the family designation (vv. 1982-2008). The emphasis is different, but each writer is indicating that one's nature can be shaped by such externals. Frustration in love offers additional points of comparison. The two authors blend the sharpness of individual suffering with a more universal outlook; as one result, both instances appear to have an existence apart from the rest of the work. An ardent, youthful Diogenes, the autobiography relates, fell deeply in love with the flower-like Blumine, but she did not return his devotion. While only a chapter in the narrative of the scholar's life, her brief appearance so captivated some early readers that they thought her a great romantic heroine. s Blumine is far too abstract a figure to merit this judgment, but the fact that the episode stands out with such relief puts one in mind of Espronceda, interrupting the poem to speak, auto- biographically as it were, of his grief at the loss of Teresa. She is hardly less elusive and symbolic in the second canto; and as to the possibility of detaching it, the poet invites the reader, impatient to continue with the orderly sequence of events, to pass over the lament, "pues no esti ligado de manera alguna con el poema" (p. 56). Both incidents of course serve in their respective works to convey motives for disillusion and hopelessness. When Teufelsdrickh gives way to depression, he raises questions about divinity and moral purpose that evoke the parallel confusions in Espronceda's mind. Carlyle's philosopher cries out despairingly: Is there no God, then; but at best an absentee God, sitting idle, ever since the first Sabbath, at the outside of his Universe, and seeing it go? ... Some comfort it would have been, could I, like a Faust, have fancied myself tempted and tormented of the Devil; for a Hell, as I imagine, without Life, though only diabolic Life, were more frightful: but in our age of Down- pulling and Disbelief, the very Devil has been pulled down, you cannot so 5 Levine, p. 22.</page><page sequence="4">"EL DIABLO MUNDO" IN THE LIGHT OF CARLYLE'S "SARTOR RESARTUS" 49 much as believe in a Devil. To me the Universe was all void of Life, of Purpose, of Volition, even of Hostility: it was one huge, dead, immeasurable Steam-engine, rolling on, in its dead indifference, to grind me limb from limb. O, the vast, gloomy, solitary Golgotha, and Mill of Death! Why was the Living banished thither companionless, conscious? Why, if there is no Devil; nay, unless the Devil is your God? (pp. 159, 164). Espronceda expresses spiritual doubt in more complicated fashion, principally because he speaks through the mouth of Lucifer. This devil is not the cocksure, arrogant rebel against Jehovah or the sly deceiver of men. He too is uncertain. First he wonders if God is an active divinity, cruel and vengeful. Then in perplexity he turns to the alternative which he develops at greater length, an indifferent god, remote and unfeeling: Embebido en su inmenso poderio, (Es Dios el Dios que goza en su hermosura, Que arroj6 el universo en el vacio, Leyes le dio y abandon6 su hechura? iFue vanidad del hombre y desvario Sofiarse imagen de su imagen pura? iEs Dios el Dios que en su eternal sosiego Ni vio su llanto ni escuch6 su ruego? (vv. 352-59) Far from cursing this supreme being, the plaintive, almost human, questioner clings to the ideas of divine beauty, a pure image, and eternal rest. Groping for answers in his anxiety, Lucifer even ponders - with evident anthropomorphism - if God is impotent, enslaved to some still more powerful force: "CA esclavitud eterna condenada, / A fiera lucha, a guerra interminable, / Tal vez estis, divinidad su- blime, / Que otra divinidad de inercia oprime?" (vv. 372-75).6 Confusion and helplessness are intensified in a chorus of mysterious voices, one of which declares: "Nosotros, genios del mal, / Aunque en nosotros no cree, 7 / Somos su Dios, con- denado / Nuestro influjo a obedecer" (vv. 534-37). The loss of direction, the inability to perceive the controlling factors in life are as central an issue in the Spanish poem as in Carlyle's Sartor. In addition to the coincidences seen so far - dissatisfaction with viewing man only in his external appearance, imaging the sense of a world in disorder, disil- lusion in love, grave spiritual bewilderment - the two works share a further similarity. Both frequently introduce a mocking or defensive commentary on the subjects discussed by one who might be said to stand apart from them. Carlyle's outsider is the Editor who contends with the six bags of Teufelsdri6ckh's papers, sent to him by the German philosopher's friend and colleague, Herr Heuschrecke. The jumbled and sometimes incomprehensible material provokes the Editor to exasperated outcries: "Daily and nightly does [he] sit (with green spectacles) 6 In Matt. 4:7-10 the Devil tempts Jesus and boasts of having all earthly kingdoms at his disposal. Jesus' triumph over Satan is in itself no longer a comfort and guide for Espronceda. 7 The Moreno Villa edition has "or&amp;" in error; that reading makes little sense in the context.</page><page sequence="5">50 MONROE Z. HAFTER RI-IM, xxxvII (1972-1973) deciphering these unimaginable Documents from their perplexed cursiv-schrift .... Over such a universal medley of high and low, of hot, cold, moist and dry, is he here struggling (by union of like with like, which is Method) to build a firm Bridge for British travellers" (p. 79). The Editor draws close to his British reader and appears to take him into his workshop as he calls attention to the illogical exposition: How could a man occasionally of keen insight, not without a keen sense of propriety, who had real Thoughts to communicate, resolve to emit them in a shape bordering so closely on the absurd? Which question he were wiser than the present Editor who should satisfactorily answer. Our conjecture has sometimes been, that perhaps Necessity as well as Choice was concerned in it. Seems it not conceivable that, in a Life like our Professor's, where so much bountifully given by Nature had in Practice failed and misgone, Literature also would never rightly prosper: that striving with his characteristic vehem- ence to paint this and the other Picture, and ever without success, he at last desperately dashes his sponge, full of colours, against the canvas, to try whether it will paint Foam? (pp. 293-94). This quotation confirms that Carlyle, through the Editor, is fully aware of the slap-dash appearance of Teufelsdr6ckh's theories; far from wanting to improve on this seeming defect, he proposes that the disorder remain because it is neces- sary to the exposition. Espronceda's acknowledgment of incomprehensibility is not identical with Carlyle's but is no less purposeful. For example, he turns from his digression on names to confess to the reader: "Cuanto diciendo voy se me figura / Metafisica pura, / Puro disparatar, y ya no entiendo, / Lector, te juro, lo que voy diciendo" (vv. 2009-12).8 The poet does not revise his text to make it more intelligible; instead, he later excuses these unclear digressions as only a failing "de escritor concienzudo / Que perdona el efecto, / Con la intenci6n de mejorar conciencias / Con sus disertaciones y advertencias?" (vv. 2096-99). Espronceda's avowal of intention to improve consciences is very important, because, as I shall show, it indicates that a single objective motivates all the turnings and twistings in the development of his material. Therefore, if he does not write, exactly like Carlyle, a "universal medley of high and low, of hot, cold, moist and dry," he affirms his willingness to allow an extensive mixing of styles: En varias formas, con diverso estilo, En diferentes gbneros, calzando Ora el coturno trigico de Esquilo, Ora la trompa 6pica sonando, Ora cantando plicido y tranquilo, Ora en trivial lenguaje, ora burlando, Conforme est6 mi humor, porque a 61 me ajusto. 8 Philip H. Churchman notes similar comments in Don 7uan in his authoritative study, "Byron and Espronceda," RHi, XX (1909), p. 184. Churchman takes account also of Byron's asking indulgence for his digressions on pp. 100 and 174.</page><page sequence="6">"EL DIABLO MUNDO" IN THE LIGHT OF CARLYLE'S "SARTOR RESARTUS" 51 An orderly, classical exposition does not suit his ends, and Espronceda swears with mock seriousness that another time he will write for the censorious reader, "Un libro en que a Arist6teles me ajusto / Como se ajusta la pupila al ojo" (vv. 742- 43). 9 For now, logic must give way to the heart: "Sin regla ni compis canta mi lira: / iS6lo mi ardiente coraz6n me inspira!" (vv. 762-63). Carlyle makes a similar point but in favor of the intuition, or practical reason as he employs the Kantian terms, 10 because the lessons he wants to advance will not enter his reader's spirit through pure reason. From the foregoing it follows that both authors consciously chose a fragmented, illogical method of composition by which to express the general spiritual confusion and despair which occasioned the coincidences I have described. Recent studies on Sartor Resartus " have thoroughly analyzed the complex strategy Carlyle employed in setting forth a coherent manifestation of conviction and prophecy. These findings help to illuminate the scheme - admittedly less calculated and controlled - with which Espronceda operated in writing the Diablo mundo. Briefly stated, the Scottish author used the philosophy of clothing to lead the reader into deeper considerations: as vestments cover the naked world of flesh, the body in turn is a garment for the spiritual world within. All material things in their variety are the substantial representation of a single spiritual reality, and men everywhere are affected by what happens to any one. 12 " eNay, if you consider it,' " he has Teufelsdrickh ask, " 'what is Man himself, and his whole terrestrial Life, but an Emblem; a Clothing or visible Garment for that divine Me of his, cast hither, like a light-particle, down from Heaven?'" (p. 73). And he carries the idea still further: " 'Language is called the Garment of Thought: however, it should rather be, Language is the Flesh-Garment, the Body, of Thought.' " Two parallelisms are implied by the ideas above, and Carlyle draws on them: 1) as the external and material in the universe - clothing, flesh - are symbols of a spiritual reality, his phrases and word pictures are symbols of ideas; 2) as the variety of surface appearances are reflections of one perfect spirit or idea, his episodes, anecdotes, deciphering of texts, meditations are so many efforts to body forth a single spiritual reality. The irrational form of Sartor Resartus corresponds to the material world as we see it. Neither our senses nor our reason can perceive 9 Possibly also modeled on a passage from Don Juan, according to Churchman, p. 170. 10 "Our Professor's method is not, in any case that of common school Logic, where the truths all stand in a row, each holding by the skirts of the other; but at best that of practical Reason, proceeding by large Intuition over whole systematic groups and king- doms..." (p. 52). 11 In addition to the essay by George Levine, I have found particularly helpful Leonard W. Deen, "Irrational Form in Sartor Resartus," TSLL, V (1963), pp. 438-51; and G. B. Tennyson, Sartor called Resartus. The Genesis, Structure and Style of Thomas Carlyle's First Major Work (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1965). 12 " 'eSuch venous-arterial circulation, of Letters, verbal Messages, paper and other Packages, going out from him and coming in, are a blood-circulation, visible to the eye: but the finer nervous circulation, by which all things, the minutest that he does, minutely influence all men, and the very look of his face blesses or curses whomso it lights on, and so generates ever new blessing or new cursing: all this you cannot see, but only imagine. I say, there is not a red Indian, hunting by Lake Winnipec, can quarrel with his Squaw, but the whole world must smart for it: will not the price of beaver rise? It is a math- ematical fact that the casting of the pebble from my hand alters the centre of gravity of the Universe' " (pp. 245-46).</page><page sequence="7">52 MONROE Z. HAFTER R0M, XXXVII (1972-1973) the existence of God. We become aware of the divine presence only by clear signs of the heart. Carlyle knows he cannot affirm, or persuade readers of, this intuitive truth by doctrinaire statements or logical argumentation, and correspondingly Sartor has no omnisc;ent author to speak authoritatively in a uniform voice. Instead, he alternates humor with gravity, pretends to be hopelessly confused, cultivates a surface ambiguity, and thereby progressively stimulates the search for similar convictions. To a large extent I believe this artistic plan can be admitted as the shaping factor in the Diablo mundo. To establish first that Espronceda also desired to have a heterogeneous style capture the unevenness of worldly life we may turn to the prologue written by Antonio Ros de Olano, the friend to whom he dedicated the poem. Espronceda almost certainly discussed his project with Ros de Olano, and therefore the latter's words are particularly noteworthy: "La variedad de tonos que a su arbitrio emplea el poeta, tonos ya humildes, ya elevados, iridos o festivos, placenteros, sombrios, desesperados e inocentes, son como la faz del mundo, sobre la cual esti condenado a discurrir su hdroe. Esa sinuosidad del Diablo Mundo es la superficie de la tierra: aqui un valle, mis adelante un monte, flores y espinas, aridez y verdura, chozas y palacios, pozas inmundas, arroyos serenos y rios despefiados." 14 Motivating this variety of expression is a desire for comprehensiveness and sympathy, or "la armonia del sentimiento," as Ros phrases it. 15 Secondly, Espronceda also conceives of his composition as an emblem or symbol of life in this world: Nada menos te ofrezco que un poema Con lances raros y revuelto asunto, De nuestro mundo y sociedad emblema, Que hemos de recorrer punto por punto: Si logro yo desenvolver mi tema, Fiel traslado ha de ser, cierto trasunto De la vida del hombre y la quimera Tras de que va la Humanidad entera. (vv. 1356-63) Espronceda may be on a track similar to Carlyle's because the verses give evidence that behind the many events and jumbled matter of the poem lies "mi tema," a 13 Levine, p. 59. 14 Italics his; quoted from the ed. of the Diablo mundo printed by Gaspar y Roig (Madrid, 1852), p. iv. Alessandro Martinengo takes note of this and similar observations by Ros de Olano in an effort to identify which text of Goethe's Faust Espronceda con- ceivably read when inspired to use the rejuvenation theme. He proposes the edition by Albert Stapfer, (Euvres dramatiques de 7. W. Goethe (Paris: A. Sautelet, 1825), vol. 4. Martinengo compares, for example, from Stapfer's "Avertissement": "Dans la partie dra- matique, le style change selon les personnages et selon les situations; tant6t dlev6 jusqu'au sublime, tant6t familier jusqu'au trivial il passe tour a tour, et souvent brusquement, du sdrieux au plaisant, du path~tique au bouffon" ("Espronceda ante la leyenda fiustica," RLit, XXIX [1966], p. 54). See too the first chapter in Martinengo's Polimorfismo nel "Diablo mundo" d'Espronceda (Torino: Bottega d'Erasmo, 1962). 15 The phrase, and its importance for interpreting the poem, is studied in the fun- damental analysis by Joaquin Casalduero, Formna y visidn de "El diablo mundo" de Espronceda (Madrid: fnsula, 1951), pp. 24-25.</page><page sequence="8">"EL DIABLO MUNDO" IN THE LIGHT OF CARLYLE'S "SARTOR RESARTUS" 53 unifying theme. What that might be is suggested by the two last verses, the illusion which all humanity pursues. It is posed problematically in the introductory section as an uncertainty whether a god or a devil is the force motivating our restlessly inquiring spirit (vv. 368-71 and 392-99). Lucifer seems to answer his own questions and to taunt humankind that it is he who stirs the thoughts of a material being to heavenly regions (vv. 436-41). However, man is condemned to frustration in his desire for sublime achievements or perfect love and therefore must know with certainty whether that impulse is somehow indicative of a divine nobility or of a diabolic torment. This theme is manifested by various techniques in the several parts of the poem. The "Introducci6n" has narrative sections related by Espronceda; others are recounted by a character called "El poeta." In his lengthy vision, the latter sees a swarm of fantastic figures, culminating with the gigantic form of Lucifer and hears their strange voices turn one way and then another the perplexing nature of man's destiny. The presentation through other speakers changes in the second canto. Espronceda expresses personally his love for Teresa and then disdain because she had lost some cherished purity, a conflict of feelings intensified by her early death. He universalizes the tumult of his heart and the deception of his spirit while attempting to show that love for woman can satisfy a man's longing only briefly at best. 16 Nearly as large a part of this section is devoted to "una mujer" as is focused on the individual he once caressed. As the stanza beginning, "Y afin miro aquellos ojos..." (v. 1676) illustrates, the bereaved poet in his imagination looks progressively at her eyes, her skin, and then more abstractly, at those hours, in a way which dissolves the personal and palpable experience into melancholy contemplation. In doing so Espronceda remains close to views developed in his introduction and to the technique of interchanging the personal and general. For example, in the earlier part, a grandiose Lucifer bewails the human condition, but his lament sounds almost trivial when compared to the remembered voice of a woman once loved: "iAy!" exclam6, con lamentable queja, Y entonces reson6 triste gemido, Como el recuerdo que en el alma deja La voz de la mujer que hemos querido. "iAy! iCuin terrible condici6n me aqueja Para llorar y maldecir nacido, Victima yo de mi fatal deseo, Que cumplirse jamis mis ansias veo!" (vv. 312-19) Later, the "Canto a Teresa," far from being the disconnected lyric release the poet called it, makes the same outcry against the inescapable frustration of man's desire. Espronceda represents the temptation to believe in woman, who may be no more than a fallen angel, as an infernal torment. Some phrases are repeated (vv. 317 and 1710), even though the context is now an ended love affair: 16 See Bruce W. Wardropper, "Espronceda's 'Canto a Teresa' and the Spanish Elegiac Tradition," BHS, XL (1963), pp. 89-100.</page><page sequence="9">54 MONROE Z. HAFTER RIlI, XXXVII (1972-1973) Mas, lay!, que es la mujer Tngel caido O mujer nada mis y lodo inmundo, Hermoso ser para ilorar nacido, O vivir como aut6mata en el mundo; Si, que el demonio en el Eden perdido Abrasara con fuego del profundo La primera mujer, y ay! aquel fuego, La herencia ha sido de sus hijos luego. (vv. 1708-15) Another vehicle for advancing the same thematic material is fictional, the narrative of Adin, jailed for his public disturbance while nude, and his meeting with Tio Lucas. The latter is portrayed as a criminal on a grand scale, but the achievements which he advises the youth to pursue are materialistic: "pan" (v. 3704), "rentas y capellania" (v. 3722). His range of ambition and curiosity is limited to money, for as we see in a brief passage, he seeks no knowledge of the divine. If God is omnipotent, he explains aphoristically to Adin, then "dinero" is his lieutenant (vv. 3725-26). This view will be tested in the next two cantos, five and six; the technique of presentation, however, is radically changed in the fifth. Espronceda shifts to the cuadro, a dramatic form in which there is no narrator, and the characters speak as if spontaneously. Here we encounter Lucas' daughter, Salada. An earthy, sensual woman, she poses a contrast to Teresa. The latter first held a spiritual quality for her lover. Salada offers Adin a passionate devotion to which she commits her whole being, but her love is frustrated because Adin cannot find the same satisfaction as she in the affair. His curiosity has been aroused by Tio Lucas and the other gangsters to seek wealth, position, and fame; as he explains to Salada, he feels constrained by their relationship. Espronceda interrupts their dialogue to make the point himself (wv. 4288-4335), namely that while love fills the life of a woman, it is a more fleeting pleasure for a man. So far we have seen how the problematic nature of human desire exposed in the introduction has been treated in a first-person lament, a fictional narrative, scenes from a drama, and an expository aside. We now approach the two strange, suspended parts of the last completed canto. In the earlier, Adin's curiosity has led him to join some thieves who break into the apartment of the Condesa de Alcira. Espronceda does not fully round off the episode, in part because the thugs must escape before discovery. There is a suggestion, however, that Adin, who marvels like a child (v. 5228) at the gleaming jewels, the gorgeous clock and rich ornaments, will with equal capriciousness soon weary of them. Support for this interpretation comes from the narrator's penetration of the Condesa's uneasy sleep: she sorrows, he explains, for the abundance of possessions cannot remedy her broken heart (vv. 5076-5103). Once the alarm is given, and the intruders flee, Adin finds himself before the mother, Maria, whose wailing over her dead daughter mixes with the shrill laughter resounding from the brothel next door. "7 17 Narciso Alonso Cortis believes that Espronceda may have had in mind in writing this section the long incomplete poem by Miguel de los Santos Alvarez, called 'Maria,' and dedicated "A su querido Pepe Espronceda" (Madrid: Gabinete Literario, 1840). A stanza from Maria serves as an epigraph for the "Canto a Teresa," and a line is in- corporated as v. 2157. The title heroine is a girl who grows up, pure and isolated, in a house of prostitution run by her aunt. When death made clear that Espronceda would</page><page sequence="10">"EL DIABLO MUNDO" IN THE LIGHT OF CARLYLE'S "SARTOR RESARTUS" 55 The heart of this scene is the effort of the youth and the mother to understand death in early years, the ultimate frustration of parents' and child's desires. Maria asks, much as Lucifer did in the introduction: "El Dios ese, que habita, / Om- nipotente, en la regi6n del cielo, / 4Quidn es que inunda a veces de alegria, / Y otras veces, cruel, con mano impia, / Llena de angustia y de dolor el suelo?" (vv. 5673-77). Espronceda leaves his answer to her question somewhat ambiguous. He personifies one attitude through Adin's innocent faith in God's benevolence and the other, through Maria's damning of His cruelty. Insecurity about the order of the universe and man's lot is less susceptible to logical exposition than is firm conviction. Espronceda allows skepticism, doubt, and yet an eagerness to believe in providence to radiate through all the parts of his poem. The grandiloquent visionary scenes of the introduction abound with adverbs of uncertainty ("tal vez," "acaso," "quizi") and establish the questioning attitude of the whole. The most personal canto devoted to Teresa displays a sur- prising frequency of un-lyrical perhaps. 18 Old and young, lover and loved, the high- and low-born suffer from incomprehensible dissatisfaction. Espronceda deep- ens the impression of universality both by writing subjectively and by objectify- ing the suffering of the heart in fictional characters; and even so, the personal tone and abstract reflection are never far from one another. Nor does he allow cynicism to emerge as the dominant note; he intervenes to poke sarcasm at his own verses and in doing so forces the reader to doubt the questioner as well. Carlyle's strategy in composing Sartor Resartus helps us to appreciate how fragmentation of material and diversity in tone can serve the communication of Espronceda's spiritual themes. The comparison has the further effect of diminish- ing the sense of the latter's unique indebtedness to Voltaire, Goethe, and Byron, for these three writers were varyingly influential in Carlyle, and contributed to the shaping of literature in the period. However, one major contrast between Sartor and the Diablo mundo should be stressed. Carlyle, in the famous chapters, "The Everlasting Nay" and "The Everlasting Yea," offers positive advice to the reader. Like Teufelsdrickh, Carlyle leaves behind the destructive criticism of Voltaire.
