Following Guimarães Rosa, the essay offers a  comparative perspective on how to rethink “animal thinking.” Queneau’s Poissons and Guimarães Rosa’s Jaguar: Two Literary Contributions on the Animal and Human Conditions ÉLIDE VALARINI OLIVER Ajoutez à cela l’orgueil insupportable des humains, qui leur persuade que la nature n’a été faite que pour eux —Cyrano de Bergerac, Voyage dans la lune The first “meditation” on thecondition of fish in RaymondQueneau’s Saint Glinglin intro- duces, either ironically or not, a series of attitudes towards animals that have become paradigmatic in Western cultures: that the “human” and the “animal” belong to dif- ferent realms; that the “animal” is mechanical, and hence devoid of sentience; and that the animal is therefore impenetrable. The assumptions behind such attitudes are steeped in a theological culture derived from Judeo-Christian axioms and from vari- ous other philosophical traditions that sometimes share these same theological assumptions. In the case of Queneau’s fish, the first person narrator, always unreliable due to the author’s ironic subversions, thinks or associates within the residual theo- logical estrangement (which I will call “biblical” for shorthand) and the equally sim- plified Cartesian assumption of the animal-machine. Mosaic 41/4 0027-1276-07/129014$02.00©Mosaic </page> <page sequence="2"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 130  130 Mosaic 41/4 (December 2008) One example in which both stances occur finds the narrator at the city aquarium, observing the fish:  Comme ces bêtes ne dorment pas, telle est du moins mon opinion, je suppose donc qu’a cette heure tardive à laquelle j’écris maintenant, mon zèbre court toujours de large en long, toujours aussi radicalement inoccupé. Pour manger même, il n’a pas besoin de s’arrêter, non plus que pour se reproduire. Cette dernière activité se passe, dit-on, d’une façon si impersonnelle qu’il n’est évidemment pas besoin pour s’y livrer de cesser de battre de la nageoire. Alors à quoi pense-t-il mon poisson? Bien entendu, je ne lui demande pas de réfléchir, de se livrer à une activité rationnelle, de construire des syllogismes et de réfuter des sophismes, non, bien entendu, mais mon poisson ne regarde-t-il donc jamais ce qui se passe de l’autre côté de la vitre épaisse qui le sépare du monde humain? De l’avis de tous, la réponse est: non, mon poisson ne pense pas, son activité intellectuelle est égale à zéro. C’est cela que je trouve atroce. Il n’est pas possible d’avoir de rapports humains avec un poisson  (Queneau 11–12). In its radical dissimilarity, the narrator cannot establish any link of continuity between himself and the mechanical fish behind the thick glass separating it from the human world. Essential biological activities like sleeping, eating, and reproducing are deemed to be mechanical and automatic. It is very telling that the narrator uses the rhetorical device of occultatio (apophasis) to emphasise the lack of a “thinking mind” by enumerating what he “doesn’t” demand of “his” fish. That it be capable of reflec- tion, rationality, syllogism; that it be capable of refuting sophisms; and that it be capa- ble of being aware of the human world happening on the other side of the glass. From the onset, the narrator is clearly confused (as the author is clearly aware) in his over- lap of presuppositions, and a web of provocations is, then, carefully woven. Mimesis notwithstanding—a remarkable stream of consciousness technique—the provoca- tions derive from a deliberate conflation between different concepts: thought, lan- guage, mind, and consciousness, among others. A dominant idea in last century’s Saussurean linguistics, which has entered other fields of knowledge, is that language and thought are the same entity. Wittgenstein opposes the idea that language is intimately related to thought. According to him, when we say “I have a headache” we are not reporting it but expressing it, like a groan. “The paradox disappears only if we make a radical break with the idea that language always functions in one way, always serves the same purpose; to convey thoughts—which may be about houses, pains, good and evil, or anything else you please” (304, emph. mine). </page> <page sequence="3"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 131 Élide Valarini Oliver 131 T hought may assume the guise of oral language. It can be influenced, sometimeseven moulded by it (Whorf), since language plays an important part in shaping perceptions and views, but that does not mean that thought is held prisoner by oral language. Thought is usually processed at a higher speed than our words can convey it. The question of “what is thinking?” remains open. In his later writings, Heidegger pro- poses an inversion of the paradigm. He is interested in what thinking can learn from that which philosophy excludes as foreign to its nature; above all, this means: what can thinking learn from poetry (Dichten)? Heidegger works through this question in his later writings collected in On the Way to Language. Systematic philosophy seeks to bring language, and therefore all that language brings into the open, under the rule of logic and the construction of concepts. With poetry, it is largely otherwise. In an essay entitled “The Word,” Heidegger says that “the poet renounces having words under his control” (147). Poetry is the letting go of language. Poetry is release (Gelassenheit). For Heidegger, poetry is no longer a discursive practice governed by a poetics or a kind of speaking that can be compared with other uses of language, but rather a listening that picks up on the speaking that language speaks (Die Sprache spricht).  Before exploring more fully the possibility that literature and poetry are better equipped to deal with these difficult zones concerning thought as the imagining and the projection through this imagination of a true reflection on the question of the “animal,” we should consider an observation about fish by Konrad Lorenz. Jewel fish couples congregate their young under the mother fish and descend to their nesting hole, supposedly to sleep or rest. The father usually searches the whole tank for strag- glers. As he finds them, he inhales them into his mouth, swims to the nest and blows them out into the hollow. The baby sinks to the bottom and remains there “sleeping” under the mother for hours. Lorenz writes: I once saw a jewel fish, during such an evening transport of strayed children, perform a deed which absolutely astonished me. I came, late one evening, into the laboratory. It was already dusk and I wished hurriedly to feed a few fishes which had not received anything to eat that day; amongst them was a pair of jewel fishes who were tending their young. As I approached the container, I saw that most of the young were already in the nesting hol- low over which the mother was hovering. She refused to come for the food when I threw pieces of earthworm into the tank. The father, however, who, in great excitement, was dash- ing backwards and forwards searching for truants, allowed himself to be diverted from his duty by a nice hind-end of earthworm (for some unknown reason this end is preferred by all worm-eaters to the front one). He swam up and seized the worm, but, owing to its size, was unable to swallow it. As he was in the act of chewing this mouthful, he saw a baby fish swimming by itself across the tank; he started as though stung, raced after the baby and </page> <page sequence="4"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 132  132 Mosaic 41/4 (December 2008) took it into his already filled mouth. It was a thrilling moment. The fish had in its mouth two different things of which one must go into the stomach and the other into the nest. What would he do? I must confess that, at that moment, I would not have given two pence for the life of that tiny jewel fish. But wonderful what really happened! The fish stood stock still with full cheeks but did not chew. If ever I have seen a fish think, it was in that moment! What a truly remarkable thing that a fish can find itself in a genuine conflicting situation and, in this case, behave exactly as a human being would; that is to say, it stops, blocked in all directions, and can go neither forward nor backward. For many seconds the father jewel fish stood riveted and one could almost see how his feelings were working. Then he solved the conflict in a way for which one was bound to feel admiration: he spat out the whole contents of his mouth: the worm fell to the bottom, and the little jewel fish, becoming heavy in the way described above, did the same. Then the father turned resolutely to the worm and ate it up, without haste, but all the time with one eye on the child which “obediently” lay on the bottom beneath him. When he had finished, he inhaled the baby and carried it home to its mother (Lorenz 37–38, emph. mine). This fantastic observation contrasts with Queneau’s narrator in many ways. First, it is the observation of a zoologist and an ethologist who could overcome the barrier of the thick glass not by “anthropomorphism” (despite the descriptive language, one wonders how could this episode be narrated using different words) but by accuracy, consistency, and engagement. Queneau’s narrator, however, is far from being an active observer in the manner Lorenz is. Besides the fact that he is passive, there is yet another crucial difference between both: the narrator of Queneau’s episode is, prima- rily, engaged with himself. His reflections are those of a limited, dumb young man, whose sense of dépaysement (he has won a scholarship to study languages in another country in order to return and get a job as a tourist guide) finds relief in his escapades to the city aquarium. For this narrator, to “think” is to perform a very limited capacity reserved for and recognized by a simplified philosophical axiom; its opposition to other forms of “thinking” is striking, as we can see when we compare his associations with the obser- vations of the ethologist (especially if this scientist happens to be Lorenz). This is not always the case, and in most instances, ethologists actually adopt Queneau’s narrator approach. Commenting on some principles of ethology, James Fisher and Roger Peterson write that “another principle propounded by the Welsh psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan in 1894, runs: ‘In no case is an animal’s activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psy- chological processes if it can fairly be interpreted in terms of processes which are lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.’” As the authors rightfully </page> <page sequence="5"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 133 Élide Valarini Oliver 133 comment, this argument “is an extension of a principle of the Scottish philosopher Duns Scotus promulgated around 1300 and of the English philosopher William of Occam (around 1340), which can be rendered ‘the essentials are not to be multiplied beyond necessity,’ or if you like, ‘it is idle or false to explain with more what can be explained with fewer’” (134). The fallacy of Morgan’s argumentation—which is the paradigm that rules many “scientific” approaches, including widespread behav- iourism—comes not from its epistemological formulation but from its application. Occam’s formula cannot be applied to models where one cannot control all variables, because it will lead to determinism. Furthermore, the very usage of Occam’s paradigm in this situation indicates not only determinism but overdeterminism. It assumes from the start that there is a fundamental separation between “the human” and “the animal”—what is called herein the biblical paradigm. The argument is, then, obvi- ously vitiated. If this is a “measure” to avoid “anthropomorphism,” then the very con- cept of “anthropomorphism” needs a redefinition. The way it is proposed, not only here, but by behaviourism in general, is a petitio principii. This is not to suggest that scientific principles cannot be applied to the study of animals, nor that the knowledge thence derived is fundamentally tainted. What the criticism implies is that there is an essential distortion to the paradigm itself at its inception, and this will necessarily play a part when animal psychologists apply them- selves to describe and/or to explain the “animal” world or “behaviour.” Moreover, the very notion of “animal” and “behaviour,” far from being an objective description of a phenomenon, is subject to controversy and to change according to times, costumes, postures, and mentality.1 Returning to the crucial issue of fish thinking, we find in Lorenz a case of unmis- takable “choice.” The fish must choose between two decisions that are equally funda- mental for the survival of the species: food and reproduction. It is even more striking that Lorenz’s fish is capable of choosing both. And he does such, based on an even more remarkable feat: this fish is capable of a kind of “reasoning” that involves tim- ing and estimation of benefits. He knows somehow that he can expel the wanted and necessary food in order to release his young and return to his food a second later. However we characterize his behaviour, we must admit that there is “thinking” there, and a kind of thinking not at all related to language. It is, rather, a mode of thinking that, for lack of a better word, could be called “organic.” Somehow, this organic, bio- logical being is capable of decisions based on its priorities as species, and these involve intelligence, perception, timing, planning, choice, and action.2 Such discoveries, many of them well known to observant pet owners, collide with a wall of impervious skep- ticism on the part of some scientists because their conception of what is “science” is </page> <page sequence="6"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 134  134 Mosaic 41/4 (December 2008) narrow and steeped in biblical parameters thinly disguised as “scientific methodol- ogy.” Behaviourism, with its bulk of mechanical and simplistic presuppositions, is a product of such culture. It provides its followers with the comfort of thinking they are accumulating “objective and scientific data” while, at the same time, and in flagrant contradiction with scientific methodology, perpetuating theological assumptions. Behind the fear of anthropomorphism lies another fear concerning the uncomfort- able notion of a continuity between the human and the animal. It is interesting how both positions are interrelated and co-dependent.3 Anthropomorphism is a projec- tion of such anxiety rather than a projection of the “human” onto the “animal.” A t the same time that Queneau’s narrator denies both anthropomorphism andmental activity to his fish, his language pays homage to the fusion between human and animal. From the beginning, Queneau plays with puns that are indicative of a common ground between human language and animal existence: the fish have a funny life, doradrole [drôle and dorade, a species of fish], and they have an aiguesistence [exis- tence and water-existence, from the Middle French: aigue = water] (Queneau 12). As the narration progresses, this “existence” will become ogresistence [ogrexistence], in the case of the lobster; eksistence, in the case of crabs and other animals whose skeleton is outside; eggsistence when speaking of reproduction and so on and so forth (17, 34). As the narrative advances, there is a radical subversion of human consciousness, operated by a constant meditation, on the part of the narrator, on the exterior and interior aspects of life and existence, mirrored by his reflections on the inhabitants of the aquarium.4What, at the beginning, seemed to be “human” consciousness—a med- itation on the human condition and its existence—becomes a new interface where human and animal merge. The narrator shows us that it is impossible to remain on the outside, separated by the thick glass. The subversion of the difference between human and animal happens in the very act of separation. Like a Moebius strip, where what is interior on the one side becomes exterior on the other as a result of continuity and not of delimited borders, Pierre Nabonide achieves this state: “La vie tout entière est présente dans chaque animal. La moule est aussi parfaitement, aussi pleinement vivante que la vache ou que l’homme. Que la moule, qu’une moule ait, non pas une conscience, mais une certaine façon de se transcender; me voilà de nouveau plongé dans des abîmes d’angoisse et d’insécurité . . . Liberé de la Crainte. Je m’arrête ébloui” (Queneau 12). What had begun as a differential reflection on the existence of fish and himself becomes an engagement with life and that which comes after. It is a transformation that is operated by a philosophical reflection, mainly through a meditation on existence and life: “Entre l’homme et le homard, entre le </page> <page sequence="7"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 135 Élide Valarini Oliver 135 homard et l’huître, il y a (en dehors de la lettre h) ce lien, ce point, cette solidarité: la crainte” (Queneau 33), or: “Leur vie n’est plus notre vie. Mais c’est pourtant LA vie. Elle nous échappe. Cette absence meme de crainte nous paraît une absence de vie et cependant c’est là une vie, très loin, très loin au-dessous de nous” (34). The biblical assumption is erased, as well as the previous philosophical assumptions concerning the animal-machine. But, this kind of transformation, through associations and sub- versions, this kind of new consciousness so seamlessly attained, can only be com- pleted and achieved in the space of literature. Among the most compelling and evident reasons for this are the elements that make the literary text unique: its ulti- mate openness and capacity to subvert itself as it presents itself.  Another case, very similar to Queneau’s fish, and indeed inspired by him, hap- pens in the short story “Axolotl,” by Julio Cortázar. In it, we have a narrator who is fas- cinated by these strange creatures living in the aquarium of the Jardin de Plantes in Paris. The narrative is written from the point of view of a projective logic, which, once admitted, is promptly denied. Cortázar uses the paradox as a form of advancing his narrative. The glass that separates observer and observed is also the mirror in which both narrator and Axolotl reflect their own perceptions about one another. This glass is both mirror and window. The narrative begins with the observations of the observer: “Hubo un tiempo en que yo pensaba mucho en los axolotl. Iba verlos al acuario del Jardín des Plantes y me quedaba horas mirándolos, observando su inmovilidad, sus oscuros movimientos. Ahora soy un axolotl [There was a time when I used to think a lot about the axolotl. I used to go and see them at the aquarium in the Jardin de Plantes and remain hours admiring them, observing their immobility, their dark movements. Now I am an axolotl]” (Cortázar 381),5 and ends with the axolotl’s reflections on the narrator, musing on how the bridge that united them then had been cut out:  Ahora soy definitivamente un axolotl, y si pienso como un hombre es solo porque todo axolotl pensa como un hombre dentro de su imagen de piedra rosa. Me parece que de todo esto alcancé a comunicarle algo en los primeros días, cuando yo era todavía él. Y en esta soledad final, a la que él ya no vuelve, me consuela pensar que acaso va a escribir sobre nosostros, creyendo imaginar un cuento va a escribir todo esto sobre los axolotl (Cortázar 385). [Now definitely I am an axolotl, and if I think like a man, it is only because every axolotl thinks like a man inside his pink stone image. It seems to me, of all this, that I managed to com- municate something to him, in the first days, when I was still him. And, in this final loneliness, to which he no longer comes, I console myself thinking that perhaps he is going to write a story about us, that, believing he’s imagining a story, he’s going to write all this about axolotls]. </page> <page sequence="8"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 136  136 Mosaic 41/4 (December 2008) The story, in the end, demonstrates the intimacy between the human narrator and the strange axolotl. They both think, they can communicate. Perhaps, even now that the bridge of communication has been cut off, the axolotl can console itself that the story the reader is reading has its source in it. It is also worthwhile noting that, in the case of Cortázar’s story, the animal is fictitious. It is described as a pink half-fish, half-lizard, with golden eyes and slow movements. In choosing a fictitious animal, Cortázar is exposing, with more cogency, the possible relationship between two sen- tient consciousnesses. Perhaps a comparison, with a different, although similar, approach, of the human and the animal will serve to reinforce the points being developed in this short article. T he short story-novelette, “Meu Tio, o Iauaretê” (“My Uncle, the Jaguar; “iauar” isTupi for “jaguar”) by João Guimarães Rosa—the most prominent Brazilian novel- ist of the twentieth century—has a narrative structure that resembles the author’s masterpiece novel, Grande Sertão: Veredas. Both are written in the shape of a mono- logue. In “Meu Tio, o Iauaretê,” Macuncozo6 tells his story to a stranger who came from the city, in search of him. In a story that subtly merges the three constitutive branches of Brazilian culture, its social and cultural character represented by the Native Indian, the Black, and the European elements, Guimarães Rosa creates a character whose hybridism goes beyond the human species. Macuncozo thinks he is a jaguar. The story is woven to present itself as a radical isomorphism. The very language in which the protagonist- monologuist expresses himself, which is the language of the story, transforms itself completely along the way in order to follow and accommodate Macuncozo’s own rad- ical transformation. The more Macuncozo speaks, the more he changes into a dan- gerous jaguar. As the story unravels, we learn that the stranger who appears in his hut with bottles of cachaça or pinga [sugarcane brandy] is there in order to kill Macuncozo. The latter, in his “jaguar state” is a dangerous murderer, with a preference for killing the black people living in the sparse cabins in the outskirts of the farm. However, Macuncozo is an African name. As Macuncozo-Jaguar drinks, he tells his strange tale of love, hunting, murder, and metamorphosis. As remarked above, the language of the story transforms itself in order to make room for Macuncozo, and it collapses when the protagonist reaches his ultimate transformation. His last words are roars in the manner of big cats:  “Eu – Macuncozo – Faz isso não, faz não.....Nhenhenhén.....Heeé!...Aarrã...Aaãh... Cê mearrhoôu....Remuaci....Rêiucâamacê...Araaã...Uhm...Ui...Ui...Uh...uh...êeêê...êê </page> <page sequence="9"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 137 Élide Valarini Oliver 137 ....êarrhoôu....Remuaci....Rêiucâamacê...Araaã...Uhm...Ui...Ui...Uh...uh...êeêê...êê ....ê...ê...” (Guimarães Rosa 852). [“Me—Macuncozo—Don’t, no don’t...Ehh ehh, ehhe, Heeyah!... Heh....Aargh- aargh...Aaah...You...grrraaazedme...Remuassi...Reyoucaanasseh.....Aaawwh.... Whoah...Whoah...Uh...uh... grrraaazed ...eeehh....eeh...eh...eh...” (Treece 90)]   Yet, this isomorphic roar is composed by the interweaving of Tupi words. In a note the author sent to the poet Haroldo de Campos, he explained that he used the Nheengatu to compose the end and climax of the story. Guimarães Rosa thus explained Macun- cozo’s last words as such: “Me—Macuncozo, Remuaci (ré+muacikera) and Rêiucâanacê (rê+iucá+anacê) can be interpreted, respectively, as Friend+half-brother (or allied, mu); Friend+kill+almost kin; both are compositions extracted from the Tupi” (Campos 578).7 Nhehen means “to speak” and Macuncozo’s monologue is interspersed with the expression Nhem?, used as expletive and interrogative. It sounds like a small variation of another expletive-interrogative very much used by Brazilians: hein?, meaning par- don, what, and other similar interchanges. Guimarães Rosa, moreover, creates from nhehen the verb nhehengar, and Macuncozo explains to his interlocutor that the lan- guage of the jaguar (in Tupi, iauar-etê) is jaguarnhenhén. Macuncozo also likes the leitmotif: Mecê tem medo? (Afraid, sir?), used to confirm his power to threaten the visitor and the power of the “wild.” He had been hired by a farmer as a jaguar hunter (in Portuguese, the preferred term for jaguar is onça) to keep his lands safe for the cattle. After killing a huge number of different types of jaguars— pinimas, suaçuranas, pixunas, cangussus—Macuncozo has a change of heart. He falls in love with a female jaguar whom he calls Maria Maria—a name recalling Macuncozo’s own mother: Mar’Iara Maria.8 In a radical inversion, he starts to kill all the humans who happen to be in his way. The shift brings into play deep ironies. In order to imi- tate the naturalnesswith which these animals kill, since they are carnivores, Macuncozo has to become brutal and violent, subverting the natural order of things. The division between the human and the animal here is brutally shown, not because of biology: Macuncozo cannot break free from the human world without breaking its moral order. The animal kills to survive. Macuncozo, thinking he is a jaguar, also kills but to live, it could be argued. However, being a human, he must be stopped. There is room to speculate that Macuncozo develops an acute sense of guilt towards the jaguar; this change of heart can account for a larger and more complete transformation of his entire perspective, a transformation that will lead him to direct his previous hunter instincts towards the human and invert his hunting from jaguars </page> <page sequence="10"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 138  138 Mosaic 41/4 (December 2008) to humans. As he previously hunted jaguars as a human, with a rifle, now, he hunts humans as a jaguar, tearing them to pieces, opening their jugulars, even eating them. The story is complex enough to accommodate various interpretative hypotheses. Macuncozo could be a delusional, murderous psychotic. This is the view chosen by his interlocutor, the visitor who arrived to eliminate him. As Macuncozo unfolds his story of crimes, they serve to prove his guilt before human society. Yet, the justice delivered by the visitor requires no judge, trial, or jury and is done according to the justice system of the Sertão [backlands]. Macuncozo confesses, and in order to defend himself, he acts both like a trapped animal and a human. In his last attempt to save his own life, he threatens the visitor both as a jaguar and as a madman. However, to his own mind, Macuncozo is a jaguar: “Um dia, lua-nova, mecê vem cá, vem ver meu rastro, feito rastro de onça, eh, sou onça! Hum, mecê não acredita não? [One day, new-moon, sir, you come, come to see my footprints, like jaguar’s footprints, hey, I’m a jaguar! Humm, sir, don’t you believe it?]” (Guimarães Rosa 840). He may firmly believe jaguars are his kin, and he may be trying to justify himself (or self-justify) before the menacing visitor, as well: “Mas eu sou onça. Jaguaretê tio meu, irmão de minha mãe, tutira...Meus parentes! Meus parentes! [‘But I am a jaguar. Jaguaretê, uncle mine, brother of my mother, tutira . . . My kin! My kin!’]” (841). The story is woven around a mythical node of extreme complexity and various layers. The inspiration may have come from Ovid’s Metamorphoses where seamless change occurs between humans, animals, plants, minerals, gods, nymphs, and other beings. Macuncozo is a hybrid in the same manner, living on many levels of frontiers: the edges of the farm he is hired to protect; a rim between the cultivated fields (cul- ture) and the wilderness (nature); the margins between sanity and madness; the boundary between animal and human; the border between myth and logos. The same can be said about the settings of the story, which is developed between two worlds, the world of the farm and the world of the Sertão. The latter is both a geo- graphical and a symbolic region in Brazilian literature. It may be located in the semi- arid regions of the interior of the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Minas Gerais. It has been a consistently powerful character in the works of writers such as Euclides da Cunha and Graciliano Ramos, and poets such as João Cabral de Melo Neto. The Sertão for Guimarães Rosa encompasses both the concrete world of the desertic lands of the interior regions of Minas Gerais and the metaphysical, abstract symbolism of the world and the universe. In contrast to Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha county, however, Guimarães Rosa’s Sertão is not a double mirror of an existing society, but a micro- cosm absent of distracting details, intervening in the lives of the humans like the pow- erful gods of antiquity. The Sertão is a numinous place. In his great masterpiece </page> <page sequence="11"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 139 Élide Valarini Oliver 139 Grande Sertão: Veredas,9 disguised under the geography of the title (large Sertão, green pathways), one finds the elements of the struggle of humanity to make sense, to bring meaning and life to existence. If the world and the universe are powerfully and heavily arid, it is in the veredas, the green, bushy, lively borders of the small streams of the Sertão that humanity can live and prosper. Actually, it is only in creating these pathways, these veredas, that our existence as human beings is possible. In the case of Macuncozo, there are no pathways, except the trails created by the jaguars in the middle of the Sertão, or their invasion of the world of the cultivated farm. But if they invade the world of culti- vation, they are killed; therefore Macuncozo himself, because he has chosen the ways of the Sertão and invaded the world of civilization, will be killed.  The anthropological components of the story are evident: the question of the totem and the animal kin are discussed by James G. Frazer in The Golden Bough (a book Guimarães Rosa admired extensively); Freud’s essay Totem and Taboo is another complementary source of inspiration. The totem is the animal spirit to whom humans, through their veneration, choose as animal ancestor. Once the level of kin- ship with a chosen animal ancestral spirit is established, it is a dangerous taboo to kill any animal of that species, since it means you will kill your own kin: your uncles and cousins. It is also forbidden to eat your animal kin. Totemic thought is fundamental for Brazilian natives—most especially the Tupinambás, made famous by Montaigne in his essay on cannibals, which was, in turn, based on information gathered by Jean de Léry and André Thevet. For the Tupinambás, the practice of anthropophagy10 was a bonding ritual through which to ingest—and thus acquire the power and strength of—the enemy, and was widespread. Not long ago, re-reading Hans Staden’s diary of his captivity among the Tupinambás in Rio de Janeiro, I came across an illuminating passage. In chapter 43 of his True History of his Captivity, Staden writes about how the tribe was preparing for the ritual anthropophagic banquet of some captive mamelucos (white and native mes- tizos). Staden tries to change the fate of the captives by begging the chief Cunhã Bebê [KonyAN beBE] to spare their lives. The chief is sitting in his hut, already eating the flesh of previous human victims. He offers Staden a piece of a leg but Staden refuses it, vehemently trying to reason with the chief, telling him that even animals, who have no reasoning or understanding, never eat their own species, so why would humans eat their own brothers? The chief, then, angrily answers: Jau ware sehe (I’m a jaguar) (Staden 110).11 Being a “jaguar,” the chief could eat humans since he was not eating his own species. It is impossible to determine if Guimarães Rosa used this episode as direct inspiration or source for his story. Having certainly read the book, canonical for </page> <page sequence="12"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 140  140 Mosaic 41/4 (December 2008) Brazilians, the episode may have remained, consciously or unconsciously, in his mem- ory. Yet, it is possible to create a link between the chief ’s thoughts and Macuncozo’s musings concerning the totemic kinship with the jaguar. There are hints in the story that Macuncozo was eating his human victims, since they were found with missing pieces and marks of teeth tearing. As observed above, however, because Macuncozo belonged to a human order, or at least, part of him did, the more he “went animal,” the more barbaric, to human eyes, his actions seemed. As a hybrid, he could not be entirely animal, thus, he could not extricate himself from the moral order of the human world. In light of the split conception about what is cannibalism and what is anthropophagy in Brazilian culture, from Macuncozo’s point of view, being a jaguar, like Staden’s chief, assured him he was not eating his own species, while for Macun- cozo’s visitor, it was a clear case of cannibalism. Albert Schweitzer writing about the case of “Leopard Men” in Africa, who were terrorizing villagers with their antics and behaviour, observes: “‘Leopard men are men with the delusion that they are really leopards and have a compulsion to kill human beings. They try in their killing to behave like leopards. They go on all fours; they bind leopard claws or iron claws on their hands and feet, to leave behind tracks like those made by leopards; and they tear the arteries in the necks of their victims as the leop- ard does” (Schweitzer 14).12 Finally, the story of Macuncozo does not imply that the world of the animal is amoral. It focuses the problem in Macuncozo’s own impossibility. Having been born a human, he cannot choose to leap boundaries imposed by humanness. In the human world, it is ultimately the individual who bears responsibility towards the rest of soci- ety, and Macuncozo, as individual, could not escape his lot. A recurrent argument of the biblical point of view is a simplified version of human morality and ethics, as if they develop qualitatively differently in humans than in ani- mals. But biology and ethology increasingly collect examples of rudiments of moral behaviour in other species, pointing out that, also in this sphere, we have to advance with caution when it comes to “qualitative” leaps separating the human species from the rest. Differences are better expressed in levels of quantity than quality. To find out that there is a continuity between our human species and others only makes individual responsibility even more central to the question of what it really means to be human. There is no facile “determinism” in such findings, just as there is none, either, when the theory of evolution shows us that we are part of a larger picture of life. I chose to compare Queneau and Guimarães Rosa because they offer two distinct and yet complementary attitudes and perspectives on the issue of the human and the animal. Queneau’s perspective invites the subversion of the Cartesian and the biblical </page> <page sequence="13"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 141 Élide Valarini Oliver 141 perspectives concerning thought, mind, and “humanness” by gradually biting off the borders between the human and the animal. This erasure is operated through a reflec- tion on diametrically opposed modes of existence [aiguesistence], fish and humans, in which what looks like radical alterity becomes inner subjectivity. The narrator of Queneau’s story becomes more human the more he penetrates the world of alterity, as represented by the aquarium. In the case of “Meu Tio, o Iauaretê,” the biting out of the borders between human and animal comes through a return to myth, by the fundamental identification process present in ritual, magic, myth, and poetry that enables us to merge with our ancestral kin: the animal. Notes 1/ A recent example involves new research in colonies of animals at the bottom of the sea, which even recently were still thought to be plants (See “The Deep,” a segment of The Blue Planet, Perf. David Attenborough, BBC &lt;www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/tv/blueplanet&gt; [October 2006]). 2/ There are many similar examples in accounts involving domestic and wild animals by their owners, handlers, or researchers. Among the many studies, one can cite Nathan J. Emery and Nicola S. Clayton’s “The Mentality of Crows: Convergent Evolution of Intelligence in Corvids and Apes” in Science 306.5703 (10 Dec. 2004): 1903–1907. See also The Cognitive Animal. Empirical and Theoretical Perspectives on Animal Cognition, eds. Mark Bekoff, Colin Allen, and Gordon M. Burghardt (Cambridge Mass: MIT P, 2002). 3/ Animal behaviourism preserves the axiom of separation between the “animal” and the “human,” disen- gaging itself, ultimately, from Darwin’s theory of human descent. It is ironic to examine its popularity in the United States, where religion and science seem often to be at odds. 4/ It is very telling that the observation of fish reveals a welter of reactions in Pierre, the narrator, who passes from passivity to active change in his existential observations. Compared to his musings when he sees only himself in a mirror, the difference in attitude and tone is telling “Je restai immobile, regardant machinalement ma face dans une sorte de miroir déformant; je constatai que j’avais bien cet air plutôt con, qu’on m’avait toujours attribué, cet air se multipliait par la déformation qui donnait à mon image une bla- farde ductilité” (37). 5/ All translations mine except where otherwise indicated.  6/ In an explanatory note sent to a Brazilian poet, Haroldo de Campos, Guimarães Rosa writes that he chose the name Macuncozo for its “African overtones.” See Haroldo de Campos’s article, “A Linguagem do Iauaretê.” Fortuna Crítica. Ed. Eduardo F. Coutinho (Rio de Janeiro: Civilização Brasileira, 1991), 578. 7/ Nheengatu [pronounced nye-AIN-ga-TOO] was the “general language” spoken mainly in the South-East and South of Brazil (regions less controlled by the Portuguese Crown). It was spoken until well into the eighteenth century, when it was forbidden by order of the Portuguese Prime-Minister Marquis of Pombal. Fashioned by Jesuits, from Tupi and Guarani words, Nheengatu became naturalized by constant use and was the main form of communication in the land. For historical reference about the Nheengatu, see: Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, Raízes do Brasil (São Paulo: Companhia das Letras, 2005), 53, 65, 193–94. 8/ João, Macuncozo’s mother, is a Native woman whose name reveals yet another syncretism: Maria, the mother of Jesus and Iara, the mother of the waters and most important female divinity for the Tupis. 9/ Unfortunately, the English translation of the book is incapable of rendering the linguistic complexities of the work. Named The Devil to Pay in the Backlands, this flawed and uninspired version may be the rea- son why the work of the writer has not had the impact and recognition in English speaking countries it has had in other languages, among those, the Italian, German and Spanish. </page> <page sequence="14"> Mosaic 41(4) new:Mosaic 40(4)  03/11/08  10:22 PM  Page 142  142 Mosaic 41/4 (December 2008) 10/ Brazilians recognize a conceptual difference between “cannibalism” and “anthropophagy.” The first involves simply the eating of humans by humans. The term is applied to pathological individuals as well. Anthropophagy is a term with specific anthropological and cultural connotations. It applies to ritual eating exclusively, and is organically related to a system of culturally defined beliefs. The term was widely adopted, metaphorically, as a symbol of Brazilian culture in general, a culture that adopts, digests, and draws strength from a wide number of sources from all over the world. 11/ It is worthwhile noting that Guimarães Rosa even preferred to use the term iauaretê/jaguaretê for jaguar, instead of simply iauar/jaguar, which already conveys the meaning. This makes the resemblance with the chief ’s statement even more compelling: iauaretê and iauaresê. 12/ This passage appears in Mittelungen aus Lambarene written between 1924 and 1927 (in print in 1928). Fluent in German and consul in Germany in 1939, Guimarães Rosa possessed works of Schweitzer in his library and professed admiration for his works. Meu Tio, o Iauaretê was posthumously published, in 1969, along with other unfinished and finished short stories in a collection named Estas Estórias by the pub- lisher. The story in question was considered “finished,” despite some interrogation marks in a few passages here and there suggesting further adjustments which, unfortunately, the author was not able to complete.
