<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Time and Chance to Consciousness: Studies in the Metaphysics of Charles S. Peirce. EDITED BY EDWARD C. MOORE AND RICHARD S. ROBIN. (Oxford: Berg, 1994. Pp. xii + 269. Price not given.) For those who know Charles S. Peirce only by reputation, this book's subtitle may be surprising. He is often seen as an early positivist, defending a verificationist theory of meaning which was used as an anti-metaphysical weapon. Even those who are aware that he tried to develop a system of'scientific metaphysics' have dismissed this as a late aberration which conflicts with his more important work on logic and meaning. Scholarship over the last two decades has come to see that this is a misreading: Peirce's metaphysics aims to be coherent with his pragmatism, offering a broad, empirically grounded, account of reality, without which, he thought, his pragmatism could not be sustained. The one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Peirce's birth was the occasion of a large conference at Harvard in I989. As well as a collection of plenary addresses, around a dozen volumes of submitted papers have been published of which From Time and Chance to Consciousness is one. Most of the papers are brief and, since few are intended for a readership unfamiliar with the shape of Peirce's thought, they do not provide an introductory guide to his metaphysics. But there are interesting discussions of a range of metaphysical issues, and the introduction by the two editors offers a useful description of the scope of Peirce's metaphysical project. The reader may be better prepared for the character of Peirce's metaphysics, which he once described (probably inaccurately) as a version of objective idealism influenced by Schelling, when it is recalled that the contemporary who was probably most directly influenced by his writings was Josiah Royce, described by Peirce himself as the pragmatist whose views were closest to his own. We should begin with a sketch of how these metaphysical ideas are related to the better known doctrines that make up Peirce's pragmatism. These are twofold: a broadly verificationist programme for the clarification of concepts, and a distinctive account of truth. We can achieve complete clarity concerning a concept by listing ?

For example, if an object is magnetic, then if we place it close to iron filings, we expect to see them move towards it. I doubt that he thought of these conditionals as analytic in any technical sense, and it seems clear that he expects them to reflect background knowledge, and so on. His claim is that clarifying a hypothesis in this way omits nothing which is relevant to evaluating it using respectable methods of enquiry. And carrying out such clarifications will enable us to dismiss all 'ontological metaphysics' (but not 'scientific metaphysics') as 'gibberish'. Much of his later work is devoted to trying to prove this doctrine - in particular, to arguing that the ideals of explanatory completeness and elegance which guide theory choice in the sciences introduce no conceptual elements which such a pragmatist clarification would ignore, and to showing (or attempting to show) that it can be proved using the systematic theory of reference and understanding which he developed under the heading 'semiotic'. Peirce's conception of truth and reality provides a pragmatist clarification of these notions. Broadly, if a proposition is true, then anyone who en- quired into it long enough and well enough would arrive at a stable belief in it, one which would not be disturbed by any further evidence that might be gathered: this seems close to what Crispin Wright has called 'superassertability'. A model for how this is achieved is provided by the self-correcting character of statistical sampling; and he tries to explain non-statistical empirical testing as the sampling of experi- ential predictions which can be derived from the hypothesis under test. At the very least, it was rational to hope that any intelligible question could be answered using the method of science - although our judgement that we had reached this final opinion might always be overthrown by further evidence. Fundamental to Peirce's work is his claim that his pragmatism could only be plausible to someone who was committed to the truth of realism, and he called himself a 'realist of a somewhat extreme stripe'. One of the many strands involved in this was a non-Humean approach to causation, laws and propensities. There are objective truths about 'would-be's, about what would have happened had we sub- jected some object to a test which we actually failed to carry out. There are truths about how responsible enquiry would converge even if we do not bother to carry out the enquiry or if human life dies out before the true opinion has been reached. One target of Peirce's metaphysics is the vindication of this realism and a demonstration that it is in harmony with the verificationism embodied in his principle for clarifying hypotheses. The first four papers in From Time and Chance to Consciousness are con- cerned with the relations between Peirce's 'realism' and the doctrines linked to his pragmatism. The core of Peirce's metaphysics combines the proposal ('tychism') that some events occur by chance, and the invocation of a weak tendency to 'take habits', which enables us to explain the origin of laws and leads him to suggest that the universe was becoming steadily more and more regular and law-governed through time. This, he thought, was the only alternative to treating laws and 'would-be's as brute inexplicable phenomena, which, he thought, was not a defensible option. Using anthropomorphic categories ('habit taking', etc.) was in harmony with his ?

The papers in the second section of the collection undertake some detailed investiga- tions of these views: Milic Capek explores Peirce's conception of time, J. van Brakel looks at the uses made of the concept of chance, Felicia Kruse usefully examines the anthropomorphic dimension, and David Finkelstein discusses the similarities between Peirce's scientifically informed cosmology and more recent ventures in the same area. Before the brief closing section, which contains interesting pieces on Peirce's conception of the self as 'metaphysical reflections' on his writings on chess, there are discussions of the impact of his metaphysical work on his understanding of science and of the systems of logical metaphysical categories which were used in developing these ideas. This system of categories derived from the attempt to correct Kant's logic, and hence his 'metaphysical deduction'. Any language adequate for scientific reasoning must contain monadic, dyadic and triadic relations, expressions with, respectively, one, two and three 'unsaturated bonds'. No more complex relations are required. Three broad logical, phenomenological and metaphysical categories correspond to these three classes of relations. The anti-Humean realism about causal modalities depended upon the argument that, within the physical world, there is real 'triadic' mediation: laws mediate between the two events that they link; and this mediation is present in experience. A major function of the metaphysics is to explain how that can be. Four papers deal with different aspects of the reality, phenomenology and logic of these categories. The 'taming' of Peirce's metaphysics has been a major concern of recent scholarship, and the current volume contributes to our growing understanding of these matters. The introduction would be useful for someone trying to gain a foothold on this terrain, and some of the papers make valuable contributions to further progress.
