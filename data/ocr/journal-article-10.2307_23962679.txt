<plain_text><page sequence="1">What What What are we Doing when we Pray? A Philosophical Inquiry. By Vincent Brummer. Pp. 138. London: SCM Press, 1984· £5 95· This book plunges straight in to the notorious problems about prayer. 'According to Matthew 21: 22, Jesus said to his disciples: "Whatever you pray for in faith you will receive." Many believers have some difficulty with the generality of this promise.' They do indeed. One might say that this is an understatement. Nor does the book return to this Biblical beginning. It is not its purpose to discuss whether the Lord really said this and if so what he meant by it. The subtitle is more precise: 'a philosophical inquiry.' The strength of this short book is that it never slithers away from the philosophical questions about prayer and actually sets itself to provide answers to them, answers which (to this reviewer at least) are clear, cogent, and convincing. This is not one of those books which entice one by a preliminary exposition of the difficulties and then take refuge in vagueness or pious cliche when one's hopes for a really constructive discussion have been aroused. His style is dry but very clear. The answers he gives are, not especially original, but very fairly and comprehensively worked out. There are no fireworks such as Austin Farrer ignited; but he can set out an explanation of, for instance, 'double agency' (e.g. p. 65) in a thoroughly lucid and therefore encouraging way. He makes appreciative use of the thought of other people and there is a a helpful bibliography (though it has to be admitted that it is not very convenient to have to track down the source of a quotation to the bibliography through the notes).</page><page sequence="2">548 REVIEWS His approach could be summarized as a thoughtful and cautious anthropomorphism of personal relationships. God is, of course, 'very different from human persons' (p. 34) but he is more of a person than we are, not less. So prayer is much more than 'thera peutic meditation': it impinges upon God, not only upon ourselves. Difficulties about whether prayer has any effect are to be answered by careful consideration of how persons do interact with one another. God is not to be experimented upon, presumed upon, manipulated, nor ignored, not because of his incomprehensible uniqueness but because what matters is our personal relationship with him. Professor Briimmer will not solve the problems about God's omniscience by taking refuge in Boethius' famous answer that to God all events are present: he does not foresee but sees (p. 41; and Calvin p. 43). If God is truly personal time is more important than that, and we must allow an element of real indeterminacy in the universe as God has created it. God could have created a determi nistic universe, but we know from experience that he has not done so. Instead, for the sake of human freedom, he has chosen to limit his own omniscience. He knows all there is to know, including possibilities and probabilities (p. 44), but he does not know the future as present. A criticism which might be made of Professor Briimmer's personalism is, not that it is too anthropomorphic, but that it is not quite complex enough. He is inclined to adopt quite straight forwardly Heiler's surely over-simple distinction between pro phetic and mystical piety (pp. 74-8). He does not fit into his argument more variegated kinds of relationship between persons than 'agapeistic fellowship' and 'agreements involving rights and duties' (pp. 78-9). Just as in the name of personalism he is willing to set logical bounds to God's omniscience, so he argues convincingly that God can limit his own omnipotence and permit events which are 'con trary to his positive will' (p. 95). What our personal God will not do is 'act out of character by deviating from his purposes', which are to treat us as free persons. In his careful setting out of this standard answer to the problem of evil, Professor Briimmer avoids the trap of the 'death by a thousand qualifications', of saying anything we like about God's intentions by really saying nothing. He ties our know ledge of God's intentions closely to the 'tradition of faith, which comprises the cumulative experience of the community of believers through the ages' and so provides the individual believer with a real 'interpretive framework' (pp. 96-7). For anyone who firmly believes in God, this is all convincing and satisfying. Professor Briimmer follows through the arguments with</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 549 patience and fair-mindedness and gives an attractively steady base to his conviction that 'we can give thanks to God whatever happens, even though we do not thank him for whatever happens' (p. 95). It may be doubted whether he takes quite urgently enough the atheist option. Plenty of people avoid these problems entirely by denying that there is a God at all. Especially when one is haunted by the undeserved miseries of other people, the insistence that this troublous world was made by God, but that whatever happens we are to feel no resentment, can ring more hollow than faithfulness easily appreciates. It may not be reasonable to expect 'a philo sophical inquiry' to be able to minister directly to this moral kind of unbelief; but maybe a greater emphasis upon the Cross of Christ would help, both with the problem of evil and with the meaning of the saying with which the book begins.
