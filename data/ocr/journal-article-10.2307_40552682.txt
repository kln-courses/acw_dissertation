<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cultural Values, Communication, and Urban Image in Hausaland Harold Olofson Department of Anthropology University of Pittsburgh ABSTRACT: This paper explores the cultural values which promote the age-old Hausa custom of living in large urban settlements, and the migration to them from small rural ones. Three focal concepts are significant. Harka has a range of mean- ings extending from the general one of "life" and "movement," through "social interaction" to the more specific "business transaction" and points up the com- mercial genesis of Hausa urbanism. Hira is "pleasurable conversation," and is ubi- quitous in all settlements but is discussed here in terms of its applicability to the analysis of specifically urban social life. Haske, "light," "brightness," "quick in- tellect," "fame," "religious knowledge," is seen as differentially distributed be- tween sarar√≠, "open spaces," "prosperous towns," "central points in a town," "wealth," and lungu, dark "holes," "bush villages," or "back neighborhoods in a town." The data make us aware of a Hausa cultural image of cities which high- lights the communicational advantages of living in them. For centuries the Hausa have been drawn to their cities either through sea- sonal migration (ein rani) or permanent migration (k'aura), coming from both rural and other urban areas. Here I wish to explore the problem of what it is in traditional Hausa cultural values that make large settlements so alluring. What is so good and pleasurable about town life to the Hausa? In Funtua1 , I found three terms, harka, hira, and haske, which are systematically connected in the Hausa love of urban life as a locus of social interaction and communication. I. Harka Gari, the Hausa term for town or settlement, according to Dalby (1964), has connotations associated with trade and economy. For example, the phrase banzan gari (1964:275) translates to "sham" or "useless town/' and refers to a town where trade is generally unprofitable. The Hausa also speak of the death of 145</page><page sequence="2">146 URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 4(2), 1975 a town (gari ya mutu, 1964:284) or of its birth or rebirth {gari ya raya, 1964:286). These may refer to the removal or installation of an important chief in a particular place, but also to the state of economic prosperity which fre- quently parallels the positioning of a high political figure. As is well known, Hausa urban centers have developed with the growth of transcontinental trade routes which for the last several centuries have linked the Mediterranean and the Sahara to the north with the Guinea forest to the south. The rise, growth, and decline of particular Hausa towns has fluctuated with the prominence or disuse of certain trade routes and junctions. Where busy roads have crossed in the past, urban centers have thrived; with the exigencies of inter- and intracontinental his- tory and warfare, and change in the location of resources, markets, and popula- tion, trade routes have shifted and old towns at former key crossings have "died" while new towns have become established at other junctions. Dalby (1964:293) notes the phrase zani gari, literally "I am going (togo) to town," but figuratively "I am going (to go) to market (to trade)." Here the word gari becomes a synonym for market and trade. This in turn reminds us of the phrase y a ci kasuwa, "he ate the market." This is said of a man who entered the marketplace on market day and had a profitable time buying or selling, or it may refer to one who simply went into the market to enjoy watching and listen- ing to the activities there as he wandered from stall to stall, neither buying nor selling. More abstractly, it can mean "he was dependent upon (put himself into a relationship of dependence upon) the market." This becomes evident from the reversal kasuwa y a ci, "the market ate," i.e., the market-place convened and many transactions went on. The reciprocal relationship between the market and the buyers and sellers is pointed up. The townspeople who attend it are depen- dent upon the trade there for some significant part of their subsistence or plea- sure for that day, while the success of any one institutionalized market is in its turn dependent for success upon a goodly number of people coming to it. More- over, the phrase ya ci kasuwa can be said of a person who sells or buys anywhere in a town, on market day or on any other day, outside the marketplace, either from within his own compound, from a strategically located roadside stand, or by hawking through the streets. The term kasuwa begins to look like our own abstract concept of market as a theater of exchange based on the laws of supply and demand not pinned down to a marketplace. We see here how a particular gari may have a particular marketplace at its core (or it may not, as in Bataga- rawa at one time - see Hill 1970), but it is in a broader sense coterminous, or potentially so, with "market." This emphasizes even further the reciprocal inter- dependency that occurs between the population of a gari and the possibilities of commerce which exist there. Trading (cinike) or marketing (kasuwanci) is only one aspect of harka as a broader concept. From Bargery's dictionary (1934) we find that harka can be translated as "prosperity" (as in wane y ana da harka, "so-and-so is prosperous"), "business" (as in ha hark ata ha ne, "it is no business of mine"), and "move-</page><page sequence="3">Olofson URBAN IMAGE IN HAUSALAND 147 ment" or "life" (as in baya harka da hannun nan, "he does not have movement in this hand"). The last meaning is evidence that harka in some uses can relate to the activity involved in commerce in market and at the motor park. Hausa has several other terms for this which can refer to the dynamic qualities of a vital urban place: kai da kawowa, "carrying back and forth"; hayan iy a and haja-haja, "bustling about, going to and fro of a number of people"; and hayatu, kwiyatu, and hargagi, "loud-talking, garrulity, hubbub, raucousness." The business of harka can include more than trading, such as the direct selling of a craftsman to a customer; the use of a middleman between craftsman and buyer (a type of harka called malamala); the relationship between a truck driver, a passenger, and a touter (d'an kamasho); the transfer of very large amounts of money, as in a bank (harka which can more specifically be called huld'a); and the actual move- ment of porters, market browsers, and trucks. The key importance of the concept of harka to Hausa life becomes still more apparent in its extension to all social interaction between human beings generally, as in the following: muna harka maganar Hausa, "We are interacting in the Hausa language"; muna harka sallah, "we are praying together"; muna harka tiki, "we are engaging in a celebration together"; suna harka sammu da junansu, "they are doing sorcery to each other"; and mu tafi harka yawo, "we should go for a walk." In one greeting, the term in its plural form refers to the daily inter- action going on in the world, or the "general works" of people, as said to some- one who has just come from the theater of commerce: ina harkokkin duniya? "How are the world's business affairs?" or "How're things?" The combination of the meaning in harka of "social interaction" and "business" makes good social science, for it suggests another translation, "transaction." The word indicates awareness of the transactional nature of all human communication, not just that which occurs in commerce. But most interesting is its meaning as life2 when used in reference to only a few Hausa cities, namely Kano (both within and outside the walls), Zaria (par- ticularly outside the walls in Sabon Gari and Tudun Wada), Jos, Kaduna, Gusau, and Funtua. Of these towns it is said suna ciki da harka, "they are full of life." These are the fastest-growing urban and commercial centers in Hausaland or its immediate periphery. Data from a census of migrant compound heads in Funtua revealed six interrelated principles which influence their coming to Funtua for purposes of harka. First, there was the relative saturation of trade in the place of origin. One informant followed his father, a kola dealer, on his move from Rogo in Kano. As he put it, Rogo had become an old town (tsohon gari) where trade had become overcompetitive and less profitable compared to Funtua, a new town (sabon gari). It appears that the saturation of Rogo with kola sellers meant that the town became characterized as "old," as not growing in trade. One reason for this is that, as maps will show, Rogo is no longer on a significant road: to refer to it as "old" means that it had become stable in growth and "bush" in geographical</page><page sequence="4">148 URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 4(2), 1975 location. When such a move is made, migrants may say that they came first on a temporary basis, to g wad a, "test, measure (Bargery), try one's luck," before set- tling permanently. For example, another migrant kola seller from Kano, said that he had "found more kola buyers in Funtua than in Kano." This is an inter- esting misperception, in the sense that Kano is several times the size of Funtua, He meant that the market was becoming saturated by kola sellers in Kano. A second principle is the greater volume of sales at the place of destina- tion. An example here is that of a kola seller who came from the small nearby bush village of Goya and found that he could sell more when he came to Funtua on market day, so he decided to move. Whereas he could no doubt sell at higher prices in the remote village after purchasing in Funtua, he decided to take advan- tage of the greater number of customers in the city, though at lower prices. Third, there is the matter of situating oneself at a strategic point in a trading network. One clothes seller, a native of Zaria, found that he could buy cheaply in Zaria, a much larger city, and sell dearly in Funtua; he decided to settle in Funtua. On the other hand, a kola seller from Dutsen Ma in northern Katsina used to buy his item cheaply at Funtua and sell it dearly in his home town. Since Funtua is closer to the origin of the kola (western Nigeria), it is cheaper there than elsewhere in Katsina Emirate. He ultimately decided to move to Funtua. The factors which lead some to migrate to the place of buying, and others to the place of selling, are not clear, but commuting to engage in long- distance trade remains operative in both. Fourth, there is the sensitivity to the economic profit to be found in a new place. The case of an elderly female compound head shows this dramatically. In her home town of Dawakin Tofa, Kano, after the death of her husband, she lived by frying 'yar yau, "daughter of the day," a cake made of beans and guinea corn. Travellers who had been to Funtua informed her that they had bought 'yar yau there for one penny, whereas she had to sell them in Dawaki at 1/2 penny. Thus at the approximate age of 65 she travelled four days on foot to come to live in Funtua and sell her snack. This principle is often related to the first one. For example, one small-wares vendor came to Funtua because he could make more profit due to a lack of competition compared with his former place. A fifth principle is that of convenient transportation. A sack trader at Bakori (seven miles away) used to sell in Funtua and in Zaria on market days, but decided to move to Funtua to cut down on shipping costs to both places. Another old, retired farmer moved from nearby Maiganji so he could be close to a market stall which he procured for selling henna. He could easily reach it by walking from his compound in old age and still be close to his sons farming at Maiganji. And a soapmaker simply found it tiresome to move his product from nearby Tumburkai every Funtua market day. A sixth factor is the chance discovery of good trade. One Zaria man sold kola to someone who ran away without paying him. He heard rumors that the</page><page sequence="5">Olofson URBAN IMAGE IN HAUSALAND 149 man was in Funtua and went looking for him. While he did not find him there, he decided to sell some oranges, bananas, and fowls, his second line, and noted that he got higher prices for them than in Zaria, and thus stayed. These examples show well the principles involved in k'aura to cities for reasons of harka. But despite its obvious importance, out of 208 migrant male Hausa compound heads interviewed in Funtua, only about 30 gave some evidence that they had migrated for economic reasons. This can be explained in two ways: (1) harka may have been partially involved for many more but was not foremost in their minds when interviewed, so that the figure of 30 is an underestimate; and (2) that there are many other reasons why people migrate permanently from one place to another. But of these 208 migrants, approximately 1 10 or over 50% (probably a conserva- tive estimate) are today engaged in trading or craft occupations, full time or part time, and this demonstrates the strength of harka in holding migrants to the city. II. Hira One compound head, a trader, moved to Funtua from a rural place be- cause mutum ya k'ark'aru da warn' a wurin ¬°uma'a, "a person can learn many things from those in a place of community (where there are many people) and can prosper." Several times respondents mentioned that they had settled in Fun- tua because, upon visiting it, they found living there friends from their place of origin, or many who were engaged in the same occupation as they. Now, this last would indicate prosperity for those individuals, in whatever trade, in the town. But, as we have seen, these same people mean competition and rivalry (gaba), a factor which might cause one to move away to places of less competition. Thus a factor other than mere considerations of harka may enter in where economically feasible: people of the same occupation enjoy associating with each other be- cause of common interests and the possibility of learning from each other about their occupation, with long-term economic benefits. The concept involved here is hira, a somewhat intangible factor that may have influenced many migrants to come to Funtua without their being aware that it did so. Hira can be defined as voluntary, informal, relaxed, effortless, and pleasurable conversation, an activity which it has been said the Hausa man abroad misses most about his home and language. According to one informant, a precondition for both hira and harka is jituwa, "harmony" (Bargery) between interactants who are on good terms with each other and who share mutual pleasures. Another word for this 'sshiri, which emphasizes the state of being in "readiness" or "preparedness" (Bargery) for in- teraction. Living in large settlements brings about to a great extent the condi- tions of jituwa and shiri (although greater possibilities of gwabso or karo, "violent collision" if the setting is ethnically heterogeneous, are also present.) The Hausa at least implicitly recognize this.</page><page sequence="6">150 URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 4(2), 1975 Any conversation between anyone, night or day, which meets the criteria mentioned above, qualifies as hira (although some prefer to call daytime conver- sation wuni or y'mi). In terms of its being pleasurable, the conversation can range from chit-chat to the thorough analysis of serious matters, providing that the potential for humor and laughter remains present. Instances of hira include the nightly conversation between the women of a compound in the room of the headwife, the coming of the children of a compound to the newest wife to hear folktales, all of the talk between a man and his wife at night before sleeping (here frequently as a euphemism for sexual intercourse), the meetings of the lame and blind of a town in their respective categories at the compounds of their chiefs on religious holidays, etc. Hira is not restricted to those of the same age or status; it can include conversation between adults and children, rulers and com- moners. As I was told: The District Head can sit in hira with his subjects; he may joke with children, and when they reply it is hira. In hira he can learn the history of his office and of his father and grandfathers from old men; he can learn from his tax collectors which (nomadic) Fulani were quarrelsome before paying tax. Hira can occur with him even after he has ordered you to come to him. Powerful people are fond of hira and want to get in contact with the voices of everyone. Thus in Hausaland a chief is usually found in the largest town of his district. This town remains the capital as long as it remains the greatest in size and prosperity, whereas in some other African societies not truly urban the capital shifts to the home village of each succeeding chief. Perhaps the most ¬°deal or "pure" form of hira is that which takes place between usually more than two men, especially elderly men as I was told, who make up a hira group (abokan hira, "friends of hira"). Such a group may meet every night in the zaure (entrance hut) of the compound of one of the members who is uban hira, "the father of hira," and the friends may eat and pray together as well. Talk may last from nine to twelve at night, and they may remain on one topic for that time, so that it may be said of their talk hira ta ci fura, "the hira ate tobacco-flowers." This idiom refers to the thoroughness and extent to which a subject may be gone into, much in the way tobacco flowers in the old days were chewed so as to stain the teeth red, a matter of personal adornment which has gone out of style. Subjects of talk may involve historical events of olden times (such as the coming of Shehu d'an Fodio or other religious events), the social problems of modern times (prostitution, urban youth, religious training), funny incidents that happened to one of the friends, an important decision that one of them is about to make, the difficulties which one of them is having in his work, what was purchased or sold by them in the market that day, and how the market changed (all short of giving away occupational secrets, of course). (It is believed that hira among women usually involves derogatory gossip or gulma about other women, and that this is so because, being in purdah, they are re- moved from politics or town affairs.) As one participant tells his story, the</page><page sequence="7">Olofson URBAN IMAGE IN HAUSALAND 151 others comment on it. Should the hira group disband too early for one of them, he may move on to another group held in someone else's zaure - I assume from this that an inveterate conversationalist may have several hira groups which he can attend on any one night. A true hira group of this kind would appear to have an enduring social existence, though the origin, evolution, and dissolution of the Hausa hira group still needs to be studied. One important point mentioned to me is that those men who have radios might be more successful in attracting abokan hira. The radio is an object more likely to be found in a wealthier urban house- hold. Thus programs in Hausa, such as the famous Hausa farm program or the one devoted to the interpretation of Koranic law, coming out of Kaduna, can be brought into and made a part of the interaction, and the friends will feel them- selves tied in communicationally to a wider Islamic urban society. Another important concept is wurin hira (pl. wuraren hira), "place of hira/' or, less commonly, ma'aljimta and mazanta. This is any place where peo- ple gather to talk, but especially applies to places in a town which have become traditionally associated with hira. An informant's discussion gives a good sense of urban wuraren hira (parentheses mine): A place where people meet once is not wurin hira. When you go into a motor park you will see people who live there day and night (e.g., drivers' apprentices, kola dealers); they have nothing to talk about except how the market changes and how they can earn money. People in the past used to gather where blacksmiths were working (e.g., the work hut of Sarkin Mak'era, chief of blacksmiths, on a Funtua side street). Perhaps one man might want a knife, another a hoe sharpened, and before the work had finished they would chat. In the old days one could find forty dyers at the dye pits, each with his own pit, talking nonsense (maganan banza, "useless talk" - probably "small talk" is what is implied here). One can find such a place in front of Magaji's (the house of the Village Area Head) where people wait to be sent as messengers, or in front of the court where people wait outside until their case turns up, or in front of the District Head's office where they talk while waiting to see him or when they come out from doing so. The cinema and the bar can be called wurin hira iblis, ("place of devil-/?/ra") for the devil calls people to come there to commit sins (e.g., make assignations with har- lots). The cinema is wurin hira because the picture may cause you to laugh. (The market is a place of hira) because for the (nomadic) Fulani it is their post and telegraph office, where they hear the news of their brothers, wherever they are, or whether the price of cattle has gone up or down. A makwalla is a wurin hira fre- quented by people who talk about others unfairly when they are not there or abuse, mock, or laugh at passersby. Young boys may sell sugar cane there but pull practical jokes on people going by (e.g., tripping up). (In Funtua one makwalla is located in front of a certain bar where inebriated men linger outside, and another under a tree named Rimin Tsiwa, "the silk-cotton tree of insolence".) Three points can be made which relate the value of hira in attracting the Hausa to the city and holding them there. These combine ethnological concep- tualization with Hausa notions, and should be considered as hypotheses for fur- ther investigation. (1) Concerning abokan hira: A significant part of the social texture of a Hausa town consists of the presence of a dense network of hira groups in a com-</page><page sequence="8">152 URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 4(2), 1975 pact social space. The number and variety of topics of conversation favored from group to group or covered in any one group in a session will far exceed those found in a village or hamlet where rural concerns predominate. (2) A Hausa urban center can also be defined in terms of the large number and variety of wuraren hira, in comparison to those in the rural setting. These could be studied in terms of a possible patterning in their interrelationships. (3) The availability and complexity of numerous choices of friends and places of conversation facilitate and are facilitated by jituwa, the potential and actual readiness of the urban Hausa for social interaction. Furthermore these give a richness to daily life and minimize boredom as individuals can move through several places and groups throughout the day. If the Hausa do not ac- tually live in a city, many of them may at least visit there frequently for this kind of contact. To Hausa, hira is in many senses the stuff of life, whether rural or urban in setting, and the more of it, the better. I was told that ginshe or gajiya, "tiredness," or ennui, was sometimes a factor causing rural men and women to strike out for a large town. III. Haske Before we can deal directly with this concept, we must return to the word gari. Dalby (1964:300) pointed out that there is a distinction between gari, which in some contexts can be translated as "urban settlement," and k'auy√®e, "rurat settlement/' "In native speech . . .K'auy√®e is used relatively, denoting a "rural settlement" from the point of view of the speaker ... in this sense the term is often used derisively ..." In other words, each major gari has a number of K'auy√®e satellite villages (Funtua, for example, has Maska, Dan- dume, etc.) and each village has a number of outlying hamlets (s. unguwa; for Maska there is Unguwan Nasarawa, Unguwan Lasanawa, etc.) When standing in either the k'auy√®e or unguwa and talking to an inhabitant, one would refer to these as gari. The use of k'auy√®e here would be pejorative, given the stereotype of the "country bumpkin" that is associated with the k'auy√®e dweller, and would insult the person addressed and the local community. Thus the terms gari and k'auy√®e are oppositional but shift in relation to each other as one moves downward in the hierarchy.3 However, my informants did not always mention k'auy√®e when asked to state the opposite of gari, some choosing instead daji, "uncultivated bush, place of wild animals." The inhabitants of a large town may in fact think of a remote village as daji, further pointing up the pejorative conno- tation of k'auy√®e. The next lowest level, below unguwa, is noma (farm, beyond which is daji) and this, too, can be spoken of as gari, politely, when actually standing on a farm site (for reasons that will become clear below). "Usage of the term (gari, in this way) points to frequent identification of the settlement with</page><page sequence="9">Olofson URBAN IMAGE IN HAUSALAND 153 its economy" (Dalby:297). Finally, dawa, "guinea corn/' may be substituted for daji, when speaking from the point of view of gari, and in this case a (guinea corn) farm is prematurely equated with "the sticks" pejoratively. In sum, we have the following equation: gari:k'auy√®e: : gari: daji The chart below illustrates the relations involved, with row 1 referring to these places as seen from the vantage point of an urban dweller, row 2 from that of a village dweller, row 3 from a hamlet dweller's perspective, row 4 that of a farmer standing in his own farm, and row 5 that of a person standing in antihuman bush usually frequented only by hunters or firewood collectors: (1) gari// daji: (k'auy√®e/ unguwa / noma/ daji) (2) gari/ gari//daji: (unguwa/ noma/ daji) (3) gari/ gari/ gari //daji: (noma/ daji) (4) gari / gari / gari / gari//daji: (daji) (5) gari / gari / gari / gari// daji Thus, as in rows 1 and 5, either the term gari, or the word daji, depending on one's attitude, can be applied to all of the country (a district, an emirate) sur- rounding a central town or capital. In field work, one could confuse two mean- ings of gari. Whenever I asked someone from where he migrated, he might say daga garin Kano, "from the gari of Kano." Thus a second question would be necessary: daga Birnin Kano ko wani k'auy√®e? "From the walled city, or a cer- tain village beyond the walls somewhere in Kano Emirate?" A further usage of gari is one with which speakers of Western languages are unfamiliar (Dalby 297, 302), a usage which relates "human settlement" or "town" to "sky," "day," and "weather," as in the following terms: washegari - an adverb, using the form gari, to mean "next day," as in nar- rative. gari ya waye - "the day, sky broke or cleared," as at dawn; or "next day" as above. gari ya yi haske - "the sky has made light, i.e., cleared; the clouds have gone." gari ya yi sarar√≠ - "the sky has made a clearing, i.e., has cleared." gari ya durb'une - "the sky has frowned, i.e., become overcast, threaten- ing." Now, Dalby (1964:301, 304) points out that gari stands in a certain rela- tion to the term duniya, "the world," in a way we find somewhat confusing. He points out that on the one hand, gari is within duniya, since duniya can be de- fined upon semantic analysis as the "sum total of all human settlements" (1964:303). But, on the other hand, he claims that duniya is at the same time</page><page sequence="10">154 URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 4(2), 1975 antithetical to gari because it represents the world outside of a particular gari. He bases this antithesis on two points: (1) that duniya can be used in the phrase ya shiga duniya, "he entered the world/' to speak abusively of a man who has left home and has lost contact with his family; (2) the point that dare, "night/' as found in proverbs where it is opposed to gari as "day," takes on evil connota- tions. He thus makes the equation: gari (day):√ªte/*e(night)::&lt;73/7(human settlement) :duniya(wor'd) and implies that duniya and dare are symbolic equivalents of "dark" and "evil" as opposed to "light," and "good." But, first of all, the proverbs which he says attribute "evil" to the "night" do not do so clearly to my mind. Secondly, in a forthcoming article I will show how the "evilness" of the world is more appro- priately contrasted with the propriety of life in gida, "compound," "home." Dalby did not note the clue to this in his definition of ya shiga duniya, above. Thirdly, duniya may be evil, but certainly not dark; i.e., we agree with Dalby that it is the collective plurality of all garuruwa (pl. of gari) and this connotes "light." There is a fundamental and interesting opposition, frequently used by the Hausa in conversation when talking about gari, which both Dalby (1964) and Yusuf (1974) missed, and which should help to make things clearer. It is one which parallels the oppositions gari/k'auy√®e and gart /da/i. The antithesis is sarar√≠ or fili versus lungu. Sarar√≠ is an "open space," either on the ground (as the space between the zaure and the women's interior in a compound), on a page, or be- tween clouds in the sky. Fili is a synonym for this borrowed from the English "field," as in ft'/ in kwallo, "football field." Lungu on the other hand is a dark corner or recess in a room or house, an out-of-the-way corner in a district, a cubbyhole (Abraham 1962; Bargery 1934). The factor operating differentially between them 'shaske, "light." Agari at any level has "light." Either ground has been cleared for a market, houses have been erected, or a farm has been created out of a stretch of wild bush. Sarar√≠ has come into being. There is a clearing of the field of view and the light from the sky comes down to fill a space which takes on the attributes of human habitation, and human structures fill that space to act as symbolic equivalents to the light of the sky. This is why a farm can be considered gari. One gets the picture that as a town grows, as new compounds are built up on its periphery to house migrants, and new farms are cleared to be worked by its inhabitants, the darkness (duhu) of the bush gives way bit by bit to the light of the town and the settlement of the world, all reminiscent of the Dogon conception of human civilization and cultivation as the weaving of nature into culture. Lungu refers to a remote settlement, without a thriving market, not located at a major road junction or on a major highway, small in population, not a capital of anything. It is a "bush," a "hole" to those that dwell in places that have these characteristics. This is why the Hausa are not easily impressed by the</page><page sequence="11">Olofson URBAN IMAGE IN HAUSALAND 155 sight of farmlands, and wilder scenery beyond, as seen from what is to the Euro- pean like myself a pleasant vantage from a height within the town: they are looking from gari into daj'i, from sarar√≠ into lungu, and esthetic values lay with the social landscape of the town. The double meaning of gari as "human settle- ment" and "sky" allows us to see the broader meanings of gari as "civilization," even "creation," a product of anthropomorphic beings (Allah, man). The following data help to expand our understanding of haske, and begin to allow us to show the relationship between it and harka, hira, and k'aura. (1) Usman, Bichi, and Perchonock have collected data on the history of the wards in Kano, and among these is the ward of Makwarari (n.d.:2-3). Ac- cording to their report4 its original settlers came from Sudan: M. Ali Jallaba came from Jallaba in the Sudan over two centuries ago. According to oral traditions Ali, his two brothers and a slave left Sudan due to the "troubles of the world" and travelled west. As soon as they started they saw a light in the sky and followed it until they came to Kano where they saw it no more. They believed they were destined to make Kano their home. Each then took a stone and threw it and where it landed built his house. M. Ali's landed at the site of Makwarari .... Here we see the concept of haske in a most poetic form, almost as an abstract force which draws the migrants to the great city, tropismically, as soon as they leave their village. At the point where they saw the light no more, they had ar- rived, i.e., there was no longer any differentiation between the light and the rest of the sky, sky gari and city gari having become one. (2) I first realized the significance of "light" in an interview with the lead- ing Hausa praise singer and recording artist, Alhaji Mamman Shata. I asked why should a man of his success live in Funtua? Of paramount significance was the fact that he was born in Musawa, Katsina, and like most Hausa considered any town in the emirate of his birth as good as home. But Musawa he considered a lungu, whereas Funtua was a sarar√≠. As another praise singer who had migrated to Funtua stated, a person of his craft had to go where there was juma'a, "com- munity." Praise singing is a form of harka, a transaction involving the exchange of gifts for praises, so that the praise singer is attracted to places where wealthy men can be found, centers of population. Shata mentioned two factors that made Funtua attractive to him. Musawa had only one transport road connecting it with the outside, whereas Funtua is a major junction of roads connecting with Katsina, Sokoto and Gusau, Zaria, and Kontagora. From Funtua he could easily and quickly move to these places to perform his craft. Secondly, he noted that "when he used to pass through Funtua it was bush, but now gari yana k'ara haske, the town is increasing in light,5 people are coming from all over and Fun- tua yana k'aruwa, Funtua is growing as new houses are added every year." In short, a man's success is seen as of one fabric with the prosperity of the town in which he lives. Thus it is said of a man as well as of a town, yana da fili/sarari, "he/it is rich."</page><page sequence="12">156 URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 4(2), 1975 (3) One mile east of Funtua there is a village on the Funtua-Zaria high- way at the junction of the road to Kontagora. This is inhabited by farmers who at one time lived a mile further into the bush toward the village of Maiganji, but in scattered hamlets. Their wells drying up, they came to Sarkin Maska and he suggested that they settle in their present location. They are thus conveniently located on a main road but still not far either from Funtua itself nor from their farms. Their former compounds have been allowed to fall into ruins (kufai) or have been turned into gardens. When the residents were asked what seemed to be the advantage of living at this junction (mararraba) two themes appeared: (a) By living close to the road, they said that they would be able to learn new things about ¬£0/7 and more about trading than they could in the bush, and their ward head was close enough to the palace of the Funtua Village Head to go there every day for hira to learn about current events (though he is directly under the jurisdiction of the smaller Maiganji Village Head). One villager said kanmu zai k'arawayewa, "our (collective) intelligence will increase, brighten, become more learned." Note that the word haske also means "quick, (or quickening) intellect" (Bargery 1934), as in yana da haske, "he is bright," as well as meaning "light." Another added in the same train of thought, saboda bakin hanya akwai alheri, "because at the edge of the road there is prosperity." Almost as soon as they were settled, a villager began acting as their d'an kamasho, stopping passing busses for them and arranging for the transport of their farm produce; (b) this proverb was mentioned: Had' a kai y a fi had'a gida, "living together is better than living in separate houses alone." Previously their compounds were far apart, but now they could see more of each other, advise each other, and "have their senses pulled in one direction" - a jawo hankalinsu. The same principles were mentioned by informants at Tudun lya, at the junction of the Funtua-Zaria road and the road to Maska. The populace here was formerly living in five separate bush hamlets. It was said "the advantage of living next to the road is the interest (sha'awa) of seeing trucks passing and the ease of putting loads on the truck. Now there is the ease of communicating with neighbors about marriage and naming ceremonies and attending these, while be- fore we lived in scattered compounds." The theme of harka and of hira are re- lated to haske as a result of living together in a larger nucleation of compounds, and all three are at work in all Hausa settlements of whatever size. (4) One of my younger informants told me that he wished he could move from his present compound to one on the main street. In a response to a query, he said that he would not at all object to the noise of the trucks going by, rather he would welcome being able to see and hear the activities of the town, and moreover, all of his friends could easily find his house. This came as a surprise to me, since his house was only one block away from the main street! Thus the sensitiveness of the Hausa to the distinction, even within the limits of a city, between lungu, "a quiet, back neighborhood" and sarar√≠, "sites near a main road, mosque, market, or truck park." This man used to like to take his evening meal</page><page sequence="13">Olofson URBAN IMAGE IN HAUSALAND 157 in the Reading Room, of which he had charge, located right on the traffic circle in the center of town, rather than in his own compound. The love of harka ap- peared in his relish in being able to experience sensory involvement in the town's activity at close quarters, and hira in his wish to have a house which would be in a location to tempt and waylay friends as they strolled by. Five other terms should be mentioned. The first two are magama or magami, "place of meeting," and magana, "place of seeing." Both are junctions, usually crossroads, though they can also refer to a harbor where ships can be viewed. They are sarar√≠ and thus oppose lungw. junctions are clearings where light comes in to reveal the gathering or passing to and fro of many people. Whole towns are thus magama or magani and in Hausaland several actually have these as names. Points within a town are magami such as a bar or small wayside market where food is sold to passersby. Points within a town that can be magana or magami include the dandali, a sarar√≠ which is frequently used for public enter- tainment, as in ball games, bori spirit possession, or Fulani dances, as well as for children's play. They especially allow a view of a lot of people at once. It is doubtful that many Hausa have objected on esthetic grounds to the European- style wide straight streets imposed by the colonial administration which mark the newer towns and large portions of Funtua. These are dandali, too, and allow a man to look out from his compound at jama'a moving along several blocks away. I have mentioned jama'a several times without explaining it fully. The use of gari for both a town and its region, and for the civilized world, suggests the wider conceptual unity which 's jama'a, the community. Smith (1955:4) defined the community as a unit consisting of (1) a chief or district head (sarki); (2) an appointed head priest {liman)', (3) a regular biweekly market (babban kasuwa); (4) a Friday mosque (masa/lacin Juma'a); and (5) a prayer ground on the out- skirts of a capital for congregation on important religious holidays (masallacin Idi). But this is jama'a at only one level. It can extend beyond to include the entire brotherhood of Islam, and here we must note something of utmost impor- tance, that "light" comes from the religious knowledge held by great koranic scholars found in gari, and from feelings of togetherness which can be found in praying with others of the faith. As one rural- urban migrant said "I came to Funtua because it is good to be able to pray together with a large number of people" either actually in the same crowd as on Friday, or at the same time as they five times a day. At a lower level jama'a can refer to any gathering (taro) of people in public, whether it be men in prayer, a meeting of administrative per- sonnel in an office, or a few people watching a drummer or some cultural perfor- mance. Still lower, it can include the occupants of a compound, for though to our minds the family might seem to be out of the public eye and behind the walls of the house, the Hausa recognize that it makes a public for itself and that certain shameful and respectful norms of behavior must continue to operate most especially from within. Now gari expands and contrasts as jama'a does so,</page><page sequence="14">158 URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 4(2), 1975 and haske with it, along several axes in addition to this one. The widest jama 'ar gari, the world of Islam, is seen as expanding in that sense when both teachers and students traditionally leave their homes to go and teach in other towns, simultaneously taking in and propagating the light of religion. On Friday a com- munity contracts as farmers from outlying hamlets come into mosque; the same is true of market days when they come in to market. It expands as traders and entrepreneurs from the city go to outlying rural areas to do business, and also when city dwellers go out to their farms every morning; it contracts again as they all come back in the evening. The wider and narrow concepts of gari thus get woven out of the comings and going of those in jama'a. (This, too, explains how a farm becomes part of gari for farmers in some part of the day.) Finally, there are maraya and alkarya. Dalby (1964:300) tries to differen- tiate these as his informants saw them. Both he and Yusuf (1974:205) see ma- raya as a compact unit without fields between the houses, in contrast to karkara, where houses are widely scattered. To Dalby, alkarya is an "urban" or "go- ahead" community, and Yusuf's definition of it (1964:213) looks similar to Smith's definition of community with the addition of the Islamic court. Bargery (1934) makes a related distinction. To him, maraya is a "fair-sized town into which villagers can flee on the outbreak of war; a place of refuge." This relates to the "compactness' in Dalby's definition. A maraya used to be a walled place where there was safety in the closeness of numbers.6 Alkarya, according to Bar- gery, was a principal town "where travellers have no difficulty in obtaining food." In the time of Bargery's oldest informants then, it would seem that ma- raya referred to a place of military or corporal security, and was equivalent to birni, "walled town," whereas alkarya implied economic security. But on closer examination, maraya also seems to refer to economic security when one notes Bargery's second definition of the word, "any vital spot in the body." The word "body" - jiki - is not included in the term itself, which is composed of the forms mai-, "place of," and raya (v.), "to quicken, prosper, live long." Raya is thus related to rai, "life," "soul." Maraya quite explicitly refers to a place which is cika da harka, "full of life," and is not much different from alkarya. Both words relate only indirectly to "light" through harka. In inquiring about these terms as they are used today, I could find no certain distinction between them, if there really ever was any. Both refer to those gari in the world which are much more cosmopolitan and sophisticated than others. Informants saw them as hav- ing one or more of these characteristics: (a) they are places where great Islamic teachers can be found; (b) they have markets so that one can be assured of food in them; (c) not everyone who lives there needs to farm; many can subsist through commerce, crafts, or by working in shops (kantuna); (d) many who live there are wage earners (e.g., civil servants) and can exchange cash directly for food, cloth, or other goods, while almost everyone who lives in a village must find ways of transporting crops to these centers before he can get the cash to buy other things (a modern attribute); (e) the houses are close together and</page><page sequence="15">Olofson URBAN IMAGE IN HAUSALAND 159 people can help each other out; (f) they are sophisticated enough to have night accommodations for travellers (the gidan bak'i, "strangers' house" - see Dalby 1964:296) whereas strangers are greatly feared in the villages; and (g) they have a mixture of peoples (occupations, ethnic groups). IV. Conclusion The cultural values that have led Hausa migrants to take up permanent residence in cities within a centuries-old urban tradition show a circular relation- ship in Hausa thinking which provides an image of traditional urban cultural pro- cesses. Harka seems primary; people must first be drawn to a certain site for the possibilities of business transaction which they see as occurring there. In Funtua these possibilities have been based on the cotton-growing industry. As a city grows, becomes more sophisticated commercially, religiously, and in terms of the rich topics of conversation which come into play there, harka and hira in conjunction give rise to "light," haske, metaphysical symbol of the town's pros- perity and fame and of the intelligence of its occupants. Haske in turn draws even more people to the gari, who come so that "their heads will brighten," too, and so that they can learn through conversation and transactional experience the proper paths to getting sarar√≠ or fili, "wealth." The Hausa conceive of cities as places where life, communication, and light are interwoven into one complex significant symbol -gari. NOTES 1 . Funtua has over 20,000 population and dates from the turn of the century. At that time it may have already existed as a hamlet or caravan watering place, but its growth as a major market in Katsina Emirate rests on an underpinning of colonial concerns which have made the city an important transport center in rich cotton-growing country. It is still very much like other, much older Hausa cities. Research in Funtua took place from August, 1970 to August, 1971, partially financed through a small grant from the Center for International Studies, University of Pittsburgh, awarded to Professor Leonard Plot- nicov, to both of whom I express gratitude. I would like to thank Ahmadu Bello Univer- sity, Zaria, for giving me Research Associate status during that time; the Provincial Secre- tary at Katsina for giving me permission to do the research; the Sarkin Maska, District Head at Funtua, for his hospitality; and Professors Peter Bertocci and James Dow for their critical readings of this paper. Any shortcomings remain mine. 2. These definitions of social transaction and vitality are not found in the Hausa dictio- naries. 3. Yusuf's (1974:211-214) list of terms relating to the Hausa rural- urban continuum, though very interesting, nevertheless can be misleading in representing a straight-line, dis- crete conceptualization from extreme bush to extreme urbanism. Thus Dalby's findings here, reconfirmed by myself, need careful repeating. 4. I would like to thank these researchers for supplying me with a copy of their report, which is a summary of research carried out under the auspices of the Metropolitan Kano Planning and Development Board.</page><page sequence="16">160 URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 4(2), 1975 5. He could also have used the verb yi haske, "to make light," or "to shine, improve, be- come illustrious" (Abraham 1962). 6. It seems that for only the very largest cities could a wall protect the inhabitants in war. My data and reading suggest that entire populations of many smaller walled towns fled with the coming of both Fulani and European forces. This does not bespeak much con- fidence in the walls with the threat of serious attack. But people did take refuge there with rumors of much smaller raiding parties or bands of thieves in the neighborhood. Raiders from stranger emirates frequently aimed at capturing farmers in their fields and selling them into slavery. REFERENCES CITED Abraham, R. C. 1962 Dictionary of the Hausa language.
