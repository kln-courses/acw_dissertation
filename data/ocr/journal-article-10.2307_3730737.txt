<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews 489 Zola: 'Therese Raquin'. By CLAUDE SCHUMACHER. (Glasgow Introductory Guides to French Literature, I I) Glasgow: University of Glasgow French and German Publications. I990. iv + 92 pp. ?3.50. With the exception of an interesting, if anachronistically feminist, excursion in Chapter 2 into Zola's attitude to women, this is a study in a very traditional mould, as befits, it might be argued, an introductory guide. The concentration on character and theme, and the tendency to retell the story (particularly evident in the long first chapter), seem to confirm that the book is aimed at a school audience, although unsupported allusions to Taine, the Nouveau Roman, and Genette's 'analepses internes' cast doubt on this. There is a worthwhile if unexpected treatment of the stage version, reflecting the author's specialist interests and raising helpful ques- tions about the difference between written and verbal dialogue, and the relationship between naturalistic stage setting and novelistic description. But the overall approach, borrowed uncritically from F. W.J. Hemmings' Emile Zola of 1953/66, is rather disappointing: more recent developments in the novel and in critical practice should have allowed Zola's attempt to write a non-psychological novel to be seen in a more fruitful perspective. Like Hemmings, the author adopts normative standards of'human interest' to condemn Zola's pseudo-scientific experimentations and pushes the unproductive line that the book is a success despite his intentions. Naturalist theory is dismissed as simply confusing and irrelevant (and relegated to a sketchy discussion in the short final chapter); Schumacher delights in catching the great man out making un- acknowledged moral judgements and psychologizing interventions. While this commonsense, demythologizing attitude is in some ways refreshing, it might have been more profitable to ask instead what pressures and conventions (social, literary, commercial?) forced Zola to compromise. Although there is a good (if somewhat derivative) treatment of recurrent themes such as the portrait and the scar, and useful material on verbal and symbolic patterning, the basic premise that it is pointless to make 'the vain effort of trying to read the novel in the light of the theory' (p. 4) precludes an unbiased analysis, such as that given by Henri Mitterand in the Garnier edition, of the alternative representational system of physiology and temperaments with which Zola seeks to replace psychology. The result is a critical stance which actively plays down Zola's innovative techniques and intentions, and loses sight of the book's extraordinary strangeness, making it seem likejust another psychological drama of the kind with which we are all familiar from television. This might be acceptably reassuring for an A-level readership, but undergraduates who adopted such a bland approach uncritically would be missing out on a lot. Overall, one is left with the feeling that an opportunity to provide a truly challenging introduction, looking at the questions Zola raises about the nature of novels rather than simply appealing to a commonsense norm, has sadly been missed. UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS ANDREW ROTHWELL L'Assommoir: A Working Woman's Life. By LILIAN R. FURST. (Twayne's Masterwork Studies) Boston, MA: G. K. Hall. I990. 129 pp. $19.95. If English readers have until recently been rather surprisingly starved of studies of L'Assommoir, they are now about to be spoilt for choice: two monographs in English, including the one reviewed here, havejust been published and a further two are said to be in preparation. Lilian Furst's contribution comes over at first glance as a highly competent, elegantly written, and attractively presented account of Zola's novel; particularly</page><page sequence="2">seductive is the reproduction on the dustjacket of Degas's Les Blanchisseuses. Expli- citly intended more for the general reader and university undergraduate than for the Zola specialist, L'Assommoir: A Working Woman's Life offers a lucid discussion of different aspects of Gervaise's story. Three (very) brief opening chapters sketch in the historical background to L'Assommoir, situate the work's originality vis-a-vis certain earlier texts, and offer a tour d'horizon of the contemporary critical reception as well as of subsequent critical approaches to Zola. A fourth chapter ('Documentation') places L'Assommoir within the nineteenth- century mimetic tradition and concisely describes, without breaking any new ground, Zola's approach to the craft of fiction, his methods of research, his use of printed sources (Poulot, Delvau, and Magnan) and the successive stages of the ebauche and writing process. There are some particularly good pages here on the organic link between documentation and fiction as well as on Zola's treatment of the theme of alcoholism. One is, however, somewhat taken aback to read that L'Assom- moir is set in Batignolles [sic, p. 23] when, at a late stage in the novel's preparation, Zola explicitly rejected this setting in favour of la Goutte d'Or, a quite different district in terms of both topographical and social specificity. It should also be pointed out that the party in Chapter 7 (not 8 as stated) is given to celebrate Gervaise's saint's day rather than her birthday. Chapter 5 ('An Experiment in Determinism') stresses the intellectual and scientific influences at work behind Zola's novel: the ideas of Lucas, of Darwin and Comte (and after him of Claude Bernard), and in particular of Taine are thus in turn lucidly outlined and their impact on Zola accurately gauged. Particularly persua- sive is Furst's discussion of the deterministic influences of environment on the principal characters, specifically of Colombe's bar and of the tenement building on the rue de la Goutte d'Or. This chapter, otherwise a happy blend of scholarship and interpretation, is unfortunately marred by a startling misreading of the Rougon- Macquart genealogy. Despite her claim that Zola's 'pictorial representation [of the family tree in Une Page d'amour] certainly makes the relationships within the family much easier to grasp' (p. 43), Furst manages to confuse Macquart (no first name: Adelaide Fouque's lover after the death of her husband Rougon) with Antoine Macquart (Adelaide's son by Macquart and Gervaise's father). As a result Gervaise is described (p. 47) as being one of'the offspring of Adelaide's liaison with Antoine Macquart' whereas she is of course the daughter of Antoine and Josephine Mac- quart and thus the granddaughter of old Adelaide Fouque. The error, which is all the more jarring given Zola's strong belief in the deterministic influence of heredity, is compounded and amplified on page 63. The best and most substantial chapter of Furst's book ('Gervaise's Choices') provides a detailed and on the whole compelling analysis of Gervaise's life story, of her rise and fall that supply the basic structure of L'Assommoir. Although one might want to quarrel with Furst's claim that 'Gervaise is certainly not an overreacher' (p. 65) (Zola's point is surely that, within the context of her environment and circumstances, the character's ambitions and ideals are in fact considerable), the analyses of the perverse blotting out of Gervaise's moral qualities in and by the environment of la Goutte d'Or, of the way in which the character is made to conform to a certain stereotype of nineteenth-century womanhood (hence the thrust of Furst's title), and of Zola's use of the food motif for both realistic and metaphorical purposes are shrewd and convincing. Without again saying anything radically new, a final chapter ('Imagination') provides an elegant demonstration of the way in which Zola's personal vision complements and eventually transcends the facticity of the documents used as a springboard; there are good analyses of, for example, the novelist's handling of free indirect discourse and of Gervaise's point of view (with some particularly pertinent Reviews 490</page><page sequence="3">Reviews pages on her changing perception of the tenement house) as well as of his anthropomorphic vision of objects. The role of recurrence and repetition within the structure of the novel is also well discussed, as is the way Zola uses the construction of individual chapters to counterpoint the overall rhythm of L'Assommoir. One regrets only the absence of any extended discussion of the novel's linguistic registers, and more particularly of their evolution, but this is perhaps a pardonable lacuna in a book intended primarily for a non-French-reading audience. A brief bibliography lists the major critical works on Zola, even if the omission ofJean Borie's Zola et les mythes comes as something of a surprise. Lilian Furst's book thus turns out in the final analysis to be a rather frustrating work of the curate's egg variety. Marred as it is by some faulty scholarship, not all of which has been grumbled about here (there are a number of smaller errors, notably in the opening chronology, and a consistent and wholly unforgivable misspelling of the name of the greatest of current Zola specialists, Henri Mitterand), it should be used with caution by the beginner, who will none the less find in it a persuasive and cogent reading of Zola's novel and most notably of its main character. UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROGER CLARK A Day in the Country and Other Stories. By GUY DE MAUPASSANT. Trans. by DAVID COWARD. (World's Classics) Oxford: Oxford University Press. I990. xxiv + 32pp. ?3.95. In Normandy, streets and schools bear witness to his native greatness. Parisian critics, however, more ambiguously lament Maupassant's enduring popularity in the English-speaking world; for this is explained in terms of our presumed fondness for the minor genre in which the writer made his reputation. David Coward's excellent translation will reinforce that appeal. The latter is likely to survive the scholarship so impressively rallied in support of the three-volume Pleiade rehabili- tation. This selection of twenty-seven stories extends from En canot ( 1876) to Le Horla (1887), and it skilfully accommodates the different registers in which Maupassant worked. The annotation provides details of the original publication of the texts concerned and elucidates contemporary allusions. There is also a select biblio- graphy, a chronological summary of Maupassant's career, and a brief appendix which includes excerpts of the views expressed by Henry James, Anatole France, and more recent commentators. Coward's introduction is a model of compression. It rightly focuses on the ways in which formal devices dramatize the writer's eclectic vision. The structure of experience chronicled in the stories is underlined by precisely those ironic twists which transform the apparently slight into the potenti- ally disturbing. From the ribald to the hallucinatory, Maupassant's telling explores a range of emotions at some distance from an unequivocal and notorious despair. As far as its biographical origins may be concerned, Coward refuses either to speculate in psychoanalytical directions or to indulge the prurient. If Coward sees Mau- passant's stories as 'the celebration of a fine contempt' (p. xix), he likens the reader to those ladies who were the victims of his practical jokes rather than of his seductive practice. The notion that he was 'pathologically discreet' in his love-affairs (p. xii) sits uneasily with Goncourt's record of Maupassant's virile exploits in public, but that 'he enjoyed masculine pursuits and feminine company, sometimes to excess' is not in doubt. There remains a profoundly unattractive side to Maupassant which implicates us in his manipulative techniques and compelling representations of passivity. 491 FITZWILLIAM COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE ROBERT LETHBRIDGE</page></plain_text>
