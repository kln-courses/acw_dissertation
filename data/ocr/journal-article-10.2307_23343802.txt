<plain_text><page sequence="1">Musical Robotics in a Loudspeaker World: Developments in Alternative Approaches to Localization and Spatialization Jim Murphy, Ajay Kapur and, Dale Carnegie ABSTRACT Musical robotics is a rapidly growing field, with dozers of new works appearing in the past half decade. This paper explores the foundations of the discipline and how, due to the ability of musical robots to serve as uniquely spatialized musical agents, it experienced a rebirth even in the face of loudspeaker technology's dominance. The growth of musical robotics is traced from its pre-computer roots through its 1970s renais sance and to contemporary installation-oriented sculptures and performance-oriented works. Major figures in the field are examined, including those who in recent years have intro duced the world to human/musi cal robot interaction in a concert setting. The paper closes with a brief speculation on the field's future, with a focus on the increasing ease with which new artists may enter the field. A jL JL. leading trend in new musical practices is to push existing boundaries, be they electronic or acoustic: New media originating during the latter part of the 19th century through the 20th century played a leading role in motivating novel compositional practices. The loudspeaker has proven deeply significant in allowing for the replication and synthe sis of sounds, resulting in many new forms of sonic expres sion. This is a large field with many avenues of analysis; in this article, however, our focus lies not on the loudspeaker but on an alternative means of automatic sound creation: that of mechanically actuated ob jects. We will examine first the rise of such objects and subsequently their current position as tools for sonic and spatial exploration. Fig. 1. A timeline of significant events in musical robotic history.

The arrival of the loudspeaker forever changed the course of technology's pursuit of musical reproduction. Prior to the loudspeaker, all acts of musical playback and performance preservation made use, by necessity, of the instruments them selves: "Automatophonic" instruments were used, capable of storing reproductions and interpretations of compositions. Fowler defines automatophonic instruments as "mechanisms that replace the human performer, but not the instrument itself' [1], Before the 1877 introduction of the phonograph, such automatophonic means of musical reproduction were the only option available for the storage and subsequent reproduc tion of sounds. However, phonographs and later loudspeaker technology created a true paradigm shift. To most listeners encountering performances in a non-live context through speaker-enabled methods of sound reproduction, music be came a form of virtual reality [2]. Not all were content with this new virtualization of music: Freire cites both John Philip Sousa and Béla Bartók as rejecting "canned" loudspeaker music in favor of live performance [3], The market for such reproductions was overwhelmingly large, and the next cen tury saw a trend toward increasing realism in audio repro ductions: Enhanced fidelity in recording and playback media was accompanied by stereophonic and, later, surround-sound recordings. We believe that, as vivid and lifelike as the record Jim Murphy (student), New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand. E-mail: &lt;jim.w.murphy@gmail.com&gt;.

We identify a small but growing stream of workers interested not in pursuing the perfection of the aforementioned virtual reality but rather in creating an alterna tive reality—a reality consisting of real world production of sounds, forgoing the loudspeaker in favor of mechatronically facilitated actuation techniques capable of truly localized sound. These creators of musical robots and other forms of kinetic mechanical sculpture share the field with a rich history of inventors and engineers who, for the last millennium, have striven to endow machines with the ability to recreate sound. After briefly examining the vast his tory of automatic musical instruments (outlined in Fig. 1), we approach the 1970s rebirth of the field, followed by a survey of work done between then and the early 2000s. Central to this history are the recent advances in the field of musical robotics, especially the large in flux of new works since Kapur's history article [4]. Before the Loudspeaker Perhaps the earliest example of an auto matic musical instrument is an automatic organ described in the 875 C.E. text "The Instrument Which Plays by Itself' [5]. Such automatic instruments subse quently arrived in Europe, with mentions there of mechanical carillons as early as the beginning of the 1200s. Later cen turies saw the development of a myriad of designs that lie outside the scope of this article. Fowler [6] and Fuller [7] highlight many of these developments, including the use of musical automata by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. These de vices typically stored data in pinned bar rels—cylinders with carefully placed pins corresponding to musical events. Recent decades have recognized the musicologi cal value of many of these archaic storage devices: Ord-Hume focuses on the pos sibility of examining the musical styles of prior eras through the analysis of pinned barrels, punched disks and other data storage techniques [8]. The Industrial Revolution was paral leled by unprecedented advances in automatic musical instruments, with the field advancing quite rapidly in the lat ter half of the 19th century [9], A criti cal change had occurred, however: No longer were these instruments chiefly boutique artisanal works; they were, like many other products affected by the Industrial Revolution, widely avail able to consumers. Indeed, according to Ord-Hume, "At the time when they were few and far between, mechanical instru ments enjoyed their closest links with the composers whose work they could inter pret so cleverly" [10]. As the technology was democratized, however, "the sheer weight of numbers diminished their mu sical importance," with musical boxes of the late 19th century suffering from "in ferior programs" [11]. The entire field of musical automata, then, set itself up for an easy demise in the face of the phono graph, which began proliferating quickly by the end of the 19th century. Nonethe less, many highly expressive automatic musical instruments were developed dur ing the last years of the 19th century: The Pianola, introduced in 1897, allowed for highly expressive control of airflow, af fording users a wide dynamic range [12]. The early 20th century marked the twilight of musical automata. Their long lifetime as the sole means by which per formances could be reproduced was rapidly eclipsed by the phonograph and subsequent loudspeaker technology. These new technologies abandoned au tomatophonic reproduction techniques in favor of emulation. As vivacious and active as the current community of mu sical roboticists may be, it is probable that never again will there be the wide distribution and pan-social significance of automatic musical instruments seen during the Industrial Revolution. The 1970s Renaissance By the 1970s, few living people in the industrialized world could remember a time before audio emulation technolo gies. The loudspeaker's domination was complete, and it had transformed the world in the process: Speakers were ubiquitous, and humanity was accus tomed to experiencing the virtual reality of recorded music played through loud speakers. The 1960s, however, saw many societal norms challenged and laid the founda tion for the 1970s renaissance of musical robotics. During the decade, collectives arose that were ready to overturn exist ing musical trends. One such collective was the Logos Foundation, founded in Ghent, Belgium, in 1968. Founder Godfried-Willem Raes cites "a desire to conquer the hierarchy of power involv Murphy, Kapur and Carnegie, Musical Robotics in a Loudspeaker World</page><page sequence="3">ing music and its producers" [13] as a motivating factor in creating the collec tive. While the Logos Foundation origi nally chose electronic instruments as the means to accomplish the above task, by 1972 it was involved in the construc tion of electronically driven mechanical sound sculptures. These sculptures were among the first kinetic sound sculptures to make use of computers, "exclusively re alised with electromagnetic components, such as relays and telephone exchange shift-registers and counters" [14]. The decision to use electronic components (shown at the base of the bell-robot Belly in Fig. 2), while logical at the dawn of the information age, is nonetheless highly sig nificant: automatic music had entered the computer age after centuries of pinned barrels, punched disks and piano rolls. Significantly, Raes describes many of his sculptures as "sound sculptures in the full sense—not real musical instruments and not playable" [15]. In dissociating his sculptures from the realm of musical instruments, Raes seems to intentionally dodge comparisons between his work and what Ord-Hume describes as the "musically devalued mass entertainment machines" of the late 19th century [16]. Such dissociation is unnecessary, how ever: As mentioned above, Ord-Hume cites the decline in automatic music as due in part to the distancing of compos ers from the increasingly mass-produced musical boxes [17]. Raes and the other workers mentioned below are composers as well as instrument builders, maintain ing an intimate connection with the mu sicality of their creations. Raes and the Logos Foundation have remained active in the field of musical robotics, continu ing to develop new sonic sculptures and methods of human/robot interaction. Another early music roboticist who continues to be a central figure in the community is sound artist Trimpin. Lozano-Hemmer perhaps sums up Trimpin's early work best by describing it as "adapting the digital to reinterpret the analog" [18]. Trimpin's close work with player-piano composer Conlon Nancar row has greatly informed his subsequent musical output, much of which combines Nancarrow's intricate pattern-based mu sic with a focus on spatialization (espe cially evident in Conloninpurple [19]). Trimpin's works, in fact, embody the re jection of the loudspeaker: Through the use of physical objects actuated mech atronically and placed throughout an installation space (see Fig. 3), he creates sonic environments impossible to du plicate through the use of loudspeaker arrays. His portfolio is quite diverse, rang Fig. 3. Trimpin's Klampen, an installation consisting of tuned clogs struck with solenoids. (© Trimpin. Photo ©Jim Murphy.) ing from entirely new instruments to ad vanced automatophonic mechanisms. We argue that Trimpin's contributions to the field are so great that, either directly or indirectly, they significantly influence the majority of subsequent work in the field of musical robotics. Mechatronic Sound Sculpture Raes and Trimpin established a rich tra dition of musical robot-based installa tion art, laying a foundation from which many subsequent artists have drawn in spiration. The previous two decades have seen much additional work done in this field. In examining the body of work in this discipline, three discrete streams of progress become evident: works making use of found objects, works consisting of purpose-built instruments and sculptures using automatophonic instruments. Longtime kinetic sculptor Gordon Monahan exemplifies many trends in the subfield of found-object musical ro botic installation art. Monahan's Multiple Machine Matrix, which debvited in 1994, contains "automated machine sculp tures built from electronic surplus and trash" [20]. Others in recent years who have explored such found-object instal lation art are Jon Pigott, with his Infinite Spring project (2011), which makes use of repurposed household items [21]; Chris Kaczmarek and his solenoid-based solar installations [22]; and, since 2007, Peter William Holden with his noise making assemblages of dolls, shoes and other objects [23]. Nicolas Collins has Murphy, Kapur and Carnegie, Musical Robotics in a Loudspeaker World</page><page sequence="4">contributed greatly to the field through his book Handmade Electronic Music [24], introducing many newcomers to the artistic potential of everyday objects. Ki netic sound artists often find motivation in exploring the sounds produced by found objects [25], allowing installation visitors to meditate on timbres produced by items that in other contexts would be tuned out or otherwise disregarded. The DIY aesthetic embraced by many in this subfield, explored by Ramocki [26], has much promise as society produces ever more electromechanical refuse. Rather than let such objects languish in landfills, the above artists take it upon themselves to convert them into musical artworks, perhaps increasing audience awareness of the reusability of such objects. Quite different from those working with electronic surplus and trash are those who create purpose-built noise makers. Exemplifying this movement are Switzerland-based artists Zimoun and Pe Lang. Lang and Zimoun fill gallery spaces with works often consisting "of a large number of small DC motors driving a sound emitting mechanism . . . placed at equal distances in a space, covering one wall or even all the walls and ceil ing of a room" [27]. Zimoun, honored at the 2010 Prix Ars Electrónica, contin ues to experiment with alternate actua tion methods including pneumatic and biological systems. Zimoun's and Lang's works have much in common with those of other artists who create their own instruments: Many such works involve reductionist sculptures that pare sound making elements down to their pure forms (see Fig. 4). Artist Arcangelo Sas solino's works, for example, involve low parts-count, custom-built components arranged to obviate their function as noisemakers [28]. Such utilitarian work forces visitors to focus on the sound be ing produced. A third subfield of installation artists creates automatophonic sculpture con sisting of augmented preexisting instru ments. While many in the field at large have experimented with augmenting in struments, a significant number of instal lation artists have made it their focus in recent years. Pepe Segui's Mechanical Or chestra of Franca Xica is a complex exam ple of such work, combining a wide array of drums and other noisemakers with a pneumatic control system to form an in terconnected web of altered instruments [29]. Other prominent artists who focus on converting real-world instruments to robotic installation pieces are Ujino Mu neteru and Felix Thorn. These two artists demonstrate the highly diverse aesthetics Fig. 4. Zimoun's 361 Prepared DC Motors, filler zvire 1.0mm, 2009. Videos of Zimoun's work can be viewed at &lt;zimoun.ch&gt;. (© Zimoun) possible even within this specific subfield of robotic music: Whereas Thorn's ma chines consist of natural wood and pos sess a craft-like quality, Muneteru's works are brightly colored and chaotic [30]. While the three aforementioned sub fields of robotic kinetic art have differing visual and sonic aesthetics, many artists in these seemingly disparate fields seem to be motivated by a desire for a more complete exploration of the sonic char acteristics of objects and space than can be afforded by traditional loudspeaker setups. Monahan describes his work as a "network of computer-controlled kinetic devices . . . capable of moving complex layers of acoustically produced sound in physical space" [31]. Such a focus on acoustic sounds in space is shared by Zi moun, who creates works that have been described as an intersection of sound and space [32]. Trimpin's works, as shown in [33], including Sheng High and Conlonin purple, immerse visitors in spaces filled with objects radiating sound. The tech nological state of the art presents workers with further opportunities to create sonic architectures composed of real-world sounds: Artists continue to exploit tech nological advances in order to further explore the possibilities of spatialization. A large number of robotic installa tions have appeared since Kapur's afore mentioned article [34]. This influx of artworks could be due to several factors. The increasing use of social networking and video hosting sites allows for interna tional exposure of what otherwise would have been regionally isolated works. Many such works are not academic in nature and would reach few people in die absence of such Internet resources. This increase of works in recent years can also be attributed to easy-to-use physical computing environments such as Arduino. Arduino and similar systems readily afford non-engineers the ability to explore mechatronic systems, allow ing relatively untrained artists to create musical robotic works. As such devices become ever more simple to use, we an ticipate further increases in the field of musical robotic installation art. The New Wave of Robotic Music Performance Although Trimpin and Raes paved the way for much subsequent progress in the subfield of performance-oriented musi cal robotics, it was not until the late 1990s that a new generation of musician-sculp tors began to build upon their earlier works. Although active work had contin ued in the field of robotic installation art and in the field of musical applications of more purely research-oriented robotics (such as that described by Roads [35]), it was not until the mid-1990s thathaptics researchers began to use robotic technol ogy to create mechatronic musical per formance interfaces [36]. Non-academic artists in the 1990s also saw the potential of robotics to create engaging perfor mances [37], Nicolas Anatol Baginsky's The Three Sirens [38] (Fig. 5) debuted in 1992 and was perhaps the most techno logically progressive and musically ex pressive robotic performance ensemble of the 1990s. The 2000s, however, mark Murphy, Kapur and Carnegie, Musical Robotics in a Loudspeaker World</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 5. Nicolas Anatol Baginsky's 1992 Aglaopheme, guitarist in the Three Sirens robot band. (© Nicolas Baginsky) the formation of three distinct schools of robotic music performance: robotic automatophonic performance, human robot interaction, and world music oriented robotics. While many of the art ists discussed below work in more than one of the aforementioned subfields, we have chosen to identify workers who have defined and focused on robot-oriented performance. Eric Singer, founder of the League of Musical Urban Robotics (LEMUR), be gan creating musical robotics in 2000. His works focus on augmented instru ments (as in LEMUR's 2008 Gamelatron [39]) and new instruments inspired by existing designs. Actively interested in exploring the applications of musi cal robotics in many genres, Singer has collaborated with a variety of musicians ranging from electroacoustic composer Morton Subotnick to pop group They Might Be Giants [40]. Such perfor mances range from emulating the feel of "a surreal carnival act" to examples of "powerful man-machine rapport" [41]. Such man-machine rapport is seldom noted during performances involving musicians playing against a traditional loudspeaker-driven backing track, indi cating that critics and audiences clearly place musical robotic performance in a category distinct from loudspeaker mediated performance. Such a separa tion in the minds of audiences and crit ics highlights a major difference between the robot and the loudspeaker: Robots onstage serve as tangible musical agents and as such appear potentially more like an instrument or band member than a closed box from which noise emanates. The above works have culminated re cently in Singer's most ambitious project to date: In 2010, he collaborated in the design and construction of the Orches trion, a robotic ensemble that toured with guitarist Pat Metheny. This tour was the most extensive and publicized live robotic performance event to date. It featured musical robots and garnered much mainstream media attention. Singer's work has done much to increase the exposure of musical robotics to the public at large. Aside from being a char ismatic promoter of the field, however, Singer is also an accomplished engineer who leads his teams to create automatic instruments that possess a high degree of precision [42] (Fig. 6). Through its interdisciplinary focus on both the artis tic and technological aspects of the field, Singer's work can perhaps be viewed as epitomizing high-tech art according to the definition put forth by Popper [43]: Through his use of technology, Singer's works highlight technology's place in modern urbanized environments. As mentioned above, musicologists realize value in antiquated automatic in struments through their ability to store and reproduce music otherwise lost to time. Ajay Kapur continues this tradition, applying it to world music forms. His MahaDeviBot (Fig. 7), GanaPatiBot and Notomoton are designed in part to serve as pedagogic and performance tools for the preservation and promotion of North Indian Classical Music [44]. Kapur also created the Machine Orchestra, a large-scale performance with a focus on human-robot interaction in world music forms. There are notable precedents for human/machine ensembles, such as Sergi Jordä's 2002 Afasia ensemble [45] and Stifters Dinge, a 2007 mechani cal opera by Heiner Goebbels [46], but the Machine Orchestra represents the largest synthesis of musicians and ro bots to date. In the Machine Orchestra, Kapur's array of robots improvise and perform with accomplished world and electronic musicians. Through their work in the Machine Orchestra, Kapur and collaborators have explored numer ous challenges specific to networked en semble-based performance, focusing on research in the minimization of latency in the live electronic music context [47]. Inspired by the large degree of spatial ization afforded by the multi-channel speaker arrays utilized in Princeton's Laptop Orchestra [48], Kapur chose to increase spatialization's significance in musical robot performance contexts, go ing so far as to place robotic components throughout the audience space, allowing concertgoers to become immersed in lo calized sound. Focusing on improving machine musi cianship and human/robot interaction, Gil Weinberg has amassed an array of technically impressive musical robots. Weinberg's robot Haile [49] allows for direct interaction between a performer and an anthropomorphic drumming ro bot. Further, Shimon, a robotic marimba [50], explores a variety of means by which humans can influence the robot's output. This focus on allowing users to perform with highly responsive robots points toward future work wherein ever increasing degrees of artificial intelli gence will be applied to musical robot systems, outlined by Driscoll and Wein berg [51]. Given his position as the di rector of music technology at prominent research institution Georgia Tech, Wein berg's focus on musical robotics prom ises to contribute greatly to the technical aptitude of such systems. Weinberg, Singer and Kapur have col lectively done much to reinvigorate the subfield of musical robot performance during the first decade of the 2000s. Several new artists have emerged after Murphy, Kapur and Carnegie, Musical Robotics in a Loudspeaker World</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 6. Eric Singer's GuitarBot, 2003. (© Eric Singer. Photo © Carly McCoy.) them, also focusing on robotic perfor mance. Notably, robotically augmented world music performance has seen much growth in recent years: Patrick Flana gan and his JAZARI African percussion ensemble make use of a wide array of automatophonic instruments coupled with a modified game controller as a performer interface. Flanagan interacts with the JAZARI robots through gestural expressions created with the controller, creating rhythmic patterns that would prove impossible in traditional musical contexts. Flanagan explained his live per formance explorations in a 2011 TEDx talk: When I press a button on this control ler, a solenoid hits a drum. If I hold the button down, the solenoid hits the drum repeatedly. How fast the solenoid hits the drum depends on the rotation of the controller, and how hard the solenoid hits the drum depends on the angle of the controller. In total, these controls allow me to play rhythms that would be impossible for me to play in the normal way and in some cases impossible for any human to play [52]. Other groups using modern technol ogy to aid musical robotic performance are the Edinburgh-based Cybraphon [53], which juxtaposes found objects with classical Indian instruments, and Ivan Monsao and Paulo Libonati, who augmented a traditional Brazilian berim bau with mechatronic components [54]. If the past decade is any indication, ro botic musical performance and world musical instruments will likely have a long and fruitful future together. Recent years have seen other proj ects aimed at exploring and improving robot-mediated performance of popular music. Greg Locke, likely inspired by ro bot band CAPTURED! BY ROBOTS, in 2008 created the Trons, a whimsical New Zealand-based robotic rock band known for its performances in clubs and other non-academic venues [55]. Acts such as CAPTURED! BY ROBOTS and the Trons perhaps indicate a future wherein rock music performance and musical robotics are not mutually exclusive terms. Such acts, coupled with Trimpin's IF VI WAS IX, a large-scale rock music-oriented sculpture in Seattle's Experience Music Project [56], have exposed to robotic musical sculpture many who would oth erwise likely have remained unaware of the field. Several academic projects over the last decade have put forth novel approaches to robotic music performance. Of note is Michael A. Fabio's Chandelier [57], a de Fig. 7. Ajay Kapur's MahaDeviBot in con cert with the KarmetiK Machine Orchestra, 2010. (© AjayKapur. Photo © Jim Murphy.) Murphy, Kapur and Carnegie, Musical Robotics in a Loudspeaker World</page><page sequence="7">sign heavily inspired by Yamaha's mech atronic Disklavier player pianos. Unlike many of the aforementioned robotic performance ensembles, Fabio's Chan delier is more evocative of a traditional instrument: A performer sits directly in front of an array of motors, solenoids and strings, interacting with these com ponents through an 88-key keyboard. Academic settings have also given birth to markedly less-traditional approaches to musical robotic performance: Carn egie Mellon University's Roborchestra [58], founded in 2005, explores inter esting approaches to instrument design. The Roborchestra's current centerpiece is the Vibratron, an instrument played by metal balls dropping rhythmically onto tuned surfaces. Led by experienced mu sical roboticist Roger Dannenberg [59], this undergraduate club continues to produce inventive and musically capable performance systems which utilize a vari ety of algorithmic and generative compo sitional techniques. Further interesting academic perfor mance-oriented work has arisen from Steven Kemper, Troy Rogers, Scott Bar ton and their Expressive Machines proj ect, founded in 2007 [60]. Expressive Machines notably secured much of their funding from the crowdsourcing web site Kickstarter, indicating the existence of much potential interest in robotic instruments among the diverse users of the site. As is the case with the increased num ber of musical robotic installations men tioned above, recent years have seen a growth in the number of robotic perfor mance groups. As with installation work, this could be attributed to dissemination via the Internet as well as easy-to-use mi crocontroller environments. Addition ally, high-profile performances such as Singer's Orchestrion with Pat Metheny have shed much light on the field. The Future With the field of musical robotics becom ing ever easier to explore, as evidenced by the availability of kits such as Carlyn Maw's mechatronic sculpture package [61], it appears evident that more artists will explore musical robotics in the com ing years. In spite of the increase in expo sure in recent years, many aspects of the field remain ripe for innovation: Closed loop control systems for robotic strings, percussion and wind instruments are implemented in few performance and installation setups. A particularly interest ing subfield of kinetic sound art that has begun to emerge in recent years is that of biologically and chemically inspired and affected systems, such as those ex plored byjacques Remus [62] and Philip Beesley [63]. Furthermore, advances in rapid prototyping technology [64] have the potential to play a significant role in the design and manufacture of custom parts for musical robotic systems. Addi tionally, wireless mesh networks, such as those defined by Zigbee Series Two, promise musical roboticists the ability to more rapidly deploy unconventional configurations. While it seems unlikely that mecha tronic musical systems will ever in any real sense compete with ubiquitous multi channel speaker arrays, there can be no doubt that for artists and composers interested in exploring localization and spatialization in manners not afforded by loudspeakers, musical robotic systems will continue to be a means by which new music and sounds can be explored. Some of those interested in alternative approaches to the creation of acoustic sounds will continue to turn to mecha tronic systems as a means of exploring timbre, space and localization of sound.
