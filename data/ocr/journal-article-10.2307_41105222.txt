<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oliveira Martins: The Spectres in his Historiography LUÍS DE SOUSA REBELO (Translated by Lucy Phillips) In his historical narrative, Oliveira Martins consciously distances himself from the mould established by the genre of the chronicle, which was held in high esteem by the medieval tradition which dated back to the record-keeping of ancient annals, and because of the importance which it acquired during the Age of Discoveries, that is the sixteenth century, as well as for some considerable time afterwards. At the same time as he rejected the old cannons however, he managed, within this narrative nonconformity and autonomy, to retain the emotional qualities, the rhetorical formalization and the mnemonic figures of speech typical of the innate structure of the discourse in question. Alexandre Herculano published his História de Portugal, 1846-53, setting out the foundations of modern historiography. Oliveira Martins who, like all intellectuals of his generation, held the 'MestreY work in very high regard, set out to follow the new path. But whereas Herculano used his fiction to try to explore and capture the emotions and psychologi- cal traits of actors on the historical stage, when Oliveira Martins had no record or documentary proof of the way in which such actors thought and acted in determined circumstances and situations, he sought to intuit their sentiments and to integrate them in the overall vision of his narrative. He therefore adapted to the convention followed by the ancient chroni- clers who, when they weren't simply exalting their deeds and virtues in the tradition of the panegyric, would paint a portrait of princes and those courtiers whose role on the political stage made them worthy of attention. Herculano relied solidly on documentary evidence and avoided filling in historical gaps and silences with his intuitions and conjectures. His exploration of what we would today call the political imaginary was confined to an artistic approach within the genre of the historical novel, and this methodological dichotomy differentiated his work as researcher and artist. Oliveira Martins, for whom history was drama, had a different approach. He took all these diverse ingredients, weighed up the tempera- ments and urges of his actors, the situation in which they found them- selves, whether by chance or by their own hand, the extent of pressure of events upon them and, in one particular event, he would uncover an essential significance that would shed light on the entire historical</page><page sequence="2">OLIVEIRA MARTINS: SPECTRES IN HIS HISTORIOGRAPHY IO9 process. Aware of the interests, anxieties and expectations of his readers, deeply committed to forming a public opinion in keeping with the needs of a new middle class, Oliveira Martins launched the Biblioteca das Ciências Sociais. Aimed at providing a theoretical background that would enable the reader to understand the evolutionary process of the history of civilization, the Biblioteca? s goal was to educate the reader, and to give him or her the appropriate means to understand the great philosophical and political questions of the time. The series was not just aimed at the everyday reader, however, but also at secondary school students, although for these readers the author had to rewrite his História de Portugal in a more appropriate style. This pedagogical preoccupation, allied with the desire to be able to influence great swathes of the educated population, led Oliveira Martins to develop a skill in discourse and a new rhetoric with increased persuasive powers. He wanted to convince his readers, to show them his vision of the state of the nation and the factors which at a time of radical changes in Western Europe, had led it to its precarious economic and moral situation, namely in relation to the whole colonial issue. Far from simply presenting a descriptive analysis of the social problems of his time, Oliveira Martins tried to outline the process which had led to the crisis in Portuguese society during the 1870s and 1880s. In the same year, 1879, he published História da Civilização Ibérica and História de Portugal. These two works were an integral part of his Biblioteca das Ciências Sociais project, and from a hermeneutical point of view it is only worth studying them together which, because of a tendency to consider them separately, though related by the common nature of their themes, has rarely been done. Oliveira Martins himself emphasized more than once the need to see História da Civilização Ibérica and História de Portugal as a diptych, part of a vast work he had designed, in a spirit of scientific divulgation, portraying the formation of modern states in the peninsula from the beginnings of the history of civilization during Roman colonization to his own time. Oliveira Martins maintains a direct contact with the reader, frequently interrupting the thread of his narrative to make a commentary and expound the reasons behind his method, in order to show the reader the meaning of evenemental history, to underline the importance of certain events and how they can form an intelligible structure. In an intuitive approach, he attempts to apprehend the specific character and char- acteristics of the various communities that inhabit the Iberian peninsula, considering them as important in themselves. Thus he seeks to deduce the evolutionary process which shaped them and establishes the various categories of factors present in their origin. Shifting his perspective constantly, he divides the evolution of a civilization into three major</page><page sequence="3">HO LUÍS DE SOUSA REBELO cycles. In the first natural phenomena predominate: movements of races and peoples, the formation of languages and of juridical and religious symbols; in the second, social phenomena dominate: the development of institutions, encounters between classes and class struggle. In the third, finally, moral phenomena take the lead: the conscious definition of the ideas to which all forms of intellectual activity are subordinate and with which juridical and economic theories are formed.1 This method, described in História da Civilização Ibérica, is used by Martins not only in this work but also in his other historical narratives, namely Historia da República Romana and Historia de Portugal. And it reveals a specific area of study and direction which he had adopted across the board for the Biblioteca das Ciencias Sociais. After a punc- tillious examination of the facts, Oliveira Martins integrates them into the structural plane of his narrative, presenting a coherent picture of the func- tioning of a modern nation. This is the moment in which the historical actors enter the scene. Kings, warriors, saints, priests and poets, portrayed in tones which owe much to Thomas Carlyle's vision of the individual as historical hero, take the place assigned to them on the stage and voice the thought and the action which events dictate. They participate in the historical process and are an integral part of it - they are characters whose actions, frequently, transcend them. They are, precisely because of this, the makers of a society undergoing a process of organic growth. This period of growth began with the beginnings of civilization and reached maturity between the fifteenth and sixteenth century. Perceived in only a vague way at first, the role of medieval institutions was still confused in people's minds with the projection of collective desires. Fore- seeing and anticipating the reality of the unconscious, Oliveira Martins describes this period as an era of darkness in which worlds are shaken, the 'seio de um paúl onde fermenta a vida', and from which the creative forces of nature erupt, producing ingenuous types who are nonetheless ephemeral in their beauty, such as El Cid, or institutions inspired by Christian solidarity such as the hermandades (brotherhoods) or behetrías (a kind of voluntary feudal contract in which peasants chose their lord).2 This period was followed by new phases of development until the social organism - a metaphor taken from the writings of Herbert Spencer who, in turn, had taken it from Aristotle - achieves its fullest expression during the reign of the Catholic kings: Fernando and Isabel in Spain, and Dom João II and Dom João III in Portugal. The overseas expansion of the Iberian countries which followed ushered in a long and drawn out decline, which was temporarily halted by strong personalities: Felipe II in Spain 1 Oliveira Martins, História da Civilização Ibérica (Lisbon: Guimarães, 1972), p. 278. ¿ Historia da Civilização Iberica, p. 229.</page><page sequence="4">OLIVEIRA MARTINS: SPECTRES IN HIS HISTORIOGRAPHY III and Dom João III in Portugal, their reigns being followed by a period of disorganization and deterioration. This is the theme which dominates in Oliveira Martins's work, an unavoidable idea which he explores in depth in his analysis of Portuguese history and society. Because of this, his history cannot be approached in the rigorous and scientific sense of the term as the work of an historian, but rather as essays which, from a socio-philosophical perspective, inter- pret human societies over the centuries, with particular emphasis on the Iberian peninsula, and with the aim of finding in these investigations of the past a path, a direction which would allow his contemporaries to wrench the region from the mire of underdevelopment in which it had sunk. Necessarily, and according to such an approach, Oliveira Martins's vision of events had to be sombre and even pessimistic. Indeed, the way that Oliveira Martins distinguishes affinities and contrasts between the Spanish and Portuguese temperaments, or between the character of one nation and the other, is often imprecise and even obscure. It is in reality difficult to understand how Spanish overseas expansion could be classified as a drama which was 'ao mesmo tempo bufo e trágico', whilst on the other hand the maritime adventures of the Portuguese had the gravity of great tragedy and the harshness tempered by sadness which tragedy imposes with greater intensity and depth.3 Hernán Cortés, Francisco Pizarro, D. João de Castro and Afonso de Albuquerque were cruel warriors, harsh and ruthless leaders, it being morally pointless to assess the degree of cruelty which distinguished them and which depended on the difficulty of the circumstances they had to confront. Equally imprecise and badly defined is the distinction which Oliveira Martins found between what he understands as dramatic action in the history of Spain and tragedy in the history of Portugal. For him the sense of tragedy entailed an understanding of the dogma 'da Ordem universal no espírito dos homens e a existência de uma Justiça absoluta, expressa por via das acções e das virtudes humanas. Foi este o dogma que os teólogos jesuítas fizeram aceitar no Concílio de Trento'.4 However, if it is true that the conflict between empirical reality and the ideal which regulates human intentions, between theory and practice, constitutes the material which makes up great tragedy, the truth is that it is impos- sible to disentangle drama from tragedy when the deeds of Spaniards and Portuguese are compared. Inspired by the idea of universal order and the sense of absolute justice associated with it, both of them behave in a fashion which Oliveira Martins prefers to illustrate than have to explain. 3 História da Civilização Ibérica, p. 270. Historia da Civilização Ibérica, pp. 274-75.</page><page sequence="5">112 LUÍS DE SOUSA REBELO The distinction between kind is, therefore, badly posed and does not support this classification criterion. The role of the actors and their action on stage combine, however, to offer a performance that, in both cases, has a genuinely tragic character. The characters show attributes which are those of the very society from which they come and which they, for their part, attempt to shape according to their own desires. And in the nature of their actions their temperament is revealed. Now this narrative technique, just like the Plutarchian portrait or medallion, the oratorical intervention by a character, the authorial gloss or commentary, the descriptive depiction of a scene, comes from the genre of the chronicle. It is clearly identified with the epideictic genre. The average reader was already very familiar with this genre, thus aiding communication between author and reader and making the reader more sensitive to the content of a new message which was conveyed to him or her via already familiar forms. Furthermore, though a subtle shift in the topology of the historio- graphical discourse he had inherited from the chronicle, Oliveira Martins transmitted to the reader a new vision of the territory and its inhabitants. Praise of the land, its beauty and great attributes, the fertile abundance of its soil and riches, was a dominant topic in medieval and renaissance chronicles. This had its origins in a passage from Pliny the Elder, who had praised the Italian land - 'Haec est Italia dis sacra, terra numine deum electa' - and served growing nationalism in Renaissance Europe well. At the time at which Oliveira Martins was writing this was nothing more than an obsolete cliché. Yet Martins completely transformed its function, on describing with chorographic precision the Portuguese territory which was to be the setting for his historical drama. He was wise enough, how- ever, to retain in his description the emotional qualities of the ancient topos, conveyed through his metaphorical style, as this passage from Historia de Portugal shows: Erguido em frente do mar como um anfiteatro cujos primeiros degraus as ondas constantemente aspergem, o território português, independente, adquiriu desta localização um carácter seu [. . .] Assim como, porém, as cristas das montanhas, e, pelo coração dos vales, o curso dos nossos rios, são as veias e os tendões que nos ligam ao corpo peninsular: assim também no nosso sangue os primitivos elementos acusam o facto de uma origem e de uma raça irmã.5 By using the verb 'aspergir' to describe the movement of the waves which lap at the Lusitanian coast, Oliveira Martins evokes connotations which suggest a sacred ritual, the making sacred of a destiny which 5 Oliveira Martins, História de Portugal, critical edition with an introduction by Isabel de Faria e Albuquerque (Lisbon: Imprensa Nacional - Casa da Moeda, 1988), Book I, Chap. Ill, p. 25.</page><page sequence="6">OLIVEIRA MARTINS: SPECTRES IN HIS HISTORIOGRAPHY II3 predetermines the future of the earth and its peoples. This idea is reiter- ated in the anthropomorphic imagery which follows, lending the picture a dramatic sublimeness, in which the human element and the idea of one's native land are fused in a secret appeal to the course of a shared adventure. This rhetoric was highly effective since it exercised its fascination over the sum of the implied reader's received ideas and sentiments, without in any way breaking the pact which linked the author to his reader. And it fell within the cultural horizon of the reader and his or her repertoire, basing itself on the form of a well known hidden subtext which developed into a new portrayal of historical events. Inspired by the scientific spirit of the century, this new approach was immediately acceptable to a public which received it in a textual format which did not substantially differ from that familiar from traditional historical discourse. Oliveira Martins presented the reader with a greater challenge when he chose the organic model of society as a means of interpreting the vicissitudes of the flock. By identifying the constituent ingredients of the chronicle, which the author had used and transformed for his own ends, we are able to comprehend the exceptionally persuasive power of his narrative. Yet we have still to examine the validity of his argumentation when the model of the organic society raises certain problems in relation to the emergence of the Iberian nations. The idea of growth, maturity and decline, implicit in any metaphor of a vitalist nature, though adequate to illustrate the social and economic situ- ation of nineteenth-century Portugal, had to be developed in order to show a way out of the depression in which the country found itself and thus lead to the renaissance and regeneration of the moribund society. The elements which could unleash this revitalization formed an intrin- sic part of society itself and they had to have the strength which would allow them to be truly effective. For Oliveira Martins, the Roman institu- tions and, unwillingly, the invasions and government of successive aris- tocracies, had laid down the roots of a democratic tradition which was not just Iberian, which incited the new states to reject both the federal and the aristocratic solution. Federalism was countered by the Visigothic monarchical tradition with its elective principle and the power of the aristocracy was eliminated by its coexistence with the municipal system. The decisive factor was still the intervention of the crown in conflicts of interest between different social orders. It was a characteristic of the Iberian peninsula in the fifteenth century that the crown simultaneously attacked the nobility, the bourgeoisie and the clergy, aiming particularly at their feudal and aristocratic privileges, their military power and their wealth.</page><page sequence="7">114 LUÍS DE SOUSA REBELO In this brief analysis of political events, Oliveira Martins offers us a simplistic picture of a complex situation. He ignores the existence of a social class with a specific weight, however relative that might have been: that is the labourers, the working people of the ancient medieval classification, the peasants and the urban workers, the artisans and the mesteirais (skilled servants). At no point does he attribute them with any significant role in the unfolding of his historical drama. Let us look at an example by briefly considering the Comunero revolt of 1 516. This movement aimed to maintain the foros or fueros, the privi- leges which had been obtained as a concession from the crown - this aspect being underlined by Oliveira Martins.6 However, in his opinion, the insurrection obeyed other motives. It was not directed, as might seem to be the case, against the central power of the crown but rather against the presence of foreign troops on Spanish territory. The insurrection was driven by the spirit of national independence. The message which it sent to Carlos V was very clear: he should govern Spain not as an emperor who resided outside the kingdom, but as a Spanish king. This was a warning that Carlos V was wise enough to heed when he chose Spain as his royal seat. For Oliveira Martins, nationalism had been the major factor in the Comunero revolt. This allowed him to still recognise the organic maturity of the society that was affirmed in the institutional form of the monarchical state. Looking at the situation from another angle, it can be seen that Oliveira Martins examines the Comunero revolt in the light of events relating to the dynastic crisis which, in Portugal, lasted 1383-85. For Martins, the inhabitants of Lisbon and Porto, and subsequently those of the whole country, allowed themselves to be carried away by patriotism in their revolt against the queen regent, Dona Leonor, who had been imposed by the treaties with Spain. In the Mestre de Avis these people found their leader and Messiah. For the historian, this was the important feature to highlight in the urban insurrection and the uprisings which followed in the surrounding countryside and to some extent throughout the country. He therefore failed to capture all the complexities of the social situation of 1383. The uprising of the peasants, of the masses, of the urban throng, the participation of the mesteirais in Lisbon, the assault of the villeins on the noblemen in their castles, the demand of the masses for the abolition of unpopular taxes, all those aspects minutely detailed by Fernão Lopes in his chronicles - Oliveira Martins's main source - disappeared completely from his account of the crisis in História de Portugal. Furthermore, he remained completely indifferent to the messianic expectations that revolved around Carlos V and the effects 6 História da Civilização Ibérica, pp. 212-16.</page><page sequence="8">OLIVEIRA MARTINS: SPECTRES IN HIS HISTORIOGRAPHY II5 which these expectations might exercise over the Comuneros. Oliveira Martins only noted a positive link, that of nationalism. Now, while no one would dispute that, in the case of the Portuguese 'revolution', there was an incipient nationalist sentiment that was affirmed during the Spanish invasion, it is also true that the old ties of vassalage, common to feudal society, were still very strong and took precedence over all others in the case of a conflict of interest. It is true that the people of Lisbon gave their complete support to the conspiracy hatched against Dona Leonor and Andeiro, taking the Mestre de Avis as their leader and saviour. However, on the political stage this is but a backdrop; it is as if they were extras waiting to be given their 'cue' in order to enter the stage at the great and crucial moments of history. In the perspective adopted by Oliveira Martins, this position is justified. The leaders manipulated the political situation, with Álvaro Pais to the fore- front, inciting the people to take to the street. Oliveira Martins's account of the Lisbon uprising sets the tone for the way that he assesses the crisis as a whole. In his opinion, those in command, the leaders, embody the country's soul - that mysterious spirit which emanates from the commu- nity as a whole. The more effective they are, the greater their charisma and vice versa. And those in command, the leaders, are far more worthy of the historian's attention than the people, in clear contrast to Fernão Lopes's approach, in which leaders, kings, governors appear to be joined in a mystical union with the body of the nation. Underlying this relationship is the idea of a consensus or tacit agree- ment between ruler and subject - a pact which guarantees the cohesion of the social community. It is the hypothesis of a primitive contract 'pelo qual a reunião dos homens se constitui em sociedade segundo o direito', put forward by Grotius and welcomed by Oliveira Martins in his Teoria de Socialismo,7 However, the leaders, the rulers, are distinguished by their will. They dominate situations, lead the community and take advantage of political opportunities in order to satisfy their personal ambitions. Afonso Henriques, the founder of Portugal, is portrayed as a warrior, highwayman and adventurer, a man without scruples, consumed by the absolutist envy he had for the Spanish court. Step by step, he broke the chains of vassalic obedience which linked him to his cousin, the emperor Afonso VII. On breaking the contract which had preserved and main- tained the political unity of Spain, Afonso Henriques brought original sin to the birth of the nation. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the ancient myths and legends pertaining to Portugal's origins which are narrated by Oliveira Martins. It is certainly the case that, as the author claims, these myths exude the imaginary of medieval Portugal. However, 7 Oliveira Martins, Teoria do Socialismo (Lisbon, Guimarães, 1974), pp. 43-44.</page><page sequence="9">Il6 LUÍS DE SOUSA REBELO on including them in and making them part of his narrative, they become an integral part of his historical argument. Proof of this can be found in the episode of the imprisonment of Dona Teresa by Afonso Henriques, after the battle of Guimarães.8 Ancient sources state that Dona Teresa cursed her son, threatening him with future disasters. When he later broke his legs in Badajoz, the incident was seen as the fulfilment of the anathema. Biblical and traditional law laid down that if a son raised his hand against his progenitors, he would be severely punished. However, rather than illustrating an act of justice relating to a serious crime, the episode reveals an implacable leader who infringes natural law and a political contract in order to satisfy his ambition. Oliveira Martins seems to have hesitated with respect to determining the meaning and importance of this episode, since after the second episode he eliminated it completely from História de Portugal. Oral narratives, legends, were for him as important as the documents of the royal chancel- leries, since they conveyed the sentiments and the imaginary of ordinary people, offering us their version of history. However, if this preoccupation thus renders his history much more comprehensive and capable of show- ing us the sensibility and the inventiveness of the masses and even their vision of events, he does not go so far as to allow himself to assess the political effects and the causes of this participation in social reality. Most of the time, 'the people' follow their leaders for emotional reasons and Oliveira Martins's narrative shies away from analysing their motives in depth, incapable of transcending the limitations of his own sources. Let us look at the case of Dom Pedro I. Portrayed by Oliveira Martins as a 'tyrant', Dom Pedro was loved by the people. Yet it was precisely his erratic behaviour, his passions and obsessions which made him loved since, to a certain extent, his anxieties and morbidness were perceived as being those of the population itself. On the other hand, Oliveira Martins was careful to show the process by which ordinary people gained their privileges and rights both in the courts and through the various forms of local government inherited from Roman institutions. Thus tempera- mental quirks did not interfere with the activities of civic life. And, in the sixteenth century, it could be said that a form of representative system already existed, whatever its limitations might be. This whole social fabric was then put severely to the test. Maritime exploration made way for expansion and Portugal created an Eastern empire in the image of its domestic institutions. The result in Oliveira Martins's opinion was an antiquated form of colonization and a literature of Neo Latin inspiration. It would not be difficult today to refute some of 8 História de Portugal, p. 51.</page><page sequence="10">OLIVEIRA MARTINS: SPECTRES IN HIS HISTORIOGRAPHY II7 these allegations, pointing to the success of certain solutions found in the Portuguese colonies and the originality, in the sense in which that should be understood, of Portuguese literature of the Renaissance. However the primordial concern of the historian in this case was the relationship of the oligarchy with the people, in the broadest sense of the word, while the gulf that existed between them grew ever wider. The Portuguese and Spanish monarchies, in contrast to those of Central Europe in the Middle Ages, did not secularize the state, but rather associated themselves with Rome and the Inquisition, creating a system which repressed the individual and distanced the crown from its subjects. The disasters of the empire and the loss of national independence generated a myth, that of Sebastianism, which united great swathes of society in a single desire. The belief in a saviour or in the return of the dead or disappeared king Dom Sebastião (the idea came to Oliveira Martins from his readings of Renan on the Celtic races), constituted within Oliveira Martins's thought the point which could unite the masses with the ruling oligarchy. Now, in his analyses of this phenomenon and in his study of the introduction of constitutionalism into Portugal, Oliveira Martins has great difficulty in defining his concept of 'the people', although, at times, this can be understood (as was frequently the case in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance) as all those who were not aristocrats, royalty or the ruling oligarchy. Indeed the term 'the people' has different semantic connotations within his historical discourse. When he refers, as he does in História de Portugal, to those who imitate French ideas in literature or politics and presents them, in the constitutionalist fashion, as 'the people', he is referring to the urban population, the middle class.9 In other contexts, 'the people' encompasses the peasants or, in a broader sense 'the illiterate masses'. He applies the term equally to artisans and working people in general in his interpretative surveys, without the sociological precision which the different contexts demand, being guided sometimes by economic and sometimes by political criteria, or by both simultaneously and in the same passage. However, no one tried harder than Oliveira Martins to capture the reality of a concept with many different meanings, something which he occasionally and partially managed to achieve. Less frequently he uses the word 'plebe' to refer to the masses, the populace, the mob, so often seen as having an aggressive and restless disposition. In his study of the concept through the ages, such as in his Teoria do Socialismo, he reproduces a portrait of the people painted by a Spanish writer of the seventeenth century: 9 História de Portugal, pp. 879-80.</page><page sequence="11">Il8 LUÍS DE SOUSA REBELO A sua natureza é monstruosa em tudo, desigual a si mesma, inconstante e vária. Governa-se pelas aparências sem penetrar no fundo. É pobre de meios e de ideias; não sabe discernir o falso do verdadeiro.10 The account continues in the same vein, painting a progressively blacker picture of the monster. This was truly anachronistic at the end of the Rennaissance, since the idea of 'the people' used here is still that of the massa damnata of Saint Augustine. In relation to this line of thought, Oliveira Martins's judgement wavers, he does not share the idea of the social contract espoused by Rousseau, for whom all those who make up society: 'Prennent collectivement le nom de peuple, et s'appellent en particulier citoyens, comme participant à l'autorité souveraine, et sujets comme soumis aux lois de l'Etat'.11 None of these precepts has, in his political thought, anything to do with Oliveira Martins's idea of 'the people' or with the emergence of national communities when these are, in his opinion, created by an act of will, even if this is with the tacit consent of the population. It is therefore, through an act of force, through violence, that in the nineteenth century constitu- tionalism is introduced in Portugal, contributing because of its very nature to the growing gulf between the rulers and their subjects - the 'people' in the broad meaning of the term. The cultural and social consequences are assessed by Oliveira Martins in the conclusion of História de Portugal, which seems to have been written with this question in mind: A consequência mais profunda da revolução liberal foi a ruptura da tradição, o acabamento definitivo do sebastianismo: exprimindo por esta palavra simbólica todo o corpo de ideias, ambições e costumes históricos. Substituiu-se-lhe, porém, a consciência de uma nova pátria moral? Acordou-se o sentimento de um verdadeiro individualismo, fundado na religão (consinta-se-nos dizer assim) democrática?12 The answer to these rhetorical questions is in the negative. If the middle class emerges then as 'the people', the social group born out of the civil war, the fact is that the majority of the nobility, the clergy, the rural workers and large segments of urban society had chosen Dom Miguel and not the Pedristas, having fallen into a certain political passivity during the period of Constitutionalism. This question is dealt with in both História de Portugal and Portugal Contemporâneo. In the latter work, particularly in books I-IH, which are dedicated entirely to the conflict between the two brothers, Dom Pedro and Dom Miguel, Oliveira Martins's narrative is dominated by the tragedy of a division in Portuguese society. 10 Teoria do Socialismo, p. 27. 11 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Du Contrat Social ou Principes du Droit Politique (Fans: union Générale, 196O, Book I, Chap. VI, p. 27. 12 Historia de Portugal, pp. 877-78.</page><page sequence="12">OLIVEIRA MARTINS: SPECTRES IN HIS HISTORIOGRAPHY II9 The agreement which was established between the two leaders stipulated that Dom Pedro would cede his rights to the crown and Dom Miguel, renouncing his absolutist past, would be king. He had already agreed to apply the Constitutional Charter of 1826, granted to the country by his brother. But Dom Miguel, returning from exile, reneged on his oath on arriving in Portugal and reinstated the absolutist regime. And during this interval, which was followed by Setembrismo, Cartismo and the Regeneração, the narrative of the implementation of Constitutional- ism was developed. The narrative scheme is that of the history of a claim being made for something (the constitution) which is not delivered to its recipient (the Portuguese nation). The situation before us fits perfectly within the conventions of struc- tural semantics. An order made by one of two characters (Dom Pedro) is accepted by the other (Dom Miguel). On the level of narrative, as well as in legal terms, a form of contract is thereby drawn up, which implies a prohibition - the repudiation of the old order. If the order is violated, a breach of contract occurs, generating a new series of narrative struc- tures. These are then used to describe the search or claim for an object which has been lost, but whose safety was guaranteed by a contractual obligation. The breach of a contract entails not only alienation and incorporation but also trials, battles and the imposition of tariffs. In the drama which unfolds in Portugal Contemporâneo, the functions carried out by the principal characters are suddenly inverted, showing the inadequacy of the claim which has been instigated. Dom Pedro, the bestower of the charter and the leader of the liberal faction, becomes the villain, just as Dom Miguel (the claimant), seen by the absolutists as the liberator and by the liberals as the guardian of the agreement becomes Dom Pedro's opponent. That there is a misunderstanding between the issuer of the Charter (Dom Pedro) and the recipient (the Portuguese nation) is quite clear during the period of trials and battles: in other words, during the civil war. It is then that Dom Miguel shows his true colours. Bearing the name of Saint Michael, the Archangel, he flaunts the trappings of his role. He appears as the reincarnation of the king, Dom Sebastião, the 'Desejado' (desired one), the guide of his people, just as, four centuries previously, the Mestre de Avis had been the great hope of the people of Lisbon. His empathy with the lower classes was similar to that which Dom Pedro I had with his subjects and he expressed that collective 'soul' to which the historian so often refers. This 'soul' is, however the 'soul' of the common people, the mob, the masses reduced to and enslaved by their basic instincts. Oliveira Martins distinguishes clearly between this group and the bourgeoisie. 'Burgueses rebelados', he says at the time of the presence of José da Silva Passos in Porto, 'não são o povo em revolução'. It is an</page><page sequence="13">I2O LUÍS DE SOUSA REBELO uprising of commoners against the ancient order. They are the popolani grassi who rise up against the podestà of Lisbon.13 Those who take to the streets under the reign of Dom Miguel are the common people, the populace. They feed the terror instituted by the king. On the orders of the latter, forces rise up to carry out public executions and sordid ergastula, or slave prisons, are opened to incarcerate his opponents. The crowds witnessed the spectacle of garrotting and from their heart sprang the agents of political persecution. Whilst these events occurred in Lisbon, Dom Pedro's forces were caught under siege in Porto. The audacious incursion into the South of Portugal by Charles Napier (who structurally plays the role of Adjudica- tor) managed to break the impasse, until another stalemate in hostilities led to foreign intervention (the second Adjudicator in the narrative). Inter- vention is politically the worst way of concluding the history of a claim that fails in its objective or is found to be unwanted. What little importance Oliveira Martins attributes to the role of the people in history is largely influenced by the idea that he had of its partici- pation in the French Revolution of 1789. Oliveira Martins seems to come close, at times, to Edmund Burke's idea of the revolutionary mob: 'a poor benighted mob' incapable of thought or discernment. On other occasions, he borders on the judgement issued by Taine, without ever being as blunt or abusive, for whom the revolutionary crowds were 'la canaille', 'la dernière plèbe'. Oliveira Martins is far more moderate and, when he uses the term 'plebe', he is not so offensively insulting as Taine. Nonetheless, not once does he see the 'common people' as Jules Michelet described them - the rural population or the urban poor - who far from being a merely passive instrument in the hands of groups pursuing their own interests, prove themselves to be the real and dynamic heroes of the piece.14 Neither does he see the revolutionary mob as the incarnation of all civic and republican virtues. For Oliveira Martins, the 'people' are the crowd that gathers around the guillotine to applaud executions and who delights in the excesses of the Reign of Terror. Because of their disturbing behaviour, and because of their inconsis- tency, the common people, mass society, are one of the spectres which manifests itself in Oliveira Martins's historical discourse. Hesitant, indif- ferent, passive, the people may allow themselves to be carried away by violent emotions or led on by a charismatic leader who awakens latent 13 Oliveira Martins, Portugal Contemporaneo. 3 vols (Lisbon: Guimarães, 1953), m, 90. 14 Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973); George Rude, Revolutionary Europe, 1783-181 5 (Glasgow: Fontana/Collins, 1974); George Rude, The Crowd in the French Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978); George Rude, The Crowd in History 1730-1848 (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1981); Jules Michelet, Le Peuple (Paris: Flammarion, 1974).</page><page sequence="14">OLIVEIRA MARTINS: SPECTRES IN HIS HISTORIOGRAPHY 121 messianic expectations. Appearing, disappearing, in order to reappear on the historical stage, 'the people' have the fleeting and elusive character of the shadowy realm typical of the supernatural. Its appearance and its absence depend on a dialectic, which controls the appearances, and whose effects are unforeseeable. The process of repetition gives rise to a hidden meaning to the obstinate reoccurrence of the same figure or the same phenomenon, which cannot be anticipated in its form or in its intentions. This type of repetition, with its mysterious, unusual and uncontrollable aspects, falls within the category that Freud defined as the Unheimlich, a term for which there is no easy translation in Portuguese and which is translated in English as 'uncanny'.15 The theory of chance which Oliveira Martins developed in one of his lines of historical discourse, attempts precisely to rationalize coincidences, to fit them into a logical model which will remove the enigmatic and apparently demoniacal character which can be seen in them, and which corresponds to a state of subliminal disturbance at the level of discourse. In the same way we should under- stand his adhesion to the evolutionary model of societies, to their cyclical movement and his interest in the corsi e ricorsi of Vico, as an attempt to dominate an obsession which is introduced into the meshes of his writing. Now, if the people as a metaphorical obsession of historical discourse are an unknown quantity, no less uncertain is Miguelismo, one of the vicissitudes of Sebastianismo, the 'duende' spirit which takes over the body of the masses - another of the spectres which hovers over the future of Portugal. Banished in 1834, he returned with Macdonell and his men in 1846, leaving in the air the threat of his return. On disappearing to return in moments of national crisis ('the time is out of joint'), one can never be sure of the imminence of the spectral apparition, if the expecta- tion which it creates anticipates the country's rescue or its perdition. This ignorance can lead to the anticipation of a change for the better, the overcoming of failings of a previous visit. Thus the sinister seduction exerted by the spectre.

Portugal was born of a breach of contract, the possible result of an error, and it never seems to achieve, in Oliveira Martins's formulations, the social 15 Sigmund Freud, 'The Uncanny', in Art and Literature, The Penguin Freud Library, 14 (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1985), 335-76.

The term is frequently used with a pre-constitutional connotation. By resorting to perjury and conspiracies, hiding his motives and true intent - a disturbing method of achieving political change - Dom Miguel seduced the people and Miguelismo acceded to power. Paradoxically, however, the spectre is legitimate in its illegitimacy (and this is one of the most fascinating aspects of recurrence as a pitfall of destiny or the demoniacal work), a legitimacy which Oliveira Martins bestows on it in a little known article on Miguelismo: A ideia da volta às tradições nacionais, a ideia de uma autonomia moral, a ideia de uma política extraída das próprias raízes da vida histórica dos povos, eis o que o miguelismo significa, se o despirmos dos símbolos e formulas em que esse pensa- mento, aliás fecundo, aparecia envolvido-isto é, da restauração de instituições extintas por caducas, e de uma legitimidade provadamente falsa.17 On studying and developing theories in relation to the conflict of the legitimacy of the nation, which is at the origin of his historical discourse, Oliveira Martins attempts to exorcise the phantoms which haunted Portu- guese society and his own writing. It is an exercise that does not prove to be entirely effective. However, he admirably maintains his pact with the reader. In his discursive vision he transcends the mode of writing history inherited from the chronicle, transforming it, without deviating from the ancient narrative tradition. He goes, however, much further. He allows the obsessions that besiege his discourse to become apparent. And, on inviting the reader to cross from the study of history to the study of philosophy, Oliveira Martins reveals to him or her the horizon of ideas of social justice and the possibility of a change in society, dictated by principles of moral order which perhaps manage to exorcise threats which have a tendency to repeat themselves cyclically in the life of the nation.
