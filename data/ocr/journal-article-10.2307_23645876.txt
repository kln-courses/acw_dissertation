<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELEANOR KAUFMAN Do Dual Structures Exist? Deleuze and Lacan in the Wake of Lévi-Strauss There is a quite radical strain of mid-twentieth-century French thought, one culminating in Gilles Deleuze's 1967 essays "How Do We Recognize Structuralism?" and "Michel Tournier and the World without Others," that in essence attempts to envision a world not mediated by the gaze of the other.1 Insofar as the question of alter ity—of interpolation by the other (Hegel, Sartre, Althusser), of mi metic rivalry with the other (Girard), or even of non-reciprocal ex change with the other (Bataille, Levinas, Baudrillard)—is a mainstay in twentieth-century French philosophy, and expressed in a variety of guises and valences,2 it is hard to envision a realm in any clear sense apart from such relations. This is even more the case in the French anthropological tradition, with its rich development of the idea of gift economy, in which there is an absolute dependence on models of exchange, if not reciprocity. And this would certainly seem to be the framework not only of Claude Lévi-Strauss's important "Intro duction" to Marcel Mauss's The Gift but also the stakes of his mag isterial The Elementary Structures of Kinship, which are predicated on the endogamous and exogamous exchanges of women, above all in the marriage relation.3 Yet, just as Jacques Derrida will pose the 1.

This is effectively the model that Deleuze puts forward in his analysis of Tournier's first rewriting of the Robinson Crusoe story, Vendredi ou les limbes du Pacifique, in which he examines the tran sition that the protagonist Robinson undergoes on the desert island: from being caught up in the world of what Deleuze calls the "struc ture-Other," essentially the concern for the regard of other humans, to transcending the other-oriented realm entirely so as to become one with the material elements of the island itself. As Deleuze writes, In the Other's absence, consciousness and its object are one. . . . Con sciousness ceases to be a light cast upon objects in order to become a pure phosphorescence of things in themselves. Robinson is but the consciousness of the island, but the consciousness of the island is the consciousness the island has of itself—it is the island in itself. We un derstand the paradox of the desert isle: the one who is shipwrecked, if he is alone, if he has lost the structure-Other, disturbs nothing of the desert isle,- rather he consecrates it.5 I have outlined elsewhere6 the remarkable convergence of a series of seemingly un-Deleuzian preoccupations from this pivotal moment in the late 1960s—the world without others over the structure-Other, the Freudian death instinct over life, sadism over masochism, and (Boston: Beacon Press, 1969); and Marcel Mauss, The Gift: The Form and Reason of Exchange in Archaic Societies, trans.

He links the differential aspect to Lévi-Strauss's mode of operation in The Elementary Struc tures of Kinship and the singular to his four-part mapping of the Oe dipus myth in Structural Anthropology. I quote at length: When Lévi-Strauss undertakes the study of elementary kinship struc tures, he not only considers the real fathers in a society, nor only the father-images that run through the myths of that society. He claims to discover real kinship phonemes, that is, kin-emes [parentèmes], positional units which do not exist independently of the differential relations in to which they enter and that determine each other recip rocally. It is in this way that the four relations—brother/sister, hus band/wife, father/son, maternal uncle/sister's son—form the simplest structure. And to this combinatory system of "kinship names" corre spond in a complex way, but without resembling them, the "kinship attitudes" that realize the singularities determined in the system. One could just as well proceed in the opposite manner: start from singularities in order to determine the differential relations between ultimate symbolic elements. Thus, taking the example of the Oedipus myth, Lévi-Strauss starts from the singularities of the story (Oedipus marries his mother, kills his father, immolates the Sphinx, is named club-foot, etc.) in order to infer from them the differential relations between "mythemes" which are determined reciprocally (overestima tion of kinship relations, underestimation of kinship relations, nega tion of aboriginality, persistence of aboriginality).8 I will return in more detail to the model of the Oedipus myth, but here I would note two associations that Deleuze proceeds to make with respect to this dual aspect of structure. The first is to Lévi Strauss's distinction between "names" and "attitudes": "Another side of the question lies in the important attempt to correlate static positions in the kinship structure (as defined by terminology) with dynamic attitudes expressed, on the one hand, in rights, duties, ob 7. Deleuze, "How Do We Recognize Structuralism?," 170. 8. Ibid., 177.</page><page sequence="4">86 Yale French Studies ligations and, on the other, in privileges, avoidance, etc."9 This cor responds in effect to the distinction Lévi-Strauss makes earlier in the same essay between social structures "outside the time dimension" and social organization as such, "where time re-enters" (this also cor responds to the "'mechanical' time, reversible and non-cumulative" of anthropology itself, as opposed to the methodology of the disci pline of history, which is grounded in "empirical observation").10 The first and seemingly favored dimension seems to find a parallel in the first of three different notions of time in the Hopi kinship sys tem, which Lévi-Strauss evokes briefly at a later point in the same essay. This is what he refers to as "an 'empty' time, stable and re versible, illustrated by the father's mother's and mother's father's lineages, where the same terms are consistently applied throughout the generations."11 Deleuze does not elaborate here on this pattern of preferential opposition in Lévi-Strauss between two models of time: on the one hand, anthropological, static, mechanical, and empty; and, on the other, historical, empirical, dynamic, and irreversible. However, Deleuze goes on in the next section to translate this dual model of structure into what will become the fundamental framework of his 1968 opus Difference and Repetition. He links the favored differential relations to 1) the total structure; 2) the virtual; 3) differentiation (t); and "distinct species," whereas singularities are linked to 1) the partial structure or singular points,- 2) actualization; 3) différenciation (c); and 4) "the parts and extended figures which characterize each species."12 In other words, the higher order, if this expression be permitted, in Deleuze's great work of so-called post structuralism—namely, the celebrated notion of the virtual—aligns precisely with Lévi-Strauss's static, ahistorical model of structure. But beyond this, both works simultaneously gesture to the way in which the favored term of the two categories (the mechanical/ the differential) is itself comparable to a "total structure"13 that in some sense goes beyond the dualism of the two categories, just as 9.

A few pages ear lier, Deleuze also puts his argument in the framework of what will become the domi nant one of his other major synthetic work from this period, The Logic of Sense (1969], namely, the generation of sense from nonsense, as exemplified by the work of Lewis Carroll (175). 13. Ibid., 179.</page><page sequence="5">ELEANOR KAUFMAN 87 the "world without others" goes beyond all duality implied by the "structure-Other." As Deleuze glosses it, and this not insignificantly in his brief discussion of Althusser and structuralist Marxism insofar as they privilege an analysis of the structural place holders of the capitalist system over and above the human subjects who fill those places: "The true subject is the structure itself: the differential and the singular, the differential relations and the singular points, the re ciprocal determination and the complete determination."14 If post structuralist thought purportedly goes beyond dualism, we might say that Deleuze, like Lévi-Strauss, seeks more nearly to go to the heart of dualism. And this is a crucial distinction, for as Jacques Lacan al lows us to see, it is only from the conscious interiority of dualism that its unconscious vanishing point becomes palpable. There are at least two ways by which structural dualism becomes other to itself. On the one hand, as we have seen, one of the terms (such as the world without others) is elevated to the level of the total ity. On the other hand, there is an empty term that serves as motor force for the whole. Deleuze explains the latter as follows: The whole structure is driven by this originary Third, but that also fails to coincide with its own origin. Distributing the differences through the entire structure, making the differential relations vary with its displacements, the object=x constitutes the differenciating element of difference itself Games need the empty square, without which nothing would move forward or function. The object=x is not distinguishable from its place, but it is characteristic of this place that it constantly displaces itself, just as it is characteristic of the empty square to jump ceaselessly. Lacan invokes the dummy-hand in bridge, and in the admirable opening pages of The Order of Things, where he describes a painting by Velasquez, Foucault invokes the place of the king, in relation to which everything is displaced and slides, God, then man, without ever filling it. No structuralism is possible without this degree zero. . . . And even Lévi-Strauss, who in certain respects is the most positive among the structuralists, the least romantic, the least inclined to welcome an elusive element, recognized in the "mana" or its equivalents the existence of a "floating signifier," with a symbolic zero value circulating in the structure.15 14. Ibid., 178. 15. Ibid., 186. Deleuze goes on to posit that it is the phallus that serves the func tion of "object=x" in Lacan's system: "But the phallus appears not as a sexual given or as the empirical determination of one of the sexes. It appears rather as the symbolic organ that founds sexuality in its entirety as system or structure.... the symbolic phal</page><page sequence="6">88 Yale French Studies Rather than the "mana" in Lévi-Strauss's discussion of Mauss to which Deleuze refers, we might turn to another essay in Structural Anthropology that poses even more emphatically the problem of the empty or zero value: the 1956 essay "Do Dual Organizations Exist?," which will be discussed in more detail in what follows and in which the north-south axis of the Bororo village, which allows for a dualist reading of that space, is precisely the axis that has a "zero value" in that it appears to have no purpose other than to allow the social struc ture of Bororo life as such to exist: These institutions [here, the north-south axis] have no intrinsic prop erty other than that of establishing the necessary preconditions for the existence of the social system to which they belong; their pres ence—in itself devoid of significance—enables the social system to exist as a whole. Anthropology here encounters an essential problem, one which it shares with linguistics, but with which it does not seem to have come to grips in its own field. This is the problem posed by the existence of institutions having no function other than that of giv ing meaning to the society in which they are found.16 In this way, there are three logics at play, or perhaps two logics with the second having two aspects. The first is the dual model of terms with the favored ones aligning on one side. Such a dualism would seem to correlate with the notion of the binary so squarely associated with structuralism. Yet the second logic entirely reorients the first in that it simultaneously elevates one side of the duality to a more absolute whole and in this manner shows the very idea of dual ity to be a fundamentally limited and limiting concept. And the third logic, which like the second undermines duality as such, neverthe less posits an empty structure that is not unlike the favored term of the duality (mechanical, empty time, the north-south axis, etc.), but which serves as the enabling motor force of the whole system and also remains in some sense apart from it. In the manner of the gift economy described above, structure cancels itself out from within and leaves as its indigestible remainder (perhaps what is central and raw and celibate in the fashion of the inner circle analyzed in "Do lus is precisely that which does not coincide with its own identity, always found there where it is not since it is not where one looks for it, always displaced in relation to it self, from the side of the mother" (187, original emphasis). The question oí the mother in Lacan's reading of Hamlet will be taken up in what follows. 16. Lévi-Strauss, "Do Dual Organizations Exist?, "in Structural Anthropology, 159.</page><page sequence="7">ELEANOR KAUFMAN 89 Dual Organizations Exist?") nothing short of. the "structure itself." At issue, then, is a thought of structure that uses its relentless logical formalism to dismantle the very form of structure (in Difference and Repetition, Deleuze evokes "the formless as the product of the most extreme formality").17 Yet, rather than being dismantled in the man ner of what comes to be known as poststructuralism, here structure is catapulted into a fully ontological domain, which is not the same as the postmodern or poststructuralist rejection of all structure. This process is ontological in that both the first term of the dualism (the favored static, empty, and virtual aspect) as well as the interplay of the second and the third anti-dualist positions, gesture to the "thing in itself" of the entity rather than simply claiming that it cannot be ar rived at and thus can only be approximated in epistemological terms. At issue, then, is a rigorous undoing or weakening rather than some thing that simply falls apart (the subject, arguably, of all of Samuel Beckett's fiction). Indeed, it is the affirmation of the otherworldly and upending terrain that resides at the heart of a structure whose "center does not hold" that, I will claim, marks the firmest embrace of a posi tive ontology of something like pure being that we are likely to find in the entirety of the twentieth-century French philosophical tradition. What I hope to isolate in its barest outline in the remainder of this essay is what I will call the neo-Scholastic structural-ontological synthesis, something that is cryptically advanced in a succession of mid-twentieth-century works by Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, and Deleuze, but never acknowledged as such by these thinkers. This is a synthe sis that almost entirely vanished after the late 1960s, not only from French thought in general but from the work of these specific think ers, and my ambition is to suggest the outline of a counter-history of twentieth-century French thought: what it might have looked like post-1968 if its high-structural moment had not been so thoroughly stamped out and disavowed, beginning in 1966 with its sudden and transformative American appropriation.18 17.

This came in the form not only of the transatlantic enthusiasm for Foucault's 1966 book Les mots et les choses (The Order of Things, not published in English until</page><page sequence="8">90 Yale French Studies In appealing to Scholasticism, I am referring not so much to the extraordinary synthesis of Greek thought with Judaism, Christianity, or Islam as much as the methodology of Scholastic inquiry, which is a methodology that explores with extraordinary rigor, among other things, those categories that were considered as transcenden tal—above all being, truth, goodness, and unity. In short, any tran scendental category worth its characterization as such is shown to contain both the thing and the form of the thing in a relation that is not simply inclusive but at times exclusive, in the fashion out lined above with respect to Lévi-Strauss and Deleuze. To take one of the principle examples from Scholastic thought, "being" signals the interplay of esse and ens, the general category of being [esse, to be) as distinguished from a particular being [ens], where the general category is thought at a level of abstraction such that it does not nec essarily include the common sense notion of the particular entity.19 That is, being as such in its absolute sense is only to be found in the realm of God, which is unchanging, perfect, eternal, and simple,- this clearly does not much resemble a living being, so that what is ulti mately at issue is whether God and creatures can even be measured in the same terms. The tradition of "divine names" takes up this question of whether God is entirely distinct from creatures (equivoc ity), is related by analogy to creatures (Aquinas), or is fundamentally coterminous with nature and creatures (Scotus and the lineage that followed him via Spinoza to Deleuze). This emphasis on the structural bifurcation inherent in transcen dental categories follows Eugene Thacker's argument in After Life that "life" has become a contemporary transcendental category inso far as there exists a bifurcation between "Life" and "the living" that can be traced back to Ancient and Scholastic thought.20 In this way, 1970], but above all the famous conference at Johns Hopkins on the "The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man" which brought together the likes of Lacan, Der rida, Roland Barthes, Paul de Man, and Jean Hyppolite.

Eugene Thacker, After Life (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010).</page><page sequence="9">ELEANOR KAUFMAN 91 Thacker distinguishes between Life as a structural-ontological cat egory that is not itself alive (essentially the form of psuchëas outlined in Aristotle's De Anima), and living beings (the actual beings that fall into Aristotle's three levels of psuchë or "soul," which are nutritive, sensitive, and intellective). In parallel fashion, though if anything at odds with the category of "life," I would propose that for a strain of French thought that runs from Lévi-Strauss to Lacan to Deleuze, the category of structure is in some sense catapulted to a transcendental, ontological category, and the question thus becomes how the funda mental bifurcation at the heart of this entity of "structure," as arrived at by a method of quasi-Scholastic transcendental inquiry, is itself to be thought within the framework of the totality of the structure that it simultaneously undoes. The workings of this operation can be further specified by exam ining the way in which the Oedipus myth functions for each of the thinkers in question. If for Deleuze The Elementary Structures of Kinship is the mark of the differential operation of kinship relations, and the Oedipus myth the mapping of four singular transhistorical variants (grouped as positive or negative relations of filiation, marry ing the mother/killing the father; and positive or negative relations to the earth, the club foot as positive valuation of chthonic birth/the killing of monsters, who spring from the earth, the negation of the chthonic), there seems nonetheless to be a differential operation at work in Lévi-Strauss's schematization of the Oedipus myth. Along side the singularities of the narrative, there is a difference operator that sifts the human, the inhuman, and the elemental (here, the earth), so that these terms gain their significance also in relation to the potential for an inner bifurcation. The human is split between the familial and the chthonic, the inhuman between the murder of fam ily and the killing of monsters, and the elemental between affirma tion and negation. In Lévi-Strauss's hands, in short, this imminently human and familial tragedy becomes a dialectic of elements which, above and beyond the split between Life and the living, embodies the bifurcation between the Inhuman as Structure and the concrete singularities of human or inhuman action and anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic elements. There is the same problem of the "zero value" of the Inhuman Structure as formally distinct from the inhuman being or element, which at once encompasses those ele ments and dissolves them, just as in Scholastic discussions of truth the larger category of truth might encompass both truth and falsity</page><page sequence="10">92 Yale French Studies as logical operators that both support an inquiry into truth and chal lenge its very foundations.21 Lévi-Strauss indeed poses Deleuze's problem of the differential and the singular, at least after a fashion, in the aforementioned "Do Dual Organizations Exist?" from Structural Anthropology. Here he analyzes the conflicting reports from informants in various Amer indian, Indonesian, and South American societies that explain how their clans are organized. One reported model is of a settlement di vided by a straight line through the center into dual parts (the north south axis discussed above); yet another model explains the arrange ment as one of concentric circles in which the inner circle is the more elevated sphere (celibate, masculine, raw) and the other one the realm of women, the family, and cooked food. How can these different spa tial models be reconciled? In an elaborate reading, Lévi-Strauss goes on to delineate how, depending on who is narrating, these models are not necessarily mutually exclusive but in fact can co-exist, espe cially if one regards the concentric circle model as an intermediary of sorts between the straight line division and a ternary model that is not described in detail. Thus may be posed the titular question of whether or not the well-established anthropological model of dual or ganization really exists. Whereas in his "Introduction" to the Work of Marcel Mauss, Lévi-Strauss critiques Mauss's tripartite model of gift exchange divided into giving, receiving, and returning and suggests that what is really at issue is the totality of exchange itself, in "Do Dual Organizations Exist?" he leaves this tension open, succumbing to the same "shortcoming" that he roundly criticizes in Mauss.22 It is not so much the dual, concentric, and ternary organizational struc tures as it is the opening of the structural model itself to encompass all three in a non-contradictory manner that is indeed an approach that goes beyond dualism. For it is the latter that brings Lévi-Strauss in close proximity to the Deleuze who celebrates the loss of the 21. See John Buridan, Sophisms on Meaning and Truth, trans. T.K. Scott (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1966). 22. See Lévi-Strauss, "Introduction," 45.

Thus "Do Dual Organizations Exist?" provides a framework not only for an ontological inquiry into the logic of "structure," but also for a phenomenology of reading that is not so much a "surface read ing" in current parlance, but an alternate reading from the depths of structure, which are none other than the adjacent spaces of the vil lages in question. This essay, along with Lévi-Strauss's other work from this period, explores the possibility of perceiving otherwise a seemingly mutually exclusive situation (such as the example of truth and falsity for the Scholastics). Yet this mode of perception is itself indissociable from a bumping up against the "navel" of the structure, which is also the space of the structure's vanishing. And it is this methodological opening to inexistence that is central to what I am calling the ontological enterprise that links Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, and Deleuze.23 This structural vanishing is, paradoxically, the point at which the structure nearly succeeds in creating a map—to use Borges's famous expression—that is coterminous with the territory. And it is in fact Lacan, above and beyond Lévi-Strauss and Deleuze, who recognizes 23. I draw the term "inexistence" from Alain Badiou's Logics of Worlds, trans. Alberto Toscano (London: Continuum, 2009) and other more recent writings. Whereas Badiou emphasizes the directionality of an inexistent factor that must become rec ognized in order for the situation to be transformed into a properly evental one, I am gesturing to a structure that is already recognized as such (e.g., the north-south axis), but when it is considered more carefully appears to vanish or unravel. Marcos Zafi ropoulous makes a direct influence argument with respect to Lévi-Strauss and Lacan, noting at one point the centrality of Lévi-Strauss's discovery of the zero value to Lacan: "The Bororo society is located at the heart of Lévi-Strauss's work and we have seen that the division between north and south had been a kind of enigma for him since the 1940s; he suddenly exhumed this enigma in 1956 and resolved it decisively by mak ing it an archetype of the zero-value institution. In my opinion, the latter had inspired Lacan's own reflection from the time that he had first read Lévi-Strauss's preface to the work of Marcel Mauss," Lacan and Lévi-Strauss or the Return to Freud (1951-1957), trans. John Holland (London: Karnac Books, 2010), 171. While this argument certainly underscores my claims here, I am not working as overtly with a notion of conscious influence between these thinkers. Other studies that pursue the line of direct influence include Alain Delrieu, Lévi-Strauss lecteur de Freud: Le droit, l'inceste, le père et l'échange des femmes (Paris: Anthropos, 1999) and L'anthropologie de Lévi-Strauss et la psychanalyse: D'une structure l'autre, ed. Marcel Drach and Bernard Toboul (Paris: La Découverte, 2008).</page><page sequence="12">94 Yale French Studies the vanishing or weakening point of the structure as something dis tinct from the motor force of the zero value "object=x" described above. This question of vanishing or aphanisis—which is technically the loss of sexual desire, but Lacan develops this in a more general sense—is the enigmatic kernel of Lacan's most structural-ontological seminar, "Desire and its Interpretations" (Seminar Six from 1958-59), which is also an extended reading of Hamlet. Whereas Lévi-Strauss demarcates the Oedipus myth under the rubric of four chiasmic parts, Lacan contrasts Oedipus and Hamlet as exemplifying two entirely different psychic dimensions. If Oedipus's actions reveal the impri matur of the unconscious (Oedipus is unaware that he is marrying his mother and killing his father until after the fact), Hamlet by contrast is fully conscious of the vortex surrounding the father's murder into which he is catapulted, not insignificantly, by the murdered father himself, or, more precisely, by the dead father's specter. Lacan in fact repeatedly references the analysis of a dream Freud recounts in The Interpretation of Dreams of a man who has just lost his father, and dreams very poignantly of his father not knowing he is dead. Rather than focusing on the subject's almost certain wish for his father's death (for it seems the father suffered from a protracted illness in re lation to which the son's wish for his death would be fairly unremark able), Lacan contrasts the state of the father not knowing he is dead in the dream with Hamlet's all too death-conscious father.24 In the dream example from Freud, which parallels the case of Oe dipus, there is a fundamental ignorance of the familial structure as it pertains to life and death. By contrast, Hamlet and his father the ghost are excellent readers of structures, for the father knows he is dead and is subsisting in purgatory (or worse); and the son is able not only to hear the voice of the father when others such as his mother cannot, but he is also able to devise a literary-structural replica of what the father knows (the play within the play).25 Whereas Oedipus does not know (and his story is thus amenable to mapping schémas such as 24.

Lacan remarks that "[I]t is this community of knowing, of the fact that the father and the son both know, which is here the mainspring which creates the whole difficulty of the problem of the assumption of this act by Hamlet" ("Desire and its Interpretation," session 13, March 4, 1959).</page><page sequence="13">ELEANOR KAUFMAN 95 Lévi-Strauss's and Deleuze's), Hamlet replicates what he knows to the point that it dissolves his cause. On the one hand, he is unable to kill his uncle at the moment the uncle, seemingly repentant after the play within the play, is praying (for the father has given his soul to these damning structural pursuits, whereas the uncle's soul would be freed if murdered while at prayer); on the other hand, as Lacan points out, Hamlet's desire is no longer with the structure that the father's ghost makes visible (if it ever was), but with the far less discernible desire of his mother Gertrude. As Lacan cites from Hamlet Act IV, "The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body."26 Lacan will go on to relate this to the workings of the phallus, but we might say instead: the structure is with the father, but the father is not with the structure. If Oedipus reflects the desire to kill the father and marry the mother, Hamlet for Lacan (in contrast to Ernest Jones's celebrated Oe dipal reading of Hamlet)17 stages the desire of the mother.28 In other words, it is not that Hamlet desires his mother, as much as he em bodies her desire—and this, then, is the part that is arguably not fully conscious for Hamlet. If he were not caught, like his mother, in the fundamental and immobilizing bifurcation of loyalty to the father and to the uncle, then certainly he would be able to act more efficiently. Whereas Oedipus pays for his sins, Hamlet does not.29 According to Lacan, after the encounter with the ghost, Hamlet rids himself of the other-oriented Oedipal model (Deleuze's singular structure-Other), one preoccupied with rivalry with the father, the imaginary or ag gressive relation to the mother, and a demand-oriented relation to the love object Ophelia (objet petit a).30 Indeed this encounter with the otherless world of the specter not only brings out Hamlet's rejection of and cruelty toward Ophelia,31 but it deflates Hamlet's reprimands to his mother in Act III (when he goes to her bedroom after the play 26.

It is through Deleuze, who develops these structural-ontological inquiries that are only gestured to in Lacan (though he leaves them aside once he embarks on his col laborations with Guattari), that we can perceive belatedly the way in which this idea of the structure "vanished" by its totalizing aspira tions (or the structure for which its strength is also its weakness) is in fact anticipated in the form if not in the explicit methodology of Lévi Strauss's analyses in Structural Anthropology. And these analyses provide the template, only recognizable in obscure and belated fash ion, for the operation by which the structure that is the support and guiding framework of the entire system is shown to be, not a nothing, but precisely inexistent at the point of interpellation in language or naming. This is what accounts for Hamlet's waning enthusiasm for the revenge plan of his ghostly father, and for the loss of the structure Other on the desert island in Deleuze's reading of Tournier. What I am calling the structural-ontological synthesis is difficult to extract from the thinkers in question, because, if anything, they make an ef 32. Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act I, Scene 2. 33. Lacan notes that in Hamlet Act HI, iv, 112, when the father's ghost in refer ence to the faltering Gertrude implores Hamlet to "[s]tep between her and her fight ing soul," Hamlet himself falters in his reprimand to his mother: "we see here the oscillation between this which, at the moment of the collapse of Hamlet's discourse is something which is in the words themselves, namely the disappearance, the dying away of his appeal into something which is a consenting to the desire of his mother, laying down his arms before something which seems ineluctable to him; namely that the mother's desire here takes on again for him the value of something which in no case, and by no method can be raised up," session 15, March 18, 1959. 34.

Lévi-Strauss is the only one of these thinkers who affirms his position as a structuralist, something that Lacan and Deleuze were reticent to do, and thereby provides the opening and impetus for situating the lineage of the thinkers in question under the rubric of the structural transcendental. We might say that it is Lévi-Strauss's avowal of the structuralist project, combined with Lacan's avowal of the tendency of the structure toward its own vanishing or weakness, that, alongside Deleuze's avowal of the positivity of the empty form and of the world without others (the undoing of dualism in the dual aspect of totality and collapse), allows the formulation of a structural ontological synthesis derived from these three thinkers insofar as it is rendered visible at the point at which their respective works aban doned this line of inquiry. After Structural Anthropology, we see less of a penchant in Lévi-Strauss for the numerical distillation of struc ture in terms of two-, three-, or four-part mappings. After Seminar Six on "Desire and its Interpretations," Lacan is less focused on the aphanisis or the vanishing of desire but rather on its positive articula tion in the figure of Antigone in Seminar Seven, in which he asserts that ethics is a matter of "act[ing] in conformity with the desire that is in you."37 After this "dark" phase in the late 1960s, Deleuze embarks 35.

Notably in this seminar, Lacan also cites Lévi-Strauss in order to hold up Antigone as emblematic of precisely the intemporal ontology at issue in this essay: "This relationship to being suspends everything that has to do with transforma tion, with the cycle of generation and decay or with history itself, and it places us on a level that is more extreme than any other as it is directly attached to language as such ...

Af ter May '68, there is an interest in libidinal economy which in fact continues some of these structural-ontological pursuits in the form of a synthesis of Marx and Freud, but this line of inquiry itself entirely disappears by the mid-1970s and is replaced by a turn to the politi cal over and above the structural-economic, and to political theology over and above the logical considerations of Scholastic theology.38 Even to think the structural-ontological synthesis that was so forcefully stopped in its tracks (why this stoppage took place will be reserved for a subsequent investigation) entails a necessarily specu lative, if not a counter-factual approach. And of course, it might be asked, why would anyone wish to bother with a resuscitation of this type of high-structural, arguably ontotheological (but more nearly onto-logical), and quasi-nihilistic mode of abstraction? My answer is that such a form of thought represents an enhanced form of percep tion, one in fact gestured to in the farthest reaches of phenomenol ogy—the late Merleau-Ponty of "The Intertwining—The Chiasm"39— that is no longer dominated by the reference point of the human per ceiver but takes its dissipating motor force from a purely positive island-consciousness or structure-consciousness itself, which is per haps more in line with both Lacan's and Deleuze's readings of Freud, in which they underscore that there is no negation, or "no," in the space of the unconscious.40 This is admittedly not a space of engagement (Sartre), event (in Badiou's sense), equality (Rancière), the common or the multitude (Hardt and Negri), or Utopian dialectic (Jameson). Rather it is the do main of the "larval subject" that in its weakness has the capacity in invoking him here, since I was instrumental in having had him reread Antigone and he expressed himself to me in such terms—Antigone with relation to Creon finds herself in the place of synchrony in opposition to diachrony" (285). 38. I have discussed the libidinal economy moment of French thought as it is crys tallized in the work of Lyotard, Deleuze and Guattari, Baudrillard, and Klossowski in "The Desire Called Mao: Badiou and the Legacy of Libidinal Economy," Postmodern Culture 18/1 (September 2007). It might be argued that Derrida's reading of Hamlet and the "out of jointness" of messianic time in Specters of Marx (trans. Peggy Kamuf [New York: Routledge, 1994]), inaugurates the contemporary critical turn, or return, to political theology. 39.

As Deleuze writes, "thought is, rather, one of those terrible movements which can be sustained only under the conditions of the larval subject . . . Even the philosopher is a larval subject of his own system."41 This system is an apparatus for using form and even formal logic to entirely alter common perception and notions of relationality. Like the larval sub ject that can tolerate rigorous upheaval because it is not yet mature, this thought was perhaps too disquieting for these thinkers to have sustained past the mid-point of their respective careers. Had these speculations been pursued, "French theory" would presumably have been less palatable to an Anglo-American audience. But then again, such speculations might be more perceivable and enticing precisely from the vantage point of the American dark continent. 41.
