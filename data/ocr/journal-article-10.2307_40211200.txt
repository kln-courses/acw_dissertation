<plain_text><page sequence="1">Political Animals: Engagements with Imperial and Gender Discourses in Late-Colonial Australian Circuses Gillian Arrighi The taming of wild animals has always excited a deal of interest in the human breast. The supremacy of the human mind, skill, and courage over instinct and immense lawless brute force is a fine thing to witness, and has the fascination for men that all fine things ought to have .... [S]ince the days when Mark Antony drove a pair of lions in his chariot, and Domitian had a hunting lion trained as a retriever, the king of beasts has proved an attraction alike to the trainer and the public. -Illustrated Sydney News, 21 January 1893 The desire to contain and look at exotic animals has manifested itself over past mil- lennia as private princely zoological collections, traveling menageries, metropolitan zoos, and as elements of fairground, circus, and variety entertainments.1 The perform- ing animal act is likewise an ancient staged encounter between humans and animals, and its popularity is persistent. Goals such as scientific inquiry and educational merit have frequently justified the collecting and exhibiting of animals, but the primary act of display and the complicity of an audience underpin all such undertakings. Despite the marginalization of performing animals from mainstream circus programs during the latter decades of the twentieth century,2 performances involving animals trained specifically for the job of entertaining human audiences retain an ancient popularity in high-profile cultural sites around the globe. For example, in the Asia-Pacific region, Gillian Arrighi is a lecturer in Drama in the School of Drama, Fine Art and Music at the University of Newcastle, Australia. She has a background as a professional performer. Her current research inter- ests include children on the stage, popular entertainments of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, and animals in performance. 1 The history and analysis of captive animal displays are addressed in the following monographs, among others: David Hancocks, A Different Nature: The Paradoxical World of Zoos and Their Uncertain Future (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001); Harriet Ritvo, The Animal Estate (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1987); Nigel Rothfels, Savages and Beasts: The Birth of the Modern Zoo (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002); Vernon N. Kisling, ed., Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Animal Collections to Zoological Gardens (London: CRC Press, 2000); R. J. Hoage and William A. Deiss, eds., New Worlds, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996). 2 Currently in Australia, traditional traveling, family-based circuses maintain animal acts on their programs alongside so-called new circus companies that do not. These small family circuses, however, endure a slim existence beyond the margins of mainstream entertainment practice; their adherence to performances involving animals is perhaps the affective feature that lowers the perceived social status of such groups, while ensuring that they are closely scrutinized by animal rights and welfare groups.

This essay argues that popular animal acts are never just about the animals or humanity's complex relation- ship with animals. These acts are structured by human producers for consumption by human spectators, who in turn bring their contemporary knowledge and, cultural attitudes to bear upon the performances. As a clarification of my point, when we sit in the zoo precinct today watching an animal show, we are surrounded by individual animals who are examples of species that have "nowhere else to go."3 We are reminded of shrinking and impoverished habitats, of deforestation and contaminated waterways; we are reminded of extinction, of the fragile hold on existence some species have, and of the need to appreciate and conserve what remains. In short, our reception of contemporary animal acts is informed by postmodernity's awareness that humankind has the capacity to destroy the environment in spectacular ways and that animals have thus "become a human moral responsibility."4 Performances involving large, exotic mammals such as lions, tigers, and elephants held a strong attraction for nineteenth-century audiences, and by the latter half of the century, they had become essential commodities of major traveling circuses in Britain, the United States, and, somewhat belatedly, Australia. This essay addresses several wild animal acts produced by the Australian FitzGerald Brothers' Circus and by the South African circus of Frank Fillis in Australasia in the 1890s.5 The analysis of "perform- ing" lions and tigers as signs denoting wildness and nature, within binary systems that set culture against nature and wildness against civilization, has been thoroughly addressed by circus semioticians Paul Bouissac and Yoram Carmeli.6 Their meticulous explanations of the syntactic structure of such acts provides a useful starting point for performance analysis, but does not allow for the cultural complexities that necessarily influence the reception of these acts in varying sites and periods of production. Bouis- sac's observation that "[big] cat acts have no real information value. Only an accident would provide real information" denies the narrative potential of the wild animal act.7 This study explores some of the complex cultural interactions that occurred between these major circuses and their publics; it focuses on the ways in which popular animal acts became conduits for the expression of high-stake issues such as the protection of colonial society's patriarchal structure and political imperatives that supported British and colonial involvement in the Anglo-Boer War. The first case study reveals the narrative and subversive potential of the big-cat act. In Sydney during 1892-93, contemporary attitudes toward acceptable demonstrations of gender and identity converged on the exhibitions of lion taming at the circuses of the FitzGerald Brothers and Frank Fillis when the premier of the colony of New South 3 Matthew Scully, Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy (New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2002), 1. 4 Adrian Franklin, Animals and Modern Cultures (London: Sage, 1999), 59. 5 Within this essay, " Australasia7' is taken to mean New Zealand and the six colonies of Australia. 6 Paul Bouissac, "Poetics in the Lions' Den: The Circus Act as Text," in Circus and Culture: A Semiotic Approach (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1976), 107.

This essay's focus then shifts to the trained animal acts purchased in 1897 by the FitzGeralds from the German animal impresario Carl Hagenbeck. A contemporary journalist typified the response prompted by these acts when he ob- served that "[t]he novelty of these wild beast performances does not soon wear off, they are too surprising to pall and too obviously dangerous to permit of their being witnessed unmoved."8 The second part of this essay examines the symbolic mutability of the animals in the Hagenbeck acts. The study matches this popular cultural form (the circus's wild animal act) to nation-building tropes, and teases out the narratives of allegiance, patriotism, and power that were articulated through these acts during the period of Australia's involvement in the Anglo-Boer War. A Late-Colonial Australasian Circus Circus-style performance was transferred to Australia during the nineteenth century by immigrants who were familiar with contemporary English circuses. The earliest recorded circus performance in the Australian colonies was produced by Robert Radford in Launceston, Tasmania, in December 1847, and while details of Radford's background remain obscure, we can assume he was replicating the shows he had seen, enjoyed, and possibly performed in as an equestrian in England.9 During the forty-one years between Radford's first circus show in Launceston and the emergence of the FitzGerald Brothers' Circus in 1888, the circus developed in Australia as the result of cultural processes of immigration and transmission, and was intermittently nurtured by visiting international companies, whose acts were subsequently emulated by local performers. Many visiting artists also settled in the colonies, where they continued their performance careers and passed on their skills. Circus acts incorporating large exotic mammals appeared belatedly in Australia, in comparison with circus trends throughout the northern hemisphere. The earliest case of a lion tamer visiting the colonies was a performer working under the name of Don Fernandez in 1859, while in 1887 St Leon's Circus was the first Australian circus to produce a lion act, with a tamer named Professor Madden.10 By 1893, the premier Australasian circus of the era, the FitzGerald Brothers', was presenting a lion act at every performance. Although considerably smaller than the huge contemporary railroad circuses in the United States, the FitzGeralds' single-ring circus was the largest to have emerged in the Australian colonies. In 1888, the troupe coalesced out of several earlier tenting circuses and performed until 1905 on continental and trans-Tasman touring routes, which included one-night stands in remote communities at the limits of railheads and coastal steamer-transport networks as well as lengthy seasons of up to fourteen weeks in the major centers of Australia and New Zealand. The FitzGeralds' circus first came to wide colonial attention during the depression years of the early 1890s with popular 8 Melbourne Punch, 26 October 1899. 9 Mark St Leon, Spangles and Sawdust: The Circus in Australia (Richmond, Victoria, Australia: Green- house Publications, 1983), 14. 10 Mark St Leon, "Circus and Nation: A Critical Inquiry into Circus in its Australian Setting, 1847-2001, from the Perspectives of Society, Enterprise and Culture" (PhD diss., University of Sydney, 2007), 336-57.</page><page sequence="4">612 / Gillian Arrighi seasons in Melbourne and Sydney in 1892 and 1893. By the closing years of the century, its performance tent accommodated up to 7,000 people in metropolitan areas, while in many smaller towns the local timetables for tram, train, and water transport were routinely altered during the visit of the circus for the convenience and safety of its large audiences. The prosperity of the company emanated from the popular appeal it exerted across class lines and was conspicuously manifested in its huge performance pavilions which were regularly renewed and improved; its traveling menagerie of exotic and indigenous animals; its large stud of horses; and its rich costuming of perform- ers and ancillary staff. The wealth of the company was also evidenced by its regular importation of acts from the United States, Britain, and Europe - an entrepreneurial innovation not previously undertaken by other circuses in Australia. Nineteenth-century circuses customarily produced an array of advertising materials that included posters, programs, daybills (single-sided pages issued to describe the program on a particular day), and items of advance publicity such as couriers and heralds.11 Despite the enormous amount of printed matter generated by the FitzGer- alds between 1888 and 1905, very few pieces have survived in the public archives of Australia and New Zealand: two full-color posters, three double-sided heralds, and less than twenty programs and daybills constitute the sum total of extant marketing ephemera generated by this prolific company. But even if many more posters and pro- grams, daybills, couriers, and heralds survived and had been collected together, they would reveal little information other than that the circus presented performances across Australasia, and that these performances involved a large and regularly shifting group of performers. Such artifacts tell us very little about the action of the performances or the social experience of attending the circus. Contemporary newspapers constitute the principal source of information for this study. They were the circus's primary organ of communication with their public, and, taken overall, evidence gathered from the contemporary press divulges a range of voices commenting upon the circus from different points of view. The voice of the circus management can be heard through display advertising that foregrounds the acts and elements of program changes the management believed to be most attractive. Amusement-column advertisements were also the locus of response and apology from the circus management to complaints or dissatisfaction voiced by patrons at the per- formance site. At certain times, it is also possible to discern a dialog in these columns between the circus management and the public. Additionally, occasional newspaper interviews report the voices of agents, proprietors, and, less often, performers discuss- ing the operational systems and aesthetic aims of the circus. Newspapers are also the sole source of phenomenological description of circus-performance action; in reviews, we hear the voices of journalistic observers detailing the turns they enjoyed and were keen to explain, while briefly acknowledging or omitting the more familiar or otherwise less stimulating program items. The FitzGerald Brothers' Circus performance programs were altered every few days, and in the course of a lengthy metropolitan season there would be many changes as new performers were engaged and company members 11 Descriptions of the typical circus herald and courier from the nineteenth century are provided in F. D. Pfening Jr., "Circus Couriers of the Late 1800s/' Bandwagon 3, no. 1 (1959): 3-4: "A herald is usually one sheet of paper printed on both sides, approximately 10 inches wide and 29V£ inches long.

From 1893 onward, the major press outlets in the principal cities of Australasia frequently published extensive reviews of each change of program, and this close attention paid to the FitzGeralds by the press has facilitated a detailed reading of many of the circus's physical texts. Newspaper reviewers also reported on the physical and material circumstances of performances, such as the size of the tents and overall quality of circus sites, the size and social constitution of audiences, and the reception of different acts. Even a cursory analysis of the language used by the FitzGeralds in their newspaper advertising and other marketing documents issued by the company reveals that this was a politicized entertainment organization that responded to a range of political imperatives throughout its performance career. Its rapid increase in popularity and size during the early 1890s was underwritten with marketing rhetoric that colluded with the isolationist and protectionist ideologies of the newly emergent labor influ- ence in Australian politics.12 Over the course of their circus's performance history, however, the FitzGeralds were to author a variety of marketing narratives; reflecting the complex nature of Australian citizenship, they participated at times in nationalist mythologies, while at others, such as during the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902, they collaborated with political opinion that advocated Australia's role as Britain's imperial partner in the Pacific. Within the Australasian colonial context, the high-status circuses of the late nineteenth century such as the FitzGerald Brothers', and that of Frank Fillis from South Africa, can be read as harbingers of globalization. They were popular sites wherein capitalism and capitalism's globalizing impetus were enacted - they traded on their ability to "shrink the world," so to speak. Irrespective of the real or fictive geographic origins of their acrobats, equestrians, contortionists, aerialists, and animal trainers, circuses presented their companies as cosmopolitan and multiracial and therefore exotic, foreign, and unusual. When high-profile circuses such as Fillis's and the FitzGeralds' also traveled with a substantial menagerie, their "zoological gardens on wheels" brought exotic creatures from Asia and Africa to the doorsteps of small towns and communities; the living animals were tokens of their species, just as the "foreign" circus performers were tokens of their respective races - both groups consequently embodying foreign places and distant geographies. The late nineteenth-century circuses' global embrace of races and creatures enabled them to mobilize discourses of education and popular science; emulating the marketing tactics of celebrated American showmen such as P. T. Barnum and Adam Forepaugh, the FitzGeralds also explored the interactivity of natural history and popular entertainments.13 By 1893, there were only three public zoos in Australasia: in Melbourne, Adelaide, and Sydney. As a consequence, people living outside these cities had little opportu- nity to view the sorts of animals that were transported to their communities by large circuses such as Fillis's and the FitzGeralds'.14 Up until the disbanding of their circus 12 Gillian Arrighi, "Negotiating National Identity at the Circus: The FitzGerald Brothers' Circus in Melbourne, 1892," Australasian Drama Studies 54 (forthcoming). 13 Jane Goodall, Performance and Evolution in the Age of Darwin: Out of the Natural Order (London: Routledge, 2002). 14 Australia's first zoo was established in Melbourne in 1862, but it did not begin collecting exotic animals in earnest until 1870. The Adelaide Zoo was opened in 1883, and the Sydney Zoo opened a year later.</page><page sequence="6">614 / Gillian Arrighi in 1906, the FitzGeralds provided public access to some of the Australian continent's unique and rarely seen creatures, and introduced some of the planet's most impres- sive animals to the people of the region. Aside from their curiosity value, the animals were also trophies of progress and modernity: a sophisticated complex of international communication, banking, and transportation had delivered the animals from distant lands to the Australian circus proprietors. Owning these exotics therefore proved the colonial troupe's modernity and verified its connectedness to international entertain- ment networks. While signifying the high status of their owners and contributing to the popularity and commercial success of their enterprises, the regular appearance of exotic animal acts on circus programs from 1893 onward was also a modernizing trend in the Australian circus: these were some of the first acts to break the dominance of equestrian exercises on programs derived from Anglo circus traditions of the early nineteenth century. lion Shows Frank Fillis's South African Circus toured Australia and New Zealand for almost two years (1892-94) with a company that included 170 people, 95 horses and ponies, 4 lions, 1 performing tiger, and 5 elephants, "besides the usual run of monkeys, zebras [and] panthers."15 Fillis (1857-1921) arrived in Cape Town from London in 1880, and within three years had established his own circus company.16 Over the following fifteen years, he garnered a reputation in Australia, New Zealand, and colonial societies in India, the Straits Settlements, and Java as a circus producer of refined taste, a gentle- man, an elite trainer of horses and other animals, and an equestrian whose elegance and skill earned him epithets such as "centaur-like" and "the emperor of equestrians."17 Although English by birth and training, Fillis was identified as South African, and in Australia and New Zealand he was received not as a cultural emissary from Britain and the imperial center, but as a fellow colonial from South Africa - from another periphery and frontier of empire. While Australian circus historians have claimed the influence of visiting American circuses on late nineteenth-century colonial circuses, the influence of Fillis has, as yet, gone unnoticed. An analysis of the FitzGeralds' programs throughout the 1890s, when their circus was at its height of popularity, shows a direct influence from Frank Fillis.18 When Fillis opened for the first time in Sydney on 19 December 1892 and performed a popular twelve-week season, he produced a lion-taming act with two tamers, Captain 15 South Australian Express (Adelaide), 27 February 1893. 16 For information about Frank Fillis's Circus, see Floris J. G. van der Merwe, Frank Fillis: The Story of a Circus Legend (Stellenbosch, South Africa: FJG Publikasies, 2007); "The Phenomenal Fillis Circus Family in South Africa: A Biographical Summary/' African Journal for Physical, Health Education, Recreation and Dance 8, no. 2 (2002); and Carel Birkby, The Pagel Story (Cape Town: Hodder and Stoughton, 1948). 17 See the South Australian Express (Adelaide), 27 February 1893; the Sydney Morning Herald, 21 No- vember 1893; and the Illustrated Sydney News, 27 January 1893.

See also George Wirth, Round the World with a Circus: Memories of Trials, Triumphs and Tribulations, (Melbourne: Troedel and Cooper, 1925), 63-64. 18 A series of elegant equestrian acts produced by Fillis were subsequently emulated by the FitzGer- alds and retained on their programs for many years, while numerous other acts first introduced to Australia by Fillis were copied by the FitzGeralds, including acts with educated elephants, lions, and tigers; a monkey and pony steeplechase; the water pantomime scenario; and a military drama titled "Dying to Save The Colours."</page><page sequence="7">DISCOURSES IN LATE-COLONIAL AUSTRALIAN CIRCUSES / 615 W. E. Russell and Jasia Scherazade, who appeared separately on the program though with the same group of four lions (figs. 1 and 2). While audiences in England, Europe, and the United States had been exposed to lion-taming acts since the 1830s, Fillis's big-cat acts were a novelty to Australasian spectators.19 The acts caused a sensation and regularly sparked controversy of one kind or another throughout the duration of Fillis's tour of Australia and New Zealand. Reflecting the Eurocentric nature of the exotic animal trade during the late nineteenth century, Fillis purchased his lions and tiger from dealers in Europe - from either Wil- liam Cross in Liverpool, Jamrach in London, or Carl Hagenbeck, who operated out of the longtime animal-trading port of Hamburg. Fillis explained: These firms deal in wild animals, and they group them so as to get them into readiness for the performer. Strange to say you cannot get live lions in Africa. It is like a fishing village in that respect; all the best of the catch is sent away to the metropolis. The hunters who go out are in quest of skins or ivory, and they have no time to waste in trapping animals or bringing them into the settled districts. The natives get a haul now and then, but there is always a big demand for any which fall into their hands. It may seem like carrying coals to Newcastle to take lions from Europe to Africa, but still I had to do that. During the last two years I was in Africa I had a standing advertisement in every paper offering £100 for any lion cub over seven months old which was brought to me, and I did not receive a single application for the money. I gave £250 for each of the four lions I have, and then £250 for the cage, but they were all full grown and well trained. If you buy them as youngsters you have to wait a year before they can be placed in the ring, for before that age they look as harmless as puppies, while there is all the trouble of educating and feeding them, besides the risk of disease, so that from a showman's point of view it is better to wait and buy them as adults. A lion is not full grown till he is five years old.20 This interview reveals Fillis's pragmatic approach to the economics of owning and exhibiting exotic animals; he maintained a similarly pragmatic attitude to the "tamers" he employed to appear with the animals. They were paid to play a role; their job was to put the animals through a set of maneuvers with as much heroic style as possible and escape from the cage unharmed. They were not responsible for socializing, condition- ing, or training the animals, but instead had to fit in with the routines for which the animals had been prepared by the original animal dealer. Captain Russell acknowledged the precarious conditions of his employment when he observed that "a lion is far too valuable a commodity to be handled roughly, and you will find that the life of one lion is often more valuable to the proprietor than those of four lion tamers."21 Analyses of big-cat acts of the nineteenth century customarily delineate two principal styles: en douceur (also termed the "picture act"), which trained animals to work with a docile demeanor, was frequently structured to showcase the natural movement of the animals, and sometimes required them to work in mixed groups not found in the wild;22 and enferocite (or "working wild" in American circus terminology), which was 19 Big-cat taming acts by Henri Martin in France in 1831 and Isaac van Amburgh in New York in 1833 marked the first appearance of large carnivora in theatrical settings that were more stable and respect- able than fairgrounds. The lion-taming act spread to England in 1838 when Van Amburgh, formerly an animal dealer, was initially employed by Andrew Ducrow to appear at Astley's Amphitheatre and subsequently made numerous appearances at Drury Lane; see John Stokes, "'Lion Griefs': The Wild Animal Act as Theatre/' NTQ: Neiv Theatre Quarterly 20, no. 2 (2004): 138-54. 20 South Australian Express, 18 February 1893. 21 Illustrated Sydney News, 18 February 1893. 22 Antony Hippisley Coxe, A Seat at the Circus (Hamden, CT: Archon Books, 1980), 131.</page><page sequence="8">616 / Gillian Arrighi Figure 1.

The tamer would play through the task of subduing the animals while displaying to the audience his defensive accessories such as a chair to block their rush or a whip and pistol. An assistant often patrolled the outer perimeter of the cage armed with a pistol or hot irons, ready to intervene should the cats threaten the safety of the tamer. The act ultimately framed the tamer as a hero figure who, against stiff odds, gained the mastery of his hostile opponents. Russell and Scherazade both followed this pattern; however, while their respective acts were identical in structure, they were vastly different in the way they were promoted and received, and a contro- versy erupted in Sydney in late 1892 concerning the gender of the tamers. Fillis introduced "intrepid" Captain Russell to Sydney audiences at the start of the season and the city's journalists were quick to receive him as "a man born to com- 23 C. B.

The press wondered at "the awe in which he is evidently held by the lions" and marvelled at his ability to make them "thoroughly cowed."24 A journalist approvingly described Russell as "a splendid specimen of man- hood, straight as a reed, about 5 ft 10 in in his socks and muscular as a gladiator."25 In the course of the interview Russell described himself as a devil-may-care soldier of fortune; he had fought in the Zulu war and worked as a goldminer in South Africa before finding his way into the business of professional lion-taming. He referred to his lions as "treacherous," observed that his power over them emanated from a psychic strength, and confidently declared that he had never known the meaning of fear. The appellation of "Captain" in his stage name reinforced the image of a colonial mercenary from the Dark Continent, while his costume, described as a red Hussar's uniform, cited various military elements and so strengthened the stage proposal of a hero.26 24 Sydney Morning Herald, 21 and 26 November 1892. 25 Illustrated Sydney News, 21 and 26 November 1892. 26 The Argus (Melbourne), 23 January 1893.</page><page sequence="10">618 / Gillian Arrighi The act was played out in a menagerie cage that was wheeled into the circus ring and consequently was much smaller than the caged-arena spaces that were introduced to Australian circuses five years later by the FitzGerald Brothers and that became standard practice in animal exhibition during the twentieth century. In the course of the act, Russell made the four lions "skip, gambol, and leap at will just as he pleases" before forcing them to jump through flaming hoops. (Reviews from Sydney and the following season in Melbourne emphasized that Russell's primary method was force and persistence.) The climax of the act entailed one of the lions firing a pistol: the lion, named Pasha, placed his forepaws on a chair then bit a tassel attached to the trigger of a pistol, causing the weapon to discharge. Yet despite this evidence of an ability to learn a clever trick, the lions were only described in language that emphasized the base characteristics typical of the lower orders of life on earth: they were "huge and ferocious brutes" who were "surly," "sullen," and "obdurate" - terms that Rod Preece has observed are used "to elevate the conception of the human and to demean the non-human realm."27 Like all successful circus proprietors, Fillis was an expert showman who knew how to build the expectations of his public, stimulate return attendance, and thus extend the financial viability of a season. Two weeks into the season he announced a change of program in which Russell was to be replaced by Jasia Scherazade. The change of lion tamer would prove a sensation because Scherazade was the first female lion tamer ever to appear in the southern hemisphere. Fillis spotted Scherazade when she was appearing at Sanger's Amphitheatre in London in 1891. He promoted her as "the world famous lady lion tamer [with] a great reputation, principally gained on the Continent of Europe,"28 and the Parisian performer had in fact been a leading attraction at the Paris Hippodrome for several years. At just twenty-six, "fearless and graceful" Scherazade was no newcomer to animal exhibition; she had begun working with elephants in Paris twelve years earlier ("and once nearly lost my life"), and bore scars on her neck from an incident at Edwards' Circus in Denmark a few years earlier when "a lioness forgot she had my head in her mouth, and closed her teeth on my neck."29 Publicity issued during the week before Scherazade's debut in Sydney spoke of the dozen or so medals she had received from various European courts where she had performed "on command," including one presented to her by the late king of Belgium for "courage and bravery."30 Scherazade's debut was delayed, however, for a week due to a cage accident in which the pistol discharged too close to the head of the lion Pasha. Fillis deemed the lion unsuitable for performance, and throughout the week of Pasha's recovery, the circus's daily advertisements provided updates on his well-being and nervous state.31 When Scherazade finally appeared before Sydney audiences on Saturday evening, 10 December 1892, "at 10 o'clock precisely," she must have seemed a very sexy young woman to the audience. In a blue dress that exposed her arms and dropped above her ankles and with three of her gold medals pinned to her bust, she was described 27 Rod Preece, Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1999), 29. 28 Sydney Morning Herald, 3 December 1892. 29 Illustrated Sydney News, 3 December 1892. 30 Sydney Morning Herald, 2, 3, 10, and 12 December 1892. 31 Ibid., 5-10 December 1892.</page><page sequence="11">DISCOURSES IN LATE-COLONIAL AUSTRALIAN CIRCUSES / 619 by one journalist as "the beautiful and daring lion queen."32 In a feature article about Fillis's circus, a journalist omitted any discussion of Scherazade's performance, instead extolling her physical attractiveness. Describing her as "a chic French woman, with a prettily turned figure of middle height, a pair of steadfast eyes, and a delightful suspi- cion of a foreign accent," he thought her "firm underlip is indicative of decision, and the manner is that of one born to command." He also recorded that she had a quiet manner of speech, a strong sense of conviction, and concluded that "she is a splendid example of the power of kindness over the rough brute tribe."33 Allowing for the omittance of the pistol-discharge trick by Pasha, Scherazade's routine was identical to Russell's - even to the point in the act when one of the lions hit out at her with his paw before being forced into submission. She made the lions walk around her in a circle, drove them into the corners of the cage, caused them to jump first over hurdles and then through flaming hoops, and ended the performance by driving them into a corner with pistol shots before exiting the cage to cheers of acclamation and a lengthy ovation. Unfortunately for Scherazade, this was her only performance as a lion queen in Australia; on the following Monday, Inspector Brem- ner of Sydney's constabulary informed Fillis that he had received instructions from Sir George Dibbs prohibiting Scherazade's appearance in the lion cage. Subsequently, Captain Russell returned to the program. Government closure of performances by female daredevils had been occurring with regularity in England since the 1870s, and had led to the imposition of laws such as the Dangerous Performances Bill (1879), which proscribed the participation of children and women in performances that threatened life or limb.34 No such laws existed in the colonies of Australia and public outcry against Dibbs's censorship was vociferous, with complaints and ridicule published in several leading journals.35 In an act of equitable dealing, shortly after banning the appearance of Scherazade, Premier Dibbs also forced Russell's perfor- mances to cease. The city's press championed the rights of the tamers to decide whether they wished to put themselves at risk: "For our Government to set themselves up as censors of a performance which has been passed and approved by the whole of the rest of the civilised world, is nothing less than a piece of unwarrantable presumption."36 Frank Fillis quietly accepted the government censorship and proceeded with his circus season, producing a water pantomime as a replacement attraction during the Christmas holiday period. Premier Dibbs and Fillis subsequently negotiated terms, and several weeks later Captain Russell again tamed lions in the circus ring. Jasia Scherazade, however, was never reinstated to the program. Whatever the substance of the agreement between Dibbs and Fillis, the original gendered grounds for the cen- sorship were contravened late in January 1893: on the closing night of the season, the actress Edith Blande entered the lion cage during Russell's performance.37 Far from ^2 Ibid., 12 December 1892. 33 Illustrated Sydney News, 12 December 1892. 34 For a discussion of the Dangerous Performances Bill and its effect on performances by women and children in England during the latter decades of the nineteenth century, see the chapter "Women on Top: Female Acrobats and Dangerous Performances," in Brenda Assael, The Circus and Victorian Society (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2005). 35 The Bulletin (Sydney), 24 December 1892; Illustrated Sydney News, 17 December 1892. ^Illustrated Sydney News, ibid. 37 Ibid., 14 January 1893.</page><page sequence="12">620 / Gillian Arrighi being an impromptu affair off the political radar, Blande's polite, face-to-face meeting with the lions was heralded in the city's press as a drawcard to the final show and made mockery of Dibbs's censorship of Scherazade's lion-queen performance earlier in the season. Before analyzing the controversy surrounding Fillis's lion acts in Sydney in December 1892, I want to briefly extend my discussion to another series of events surrounding the lion-taming act that occurred six months later. In July 1893, Frank Fillis returned to Sydney and installed his show in the Exhibition Building, in competition with the local FitzGeralds' circus. Russell had left Fillis's circus after being knocked down and injured by Pasha during the opening night of the circus's first season in Melbourne, and a tamer named John Cox was now working with the Fillis lions (thereby verify- ing Russell's observation about the disparate value to circus proprietors of lions and their tamers).38 The FitzGerald Brothers' Circus, meanwhile, had been enjoying a phenomenally successful run in the colonial capital.39 Just nine days after Fillis's return to Sydney, the FitzGeralds responded hastily to the competition posed by his popular lion act by producing a lion-taming act of their own, with the "intrepid tamer" Captain Hum- phreys and his "Performing Lions." In a curious twist of events, Humphreys was the husband of Jasia Scherazade, although he appears to have been less skilled as a per- former than his wife.40 Humphreys also came to Australia with Fillis from South Africa and his act emulated that of Russell. The FitzGeralds' advertisements drew attention to the conflict in the opposition "between brute ferocity and human masterfulness," using the adjectives "thrilling," "stirring," and "strenuous" to promote the contest, and feting Humphreys for evincing admirable male qualities such as forcefulness and "a superlative amount of pluck and willpower."41 The FitzGeralds' lions were young and, although bred in captivity, had not been acclimatized to the proximity of humans nor accustomed over time to the conditions and expectations of performance. Hum- phreys's behavior in the lion cage demonstrated more bravado than skill as nightly he whipped the untrained cats into a confused frenzy, though on the fifth night the lions retaliated by mauling him.42 With a twist of marketing ingenuity, the FitzGerald circus management announced that Humphreys was "himself the lion of the hour" - a com- ment suggesting an anthropomorphic translation of the tamer from heroic human to king of the natural realm.43 Despite the deep wound to his arm, Humphreys returned to the cage the following night and maintained his act throughout the remainder of the season. Russell and Humphreys both exemplify the en ferocite style of lion training, which Bouissac has analyzed using the poetic concept of metonymy: "When sheer strength is spectacularly apparent the outcome appears to be the result of a continuous concatena- tion of causes and effects with no gaps. ... In this case, the superiority of the trainer is 38 The Arvus, 14 January 1893. 39 The FitzGerald Brothers' Circus season ran for 118 performances from 22 May-19 August 1893. Fillis's second season in Sydney opened on 1 July 1893. 40 Scherazade also appeared on the FitzGerald Brothers' Circus program during this season in a hu- man cannonball act. The spelling of her name was changed slightly to "Iasia." 41 Sydney Morning Herald, 22 July 1893 (advertisement). 42 Ibid., 24 July 1893; The Bulletin (Sydney), 29 July 1893; The Press (Christchurch, New Zealand), 2 August 1893. 43 Sydney Morning Herald, 22 July 1893.</page><page sequence="13">DISCOURSES IN LATE-COLONIAL AUSTRALIAN CIRCUSES / 621 signified by a process of contiguity, the equivalent. of a realistic description in a liter- ary text/'44 The displays by Russell and Humphreys were metonymic in construction because to some degree at least, a real conflict actually took place in the cage between the lions and their human antagonist. The former were tokens of the animal world; in the audience's mind, they may have also represented the lions' native territory in Asia and Africa as well as the indigenous peoples who shared those geographies. Subjugation of the lions and all they stood for by white males was considered cultur- ally acceptable in New South Wales during 1892-93, as further evinced by the fact that Premier Dibbs and members of his ministry sanctioned Humphreys' s act with their attendance, and "at frequent intervals expressed their appreciation of the efforts of the performers to afford satisfaction."45 In seeking to tease out the reasons why two men received political sanction to tame lions during this period while a woman did not, it is important to recognize that al- though the reason for the censorship was based nominally on the issue of gender, there were other, more complex cultural determinants at work. Unveiling the subtextual layers of the different lion shows reveals something about both this particular colonial society and its attitudes toward acceptable gender demonstrations at this particular time in history. The texts of the Russell /Humphreys acts delivered a simple and culturally acceptable narrative in which a white male presented himself to the public as a hero, and also evinced the ideal male hegemonic qualities of courage, forcefulness, and determination to prove his dominance and mastery over brute nature. The lions were "not a natural event" so much as they were symbols of primitive nature in a narrative underpinned with broad assumptions reflecting social Darwinism and imperialism.46 The opposi- tions of culture versus nature, and civilization versus wildness, were integral elements of the imperial story of progress that were also articulated in the taming displays of Humphreys and Russell. The reasoning white male was positioned at the head of the social order, and even though he was mauled in contradiction to his narrative, the lion tamer was lauded even more robustly for his logical and stoic response; for example, at the close of his act, the hero (Humphreys) showed he was a reasoning and subtle being when he "kneel[ed] close before [the lions] with folded arms [before retiring] amid a salvo of applause."47 Scherazade's act was not censored because she was a sexy and attractive female put- ting herself at risk. The late nineteenth-century circus always presented risky acts by performers of both genders and was a site for covert sexual appreciation of women's nearly nude bodies. No other employment created such muscular and athletic female forms, and no woman in colonial Australia exposed so much of her body to voyeuristic scrutiny - via active movement and from all observational perspectives - as the circus equestrienne, contortionist, and aerialist. The circus provided an arena for education about the female form that was, in normal society, concealed. Even so, Scherazade's act with the lions tipped the balance of acceptability. Because the scenic structure of it was the same as Russell's, it has to be considered that her embodied performance 44 Bouissac, "Poetics in the Lions' Den," 105. 45 Sydney Morning Herald, 22 July 1893. 46 Bouissac, "Poetics in the Lions' Den," 95. 47 Sydney Morning Herald, 24 July 1893.</page><page sequence="14">622 / Gillian Arrighi as a woman opened up a whole range of interpretations that pressed the margins of acceptability at the time. When questioned about the danger of her profession, Scherazade gave a response that provides a clue to her performance: "But why do you call it dangerous? I love my animals, and they love me, and what have I to fear? ... I am not afraid of them, and they know it."48 In her essay about female daredevils during the late nineteenth century, Helen Day has observed that an act that proposed the illusion of a loving and gentle relationship between a female tamer and her dangerous male beasts was origi- nally referred to as "la fiancee des lions" - the lions' bride.49 Scherazade's act probably fitted this trope, and her theatrical presentation of an overtly dangerous yet loving relationship was further connoted by the stage name Scherazade, which recalled the resourceful female lover of the Arabian Nights. Complete with pistol, whip, and decollete, the role she presented was a hybridization of the female dominatrix and the attentive lover, the subtext suggesting a sexual rela- tionship. Scherazade's brief appearance was quickly censored because it was deemed transgressive of the norms governing acceptable feminine behavior, but more particu- larly because it undermined the dominant patriarchy of colonial society. By contrast, the story enacted by Russell and Humphreys contained none of the irrationality associ- ated with womankind by Victorian society nor the irrationality associated with loving relationships, least of all the kind in which a transgressive subtext of bestial sexuality could be read. Their acts with the lions "transmitted ideologies which sustained com- mon values and beliefs."50 According to the prevailing cultural attitudes of late-colonial Australia, narratives of progress by dominant white males were acceptable, while the unstable meaning of Scherazade's act was not. Frank Fillis departed Australia in late 1894 after a sojourn of nearly two years. The FitzGeralds maintained a lion-taming act for two more years, employing a succession of captains, majors, and "modern-day Daniels" who took their chances with the un- trained lions and at times fell prey, quite literally, to the poorly socialized animals.51 The FitzGeralds' circus never presented the lion- taming act again after early 1895; indeed, no large, exotic mammals of any kind appeared in its ring until late 1897, when the circus purchased performing animals from Carl Hagenbeck in Hamburg. The style of circus acts involving large exotic animals changed throughout the latter years of the nineteenth century, from theatrical frames that specified the brutality and imminent threat of the animals, to settings that personified and sentimentalized them. That trend was due, in some measure, to the methods of Hagenbeck and other European animal trainers, though certain cultural factors also influenced the shift from exhibitions of violent subjugation, to demonstrations of the outcomes of training systems based on sympathy and patience. The latter approach, vernacularly termed "humane," was an outgrowth of the desire for enlightened and moral progress that characterized changes 48 Illustrated Sydney News, 21 January 1893. 49Helen Day, "Female Daredevils/' in The New Woman and Her Sisters: Feminism and Theatre, 1850-1914, ed.

The Lion he gobbles a meaty snack While Lizzie is pedalling round the track, And the women are watching in gladsome dread For the Lion to gobble the keeper's head - 55 By the 1890s, Carl Hagenbeck (1844-1913) was internationally known as an animal dealer, animal trainer, circus owner, and entrepreneur of ethnographic people shows. Circus histories customarily cite Hagenbeck as "the gentler" - the first trainer to insti- gate patient methods based on the need to read the intrinsic personalities of animals (although, despite the persistence of this claim, a number of other trainers in England and Europe were also experimenting with similar gentle methods throughout the second half of the nineteenth century).56 Hagenbeck maintained that animals were cognitive beings whose "intelligence differs from the human in degree only, not in kind."57 His dealings with high-profile zoos and circuses placed him in a crucial posi- tion within the global entertainment industry. His methods of training animals were hailed by contemporaries as modern and innovative; he emerged as the best-known animal entrepreneur of the late nineteenth century and is historically credited with revolutionizing the circus animal act. 52 For a detailed analysis of changing attitudes to animals throughout the nineteenth century, see James C. Turner, Reckoning with the Beast: Animals, Pain, and Humanity in the Victorian Mind (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980). 53 Concern for the welfare of horses was the guiding principle for the establishment of the first animal welfare society in Australia, the Victorian Society for the Protection of Animals, in 1871. The other colonies soon established similar pressure groups: Tasmania, 1872; New South Wales, 1873; South Australia, 1875; Queensland, 1883; and Western Australia, 1892. The Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was established in 1882; the Children's Protection Society of Victoria (Australia) was established in 1896. ^Rothfels, Savages and Beasts, 156. 55 Excerpt from a poem about the FitzGeralds' show, written by a contributor to The Bulletin and published 14 January 1899. 56 Trainers Frank Bostock and Francis and Joseph Farari were using humane methods of animal training in the 1890s.

The cramped cage that had been wheeled in to the circus ring for the lion- taming exhibitions of 1893-95 was replaced by a spacious enclosure erected around the circumference of the ring's forty-two-foot diameter. But it was not only the scenography and visual framing of the animal acts that underwent a transformation from the earlier lion shows: a "trainer" replaced the earlier "tamer," and Hagenbeck's associate, Ernest Zapf, functioned as the moderator of the scenarios rather than the catalyst of the action. Beyond this change, the thematic structure of the animal routines was also significantly altered: the Hagenbeck acts exemplified a stylistic shift from en ferocite to en douceur, from displays that enraged the animals and showcased their dangerous capabilities, to scenic narratives for which groups of animals had been trained to play roles. One of the scenarios displayed Lizzie the elephant frolicking with her "playmates" and suggested a family unit where Zapf was a paternal figure, guiding the recreation of his animal children and ensuring that they played together nicely. A feminized apron tied around the elephant's neck coded her as a little girl. The narrative segments of the act - Lizzie rolling a barrel with a pony, proving her manners at the dinner table, being served by a terrier dressed as a waiter, and playing musical instruments with a monkey - were representations of children at play under the watchful eye of a firm though generous father or pedagogue. In contrast with the goaded lions of earlier years, the Hagenbeck animals were well mannered; in keeping with the proposition of a happy family, the tempered behavior of the well-brought-up "children" attested to the intelligence and governed reason of the parental humans who trained and guided them.58 Journalistic observers of the circus recorded that Zapf spent a great deal of his day just sitting with young lions that were being groomed for performance; in keeping with Hagenbeck's training principles, Zapf regarded his relationship with the animals as that of a patient teacher to students.59 In another Hagenbeck act, Lizzie the elephant was again the principal player, along with a large, heavily maned lion named Prince. The Great Lion and Elephant Act, as the scenario came to be called, had several distinct scenes. Following the entry and presentation of Zapf with his animal charges, the first heightened moment showcased the natural movement of the lion, who leaped from a platform onto the back of the elephant, where he seated himself on a velvet-padded howdah (fig. 3). One of the elephant's tasks in the scene was to raise the flags of three countries, and newspapers recorded that the flags of Germany, Great Britain, and Australia were raised while the circus band played patriotic music particular to each country. The climax of the act occurred when Lizzie, with the lion on her back, mounted a specially constructed tricycle, which she rode slowly around the ring. Her front feet pedaled while she steered the handlebar with her trunk and the band accompanied with either "Daisy Bell" or "A Bicycle Built for Two." One journalist observed that the German flag "took precedence of both the British flag . . . and the Australian flag,"60 a choice that could perhaps be explained by the 58 Descriptions of the act have been gathered from the Barrier Miner (Broken Hill, New South Wales), 30 November 1897; Sydney Morning Herald, 23 December 1897; and the New Zealand Mail, 3 March 1898. 59 The Bulletin, 28 January 1899. e°West Australian, 5 October 1897.</page><page sequence="17">DISCOURSES IN LATE-COLONIAL AUSTRALIAN CIRCUSES / 625 Figure 3.

However, another subtext can be read here: during the 1890s, German colonial expansion in the Pacific was considered a threat to the security of the Australian colonies and a threat to Britain's economic dominance in the region.61 If the elephant and flag act is considered in the light of British and Australian fears about Germany's expansionist aims in the Pacific, the flag interlude appears to be an amelioration of these fears - a popular gesture of "hands across the water," the circus's contribution to positive international relations with the imperial power of Germany. Even without pondering too deeply on the privileging of the German flag, the scene held another, more immediate political significance for audiences. To talk about an 61 Part 2, 'The Pacific Perspective/' in The German Empire and Britain's Pacific Domi7iions, 1871-1919, ed. J. A. Moses and C. Pugsley (Claremont, CA: Regina Books, 2000).</page><page sequence="18">626 / Gillian Arrighi Australian flag in 1897 was premature, as there was no authorized flag of Australia until federation in 1901. From the middle of the nineteenth century many unofficial flags had been flown, but each one incorporated the constellation of the Southern Cross, which was universally accepted as the symbol for the Great South Land. Nevertheless, in 1897, the Union Jack was the official flag of the Australasian colonies, and so the division, in this performance, of the Union Jack from the flag representing the Great South Land was a popular political gesture of nationalism and separation. During the years 1896-1900, the FitzGeralds promoted the Hagenbeck animals as their headline acts, and enthusiastic reviews from across Australia and New Zealand reveal that these performances were a genuine novelty and maintained a broad appeal. In contrast to the earlier lion shows, Hagenbeck' s scenarios evolved with a moderately sustained tempo rather than the fast and furious action that had characterized the dis- plays of lion taming. Instead of focusing on the heroic acting of a tamer, audiences were enthralled by animals that displayed "culturally determined mode[s] of behaviour . . . associated with particular human social situation[s]."62 The metaphorical structure of these acts distanced the animals from their natural behaviors and native geographies; a FitzGerald advertisement even suggested that the instincts and natures of their new animals had somehow undergone a translation from wildness to domestication: Lions riding elephants, tigers riding ponies, elephants riding bicycles . . . the main feature of this wonderful entertainment is that by the aid of new developments in training, all danger is eliminated, and the lions and tigers perform their various evolutions like intel- ligent domestic animals. Timid women and children will no longer be frightened by roaring and infuriated beasts goaded on by force, but the beautiful animals obey their trainer as willingly as dogs or elephants.63 The lions, tigers, and elephants of this text were neither fierce nor dangerous; their natures had been overwritten as friendly and benign, as if they were characters from a child's storybook that had materialized in the circus ring (figs. 4 and 5). Resonances of War The circus genre is characterized by an essential lack of fixity that allows its acts to be open to change; consequently, the circus can respond more quickly than the theatre to prevailing shifts in the cultural or political tenor of its time. As the circus negotiated its way through the shifting political and cultural trends during the years 1897-1900, the Hagenbeck animal acts were altered in direct response to events in the wider world of Australian politics. The acts were subtly changed at different times to articulate Australia's international allegiances, which arose, in turn, from the British imperial legacy that continued to shape Australian politics. The outbreak of war in South Africa in October 1899 and the subsequent deployment of soldiers and horses from Australia and New Zealand impacted the FitzGeralds' shows, where anxieties related to the war were openly manifested from late 1899. Historian Luke Trainor has observed that if Australian support for the war in South Africa was a timely addition to the British forces, then the war was also "timely for imperial and Australian closer union."64 62 Bouissac, "Poetics in the Lions' Den," 106. 63 Sydney Morning Herald, 18 December 1897. 64 Luke Trainor, British Imperialism and Australian Nationalism: Manipulation, Conflict, and Compromise in the Late Nineteenth Century (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 153.</page><page sequence="19">DISCOURSES IN LATE-COLONIAL AUSTRALIAN CIRCUSES / 627 Figure 4.

Von der Mehden's customary musical introduction to the program became a "patriotic overture," and the act that followed - a leaping exhibition by the company's acrobats - reintroduced a martial reference to the mise-en-scene. Normally, the acrobats leapt over an increasing number of horses placed side by side in the ring, with the star leaper performing the climactic action with a huge leap or double somersault from a springboard over twenty horses. Late in 1899, one of the acrobats performed a double somersault over twenty-five guns held in an upright position by the same number of ring hands, prompting the reviewer from the Adelaide Advertiser to observe that the "fixed bayonets would have struck awe into the soul of the wily Boer."65 Bayonets had been introduced into the act years earlier, but with the deployment of Australians to South Africa came a sharpened consciousness of the Australian public's new enemy. Grand "military nights" were arranged to honor and bid farewell to the Second South Australian Contingent, and at least one of these programs was augmented with displays of weapons handling, drill formation, and brass-band interludes performed by the soldiers. During a tour of New Zealand several months later, The Press of Christchurch recorded that "the news of the entry of Lord Roberts into Bloemfontein was given from the ring, and was received with loud cheers."66 It was not long before the Great Lion and Elephant Act - transformed with very little scenic adjustment into a community show of patriotism - began to vent partisan sentiments. Instead of receiving the lion as iconic of the wild and primitive parts of the planet, audiences began to read the lion as being symbolic of the imperial might of Britain and, by inference, of her colonial allies. The elephant upon which he rode was simultaneously interpreted as symbolic of the Kruger-led forces in South Africa. Thus, the act came to symbolize the hopeful triumph of the British and her colonial allies in South Africa. The music accompanying the act was altered to patriotic airs glorifying Britannia, the audience waved Union Jacks, and the lion, seated majestically high upon the back of the elephant, "survey[ed] the multitude with complacent magnificence." One observer in New Zealand noted that "it goes without saying there is not a Boer present who would like to tackle the pulling down of those flags."67 Scenes demonizing the South African leader were played out on popular stages in London and Sydney during the latter months of 1899, with pantomimes in both cities capitalizing on the public's desire to see Kruger derided.68 The FitzGerald Brothers' Circus produced scenic images that lampooned Kruger, and the lion and elephant act provided the catalyst for these expressions of popular imperialism. Paul Kruger left South Africa and went into exile in October 1900; that same month, the act was further encoded with symbols that unequivocally mocked the South African leader when the elephant was provided with a top hat and a Kruger beard. In the same month, the 65 The Advertiser (Adelaide), 22 December 1899. 66 The Press (Christchurch, New Zealand), 16 March 1900. b7N.Z.

The sketch artist depicted Lizzie wearing the top hat and Kruger beard and also captured a turn of the clowns titled "The Boer Act/' in which one clown held a rifle to another clown who held up a white flag of surrender.69 During this period, some voices in Australia were raised in opposition to the country's support of the war in South Africa, but the circus promulgated a populist attitude toward it, and through small but effective changes to key acts, reinforced the politically conservative idea of close ties with Britain. Conclusion Audiences received the Hagenbeck animal acts as thrilling and exciting, because they played with expectations about the behavioral norms governing the natural order of life on earth. One reviewer noted that when he saw on the posters around his city the image of a lion riding an elephant, he thought it was merely a circusian fantasy concocted to attract patrons to the show.70 That observation in turn illuminates one of the crucial aspects of these acts and their reception: they were constructed at the edge of believability, and were received at the edge of feasibility; such acts could only be believed if they were witnessed firsthand. These wild animal acts exemplified the apogee of human control and mastery over nature. In defiance of natural behavior, the trainer had taught large animals, which were synonymous with the wild and primitive regions of Africa and Asia, to be submissive and to play out scenarios representing civilized human interaction. Animals of species that did not coexist in the wild had been trained to tolerate one another and to overcome the instincts that governed the relationship between predator and prey.71 The Hagenbeck animal acts of the late 1890s differed substantially in terms of their scenic framing, tempo, and narrative structure from the aggressive displays of lion taming during 1892-93. Yet, although substantially different training ideologies and techniques underpinned each style of animal act, a comparable metanarrative about the progress and sophistication of Western European culture can be read running strongly through all of these animal performances. Influenced by the popular political imperatives of the day, the human producers of these acts also managed to reduce the animals to scenographic units with variable legibility, then manipulated them within stage scenarios, the themes of which reinforced popular values and ideologies. At the start of this essay, I suggested that popular animal performances are never simply about animals: when we interrogate animal acts within a broader grid of politics and popular culture and thus mobilize contextual evidence in our readings, the acts are revealed as cultural productions through which humans are talking to other humans, not about animals or humanity's vexed relationship with animals, but about ourselves, our society, and our culture. 69 The Bulletin, 13 October 1900. 70 The Mercury (Hobart, Australia), 10 March 1899. 71 Rothfels has described Hagenbeck' s proclivity for developing acts between animals of the preda- tor and prey classes as his seeking to create a fictional paradise (Savages and Beasts, 152-62). Since the 1830s, showmen such as Van Amburgh had attempted to create paradisal tableaux wherein the lion literally did lay down with the lamb per the biblical references in Isaiah 11:6 (see Stokes, "'Lion Griefs'"). Hagenbeck perpetuated this trope, but his methods of achieving such unnatural behavior were different from his predecessors'.</page></plain_text>
