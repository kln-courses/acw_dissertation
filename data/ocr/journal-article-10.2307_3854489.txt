<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GOD NEHEBKAU BY ALAN W. SHORTER SOME time ago, when describing two statuettes of Sakhmet or Bastet for the Journal, my attention was drawn to the representations of serpent-demons which often adorn the thrones of these goddesses. In particular I became interested in Nehebkau, who appears to be one of the demons there depicted, and was surprised to find how little is said about him in standard books on the Egyptian religion. The following paper attempts to collect the available information concerning him, and to determine his true character. The Name Full writing DJuu Ai Nhbw-k;w; other writings j;J,L, x;JU U, etc. The expression nhb khw is explained by the Wb. d. aeg. Spr. (ii, 291) as literally "to make the kas nhb ", the meaning being " to appoint positions " (Wiirden verleihen o. d.) ; when the word knu has a pronominal suffix added, then the meaning is "to make so-and-so's kas nhb ", i.e. "to bestow dignities upon so-and-so".1 In certain passages2 of the Pyramid Texts the glorified king is said to perform this action in regard to gods and spirits, where the antithesis of nhb appears to be nhm "to take away". Thus the epithet NThbw-k;w would mean "bestower of dignities", "he who appoints the positions", i.e. of the gods and of the dead, and we must abandon former suggested renderings which give it a sinister meaning, such as " qui subjugue les kas ",3 or " the Overturner of Doubles".4 Iconography The god appears in the following forms: (1) As a serpent. The one descriptive passage in the Pyramid Texts (§ 1146, see below), in which he is said to possess "numerous coils ", and to be a " snake " (.hfvw), does not indicate the species to which he was supposed to belong, but other evidence suggests that he was not, at all events originally, an uraeus. In the Book of Am Duat he is represented in pictorial form in the Fourth Division, the kingdom of Sokar (Fig. 1).5 Here we see Nehebkau in the form of a huge serpent which has two heads on separate necks, its tail also ending in a head. The latter head is grasped by a god in human form who is called J- * rb-D;t, who holds a curious staff with curled end in his other hand. The serpent is stated to be -JUi and the descriptive text6 above him reads: He is in this fashion at his abode of the water- 1 See Sethe, Dramatische Texte zu altaegypt. Mysterienspielen, 63, for this and also for the meaning of k;w, hmwswt, etc. For examples demonstrating this use of nhb see also Journal, 16, 197, note 16, and references there quoted. I owe these references to Professor Blackman. 2 §§ 311, 315, 512. 3 E.g., Speleers, Les Textes des Pyramides egyptiennes, p. 27, etc. 4 E.g., W. M.

Nehebkau is frequently found in this form among the small faience figures of deities of the Late Period ;2 the hands are raised to the mouth or proffer small vessels of food or drink; the trunk of the creature FIG. 1. sometimes thickens into the semblance of a human or animal body. This form of Nehebkau also occurs on the thrones of statuettes of the goddesses Sakhmet and Bastet,3 in the com- pany of other strange serpents which resemble those depicted in the illustrations of the Underworld Books. A wooden figure in the British Museum (No. 11779) shows Nehebkau offering an Uzat, and he appears on the Metternich stela performing the same function (Fig. 2).4 (3) As a man with a snake's head. An example of this form may perhaps be recognized (Fig. 3) on one of the magical wands of ivory in the British Museum (No. 18175),5 where FIG. 2. FIG. 3. a snake-headed god appears kneeling and grasping a serpent in each hand. The semi- anthropomorphic form, however, is better known in statuettes, although these are somewhat rare, e.g., Nos. 11517 and 46676 in the British Museum. 1 Var. "breath of his mouth", P.

The following may be certainly regarded as referring to the serpent-god whom we are considering: (1) Pyr. Texts, § 1146. The deceased king is identified with Nehebkau. The parallel versions given by Sethe are: Pepi: He is Nehebkau of numerous coils. Merenrer: Merenrec is a serpent (hf;w) of numerous coils. (2) Pyr. Texts, § 229. This passage occurs in a spell directed against serpents which are hostile to the dead. 0 thou adze of Atum which is upon the vertebra of Nehebkau, which brings to an end the strife in Hermopolis, fall! Perish! (3) Pyr. Texts, §§ 487 ff. Nehebkau is mentioned with Selchis as his consort. Recitation: Homage unto thee, Horus, in the regions of Horus! Homage unto thee, Seth, in the regions of Seth! Homage unto thee, laru, in the Fields of Iaru! Homage unto you, Wise (?) Pair,1 (daughters of) the four gods who are in the Great House, who are come forth naked at the voice of Wenis! Wenis has beheld you as Horus beholds Isis! Wenis has beheld you as Nehebkau beholds Selchis! Wenis has beheld you as Sobk beholds Neith! Wenis has beheld you as Seth beholds the Wise (?) Pair! (4) Book of Am Duat, Fourth Division. See above p. 41. (5) Book of Am Duat,2 the Sun-god says: Behold, I pass the Impassable Place, I pass to greet Osiris. 0 Nehebkau in thy cavern, with lifted (?) head, great one, serpent fierce of look, behold, I pass the Impassable Place, I pass to greet Osiris. (6) Book of the Dead, Spell 125, Negative Confession.3 Here he is included among the forty-two Assessors, where he is mentioned in the company of three other serpents, i;, 1X i J ; Nhb-nfrt, .q2 L Dsr-tp, and J , In-c.f. The epithets accompanying these names vary in the different manuscripts, but the words "coming forth from his cavern", which suggest Underworld connexions, can be found applied to each in turn, including Nehebkau himself. Of his three companions: (a) Nhb-nfrt is not found elsewhere. The name is obviously an epithet parallel to Nhb-k;w, and must mean "Assigner of good" (or, with nfrt in the plural, "good things"). (b) Dsr-tp, "Splendid (or, holy) of head", appears in Pyr. Texts, § 401, where, together with other beings, he assists the deceased king to obtain his meal off the slaughtered gods: It is Dsr-tp who watches them for Teti, and drives them to him. In § 438 Dsr-tp occurs together with In-dl.f as serpents dangerous to the deceased, who are destroyed by the lynx (m;fdt): Recitation: The lynx springs upon the neck of In-dif, she returns to (or, attacks again) the neck of Dsr-tp. 1 The pair of goddesses named ' o . 2 H.

SHORTER (c) In-r.f also occurs in Book of the Dead, Spell 17, section 23,1 where the gloss explains that he is " that god, secret of forms, whose eyebrows are the beams of the balance ", from whom the deceased begs the Sun-god to deliver him "on that night of reckoning with the Robber". It seems quite possible that this name In-r-f owes its existence to a mis- understanding of the name of the serpent In-di.f ( ujA )) , who occurs in Pyr. Texts, § 438, quoted above, which could easily have arisen if the name was ever written with - n instead of A. So far we have only considered those passages in the texts which refer without doubt to the serpent-deity whom we are studying, but there exists also a number of passages which speak of a being called Nehebkau where it is possible to understand the name as an epithet of the Sun-god.2 The most important are as follows: (1 a) Pyr. Texts, § 339: They (the gods ?) bring to him those four eldest spirits who are in front of the tresses of Horus, who stand in the east of the sky, adorned with their sceptres. They tell the beautiful name of this Wenis to Rer, they announce this Wenis to Nehebkau. (2 a) Pyr. Texts, § 346: Teti is summoned by Rjr, food (?-1-ht) is given to him by Neehebkau as to Horus, as to the Horizon-dweller. Further on, in § 348, the four Horuses are mentioned again, being described as those four gods who stand upon the sceptres of the sky. They are summoned by the king that they may tell the name of Teti to RBr, and proclaim his name to Horus-of-the-Horizon, the latter god here replacing Nehebkau in a formula very similar to that of § 340. (3 a) Pyr. Texts, § 355: They (the gods) call to this Pepy, they bring to this Pepy the beings with tresses of hair who stand upon their sceptres in the eastern half of the sky, and they tell the beautiful name of Pepy to RBr, they proclaim the beautiful name of Pepy to Nehebkau. (4 a) Pyr. Texts, § 360: Addressing the gods: Bring to this Pepy those four brothers who pass by, beings with tresses of hair, who sit upon their sceptres in the eastern half of the sky! Tell ye then the beautiful name of this Pepy to Nehebkau! (5 a) Pyr. Texts, § 1708: Bring those four dwellers-in-the-region (i3tyw), who sit upon their sceptres, who come forth from the east of the sky, that they may proclaim this thy beautiful praise, which thy daughter the cow has given (lit. spoken) to thee, to Nehebkau, and Nehebkau shall proclaim this thy beautiful praise to the two Enneads.

(Pap. of Knn;). It might, however, be contended that the name, with K; in singular and serpent determinative, is a miswriting for a mere epithet nlb-k;w, and that we should translate " O Appointer of positions in the Mrndtt- barque ", or else "in life and well-being, 0 Nehebkau, in the Mcnft-barque", the sun-god being meant in both cases. 5 Budge, op. cit., Ii, 270. 6 Budge, op. cit., i, 277-8. 7 Cf. Pyr. Texts, § 511, where Naru has this title. 8 Budge, op. cit., III, 90, 91. 9 Both these names mean "with hair awry over the brow", as a sign of mourning. See Wb. d. aeg. Spr., sub voce.

SHORTER Now it may be admitted at once that the application of the epithet "appointer of posi- tions" to the Sun-god, in his capacity of celestial king who "appoints the positions" of the gods and blessed dead who are in his following, would be very natural, and it is possible (though not certain) that the mention of Nehebkau parallel with Rer in the passages (Ia- 7a) quoted above from the Pyramid Texts is equivalent to another mention of the Sun-god himself. But on the other hand there seems to be no evidence for construing the name in these cases merely as an epithet of the Sun-god, for we have seen that another passage in the Pyramid Texts (§ 1146, taking the two versions together) quite definitely describes Nehebkau as "a serpent of numerous coils", and other evidence demonstrates equally plainly the existence of an independent being called Nehebkau. Moreover, although the snake-deter- minative ..- of the name is not employed at all in the Pyramid Texts it is very frequent indeed in the passages quoted from the Book of the Dead (New Kingdom), and is used even in the passage 9 a, which more especially might be understood as referring to the Sun-god. We would rather suggest therefore that in the passages quoted, if we are to assume at all that the Sun-god is meant by the name Nehebkau, he is identified with the demon, whose name expresses so well the Sun-god's kingly function, and who is perhaps even regarded as a form of him, and further, that even the express application to the Sun-god (or any other deity)' of the epithet nhb-k;w would probably come to imply this. At any rate, in most of the passages collected above, it seems to be quite satisfactory to understand Nehebkau as a distinct entity, the snake-demon himself, standing in close association with the Sun-god, and this is the view which I have adopted in drawing up, from the collected evidence, the following account of the demon. It will be seen that only one passage certainly mentions Nehebkau as an enemy, i.e., No. 2, where he is attacked by the Sun-god Atum. The existence of this evil role, how- ever, is also demonstrated by his inclusion among the many fearsome deities and demons who make up the forty-two assessors of the tribunal of Osiris. But, like other ferocious deities,2 he could be placated and won over as a friend, and it is mainly in this aspect that he appears in Egyptian religious texts. In the Pyramid Texts he would seem to have become a powerful and no doubt sinister associate of the Sun-god himself, whose good offices are solicited on behalf of the deceased king, that he may announce the latter's name and rank to Rer, who will then receive him into his kingdom. In one passage the king even goes so far as to identify himself with Nehebkau.3 This association with Rer of a dangerous god as his servant makes us think of the "savage-faced messengers" with whom, in the Contendings of Horus and Seth, Osiris says the underworld abounds, and whom he threatens to send against the vacillating Ennead.4 It is, then, the favourable aspect of this deity as the Sun-god's attendant which was developed at the expense of his evil character, and the name given to him, " Appointer-of-positions ", definitely raised him up from the lower orders of wicked demons to the entourage of Rec, associated him with the four Horuses of the eastern sky, and even gave him a place in the solar barque. In this last-mentioned capacity we are reminded of the great serpent Mehen (also not a uraeus) who protected the Sun-god during his nightly voyage through the Under- world. Henceforward Nehebkau, as his name shows, acted for Rer in assigning to the dead their ranks in the hereafter, and it was doubtless the later misunderstanding of the word 1 See Wb. d. aeg. Spr., ii, 291. 2 E.g., the serpent Dsr-tp, who in Pyr. Texts, § 438 is evidently considered to be an enemy, but who in § 401 assists the king to slaughter the gods for his meal. 3 As also with the serpent Naru, in § 511. Cf. No. 1la above. 4 Chester Beatty Papyrus No. I, recto, 15. 5. 46</page><page sequence="7">THE GOD NEHEBKAU 47 kiw in his name as "sustenance" which resulted in the representation of him as carrying vessels of food and drink. He seems to be included among the protective deities on the ivory wands, and his assistance is invoked in the magical text on the Metternich Stela. At some period of his career he had acquired, very suitably, the scorpion-goddess Selchis as his consort (see No. 3 above), and the Book of the Dead seems to identify or associate him with the serpent Naru, "the bull of Nut".1 There remains to be considered the connexion of Nehebkau with the goddesses Sakhmet and Bastet. We have already mentioned his occurrence, together with other serpents which resemble those depicted in the Underworld books, on the thrones of statuettes of these goddesses. The explanation which appears to be the most probable is that, in this association of Sakhmet-Bastet with Nehebkau and other serpent-demons, we have a reminiscence of the original character of these as enemies of the Sun-god. We know from various passages in the religious texts that the cat and the lynx (an animal of cat-like nature) were the sworn foes of these serpent-demons. In Pyr. Texts, § 438 (see above) the serpents In-dif and Dsr-tp are destroyed by the lynx (m-fdt) ;2 in Book of the Dead, Spell 17, sect. 22, the vignette shows the serpent Apopis being slaughtered by the "male cat of Rer", and similar scenes appear even earlier on the magical ivory wands.3 The papyrus of Ankhefen- khonsu, a funerary work of the Late New Kingdom, refers to Sakhmet as slayer of Apopis.4 Sakhmet here, no doubt, acts in her capacity as the Eye of err, and it is probably as such that she is conceived as the vanquisher of Nehebkau and the other serpents represented on the sides of her throne. In a word, we are brought back to the sinister aspect which, as we have seen, Nehebkau and his confreres originally had. Alternatively Nehebkau might be associated with Sakhmet-Bastet, when identified with the Eye of ier, in his honourable capacity as servitor of the Sun-god. But the other explanation seems on the whole the more probable. Additional Notes 1. A matter which remains unexplained is the connexion, if any, between the demon Nehebkau and the New Year festival of that name. Pieper, op. cit., 41, suggests that New Year's Day, the symbol of the eternal recurrence of the year, was associated with N., who himself stood for eternity, and he recalls the phrase " I destroy (or, endure) eternity like Nehebkau ". But this seems to be pure hypothesis. 2. Nehebkau was revered at a place called =. 6 Gauthier7 suggests that this should be understood as " la ville du sistre (?)", and that it is perhaps to be identified with Diospolis Parva (( ), the metropolis of the Seventh Nome of Upper Egypt. There was also a temple (htt) of Nehebkau in connexion with the temple of Harsaphes at Heracleopolis, as we know from the inscription on the statue of Hor, son of Psammetichus, in the Louvre.8 It may or may not be a coincidence that, according to the same inscription, a yearly festival of the goddess Bastet was celebrated at Heracleopolis. 1See No. 11 a above. 2 See also Book of the Dead, Spell 149, sect. 7, in which the serpent Rerek is killed by the lynx. 3 Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, Pls. xxxvi, No. 7; xxvii, h (B.M. 24425), k (B.M. 9135). 4 Blackman in Journal, 4, 126, 1. 65. 5 Quoted above as 8 a. 6 Mariette, Abydos, i, 44. 7 Dictionnaire des noms geographiques, v, 65. 8 Of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty.

The following references to Nehebkau in the Chester Beatty papyri, just published, are of interest: (a) Chester Beatty VIII B.1 Nehebka ([ I JU i vv-1 ) is invoked, among other deities, for the protection of the dwelling-house. He is apparently intended to prevent serpents from entering through a hole in the wall or floor. (b) Chester Beatty XIII.2 In this fragmentary text we have a tantalizing reference to the serpents which enter into the interior of Nehebka (with curious spelling [;(?)] (c) Chester Beatty VIII B.3 In a series of invocations to Rer-Harakhte the god is hailed as Nehebka (spelt as in a). (d) Chester Beatty VIII A.4 Nehebka appears in association with Rer, in a spell for pro- tecting various parts of the human body by identification with those of divinities. 4. In the vignette of the Assessors accompanying the Negative Confession in the papyrus of Ani,5 Nehebkau, Dsr-tp and Nhb-nfrt are all represented as having the heads of serpents. That eventually Nehebkau was sometimes confused with the uraeus is shown by the corre- sponding vignette in the papyrus of Anhai, where Nehebkau, In-r-f, 7Dsr-tp, and Nhb-nfrt are all represented actually as uraei.6 5. When describing the statuettes of Sakhmet-Bastet in Journal, 18, 121 ff. I overlooked Cairo No. 38924.7 This is the lower portion of a seated statuette of Mut-Sakhmet-Bastet, and the array of divine figures on the side of her throne very closely resembles that on Mr. Horn- blower's example.
