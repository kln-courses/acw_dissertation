PITCHER, AND MARTA ESTRADA Experimental processes methods of of science" interest and comparative should (Mayr, be 1982). methods studied To reach through have valid been repeated scientific referred investigations, to conclusions, as "the two the preferably great Experimental methods of science" (Mayr, 1982). To reach valid scientific conclusions, the processes of interest should be studied through repeated investigations, preferably over a range of differing conditions. The most direct way to accomplish this is the experi- mental method, wherein controls are imposed that allow the scientist to systematically vary conditions of interest while holding other factors constant. Marine ecosystems, however, are not amenable to experimental control. One way to address this shortcoming is through the comparative method (Mayr, 1982), which allows the processes of interest to be examined on repeated occasions using naturally occurring temporal and spatial variations in existing conditions and phenomena. In this case, the range of natural variability in conditions and mechanisms substitute for controlled experimental treatments. Harmful algal bloom (HAB) research has had a long history in many countries, and further advances in understanding of HABs are likely to benefit from international, col- ' laborative efforts that will allow the assembly and comparison of data collected in different systems. A comparative approach will allow us to generalize previously obtained results and to establish the existence of recurrent patterns. By analyzing the response of particular HAB species from similarly functioning ecosystems distributed around the world, it should be possible to tease out significant trends from the noise within any single system. Likewise, similar HAB species can occur in geographically separated and environmentally distinct re- gions and as a result, may differ in their growth dynamics and expression of harmful attri- butes. Comparisons can reveal fundamental processes governing population development and toxin production. Furthermore, major anthropogenic and/or natural forcings, such as nutrient loading and climate variability, appear to have differing impacts on HABs in dif- ferent regions, so understanding this gradient of responses may lead to better insight and better management of HAB events. 148 Oceanography I Vol.18, No.2, June 2005</page><page sequence="2">Harmful algal bloom (HAB) research has had a long history in many countries, and further advances in understanding of HABs are likely to benefit from international, collaborative efforts that will allow the assembly and comparison of data collected in different systems.</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1.

There are, of course, disadvantages to the comparative approach that must be considered when setting up programs of this type. For example, costs can be high, as separate teams of investigators are often required, each with their own equipment and support needs. Never- theless, the rationale for comparative studies of harmful algal taxa, functional groups, and the ecosystems in which Donald M.

Marta Estrada is Professor, Institut de Ciències del Mar, Barcelona, Spain. they occur is compelling and has been incorporated into several international HAB programs. The GEOHAB (Global Ecology and Oceanography of Harm- ful Algal Blooms) Program created a Comparative Ecosystem Studies pro- gram element with the goal to "identify mechanisms underlying HAB popula- tion and community dynamics across ecosystem types through comparative studies" (GEOHAB, 2001). Central to the implementation of GEOHAB is the establishment of Core Research Proj- ects (GEOHAB, 2003), which comprise oceanographic field studies in compara- ble ecosystems through identification of relevant organisms, and measurements of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that control their population dynamics. A major objective of Core Re- search is the integration achieved by the application of models to HAB dynamics in geographically distinct ecosystems. In a similar manner, the EU-U.S. Scien- tific Initiative on Harmful Algal Blooms (European Commission, 2003) builds on the recognition that comparable systems and species driven by similar factors are found within the EU and U.S. regions, as are systems in which the dominant forc- ing factors differ. Here we describe the types of "systems" that can be compared in this approach to HAB research, and offer examples of ongoing or planned studies where the approach can be par- ticularly beneficial. The EU-U.S. pro- gram is highlighted because it provides many examples where comparative stud- ies are of clear value. COMPARABLE SYSTEMS The comparative approach may be ap- plied in several ways. HABs occur in both pelagic and benthic ecosystems that can be classified operationally according to their physical and chemical charac- teristics and their particular biology, and therefore offer the opportunity for an ecosystem approach to comparison. As an alternative, it is also possible to compare taxa or groups of HAB species that share common features or strategies, thereby dropping the ecosystem focus for a more organismal comparison. Examples of ecosystem types that could be defined on the basis of hydro- graphic regimes include: • Upwelling systems, associated with eastern boundary current systems, such as the California Current, the Humbolt Current, the Canary Current and Iberian Coastal System, and the 150 Oceanography I Vol.18, No.2, June 2005</page><page sequence="4">Benguela Current. Within the context of the seasonal succession of phyto- plankton, several potentially harmful microalgae are common within these systems, including Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Alexandrium spp., Gymnodin- ium catenaturriy and Dinophysis spp. (GEOHAB, 2005). Of particular in- terest is the association of blooms of chain-forming dinoflagellates, such as Alexandrium catenella and Gymno- dinium catenatum (e.g., Fraga et al., 1988a; Pitcher and Calder, 2000), with these systems (Figure 1). This associa- tion is thought to relate to the strong swimming capabilities of chains of cells compared to solitary forms (Fra- ga et al., 1988b). • Fjords, as in Alaska, Canada, Scandi- navia, and Chile. These systems create retention and/or initiation zones that favor the proliferation of a particular suite of HAB species (e.g., Alexan- drium spp., Pseudo-nitzschia spp., and various raphidophytes). Fjords are of- ten only marginally affected by human activities because of low population densities, and thus are usually not sub- ject to eutrophication, which can select for a different set of HAB species. • Coastal embayment systems, found in most coastal countries. As with fjords, hydrodynamic processes may be com- plex, with an accentuated role of tidal flux, storm surges, wind-driven mix- ing, and salinity and thermal stratifica- tion. These systems are associated with a wide variety of HAB species, many of which are motile and have resting stag- es. Changes of position in the water column, in relationship with the tidal cycle, for example, may be important to avoid transport of the population outside of the favorable habitat (e.g., Anderson and Stolzenbach, 1985). Resting stages may take advantage of the short distance between bottom sediments and surface waters. • Thin-layer-producing systems along most coasts, including the Atlantic coast of France, Sweden, California, and Washington state. Several HAB species such as Dinophysis acumi- nata (Gentien et al., 1995), Karenia mikimotoi , and even Alexandrium fundyense (Townsend et al., 2001) are known to form thin, subsurface lay- ers at scales as small as 10 cm in the vertical and as large as 10 km in the horizontal (Gentien et al., 2005). One kinematic explanation is that these layers result from the stretching of horizontal inhomogeneities by the vertical shear of horizontal currents. This produces an environment poten- tially favoring motile organisms that can maintain their position in this layer (Franks, 1995). These are but a few of the many ecosys- tems classified on the basis of their hy- drography and associated with various groups of HABs. Ecosystems can also be defined on the basis of their nutrient sta- tus or salinity characteristics. Examples of these types of ecosystems include: • Systems strongly influenced by eutro- phication, such as the Black Sea, Baltic Sea, Adriatic Sea, Seto Inland Sea, and the waters near Hong Kong, and the mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. HAB species that seem more prevalent in these systems include those within the genera Phaeocystis , Chattonella , Heterosigma, Prorocen- trum , and Pfiesteria , to name just a few. Many factors can influence this association, not just the quantity of ambient nutrients. The form of those nutrients (i.e., organic versus inorgan- ic) can be a major determinant as well (Glibert et al., this issue). • Brackish systems, such as the Baltic Sea or portions of the Chesapeake Bay or the St. Lawrence. These systems of- ten are associated with cyanobacterial species of Microcystis , Nodularia, and Anabaena , but flagellates such as Pfi- esteria , Karlodinium , and Prymnesium are also common. Comparative studies need not be lim- ited to ecosystems. It is also possible to conduct studies on taxonomie groups, or species with common life history or survival strategies. These species might include: • Cyst-forming dinoflagellates, hapto- phytes, prymnesiophytes, and cya- nobacteria that are heavily reliant on the germination of dormant stages for bloom initiation (Figure 2). HAB spe- cies or genera that can be compared within this context include Alexan- drium spp., Pyrodinium bahamense , Chattonella spp., and Gymnodinium catenatum. These organisms can in turn be studied in different habitats where the relative importance of cyst germination may vary due to depth, advection, and other factors. • Mixotrophic species (i.e., those that obtain part of their nutrition through consumption of other organisms and compounds). HAB genera such as Chrysochromulina, Prymnesium, Alexandrium , and Prorocentrum are among those capable of this strategy (Hansen, 1998). The challenge here is to quantify the role that mixotrophy plays in a particular organism's nutri- Oceanography I Vol.18, No.2, June 2005 151</page><page sequence="5">Figure 2.

Many of these species are fully capable of surviving using only autotrophy; presumably they use mix- otrophy as a strategy to supplement their nutrition. The above examples are not intended to be comprehensive or exclusive; they demonstrate the latitude that can be fol- lowed in comparative studies. COMPARATIVE STUDIES BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND UNITED STATES The EU-U.S. Scientific Initiative on Harmful Algal Blooms (European Com- mission, 2003) offers an outstanding opportunity to rapidly advance HAB science through comparative studies. In the following sections, examples are de- scribed that have a high probability of yielding new insights in HAB dynamics through the comparative approach in this bilateral program. Comparisons among different spe- cies that inhabit the same ecosystem type can be highly informative. In this context, certain similarities between the hydrography, meteorology, and pat- terns of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in California and northwest Spain are noteworthy, even though the caus- ative organisms (. Alexandrium catenella and Gymnodinium catenatum. , respec- tively) are different species. In both ar- eas, the dominant hydrographie feature is coastal upwelling driven by persistent equatorward winds. Sudden outbreaks of PSP toxicity occur in both areas during months when a cessation or relaxation of upwelling is common (Price et al., 1991; Fraga et al., 1988a), suggesting the shoreward delivery of offshore water and its associated cells. Comparative stud- ies developed to investigate the linkage between large-scale physical forcing and the patterns of PSP would clearly be in- formative. In this instance, identification of the specific characteristics of the two species that allow these species to persist in these upwelling systems is the goal. We already know that their ability to form long chains makes them exceptionally strong swimmers, able to withstand ver- 152 Oceanography I Vol.18, No.2, June 2005 vegetative cells 3: If conditions remain optimal, cells ► will exponentially, cell could continue produce to 2 divide, to 4 several to 8. reproducing A hundred single exponentially, 2 to 4 to 8.

Other factors must also come into play; how- ever, these have yet to be identified. Both species form resting cysts, but this may not provide benefits that are specific tò upwelling systems, particularly given the water depths in these systems. Likewise, both species are toxic, but again, this may not explain their dominance in these sys- tems. Only through careful studies us- ing similar methods and approaches can comparable data sets be obtained that can lead to the insights on factors that allow these species to inhabit this type of hydrographie system so successfully. Physical processes controlling bloom transport are of paramount importance in all HABs. Coastal currents driven by wind, buoyancy, or remote forcings can transport blooms hundreds or even thousands of kilometers along the coast, often from one management area to an- other (e.g., Franks and Anderson, 1992). Understanding the physical dynamics underlying these transport pathways is essential to effective management and mitigation of HAB effects. In the context of comparative systems, Karenia brevis in the Gulf of Mexico develops offshore but is transported to and along the coast by complex interactions between coastal currents and shelf features (Steidinger et al., 1998). Similarly, K. mikimotoi is transported in coastal currents along the northwest European continental shelf, with delivery of subsurface populations to shore with specific wind conditions (e.g., Raine and MacMahon, 1998). There may or may not be common mechanisms underlying these blooms, but much can be learned by conducting similar studies of each species, with an emphasis on the manner in which physi- cal forcings regulate cell accumulation and delivery to shore. Processes at much smaller scales are equally important to potential HAB expression. Accumulation at frontal in- terfaces (Franks, 1992) and fine-scale aggregation in subsurface thin layers are both strategies that can enhance the survival of a species. Examples of both are found in the EU and in the United States. For example, Dinophysis norvegica can grow and persist in thin layers within the Baltic Sea thermocline at 20 m dur- ing the summer months, reaching more than 100 cells m/1, similar to thin lay- ers of the same organism in East Sound, Washington (P. Donaghay, Graduate School of Oceanography University of Rhode Island, Narragansett, Rhode Is- land, unpublished data, 2005). This is an example where comparative studies will require sophisticated equipment that can sample and document layers of cells that are sometimes a meter or less in thick- ness, without distorting them or altering their signature. Technologies to make these measurements are currently being developed both in the United States and Europe. The thin-layer fine spatial scale sampling technologies developed in the U.S. Thin Layers Program (e.g., Cowles et al., 2000) complement ongoing efforts in Europe (e.g., Marcaillou et al., 2000) and provide platforms for potential ex- panded capabilities through probe and toxin detection additions. Gentien et al. (this issue) describe some aspects of this type of collaborative effort. One of the key questions facing sci- entists is the role of eutrophication in HABs and how the inputs, quality, and fluxes of nutrients relate to HAB devel- opment and proliferation (Glibert et al., this issue). Here again, comparisons of systems in different regions can be infor- mative. For example, some coastal sys- tems in the EU are phosphorus-limited (e.g., Mediterranean Sea) compared to many regions of the U.S. coast, which are generally nitrogen limited. Shifts from nitrogen to phosphorus limitation have resulted from management intervention, such as implementation of advanced sewage treatment, and examination of present trends in the context of histori- cal data sets may yield insights useful to managers. In the Northern Aegean Sea, phytoplankton populations were mostly diatom dominated until about 1996 when decreased N:P ratios developed following changes in sewage treatment policies and increases in phosphorus loading (Moncheva et al., 2001). These depressed ratios were subsequently cor- related with increased dinoflagellate blooms, including Dinophysis species responsible for diarrhetic shellfish poi- soning (DSP). In the context of the EU-U.S. compar- ative HAB program, it is of note that Eu- ropean land discharge to coastal systems delivers, on average, five to ten times more nitrogen (per hectare) to coastal waters than is estimated for the United States (Seitzinger and Kroeze, 1998). This is likely a result of higher population density and more intensive and longer land use in Europe than in the United States. In the later context, there have been over 1000 years of land manipula- tion in the European countries compared to a modest 200 years in the United States. The higher loads of nutrients per hectare in the EU are intriguing consid- Oceanography I Vol.1 8, No.2, June 2005 1 53</page><page sequence="7">ering the apparently increasing frequen- cies and duration of HAB events off Northern Europe and several Mediter- ranean countries (EUROHAB, 1999) versus the relatively small number of an- thropogenically supported HABs in U.S. waters. These differences might suggest that as the United States ages, nutrient loads per unit land surface might follow the same pattern as in Europe, leading to the increasing HAB frequencies found in Europe today. Comparisons between similarly impacted and differentially im- pacted enclosed and semi-enclosed sys- tems on both sides of the Atlantic would begin to provide the data needed to eval- uate this worrisome possibility. Several comparable HAB problems are of note in this regard. Beaches covered with foam and viscous waters that foul fishermen's nets are recurrent events in North Sea waters due to blooms of the colonial prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis (Lancelot et al., 1998). The mucilage-rich colonies are thought to bloom as a result of changing nutrient loads and ratios in the major rivers of the region. Dia- toms flourish in early spring, sustained by the winter stock of dissolved silicate and phosphate, but the nitrate-enriched river waters in late April to May stimulate the growth of Phaeocystis colonies in the eastern Channel and southern North Sea, impacting areas of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. In contrast, Phaeocystis has a limited range in the United States, occurring for short periods in the Gulf of Maine and Cape Cod Bay. Blooms are less frequent and less expan- sive, and only dominate surface biomass on rare occasions. Does this difference reflect lower nutrient loads or ratios, dif- ferent species or strains of Phaeocystis , or some other ecological factor? At present, we can only pose such questions. An- swers await comparative studies. Another example is found within the toxic dinoflagellate genus Dinophysis (Figure 3), in that some species in Europe are toxic and often contaminate mussels, leading to serious DSP outbreaks, where- as U.S. populations of the same species have undetectable or extremely low tox- icity. Reasons for these differences remain unresolved and could reflect genotypic heterogeneity or differential toxin syn- thesis in response to nutrient availability or other factors that differ between the European and U.S. systems. Yet another important example where comparative studies would lead to insights involves the toxic diatoms Pseudo-nitzschia spp. These species are found throughout Europe and the U.S., yet toxic outbreaks occur only in cer- tain regions. For example, P. australis is the only species off the Atlantic coast of Spain that is toxic, although multiple other species of Pseudo-nitzschia are present (Bates et al., 1998). In contrast, P. australis is usually non-toxic off the U.S. Pacific Northwest but is commonly toxic in waters further south, off the coast of California, again in the presence of multiple (non-toxic) co-occurring Pseudo-nitzschia species. This intermin- gling of toxic and non-toxic species and strains within a given region or across re- gions suggests a series of natural experi- ments to determine the extent to which toxin variability reflects environmental forcings as opposed to genetic and physi- ological differences. Resolving these dif- ficult issues requires comparative studies in multiple environments. The change in genetic diversity that can occur through time in comparable systems is also an important question in HAB dynamics. During a recent Pseu- do-nitzschia delicatissima bloom in the Gulf of Naples, for example, a striking amount of genetic diversity was docu- mented in the population of this species at the beginning of a bloom, but only a few genotypes were still present after the bloom was well established (Orsini et al., 2002). Clearly, genetic diversity changed through time, such that only a fraction of the resident population in the Gulf was ultimately responsible for the bloom. Such variability is important to resolve for other bloom taxa as well, and it must be taken into account if comparisons are being made of the "same" species in two different environments. One outcome of comparative studies of different ecosystem types should be an ability to characterize HAB species into "functional groups" and to identify com- monalties in plankton community struc- ture in relation to environmental forc- ings. Functional groups provide a basis for simplification in order to improve our predictive ability relative to the dy- namics of the system. The terms func- tional types, functional groups, or life forms, which some consider to be syn- onymous, can be defined in a number of ways. In the context of GEOHAB, a func- tional group follows the definition of Gitay and Noble (1997): a "non-phyloge- netic classification leading to a grouping of organisms that respond in a similar way to a syndrome of environmental fac- tors." The organisms within a functional group share "an adaptation syndrome. . . to recurrent patterns of selective factors" (Margalef, 1978). The term "syndrome" used in the above definitions highlights 154 Oceanography I Vol.18, No.2, June 2005</page><page sequence="8">Figure 3. D'mophysis species.

Efforts to interpret the ecological implications of morphological or other phenotypical phytoplankton charac- teristics have been reviewed by Sournia (1982), Elbrächter (1984), Fogg (1991), and Kiorboe (1993), among others. Properties like size or shape may interact with water turbulence and with nutrient uptake ability, and swimming may al- low control of the vertical position in the water column (Kamykowski et al., 1998). However, very little is known of the functional significance of many features of phytoplankton (Sournia, 1982). It should be noted here that the toxicity or harmfulness of HAB species is generally defined from an anthropomorphic point of view and that the ecological relevance of these properties is generally unknown, and may be nil. There have been many attempts to de- velop functional classifications of phyto- plankton. Some have been useful in pro- viding a conceptual framework, based on empirically obvious morphological or physiological traits, such as that pro- posed by Margalef (1978), Margalef et al., (1979), Reynolds and Smayda (1998), and Cullen and Maclntyre (1998). The latter authors reconsidered Margalef 's (1978) model and emphasized physi- ological and biochemical adaptations that could be quantified experimentally. They identified three main adaptation syndromes: "mixers," which are adapted to highly variable irradiance; "migrators," which have a well-developed capacity Oceanography I Vol.18, No.2, June 2005 155</page><page sequence="9">By analyzing the response of particular HAB species from similarly functioning ecosystems distributed around the world, it should be possible to tease out significant trends from the noise within any single system. for unbalanced growth and control of vertical movement, and "layer- formers," which have developed efficient systems to harness light or nutrients in environ- ments with highly predictable irradiance or nutrient supplies. We are at the early stages of functional group classification for HAB species. In this context, a data-defined approach could use multivariate techniques to de- tect clusters of species based on the simi- larities in their distribution or on a set of characters. Many phytoplankton species tend to be cosmopolitan or to occupy a large biogeographical range. However, it is possible to detect recurrent patterns in the composition of phytoplankton com- munities at particular times or places. Taxa within a recurrent assemblage, or assemblages occupying similar ecological situations in comparable ecosystems, can be examined for common morphologi- cal, physiological, or life-history traits that could be considered as characteriz- ing a functional group. The data needed for these analyses require comparative studies of many types. In summary, a comparative approach to HAB research has been incorporated into several major international pro- grams, and this should lead to a number of important contributions to our un- derstanding of HAB dynamics. A few of the benefits from this approach include: • Improved understanding of common- alities and differences in the physiolo- gies and behaviors of individual HAB species or functional groups that de- termine their occurrence in particular ecosystem-types. • Identification of the physical océano- graphie forcings that play a significant role in bloom dynamics and are spe- cific to particular ecosystem types. • Models of HAB transport and dynam- ics in key hydrographie systems that can be used at multiple locales, lead- ing to bloom forecasts and predic- tions. • Models of HAB species or functional groups that can be modified for use with other species or groups, and that can be incorporated into physical cir- culation models for bloom forecasts and predictions. • An understanding of the dynamics of particular organisms or groups of organisms that can be used in the de- sign and implementation of mitiga- tion strategies. This comparative ecosystem approach compels the HAB community to syn- thesize knowledge and data in order to group HABs into categories based on behavior, physiology, life history char- acteristics, or simply an ability to flour- ish under a particular set of conditions. Since it is not feasible to study all HAB phenomena at all locations, a series of studies targeting comparable ecosystem types, taxa, or functional groups is clear- ly an efficient use of limited scientific and financial resources.
