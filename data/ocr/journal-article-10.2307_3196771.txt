<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Angle EMERSON AS MYTHMAKER. By J. Russell Reaver. Gainesville, University of Florida Press, 1954. x, 106 pages. $2.00. During his prime years Emerson never tired of discovering new ways to look at the landscape, which as every one knows was a vast metaphor for human life. He wanted to look at it in all weathers and from every vantage, hoping eventually to find some spoke which led from the cir- cumference down to the gravitational hub. This new book is one of four published in the last four years so close together that all were well under way before the first came out. Each of the authors breaks with con- ventional modes and points for view- ing, to see if he, like Emerson look- ing back through his legs at the land- scape, might discover for us another reason for another reading of Emer- son. Vivian Hopkins, with Spires of Form in 1951, was followed by Sher- man Paul the next year with Emer- son's Angle of Vision; and in 1954 Stephen Whicher's Fate and Freedom came out along with the volume under review. Add two other titles, Rusk's Emerson and Carpenter's recent hand- book, and we have six major studies in five years. Professor Reaver abandons the old points of view so thoroughly that the word "trancendentalism" is used only about once, sotto voce. In his study he draws from all the works of Emer- son, but he applies his myth criticism specifically to the poetry. In a state- ment of purpose he says he "investi- gates the use of images in Emerson's poetry, which is fundamentally lyrical but wider than the biographical self as Emerson projects his mythical vision of intuitional life through identifying man and his universe in a continuous creative effort." In ar- riving at the poet's imagery, the author studies Emerson's creative theories in the light of post-Freudian psychology; and it is this Chapter II which is the least fruitful in giving the reader a new angle of vision, perhaps because the complexity of the problem requires a vocabulary which cannot be induced in the limit- ed space available in a brief book. In the last half of the work-the chapters on the organic language of poetry and the "shaping intuition"- the critical principles adduced in the first two chapters are applied. Specific examples are given, among which the poems "Uriel," "Brahma," "The Two Rivers," and "Days," are most impor- tant in revealing Emerson at his mythmaking best. The overall myth that is made, if I read correctly, is very close to the world of the spiritualized imagination as described by Emerson's "Orphic poet" in the closing pages of Nature. Looked at in another way it might be termed the retreat from idolatry, through anthropomorphism, on to the vision of a completely spiritualized, a deified human life. The design on the cover may be said to be em- blematic of this: amoebic man in an organic expansion towards complete abstraction. It must be confessed that the myth criticism, applied to Emerson's poetry, fails to enrich it significantly. Whether this is the fault of the poetry, the myth methodology, or its application in this instance, is not mine to hazard, at least not beyond the belief that Emerson's poetry will not suffer in the future by a more universal application of this idiom in all criticism.
