Abraham Ibn Ezra's Commentary on Psalms 103-1041 I. Introduction Samuel Ibn Tibbon's only surviving monograph, Ma* amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, has not received the attention it deserves.2 A close reading of the text proves rewarding. While scholars have not left a single stone or even pebble unturned in their search for texts to prove that Maimonides subscribed to the thesis of the eternity of the world, they have not taken sufficient notice of the fact that Samuel Ibn Tibbon, The process of evaluating this paper was handled by Prof. Ruth Glasner in her capacity as member of the Executive Board of Aleph. For very helpful remarks and suggestions I am indebted to Ruth Glasner and Lenn Schramm, as well as to the three initially anonymous referees for Aleph: Herbert A. Davidson, Resianne Fontaine, and W. Zev Harvey. © Aleph 8 (2008) pp. 41-129 41</page><page sequence="2">his admiring translator and follower, upholds (an original variant of) this allegedly heterodox thesis all but explicitly.3 My purpose here is to show that Ma3 amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim propounds an original cosmogony that is in fact a synthesis of the thesis of hiddus ha-colam (the world came into being ab novo, after not having been) and the notion that the world is eternal. In a nutshell, Samuel Ibn Tibbon's view is this: the separate forms (the deity and the intelligences4) are eternal (a parte ante and a parte post); so too are the material heavenly bodies (spheres, stars, and planets) that the intelligences emanate. What, then, should one make of the biblical account of the creation of the world? Samuel Ibn Tibbon holds that Genesis 1:1-2:3 is to be understood as bearing not on the creation of the entire reality, but rather as a description of the creation, or rather the coming-to-be, of the sublunar world only. This coming-to-be, the decisive phase of which was the emergence of dry land from under the water that initially enveloped the terrestrial globe and over which "a wind from God [was] sweeping" (Gen. 1:2), was an entirely natural process that resulted from natural necessities. This was not the end of the story, however. Once constituted, the sublunar world slowly but surely began to pass away: a reverse natural process set in, leading to the very same state that had prevailed "on the eve" of creation; i.e., a state in which the terrestrial globe is again entirely covered by water. Then the same natural process of the coming-to-be of the sublunar world (i.e., the emergence of dry land) began all over again, and so on infinitely. Thus the process of "creation" described in Genesis was not a unique and one-time episode: rather, Genesis describes the typical "phase" in an infinite, eternally recurring process in which sublunar worlds perpetually come to be and pass away by virtue of natural necessities. Although the life span of each individual sublunar world is limited, the chain of the coming-to-be and passing-away of successive sublunar worlds is infinite. All the while the encompassing celestial world remains eternally selfsame.

In what follows we shall see how Samuel Ibn Tibbon worked out this audacious, entirely naturalistic theory and construed its compatibility with the authoritative Jewish texts. II. The Problem Samuel Ibn Tibbon's enterprise can be seen as a critical dialogue with Maimonides' reading of the account of creation in Genesis 1. Sara Klein-Braslavy has shown in detail how Maimonides draws on contemporary science, especially the Meteorology, as a "semantic key" for understanding the biblical text: he offers a naturalistic account of creation that is at the same time also an interpretation of Genesis, arguing that science and Scripture say precisely the same things, in different languages.5 Subsequently, Aviezer Ravitzky demonstrated that Ibn Tibbon too, used the Meteorology as a "semantic key" for his reading of Genesis, which is, however, very different from that of the Master. Ravitzky persuasively argued that Ibn Tibbon was interested in the Meteorology precisely because he followed Maimonides in viewing it as central to an adequate understanding of the secrets of creation (i.e., of Ma'aseh Beresit, which he identified with Aristotelian physics). This is also what motivated him to translate the Meteorology into Hebrew (in 1210), perhaps in the context of his teaching activity.6 Here I will not follow Ibn Tibbon's interpretation of Genesis and his concomitant critique of Maimonides step by step.7 They become meaningful only after we understand the overarching goal of Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha- mayim, which dictates the exegesis of the individual verses. I will accordingly trace Ibn Tibbon's scientific reasoning and its application to the biblical text. 44</page><page sequence="5">Gad Freudenthal The point of departure of M a* amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim is a query that Ibn Tibbon received from a friend, or perhaps a student (p. 2:2). The query, which seems to have been real rather than a literary device (see Appendix A), bore on a cause célèbre of medieval science whose roots go back to Plato and which was much discussed in subsequent Greek and Arabic science.8 The universally accepted four-element theory to Samuel Ibn Tibbon: The Transformation of the Dalâlat al-Ha'irin into the Moreh ha-Nevukhim (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2007) (Heb.), Chapter 1. Some authors have cursorily remarked that Samuel Ibn Tibbon upheld the "eternity of the world ": we will see that these comments are misleading, inasmuch as Ibn Tibbon's views are a far cry from the usual, Aristotelian, construal of the eternity of the world thesis. Still less have they made any attempt to reconstruct the scientific theory on which Ibn Tibbon grounds his understanding of the eternity of the world. See below, section V. * I use the term "intelligence" to nrefer to the separate forms emanating from God, and "intellects" to refer to the forms of the spheres, although I am not sure that Ibn Tibbon always distinguished the two notions, which are denoted by a single term in Hebrew {sekel).

On Ibn Tibbon's attitude toward Maimonides and the methodological problems in assessing it, see Ravitzky, "Aristotle's Meteorologica"; Fraenkel, From Maimonides to Samuel Ibn Tibbon, chapter 3. Fraenkel notes (§3.3) that Ibn Tibbon's critique of Maimonides is embedded in his biblical exegesis. For what follows see Gad Freudenthal, "(Al-)Chemical Foundations for Cosmological Ideas: Ibn Sïnâ on the Geology of an Eternal World," pp. 47-73 in Sabetai Unguru, ed., Physics, Cosmology and Astronomy, 1300-1700: Tension and Accommodation (= Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science 126) (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1991); repr. 45</page><page sequence="6">implies that their natural rectilinear motions -air and fire upward, water and earth downward- cause the four elements to move continuously toward their respective natural places, thereby separating from one another little by little. This ongoing process would end when no part of an element remained out of its natural place, with the elements forming four concentric layers: the globe of the earth encompassed by a shell of water and that shell surrounded by a shell of air, in its turn encompassed by a shell of elemental fire. The problem is that if the world is eternal, as Aristotle and his followers maintained, then (according to the principle of plenitude) this potentiality should already have been realized and the segregation of the elements should have come to its conclusion, producing a terrestrial globe entirely covered with water. This is obviously not the case. But why? "What do the philosophers say about [the fact that] the elementary water does not encompass the earth entirely and does not cover its surface entirely?" the student asks (p. 2:3-4). Note that Ibn Tibbon tacitly assumes that whereas the light elements are constantly being mixed together by the motion of the sun, which prevents the formation of concentric shells of elementary air and fire, the same does not apply to the lower, heavy elements of earth and water. The question, let us note in passing, clearly evinces the student's familiarity with Aristotelian natural philosophy and in particular with the Meteorology, in which the subject is discussed at length.9 Since the study of natural philosophy was in its infancy among Jews in the Midi at the beginning of the thirteenth century, and the Meteorology was the first book of natural philosophy that was translated from Arabic into Hebrew, there can be little doubt that it was precisely that treatise which inspired Ibn Tibbon's correspondent to ask his question (see Appendix A). The questioner can indeed be understood as voicing a traditionalist critique of Aristotelian philosophy: Tradition provides a simple answer to the question of why the surface of the earth is not flooded; namely, that God ordained the water to "gather" (Gen. 1:9). Can Aristotelian science offer an alternative explanation? 46</page><page sequence="7">Gad Freudenthal Although Ibn Tibbon begins by treating the query as bearing only on the views of the "philosophers," and not on his own, he is clearly troubled by it, for two reasons. First, wishing to use the Meteorology as a "semantic key" to unlock the secrets of creation, he was indeed in need of a naturalistic account of how the water "gathered" after originally covering the entire surface of the terrestrial globe; this account would ipso facto also be a naturalistic interpretation of Genesis. Second, and more subtly, the very fact that he delved into this problem attests that Ibn Tibbon had already embraced the thesis of the eternity of the world (in a sense to be made more precise), which the query obviously presupposes (we will come back to this below). Consequently, he needed to understand how Aristotelian natural science explains the fact that the four elements are not in their natural places, when Aristotelian physics implies that they should be. III. Samuel Ibn Tibbon's Account of How the Water "Gathered": With Ibn Sînâ and King David Against Ibn Rushd How, then, did "the philosophers" account for the fact that in the world we see around us the water is "gathered"? We need not go into the long history of this problem here.10 It suffices to consider the widely in Freudenthal Science in the Medieval Hebrew and Arabic Traditions (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2005). Q See next note. 10 Aristotle discusses a related issue in the Meteorology. He refers to the fact that some places that are now dry land were flooded at other periods, and vice versa, concluding (in Samuel Ibn Tibbon's Hebrew version): "the regions that are [covered with] water do not persist in that state, nor do those that are dry. Rather, [places] always change 47</page><page sequence="8">accepted solution of Ibn Rushd, which Samuel Ibn Tibbon invokes and rejects.11 The Commentator argued as follows: True, the four-element theory implies that the world, being eternal, should have reached a stable state in which the terrestrial globe is flooded. In fact, though, we can infer from experience that this has never been the case. For had the entire surface of the earth ever been fully submerged, all flora and fauna would have become extinct. (The extinction would include aquatic animals as well, because, as Ibn Tibbon notes, their nutrition comes from the dry land; see pp. 68:23-27, 131:30-32.12) Consequently, if the earth had been entirely under water at any time in the past, present-day dry land would be lifeless. (Ibn Rushd assumes that, once extinct, no plant and animal species could reappear; see below.) This visibly and fortunately is not the case. Ibn Rushd concluded (as Ibn Tibbon notes) that the eternal heavenly bodies always "preserve" stretches of dry land, and thereby also all plant and animal species (pp. 7:1-3, 8-9; 8:8-22).13 Ibn Rushd grounded this idea in his general theory of providence, which affirmed all species to be eternal: since he understood the notion of "species" to encompass not only all flora and fauna but also the "species" of dry land and sea, it followed that the surface of the earth could never be entirely flooded. Rather, stretches of dry land and sea are transformed into one another in "long orderly cycles," as Aristotle had affirmed.14 This is why Ibn Rushd dismissed the emergence of dry land as a pseudo-problem: "Behold how they [the philosophers] avoided construing a beginning for this [sublunar] existence: they said neither that the [heavenly motions] bring to being this [dry] place, nor that they created this place, nor that they are the cause of its formation; they merely said: they are the cause of its persistence," Ibn Tibbon perspicaciously observes (p. 7:4-7). Ibn Tibbon rejects Ibn Rushd's view, arguing that Genesis supplies factual information refuting it. Thus the verse "a wind from God [was] sweeping over the water" (Gen. 1:2) indicates that at some point in time the earth was entirely covered by water.15 Similarly, he understands 48</page><page sequence="9">Gad Freudenthal and pass from one state to the other" (Resianne Fontaine, ed. and trans., Otot ha- Shamayim.

For Ibn Rushd's view and references see Freudenthal, a(Al-)Chemical Foundations," pp. 54-55 and p. 69 n. 28. Already in his commentary on Ecclesiastes Ibn Tibbon emphasized that all existents- minerals, plants, and animals- are made of the element earth, and that the nutrition of all animals comes from earth (PQ, §§171-73). This holds even of fish: "That which is found in the bellies of fish cannot possibly come to be from water only. Nor can the food of all fish derive entirely from other fish. This is impossible with respect to nature. . . . Thus, to conclude: all creatures get their nutrition from the earth" (PQ, §173).

God's command "Let the water ... be gathered ... so that dry land may appear" (Gen. 1:9) confirms that "nothing of it [dry land] was visible until [the water] gathered to one place" (p. 2:25). "Scripture attests that indubitably the entire earth was covered with water," he concludes (p. 2:18-19; see also p. 130:11-16). Ibn Tibbon infers, from the evidence he extracts from Genesis, that Ibn Rushd's view is false. We remain with the question of explaining the fact that the surface of the earth is not permanently covered with water. Given Ibn Tibbon's premises, the problem was this. He took Genesis to affirm unequivocally that the sublunar world at some point consisted of four concentric elemental shells. In the terms of Aristotle's natural philosophy, each of the four elements was then in its natural place and there was no reason why any of them should leave it. In terms of Aristotle's metaphysics, the sublunar world was in its most perfect state; and something that is in its perfect state does not leave it of its own (p. 147:17-20). The question is thus why the elements nonetheless moved out of their respective natural places and the sublunar world changed into a less perfect state, so that dry land emerged. Ibn Tibbon's searches for a solution remained fruitless, however: no natural philosopher with whose writings he was acquainted offered an explanation for this. The reason is clear, as Ibn Tibbon himself notes: like Ibn Rushd, the philosophers assumed that there never was - and indeed never could have been- a point in time when the earth was entirely under water. For them, therefore, the question of how land emerged after having been entirely submerged was a question whose very premises were counterfactual. Echoing a well- 50</page><page sequence="11">Gad Freudenthal known distinction in Maimonides' Guide (1:73), Ibn Tibbon explains that, according to most philosophers,17 the state in which the earth is totally covered with water is a hypothetical state that can be imagined, but which reason shows to be physically impossible (pp. 5:20-23, 5:27- 6:2). Consequently none of the treatises on natural philosophy offered a solution to Ibn Tibbon's problem. For twenty years, he writes, he was "rowing hard in the deep waters of this investigation,18 seeking to attain the dry land of understanding,"19 without finding a satisfactory solution (p. 5:20-21). Ibn Tibbon's statement should be understood à la lettre. The query his anonymous friend put to him created a glaring "anomaly" (in T. S. Kuhn's sense) in his Maimonidean project of applying Aristotelian natural science to the cosmogonical problem. In other words, the project that began so well with Maimonides' interpretation of Genesis using the Meteorology as a "semantic key" quickly found itself facing an insoluble problem. Ibn Tibbon struggled with it unsuccessfully for two decades. The Maimonidean attempt to extract a naturalistic cosmogony from Genesis seemed to have reached a dead end. * ^ Ibn Tibbon is aware that the seabed is not a smooth and even surface: "The tehom consists of many different cavities, although, seen from above, it appears as if it were a single large cavity. Yet its bottom is made up of numerous different cavities, on top of which the water sticks together, following its nature" (p. 145:20-22). 17 The printed edition has "the philosophers "; but the manuscript reading "most of the philosophers" seems to be correct, for it takes into account Ibn Sínã (to whom we'll come); it also appears on p. 7:8. 18 Bi-mesulat ha-haqirah' for Ibn Tibbon's usage of mesulah see Fontaine, Otot ha- Shamayim, p. 64 (1:507-510). 19 For understandable reasons, Samuel Ibn Tibbon cherished this metaphor, which he uses elsewhere too; e.g., p. 100:24. 51</page><page sequence="12">The breakthrough came when Samuel Ibn Tibbon discovered (the section on the Meteorology in) Ibn Sïnâ's Kitâb al-Shifãc(p. 7:8-1 3).20 Ibn Sínã maintained the eternity of the world while at the same time rejecting the idea that the "species" of dry land is preserved permanently. On the contrary, he recognized that the earth was regularly flooded- something he ascribed not only to general considerations concerning the natures of the elements but also, and more concretely, to the geological phenomena we now call "erosion"- and offered a thoroughly naturalistic account of how dry land eventually emerges from beneath the water.21 This was exactly what Ibn Tibbon needed. To begin with, Ibn Sïnâ put forward a naturalistic account of the formation of rocks and mountains from earth. This explanation was decisive, inasmuch as it showed how the seabed can be raised and become dry land. Just as mountains are flattened by erosion, Ibn Sïnâ argued, the bottom of the sea rises, thereby keeping the globe from becoming entirely spherical. Ibn Sïnâ's account of the formation of higher ground has two parts. The more original part draws on the contemporary theory of matter, including alchemy, to explain how rocks and mountains are formed on the seabed from "fat," cohesive earth. Ibn Tibbon hardly mentions this theory (p. 8:3-4), perhaps because he lacked the theoretical background to understand it properly. He gave a closer embrace to the second part of Ibn Sïnâ's explanation, which is that the formation of raised areas on the surface of the earth is due to the constant reciprocal transformation of the elements into one another, especially the transformation of earth into water and vice versa, (i) Some earth changes into water (or one of the other elements); having become lighter than the surrounding earthy matter it rises, leaving cavities behind. The water collects in these cavities, thereby producing stretches of dry land (pp. 7:18-22; 146:12-13). (ii) Water (or one of the other elements) changes into earth, which settles on the top of existing surfaces of earth, thereby contributing to the formation of high places (p. 7:22-25; 146:11-12). As in all natural processes in the 52</page><page sequence="13">Gad Freudenthal sublunar world, the planets play a role in these processes, namely by continually mixing the elements and preventing them from settling in concentric shells (p. 5:7-10) and, no less important, by displacing masses of water (pp. 7:26-8:1). A subtle but important point here is that the transformations of earth into water and of water into earth are not equivalent: in Ibn Tibbon's presentation of the theory of elements (3:27-29), the transformation of water into earth is "easier" and therefore more massive than that of earth into water; the implication of this non- Aristotelian postulate, which Ibn Tibbon borrowed from Ibn In his translation of the Meteorology, Samuel Ibn Tibbon briefly referred to Ibn Sïnâ's views several times (see Fontaine, Otot ha-Shamayim, p. 130 [1:438], p. 136 [2:480, 490-91], p. 160 [3:96-97]; see also " Introduction, " p. lxxi). It has not yet been determined to which Avicennian texts they refer. In my view, these references do not invalidate the contention that Ibn Tibbon did not become familiar with the section on the Meteorology of the Kitãb al-Shifã until twenty years after the start of his inquiry into the "gathering" of water and hence some two decades after completing Otot ha- sh amayim (see Appendix A; also below, nn. 56 and 63). For one thing, the references do not seem to be to the section on the Meteorology in the Kitãb al-Shifã'. Ibn Tibbon was certainly familiar with other sections of the Shifa' e.g., the part on the Generation and Corruption (see Appendix B): he may have had access to these sections before he became acquainted with the section on the Meteorology and the references may be to that part. Further, the very brief references could also derive from a secondary source, which remains to be identified. An alternative explanation, suggested by a referee, is that Ibn Tibbon already had a cursory acquaintance with parts of the Shifa* when he translated Otot ha-Shamayim, but used it only in order to improve al-Bitriq's version; he realized its significance for the question of the "gathering of the water" only years later. Intriguing (as pointed out by another referee) is the spelling of Ibn Sma's name as 'rx p. For this and the following see Freudenthal, "(Al-)Chemical Foundations for Cosmological Ideas." 53</page><page sequence="14">Sínã, is that the formation of dry land predominates over the inverse processes (see Appendix B). Ibn Tibbon instantiates and corroborates these general considerations with a spectacular recent phenomenon. From reliable informants he learnt that some twenty years earlier, a new island had emerged "not far from the English isles" (pp. 160:28-161:1), meaning near Iceland. The eruption to which he refers can be identified as the one that took place in 1211 in the Reykjanes Ridge (see Appendix A). This event was clearly volcanic (to use an anachronistic term): the formation of the mountain was preceded by a period in which a large, flame-filled smoky exhalation was visible, demonstrating that it could not be the result of the formation of cavities as a consequence of the tranquil transformation of earth into water. It seemed more likely that it resulted from the transformation into earth of water, specifically "salty, bitter and thick" water, which is "close to the nature of the earth" and therefore "prone to be transformed into earth, with the help of the transforming [causes]" (p. 161:23-24). These "transforming causes" are the fixed stars: to account for the sudden appearance of the mountain, Ibn Tibbon posits that "at the zenith of this place there occurred a configuration of the fixed stars, which, together with their reflected rays, had the power to transform the element of water into earth and [subsequently] elevate the earth from the bottom of the sea and make it all settle at another place," thereby forming a mountain (p. 161:2-4). The release of the smoky, inflammable exhalation prior to the appearance of the mountain suggests that the earth thus elevated may have had "the potentiality of sulfur or a similar mineral [e.g., alum and salt; p. 161:13], whose exhalation is thick and easily inflammable" (p. 161:5-6). Indeed, Ibn Tibbon adds, earth that has a sulfurous (i.e., fiery) component may be "prone to rise and leave its natural place under the constraint of the forcing causes, more than other parts of earth" (p. 161:25-26). The sulfurous character of the earth out of which the mountain was formed was confirmed by the fact that no vegetation 54</page><page sequence="15">Gad Freudenthal grew on it before rain washed away its salt and bird droppings fertilized it (p. 161:11-22). As an afterthought Ibn Tibbon adds that "perhaps this is how all mountains are formed, or most of them" (p. 161:22- 23).22 The upshot of the discussion so far is that, in Ibn Tibbon's view, the reciprocal transformation of the elements into one another is constantly producing cavities and elevations that infringe the earth's sphericity and cause water to collect in certain places. Put differently, the elements' intrinsic tendency to transform into one another produces a built-in natural necessity through which the sublunar world moves away from the perfect stable state in which the elements would be arranged in four concentric shells. This propensity offsets the intrinsic disposition of the elements to separate into four concentric shells. For Ibn Tibbon, Ibn Sma's crucial contribution was showing that "earth"- i.e., stretches of dry land- "is something that comes to be after it had not been, [an idea] not asserted by the rest of the school of the philosophers that follows Aristotle's view" (p. 8:6-7). Consequently, contrary to the commonly held view, "earth cannot persist in its natural state" (p. 7:17), i.e., covered with water. This is why it did not remain in the perfect state in which, as stated in Genesis, it existed before the process of "creation" began. Ibn Sïnâ thus provided Ibn Tibbon with precisely the sort of explanation he needed- a naturalistic account of higgalut ha-yabbasah ^ The last-discussed account clearly echoes the theory (apparently going back to Jabir Ibn Hayyãn and embraced by Ibn Sïnâ) that identifies Aristotle's dry, smoky exhalation with sulfur and the moist exhalation with mercury. See Henry M. Leicester, The Historical Background of Chemistry (New York: John Wiley, 1956; repr.

Some of his perplexity was abated. * But much remained. Whereas nature was Ibn Sïnâ's only concern, his Jewish follower had to worry about Scripture as well. We recall that Scripture was involved in the very definition of the problem that troubled Samuel Ibn Tibbon: he rejected Ibn Rushd's view because he understood from Genesis that there had been a time when the surface of the earth was under water. Consequently his next task was to see how Ibn Sïnâ's scientific solution to the problem of the emergence of dry land tallied with Scripture. Ibn Tibbon proceeds to expound a detailed, step-by-step naturalistic interpretation of Genesis, arguing that science- i.e. the Meteorology plus Ibn Sïnâ's Sbifãc- and the biblical text say precisely the same thing, but in different words. Ibn Tibbon argues, moreover, that the account in Genesis does not tell the entire story of how the world came to be: rather, to understand creation properly we must turn to other authoritative texts as well, notably the Midrash Rabbah, Ecclesiastes, and Psalms 103-104. Here I will not describe Ibn Tibbon's exegetical efforts in detail, but merely recapitulate the few points necessary for our discussion (some of which have already been noted by Ravitzky23). Ibn Tibbon holds that the separate intelligences, which Scripture calls serafim or maVakim (e.g., pp. 10:27-28, 12:8), emanate from God (pp. 29:12-13, 35:31-33). More precisely, the first intelligence emanates from the deity, and the others emanate successively from one another (pp. 35:31-33; 36:7; see also pp. 61:1-3; 118:30- 33).24 From the intelligences, in turn, the entire supralunar, heavenly realm emanates, comprising the spheres and the heavenly bodies (stars and planets) fixed to them, what Jewish sources call Kisse ha-Kavod (Throne of Glory) (p. 10:28-29).25 «The species 'upper heaven,' which is the Throne of Glory without any doubt," 56</page><page sequence="17">Gad Freudenthal Ibn Tibbon writes, "emanates from God, Blessed Be He, through the intermediacy of the serafim [= intelligences], as the wise men know" (p. 124:31-33)- a thesis that indeed is part of the standard philosophic theory of intellect (see also pp. 10:28-29; 17:12-13; 22:21-23; 24:5-8; 28:22-26).26 The deity is thus "the cause of the existence" (p. 118:31) of the separate intelligences and of the heavenly bodies and their continued existence depends on God (p. 167:14-15). It is because the heavenly bodies receive "His permanent Splendor and the [permanent] emanation of His Glory" that they "always are in act 'nimseu be-focal tamid], and [that] He constitutes [ma amid] them" (p. 118:31-32). Thus the intelligences and the heavenly bodies pre-existed the "creation" ^ Ravitzky, "Aristotle's Meteorologica" pp. 234-35 (= Maimonidean Essay s, p. 145). 24 These angels are to be distinguished from others that are in the raqiac and are material (in fact, the exhalations); see pp. 12:27, 15:29-16:4; 17:27-28; 19:18-25. Ibn Tibbon (p. 20:22) follows Maimonides in seeing the angels as God's messengers. On the homonymy of maVak Ibn Tibbon (p. 19:11-12) refers the reader to Guide 2.6. ^ On the identification of the Throne of Glory with the heaven see pp. 23:29-24:4, and Guide 1:9. Ibn Tibbon does not take a position on whether samayim comprises eight or nine spheres (pp. 19:1-8; 47:31-48:6). He describes the Throne in spatial terms, saying that it reaches from the upper heaven to the lower limit of the spheres, i.e., the sphere of the moon (p. 28:24-30). The heavenly bodies include the fixed stars (called seva' aw in Scripture), and the planets (mesaretaw); see p. 119:5. ^6 See Herbert A. Davidson, Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes on Intellect: Their Cosmologies, Theories of the Active Intellect, and Theories of the Human Intellect (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), pp. 45-48 (al-Fárábí), pp. 74-78 (Ibn Sïnâ), and pp. 223-31 (Ibn Rushd).

The intelligences and the heavenly bodies are not mentioned in Genesis, precisely because they are eternal (pp. 11:31; 13:2). The eternal motion of the spheres bears witness to the eternal existence of God and the intelligences (p. 22:2-6): the Mover can be known from the motion of the sphere (see Appendix C). Unlike samayim, the eternal heavenly spheres, raqia is the stratum of the element air that is penetrated and warmed by the rays of the sun: Genesis states of this layer that it "separates" water from water, a phrase Ibn Tibbon consistently understands as meaning that the "lower water"- the water in actu in the seas- is separated from the "upper water"- the water in potentia accumulated in the clouds (pp. 59:12-15; 137:12-138:30; 140:25-141:10; 142:30-143:21; 148:12-18).29 (Ibn Tibbon notes, though, that in Genesis 1:1 samayim is used homonymously to refer to raqia [p. 132:29-31; see also pp. 127:33- 128:5; 132:28-31; 136:9-12; 146:5-6].30) The main point here is that Ibn Tibbon takes the account in Genesis as pertaining not to the totality of material existence, but only to the sublunar world.31 He consequently points out that "world" (colam) is an equivocal term: "It is a name for the entire existence, upper and lower, material and immaterial, and it is [also] a name for the lower world only, i.e., for what is under the sphere of the moon, namely the four elements and what is compounded of them" (p. 20:7-9). The totality of sublunar existents can therefore be referred to either by the terms "world" tout court Çolam setam) or 58</page><page sequence="19">Gad Freudenthal "lower world" Colam safei) (p. 16:15-17). We should be mindful of the fact that in the context of the creation of the "world" we are using the term in the latter sense: " ['World'] is a name for all the existents whose creation is mentioned in [the account of] the six days of creation, namely the light, created on the first day, the raqia' [created] on the second day, the dry land and the plants created on the third day, the suspension of the luminaries on the fourth day, and the creations of the fifth and the sixth days- these alone are called 'world' " (p. 20:10-12; cf. p. 1 7:1 6-1 7).32 The scope of the coming-to-be covered by the term benah is the sublunar existents only.33 For Ibn Tibbon, the sublunar world comes to be through an entirely natural process, following natural necessities only. This process began with the appearance of light: When light came to be by God's word,34 or rather when it 27 For a detailed discussion of God's relationship to the heaven (or Throne of Glory), see pp. 21:17-22:3. ^ "Bless the Lord, O His angels, mighty creatures who do His bidding, even obedient to His bidding, Bless the Lord, all His hosts, His servants who do His will." ^ This part of Ibn Tibbon's account seems to follow Maimonides', on which see Klein- Braslavy, Maimonides' Interpretation, pp. 162-68. ^ It is this homonymy of samayim that allowed Ibn Tibbon to coin the term "otot ha- samayim as the name of the discipline that studies phenomena in the upper stratum of the air; i.e., in what really is the raqia' See Fontaine, Otot ha-Shamayim, pp. 4-6, "Introduction," lines 38-70. 31 Ravitzky, "Aristotle's Meteorologica," p. 233 (= Maimonidean Essays, pp. 144-45). 3^ Ibn Tibbon remarks that when the Sages say "ten things were created before the creation of the world," the term "world" refers precisely to these existents, which together make up the sublunar world. He refers to Β Pesahim 54a and Β Nedarim 39b, where, however, the number is given as seven. Cf. Kuzari 3:73. 33 Ravitzky, "Aristotle's Meteorologica," p. 234 and n. 39 (= Maimonidean Essays, p. 145) 59</page><page sequence="20">became strong enough to displace the darkness above tehom [i.e., above the surface of the water that covered the earth35], mountains began to be formed out of the terrestrial globe, forming valleys, i.e., creating cavities where formerly there were none. These cavities filled with water, and so the thickness of the water above the mountains that had been formed decreased. The more the thickness of the water above36 the mountains diminished [and the more water evaporated], the stronger the raqia became and the more was it formed above the water. The more the mountains and the cavities37 increased, the more the raqia increased: as one was being perfected, all were being perfected (pp. 133:31-134:4). Ibn Tibbon is describing a dynamic natural process. The light causes evaporation, which builds up the raqia?* This in turn (according to standard meteorological theory) increases the heat produced by the sun and accelerates evaporation. The existence of the raqiac is thus a consequence of the existence of light (e.g. p. 14:5-6). At the same time, mountains and cavities are formed, the water collects in the latter, and dry land emerges: "The birth of mountains is the creation of [dry] land," as confirmed by King David (Ps. 90:2) (p. 135:1-2). All these processes are posited in Aristotle's Meteorology?** Each phase is prior to the next one in the sense that it is its cause and also has a slight temporal priority (p. 134:11-13). Basically, however, the coming-to- be of the raqia' the gathering of the water, and the emergence of the land were all concomitant (pp. 127:27-29; 133:30-134:4; 134:11-18), as was also stated by the rabbis (pp. 134:6) and the prophets (Isa. 48:13). What set the entire process going, then, was the light, whose action produced the raqia' followed by all other existents. Ibn Tibbon holds that light was the first physical entity to appear (pp. 123:17-19, 24-26; 125:28-29; 152:8; see also 14:1), as attested by King 60</page><page sequence="21">Gad Freudenthal David (Ps. 104:2; p. 123:16-17) and several rabbinical dicta. All these texts "agree with what exists (lit. existence) as described by Ibn Sïnâ" (p. 133:22). Light preceded the appearance of the firmament and dry land (p. 127:7-11): "The ray of light that came to be on the first day is the first cause that the earth ceased to be in a state of tohu wa- bohu" (p. 147:28-29), i.e., entirely covered by water, in a sublunar world consisting of four concentric elemental shells (p. 147:13-14, 17-20). This construal also fits the account of creation in Genesis. In Ibn Tibbon's interpretation of the first three verses, the command "Let there be light" preceded the coming-to-be of the earth and the heaven, which indeed "were created through the intermediary [of the light]" (p. 128:6-15). The idea that it was the light that set the process going seems to imply that it appeared after it had not been. This raises a delicate problem. Ibn Tibbon states that light is produced by a material "intermediary" (p. 14:4), meaning the heavenly bodies,40 in their daily motion (p. 46:29-30). "*4 Ibn Tibbon's understanding of "God's word" and its naturalistic construal will be discussed later. ^5 "Before the creation described in the [account] of the six days of creation the earth was tehom, which is tantamount to saying that it was covered with deep water" (p. 130:11-13).

See the references in Ravitzky, "Aristotle's Meteorologica"; Klein-Braslavy, Maimonides* Interpretation of the Story of Creation. 61</page><page sequence="22">Now the heavenly bodies are co-eternal with God; Ibn Tibbon indeed states explicitly that it was not God's command "Let there be light" that brought them into being: "The trustworthy witness thereof [of their eternity] is that He did not say 'Let there be a luminary' or 'Let there be luminaries,' but rather said 'Let there be light' " (p. 126: 28-29).41 But if the luminaries have always existed, how could there have been darkness over the tehom} Ibn Tibbon's explanation relies on the notion that light is "an accident emanating from a luminous body when it encounters a body appropriate to receive it" (p. 126:29-30). He further states that "in front of God [lifney ha-Sem], there was light in any object appropriate to receive it, for there was no impediment [moneac] there" (p. 126:24- 25). The expression "in front of God" presumably means something like "from God's perspective," i.e., without regard to the actual state of the material world, in which various impediments prevent the light from illuminating objects "appropriate to receive it" and thereby make them invisible. Now before "creation"- i.e., when the sublunar world was structured in four concentric elemental shells- there was an "impediment over the tehom" (p. 126:25) that prevented the light from illuminating it, whence the initial darkness over it. The nature of this impediment is not specified, but Ibn Tibbon seems to have in mind the deep water itself: he refers to water as a dark element (p. 126:17) and elsewhere hints that it is this quality that prevented the light from illuminating the "surface over the tehom" (p. 135:23-24; cf. p. 149:6-8). The upshot is that God's command "Let there be light" did not bring light into being, but merely "removed it [the impediment] until light became visible and perceptible" (p. 126: 26). The command, Ibn Tibbon says, "fortified the light until it [the light] removed the darkness over the tehom, at such times when it is appropriate for it [the light] to be there" (i.e., during daytime and at the full moon; p. 126:27; cf. pp. 133:31-32; 135:22-24; 147:28-30). As a result, the primeval darkness of the surface of the globe came to an end (p. 126:16-17). Hence "Let there be light" means: "Let there be light where formerly there had been darkness 62</page><page sequence="23">Gad Freudenthal [namely, over the surface of the tehom]; i.e., let there be light in it [the tehom] and upon it, at such times as this is possible and appropriate" (p. 126: 22-24). Thereafter, there was light over the tehom part of the time and darkness at other times: the first time interval God called "day," and the other "night" (p. 126:17-20). After this the light over the tehom caused the strengthening of the raqia (p. 126:24; cf. p. 14:7), to which ^ As already understood by Jacob Ben Sheshet; see Sefer Mesiv devarim nekohim, ed. Georges Vajda (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1968), p. 99; chap. 6:45. In Ibn Tibbon's usage, the "intermediaries" are the separate intelligences and the heavenly bodies: the former accomplish God's word, the latter His will (pp. 10:29-30; 11:20-21; 13:22-24). In the present case, the intermediary is explicitly said to be material (p. 14:3-4), so that Ibn Tibbon can say that all material existents came to be without the intermediacy of an intelligence (maVak) (p. 14:13-14). 4* Ibn Tibbon explains that Genesis mentions the creation of the luminaries out of order (p. 156:20-21, 29), implicitly alluding to a well-known midrash that the luminaries were created on Day 1 but not suspended until Day 4. (The midrash is in Β Hagigah 12a, but Ibn Tibbon seems to quote the version [tela'an] as given in the Guide 2:30; see Klein-Braslavy, Creation, 155 n. 2). As he writes, "in the commentary on Ecclesiastes, apropos of the verse 'the sun rose and the sun set* [Eccles. 1:5], I became aware that the passage concerning the luminaries is out of place, and pointed this out, . . . indicating there where its appropriate place is according to the results of investigation in natural science; David (peace be upon him) also alluded to it" (p. 156:29-31). In fact, this is not in the commentary on the verse in question (PQ, §§155-58), but on Eccles. 3:7 (see PQ, §§305, 307-308, 315). The idea that the light had an immediate effect compels Ibn Tibbon to offer an interpretation of the Sages' statement that the luminaries were not suspended until the fourth day: "The effect [of the luminaries] when they were created was not the same after the fourth day, nor when the bodies affected by their light came to be, viz. the raqia' created on the second day and the earth created on the third" (p. 131:19-24; cf. p. 131:16-17- the luminaries "did not give light . . . until God said 'Let there be light' "). 63</page><page sequence="24">Scripture refers as "Let there be a raqiac" (p. 126:21); this set in motion the process of the coming-to-be of the sublunar world. Ibn Tibbon does not spell out his view of the transition from the state of darkness "over the te horn" to the state in which light and darkness alternate, but he seems to have had in mind a gradual natural process. He apparently thought of the "original" state of the sublunar world, when the shell of water encompassed the globe of the earth, as one in which darkness prevailed ("the surface of tehom is darkness" [p. 126:27]), because the dark water was not appropriate to receive light. Then, because of the primeval light, some of the water gradually evaporated, reducing the water's thickness and hence its darkness: this is the removal of the impediment. This reinforced the raqia' which in turn increased the heat in the sublunar world, thereby accelerating the evaporation. In this fashion, the deity's removal of the "impediment" is construed naturalistically. Thus Ibn Tibbon demonstrated that the cosmogony propounded by King David, in which light was the first entity to come to be, accords with truth and with Genesis. While Ibn Tibbon is certain of this cosmogony and of the physical reality of the processes as he described them, he allows for different grammatical construais of the first three verses of Genesis on the exegetical level (pp. 126:4-16; 126:33-127:19): all, however, posit that the light was the first created entity (cf. p. 125:31; cf. pp. 13:27-28, 32-33; 128:6-130:25). * So far, Samuel Ibn Tibbon has explained only the emergence of dry land. Much more is needed to complete his naturalistic reading of the biblical account of creation. Above all, how did the various things that Genesis says were created on days two through six come to be naturally? Minerals come to be together with mountains (p. 14:11); hence the main difficulty relates to living beings. A naturalistic explanation of 64</page><page sequence="25">Gad Freudenthal the emergence of the dry land is one thing; a naturalistic explanation of the coming-to-be of plants, animals, and human beings is quite another. To pursue his naturalistic exegesis consistently, Ibn Tibbon had to show that, after stretches of dry land emerged, plants, animals, and human beings came to be naturally without any progenitor. There was universal agreement among natural philosophers that some animate beings come to be without a parent, by "spontaneous generation": this had been stated by Aristotle42 and was in agreement with popular belief, including the Mishnah and the Talmud.43 Frogs, mice (p. 8:28- 30), and the legendary nasms were the favorite examples.44 But whether See the discussion and bibliography in Gad Freudenthal, Aristotle 's Theory of Material Substance.

When considering 65</page><page sequence="26">spontaneous generation could apply to "higher" living beings was controversial. Ibn Rushd followed Aristotle in holding that animate species persist through sexual reproduction only: "human is generated by human," Aristotle often stated, and he took the same to hold for all other animal species.45 In other words, spontaneous generation can occasionally produce an individual lower living being, but it cannot replace the normal form of procreation through chains of males and females of all species (cf. p. 8:12-21). It is precisely this assumption that underlay Ibn Rushd's belief that the surface of the earth could never have been completely under water: had it been, the species that reproduce only sexually- the vast majority of living beings- would have become extinct (p. 8:14-19). Ibn Sïnâ held the opposite view, as indeed he must, given that he believed the surface of the earth to be regularly flooded. Drawing on his theory of the active intellect as the Giver of Forms, he maintained that all living beings can be formed naturally without a parent, through the combined influence of the heavenly bodies and the active intellect.46 The heavenly bodies blend the sublunar matter, after which the active intellect endows suitably prepared clumps of matter with a corresponding form. Depending on the quality of the blend, this form will be a vegetative soul, an animal soul, or even a rational soul. Ibn Sïnâ's position was that the informing contribution of the parent is not indispensable for the generation of animals: although in most cases the form of a species is transmitted via the seed of a male individual of that species, matter can also be informed with the same form by the active intellect. That is, plants and animals usually come to be from a seed transmitted by a sire; but the same vegetative and animal souls are also produced- although more rarely- without parents. Most daring and controversial was Ibn Sïna's contention that not only can plants and animals be produced without a parent, but also humans endowed with the rational soul (p. 8:25-33).47 This stance allowed Ibn Sïnâ to affirm the thesis of the eternity of the world without having to count on divine 66</page><page sequence="27">Gad Freudenthal Providence to keep the living species from drowning.

Ibn Sïnâ's thoroughly naturalistic and heterodox position earned him a place of honor in the purgatories of Dante and of Immanuel of Rome.48 And it is this view that Ibn Tibbon accepted wholeheartedly and certainly with full awareness of its audacity. It allowed him to hold that the entire process of creation described in Genesis- from dry land through rational beings- was natural, the natural and inevitable result of the existence of the heavenly bodies and the separate intelligences.49 We have now arrived at a crucial juncture. As we have seen, Ibn Tibbon embraced Ibn Sïnâ's natural philosophy and used it as a second "semantic key," along with the Meteorology, for understanding the account of creation. Two ways (at least) were now open to him. He could go all the way down the road with Ibn Sïnâ and embrace the theory that the world is eternal, a cycle of periods during which the earth is entirely under water followed by eras in which dry land is formed. Or he could stop short and use only the "constructive" phase of Ibn Sïnâ's theory, which describes the emergence of dry land and emergence of life. This would be a scientific, rationalist interpretation of creation- and of the account in Genesis- as a unique and one-time process that led to the formation of the sublunar world in which we live.50 Some vacillation notwithstanding, Ravitzky ascribed to Ibn Tibbon the limited ambition of accounting naturalistically for the unique coming-to-be of our unique sublunar world.51 The central thesis of this paper, by contrast, is that Ibn Tibbon opted for scientific consistency 68</page><page sequence="29">Gad Freudenthal and thereby religious audacity. Ibn Tibbon, I will show, adheres in toto to Ibn Sïnâ's view of the natural history of our globe as an infinite cycle powered by natural forces. I submit that he followed Ibn Sïnâ in holding that after one period during which the water "gathers," in due course the entire surface of the globe is again flooded, as implied by the four- element theory.52 (Recall that Ibn Tibbon explicitly rejects Ibn Rushd's assertion that the heavenly bodies perpetually preserve some dry land.) To use the language of Scripture, the sublunar world regularly reverts to its state before "creation" and "a wind from God" again "sweeps over the water." Then the process of the emergence of dry land starts all over again: the eternal intelligences and heavenly spheres again set in motion a process of the "creation" of a sublunar world, exactly as depicted by both Genesis and Ibn Sïnâ. Ibn Tibbon thus subscribed to a version of the eternity thesis. He posits an infinite succession of "worlds," in which every sublunar "world" is created ab novo (mehuddas), but the world in the comprehensive sense is eternal (a parte ante and a parte post). The heavenly spheres remain forever unchanged, whereas the matter they circumscribe- the sublunar world- undergoes regular transformations in which dry land appears and is again submerged. The title of his treatise, Ma amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim (= The Treatise on 48 Inferno iv, 144; Mahbarot "Immanuel ha-Komi, ed. Dov Yarden (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1957), 28:90-98; quoted in Freudenthal, a(Al-)Chemical foundations," p. 66. Ibn Tibbon rejects the idea that specific individuals ever return; see p. 159:18-25. 5^ Such a piecemeal, selective, appropriation of a scientific theory is perfectly possible. Maimonides, for example, embraced Aristotelian natural philosophy, but only partially, for he rejected some of its essential components, notably the account of the supralunar realm and the (related) idea of the eternity of the world. 51 Ravitzky, "Aristotle's Meteorologica? pp. 246-47 (= Maimonidean Essays, pp. 153-54). 52 Ibn Sïnâ ascribed the regular flooding to geological processes (erosion), whereas Ibn Tibbon inferred it from the four-element theory. 69</page><page sequence="30">the Gathering of the Water) is singularly unambitious: the thrust and ambition of the work would have been better served by "The Treatise on the Coming-to-Be of the World" (where "world" refers to the sublunar world). But perhaps Ibn Tibbon preferred a title that would somewhat camouflage his heterodox audacity. Samuel Ibn Tibbon does not state his view forthrightly as a plain statement about the physical world. Rather, as he does throughout Ma? amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, he fleshes out his ideas and signals his full acceptance of Ibn Sïnâ's cosmology through his interpretations of various biblical verses, which he identifies as expressing that theory in their own language. These proof texts do not come from Genesis. According to Ibn Tibbon, Genesis is all but silent on the theory of eternally repeated creation (pp. 123:12-13; 144:9-14). He draws them instead from Genesis Rabbah, Ecclesiastes (chapter 3), and especially Psalms 103-104. Let us consider Ibn Tibbon's treatment of these texts, in the order he presented them. 1. Genesis Rabbah. Samuel Ibn Tibbon makes a smooth transition from the discourse of science to that of hermeneutics, within a single sentence. At the end of his exposition of Ibn Sïnâ's theory, he writes: "This is the gist of Ibn Sïnâ's statements, and it is the [very] belief in the creation of worlds and their destruction [beri' at colamot we- hurbanan] which the Sages of blessed memory have mentioned and which was widely accepted among them" (pp. 8:33-9:1). Ibn Tibbon of course refers to the midrashic statements that God created and destroyed numerous worlds before creating the present one. In Genesis Rabbah, notably, R. Abbahu is reported to have said: "The Holy-One- Blessed-Be-He created worlds and destroyed them, created worlds and destroyed them." Ibn Tibbon quotes this in full (p. 1 0:4-1 0).53 He obviously takes "world" here to mean "sublunar world" (p. 10:13; see above, p. 58-9) and understands the Sages to be expressing the same view as that propounded by Ibn Sïnâ and himself.54 By explicitly identifying Ibn Sïnâ's theory with the Rabbis' authoritative view Ibn 70</page><page sequence="31">Gad Freudenthal Tibbon implies that he fully accepts Ibn Sïnâ's account and, moreover, that the Sages already knew it to be true. At the same time he marks his opposition to Maimonides, who castigated R. Abbahu's statement with the observation that it implies the existence of infinite time and hence of the Aristotelian thesis of the eternity of the world (Guide 2:30).55 2. Ecclesiastes. Samuel Ibn Tibbon finds further support for his theory of eternally repeated "creations" in Ecclesiastes, on which he had written a commentary ten or more years before.56 Having identified Ibn Sïnâ's theory of cyclical formation and flooding of dry land with the Sages' view that worlds are created and destroyed, he goes on to identify both with ideas enunciated by Solomon.57 The statement (Eccles. 3:1) la-kol zeman we-cet le-kol hefes tahat ha- 5"* Genesis Rabbah 9:2, with a parallel in Genesis Rabbah 3:7. Other parallel texts are Ecclesiastes Rabbah 3 (on Eccles. 3:11) and Midrash Shoher Τον on Psalm 34 (ed. Solomon Buber [Vilna 1891], p. 245). 54 The Sages, however, did not affirm that this is an ongoing process and probably did not think that our own world will also be destroyed. 55 Ibn Tibbon devotes a lengthy discussion to a refutation of Maimonides' cosmogony as presented in Guide 2:30; see pp. 130:26-132:20. Contrary to Maimonides, Judah Halevy (Kuzari 1:67) has no problem embracing the thesis of ben at Olamot we- hurbanan. He seems to have overlooked that (as pointed out by Maimonides) it implies infinite time. See also below, n. 110. 56 According to Robinson {Samuel Ibn Tibbon's Commentary, p. 25), the commentary was completed between 1213 and 1221. M a3 amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim was completed in 1231 (see Appendix A). We will see below that in M a' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim Ibn Tibbon fundamentally modified his earlier understanding of certain verses in Ecclesiastes. 57 Ibn Tibbon sees an intertextual link between Ecclesiastes and Genesis Rabbah. He thereby follows R. Tanhuma as quoted in Genesis Rabbah 9:1-2: * 'And God saw all that He had made and it was good' [Gen. 1:31]. R. Tanhuma commenced: 'all was 71</page><page sequence="32">samayim ("a time is set for everything, a time for every experience under heaven"), he says, expresses precisely the idea that worlds are created and destroyed (p. 9:1-2). In his reading, la-kol zeman means "the world in its totality has a zeman and had a zeman" {li-klal ha- colam zeman, we-hayah zeman; p. 9:3). That is, zeman is synonymous with cet and cattah, both of which mean a specific instant, a point in time;58 colam again refers to the sublunar world. Thus the verse affirms that our present world, along with all past worlds, came to be at some specific point in time and for a definite period of time.59 Correspondingly, cet le-kol hefes expresses the idea that "there is a time [cet] for each thing [hefes] in the world and for each of God's purposes [hefsey ha-Sem]" (p. 9:3-4). He understands this to affirm that "[there is a time set] for all the comprehensive genera of existents in the world, including all their species" (cet ... le-kol sug mi-sugey ha-nimsa3ot se- bo ha-kolelim, cal kol mineyhem; p. 9:4-5). The point is not the trivial idea that each individual existent- this horse, this plant- comes to be at a specific point in time,60 but the bold claim that the species and the genera come to be and disappear at given points in time. This is why, according to Ibn Tibbon, Solomon goes on to enumerate the "things that are the highest genera of the composite existents " (p. 9:8), beginning with the noblest (man) and continuing by decreasing nobility to the "first compounds," i.e., minerals61 (p. 9:8-11). He immediately takes up this lowest kind of existent, presumably because it is the primary component of what is at stake here- the surface of the earth. Ibn Tibbon reads the verse cet lifros we-cet livnot ("A time [is set] for tearing down and a time for building up" [Eccles. 3:3]) as referring to the natural history of mountains: There is a time when the mountains cave in, their caving in being the cause of the earth's becoming entirely covered by water, [thus] returning to being tohu wa-bohu&gt; a tehome2 with darkness on its face: this is the destruction [hurban] of the 72</page><page sequence="33">Gad Freudenthal world. And there is a time for mountains to be formed, their formation being the cause of the emergence of land and the growing of plants on it by God's will, and of the birth of the animals with their different species: these [latter constructive processes] are the creations of the world, (p. 9:12-16) Ibn Tibbon refers to the first part of the verse (cet lifros) to perisat he-harim wa-harisatam (p. 9:12), the "tearing down and demolition of mountains/' which he takes as a hendiadys equivalent to the "caving made in due time* [Eccles. 3:11]. R. Tanhuma said: the world was created when it was due, and the world was not fit to be created earlier. R. Abbahu said: Hence we learn that the Holy-One-Blessed-Be-He created worlds and destroyed them, created worlds and destroyed them, until he created this one and [then] He said: 'This one pleases me and the others did not please me.' " The synonymy of the three terms is already stated in PQ, §277. Ibn Tibbon refers the reader to his definition of 'attah in Perus ha-millot ba-zarot, pp. 74-75. In his understanding, the three terms refer to a specific instant Çattah specifically refers to the instant separating the past from the future), not to a time interval or to "objective time" that "flows equably." ^ In Ibn Tibbon's scheme, time is of course co-eternal with the heavenly bodies and thus exists independently of the existence of a "world" (i.e., of any sublunar world). This was Ibn Tibbon's point in PQ, §281: "There is a life span for every [living creature that is] born, which it cannot exceed." In the commentary on Ecclesiastes (PQ, §275) the interpretation of the verse under discussion (Eccles. 3:1) is entirely different from that proposed here. Ibn Tibbon uses the term mateket, which usually means "metal," but the context makes it clear that he means minerals in general. As he himself notes, the terms mataket and mehsav or mosa* were not always clearly distinguished. See Perus ha- millot ha-zarot, s.w. mehsav (p. 54), mateket (p. 69). The word tehom is missing in the printed text. 73</page><page sequence="34">in" of mountains.63 In other words, "there is a point in time when the mountains cave in" (p. 9:12). This collapse of mountains and the subsequent return to a state of "a tehom with darkness on its face ... is the destruction [hurban] of the world" (p. 9:13-14)- evoking the midrashic idea of the serial creation and destruction of worlds. He identifies the collapse of the mountains and the resultant submersion of the surface of the globe with the latter's again becoming "tohu wa-bohuy a tehom with darkness on its face": the natural destructive processes lead to exactly the state that prevailed prior to "creation." This identification also produces a strong link between Ibn Sïnâ's geology and three Jewish authoritative texts (Ecclesiastes, Genesis Rabbah, and Genesis) and implies that the process of creation as described in Genesis is restarted time and again. Similarly, the statement that the return to the state of tohu wa-bohu (using the language of Genesis) is "the destruction of the world" (the phraseology of Genesis Rabbah) links the two texts and implies that the process described is a phase in a cyclical process. The constructive phase is represented by cet livnot, "a time for building up," which Ibn Tibbon takes to mean that there is a fixed time when mountains are again formed (le-hibbanut he-harim): dry land emerges from the water and plants and animals are produced (p. 9:14-15). Significantly, he says of this phase that it is "the creations [plural!] of the world" (beri'ot ha-colam; p. 9:16).64 An equivalent phrase appears when Ibn Tibbon explains the meaning of the pair "a time for silence and a time for speaking" (Eccles. 3:7): this "may allude to the idea of the creation of worlds and their destruction," he says (p. 9:23-24), but without explaining this suggestion further. Ibn Tibbon refers to Solomon's view as the doctrine of "paired points in time" (zugot ha-cittim; p. 9:18-19). Although he does not explicitly define this term, the idea seems to be that the natural history of the world consists of consecutive pairs of contrary processes (viz., all processes of generation and corruption, such as the formation/ 74</page><page sequence="35">Gad Freudenthal destruction of mountains; precipitation/evaporation; etc.). Ibn Tibbon takes this doctrine to offer clues (remizot) for understanding the Work of Creation (Ma'aseh Beresit), and considers his insight to be a significant innovation, one that came to him by divine inspiration (ruah ha-qodes) (p. 9:20-21). Ibn Tibbon also connects the passage in Ecclesiastes with the statement in Genesis Rabbah concerning the repeated cycles of destruction and creation. He affirms (p. 10:11-12) that "a time is set for everything (la-kol zeman)" means exactly the same thing as R. Tanhuma's statement in the midrash (9:2) that "He [God] has made everything (ha-kol) well at its appropriate time (be-citto)." In both verses kol denotes the sublunar world; hence both refer to the "creations Ibn Tibbon refers the reader to his commentary on Ecclesiastes, where he explains why cei lifros we-^et livnot is to be understood as referring to the coming-to-be of minerals and mountains. In PQ, §384 he says that "the coming-to-be of inanimate substances, such as the species of stones and metals, is like the coming-to-be of mountains, [and this is why] he [Qohelet] compared it to that of buildings, and their corruption to the tearing down of a building 'pertsat binyan]" (similarly PQ, §285). One may wonder why Ibn Tibbon mentioned mountains in this context and whether it indicates that when he wrote the commentary on Ecclesiastes he already subscribed to Ibn Sïnâ's theory of mountain formation. This is not the case, however. Ibn Tibbon mentions the formation of mountains here simply because he takes Eccles. 3:1-8 to parallel the creation story as told by Moses (see e.g. PQ, §§279, 283, 304). While this reading naturally supposes that the water " gathers " as a result of the formation of mountains, Ibn Tibbon still has no inkling of how they are formed and even less of the idea that they are repeatedly torn down (PQ, §305). This change in Ibn Tibbon's understanding confirms yet again that the encounter with Ibn Sïnâ's Shifã* occurred late and had a momentous impact on his views (cf. above n. 20). MS bnat ha-colam&gt; but the context makes the printed version (repeated at p. 1 0:1 Ο- Ι 1) preferable. 75</page><page sequence="36">of the [sublunar] world" (p. 10:10-1 1).65 3. Psalms. But the most significant confirmation of the cyclic character of the natural history of the sublunar world comes from King David. Samuel Ibn Tibbon thinks that the last four verses of Psalm 103 and Psalm 104 form a single unit (pp. 122:15-123:19), in which David "alluded to profound secrets of Ma'aseh Beresit" (p. 123:18-19).66 He identifies here, first, a description of the process of creation that corresponds to the account in Genesis- specifically, how the water gathered (p. 121:15-16; 144:16-146:24) and nutrition was prepared for plants and animals (p. 152:6-155:33), and then, more important, secrets that Moses "had concealed or suppressed totally" (p. 123:12-13; 144:9- 14) but which King David revealed. "David's allusions bear mainly on what was created prior to the creation of the world" (p. 18:13-14). In an elaborate exegesis, Ibn Tibbon patiently interprets these psalms and shows how they describe the same cosmogony he had already extracted from Genesis (pp. 123-130). Here I shall consider only his claim that David, too, held the view that creation is an eternally recurring process. To begin with, the existence of the heavenly bodies is consequent upon the existence of God and by implication they are co-eternal with Him. Ps. 104:1 states: "O Lord, my God, You are very great; You are clothed in glory and majesty [hod we-hadar' wrapped in a robe of light." "This is as if he [David] said: 'You emanated [hispa'ta] glory and majesty/ " Ibn Tibbon comments, and goes on to explain: "He [God] is an Existence [mesi'ut] that emanates [se-maspiac] other existents [nimsa'ot]: not existents that have no dignity, though, but rather existents that are glory and majesty to Him Who brought them into being" (p. 124:18-21). He continues: By [the words] "glory" and "majesty" [hod we-hadar] he [David] alluded to the two species of existents that emanate from Him Blessed Be He: the first species- or rather the first [individual] belonging to this species- emanates from Him 76</page><page sequence="37">Gad Freudenthal directly, without the intermediacy of anything else [lit: without the intermediacy of any other species].67 The second species [of existents] emanates from God through the intermediacy of the first species. These two species, which are denoted by the words "glory" and "majesty," are [1] the serafim placed at the Throne [of Glory; Kisse3 (ha-Kavod)], and [2] the entire Throne. ... Thus "glory" refers to the serafim and "majesty" refers to the Throne, (p. 124: 24-29) For readers who may have missed his point, Ibn Tibbon spells it out: "It is known that the species [min] 'angels' [mal'akim] emanates from God by primary [i.e., direct, immediate] emanation 'sefiah ri'sonit], for they are separate intelligence^] too [i.e., like the deity Himself68]. ... And the species 'upper heaven/ which is the Throne of Glory, without any doubt, emanates from God, Blessed Be He, through the intermediacy of the serafim, as the wise men know" (p. 124:29-32).69 The upshot Ibn Tibbon (p. 10:12) notes the absence of the word "well" (yafeh) in Ecclesiastes 3:1 ("a time is set for everything"), which by contrast does appear in R. Tanhuma's statement. Ibn Tibbon discusses the texts from Genesis Rabbah and Ecclesiastes, on the one hand, and those from Psalms, on the other, at the beginning and toward the end of the work, respectively. It would seem that Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim was not written in one piece; perhaps thorough research will allow to establish a relative chronology of its parts. The first species (min) of existents to emanate are the intelligences; the phrase "the first [individual] belonging to this species" refers to the first emanated intelligence. Ravitzky pointed out that Ibn Tibbon does not follow Maimonides in positing a hiatus between God and the emanated beings; see his "Necessary and Possible Existence: Maimonides' Ontology According to his Interpreters" (Heb.), Maimonidean Essays, pp. 205-38, on p. 219. 77</page><page sequence="38">is that the intelligences and the heavenly spheres are co-eternal with God.70 Indeed, the Sages had stated that the Throne of Glory was created before the creation of the world (p. 146:3 1-32).71 Ibn Tibbon connects the verse just considered with the verse "the magnificence [kavod] of the Lord will endure forever; the Lord will rejoice in His works!" (Ps. 104:31): "God's magnificence will be forever, [namely,] because existence has always persisted in the same pattern in which it was brought into being by Him; and the glory [hod] and majesty [hadar], which were His garments when the world was created, He wears forever [la-nesah], and their effects then [at that time] are the same as their effects at any [other] time [pe'ullatam 3az hu pe'ullatam be-kol cet]" (p. 160:1-4). "This," Ibn Tibbon adds, "is [the meaning of the phrase 'His magnificence endures forever [kevodo le- 'olam; Ps. 72:19]': bringing these72 existents into being and preserving them as long as this is possible for them, and doing so perpetually [tamid]- this is magnificence for Him, and it is so perpetually too" (p. 160:4-5). The same idea is expressed in another verse of the same psalm: "He makes the clouds His chariot, moves on the wings of the wind" (Ps. 104:3). Ibn Tibbon remarks that since the existence of clouds is fleeting, there can be no relationship whatsoever all between them and God (p. 139:24). Rather, this verse states God's relationship to the existents that He brought into being, [thereby] going beyond the indications given by Moses (peace be upon him) in the account of creation. Namely: what has been indicated there [in the story of creation] is what takes place [lit. exists] always; nothing changes in it [ha-nirmaz sam hu3 ha-nimsa3 tamid, lo3 yistanneh bo davar]. This is what Solomon (peace be upon him) said: 'What is occurring occurred long since, and what is to occur occurred long since' [Eccles. 3:15]. [Thus,] it is known that light and darkness exist every 78</page><page sequence="39">Gad Freudenthal day, and that they are the primary causes of coming-to-be and passing-away. The existence of the raqia' too, is permanent [or: perpetual (temidi)], and so is the earth's giving rise to vegetation and trees, as well as to other living beings that are not born to an individual of their species. ... Of this sort, i.e., the sort of the account of creation, is God's riding on Aravot or on a "high and lofty Throne" [Isa. 6:1], which is a metaphor for an unvarying, perpetual, and eternal relationship [^erek bilti mistarme h temidi nishi]. So also in the account of creation he [Moses] indicated nothing other than God's relationship to the existents that He brought into being through the intermediacy of His celestial retinue [pamalyah], to whom He addressed His words ['amirah].73 The relationship of the existents to one another is in proportion to the excellence74 of their perpetual, eternal relationship (pp. 139:25-140:4). Although Moses himself did not reveal it, the process of creation described in Genesis is repeated eternally: "What is indicated there [in Genesis] is what takes place always; nothing changes in it" (p. 139:26- ^ See n. 24 above. The identity of the Throne of Glory with the "upper heaven" is stated repeatedly (e.g., pp. 17:12-13, 168:14-15). On the emanation of the "angels" from God see also p. 118:26-27, 30-32. See also p. 17:1 1-12 on the simultaneity of the heaven, alias the Throne of Glory, and the intelligences, alias the serafim. 71 Β Pesahim 54a. Ibn Tibbon had quoted this saying in PQ; see below, p. 87. At p. 160:4 reading with the MS ha-nimsa3ot ha-hem. Ibn Tibbon has in mind the commands like "Let there be light." The pamalyah to whom they were addressed comprises the separate intellects and the heavenly bodies, which, in his understanding, emanate from them (p. 11:1-6). At p. 140:4 reading the MS ke-rov cerkam. 79</page><page sequence="40">27). This cannot be otherwise, seeing that "God's relationship to the existents that He brought into being" (p. 139:25) is "an immutable, perpetual, and eternal relationship" (p. 140:1-2). Consider now the following verse, which at first blush may seem to challenge Ibn Tibbon's entire enterprise: "He established the earth on its foundations, so that it shall never totter" (bal timot colam wa-ced [Ps. 104:5]). Does not this statement imply that the earth will never be immersed? Ibn Tibbon does not formulate this possible objection explicitly, but his comment responds to it: "The meaning of 'it shall never totter' is that it will not totter, i.e., it will never deviate from the manner on which He established it (lo' tasur min ha-Hnyan se-yesadah calaw) for all eternity" (p. 144:5-7). This verse, too, then, alludes to the lawfulness ordained by God, which endures forever. Elsewhere Ibn Tibbon is even more outspoken: the words "so that it shall never totter," he says, "allude to the eternity (lirmoz cal ha-nishut) [of the world]" (p. 146:30). He adds the telling observation that Maimonides himself (Guide 2:28) noted that the statement "it shall never totter" can be (mis-)understood as a reference to "the eternity [of the world] that is stronger than Solomon's saying 'the earth remains the same forever' (we-ha-'ares le-colam omadet [Eccles. 1:4])" (p. 144:7-9).75 This interpretation allows Ibn Tibbon to deal with another verse whose literal reading threatens his theory: "You set bounds [to the waters] they must not pass, so that they never again cover the earth" (Ps. 104:9). He admits that the first part of the verse might be taken to mean that "the waters that are gathered in the place He established for them will not pass the assigned bounds" and consequently "the waters will not cover the earth again" (p. 146:31-33). This reading is ruled out, however, by the second part, which means precisely "it shall never totter" (pp. 146:33-147:1), expressing the idea that the waters will always follow the same manner or the same natural laws. Although one wishes that Ibn Tibbon's explanation was clearer, the bottom line is that he takes this verse, too, to affirm the eternity of the world (p. 146:30). 80</page><page sequence="41">Gad Freudenthal Samuel Ibn Tibbon had to deal with another difficulty, too. According to entrenched tradition, particularly emphasized by Maimonides, Moses was the greatest Jewish prophet, and nothing should or could ever be added to the Torah. Yet Ibn Tibbon himself conceded that the Torah is silent on the eternity thesis, which is most strongly indicated in Psalms 103-104. What, then, is the status of Psalms as compared to that of Genesis? Ibn Tibbon's explicitly stated view is that David revealed truths that Moses had deliberately concealed (p. 123:1-4). Thus, as already noted, Ibn Tibbon says of Psalms 103-104 that they "allude to what the Master of the Prophets had concealed or suppressed totally" (p. 123:12-13), a topos already found in the Midrash.76 He thus qualifies David's statement to the effect that the earth "shall never totter"- on his interpretation, the eternity thesis- as "a real addition" (tosefet gemurah; p. 144:9-11) or a true "innovation" (hiddus; p. 146:24), to a matter on which Genesis makes at best a very opaque allusion (p. 144:12-13). The same holds of other truths not stated in Genesis (p. 152:11-24). David went well beyond what Moses had revealed, especially in indicating the things "that had been created before the [sublunar] world was created" (p. 18:13-14). To ground 75 Already in the Perus ha-millim ha-zarot (s.v. nifsad, p. 76), Ibn Tibbon suggested that Maimonides endorsed this opinion expressed by Solomon (as well as by King David). From a different perspective, Fraenkel (From Maimonides to Samuel Ibn Tibbon, pp. 162-76), too, concluded that Ibn Tibbon thought that Maimonides presupposed the eternity thesis in several of his arguments and that this is why he did not include the doctrine of hiddus ha-colam among the fundamentals of the Torah. Here Ibn Tibbon does not distinguish between eternity a parte ante and eternity a parte post. 76 Vajda (Recherches, p. 18 n. 2) notes that Exodus Rabbah 15:22 (on Exod. 12:2) holds that David made many things explicit that Moses had left concealed, offering as an example a comparison of Genesis 1 and Psalm 104. Ibn Tibbon's allusion to "some interpreters" (p. 123:13) who had held a view like his own may refer to this midrash. 81</page><page sequence="42">this far-reaching claim, Ibn Tibbon repeatedly suggests- and this is an important part of his argumentative strategy- that the Psalmist was writing by mah ha-qodes or mah ha-Sem, two synonyms that denote wisdom inspired by God (137:17-22): "It would seem that the divine spirit aroused him to make these additions [to what is stated in Genesis]. [This is] as the prophet [Jeremiah] says: '[God's word] was like a raging fire in my heart, shut up in my bones; I could not hold it in, I was helpless' Qer. 20:9]" (p. 144:11-12; see also pp. 21:25, 28:23; 123:1- 4, 11-19; 142:32; 143:23-26, 29; 146:23; 152:12; 153:1). Going beyond Moses was not rashness on David's part; rather, he was merely giving expression to divine inspiration. This in turn legitimizes Ibn Tibbon's uncovering of hidden meanings in the Psalms. We can now understand how Ibn Tibbon could view Psalms 103-104 (as well as Psalm 18) as containing exceptionally deep and well concealed "mysteries of the Torah" (sitrey Torah; p. 149:21-24). Indeed Ibn Tibbon said that even some of his own insights into Scripture, related to Ma'aeh Beresit, came to him "as if by divine inspiration" (p. 9:20). Ibn Tibbon explains that he saw fit to make these secrets plain notably because they have become known to the gentiles, who ridicule Israel for apprehending only the overt meaning of the prophets' words (p. 173:1-12; 175:5-15). Let me summarize what we have seen thus far. In Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim Samuel Ibn Tibbon gives a two-part account of Ma'aeh Beresit, The first part is a naturalistic construal of the description in Genesis: it explains how, starting from a state in which the surface of the globe was entirely covered with water, dry land gradually emerged, and how the plant and animal species came to be through the action of the eternal intelligences and heavenly bodies. Drawing on Aristotle's Meteorology and on Ibn Sïnâ's Shifã' Ibn Tibbon explains naturalistically how the sublunar world came to be through natural 82</page><page sequence="43">Gad Freudenthal necessities. God's speech acts, which according to Genesis caused the creation process, are also construed naturalistically. Because a separate form does not speak physically (p. 32:26-27; see also p. 37:11-14), the biblical commands ("Let there be ... ") are merely "an indication to what is witnessed and known concerning their [the intelligences'] actions" (p. 33:10-1 1).77 This part of the naturalistic account posits a one-way, purely constructive process, leading to the structured sublunar world as we know it. Next comes the second part, the most significant and daring, of Ibn Tibbon's cosmogony. He takes Genesis to refute Ibn Rushd's contention that the surface of the globe can never be flooded entirely. He therefore acknowledges that the inherent tendency of the four elements to segregate from one another regularly leads to a state in which the sublunar world (again) consists of four concentric elemental shells. He further follows Ibn Sïnâ in positing an endless alternating cycle of the constructive and destructive processes: periods in which the earth is entirely submerged (as it was at the beginning of the phase described in Genesis) are followed by periods in which dry land emerges and all plant and animal species come forth. This is an infinite cyclic process. Ibn Tibbon expounds this view and provides it with religious legitimacy through a detailed exegesis of three canonic texts- Genesis Rabbah, Ecclesiastes, and Psalms. A central building block of this view is the tenet that the supralunar realm of the celestial spheres and bodies is eternal. Here, In his earlier commentary on Ecclesiastes (PQ, §304) Ibn Tibbon says that the Master of the Prophets "described the creation of all existents in terms of speech acts (sipper ben at kol ha-nimsaim bilson 'amirah)." He follows Maimonides' discussion of the homonymy of '.m.r. in Guide 1:65. Some of the speech acts that Scripture ascribes to the intelligences Ibn Tibbon construes as referring to the process of bringing to existence through emanation; see pp. 35:30-36:1. 83</page><page sequence="44">of course, Ibn Tibbon falls away from Maimonides, whom he takes to have affirmed that both the supra- and the sublunar realms were created ab novo. Thus, whereas Maimonides took Genesis to describe the creation of everything that exists, Ibn Tibbon held it to describe the coming-to-be of the lower world only. The differences in the interpretations of the various terms and verses in Genesis follow logically from this. IV. Cosmology in Samuel Ibn Tibbon's Commentary on Ecclesiastes Did Samuel Ibn Tibbon already harbor his audacious theory of the eternity of the world when he wrote his commentary on Ecclesiastes? With the insights derived from M a' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim at the back of our minds we can identify in this work surreptitious allusions to his version of the eternal-world theory and shed further light on what was new in Ma* amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim. Ibn Tibbon, as already mentioned, stated that Maimonides {Guide 2:28) observed that Qohelet was understood to have embraced the eternity thesis. Ibn Tibbon agrees with this understanding: "There is no doubt that all these verses, from ca generation comes and a generation goes' [Eccles. 1:4] to the verse now under consideration [viz. 'all the rivers go to the sea'; Eccles. 1:7], point to the eternity [thesis], as the True Sage said in Chapter 28 of the second part [of the Guide]" (PQ, §189).78 The philosophers, Ibn Tibbon writes, affirm that nothing that comes into existence after having been non-existent can persist eternally,79 but Qohelet believed that "some existents, [although] created ab novo, persist eternally, namely the world in its entirety, which, according to our belief and that of the majority of the followers of the Torah of Moses, came to be [after not having been]. And from the words of this sage [Qohelet] in this book it is clear that 84</page><page sequence="45">Gad Freudenthal he upholds [or: believes in80] its eternity [ma'amin be-nishiyyuto]" (§210).81 Our reading of Ma amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim has alerted us to the equivocation of the term "world" in Ibn Tibbon's usage. We should ask whether the view that he ascribes here to Qohelet (and which he shares) is the Aristotelian view, according to which all material reality (the sub- and supralunar realms, including all vegetable and animal species) is eternal, or the weaker thesis, expounded in M a* amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, according to which only the supralunar realm is eternal {a parte ante and a parte post), whereas the sublunar species come to be and pass away cyclically. In his commentary on Ecclesiastes Ibn Tibbon is less outspoken than in the later monograph, but, as we shall see, it is clear that he was already committed to the view that the heavenly bodies are eternal. Ibn Tibbon takes the verse "there is time for silence" (Eccles. 3:7) to refer to the silence prior to the speech acts (dibbury 'amirah) by which "all existents were created" (PQ, §304). This, as he points out, presupposes that time existed prior to creation, a notion that in turn implies that the heavenly bodies (without whose revolutions there is no time) existed then, too. Ibn Tibbon subtly expresses his argument in the following concise passage: See also PQ, §§165-66. In fact, Maimonides distances himself from this possible understanding. For a survey of the views of Jewish philosophers on whether or not the created world will have an end see Seymour Feldman, "The End of the Universe in Medieval Jewish Philosophy," Association for Jewish Studies Review 11 (1986): 53-77. On the ambiguity of the verb 'm.n. in medieval Hebrew see Shalom Rosenberg, "Emunah and Epistemic Categories in Medieval Jewish Thought" (Heb.), Derakim h- 'emunah ba-yahadut (= Ha-kinnus ha-senati le mahsevet ha-yahadut 23) (Jerusalem: Ministry of Education, 1981), pp. 85-102. This is precisely Maimonides' claim in Guide 2:27. 85</page><page sequence="46">The pair "there is time for silence and there is time for speech" is stated [by Qohelet] solely in order to refer to the ab novo coming-to-be (hiddus) of the entire world.82 For he [Qohelet] already fully explained that the coming-to-be of the three genera mentioned [minerals, plants, and animals] depends on time (cei), and on those [existents] upon whose existence time is consequent (mi se-ha-cet nimsak 'ahar mesiutam) [viz., the celestial spheres]. He saw fit to promulgate the ab novo coming-to-be (hiddus) [of the world], so that you do not think that the coming-to-be of these genera has always proceeded like this, without a beginning. No! Rather, there was a time (cet) of silence, prior to their existence, [during which] those [existents] upon whom time hinges (mi se-ha-cet taluy bahem) had not been commanded to bring them into existence. And there was time for speech- namely [time] to speak and command those [existents] upon whom time hinges to bring them [the three genera] into existence. [Qohelet] followed the language of the Master of the Prophets, who described the creation of all existents in terms of speech (*amirah). He also had to mention the contrary of speech and command, which is the silence prior to that speech act [of creation]. You note that he followed the opinion that the Throne of Glory had been created prior to the creation of the world, so that those [existents] upon whom time hinges had existed. Otherwise, the silence preceding [creation] would not have been in time (lo3 hayetah cet la-hasayah ha- qodemet), for then there would have been no time prior to those acts of speech. (PQ, §304) The wording is cautious and guarded, but the ideas are clear: Qohelet's statement that there is time for "silence" refers to the time (in the sense of duration or interval) during which the "three genera"- i.e., the totality of sublunar reality- had not yet come to be. Ibn Tibbon's 86</page><page sequence="47">Gad Freudenthal crucial point is that this period of "silence'' is explicitly said to have been in time, a statement implying that the existents upon whose existence time is consequent- the celestial bodies - already existed. Ibn Tibbon understands Qohelet's phrase "there is time for silence" as conveying at one and the same time two ideas: first, that "the world" - i.e., the sublunar material reality- came to be after a "silence," i.e., after not having been (Qohelet thus affirms the thesis of hiddus ha-colam); second, that the heavenly bodies "upon whose existence time is consequent" are eternal. The latter idea is identified with the traditional notion that the Throne of Glory "was created prior to the creation"83 (i.e. prior to the coming-to-be of the sublunar world), an argument which we already know from Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim. We are left to understand that the Throne of Glory is identical with the celestial spheres. In the commentary on Ecclesiastes Ibn Tibbon does not say this in so many words, as he later does in Ma3 amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, but he comes very close to it: "The silence [preceding creation] hinged on time, for those [existents] upon whom time hinges already existed, for the Throne of Glory already existed" (PQ, §306). That Ibn Tibbon takes the heavenly spheres to be eternal can also be inferred from the following reasoning: "The existence [mesi'ut] of God and His governance of the world are apprehended [tusag] by man through the motions of the heaven [tenu'ot ba-samayim] and its powers. For His existence is [or can be] apprehended through the ^ Here the word "entire" does not denote the supra- and sublunar worlds. It is added in order to highlight the contrast with the preceding discussion, which concerned the coming-to-be of the constituents of the sublunar world, namely the three genera (which are mentioned again in the next sentence). Ibn Tibbon thus has in mind the sublunar world only; see also the quotation from PQ, §305 below. Ibn Tibbon repeats this statement elsewhere too: see PQ, §§196, 210. See also above, nn. 32 and 71. 87</page><page sequence="48">heaven's regular motion [tenu'at ba-samayim ha-tedirab] and from the fact that it persists ceaselessly [we-hatmidah beli hefseq]" (PQ, §512; see further below).84 Elsewhere he refers to "accidents" that are produced by "the motion of bodies whose motion is unceasing, namely the spheres": it is to them that David referred in "He made them endure forever, establishing an order that shall never change" (Ps. 148:6), conveying the idea "that they themselves [the spheres], as well as their regularities, persist [eternally; hem wehuqehem comedimY (PQ, §165). This interpretation is corroborated by a brief passage in which Ibn Tibbon explains Qohelet's understanding of the thesis that the world was created ab novo: We say that he [Qohelet] understood the ab novo creation [hiddus] of the world- i.e. [lit. and] the Account of Macaeh Beresit and the Account of the Six Days of Creation- as comprising only [the following]: the creation of the raqiac created on the second day; the [creation of] dry land and of the sea and of the plants created on the third [day]; .... the suspending of the Luminaries that took place on the fourth [day]; [the creation of] the sea animals and of the birds created on the fifth [day]; and [the creation of] the land animals and of man, created on the sixth [day]. Only the creation of these is mentioned in the Account of the Six Days. (PQ, §305) Clearly Ibn Tibbon already understands raqiac to denote a layer of the element air, as he does later in Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, to be distinguished from the eternal celestial spheres, referred to as samayim (which, however, is equivocal, and occasionally may have the same sense as raqia*)^ Ibn Tibbon encapsulates his cosmogony in the statement that "there was no one single coming-to-be of all [existents], upper and lower" (PQ, §307). He perceptively anticipates that a doctrine that thus 88</page><page sequence="49">Gad Freudenthal denies the traditional understanding of creation may displease certain readers (PQ, §307). * Thus Samuel Ibn Tibbon's commentary on Ecclesiastes already presupposes the audacious belief that the heavenly bodies are eternal. In this work, too, therefore, just as in Ma amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, when Ibn Tibbon refers to the creation of athe world/' he has in mind the sublunar world only. Note, however, that at that stage he had not yet framed the idea that the sublunar world undergoes cycles of submergence and emergence of dry land. On the contrary, the verse "all the streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full" (Eccles. 1:7) elicits a short account of the relationship between rivers and the sea. Ibn Tibbon explains that evaporation keeps the sea from ever being full and that the sun's regular yearly motion guarantees that the element water "persists self-same, without increase" (PQ, §178); so does the element earth, as already stated (PQ, §154, see also PQ, §§88, 182). Ibn Tibbon thus concludes that the regular heavenly motions are "the causes for both [elements] persisting in the same manner (cal cinyan 3ehad): I mean the persistence of the earth- notwithstanding all the See Ravitzky, "Necessary and Possible Existence: Maimonides* Ontology According to his Interpreters" (Heb.), in Maimonidean Essays, pp. 205-38, on p. 223. Cf. PQ, §147; and the variant reading in Robinson, " Dissertation, " Appendix B, no. 3 (p. 515). (The texts published by Robinson in this appendix survive in a single manuscript. I tend to consider them to be authentic and therefore occasionally refer to them here and in what follows. None of my interpretations hinges on this assumption, however.) As he was to do in Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, too, Ibn Tibbon connects Abraham Ibn Ezra with the identification of the raqia' with a stratum of the air; see PQ, §306. The distinction between raqiac and samayim is already found in Otot ha- shamayim; see above, n. 30. 89</page><page sequence="50">things that come to be from it, it does not diminish; and the persistence of the sea- although all rivers flow into it, it does not become full" (PQ, §179; similarly PQ, §§184, 187). Ibn Tibbon clearly believed that neither the sea nor the earth ever disappear (we will return to this point soon). This interpretation is corroborated by the treatment of the Flood, to which Ibn Tibbon refers in his commentary even though it is not mentioned in Ecclesiastes. Qohelet states (Eccles. 1:10) that things that appear to be novel have in fact already occurred in the past. Ibn Tibbon assents, of course, but qualifies the statement by observing that miracles are an exception: they are novel, unprecedented occurrences (PQ, §199). To drive home the point he remarks that unless this stipulation is made, someone could disprove Qohelet's assertion by arguing "that the Flood is a novel [phenomenon]." Unless it is agreed that miracles are novel, how would we answer this objection, Ibn Tibbon asks rhetorically: "Would you tell him: 'to be sure, it [the Flood] already occurred long since, in ages that were before us?' (ibid.). This reductio ad absurdum argument assumes as an indubitable premise that the Flood was a unique- "novel"- event. Ibn Tibbon fittingly characterizes the Flood (and other miracles) as a situation in which the regularly operating causes (i.e., those produced by the heavenly bodies) did not cease their activity, although their effects were no longer produced.86 We recall that in Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, by contrast, the flooding of the entire surface of the globe is construed as a regular natural occurrence, i.e., as the exact opposite of a miracle. It is noteworthy that in that work Ibn Tibbon never mentions the biblical deluge. The reason for this somewhat disappointing silence on a directly relevant issue is presumably that he did not know how to fit it into his scheme: he embraced Ibn Sïnâ's view that animals and humans are regularly generated without a sire, which is incompatible with the biblical story of the Flood.87 In his commentary on Ecclesiastes, then, just as he was to do in 90</page><page sequence="51">Gad Freudenthal M a* amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, Ibn Tibbon takes King Solomon to have divulged certain verities that Moses had concealed. Similarly, he already understands King David's Psalms as containing cosmogonie secrets: Psalm 104 was "indubitably composed to adduce allusions concerning the secrets of the Account of Creation" (PQ, §195). In line with his general, markedly progressivist philosophy of history,88 Ibn Tibbon thinks that humanity had made some progress in the interval between Moses and Solomon, which allowed the latter to enunciate truths that the former had seen fit to hide (PQ, §§309, 558). Still, he observes that Solomon was cautious not to formulate his doctrine too Variant reading in Robinson, "Dissertation," Appendix B, §111, pp. 509-510. At PQ, §388 Ibn Tibbon gives the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah as an instance of another singular event; both occurrences are given as examples of "novel" and unique occurrences in PQ, §387. Building on the assumptions of M a3 amar Yiqqawu h α-may im, Ibn Tibbon could have gone on to construe the biblical Flood as a unique, miraculous phenomenon, arguing that it was the result of forty days of rain and not one of the regular natural floods described by Ibn Sïna. Even in this view, though, the biblical story is in conflict with Ibn Tibbon 's theory, inasmuch as the latter asserts that, once extinguished, all living species come to be "spontaneously" on the surface of the earth; this idea obviously undermines the account in Genesis. See, e.g., PQ, §312: "The student may become cognizant of something his master had missed, and vice versa. This is how the sciences increase." Indeed Ibn Tibbon disagreed with Maimonides on crucial points and did not hesitate to state this explicitly (e.g. PQ, §§17, 35, 369). On the progressivism of knowledge see also PQ, §§243, 558, Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, pp. 149:28-30 and 172-75, as well as p. 52:25-28 (progress in astronomy). The progress of knowledge, i.e., the elimination of errors from one's intellect, is an aspect of divine providence (pp. 40:33-41:33, esp. 41:25-28). See also A. Ravitzky, "R. Samuel Ibn Tibbon and the Secret of the Guide of the Perplexed" (Heb.), Maimonidean Essays, pp. 81-106, on pp. 99-101. 91</page><page sequence="52">bluntly: Ibn Tibbon believes that Solomon worded certain verses so as to be consistent with both the eternity of the world and its creation ab novo. The insight into Samuel Ibn Tibbon's cosmological and cosmogonie views in his commentary on Ecclesiastes opens the way to a better understanding of the thrust and novelty of M a3 amar Yiqqawu ha- mayim. To begin with, we can now appreciate that the problem that gave his work its title and that had been troubling him for twenty years depended on the assumption that the heavenly spheres are eternal. As already noted, the query that triggered Ibn Tibbon's inquiry, namely, why the four elements did not form four concentric shells, presupposes that the world is eternal ("it follows from their [the philosophers'] statements that the question concerns only those who are committed to the eternity of the world" [p. 2:14-15]). Ibn Tibbon took the query so seriously precisely because he was committed to this premise. (In addition, we recall, Genesis confirmed that the query was well grounded in facts.) Had Ibn Tibbon believed that the world- sub- and supralunar- came into being ab novo he would have dismissed the query as irrelevant. It is only in the context of an already existing commitment to the postulate of the eternity of the supralunar world that the inquiry whose results are embedded in M a' amar Yiqqawu ha- mayim could even be initiated.90 We now gain a better appreciation of the problem Ibn Tibbon faced and solved. In Aristotelian natural philosophy, all processes depending on the heavenly bodies are necessarily cyclical. This principle, we saw, was also applied to the existence of dry land. Aristotle, Alexander, Ibn Rushd, and most other philosophers maintained that the locations of dry land and sea change cyclically, although the balance between them remains constant. In his version of Aristotle's Meteorology, for example, 92</page><page sequence="53">Gad Freudenthal Ibn Tibbon approvingly reported Alexander's argument that "the parts of the world" (including sea and dry land) "recur cyclically": for "some parts change into others through the motion of the upper eternal bodies [and vice versa]," so that "if the world as a whole does not perish, then neither will any of its parts perish, i.e., any of its species."91 In his commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon similarly wrote that the persistence of the sea and of the dry land is "everlasting" [tamid] and is due to the "eternity of the efficient causes, the most powerful of which is the motion of the sun along the ecliptic."92 But once Ibn Tibbon set upon the inquiry that triggered Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha- mayim this construction became untenable. For the cyclic view of the natural history of the globe left no room for unidirectional processes: neither for that by which the four elements tend to segregate from one another, which was now at the center of Ibn Tibbon's thinking, nor its inverse, the "gathering" of the water, due to the elements' regular transformations into another element. Ibn Tibbon was thus confronted with the problem of including two contrary unidirectional processes within a theoretical framework positing that the natural processes depend on the heavenly bodies and are therefore all cyclical Ibn Sïnâ's theory offered precisely such an account and this is why it fit the bill so well. From Ibn Tibbon's own vantage point, then, the achievement **9 PQ, §197; also in the variant text in Robinson, "Dissertation," Appendix B, Text 1, III, p. 509. Similarly cautious, Ibn Tibbon himself interpreted certain verses without committing himself to either of the two hypotheses (e.g. PQ, §166). 9^ Noted in Fraenkel, From Maimonides to Samuel Ibn Tibbon, pp. 164-65. V1 Fontaine, Otot ha-Shamayim, p. 92 [1:118-24]; also reported in Ma amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, p. 5:12-14. See the additional passage in Robinson, "Dissertation," Appendix B, No. 2, p. 512; also PQ, §178. 93</page><page sequence="54">of M a* amar Yiqqawu h α-may im was that it integrated these two unidirectional processes in a cyclical scheme: the unidirectional process leading to the separation of the elements and the inverse unidirectional process resulting in the "gathering" of the water. Ibn Sïnâ's theory thereby allowed Ibn Tibbon to view the emergence of dry land described in Genesis (where it is dubbed "creation") as a phase in an infinite series, regularly undone by inverse phases, in which the land is again submerged. Ibn Tibbon offered a scientific grounding for (and reinterpretation of) the traditional belief that the world came to be ab novo , which he succeeded in conjoining with the Aristotelian thesis of the eternity of the world sparte ante. The comparison of the commentary on Ecclesiastes with Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim allows some insight into Samuel Ibn Tibbon's intellectual development. As Ravitzky has argued, Ibn Tibbon's interest in Aristotle's Meteorology was doubtless motivated by the engagement with Maimonides' naturalistic account of creation. At some point Ibn Tibbon must have realized that he differed from "the true sage" on a cardinal point: the latter's account of creation bore on both the supra- and sublunar realms, whereas Ibn Tibbon believed the heavenly spheres to be eternal and took the account in Genesis to apply to sublunar reality only. He concluded that it was necessary to revise Maimonides' account, an attitude that was in tune with his strong belief that human knowledge constantly progresses.93 However, his research program soon bogged down, for, given the premise that the heavenly bodies are eternal, Aristotelian natural philosophy implied that the surface of the globe should be covered with water- a stance confirmed by Genesis- but did not account for the emergence of dry land. Ibn Tibbon reports that he remained perplexed for no less than twenty years, until he finally discovered the solution in the section on the Meteorology of Ibn Sïnâ's 94</page><page sequence="55">Gad Freudenthal Shifãc. This work also allowed him to construe the coming-to-be of man naturalistically: when he wrote the commentary on Ecclesiastes Ibn Tibbon still believed with Ibn Rushd that, unlike plants and animals, human beings cannot be generated without a sire;94 in Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim^ following Ibn Sïna, he allowed for "spontaneous generation" of all living species, humankind included. The commentary on Ecclesiastes nowhere reveals signs of the "perplexity" that was to trigger Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim?5 Given that that perplexity lasted for twenty years and was resolved only with the composition of Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim in 1231 (see Appendix I), this observation suggests that the commentary on Ecclesiastes was composed nearer to 1213 (the terminus post quern) than to 1221 (the terminus ante quern).96 V. The Reception and Transmission of M a' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim Let us finally consider the aftermath of Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim. Quite surprisingly, the daring views Ibn Tibbon expressed in that work seem to have escaped attention. True, an occasional historian cursorily remarked that Ibn Tibbon affirmed "the eternity of the 93 See above, n. 88. 94 PQ, §§314, 402; see also §§280, 400-401, 472, 733. 95 One would have expected it especially in PQ, §196, and also in §§88, 154, 182, 184, 187. Similarly, in Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim (pp. 6:30-7:3), Ibn Tibbon connects Eccles. 3:15 ("what is occurring occurred long since, and what is to occur occurred long since") with the preservation of dry land by the heavenly bodies. In PQ (§§388-90) he also takes the verse to bear on providence, but makes no allusion to the problem of the existence of dry land, which thus seems not to have occupied him yet. See above, n. 56. 95</page><page sequence="56">world thesis," but this statement is more misleading than informative. In writings on medieval philosophy, the phrase "the thesis of the eternity of the world" as a rule denotes the original Aristotelian version of this doctrine: not only the separate, immaterial substances and the celestial bodies are eternal; so too are all animal and vegetable species, each defined by its specific form, transmitted via the sire's seed. (The notion that the specific form of a living being is eternal inasmuch as it is transmitted from sire to offspring is Aristotle's naturalistic substitute for the Platonic Forms.97) The sea and the dry land on the surface of the terrestrial globe are also construed as "species" and taken to be eternal, even if they constantly change their respective places. According to the Aristotelian notion of the eternity of the world thesis as it was understood by Ibn Tibbon and his contemporaries: The condition of each distinct part of the world is the same as that of the world as a whole. That is to say, if the world as a whole does not perish, then neither will any of its parts, viz. any of the species it comprises, which are its parts. So, the theory of Democritus, who said that the sea will come to an end, is false.98 Ibn Tibbon's views, we have seen, are far removed from the eternity of the world thesis in this standard, Aristotelian sense. Consider the flawed take on Ibn Tibbon's work by one of its earliest readers, the kabbalist Jacob Ben Sheshet (mid-thirteenth century), whose Sefer Mesiv devarim nekohim (Rebuke with Accurate Statements) is to a great extent directed against Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim. The two scholars represent opposing attitudes toward Scripture and hermeneutics. Ibn Tibbon, a faithful follower of the Maimonidean hermeneutic tradition, holds that where philosophical considerations make it necessary one must forsake the literal meaning 96</page><page sequence="57">Gad Freudenthal of words: "It is preferable to strain the words [lidhoq ba-lason] rather than reality [mesi'ut]," he says (p. 17:14). Reacting directly to this statement and playing on its language, Ben Sheshet writes: "It is better for us, and appropriate for any wise person, to reject reality [lidhot ha-mesi'ut] that is not in accord with the Tradition accepted by all of Israel and with the true belief, rather than reject the literal interpretation [lidhot pesat ha-millah] which is accepted and known to all of Israel."99 Ben Sheshet was largely ignorant of science, so his refutation of Ibn Tibbon's views skirts all discussion of scientific matters and he fails to come to grips with Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha- mayim systematically and methodically. For the most part, Ben Sheshet presents his own theology, contrasting it en passant with Ibn Tibbon's.100 It is therefore not entirely clear how he understood Ibn Tibbon. He certainly noticed that Ibn Tibbon took the "world" to be eternal, but he does not make clear how he understands this claim. His most explicit statement seems to be the following: "In my opinion, according to what is obvious from many of the statements in his book [Ma'amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim], he meant that the earth is eternal and that the spheres and the planets are eternal, and that the earth did not give rise to vegetation by virtue of a [divine] purposeful command, but rather by virtue of potentialities."101 More than once, Ben Sheshet bluntly and crisply says of Ibn Tibbon that he "stated that the world is eternal (ha-'olam qadmon),"102 but without more precise definitions.

He observes that, as Ibn Tibbon himself remarked (p. 2:15-17), the traditional interpretation of Genesis presupposes that dry land emerged after God had changed the nature of water. For various reasons Ben Sheshet thinks that this is an untenable position; consequently he charges that Ibn Tibbon's purpose in raising the question of how the water "gathered" was to discredit the traditional view.104 It is noteworthy that Ben Sheshet complains that passages with the exegesis of certain verses were deliberately omitted from the copy of Ma3 amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim at his disposal and that Ibn Tibbon's followers kept them secret: apparently, they felt threatened by the attacks its audacious views could trigger.105 In sum, then, it seems that Jacob Ben Sheshet realized that Ibn Tibbon believed the world to be eternal in some sense, but failed to understand his theory fully. Modern scholars, too, seem to have missed the thrust of Ibn Tibbon's radical views. The astonishing silence about Ibn Tibbon's views is even more surprising and difficult to understand if we juxtapose them to the reception of the enigmatically stated cosmogony of Abraham Ibn Ezra, which has been widely and intensively debated over the centuries.106 Several authors have suggested that Ibn Ezra's cosmogony is identical to Ibn Sïna's, on whom Ibn Tibbon explicitly draws. Moreover, Ibn Tibbon remarks that his own understanding of raqiac and samayim is identical with Ibn Ezra's.107 One would therefore have expected that the discussion of Ibn Ezra's cosmogony and of its relationship to Ibn Sïna would lead to the question whether Ibn Tibbon was indebted to Ibn Ezra. The study of this issue should in turn have directed interest to Yiqqawu ha-mayim^ but this has not been the case; Ibn Tibbon's name is conspicuously absent from all these discussions.108 There are in fact obvious parallels between Abraham Ibn Ezra's statements and 98</page><page sequence="59">Gad Freudenthal Ibn Tibbon's views: they understand the distinction between raqiac and samayim similarly and agree that the account of creation as given in Genesis describes the coming-to-be of the sublunar world only. These parallels may be because both authors drew on Ibn Sïnâ and/or because Ibn Tibbon was inspired by Ibn Ezra; the question requires further study.109 103 Ibid., p. 134 (chap. 11:70-72): "As is obvious from his [Samuel Ibn Tibbon's] statements, one has to understand that [Ibn Sïnâ's] opinion and his own opinion are the same as the opinion of those who [affirm] that the earth has not come to be ab novo [i.e., that it is eternal], while the other created things on it have come to be ab novo, flood after flood, again and again." 104 Ibid., pp. 132-35 (chap. 11, passim). Ibid., p. 134 (chap. 11:74-76). Fraenkel has recently discovered a passage in Ma'amar YiqqawH ha-mayim that is omitted in many manuscripts. In it, Ibn Tibbon castigates scholars who uphold anthropomorphism.

Conclusion Samuel Ibn Tibbon set out to find the answer to the question: "What do the philosophers say about [the fact that] the elementary water does not encompass the earth entirely and does not cover its surface entirely?" (p. 2:3-4). His research led him to Ibn Sïnâ's bold theory that the surface of the terrestrial globe eternally oscillates between a state in which it is covered with water and a state in which a quarter of its surface is dry land (p. 7:11-12), populated with vegetable and animal species. Ibn Tibbon is remarkable not only in that he unabashedly accepts Ibn Sïnâ's heterodox theory, but also in that he grounds it in Scripture, showing in great exegetical detail that authoritative Jewish texts allude to it. Ibn Tibbon thus introduced to Judaism a theory of eternal return. Cyclical theories of time and history have not been uncommon in the history of human thought and some found their way into medieval Jewish philosophy.110 One crucial aspect distinguishes Ibn Tibbon's view from all other cyclical theories of time advanced by Jewish thinkers: in these theories, the cyclic character of time depended on cosmological factors, notably on some cyclic astronomical phenomenon; in Ibn Tibbon's theory, by contrast, the cyclic character followed from processes that are inherent in the physics of the world of generation and corruption itself. Put differently: following Ibn Sïnâ, Ibn Tibbon describes the cyclic history of the sublunar world as resulting from forces immanent to it, whereas in other theories the cyclic return within the sublunar world is produced by causes exterior to it. By the same token, Ibn Tibbon's implicit admission of an infinite succession of "worlds" (where "world" refers to the sublunar world) is fundamentally unlike other ideas about an infinity of "worlds," notably Hasdai Cresças' "theories of synchronie and diachronic plurality of worlds [which] portray a spatiotemporally infinite universe in which infinite numbers of words are continually passing into and out of existence."111 Samuel Ibn Tibbon construed the material world as consisting of 100</page><page sequence="61">Gad Freudenthal unchanging eternal heavenly spheres encompassing a sublunar world whose configuration constantly alternates between a state in which the globe is entirely flooded and one in which part of its surface is dry land. To those who live in this sublunar world, the process by which dry land emerges and gradually grows vegetable and animal species is "creation." Epistemologically, this is the same situation in which Jim Carrey found himself in the movie The Truman Show (directed by Peter Weir, 1998). We must appreciate Ibn Tibbon for his audacious mind that allowed him to look beyond the limits of his physical universe. See the overview in Shalom Rosenberg, "The Return to the Garden of Eden: Notes on the History of the Idea of Restorative Redemption in Medieval Jewish Philosophy," in The Messianic Idea in Jewish Thought.

The only attempt to identify the volcano in question was made by Adolf Neubauer (1831-1907) in 1872. His main purpose was to date M a* amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, which alludes to the volcanic event as having occurred ten (variant reading: twenty) years earlier. In what follows, I offer a new and, I believe, definitive identification of the volcanic eruption in question. Ibn Tibbon writes (p. 160:28-161:1): I saw fit to write something down here that has come to pass in our own time, ten [variant reading: twenty] years from today, in the [or a] sea not far from an island of the isles of England. At a certain spot, much smoky exhalation was seen to rise out of this spot during the day. At night, that smoke was seen as a flame of fire. After this continued for some time, a mountain that was not there previously came to be there. After this, the smoke that was visible at that spot ceased. It was said that no plants grew on that mountain, except at such places where droppings fell from one of the birds that fly over that mountain or who dwell and rest on it. This is what informants who are among the trustworthy seekers of truth have reported. In his erudite short note, Adolf Neubauer tried to identify the geological event to which Ibn Tibbon alludes. He perceptively observed that "no one has ever heard about any volcanic eruption in England. Samuel is 103</page><page sequence="64">thinking here of Iceland, which in distant regions was believed to be close to England."112 Drawing on Scriptores rerum danicarum medii devi, edited by Jacob Langebek113 (1710-1775), he identified three volcanic eruptions in Iceland in the relevant period: 1206,114 1211, and 1232. Excluding the first as too early and the last as too late ( Ibn Tibbon was already dead by 1232), he concluded that the eruption of 1211 best fits the data.115 In Les Rabbins français du commencement du quatorzième siede, published by E. Renan in 1877, Neubauer takes into account a fourth eruption (1222) and writes that "l'éruption volcanique ... ne pourrait être que celle qui eut lieu près de Rejkjanes, arrivée en 1211, ou celle du mont Hécla, arrivée en 1222," to which Renan added: "Cette dernière hypothèse [de 1222] nous paraît la plus probable."116 We will see that Renan was wrong and Neubauer right. In fact, we have information about no fewer than nine volcanic eruptions in Iceland in the three first decades of the thirteenth century (see Table 1). Their locations are as follows: Table 1 Volcanic Eruptions in or Offshore Iceland, 1201-1235" Number Date Name of volcano Summit elevation 1 Dec. 4, 1205 Hekla 1491 2 1210±10 Bárdarbunga ca. 2000 m. 3 Aug. 31, 1211 Reykjaneshryggur 80 m. 4 1211 Reykjanes 230 m. 5 1222 Hekla 1491 6 1223 Reykjaneshryggur 80 m 7 1226117 Reykjanes 230 m. 8 1230±10 Grimsvötn 1725 m. 9 1231 Reykjaneshryggur 80 m. * Source: "Global Volcanism Program" of the Smithsonian Institution (viewed at http://www.volcano.si.edu/ on Dec. 8, 2006). 104</page><page sequence="65">Gad Freudenthal • Hekla: One of Iceland's most prominent and active volcanoes, Hekla lies near the southern end of the eastern rift zone. • Bárdarbunga. The large central volcano of Bárdarbunga lies beneath the northwestern part of the Vatnajökull icecap, northwest of the Grimsvötn volcano. It has a subglacial 700-m- deep caldera. • Reykjaneshryggur, or the Reykjanes Ridge. The submarine Reykjanes Ridge extends from the extreme southwestern point of Iceland (the Reykjanes Peninsula; see next entry). Numerous submarine eruptions at Reykjaneshryggur, some of which have formed islands, have been observed in historical time, going back to the twelfth century. The submarine eruptions in the Reykjanes Ridge in the early thirteenth century will be discussed below. • Reykjanes. The Reykjanes volcanic system, at the southwestern tip of the Reykjanes Peninsula, where the Mid- Atlantic Ridge rises above the sea, comprises a broad area of postglacial basaltic crater rows and small shield volcanoes. • Grimsvötn. This, Iceland's most frequently active volcano in historical time, lies beneath the vast Vatnajökull icecap. The caldera Α.

Because any eruption that occurred above the sea does not fit Ibn Tibbon's description, which specifically states that it took place under sea and produced an island, Hekla, Bárdarbunga, Grimsvötn, and Reykjanes are excluded. By contrast, the Reykjanes Ridge (Reykjaneshryggur), whose eruptions are submarine and produce islands, fits the description perfectly. This narrows the possibilities to Nos. 3, 6, and 9 in the table. The fairly abundant information concerning the 1211 eruption in Reykjanes Ridge confirms that this is the eruption to which Ibn Tibbon refers.118 The historical records about this eruption were collected by Sigurdur Thorarinsson (1912-1983) in an article published in 1965.119 He mentions the account already noted by Neubauer,120 contained in the Icelandic Royal Annals, which report for the 1211 eruption that "fire erupted out of the sea" and that "Sorli Konradsson found [i.e. discovered] Eldeyjar [= Fire Islands]";121 much the same account is given in the Skalholtsannall (The annals of Skalholt) and in other accounts, which in addition mention new isles that formed, while others disappeared. Thorarinsson concludes that, taken together, the records imply that in 1211, probably late in the year, there was a volcanic eruption off the Reykjanes peninsula, associated with multiple earthquakes, and that some islands sank into the sea while others formed. The newly formed islands were named Eldeyjar (Fire Islands), indicating their volcanic origin. (This "new Eldey" may be the island now known by that name.122) Thorarinsson goes on to quote from the Breve chronicon Norvegiae}2^ written in 1230: "In our time it came to pass that the sea boiled in a three-mile area like a pot, the earth opened up and threw from the depths igneous vapors and a big mountain rose from the bottom=of the sea."124 Precisely because it was written nearly twenty years after the event, 106</page><page sequence="67">Gad Freudenthal the Breve chronicon account, which strikingly parallels Ibn Tibbon's, is particularly significant for us. It indicates that the 1211 eruption made a very strong impression on contemporary minds and that information about it was still "in the news" in the 1230s, when (as will immediately be seen) M a' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim was written. This consideration, together with the fact that the 1211 eruption is the only one that, to our knowledge, produced new islands, seems to me to establish that this is the eruption to which Ibn Tibbon refers. Although we also have information about an eruption in the Reykjanes Ridge in 1223, our discussion has shown that only that of 1211 became an object of historical record. (The eruption of 1231 is in any event too late to be considered.) We thus end up with the same dating of the eruption as that proposed by Neubauer more than 130 years ago, based, however, on more extensive data. What this implies with respect to the dating of Yiqqawu ha-mayim is another question. As quoted above, in the printed text the eruption The following discussion greatly benefited from information and advice generously provided by Prof. Siguròur Stein{&gt;órsson of the University of Iceland, partly drawn from his forthcoming Catalogue of the Volcanoes of Iceland.

But the entire passage is quoted verbatim by Gershom Ben Solomon in his Saar ha-samayim, but with "twenty years" instead.125 Gershom himself wrote a few decades later, so this is not an intentional emendation going back to him. Scholars have therefore rightly concluded that we have two versions of the passage,126 one implying that Yiqqawu ha-mayim was written in 1221, the other, in 1231. As we shall see now, there are good reasons to suppose that the correct date of completion of the work is in fact 1231. Samuel Ibn Tibbon presents Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim as written in response to a query by "one of the erudite friends who seek to find valuable knowledge [lit. statements]" (p. 2:2-3). Although alluding to a request by a friend was a common medieval topos, here Ibn Tibbon's statement seems to correspond to reality. More than once in the course of Ma3amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim its author addresses the recipient of the book directly.127 We may recall, too, that his translation of the Meteorology was composed in response to a request by a friend, identified as R. Joseph b. Israel.128 In both cases, the introductory phrases suggest that Ibn Tibbon was in contact with a group of "erudite friends" with whom he discussed- and whom he taught- science. This surmise is confirmed by repeated references in his commentary on Ecclesiastes to fellow-students. He mentions "one of my lovers, who are erudite and seek valuable knowledge," "one of my brothers," "one of my friends" and at one point wonders whether his friends would accept a new interpretation of a verse.129 A similar suggestion has been made by Y. Tzvi Langermann.130 Carlos Fraenkel has convincingly argued that Ibn Tibbon taught Maimonides' Guide to groups of students and that this activity may have been the point of departure for at least some of his annotations to his translation of the Guide.131 That Ibn Tibbon was involved with a study circle seems all the more plausible given that his father had done precisely the same thing.132 Now the query that triggered M a3 amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim could have 108</page><page sequence="69">Gad Freudenthal 1 *yt' Gershom b.

It is discussed in Renan [and Neubauer], Les Rabbins français, pp. 589-90. According to J. T.

The manuscripts of Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, which present numerous variants from the printed text, will have to be checked. But whatever the result, we will always end up with two versions of this passage. 1 77 "Your question concerning how the water gathers, which caused the composition of this treatise"; p. 121:15-16.

M a amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim contains yet another relative dating that has been overlooked by scholars. When he introduces the difficulty of coming up with a solution to the problem of how the water "gathers," Ibn Tibbon says that he had devoted no less than twenty years to this inquiry: "It is now twenty years that I am rowing hard in the deep waters of this investigation,136 seeking to attain the dry land of understanding," he writes, with obvious intertextual references to the subject of his inquiry (p. 5:20-21). This item of information is valuable: for if, as I suggest, the beginning of this inquiry goes back to 1210 or shortly thereafter, then Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim (or at least the parts of it containing the solution to the problem) must have been written in 1230 or shortly thereafter. If we add this consideration to the reference to the volcanic eruption, then 1231 emerges as the date of completion of Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim. This conclusion is endorsed by C. Fraenkel's recent discovery of a passage in Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha- mayim, preserved in several manuscripts, whose historical context seems to be the Maimonidean controversy of the early 1230s.137 110</page><page sequence="71">Gad Freudenthal It is quite possible and even likely, however, that Ma amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim was written over a long period of time. Several indications, not the least of which is the disorderly arrangement of the book, point to this direction (see also supra, n. 66). If so, the above argument establishes only that the book's last part, including notably the phrase "it is now twenty years that I am rowing hard in the deep waters of this investigation," was written around 1231, shortly before Ibn Tibbon died (perhaps before he had time to give his work a final polishing). Moreover, we know that Ibn Tibbon used to revise his works constantly: there are no fewer than five versions of the preface to the commentary on Ecclesiastes, as Robinson has noticed, and for several other passages a single manuscript preserves multiple redactions.138 This may offer a clue to the consistent difference in the references to the time of the be-Lunel ba-me'ah ha-y"b.

On this hypothesis, Sacar ha-samayim was copied from a manuscript of the last version, whereas all or most surviving manuscripts of Ma' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim go back to the earlier version. A comprehensive study of the manuscript tradition of Ma* amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim may shed further light on this question. In his "Letter No. 20," published in 1854, Senior (Schneor) Sachs (1815-1892), the last editor of Kerem Chemed, wrote that Ibn Tibbon composed Ma* amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim in his old age; he added that he intended to establish this in another paper.139 Although no such paper seems to have been published, scholars have referred to Sachs' remark as establishing the fact.140 I hope that the above discussion will come in place of Sachs5 unwritten article. 139 Sachs, "Letter No. 20," p. 157.

Specifically, I argue that his version of this theory represents a modification of its "standard version" and goes back to Ibn Sïnâ. I further propose that it was probably introduced in order to buttress the Avicennian account of the formation of dry land from a surface entirely submerged below water. Ibn Tibbon describes his theory of the elements more or less en passant in the second chapter of Ma3 amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim. He mentions that Maimonides recapitulated the four-element theory in the Guide (1:72) and goes on to state it himself quite briefly. The theory has two components. I. Ibn Tibbon's formulation of the first part of the theory, although relatively standard, has a particular twist: [The four elements] are inanimate. Their nature is such that when they are at their [respective] natural places, they neither move within them, nor move away from them to other place[s]. Rather, a nature has been impressed into them, such that if a compeller (makriah) forces one of them out of its [natural] place, then, once this compeller has been removed, it moves back to its own place in a rectilinear motion. This means that if a compeller acts on [an element] that is above [another] and forces it to [a place] below its natural place, then, once that compeller is removed, it [this element] moves upward, returning to its natural place: [it then moves] from the direction of the compeller in the direction of the heavenly spheres. Similarly, if a 113</page><page sequence="74">compeller acts on [an element] that is below [another] and raises it from its natural place to the place of the other element, which is above it, then its nature is such that, when that compeller is removed, it moves back downward, returning to its natural place: [it then moves] in a rectilinear motion from the direction of the spheres toward the globe of the earth; or, if you prefer, from the encompassing [body] in the direction of the imaginary point which is at the center of the globe of the earth, which is called the center of the world, (p. 3:15-24) Although this summary is fairly standard, it stresses a particular aspect: rather than construing the motions of the elements as absolute motions toward or away from the center, Ibn Tibbon puts the emphasis on the motions of the elements relative to one another. He does not draw on the notion of an absolute "heavy" or "light" and refers instead to the relative positions of the elements (above/below another element).141 This brings to mind the analogous though more elaborate elemental theory developed by Gersonides, which also accounted for natural rectilinear motions not in terms of absolute heavy and light, but rather by assuming that the elements displace one another according to their respective "relative weights" (to use a convenient but anachronistic term).142 It would seem that what mattered to Ibn Tibbon was not the natural motion itself, but rather its outcome; namely, that a portion of an element moves upward if a "heavier" element is above it, and downward if a "lighter" element is below it. We will return to this later. II. Ibn Tibbon next states a second principle of his elemental theory, which bears on the mutual transformations of the elements into one another. He writes: They [the philosophers] are also of the opinion that it is in the nature of the elements to transform into one another. However [and with this "however" Ibn Tibbon seems to 114</page><page sequence="75">Gad Freudenthal signal that he is now introducing a less consensual, dissenting view], the transformation of air into water is easy, for they share one quality, namely moistness: the heat in air is feeble, [whereas] the cold in water is strong, so it [the water] can easily transform it [the air] into itself. The same holds for the transformation of water into earth. But the transformation of fire into water, or that of water into fire, or that of earth into air, or vice versa, is difficult, because they are opposed in two qualities. Intermediate between them [i.e., of intermediate difficulty] is the transformation of water into air, or of earth into water, because the cold in the water is strong and the heat in the air is feeble. Similarly, the dryness of earth is strong, and the moistness of water is feeble. In short, each [element] is transformed into the other, i.e., it discards its own form and takes on the other [element's] form. (pp. 3:24-5:1) The idea that "it is in the nature of the elements to transform into one another" is obviously a commonplace (see GC 2.4), but the version presented here deviates from the standard formulation. Ibn Tibbon states that certain transformations are "difficult" (in fact, next to impossible), others "easy," and yet others "intermediary." Aristotle had stated that some transformations are more likely to occur and hence speedier than others; but in his version of this idea, the "ease" or "difficulty" of the transformations between two elements depends only on whether or See, by contrast, Ibn Tibbon's version of Aristotle's Meteorology: "The heavy bodies among [the four elements] move from the Up to the center, and the light bodies among them move from the center toward the Up" (Fontaine, O tot ha-Shamayim, p. 10 [1:86-87]). Ruth Glasner, "Gersonides* Theory of Natural Motion," Early Science and Medicine 1 (1996): pp. 151-203. 115</page><page sequence="76">not they share a common quality: the members of the four pairs of elements sharing a common quality (fire/air, air/water, water/earth, and earth/fire) are easily transformed into each another, whereas elements differing by two qualities (fire/water and earth/air) transform into each other slowly (GC 2.4 331a22-331bll; 2.5, 332a32-33). This implies that the mutual transformations of two given elements are equivalent, an idea presupposed in Aristotle's conclusion that the transformations between the elements are "cyclical" (ibid.).143 The theory presented by Ibn Tibbon, by contrast, infers the transformability of the elements from the relative strengths of their qualities: "The transformation of the air into water is easy, for they share one quality, namely moistness: the heat in air is feeble, [whereas] the cold in water is strong, so [the cold in water] can easily transform [the heat in air] into itself [i.e., cold]. The same holds for the transformation of water into earth." The corollary is that the transformations into each another of the members of a given pair of elements are not equivalent: for example, air is more easily transformed into water, and water into earth, than vice versa. The following diagram (see next page) summarizes this theory. In this diagram, each of the element pairs air-water and water- earth has a common quality (moistness and coldness, respectively); hence the elements are constantly transformed into one another. But the transformations are unequal: the coldness of water is strong, whereas the heat of air is feeble. Hence the water's coldness tends to overpower the air's heat, so that air is transformed into water more readily than water into air. Similarly, the dryness of earth is strong, whereas the moistness of water is weak: hence the earth's dryness tends to overpower the water's moistness, so that water is transformed into earth more readily than earth into water. The elements that have two opposed qualities (air-earth and fire-water) never transform into one another. The other two possible transformations (between fire and earth, and between fire and air) are not considered because they are not pertinent to the argument. 116</page><page sequence="77">Gad Freudenthal AIRI* FIRe£ 4 WATERS« EARTHS» Figure 1: The mutual but unbalanced transformations of the four elements, according to Samuel Ibn Tibbon Legend: mh^^ strong transformation &gt; weak transformation (-) and (+): weak/strong quality Two questions have to be raised now: First, was this unconventional elemental theory original with Ibn Tibbon, or did he borrow it ready-made from somewhere else? Second, what was his purpose in introducing this non-standard account? This view in its standard form is restated by Alexander of Aphrodisias. See On Anstotle ys "On Coming-to-Be and Perishing 2.2.5," trans. Emma Gannagé (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2005), pp. 106-107. See also Gannagé's discussion, ibid., pp. 64-69. 117</page><page sequence="78">The answer to the first question is straightforward: the quoted passage (pp. 3:24-5:1) derives almost verbatim from the section of the ShifcL on the Generation and Corruption}^ Ibn Tibbon did not craft a totally new account of elements in line with his theoretical preoccupations, but drew on a theory he found in the writings of the theoretician whose ideas he followed on other matters too. We should now ask whether and how this non-standard version of the four-element theory ties in with Ibn Tibbon's global project. What was its theoretical import for his purposes? I suggest the following reconstruction. To begin with, an important implication of this version of elementary theory is that water and earth transform into each other at their surfaces of contact. This is the case when the sublunar world consists of four concentric elemental shells and even more so when it does not. Consequently, and this is the noteworthy point, the sublunar world can never reach the stable state of four concentric elemental shells. For just as the rectilinear natural motions of the elements constitute a built-in causality that moves the sublunar world toward a neat stratification of the elements, there is also a built-in inverse inherent causality pushing in the opposite direction. The passage just quoted continues, And when in this way [i.e. through the mutual transformations of the elements] one of them comes to be not in its [natural] place, it will immediately begin to move in a rectilinear motion toward its natural place. The explanation of this is as follows: When water or earth come to be in the [natural] place of air and fire, they immediately descend in a straight line to the earth, which is their natural place. Similarly, when airy or fiery things come to be in the earth or in water, they immediately rise to the [natural] place of air and fire, each to its natural place. This is observable in the case of the two kinds of exhalations, the moist and the dry. (p. 5:l-6)145 118</page><page sequence="79">Gad Freudenthal While this passage might seem to ground the classic idea that nature moves toward a state in which the elements are stratified, this is not what Ibn Tibbon makes of it. Rather, what matters to him is something different: Because it is in the nature of the elements to continually transform into one another, the earth cannot remain in the state which is its natural state [i.e., a perfect globe, encompassed by a shell of water]. For it is in the nature of the earth that parts of it are transformed into water (or one of the other elements) and the other elements are transformed into earth. Now, when any [part] of the earth is transformed into another element it is subtracted from the body of the earth. Hence, there will necessarily be an indentation and a cavity in its sphericity, for the earth is dry and does not "gather" so as to recover its natural shape. ... Similarly, whatever of the other elements is transformed into the nature of the earth will settle on it and This discovery is due to Ahmed Hasnaoui (CNRS, Paris), who kindly checked the Kitab al-Shifã' for me. The reference he provided is: Ibn Sínã, Al-Shifã': Al-TabViyyãt 3: Al-Kawn wa-1-fasãd, chap. 14, ed. Mahmud Qassem (Cairo, 1969), pp. 189:12-190:9. Hasnaoui notes that at p. 190:2 this edition has a lacuna due to a homoioteleuton: the correct text is as in the lithographic edition of Teheran (p. 223:28-29): fa-innaal- hawã3 yushariku al-mâ3 fi kayfiyyat al-ruttuba wa yukhãlifuhu fi kayfiyyat al-harãra. I am deeply indebted to Ahmed Hasnaoui for his characteristically kind and erudite advice. The fact that Ibn Tibbon was acquainted with the section of the Shifã' on the Generation and Corruption invites a systematic comparison between his works and Ibn Sina's. Specifically, the references to Ibn Sïna in Otot ha-Shamayim may refer to parts of the Shifac other than the section on the Meteorology (see n. 20). This passage is quoted in part in Gershom ben Shlomo, Sba'ar ha-sbamayyim 1:1 (Warsaw, 1876), 5b-6a. 119</page><page sequence="80">become without doubt an increment and a height superadded to it, for it will not spread over it as water that is poured on other water does, so as to become a single spherical body. (p. 7:16-25) Thus the fact that elements are continually transformed into one another makes it impossible for the globe of the earth to remain a perfect sphere: earth, being contiguous to water, is continually transformed into it and thence into air, and so it rises "in accordance with its new nature," leaving a cavity behind; conversely, when earth is generated from water it settles on stretches of land and increases their height (p. 146:11-14). The consequence is that the idea from which the entire inquiry began, namely that according to the premises of Aristotelian natural philosophy the sublunar world will end up in a state in which the globe of the earth is encompassed by shells of the other three elements, is invalid, inasmuch as it takes into consideration the elements' natural motions alone. But if one considers "the order of the total reality {seder ha-kol)" i.e., if one also takes into account the fact that the elements constantly transform into one another, then one understands why reality {or existence [mesi'ut]) is necessarily different, i.e., why the world is not made up of four concentric globes (p. 7:14-16). Consequently, although (from metaphysical considerations) the earth's most perfect state, in which it should persist, is that of a sphere (p. 147:17-20; see above, p. 000), it cannot remain in this state. Thus the fact that in the "created" world the water is "gathered" is a natural necessity. But there apparently is more to it. Most relevant in the context of the issues discussed by Ibn Tibbon are the reciprocal transformations between water and earth. We noted that water is easily transformed into earth, whereas the inverse transformation is more difficult. This means that more water will be transformed into earth than earth into water. This corollary fits extremely well into Ibn Tibbon's theoretical project. His primary intention was to give a naturalistic account of how "the 120</page><page sequence="81">Gad Freudenthal water gathers," i.e., of how dry land emerges from a flooded globe. The position that more water is converted into earth than earth into water supplies a simple answer to this question, independently of the other parts of the theory (earth settling on top of other earth; formation of cavities; the action of the stars). In his discussion of the formation of an island by a volcano, Ibn Tibbon lays particular emphasis on this cause: he states that the mountain came to be out of especially "salty, bitter and thick" water that, being "close to the nature of the earth," was very easily transformed into earth, producing a mountain (p. 161:23-24; see above, p. 54). It thus seems likely that Ibn Tibbon's intention in embracing Ibn Sïnâ's version of the theory of elements was to construe the transformations of the elements into one another as unbaUnced^ with the transformation of water into earth, in particular, not entirely offset by the inverse transformation. Thus, whereas the very existence of these transformations between the elements explains why the sublunar world does not remain in the stable state in which the elements are arranged in concentric shells, the fact that they are unbalanced implies that there is an inherent tendency in nature to form dry land out of water. To be sure, dry land does not persist: once it is formed, contrary processes, such as erosion, set in, and lead to the flooding of land, thereby preventing the surface of the globe from becoming entirely dry land. Ibn Tibbon thus seems to have embraced the specific Avicennian version of elemental theory advisedly: it offered a solid theoretical grounding to the natural history of the world as he viewed it. Was this application of the theory of the elements Ibn Tibbon's innovation, or does it also derive from Ibn Sïna, who may already have drawn on his theory of the elements to ground his account of an eternal world? This question requires further research. The sublunar world as construed by Samuel Ibn Tibbon is thus a system that, by virtue of natural necessities alone, oscillates between two extreme points without ever attaining a stable state. The process 121</page><page sequence="82">begins, say, from the state described in Genesis, in which the entire globe of earth is submerged under water. The transformation of water into earth produces mountains and that of earth into water produces cavities; both cause the water to "gather." Then inverse processes set in- erosion and the rectilinear motions of the elements toward their natural places- so that ultimately the globe is again entirely covered with water, at which point the process described in Genesis begins all over again. Thus Ibn Tibbon grounds his theory of the cyclic evolution of the sublunar world in his theory of the elements. A crucial premise of this theoretical construction is that the four elements exist in roughly equal quantities, so that none can definitively overpower the others. Ibn Tibbon states this explicitly, in fact (p. 5:17-19), although he does not say why it is important (needless to say, he cannot make this statement precise).146 146 See Aristotle, GC, 2.6. 122</page><page sequence="83">Gad Freudenthal Appendix C Samuel Ibn Tibbon on the Knowability of God from the Motion of the Heaven The question whether or not Maimonides thought that God's existence can be known from the motion of the heaven has been intensively and hotly debated among scholars in recent years.147 At the center of the controversy is the correct understanding of a single sentence of (the Arabic text of) the Guide of the Perplexed (2:24). Here we need not consider the sentence itself, but rather how Samuel Ibn Tibbon treated it in the Hebrew translation of the Guide. Ibn Tibbon did not content himself with merely translating the Arabic text as he had it (which is the same we have today). From a gloss he penned in the margin of his translation (preserved as such in several manuscripts) we know that he believed the Arabic text at his disposal to be corrupt: as he read it, the sentence stated that the motion of the heaven does not allow man to know God. But based on his overall understanding of Maimonides' thought, Ibn Tibbon believed this to be precisely the opposite of what the Master thought and wished to convey. Ibn Tibbon decided that to make his translation truthfully reflect Maimonides' thinking he should interpolate three words, making the Hebrew version of the sentence say that God can be known from the motion of the sphere. As a responsible scholar, he did not silently incorporate his emendation into the translation, but placed his conjecture in a marginal gloss, explicitly identified by himself as such. The gloss was eventually integrated into some manuscripts of the Guide and into the printed editions.148 This issue of Aleph (8 [2008]) includes a forum discussing this question. For details see "Editor's Introduction," pp. 151-157 below. 123</page><page sequence="84">Ibn Tibbon's understanding of the text is of some importance: he was, after all, one of the earliest and most committed Maimonidean scholars and his conjecture shaped the understanding of Maimonides for centuries. What Ibn Tibbon himself thought about whether God is knowable from the motion of the heaven may have influenced his understanding of Maimonides. Hence it seems apposite to inquire into his own view of the issue. We will look at his commentary on Ecclesiastes and M a3 amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim and find that he expresses the same position in both. In the commentary on Ecclesiastes Ibn Tibbon writes apropos of "God is in heaven and you are on earth" (Eccles. 5:1): It is difficult [lit. remote] to find a demonstration (mofet)149 concerning the upper things and the divine matters.150 The difficulty arises from what he [Qohelet] said: "God is in heaven and you are on earth." This does not [mean] that God is a body whose place is in the heaven.151 It rather means that (1) the existence {mesi ut) of God and (2) His governance of the world are apprehended [or can be apprehended (tusag)] by man through the motions of the heaven and its powers. (1) In fact, His existence is [or can be] apprehended (tusag)] through the heaven's regular (tedirah) motion, and from the fact that it persists ceaselessly (we-hatmidah beli hefseq). The heaven cannot possibly have this [ceaseless motion] owing to its essence [or on its own], for it is a body. Therefore, the cause of the perpetuality [or continuity (temidut)] of its motion must be something that is not a body nor a power within a body, but rather a separate intelligence only. And when man [i.e., his apprehension] grasps it, he has grasped the existence (mesi ut) of God without any doubt, since no doubt pertains to the perpetuality (temidut) of the motion. For if the [moving] separate intelligence is one only, then it is the deity; and if they 124</page><page sequence="85">Gad Freudenthal [the moving intelligence] are many, then, since their plurality is possible only by way of cause and effect (for they are not bodies), the deity is the First Cause of them all. By this way, man has obtained an indubitable proof [mofet] of the existence of God, be He exalted. (2) However, the knowledge of God's governance of the created existents and His knowledge of what he governs- these are things that man cannot apprehend thoroughly and whose truth is unattainable by him. For the heaven is an intermediary (3emsaciyyim) between God and the multitude of lower created beings. And man can attain only a little of the knowledge of the powers152 of the celestial hosts, i.e., of the heavenly bodies [kokavim, which includes both the fixed stars and the planets]. Therefore, the knowledge of these things is as much above man as the heaven is high above the earth. This is what the Prophet said: " As the heavens are high above the earth, so are My ways high above your ways, and My plans above your plans" (Isa. 55:9). By this he intended, as the true sage said [Guide 3:20], to posit a dissimilarity and difference (hefres we-hevdeî) between Recall that in Ibn Tibbon's later usage mofet (unlike re' ayah) refers to a "true [i.e. apodictic] demonstration." See Perus ha-millim ha-zarot, "Introduction," p. 18; and s.v. mofet, p. 63. *5^ The term "divine matters" (Hnyanim 3elohiyyim) comprises both ideas bearing on celestial bodies and ideas related to separate intelligences. See Perus ha-millim ha- zaroty p. 74, s.v. Hnyanim 'elohiyyim. This incidental remark is directed against contemporaries who upheld precisely this anthropomorphic view; see Fraenkel, "The Problem of Anthropomorphism." Kohot; the variant reading: mahut (= essence) seems to be erroneous in view of the context (God's governance is accomplished through the powers of the heavenly bodies). 125</page><page sequence="86">God's ways and thoughts, i.e., His governance, providence, and knowledge, and man's ways and thoughts. This means that God's providence over the creatures subject to His providence is unlike the care we take of things in our custody; nor is His governance of what He governs like our governance, nor His knowledge of what He knows like our knowledge of what we know. Rather, the dissimilarity (hefres) between them resembles the dissimilarity between the heaven and the earth, for he [Isaiah] found no greater difference. (PQ, §§512-513)153 In Ibn Tibbon's view, knowledge bearing on the heaven comprises two parts: that of their motion, and that of their powers and effects on the sublunar world. The former is attainable by man and this knowledge offers a proof of God's existence: "By this way, man obtained an indubitable proof of the existence of God, be He exalted." It is only the latter kind of knowledge that is difficult to attain: first because "only little of the knowledge of the powers of the celestial hosts" can be attained,154 and, second, because knowing the effects of the heaven is tantamount to knowing God's providence and thoughts, which man cannot attain. For our purposes, the main point here is that Ibn Tibbon considers the heaven's ceaseless motion to offer a proof of God's existence.155 * Precisely the same ideas reappear in M a* amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim, in almost identical wording. Discussing the metaphor of the Throne of Glory, Ibn Tibbon writes: The heaven provides an indication of something other than itself, which brought it into being (himsi'am), and which moves it with that permanent motion (]oa-tenuah ha-hi ha- ue</page><page sequence="87">Gad Freudenthal temidiyyit). ... For scholars know that it is impossible for the heaven to have [this endless motion] owing to its essence [or on its own], for it is a finite body.156 [Hence] the permanent (temidiyyit) motion of the heaven provides them [the scholars] with an indication of the existence of the separate intelligences. .... Concerning the separate [intelligences], the fact that they are finite [in number] has been established for them. I.e. either the separate [intelligence] is one, in which case it is the deity; or [the intelligences] are many, in which case their plurality cannot but be finite, as mentioned in the third premise of the premises in the beginning of the second Part [of the Guide], For their plurality can be construed only by one being a cause and the other an effect, as can be seen in premise 16 and in other chapters of the Treatise. Then, the First, which is a Cause that does not itself have a cause- for it is the First- is the deity. This way the heaven indicates the existence of God. The Master has said this in [a number of] places in his noble treatise, (p. 22:2-12) Also quoted in Fraenkel, From Maimonides to Samuel Ibn Tibbon, p. 203. See Perus ha-millim ha-zarot, "Introduction" (p. 13), where Ibn Tibbon explains that each planet has "its own specific power." Ibn Tibbon's argument was often used in debates over the validity of astrology. On the epistemology of this kind of experience- based knowledge see Gad Freudenthal, "Maimonides' Philosophy of Science," in Kenneth Seeskin, ed., The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 134-66. The opening sentence of the quoted passage- "It is difficult to find a proof [mofet] concerning the upper things and the divine matters" - although ostensibly summarizing the claim of the entire passage that follows, in fact bears only on the second kind of knowledge pertaining to the heaven. I.e., being a finite body it can accommodate only a finite force, which cannot cause an infinite motion. 127</page><page sequence="88">We see that Ibn Tibbon believed that he and Maimonides agreed that the unceasing circular motion of the heaven proves God's existence. Moreover, "the clear evidence {re3 ay ah) to the effect that the heaven indicates the existence of the deity and His Glory is given by the words of the prophet (peace be upon him): Ί saw God sitting on a Throne' [Isa. 6:1], from which it becomes evident that he apprehended (his'sig) God via the Throne [= heavenly spheres] and the serafim [= intelligences] attending upon Him, not via His essence" (p. 22:12-15). Explaining "that God can be apprehended via His Throne, which is the heaven, and what is above it and in it" is "a major principle" (p. 22:18-19). Ibn Tibbon expresses the same ideas, albeit more obliquely, in his interpretation of Isaiah's vision, too. Isaiah (6:4) refers to the motion of the doorposts ('ammot ha-sippim), which Ibn Tibbon identifies with the heavenly bodies (p. 33:25). He understands the prophet's statement that they moved as referring to the motion of the "body that encompasses the earth" (p. 33:13-15, 18-19), namely, with a circular "ceaseless eternal" (temidit nisbit) motion (p. 36:3-4; also 33:19-20), brought about by the desire of the heavenly bodies - or rather of their spheres- for the separate intellects (pp. 33:20-21; 36:1-3). Producing this motion "of the doorposts" is the foremost "activity" (pe'ullah) of the separate intellects (p. 33:10-11), through which "it becomes manifest and known that the entire world is full of God's Glory," Ibn Tibbon concludes.157 Ibn Tibbon also analyzes Jacob's prophetic vision (Gen. 28:12ff) as a parable of the order of investigation, which leads from the basic material facts to an apprehension of the deity (pp. 54:1-56:15). As we have seen, in his two major works Ibn Tibbon upholds the thesis that the motion of the heaven is eternal and that this eternal motion provides a proof of God's existence and unity. As noted, he believes that this is Maimonides' view, too: "The Master has said this 128</page><page sequence="89">Gad Freudenthal in [a number of] places in his noble treatise." When Ibn Tibbon wrote the marginal gloss that made the Hebrew version of the Guide state this thesis, he certainly did so in good faith, out of a sincere belief that this is what the Master thought. At the same time, he attributed to him a view that he himself took to have been demonstrated as true. Eight hundred years later, having learnt from hermeneutic theory how much the reading of a text can be colored by one's own prior beliefs ("prejudices," in Gadamer's terminology), we may wonder to what extent Ibn Tibbon's own convictions unconsciously (as I would assume) informed his reading of the Guide. This appreciation has no direct bearing on our understanding of Maimonides, but it may help understand the genesis of Ibn Tibbon's gloss. POSTSCRIPTUM (added in proof) In my discussion of the reception of M a' amar Yiqqawu ha-mayim I regrettably overlooked Menahem haMeiri (1249-1315), whose ambivalent attitude to Samuel Ibn Tibbon's views is extensively discussed in Moshe Halbertal, Between Torah and Wisdom. Rabbi Menachem ha-Meiri and the Maimonidean Halakhists in Provence (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 2000), pp.69-75 (Heb).
