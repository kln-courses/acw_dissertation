<plain_text><page sequence="1">SANDRA CELT THE QUARREL BETWEEN THE PROFESSORS AND THE POETS (with apologies to Jonathan Swift) Pietro Marchesani, Inessa Pawlowska, Milo De Angelis, and Emi Rabuffetti, NIEBO. Translation into Italian of selected works by Boleslaw Lesmian. Milan, 1980 [Rivista di poesia n. 11, February-March]. Pp. 103. Jerzy Niemojowski, POEMATY: Przekiad i szkic o teorii i praktyce przekladu poetyckiego. London, 1978 [Syrinx Vol. I, August]. Pp. 130. Poetry translation, being an art even more subjective than prose transla tion, is therefore vulnerable by definition; no matter what you do, someone will inevitably challenge your interpretation. If you give a somewhat free rendition (e.g. transposing a Petrarchan sonnet into Elizabethan, or turning a metaphor into an analogy), the legendary Professor Horrendo will immedi ately attack your version as "not being the same thing;" if you proceed word-for-word in an interlinear-crib fashion, you will produce a rather sorry composition which is neither poetry nor English, but which has definite mer its as a gloss on the original and an indication as to the sentence structure and thinking pattern of the original language. The resulting quarrel between the professors and the literati is classic by now, and quite easily comprehen sible in terms of territorial apprehensions: if foreign-language professors ad mitted that literature can be translated, they would lose their jobs; the same would happen to translators if they admitted it cannot! Jerzy Niemojowski and the Italian translators of Lesmian appear to have been aware of these problems, albeit to varying degrees, and their treatment deserves comparison in a joint review/critique because of their divergent ap proaches. In both cases, introductions and footnotes attempted to make the readers familiar with a foreign writer, sometimes giving biographical data, sometimes explaining allusions, occasionally even paraphrasing a folk cus tom. Here, however, they part company: the two applications of this infor mation differ considerably, although both volumes adequately render the meaning of the respective originals. Lesmian believed in the magic of words and, like Viktor Shklovsky, at tempted to make language ' 'new'' and unfamiliar in order to inspire wonder (e.g. make a stone really stony). By "new," however, he did not mean contemporary?in his opinion, if you make everything contemporary, there is no mystery left to explain; modern sobriety deprives human beings of their right to rhythmic communion with the universe. His metaphysical ap proach to nature was one of loving unity: if a flower could take notes on its 150</page><page sequence="2">The Quarrel between the Professors and the Poets 151 own development, he writes, what a lovely poem that would be! One can easily see that with these "givens," Lesmian's works would show a type of folkloric-visionary symbolism; the Italian translators point this out, and also mention his linguistic innovations based on the capacity of the Polish lan guage for combining prefixes and suffixes at will ad infinitum. The Italian translators adequately document these facts and convey the meaning of the poems, but in my opinion they do not derive the necessary conclusions from their own scholarship. While offering Lesmian's treatise on poetry in Italian translation, they ignore his most cardinal precept, namely that rhythm has priority over words. Most of the poems are rendered in an imagistic prose reminiscent of a rhymeless Baudelaire writing in Ital ian; this is particularly disconcerting in the language which gave us terza rima and the hendecasyllable. Significantly, the few poems which are trans lated into verse are also the ones which depart the farthest from the meaning: "byla losom poshiszna" (she was obedient to the fates) becomes "li accolse come una scorza" (she welcomed them like bark) ("Dusza w niebiosach/L'anima nei cieli"). Although the names of the translators are hidden in a preliminary "notice" rather than attached to each poem?one of the goat-getting elements of this translation is that the reader must hunt for information in the most unlikely of places?I was able to determine that there was no pattern as to which translators worked into verse, rhythmical prose, or straight prose. "Dziewczyna/La ragazza," for instance, is done entirely in unlined prose, which is something like reading E.V. Rieu's nov elistic rendition of the Odyssey. Some of Lesmian's neologisms did shine through?in "Pantera," for in stance, "przeciwzlote" was beautifully rendered as "antidorate;" else where, "przyziemny chlod" was translated as "respiro di fresco" (excellent, since the Italians usually associate earth with heat and dust). I was also heartened by the translators' courage in printing the Polish original side-by side with the Italian version. However, I found the lack of stylistic consist ency somewhat sloppy (an Italian knowing no Polish would probably have found it confusing as well) and suspect that the translators may have been trying to deflate criticism in advance by offering "something for everyone." Unfortunately, however, sitting on the fence usually nets a person nothing but a hideful of splinters. Niemojowski, on the other hand, appears not only to have done more re search, but also to have practiced what Eliot preached. He translates impli cations instead of referring the reader to ponderous footnotes which militate against novelty and recognition. Rather, he saves the footnotes for purposes of explaining allusions and translating into Polish the Italian/French/Sanskrit passages Eliot had left in those languages in his orginal English. Closely hugging the curve of Eliot's "objective correlative," he treats the poetic phenomenon as structural evocation (without, however, admitting that the translator's version is as subjective an interpretation as any other reader's).</page><page sequence="3">152 The Polish Review Niemojowski aims at a literary rather than a literal version and believes translation of poetry is possible unless you expect transsubstantiation and posit that language is complete, inviolable, and not to be tampered with. For instance, "zlosc ssie krew" would not have identical phonetics in, say, Ital ian. (We may mention here Ezra Pound's carryover-of-sound concept: "Les sanglots longs/des violons/de l'automne" etc. sounds much more mournful than "the long sobs of the autumn violins," which is why in my version I have opted for "Autumnal sobs/long-drawn throbs/strings that moan.") Niemojowski's attitude dovetails quite nicely with Eliot's belief that tradi tion becomes meaningless without contemporary follow-up, since societal emotions degenerate unless the poet makes people aware of their own feel ings, keeping the language alive by flexing its parameters. Niemojowski ap pears to be a poet in his own right (Epigramaty, 1963), and it shows?both in his translation and in the principles of translation he enunciates in the the oretical portion: 1. Poetic translation should not be different from poetic writing (cf. Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee, in his Essay on the Principles of Translation: the translated work "should have all the ease of original composition" 2. Achieve a parallel degree of saturation of sounds, meaning and poetic space (melopea, logopea and fanopea) 3. You need not use existing "to" language conventions?a new conven tion may be created if necessary. Language in its present state can be an in adequate instrument for the "taming process"?an animal need not be ma neuvered into a preexisting cage to be tamed. 4. Translation is an attempt to invade unknown territory. Intuition is your only sure guide. Here, however, he seems to think there is a single correct way to translate any given thing, which strikes me as the endearing, slightly cocky self-confidence of a person whom criticism has never managed to in timidate. However, Niemojowski appears not to know Eliot's "The Func tion of Criticism," wherein the poet cautioned against throwing standards overboard in favor of individual subjectivity: the "inner voice" can easily be a bulwark of tastelessness and self-indulgence. 5. Explain the allusions if necessary. 6. Aim for total effect, not details. To a remarkable degree, his translations achieve the goals his principles have set, although there are some differences of ambience which I feel have not come across for one reason or another. I miss Eliot's inferiority complex of aging elitism (ever meet an elitist who did not consider himself a member of the elite?) and find that his unusual metaphors and oxymorons sound overprecise in Polish rather than decadent, but it is hard to blame Niemojowski for items so far beyond his control. In "Prufrock," for in stance, he translates "butt-ends" as "niedopalki" (good!); "The Waste Land" contains lovely enjambments and translated implications: "And her</page><page sequence="4">The Quarrel between the Professors and the Poets 153 only thirty-one" is rendered "a jej tylko trzydziesci jeden rokow," "Goonight" as 44 4Branoc," and "Shakespeherian Rag" 44szekspihirowski szlagier." However, I find that he sometimes misses the mark when it comes to precision, choosing the wrong word or being overly specific about something which is ambiguous in the original. For instance, rendering the Prufrock 4 4Do I dare/disturb the universe? "as 4 4Czyz si$ osmiel^/wszechswiat niepokoic?" is unduly anthropomorphic; "macic" or "zaburzyc" would have been more accurate imagery. 44So how should I presume?" turns into "wi?c jak mam na to si? zdobyc?" and 44When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall," 44Gdy wij$ si? na scianie drganie mnie ujawnia." Is he not sinning here against his own precepts nos. 2 and 6 above? An example of overspecificity in 4The Wasteland": 44Hurry up please it's time" becomes "Pospieszcie si?panstwo juz czas" (emphasis supplied). I was also somewhat bothered by his translation of 44of a moment's surrender" as 44oddania si? chwili." 44Ash Wednesday" appeared the weakest of Niemojowski's efforts in this volume in terms of accuracy, although it is of course an adequate rendering of Eliot's style. 44Vans" beating the air were somehow misunderstood as 4'fans"?the difference between 44wachlarze" and 44wiejaczki" (do zboza). In and of itself this is not Serious, but it changes the imagery: 44small and dry air" is like winnowed grain in Eliot's English, whereas it becomes 44suche i rzadkie" in Polish. 44Sit still" (the English is ambiguous as to whether movement or speech is being stifled) becomes "milczec," and chirping noises inside the bones (potential life) become 4 4grzechocace"? which, at least for me, carries the association of death. 4Tour Quartets" just might be the most successful members of the volume, capturing perfectly the ascetic longing fraught with decadent sym bolism which characterizes Eliot's more mystic works. (In Polish, this is vaguely reminiscent of poems by a now-famous gentleman formerly known as 44Andrzej Jawieri.") In 4'Little Gidding" particularly, I marveled at how Niemojowski was able to conserve the circular imagery so masterfully that it sounded even more sedately cyclical than the original! Unfortunately, however, Niemojowski the critic does not practice what Niemojowski the translator preaches. After expounding so eloquently on the importance of disregarding conventions and aiming for total effect rather than details, he faults two translations of Eliot, one of them by Czeslaw Milosz, for allegedly failing to achieve literal accuracy and for not having discerned the "obvious fact" that the original contained a terza rima without rhyme. This sounds inconsistent coming from a person who, in 44Ash Wednesday", failed to rhyme the three lines Eliot rhymed so originally in no. 5: slender, offend her, surrender. However, this is minor carping, made irresistible only by the fact that the translator himself indulged in identical minor carping. Self-assured flamboy ance such as Niemojowski's, after all, produced masterpieces of translation</page><page sequence="5">154 The Polish Review during the boisterous Elizabethan period, and even some of the mistakes have turned out to be felicitous. It may even be impossible to produce a masterpiece of any kind without some degree of nerve. In the final analysis, a comparison of the cautious Italian Lesmian and the dashing Polish Eliot may well illustrate Georges Mounin's dictum concern ing "professorial'' and "literary" translations. The professors, he writes, run the risk of being weak; but the literati run the equally serious risk of be ing wrong on occasion. NEW AND RECENT TITLES IN POLISH AFFAIRS The Polish Brethren.
