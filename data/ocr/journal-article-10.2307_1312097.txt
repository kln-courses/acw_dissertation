Teaching re- sponsibilities in landscape architec- ture include advising graduate stu- dents and, typically, teaching two courses each year, a course on eco- logical concepts for sustainable land- scape design and a landscape design course as a partner to a landscape architect. Teaching responsibilities in horticultural science include advising graduate students and, typically, teach- ing one course per year in the theory and practice of establishing and main- taining sustainable plant systems. Research responsibilities could include areas of inquiry such as understand- ing how managed plant communities, in both urban and agricultural set- tings, affect landscape structure and function; understanding the ecologi- cal implications of planting systems in both landscape and production set- tings; or defining biological and envi- ronmental parameters for the integra- tion of sustainable plant communities into designed landscapes. Minimum qualifications include a Ph.D. in a biological field related to horticulture or ecology, demonstrated effective- ness in research, and demonstrated effectiveness in teaching-related ac- tivities. Desired qualifications include evidence of background in landscape ecology; consulting or teaching re- lated to landscape design or planning; evidence of successful program initia- tion, development, completion, and publication in refereed journals; prac- tical experience in horticulture, agri- culture, or design; and clear potential for collaborative work and future scholarly contribution. Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae, a statement of teaching and research interests as related to this position, and the names, addresses, and tele- phone numbers of three references to: Chair, Landscape Ecology Search Committee, Department of Horticul- tural Science, University of Minne- sota, 305 Alderman Hall, St. Paul, MN 55108.

Today, the biological sciences have become focal points for many government, industry, and academic affairs, both nationally and internationally, dramatizing the importance of public involvement by professional biologists. Such involvement is critical, not only for the continuation of biological research, but also for the well-being of the world we inhabit. The Congressional Science Fellowship program brings well-qualified working biologists into direct contact with Washington's decision-making process. The program fosters understanding among biologists of how public policy is formulated and how it can be made responsive to the essential insights of the biological disciplines. Biologists who share these concerns and who meet the criteria outlined below are invited to apply for this fellowship. The award recipient would spend one year as the AFBS Congressional Science Fellow, working as a special legislative assistant on the staff of a congressional committee or directly with an appropriate member of Congress. In fall 1993, the fellow would receive an orientation on congressional and executive agency operations. He or she would then participate in a year-long seminar series organized by AAAS to address science and public policy issues. Fellows have unique opportunities to gain firsthand experience about public policy making and to demonstrate to elected officials the importance of formal interaction between government and the scientific community. After the fellow- ship year, a fellow can continue his or her chosen career better able to serve the profession and society at large. Criteria The fellowship program is open to all biologists holding an earned doctorate in the life sciences who can demonstrate exceptional compe- tence in a relevant biological discipline; who have established leadership in areas of community service and concern; and who have a strong commitment to and experience in applying biological knowledge to the improvement of public policy in the United States. Further details are given in the application imaterials. Award For the 1993-1994 fellowship year (1 September 1993 - 31 August 1994), one-half sabbatical support or a comparable postdoctoral stipend (up to $30,000) is planned for one fellow. If awarded, the fellowship will be adminis- tered by AFBS directly. Deadline for receipt of complete application materials, including letters of reference, at AFBS is 1 February 1993.
