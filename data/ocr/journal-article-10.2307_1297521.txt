Ernst Leitz of Wetzlar has been manufacturing Leica? cameras, the world's finest, for over a half century. Even the earliest Leicas were used for photomicrography. So over the years we have learned a thing or two about this art. And this knowledge has been applied to developing the most comprehensive and sophisti- cated equipment available for photomicrography. Leitz offers six systems rang- ing from a relatively inexpensive manual arrangement to a cam- era system automated to the highest-degree. You have a choice of formats from 35mm to 4 x 5 inches, in- cluding an advanced Super 8 cine camera, the Leicina.@ In addition to cameras and accessories, Leitz offers you a wealth of application knowledge. Our Laboratory for Applied Mi- croscopy at our Rockleigh, N.J. headquarters can help you solve virtually any photomicro- graphic problem. So, if you are considering equipment for photomicro- graphy, be sure to include us in the picture. E. Leitz, Inc. Dept. BS7 Rockleigh, N.J. 07647.

Muscatine and James W. Porter Adaptations resulting from the possession of endosymbiotic algae enable reef corals to flourish in nutrient-poor tropical waters. The major adaptations are (a) a polytrophic feeding capacity; (b) conservation of nutrients, such as nitrogen, by retention and recycling within a coral head; and (c) accelera- tion of calcification in the light. The functions of algae and animals thus superimposed result in an association which can exploit the environment better than either associant can alone. (Accepted for publication 21 December 1976) Oxygen Is Toxic! 462 Irwin Fridovich The stepwise reduction of molecular oxygen involves several intermediates which are much more reactive than 02 itself. The propensity of 02 for univalent pathways of reduction exposes respiring cells to these intermediates. The defenses against this threat are discussed.

Scott Vitamin E and selenium are interrelated in the prevention of several well-delineated diseases of animals. Recent discov- eries provide a biochemical basis for understanding the nature of many of these syndromes. Although other vital metabolic functions for these nutrients may be discovered, vitamin E and selenium have primary roles in the protection of biological membranes, a function of broad importance in nutrition and health.

The campus, itself a working botanical collection, is dotted with special attractions open to visitors of all ages and interests. While attending the AIBS Meeting take time to enjoy these attractions, explore the quiet spots and discover for yourself the beauty of the campus that includes extensive science and research facilities, a developing medical education complex, and an impressive group of academic residence halls and recreational/cultural facilities. A large area south of the main campus is chiefly devoted to environmental research related to water quality and to improved scientific methods for agriculture. The following activities and places of interest are but a few of the attractions you are invited to explore during your visit. * Historic Beaumont Tower, the central campus landmark, stands on the site of the first building in the United States in which agriculture was taught as a science. The Tower's carillon is played twice daily, Monday through Friday, at 7:50 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., and at 2:00 p.m. on Sundays. Visitors are welcome inside the bell chambers during these times. * The Kellogg Center for Continuing Education -One of the largest and finest equipped conference centers in the nation, the Kellogg Center is headquarters for MSU's Continuing Education Service and also serves as the nation's largest laboratory for hotel and restaurant students. During the AIBS Meeting, numerous society-sponsored sessions, committee meetings, and special meal functions will be held in the Kellogg Center. * The Beal-Garfield Botanic Garden-From the time the University was situated in a clearing in the forest, care has been taken to maintain the natural beauty of the 5,000-acre MSU campus. The University has received national awards for its site planning and the integration and wealth of its plant materials. Labeled plants provide a vast collection serving the needs of teaching and research. The Beal-Garfield Botanic Garden, with more than 5,000 herbaceous plant varieties, is among the outstanding campus-located botanic gardens, and the Horticulture Gardens display separate assemblages of annuals, spring bulbs, peren- nials, and roses. The 2,010 acres of existing or planned campus development include more than 7,000 different species and varieties of trees, shrubs, and vines, 32 miles of roadways, 96 miles of walkways, and 11 miles of bicycle paths. * The Museum-Containing three floors of anthropological, biological, geological, and historical displays, the MSU Museum features exhibits as diverse as oriental teapots, antelope habitats, and Inca cities. Permanent exhibits include the skull of a 500,000-year-old mammoth, a frontier trading post, an 1890 crossroads store, and a watch shop. Natural history exhibits, especially those of Michigan wildlife, are numerous. The effects of the intrusion of man on the environment and the history of Michigan Indians are vividly displayed in diorama. Visitors may purchase unusual imported articles from the gift shop.

Qualified personnel will staff a licensed center on the MSU campus for the care of children in age groups 0-2 years, 2-6 years, and 6-11 years. The child care center will be open 7:30 a.m.-5:30 p.m., Monday-Friday, 22-26 August. A well-balanced lunch and two snacks will be served daily. The ratio of personnel attending the infants will be 1:3. Parents of infants are requested to provide appropriate food and disposable diapers. Recreational and educational field trips have been planned for children 6-11 years of age. If the weather permits, children will be encouraged to participate in outdoor activities. Therefore, a change of clothing and a bathing suit should be left at the child care center for the duration of the child's stay. The cost per day for care of each child will be $7.20/full day or $4.00/half day. Because physical facilities for child care are limited and CHILD CARE REQUEST Child's Name Parent's Name Home Address additional staff must be hired during the Annual AIBS Meeting, preregistration is required.

SCHEER PATTERNS OF LIFE is distinguished by its conceptual approach to biology which clearly demonstrates to introductory-level students the relationship of facts to general principles. Throughout the text, there is an emphasis on human needs and interests-principles are exemplified by and applied to aspects of human life and health. The underlying theme of the book is that the existence, generation, maintenance, and reproduction of order or pattern are distinctive features of life. Each part of the book also has a unifying theme. In the first part, the author explains the principles of mechanisms and then uses them to help students learn plant and animal structures and functions. Part II is unified by an ethology of human behavior related to other familiar animals. The third part of the text focuses on the molecular theory of genes and includes detailed consideration of patterns for regenerating life. The theory of organic evolution by natural selection is discussed in Part IV. In the final part, the model of an ecosystem is applied to natural communities and the theory of population growth is applied to contemporary human concerns. Exceptionally well illustrated, PATTERNS OF LIFE provides a balanced, easy-to- read introduction to biology which helps students understand biology. Tentative: 488 pages; $14.95. August 1977.

Editorial Policy: The editors will welcome manuscripts on all biological or biologically oriented subjects, but they urge the authors in specialized areas to use language understandable to as broad an audience as possible. Interdisciplinary and state-of-the-art articles will be particularly welcome. Feature articles must not exceed 5,000 words, about five BioScience pages. Titles should be as short as possible, consistent with the clarity. Illustrations and tables are acceptable and are recommended for inclusion when appropriate. Since the word count above does not allow for illustrations and tables, text length should be adjusted to accommodate them. Manuscripts will be reviewed by at least two scientists competent in the field. The editors reserve the right to edit the manuscripts; alterations will not be made without the permission of the author(s). Papers are accepted for publication on the condition that they are submitted solely to BioScience and that they will not be reprinted or translated without the consent of the editors. The publication dates of accepted papers will usually be in the order of acceptance. The date the manuscript was accepted for publication will be indicated on the published paper. Normally, there is a minimum lapse of 6 months between receipt of manuscript and publication. Preparation of Manuscript: Manuscripts must conform to the Council of Biological Editors Style Manual (available from the AIBS). In the preparation of copy, manuscripts should be neatly typewritten, double-spaced throughout, including references, tabular material, footnotes, captions for illustrations, etc., on one side only of 81/2 x 11 inch white bond paper. Please submit the original plus one additional copy. The author should retain a copy. A separate title page should be provided, and footnotes, figure captions, and tables should be typed on sheets separate from the text. At least one of the copies must be complete with figures, tables, and references. Please convert all weights and measures to the metric system. Illustrations: Illustrations such as photographs, maps, line drawings, and graphs should be submitted, unmounted, with the manuscript. Number figures consecutively and identify on the reverse side. Glossy photographs are required and must be at least 4 x 5 inches but not larger than 8'/2 x 11 inches. Originals of drawings, in professionally finished form, are requested. Generally, drawings larger than 8/2 x 11 inches are not acceptable. Lettering on all illustrations must be sufficiently large to allow reduction to a double or single column. Figure captions for illustrations should be typed on a separate page or pages. Abstract: An abstract of 50 words or less must accompany the manuscript; therefore, a summary is not required. Footnotes: Footnotes in text should be kept to a minimum and should be indicated by consecutive superscript numerals rather than by asterisks or other symbols. Footnotes in tables are represented by symbols shown on page 141 of the CBE Style Manual. References: "References Cited" includes literature, published and unpublished, which is retrievable by readers. Text citations are designated by the author's name and year of publication in parentheses (Jones 1975). Use the first author's name and "et al." for publications having more than two authors (Smith et al. 1965), but list all authors in the references. All works cited in the text must be listed in "References Cited" and vice versa. Use the BIOSIS List of Serials for journal abbreviations.
