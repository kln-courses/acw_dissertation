ABSTRACT Case reviews are given of deployment acci- dents of the GM 1973-76 air cushion restraint system where the occupant injury was AIS 3 or greater. Many of these injuries occurred in frontal accidents of minor to moderate collision severity where there was no intrusion or distor- tion of the occupant compartment. Dummy and animal test results are noted that indicate that these types of injuries could have occurred if the occupant was near the air cushion module at the time of cushion deployment. An analysis is given that indicates that for frontal accidents a restraint effectiveness of 50 percent in mitigating AIS 3 or greater injuries might be achieved if an air cushion system can be designed which would not seriously injure out-of-position occupants while still providing restraint for normally seated occupants. GENERAL MOTORS EQUIPPED 11,321 vehicles with driver and front seat passenger air cushion re- straint systems (ACRS) during the 1973 through 1976 model years. The first cars equipped with the ACRS were 1000 1973 Chevrolet Impalas. This initial effort was called the Field Trial Pro- gram and the cars were identified as FTP cars. During the 1974 through 1976 model years, 10,321 Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs were produced. For these cars, the ACRS was a customer option available on Buick Le Sabre, Electra and Rivi- era; the Oldsmobile 88, 98 and Toronado; and the Cadillac Deville, Brougham, Fleetwood and Eldo- rado. The ACRS option was priced on the basis of a projected high sale volume. This level of customer demand never developed and the ACRS op- tion was cancelled at the end of the 1976 model year. DESCRIPTION OF THE 1973-76 GM ACRS The 1973-76 GM ACRS consisted of driver and passenger (center and right front) systems, two crash sensors, a large capacitor to provide ener- gy to deploy the driver and passenger systems in the event that battery power was lost during the collision event, and a diagnostic system to pro- vide the driver with information about the ACRS readiness to deploy. The driver air cushion module was mounted to a specially designed steer- ing wheel and energy absorbing column. A fixed knee bolster was used to provide lower torso and leg restraint. The passenger air cushion module was mounted in the lower part of the instrument panel in front of the right front passenger seat- ing position. It was designed to restrain both the right front and center front passengers, either singularly or together. Lower torso and leg restraint was provided by a separate high pressure, low volume knee cushion which was de- ployed inside of the larger volume, lower pres- sure head/torso cushion. Manual lap belts were provided for each front seat occupant position. A crash recorder was installed to provide data to determine (i) if the crash was below the de- ployment threshold, (ii) if the crash started before the cushion was deployed, and (iii) if the crash severity exceeded the severity of a 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier collision. Detailed descriptions of the various components of the 1973-76 GM ACRS are given in papers by Campbel 1 (1)*, Klove and 0glesby(2), and Louckes, et al (3) . DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE 1973-76 GM ACRS The 1973-76 GM ACRS was subjected to exten- sive development and validation test programs. A variety of sled tests was conducted to assure that the ACRS would provide restraint for dif- ferent occupant sizes (5th percentile female, 50th percentile male and 95 percentile male), different seat positions (full forward, mid and full rear), different combinations of front seat * Numbers in parentheses refer to papers listed under References 5.53 0096-736X/89/9705-0053$02.50 Copyright 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">passengers (right front, right and center front, and center front) and different inflator environ- mental temperatures (180° F, 72° F and -30° F). Fluman volunteer sled tests were conducted with both the driver system at Southwest Re- search lnstitute(4) and the passenger system at Holloman Air Force Base(5). In both test programs, the volunteers were seated in normal occupant posture and the cushions were deployed before the occupants had moved significantly forward relative to the body buck in response to the sled acceleration. Tests were conducted with increasing simulated collision severity with the most severe for each system being the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier collision simula- tion. The restraint performance for the center front occupant was not evaluated with human volunteers. No significant injuries occurred. Only minor abrasions were noted. For an early version of the passenger sys- tem (a pre FTP system), a series of static deployment tests was conducted to evaluate the effect of the interaction between the deploying cushion and the occupant. In these tests, a volunteer was seated on the seat and leaned forward, in various degrees, toward the instru- ment panel. The passenger cushion was deployed without the sled being accelerated. The test series was terminated after the volunteer experi- enced a slight concussion in a test where he was leaning forward with a torso angle of 29 degrees past vertical (5) . An animal test program to evaluate the ef- fect of the interactions between the deploying passenger cushion and children who may be near the instrument panel at time of deployment was conducted at Wayne State Universi ty(6) . Anes- thetized baboons were placed in various posi- tions near the instrument panel and various passenger system concepts were deployed while the body buck remained stationary. Test results indicated that significant injuries to the ani- mals could be produced if the cushion was in- flated too rapidly. Based on these results, the variable rate inflator concept used in the 1973-76 GM ACRS passenger system was developed. Subsequent anesthetized baboon and chimpanzee tests of the 1973-76 GM passenger ACRS produced no significant injuries for the animal positions and gas inflation rates evaluated. (Note: The results of the animal tests of the 1973-76 GM passenger ACRS are not described in the Patrick and Nyquist(6) paper.) A series of cadaver tests was conducted at Wayne State University to evaluate the effect of the interaction between the deploying trim cover panel of the passenger air cushion module and the legs of front seat occupants. The tests were conducted in a stationary body buck with the cadavers seated in a normal seating posture. Their legs were aligned squared to the passenger module trim cover panel and the cushion was de- ployed. No lower extremity fractures occurred with the 1973-76 GM passenger ACRS. To assess the efficacy of the crash sensing system, a variety of car-to-car and car-to-obsta- cle collisions was staged. These tests and their results are described in a paper by Wilson and Piepho(7). The tests included 30 mph and 40 mph frontal rigid barrier impacts; right and left 30 mph, 30 degree angle rigid barrier im- pacts; 30 mph offset rigid pole impacts; 30 mph frontal impact with a bumper underride; and car-to-car impacts involving front of ACRS car to side of car, front of ACRS car to rear of car and a multiple impact scenario. In the majority of these tests, the Hybrid II dummy responses were well below the FMVSS 208 limits. The main exception was the 40 mph, rigid barrier tests where none of the Hybrid II dummies (driver, cen- ter front, right front) met all the limits. This test result indicated that in the more severe accidents, the 1973-76 GM ACRS would not mitigate all serious occupant injury. The results for FMVSS 208, 30 mph, frontal rigid barrier tests are given in Table 1. Note that the 1973-76 GM ACRS values were well below the compliance limits defined by FMVSS 208 for passive restraint systems. These results, plus the results obtained from the human volunteer, animal, cadaver, dummy sled tests and full scale vehicle tests, indicated that the 1973-76 GM ACRS should have provided reasonably effective occupant restraint for a variety of real-world, frontal accident configurations and severities. RESTRAINT EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 1973-76 GM ACRS A note was put in the owner's manual of all vehicles equipped with the 1973-76 GM ACRS re- questing that GM be notified of any accident in- volving the vehicle. A toll-free telephone number was given for the purpose of communicat- ing this information. In addition, agents of GM Motors Insurance Corporation (MIC) and GM car dealers were asked to report the occurrence of accidents involving the ACRS vehicles. For each deployment accident reported, an investi- gator from the GM Field Accident Review group was sent to inspect the vehicle. Photographs were taken of the exterior and interior damage. Police reports were reviewed for accident de- scriptions and occupant injuries. If agreeable, occupants of the ACRS vehicles were interviewed and medical records reviewed. The severities of the injuries were rated according to the AAAM Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). For each re- ported accident, a report was written summariz- ing the pertinent observations. A study was done by Pursel et al (8) to estimate the restraint effectiveness of the 1973-76 GM ACRS in mitigating AIS 2 and greater and AIS 3 and greater injuries. For each re- ported deployment accident, a search was done of the GM Motors Insurance Company (MIC) files for comparable accidents involving non-air cushion restrained occupants. Comparable MIC accident cases were selected on the basis of collision condition and severity, exterior vehicle damage, and occupant sex, age, and seating position. Percent occurrences of AIS = 0 or 1, AIS = 2, AIS = 3 or 4 and AIS = 5 or 6 were calculated for the ACRS deployment cases that were matched and for the corresponding non-air cushion re- straint cases. The ACRS effectiveness was ob- 5.54</page><page sequence="3">880400 Table 1 - Results of FMVSS 208, 30 mph, Frontal Barrier Tests of the 1973-76 GM ACRS Using Hybrid II Dummies (7) HEAD CHEST ACC.

This difference was divided by the lat- ter percentage to give the ACRS effectiveness. The combined effectiveness estimates of the driver and passenger system for mitigating AIS 2 or greater injuries and AIS 3 or greater inju- ries were 6 and 18 percent, respectively. Effec- tiveness estimates for the driver and passenger systems separately were calculated using the same procedure. All effectiveness estimates of the GM 1973-76 ACRS are given in Table 2. Note these effectiveness estimates are for frontal, deployment type accidents and do not assess the ACRS effectiveness in non-deployment type acci- dents such as roll overs, side impacts and rear end collisions. If these non-deployment type accidents were included, the overall effective- ness would be lower. The effectiveness of both the driver and passenger systems in mitigating AIS 3 or greater injuries was less than expected when compared to the "no significant injuries" results obtained in the human volunteer programs. The negative 34 percent effectiveness for mitigating AIS 2 or greater injuries for the passenger system was quite disturbing since the implication is that overall the ACRS passengers experience more AIS 2 or greater injuries than their matched case, non-air cushion restrained counterparts. MODERATE TO SEVERE DEPLOYMENT ACCIDENTS WHERE THE OCCUPANT WAS PROTECTED A case-by-case study was done of each ACRS deployment accident. At the time of that review (December 1980), there were 216 deployment acci- dents in the 1973-76 GM ACRS file (FTP cases through AC-3020 and 1974-76 cases through LA350) . These accidents involved 216 drivers, 86 right front occupants and 11 center front occupants. Of the 97 front seat passengers, thirteen (13/97 = 13.4%) were children whose ages were ten years or less. Based on analyses of collision descriptions and photographs of exterior and interior damage, each deployment accident was classified in terms of collision severity and interior intrusion/- di storti on severity. Three collision severity classes were used: minor, moderate and severe. An accident was judged as minor collision se- verity if the exterior damaged involved only front-end sheet metal (hood and/or fenders), grille and/or the bumper. For an accident to be judged as moderate collision severity, some rearward displacement of the engine and/or wheels had to occur and the estimated speed of the accident had to be greater than 15 mph. If there was extensive damage to the vehicle and the accident speed was estimated to be greater than 25 mph, then the accident was classified as severe. Two classifications of interior intru- sion/distortion were used: significant and non- significant. If the interior intrusion/distor- tion occurred in the vicinity of a front seat occupant and if it was difficult to conceive how any air cushion could provide protection from the intrusion/distortion, then the accident was judged as having significant occupant compart- ment intrusion and/or distortion. The majority of the 216 deployment acci- dents were classified as minor. None of these accidents had significant occupant interior intrusion or distortion. Several of the severe and moderate collision accidents did. have signi- ficant occupant interior intrusion/distortion. In these accidents it was difficult to conceive how any air cushion system could have mitigated the injuries experienced by the occupants. There were 14 accidents where the collision severities were classified as moderate or se- vere, there was no significant occupant interior intrusion or distortion, and the occupant inju- ries caused by the restraint forces applied by the ACRS were of minor consequence. A summary of the accident conditions, collision severities and occupant injuries for these accidents is given in Table 3. Note that with the exception of one driver injury, the injury severities for these ACRS occupants were AIS 2 or less with the majority being AIS = 1. The exception was a driver who experienced a bruised kidney which was rated as AIS = 3. The kidney injury could have been caused by the vertical loading associ- ated with the car going into a 10 foot deep ra- vine. Even if the kidney injury occurred during the principal front collision event, the re- straint performance of the 1973-76 driver ACRS would be judged as effective because the matched case drivers all experienced AIS = 4, 5 or 6 in- juries. These 14 accidents demonstrate the oc- cupant restraint potential of an air cushion system in moderate to severe frontal accidents when there is no significant intrusion or dis- tortion of the interior in the vicinity of the front seat occupants. 1973-76 GM ACRS DEPLOYMENT ACCIDENTS WITH UNEXPECTED OCCUPANT INJURIES DEPLOYMENT ACCIDENTS WITH AIS 3 OR GREATER INJURIES - Twenty-three front seat occupants (23/313 = 7.3%) experienced AIS 3 or greater in- juries: fourteen drivers (14/216 = 6.5%) and nine front seat passengers (9/97 = 9.3%), three of whom were children. Pertinent information concerning the collision conditions and occupant injuries is given in Table 4. There were five fatalities, four drivers and a one-month-old child who was lying on the seat cushion prior to the accident. Four occupants, all right front passengers, experienced AIS = 4 injuries, all related to leg fractures. Ten drivers and four passengers experienced AIS = 3 injuries. These injuries consisted of fractures to the ribs, arms, legs, and lumbar vertebra; a concussion; a persistent neurological impairment and a bruised kidney. An analysis of the accident data indicated that in ten of these twenty-three cases there was either significant intrusion/distortion of the interior in the vicinity of the occupant 5.56</page><page sequence="5">880400 TABLE 3 - SUMMARY OF GM 1973-76 ACRS DEPLOYMENT ACCIDENTS OF MODERATE TO SEVERE COLLISION SEVERITY, NO SIGNIFICANT OCCUPANT INTERIOR INTRUSION OR DISTORTION, AND RESTRAINT PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE ACRS rACC CASE COLLISION INFORMATION OCCUPANT INFORMATION rACC CASE N0, SEVERITY DESCRIPTION POS.

In these cases it was judged that no air cushion restraint system could have mitigated these injuries. These cases, involv- ing eight drivers and two passengers, are clas- sified as injury expected in Table 4. For the thirteen other cases, the collision severities were minor or moderate. The collision forces were primarily frontal and there was no signi- ficant intrusion or distortion of the interior. Since an air cushion system is expected to pro- vide occupant protection in such accidents, these injuries were more severe than expected. These thirteen cases, involving six drivers (6/216 = 2.8%) and seven front seat passengers (7/97 = 7.2%, two of whom were children), are classified as occupant injuries more severe than expected in Table 4. It is these occupant inju- ries which reduced the effectiveness of the 1973-76 GM ACRS for AIS 3 or greater injuries. SUMMARY OF AIS 2 OR GREATER INJURIES THAT WERE MORE SEVERE THAN EXPECTED - The remainder of the deployment accident cases were reviewed to identify all occupants who experienced neuro- logical problems; significant thoracic organ in- juries including rib fractures; fractures of the hand, arms, legs, pelvis and vertebrae; and sig- nificant abdominal organ injuries that were classified as AIS 2. In each case that was identified, the accident data were reviewed in the same manner as was described for the AIS 3 or greater cases and a judgment was made as to whether or not the injury was more severe than expected. A summary of all AIS 2 or greater in- juries which were judged as more severe than ex- pected is given in Table 5 including those inju- ries noted in Table 4. Twenty drivers (20/216 = 9.3%) and seventeen passengers (17/97 = 17.5%) experienced injuries that appeared to be more severe than expected. These injuries were the principal reason why the effectiveness estimates of the 1973-76 GM ACRS noted in Table 2 were lower than expected. POSSIBLE CAUSES OF UNEXPECTED INJURIES By definition, the only injuries noted in Table 5 were to occupants involved in accidents of minor to moderate collision severity where the collision force was primarily frontal and where there was no significant intrusion or dis- tortion of the car interior in the vicinity of the occupant. In such accidents, only minor in- juries to the occupants were expected provided the occupant was not near the air cushion module at the time of deployment. This expectation is based on the fact that human volunteers experi- enced either no injuries or only minor abrasions in similar simulated collision environments while being restrained by the ACRS(4, 5). On the other hand, if the occupant was near the air cushion module at the time of deployment, signi- ficant forces would be developed between the de- ploying cushion and the occupant. Human volun- teer and animal evaluation of such out-of-posi- tion occupant/cushion interactions indicated the potential for significant injuries(5, 6). Anal- ysis of the accident data for cases noted in Table 5 indicated that both the fatally injured driver and the one-month-old passenger may have been close to the air cushion module at the time of deployment. The legs of the passengers with leg fractures were likely close to the passenger air cushion module at the time of deployment since the module is located in the lower part of the instrument panel, directly in front and close to the legs of the passenger. Consequent- ly, it was hypothesized that most of the inju- ries noted in Table 5 were due to the occupant being close to the air cushion module at the time of deployment and interacting with the de- ploying cushion. To investigate the nature of these interactions a series of dummy and animal tests was conducted. The following is a summary of these tests. DRIVER CHEST INJURIES - Horsch and Culver(9) conducted a series of simulated front- al collisions of moderate severity (23 mph, 14 G) sled tests of the 1973-76 driver ACRS using a Hybrid III dummy. The dummy was seated in a normal driving posture and was allowed to slide forward on the seat in response to the simulated collision pulse. The air cushion was deployed when various spaci ngs between the dummy's chest and the cover of the driver's inflator module were reached. These spacings included the con- dition where the driver's chest had impacted the module cover and was compressing the column when the air cushion was deployed. For comparison purposes, two tests were conducted where the dummy was leaning forward with its chest against the module prior to subjecting it to the sled pulse. In one of these tests, the air cushion was deployed. In the other test, the cushion was not deployed. Pertinent results from these tests are given in Table 6. When the dummy was initially in a normal driver's posture and the cushion was deployed prior to the dummy moving close to the module (Test 1), the maximum chest deflection experienced by the dummy was only 0.7 inch. However, in those tests where the dummy's chest was against the module at deployment (Tests 4, 5 and 6), the dummy's sternum bottomed out on its spine box and a maximum chest compression of 3.3 inches was recorded in each instance. According to Neathery et al (10), this level of thoracic compression is indicative of life threatening thoracic injury. The added effect of deploying the air cushion when the chest is against the module is demonstrated by comparing the results of Tests 6 and 7. For these tests, the dummy was leaned forward with its chest against the module prior to subjecting it to the sled acceleration. The air cushion was deployed in Test 6 and the dummy's sternum was bottomed out on its spine (3.3 inches). In Test 7, the cushion was not deployed and the maximum chest deflection was only 1 inch. These results clearly demonstrate that the 1973-76 driver ACRS had the potential to produce the various thoracic lesions noted in Table 5 if the drivers were near the inflator module when the cushion was deployed.

CHILD INJURIES - Anesthetized pig tests conducted by Chambers University for Volvo(ll) indicated that fatal liver injuries could be produced if the pig was oriented with the region of the abdomen containing the liver aligned with the path of the deploying cushion. These re- sults suggested that the animal positions used by Patrick and Nyquist(6) to evaluate the out- of-position child injury concern for the 1973-76 GM ACRS may not have been the most critical po- sitions. To evaluate this possibility, a second series of animal sled tests was conducted using anesthetized pigs and baboons(12). In these tests, the animals were positioned near the 1973-76 GM ACRS passenger inflator module with either their head, chest or abdomen placed in the path of the deploying cushion. The sled was subjected to a variety of simulated collision pulses and the cushion was deployed. Life threatening injuries to the brain, cervical spine, heart and liver were produced. These re- sults suggest that children who were near the 1973-76 GM ACRS passenger air cushion module when it was deployed could have experienced life threatening injuries as well. These results are entirely consistent with the injuries experi- enced by the two children noted in Table 5 and suggest that the children may have been close to the air cushion module when the cushion was de- ployed. PASSENGER LEG FRACTURES - The relative high frequency of passenger leg fractures (9/97 = 9.3%) which occurred in minor to moderate colli- sions without significant occupant compartment intrusion was quite unexpected because the axial compressive femur loads that were measured in the 30 mph, frontal barrier tests (Table 1) were quite low, ranging from 470 to 1210 pounds. Seven of the nine fractures were to the tibia suggesting that axial compressive femur load may not be the most appropriate response measurement for evaluating the restraint poten- tial of the 1973-76 GM ACRS deploying passenger knee cushion. A pair of specially instrumented lower legs for the Hybrid III dummy were devel- oped by Nyquist and Denton(13). Since the ma- jority of the fractures were to the tibial pla- teau and malleolus, these legs were instrumented to provide measurements of the internal medial and lateral loading of the knee and ankle joints. The shafts of the legs were instru- mented to provide measurement of the bending moment at two cross sections and the axial com- pressive load. Sled tests were conducted using a Hybrid III dummy equipped with these instru- mented lower legs.

Two different leg positions were eval- uated: knees squared to the inflator module cover and knees rotated inboard with the right leg extended and closest to the module. The pertinent leg loads measured in these tests are summarized in Table 7. With the knees squared to the module cover all the leg loads, including the femur loads, were quite low indicating a low potential for leg fracture. In contrast, with the knees rotated inboard, the lateral compres- sive internal knee load of the right leg (the one closest to the module) was 1607 lb. Cadaver fracture load data of Hirsch and Sullivan(14) which was analyzed by Mertz(15) indicate that internal compressive loads of 900 lb between the tibial plateau and femoral condyle may fracture the tibial plateau if the load is biased medi- ally or laterally. Clearly the results of the inboard facing leg test demonstrate the impor- tance of leg orientation in evaluating the effi- cacy of deploying knee cushions and that many of the passenger tibial plateau fractures noted in Table 5 could have been caused by the legs not being squared to the inflator module cover when the air cushion was deployed. HAND AND ARM FRACTURES - No tests were conducted to investigate possible causes for the hand and arm fractures noted in Table 5. However, it is easy to deduce that many of these fractures may have occurred if the cushion impacted the hand, or if the hand was flung hard against the car interior by the deploying air cushion. RESTRAINT EFFECTIVENESS OF AN APR CUSHION SYSTEM DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF CUSHION FORCES APPLIED TO OUT-OF-POSITION OCCUPANTS If a driver and passenger air cushion sys- tem can be designed which would not injure out- of-position occupants while still providing re- 5.61</page><page sequence="10">Table 7 - Summary of Peak Femur Loads and Lateral and Medial Internal Knee and Ankle Loads for Two Positions of the Legs, Moderate Severity Sled Pulse (18 mph, 10 G), and Low Level Deployment of the 1973-76 GM Passenger ACRS.

For example, if the 1973-76 GM ACRS had been designed so that the unexpected AIS 3 or greater injuries noted in Table 4 were AIS 2 or less, then the restraint effectiveness in front- al deployment accidents of such a system would have been 50% instead of 18%. The individual effectiveness estimates for such a driver system and passenger system would have been 41% and 71% instead of 21% and 16%, respectively. These re- straint effectiveness estimates were calculated using the same data and method used to calculate the 1973-76 GM ACRS effectiveness estimates ex- cept the injury severity classification for all the AIS 3 or greater unexpected injuries were changed to AIS = 2. The results of this analy- sis indicate that a sizeable gain in restraint effectiveness can be achieved if air cushion systems are designed to reduce the severity of cushion forces applied to out-of-position occu- pants. Some methods to achieve this objective are discussed in papers by Klove and 0glesby(2) and Horsch and Culver(9). Mertz(16) notes that the tradeoff between inflating the cushion fast enough to provide restraint protection in the 30 mph, frontal barrier crash test required by FMVSS 208, but slow enough so as to not to seriously injure out-of-position occupants is the design dilemma of air cushion systems. Much more effort is needed to address this concern (17, 18, 19, 20) if the restraint effectiveness potential of the air cushion system concept is to be realized. SUMMARY General Motors equipped 11,321 vehicles with driver and front seat passenger air cushion systems during the 1973 through 1976 model years. Based on an analysis of field accident data, Purse! et al estimated the restraint ef- fectiveness of the 1973-76 GM ACRS to be 18% in mitigating AIS 3 or greater injuries when com- pared to unrestrained occupant injuries that oc- curred in comparable accidents. A case by case review of AIS 3 or greater injuries indicated that many of the injuries occurred in frontal accidents of minor to moderate collision severi- ty where there was no intrusion or distortion of the occupant compartment in the vicinity of the occupant. These injuries were classified as un- expected and appear to be due to the occupant being near the air cushion module at the time of deployment. Dummy and animal tests of the 1973-76 GM ACRS were conducted and confirmed the fact that the types and severities of the unex- pected injuries could be produced if the occu- pant was near the ACRS module at the time of de- ployment. It was estimated that a restraint ef- fectiveness of 50% in mitigating AIS 3 or greater injuries in frontal deployment accidents could be achieved if an air cushion system could be developed that reduced the cushion forces ap- plied to out-of-position occupants. 5.62</page><page sequence="11">880400 REFERENCES 1.
