SUHR PLATES 73-74 T HE legend of Herakles and Omphale, trac- ing its origin back to the conflict between Hellenic and pre-Hellenic religions, experi- enced a number of transformations throughout Greek and Roman times as well as later history, changes which reflect the prevailing political movements and the attitude toward woman. The lack of representations in the archaic peri- od is not surprising, but its absence on vases and in the plastic arts of the fifth century is very significant. Except for its appearance in literature, especially in comedies, it was com- pletely ignored until Hellenistic and Roman times when it degenerated into a romantic bur- lesque. Pfuhl 1 implies that prior to the Roman period when the painter represented Herakles as a clumsy, helpless sot, the hero was regarded as too much of a tragic figure to be used as the subject of ridicule in art. Certainly his legend- ary connection with Omphale was current in Attica long before Hellenistic times,2 as the comic poets amply testify.3 In fifth century Athens there was no exclusively tragic charac- ter, least of all Herakles, who could not be moulded by the dramatist to play another type of role,4 although, in general, heroes fitted much more appropriately into tragedy than divinities. In general, Pfuhl's statement is cor- rect as far as Attica is concerned, and the ex- ception in literature, as we shall see, has a very good reason. The non-Attic sculptor before Alexander the Great has given us little of the comic in the career of Herakles, unless we stretch the point by citing the experience of Herakles with the Kerkopes.5 Likewise the vase painter, except for a caricature,6 has treated his labors and sufferings in a serious vein;7 we must, of course, admit that the Caeretan hydria, which portrays Herakles raising havoc with Busiris and his attendants, is an outstanding example, from our viewpoint, of a humorous treatment,8 but in Attica the vase painter seems to have held himself aloof from such an inter- pretation.9 We must be careful, however, to guard against the conclusion that, because of these facts, the Greeks were exclusively inter- ested in Herakles as a hero, for that aspect underlying a comic interpretation of his char- acter, even if submerged, was not unknown. Whatever may have been the reason in the 1 Malerei und Zeich. d. Gr. II 905. 2F.

SUHR [AJA 57 mind of the Attic vase painter for avoiding the comic possibilities in Herakles' career, we can understand why he shunned his connection with Omphale. That such a hero, who was celebrated for his deeds of valor, should be portrayed as playing the role of a hireling to an Oriental woman was repugnant and distaste- ful to the Greek of the mainland where the position of the woman in the family was so different.1' Why, then, did the comic poets of Athens turn to this theme for subject matter? Because it afforded excellent material for a satire on Aspasia's position in the household of Pericles which had achieved considerable noto- riety during the Samian war, if we may trust Plutarch 11 who claims the Milesian woman was responsible for the conflict. All this fur- nished the comic poet with a striking analogy appropriate to the offense committed by the political leader of Athens and makes the excep- tion in Attica which strengthens our rule. One might ask why the Amazon, who supposedly subjected the male to humiliating degradation and whose original home was in the East, was not also banned from the plastic arts of the fifth century. In this case, however, the female played a secondary role in both literature and art in favor of a conquering Herakles or The- seus, and so the disgrace attaching to their family relationships is never obvious; more- over, there was enough of the heroic and tragic in this warring female to make her a worthy opponent on the field of battle, an element altogether missing in the spinning Herakles at the Lydian court. In Graeco-Roman times, when the social status of woman had changed, the spectacle of Herakles, reduced to the level of a weakling in the power of a woman, was a standing favorite. No full account of the story is recorded in extant literature until the time of Apollo- dorus 12 and Diodorus,13 the former giving us the older version; furthermore, there is no allu- sion to it before the time of Croesus. Aeschy- lus 14 mentions that Herakles consented to be sold into the service of the Lydian queen, and Sophocles,15 referring to his stay in Lydia, limits the period to a year; otherwise his account agrees in general with that of Apollodorus. Let us follow the account of the latter: just prior to the murder of Iphitus, it should be noted, Herakles had returned from the palace of Ad- metus, whose queen he had restored from Hades. Although he was purified at Amyclae, he found himself burdened with a disease which occasioned the journey to Delphi. There fol- lowed the struggle with Apollo over the tripod, the hurled thunderbolt of Zeus, and an oracle ordering him to be sold and to serve in Lydia for three years, the compensation to be paid to Eurytus. Hermes then sold Herakles to the queen of Lydia, but Eurytus refused the com- pensation. While at the court of Omphale he subdued the Kerkopes and Syleus, buried the body of Icarus, and took part both in the voy- age of the Argonauts and the Calydonian boar hunt. Without any reference to a marriage with Omphale he left Lydia, at the end of his servitude, for an attack on Ilium. Diodorus differs from this account in the following de- tails: the purchase price was paid to the sons of Eurytus; in addition to overcoming the Ker- kopes and Syleus, he destroyed the city of the Itoni; Herakles married Omphale by whom he had a son Lamus, after having had a son by a slave of the queen; he returned to the Pelopon- nesus whence he made war on Ilium; nothing is said about the struggle with Apollo over the tripod. Lucian 16 and Tertullian 17 emphasize the degradation of Herakles in the queen's serv- ice; Ovid Is and Seneca 19 definitely refer to spinning as his occupation at the court. Other references 20 have no direct bearing on the con- tent of the legend.

Wilamowitz 21 made of Herakles a great hero comparable to Faust, constantly struggling against the greatest of odds.22 His chief con- tribution lies in tracing the Herakles-Omphale episode to the Greek mainland.23 Cauer24 de- fends the Lydian origin of the myth, while K. Truempel25 supports Wilamowitz.26 Such a theory introduces the Lydian rulers as an im- portant factor in the later development of the myth. Friedlaender27 is especially concerned about removing Herakles from the Dorian tra- dition and making Rhodes the center of his mythological dissemination; he also credits Kreophylos of Samos with the form of the Omphale episode as we know it.28 His whole treatment suffers from an overemphasis on the literary development of the subject which is, in a sense, made up of conscious afterthoughts on a theme first moulded by religion. B. Schweit- zer 29 has composed an elaborate and highly suggestive theory relating the exploits of Hera- kles to those of heroes in Indian and Germanic lore, a courageous attempt to arrive at the original core of labors; it suffers, however, from too much dependence on a vase fragment.30 Mention should also be made of a proposed solution to the family relationships, human and divine, by A. B. Cook.3' Here the hero be- comes a convenient tool for a readjustment of family relationships when the religion of the Greek peninsula passed from matriarchy to the rule of the Olympian family headed by father Zeus: to effect a fair compromise Zeus gave up his wife Dione, the later Hebe, in favor of Hera, a former divinity of the earth, while Hebe is subsequently handed over to Herakles.32 Such an arrangement implies that it was as easy for Zeus and Herakles to cross the gap between two religions as for Hortensius to borrow the wife of Cato and, what is still more important, it takes for granted that the same family organiza- tion held good for matriarchy as for the Olym- pic pantheon. It fails to explain why Hera's wrath is a serious obstacle to Herakles on cer- tain occasions and is conspicuously absent on others;33 it fails to explain how the dauntless hero, who on the one hand served as a model of courage for the Greeks was transformed, on the other hand, into a weak, gluttonous, promiscu- ous Herakles who dons a veil and gives over his club and lion-skin to a queen; it confuses the divine and human birth of Herakles as well as the worship accorded to him, now as a god and again as a hero. What evidence can be found for a husband-wife connection between Hera and Herakles before the coming of Zeus? The fact that Herakles is evidently defending her in the gigantomachy throws no definite light either on their early association or their eventual rec- onciliation. We must admit Cook is on the right road, but this theory, as it stands, has only tended to increase the confusion surround- 21 Herakles (Berlin 1889) Vol. I, p. 286. 22 Most scholars now agree with Nilsson who places the hero and most of his labors in Mycenaean times; cf. his The Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology (Cam- bridge 1932) p. 217 et seq. Nilsson advocates the theory that the Mycenaeans were immigrant Greeks who in- herited the cultural advances of Minoan civilization. P. Friedlaender, Herakles (Berlin 1907) p. 139, also men- tions that there are few cults of Herakles in Sparta. L. R.

It is difficult to understand how so many mainland traditions can be so easily uprooted and trans- ferred; especially is this true of the struggle between Herakles and Apollo for the Delphic tripod. 29 Herakles (Tuebingen 1922). 30 Cf.

SUHR [AJA 57 ing the more knotty phases of the problem; Herakles the hero must also be reckoned with to reach a satisfactory solution. Although Herakles has always been classed among the heroes of mythology, he occupies such a unique position in this classification that the ancients sometimes referred to him as a god, sometimes as a hero. Farnell 34 believes he was first worshipped as a man, then later as a god.S5 Pausanias 36 tells us a Cretan named Phaistos first persuaded the men of Sicyon to worship Herakles as a god. Whatever the people of any locality may have thought of his original identity, in whatever capacity he was wor- shipped, it appears that the ancient world had settled on no common denominator for his true status. The divine and heroic elements (the strictly human element was negligible) in his make-up were so confused that a tragic writer like Euripides had his difficulties when trying to mould Herakles into a tragic character.37 Though Sophocles, by avoiding his apotheosis, limited Herakles to the heroic level, he pre- sents him as anything but a noble and tragic character.38 Beloch .9 and Meyer 40 call Hera- kles an old Boeotian god; Wilamowitz4 be- lieves neither his name nor the content of his legend have much to do with the original man whoever he may have been; Friedlaender 42 is certain he could not have been a god any more than Perseus and dismisses his divine associa- tions as secondary. If Herakles was first and foremost a hero, why do we not hear of his grave in various localities? Friedlaender 43 avoids the issue by simply suggesting there may have been a grave of Herakles in Tiryns, but because the city faded in importance at an early date, people forgot about it. Harrison first says he was of ancient Pelasgian stock,44 then speaks of him as a demon of fertility 45 which seems to lend more support to the divinity than to the hero. Carl Robert 46 says he was reckoned as a divinity because he was present at the birth of Athena and was a prominent fighter with the gods against the giants. Schweitzer,47 although he classifies him with Indra, Thor, Rama, Sieg- fried, and others, claims he became a man, once he lost all association with magic and the super- natural. Nilsson 48 attaches little significance to his origin, suggesting he may be a fictitious character; his divinity, he writes,49 is perhaps post-Homeric. H. J. Rose 50 rejects his divinity because his name is compounded with that of Hera; hence he was probably a real man of Tiryns. As varied and speculative as these opinions are, it is obvious that Herakles, as the Greeks knew him, possessed both divine and heroic elements in the pattern of his life, but certainly he had not always been such an unconvincing compound - such a hybrid could not be granted an indisputable position among the Olympians. Certainly he was not always a god and a hero at the same time, and Willamowitz 5x is talking in riddles when he claims Herakles was a man who suffered like a man but was also a god. At some point in his history the hero paled before the godhead or the god lost his trophies to the hero, the latter carrying with him the trappings of divine majesty, and since the two elements cannot be reconciled in the same being, there must have been two Herakles in ancient religious tradition. In the light of so many conflicting opinions on the part of scholars and so much conflicting evidence in ancient times, the above conclusion is the most 34 Op. cit. pp. 98-99. 35 At the same time (p. 95) he refers to him as the great hero of the Greeks. 86 2.10.1. 37 Cf.

In the clash of two conflicting religious traditions in the early his- tory of an invading people it seems unlikely that a hero would be raised to the level of a divinity; on the other hand, a deity might be submerged or suffer an eclipse to make room for a compromise, instances of which are well attested in early Greek religion.52 Let us see how such a hypothesis can be supported by the available evidence. Homer,53 to be sure, does not pointedly dis- tinguish between the hero and the god but calls the shade of the hero a phantom of the god, already wed to Hebe on Olympus; the real Herakles is divine. Earlier, in the Iliad,54 Hera- kles is called the son of Alcmena, and once 55 he is even the son Amphitryon.56 Hesiod 57 calls him the son of Zeus and Alcmena but wed to Hebe on Olympus where he lives unaging and without care. Herodotus 58 asserts that those Greeks do right who sacrifice to Herakles as an immortal and to Herakles as a dead hero; Diodorus, in one passage,59 speaks of three ver- sions of Herakles, one the Egyptian, the second a Cretan Dactyl, the third the son of Zeus and Alcmena; in another passage 60 he definitely says there are two Herakles, both fathered by Zeus, one of whom is the son of Alcmena.61 Strabo 62 knows of a Herakles who was one of the Idaean Dactyls, not the son of Zeus and Alcmena, and Arrian 63 mentions three, the Theban, the Tyrian, and the Egyptian Herakles; Pausanias 64 also seems to be aware of more than one but writes of them confusedly. The Marathonians 65 report they were the first to regard Herakles as a god. Whether Herakles the hero was prior to or later than Herakles the god 66 cannot be settled on the authority of classical writers who are none too certain of their claims nor can it be concluded, as we have already pointed out, that the god was a casual afterthought on the heels of heroic achievement. The two versions may just as well have developed contemporane- ously in the early history of two different peoples, in other words, they represent two different beings under the same name, although one may very well have lost his name to the other to make a compromise more effective. Parke 67 thinks that Herakles, originally a god worshipped by the Boeotians, set out to rival Apollo and thus brought about a dispute over the tripod. Why not just as well call Apollo the invader who had trouble in usurping the rights of Ge and Herakles? Throughout the passages of ancient literature, along with the doubts in the minds of the writers, there lurks a suspicion, if not a question, about the unity of the traditional Herakles.68 There are three distinctive features about the career of Herakles which separate him from the classification of Greek heroes: first, he con- tends on an equal level with divinity without suffering the consequences which befall a normal hero; secondly, after committing an outrageous crime sufficient to condemn a hero to a disastrous end, he seeks and obtains abso. lution by performing labors, even a menial task; heroes are not forgiven as easily as gods, 52 E.g. Apollo and Hyakinthos. See A. W. Persson, The Religion of Greece in Prehistoric Times (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1942) p. 137; M. Nilsson, Minoan- Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion (London 1927) p. 485. The latter implies the possibility of such a degradation of Herakles (547). 53 Odys. XI, 601. 54 XIV, 323; XIX, 99. 55 V, 392. 56 Nilsson, Mycen. Or. of Gr. Myth. p. 201, adds that Homer also echoes the lawless Herakles before moral restraint was laid upon him. In the light of Homer's statement in the Odyssey, however, it is hard to under- stand why Nilsson calls the divinity of Herakles post- Homeric. 57 Theog. 949-55. 58 II, 44. 59 III, 73. 60 V, 76. 61 This one emulated the deeds of the other and thus, in the end, both achieved immortality. 62 8, 3, 30. 63 Anab.

The ancient writers evidently were confused about the origin of Herakles, but the mention of so many foreign versions points to an awareness of the foreign divine element in his make-up. 67 A History of the Delphic Oracle (Oxford 1939) p. 349. 68 The references to foreign versions of Herakles may be regarded as products of the impact of eastern religions on the Greek newcomers.</page><page sequence="6">256 ELMER G. SUHR [AJA 57 nor do heroes such as Jason and Perseus under- take labors in recompense for an act of dis- grace. Thirdly, he joins the circle of the Olym- pians after his sojourn on earth. Lord Raglan 69 compares Herakles with the heroes of other lands, with whom he has much in common, but he glosses over his divinity which raises him above a Siegfried and beyond an Ajax, a Per- seus, or a Jason. His divinity, too, prevents him from becoming a suitable subject for trag- edy and grants him the privilege, along with Dionysus, of mounting the comic stage. Al- though one can sympathize when he suffers, one still feels that on numerous occasions he, like Zeus, gets away free, while a number of inno- cents must pay for his crimes. A hero, despite his ambitions and desires which frequently go beyond their bounds, is still subject to mortal limitations and so commands human respect when he falls; a god, if he comes too near man's level, can reap the ridicule of man because he takes unlimited privileges without accepting the responsibilities ensuing from his actions. Can we distinguish between Herakles the hero and Herakles the god on these terms? In both aspects he appears with the same attributes, the same weapons, which forces us to base our conclusions on his actions or the company he keeps.70 Herakles fought with Ares, Hades,"7 and Apollo, struggles which single him out as a divinity opposing divinity. It may be asserted by way of objection that Diomede wounded Aphrodite and opposed Ares successfully on the Trojan plain. Here, however, the situation is much different: it is Athena who urges Diomede to attack Aphrodite 72 and who rides along in the chariot against Ares,73 all of which makes them duels between divinities while Diomede serves only as a disguise or a means to an end. If we look at the sculptured pediments in Delphi,74 we find Athena standing in the center, between the antagonists, holding each one by the wrist; here she is decidedly a restraining influence which Herakles, in his impatience, is loath to obey. As a god he has entered into this struggle on his own, and, with a firm hold on his tripod, he seems to have the best of the duel. The same impression is given by the vase painter;75 one example 76 presents him alone with his prize as if exulting over his victory.77 What significance can we attach to this conflict which called forth the intervention of Zeus himself? 78 Regardless of its historical associations a conflict between two such prom- inent figures must also reflect a violent religious struggle, one which can only be explained by the invasion of a new god into the province of an old established divinity. Why should Apollo, who was capable of conquering an old god and of burying him beneath his sanctuary at Amy- clae,79 have any trouble coping with Herakles, if he was no more than a hero? This legend, which is an old one in art, was no doubt seized upon by Kreophylos of Samos and used to advantage as a prelude to the Omphale episode; both legends reflect events in the career of Herakles the god. I can only regard the thesis of Farnell as inconsistent when he 80 realizes how exceptionally Herakles stands out in the rank of heroes but goes on to regard his pre- eminent traits, including his deification, as late accretions; moreover, he has not included (pp. 98-9) all the statements of Arrian and Diodorus, two of the ancient authors who, he asserts, were "unanimous" in claiming Herakles was first a 69 The Hero (London 1936) pp. 178 ff. 70 Perhaps this is what Miss Harrison, Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens (London 1890) p. 137, means when she says: "It is remarkable that Herakles on Athenian vase-painting - e.g. at the birth of Athena --appears among the Olympian gods; elsewhere he is a mere hero." 71 Nilsson, The Mycen. Origin of Gr. Myth. pp. 203-4, has an interesting theory about this encounter, but why should he be so certain that Homer thought of Herakles only as a mortal? 72 Iliad V, 133. 78 Iliad V, 856 ff. 74 F.

The struggles with Ares and Hades are likewise beyond the capacities of the Greek hero. Heroes like Ajax must pay the full measure of punishment when they offend one of the Olympians, but gods are treated much more leniently; they are lowered in dignity by being forced to serve man in a servile capacity - for a limited period. After killing the Cyclops, Apollo had to submit to service under Ad- metus;8' Zeus first thought of hurling him down into Tartarus, but his mother Latona inter- ceded for him, whereupon he was sent to serve as a shepherd for one year. After the revolu- tionary behavior of Poseidon and Apollo toward Zeus, the two divinities were ordered to build the walls of Troy for Laomedon.8" On two occasions Herakles committed a flagrant crime which called for strong retribution: first, after the murder of his children, and later, following the wanton murder of Iphitus. The first crime, because the deed was inspired by Hera and be- cause the punishment raised rather than low- ered his prestige in the estimation of men, belongs more to the heroic Herakles, but the latter incident, which I have reason to believe is much earlier in his career as we know it, brought him to the court of Omphale and even- tually, because of a misinterpretation, made him the laughing stock of the Greek world. The burning of Herakles on the pyre, while it was borrowed from a custom of the East,s8 is a factor which sets him apart from the classifica- tion of heroes. It is the one post-Homeric epi- sode in his career which may have been added b)y Pherekydes 84 or Kreophylos of Samos."8 We know that a number of divinities, e.g. in Tyre, in Cilicia, and in Lydia were burned 86 in effigy or by human substitutes, and we must remember they were divinities, not heroes. Regardless of whether the Eastern divinities were assimilated with Herakles through the agency of sailors and traders from the Orient or by Greek colonists in the East,87 we observe that the god Zeus, as well as Herakles, was compromised in such borderline worship at various points in the Mediterranean area, but heroes, as heroes, re- ceived no such consideration; Perseus also en- joyed connections with the East without being elevated to the level of divinity. Because of the original association of the god Herakles with the Earth Mother he had a stronger bond with the East than a heroic Herakles, famed for his wanderings, his exploits characteristic of so many heroes. This divine Herakles was also made the ancestor of the Lydian kings, a fact which explains why Croesus was reputed to have been burned on a pyre.8" This is no attempt, as we have already said, to unravel the maze of Herakles' career or to analyze all the episodes of his mythology; a dis- tinction, however, between the hero and the divinity avoids many of the contradictory phases of his history, e.g. the wrath of Hera which crops up very obviously at certain points only to turn about face at another point. Why should Zeus and Herakles be so closely attached to one another as a father who takes pride in his son's achievements and on another occasion threatens him with a thunderbolt while the latter is greedily devouring fruit? 89 Why does Hera persecute him already as a babe by dis- patching serpents to strangle him and place all sorts of obstacles in his pathway as he carries out certain labors, then be only too glad of his protection in the battle against the giants? 90 Farnell 91 claims the very name of Heracles, "the glory of Hera," is enough to disparage the question of the hatred of the goddess, but this is merely an awkward way of evading the issue; 81 Apollodorus III, 10, 4. 82 Iliad I, 399 ff. and Schol. on Iliad XXI, 444; also Lucian, de Sacrificiis 4. 3s Cf.

SUHR [AJA 57 the hatred of Hera is as genuine in this legend as the name of Herakles, genuine enough to make the relationship between the two para- doxical unless we distinguish between the hero and the god. Wilamowitz 92 explains her hatred as the natural effect of the Dorian invasion; the invading worshippers of Herakles aroused the resentment of the native devotees of Hera;93 but now we know that Herakles was not a Dorian hero. The enmity of the goddess can- not be accounted for satisfactorily unless we make a distinction between the laboring hero and the god surviving from pre-Hellenic times. When Hera became the wife of Zeus and queen of Heaven as well as the goddess of marriage, she was regarded as the guardian of the Greek family, and any extra-marital relationship of Zeus with another woman, as was the case with any other such deviation of Zeus, naturally called forth her enmity.94 She had no way of punishing her husband (except indirectly), but she did vent her feelings on lo, Semele, Danaei, and their offspring. Herakles the hero, driven mad and persecuted in so many of his under- takings, belongs in this category. On the other hand, Hera makes no objection to his struggle with Apollo over the tripod, in no way inter- feres with his conquest of death,95 and allows him to defend her against the giants, all epi- sodes involving a survival of the divine Hera- kles. To represent this Herakles as the hen- pecked husband of the old earth goddess96 is a biased construction fostered by the Greek's preference for a divine family whose overlord was the father; this view also contributed much to the development of Herakles as a comic character. The name of Herakles has also been a stum- bling block to a classification of his dubious identity. There is little doubt that Hera and Herakles were closely associated 97 and that his name is derived from that of the goddess, but why should one once known as the "glory of Hera" become her bitter enemy? On the island of St. Sebastian-near Cadiz a8 and on the islands of Peragil and Paloma 99 Hera and Herakles were associated in cult.x00 Most authorities agree that the name of Herakles means "the glory of Hera" but hardly anyone is able to reconcile this interpretation with the hero Herakles who earns the enmity of the goddess. Farnell,1?1 in particular, strains himself to the utmost to explain away the stepmother's wrath in favor of the concord reflected in his name and to persuade us that the humanity of Hera- kles is primary, his divinity secondary. Of course, no "Greek husband was ever named 'the glory of his wife'," but how can we be so sure he was originally thought of as a Greek hus- band? Paul Kretschmer'02 has made the most sensible interpretation of the name: Hera and Herakles definitely belong together, the name meaning not "Hera's glory," but "glory ac- quired through Hera." 103 All this tension at the seams by Farnell and others would be un- necessary if we assume the divinity of one Herakles, the heroic character of the other, which means that Herakles, as a god, never received such an auspicious name only to earn the hatred of the goddess when he failed, in some later transformation or episode, to meas- ure up to her standards of respect. It is incon- ceivable how one can flout the authority of the ancients to the extent of denying either the wrath of Hera or the name of Herakles; one is as genuine and real as the other, only contra- dictory when we try to explain away the di- vinity or the hero in favor of the other. Let us picture an invading people coming upon a native mother goddess whom they choose, 92 P. 293. 93 We know now, as was noted above, that Herakles was not the exclusive hero of the Dorians; moreover, it is still hard to determine how much the incoming Greeks contributed to his personality. 94 Cf.

They therefore decide to call him Herakles, the glory of his female counterpart. The in- vaders incorporate Hera into their own divine family by marrying her to their sky god Zeus, thus leaving Herakles stranded without any important standing or function as a divinity. What then happens to this forsaken divinity? He merges his identity with another character, heroic in nature, because of a similarity either in name or function, a character who must have been closely associated with Zeus from the be- ginning of his career in Greece. The god in this new Herakles crops up at a number of points in his tradition, especially in his con- flicts with divinities, the punishments meted out for excesses, his contacts with death, and his own end on the pyre. I cannot pretend to have probed into the secret of Herakles' origin or the reasons for so many changes in the development of his tradi- tion;105 I do claim, however, that he is a hybrid character compounded of a pre-Hellenic con- cept of a male divinity and the Greek hero who, in spite of his valiant deeds, had no right to expect a resurrection after his death. The con- flict over the tripod in Delphi suggests the struggle of Apollo for the possession of the oracle which must have been under divine pro- tection even prior to his coming; though even- tually subdued, the god Herakles lived on, as we shall see, in another guise, while Apollo, on the surface, effected a peaceful compromise with his opponent. Another attempt to oblit- erate the god in Herakles is well explained by Nilsson 106 commenting on Iliad V, 395 ff. The god's conquest over death was changed to a campaign against the Pylians,107 because a hero, born into a world of limitations, must eventu- ally have succumbed to death.08s The varia- tions on this theme, i.e. the struggle with Cerberus and the journey to the gardens of the Hesperides, became two of the twelve heroic labors. The burning on the pyre, at one time the destruction of the god of the old year des- tined to be reborn in the spring, became the apotheosis of a hero snatched from the flames to a permanent home on Olympus. The figure of Omphale became very popular in Hellenistic and Roman times, and here again we have an old character going back to pre- Hellenic times, one who lost her identity for centuries before she suddenly appeared in a new setting. The name is not mentioned by Herodotus,109 who says the kings of Lydia were Herakleids, tracing their ancestry to Herakles and a slave girl, the daughter of lardanus. By the time of Apollodorus, Omphale, as we have seen, was substituted for the slave girl; this version of the story was undoubtedly woven to- gether by Kreophylos of Samos in honor of Croesus. Where did the poet find such a figure suitable to his purpose? The connection be- tween a male and a female divinity, the latter assuming a predominant role, is an old theme in mythology and religion, one which held its ground in Asia Minor even after the triumph of Zeus on the mainland; the exchange of gar- ments, equally as old, survived in certain cults and customs; the motive of spinning is a new one in legend and was probably added for local color, although it, too, may have early ante- cedents. The name of Omphale, because of its re- semblance to the omphalos, has been a tantaliz- ing puzzle for the etymologist.110 No connection between the two has been established, difficult as it is to believe there was no association be- tween them in early religion. The problem is so much the more complicated because we know so little about the omphalos which crops up in 104 There is no reason under the sun why Hera, in spite of her name, should be considered a Greek impor- tation, as Farnell (p. 105) wishes to believe.

SUHR [AJA 57 so many localities and preserves so many asso- ciations with pre-Hellenic divinities.'1' From all that has been written and conjectured on the subject it appears sensible to think of the omphalos as marking the site where the sky god had fertilized mother earth with his bolt of lightning, only later, with the coming of the Greeks, taking on the new meaning of a burial mound, because newcomers have a way of burying the god of the conquered beneath the altar or shrine of their own divinity. Whether we rely on Omphale's connection with the omphalos or discard it, Omphale carries too many trappings of early religion to be put down as a new creation in a poet's mind. The paint- ing in Naples112 calls attention to both the exchange of garments and the figure of Priapus, an old bisexual god of vegetation, suggesting a former connection with fertility rites. We have already pointed out the divine features in the career of Herakles, to which Parke 11 lends added support by tracing his divine origin to Boeotia, not far from Delphi, to account for his conflict with Apollo over the right to dispense oracles. It may very well be that Herakles was, at this time, associated with a goddess who was lost sight of after the coming of Apollo, in which case Herakles was fighting for the rights of the goddess as well as for his own. However, even if there had been such a divinity at home here, she could be only one of the possible sources for the later Omphale. It is generally recognized that a mother god- dess was the dominant divinity in the eastern Mediterranean world before the coming of the Greeks and that she assumed a different form in different localities. With her was usually associated a male god in a subordinate role, and again the relation between the two divini- ties varies from one locality to another. Among the Minoans there was apparently a definitely female divinity and another definitely male, both, according to Nilsson,'14 derived from nature demons (p. 382), although there are those who claim the images of the snake-goddess and others represent, not the divinities, but their worshippers.115 In Asia Minor Cybele was a divinity of earth, water, light, and life, while her male counterpart, Attis, the god of transitory vegetable life, was regarded at times as a son, at times as the husband of the god- dess.116 Among the number of later divinities derived from the mother goddess, Hera is an outstanding example.117 Did this divinity, as an earth goddess, carry over into her relation to Zeus any trace of a former connection with a male divinity? In cult and in art objects we find representations of the marriage of Zeus and Hera, the former wearing a veil, a feature which can only be regarded as a survival of pre- Hellenic times.118 And what was the nature of this sacred marriage so widespread in early religion? This sacred rite, going back to primitive times, in which the Earth Mother and the fer- tilizing agent were united in what we may call a symbolic marriage,'19 was designed to encour- age the coming of spring and the fertilization of the soil. This relationship of marriage be- tween the two seasonal phenomena, which do not become clear until they are embodied in anthropomorphic concepts, is a later construc- tion and so has a direct bearing on our thesis. These two beings were definitely divinities who left their traces in Greek religion; even Far- nell 120 admits that the "hero-god" Herakles is 111 The latest discussion of the subject is that of E. Baldwin Smith, The Dome (Princeton 1950) pp. 75-79. Here one may also find the important references for the subject. See also Jane Harrison, Thenzis pp. 397 ff., W.

One of its prototypes he finds in the marriage of the sun and moon on Crete, Zeus I, pp. 522-3. Although the marriage of Zeus and Hera may be a late development, which is Cook's main thesis, he does not claim that this particular type of marriage was introduced with the coming of Zeus. 119 Again we must guard against intruding our family concept into a primitive tradition. 120 Gr.

Traces of his sacred marriage and the divinities thus united can be followed through Greek religion back to pre-Hellenic times;121 even Zeus, as we have seen, had to submit to such a compromise. There is sound evidence for the institution of a sacred marriage on the island of Cos in which the priest, in imitation of Herakles, dressed himself in female gar- ments.122 Farnell 123 suggests Hebe as the other party in the marriage. The very fact that Herakles is associated with a sacred marriage adds additional weight to his divinity which may be as old as the rite itself which, in turn, has roots in the ancient Orient.124 A. de Ridder 125 published a bronze relief, of Chalcid- ian origin, but found on the Acropolis of Athens, which he interpreted as an apotheosis of Herakles. A later and happier afterthought on the part of the same authority 126 labels it Herakles and Omphale united in a sacred mar- riage; the relief is dated somewhere before 550 B.c. The identification of Herakles, because of the general resemblance of the relief to the Omphale painting in Naples already referred to, is fairly certain, but to call the bride Omphale is unwarranted; nor can we be sure that Omphale was the original bride in the ritual of the Coans.127 In view of the large number of variations on the earth goddess, Omphale is only one possibility among many others to fill the role of bride at Cos.128 With the evidence at our disposal it is difficult to trace her original shrine either to Lydia or the Greek mainland, but we may safely say she was .a derivative of the old pre-Hellenic earth god- dess associated, in fertility rites, with a male divinity who may very well have been Hera- kles.129 In the legend as it has come down to us we are told that Herakles was compelled to wear female garments, while Omphale wore his lion- skin and carried his club, a feature undoubtedly derived from the exchange of garments in the sacred marriage. The custom is common to many primitive peoples, as Frazers30 testifies, in most instances at the time of marriage or the marking of some crucial stage in life. Cook 131 refers to a festival at Argos, to another in honor of Hera at Samos, a wedding night custom at Sparta, and the above mentioned Coan festival where such an exchange of gar- ments was part of the ceremony. Such a rite de passage was practiced at crucial periods of life, i.e. marriage of individuals and during festivals by large groups.132 The same practice spread to the worshippers in the rites of Cybele, in which case the Gallus emasculated himself, donned feminine dress, and let his hair grow long.133 Prickartz 134 asserts that, although Hera is no- where mentioned, the exchange of garments at the Coan festival derives from the association of Herakles with Hera, the goddess of marriage. One must beware of confusing such a use of garments with the weakening effect exerted by those sent by Deianira to Herakles and by Medea to the bride of Jason. Instead of ener- vating the wearer,135 the purpose was apotro- paic, designed to ward off any damaging influ- ence of evil spirits, first at the time of sowing and subsequently extended to the critical peri- ods of life when man was considered most vul- nerable. Ovid 136 refers to an episode occurring at the time of the sacred marriage of Herakles and Omphale: Faunus, having fallen in love with the Lydian queen, attempts to ascend her 121 A. Klinz, Hieros Gamos (Halle 1933) pp. 13 ff. gives a list of divinities involved in such rites. 122 Plutarch, Quaest. Gr. 58, ed. W. R.

SUHR (AJA 57 couch after nightfall, but, deceived by the ex- change in garments, finds himself on a couch next to Herakles. When the lights are kindled, Faunus is discovered sprawling on the ground, the subject of ridicule. The fact that Herakles was clad in female garments thwarted the mis- chievous designs of the harmful intruder which is the primary purpose of the ruse practiced at the sacred marriage. The garment of Omphale has in no way weakened her consort who handles the interfering Faunus with ease; fur- thermore, he performs a number of labors in the service of the Lydian queen, labors which were probably transferred by the poet from the Greek mainland; these labors would not have been inserted at this point by the poet had he wished to convey the impression of weakness in Herakles. The effeminate features of the face of Herakles when associated with Omphale in the Roman period of art were inspired by the comic poets and the prevailing misinterpreta- tion of the whole episode. The spinning motive seems to have its origin in Lydia where women excelled in this and the related arts; Ovid 137 refers to Arachne as a Lydian. Spinning, generally regarded as a woman's occupation, was handed over to the male Herakles in this case to strengthen the magical effect expected from the exchange of garments. It was meant to add what Pliny 138 called "auctoritatem religiosam." The best ex- amples in sculpture showing Herakles with the distaff and spindle include the group of Hera- kles and Omphale in the Naples museum 139 (pl. 73, fig. 1), and a small bronze in The Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore.140 (pl. 74, fig. 2). The latter, while its authenticity is questionable, presents the solitary Herakles in the act of spinning and is the most interesting illustra- tion of the art in ancient sculpture or painting. In summary, the association of Herakles with Omphale goes back to a much more serious union of pre-Hellenic religion, a union of the male fertilizing agent and the female repro- ductive power of Mother Earth. Along with the fact that the legend furnishes us with the best evidence for the sacred marriage, it has the longest continuity of any example of this sacred rite; it can also afford us, for the above reason, with interesting information about the develop- ment of a myth. The evidence for the divinity of Herakles seeps through his later career among the Greeks: he struggles with and holds his own against other divinities, he obtains absolution by submitting to some form of degrading bond- age, and finally he is snatched from the pyre to join the circle of Olympians. He is also a hero soliciting human sympathy by undertaking tasks and overcoming great obstacles in spite of the oppressive hatred of Hera. Some time after the coming of the Greeks the divinity is com- promised with a hero, more than likely an im- portation of the invaders, who lost his name to the god; such a compromise can best explain the meaning of his name and the puzzling hatred of Hera. The center of this movement was no doubt Thebes where the story of Alc- mena's conception and the birth of her two sons reveals the most obvious patchwork.141 It is a decided mistake to disparage one side of Herakles in favor of the other, and it is assum- ing too much to claim, as Farnell and Kret- schmer do, that the hero antedates the divinity. Omphale is probably an old version of an earth goddess playing a role similar to that of Hera in pre-Hellenic religion, one who survived the clash between two religious traditions and the union of Hera with Zeus. Her participation in a sacred marriage with the divine Herakles andti the exchange of garments make this episode one of the oldest in Greek tradition. The god Herakles forfeited much of his pre- rogative as a sky divinity to Zeus, a fact which made his compromise with the hero easier and explains the close identification of Herakles with Zeus among the peoples of the East 142 who still remembered the original status of the di- vine Herakles and were loath to allow Zeus to 137 Met.

As a divinity Herakles was not limited as he was in the role of a hero; his acts, i.e. his gluttony in the A lcestis, the be- getting of fifty sons by the daughters of Thespis, the devouring of the oxen of the ploughman, were all regarded as excesses by the Greeks and made objects of ridicule by the comic poets.143 The meaning of these acts is still obscure, but we can discern the serious significance beneath the comic covering of the Omphale episode which certainly belongs to the career of the divine Herakles. We can also assume that the fifth century Athenians in general and their vase painters and sculptors in particular cher- ished a much higher respect for the hero in Herakles than for his divinity. Among the late Greeks and the Romans the comic interpreta- tion of the episode is emphatically stressed: Herakles becomes an effeminate sot completely charmed and enslaved by a fickle coquette, but the trappings of the old religious rite are faith- fully preserved. The Renaissance and the ro- mantic era carried on with the tale of a seductive siren in the scultpure of Blanchard and the music of Saint-Sains' distorted version of the legend.
