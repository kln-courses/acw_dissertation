<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH SUMMARIES ON THE 'SECULARITY' AND 'CONTRARINESS' OF THE BOOK OF ESTHER by Nisan Ararat Ancient and modern interpreters of the Book of Esther have attempted to solve the riddle presented by the composition of this work as a secular literary creation both in form and in content. Even more puzzling has been the inclusion of a book that does not contain the name of God in the Biblical Canon. An examination of the literary structure of Esther, composed intentionally tout au contraire and in a special chiastic structure,, reveals the writer's secret: faithful to the Biblical concept of the world, he polemicizes in this special work against 'fate' and against the esteem in which the 'shrewd' sage is held. The absence of the name of God from the Book of Esther expresses a negative attitude towards the shrewd deeds of the central characters (Mordecai and Esther, no less than Haman) who by committing them demonstrate a lack of faith in the unseen guidance of Divine Providence — that 'Superior Wisdom' beyond human understanding. 'THE STRIP OF SCARLET-DYED WOOL' IN THE DAY OF ATONEMENT TEMPLE RITUAL by Naftali Goldstein A Study of the development of the custom of binding the head of the scapegoat with the tongue-shaped strip of scarlet-dyed wool (לשון של זהורית) as part of the ritual for the Day of Atonement focuses attention on one of the tendencies of the Sages in moulding the character of Temple worship. The strip of scarlet-dyed wool tied to the head of the goat whose lot dictated that he be sent to Azazel (Yoma 4:2), should be understood as an ordinary act of 'designation' (c/. Gen. 38:28), designed to avoid interchanging of the scapegoat with the goat designated for slaughter at the altar. However, popular belief, at a very early period, related this act to the passage: 'Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow' (Is. 1:18), and so great expectations were raised for a heavenly sign indicating the forgiveness of sins.</page><page sequence="2">II ENGLISH SUMMARIES It is important to note that the 'whitening of the scarlet-dyed strip of wool' is not mentioned in the early arrangement of mishnayyot forming Tractate Yoma, and all references to it in this tractate are actually 'extraneous' mishnayyot. An additional mention is found in Shabbat 9:3 in one of a series of dicta based on the principles of exegesis composed during the period of R. Akiva. The Mishna states that upon reaching the precipice, the person who had lead the scapegoat into the desert, parted the strip of scarlet-dyed wool into two pieces 'half of it he tied to the rock, and the other half he tied between its two horns' (Yoma 6:6). (These details are also mentioned in the Epistle of Barnabas vii:8). However, the reason for this practice is not revealed by the Mishna. The evolution and the changes which took place in the usage of the scarlet-dyed strip of wool are related in two talmudic baraytot (TB Yoma 67a; TP ibid., 6:5, 43d). From these sources, it is evident that this custom derived from popular folklore; the populace also used to hang strips of scarlet from their windows, and expectingly awaited their turning white. The expectation for an 'omen' during the offering of sacrifices, was most widespread in ancient civilization, especially in Greece and Rome. In Judaism, this phenomenon is much rarer. On the Day of Atonement, there was serious concern that the lot of the goat meant for sacrifice would be drawn by the High Priest with his right hand (TB Yoma 40b), and significant meaning was also attached to the form of the smoke as it arose arter the sacrifice of the incense in the Holy of Holies (Tanhuma Te$awe 15). The popular custom of the scarlet 'omen' was a cause of concern and uncomfort for the Rabbis, and special rules were enacted,, stage after stage, in order to conceal it from the populace ('They ordained that it should be tied in the Temple... outside... inside..., that one half should be tied to the rock and one half between the horns of the scapegoat'). As a result, this custom, whose wide practice had aroused extreme tension among the masses, was transferred into a clandestine ceremony in the middle of the Judean Desert, far from the eyes of the masses. The editors of the Mishna also avoided mentioning the magnificent 'omen' of the scarlet-dyed strip of wool in the official program of the ritual for the Day of Atonement in Tractate Yoma. The Sage who was responsible for these significant changes at the end of the Second Temple Period was (according to the fourth generation Amora, Rav Nahman b. Isaac), Rabban Yohanan b. Zakkai (TB R.H. 31b). This identification is most logical in the light of the latters' views and activities and tendency to introduce changes into other ritual practices of a similar ceremonious nature: the red heifer, the 'bitter waters' and the 'breaking of the neck of the heifer'. It is apparent that extreme sensitivity towards ceremonies resembling Gentile practices, and towards those acts which encouraged the superstitious behavior of the populace, was one of the prime factors which prompted the Sages to introduce these changes.</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH SUMMARIES III SEDER •OLAM AND THE TOSEFTA by Chaim Milikowsky It is notoriously difficult to prove the dependence of one work within the rabbinic corpus upon another. The methodological pitfalls are many and not easily overcome. Within the scope of the present article, the author has endeavored to prove that the twelfth chapter of Tosefta Sota is dependent upon Seder 'Olam (henceforth: SO). Each of the six passages in this chapter of the Tosefta has a parallel in SO. Though it cannot be proven that all six are dependent upon SO, the cumulative evidence is convincing. The first passage discussed can barely be understood in the Tosefta, and its full meaning comes to light only after additional passages in SO are consulted. There is no conclusive evidence concerning the second passage; yet even here the hypothesis that the Tosefta used SO leads towards an understanding of the former. The third passage paralleled in the Tosefta and Seder 'Olam is explicable on its own. However, only by consulting an additional passage in SO can the chronological basis of its exegesis be justified. The fourth passage also contains a chronological statement, which can be understood only after it is related to the preceeding passage in SO. In the fifth passage, only small sections of the Tosefta and SO parallel each other; indeed the two passages deal with different themes. Though there is no evidence that SO was the source of the Tosefta, it is clear that the Tosefta passage cannot have been the original source. The sixth passage is the most interesting; though on the surface it appears that there is no relationship between the Tosefta and SO, it is argued nonetheless, that the formation of the Tosefta passage makes sense only if it could be postulated that SO served as its source. Thus, four of the six passages in Tosefta Sota XII contain indications that the passage in SO is original and the parallel passage in the Tosefta derivative. Neither of the other two passages contradict this assertion and even tend to support it. It is therefore concluded that SO was available in an edited form before the redaction of the Tosefta. CONCERNING THE PROHIBITION AGAINST GENTILE OIL by Zvi Arie Steinfeld According to Rav (Avoda Zara 35b-36a), the interdiction against Gentile Oil men tioned in the Mishna (A.Z. 2:6), was promulgated, either by Daniel, or by Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel as part of the 'eighteen prohibitions'.</page><page sequence="4">IV ENGLISH SUMMARIES Samuel's opinion, phrased in the words 'וליפתן של כלים טמאים (או: אסורין) אוסרתן' is debated by the various early commentaries to the Talmud. Some authorities claim that Samuel agrees with Rav that the interdiction is based on a gezera (= prohibition of rabbinic enactment), and his opinion is merely an explanation of the underlying reason, for this gezera. Others argue that according to Samuel, there was never any prohibition against Gentile Oil, and the source of the prohibition lies in the laws concerning mixtures. Both explanations seem somewhat forced in their interpretation of וליפתן in Samuel's statement as 'their discharge'. On the other hand, two of the early commentaries were found to contain a novel reading which sheds new light on the meaning of Samuel's dictum: 'וליפתן של גויים'. Basing himself on this variant, which is apparently the original reading, the author suggests that in the opinion of Samuel, the prohibition against Gentile oil is not due to the discharge of impure or forbidden utensils, but rather based on the suspicion that Gentiles had sprinkled wine or vinegar on the olives prior to their entrance into the olive press. This suspicion is also the basis for the interdiction forbidding the receiving of benefit from stripped olives as stipulated in the Tosephta: 'It is forbidden to eat stripped olives sold at the entrance to baths, but benefit may be received from them. R. Jose forbade all benefit from them since they (= the Gentiles) sprinkle them with vinegar in order to facilitate the removal of their pits' (Tos. A.Z. 4(5) :8, ed. Zuckermandel, p. 466). According to the opinion of Rav, the prohibition against Gentile oil was all-inclusive, and applied even in those cases where no suspicion of the oil having been mixed with forbidden matter existed. However, in the opinion of Samuel, Gentile oil was not automatically prohibited per se. Samuel apparently, ruled that the prohibition was limited to certain specific instances, viz. only oil which was suspected to contain forbidden discharge was out lawed. It is therefore evident that Samuel placed the prohibition against Gentile oil on an equal footing with the other prohibitions mentioned in A.Z. 2:6. The explana tions of Samuel provides an additional halakhic basis for the dispensation of R. Judah Nesi'ah and his court who ruled that Gentile oil was permitted. Samuel not only accepted this dispensation, but was also instrumental in encouraging Rav to do so. 'AS IF WITH A FINGER' — THE TEXT HISTORY OF AN EXPRESSION AVOIDING ANTHROPOMORPHISM by Harry Fox In his critical edition of Sifre Numbers, p. 59, H.S. Horovitz has suggested that the text in the printed editions, and its parallel in the Mekhilta (ed. Horovitz-Rabin, p. 6), should be emended to include the words 'as if' and thus read: 'R. Akiba says: This is one of three laws which were difficult for Moses until God pointed out (the objects</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH SUMMARIES involved) [as if] with a finger..This emendation has met with the general approval of scholars who have also attempted to furnish additional evidence and interpretation in its support since it precludes any possible hint of primitive anthropo morphic belief on the part of R. Akrba, the famous second century sage. However, a careful study of the above-mentioned sources, their parallels and citations, based on manuscripts and first printed editions, fails to corroborate the necessity for textual change. On the contrary, evidence gathered from various sources dating prior to 500-600 C.E. — the Greek, Latin and Aramaic Targum texts of the Bible, the New Testament, early Synagogue art, and, finally R. Akiba's midrashic method, as well as the exegesis of his master, R. Eliezer, and his disciple, R. Meir — all clearly demon strata the fact that the original textual reading is the lectio difficilior 'with a finger'. The words, 'as if are almost always the product of later scribal emendations caused by a desire to avoid anthropomorphisms. This feeling is similar to the one held by modern scholars who are strongly supported by the rationalistic views of the Geonic and later Medieval philosophers, especially those involved in anti-Karaitic contro versies and under Islamic influence, including Maimonides. Maimonides, however, while dealing with the topic of anthropomorphisms in the Bible, offered a solution as to how these were seen in the Targum text of Onqelos, without thereby com promising the principle of the incorporeality of God. It is proposed that Maimonides' solution for Onqelos holds true for R. Akiba and the rabbinic sources cited in this paper. Support for this solution is found in a similar commentary by Philo concerning the voice of God at Sinai. The appendix deals with redactory problems concerning the above-mentioned mid rashic texts and their parallels. During the course of this investigation,, an over-looked parallel in the Mekhilta of R. Simeon ben Yohai was discovered in a quotation in two early Karaitic tracts. This recovered text has been analyzed in relation to the above. THE BABYLONIAN YES HIV A AS REFLECTED IN BAVA QAMMA 117A by Isaiah Gafni The Babylonian Talmud (Bava Qamma 117a) presents a long and detailed version of the events surrounding Rav Kahana's flight to Palestine from Babylonia, as well as the reception he received in the Academy of R. Yohanan. This last component is particularly interesting, in that, while describing a study situation purportedly in third century Tiberias, the Talmud, in fact, projects a yeshiva framework much closer to the Babylonian academy described in later Babylonian sources, most specifically, the famous account of R. Nathan. Thus, while seven rows of scholars are situated before R. Yohanan, this number is not to be found in any Palestinian description of the academy, but, in fact, coincides with the seven rows of R. Nathan's account. The siyyuma, another well-documented Babylonian component, is also described as an</page><page sequence="6">VI ENGLISH SUMMARIES institution of R. Yohanan's academy, and together with other elements it would appear that a Babylonian Yeshiva description has been imposed upon a story originally of Palestinian setting or, at least, claiming to be of Palestinian provenance. This im position becomes obvious through a comparison of the printed talmudic version, and most of the manuscripts, with the unique variant tradition preserved in MS Hamburg, and in a Geniza fragment of the text. These last two, while closely follow ing the talmudic text, do not contain most of these obvious 'Babylonian' colorings, and appear to preserve an earlier, somewhat untouched version of the story. It would appear, therefore, that the Babylonian adaptaion of the story in its final version reflects the Babylonian yeshiva at some stage of its development. The suggestion of a date for the later Babylonian revision is, nevertheless, an unsolved problem. THE IMPURITY CUSTOMS OF THE MENSTRUATE WOMAN SOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT by Yedidya Dinary This article deals with certain separation customs relating to the impurity of the menstruate woman, according to Barayta de'Masekhet Nidda. These include: 1) The prohibition against stepping on the same ground treaded upon by a men struate woman, since the dust of the earth on which she has treaded is considered impure. 2) The prohibition against receiving benefit from the works of her hands. 3) The menstruate woman is forbidden to touch food or untensils since her contact has rendered them impure. The author traces the development of these customs in Talmudic and Rabbinic Literature and discusses such issues as: The dissemination of these customs; an exam ination of their validity according to Talmudic rulings; the possibility that these customs are based on a Karaite source; proofs attesting to their antiquity; Talmudic statements whose gist is a criticism of excessive precautionary measures of separation from the menstruate woman; the reason for the acceptance of the stringent rulings by the Babylonian Geonim; the influence of the customs on the interpretation of TB Ketubot 41a, and the attitude of Maimonides and other early Authorities (Rishonim) to them.</page><page sequence="7">ENGLISH SUMMARIES VII ABRAHAM'S VISITS TO ISHMAEL —THE JEWISH ORIGIN AND ORIENTATION by Aviva Schussman The story dealt with in this article, found in Jewish and Moslem sources of the Medieval Period, describes the two visits of Abraham to the abode of Ishmael, after the latter's expulsion from Abraham's household. On the occasion of the first visit, Abraham was granted an uncordial welcome by the wife of Ishmael, and he relayed a clever message to his son indicating to him that he divorce this woman. During his second visit, Abraham was warmly received by Ishmael's second wife. The earliest Jewish source containing this tradition is Pirqe de Rabbi EUezer (henceforth: PdRE), an aggadic work apparently dating from the eigth century. This story is also found in various Moslem sources, in different versions, the earliest dating from the ninth century. Scholars have entertained the opinion that the story of Abraham's visit to the abode of Ishmael originated in Islam and that the author of PdRE drawing upon a Moslem source, introduced several tendentious innovations into the story which reflect an anti-Islamic polemic. A detailed literary analysis of the contents and orientation of this tradition in both PdRE and the Moslem versions, leads to the conclusion that this story was written by the author of PdRE and, in spite of the polemic against Islam, should be viewed as an original Hebrew composition. Among the motifs dealt with in the course of this analysis, one may mention: the general framework of the story and its co-ordination with the necessities of the Jewish and Islamic sources; the status of Ishmael and his wives, and the status of Sarah and Hagar. Some of the details relating to Ishmael and his wives (signs of hospitality, the Arabic names of the wives; the occupations of Ishmael) have already been dealt with in scholarly research, but are herein given novel interpretations. The orientation of the story in PdRE is both apologetic and polemic. From the apolo getic standpoint, every effort is made to portray Abraham in a favorable light. He is depicted as the mercuful father, even though he was forced, by Divine instruction, to expel his son from his household. The polemical aspect of this story is designed to show that the expulsion was unpreventable since Ishmael was not worthy of succeeding Abraham. This orientation blends successfully with the general orientation of PdRE chap, xxx which is of a national and spiritual nature : emphasis of the principle that the heritage of Abraham is limited to Judaism alone. The Moslem sources introduced tendentious innovations into the text of the story. These are designed to aggrandize the image of Ishmael, to associate the story with the city of Mecca, and to strengthen the Moslem teaching concerning the close relationship between Abraham and the heritage of Islam.</page><page sequence="8">VIII ENGLISH SUMMARIES PROVIDENCE AND GOVERNANCE IN MORE HA-NEVUKHiM by Abraham Nuriel An inspection of the passages which mention Divine Providence in More Ha-Nevukhim has uncovered contradictions which are serious impediments in the proper under standing of Maimonides' view on this issue. An exact clarification of the terminology employed by Maimonides enables one to distinguish between two basic concepts: 'an'ay a (— Providence) and tadbir (= Go vernance). The term employed for 'Providence' bears several different connotations in More Ha-Nevukhim. It appears as a general expression denoting various aspects of the attitude of the Almighty to the Universe, and includes two distinct sub-headings: a) Divine Governance; b) Special Divine Providence. a) Divine Governance — The Governance of God is identified with the natural order of the Universe. His administration of the earthly world is mediated by the separate intelligences and the heavenly spheres. The Tora which coordinates the natural order of things, is part of this Divine Governance. The description of Divine Governance is embodied in the 'Thirteen Attributes.' The principles of reward and punishment appear within the realm of 'Governance'. Human activity within this realm is realized by practical wisdom. Divine Governance, reward and Punishment excepted, represents Divine Mercy. b) Divine Providence — Divine Providence is exercized over human beings only, in accordance with each individual's theoretical intellect. Within the realm of 'Providence', there is no reward and punishment. 'Providence' is either present or non-present, and its absence leads to the situation of 'Divine Wrath' (hester panim). 'Providence' represents salvation from the incidental and applies to those individuals who have attained complete communion with God, which usually takes place at an advanced age. This type of salvation from the incidental is effected during the course of communion with God, i.e. when an individual employs his theoretical intellect, and avoids using his practical intellect, which ordinarily functions in acts of physical existence. The implication of this salvation is immortality, and not, as commonly accepted, miracles which save one from the plights and pitfalls of the earthly world. THE EVIL THOUGHT OF THE DEITY by Moshe Idel In the present article the author notes the similarity between the Zurvanic tradition concerning the evil though of Zurvan, father of Ahriman, and the conception that</page><page sequence="9">ENGLISH SUMMARIES IX the domenic powers were born as a result of the evil thought of God, evident in Jewish sources^ The earliest known mention of this conception in Jewish circles appears in the writings of Agobard of Lyon. Similar concepts are also found in the qabbalistic writings of Jewish savants in Spain, dating from the second half of the thirteeth century. In the opinion of the author, it is possible that these Spanish sources represent a continuation of the tradition recorded as early as the ninth cen tury by the Jews of Lyon. This qabbalistic conception reached its prime in the qabbalistic writings of R. Issac Lurya (ARI). NEW DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THE HISTORY OF ITALIAN JEWRY UNDER THE SHADOW OF SIXTEENTH CENTURY CATHOLIC REACTION by Abraham David The spread of the Lutheran Reformation in Italy was accompanied by the gradual development of the Catholic reaction. The authorities of the Catholic Church were overcome with fear from the challenges presented by this dangerous movement, and so devised the Counter-Reformation. This latter movement represents a serious turn for the worse in the status of the Italian Jewish communities during the sixteenth century. The author has published herein, several newly-found documents which supply addi tional information concerning the plight of Italian Jewry in various localities: 1) Two new testimonies which relate the tragedies inflicted upon the Jews as a result of the Spanish conquests in Italy (1526-1527), during the reign of Carlos V, King of Spain. In addition to acts of pillage and violence against the local population, the royal garrisons utilized the opportunity to vent their wrath against the members of the Jewish communities of Codignola and Carpi, who because of their religious belief, were given the choice of baptism or death. 2) The status of the Jews in the Duchy of Milano began to waver during the reign of Phillip II, King of Spain between the years 1556-1598, as a result of the sedition of the citizens of Pavia. The latter, encouraged by the clergy, did all in their power to incite the central authorities of the Duchy against the Jews, demanding such actions as: limitation of rights; various prohibitions, and expulsion from the Duchy. There were at least three unsuccessful attempts to expel the Jews from the Duchy of Milano, and these were postponed only through the concerted efforts of the leaders of the Jewish communities. The first attempt, influenced by the Cardinal, Carlo Borromeo was made in 1566. A Hebrew document containing the text of the edict of expulsion which was sent from the King to Duke Don Gabriel de la Cueva is published herein. The Jews were finally expelled from the Duchy of Milano in 1597. 3) In 1569, all the Jews under Papal rule, save the residents of Rome and Ancona, were expelled by Pius V. Three important documents dealing with the situation of the Jews during that period have been uncovered. One of them relates the efforts of</page><page sequence="10">ENGLISH SUMMARIES intercession in order to prevent expulsion, after the spread of a rumor to that effect in Rome, prior to the official announcement itself. The second and third documents deal with the necessity to assist in the absorption of the expelled Jews by monetary gifts to those communities outside the Papal State who took an active part in the efforts to resettle the Jewish refugees in their midst. WEBER'S ANCIENT JUDAISM AND THE FORMAT OF JEWISH CIVILIZATION by Shmuel N. Eisenstadt In this paper, the author has attempted an evaluation of Max Weber's Ancient Judaism and its potential contribution to the understanding of the specific character istics of Jewish civilization and history. Weber's powerful insights concerning the structural and cultural conditions which explain, to some degree, the initial break through to monotheism and to rationalization of religious orientations and the propensity to and the combination between continuous transformations of these orientations and the concomitant institutional moulds, with continuity of collective identity have been subjected to a critical analysis. In this context, the author has laid stress on such socio-political variables as structural heterogeneity; the structure of center; the characteristic major carriers of models of cultural and political orders; the evolution of a perception of a chasm between the transcendental and the mundane orders; and the peculiar combination of this and other-wordly orientations that developed within Ancient Judaism. During the course of this discussion, Weber's analysis of the emergence of the rabbinical mould under the influence of the Jews' becoming a pariah people and developing a double morality orientation, as a deflection of the tendency to rationalization which were, according to him, inherent in the prophetic orientations, is subject to a critical evaluation. Weber failed to recognize that, within the many new in stitutional moulds that developed in this period, in general, and within the rabbinical one, in particular very specific trends toward rationalization and systematization of daily life developed which, from the point of view of institution-building, went beyond the impact of the prophetic orientation. Nor did he fully recognize that this trend had a limited impact on the economic field, but was more fully felt in the political and religious communal one, and that its major impact was on the working out of the tendencies to systematic organization of daily life in terms of religious-legal-ritual precepts; of the working out of the symbols and boundaries of collective identity; of the crystallization of a concept of higher Law, and through the accountability of rulers and the contentiousness about representation of this Law and Authority. It has been shown that the development of many moulds and tendencies to ration alization within them was then, as in the earlier periods, closely related to the elabora tion of the components of collective identity and boundaries. Hence, all of these</page><page sequence="11">ENGLISH SUMMARIES XI developments were, naturally, also greatly influenced by the unique competitive ambivalent attitude toward other civilizations which developed within the Jewish community, and by the precariousness of their international political situation. But it was not the so-called pariah status of the Jews or the elements of double morality that were inherent in this position. Rather, central from all these points of view was the ambivalent competitive attitude to other civilizations as well as the tension between the universalistic and the particularistic orientation that were inherent in this com petitive attitude. Thus, in contrast to Weber's view, the author has stressed, elaborating indeed Weber's problematique, the continuous tensions within the development of Jewish history be tween different elements of Jewish tradition, and emphasized greater heterogeneity of such elements than was presumed or fully understood by Weber. In more principled terms, this discussion points out two major weaknesses in Weber's analysis, not only of Ancient Judaism, but also of the other civilizations which he studied in this context. 1) In his analysis of institutional derivatives of the tendencies to rationalization of the religious world, Weber concentrated on the economic field (and to some degree, although in separate studies, on the field of Law), but in limited fashion to a systematic analysis of the political field — especially in the analysis of patterns of legitimation of political elites, accountability of rulers and patterns of political struggle. 2) Weber failed to combine the analysis of the institutional derivatives of tendencies of rationalization of religious orientation, with that of the construction of symbols of collective identity of the respective societies and civilizations. All these problems are not, of course, beyond the scope of Weber's problematique; indeed, as is well known, he has dealt with many of them in other parts of his work. However, Weber has not treated them within the framework of his analysis of Com parative Sociology of World Religions, and the bringing together of such analyses is one of the great challenges of his intellectual heritage. A COMMENT TO 'THE ACCEPTANCE OF SACRIFICES FROM GENTILES' (TARBIZ, XLVIII, 1979, pp. 341-345) by Yitzhak D, Gilat The writer focuses attention on the opinion of the Tanna, R; Eliezer b. Hyrcanus, who objected to the purchase of sacrifices from Gentile sources (Para 2:1), This viewpoint was adopted by R. Jose b. Halafta (Pesiqta Rabbati, ed. Ish-Shalom, 192a). It is thus evident that at least two leading rabbis of the Mishnaic Period negated the acceptance of sacrifices from the Gentiles. The conclusions of I. Knohl, viz., that 'talmudic halakha does not contain any allusion whatsoever to a prohibition on Gentile sacrifices' and that such opposition has its basis in sectarian halakha.', are thus shown to be unfounded. [See, however, the addition of the Editor.]</page><page sequence="12">XII ENGLISH SUMMARIES SOME COMMENTS CONCERNING A NEW GENRE OF THE AGGADIC NARRATIVES (TARBIZ, XLVII, 1978, pp. 139-172) by E.E. Hallewy In his article, 'Hermeneutic Problems in the Study of the Aggadic Narrative', Prof. J. Fraenkel purported to have discovered a unique genre of aggadic narratives which contain criticism of the Sages. It is shown, however, that criticism of the Sages is evident in the examples cited by Prof. Fraenkel, according to the latter's subjective interpretations only. If these narratives are explained according to their simple meaning, without reading 'in between the lines' before the lines themselves, and by avoiding strict reliance on the principles of narrative artistry in order to solve the various problems encountered in the text, it can be concluded that there is not even the slightest allusion to such a litterary genre, in the narrative tales examined by Prof. Fraenkel. Whenever the aggadic narrative reports on the misconduct of one of the Sages, it immediately adds one of the following alternatives: a) the Sage expresses regret for his actions; b) he subjects himself to physical pains as a compensation for his mis deeds; c) he is immediately subjected to Divine punishment; d) the Sage performs a positive act as an atonement for his negative one. However, these details are com pletely lacking in the narratives inspected by Prof. Fraenkel. RESPONSE by Jonah Fraenkel 1. E.E. Hallewy is entirely correct in his claim that there is no such thing as a literary genre of aggadic narratives containing criticism of the Sages. The present writer never meant to argue the opposite. 2. One of the major tenets of the present author's thesis is that the aggadic narrative must be interpreted from within itself, and that no single story can be understood on the basis of parallels. The lack or addition of certain details in one of the parallels should not be understood as something incidental. 3. The investigating scholar is required to decide whether a certain individual aggadic narrative is an artistic literary creation or an historical entity. There is no certainty that E.E. Hallewy has seriously weighed these two alternatives.</page><page sequence="13">ENGLISH SUMMARIES xm NOTES TO N. ALLONY'S ,NEW INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PRIESTLY COURSES AND VARIOUS POEMS' (TARBIZ, XLVIII, 1979, pp. 222-230) by Ezra Fleischer 1. The elegy which allegedly mentions 'a man belonging to one of the twenty-four priestly courses', occurring in 'fragment T-S NS 8/94' is a well-known and widespread poem of consolation, published some fifty years ago by M. Zulay, Zur Liturgie der babylonischen Juden, Stuttgart 1933, p. 38. It is copied or mentioned in many Geniza manuscripts, and usually follows paytanic dirges. There is no mention at all in this text, neither of the dead person mourned, nor of his belonging to any priestly course. The exact number of the manuscript utilized by N. Allony is T-S K 8/94, not T-S NS 8/94. 2. There is nothing in MS T-S NS 275.33 a-d published by N. Allony that can be described as 'the last strophe of a Muwashahah with the Kharja'. Actually this manuscript contains a short jiiyyut, written entirely in Hebrew,, whose last line was misread by Allony as Arabic. 3. The allegedly anonymous poem מרוב כאבי אזעק whose first line only appears in the manuscript quoted by Allony in his article, is not an unknown text, as stated by the author. Indeed, the complete poem has been published by N. Allony, cf. Sinai, XLIV (1959), p. 159.. MORE ON JiEZKAT-Y1SHUV (TARBIZ, XLVII, 1978. pp. 216-229) by Shlomo Eidelberg The present writer calls for a re-examination of the sources cited by R.G. Kestenberg, in her interpretation of herem (or hezkat) ha-yishuv, viz., that this concept is rooted in the medieval Christian legal system. It is shown, on the contrary,, that such an ancient legal concept actually existed in Jewish Law, and may even be dated prior to the Mishnaic Period. Dr. Kestenberg's suggestion that herem (or hezkat) ha-yishuv — ban of settlement, is equivalent to the medieval legal concept of bannus civitatis, has already been raised by Prof. A. Zuckerman in Speculum, XXII (1947), p. 658. Nevertheless, it should be stressed, that the equivalent of 'herem ha-yishuv' is not bannus civitatis but rather jus banmtrium — Nachbar — recht. Medieval non-Jewish society undoubtedly possessed a concept similar to herem ha yishuv, but this was most likely an independent development among the European nations. The present writer also contends that the concept of Bannmeile was not adopted by the Jewish community from the medieval Christian legal system, but is rather rooted in the talmudic concept of parsa (parasang) mentioned in T.B. (B.B. 21b).</page></plain_text>
