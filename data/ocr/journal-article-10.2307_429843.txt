<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIRGIL ALDRICH "Expresses" and "Expressive AMONG AESTHETICIANS today there is much ado about the meaning of "expressive," as distinguished from the meaning of "ex- presses." The latter naturally raises the ques- tion as to what is expressed, turning on the bipolarity of "expression" which involves what I shall call an "expressans" and an "expressandum." The aim of these aesthe- ticians is to define "expressive" in a way that exempts it from this dual requirement of "expresses." They want "expressive" to func- tion-especially in aesthetic use-as a sim- ple adjective, such that when a work of art or a face or sky is said to be expressive, noth- ing whatsoever is implied as to what is ex- pressed or what expresses it. Gurney says, "Thus we often call music .. .expressive ... .without being able, or dreaming we are able, to connect these general terms with anything expressed."l Tormey writes: "A cruel expression in a human face does not automatically entitle us to infer that cruelty is being expressed,"2 meaning here to iso- late the intransitive sense of "expressive." Beardsley asserts: "'Express' is properly a relational term; it requires an X that does the expressing and a Y that is expressed, and X and Y must be distinct. When we say that a rose is red, we have only one thing, namely the rose, and we describe its quality; in exactly the same way, when we say that the music is joyous, we have only one thing, namely the music, and we describe its qual- ity. There is no need for the term 'ex- press.' "3 And all the world knows what Bouwsma has said in this vein though not VIRGIL ALDRICH is professor of philosophy at The University of Utah. nearly so bluntly. "As the life and the light describe (respectively) the geranium and the sun, so too does the sadness describe the music."4 One does not say the geranium expresses life or the sun expresses light. One says simply the geranium is alive, the sun is luminous. So one says, simply, the music is sad-not meaning of course that one should console the poor thing. What one does mean, using "sad" as an aesthetic predicate and other aesthetic predicates, and what all this presupposes, is what I shall proceed to inquire into here, with some malaise over the above positions. But, first, a glance at certain points in the quotations, with amplifications. Why does Gurney, in the attempt to isolate the simple predicate sense of "expressive," speak of "general terms" that can't be connected with anything expressed? I can see why one would think of "expressive" as a general term, but then what about "pathetic" or "trium- phant"? The use of the plural-"general terms"-suggests that these are to be included among them. They indeed are general terms since each applies to a range of cases, but surely of a lower order of generality than "expressive," under which they are specific. A quote from Tormey helps to illustrate the point. "We can refer to the movements of a Thai dancer performing a Lakon as expressive even though we may have no idea what the movements 'mean' and no precise language in which to describe them."5 Tormey astutely avoids saying "what the movements express," since the sophisti- cated use of "expressive" blocks that ques- tion, but then one wonders how to interpret the legitimate question about what the dance</page><page sequence="2">A LD R I C H "means" and what a "precise language" making the answer feasible would be like. The suggestion certainly is still of terms that lie in the extension of the general term "expressive," terms that specify what is left open by simply saying of something that it is "expressive," supplying which would (at least seem to) answer the question, expressive of what? or, what is expressed? Similarly, if the term is expressivo on a sheet of music, the injunction to the performer is left empty if it is interpreted simply as an instruction to do justice to the "expressive" quality of the piece, unless it is presupposed that the composition reveals some specific "expres- sive" quality in the proper performance of it-or some limited set of such qualities one of which may be opted for in the perform- ance. Then, surely, performing such a piece expressivo would be to "express" that quality, where "express" means "reveal" or "realize." But Tormey sides with the descriptivists here, as against the Expression Theory. When we say of the performance that it is "expressive of," say, sadness or tenderness or agitation, we say something "descriptive of some feature of the artwork,"6 meaning that the described feature is not "expressed" by the work. This is, again, because he takes "expressive of" as a one-place predicate des- ignating a quality that is related to the art work as green is related to a leaf-of course with necessary reservations that admit the difference between "garden variety" qualities and the expressive sort. So we are back with Beardsley and Bouwsma. Consider again Beardsley's remark to the effect that when we say a rose is red, we describe its quality. To be sure, when we say this, we don't "express" anything. We do indeed describe something; but surely it is the rose that we describe by predicating red of it. We don't, in the same breath, describe the red. "Red," with red for refer- ent, is the descriptor; the rose is the de- scriptee. By the same token, when we say the music is sad, we describe the music, not sadness. But this is a minor point, about which I think Beardsley might agree. The crucial question concerns the relation of the quality to its bearer. The relation between the rose and its color is certainly not expres- sion. The rose does not express its color. It may "show" it in the right light but this is not an expressive use of "show." What is shown in this sense is something you simply see if you have good eye sight. It is similar for the temporally patterned sounds of in- struments you hear, when it is music. If you have good hearing, you will simply hear what Beardsley calls the "sub-regional" qualities of the music-its minor progres- sions, slow tempo, etc. Listening to the music and reporting just these qualities will "describe" the music, under the same logic as looking at the rose and describing it as red. The bearer is not expressing its quality, and stating this fact is a description, not an expression. Indeed, one can safely say for any bearer S of any quality P of whatever order, that S never of itself "describes" P. It may show P, in expressive or non-expres- sive senses of "show." And, whether the relation between S and P is an expression or not, S is to be described one way or the other. The question, "Is the relation be- tween S and P descriptive or expressive?" is nonsense. What is to be asked is, "Does S express P or simply show it non-expressive- ly?" Even when we go on (move up?) to say the music is sad, we certainly are still de- scribing the music. But remember the cru- cial issue about the relation between the quality in question and the bearer: is the latter "expressing" the former, or not? And remember that there is no such thing as a "descriptive" relation directly between a bearer and its quality of whatever order. We have room only for the consideration of whether it is expressive or not. The rose case is non-expressive. What of sadness in relation to a work of art? Tormey calls sadness, predicated of an art work, an "expressive quality," in the strictly intransitive sense of "expressive," and the art work itself he calls an "expressively ambiguous object."7 This apparently means, for him, that sadness is not an expressed property, and the work of art does not ex- press it. The property, named by a one- place predicate, qualifies the work, as red qualifies the rose, though it is a different 204</page><page sequence="3">"Expresses" and "Expressive" sort of property-not the garden variety-and the art work as a bearer of the property, is of a logically different order from the rose qua bearer of red. A rose does not ambigu- ously express it color. It just non-expressive- ly reveals it. But there is an "expressive" sense of "re- veal" that Tormey has crucial use for: "The complex of relations among the properties of an art work is such that it can be seen as presenting some of its properties and reveal- ing others (my italics); those properties which are its expressive properties them- selves being revealed through the presenta- tion of varying sets of nonexpressive proper- ties."8 One wonders why Tormey, having such fluent use for "expressive" on the level of art-talk, does not allow "reveals" here to be replaced by "expresses," with whatever restrictions on the concept that are neces- sary to block the notion that the art work feels what it expresses-a full-blooded, ob- ject-oriented, intentional state-or that it expresses what the artist felt or what the beholder of the work feels. One has the im- pression that his sole motive for not doing this is fear that this would let the camel of the romantic (sentimental) Expression Theory into the tent of his objectivist descriptivism. The proper, because required, restrictions on "expresses" would block this invasion, as readily as his restrictions on "expressive." Beardsley's formulation is more strategic for the wholesale attack on any theory that accommodates the word "expresses." He does not speak of the sadness of the music as an "expressive" quality, which keeps one too close to the notion of something expressed. (Saying of sadness, or any quality, that it is "expressive" is the opening wedge for the question about what it expresses. And sad- ness is never itself expressive; the configu- rations of some things may or may not be, according to whether or not they "reveal" sadness.) For Beardsley, sadness is a human "regional" or "whole" quality that "emer- ges" (supervenes?) on a base of "local" or "part" qualities. The latter correspond to Tormey's nonexpressive "presented" proper- ties of the art work. Beardsley's advantage of having no use for "expressive," is that 205 then there is no suggestion of the emergent quality of a composition of parts being ex- pressed or even revealed. It is simply a high- er-order quality of the art work than its ele- mental qualities, itself being causally de- pendent on the latter.9 But this puts Beardsley into difficulties when, in order to distinguish the art work's emergent quality (sadness) from your sad- ness or mine, he-unlike Tormey-resorts to talk about metaphor. The music, he says, is sad, metaphorically speaking. You and I are literally sad. If this means that the music does not feel sad, as we occasionally do, or that the composer maybe didn't feel sad, etc. there are no objections. But the spotlight is on the emergent quality of the music. If "the music is sad" is a metaphor, are we to suppose the emergent quality of the compo- sition, denoted here by "sad," is not there in the music for objective notice? Only the local or part qualities literally qualify the composition? But these, Beardsley says, cause the emergent or regional quality of sadness attributed to the music. If talk about the elements is not metaphorical, and they caus- ally determine the emergent quality, one wonders how metaphor intervenes in talk about the quality that is a function of their organization. Why not say instead that the regional quality gets instantiated in some art works and some people, the difference being that it is not an emotion felt by the art works it qualifies-or by the sky or the call of a loon on a chill twilit lagoon, not necessarily even by the beholder or the com- poser who perceives it. Dewey forthrightly said of some situations that they are "doubt- ful," meaning literally that doubtfulness pervades them as a regional quality. Given a situation with certain local qualities, there emerges the pervasive (regional) quality with a view to which one may say "the situ- ation is doubtful" and mean it literally, without at all having to mean that the situ- ation has doubts. Perhaps it is the nascent physicalism undergirding Beardsley's phe- nomenalism that cows him into suspecting that talk about any phenomenal quality, which in the art case has only an objet man- que for bearer, must be more or less meta- phorical. The straight physicalist, who be-</page><page sequence="4">A LDRICH lieves the final truth about experiences must be couched in "purely physico-chemical terms,"10 is similarly inclined to deny the literalness of statements even about the "sad- ness' of people, a fortiori of works of art. Any bedrock, literally true assertion must be about a physical object with its micro- constitution and physical field properties, in which the intentional idiom at its face value gets no foothold at all. In this con- text, there is no logical room for the notion of perceiving what is "in" a work of art. That use of "in" needs to be clarified. Goodman claims it is "unintelligible," and Morgan says it is "obviously" a metaphor.12 Tormey gets close to the right idea when he writes: "Significant works of art have a per- ceptual thickness, and the critical task is to see into them, not through them or beyond them" (italics in text).13 In this connection, he says that art works are "self-expressive objects," meaning by the italics to shield himself against re-invasion by the Expres- sion Theory. A work of art expresses nothing but itself, thus showing what is "in" it. This seems to re-instate "expressive property," the latter being expressed by the non-ex- pressive properties the work "presents." The tenderness (expressive property) of Ravel's Pavane, Tormey suggests, is expressed (he says "constituted," "revealed") by its tempo, dynamics, harmonic texture, melodic con- tour, (its non-expressive properties). The composition thus expresses itself-"self-ex- pressive"-and the content of the expression is to be ascertained by perception "into" the art work, not through it or beyond it. This at least seems to sanction our saying that what were called expressive properties are themselves expressed by the so-called non- expressive properties presented by the work of art in self-expression. What is more, it gives the so-called non-expressive properties an expressive role. From here on, I shall draw attention to the logic of "in" as distinguished from its sense when physical inclusion is intended. We already have a sophisticated logic of propositions. What we sorely need is a more sophisticated and impartial logic of prepo- sitions, especially of "in." Until this is achieved, philosophical psychology, episte- mology, ontology and aesthetics will con- tinue to be spectacular demonstrations of biases in favor of some special sense of "in," and the irresponsible claims about unin- telligibility and metaphor that attend this. Out of a better understanding on this score will also emerge a more adequate conception of "aesthetic object"-the concept that occa- sionally applies both to "found" things in nature and to the artifacts that are works of art-the things namely, that occasionally function as points of view on something perceptible "in" them. The notion that this "in," aesthetically used, is metaphorical or unintelligible stems from certain misconceptions of an aesthetic object. Suppose it is a picture of shepherds tending their flock. This is what one sees in it. The physicalist, construing the picture under a description employing "purely physico-chemical terms," is forced to take such seeing-in as metaphorical at best, since no one thinks there are shepherds and sheep to be seen in a set of micro-particles. Indeed, no one sees such sets at all. He conceives them, as the targets of the reference of theo- retical terms. The nominalist, like Good- man, who must excuse himself for talking about characters or qualities instead of about particular "labels," etc., is hard put to make sense even of the "in" of physical inclusion. ("In" itself is just another label.) This is why he must discard the whole vocabulary of plain talk with its commitment to the notion of "the world" and what is in it (recognizing the multifarious sense of "in") in favor of conceptually concocting as many worlds as you like but excluding the aes- thetic use of "in." One learns to "read" a picture-what labels it denotes or is denoted by or refers to, itself functioning as a label -somewhat as one learns to read Sanskrit. What is "in" the picture is like what is "in" a lamb symbolizing Christ. And no one sees Christ in a lamb or a sheaf of corn, though they may symbolize Him. A pictorial repre- sentation of anything, says Goodman, is too dependent on conventions governing simi- larity considerations, to be straightforwardly "of" anything on its own. Anything, on its own, is in some respect like anything else on its own or without benefit of restrictive 206</page><page sequence="5">"Expresses" and "Expressive" conventions. So resemblance cannot be appealed to in answering the question about what the pictorial representation is "of." It is answered only by appeal to the restric- tions on similarity imposed by convention. This fixes the "core" of the matter, which for representation is "denotation,"14 gov- erned by the accepted symbol system. All this puts interpreting a work of art too much under the model of interpreting a linguistic expression. Though there are logical differences, "see- ing something in a picture" is as logically primitive a notion as "seeing something in a mirror." No one would naturally say that what he sees in the mirror's field of repre- sentation is on its surface, or behind it, or anywhere else but in the mirror-the "in" of non-physical inclusion, logically as primi- tive as the "in" of physical inclusion. The sense of "in" varies according to whether it goes with representation or ex- pression. The more realistically representa- tional a work of art is, the more naturally one answers the question, what is to be per- ceived "in" it? by speaking of "objects" appearing in its field of representation, and being "depicted" there. In general, repre- sentation is of objects. Objects, simply and as such, are not "expressed." Of course, if the depicted thing is sentient, it may be depicted as expressing pain, anger, sadness, etc., but these will not be additional ob- jects in the field of representation of the representans, or anywhere else. They are "nothing in themselves," a categorial notion I shall say more about later. Even when it is some thing (object) that is depicted, the sense of perceiving it "in" a field of representation will be strained if certain conditions are not fulfilled. There is no strain if it is, say, a picture postcard of shepherds tending their flock. The card is two feet from your eyes; what you see in it is within easy bowshot. The card is too close for any bowshot. This gives "seeing in" a firm foothold without conceding anything to the idea that the shepherds and sheep are behind or beyond the card in the line of sight from seer to card. The content is shielded from location in that primary per- ceptual field by the card's white border serving as frame. (Similar remarks hold for what is seen in a mirror.) But suppose it is the duck-rabbit figure, sketched all alone on the blackboard. The rabbit aspect dawns on the figure. Do you want to say you see a rabbit "in" the figure? Seeing it "as" a rabbit perhaps makes more sense. You want to speak of seeing the pastoral scene "in" the picture postcard because of a certain contextual determinateness the depicted ob- jects have there relative to one another, with the card functioning as point of view on them, itself not in view. The shepherd is taller than his sheep. But how big is the rabbit you see the duck-rabbit figure as? Bigger than the rabbit you saw it as yester- day? As big as the duck you occasionally see it as? These questions have no clear answers because this sort of depiction provides no ground for the questions. The ambiguous figure is not functioning as a point of view on anything. And it is not just the ambi- guity of the figure that is responsible for this. The same questions give rise to similar perplexities if aimed at an unambiguous sketch of just a rabbit, all alone on the black- board. You would be cheating if you said this depicted rabbit is smaller than an ele- phant. That would be a reference to unde- picted rabbits and elephants-originals out- side the field of representation. Similar qual- ifications hold for the use of "perceiving in" applied to sculpture, dance, theater, music, and literature, where these represent or de- pict something. Now, for expression. One may of course speak of what an art work expresses (the expressandum) as a part of its "content," and this seems to sanction saying that the expressandum is "in" the field of expression of the work qua expressans. However, "field of expression" is logically not as neat as "field of representation" for the notion of containment. If x represents y, one naturally looks to see the y depicted in x. But when x expresses y, the suggestion is of x bodying forth y, such that y is no longer "in" x where it would have been latent and con- cealed without the expression. Thus (pace Tormey) there is something inept about the notion of having to look "into" a work of art to discern what it expresses, what he 207</page><page sequence="6">A LD R I C H imisleadingly calls its "expressive quality." (An expressive face may show-express- sadness which itself is not expressive.) En- tertaining such a notion shows a failure to distinguish sufficiently expression from rep- resentation with its "content" of depicted objects. Wollheim is wisely concerned to make the required distinction when he sug- gests that "seeing in" connects with repre- sentation and "seeing as" with expression.15 But unfortunately, he overlooks the ambig- uity of "surface of a painting" when he sup- poses that the italics make the distinction that I go on to clarify below. The notion of having to see "into" an art work has the merit of forcing an important distinction. It forces one to distinguish "sur- face of a physical object" from "surface of an aesthetic object." No one would understand the instruction to see through or into the surface of a physical object. He either sees willynilly through it if it is transparent- meaning the surface is invisible-or he can't do this if it (the thing) is opaque, seeing willynilly only the surface. But if something like "surface of something qua aesthetic object" is intended, all the relevant senses of non-physical inclusion, "seeing in" and "seeing as" come into play. This is why, when this is going on, it only curdles con- cepts to suppose that one is discerning de- picted objects in, and what is expressed by, a "physical object." This fact makes non- sense of the notion that discriminating aes- thetic characteristics is "based on, if not the same as discrimination of physical quali- ties."16 Anyone who believes that this is what aesthetic discerning really amounts to will be forced, in the end, to subjectivism, in terms of what people feel, imagine, or think under the causal influence of the physical objects they call works of art; not in terms of what is "in" the works themselves. All this sets the stage for the consideration of what a work of art (or anything) is, as an aesthetic object; and of what light the an- swer to this question throws on the concept of expression as applied to art works. What we need is a concept of "the same thing" presupposed by the distinction between "physical object" and "aesthetic object,"'7 a concept that allows us to say a work of art is indeed a physical object, while denying the relevance of this to any consideration of it-the "same thing"-as an aesthetic object. Since expression in art concerns what Sir- cello calls "anthropomorphic properties'18 and what Beardsley calls "human regional qualities," I first consider an analogy of art works with persons,19 examining what it is for a person to "body forth" or express such a property or quality. The notion "bodying forth" is important for our task since it ties "expressing" with a body functioning in a certain way. This will help us to get the right notion of that to which the above prop- erties are being attributed-the "thing" which Beardsley's phenomenalism makes him think of uneasily as an objet manque. So we will be killing two birds with one stone, our quarries being the thing as an aes- thetic object on the one hand, and what expressing and what gets expressed amount to on the other. In this investigation, the concept "point of view" will turn out to be crucial. We shall get more light on that too. Well, then, let us first look at a person and see what can be made of the notion "seeing into a person," toying with Tormey's suggestion of there being a certain "percep- tual thickness" here. He puts it nicely: "The 'surface' of expressive behavior is easily de- tached and reproduced," and he speaks of "the observable surface of expressive behav- ior,"20 He is referring to the condition that makes pretense, acting on stage, etc., pos- sible, where the behavior is expressive with- out implying that the agent (or the beholder) is in the "intentional state" revealed by the behavior. Where this is the case, the "expres- sive property" is attributable to the behavior alone; and this presumably fixes Tormey's meaning of "observable surface of expres- sive behavior." We remember that a cruel expression need not be an expression of cruelty. The importance of this vein of thinking is that it stresses the notion of a thing "functioning" in a certain way. If the agent is a person, he may function (behave) in a way that masks what is "in" him. (The Iatin persona meant the mask used by actors.) But behavior of the masking sort is feasible only because behavior of a person ordinarily 208</page><page sequence="7">"Expresses" and "Expressive" "reveals" his "inner" life-the embodied, full-blooded intentional states that the be- havior bodies forth. Such behavior still has an "observable surface," but presumably its "thickness" is not just "perceptual." One occasionally infers-not sees-into it. A per- son can pretend; a work of art cannot, be- cause it cannot have (to-be-inferred) reasons for putting on a false show. But if the person is acting a part on stage, the notion of "detached" and "reproduced" behavior again applies, but this time with aesthetic significance. While pretending, he is being two-faced (Janus-faced) about some- thing, aiming to make the (sur)face con- ceal the (sub)face-his "real" face-beneath. While performing as a dramatis persona, the intention is to make the sur-face dis- appear in favor of the sub-face of the part he is "realizing," the face of the character his performance on stage is meant to reveal. Then he, qua actor, is functioning as an aesthetic object. One "sees into" him to view the part he is playing. The only way to win as a philosopher of art is to get this fundamental fact straight. The aesthetic object is never to be identified either with what is represented, or with the "expressive properties" revealed, by the work of art. It is the art work (material thing) that is the aesthetic object, when functioning in the self-effacing way necessary both to repre- sentation and expression in art. It then functions as a point of view on the repre- sentational or expressive "content" of the work, the point of view itself being not in view while the content is "prehended," a term explicated below. Similar remarks hold for a person in prop- ria persona, i.e., off-stage. One looks "into" his face, his posture, his gesture, to get his feelings, intentions, expectations; and one gets his thoughts "in" the words he utters. The person is, for another, a body function- ing as a point of view on such "contents"; and the person is, for himself, this body functioning as point of view on the environ- ment. In either case, the body, functioning as point of view, is not itself in view-not itself the target of attention. Some such analysis is required to give the sense tantalizingly suggested by Beards- 209 ley's objet manque, and Tormey's "per- ceptual thickness" to be "seen into." Even in a personal encounter, where there is a meeting of minds, the bodies involved are in a sense objets manques. They are not pri- marily in view but only "shadow" the en- counter, as Wittgenstein says21-as the bodies also of inanimate things, whether works of art or just trouves, shadow their contents if they are of the sort to lend themselves to such prehension; i.e., if their surface is percep- tually thick in the non-physical sense. And to speak thus non-physicalistically does not at all imply speaking metaphorically. As sadness can be "in" a face without connoting the full-blooded intentional state of feeling sad, so can it be "in" a non-living thing. In both cases, there is a sur-face to be "seen into" to get the sub-face of sadness revealed by the sur-face that, functioning as point of view, disappears in favor of the pre- hended content. All this gets us to the bed-rock consider- ation of the idea of the "same thing" functioning this way or that, or to the de- scription of what it is that may function thus one way or another. The correct ac- count of this will protect us against the false notion that our only recourse is either to the physical (objects and qualities) or to the phenomenal (objets manques and apparent qualities); the notion, in short, that even at base, there is only this categorial dichotomy (associated with the dichotomy of the physi- cal and the mental). If this were our start- ing point, then we do indeed have, at base, only the physical ab initio or the pheno- menal ab initio, and are at a loss to under- stand how there can be any "thing" objec- tively referred to as the bearer of (pheno- menal) qualities, when reference to physical objects is categorially excluded by the logic of talk about aesthetic objects. In this light, one is forced to construe (like Beardsley) the bearer of aesthetic (regional) qualities as it- self nothing but a set of (local) phenomenal qualities-an objet manque indeed. Or, one is cornered into thinking that the bearer of aesthetic qualities is a physical object "appearing" thus and so, forgetting that ap- pearances are irrelevant to anything qua physical object. A physical object descrip-</page><page sequence="8">210 tion of a thing is concerned with what the thing is 'in itself'-an object of conception, not of perception. (This remark is stipula- tive, and will be defended at the end of the essay.) So, the "same thing" that may function this way or that, under exclusive categories, will be something in the field of perception, where claims about what is, or is to be, perceived make sense, and are confirmed or disconfirmed by reference to the "same thing," whether under the category of the physical or the aesthetic. I call this field the "primary perceptual field," distinguishing it from secondary fields of representation such as go with mirrors, pictures and verbal- isms. The things in the primary perceptual field are not, as such, either physical or aes- thetic objects. Let us call them "material things," the things that "matter" when claims are made about them either simply as such, or under this or that category, the appeal at bottom being made to the "same thing" in either case. To illustrate this fundamental point, let us consider again "the surface of a painting" (Wollheim), and ask for a description of it. Well, taking the phrase quite neutrally or without presuppositions, it is the surface of anything after it has had paint applied to it-a croquet ball, a car's fender, or the wall of a house, or a canvas by Poussin (Woll- heim's favorite). The description in this neutral vein of the surface of the painting would use such phrases as: it is dull red, rough, cracked here and there, beginning to peel in places; descriptions all of which would be about properties of the paint as a "material" which "matters" very much, according to the kind and purpose of the painted thing. In this light, the surface also of the painted thing-not the paint's surface -"matters" a great deal. It can be too ab- sorbent, too rough, too smooth, to be a "good" surface for a painting, still in the neutral sense, leaving open the question of the painterly purpose or the kind of painted thing. One learns of the "matter" or stuff of such things by experience, not theorizing. By scraping the paint off its surface, he finds out it is wood, metal, plaster, cloth, canvas -or the skin surfacing the flesh of a woman's ALD R I C H face. (As if he didn't know beforehand.) Here ends the account of "material things" simpliciter, simply seeing which is not to see anything either in physical or aesthetic space. We are in a position now to consider the phenomenon of what I shall call "categorial aspection,"22 first in the direction of the aes- thetic. (The issue is the crucial one that Tormey tackles, the account of the relation between "expressive" and "non-expressive" properties, or of how the latter determine and "reveal" the former, thus providing the ground for aesthetic appreciation and criti- cism.) When Wollheim italicized "of a painting" in his phrase "surface of a paint- ing," he meant of course "of a picture," with paint for material. That is, his concern was with experiencing (perceiving) something as a picture,23 and then raising the question of its "surface." Such categorial aspection introduces the subtle stratified concept of something to be seen into (sur-face, sub- face). No animal (non-person) ever sees anything as a picture, which is why it never stops to look at a picture to see what is "in" it. More generally, it never per- ceives any material thing as an aesthetic object. Only persons do. What, now, are we to make of the notion, "observable surface" when the referent is the surface of a material thing categorially aspecting as an aesthetic object? The answer is important because it will distinguish "aes- thetic surface" from "surface of a material thing as such" without wholly dissociating it from the latter, while also showing the minimal sense in which so many material things that are not "works of art" are never- theless treasured for their "aesthetic quali- ties," as aesthetic objects. Moreover, it will get us back to "expresses" and "expressive," in their most elemental senses; senses that George Dickie must have had in mind when he proposed that just about anything could have "artifactuality conferred" upon it.24 I am drawing attention to the properties of materials, such as paint or things emitting sounds, properties that "body forth" or "show" or "express" qualities properly called "aesthetic," on a grass-roots or earthy level. These expressed qualities are, if you</page><page sequence="9">"Expresses" and "Expressive" like, second-order qualities but this means only that the material thing with its first- order properties has undergone categorial aspection in the direction of aesthetic objec- tification. For example, the colors and con- tours of the material (paint) may express (body forth) warmth, delicacy, etc., and, in relation to one another, harmony or disso- nance; or be up front or in back (yellow and lavender). The same is true for the sounds emitted by the material thing. They are dimminuendo or crescendo in relation to one another, or high (bright) or low (som- ber) each by itself. No description, whose referents are these bodied forth qualities, could fit the properties of the materials that body them forth, prior to the categorial as- pection. After it, the very space of the thing in question is transfigured into aesthetic space-the proper "region" for both "region- al" and "local" qualities (Beardsley) that have any aesthetic status, with the material thing as their ultimate bearer while func- tioning as point of view on them ("shadow- ing" them\ What I am making of categorial aspection in the direction of the aesthetic is kin to what I have already said about a body function- ing as a point of view on something, itself not in view. I am saying here that the ma- terial thing in question, under such cate- gorial aspection, disappears in favor of it as an aesthetic object. To undergo this, the material thing need not be a work of art. Anything that has certain colors or contours, or emits sounds singly of such and such sorts or in such and such patterns can be aestheti- cally appreciated with a view to the qualities bodied forth (expressed) by the first-order (garden-variety) properties of the materials whatsoever. The account I have been giving is of what might properly be said to be of the "aesthetic surface," what Tormey had in mind when he wrote of "observable sur- face," with aesthetic considerations in mind. One must see or hear the material thing as an aesthetic object if he is to be aware of the ground level considerations that count in the confirmation of descriptions or assessments of it as an aesthetic object. This is the only way to distinguish aesthetic prop- erties of any order from the garden variety 211 which qualify only the material thing as such, or the materials of the art, if an art is in question. In this elemental sense of "express," what is expressed by the material is its "medium." One does not look for the "content" of an aesthetic object-work of art or not-in its material. Having a content, materially speaking, has little to do with aesthetic con- siderations. But one may look into a ma- terial thing as an aesthetic object-art work or not-to get the feel of its medium. It is with an eye to this that the artist manipu- lates his materials, aware of what is thus realized in their medium. In the medium of the sounds of instruments or bird-song (ma- terial) one perceives treble, base, progres- sions, that are dolce or not. Nothing like this is true of, say, just noise with no pitch, in that it has no medium. A single pure tone can have this status too-no medium- as a property of just the material. (As "col- ors clashing" makes no sense in talk of just materials; any color can be beside any other color without discord or harmony where the talk is of a material thing as such and its properties.) However, the materials "matter" for much, even where the concern is aesthetic. It is their (garden variety) properties that "ex- press" (show) the first-order aesthetic qual- ities in the medium. This is getting consid- erably beneath what Tormey has in mind where talking about "non-expressive" prop- erties. I am saying that the properties he calls non-expressive, such as tempo, cre- scendo, contour, pitch, brightness, etc., in- sofar as they have any aesthetic relevance, are such as one becomes aware of only when he hears the sounds as music, such that then they are already in the medium, themselves expressed (shown) by the (garden variety) sonorous properties of the material things emitting the sounds. A similar remark holds for the visual art cases aspecting as aesthetic objects. Saying this, and keeping it in mind, is the only way to get out of the jungle of questions about the bearer of aesthetic qual- ities-the material thing that, as aesthetic object, "has" them. Moreover, this notion of the medium of the material explains our appreciating so many material things as aes-</page><page sequence="10">ALDRICH thetic objects that are not works of art. One appreciates them for the "timbre," the "character," expressed simply by their col- ors, sounds, and figures (contours). And, again, one does this without benefit of George Dickie's "conferred artifactuality" which ineptly purports to convert them into art works. They are not works of art. But they are aesthetic objects. So much for the medium of the material -what first comes to light only when some- thing is perceived as an aesthetic object. It is this that counts as "evidence" for or against aesthetic judgment; it is the aesthetic surface. Now, we are ready to consider what such ground-level aesthetic qualities themselves express-or what is expressed by the aes- thetic surface, the "observable surface," aes- thetically speaking. And this gets us to what Tormey calls the expressive properties and Beardsley the emergent (regional) qualities, such as denoted by "sad," its opposite, and the like. To get clear about this, it will help to introduce the concept "qualities of compo- sition." "Composition" here has the advan- tage of referring both to qualities of sets of elements-hence "regional"-and to the act of getting them, the elements, together to capture the compositional quality in ques- tion. There are two sorts of qualities of com- position, both of which may be regional: (1) those referred to by non-psychological terms, such as "solid," "ponderous," "lumin- ous," "grand," "unified," "delicate"; (2) those associated with psychological terms (in the "intentional idiom") such as "pensive," "gay." There is a crucial logical difference be- tween these two sets. The predicates for both sets of properties may have the restricted (sophisticated) use in talk about aesthetic objects with their "observable surfaces" to be "seen into." But only the non-psychological predicates can be used to apply all the way down, so to speak. Not only are the apples depicted in a Cezanne painting "solid." The configurated pigment-the material thing or the body that bodies forth the depicted apples-is "solid," in the homely sense. So is the picture as a whole, on the wall. More- over, there is a physical analysis with metri- cal quantifications of such solid bodies and their properties in the primary perceptual field, which gives us the sophisticated sense of "solid material thing" as a physical ob- ject. In short "solid" is a property of which a concept with intension and extension can be formed. In that light, it is a "nature" that is something "in itself," which justifies the demand for a definition. So for the other non-psychological predicates such as tempo, crescendo, delicate, bright, remote, ponder- ous. They denote qualities that qualify bod- ies, whether depicted "in" something (the apples), or on the side of the bodies that do the depicting or expressing, including the bodies that neither represent nor express anything. It is important to notice that these non- psychological predicates may denote region- al qualities, both in aesthetic and non-aes- thetic uses. The features of a face may make it "heavy" or "delicate," whether depicted or not. To see this, you have to see the whole face. The same is the case for a "mas- sive" building, or the "tempestuous" sea. These are compositional qualities in such applications. Even "luminous," though it may denote the local quality of an element, denotes a regional quality when used to re- fer to, say, the Venetian sky, whether de- picted in a Turner or not. But of course the Venetian sky by itself only "shows" the quality in the non-expressive sense of "show" noted earlier. The Turner both "ex- presses" and "represents" it in different re- spects. It is there not only as a regional quality of the surface of the pigment that somewhat resembles the luminosity of the sky itself-in which regard the painting represents the sky "in" the medium of the picture-but it is also there expressed as a property of the medium itself. Beardsley calls this latter the "design" without ade- quately distinguishing this from the con- figurated material, which is why he thinks that aesthetic predication must be meta- phorical description and that this dismisses "expression" from talk of aesthetic objects. Without the notion of "medium of the ma- terial," at which aesthetic talk bottoms, one is left either with the material thing simplic- 212</page><page sequence="11">"Expresses" and "Expressive" iter as bearer of aesthetic qualities, or with a set of detached "phenomenal qualities" for bearer-the alternative that Beardsley flirts with and its suggestion of objet manque. Now, for the psychological predicates. There is a radical difference here, one that requires a subversive way of thinking to be fair to the difference. Not only do psycho- logical predicates fail to be applicable "all the way down." They have no direct appli- cation to bodies at all, whether living or not. "This body is in pain," "that body is doing philosophy (thinking)," "the other body over there is sad," and the like are nonsense. Not only this, but the very notion of psychological predicates being denoting terms, with which one can refer to various "qualities" and describe things having them, is itself suspect. That is why, in phi- losophy, there has long been the theme, played with variations, that the "intentional idiom" is non-referential.25 So we have elim- inative physicalism with its exclusive pre- ference for description with its denoting and referring terms, or mentalistic romanticism preferring pure expression without descrip- tive reference to things and their qualities. Their only agreement is that (psychologi- cal) "content"-the "meaning" of things- can only be expressed, not described.26 Then physicalism concludes that, in the final onto- logical analysis, there is nothing-or nothing exists-to be expressed; while romanticism concludes that, ontologically speaking, there is nothing to be described. (The old physi- cal-mental dichotomy.) This notion that psychological predicates are not to be used under the logical model of object-property description deserves re- spect. It may well be that, e.g., "sad" does not, by itself, "denote" any property or quality (local or regional, expressive or non- expressive) of any thing, and yet has an important use. If so, to say something is sad is not to "qualify" it at all, as one does qualify it by saying it "presents" a droop- ing or sagging figure-a non-psychological term that applies "all the way down." What a figure is seen as, or what is seen in it, is certainly not a quality of the figure or of the figured thing. So, if qualities are in question, 213 not only is there no application all the way down. There isn't any on top. And, if so, sadness is not a "nature in itself," an "es- sence" of which a concept with intension and extension can be formed. It is then logically unlike "red," which has even a physical analysis in terms of wave-lengths. This is ground for contending it is not a property at all to be either denoted or described. Of course, if all this is so, the no- tion given above of "qualities of composi- tion" cannot include sadness as one of them. But there was another meaning of "com- position," having to do with the act of get- ting things together in a configuration that has a "capturing" function. This is Sir- cello's term,27 which for him is crucial in his account of expression. It has the merit of suggesting that what is expressed (expres- sandum) by a "capture" does not qualify what captures it (expressans). Captives are not qualities of their captors. But the way Sircello treats this has a demerit. It is not clear that he follows the suggestion, and the reason for this is that he considers what is captured to be a quality somewhat like a Platonic universal, though he balks at the notion of its disembodied existence.28 The very notion of capturing is to blame here, since it suggests that what is captured was there beforehand, to become captive. So I shall discard "capturing" in favor of 'realizing." This has the advantage of sug- gesting that what is realized in the expres- sans has no re-ality as a nature-in-itself. The expression entifies it. And, faute de mieux, I shall speak of what is thus realized in an expression, as a "state." A state conditions, a quality qualifies. A thing is "in" this or that state. It "has" this or that quality. Such a state, when psychological, is expressed by any set of elements that are in the state, un- like non-psychological qualities which may simply qualify the bearer without being ex- pressed by it. A solid thing never shows its solidity by expressing it. The only way any sad thing shows its sadness is by expressing it. Of course, one may retain the quality vocabulary even here, provided he is care- ful about the difference in the logic of talk about "observable surfaces" and their quali- ties on the one hand, and, on the other,</page><page sequence="12">A LDRICH about the "qualities" these are made to ex- press or "show" (realize) by an act of com- position, where a work of art is involved and where the expressed so-called quality is psychological. However, the "realization" vocabulary has the further advantage of accommodating the notion of ex nihilo "creation" in art, while acknowledging the common occurrence of such phrases as "what a composition realizes" in the par- lance of artists and critics. A final comment on the relation of "ob- servable" non-psychological qualities to psychological states in a composition that realizes-and thus "reveals"-the latter by means of the former. The former constitute the "surface" to be "seen into" (Tormey). Making sense of this requires that we recog- nize a bifurcated sort of perception, what I called "prehension." To see y in the observ- able surface (x), one must indeed look at x. But he must not at the same time see x. If he does this, a simple material thing descrip- tion fits what he both looks at and sees. For him to see y in x, the looked at x must efface itself into a point of view on y. It is then an aesthetic object (categorial aspec- tion), and a work of art if it has been com- posed-the result of an act of composition. Such perception is inappropriately called "observation," since what is "observable" suggests what anyone with 20-20 vision can perceive-the material thing with its garden variety properties-and it is precisely this that only "shadows" what is perceived when it undergoes categorial aspection into (func- tions as) an aesthetic object. In fact, it is only when the material thing is perceived as a bit of music, or as a picture, etc. that even (what Tormey calls) the "observable surface" comes under notice, where this is the medium of the material, comprising the elements expressed ("revealed") by the gar- den variety properties of the material thing when perceived as an aesthetic object. The color then is "warm"; it "comes alive" be- side another, it is recessed or protrusive; etc. This is the only sense that "sur-face" can have, in aesthetic parlance. One does not "observe" the surface of the material thing simpliciter while he perceives its "sur- face" as an aesthetic object. The data are different, before and after categorial aspec- tion in the direction of the aesthetic. So, I call the perception involved in aesthetic dis- cernment "prehension," thus distinguishing it from "observation" with its suggestion of routine, work-a-day perceptual encounter with material things as such, in the primary perceptual field. With the notion of "prehending some- thing" goes the notion of its "transfigur- ation." Let the "figure" that a material thing presents in the field of primary perception include behavioral configurations such as de- meanor, etc. I shall say that such figures are transfigured when they express psychological states. This is to say that the figures (or con- figurations) are perceptually effaced in favor of what they express, and that therefore this expressandum does not qualify, is not a quality of, the expressans (figure). But sup- pose the configuration is "of" a face, an "observable" quality of it, and the face is- let us say-of a person. If we say the face is sad, it-not the configuration-is the subject of the psychological predication, and sad- ness is the state it is "in." If, looking at the configurated face, we say the person is sad, the subject of the predication is what is bodied forth by present and subsequent be- havioral configurations involving the whole body, and it is this fact that activates the distinction between stir-face and sub-face ex- hibited above-a distinction that has no foot- hold when the referred to subject is just the face. This gives substance to the notion of "full-bodied" (full-blooded) psychological states that a person is in, as distinguished from such a state that only a face is in. (No sub-face, sur-face here.) The person and the face are sad, but only the person "feels" sad. Yet, this does not mean that sadness simply qualifies the face. The configurations of the face body forth the state it is in. Tley show or express it. Sadness is not an "expressive quality." It is the expressed state that shows what it (the expressans) is in. And this is not a "nature" (quality) in its own right, subject to intensional-extensional conceptu- alization. It is nothing in itself. As for the sadness that a person "feels" without expressing it--unexpressed sadness -nothing more is involved here than that, 214</page><page sequence="13">"Expresses" and "Expressive" in this case, something-the loss of a loved one, e.g.-is prompting him to behavior whose configuration would express (show) sadness, behavior that he inhibits. The sad- ness per se does not move him as the mis- fortune does. Concealed sadness is the dispo- sition, induced by a misfortune, to behavior that expresses it. Such considerations do not apply to a face that expresses sadness. Perception of such "real" cases is a kind of (Ur)-prehension, since it involves look- ing at something to see what is "in" it, iso- morphic with perception in the aesthetic case, but reports of which have no special aesthetic significance on the ground level of primary perception. The reason for this is that it is only in the work of art case that the notion of "real- izing" (Sircello's "capturing") a psychologi- cal state gains a foothold. This presupposes an act of composition, working with ma- terials that may or may not be animate. If animate, we have the dance or stage plays where the materials are the bodies of the performers in configurated action; if inani- mate, the plastic arts, music, literature; where the materials are stone, pigments, in- struments (including voice), verbalisms, and the like. Composing with these, the com- poser "realizes" a world to which consider- ations of existence or non-existence are ir- relevant, because what appears there only "inexists." This is a distinct category. (Cf. Latin in-esse, being in.) "Inexistent" does not mean "nonexistent" or "existent in an elu- sive sense." It applies to what "animates" a material thing via its field of representation and expression. What inexists or appears there is what the thing comes alive with- aesthetic space, the region we "live" in29 while prehending a material thing as an aesthetic object. Some such category is re- quired, if sense is to be made of psychologi- cal phenomena generally, even those not under special aesthetic consideration, as was noted above. It is especially pertinent to the aesthetic case, because there is a sense in which the whole scene including both what is represented (depicted) and what is ex- pressed, is "psychological," where a work of art categorically aspects as an aesthetic ob- ject. 215 In view of this, "realizing" has, in the aes- thetic art case, a wider application than just to what is expressed, where this is contrasted with what is represented. What is "shown" in a work of art comprises what is depicted in it, what this expresses if anything, and the expressive values realized in the medium, of the material. "Shown" here means "ex- pressed," in the more inclusive sense of the latter, such that what is "realized" (created) by an act of composition is wholesale put on exhibit (shown) in the composition's field of representation and expression. The act of composition should not be thought of on Sircello's model of "artistic act," which he takes to be an act of the artist shown in the work of art itself.31 The style of the composition-when not imitative- may indeed betray the artist, his manner of composing. This is not a proper part either of what the composition expresses or repre- sents: it is on the side of what does the expressing and representing from outside the work, by manipulating its material. The mood or attitude of the composition-e.g., aloofness towards (not of) depicted content, as in Poussin's Sabine rape-is shown by the painting, a proper part to be perceived in it as Sircello contends; but this is given by the configurated medium (austere colors, etc.) of the work that makes it function as an affec- tively charged point of view on its content. The artist could manage his materials to get this result in the work without himself being aloof or having managed the materials (painted the picture) "in an aloof manner," whatever that might mean. As for the be- holder, the picture requires only that he be- come aware of the aloof view on the de- picted content, not that he assume the atti- tude or see in the work the aloof way in which the artist did it. The picture functions as an aloof view on the violence depicted in it, if its medium is right for this. A word about an epistemological point. One sees (hears) a sad thing, composition or not. He does not simply see (hear) the sadness per se, as he does see the redness of a red thing. The red thing does not express its color; the sad thing does express its sad- ness. This makes defective Tormey's use of synecdoche. He takes the behavioral con-</page><page sequence="14">A LDRICH figurations expressing jealousy to be proper parts of jealousy, such that seeing the form- er amounts to seeing the latter. His analogy is with seeing the mast of a ship where one can then say he sees a ship, the mast being a proper part of the ship. But there is such a thing as seeing the whole ship. Does jeal- ousy ever come into full view, like that? A ship is a material thing with visible qual- ities. A psychological state is not. What we need here is a notion of visually feeling something (or auditorily), a notion that goes with prehensive perception. I visually feel the warmth of a color, auditorily the forlorn- ness of a note. This is what gives me entree into the medium of any material. Why should I not visually feel and in that sense see the sadness expressed by the configura- tions that efface themselves to reveal the psychological state the thing is in? Of course, if it is a work of art, and a great one, I may at first be blind to the states it expresses, the psychological states that are there to be visually felt by only the insightful (prehen- sive) seer. Anyway, if "there is sadness which is heard and sadness which is seen" (Bouwsma), the concept of auditory and vis- ual perception must be enlarged to accom- modate some such notion as that of getting the visual or auditory feel of the thing in question. "Prehension" does just that. One can sympathize via one's eyes and ears- though one will not console the sad thing if it is an aesthetic object, even if it is a person "sitting" for an expressive portrayal. And, doing this sort of objectively feeling something out by hearing and seeing, the hearer and the seer need not himself be sad when he sees or hears how sad the object is. Surely, this is the way to state this case. Let us in conclusion, consider how a ma- terial thing acquires the status of physical object. I have said that a material thing has its abode in the field or primary perception. Well, there are techniques for dislodging it from that logical place, techniques the appli- cation of which make its perceptible features less and less relevant to the account of it. These features are effaced under "physical analysis" of the material thing, revealing it as a physical object. This consists mainly in metrical determinations placed on it, the aim being to exempt the account of the thing from dependence on perpetual per- spectives. One does not simply see what the diameter of a given sphere is in centimeters, though he may simply (and objectively) see it is bigger than the one beside it.32 The account sought is one that is true of the thing "in itself," its out-of-sight micro-con- stitution and physical field properties. So it becomes the target of the reference of the terms of physical theory, whose referents are not even in the primary perceptual field, though the "observable evidence" for the theory remains there. In this light, the irrelevance of physical object-and-property talk to aesthetic consid- erations is clarified. There is nothing to be seen in a physical object, where "in" is aes- thetically oriented (prehension); first, be- cause it as such is imperceptible; second, be- cause "physical analysis" of a material thing is precisely what strips it of the conditions necessary to its functioning either as a rep- resentation or an expression of anything. One can not "anthropomorphize" vis-a-vis a physical object (Sircello), which is why "human regional qualities" get no foothold here (Beardsley). In this context, all talk employing "expresses," "expressive," and like terms, becomes otiose-or is embarrassed if it continues, leaning lamely on meta- phor for support. 1 Edmund Gurney, "Music as Impressive and Ex- pressive," in Hosper's Artistic Expression (New York, 1917), p. 117. 2Alan Tormey, The Concept of Expression (Princeton, 1917), p. 107. 3Monroe C.
