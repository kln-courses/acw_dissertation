It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of the subject of this book if one is to study at all the thought of what was for ages the largest and</page><page sequence="2">33ο THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES most cultivated nation on the earth. For after the great thinkers of the centuries before Christ, Chu Hsi is often reckoned, if not the greatest, certainly the most brilliant and visibly influential intellect that China has produced. Born on October 18, π 30, he was the last and chiefest of a famous school of natural philosophers—himself and his Masters— of that age. It is pleasant to think that the School and their disciples won respect at the time by the purity of their public and private lives not less than by the ingenuity of their arguments. People might laugh at the high hats of these ' Gentlemen of the Way ', but they reverenced the loftiness of their characters. One cannot but suspect that in their preaching of righteousness these men were very tolerant of doctrinal heresy, and the dying advice of Shao Yung (the first of the ' Masters'), י Make the path before you broad, for if you make it narrow there will not be room enough even for yourselves ; how then can you help others along the road?' must have encouraged that extraordinary effort at reunion (the San han chiao) which for several centuries filled the land with temples in which were images of Buddha, Lao Τζΰ, and Confucius, ranged in that order of precedence. Such influence as Chu Hsi has had was conveyed through his edition of the Classics rather than through his writings on philosophy, helped by certain laws which are supposed to have been largely political in intention. The late Father P. Hoang has stated that at the end of the nineteenth century out of every thousand candidates for degrees only four chose Sung dynasty philosophy as a voluntary subject. That is to say that, at least since the brilliant attacks made upon him by Mao Ch'i-ling in the seventeenth century, Chu Hsi has not been much studied by the more advanced scholars. But, on the other hand, the vast majority of the three or four per cent, of the population who are supposed to have gone to school at all read practically no other book but the Confucian classics with Chu's notes. It is the theories under lying those notes which Dr Bruce here sets himself to explain. Chu Chu Hsi and his Masters is the Introduction to The Philosophy of Human Human Nature in which Dr Bruce translated one of Chu Hsi's philoso phical writings. After a few preliminary pages, we have interesting sketches of the lives of his Masters and of Chu himself, and then follow the analysis and discussion of their theories. These valuable chapters, which are intricate and sometimes difficult reading, are distributed over three parts : the Theory of the Universe, the Doctrine of Human Nature, and the Theistic import of Chu Hsi's Philosophy. Chu Hsi wrote in the simplest of styles, often in common colloquial language. But in a philosopher it is not the grammar so much as the technical terms that matter, and in a language so peculiar as Chinese nothing but long familiarity with the author can give any confidence that his meaning is</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS REVIEWS 331 really understood. It is fortunately just this qualification of familiarity which Dr Bruce evidently possesses after having made the Sung philo sophers his study during a long life in China, and his book is thus a very great contribution to our knowledge of the history of Chinese thought. The conclusion which will excite most interest, as being in contradic tion to the accepted view, is that Chu Hsi believed in and taught a conscious personal God. One had indeed reflected that if Chu was really an atheist he had not much persuaded the masses of his country men who have always believed in God, and now Dr Bruce assures us that he was not so. The phrase ' Heaven is law', which occurs often in the school edition of the classics, is no doubt largely responsible for the belief that Chu reduced 'the God of his fathers to an abstraction' (Giles). The Sung school, as Dr Bruce understands them, were combating the materialistic anthropomorphic ideas of their day, and wished to teach an immaterial and spiritual, but not a dead or unconscious God. 'It is said, "King Wen ascended and descended at the right and left hand of God Now to interpret that statement, as many do in these days, as meaning that King Wen is literally at the right and left hand of God, and that there really is a God like the graven images made by men in the world around us, is clearly incorrect; nevertheless, there is a sense in which what the sacred writer says is true' (p. 295). ' It is wrong to say, as is said in these days, that there is a man in the heavens judging sin, but it is also wrong to say that there is no Ruler at all' (p. 296). ' In the passage which says, " The great God has conferred upon the people below a moral sense the very words " conferred upon" convey the idea of one who exercises authority' (p. 298). A. C. Moule.
