<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chapter IV GERMAN PHILOSOPHY AND THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENTSIA While the writers of the western countries regarded the doctrines of the German nationalist philosophers at the beginning of the 19th century as the dream, alien in spirit, of idealists without decisive political significance, they were differently received among the Rus sian intellectual elite. The most capable representatives of Young Russia in the thirties and forties of the nineteenth century, Vissaryon Bielinsky, born in 1810, Alexander Herzen, born in 1812, and Michael Bakunin, born in 1814, with astonishing insight discovered the ex plosive power lying in the doctrine of Fichte and Hegel. Those Russian adepts of German philosophy looked with contempt on con temporary French mentality. "To hell with the French"—writes Bielinsky—"their influence never brought us anything but harm. We imitated their literature and killed our own. Germany is the Jerusalem of modern humanity." The Hegelianism of the youth, centering in Moscow and described with joking friendliness by Herzen, was a faith rather than a doctrine, a sect rather than a school. Friends would part for whole weeks owing to differences of opinion * concerning Hegel's these. "The most insignificant pamphlets," writes Herzen—"published in Berlin and in other provincial and district towns of Hegel's philosophy, even when there was only a mention of Hegel in them—were ordered and read with such ardor that they fell to pieces in a few days." The young Moscow Hegelians developed a special conventional language. It was a "church-scientific" dialect, the language of the "priests of learning." What attracted the young Russian so strongly to contemporary German philosophy? In the interpretation of the outstanding pub 1057</page><page sequence="2">licist Herzen, Hegel's philosophy was the "algebra of revolution." Herzen spontaneously initiated in Russia the German Hegelian left. Michael Bakunin, later the famous European revolutionary, in his young years studied Fichte, and initiated his colleagues in his theses. One of them, Bielinsky, soon to become a literary critic of radical ieftist political convictions, declared later that following Bakunin's intellectual leadership "he regarded Fichte's philosophy as Robes pierrism and sensed the scent of blood in the new theory." At the same time, there matured mainly in Moscow another group of Russian youth, the later Slavophils: Alexey Khomiakov, I. and K. Aksakov, I. and P. Kireyevsky's, Samarin, Shevyrev, and Valuyev. These men, regarded as belonging to the right, were educated on German philosophy, avidly absorbed the theses of the German nation alists and automatically applied them to their own nation. Between the German philosophical thought of the time, revealing the secret aspirations of the German soul, and the young Russia of both the leftist and rightist trends, there existed an affinity of desires and expectations, not realized by either side. In both countries—although to a larger extent in Russia—there existed the complex of inferiority with regard to the nations of the West, by law of psychology passing automatically into the myth of the superiority of their own nations, the legend o£ a rotten West. As in the seventeenth and eighteenth century in Germany, so in Russia in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the imitation of the nations of the West and admiration of the older culture were combined with distrust, jealousy, and a sense of historical injustice, the Catullian odi et amo. The Russian nation alists regarded the Teutonic world as also belonging to the West; however, they considered Rome the metropolis of the West, the historic capital of Catholicism, and France, the foremost country of Latin culture. Europophobia and the national megalomania of the Russian Slavo phils is reminiscent of the tirades against France of the fanatic German nationalists, of the Napoleonic and later periods, of Jahn, Arndt, Menzel, and others. "In our relations with the West,"— wrote Shevyrev in 1841 in the periodical Moskvitianin, "we have to deal with a man who carries in him a bad infectious illness and spreads a poisonous breath around him. We embrace him, we share with him the food of thought, we drink with him from the cup of sentiment and, associating with him without anxiety, we do not 1058</page><page sequence="3">perceive the secret poison, we do not sense, in the enjoyment of the banquet the future corpse, of which it already smells." The char acteristics of the west are "debauchery of thought and impudence of knowledge." The Slavophile, Valuyev, believed that western societies tend to sham and comfort, paralyze the spirit, and are immersed in moral sybaritism. The Orthodox peoples have done more for Christian truth by their passive, humble inactivity, than the West by its feverish activity. Ivan Kireyevsky taught that Russia possesses inner truth; she always prefers the essence of justice to the letter and form of law, the sacredness of tradition to logical argument, morality to material advantage.1 This is a plain paraphrase of German writers. The inner truth which, according to Kireyevsky, Russia possesses, is the mysterious lnnerlichkeit, which, according to Fichte, only Germany possesses. According to Fichte, the German is a being who is still in the state of becoming and consequently he is capable of development, that is, of achieving perfection, while the type of western man is already crystallized by the long influence of history, and is dying or has even stiffened. This anthithesis appealed very strongly and promisingly to the Russian, who, of course, applied it to his own nation. It raised to the level of exceptional quality Russia's civiliza tional juvenility, and it justified the worship of the Russian element, exuberant and promising unlimited possibilities. "In my eyes you are but the expression of the chaotic fermentation of the elements," Bielinsky writes to Bakunin, in Oct. 1838, and it was that quality which, in spite of other objections and reservations, his friends most appreciated in Bakunin. Slowly, out of the chaotic clash of the elemental forces in Bakunin's soul, one dominating characteristic was coming to the fore. In his "confession" submitted to the Tsar, Nicholas I, during his stay in prison, Bakunin called this characteristic by name: "the demon of destruction was in me." * * * In his famous novel, Dostoyevsky presents a whole gallery of demons among the young generation of Russians. A whole group of men was subject to the characteristic feeling of expecting catas trophe. Admirers attributed his special talent for describing this 1 Jan Kucharzewski. From White to Red Tsardom (in Polish) Vol. I, pp. 276, 277, 336, 337, 340, 341. Vol. II, p. 15. 1059</page><page sequence="4">spiritual state to the fact that he was himself to a large extent subject to it. It is well known that his chiliastic sentiment of foreboding and desiring a great revolution and a new era of mankind was charac teristic also of the coryphaei of modern German philosophy. A man desirous of revolution which is to destroy the existing state of affairs, feels around him a general expectation of the great crisis. After having emigrated from Russia in the autumn of 1840, Bakunin wrote in October 1842, after a two years' stay in Berlin an article in Arnold Ruge's Deutsche Jahrb/icher, about "Reaction in Ger many." There he wrote: "All nations and all classes are filled with anxious forebodings and everybody whose vital organs are not par alyzed looks with a thrill of expectation into the approaching future which will bring the word of salvation." "Even in Russia, this immense snow-covered state which we know so little, and which is perhaps destined to play a great role in the future, there gather dark clouds heralding a storm." "The air is sultry, heavy with storms and therefore I appeal to our blinded brothers: "Be contrite, the kingdom of God approaches, let us trust in the eternal spirit which crushes and destroys only because it is the incomprehensible and eternally creative source of all life. The passion for destruction is at the same time a creative passion." This is chiliastic language. We have found this sentiment among the coryphaei of German philosophy as early as the eighteenth century. In both countries there was a belief among the heralds of the new era that their own nation, German or Russian, had the mis sion of achieving this revolution and leading humanity on this new road as the chosen people. In Germany, as well as in Russia the urge for destruction, revolutionary messianism, and extremism of aims and means are manifested. In the political sphere, there is either anarchy or despotism. "Russia will never be the juste-milieu" exclaims Herzen in an open letter to Michelet. In January 1847, Herzen went abroad, never to return home. He continued to await the desired revolution, and he soon began to write his most outstanding work, From the Other Shore. The first chapter was written in Italy at the end of 1847, and its background is the pre monition of the approaching historical upheaval. "The world in which we live is dying. It should be buried so that our heirs may breathe more freely, and yet people want to cure it 1060</page><page sequence="5">and stop death. We live in a world which has lost reason, decrepid and exhausted." In February 1848, revolution broke out in Paris, in March in Austria, Prussia, and other German lands. The hopes of Herzen and of his friends grew, but ended in disappointment. In the chapter of his work, written at that time in the form of a dialogue between the author and a revolutionary conservative, the author says: "Proclaim the news of death, show to people each new wound in the breast of the old world, each progress of destruction; point out that it cannot recover, that it has no support, nor belief in itself . . . Proclaim death as the good news of the approaching redemption." The revolutionary conservative in whose person Herzen ironically presents a western-European revolutionary demands from him an answer to the question, what should be created after the destruction ? Herzen's reply was: "destruction creates, cleans space, and this already is creation, it eliminates a number of lies, and this is already truth." Since 1848, at first in Bohemia and then in Saxony, Bakunin had made preparations to stir up revolution, not the kind of which the European conservative revolutionaries were capable, but revolution destroying and overthrowing the contemporary political and social system by means of iron revolutionary dictatorship. Bakunin's bolshevik biographer Stieklov, calls Bakunin's revolutionary plan a colossal historical prophecy because in its character it was akin to the future bolshevik revolution in Russia. With Bakunin's participation, there occured in the beginning of May, of 1849, an uprising in Dresden, which Bakunin intended to be the prologue to a universal revolution in Europe. This rising was quelled within a few days by Saxon and Prussian troops. Bakunin complained of the half-hearted ness of the German revolutionaries and derided the lack of any real spirit of destruction in contemporary Germany. There exists a story repeated by Herzen that when the Prussian troops approached revolted Dresden, Bakunin suggested that the Sixtine Madonna be placed on the city walls, and stated that the Germans would be too classically educated to shoot a Raphael. Russian emigres later asked Bakunin whether he would have given the same advice, if Russian troops had been approaching the city. "Oh, no,"—replied Bakunin. "The Russian would not only shoot at Raphael's Madonna, but at the Mother of God herself, if his superiors give him the order. It would be a crime to use such a means against Russian troops with 1061</page><page sequence="6">their Cossacks—you would not be able to protect the people, and you would destroy Raphael." If Bakunin's characterization of the German army of 1849 was something more than a joke or deception, that army has made tremendous progress in liberating itself from the fetters of classical education during the period of almost a century which separates us from the Dresden rising of 1849- It should, however, be assumed that Bakunin was under the spell of the myth of Germany, placing knowledge and art above everything else, to which almost the entire contemporary Europe was subject, with the exception of a few clairvoyants such as Edgar Quinet and Heinrich Heine. On May 10, 1849, Bakunin was imprisoned and for a number of years eliminated from participation in the revolutionary movement. On December 2, 1851, there took place the coup d'etat of Louis Napoleon. Herzen welcomed it with words of encouragement and hope: the logic of extremists—the worse it is the better. In a letter written from Nice at the close of 1851, Herzen welcomes the approaching New Year: "Vive la mort, friends, Happy New Year. Let us now be consistent. Let us be strong and persist in our convictions. For a long time, we have seen the approaching death. We have been called ominous ravens and we were guilty only of truth and of professing it openly. At last this world of appearances, decrepid, obsolete, disintegrating, ambiguous, insincere, attaining falsehood and a confusion of all conceptions, has collapsed like everything that loses its mind . . . the vile twilight has passed . . . the dark night which we expected came. We are a step nearer to the morning." He had a presentiment of an approaching international war. "All Europe will become unhinged and will be drawn into a universal pogrom; the boundaries of countries will be changed, nations will combine in other unions, nationalities will be crushed and humiliated. . . . Europe will look somewhat like Bohemia after the Hussites. And then on the brink of ruin and defeat, a second war—a civil war will start." "The contemporary political existence will perish with its civiliza tion and will be, in Proudhon's polite expression, liquidated." * * * At that time a characteristic change took place in Herzen's views. He who, while in Russia, was permeated with the sense of Russia's 1062</page><page sequence="7">inferiority to the West, now deviated considerably from his western izer's enthusiasm. In autumn of 1851, Michelet published in the periodical Evenement his "Legend of Kosciuszko" written in beauti ful language, full of ardent sympathy for Poland. In this work he voiced a stern accusation against Russia of Nicholas I, the oppressor of Poland. Herzen answered from Nice with an open letter. He defended Russia and at the same time expressed the belief that Russia would regenerate disintegrated, decrepid Europe. He idealized the defects of Russia, her primitiveness, and civilizational juvenility, and on these negative characteristics, he built the theory of Russian revolutionary messianism. Herzen's optimism concerning Russia, coupled with his pessimism concerning the future of the West, throws a ray of light on the origin and the characteristics of the Russian revolution from the time of the first formulation of its aspirations by its great theorist. We are faced with the legend of the rotten West in a revolutionary edition. Herzen believed that the period most difficult for Russia came to an end. The great question, to be or not to be, would soon be decided for Russia. Not so long before, Herzen dreamed of the europeanization of Russia. Later this thought might have appeared to him naive. Ex Oriente lux. It was Russia who was to settle accounts with the old world and regenerate humanity. He then boldly and with a sense of pride spoke about Russia's barbarism as if speaking of the simplicity of the fishermen of Galilea, bringing the good news to the world. "With growing anxiety everybody asks himself the question"—wrote Herzen in his letter to Michelet—"whether old Europe—this decrepid Proteus, this disintegrating organism, will have enough strength for regeneration. Indeed, this is a terrible question!" "Will old Europe be able to rejuvenate its senile blood, and throw itself into this untraversed future to which the road leads, perhaps through the ruins of the house of the fathers, through the decay of all civilization, through the trampled treasures of modern en lightenment ?" The heritage of civilization will become for Europe an obstacle for making a radical revolution. "Amid this chaos, amid this last agony of fear and tormenting regeneration, amid this world falling into ruin around the cradle, the eye spontaneously turns towards the east." 1063</page><page sequence="8">"There like a dark mountain looming in the mist appears a hostile threatening state; at times it seems that it approaches Europe like an avalanche, like an impatient heir ready to accelerate its slow death." Europe knows the history of the Tsars. But knowing nothing about the nation, the most contradictory opinions are circulated about it in Europe. "There is something tragic in this senile absent mindedness with which the old world confuses all information about its adversary." Herzen turns to the times of ancient Rome for a comparison. "At that time also on the eve of an upheaval and of the victory of the barbarians, were proclaimed the eternity of Rome, the impo tent madness of the Nazarenes, and the futility of the movement which was beginning in the barbarian world." In his tirades on Russia's revolutionary messianism, Herzen com pares the Russians either to the barbarians who destroyed the Roman Empire, or to the Nazarenes. Thanks to her civilizational juvenility, Russia is more capable than the nations of the West to lead humanity in the destruction of the decaying world. In the Russian soul, there exists a terrible power of negation, a great destructive force does not recoil from anything. "A thinking Russian is the most independent man in the world" —says Herzen—What can stop him? Respect for the past? What is the point of departure for the history of modern Russia, if it is not the negation of nationality and tradition?" "On the other hand, the past of the western nations serves as a lesson for us. We by no means regard ourselves as the testamentary executors of their will. We share your doubts but your faith does not inspire us. We share your hatred, but we do not understand your attachment to the heritage of the ancestors. We are too oppressed, too unhappy to be satisfied with half freedom. You are bound by scruples, you are stopped by mental reservations; we have neither scruples nor reservations. We only lack strength. . . ." Thus we have an early and sincere prediction of what will happen when the new Russia becomes aware of her strength. "In our life"—continues Herzen "there indeed is something crazy, but there is nothing banal, immobile, bourgeois. Do not accuse us of immorality because we do not respect what you respect. Can one reproach a foundling because he does not respect his parents? We are independent, because we start life anew. We are independent 1064</page><page sequence="9">because we do not possess anything. We have almost nothing to love. All our memories are permeated with bitterness." "What do your traditional duties concern us, the younger disin herited brothers ? What respect can be inspired in us by your Roman barbarian legality, that clumsy building without light and air, slightly repaired in the Middle Ages, and redecorated by the enfranchised bourgeoisie? I agree that the daily robbery in the Russian courts is still worse, but it does not result from this that justice exists in your courts and laws."2 * * * The western nations which did not comprehend the alarming essence of German psychology understood still less the inevitable characteristics of the Russian soul. In Caesar's time, Rome knew Gaul better than present day Europe knows Russia—were the words of Herzen. Is it different a hundred years later? Another profound interpreter of the Russian soul Dostoyevsky, presented a whole gallery of types drawn from nature, who dream about the destruction of present civilization built by other, older nations, and the construction of a new world by revolutionary Russia. In The Demons, Peter Verkhovensky, in an ecstatic rapture, draws for Stavrogin the picture of the future revolution: "And the storm will begin. A commotion will come such as the world has not yet witnessed. And the earth will groan, and the sea will move and the whole ramshackle business will fall to pieces. And then we shall think how to build a stone structure. For the first time, we, we alone shall build." Do the sentiments and plans of the present German demons diverge much from these weird visions ? There is a strange crossing and interpenetration of mutual influence among the two nations. Also, the type of nihilist seen in Russia and described with genius by Ivan Turgenev more than eighty years ago, today exuberantly flour ishes in Germany, called by the same name by Rauschning. The analogy between the two nations goes further and deeper. In both, there are strong inner antinomies of national character, resulting from unharmonized heterogeneity of historical influences. In Russia, there are native, ancient elements, Tartar-Mongolian, Byzantine and European influences; in modern political organization, 2 From White to Red Tsardom, Vol. I, pp. 349, 383, 388, 390-396. Vol. II, pp. 188-197. 1065</page><page sequence="10">German influence predominates, in mentality and literature from the 18th century on, French and German influences. Anatol Leroy-Beau lieu in his three volume work "L'Empire des Tsars," written towards the end of the third quarter of the 19th century during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, states that educated Russia belongs to the eighteenth century, while the uneducated one to the fifteenth and possibly even the thirteenth century. However, in the sphere of in stincts, impulses, and the subconscious, there is no such distance of epochs between the two classes of the nation, the deeper features of the national character of both classes are rooted in the distant past. Consequently, the same author, correcting as it were his thesis in his latest study about the reign of Alexander III, during which the nationalist elements clearly took the upper hand, says that Russia is still in the period of Spain, under the reign of Isabel of Castile, that is, at the close of the 15th century. The age-old crossing of European and Asiatic influences creates Eurasia. In Germany there is a constant vivid antinomy, unharmonized in ternally, between civilization taken from Romance nations and the ancient barbarian existence. Heine perceived, in the middle of the nineteenth century, that the Middle Ages were still a living force in Germany. Beside that, as is clearly demonstrated by the evolution of the German nation in the 19th century, European and Asiatic influ ence also crossed there; and, as is stated by F. W. Foerster, these were not the Asiatic influences of Buddha and Confucius, but those of Genghis-Khan, with unlimited despotism, equality in slavery, and the overwhelming preponderance of the human mass over the in dividual.3 In one of his interviews, Hitler stated that the western nations would better understand Germany if they would bear in mind how close she is to Asia. In another conversation, he placed Ghenghis Khan above Napoleon I. There is also a German Eurasia. The antinomy of national character is not only manifested by the fact that the life of a nation embraces two epochs, and that the edu cated class lives a modern life while the uneducated class lives a mediaeval existence; but also in the more profound dualism, in the inner rift of the individual soul, eloquently described, as far as Germany is concerned, by Holderlin, confirmed in the well-known verse of Faust about the two souls living in one breast, and once 3 F. W. Foerster. Europe and the German Question. New York, Sheed and Ward. 1940, p. 390. io66</page><page sequence="11">again corroborated by Nietzsche's aphorism about more than two souls simultaneously existing in the German being. The myth of the chosen people, always combined with the desire of extending its territory and its blessed domination on neighboring nations and subsequently on further countries of the globe, results in regarding the conquest of another country as a real advantage for that country, in fact, as its liberation. The participation of Prussia in Poland's partition has been regarded in this light by German historians, and also by the majority of the German speakers in the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. The fiction of liberating countries, conquered by means of war, is then advanced as a watchword and the masses of soldiers marching on to the conquest of another coun try believe with brutal simplicity in the liberating mission of the bloody campaign. In a book published in the first World War, La Russie et la Guerre a well-known Russian politician and writer, Gregory Alexinsky, men tions the following details. At the beginning of that war, a Russian non-commissioned officer is treated in a hospital at Erivan in the Caucasus, in the vicinity of the Turkish border. He writes poems, looking out on the biblical mount Ararat looming on the horizon, situated in Turkish territory. A passage in the poem reads: "Mount Ararat looks lost in thoughts. It seems to be waiting to be liberated by us." The hospital surgeon who learned about the poetic visions of the patient said: "Yes, indeed, the idea of liberating is very popular among our soldiers."4 The countries placed by an evil fate between two nations possessed by the demon of liberating their neighbors from independent exist ence, are under the constant threat of bilateral liberation. The bene ficent conqueror liberates the country in advance from the yoke which could be imposed by the neighbor on the other side, or from the allegedly bad, reactionary government of the annexed country. And when the object of liberation does not manifest appropriate gratitude and answers its saviors with the ancient formula "I want neither your honey nor your sting," the rival conquerors clasp hands and divide the ungrateful country. Each of the conquerors even then liberates the part allotted to him and claims the gratitude of the victim for having saved at least half of the country from the yoke of the other dangerous neighbor. 4 Gregoire Alexinsky. La Russie et la Guerre. Paris, 1915, pp. 282, 283. 1067</page><page sequence="12">It should be mentioned that the countries suffering from national megalomania have writers who submit the national defects to biting criticism. It is difficult to go any further in the criticism of Tsarist Russia than Chaadayev, Herzen, Shchedrin-Saltykov, Dobrolubov, Pisarev, and Tkacheff have gone. Sometimes the propagators of megalomania themselves pass through lucid intervals and tell bitter things to their countrymen. We do not know whether the Berlin public, listening to Fichte's dithyrambs about the German nation and leaving the lecture rooms exalted in national spirit, knew that philosophers aphorism of 1803: "The Berlin public is so unspeakably contemptible that it can well be likened to the swine in the Gospel."5 * * * It is frequently said that unexpectedly for the rest of the world, Germany in the nineteenth century passed from the cult of idealistic philosophy and the predilection for metaphysical research to the practical cult of material force, to militarism, industrialism, and the contempt for any kind of idealism in life. In reality, this transi tion had begun much earlier than Europe perceived it, and matured gradually. The penetrating Edgar Quinet perceived this internal process as early as in the autumn of 1831, and pointed it out in his famous article of January 1, 1832, "De l'Allemagne et de la Revolu tion," indicating at the same time the significant motives of that transformation: "The general reaction which burst forth today in Germany against philosophy is not derived from the hatred of the principles in themselves, but from a sort of fear which people there have of falling back under the spell of contemplative life." The turning to practical, material tasks, which in public life found expression in the Custom's Union, was coupled with a turning in the theoretical sphere from idealistic philosophy to the materialistic doctrine. Philosophical idealism, in harmony as it were with the principle of Hegel's dialectic, passed into its antithesis—the theory of materialism; but the third stage—the synthesis—never occurred. In 5 German versus Hun by Carl Brinitzer and Berthe Grossbard, translated by Bernard Miall. London. George Allen and Unwin Ltd. 1941, p. 94. A large number of stinging expressions is to be found in Goethe's works. Let us take as significant the prophetic curse put more than a hundred years ago on the future dictator: "Cursed be he who ill-advisedly and arrogantly now does as a German that which the French Corsican did. In spite of power and effort he and his fare ill." "Verflucht sei, wer nach falschen Rat—mit iiberfrechten Mut—Das, was der Corse-Franke tat—Nun als ein Deutscher tut. . . .Ihm geht es trotz Gewalt und Miih—Ihm und den Seinen schlecht." Still more violent tirades are to be found in Schopenhauer. io68</page><page sequence="13">this way was manifested the extremism, peculiar to the German mind.6 German mentality was long connected in general opinion with the cult of idealistic philosophy, to such an extent that even the pene trating Heine declared in his book about Germany, written in 1835, that philosophical materialism which developed in 17th century England and in 18th century pre-revolutionary France would remain foreign to German mentality: "Germany has always shown a dis like of materialism and has been for a century and a half the true seat of idealism." The French preparing for the revolution—wrote Heine—needed an axe and a materialist philosophy no less cold and sharp than it. Heine believed that when the time would come for the German revolution, it would not be preceded by the appear ance of materialism but would result directly from transcendental idealism and the philosophy of nature.7 About the middle of the nineteenth century, there appeared, to use Treitschke's expression, a materialistic intoxication, ein material is tischer Rausch. "Half-educated, and to a certain extent also edu cated people over-estimated the great transformation because every new idea in order to be able to pave the way for itself, must be at first over-estimated.8 The young generation turned away from the idealistic philosophers. Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity (Das Wesen des Chris tentums) ; Biichner's Force and Matter (Kraft und Stoff) ; Vogt's Superstition and Knowledge (Kohlerglaube und Wissenschaft); Moleschott's Cycle Of Life (Kreislauf des Lebens), took hold of their minds. The transition from idealism to materialism took place under the leadership of the so-called Hegelian left. Its leading representative Ludwig Feuerbach came to be regarded by the enthu siasts of materialism as a Moses who led German thought out of the Egyptian slavery of idealism into the promised land of materialism. The intellectual materialist revolution was enthusiastically re ceived by contemporary young Russia. It was the period of spring in 6 "The German mind oscillated between materialism and idealism, two poles between which it is in perpetual recurrence. In this antinomic philosophy which never main tains its syntheses, the third term always fails." Doctrinaire idealism did not strike roots in German practical life. It was like a fiery rocket which shoots high into the sky, falls to the ground, and dies out. Gonzague de Reynold. D'ou vient I'Allemagne. Paris. Librairie Plon. 5mille. 1939, pp. 55. 7 H.

In that period, there crystallized all trends of the Russian revolutionary movement, which in its ul timate result led to the fall of Tsardom. The young generation feverishly revised old beliefs, views, theories, traditions, and authori ties. It was the period in which Ivan Turgenev perceived the emerging figure of the nihilist and maximalist whom he artistically recreated in the character of Bazarov, the hero of the novel "Fathers and Chil dren." In the act of destroying the signpost left by the past, embracing ever-growing circles of the young generation, the theories of the materialists became the guiding stars. The well-known writer, Longin Panteleyev, who enrolled in the University of St. Petersburg in 1858, describes almost half a century later how the influence of materialism spread to the youth of different convictions and left durable, indelible marks. "One beautiful day (and this was in my second year) Biichner's Force and Matter in a lithographic translation burst into our midst like a real bombshell. All read it with great enthusiasm and in everyone the remnants of traditional beliefs vanished at once. The ideas of Biichner and Feuer bach at once took hold of Russian minds and no efforts of the later reaction could restore to the people the naive beliefs of the past."9 Russian youth did not realize that the ground for the reception of the materialist doctrine was prepared by centuries of despotism which stifled the spirit and implanted dislike of it. There was some one who did more for the success of materialism in Russia than Feuerbach and Biichner. Let us listen to the words of the historian Sergey Solovyev, about the reign of Nicholas I. "The colossal figure of Nicholas personified that depth of materialism which now stifles Russia's spiritual development."10 Zaytsev, the contributor to the paper "The Russian Word," con sidered an organ of the nihilists, said later: "We were deeply con vinced that we were fighting for the happiness of all mankind and each one of us would gladly go to the scaffold and give his head for Moleschott and Darwin." "Materialism became a sort of ruling 9Memories Of The Vast (in Russian), Volume I., pp. 53-56, 58. 10European Courier (a Russian Monthly), 1907, Vol. Ill, May-June, S. M.

According to Chernyshevsky, there was no thinker since the time of Spinoza with such powerful ideas as feuerbach. Feuerbach's philosophy presents a radical criticism of religion, idealistic metaphysics, and traditionalism, and passes by means of unexpected turns of thought from cosmological and psycho physiological disquisitions to revolutionary conclusions in the field of politics and sociology. Written in picturesque, incisive, glaring language, it proclaims the necessity of revolutionary action and it gave Chernyshevsky a providential philosophical basis for the justi fication of revolutionary sentiments and tendencies, by which he and almost the whole younger generation was animated.12 The criticism of religion is the point of departure, the criticism of philosophical idealism is the next stage, while the knowledge of man conceived materialistically, anthropologically in the general sense, is the main foundation of Feuerbach's philosophy. The chief thesis of Feuerbach's philosophy is atheism. According to him, the concept of God arises out of the anthropomorphic way of human thinking. Man, combining in his mind the qualities which he con siders as virtues, creates the conception of a being possessing these virtues in the highest degree. Having created the image of such a being in his imagination, man ascribes objective existence to it, puts it above himself and above the world as the creator, the lord of creation, God, and worships it. It was not God who created man, Feuerbach claims, but man created God. The absolute spirit, this god of the idealists, is a similar product of human imagination. Theology is the expression of faith in the phantoms of imagination, 11 S. Stepniak.

The real object of knowl edge is man, anthropos, studied objectively as a unity, an entity, real, living man. (Der wirkliche Mensch auf der Grundlage der Natur.) Feuerbach's anthropologism, with atheism as its point of depar ture, constituted a destructive weapon which was bound to have great attraction for Chernyshevsky. Feuerbach's criticism of religion and of philosophical idealism contained an element which was revolu tionary for all spheres of life: inherent in it was the idea that all authorities, traditions, and dogmas spontaneously hated by young Russia form a yoke which man himself through a peculiar aberration of thought puts on his neck, and which consequently he may shake off when the delusion vanishes. For the generation which had a nihilist attitude toward tradition and the authorities of its native country, this was spiritual liberation. However, the critical destructive aspect of Feuerbach's philosophy would not be sufficient for Cherny shevsky to recognize him as his universal master. Feuerbach's philos ophy is imbued with a tendency which appealed very strongly to contemporary Russian minds. It is a political and social extremism of a socialist and communist hue, as the author says himself, though what he means by communism is collectivism. Feuerbach believes that the moral and intellectual nature of man is not manifested in the individual but in collectivity.13 In Feuerbach's philosophy, the real man (Der wirkliche Mensch) proved to be not an individual man but the social, collective man, der Gemeinmensch. Consequently, the very conception of man leads to collectivism. Another factor also, nature, leads to it. The study of nature, according to Feuerbach, leads to the conclusion that human laws have artificially and arbitrarily introduced inequality.14 One more ramification of Feuerbach's theory leads to socialism. The human organism, the seat of the soul, maintains its existence by means of nourishment, and man's nourishment determines his spirituality. Der Mensch ist, was er isst—Man is what he eats—is Feuerbach's aphorism. Feuerbach compares contemporary mankind 13 "Das Wesen des Menschen ist nur in der Gemeinschaft, in der Einheit des Menschen mit dem Menschen enthalten." 14 In a review of Moleschott's study, Science of Foodstuffs for the People written in 1850, Feuerbach writes: "The natural scientist does not only become democrat but also socialist and communist, of course only in the reasonable and general sense of this word." 1072</page><page sequence="17">with a certain female offender, who said in court that her evil thoughts came from the stomach. All these ideas presented in an aphoristic form and reducing moral and intellectual matters to one problem, the social, strongly impressed young Russia. In his customary manner, Feuerbach throws a bridge of aphorism from the thoughts and feelings of the human mass to collective action, to practice. Theory is what is contained in an individual head, while what stirs the minds of the mass becomes practice. Knowledge itself does not solve the riddles of life. Does it result from this that one has to resort to faith? No. One should pass from theory to practice. "Doubts which are not solved by theory, are solved by practice." What should be the object of that practice or the propaganda of ideas in the masses ? A new epoch which can be introduced only by means of a radical break with the past. "Humanity, if it desires to start a new epoch, must absolutely break with the past, it must recog nize that what has existed so far is nothing." Such a formula of obliterating the past was bound to touch strongly the nihilist cord of the Russian soul. Atheism, the mass instead of the human individual, the complete destruction of the past, and— on this levelled ground—the construction of something new. The destruction of the political and social system was not yet within the power of the revolutionaries, and it was necessary to postpone that part of the task for half a century. The destruction of religion among the enlightened classes, however, was begun at once and with good results. The struggle against religion was, according to Stepniak-Krawczynski, "neither long nor stubborn." "Victory was achieved at once, for there is no country in the world where religion was so feebly rooted in the enlightened class as in Russia . . . Christianity collapsed like an old half-ruined building . . . Materialism became as it were, the dominant religion of the enlightened class."15 In reality, the building fell not owing to old age but as the result of the lack of- a strong foundation. In the west it was older, and yet it sustained many other attacks in addition to materialism. If the nihilists were the first to find it half-dilapidated, who, before them, had contributed considerably to that ruin? Those who deprived the Russian Church of its independence and dignity, and made it bless and besprinkle acts of official nihilism with holy water.

"It began with the dispute concerning the existence of God, which is a subject that had for the Russian intelligentsia a great secular interest." He extensively describes the religious belief entertained by his environ ment. These were a mass of savage superstitions and inanimate ritual and it was difficult to perceive the idea and light of Christianity behind the dense mist of the survivals of ignorance and paganism. "A mixture of half-Christian, half-barbarian conceptions constituted the faith of the majority of the people in our environment." Atheism was becoming a spontaneous tendency of minds brought up since childhood in the atmosphere of such a religion. "In that period we looked at each liberal man, on each bold speech, on each new book, primarily from the point of view of our militant atheism, through which we lived as a harmonious and joyous family of people of one thought and one faith. . . . The legal Russian translation of Vogt and Moleschott, the illegal translations of Feuerbach and Biichner and for those knowing foreign languages, the originals, were the subject of our constant readings and discussions."17 * * * Nihilism, whose sources lay in the historical conditions of Tsarist Russia, was consolidated on the theoretical basis of materialism, left durable traces in Russian minds and formed the real spiritual founda tion of the doctrines and sentiments of the later Russian revolution. In the reflections of the post-revolutionary Russian emigres, we find inter esting comparisons of nihilism with bolshevism, on the basis of the dogmatic negation and trampling of everything that does not agree with the professed rule, common to both trends. "Bolshevism is in separably linked in the psychological chain with nihilism—we read in the well-known collective book Smiena Vyekh The Change of Sign posts—not in the sense that there is nothing absolute for man, but 16 Archive of the Russian Revolution, Vol. XI, pp. 178. 17 N.

But soon the native spirit, genius loci, began to penetrate German materialistic philos: ophy, as it had done with idealism, and to bend it to its tendencies. This was more in harmony with the nature of materialism than with the nature of idealism. Directly after Germany's triumph over France, there was published in 1872 the book of David Frederick Strauss, combining cosmological materialism based on darwinism with an ardent faith in the newly created Reich of the Hohenzollerns. The aged author, who in his youth published "The Life of Jesus," makes in the first part of his new book "Old and New Faith" an atheistic confession of faith, while in the second part he not only defends the Reich, but also the class system of society, speaks in favor of maintaining capital punishment, and denounces socialism, so dear to the Russian materialists and so disliked by Bismarck. Strauss' whole political and social program is thus imbued with worship for the existing German reality and permeated with practical ma terialism. The enjoyment of material and cultural goods in the united homeland, joy in Germany's power, the search for consolation after having lost faith in God and in the life beyond, in wealth, German culture, and art, is the canon of the new faith bringing with it joy of life. "Thus, we live and wander about happily," is used by the author as a slogan. The book had a tremendous success and at the close of 1872, a fourth edition appeared. As Hegel clothed the worship of Frederick Wilhelm Ill's Prussian monarchy in the terms of idealistic philosophy, so Strauss paid tribute to the newly-created Germany of Wilhelm I with materialistic phraseology.19 18 Smiena Wyekh.

This sentence strikes us with its pertinence; however, we hesitate to ascribe the merit of its pertinence to its author, because we find it almost literally in Rudolf Stammler's work, Wirtschajt und Recht, published in 1896. Stammler applied it to the materialistic conception of history. "The materialistic conception of history was inclined toward the frequent mistake of empiricism which did not lie in the fact that it does not set an absolute, but in the fact that it assumes experience itself to be absolute and unconditional."

If one assumes philosophical materialism as the theoretical foundation and consequently egoism as the main motive of human behavior, absolutist rule will be the only way to build and maintain the state. In the history of modern thought there exists an attempt to base the science of state and society on philosophical materialism, an attempt made by a consistent mind not recoiling from any conclusions which result logically from the principle assumed as the foundation. It is Hobbes' Leviathan. According to Hobbes, in the state of nature (status naturalis) man knows only egoism, strives for his own advantage and pleasure, and does not know any social instinct. Liberty, therefore, left to man, leads to the struggle of all against all. The emergence from this state of nature which is a state of chaos, the law of brute force, can only be achieved through man's renunciation of his natural rights (renunciatio) and through transferring them to the ruler, standing above all (translatio) .20 There arises the state, the great Leviathan, the mortal God (deus mortalis), which has absolute power over man. Among all form of government, Hobbes favors absolutism. In his book Strauss did not reach the ultimate conclusions resulting from the doctrine. His directions were as far from the maximalism expressed by Hobbes as was the Second Reich, which he glorified, rather distant with regard to integral despotism from the dictator ships which began to arise in some European countries, towards and after the end of the first World War. Only this state totalitarianism fulfils the ideal of Leviathan, placing at the head of states the mortal god—deus mortalis—and treating the citizen as a human machine, Uhomme machine, to use a term which forms the title of another famous materialistic treatise published in 1748, by the Frenchman De La Mettrie. That author, who draws extremist and glaring con clusions from the theory of materialism, was towards the end of his life the court reader of Frederick II, King of Prussia, who, after de La Mettrie's death in 1751, wrote a eulogy—Eloge of him. 20 Hobbes' views are presented in his main works: Leviathan, 1651 in English, 1670 in Latin; De Corpore 1655; De Homirte, 1658.
