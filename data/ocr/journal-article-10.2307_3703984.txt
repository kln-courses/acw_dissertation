SPM</page><page sequence="2">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S3 ISEE 2000 Conference Theme The purpose of the meeting is to bring together distinguished scientists from throughout the world to exchange ideas and methods for cutting edge research in the field of environmental health, The conference is open to epidemiologists, information scientists specializing in geographic information systems, laboratory and engineering environmental scientists, toxicologists, and representatives from world, country and state public health agencies. This year, our overall theme is Environmental Epidemiology in Pan-America and the World: Building Connections. The major goals of the conference are to: 1) showcase the ongoing interdisciplinary, international epidemiologic research; 2) provide a forum to discuss how to facilitate more international collaboration in research and training; 3) discuss the driving forces for Building Connections: Goals and Resources; 4) highlight emerging global environmental health issues; 5) exchange the latest scientific findings and methodological approaches for a wide spectrum of environmental exposures and related health outcomes; 6) discuss the organization and administrative support for stronger and effective ISEE Chapters in Latin America, the Caribbean, Central America, Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. The format involves symposia on specific topics for which world experts are invited to present the state of the science; contributed paper sessions organized around both the themes represented by the symposia and other fields within environmental epidemiology; and poster sessions also reflecting a broad range of topics. Some meetings also have included seminar/round table sessions that are less formal and may be used to elicit more participation in discussion of either a newly emerging concern, or one for which new ideas are needed. In addition, sessions will be offered dealing with epidemiologic database management using web-based technologies and geographic information systems in environmental health research, case- crossover research designs in environmental epidemiology and Interamerican Network of HealthTn Housing Centers. Presentation formats: The Conference was organized to include a combination of plenary speakers, specific topics related to the conference theme, a variety of symposia, contributed paper sessions and poster sessions. The sessions will vary in size from large single meetings to smaller meetings of from 10 to 50 participants in appropriately sized rooms in the conference hotel. Symposia and contributed paper sessions will run 90 minutes, allowing for six 15-minute presentations. A few special 120-minute symposia are included. Complementary contributed paper/poster sessions were organized. Oral presentations can be done using Microsoft PowerPoint (preferred), but 35mm slide and overhead projectors will be available.

These systems enable the epidemiologist to develop and manage computerized surveys replacing paper forms. S3 is designed for self-administration by the participant. S3 Remote is designed as an interviewer controlled process using the web systems to design and manage the survey with data acquisition away from the web using the Pilot computer. Examples of survey instruments relevant in environmental health investigations will be presented and the attendees will develop new examples to illustrate the process. At the conclusion of the workshop, attendees will have developed survey instruments for use in their individual research using the S3 system. The workshop will be offered Saturday, August 19 from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm, lunch will be provided. A maximum of 25 attendees are anticipated. The workshop is $ 250 for those who register by July 1st and $350 for those who register by August 1st. No registrations will be accepted after August 1st. Faculty: John H.R.

HUSAIN. RASTOGI S, GUPTA B, MATHUR N. Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical. EMail: tanv99@yahoo.com To evaluate the long-term effects of metal dusts on the bronchopulmonary system and the synergistic effect of cigarette smoke, a comparative study of spirometric measurements in 104 polishers and 90 unexposed controls was carried out in 25 brass and steelware polishing industries at Moradabad in northern India. The two groups were comparable in terms of age, height, smoking habit and socio-econimic status. A total of 58.6% of the polishers had one or more respiratory symptoms, compared to only 25.5% of the controls (P&lt; 0.05). Chronic cough was present in 21 polishers (20.2%) as compared to 11.1% ofthe controls. However, this difference was insignifi- cant. Chronic phlegm was nearly three times as frequent among the polishers as among the controls (17.5% vs 4.4%) (P&lt; 0.005). The prevalence of dyspnoea of varying grades was also significantly higher (16.3% as opposed to 4-4%) among the exposed groups. Chronic bronchitis (6.7%) and poc- cupatiional asthma (4.8%) were found to be confined to polishers. The polishers also experienced acute respiratory symptoms during the work shift. The prevalence of acute respiratory symptoms was recorded for cough in 19 workers (44.1%) foilowed by dyspnoea in 14 workers (32.5%) and throat irritation in 11 workers (25.5%). Comparison ofthe mean values of pulmo? nary function parameters in the polishers and the controls showed significant differences in the smoking and non-smoking groups (P&lt; 0.001). The pol? ishers exhibited significantly greater acute reductions in various lung func? tions over the work shift, particularly for forced expiratory flow over the 25-75% poriton ofthe spirogram (FEF 25-75%) FEF 25% and FEF 50% than did the controls. Among the exposed group, the acute changes in lung function were found to be significantly larger in the smoking than in the non-smoking polishers. The duration of exposure showed a direct correlation with the acute fall in lung function. Polishers who were exposed to dusts of various metals for more than 10 years showed a significantly greater acute reduction in all the pulmonary function (P &lt; 0.001) thereby indicating that occupational exposure to multimetals in the work environment of the polishing industry had deleterious respiratory effects. 34 MALE GENITAL SYSTEM CANCER.

EMail: kamalf@usa.net Occupational risk factors of male genital system cancers is not adequately studied in the litterature.although some researches have studied some occu? pations as risky of developing cancer prostate.The present work aimed at investigating the possible occupational risk factors which might play a role in the causation of male genital system malignancies.Eighty two subjects suffering from male genital system cancers ( 62 cases suffered from cancer prostate, 16 cases were victims of cancer testis and four cases were suffering from penile cancers) were studied ,throughout twelve months, in Alexandria Main Universty Hospital,equal number of non cancer cases were selected from the same hospital and during the same period and matched with the cases for age sex , and socioeconomic standard, were used as controls. matched case control study has shown that agriculture workers were at high risk of developing cancer prostate(OR=3.6,95%CI=1.5-9.5,X2MC=6.81), also a statistical significant excess risk of cancer prostate was associated with exposure to various chemical agents (OR=2.2,95%CI=1.2- 5.8,X2MC=4.65), none of the other studied exposures or occupational categories have shown an association with increases risk of cancer prostate. Regarding cancer testis, a statistical significant excess risk occured among production workers(OR=1.9,95%CI=1.2-3.3,X2MC=4.51).Due to the small number of studied penile cancer cases,no significant association existed with any of the occupation categories found nor any of the hazardous exposures. Broad occupation categories and exposures were only analysed to prevent fragmentation of the small sample size resulting from analysis of separate occupations or exposures. It could be concluded that a significant association exist between working in agriculture or being exposed to chem? icals and developing cancer prostate.also production workers whatever the type of production were at higher risk of developing cancer testis.These findings encourage further researches ,based on larger number of cases (larger sample size), to allow detailed examination of specific occupations at risk and the exact incriminated hazardous exposures. 31 THE BUFFALO POLICE HEALTH BASELINE STUDY TOHN VIOLANTL VENA J. SUNY Buffalo. EMail: jmv@mail.rit.edu The police occupation is often obscure in terms of attitudes and practices relative to physical and psychological well-being among officers. While there is agreement that the need for good health exists in such a dangerous and highly stressful occupation, it appears that many American police depart? ments fail to provide meaningful intervention. We conducted a study to establish baseline data for physical and psychological health in the police profession and provide information for a future long-term prospective study on health intervention in the police workplace. Participants in the study were screened for existing factors and their association with possible disease outcome to determine where effective future intervention should best be focused. Screening included demographic status, blood pressure, blood lipid analysis, body measurement, lung function, physical exercise patterns, shift work, dietary practices, smoking, alcohol consumption, medical history, and psychological symptomatology. Preliminary results of the study are discussed. 36 CANCER PROMOTION BY RADIOWAVE EMISSIONS WILLIAM MORTON. DAVID, PHILLIPS. Oregon Health Science Uni? versity. EMail: jsmorton@worldnet.att.net In the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area, an unusual focus of endome? trial adenocarcinoma incidence in a region containing most of the area's radio and television broadcast towers led to utilization of an EPA broadcast radiowave density survey to study the geographic pattern by census tract of leukemia, breast cancer, and lung cancer incidence, as well as pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and lymphoma mortality. Other environmental exposure indices included occupation and socioeconomic status. By far the strongest environmental risk determinant for every cancer studied was oc? cupation, but radiowave density levels showed significant positive correla? tions with leukemia incidence and breast cancer incidence. For the total 15 year period the significant correlation between leukemia and radiowave density was restricted to non-lymphatic leukemia, but, when considered for separate five year periods, there were significant correlations during periods of peak incidence of either lymphatic or non-lymphatic leukemia and not at other times. These correlations persisted when cases with high-risk occupa? tions were excluded. Breast cancer incidence did not manifest cycles of case frequency. Of the three radiowave bands for which we were provided with census tract density estimates, two were for VHF-TV broadcasts and one was for FM radio broadcasts. FM density levels were notably higher than the VHF density levels, so that it was a surprise to find that the VHF density levels and not the FM density levels were the ones correlated with the leukemia and breast cancer incidence. The synchronization pulses included in the VHF broadcast signals were judged to have made them more biolog? ically potent. We conclude that radiowave exposures are significantly asso? ciated with occurrence of certain cancers, particularly when pulsed at low frequency modulations, and that, when there is a cyclic pattern to the cancer incidence, such an influence may be perceptible only during incidence peaks.</page><page sequence="57">S58 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 37 SHORT-TERM VARIATIONS IN OZONE CONCENTRATION AND MORTALITY. A CASE OF KRAKOW, POLAND. KRYSTYNA SZAFRANIEC. Jagiellonian University, Chair of Epidemiol? ogy and. EMail: mygomola@cyf-kr.edu.pl The aim of this study was to identify short term effects of ozone concentra? tion on mortality, in particular mortality from cardiovascular diseases, among inhabitants of Krakow, Poland. The data covered daily counts of mortality and daily concentrations of ozone and particles of aerodynamic diameter of less then lOum (PMIO) for 4-year period 1995-1998. Three indicators of ozone concentration were considered: the 1 -hour daily maximum and 8-hour moving average concentration, and the cumulative 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. exposure in three consecutive days. PMIO measurements were used in two pollutant model to control for confounding by particulate exposure. Confounding by age was treated stratifying mortality data into two age groups (i.e. &lt;65 yrs, &gt;65 yrs). The methodological approach closely foilowed that of APHEA (Air Pollution in Health: European Approach) Protocol which uses Gener- alised Additive Models (GAM) extending Poisson regression technique that controls for potential confounders such a long term trends, seasonality, weather, day-of-week. The results were expressed as RR refered to 50ig/m3 increase in pollutant level. During the study period, among 750 000 inhab? itants of Krakow, it was in average 18 deaths per day within 13 daily deaths in persons over 65 yrs old. 51 % of total deaths occurred from cardiovascular causes. The daily 8-hour. ozone concentration ranged from 12 to 246 ig/m3 (mean value 66.9ig/m3 ) and it exceeded WHO air quality guidelines in 8% observed days. The result of this study has indicated positive associations between ozone concentration and daily mortality. We found a RR associated with increase in air pollution between 1.015 to 1.033 for cardiovascular diseases. The association was strengthen a bit if PMIO was included to the model. Older people seem to be more sensitive to the effect of ozone. The work on analysis by season and examination the trend of the association between a number of deaths and ozone exposure is in progress. 41 PREVALENCE OF ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IN CZECH REPUBLIC (ISAAC PROTOCOL). IVANA HOLCATOVA, SLAMOVA, ALENA. Institute of Hygiene &amp; Epidemiology, 1st Faculty of. EMail: iholc@lfl.cuni.cz Asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis are conditions, which have a variety of clinical similarities and epidemiological connections. The number of allergies is rising all over the world and in fact we are not sure why. Objectives ofthe International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) are to investigate variations of self reported symptoms and diag? nosis of asthma and other allergic disorders. This study has established a standardised methodology to compare prevalence of allergies both within and between different countries. In accordance with the ISAAC protocol (Czech version), the questionnaires were distributed in the basic schools in second and eight classes (children aged 6-7- and 13-14 years). Younger children have taken the questionnaire home, older children have fill it in school. Schools were selected by random selection from the database of the basic schools in Czech republic. The Institute for information in education in Prague did the selection. So called "small - classes" schools and school with less than 100 pupils were excluded. We started in Prague schools then we moved to other schools. Of course only after agreement of the school. The questionnaires were distributed in the basic schools in second and eight classes (children aged 6-7- and 13-14 years}. Younger children have taken the questionnaire home, older children have fill it in school. We have distributed during the years 1996 and 1997 6000 questionnaires, 3000 in age category 6-7- and 3000 in age category 13-14 years. The response rate was in average 77,1%, in younger group about 68%, in older group about 85%. Totally we have got back 4251 question? naires. We analysed the data by EPIINFO 6.CZ. This basic analysis was done by researches from our institute. More detailed analysis was done at EU- ROMISE Centre in Prague by Forward Stepwise Analysis, Standard Dis- criminatory Analysis and c2 test. 40 ACUTE EFFECTS OF FUNGAL EXPOSURES IN RICE-FIELD AND OFFICE WORKERS IN TAIWAN: II. A SHORT-TERM LONGITU? DINAL STUDY OF MEASUREMENTS- BIOLOGICAL RESPONSES CHIH-HUNG KU, RYAN L, BURGE H, CHI W, HAUSER R, CHRIS- TIANI D. School of Public Health, NDMC. EMail: cku@ndmctsgh.edu.tw Objectives: To study the acute effects of fungal exposures in rice-field and office workers, several biological markers were measured repeatedly over 14 days. Methods: Demographic data and potential confounder information were collected from a modified ATS questionnaire. Leukocyte counts in nasal lavage and blood, and immunoglobulins were measured. Skin reactivity to 11 allergens [Alternaria tenuis, Aspergillus mix, Cladosporium, Epicoccum, Fusarium vasinfectum, Penicillium mix, dust mite (DP), dust mite (DF), cat pelt, dog hair-dander, and cockroach], was determined using a Multi-Test II kit. Data analysis was performed in SAS PROC GENMOD with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with adjustment for correlation between (among) outcomes. Results: Nasal leukocytes were higher in rice-field workers than office workers, and increased in both groups after eight and 14 days of exposure during rice harvest period. An increase of 10 CFU/m3 total fiingi was related to a nasal leukocyte increase of 1.0448-cells/ml. Although after 14 days of exposure the skin test results were variable, these differences were not significant. Blood leukocytes varied by work site and by day, with the daily patterns of variation differing between work sites (rice field vs. office). Similar results were found with respect to IgE and total IgG and IgG subclasses. After controlling for work site, day, and their interactions, a positive skin prick test to one or more fungal allergens was a stronger predictor of elevated IgE than a positive skin test to other allergens. In contrast to those with no positive skin tests, subjects who reacted to at least one of the fungal allergens had significantly increased serum-total IgE by a loglO unit of 0.55 IU/ml. In subjects with other skin test responses (not including fiingi), there was a significant increase of log 10 unit of 0.38 for serum-total IgE. Compared with their baseline, rice-field workers had a significant increase in serum-total IgG on the last day. A reaction to mixed Aspergillus allergens was significantly correlated with an increase in the total white blood cell concentration at baseline and on the last day. However, reaction to Cladosporium allergen was positively correlated with change in the total white blood cells after the two week period. Air Aspergillus levels were predominantly associated with the change in total blood leukocytes after ad? justing for potential confounders. 42 TOENAIL ARSENIC LEVELS AND SQUAMOUS CELL CARCI? NOMA OF THE SKIN KUEI-LING B. CHEN, GERTIG D, RYAN L, WILLETT W, CHRIS- TIANI D, HUNTER D. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: klbchen@post.harvard.edu Ingested inorganic arsenic has been related to the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin. Although clear exposure-response rela? tions between arsenic exposure and skin cancer have been found in areas of Taiwan where humans were exposed to high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water, the association of arsenic with SCC is unclear at lower levels of exposure typical in the US population. To examine the association at such levels, we conducted a nested case-control study of SCC within the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) cohort. Toenail arsenic concentration, previously shown to reflect intake of arsenic from drinking water, was used as an indicator of environmental exposure to arsenic. Toenail samples were col? lected from 62,641 women in 1982, prior to the diagnosis of SCC. During the study period 1984-1992, 250 incident cases of histologically confirmed SCC were selected; one control was randomly selected matched by age and year and month of toenail return to each case. The final analyses included 246 cases and 246 controls with measurable arsenic levels. The median toenail arsenic concentrations were similar in cases and controls (0.06 mg/g). There was no evidence of a positive association between toenail arsenic level and risk of SCC. Current smokers and former smokers had significantly higher levels of toenail arsenic than never-smokers. However, cigarette smoking was not associated with risk of SCC, and adjustment for smoking and other known SCC risk factors did not alter the association of toenail arsenic and SCC. In summary, we did not observe any relationship between arsenic levels experienced by women in the general US population and the risk of SCC of the skin.</page><page sequence="58">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S59 43 IS THE EPIDEMIOLOGIST A POLICY GATE KEEPER OR A SOURCE OF INFORMATION? A DIFFERENT APPROACH IN THE CALIFORNIA EMF PROGRAM RAYMOND NEUTRA. DEODC. EMail: rneutra@dhs.ca.gov Good quantitative policy analysis doesn't require a "yes/no" answer about a hazard. It requires something epidemiologists rarely if ever provide: a) a degree of confidence that an epidemiological association has a strong causal component and is not just due to confounding or bias, b) a best guess at the shape and slope of a dose response curve, c) information about the distri? bution of exposure and any effect modification which has implications for environmental justice and, d) base line rates of disease and life years lost. Policy analysts, when presented a potential environmental hazard, can determine the likely options for dealing with it. They can identify the non-health costs and benefits of those options. Then, they can provide two-way sensitivity analyses on degree of confidence and size of effect. This tells decision makers the minimum degree of confidence and the minimum size .of effect which will warrant doing inexpensive things or expensive things. They can do this long before the epidemiologist has any data to show them. A low degree of confidence and an epidemiological effect near the detection limit of the relevant studies can sometimes lead to cost beneficial action if the remedy is inexpensive. We don't always need to be 90% sure or even 51% sure of causality for society to take a cost beneficial action. I will illustrate how the California EMF program has applied this approach in shaping its review of the experimental and epidemiological evidence to provide input into two multi-attribute quantitative decision analyses, one dealing with the power grid, the other dealing with schools. 53 PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS FOR FARM-RELATED DER- MATOSES HYESOOK PARK, SPRINCE NANCY, WHITTEN PAUL, BURMEIS- TER LEON, ZWERLING CRAIG. University of Iowa. EMail: hpark@mail.public-health.uiowa.edu BACKGROUND: Agricultural workers perform a variety of tasks and are exposed to a wide variety of chemical, biological, and physical hazards, that put them at risk for occupational skin diseases. However, the prevalence and pattern of skin disease are not well known among farm workers in the United States. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed the frequency of dermatitis and the risk factors for dermatitis among 729 Iowa farm family members. From 1992 to 1994, we collected data on potential risk factors and skin problems among the farmers in the Iowa Farm Family Health and Hazard Survey (IFFHHS). To compare the prevalence and the characteristics of dermatitis among Iowa farm families with a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population and of the U.S. farmers, we use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Occupational Health Supplement of 1988. RESULTS: Eleven percent of Iowa farm family members and 9.7% of Iowa male principal farm operators had experienced dermatitis in last year. Iowa farm family members had a slightly lower prevalence of dermatitis than the national population. In contrast, Iowa male principal farm operators had a slightly higher prevalence than U.S. male farmers. Of those who reported that their dermatitis was related to chemicals, almost three quarters of the Iowa farmers and their families thought work-related chemicals were respon? sible. In contrast only 32% ofthe U.S. farmers and less than 18% ofthe U.S. general population mention work-related chemicals. Iowa farmers and their family members with dermatitis were more likely to make major changes in work activities because of the dermatitis than were other Americans with dermatitis. Also, Iowa farmers reported exposure to a wider variety of chemicals than the general population and other U.S. farmers. Using a multiple logistic regression model, we evaluated the risk factors for farm- related dermatitis among Iowa farmers. Women (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.15- 5.99) and those exposed to petroleum product (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.97-7.68) were more likely to have dermatitis. Education beyond high school was also a risk factor for dermatitis (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.15-4.23). A prior history of allergy had the strongest association with dermatitis, especially among prin? cipal farm operators (OR 10.96, 95% CI 2.98-40.39). 52 CANCER INCIDENCE AMONG NEW YORK STATE FEMALE FARM RESIDENTS YING WANG, LEWIS E, STARK A, FITZGERALD E. New York State Department of Health. EMail: wxy01@health.state.ny.us A retrospective cohort study of cancer incidence among 7,207 New York State female farm residents was conducted from 1980 through 1993. Similar to the previous findings for New York State male farmers, the female farm resident cohort experienced significantly lower cancer risks for all cancers combined and for lung cancer compared to rural non-farm female residents. In addition, significantly low risks for cancers of rectum, ovary and leukemia were found among the female cohort members. Non-significant excesses were found for thyroid and liver cancer. The findings suggest that female farm residents may be exposed to some of the same cancer protective factors as male farmers. 56 RISKS OF ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE INTERFERENCE WITH VAR? IOUS ACTIVITIES IN TWO NOISE ANNOYANCE SURVEYS LUBICA SOBOTOVA, JURKOVICOVA JANA, AGHOVA LUBICA, VOLEKOVA JANKA. Institute of Hygiene, Faculty of Medicine, Comen- ius. EMail: sobotova@fmed.uniba.sk Background. Road traffic noise has become in last decades a frequent, unavoidable and continuously increasing environmental factor with auditory and non-auditory health effects. Psychosocial effects and annoyance are consequences that are needed to be taken into account. Methods. Two noise annoyance surveys were conducted in ten year interval. This period (1989-1999) includes political, socioeconomic and traffic man? agement changes as well. Specific aims of these surveys were to quantify noise exposure affecting university students cohort, to evaluate their subjec- tive response to road traffic noise in their residential areas in terms of sleep quality, annoyance, activity disturbances and psychosocial well-being and to calculate risks of urban noise on student's health. Equivalent noise levels were assessed in the city Bratislava, capital of Slovak Republic (449 547 inhabitants), at the dormitory (exposed group, nl =374; n2 = 166) and in the residential areas (100 measuring stations average) where the other students lived (control group, nl=483; n2=345) by Briiel-Kjaer measuring tech? nique. Results. Mean dormitory equivalent noise levels increased from 64,7 dB/A to 67 dB/A after ten years. Subjective response of students was assessed by a validated noise annoyance questionnaire. Risks of road traffic noise inter- ference with several actvities were obtained by bivariate analysis (odds ratio, 95% CI). Current risks of road traffic noise interference with various activ? ities for exposed group were higher than the previous ones concerning interference with listening to radio and TV (OR=2,81; 95% CI=2,31-3,55 vs OR=l,43; 95% CI = 1,08-1,91), interference with reading and mental work (OR=3,72; 95% CI=2,93-5,09 vs OR=2,32; 95% CI = 1,76-3,36), interference with personal communication (OR=2,70; 95% CI = 1,75-4,19 vs OR=0,88; 95% CI=0,48-1,62) and interference with telephone com? munication (OR=l,92; 95% CI=l,20-3,08 vs OR=0,56; 95% CI=0,26- 1,17). In current survey road traffic noise disturbs rest (OR=3,98; 95% CI=3,23-5,46 vs OR=l,59; 95% CI = 1,17-2,18), falling asleep (OR=4,08; 95% CI=3,29-6,02 vs OR=l,37; 95% CI=0,99-1,93) and causes awak- ening (OR=3,13; 95% CI=2,29- 4,56 vs OR=1,09; 95% CI=0,70-1,69) more than in previous survey. Conclusion. These preliminary results show that road traffic noise psychos? ocial risks are important to study, especially in university students. Compar? ison of two noise annoyance surveys confirms that road traffic noise load continuously increases as well as subjective response to it.</page><page sequence="59">S60 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 58 INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT: POTENTIAL HEALTH RISK AMONGST ELECTROPLATERS PRATIBHA GUPTA.

EMail: dbmi@ucms.ernet.in Pulmonary function tests consisting of FVC, FEV1%, PEFR, FEF25-75% and MW were measured by using Spiro-232 P.K.Morgan and MMSE test carried out for screening the cognitive responses in 42 asymptomatic non smoker male electroplaters belonging to East Delhi. These workers were found to be exposed to higher concentrations of trace metals viz. chromium, nickel, copper, zinc etc. as detected by quanlitative analysis of particulate load collected by personal samplers. Results of majority of ventilatory pa? rameters were found to be statistically decreased when compared with healthy controls at p&lt;0.05 level. The mean score on MMSE is very near to the cut off point depicting marginal organic impairment in these workers. Further, the measurements of lung functions and scores of MMSE were correlated with work duration, particulate load and concentration of each trace metal, revealing a negative relationship as regard with lung functions and positive relationship with cognitive responses to most of the variables, indicating that exposure to trace metals in long run may produce adverse effects on respiratory as well as CNS functioning. 59 DATA CONCERNING THE OPPORTUNITY OF SOME NEW BIOINDICATORS IN CHILDREN IN AREAS WITH HIGH NI?

EMail: hires@mail.dntis.ro An epidemiological study was undertaken to assess the methaemoglobinae- mia and some new bioindicators (reduced glutathione, lipid peroxides and glutathione-peroxidase activity) in 105 children aged 0-3 years in two villages in Botosani county, where high nitrate levels in drinking-water were found. The children were divided in two groups: the control group - 21 children consuming drinking-water with less than 45 mg nitrates/L and the exposed group - 84 children consuming drinking-water more than 45 ni? trates/L. The results indicated unsignificant modifications for methaemoglo- bin levels, but increased values of lipid peroxides (p &lt; 0.001) and decreased values of reduced glutathione (p &lt; 0.0027) in blood samples of children exposed vs. control group. Also, the results pointed out the increase of glutathione-peroxidase activity (p &lt; 0.001) comparing to control, as possi? ble compensation/adaptation effect with increasing water nitrate concentra? tion to reduce methaemoglobin. 60 PLEURAL CANCER MORTALITY IN REGIONS AT HIGH RISK IN ITALY MARCO MARTUZZI, COMBA PIETRO, BIGGERI ANNIBALE. World Health Organization, European Centre for. EMail: mam@who.it As in many industrialised countries, pleural neoplasm mortality rates in Italy have been increasing in recent decades. National trends, described in the literature, suggest an increase between 10% and 16% per quinquennium in the period 1969 to 1994, more marked for men living in the regions where most of the asbestos exposure is known to have occurred. In order to assess the likely magnitude of the epidemic in the future, temporal analyses were extended to study mortality trends by birth cohort. We present data for the most exposed regions of northern Italy, selected a priori: Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy and Friuli Venezia Giulia. Routine mortality data from ISTAT, for the period 1969-94, were analysed for men and women separately. Regression methods based on Poisson models were used. Bootstrap methods were used to estimate confidence intervals of the cumulative risks up to 85 years of age. The study region comprises a total population of 7.5 million, with 4,979 and 2,800 deaths from pleural neoplasm in men and women respectively, in the 25 years considered. Cohort effects, adjusted by age, were strongly significant (P&lt;0.001) in both men and women. Taking as reference those born in the quinquennium around 1905, the relative risk for men goes from 0.36 (cohort of 1885) to 3.63 (cohort of 1945). Similarly, absolute cumulative risk of dying from pleural neoplasm up to 85 years of age increased from 0.15% to 1.19%. Results for women are analogous, with background rates much lower than for men but with marked cohort effects. Results for younger cohorts are unstable due to the small number of deaths, and risk estimates have wide confidence intervals. However, the data suggest that the epidemic might have reached a peak, or at least will increase more slowly in future. Predictions under different hypotheses will be discussed. These analyses underline once more the severity of the asbestos-related pleural cancer epidemic in Italy. Although asbestos has been banned in 1992, a continuing epidemic of deaths from pleural cancer is to be expected. 61 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA IN THE TEXAS GOLDEN TRIANGLE SHARON PETRONELLA, WILKINSON GREGG. The University of Texas Medical Branch. EMail: spetrone@utmb.edu In 1993 a threefold proportional increase in multiple myeloma was reported in Beaumont, Texas. A similar increase in mortality rates for residents of surrounding counties was later observed. To further investigate these trends, we conducted a hospital-based, case-control study of 107 histologically confirmed multiple myeloma cases and 428 histologically confirmed colon cancer controls identified by a local cancer registry during 1992-1996. Cases and controls were queried by means of a questionnaire designed to obtain information on demographic, host and lifestyle characteristics, occupational history, and exposures to suspected carcinogens. Crude, stratified and logistic regression analyses compared cases with controls to estimate the risk relative to these factors. Twofold or greater increases in relative risk estimates were observed for exposures to petroleum products (OR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.14, 5.60), rubber (OR=2.7; 95% CI: 0.98, 7.40), styrene (OR=2.2; 95% CI: 0.60, 8.29), butadiene (OR=2.3; 95% CI: 0.80, 6.65), ftesh wood (OR=2.0; 95% CI: 0.86, 4.71), and asbestos (OR=2.6; 95% CI: 1.10, 6.12). Controls were more likely to be self-respondents (OR=0.5; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.98) and to report a previous diagnosis of hepatitis (OR=0.3; 95% CI: 0.04, 2.24). When stratified by type of respondent, consistently increased odds ratios were observed for self-respondents. Adjustment by logistic regression for type of respondent, age, gender, and race resulted in elevated odds ratios being observed for asbestos (OR=2.5; 95% CI: 0.92, 6.70), benzene (OR=2.6; 95% CI: 0.72, 9.48), butadiene (OR=3.2; 95% CI: 0.89, 11.63), petroleum products (OR=3.3; 95% CI: 1.23, 8.88), and styrene (OR=5.1; 95% CI: 0.99, 25.71). These findings are consistent with the results of other inves? tigations, and suggest that environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of multiple myeloma.</page><page sequence="60">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S61 62 CAUSE-SPECIFIC DAILY MORTALITY AND EXPOSURE TO AM?

EMail: mark@polair.epi.mcgill.ca Over the past 10 years, studies have found consistent positive associations between nonaccidental mortality and short-term increases in levels of am? bient particulates and gaseous pollutants. However, cause-specific mortality has not been investigated adequately. In the present investigation, we made use of underlying causes of death among all 140,939 residents of the Island of Montreal who died between 1984 and 1993. From the network of fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal we obtained daily mean levels of particulates and gaseous pollutants. We regressed the logarithm of daily counts of death on levels of ozone and sulfur dioxide, evaluated as the average of exposures on the day of death and the 2 preceding days ("3-day mean"), accounting for non-Poisson dispersion, seasonal and sub-seasonal fluctuations in mortality, meteorological factors, particles, and other gaseous pollutants. For ozone, we found positive associations for deaths from all nonaccidental causes, neoplasms, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, cor? onary artery diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. No associations were found for non-malignant digestive diseases or accidents. For sulfur dioxide, we found the same endpoints as in the analysis of ozone to be in excess, except for neoplasms. Our estimates of the percent increase in daily nonac? cidental mortality for increases in ozone and sulfur dioxide across their inter-quartile ranges were 2.72% (95%CI: 1.59-3.86%) and 1.85% (95%CI: 0.73-2.98%), respectively. In addition, higher excess daily mortality was found generally among persons 65 years or age and over. These results show that increases in levels of criteria gaseous pollutants are positively associated with cause-specific daily mortality, even after adjusting for the effects of particles. 66 PATERNAL FISH CONSUMPTION AND SECONDARY SEX RA? TIO MARK TRAVERS, BUCK G, VENA J. University at Buffalo Department of Social and. EMail: mtravers@acsu.buffalo.edu The Great Lakes are contaminated with a variety of compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), heavy metals and pesticides. These com? pounds are known reproductive toxicants in animals, but few studies have assessed their affects in humans. This study seeks to determine the affects of paternal fish consumption on reproductive outcomes, specifically the sec? ondary sex ratio; i.e. male divided by female live births. 5,388 male members of the New York State Angler Cohort answered a questionnaire on their fish consumption. Offspring of the anglers were identified by linkage to live birth registries. Of the 5,388 cohort members with singleton live births, 2,581(48%) had consumed fish prior to the birth of their first child while 2,807(52%) had not. The secondary sex ratio was 1.07 in the non-consumer group and 1.01 in the consumer group (p=0.16 for difference). The odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for male births were 0.95 (0.85, 1.05) for all ages, 0.96 (0.70, 1.33) for less than 20 years old, 0.90 (0.76, 1.06) for 20 to 24 years old, 1.02 (0.86, 1.22) for 25 to 29 years old, 0.83 (0.60,1.14) for 30 to 34 years old, and 1.64 (0.64,4.26) for those 35 and older. The consumer group was significantly older (95%CI for difference 0.97, 1.14 years). There was no significant difference between the consump? tion groups in terms of smoking status and frequency, race, baby's month of birth or gestational age. While not statistically significant, this data suggests an excess of female live births for consumers, especially in the youngest fathers. 65 MENTAL PROBLEMS AS A RISK FACTOR FOR HEAT-RELATED DEATH, CINCINNATI, OHIO, 1999 REINHARD KAISER. RUBIN CAROL, HENDERSON ALDEN, WOLFE MITCH, PARROTT CARL L., ADCOCK MALCOLM. Epidemic Intelli? gence Service, Epidemiology Program. EMail: rik9@cdc.gov Up to 1,700 heat-related deaths have occurred in the United States in a year with a heat wave. Heat-related deaths are preventable, and many cities have developed heat plans as a proactive public health approach. Cincinnati, Ohio, has had a heat plan since the 1980s. Although no heat-related deaths had been reported in Cincinnati since 1988, 18 occurred during a heat wave in July 1999. Methods: We evaluated the city's response to the heat wave; reviewed death investigation reports, including extensive toxicological screens; and con? ducted a case-control study. Control subjects were matched for age and neighborhood. We interviewed 17 case surrogates and 34 control subjects for risk factors for heat-related death and for prevention behaviors. We used exact conditional regression for analysis. Results: Death investigation reports showed that all victims had known risk factors for heat-related death. More significantly, eight had mental problems; among these, five were younger than 65 years, and four took psychotropic medication that can affect thermoregulation. Of the decedents with mental problems, three lived in group homes or halfway residences, four lived alone, and one lived with an elderly aunt. In the case-control study, a working air-conditioner at home was the strongest protective factor (odds ratio = 0.03, 95% confidence interval = 0-0.2) and was the only significant variable in the multivariate model. Conclusions: We identified young people with mental problems as a new high-risk group that was not addressed in Cincinnati's heat plan. Caretakers of people with mental problems should be trained to evaluate heat-related risks and recognize signs of heat-related morbidity. Air-conditioning is an effective prevention tool; regulations to limit maximum temperatures should be considered for assisted-care facilities. 67 LONGTERM CHEMICAL INCIDENT FOLLOW-UP - YES OR NO? DONALD CAMPBELL. Auckland Healthcare. EMail: donaldc@ahsl.co.nz Chemical accidents can have serious effects on health. The exposure(s) may cause new, previously unobserved health effects or exacerbate those of another aetiology. Epidemiology is an important tool for evaluating the health consequences for populations exposed to chemicals as a result of chemical incidents or environmental contamination. It will measure effects and supply information on which to base action to deal with the current event and to help manage future ones. There is an increasing literature on the epidemiological examination of the acute effects of chemical contami? nation incidents but less on the ongoing assessment and evaluation of their longer term consequences. Epidmiologists can make a valuable contribution to each phase of a chemical incident; preparedness, response and follow-up. In 1993 the tanker Braer ran aground on Shetland, UK, leaking 85,000 tonnes of crude oil, exposing the local residents to airborne contamination principally. Exposed and referent cohorts were identified and studies per? formed to examine the short and medium-term health effects on the popu? lation. The principal physical symptoms reported arose on the first and second day of the incident. Five months later the exposed group showed more anxiety and somatic symptoms than the controls. Thes analyses have been published elsewhere. At the initiation of the studies the protocol proposed the long-term fol? low-up of the cohort, this being the well articulated request of the local community. The central records of the exposed cohort were "flagged" to permit follow-up. Cancer registration and death certification data have been used to examine the health experience of the exposed cohort after five years. No significant differences in terms of total, age-specific or cause-specific mortality from that of the rest of the Shetland population over this time period were identified. Nor were there significant differences between an? nual mortality since the event. Cancer registration did not demonstrate any divergence. The validity of the "flagging" was examined using frequency of change of civil status. This paper will examine the practicality and validity of utilsing routinely collected available data to perform long term follow-up of an exposed population following an acute environmental exposure. Answering the con? cerns of the community should be in accord also with scientific methods.</page><page sequence="61">S62 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 69 COMPOSTING FACILITIES AND PUBLIC HEALTH - AN EPIDE? MIOLOGICAL STUDY CAROLINE HERR, ZUR NIEDEN ANJA, MANN MARION, AL- BRECHT ANDREAS, BOEDEKER ROLF-HASSO, EIKMANN THOMAS. Institute for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine,. EMail: Caroline.Herr@hygiene.med.uni-giessen.de In the past two decades composting facilities have become necessary in recycling organic fractions of municipal waste and sewage sludge. Aspergillus fumigatus and thermophilic actinomycetes-a reliable indicator of compost dust-can con? tribute to downwind concentrations of these microorganisms around the site. Both can cause opportunistic infections and allergies when inhaled by risk groups in the general population and are of relevance in certain working environments. To date no data exist whether the bioaerosols downwind of the composting facilities affect the public health status and what role annoying odors around the facilities play in the perceived health of the residents. In this study self-reported health (complaints and doctor's diagnoses of disease) as well as odor annoyance ofthe residents closest to three composting facilities (An, Bn, Cn) were assessed. In addition, three corresponding control groups (Ad, Bd, Cd) were examined for each facility, altogether 979 persons. A questionnaire also used in the epidemiological investigations for the Register of Effects ofthe Clean Air Program of North Rhine-Westphalia/Germany and a doctors interview were applied. At the same time exposure to bioaerosols -viable airborne microorgan? isms: total microorganisms, total fungi and thermophilic actinomycetes- was measured in the residential areas close to the facilities (An, Bn, Cn). In the vicinity of two facilities odor annoyance was reported frequently (An: 80%, Bn: 90%) by the residents. The microbiological measurements of exposure showed up to 10A6 cfu/mA3 total microorganisms and thermophilic actinomycetes in the residential area An and normal -upwind- concentrations of microorganisms for Bnear. 27 out of 28 complaints concerning airway and mucous membrane irritation as well as general health were reported more often by the residents exposed to the bioaerosols (An) than the corresponding control group (Ad). Logistic regression indicated hints for an influence of the residential area (bioaerosols!) for 16 out of these 28 complaints and none for complaints of the skin or doctor's diagnosis. In B (normal bioaerosols!) hints for only 4 out ofthe 28 complaints were found. The complaints reported consistently only in Anear cannot be attributed to the perceived odors as these existed even more in Bnear. Reporting bias is an unlikely explanation as only complaints but not doctor's diagnoses were reported more often. They are similar to the complaints reported from work places with organic dust exposure (MMI and ODTS). Therefore, these complaints seem to be indicators of an exposure to bioaerosols in the residential environment. 76 LEAD EXPOSURE IN URBAN CENTRES: A CASE STUDY FROM IBADAN, NIGERIA SRIDHAR MYNEPALLI, ADOGAME L, OLAWUYI J. UNIVERSITY OF IBADAN, IBADAN, NIGERIA. EMail: mkcsridhar@skannet.com Lead is a pervasive chemical with proven toxicity to human beings partic? ularly children. The available information on lead and its effects in devel? oping countries is rather scanty. In Nigeria, the data is sporadic and is limited to measuring the levels as a routine without any holistic approach. A comprehensive study has been made on lead levels in various environmental samples in Ibadan and its impact on communities. Ibadan is the capital of Oyo State and is rated as the most populous city in Black Africa south of Sahara. For the sampling purposes, the city is divided into three sociogeo- graphic areas, viz. high density, medium density, and low density areas. These areas also reflect the socioeconomic status of the people living in them. Samples of water supplies (36 from surface, ground and public sup? plies), soils (92), dust (35), and foods commonly consumed by the commu? nities (35) were collected randomly using standard methods. These samples were analyzed for lead using AAS following the APHA methods. A com- munist survey was also conducted involving 290 subjects selected from the communities (99), 'Mechanics' villages (where a group of professional au? tomobile service providers stay and service vehicles, 100), and a battery industry premises (91). The results indicated that the lead levels in the water supplies varied between 0.4 to 1.5 mg/1 and the values were more in the ground waters and in high and medium density areas. The soils in the residential areas showed lread levels between 123.0 to 491.2 mg/1, and in 'mechanics' villages 712.0 to 4377.3 mg/1. Here, the workers use petrol indiscriminately for washing the greasy hands and vehicle parts. The dust samples showed lead levels between 19.5 and 192.2 mg/1 and the values were more in high and medium density areas depending on the season. Foods, however, showed permissible levels of lead, between 0 and 21.6 mg/Kg. The communities living in the high and medium density areas, mechanics' villages and near the lead industry pre? mises are exposed more than others. They complained of headache, fatigue, and irritability. The Nigerian petroleum contains highest levels of lead (400 to 500 mg/1) and there are no stringent emission control laws in the country. This seems to be one ofthe major sources of lead in the environment. There is a need to phase out the lead levels in the locally produced petroleum. Lead is a serious problem in the urban centres in Nigeria and there is a need to educate the public on the problems and consequences of lead exposure. 70 HEALTH EFFECTS OF VEHICLE EMISSIONS IN SHANGHAI WEI ZHOU YUAN D, YE S, QI P, FU C, CHRISTIANI D. Occupational Health Program, Harvard School of Public. EMail: wzhou@hohp.harvard.edu Currently, there are approximately 12 million vehicles in China, and the average annual rate of increase is 15 percent. In Shanghai, China's largest city, there are 700,000 vehicles and 500,000 scooters in the streets, and vehicle emissions have become the main source of urban air pollution. Using a modified Chinese translation of the ATS-DLD standardized respiratory symptom ques? tionnaire, we investigated the respiratory health effects of 794 subjects who were occupationally exposed to vehicle emissions. Occupational groups included taxi drivers, bus drivers, conductors and engine repairers. Questionnaires were col? lected and data were analyzed using Epi Info 6 and SAS statistical package. We also collected blood samples for lead, which was determined by graphite stove atom absorption spectrophotometry. Logistic regression and general linear mod? els were used to examine the relationship between respiratory illness and exposure, adjusting for confounding factors such as age, sex, smoking, residence and cooking habits. The age and gender distribution, smoking habits and other demographic characteristics of the 532 controls were similar to those of the exposed group. Results showed that the prevalence of self-reported respiratory symptoms and physician-diagnosed chronic respiratory diseases for the exposed group was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than that of the control group. The adjusted OR (odds ratio) for self-reported throat pain, cough, phlegm, and physician-diagnosed chronic rhinitis, chronic pharyngitis were 1.87 (95% CI 1.65-2.09), 2.77(95% CI 2.32-3.22), 4.20(95% CI 3.81-4.59), 2.05 (95% CI 1.50-2.60), and 3.77 (95% CI 3.25-4.29) respectively. Lung function measure? ments showed that the values of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were correlated with age, sex and height (P&lt;0.01), but not exposure status. Blood lead levels of the population were correlated only with sex and age. The GM (geometric means) for blood lead level of males (108.33 ?1.27 mg/L) was significantly higher than that of females (89.59? 1.29 mg/L, P&lt;0.05). Subjects over 50 years old had lower blood levels (GM= 82.47?1.19 mg/L) than other age groups (P&lt;0.01). One possible reason for this is that usually females and older people spend fewer hours outdoors than males and younger people do. As besides the places near traffic roads, the outdoor environment (including air, dust and soil) lead pollution of other places was also heavy in the city. All the results showed that vehicle emissions pollution is very serious in Shanghai, and that occupational exposure to vehicle emission may increase the prevalence of pulmonary symptoms and chronic respiratory diseases 77 TRAINING AND RESEARCH IN OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVI? RONMENTAL HEALTH: THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA MODEL IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE IVAN CIZNAR, COOK T, UNGAR R, KROSS B, TRNOVEC T. Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine. EMail: ciznar@upkm.sk Since 1996, the University of Iowa and cooperating institutions in four (now five) Central European countries have been involved in an international train? ing and research program in occupational and environmental health. Health professionals and scientists from Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, the Czech Re? public, and now Poland participate each year in a five-month training program at The University of Iowa. As part of this program, participants take formal coursework intended to enhance their professional knowedge and skill, such as epidemiology, environmental health, biostatistics, etc. Each participant also works closely with an individually selected faculty mentor who has expertise in their area of specialization. During this time, participants begin preparing pro? posals for joint pilot research projects to be conducted after the participant returns to their home country. Within a year of returning from The Unversity of Iowa, each participant, along with his or her respective mentor, conducts an international workshop on a topic related to their common professional inter- ests. In the first four years of this program, twenty-six participants and fourteen faculty mentors have conducted twenty-five workshops on a wide range of topics, such as rural epidemiology, risk assessment, ergonomics, and ethical issues in research. As workshop faculty, training program participants have the oppor? tunity to share their new knowledge and skill with professional colleagues in their home country. These workshops have had a regional impact and have been attended by more than three hundred individuals from fourteen Central and Eastern European countries. Workshop attendees have included environmental health scientists, engineers, health care professionals, and representatives from governmental and non-govemmental organizations. Systematic evaluations of the workshops indicate that they are successfully meeting the professional education needs of attendees. To date, five research proposals have been funded to conduct pilot research projects in Central European countries. Three other proposals are currently being reveiwed for funding. This program is relatively short-term and allows participants to maintain their professional positions and status in their home countries. It fosters a two-way exchange of professional interests with an emphasis on addressing relevant research questions. Addition? ally, the program appears to be a very cost-effective method of disseminating information regarding environmental health issues, not only to each participant in the program, but also to a large number of professionals in Central and Eastern Europe.</page><page sequence="62">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S63 79 NEUROBEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT UP TO 5.5 YEARS AF? TER PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO METHYLMERCURY AND PCB PHILIPPE GRANDTEAN, WEIHE P, DEBES F, STEUERWALD U, WHITE R. Boston University School of Public Health. EMail: pgrand@health.sdu.dk Prenatal exposure to neurotoxicants, such as methylmercury and PCBs, may cause developmental effects that may not be immediately detectable. Also, the relative importance of seafood contaminants in this regard is unclear. We therefore established a cohort of 182 singleton term births in the Faroe Islands, where marine food includes pilot whale. Maternal serum, hair, and milk, and umbilical cord blood were analyzed for major contaminants. Essential fatty acids, selenium, and thyroid function parameters were deter? mined in cord blood. The infant's neurological optimality score was deter? mined at age two weeks (adjusted for gestational age), 18 months and 42 months. Psychological tests were administered at 7 months, 18 months, and then at 12-month intervals up to 5.5 years. Mercury concentrations were associated mainly with whale meat intake, PCB with blubber intake. The two contaminants were not closely associated, but both spanned more than two orders of magnitude. Omega-3 fatty acid concentrations in cord serum varied less. After adjustment for confounders, a 10-fold increase of the cord-blood mercury concentration was associated with a decreased neuro? logical optimality score of 2.0 (p = 0.03) at two weeks of age. This effect corresponds to the one caused by a decrease in gestational age of about three weeks. Similar tendencies were seen at subsequent examinations. Other seafood diet parameters had no effect on this outcome. The psychological tests showed some floor effects, but associations were seen with maternal cognitive function and an amended HOME score. However, within the age groups examined, these tests did not reveal any definite associations with neurotoxicant exposures (data on 66 months are preliminary at the time of abstract submission). Also, thyroid function showed no abnormalities and was unrelated to PCB levels. Thus, prenatal exposure to methylmercury from contaminated seafood was associated with an increased risk of neurodevel- opmental deficit, as revealed by standardized neurological examination. In this North Atlantic population, methylmercury therefore constitutes an important neurological risk factor. 83 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INDICATORS AND DEVELOP? MENT OF PREVENTIVE ACTIONS AGAINST ASCARIS LUM- BRICOIDES INFECTIONS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES, CA- PARAO AND ALTO CAPARAO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL FERNANDO CARNEIRO, CIFUENTES ENRIQUE, TELLEZ-ROJO M. Centro Mineiro de Estudos Epidemiologicos e. EMail: fernando.carneiro@mma.gov.br This study developed a compound environmental health indicator (EHI) for planning of preventive measures to be applied against Ascaris lumbricoides infection in rural municipalities of Caparao and Alto Caparao, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. A cross sectional study on the prevalence of Ascaris lumbri? coides infection, and a secondary study on intensity of infection were carried out between May and September, 1998. The study population consisted of all children under 14 years of age, living in 588 households from eleven rural communities. 825 children provided stool samples, for parasitological exam? ination. The development of the environmental health indicator allowed the identification those communities with the highest risk of infection, through a multivariate model for the ascariasis prevalence. This indicator pointed out protective associations with better sanitation conditions and hygiene patterns (OR= 0.54 , 95% CI= 0.30-0.95, and OR= 0.54 and 95% CI = 0.32-0.92, respectively). Data showed a significant interaction be? tween crowding in the dwelling and access to water in the lavatory (OR=0.21 and 95% CI= 0.06 - 0.75). In contrast, low socioeconomic status was associated with an increased risk of infection (OR= 2.45, 95% CI = 1.37 - 4.40). Outstanding lessons learned from the study transcend the discussion on the natural history of A. lumbricoides infection, and provide new meth? odological elements with potential applications, i.e. community health and environmental interventions.

TINELY COLLECTED DATA PAWEL GORYNSKI WOJTYNIAK BOGDAN, SWIATCZAK JANUSZ. National Institute of Hygiene. EMail: pawel@medstat.waw.pl Recent studies carried out in several countries and particularly in United States indicate negative health consequences of by products resulting from chlorination of drinking water that contain organic compounds. This studies are usually undertaken in the countries that have good quality cancer registers or registers of congenital malformations. Until now such studies have not been carried out in Poland. The aim of our study was to analyse the possible association of the chlorination of drinking water with incidence of cancer in selected urban population. for our we selected two towns with different sources of drinking water. The first one is Bia3ystok - where surface water is commonly used as the source of drinking water which contain high level of chlorination by-products as indicated by chlorophorm level. The second one is Lublin where underground water is used as a source of drinking water with no chlorination by-products have been. found in it by Sanitary Epidemiological surveillance. The health information is based on hospital- ised morbidity study carried out by our Department and registration of deaths carried out by the Central Statistical Office. We have taken into account discharge rates and death rates for malignant neoplasms of the digestive system (ICD-9 150-159) in 1991-1996. We have found that both discharge rates and death rates in males and discharge rates in female were higher in Bia3ystok then in Lublin. Though the rates have not been age adjusted as yet the younger population age structure in Bia3ystok than in Lublin suggest that those differences are not age dependent. 84 CONTROL SAMPLING STRATEGIES FOR CASE-CROSSOVER DESIGNS IN AIR POLLUTION EPIDEMIOLOGY HO KIM, LEE J. School of Public Health, Seoul National Univ.. EMail: hokim@snu.ac.kr The case-crossover design equates exposures at the period of time of failure (case period) with one or more periods when failure did not occur (control periods), and evaluates the potential excess risk using conditional logistic regression. The results for case-crossover studies can be sensitive to the selection of control periods, especially when temporal patterns such as clear time trends or seasonal waves exist. In this simulation study, we applied several control sampling approaches to control for confounding by temporal patterns of exposure variable (air pollution) and evaluated the usefulness of symmetric bi-directional control strategies. We simulated true relative risks of deaths (RR) of 1.051 per 50ppb increase of S02 and included confound? ing by seasonal waves, linear long-term time trends, and combination of both. The estimated RR from symmetric bi-directional control sampling approaches were 1.056 at decreasing long-term trends of S02 levels and 1.050 at increasing long-term trends of S02 levels. Our results indicate that the symmetric bi-directional control sampling approaches can be biased if the data sets with a cyclic wave are incomplete. It estimated the mortality as 1.064 (25% overestimated from the true RR) with a cup-shaped pattern and 1.040 (22% underestimated from the true RR) with a cap-shaped pattern. In these situations, the estimation from unidirectional control sampling ap? proaches was less biased. Our simulations show that the symmetric bi- directional case-crossover design can substantially control for confounding by linear long-term trends of exposure variable by design. Simulation results also show that it can be biased in a certain situation where the exposure variable shows cyclic waves such as seasonal patterns and, therefore, cannot control for temporal confounding by design. The further study needs to clarify the applicability of case-crossover design in the situation where the cyclic or temporal patterns of exposure exist.</page><page sequence="63">S64 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 90 CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND THE TRANSMISSION OF ROSS RIVER VIRUS INFECTION IN THE COASTAL REGION OF QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA PENG BI, TONG SHILU, DONALD KEN, PARTON KEVIN, HOBBS JACK. School of Public Health, Queensland University of. EMail: p.bi@qut.edu.au To evaluate the relationship between monthly climatic variables and the transmission of Ross River (RR) virus infection, a serious arbovirus disease in the coastal region of Queensland, Australia, a time-series analysis was conducted over the period of 1985 to 1996. The regression analysis showed that monthly mean minimum temperature, monthly mean high tide, and monthly total amount of rainfall (with a lagged effect of three months, zero, and three months, respectively) are significant in the transmission of the RR virus infection (The regression coefficients are 0.1116, 0.0152 and 0.0005 respectively). Seasonality also played an important role in the development of the disease, with more cases developed in Autumn and Sumner. The results suggested that changes in climate could alter the frequency and distribution of the disease via their effect on the longevity and population density of the vector, mainly Aedes vigilax and Aedes camptorhynchus. It is likely that warmer and wetter conditions are suitable to the development of the vector, and then the transmission of the disease. Therefore, global warming might lead to higher incidence of RR virus infection in the coastal region of Queensland, Australia and more attention needs to be paid. 97 THE USE OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) IN ANALYZING ALLERGY INCIDENCE IN CHILDREN LIVING NEAR TWO POWER PLANTS IN ISRAEL. RONIT PELED, BIBI H, NIR P, SCHIACHI R, SCHARFF S. Barzilai Medical Center, Epidemiology Dept. Ashkelon. EMail: ronitpeled@yahoo.com Two power plants providing electricity throughout Israel operate in the southern part of the country, at a distance of 15 Km one from the other. Over the last 10 years, studies to evaluate the impact of air quality on children's health living in the area were initiated. The Geographic Infor? mation System (GIS), is a computerized technology for the handling and analysis of data through a geographic approach. The data analysis is con? ducted by using a spatial strategy and is presented visually through maps. The Objectives of this study were to determine with the use of GIS whether there are differences in children's allergy incidence, between communities with different air quality. Methods: In 1997 a survey of 6,500 school children were tested for lung function and health status. From this cohort, a nested group of 500 subjects were identified as children with asthma. 447 children were tested for Allergy Prick Test for several allergens. GIS (Mapinfo) and SPSS were used for integrated data analysis: 1. Mapping the positive children according to their exact address. 2. Identifying clusters with high incidence rates. 3. Creating polygons for these cluster 4. Analyzing the statistical differences between polygons. Data on air quality was collected from 10 monitoring stations. Results: Only a polygon around K.Malachi (a highly polluted area), had statistically significant higher allergy incidence rates for dust than the entire region (p=0.000). Conclusion: GIS was found to be efficient technology for analyzing integrated data from various resources and in identifying environment hazards. 92 SOCIAL INDICATORS AND RISK OF VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGH IN KAUNAS NEWBORN POPULATION LIGITA TAKUCIONYTE, GRAZULEVICIENE REGINA. Department of Environmental Sciences, Vytautas. EMail: ligita?jakucionyte@fc.vdu.lt The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between some social indicators (marital status and education level) and risk to de liver a very low birth weight newborn. The epidemiological study comprised all cases (N = 122) of very low birth weight (&lt; 1,500 g) singleton newborns (VLBW), born in 1995-1998 to women, residing in Kaunas city. Controls were matched for birth year. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, behavior, reproductive and medical history was obtained using the standard? ized questionnaires. The prevalence of very low birth weight newborns was 7.95 (95%CI 6.71-9.42) per 1,000 live births. Single women were at two- fold higher risk to deliver VLBW newborns to compare to married women (crude OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.20-3.27), while crude OR for divorced women was 3.59 (95%CI 0.86-12.54). Women, who had completed secondary school, were at 68% higher risk to compare to women with higher education (college or university), crude OR=1.68, 95%CI 1.11-2.53). Crude OR for women with uncompleted secondary education (less than 12 years of edu? cation) was 1.71, 95% CI 0.88-3.27. After adjustment for maternal age, unfavorable obstetrical anamnesis and parental smoking, odds ratio for single mothers was 1.94, 95% CI 1.25-3.01. Adjusted OR associated with low education was 1.23, 95% CI 0.85-1.79. The study results indicated that single and less educated women are at higher risk to deliver a very low birth weight newborn. 98 ADVERSE REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES (ARO) AND EXPO? SURE TO PESTICIDES: THE INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS OF THE CASE-REFERENT STUDY IN KIBBUTZIM ELLA KORDYSH, GOLDSMITH JR, ORYAN I, AVNON L, SOBEL R, BOLOTIN A. Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. EMail: kordish@bgumail.bgu.ac.il Background. The results of our case-referent study in four Negev kibbutzim (agricultural communities) have shown the association of birth defects and spontaneous abortions with paternal occupational exposure to some pesti? cides. In more than 50% of cases the father quitted agricultural work 1-15 years before conception with ARO. The data of this study have been presented at the 14th International Conference on Epidemiology in Occu? pational Health (October 1999, Israel). Aim of the current presentation is to interpret these research outcomes. Results Interpretation. Paternal exposure to pesticides has recently been suggested as a risk factor for ARO. But in studies of this area, epidemiologists are dealing with pre-and periconceptial exposure, which also occurred among part of our cases. Under these condi? tions, direct paternal germ cell mutation may be considered. As for incidents with delayed past exposure we assume several potential pathways: 1) men- tioned above direct effect for pesticides with high ability to accumulation in human tissues; 2) epigenetic or nongenetic disturbances which caused by exposure lead to germ cells alteration, especially in response to some sec? ondary factor. Environmental exposure to the same or others pesticides may save as a trigger. Kibbutz members experience significant environmental exposure to complex mixture from multiple sources (ambient air, water and food products). Chemical analysis of the our samples from these sources (in other group of kibbutzim) found these media to be contaminated by pesti? cides used for fields, orchards and gardens. Therefore all assumed mecha? nisms could take place because of paternal environmental exposure (espe? cially to presently banned) at any time before conception. Moreover, the fathers who were born in kibbutzim could have heritable mutations induced by this residential / and occupational exposures. Maternal environmental exposure to pesticides (with the same above described mechanisms of genetic damage to ovum and one additional - transplacental, related to fetus) is an important factor that was not included in our analysis. Conclusion. Environmental exposure to pesticides in kibbutzim should be consider as a remarkable confounder for paternal occupational exposure.</page><page sequence="64">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S65 99 ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH PROMO- TION;ROLE, INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRAINING IN THE SLO? VAK REPUBLIC GABRIEL GULIS. National Health Promotion Center. EMail: gulis@ncpz.sk Health promotion as it is given by the definition, is a process of enabling people to increase control over their health. One of the key tools for this process is improvement of the environment in which people live. Environ? ment is closely related to human health whether it is natural, social or economic environment. Environmental epidemiology describes relations between the environment and health. The knowledge produced by this process is a milestone for development of health promotion programs. Only a close collaboration of epidemiology and health promotion can provide satisfactory progress in improvement of human health. Therefore training of both epidemiology and health promotion should be closely related. The role of epidemiology in the process should be described by the following: To define risk factors To identify people at risk To measure outcomes To provide appropriate methodology The role of health promotion consists from: Identification of the most appropriate methods of intervention Identification of target groups for intervention Whom we need to train? What kind of infrastructure is necessary for this training? In Slovak Republic, but probably in all former "socialist" countries of central and eastern Europe physicians created the target group for the training. Hygiene, epidemiology and health education have been included in their pre-graduate as well as post-graduate training for long time. Since 1992 within the re-opened Trnava University a School of Public Health was established. Epidemiology, hygiene and health promotion, not only re? stricted to health education have been introduced as major classes at this school. Within the Slovak postgraduate academy of medicine there is another school of public health to provide post-graduate education in both epidemiology and health promotion. So, training of professionals seems to be covered satisfactorily with this infrastructure, yet the health status of pop? ulation does not show satisfactory results. Consequently a separate infra? structure based on the Ministry of Health framework, but primarily serving non-health professional population has been developed in Slovak Republic since 1993. The National Health Promotion Center (NHPC) is a basic unit of this infrastructure. One of the roles of the NHPC is to develop, carry-out and evaluate training of school teachers, journalists, as well as other groups of general population (minorities, . . .) on health promotion, epidemiology, environmental health, and other health related disciplines. 108 INFLUENCE OF BONE RESORPTION ON THE MOBILIZATION OF LEAD FROM BONE AMONG MIDDLE-AGED AND ELDERLY MEN: THE NORMATIVE AGING STUDY SHIRNG-WERN TSAIH, KORRICK S, SCHWARTZ J, LEE M, AM- ARASIRIWARDENA C, ARO A, SPARROW D, HU H. Occupational Health Program, Department of. EMail: rests@channing.harvard.edu Bone stores of lead that were accrued from environmental exposures and that are found in most members of the general population have been recently linked to the development of hypertension, cognitive decrements, and adverse reproductive outcomes. The skeleton is the major endogenous source of lead to circulating blood, particularly during periods of accelerated bone turnover and mineral loss, such as occurs during pregnancy and post? menopausal osteoporosis. To assess the influence of bone resorption rate on the release of lead from bone, we analyzed the relation of bone lead to urine lead in 299 men (mean age 66 years; range 52 to 84 years) using multiple regression analysis with stratification by terciles (low/medium/high) of bone resorption. We evaluated bone resorption by the measurement of cross- linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen in 24-hr urine measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We used a K-x-ray fluorescence instru? ment to measure lead content in cortical (tibia) and trabecular (patella) bone, and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy to measure lead in blood and urine, respectively. After adjusting for age, creatinine clearance, and blood lead, the positive relation of bone lead to urine lead was found to be stronger in the medium and high strata than in the low stratum. Moreover, in the high bone resorption stratum, the contribution of patella lead to urine lead was stronger than that of blood lead to urine lead. The results suggest that bone resorption demonstrably affects the release of bone lead stores into the circulation. 107 CANCER MORTALITY AND WHEAT ACREAGE -A SURRO? GATE FOR CHLOROPHENOXY HERBICIDES DINA SCHREINEMACHERS. Epidemiology&amp;Biomarkers Branch, Human Studies. EMail: schreinemachers.dina@epa.gov Chlorophenoxy herbicides are widely used both in agriculture (cereal grain) and in non-agricultural settings like home lawns and parks. Dioxins are a potential and unwanted contaminant. Studies on carcinogenicity of chloro? phenoxy herbicides have been inconclusive. The current ecological study investigates associations between cancer mortality and acreage of wheat, a surrogate for exposure to chlorophenoxy herbicides. Most spring and durum wheat is grown in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana, with over 90% treated with chlorophenoxy herbi? cides. Counties were selected from these four states if 20% or more of the available land was dedicated to crop land, and if the rural population was at least 50%. The selected counties were divided into three groups based on tertiles of wheat acreage per county. Age-standardized cancer mortality rates during 1980-89 were calculated by gender for these three groups using the first tertile as the reference group for mortality rate ratios. Rare cancers in men and women and cancers in children were studied comparing counties above the median of wheat acreage to those below the median. Preliminary analyses showed dose-response effects for the following sites: in men, rectum, pancreas, larynx, prostate, thyroid, bone, all cancers; in women, oral cavity &amp; tongue, esophagus, stomach, liver &amp; gall bladder &amp; bile ducts, pancreas, cervix, bladder &amp; other urinary organs, all cancers. Increased mortality for rare cancers was observed for cancer of the nose &amp; nasal cavities and eye in both men and women, and brain and leukemia in both boys and girls. This study may generate hypotheses for future studies. 109 SPECIATION OF ARSENIC SPECIES IN URINE BY USING HPLC- ICP-MS - STABILITY AND TRANSFORMATION OF ARSENIC SPECIES YEN-CHING KAREN CHEN, AMARASIRIWARDENA C, LUPOLI N, CHRISTIANI D. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: ycchen@hsph.harvard.edu Background. The analytical method for analyzing arsenic species in urine sam? ples by using HPLC-ICP-MS has been adopted for a decade. Although there are several reports on the speciation of different arsenic species, the importance of urine stability and quantification have not been elucidated. Therefore, the objective of this study is to test the stability of arsenic species in both urine and in arsenic standards, and to improve the quantification of urine sample analysis. Methods. HPLC-ICP-MS is used to analyze the stability of two arsenic standard solutions (10 and 100 mg/1 of each arsenic species: arsenite, As(III); dimethylarsonate, DMA; monomethylarsonate, MMA; arsenate, As(V)) and in urine samples. In order to understand the transformation between As(III) and As(V), two arsenic solutions (100 mg/1 As(III) and As(V)) were analyzed. A lost rate test of arsenic species was performed by passing the samples through a 0.45mm filter. Results. A 10?gg/l arsenic mixed water solution that contains As(III), As(V), DMA, and MMA, but only As(III) increased gradually from the 29th to the 36th day after its preparation (from 10 to around 20?gg/l), and As(V) decreased gradually from the 29th to the 36th day after its preparation (from 10 to around 0?gg/l). A 100?gg/l arsenic mix solution that contains As(III), As(V), DMA, and MMA, but only As(III) increased from the 36th to the 49th day after its preparation (from 100 to aroundl60?gg/l), and As(V) decreased from the 36th to the 49th days after its preparation (from 100 to around 50?gg/l). The stability of the following urine sample (As(III):37.46?gg/l, DMA: 37.62?gg/l, MMA: 7.51?gg/l , As(V): 0.37?gg/l) continued for at least 2 months. The 100?gg/l As(III) water solution keeps the same arsenic level for at least 2 months. The 100?gg/l As(V) water solution begins to gradually transform to As(III) in the 5th week after preparation. The lost rate of arsenic species when pass though the 0.45mm filter was within 5%. Conclusions. The stability of four arsenic species in arsenic water standard lasts for about six weeks, then arsenate gradually transform into arsenite. For urine samples, the stability of four arsenic species could last for at least two months (the test is still undergoing). Arsenic species do not have significant loss when they are passed through the 0.45?gm filter. The urine matrix is complex and plays an important role in stabilize the arsenic species in it.</page><page sequence="65">S66 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 110 THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ARSENIC METHYLATION ABIL?

EMail: ycchen@hsph.harvard.edu Background. The arsenic methylation ability (the ratio of DMA/MMA) may modify the association between cumulative arsenic exposure and the risk of bladder cancer. Research relating nutritional status, methylation ability, cumulative arsenic exposure and the risk of bladder cancer have not been performed and sample sizes of studies to date have been small. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the association between arsenic methylation ability and bladder cancer in a large case-control study in Taiwan. Methods. Two hundred bladder cancer patients (cases) and 400 cataract patients (controls) matched on age and gender were recruited from the National Cheng-Kung University (NCKU) Medical Center from Jan. 1995 to Dec. 1999. The first void spot urine was collected from each study subject, and HPLC-ICP-MS was used to speciate the four arsenic species (arsenite, As(III); arsenate, As(V); monomethylarsonate, MMA; dimethylarsine, DMA) in human urine. A questionnaire was also administered to each subject for collecting the information of residence, nutritional status, per? sonal habits, lifestyle, other risk factors, and personal as well as family history of disease, etc. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze this associa? tion. Results &amp; Conclusions. We are analyzing arsenic metabolites currently. The results and conclusions will be presented in the ISEE meeting. 117 NOZ BACKGROUND LEVELS AT THE ADDRESS OF RESIDENCE ARE MORE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS THAN EXPOSURE ESTIMATES INCLUDING TRAF?

Universitats-Kinderklinik Dresden. EMail: thhirsch@rcs.urz.tu-dresden.de Difficulties to estimate traffic exposure may explain the controversial results of epidemiological studies on the association of traffic exposure with respi? ratory symptoms and atopy. We examined whether traffic counts in the street of residence add health-relevant information to measurements of city background levels of N02. 5421 children (5 - 7 and 9-11 years)in Dresden, Germany, were examined using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children Phase II protocol (questionnaire, lung function testing, bronchial challenge with 4.5 % saline, skin prick test, measurement of specific IgE). The children's home addresses were assigned to Gauss-Kriiger- coordinates to use them in a geographical information system. City back? ground N02 levels were estimated by spatial interpolation using N02 measurements at 114 points distant (&gt; 300 m) from streets with dense traffic (&gt; 5000 cars per day) Individual estimates were then assigned to the children's addresses. For children living within 300 m distance from the next street with dense traffic (n = 4622) an excess N02 exposure was calculated using detailled information on traffic characteristics and local topography. The exposure estimates were validated at 7 continuous monitoring stations (median deviation 6.6 %). Both background and local estimates were alter- natively related to health data for each child. Background exposure was associated more strongly with cough in the morning (adjusted odds ratio 2.1; 95 % confidence interval 1.2 - 3.3) and bronchitis (1.8; 1.2 - 2.6) than local exposure estimates (cough: 1.0; 0.9 - 1.1; bronchitis: 1.2; 1.1 - 1.3). In cross-sectional studies, estimates of local exposure may not reflect true exposure if they do not take into account time activity patterns. 116 LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE ACTIVITY IN HUMAN PLA? CENTA RELATED TO SMOKING HABIT OF MOTHERS ALZBETA KAIGLOVA, REICHRTOVA E, GVOZDJAKOVA A, KU- CHARSKA J, ADAMCAKOVA A. Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine, Bratislava,. EMail: kaigl@upkm.sk Accumulation of toxic compounds of tobacco smoke in the syncytiotropho- blast of placenta may cause hypoxia, resulting in changes of enzyme activities linked to the cellular energy metabolism. After cellular respiratory inhibi? tion, glucose is metabolized through glycolysis rather than through oxidative phosphorylation, providing an alternate source of cellular ATP. Anaerobic glycolytic pathway is associated with increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Under the condition of respiratory inhibition, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) can be formed. In order to remove the excess of ROI, vitamin E plays an important role within the cell membranes. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the smoking habit of pregnant women affects the cellular energy metabolism and antioxidant defense in the placental tissue. Women with normal term deliveries (40?2 weeks of gestation) were selected for the study. 80 fresh samples of full-term placentas were collected at the deliveries in the maternity hospitals. In- formed consent was obtained from subjects. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee. After disintegration and homogenization of the placental tissue, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase was evaluated spec- trophotometrically using LDH-UV kit (Imuna, Sarisske Michalany). Protein content in the samples was measured by the method of Lowry et al.(l). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard for preparing the calibration curve. The level of vitamin E was measured using modified high performance liquid chromatography method of Lang et al. and Takada et al.(2,3) The results of our study showed that the enhanced LDH activity in the human placenta was dependent on the smoking habit of pregnant women investi? gated. The enhanced LDH activity reflects the shift from oxidative phos? phorylation to anaerobic glycolysis as a response to hypoxic condition due to the accumulation of toxic compounds of tobacco smoke in the placental tissue. Decreased level of vitamin E in placental samples from women who had smoked during pregnancy in comparison with nonsmokers could thus reflect a higher demand by the placental tissue of smokers for this antioxi? dant due to increased ROI level. 1.

Institute of Experimental Medicine, Academy of. EMail: bbinkova@biomed.cas.cz It has been hypothesized that mutational events originated from an action of environmental genotoxic chemicals may be involved in atherogenetic pro? cess and that at least a portion of atherosclerotic plaques may be the results of monoclonal proliferation of a single mutated smooth muscle cell (SMC). Therefore, they may be common similarities between the atherosclerosis and cancer, both the diseases generally grouped under so called multifactorial diseases. We are conducting a study to analyze bulky-aromatic DNA adducts in human thoracic aortas (in the DNA isolated from tunica media, which is composed mainly of SMCs) and to assess their relationship to atherosclerotic changes and atherosclerotic risk factors. We found significantly higher DNA adduct levels in the samples collected from sudden death subjects with frequent atherosclerotic changes observed by pathologists in the whole body as compared with the samples from accident death subjects with rare ath? erosclerotic changes (2.35?1.08 vs. 1.42?0.39 adducts/108 nucleotides; each group N = 15). DNA adduct levels significantly correlated with the total and LDL cholesterol in the blood (r=0.545 and 0.453; P= 0.006 and 0.024 for total and LDL cholesterol, respectively), both of them are known as risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. Our preliminary results also indicate an effect of age, smoking and some of genetic susceptibility markers, such as genotypes for carcinogen metabolisms, on DNA adduct levels. The results from this ongoing study suggest that similarities between both multifactorial diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer may exist. It seems that athero- genesis and carcinogenesis may share some common genotoxic action of environmental chemicals.</page><page sequence="66">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S67 125 HYGIENIC ASPECTS OF OCCURENCE AND EPIDEMIC SPREAD OF WATERBORNE AMEBIASIS IN TBILISI, GEORGIA MIKHAIL KURKHULI, GELASHVILI K, NINASHVILI NANULI, GAGUA D. Tbilisi State medical university. EMail: nananinashvili@yahoo.com Increasing fecal contamination of surface water sources is public health's major concern worldwide (especially in developing countries) in terms of prevention of waterborne outbreaks of infectious and parasitic diseases. Solution of this problem depends not only on implementation of international recommenda? tions but also on local natural-geographic, climatic and social-economic condi? tions, including introduction and establishment of national standards on water quality monitoring in accordance with epidemiological situation. Waterborne parasitic disease has appeared in Georgia as an urgent problem since 1998 when over 2000 cases of amebiasis including liver abscesses were registered in Tbilisi. They were revealed in all districts of the city. Investigation of the outbreak confirmed the preliminary hypothesis that drinking water was the source of outbreak and revealed serious shortcomings in the sanitary surveillance service of the country; namely, lack of regulatory documents on monitoring drinking water quality, no assessment of risk of spreading parasitic diseases for prognostic and preventive purposes. In addition no contemporary methods were available to detect amebic cysts and determine contact time with desinfectants for inactivation. Although the outbreak was caused by contamination of Grma- gele surface water source the quality of drinking water before and after distri? bution was within the "Drinking water standard - 82"; E.coli index and number of bacteria per 1 ml water did not exceed the norms (3 and 100 respectively). Residual chlorine mainly was 0.5 mg/1, turbidity ranged within 2.6-3.5 NTU. All these prompted to perform parzitological testing of drinking water. E.hysto- litica cysts were found in 9 samples of untreated water and in 3 and 2 samples of treated water before distribution and after distribution respectively. Bacteri- ological indicators ofthe same samples were within standard. In order to control the outbreak the following measures were carried out: turbidity was decreased to 2 NTU, level of residual chlorine raised to 0.7 mg/1, because ofthe resistance of cysts to desinfectants it was decided to determine contact time (CT - were C- residual chlorine in mg/1, T- time in minutes). Due to double chlorination and increased level of residual chlorine CT raised from 48.5 to 75. Thus elaboration of the national drinking water standard became necessary. Along with turbidity and bacteriological criteria it includes parazitological testing of surface and treated water. As for sanitary surveillance purposes barrier capacity of water treatment facilities, level of water contamination and CT measurement were proposed to be considered at an early stage of drinking water source selection. 128 EXPOSURE TO AIRBORNE ARSENIC: A REVIEW OF RECENT EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH HEMANTHA WICKRAMATILLAKE, FRYER P, HARRISON P. MRC Institute for Environment and Health. EMail: hdwml@le.ac.uk Arsenic is ubiquitous in the environment. Depending on the chemical com- pound to which it is combined, arsenic usually exists in organic or inorganic form, the latter form being the most harmful. Arsenic is released into land and atmospheric environments via number of natural and anthropogenic processes. This paper reviews the epidemiological research related to atmospheric expo? sures. Airborne arsenic causes more health effects on the respiratory passages and the lung. Chronic exposures can also cause neurotoxic effects, skin lesions, developmental abnormalities in foetuses and excess cancers also in other organs. This review concentrates on lung cancer as the critical health effect. As far as the inhalation route is concerned, dusts and vapours in occupational settings represent the biggest source of exposure. The levels in these settings are con? siderably higher than the levels breathed by the general population. Occupa? tional studies have shown a clear dose-response relationship between airborne arsenic and lung cancer. The dose-response curve observed in occupational studies has been used to estimate effects at lower levels, but the validity of such extrapolation has been debated. Research published so far demonstrates many uncertainties related to the dose-response relationship at these low levels of exposure. Researchers examining have presented different dose-response pat? terns, but all seem to be in favour of a curvilinear relationship with a steep slope at lower doses. However, whether toxicological mechanisms explain such a behaviour is not certain. The few studies conducted relating to carcinogenicity and exposure to airborne arsenic in non-occupational settings, also point to a risk of lung cancer from such exposure. Both occupational and non-occupational studies related to airborne arsenic suffer from various limitations. One limitation to an occupational exposure study is that exposure data are usually difficult to obtain, especially from earlier time periods when exposure levels were higher than in the recent past. This is further complicated by the fact that significant oral and dermal exposures are also likely to occur under these conditions and that exposure to other metals and chemicals is also common, apart from smoking in case of smoking employees. The reports from non-occupational settings should be considered cautiously . Some of them are flawed due to use of inappropriate controls, scarcity of information about length of residence of the population at those site areas, lack of information about smoking habits and exact exposure levels of arsenic and possible exposure to other contaminants. 126 ASSESSMENT OF CANCER RISK FROM AIR POLLUTION IN THE REGION OF BASEL, SWITZERLAND MARTIN ROOSLI, KUNZLININO, OGLESBY L, MATHYS P, THEIS G, CAMENZIND M, BRAUN-FAHRLANDER CHARLOTTE. Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of. EMail: Martin.Roeoesli@unibas.ch The cancer risk from different air pollutants is usually assessed by calculating the lifetime risk (unit risk) associated with exposure to 1/Ag/m3 of a given carcinogen. Different international agencies have published variable unit risks for the same carcinogen (diesel), reflecting different models and data sources to compute the unit risk. Risk assessment based on the unit risk approach is limited by the fact that the risks of single pollutants have to be added ignoring unmeasured chemicals and interactions among chemicals. Ambient air, however, contains a mix of different pollutants some of which have cancerogenic potential. An alternative approach to assess cancer risk of ambient air pollution is therefore to estimate the risk associated with exposure to an indicator of exposure such as ambient particulates. The present study aimed at comparing the two approaches for the Basel popula? tion. PM10 was taken as an indicator of exposure to ambient air pollution. We derived the relation between PM10 and lung cancer incidence from the three U.S. cohort studies. The reported relative risks varied considerably and were strongly influenced by the cancer incidence of the base population. We therefore calculated the absolute number of lung cancer cases per year and per 10 ju,g/m3 increase of PM10 (attributable cases), thus reducing consid? erably the variability between the estimates of the three studies. Applying this approach to the PM10 exposure of the Basel population we calculated that 9.0 (CI: 1.6; 16.5) cases of cancer per year and lOO'OOO persons were to be expected. Alternatively, the cancer risk was quantified as sum of the unit risk estimates for diesel, Butadiene, CrVI, PAH, Benzene, Cd, As, 1,4- Dichlorobenzene, Pb and Trichlorethylene, resulting in 0.8 cases (range of 0.14 to 14-6) per year and lOO'OOO persons. So far little experiences has been made in the cancer risk assessments with the method of the attributable cases. However, this more integrative method allows to handle some of the known insufficiencies of the unit risk method. We therefore concluded that the method of the attributable cases using an integrated indicator of expo? sure like PM may be an appropriate procedure to quantify the cancer risks associated with ambient air pollution. 129 ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE: KNOWLEDGE, AC? TIONS AND INFORMATION PREFERENCES EMMA GREEN, SHORT SIMON. MRC Institute for Environment and Health. EMail: egl5@le.ac.uk The risks to health associated with poor indoor air quality are high on the agenda of many scientists, health professionals and regulators. Despite these levels of professional interest, a recent pilot postal survey indicated that concern about indoor air pollution from a public perspective was much lower. A large-scale social survey was, therefore, conducted to explore in depth public levels of awareness, knowledge and information preferences relating to indoor air quality and risks to health. A structured questionnaire was incorporated into a Random Omnibus survey of British adults aged 15 years and over. A total of 1512 face-to-face interviews were conducted by NOP Solutions using Computer Assisted Interviewing techniques. This paper presents the results of this survey, focusing primarily on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The research summarised here suggests that although general awareness about indoor air pollution is low (68% of respondents said that they had neither heard nor read about how domestic air quality may affect health), there is a high level of awareness and understanding about ETS exposure and health risks, even among smokers. However, many people (43%), including a large minority of non-smokers, do not take measures to limit ETS in their own domestic environment. Groups least likely to impose smoking restric? tions in the home include older individuals, those in lower socio-economic groups, individuals without children and those who smoke or live with a smoker. Following implementation of smoking restrictions in most public places, a large proportion of ETS exposure occurs in the home. However, reductions in domestic ETS levels have proved difficult to achieve, partly because the home environment is not seen as appropriate for regulatory intervention. There is, therefore, a need to develop alternative approaches to galvanise and mobilise support for making non-smoking a social norm in the home (e.g. by encouraging the non-smoking majority to effect changes in smoking behaviours - social mobilisation). The results of this survey will help to identify target groups for future efforts in this area and the implications of these findings for risk communication are discussed.</page><page sequence="67">S68 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 130 LUNG CANCER IN LIFETIME NONSMOKING MEN - RESULTS OF A CASE-CONTROL STUDY IN GERMANY MICHAELA KREUZER, GERKEN MICHAEL, KREIENBROCK LO- THAR, WELLMANN JUERGEN, WICHMANN H.ERICH. GSF-Institute of Epidemiology and BfS-Institute of. EMail: mkreuzer@bfs.de Objectives: Limited information about risk factors for male nonsmoking lung cancer patients is available, because only 2% of male cases had never smoked in their life. The purpose of this case-control study conducted among lifetime nonsmoking men between 1990 and 1996 in Germany was to examine lung cancer risk in relation to occupation, environmental tobacco smoke, residential radon and other risk factors. Methods: A total of 58 male incident lung cancer patients (histologically or cytologically confirmed) and 803 randomly selected male population con? trols who had never smoked more than 400 cigarettes in their lifetime were personally interviewed by a standardized questionnaire with respect to oc? cupational history, environmental tobacco smoke during childhood and adulthood (spouse, at the workplace, in vehicles and social settings), a family history of cancer in at least one first degree relative and previous lung diseases. In addition one-year radon measurements in the living and bed? room of the subjects last dwelling were conducted. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. All odds ratios were adjusted for age and region. Results: Having ever worked in a job with known lung carcinogens was associated with a two-fold significantly increased lung cancer risk ((Odds ratio) OR=2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-5.0). The OR for work? ing more than 10 years in such jobs was 3.7 (95% CI: 1.3-10.4). The linear trend test for lung cancer risk associated with radon exposure was statistically significant, demonstrating an excess relative risk for an increase in exposure of 100 Bq/m3 of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.01-0.70). Slightly elevated effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at the workplace (OR=1.3; 95% CI: 0.45-4.0) and in public transportation or social settings (OR=2.0; 95% CI: 0.89-4.85) were observed among highly exposed men. No clear effects of family history of cancer or previous lung disease were seen.' Conclusion: Our results indicate that occupational carcinogens and indoor radon play an important role for lung cancer in lifetime nonsmoking men.

IITKA PIKHARTOVA, BOBAK MARTIN, PIKHART HYNEK, DANOVA JANA, CELKO MARTIN A., KRIZ BOHUMIR. Czech Na? tional Institute of Public Health. EMail: jpikhartova@hotmail.com The association between outdoor sulfur dioxide (S02) and asthma has been controversial. While long term levels of S02 do not seem associated with the risk of asthma, it has been proposed that S02 may provoke asthmatic episodes in children with existing asthma. This hypothesis was tested in a cross-sectional study of 2364 primary school children aged 7-11 in one district of Prague (Czech Republic). S02 con? centrations were measured by passive samplers at 50 sites during two weeks of February 1996; episodes of wheezing / whistling during these two weeks were recorded by a questionnaire completed by parents. History of atopy was established by a questionnaire administered 6 months before this study. Geographical information system was used to estimate individual exposures to S02. The effect of S02 on wheezing / whistling during the pollution survey was estimated in logistic regression separately for atopic and non? atopic children. The mean concentration of S02 was 83.9 (SD 11.7) /ig/m3. Among the 618 children with a history of atopy, the odds ratio of wheezing during the survey was 1.32 (95% CI 0.91-1.91) per 10 )LLg/m3 increase in S02. Among the 1746 healthy children, the odds ratio was 0.94 (95% CI 0.68-1.28). Further adjustment for potential confounders did not substantially change the re? sults. Although statistically non-significant, these results support the hypothesis that S02 may have acute respiratory effects in children with history of asthma or atopy but not among healthy children. 131 CARBON MONOXIDE EXPOSURE IN AUSTRALIAN WORK? PLACES AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO ACUTE MYOCARDIAL ISCHAEMIA HEMANTHA WICKRAMATILLAKE, GUN RT, RYAN P. MRC Insti? tute for Environment and Health. EMail: hdwml@le.ac.uk Introduction Low blood carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) levels, which may be reached as a result of exposure to carbon monoxide in occupational settings or urban environments, have been shown experimentally to precipitate myocardial ischaemia in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD). This study ex? amined the contribution made by CO exposure in Australian work places to workers' COHb levels, and to assess whether COHb levels are high enough to present a risk of myocardial ischaemia to any workers who may have recognised or unrecognised CAD. Method Indoor situations, where CO exposure was likely to be greatest, were con? sidered for the study as they would maximise the opportunity of detecting the effects of CO. Ambient CO levels and end-expired CO levels (latter as the predictor of COHb) were measured two hourly and the number of cigarettes smoked over the shift was recorded in the case of smoking workers. Results The mean breathing zone CO levels throughout the shift ranged from 3-12 ppm. Mean COHb levels ranged from 0.7% - 2.1% in non-smokers and 2.1% - 7.6% in smokers, except for a single reading of 12.5% in one smoking fork lift operator. Exposed workers showed a significantly higher COHb level than the non-exposed, both in smokers and non-smokers. Multivariate analysis showed cigarette smoking to be a more important contributor than environmental CO to workers' COHb level. Conclusions Under prevailing conditions in industries where combustion takes place indoors, CO exposures are unlikely to be high enough to cause myocardial ischaemia in non-smokers. However, in a worker with pre-existing CAD, whose COHb level is already burdened with CO from cigarette smoking, an increment from such occupational environments could be sufficient to induce myocardial ischaemia. 134 CHLORINATED DRINKING WATER AND RISK OF RENAL CELL AND PANCREAS CANCERS: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY IN IOWA, USA KENNETH P.

Methods: A population-based case-control study of 406 incident renal cell cancer patients and 376 pancreas cancer cases, diagnosed in 1985-1987, and 2,434 controls, was conducted in Iowa (USA). Information on residential history, drinking water source, tap water intake, cigarette smoking habit, and demographic and other risk factors was gathered by a mail questionnaire. Surrogate estimates of lifetime exposures to chlorination byproducts were developed by combining questionnaire data with historical water utility data. In addition, recent measurements of trihalomethanes were applied retrospec? tively to Iowa water supplies used by respondents. Included in the analysis were 317 renal cell cases, 279 pancreas cancer cases, and 1983 controls for whom exposure information was available for at least 70% of lifetime. Relative risks were estimated by odds ratios (OR) calculated using uncon- ditional logistic regression models. Results: After controlling for age, smok? ing habit, and other potential confounders, we found no association for either cancer site with duration of exposure to drinking water from chlori? nated surface water sources or with THM estimates. Relative to persons who never lived at places served by chlorinated surface drinking water (OR= 1.0), the ORs for renal cell cancer were 0.86, 0.81, and 1.14 for 1-19, 20-39, and 40+ years using a chlorinated surface source of drinking water. The ORs for pancreas cancer, using comparable duration measures, were 0.97, 1.39, and 0.89. Results were similar for men and for women, and were not confounded by occupation, dietary practices, or other factors. Conclusions: In this study, we found no association between risk of renal cell cancer or of pancreas cancer with long-term consumption of drinking water containing disinfec? tion byproducts.</page><page sequence="68">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S69 136 CLIMAT CHANGE AND HEALTH: SECONDARY BENEFITS OF CLIMATE POLICIES MAY BE MORE RELEVANT NINO KUENZLI, EBERLE TILMAN, KAHLMEIER SONJA, BRAUN- FAHRLANDER CHARLOTTE. Inst. for Social &amp; Preventive Med Uni Basel. EMail: Nino.Kuenzli@unibas.ch Global climate changes may have considerable long-term impact on health (e.g., shift of global distribution of diseases, increase in extreme weather conditions) . Health aspects may provide key arguments to promote policies which aim at a reduction of the anthropogenic impact on climate change. However, in many regions, particularly in rich countries with the highest per capita emission of relevant gases, the health impact may not be apparent in the near future. The lack of clear short-term local health benefits of climate policies may be one reason for the reluctance of many countries to locally promote climate policies. We argue that there is a need to establish, quantify, and communicate potential secondary health benefits of climate change policies. Primary benefits of environmental policies are the reduction of the anthropogenic impact on global climate change, whereas 'secondary health benefits' describe the non-climate effects of these policies on health in the local population. We identified caveats and areas of secondary benefits for Swiss climate change policies: ? Greenhouse gas reduction strategies do not by default have positive effects on local public health; depending on the strategies, public health may lose, gain, or not be affected. ? Substantial secondary benefits can be expected from clean air policies, target- ing at the reduction of fossil fuel emissions (primary benefits) which, at the same time, decrease a variety of health relevant primary and secondary air pollutants. ? Traffic is a key target area to achieve benefits. The largest secondary health benefits will stern from integrated policies, taking technology, urban planning, speed, safety, quality of life, self-sustained mobility, and public transport into account. The mere focus on technology, e.g. promoting diesel engines to reduce C02 emissions may, however, increase the adverse effects of traffic due to the higher load in fine particulate and emission of carcinogens. ? Energy consumption for heating may be reduced by tightening buildings; however, potential adverse health effects due to decreased air exchange and increased indoor pollution may lead to secondary loss. ? Primary climate policies in agriculture may be a source of secondary benefits (by an increase in fruit/vegetable consumption) or of secondary loss if long-range transport and type of production (e.g., organically grown) of agricultural goods are ignored as a health relevant aspect (traffic, air and soil/water pollution). Interdisciplinary research, including the development of common indicators, is needed to valuate the secondary loss and benefit of different climate policies. National Environmental Health Action Plans may provide the framework for integrated policies to achieve primary and secondary benefits of climate policies. 138 AN OUTBREAK OF CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING AFTER ICE STORM, MAINE, 1998 RANDOLPH DALEY, SMITH A, PAZ-ARGANDONA E, MALILAY JOSEPHINE, MCGEEHIN M. CDC. EMail: wcdO@cdc.gov Background: More people in the U.S. die accidently from carbon monoxide (CO) than any other toxicant and CO poisoning outbreaks following winter storms have previously occurred. A major ice storm struck Maine on January 7, 1998. Our objective was to describe cases of post-storm CO poisoning, determine important risk factors and prevent future deaths. Methods: We reviewed medical records for all laboratory-confirmed cases of CO poisoning (carboxyhemoglobin levels &gt;2% in non-smokers, &gt;9% in smokers) diagnosed between January 7 and 20, 1998 from four hospitals in Maine. Questionnaires were administered to an adult from each household experiencing one or more poisoning cases and to 522 control households randomly-selected from the hospitals' primary service areas. Case households were compared to controls. Results: We identified 100 cases of CO poisoning, involving 42 separate house? holds. Most cases occurred during the first week following the storm. Though classic symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and nausea predominated, nine patients presented with chest pain. One patient died and five required hyper- baric oxygen therapy. Gasoline-powered electric generators were the CO source in 30 households, kerosene heaters in 8, and propane heaters in 4. Among control households, 31.4% used generators after the storm and 4.2% operated a generator in an attached garage. The strongest risk factor for poisoning in generator-associated incidents was locating the generator in a basement (odds ratio [OR]=312.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]=27.6-13,774.5) or in an attached garage (OR=19.0, 95% CI=5.0-85.6). Conclusion/Public Health Impact: This was the largest post-storm outbreak of CO poisoning ever documented. Generators were the major CO source and generator location the strongest risk factor. Emergency departments should expect CO poisoning cases of varying presentations and severity following winter storms. The Maine Bureau of Health introduced electric bill inserts to prevent generator-associated CO poisoning. CDC alerted health departments and hospitals of this hazard following subsequent disas- ters and is working with industry on awareness. 137 TORNADO-RELATED MORTALITY IN OKLAHOMA ON MAY 3, 1999 RANDOLPH DALEY, ARCHER P, MALLONEE S, JORDAN F, ASHER S. CDC. EMail: wcdO@cdc.gov Background: Between 1994 and 1998, tornadoes resulted in more than 200 deaths nationwide. We examined circumstances surrounding tornado-re- lated deaths from the May 3, 1999, tornadoes in Oklahoma. Methods: We reviewed medical examiner records on deaths related to the May 3 tornadoes and interviewed next-of-kin to determine additional in? formation on the circumstances of death. Results: A total of 45 tornado-related deaths were reported. Ages of dece- dents ranged from 3 weeks to 94 years (mean = 48, median = 46); 25 were female and 20 male. Of the 45 deaths, 42 were from injuries and 3 were from cardiac arrest. Fatal tornado injuries occurred in various locations: 20 in single-family homes, 6 in mobile homes, 4 in apartments, 1 in a public building, 1 in a motor vehicle, 7 outdoors, and 3 undetermined. In single- family homes, 7 deaths occurred in closets, 3 in bathtubs, and 3 elsewhere in a bathroom. No deaths occurred in a basement or underground shelter, though one occurred on stairs while entering a basement. Four deaths occurred outdoors when individuals fled their homes and two when motorists sought shelter under bridges. Conclusion: Most deaths occurred from injuries received inside homes. Basements and underground shelters appeared to offer the most protection. 140 WORKPLACE CUMULATIVE NOISE AND BLOOD PRESSURE SANG-YUN LEE, CHO S, KANG D, KIM J, JU Y, CHOI S, IM H, YOON K. Department of Preventive Medicine, Seoul Natioal. EMail: ilich@snu.ac.kr The association of workplace cumulative noise exposure and blood pressure was investigated in this study using cross-sectional design. The study popu? lation comprised 852 manufacturing male workers about whom general occupational health examination data, specific occupational health exami? nation data, questionnaire and personnel records were available. Workplace ambient noise monitoring data was used for calculating individual cumula? tive noise exposure level. Mean of each systolic and diastolic blood pressure of general occupational health examination data and specific occupational health examination data was used for individual systolic and diastolic blood pressure level. Possible confounding variables including family history of hypertension, smoking habit, alcohol drinking habit were collected by ques? tionnaire. On the basis of job location and duration of work at the location, a cumulative time-weighted average noise level was calculated for each workers. According to this cumulative noise exposure level, each study subject was categorized as low noise exposure group, moderate noise exposure group, high noise exposure group, very high noise exposure group. Among noise exposure groups, mean of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and prevalence of hypertension was compared after adjusting possible confound? ing variables such as age, body mass index, serum cholesterol level, family history of hypertension, smoking history, alcohol drinking habit. After adjusting possible confounding variables, noise exposure group was signifi? cant explanatory variables for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and mean of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of very high exposure group was higher than that of low exposure group. In addition, prevalence of hypertension was significantly different among exposure groups and after adjusting possible confounding variables, the prevalence odds ratio was, 2.9(1.09-7.91) in moderate exposure group, 3.7(1.36-10.52) in high expo? sure group, 4-1(1.48-12.23) in very high exposure group. This increasing trend was statistically significant by trend test. In conclusion, there was dose-response relationship between cumulative noise exposure and preva? lence of hypertension and these findings suggested that the cumulative noise exposure might be the risk factor of hypertension.</page><page sequence="69">S70 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 142 CORRELATION BETWEEN INDICATORS OF BIOLOGICAL EF? FECT IN OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE TO LEAD LIGIA FAT, GYORFFY LUDOVIC, GHIURCA MARIANA. Institute of Public Health, str. Pasteur nr.6 Cluj 3400,. EMail: ligiafat@usa.net Objectives: The special literature shows that both occupational and environ? mental exposure to lead affect the human health. Once in organism, lead initial produce the physiological absorption state, than the high absorption state that can be diagnosticated using toxicological investigations. Clinical manifestations appear when the absorbed lead is higher than the eliminated lead, generating the acute or chronic intoxication. The transition from one state to another depends on the exposure time and noxes concentration. The aim of this study is to analyze comparative, using some specific and precocious affected biological indicators, two groups of people occupational and environmental exposed to lead. Methods: We investigated 195 workers from the" melting" sector of a non- ferrous metallurgic plant with the mean-age=31,81?8,19 years and the mean- time of exposure=9,03?6,67 years and 255 people who work in the adminis? trative sector of the same factory and live in the proximity, with the mean- age=35,66?8,49 years and the mean-time of exposure=7,73?6,16 years. We made clinical exam, biotoxicological investigations, urinary delta amino levu- linic acid (ALA-u), zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), standard questionnaires regard? ing the effects of lead on the human organism, neurological and psychological exams. The air lead exceeded 71,3 times the maximum accepted values. Results: We found high values of ZPP, over 10 /Ltg/1, in 78,6% exposed workers and 28,2% people from the environmental group. In the environ? mental group (aged 20?35 years and length of service under 5 years) 19,1% had ZPP over 10 /utg/1. High values of ALA-u, over 10 mg/l, were found in 68,1% of the exposed workers and 27,4% from the environmental group. In the group aged 20-35 years and length of service under 5 years, 62,9% workers and 16,6% controls had values over 10 mg/l. There were concor- dance between ZPP and ALA-u values (r=0,567, p&lt;0,001). Conclusions: There were significant differences between the exposed and control group regarding the values of the intoxication marker ZPP (p&lt;0,001) and also for the values of ALA-u which is specific for the lead intoxication (p&lt;0,001). There were also significant differences regarding ZPP and ALA-u values between the two groups (aged 20-35 years and working length under 5 years) (p&lt;0,001). The most affected and sensible were the youngers. The general and professional morbidity correspond with the clinical and toxicological data. 154 COMPARISON OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL LEAD EFFECT ON HEARING. CSABA SZANTO. Institute of Public Health Cluj-Napoca Romania. EMail: ocupatio@jeffmcm.ispcj.ro Aim: The study of the lead effect upon the hearing ability of workers exposed professional, women and children exposed environmental by lead (smelter factory), in comparison with control groups (workers, women and children) from non-lead polluted town. Method: The workers and women have 20-55 years, children have 7-12 years, they never moved off the town. The lead concentration in the environment exceeded by 50-100 times the normal values {0,0001 mg/m3/ 24h), in contrast with the working places, where exceeded by 40-80 times the maximal admissible value (0,1 mg/m3). The exposed groups comprised 152 workers (non-noise polluted workplace), 77 women and 152 children. The reference groups was constitute from 70 workers, 75 women and 150 children with same age as exposed ones, were selected from no-lead polluted town (having an identical density of population and motor traffic or work? place), respectively. All groups were tested by air and bone conducted audiometer in a sound isolated chamber. The blood lead assessments were used as an indicator of exposure The exposed and non-exposed blood lead concentration of subjects was determined using the spectophotometric method (300 type Perkin Elmer apparatus). Results: The biochemical tests performed in the exposed women evidenced a blood lead level between 15-40 mg/dl, in contrast with higher levels of blood lead among children and workers, between 20-70 mg/dl. The blood lead levels in all persons from reference groups were under 15 mg/dl. The median audiometry difference between exposed and non exposed women show a 10 and 9 dB for 6 and 8 kHz. The similar values between exposed and non-exposed workers and children was observed. 150 REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS: CHANGES IN ACTIVITY OF DELTA-AMINOLAEVULINIC ACID DEHYDRATASE OF WORK? ERS EXPOSED TO LEAD RIMA KREGZDYTE, BARANAUSKIENE DALE, NAGINIENE RIMA. Institute for Biomedical Research, Kaunas University of. EMail: rimak@kma.lt Repeated measures are often carried out in environmental epidemiology. They are useful for more precise evaluation of changes in human body systems. Delta-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (d-ALAD) is important part of haem biosynthesis. The activity of d-ALAD is one of the most sensitive biological indicators of lead toxicity. The objective of this study was to assess d-ALAD activity of workers, occupationally exposed to lead, in dependence on exposure time. Biological monitoring has been conducted over 3 years (1998-2000). 14 workers of Kaunas Electricity Network were observed. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for evaluation of changes in d-ALAD activity and blood lead (PbB) concen? tration over all period. Data multiple comparison between each pair of year was made using paired t-test with Bonferroni correction. Results of ANOVA indicated significant differences in d-ALAD activity (p&lt;0.05) and PbB concentration (p&lt;0.05). The paired t-test showed that d-ALAD activity was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) in the 3rd year than that in the 1st and 2nd year of the study. Whereas, PbB concentration was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in the 3rd year comparing with that in the 1st and 2nd year. Significant differences were between measurements of the 1st year and the 2nd year. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to lead is related to negative changes in d-ALAD activity and disorders in haem biosynthesis. 156 DATA AND SPECIMEN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR LARGE SCALE INTERNATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES IN RE?

FILLS WITH SOIL GAS MIGRATION: NEW YORK STATE, 1980- 1989 ELIZABETH L. LEWIS-MICHL. NYSDOH. EMail: ell01@health.state.ny.us Objective: The New York State Department of Health conducted this study to find out if people living near certain landfills had an increased risk of cancer. Previous investigations had shown that, particularly at older munic? ipal landfills, methane creation and soil gas migration can carry hazardous chemicals beyond landfill boundaries. Methods: This record-linkage, population-based case-control study mapped the addresses at diagnosis for people with seven types of cancer and age-matched controls ascertained from non-cancer deaths for zip codes containing 38 landfills in New York State. From exposure assessments conducted for 245 landfills in the state, 38 were selected for study based on soil gas, hazardous chemical, and geological data. For 33 of the landfills in the study, the potential exposure area extended 250 feet from the landfill boundary; for four landfills, it extended 500 feet, and for one landfill, 1000 feet. The residential locations of 9,020 cases of leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, liver, lung, kidney, bladder and brain cancer among males and females were compared with the residential locations of controls, and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for each type of cancer and sex. Results: Of the people in the study zip codes diagnosed with any of the seven types of cancer over the ten-year period 1980-1989, fewer than one percent (49) lived in the landfill potential exposure areas (rings) at diagnosis. Fewer than one percent of the controls lived in the potential exposure rings. The analyses showed statistically significantly elevated risks for bladder cancer (OR= 4.08 CI: 1.36-12.21) and leukemia (OR=4-76, CI: 1.37-16.53) among women residing in the landfill potential exposure rings at diagnosis. Analyses using ecological data to control for potential confounders produced slightly higher odds ratios for bladder cancer (OR=5.52) and leukemia (OR=5.13) among women. Neither the crude nor adjusted analyses showed statistically significantly elevated risks associated with potential landfill exposures for male bladder cancer or leukemia, or for the other cancers for males or females, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, liver, lung, kidney or brain cancer. Conclusions: These positive findings warrant additional research. In order to address limitations due to small numbers and potential bias related to the use of deceased controls, a follow-up study is being conducted, extending this study's time-frame and using a different source for control ascertainment. None of the study's landfills remain open today and a variety of remedial actions, depending on specific site characteristics, have occurred at closed landfills. 160 CARBON MONOXIDE LEVELS IN A CITY, AND ITS, RELATION? SHIP TO TRAFFIC DENSITY AND, INFLUENCE ON ACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS HEMANTHA WICKRAMATILLAKE. MRC Institute for Environment and Health. EMail: hdwml@le.ac.uk Introduction and objectives Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the major air pollutants that has the potential for adversely affecting human health. Apart from industrial and domestic situations, the urban environment can be consid? ered as the other major setting making CO a major contributor to its air composition. While research work has examined the CO levels in cities in the west, data on CO levels in Australia are sparse. Therefore, the main objective of this study, though with limitations, was to examine and evaluate the CO levels in an Australian city, in winter and summer. The other objectives were to estimate the CO levels at different sites in a busy street and examine the relationship of the source of CO (i.e. traffic density) to the CO levels at these different sites. Further, the study, by measuring carboxyhameglobin (COHb) levels of traffic police officers, also examined the acute cardiovascular risk posed, if any, to occupational groups who are exposed to the levels measured. Method CO levels were measured, at different sites, in two of the busiest streets and a less busy street, as the control street, in Adelaide. Carbon monoxide levels were monitored only during the day time hours on weekdays to enable to assess the maximum contribution made by traffic. Traffic counts were made approximately 2-4 minutes before CO measurements were taken. Breathing zone CO levels and the blood COHb levels (using the end-expired method) of traffic police officers were measured on two different occasions during the winter of 1994. Results Carbon monoxide levels in the busy streets were significantly higher than those of the less busy street. There was no difference in the CO levels between the two seasons studied. Both in winter and summer, open-door shops by the busy streets had a higher CO level than the closed-door shops. The traffic density did not associate strongly with the CO levels at different sites. A traffic policeman recorded a COHb level of 2%, a level that could precipitate myo? cardial ischaemia in those with narrowed coronary arteries. Conclusions The CO levels measured were within the USEPA and WHO environmental standards. However, they could pose an acute cardiovascular risk to smokers and those with narrowed coronary arteries working in an urban setting. 158 RISK FOR CHILDREN LIVING IN THREE RUSSIAN COPPER- PRODUCING AREAS: MODELING AND CONFIRMATION L PRIVALOVA, KATSNELSON B, MALYKH O, VORONIN S, GURV- ICH V, KUSMIN S, RUBIN C, KEANE S, WILCOCK K. URALS BRANCH CPPI. EMail: LARISAP@OCSEN.MPLIK.RU This study examined environmental lead pollution in the Urals town-ships of Krasnouralsk (K), Pervouralsk (P), and Upper Pyshma (UP). Main sources of lead in these towns are copper smelting and refining. Based on available monitoring data, lead exposure of pre-school chil-dren through ambient air, water, soil and food was estimated, and their PbB was computed with the help of the US EPA "Uptake/Biokinetic Model for Lead - Version 0.99d". In Krasnouralsk and Pervouralsk, representative groups of children were se? lected for the blood lead level (PbB) sampling, while in the Upper Pysma, PbB in children was estimated based on existing data on hair lead. In Pervouralsk the model predicted for children aged 3-7 mean PbB=7.6 /ig/dl and lev-els&gt; 10 ju-g/dl in 25 percent of the population; the blood lead sampling found a geometric mean of 7.4 /Ag/dl, with 26 percent about 10 jLLg/dl. In the more lead-polluted environment of Krasnouralsk, the model prediction (geometric mean of 11.4 /Ag/dl) was also in good accor-dance with sampling data obtained on 2 different groups of children (12.2 and 11.2 /xg/dl, respectively); the model predicted PbB&gt;10 /u,g/dl in 59 percent, while sampling showed 64 percent, and 60 percent, re-spectively. In Upper Py? shma, modeling gave PbB of 8.1 /xg/dl (29% with PbB&gt;10 /mg/dl) while the PbB value estimated from hair lead level was 7.3 /mg/dl. These results indicate that use of the multimedia lead monitoring data as inputs to this model provides reliable esti-mates of the real exposure. Modeling indicated food and soil/dust lead as the most important exposure pathways; sources of lead in food and soil/dust are believed to be primarily deposition from airborne sources. These issues were taken into consideration when proposing a pre? ventive strategy. 161 OCCUPATIONAL MAGNETIC FIELD EXPOSURE AND SEVERE COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION EUGENE SOBEL, TSENG CHIU-CHEN, DAVANIPOUR ZOREH, ARANDA MARIA, MARKIDES KYRIAKOS. University of Southern California. EMail: esobel@hsc.usc.edu OBJECTIVE: To investigate a possible relationship between working in occupations with significant magnetic field (MF) exposure and subsequent severe cognitive dysfunction. STUDY DESIGN: During 1993-1994, 3050 elderly Mexican Americans living in California, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas were se? lected by a structured random sample for a longitudinal epidemiologic study of health. SEVERE COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION and OCCUPATIONAL CLAS? SIFICATION: MiniMental State Exam (MMSE) and primary occupational data were collected as part of the extensive baseline information. Severe cognitive dysfunction was defined as a score below 10 on the MMSE. Blinded to MMSE score, occupations were classified into low, medium or high MF exposed categories. RESULTS: Among subjects with occupational and MMSE data, 1.4% had a MMSE score below 10 and 11.2% had a primary occupation with medium or high MF exposure. There was a clear trend of increased severe cognitive dysfunction with increasing age, but no difference between men and women. Occupations with medium or high MF exposure were statistically signifi? cantly (p=0.02) related to severe cognitive dysfunction through an inter? action with age: odds ratio (OR)=2.8, 95% CI=1.2-6.8, for ages 75-84; OR = 7.8, 95% CI= 1.4-46.2, for ages 85 + . Combining the older age groups into 75 + , the interaction OR was 3.4 (p=0.01, 95% CI=1.3-9.3). For the comparison between low and high MF occupations, the MF x age group interaction ORs for ages 75-84 and 85+ were significant at the 0.001 level: 7.0 (95% CI=2.2-22.4) and 49.0 (95% CI=4.8-501.8), while for ages 75+ the OR was 9.4 (p&lt;0.0001, 95% CI=3.0-28.9). The interactions between age group and histories of stroke and ever having smoked were also significantly related to severe cognitive dysfunction. Only 7 (0.5%) of the subjects aged 65-74 had a MMSE score below 10 and none of these 7 had an occupation with medium or high MF exposure. Therefore, analyses were also carried out for the 75+ age group. The interaction between medium or high MF exposed occupations and ever having smoked was statistically significant with an OR of 3.5 (p&lt;0.001, 95% CI=1.1-10.9). For the comparison of low vs high MF exposed occupations, high MF exposure had an OR of 8.9 (p&lt;0.0001; 95% CI=2.8-28.5). The MMSE cutpoint for severe cognitive dysfunction was then progressively raised, and the analyses were repeated. The results were stable through a cutpoint score of 15. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this and earlier studies indicate that working in a MF exposed occupation increases the risk of severe cognitive dysfunction in later life. Given the wide range of MF exposed occupations, such exposure may be of etiologic importance.</page><page sequence="71">S72 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 163 IDENTIFYING CRITICAL WINDOWS OF EXPOSURE FOR CHIL? DREN'S HEALTH. SHERRY SELEVAN, KIMMEL CAROLE A, MENDOLA PAULINE. US EPA. EMail: selevan.sherry@epa.gov In a discussion of "highly susceptible period[s] of organogenesis," James Wilson (1965) described the importance of exposure timing within the developing organism, and how this ultimately affects the outcomes observed. Since then, other authors have considered the importance of critical periods in the devel? oping organism, but a systematic compilation had not yet been done. Efforts were undertaken to examine preconceptional, prenatal, and postnatal develop? mental exposures and subsequent outcomes, to examine information available on critical windows, and to evaluate implications for risk assessment for the following areas: 1) respiratory and immune systems, 2) reproductive system, 3) nervous system, 4) cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and general growth, and 5) cancer. Review papers were prepared in advance of a September 14-15, 1999, workshop on "Critical Windows of Exposure for Children's Health," convened with nearly sixty scientists from a variety of disciplines to discuss critical windows of exposure, identify major issues for future efforts, and deter? mine its use for public health. Some major themes were identified in the discussion: 1) Broad windows can be identified for many systems; however, information on the exact timing and sensitivity is limited, reinforcing the importance of detailed exposure assessment. 2) Similarities and differences in the reaction of humans and laboratory animals to agents with toxic potential were noted. The differences emphasized the need for cross-species comparisons ofthe dose to the target tissue, and for better data on the exposure-dose-outcome continuum. 3) The importance of increased interaction among the different scientific disciplines was identified. Laboratory animal data could lead epidemi- ologists/clinicians to areas of potential concern in humans, while epidemiologic data could identify areas for laboratory investigations on mechanisms and agent-target interactions. 4) Thus far, only limited attention has been given to a) exposures during the peri-pubertal/adolescent period, b) to adult conse? quences of developmental exposures and c) to genome-environment interac? tions. What will these data mean for public health, risk assessment and risk management? In hazard identification/dose-response assessment, data on devel? opmental windows will aid in 1) evaluation of the biological plausibility of research findings, 2) comparison of data across species, and 3) identification of the "most sensitive window" for the evaluation of dose-response relationships. In public health and risk management, information on critical windows may help identify especially susceptible subgroups for specific intervention. 166 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW: WATER CHLORINATION, CHLORINA?

We calculated pooled odds ratios using first Mantel-Haenzsel fixed effect model and then DerSimonian and Lairds method for random effect model when there was substantial heterogeneity of effects in the pooled studies. Results. We identified a total of 10 studies that provided estimates of the effect of exposure to chlorination by-products on one or several pregnancy outcomes. The pooled odds ratio indicated an increased risk for reduced intrauterine growth (1.15, 1.00-1.54), all birth defects (1.24 1.10-1.39), neural tube defects, urinary tract defects, spontaneous abortions and still birth. Suggestive evidence was provided for low birth weight 1.23 (95% CI 0.98, 1.54). The risk for preterm birth was reduced 0.94 (0.88-0.999). Conclusions. The weight of evidence is consistent the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to chlorinated water and chlorination by-products reduces fetal growth and increases the risk of spontaneous abortions, still birth and birth defects. Different approaches in exposure assessment provide hetero? geneity and increase uncertainty of the results. 164 FETAL GROWTH AND LENGTH OF GESTATION IN RELATION TO MOTHER'S EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE IN PREGNANCY IOUNI T.K. JAAKKOLA, JAAKKOLA N, ZAHLSEN K. The Nordic School of Public Health. EMail: jouni@nhv.se Objective. To assess the effects of prenatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke on fetal growth and length of gestation. Methods. The study population consisted of 389 non-smoking women, who were selected from a population-based study in South East Finland on the basis of questionnaire information after delivery (response rate 94%) to represent exposed and unexposed to passive smoking in pregnancy. The final exposure assessment was based on nicotine concentration of maternal hair sampled after the delivery, which measures exposure during the past two months i.e. the third trimester. The exposure categories were defined a priori as high (nicotine concentration &gt;4.00 mg/g; N = 52), medium (0.75-4.00 mg/g; N = 186), and low as the reference category (&lt;0.75 mg/g; N=151). Results. In logistic regression analysis, controlling for confounding the risk of preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks) was higher in the high (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=6.12; 95 per cent confidence interval [CI] = 1.31, 28.7), and medium exposure categories (adjusted OR=1.30; 95 per cent 0=0.30, 5.58) com? pared with the reference category, and there was 1.22 (95 per cent 0 = 1.07, 1.39) increase in adjusted odds ratio by a unit increase in exposure. The risks of low birthweight (OR=1.06; 95 per cent 0=0.96, 1.17 per mg/g nicotine) and small-for-gestational-age (1.04; 0.92, 1.19) were only weakly related to exposure. Conclusions. The present results based on objective assessment of exposure during a period most relevant for fetal growth provide further evidence of the adverse effects of tobacco smoke exposure. The results suggest that prenatal exposure may also increase the risk of preterm birth. 167 SERUM DIOXIN, P450 GENES, AND BIRTH DEFECTS AMONG OFFSPRING OF VIETNAM VETERANS ANNE SWEENEY, DEL JUNCO DEBORAH, ROBISON TRACY, GAR- ZON ANGELA, FOX ERIN, MOORE SUZANNE. University of Texas Houston School of Public Health. EMail: asweeney@utsph.sph.uth.tmc.edu Recent Institute of Medicine updates regarding the association of Agent Orange exposure and birth defects among offspring of Vietnam veterans indicate a critical need to reexamine this controversial question. The major limitations of previous studies were crude exposure assessment, selection bias, and small sample sizes. This is a nested case control study to test hypotheses regarding dioxin exposure, the CYP1A1 variant allele, and any interactions in producing preg? nancies affected with a neural tube defect (NTD) among offspring of Vietnam veterans. A registry of all known 2.7 million male and female Vietnam veterans was obtained from the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs as the sampling frame. To maximize the probability of identifying veteran parents, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), with the approval of State Vital Statistics offices, provided birth and death certificate numbers for NTD births and deaths in the U.S for the period 1962-1995. Parent identifiers are being abstracted from these certificates and cross-linked with the veteran registry for a list of "potential" matches (expected number = 10,000), using the MatchWare software program. An Inter-Agency agreement with NIOSH and the IRS has been established to provide current addresses for the veterans. A screening survey will determine eligibility based on both veteran and parental status. Cases are Vietnam veteran parents of an affected child; Vietnam veterans of healthy offspring will be eligible for inclusion as controls. An in-depth survey will be sent to eligible participants for complete military and reproductive histories. A subset of 150 cases and 150 controls will be selected from this sample for dioxin and genetic polymorphism assays. The fifty states were trichotomized according to proportion of Vietnam veterans in the population. A two year effort has resulted in IRB approval from 40 states (80%) overall: 10 of 10 in Tier 1; 16 of 17 in Tier 2; and 14 of 23 Tier 3 States; three states denied access to any records. To date, we have ascertained 59,351 NTD records: 29,906 deaths, 16,460 births, and 12,985 fetal deaths from 33 states. Using Texas as a pilot state, parental information from 5,714 birth, death, and fetal death records were crossed with the registry, yielding 1257 potential matches. Assuming successful contact with 60% of the veterans, nationally this will yield a sample of 856 cases. Screening surveys are currently being mailed and results from the screening data will be presented.</page><page sequence="72">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S73 168 OBSERVATIONAL ERROR ASSOCIATED WITH MEASURE? MENTS OF LONGITUDINAL LUNG FUNCTION DATA PUNAM PAHWA, SENTHILSELVAN A.. University of Saskatchewan. EMail: pahwa@sask.usask.ca The objective of this study was to fit random effects model (REM) to unequally spaced longitudinal lung function data to predict the longitudinal decline in lung function measures of grain elevator workers. The data used in this study were collected as part of the Labour Canada National Grain Dust Medical Surveillance Program every three years between 1978 (7300 subjects) and 1993 (3079 subjects). Repeated observations on a particular grain worker was collected anywhere during a 3-year period. Even though we had a basic interval of three-year period, time period between any two observations was not exactly three years, i.e. observations were not equally spaced as a multiple of some basic interval. Changes in lung function over time were assessed by fitting random effects models, assuming data were unequally spaced over time. In a REM, one possible parameterization of within subject covariance structure is a continuous-time/unequally-spaced autoregressive structure AR(1) with observational error. We fitted REM, considering age as a random effect factor. We used model concordance coefficient [r(c)J to assess the goodness of fit ofa model; variance-covariance concordance coefficient [r(w)] and pseudo-likelihood ratio test to measure the closeness and test the equality between unequally-spaced AR(1) and unequally-spaced AR(1) with observational error covariance structures re? spectively. Based on the values of pseudo-likelihood ratio test obtained from models for forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), unequally- spaced AR( 1) and unequally-spaced AR( 1) with observational error covari? ance structures were not significantly different, but this was not true for forced vital capacity (FVC). The values of pseudo-likelihood ratio test for the REM for FVC were comparatively higher than what we obtained for the REM for FEVl. The estimated observational error for FVC (=0.3870) was higher than the estimate of observational error for FEVl (=0.0822). These results indicate that observational error may be associated with the longitu? dinal mesurements of FVC. Goodness of fit for the model and covariance structure were similar to those obtained using traditional tests like Akaike's information criterion and likelihood ratio tests. Based on our data analysis, we conclude that REM models with unequally-spaced AR(1) covariance structure and REM models with continuous-time AR( 1) with observational error are most appropriate models for prediction of FEVl and FVC respec? tively. 170 ASSESSING THE HEALTH IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION IN LATIN AMERICA - CHANCES AND NEEDS REINHARD KAISER, ROMIEU I, KUNZLI NINO, MEDINA SYLVIA. National Institute for Public Health Surveillance,. EMail: r?kaiser@gmx.de Health impact assessment (HIA) is an important tool in decision making for air quality control and public health action aimed at air pollution risk reduction. In many urban areas in Latin America, health threats from air pollution are increasing due to growing populations and more traffic. We propose to establish surveillance in Latin American cities that allows peri? odic HIA for selected health outcomes. Early collaboration on a common methodology will help to make results comparable and to use them in neighboring countries where HIA is not yet feasible. The surveillance system could be started in major cities where HIA has already been conducted, or local data sources are available (e.g., Santiago de Chile, Mexico City, Sao Paulo). A similar international project has been started in 2000 in Europe based on member cities of the APHEA II study (Short-term Effects of Air Pollution on Health: a European Approach). Specific issues have to be considered regarding the 3 parts of HIA, including: 1)-Health outcomes: routine data collections such as hospital admissions may have to be established, extended or standardized; HIA may be limited to parts of the population, i.e. certain areas of the city, or sensitive groups. 2)-Exposure assessment: Standardized air pollution monitoring is required to derive the population exposure distribution, applicable both for epidemio? logic studies and for HIA. Air pollution indicators need to be clearly defined (e.g., fine particulates, ozone), and the same devices should be used for monitoring. 3)-Exposure-response function: Availability of specific exposure-response functions is a limitation for HIA in Latin America. The use of exposure- response functions observed in the United States and in Europe may be considered until more epidemiologic studies from Latin America are avail? able. In planning epidemiologic research, the future use for HIA should be considered a priori (air pollutants, health outcomes, methods). 169 A CASE-CROSSOVER STUDY BETWEEN AIR POLLUTION AND HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS BY ASTHMA ATTACK IUNE IM, LEE SANG-YOON, JU YOUNG-SOO, YOON KI-JUNG, KANG DAE-HEE, CHO SOO-HUN. Seoul National University. EMail: junel@snu.ac.kr It is well known that the air pollution can cause adverse health effects since the London Smog accidnt in early twsentieth century. since then, there have been neumerous studies about air pollution and adverse health effects. In case of asthma patients, It has been proven by many studies that many kinds of air pollutants can cause an asthmatic attack. But, still now there are controversies about causal relationship because the studies that have been done till now was ecological or time-series studies. Recently, the case- crossover design, newly developed in early 1990s was introduced in the fields of air pollution epidemiology. This study, using the case-crossover design, investigated the association between air pollution and astma attack. The daily total number of asthmatic patients visited 49 hospital emrgency rooms in Seoul, Korea was inestigated by reviewing emergency room records. Meanwhile, The medical records of asthma patients visited one of the 49 hospitals were reviewed. When the medical records were reiewed, patient's residentioal address, diagnosis, smoking history, respiratory infection history, asthma medication use history was investiated. The data were analyzed by conditional logistic regression used for matched data. Control periods were chosen by bidirectional paired matching method, 7, 14 days before and after case periods. In conclusion, the relative risk of asthma attack by lOOppm ozone increase between June and September were 1.348 (95% CI. 1.010- 1.619). Between November and February, the relative risk by 100?&lt;l/?? TSP increase, lOOppb sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were respectively 1.278 (1.010-1.619), 1.237 (1.019-1.502), 1.285 (1.006-1.640). In stratified analysis, the relative risk were increased when the asthma patients were chidren aged 15 years or below, when they had the respiratory infection history, and when they took asthma medications improperly. If the more correct exposure estimates considering individual behavior pattern or the proportion of indoor activity and the more information about covariates would be used, the more exacr study would be done. 171 BONE, BLOOD AND SEMEN LEAD IN ENVIRONMENTALLY EX?

EMail: pfarias@insp3. insp.mx Lead exposure is still common in many parts of the world and capable of producing adverse health effects, even at low levels. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine lead sources and its levels in blood, semen and bone in environmentally exposed men living in the Mexico City area. In a sample ranging from 161 to 181 men, aged 19-48, semen lead was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, blood lead by atomic absorption spectrometry and bone lead by K X-ray fluorescence. Mean blood, semen, tibia (cortical) and patella (trabecular) bone lead levels were: 12 micrograms/dl, 2.7 micrograms/l, 13 micrograms Pb/g, and 20 micrograms Pb/g, respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the predictors of each lead biomarker (blood and semen lead levels required a log e transformation). Significant predictors of blood lead included days per week of using lead glazed ceramics (beta=0.09, p(t)&lt;0.01), patella lead (beta=0.009, p(t)&lt;0.01) and smoking at work (beta=0.14, p(t)=0.05). Semen lead was significantly predicted by blood lead (beta=0.042, p(t)&lt;0.01) and larger than median patella lead (beta=0.42, p(t) =0.013). Predictors of higher tibia lead were age (beta=0.31, p(t) = .05), living near a lead using industry (beta=4.01), p(t)=0.04), and an ordinal index of occupational lead exposure (beta=0.015, p(t)&lt;0.01). Higher patella lead was predicted by age (beta=0.8, p(t)&lt;0.01), higher traffic density near home (beta= 3.5, p(t)&lt;0.09), the ordinal index of occupational exposure (beta=0.009, p(t)&lt;0.077) and a greater number of cigarettes smoked/day in the prior year (beta=0.36, p(t)=0.03). Adult males are vulnerable to lead effects but have not been thoroughly studied. Results on blood and bone lead determinants are consistent with findings in other populations, and results regarding semen provide useful information on the compartmental biody- namics of lead.</page><page sequence="73">S74 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 172 LUNG CANCER RISK IN OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO CHROMIUM DIDI SURCEL, COLDEA VICTORIA, FAT LIGIA, FANFARET MI- HAELA, MODORCEA V., COCARLA A., RAMBOIU STELA. Institute of Public Health, str. Pasteur nr. 6 Cluj 3400. EMail: didi.surcel@ipscj.ro Introduction: Occupational exposure to the chemical carcinogens has been associated with high cancer incidence. Epidemiological studies have dem? onstrated that hexavalent chromium -exposed workers have increased risk for respiratory tract carcinoma.Chemical carcinogens-induced lung cancer develops through a secvence of the cellular alterations that have a long time period of the reversible alterations . In the same time local induced -mod- ifications are associated with alterations of the immune functions. Objectives: The aim of this study was to disclosed a group with high risk for lung cancer , using cytological investigation of the sputum and leukocyte adherence inhibition assay . Methods: A group of the 240 workers in dichromate underwent clinical , biotoxycological, radiological, cytological and immunological investigations. A standard questionnaire including information on occupational exposure , respiratory history .smoking , drinking ,dietary habit was completed. Urinary chromium (CrU) was applied as the indicator of exposure .Cr-U level was assessed concomitantly with the measurement of Cr concentration in air specimens collected in work place . Results: The cytological investigation of the sputum disclosed pretumoral modifications of bronchial epithelium in 6 subjects in the chromium expo? sure group. All of them were with high duration of exposure. Leukocyte adherence inhibition test (LAI- test ) pointed out a higher susceptibility to lung cancer in 12 subjects, 9 from them were with pretumoral modifications of epithelium . Conclusion: Our results suggest that sputum cytology screening and LAI-test do constitute efficient means in detecting of the persons with high risk of the cancer in industrial facilities with hexavalent Cr. 176 SETTING BACTERIAL WATER QUALITY STANDARDS FOR SEA BATHING - A CRITICAL EVALUATION ED STUTT, MUGGLESTONE MA, RUSHTON L. MRC Institute for Environment and Health. EMail: eds3@le.ac.uk The World Health Organization (WHO) recently proposed draft guidelines for safe recreational water environments (WHO, 1998). This paper presents a critical evaluation of the WHO guidelines. The evaluation raises issues that should be addressed in future epidemiological studies, including those proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 1999). The WHO guide? lines rely heavily on a series of randomised controlled trials conducted in the UK between 1989 and 1992. We present a detailed assessment of the design, conduct and analysis of these trials, including comparisons with other studies carried out world-wide. We also examine a probabilistic risk assessment model used by the WHO to derive guideline standards from the results of the UK trials. The UK trials have advantages over most other studies with respect to water quality and exposure assessment, control over bathing activity, and collection of data on potential confounders. The results of the UK trials are consistent with those of most other studies in that increased incidence of adverse health outcomes is associated with decreasing water quality. The WHO guidelines focus on Kay et al.'s (1994) analysis of the UK trials linking gastroenteritis (the most commonly reported adverse health outcome in other studies) to faecal streptococci counts (an appropriate indicator organism) in terms of a dose- response model. Serious weaknesses in the dose-response model (namely bias, inadequate control for confounders and inappropriate statistical analysis) are expected to have lead to serious over-estimation of the risks of experiencing gastroenteritis. The WHO guideline standards inherit the weaknesses of Kay et al.'s (1994) dose-response model. Over-estimation of the risks of sea bathing in the UK trials may lead to unnecessarily stringent microbiological standards. The WHO risk assessment also fails to consider uncertainty and variability in estimates of risk and the sensitivity of the results to model assumptions. Many weaknesses in Kay et al.'s (1994) dose-response model could be eliminated by appropriate re- analysis, although some problems due to bias cannot be overcome. Major improvements in the WHO risk assessment and, therefore, the proposed guide? line standards could be obtained by combining a revised dose-response model based on the UK trial data with proper consideration of the effects of uncer? tainty, variability and sensitivity to model assumptions. Our critique highlights problems relating to the design, execution and interpretation of epidemiological studies of sea bathing which will inform future research.

Regional Institute of Hygiene, Ostrava, Czech Republic. EMail: hana.slachtova@khsova.cz In the city of Ostrava the GIS has been built since 1991 mostly for the purposes of the evidence of properties and the Central register of population in the Municipality of Ostrava. Objectives: The aim of the presented study was to spread the possibilities of GIS also for the analysis of the health data. Methods: The municipal GIS /GISMO/ uses the ARC/INFO software on the basis of working stations. At present time the GISMO contains a huge amount of data based on the maps of the evidence of properties in the proportion 1:1000, and also the data ofthe whole population ofthe city from the Central register. Health data on allergies in the population aged 5, 9 and 13, were collected in 1998 in the framework of the national monitoring system by 3 paediatricians in the 3 city areas. The case-control study analysed the information from the questionnaires. The study sample in each of the areas was placed in the square of 1 km in the map. Results: The data on allergies were adjusted for sex, age, the family history and indoor-factors (mould, animals, smoking, gas stove). The comparable data in each area were analysed using GIS on outdoor factors - source of air pollution, traffic density. The RR for each area was calculated and than again using GIS information to indicate the total population in the same age living in 3 squares - HIA. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the possibilities of using GISMO also for the purposes of the health studies. 177 A META-SMOOTHING APPROACH TO ANALYZE THE DOSE- RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARTICULATE MAT? TER AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. 1 SCHWARTZ, ZANOBETTI A. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: jschwrtz@hsph.harvard.edu Many studies have assessed the association between hospital admissions and air pollution. There is an unanswered public health interest in whether a threshold exists, and more generally in the shape of the dose-response relationship. Nonparametric smoothing is a standard method to control for confounders as it lets the data determine the shape and therefore allows for non-linear relationships. We have applied this to same method to estimate the dose-response slope between PMIO and hospital admissions for heart and lung disease in 10 U.S. cities, by fitting nonparametric smooth functions in each city controlling for season, weather and week days. We then combined the smoothed dose-response curves across cities using a meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting allowing for random effects. Our results indicate that the relationship between PMIO and hospital admission is almost linear and there is no indication of a threshold. Rather, we found evidence for a steeper slope for PMIO concentrations less that 20 mg/m3.The curve indi? cates that an increase from 20 mg/m3 to 30 mg/m3 of PMIO, is associated with about a 1.1% increase in CVD, a 2 % increase in pneumonia and a 2.1% increase in COPD. All three associations were statistically significant. These results are consistent with the results of the meta-analysis applied to the linear estimate of PM10.</page><page sequence="74">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S75 178 AIRBORNE PARTICLES AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR HEART AND LUNG DISEASE IN 14 US CITIES I SCHWARTZ, ZANOBETTI A, DOCKERY DW. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: jschwrtz@hsph.harvard.edu We examined the association between PMIO and hospital admissions for heart and lung disease in 14 US locations with daily PMIO monitoring. A generalized additive Poisson regression, adjusting for season, weather vari? ables and week days, was fit in each city using an unconstrained distributed lag model, and constrained (lag 0, mean lags 0-1 and quadratic distributed lag) models. We then combined the city-specific results using inverse vari? ance weighted averages. Using the unconstrained model, we found a 2.5% (95% CI: 1.7,3.2) increase in COPD, a 1.9% (95% CI: 1.5,2.3) increase in pneumonia and a 1.2% (95% CI: 1,1.4) in CVD admissions for each 10 mg/m3 increase in PMIO. Similar effects were estimated for the two-day mean and the quadratic distributed lag. All three were always higher than the one-day lag, which appears to significantly understimate effects. Restrict- ing to days with PMIO less than 50 mg/m3, the effect size increased by 20% or more. For all three outcomes the results were stable controlling for confounding by S02, 03 and CO. We found consistent associations be? tween PM10 and hospital admissions; the effect is spread over several days and persists at extremely low concentrations. These results are consistent with previous epidemiology and recent mechanistic studies in animals and humans. 180 IS THERE HARVESTING IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PMIO, MORTALITY, AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS? I SCHWARTZ. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: jschwrtz@hsph.harvard.edu While many studies have shown that airborne particles are associated with increased daily deaths and hospitalizations, some have questioned whether these events are occurring in persons who would die or enter the hospital within a few days in any case. I have developed a framework for examining this hypothesis which uses a smoothing technique to net out any such rebound effects. I used it to examine the association of air pollution with daily deaths and daily hospital admissions in Chicago for the years 1988- 1993. I looked at effects net of rebounds on successively larger timeframes, ranging from 15 to 60 days. Daily deaths were divided into those that occurred within hospitals and those outside of hospitals. Deaths outside of hospitals are primarily cardiovascular sudden deaths. Hospital admissions for heart disease, COPD, and pneumonia were analyzed separately. PM10 was associated with all outcomes. For deaths within hospitals the effect size was smaller (0.77% increase per 10 mg/m3 (95% CI 0.42%-1.13%) than for deaths outside of hospitals (1.23% (0.80-1.65%). The effect size estimates for deaths in hospitals and for cardiovascular (1.27%, (0.93%?1.61%) and pneumonia (2.0%, (1.33%,2.68%)) hospital admissions did not change using the harvesting resistant method on any timescale. For deaths outside of hospital and COPD admissions (1.45%, (0.27%, 3.21%)), the effect size estimate doubled at the longer timescales. Hence the effects of PM10 on deaths and hospital admissions are not simply events brought forward by a few weeks or months. 179 RACE, GENDER AND SOCIAL STATUS AS MODIFIERS OF THE EFFECTS OF PM10 ON MORTALITY I SCHWARTZ, ZANOBETTI A. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: jschwrtz@hsph.harvard.edu Interest has recently been focused on which populations are most at risk of air pollution induced premature mortality. This coincides with greater con? cern about environmental justice. We analyzed total mortality in the four biggest US cities (Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Minneapolis-St. Paul) with daily measurements of PM10 for the years 1986-1993 and combined the results (using inverse variance weighting) to determine whether race, sex, or education, are potential modifiers of the effects of PM10 on mortality. We computed daily counts of deaths stratified by sex, race and education in each city and investigated their associations with PM10 in strata specific Poisson regression models that controlled for season, weather and day of the week effects. We found evidence of effect modification by sex with an increase in female deaths of 1.1% (95% CL: 0.85%,1.31%) compared to 0.74% (95% CI.: 0.53%,0.96%) for males for a 10 mg/m3 increase in PM10, while for social factors and race we found only weak evidence of effect modification. In general the effect modification appeared modest compared to other reports of substantial effect modification by medical conditions. 182 ARE THERE SENSITIVE SUBGROUPS FOR THE EFFECTS OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES? I SCHWARTZ, ZANOBETTI A, GOLD D. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: jschwrtz@hsph.harvard.edu Little is known about which subpopulations are most sensitive to the effects of PM10. We analyzed MEDICARE data for hospital admissions for heart and lung disease in Chicago for the years 1985-1994. We looked to see whether pre-exiting disease, defined by a previous admission for that disease, or its listing as a comorbidity on the index admission, was an effect modifier for the effects of PM10 on hospital admissions for heart and lung disease. We found that the PM10 associated increase in CVD admissions was roughly doubled if the subject also had a respiratory infection. Persons with acute respiratory illness (ICD 9 460-466) had a 2.7% increase in admissions (95% CI 0.2-5.3%) per 10 mg/m3 of PM10, versus a 1.1% (0.8-1.4%) increase in persons without any respiratory complications. Similar results were seen for pneumonia. COPD was a more modest risk modifier (1.6% increase (0.9- 2.3%)). Persons with conduction disorders (2.9% (0.2-5.6%)) or arrhyth? mias (1.6% (0.8-2.5%)) were at greater risk of subsequent CVD admissions. Any pre-existing cardiovascular disease, but especially congestive heart failure, was a strong effect modifier for admissions for COPD. A 10 mg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 4-4% (1.4%, 7.4%) increase in COPD admissions in persons with CHF, but a 1.1% (0.05%, 2.24%) increase in COPD admissions in persons without CHF. Pneumonia admissions were also higher in persons with conduction disorders or disrhythmias. These results are consistent with recent mechanistic literature suggesting that lung inflammation, autonomic dysfunction, and heart failure are all modifiers of PM response.</page><page sequence="75">S76 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 183 DAILY DEATHS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMBUSTION PAR? TICLES RATHER THAN S02 IN PHILADELPHIA I SCHWARTZ. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: j schwrtz@hsph.harvard.edu I analyzed the association between TSP, S02, and daily deaths in Philadel? phia during the years 1974-1988 using a heirarchical modeling approach. Separate regressions were fit for the warm and cold season of each year for TSP and S02 separately. The 30 regression coefficients for TSP and S02 were then regressed on potential explanatory factors. Because TSP changed from a winter peaking to a summer peaking pollutant during this time in Philadelphia, there was substantial variation in the relationship between TSP and S02 during the 30 periods of study. In a metaregression, the TSP/S02 slope explained all of the effect of S02 on daily deaths. In contrast, it did not explain the TSP effect, and the TSP slope was higher in periods with a lower TSP/S02 correlation. Controlling for S02 in the metaregression increased the estimated TSP effect to a 21% increase per 100 ug/m3 of TSP (95% CI 10%,32%). However, all ofthe association between TSP and daily deaths was explained by the association between TSP and extinction coefficient, a marker for fine combustion particles in Philadel? phia. I conclude that fine combustion particles and not either TSP or S02 is the underlying cause of the associations previously reported. 185 CHEMICAL AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY POLLUTION AND BLADDER CANCER: A CANADIAN CASE-CONTROL STUDY ANNE-MARIE UGNAT, WEI LUO. Health Canada. EMail: anne- marie?ugnat@hc-sc.gc.ca Background: Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in Canadian males with a male-to-female ratio of 3:1. It is well documented that the etiology of bladder cancer involves environmental factors, such as occupa? tional exposure to certain chemicals and petrochemicals. However, the effect of industrial emission on the risk of bladder cancer for nearby residents is difficult to establish. Objectives: to examine the association between residential proximity to chemical and petrochemical industry pollution and the risk of bladder cancer among residents of Western Canada, controlling for occupational exposure and other potential confounding factors Study Design: population-based case-control study. Methods: All histologically confirmed bladder cancer incident cases, aged 24 to 74, between 1994 and 1997, in the four Western provinces of Canada were used. Controls were selected from a population control pool with an age and gender distribution similar to that of the case group. Results: The risks of bladder cancer were significantly elevated for the following chemical exposures: asbestos (1.5, 95%CI=1.1-2.0), lubricating oil (1.5 95%CI=1.2-1.9) and beniziding and benzene (OR=1.7, 95%CL= 1.1-2.7), dyestuffs (OR=1.9, 95%CL= 1.0-3.4), mustard gas (OR=3.2, 95%CL= 1.0-9.9), and welding (OR=1.3, 95%CL= 1.0-1.6). After adjusting for potential confounders (e.g. smoking status, age, educa? tion, etc), the following risks were obtained: asbestos (OR=1.6, 95%CL= 1.2-2.3), lubricating oil (OR=1.7, 95%CL= 1.3-2.3), beniziding and benzene (OR=2.0, 95%CL= 1.2-3.4), dyestuffs (OR=2.2, 95%CL=1.1-4.4). Conclusion: The impact of chemical and petrochemical industry emission is an important public health issue in Canada. Further study is needed to determine the lifetime exposure level of the study subjects using their long term residential history. 184 TRIAZINE HERBICIDE EXPOSURE AND OVARIAN CANCER INCIDENCE: A STUDY OF NORTH CAROLINA COUNTIES HEATHER YOUNG, GOLDSMITH DAVID. George Washington Uni? versity. EMail: bschay@gwumc.edu Objective: To further study the proposed link between ovarian cancer incidence and triazine herbicide exposure, an ecologic study of North Caro? lina counties was conducted. Background: In North Carolina in 1996, 1.2 million pounds of triazine herbicides were applied to corn cropland. Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer found among women in the US and the second most common gynecologic malignancy. Epithelial ovarian cancer may be initiated by the incessant ovulation process which results from altered hormonal stimulation. Triazine herbicides may play a role in altering hormonal stim- ulation. Donna et al. (1989) reported a statistically significant relative risk of 2.7 for ovarian cancer among women exposed to triazine herbicides. Methods: For each county, demographic data on racial composition, median family income, and level of education were retrieved from the 1990 Census. First birth rates for women over age 30 in 1990 were collected from the North Carolina Department of Vital Statistics. Data on groundwater contamination with triazines were abstracted from the North Carolina Study of the Impact of Pesticide Use on Groundwater (1990-95). Several surrogate measures of pesti? cide exposure were obtained for each county. Information on the acres of corn, soybeans, sorghum, and Christmas trees planted for 1970, 1980, and 1990 was compiled from the North Carolina Department of Agricultural Statistics. Atrazine is widely used in corn, soybean, and sorghum production; and simazine is widely used in Christmas tree farming so that these should serve as reasonable proxies of triazine use by county. Information on atrazine use by county was also available for 1990. North Carolina has maintained a statewide cancer registry since 1988. The expected number of cases were calculated by applying SEER age specific rates to the North Carolina population. Ovarian cancer incidence rates for each county were calculated from registry data for the period 1990-1995. Analysis: Counties were categorized by exposure status. Categorical expsure levels were defined for each variable. To create a summary index of trizaine exposure for each county, the numeric values for each of the exposure categories was summed. Predictor variables to be included in the model are percentage of black residents, percentage of women 25 years and older with at least a bache- lor's degree, median income, and delayed child bearing. Poisson regression analysis will be performed with each of the individual exposure variables and the summary index. Odds ratios will be calculated from the model. Pearon's corre? lation coefficient will be used to correlate incidence rates on a sex and race specific basis with atrazine usage by county. 186 AGE-RELATED EYE DISEASES, CAUSING BLINDNESS, SMOK? ING AND USAGE OF VEGETABLES IN LITHUANIAN ELDERLY RAMUTE VAICAITIENE, CERNIAUSKIENE L, LUKSIENE DALIA, PAUNKSNIS A, DOMARKIENE S. KAUNAS UNIVERSITY OF MED? ICINE. EMail: RAMUVAIC@TAKAS.LT Risk factors and pathogenetic mechanisms of development of the main diseases causing blindness and visual impairment ( cataract, glaucoma, macular degeneration) are almost general. Now more and more attention is given to the role of the oxidative stress and insufficient amount of the antioxidants during these disease formation. Smoking causes the excessive oxidative stress, and fruits and vegetables are the main dietary sources of antioxidants in our population. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of frequency of those pathologies with gender, age, smoking habits and the usage of fresh vegetables and fruits. The frequency of these eye diseases (cataract, glaucoma, increased risk of glaucoma, maculopathy ) was investigated in Kaunas elderly people cohort (355 males, 72,8+/- 4,1 years, and 214 females, 69,1+/- 3,3 years), using ophthalmological methods (slit lamp, direct ophthalmoscopy, Schiotz tonometry) and questionnaire for evaluating of smoking habits and frequency of food consumption . Preva? lence of cataract, glaucoma and increased risk of glaucoma was obtained significantly more frequent in female group than in males; maculopathy rate, on the contrary, was higher in male group (28,5% and 16,6%, p&lt;0,05). The rate of eye pathologies increased with age. Maculopathy and increased risk of glaucoma in male smokers were significantly higher than in non-smokers. After calculating the total average score (TAS) of fruits, juice and fresh vegetables consumption it was obtained 11,3 ?4,5 in males and 13?5,4 in females (p&lt;0,05). TAS of middle and heavy smokers was significantly lower than non-smokers and was negatively related with cataract, increased risk of glaucoma and maculopathy rates in male group and maculopathy rate in female group. Thus, low intake of antioxidants due to the low intake of fresh vegetables and fruits could be an important risk factor for the eye diseases, causing blindness in our elderly population, especially in smokers .</page><page sequence="76">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S77 187 PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO ORGANIC SOLVENTS AND RE? DUCED BIRTH WEIGHT EUN -HEE HA, CHO S, CHEN D, WANG L, LIU T, SMITH T, XU X, CHRISTIANI D. Harvard school of public health, boston, MA. EMail: eunheeha@hohp.harvard.edu Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of birth weight with maternal and paternal exposure to organic solvents. Methods: 1246 couples employed in a large petrochemical corporation in Beijing, China, were enrolled when the women visited a hospital to deliver a baby during 1994-1998. Maternal and paternal exposures to organic solvents were assessed by a trained interviewer based on a structured questionnaire. Detailed information on potential confounders was also collected for both parents. Regression analyses were performed to examine the association between birth weight and parental exposure to solvents. Gestational age was adjusted for using loess smoothing to account for a nonlinear relationship. Infant sex, mother's pre-pregnancy BMI and height, mother's age, mother's shift work, father's height, and father's education were adjusted in the final model. Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, maternal exposure to solvents was significantly associated with reduced birth weight (-85 grams; 95% CI, -164 to -5), whereas paternal exposure did not show a significant association. Among specific solvents, maternal exposure to benzene was most notable in the effect (-89 grams, 95% CI, -174 to -4). Taller stature of both mother and father, mother's pre-pregnancy BMI, and father's education were significant predictors for birth weight, whereas father's BMI and mother's education were not. Conclusions: Maternal exposure to organic solvents is associated with reduced birth weight in this population. Paternal exposure to solvents did not show such an association. 189 A CASE-COHORT ANALYSIS OF RESIDENTIAL PESTICIDE EX? POSURE &amp; FETAL DEATH ERIN BELL, HERTZ-PICCIOTTO IRVA, BEAUMONT J. Department of Epidemiology, University of North. EMail: erinbell@unc.edu Epidemiologic studies of agricultural pesticides and reproductive outcomes have been inconclusive. A case-cohort analysis of fetal death (cases = 445, controls = 608) and residential proximity to agricultural pesticides was conducted in ten agricultural counties of California. A statewide database of all applications of restricted pesticides was linked to maternal address to determine daily exposure status for all study subjects. Individual pesticides were grouped by chemical class (phosphates, pyrethroids, carbamates, halo- genated hydrocarbons and endocrine disruptors) and by mechanism of ace- tylcholinesterase inhibition (direct, indirect and carbamatic inhibitors). Multivariate proportional hazards models, using time-dependent exposure variables and adjusting for maternal age and county of residence, were analyzed for each of the pesticide classes. An increased association with fetal death due to perinatal causes (ICD9 code 764.9-779.9) was observed for those exposed to direct acetylcholinesterase inhibitors during their first or second trimesters of pregnancy, with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 1.7(95% confidence interval 0.9,3.1). Exposure to carbamatic inhibitors during the first trimester showed an increased risk for fetal death due to perinatal and all causes of fetal death not due to congenital anomalies with HRs of 1.6(1.1,2.3) and 1.3(1.0,1.7), respectively. In contrast, no association was seen with exposure to indirect acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Residential proximity to commercial application of the five chemical classes examined was not associated with an elevated risk of fetal death, regardless of timing of exposure. Major strengths of this study include the objective measures of exposure, and our ability to look at exposure for relevant biological time periods, and specific pesticide groupings. 188 AIR POLLUTION ON LOW BIRTH WEIGHT IN SEOUL EUN-HEEHA, HONG Y, LEE B, WOO B, SCHWARTZ J, CHRISTIANI D. Harvard school of public health, Boston, MA. EMail: eunheeha@hohp.harvard.edu We analyzed the effects of air pollution exposures during the first-trimester of pregnancy on low birth weight among all live births registered by the Korean National Birth Register for a 1-year period (January 1997 to Decem? ber 1997) in Seoul(n= 142,634). Based on the gestational age and birth date of each newborn, we estimated first-trimester exposure by averaging the corresponding daily ambient air pollution concentrations registered at 20 stations where five pollutants were monitored in 1996-1997. Maternal exposures to sulfur dioxide(S02), total suspended particulates(TSP), carbon monoxide(CO), ozone(03) and nitrogen dioxide(N02) in first trimester of pregnancy were estimated as arithmetic means. Concentrations of these pollutants were measured hourly, and 24-hr averages were constructed be? tween measurement sites. For ozone, a daytime 8-hr average was used instead of a 24-hr average. The effects of ambient air pollution on low birth weight were evaluated with logistic regression analyses. Crude prevalence of low birth weight(&lt;2,500g) is 4.6%(6,588) in this popultion. We defined high exposure as more than the 75 th percentile of each pollutant's concentration: those were 14.7 ppb for S02; 87.9 ug/m3 for TS?; 1.45 ppm for CO; 21.5 ppb for 03; and 38.0 ppb for N02, respectively. In the univariate analysis, odds raios(ORs) of low birth weight were 1.14[95% confidence interval(CI), 1.08-1.21] for N02, 1.13 (CI, 1.07-1.19) for CO, 1.13(CI, 1.07-1.19) for S02 and 1.08(CI, 1.02-1.14) for TSP. However, the OR of low birth weight was not significant for ozone. After controlling factors such as gestational age, maternal age, education, infant sex, and season, ORs of low birth weight were :1.06(CI, 0.85-1.31) for TSP, 1.04 (CI 0.96-1.13) for S02, 1.06(CI, 0.99-1.15) for CO, and 1.08(CI, 1.01-1.17) for N02. Conclusion: The relationship of air pollution with pregnancy outcome is a highly controversial issue. This result supports a relationship between low birth weight and air pollution. Especially N02 concentration in first trimes? ter was a significant risk factor of low birth weight. Even though we provide the support for the hypothesis that air pollution can affect the low birth weight, the association between air pollution and birth weight requires further study. 190 MORTALITY DISPLACEMENT IN MILAN, ITALY. A ZANOBETTI, WAND MATT, SCHWARTZ J, RYAN LUISE. Harvard school of Public Health. EMail: azanob@sparc6a.harvard.edu While time series analyses have demonstrated that particles are associated with early death, they have not clarified how much the deaths are advanced. In this work we estimated the effect of air pollution on daily deaths net of any short term rebound due to mortality displacement, and any longer lagged effect. Our approach was to directly fit the rebound effect of negative correlation between exposure and outcome due to the depletion of the risk pool. We did this using a distributed lag model (DLM) to study the distri? bution of the effect over time. To allow for flexibility we propose to use penalized spline smoothing to estimate the DLM. We combined generalized additive models and DLM, correcting for season, weather, holidays, influenza and weekdays. We found that the effect of TSP on mortality was positive at short lags, dipped to zero at about 15days and then became positive again with a long tail lasting until 45 days. Summing the overall effect at a single day's exposure over the subsequent 45 days, we found a 6.7% (CI. 95%: 3.8-9.6) increase in daily deaths was associated with an interquartile range increase in TSP. This is more than double the result obtained in an analysis looking at the effect of exposure on the concurrent day. These are consistent with the results of Zeger and Schwartz and could suggest that previous time-series analyses have underestimated the true relationship between mortality and air pollution.</page><page sequence="77">S78 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 191 DAILY MORTALITY AND AIR POLLUTION BY GENDER AND MARITAL STATUS - ELDERLY, TURIN, ITALY ENNIO CADUM, ROSSI GIUSEPPE, MARCHI GIANLUCA, COSTA GIUSEPPE, VIGOTTI MARIA ANGELA. A.R.P.A., Grugliasco, Torino Italy. EMail: rossigi@ifc.pi.cnr.it The modifier effect of socio-demographic factors on the effect of air pollu? tion on daily total mortality has not been yet investigated, although highest levels of mortality and morbidity have been seen in widowed and never married men. An association between air pollutants and mortality graded by socio-demographic indicators may help to single-out groups of population more susceptible to air pollution. The aim of this work was to examine the short-term effect of air pollution on mortality in different marital status (M=married, NMW= never married and windowed) and gender groups of population by using time series analysis of epidemiological data. To explore such differences we used Turin 1991-96 mortality data linked to 1991 census records (Longitudinal Cohort Study). We examined the relationship be? tween TSP, S02, N02 and CO and all causes mortality in elderly (* 65 years) people by gender and marital status. Poisson regression adjusting for trend, season, weather variables, week day and holidays was performed. All pollutants were nearly always significantly associated with mortality in all groups of marital status and gender. The % increase for TSP, S02, N02 (for 50 ug/m3) and CO (for 2 mg/m3) was respectively 3.7 (1.6-6.4), 10.6 (4.1-17.5), 7.9 (3.8-12.1) and 4.2 (2.6-5.9) in M males; 13.2 (8.3-18.3), 16.6 (5.6-28.8), 14.1 (7.0-21.7) and 4.1(1.4-6.9) in NMW males; 6.4 (2.1-10.9), 5.6 (-0.05-17.1), 3.5 (-0.03-10.2) and 3.1 (0.4-5.9) in M females; 4.7 (2.3-7.1), 7.2 (1.5-13.1), 4.4 (0.9-8.1) and 2.7 (1.3-4.2) in NMW females, TSP, S02 and N02 showed a very strong effect on mortality of the NMW males group compared to the other groups. In females the effect of these pollutants is not so different between the two marital status groups. The CO effect on mortality was instead very similar in the four groups. Our results suggest that NMW men are more susceptible to effects on mortality of air pollution. 195 ASSOCIATION OF WEATHER VARIABLES WITH HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR SELECTED DISEASES IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONS, 1983-1998 KRISTIE EBI. KELSH M, CHER D, EXUZIDES K, LAU E. EPRI. EMail: krisebi@epri.com Climate variability and change may affect the rates of diseases associated with weather variables. To better evaluate the potential health implications of climate variability and change, it is first necessary to understand the basic associations between weather and disease. Analyses to date tended to focus on seasonal patterns without taking into account actual weather conditions or recurring patterns such as El Nino and La Nina. We evaluated the associations between weather variables and hospitalizations for selected diseases in two major geographic areas in California, LA/Orange county and San Francisco/San Mateo county. Weather data included precipitation, sea surface temperature along the California coast, daily temperature minimum, and the difference between the daily temperature minimum and maximum. Weather data were averaged over four days. Analyses were stratified on values of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), an indicator of El Nino and La Nina conditions. Hospital admission data were provided by California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development for the years 1983? 1998. Each record in the database describes patient demographics, date of admission, diagnoses, procedures and the ZIP code of the patient. We used Poisson regression models to analyze associations between weather and hospital admissions. The statistical models included a linear time factor to account for trends in hospital admissions over the 16 year period. We applied generalized estimating equations to adjust for autocorrelation and overdis- persion and evaluated the associations between weather and hospitalizations with lag periods of 0, 7, 14 and 30 days. Disease outcomes included enceph- alitis, acute myocardial infarction, asthma or COPD, viral pneumonia and injuries. The associations between the weather variables and hospital ad? missions were highly dependent on age and gender, and on the lag period and the disease outcome examined. For both California regions, temperature and precipitation variables were associated with most outcomes. It is not known if the weather patterns observed during El Nino and La Nina events are predictive of future average weather. However, each is a possible weather scenario that may provide useful insights into the potential health implica? tions of climate change. 193 MODELING PESTICIDE EXPOSURE IN THREE CALIFORNLAN COUNTIES BASED ON HISTORICAL PESTICIDE USE REPORT? ING AND PROXY INFORMATION BEATE RITZ, RULL R, QUACH T, KRISHNADASAN A. UCLA, School of Public Health. EMail: Britz@UCLA.edu Objectives. We developed a geographic information system based model of historical pesticide exposure of residents living in three Central Californian counties. This model will allow us to use residential and occupational location history obtained in epidemiologic studies to estimate pesticide exposure likelihood of study subjects over periods of time. Methods. The model is based on two sets of data; (1) pesticide use data provided by the California Pesticide Use Report (PUR) system for the period 1972 to the present, and (2) crop/land-use maps, aerial photographs, farm advisor reports, and farmers4 manuals during the 1950-60s. Our model assumes that an individual's likelihood for being exposed to a pesticide is inversely related to the distance from the location of application and the intensity of an application. Intensity of application is derived from the pounds of active ingredient applied, acreage treated, application method, as well as other local features such as wind speed and direction influencing drift. Results. After calculating pesticide application intensity and deriving the likelihood of exposure using inverse-distance-weighting, we will map pesti? cide specific information onto a density surface. Pesticide exposure estimates for the earlier period are being derived from proxies for pesticide application such as crop/land-use maps and aerial photographs to determine crop pat? terns, and farm advisor reports and farmers' manuals to ascertain information about pests and recommended pesticide use during this period. We will present comparisons of exposure estimates based on secondary sources of data with actual use report data. Conclusions. We are presenting a GIS-based pesticide exposure model that incorporates historical data on land and pesticide use for epidemiologic studies of long-term health effects. 196 COMPARATIVE RISK FROM DBPS AND PATHOGENS IN DRINKING WATER FROM AN INDUSTRIALIZED RUSSIAN CITY ANDREY EGOROV, FORD TIMOTHY, ALTSHUL LARISA, RAKITIN PAVEL, FOURMAN VLADISLAV, KISLITSIN VICTOR, DRIZHD NINA, TERESCHENKO ANDREY, PETROVA LUBOV. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: aegorov@hsph.harvard.edu We have investigated population exposure to DBPs and waterborne patho? gens in the city of Cherepovets, Russia. A health questionnaire was admin? istered to 750 households and an extensive one month-long water quality monitoring program established. This cross-sectional survey was foilowed by a six month-long longitudinal survey with 100 families. The study intro- duced new water quality and health monitoring methods to Russian special- ists, including EPA method 1623 for Cryptosporidium and Giardia and EPA method 552.2 for haloacetic acids. Water samples were shipped to the US and Finland for mutagenicity tests and detection of various disinfection by-products including 3-chloro-4(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-fura- none (mutagen X). Air samples were taken in bathrooms with showers turned on to assess exposures to VOC through inhalation. Serum samples collected from 100 people twice with a 6-month interval were analysed for the presence of anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies to assess population expo? sure. Although longitudinal data are still being analysed, preliminary results have revealed associations between self-reported gastro-intestinai diseases and consumption of non-boiled tap water and between GI diseases and chlorine demand at a water treatment plant. Analysis of cross-sectional study data also revealed an association between levels of residual chlorine in different areas of the city and rates of GI diseases. However, spatial differ? ences in the level of residual chlorine were greatly reduced during imple? mentation of our project by practical measures undertaken by local author? ities. Results of the study were used for risk assessment. Although concentrations of some DBPs exceeded US standards, our study demon? strated that microbiological pollution of drinking water remained a priority problem in the city. Recommendations on modifications to monitoring methods and water quality improvement strategies were developed. A water quality and GI health survey in another Russian city has now been initiated.</page><page sequence="78">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S79 197 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO PES?

EMail: mlevario@mailcity.com Objective: Determine placenta alterations on women exposed to pesticides inhibitors of cholinesterase. Patients, Material and Methods Design: Transversal, exposed group (n = 100) patients residing in an agricultural area of Chihuahua, Mexico. Non-exposed (n = 200) from an urban area. Exposure to pesticides inhibitors of cholinesterase was measured by place of residence and levels of Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity; macroscopic placenta alterations, weight, diameter and surface alterations were evaluated. An integral microscopic study was performed in 68 patients. Results: Levels of AChE activity were lower in patients from the agricultural area p&lt;0.01. Placental Infracts were predominant in the exposed group, (Odds Ratio) OR adjusted by hemoglobin 3.51 IC 95% 2.14 - 5.87, for macroscopic observations. Microscopically, an OR of 2.88 p = 0.04 was determined. Differences in weight and placenta diameters were not observed. Conclusion: A large proportion of placenta injuries in patients of an agri? cultural area suggests that, exposure to pesticides could contribute to their development. 199 SWEDISH-BALTIC INTERDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL NET? WORK FOR HEALTH PROMOTION BY MEANS OF INDIVIDUAL AGENDA 21 IUOZAS DUDZEVICIUS, HEYDEN.GUY, EDBLAD,THORSTEN. Kau? nas University of Medicine, Kaunas, Lithuania. EMail: EKOS@KMA.LT Currently the Baltic countries are facing serious ecological problems. Envi? ronmental degradation negatively affect human population health status. There is a general need of the local and wider community in the countries for increased knowledge of the complex interplay between man and his environment in a rapidly changing world. The main aim of the interdisci- plinary educational network is to develop standardized methods, which may mobilize local communities and individuals to take on increasing self- responsibility for their health and neighbouring environment (individual Agenda 21 approach). The problem oriented educational model based on long-term experiences has been developed. Different disciplines were enrolled to obtain a holistic view of local living circumstances. Photographic monitoring of environment and human health changes is utilized in the model. The annual follow-ups include monitoring of environmental parameters (from the solar radiation to the ground water) and personal parameters (from social into oral health). In total, more than 500 parameters per person are collected annually by interviews concerning personal social, psychological, nutritional, general medical, oral medical, and ecological conditions, supplemented by simple health investigations. Human quality of life is evaluated by means of a psychological index, as a supplement to a biomedical index, based on the prevalence of human illnesses and diseases. In addition with focus on intra-individual comparisons every person has his colour pictures of the oral tissues. The close-up photography, using special camera and a blue-sensitive film (Agfachrome 200 RSX Professional), was used for visualization. A sample of 180 adults (aged 23-92 years), living in an isolated region, participated in project. Personal print-outs from the health database and regular demonstration of oral and plant changes by photographs increase the motivation of participants to change their some habits and protect the neighbouring environment. The photographs were valuable material for object-lessons at health-promoting discussions with the participating resi? dents. As a result of Swedish experience similar models are being developed in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 198 AIR POLLUTION AND DAILY MORTALITY IN SEVEN MAJOR CITIES OF KOREA IONG-TAE LEE, HO KIM, YUN-CHUL HONG, HO-JANG KWON. Dept. of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine,. EMail: jlee@yumc.yonsei.ac.kr The relationship between ambient air pollution and daily mortality for the period 1991-1997 was examined in seven major cities of Korea. These cities cover a half of Korean population (about 22 millions). The observed con? centrations of sulfur dioxide (S02, mean=23.3 ppb), ozone (03, mean=23.7 ppb), and total suspended particulates (TSP, mean=77.9 ug/ m3) during the study period were at levels below Korea's current ambient air quality standards. Generalized additive models (GAM) was applied to allow for highly flexible fitting of seasonality and long-term time trends in air pollution as well as nonlinear associations with weather variables such as air temperature and relative humidity. In city-specific analyses, an increase of 50 ppb of S02 corresponded to 1-12% more deaths given a constant level of weather conditions. The risk of all-cause mortality was estimated to increase by 0.5-4% with an increase in 2-day moving average of TSP levels equal to 100 ug/m3. In multi-pollutants models with pooled data, we found that the estimated risk of deaths by S02 was notably unaffected by adding other two pollutants (TSP and 03) to the model and statistically significant in various regression models. The rate ratio for S02 remained elevated, indicating excess mortality of 3 percent per 50 ppb (RR= 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05). TSP effect on mortality kept its significance with 03, not with S02. This implies that there could be collinearity problems where TSP and S02 are included in the same model, or TSP may work less than S02 as a surrogate for fine particles in ambient air of Korea. In conclusion, increased mortality was associated with air pollution at S02 levels below the current recommenda- tion for air quality. Further research need to clarify the relationship between S02 and fine particles in Korea. 200 DDT-INDUCED DNA DAMAGE IN WOMEN AND IN HUMAN CELLS LETICIA YANEZ, BORJA-ABURTO VICTOR, ROJAS E, GONZALEZ- AMARO R, DE LA FUENTE H, DlAZ-BARRIGA F. Universidad Au- tonoma de San Luis P otosi. EMail: fdia@prodigy.net.mx DDT has been used in Mexico for the control of Malaria since 1956. The insecticide is being sprayed in the dwellings; thus, high exposure to DDT can be expected in people living in them. One of the effects that have been found in workers heavily exposed to DDT is DNA damage. Therefore, in the present work we studied DDT exposure and DNA damage in indigenous women that were living in malarious areas in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. DNA damage was assessed by the single-cell gel electrophoresis technique ("comet assay"). The following results were obtained: DDT and its metabolites blood concentrations were higher in the exposed group when compared to a control population (indigenous women not living in the malarious area). DDT and DDD mean blood levels were three times higher in the exposed group, whereas DDE were four times higher. After adjusting for cofounders, the tail lengths of "comets" were larger in the exposed women and they correlated with blood concentrations of DDT, DDD and DDE (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the number of "comets" were also higher in the exposed women when compared to the control population, and the number corre? lated with DDT, DDD (p=0.002) and DDE (p=0.02). In order to confirm the effect of DDT and its metabolites on DNA damage, human blood cells were exposed in vitro to three dosis of DDT, DDD and DDE. DNA damage was assessed by two different techniques: single cell electrophoresis and flow cytometry. Results obtained by either technique showed that DNA damage was induced by the three organochlorides and a clear dose-response was observed with DDT. Our data suggest a DDT-induced DNA fragmentation, and this outcome was also observed with DDE and DDD. More studies are needed in order to identify the health effect associated with this biological marker.</page><page sequence="79">S80 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 201 RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY TO PAHS AND BREAST CANCER RISK IENNIFER NORTON, VENA J, MOYSICH K, ROGERSON PETER. MA Dept of Public Health. EMail: jennifer.norton@state.ma.us Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common incident cancer among women in the United States. Geographic variation of breast cancer rates suggests an environmental etiology. Rates of breast cancer are higher in urban areas. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are suspect breast carcinogens based on evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies. Concen? trations of PAHs are also higher in urban areas. Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between residential proximity to sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and breast cancer risk. Methods: Utilizing data from a population based case-control study, ad- dresses of 535 cases and 596 controls who have resided at the same address for at least ten years were address matched to a geographic data file in a geographic information system (GIS). The locations of sources of PAHs were also address matched in a GIS. Sources of PAH emissions analyzed in this study include: coke oven plants, carbon production plants, facilities with a coal combustion boiler, oil refineries and hospital incinerators. Two methods were used to derive a total PAH exposure measure, which was calculated using a weighted sum of residential proximity to the source, years at residence, type of source and number of sources. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with adjustments made for potential confounding of reproductive factors, smoking and diet. Results: Preliminary results indicate elevated odds ratios among women with a high exposure to PAHs, however these findings are not statistically significant (method 1: adjOR=1.33; 95%CI=0.85,2.08; method 2: OR=1.30; 95%CI=0.82,2.04). When stratified by menopausal status, ele? vated odds ratios remained for post-menopausal women only (method 1; adjOR=1.44; 95%O=0.83, 2.51; method2: adjOR=1.58 ; 95%O=0.91, 2.74). There was no evidence of effect modification from smoking or diet. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest a small increased risk of post-menopausal breast cancer among women who had the highest environ? mental exposure to PAHs, however the risk estimates were imprecise with the confidence intervals including one. This is one of the first analytic epidemiological studies to examine the relationship between residential proximity to sources of PAHs and breast cancer risk. In addition, this study illustrates the usefulness of a GIS in environmental epidemiologic research. 203 BINATIONAL PROGRAM FOR LEAD EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT AND PREVENTION IN TIJUANA, MEXICO DEAN BAKER, ERICSON J, ELLERBECK M, YANG H, SOTO J. Uni? versity of California, Irvine. EMail: dbaker@uci.edu The University of California, Irvine, collaborated with the Secretaria de Salud, Mexico, and Servicios Medicos Municipales, City of Tijuana, to conduct an epidemiological survey of lead exposure among children, ages 1.5-6 years old, in the City of Tijuana, Mexico. We selected a representative sample of children using preschools and clinics throughout the region. Teams of local health professionals conducted the survey by administering a questionnaire to a guard- ian and obtaining 2-10 mL of blood using standard venipuncture. The speci- mens were analyzed at the Public Health Laboratory, County of San Diego, during the first year and at the Blood Lead Laboratory at the General Hospital, Tijuana, during the balance of the three-year program. Both laboratories were proficiency certified for the blood lead analysis. A total of 1719 children participated in the survey and provided valid blood specimens. The mean age was 4.0 +/- 1.5 years. The mean blood lead level (BLL) was 6.2 +/- 3.4 /ug/dL We found that 10% had BLLs from 10 to 20, while 1% had BLLs &gt; 20 /otg/dL. The children who had BLLs &gt;= 10 /Ltg/dL were referred to our case manage? ment team for diagnostic testing and interventions, including educational coun- seling; exchange of "lead-free" ceramics; calcium and iron supplementation; and home environmental sample collection including outside soil, household dust, lead-check of ceramics, and lead-check of interior painted surfaces. A multivar? iate statistical analysis was conducted to identify demographic, home, child behavior, and family occupational factors that may be predictive of child BLL. The strongest factors associated with elevated BLL were lower social class and family use of ceramic pots for cooking food. There was a weaker, suggestive association with pets going in and out of the home and a protective effect of spending time away from the home in day care. We conducted an age and social class-matched nested case-control study to include a home visit for evaluation of lead exposure sources. After adjusting for family use of ceramic pots, the most significant predictor of BLL was home soil lead concentration. As part of the project, we developed a public health infrastructure for childhood lead poisoning prevention by developing the case management teams and protocols; establish- ing a certified blood lead analytical laboratory in Tijuana; training over 400 physicians, nurses, educators, and others in prevention and treatment of lead poisoning; and broadcasting lead prevention information on local TV and radio. This binational collaboration to build a public health infrastructure was highly successful. 202 BLOOD AND BONE LEAD LEVELS AND THE PROSPECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE IN MIDDLE AGED TO ELDERLY MEN: THE NORMATIVE AGING STUDY. VIII POTULA, SCHWARTZ J, SPARROW D, WEISS S, HU H. aollogin. EMail: vpotula@hohp.harvard.edu Coronary heart disease represents the leading cause of morbidity and mor? tality in the United States. Lead exposure has been linked to hypertension and coronary heart disease and remains a pervasive, albeit mostly low-level problem in the United States. We examined the association between coro? nary heart disease and biological markers of lead exposure (blood lead, patella lead and tibia lead) in a prospective cohort study of middle-aged to elderly men. We studied participants of the Normative Aging Study who were free of physician diagnosed coronary heart disease at a baseline visit defined as the time of first bone lead measurement (1991). The follow-up period lasted until the time of first diagnosis of coronary heart disease, death from coronary heart disease, censoring last VA visit, whichever came first. Blood lead levels were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS) and tibia and patella bone lead levels measured by K-Xray Fluorescence (KXRF) instrument. We ran multivariate logistic re? gression models and a Cox proportional hazard model predicting coronary heart disease that adjusted for possible confounders, including age, body mass index (BMI) (weight/height squared), race (white, black), alcohol intake (gm/day), current smoking status (smoker, nonsmoker), currently diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (yes/no), diastolic blood pressure, and total serum cholesterol. After controlling for these factors, blood lead levels, current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and age were associated with increases in the odds for coronary heart disease. No such relation was observed using patella lead or tibia lead. We conclude that circulating blood lead may be a major active contributor to the risk of coronary heart disease in these middle aged to elderly men. 205 BREAST ADIPOSE TISSUE CONCENTRATIONS OF ORGANO? CHLORINES AND BREAST CANCER RISK BY TUMOR CHAR- ACTERISTICS CG. WOOLCOTT, ARONSON K.J., HANNA W.M., SENGUPTA S.K., MCCREADY D.R., STERNS E.E., MILLER A.B.. Community Health and Epidemiology, Queens. EMail: cw9@post.queensu.ca Previous studies on the relationship between breast cancer risk and organo? chlorines have been inconsistent. We evaluated the association between organochlorines and breast cancer by tumor characteristics that may define distinct etiologies to possibly identify an explanation for these inconsisten- cies. From 1995-7, women undergoing an excision biopsy for suspected breast cancer in Kingston and Toronto completed a questionnaire. Fourteen polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 10 pesticides were deter? mined in adipose tissue taken during the biopsy of 217 cases with breast cancer and 213 controls without breast cancer frequency-matched by age. Breast cancer type was determined for the cases and was defined by the tumor characteristics: estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, tumor size, and grade. Adjusting for age, geometric means differed by ER status and tumor grade for several PCBs and pesticides (P&lt;0.05), by tumor size for few organochlorines, and by PR status for none of the organochlorines. Using polytomous logistic regression to control for confounding, associations between organochlorines and breast cancer were not significantly different by type. However, the associations of PCBs and p,p'-l,l-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE) were higher with risk of ER- breast cancer than ER4- breast cancer. The odds ratio (OR) for ER- breast cancer in the highest tertile, compared with the lowest, was elevated for DDE (OR=2.36, 95% confidence interval= 1.04-5.37). PCBs tended to be more strongly positively associated with risk of larger tumors and higher grade tumors. A few of the organochlorinated pesticides were weakly and inversely associated with ER4- breast cancer and low or medium grade breast cancer. The association between organochlorines and breast cancer risk did not significantly differ by breast cancer type, but many PCBs tended to be more strongly associated with more aggressive tumors.</page><page sequence="80">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S81 208 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARDS IN THE PANAMA CA? NAL ZONE DEBORAH DEL IUNCO, SWEENEY ANNE, PITTS KATHLEEN, GARDNER TRACIE. University of Texas-Houston School of Public Health. EMail: ddeljunco@sph.uth.tmc.edu Members of the Panama Canal Society of Florida, Inc, a non-profit orga? nization of 4,000 former residents of the Panama Canal Zone with current residences throughout the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and 10 foreign countries, including the Republic of Panama, expressed concerns about the frequency of cancer and other chronic disease among member families. At the Society's annual meeting June 30-July 4,1999, we conducted a focus group and distributed a structured, self-administered postal survey. The survey inquired about health and employment histories and any expo? sure to environmental or occupational hazards. By September 1st, we had received 86 completed surveys. The mean duration of Canal Zone residency was 25 years and 64% of respondents were male. Most of the respondents (81%) checked "good to excellent" for their current health status, however, 44% wrote detailed descriptions of daily exposure to DDT. A total of 16% reported a history of cancer (other than skin cancer), 8% diabetes and 15% thyroid disease. To distribute the survey to the entire membership, the Society mailed the survey in its December 1999 quarterly publication, the Canal Record. Just before the large-scale mailing, internationally circulated news articles reported that the U.S. military had secretly tested Agent Orange and other toxic chemicals in the Panama Canal Zone during the 1960s and 70s. Because our survey included a question on whether the respondent had heard or read reports of environmental hazards in the Canal Zone, we will present a comparison of response patterns before and after the Agent Orange articles appeared in the press. So far, we have received over 320 completed surveys. The preliminary survey data will enable us to examine potential sources of bias and pursue larger, more in-depth studies with valid exposure and health risk assessment strategies. Over 90% of respondents have been willing to participate in future studies, authorize review of their medical records, and provide a blood sample to test for persistent environmental toxins and genetic susceptibility. According to the 1970 U.S. Census (the most recent statistics available for the Canal Zone), the population was 44,198. 210 INDOOR EXPOSURE TO VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) AT HOME AND ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IN CHILDREN PETER POEML, WEILAND SK, SEIFERT B, ULLRICH D, VON MU- TIUS E, KEIL U. University of Muenster. EMail: poeml@uni-muenster.de In a modern indoor environment, volatile organic compounds (VOC) are emitted from a variety of sources including wall and floor coverings, furni- ture, and cleaning agents. A recent Swedish study suggested an association between indoor levels of VOC (total (TVOC), alkanes, and terpenes) and asthma symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate VOC concen? trations in the homes of children in relation to asthma-related health endpoints in Germany. Subjects: Following a large prevalence survey carried out according to the ISAAC Phase II protocol in Munich (n=3354), Germany, a case control study was performed on a random subsample of 9-11 years old children with (n=86) and without (n=94) parental reports of wheeze during the last 12 months. Methods: In each home concentrations of alkanes, aromates, terpenes and halogenated compounds were sampled for one week with OVM 3500 samplers (3M) and measured by gas chromatography. Results: Among the cases, levels of TVOC (geom. mean: 170.3 vs. 150.2 /u,g/m3), alkanes (23.3 vs. 20.1 /u,g/m3), aromates (52.9 vs. 49.2 /ig/m3), benzene (4.0 vs. 3.4 /wg/m3), terpenes (23.6 vs. 18.0 /ig/m3), and limonene (12.3 vs. 9.3 /Ltg/m3) tended to be higher than among controls. Using t-tests after log transformation the differences reached borderline statistical significance (p&lt;0,10) only for terpenes, limonene and benzene. After adjustment for age, sex, socioeconomic status and parental history of asthma, a comparison of the upper and lower quartiles gave the following odds ratios: TVOC 2.65 (95% CI: 0.94; 7.51), alkanes 3.21 (1.16; 8.85), aromates 2.76 (0.96; 7.89), benzene 1.64 (0.62; 4.32), terpenes 1.75 (0.65; 4.72), and limonene 5.83 (1.76; 19.25). Conclusion: These data provide further evidence in support of the hypothesis that indoor exposure to VOC may be associated with asthma symptoms in children. 209 DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF NON-HODGKIN LYM? PHOMA IN SARDINIA, ITALY: 1974-1993 PIERLUIGI COCCO, BROCCIA GIORGIO, CASULA PAOLO . Uni? versity of Cagliari. EMail: coccop@pacs.unica.it Objectives. The reasons for the worldwide increasing trend of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are not clearly understood. We investigated whether an increasing time trend had been occurring also in the Italian region of Sardinia in 1974-93. Besides, we mapped NHL risk by commune over the whole region. Methods. We calculated the standardized incidence rate (SIR) of NHL by year, for the total population and by gender, among the Sardinian population (about 1.8 million at the 1991 Census) in 1974-93, with the 1981 Census regional population as the standard, and the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval in each commune (N = 361). The time trend of NHL incidence was also evaluated separately by gender, age categories, and for nodal and extra-nodal forms of NHL. Results. NHL incidence in the Sardinian population over the whole period of study was 7.5xlO-5/year (men: 8.2; women: 6.7), and it increased from 4.1x10- 5/year in 1974 to 9.1 in 1993. The increasing trend was consistent by gender, and it mostly affected subjects aged 55 years or older. Nodal and extra-nodal forms of NHL shared the same pattern of increasing incidence, although the annual increasing rate was higher for extranodal NHL. Excluding the few NHL cases related to AIDS did not change the results. The NHL incidence rate varied across communes within the range 0.0 - 60.0x100000/year (age 3 25). Areas at risk were located mainly in the northern part of the region for women and for the total population. Risk among men was somewhat more distributed over the regional territory, with a significant increase mainly in urban areas. Conclusions. Our study shows that NHL incidence increased in Sardinia in 1974-93 consistently with what reported world-wide. Risk is high in a few areas in the northern part of the region. Analytical studies are under way to inquiry into a broad range of risk factors, including viral, occupational, and environmental risk factors, that might account for our results. 211 EFFECTS OF LOW-LEVEL HEAVY METAL AND ORGANOCHLO- RINE EXPOSURES ON HEMATOLOGIC INDICATORS IN CHIL? DREN SUIYING HUANG, KARMAUS W, OSIUS NADIA, KRUSE H, WIT- TEN JUTTA. Michigan State University. EMail: huangsul@pilot.msu.edu As part of an epidemiologic study on exposure to a toxic waste incinera- tion(TWI) plant, we investigated whether heavy metals and organochlorine concentrations in blood, urine or hair had any effect on red blood cell function and morphology. Blood samples were collected and analyzed from 350 children, aged 7-10 years. About 40% of them resided in the vicinity of TWI. Heavy metals included lead in blood and in hair, arsenic in hair and in urine, cadmium in urine and in blood, chromium in urine, mercury in urine and in blood. Organochlorines are polychlorinated biphenyl in blood, hexachlorobenzene in blood, DDE in blood, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane in blood. For hematologic indicators, we used red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Het), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), reticulocyte count, ferritin concen? tration, and red blood cell distribution width (RDW). All heavy metals were categorized into three or four groups and analyzed as predictors of different hematological indicators in separate multiple linear regression models ad? justed for other potential confounders (age, gender, passive smoking, and fever in the last seven days). We found that lead in blood increases RBC, Hgb and Het. However, lead in hair was found only to be associated with an increase in RDW. DDE was found to decrease RBC, Hgb and HCT, in girls. DDE also decreases RDW and MCH. We also observed that, in girls, chromium can decrease Hgb, HCT, MCH, MCV, whereas RBC and reticulocyte counts were increased. Mercury in blood was associated with decreases in RBC, Hgb, HCT, in girls. Mercury in urine was found to decrease Hgb, RDW, and reticulocyte count. In conclusion, this investigation of a wide range of xenobiotics shows that morphology and function of red blood cells in children might be affected by some xenobiotics, e.g. lead, DDE, mercury. Girls were found to be more sensitive than boys, suggesting a possible role of gender.</page><page sequence="81">S82 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 212 DDT EXPOSURE AND HEALTH EFFECTS IN A COMMUNITY NEAR A FORMER DDT MANUFACTURING FACILITY DEAN BAKER, YANG H, FEDORUK M. University of California, Irvine. EMail: dbaker@uci.edu The Montrose hazardous waste site in Los Angeles County, California, is where a former facility manufactured and processed DDT from 1947 through 1982. Analyses conducted by the US EPA have demonstrated that off-site soils were contaminated with DDT. For two decades, nearby residents have complained of health problems such as headaches, nose bleeds, and skin rashes. In response to these concerns, we operated a medical evaluation clinic from 1995 to 1998, seeing 596 residents. A questionnaire was used to determine residential, environmental, and occupational history, and activities such as gardening that may have been associated with neighborhood DDT exposure. Each participant received a medical examination. We obtained blood spec- imens from 559 persons, which were analyzed for serum DDT concentration by the US CDC analytical laboratory. About 30% of participants had lived in the neighborhood for more than 10 years, while 19% had lived there less than two years. More than 47% were children less than 18 years of age. Among adults, 4% had prior occupational exposure to DDT, 46% had lived in Mexico or Latin America for more than one year, 35% spent time doing gardening in the neighborhood, and 20% had eaten eggs from chicken raised in the neighborhood. A total of 67 (12%) persons had total serum DDT greater than 20 ng/mL. Guidelines provided by California Department of Health Services indicated that the neighborhood total serum DDT distribution was slightly higher than in the US general population. We examined risk factors for total serum DDT concentration using various multivariate models. Among adults, age, occupational exposure to DDT, and prior residence in Mexico or Latin America were significantly associated with total serum DDT. No variable related to community residence or activities was consistently associated with total serum DDT, although there was a weak association with neighborhood egg consumption. No variable was associated with total serum DDT among the children. We also examined associations between total serum DDT concentration and health outcomes using both categorical and continuous analytical models. There were few apparent associations between serum DDT and health conditions. A weak association was observed between total serum DDT and breast-related conditions among adult females. However, this finding was not robust in various analytical models. Overall, there were no health conditions consistently associated with total serum DDT concentration among the participants. 214 GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE GSTM1 GENOTYPES AND THE RISK OF GASTRIC CANCER IN A CHINESE POPULATION. LIN CAI. YU SHUN-ZHANG, ZHANG ZUO-FENG. ucla. EMail: zfzhang@ucla.edu Objective The polymorphic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the detoxification of active metabolites of many potential carcinogens and appear to play a critical role in the protection from the effects of carcinogens. The contribution of GSTM1 genotypes to susceptibility to the risk of gastric cancer and its interaction with cigarette smoking are still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was any relationship between GSTM1 genotype and gastric cancer. Methods A population based case- control study has been carried out to explore the relationship of GSTM1 genotypes with susceptibility to gastric cancer development. We studied GSTM1 gene polymorphisms in 95 incidence gastric cancer cases and 94 healthy controls using peripheral blood DNA. Logistic regression model was employed in the data analysis. Results An increase in risk for gastric cancer was found among carriers of GSTM1 null genotype. The adjusted odds ratio was 2.63 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.17-5.88), after controlling for age, gender, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and fish source intake. Compared with those subjects who never smoked and had normal GSTM1 genotype, ORs were 1.60 (95%CI: 0.62-4.59) for never smokers with GSTM1 null type, 2.33 (95%CI: 0.88-6.28) for smokers with normal GSTM1, and 8.06 (95%CI: 2.83-23.67) for smokers with GSTMlnull type. Conclusion The results suggest that GSTM1 gene polymorphisms may be associated with genetic susceptibility of stomach cancer in Chinese popula? tion and may modulate tobacco-related carcinogenesis of gastric cancer. 213 CYTOCHROME P450 2E1 GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS AND THE RISK OF GASTRIC CANCER IN A CHINESE POPULATION LIN CAI, YU SHUN-ZHANG, ZHANG ZUO-FENG. ucla. EMail: zfzhang@ucla.edu Genetic polymorphism in enzymes involved in environmental carcinogen metabolism has been found to influence susceptibility to cancer. The pur? pose of this study was to determine whether cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) polymophisms were associated with gastric cancer risk. Subjects were comprised of 91 gastric cancer patients and 94 healthy controls. All subjects completed a standardized questionnaire including demographic data, diet intake, and information about alcohol and tobacco consumption. PCR-RFLP revealed three CYP2E1 genotypes, namely, heterozygote (CI/ C2) and two homozygotes (Cl/Cl and C2/C2). The frequency of variant genotypes (C1/C2 and C2/C2) in gastric cancer cases and controls was 36.26% and 24-47%, respectively. The rare homozygous C2/C2 genotype was found in 6 patients with gastric cancer (6.59%), whereas the controls only showed one (1.06%). However, the difference was not statistically (Fisher's exact test: P=0.069). Gastric cancer patients were more likely to carry genotype C1/C2 (odds ratios =1.50) and C2/C2 (odds ratios =7.34) than controls. Trend test (P=0.032). The frequencies of genotypes with the C2 allele (C1/C2 and C2/C2) were compared with those of genotypes without C2 (Cl/Cl) among gastric cancer patients and controls according to the pattern of smoking, alcohol drinking, fish sauce intake, salted fish intake and vegetables intake. The subjects which have been exposed to these risk factors of gastric cancer and carried the C2 allele seemed to have a higher risk of developing gastric cancer. The results suggest that polymorphic CYP2E1 gene may play some role in development of gastric cancer in a Chinese population. 215 EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDY OF HEALTH EFFECTS IN CHILDREN EXPOSED TO VHF AND UHF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS. VICTORIA DATSENKO, KARACHEV I. Ukrainian Scientific Centre of Hygiene (Kiev, Ukraine). EMail: maxd@myflat.com The urban RF radiation environment is dominated by radio and television transmissions. This has led to scientific and public concern about the potential health effects from living near FM radio and television transmis? sion devices. We evaluated the radiation-hygienic situation and children's health recorded in the administrative industrial centers of Ukraine (Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk). Since our previous studies showed an excess of morbidity risk among adult population within 1.3 km from the transmitters and a significant decline of risk with distance increasing we conducted a cohort study. In these cities in proximity to telecenters in residential areas there were children's preschool foundations and schools (632 children in exposed group and 694 - in unexposed one). We studied the distribution of EMF levels on the territory and inside the buildings located near high-power radio and TV transmitters and health of residentially exposed and unexposed children's populations (exposure was defined as a distance from the trans- mitting antennas (&lt; = 1,5km; &gt; 1,5km). The children's health status was evaluated using a special procedure. According to this procedure, the com? plex estimation of health state was reached by usage 4 criterions: first - presence or absence of chronic disease at the moment of survey; second - a functional condition level of the main human organism systems; third - level of the resisting power to infection disease; fourth - physical development level and degree of its harmonicity. Results: The health condition of children living under exposure of VHF and UHF electromagnetic fields with the electric field strength up to 5 V/m (absorbed power density is 0,028-0,034 Wxh/m2 for children of preschool foundations and 0,017-0,07 Wxh/m2 for schoolchildren) differs by deteri? oration of exponents in comparison with health of children in unexposed group: growth of chronic diseases by 18,2 % in exposed group; decrease of quantity of healthy children in 2,5 times (1-st group of health); 1,4 times exceed of functional disturbances; decrease of the health index in 2,8 times. Results reveal significant excess risk of disharmonic physical development by taking from a weight decrease (RR=2.3, 95% CI: 0.217,0.313). The expres- siveness degree of variations in children's health is determined by duration of residing near high-power radio and television transmitters and levels of EMF on the habitation territories.</page><page sequence="82">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S83 216 HAIR NICOTINE FOR ETS EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT AMONG BAR AND RESTAURANT WORKERS IN NEW ZEALAND WAEL AL-DELAIMY, FRASER TRISH, WOODWARD ALISTAIR. Wellington School of Medicine. EMail: delaimy@yahoo.com Workers in bar, restaurant and other food-serving venues are thought to be exposed to high levels of ETS compared to other occupational groups. The aim of this study was to assess the level of exposure among those workers in relation to the smoke free environment policy of their work place using an objective and accurate biomarker. A total of 114 staff working in different food and liquor catering services in Wellington and Auckland cities were interviewed for information about ETS exposure and smoking habits, and smoke policy details in their work place. A hair sample was collected from each subject to be analysed as a biomarker of the amount of ETS exposure. There was significant differences in the levels of ETS exposure among non-smoking staff, measured by hair nicotine levels, according to the type of smoke free policy of their work (P&lt;0.001). Those working in 100% smoke free venues had low levels of exposure compared to those working in non-smoke free venues, while those working in places where 50% smoke free policy was implemented were in the middle. These findings were consistent after adjusting for other sources of ETS exposure. Non-smokers working in places where smoking was not restricted had no significant difference of hair nicotine levels from that of smoking workers (p=0.86). The smoke free environment act does not protect hospitality workers, and they are therefore exposed to high levels of tobacco smoke from smoking customers. Action is needed to protect the health of this occupational group from the dangerous health affects of tobacco smoke. 218 PREDICTION OF THE INCIDENCE OF HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER WITH RENAL SYNDROME IN LOW-LYING AREAS OF CHINA: COMPARISON OF STATISTICAL MODELS SHILU TONG, WENBIAO HU, PENG BL QUT. EMail: s.tong@qut.edu.au Objective: It remains unclear how to best model the relationship between "high" frequency rates and their determinants. Using three different statis? tical models, we compared the relationships between several key climatic (eg, seasonal rainfall) and occupational (eg, crop production) variables and the occurrence of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in low-lying regions of Anhui Province, China. Methods: The data (1983-1995) on incidence of HFRS, density of mice (Apodemus agraritus), difference in the water level of the Huai River between July and September, and crop production were obtained from the Anti-epidemic Station and Bureau of Meteorology in Yingshang County, Anhui Province, China. These data were used to construct multivariate regression models with SAS and SPSS statistical software. Results: Model 1 is a logarithmic-transformed, linear regression model; model 2 is an intrinsically exponential, nonlinear regression model; and model 3 is a Poisson regression model. The results from all three models show that the independent variables measured (ie, water level of the Huai River, autumn crop production and density of Apodemus agrarius) can explain most of the variation in the incidence of disease. However, the sum of squared residuals (SSE) is remarkably smaller in the Poisson regression model (R2=0.98, SSE=173.0) than in the other two models (Model 1: R2=0.97, SSE=252.9; Model 2: R2=0.97, SSE=361.1). Residual analyses reveal that Model 1 may be less reliable than the other two models. Additionally, the relative importance of the predictors varies across models. Conclusions: The results indicate that the Poisson regression model may provide the best assessment of the relationship between the incidence of HFRS and predictive variables. 217 CHRONIC PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AND INCREASED RISK OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES LUDMILA KOVTiUH, PAVONE E. Former Moldavian Department of Ecological and. EMail: kludmila@idirect.com Epidemiological and clinical studies were conducted in 10 state farms of two administrative districts of Moldova (southeastern part of Europe) to assess possible health impact of pesticide and evaluate confounding risk factors. 1000 ethnically and genetically closed adult agricultural workers (AW) who occupationally contacted with pesticide were interviewed in person about previous and current diseases and life style (including demographics, work history and farming experience) with the following clinical examination. This paper reports information only about gastrointestinal disease (GD) incidence rate and possible associations of morbidity with sex, smoking and duration of work with pesticide. AW showed approximately 10 times higher incidence rate (31,73 % versus 3.10 %; 95 % CI) of GD (gastritis and duodenitis; gastric and duodenal ulcer) compared to those in total population residing in these districts. Analysis of gender distribution among AW revealed that males consistently had 1.5-3 times higher gastric and duodenal ulcer compared to females. At the same time, gastritis and duodenitis were seen 1.2-1.5 times more often among women. Strong association between increased risk of gastric and duodenal ulcer and smoking has been established. To avoid interaction with other confounding factors we analyzed data on 122 men-tractor drivers with approximately the same drinking habits and duration of occupation. Among 59 non-smokers tractor-drivers there was not a single case of gastric or duodenal ulcer. At the same time, 8 from 63 tractor drivers with smoking habits (12.7 %) had gastric and (or) duodenal ulcer in medical history. The observed level of GD incidence rate was higher among AW from districts with more intensive pesticide application and duration of occupation. Study data showed that high GD incidence rate in examined AW associated with pesticide use. Such factors as sex, smoking and duration of occupation can modify these results. 219 GLOBAL LEAD EXPOSURE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSES SHILU TONG, VON SCHIRNDING Y, PRAPAMONTOL T. QUT. EMail: s.tong@qut.edu.au Lead is most abundant of the natural heavy metals in the Earth's crust. It is a ubiquitous and versatile metal which has been used by mankind for over 6,000 years. The use of lead since prehistoric times, and its widespread distribution and mobilisation in the environment, has resulted in increased exposure to, and uptake of, this non-essential element by humans. Due to successful public health campaigns, the entry of lead into the ambient environment in most developed countries has decreased in recent years, reflecting the reduced commercial usage of lead - particularly, lead in petrol. While problems of frank lead poisoning have thus receded in developed countries, chronic exposure to low levels of lead is still a public health issue, particularly in some minority groups and disadvantaged people. Moreover, both occupational and environmental exposures have remained a serious problem in many of developing and industrialising countries. This paper aims to review the current levels of lead exposure in developed and devel? oping countries, past actions taken, future policy responses and interventions needed.</page><page sequence="83">S84 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 220 INTRODUCING APPLIED EPIDEMIOLOGY: AN INTEGRATED CASE STUDY USING PROBLEM BASED TEACHING CONCEPTS: CADMIUM CONTAMINATED FOOD. IRENE KREIS, ORVAD ADAM, RUBERU DHAMIKA, STACE RAY. University of Wollongong. EMail: irene_kreis@uow.edu.au When teaching epidemiology to students in a Masters Program, a major difficulty is conveying the need for taking a strategic approach when faced with a problem. Tackling real-life public health issues is complex. There will generally be a number of avenues of investigation and investigators need to be wary of the short and long-term consequences of their actions. Also time and money need to be managed effectively. As one approach to the education of students about these issues, a computer- based multimedia package has been developed which simulates the investi? gation of a public health problem. This simulation is based on a large case study that concerned the health effects from low-level cadmium contami? nated food in kitchen gardens. The students are placed in the position of a local public health official and are required to solve the problem with the epidemiological tools of their choice (within limitations on time and bud- gets). The study is broken into 4 stages. After each one, students have to defend their choices and conclusions by writing a report for professionals and presenting at a simulated public meeting. The subject takes students 14 weeks to complete and is largely self-directed. This presentation will demonstrate for the first time the completed teaching tool. As well as the structured roleplay environment through which students obtain qualitative and quantitative data to assess health effects, it now also allows students to design an in-depth study and analyse the resulting data. Use of the teaching tool over the past two years has resulted in it being refined, but suggestions will also be sought from those attending on how it might be improved further. There will be an opportunity to play with the software. 222 ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL CHEMICAL HAZ? ARDS IN THE UNIVERSITIES HOW-RAN GUO, TSAI PERNG-JY, TSENG HSIU-CHU. National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. EMail: hrguo@mail.ncku.edu.tw In the universities, many hazardous chemicals may be used either for teach? ing or for research. In Taiwan, in addition to the regular employees, the government includes temporary and part-time research assistants in the coverage of occupational regulations. To assess the environmental and occupational exposures to hazardous chemicals, we reviewed the data col? lected by a nationwide survey. Among the 137 universities and colleges in Taiwan, 103 (75%) responded to the survey. The results showed that, among the 144 toxic substances regulated by the Department of Health, chloroform is the most widely found in the university laboratories. Although it can be found in 62 sites, only 52 provided the material safety data sheets to the employees. N-hexane, which could be found in 79 sites, was the most commonly found toxic substance under the regulation of the Occupational Safety and Health Law. But, only 69 sites provided the material safety data sheets to the employees. We concluded that potential environmental and occupational exposures to hazardous chemicals are quite prevalent in the universities and colleges in Taiwan. The results call for education of the employees and enforcement of the regulations in these work places. A nationwide survey on the employees and students has been initiated, and further follow-up of the exposed population is necessary. 221 AGE ADJUSTMENT IN ECOLOGICAL STUDIES: USING A STUDY ON ARSENIC INGESTION AND BLADDER CANCER AS AN EXAMPLE HOW-RAN GUO. National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. EMail: hrguo@mail.ncku.edu.tw Despite its limitations, ecological study design is widely applied in environ? mental epidemiology. In most cases, adjustment for age is necessary, but different approaches may lead to different conclusions. To compare three methods that can be applied to adjust age effects in ecological studies, a study on the associations between arsenic level in drinking water and incidence of bladder cancer in 243 townships in Taiwan during an ten-year period was used as an example. Three methods were applied to analyze the same data set. The first applied the direct standardization method to obtain standard? ized incidence rate and then used it as the dependent variable in the regression analysis. The second applied indirect standardization method to obtain standardized incidence ratio and then used it as the dependent variable in the regression analysis instead. The third used the proportions of residents in different age groups as a part of the independent variables in the multiple regression models. The results showed that different methods may lead to different conclusions, but only the third approach can obtain unbi? ased estimates of the risks. The third method can also generate estimates of the relative risk associated with each age group, but the other two are unable to evaluate the effects of age directly. 223 HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDE- MIOLGY IN REGION OSTRAVA -CZECH REPUBLIC - TEN YEARS EXPERIENCES REVIEW. 1AROSLAVVOLF, SLACHTOVA HANA, CIZKOVA HELENA.

EMail: jvolf@ova.comp.cz The presentation reviewed ten years experience with capacity building and the most important results in the environmental and health risk assessment (HRA) and environmental epidemiology (EE) at the regional level in Czech Republic. The first task for capacity building was the international project with US EPA SILESIA, we had got very important tools as GIS, air quality monitoring methods, and particularly international contacts. The main result from this project is very important decreasing of the air pollution. The quality of air in Ostrava city corresponds to standards now. A lot of legal and methodological document in HRA prepared by our experts educated during SILESIA project. Capacity in EE were built mainly in the project CESAR/ PHARE - The Central European Study on Air pollution and Respiratory health. The cooperation with another CEE countries and consortium led by RIVM and AUW, The Netherlands; LSHTM, UK. We became a leading team in project management in Czech Republic. The System of the Moni? toring Inhabitants* Health in the Ostrava-Karvina Region in Relation to the Environment is more less based on the experiences from the contacts and results acquired during international projects.</page><page sequence="84">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S85 225 ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND MYOCARDIAL INFARC?

EMail: regina?grazuleviciene@fc.vdu.lt The objective of this study was to estimate the association between exposure to environmental factors and risk of first myocardial infarction. We conducted a case-control study, which involved all 25-64 year men who were Kaunas city residents and fall ill with first myocardial infarction in 1997 and 1998. In a hospital-based study 314 myocardial infarction cases out of 404 (response rate 77.7%) and 1068 of population controls, matched for sex and age, were interviewed for their sociodemographic characteristics, smok? ing and occupational history. Five-year annual data on ambient concentra? tions of N02, TSP and formaldehyde, derived from 12 ecological monitoring posts, we used to characterise the residential district exposure. The role of environmental factors was analysed using multivariate logistic regression models that included 7 selected variables, which significantly increased crude odds ratios (OR). After adjustment for age, smoking, hypertonic disease, stress and sexual disorders, the OR associated with TSP effect was 1.12 (95% CI 0.80-1.57), odds ratio for N02 was 1.11 (95% CI 0.84-1.46) and for formaldehyde - 1.17 (95% CI 0.84-1.62). Occupational exposure to vibration, electromag? netic fields and chemical substances had stronger effect on myocardial infarction risk than outdoor air pollution. The study results indicated that urban air pollution might contribute to the increase of myocardial infarction risk in general population. 228 HEALTH STATUS OF WOMEN LIVING NEAR OIL FIELDS IN THE AMAZON BASIN OF ECUADOR MIGUEL SAN SEBASTIAN, ARMSTRONG BEN, STEPHENS CAR- OLYN. Instituto de epidemiologia y salud comunitaria "Manuel. EMail: m.sansebastian@lshtm.ac.uk Background. Since 1972, oil companies have extracted more than two billion barrels of crude oil from the Ecuadorian Amazon, and in the process have released billions of gallons of untreated wastes and oil directly into the environment. Objectives. To investigate the environmental conditions and health status of women living in rural communities surrounded by oil fields in the Amazon basin of Ecuador. Methods. The study was carried out in communities of peasants situated in the Orellana and Sucumbios province, both in the north-eastern part of Ecuador. Water samples of the local streams were analyzed for total petro? leum hydrocarbons (TPH). A cross-sectional survey was conducted among women of exposed and unexposed communities, exposure status being as? signed on the basis of geographical location respect to oil fields. Question? naire administered to the female head included socioeconomic details, their medical history in the past 12 months and the use of medical services. Nine communities in the contaminated area (368 participants) and fourteen in the comparison area (291 participants) were included in the study. The study was conducted between November 1998 to April 1999. Results. Some streams presented a hydrocarbon concentration of 144 and 288 times the limit permitted by the European Community regulation. Information from the questionnaire was available for 368 and 291 of the subjects respectively. There was an overall excess in most of the listed symptoms in the exposed group. Prevalence odds ratios in the last 12 months for itchy nose (POR: 2.15; 95%CI: 1.60-2,89) and sore throat (POR: 1.69; 95%CI: 1.04-2.75) were statistically significant in the exposed group. Headache (POR: 1.59; 95%CI: 0.91-2.75), red eyes (POR: 1.27; 95%CI: 0.97-1.67), ear pain (POR: 1.32; 95%CI: 0.95-1.82), diarrhea (POR: 1.54; 95%CI: 0.95-2.48) and gastritis (POR: 1.45; 95%CI: 0.93-2.26) were also more prevalent in the exposed communities. Smaller differences were found in thirteen other symptoms investigated and in the use of health care facilities. Conclusion. There was evidence of severe contamination of water sources by TPH. Women living iri contaminated communities reported higher rates of physical symptoms than women in control areas. Symptoms significantly associated with exposure after adjustment were those expected from known toxicological effects of oil. Limitations such as recall and reporting bias might affect the results. There is a need to address urgently environmental control and remediation of contamination by government and oil companies in Ecuador. 226 ANALYSIS OF PEDIATRIC BURNS IN THE PRAGUE BURNS CENTRE 1995-1998 ALEXANDER M. CELKO, BROZ LUDOMIR, DANOVA JANA, KRIZ BOHUMIR, GRIVNA MICHAL. Charles University , 3rd School of Med? icine, Prague, CZ. EMail: martin.celko@lf3.cuni.cz Childhood burn injuries impose enormous economic burdens on society and family. In our study detailed hospital records of primary burn admissions to the Prague Burfis centre were audited and recorded for years 1995-1998. Patients included to the study (=522) were aged 0-16. Information about patient age, and sex, severity of burn ( anatomic site, percent of total body surface area burned - TBSA), lenght and direct cost of hospitalization, cicumstances of the incident including date, day, hour and ignition sources were collected from the medical record where possible. The Epi-Info 6.04 program was used for the data entry and analysis. From 522 evaluated hospital records were 66,5% (=347) boys and 33,5% ( = 175) girls. (1%- 60% of TBSA mixed superficial and deep burns) Extent of burn TBSA under 10% had 39,6% (=207), extent 10%-30% 50,2% (=262) and above 30% 10,2% (=53) injuried children. Average age of hospitalized child patients was 4,3 years, median 2,0 years. Between first and second year of age were 30,1% of all admissions, between second and third year 19,2%. Nearly half of hospitalized burn injuries involved children younger than 3 years of age, which corresponds with increasing mobility of toddlers and small children and higher risk from spilled hot foods and drinks, hot tap water and hot surfaces as stoves and iron. The most frequent place of the accident is household with 79,9% and out door playing children unattended 16,8%. The most common scalding mechanisms were upsetting cups and larger receptacles of hot liquid from the table or stoves in the kitchen and accidental tap water exposure in the bathroom. Average duration of hospi? talization was 20,5 days, median 15 days. The direct medical cost of hospital inpatient care for burn was in average 2 300 US$ (69 000 CZ Crowns] for surviving patient and 27 130 US$ (814 000 CZ Crowns) for patient died from the burn injury (=3) The real issue has to be to develop effective means of preventing serious burns in children such are those arising from excesively hot tap water and notably unprotected pots on stoves and tables. 229 HYGIENIC ASPECTS OF OCCURRENCE AND SPREAD OF WATERBORNE AMEBIASIS IN TBILISI, GEORGIA NANULI NINASHVILI, MAIKLE KURKHULI, K.GELASHVILI, D.GAGUA. Public health department. EMail: nananinashvili@yahoo.com Increasing fecal contamination of surface water sources is public health's major concern worldwide (especially in developing countries) in terms of prevention of waterborne outbreaks of infectious and parasitic diseases. Solution of this problem depends not only on implementation of interna? tional recommendations but also on local natural-geographic, climatic and social-economic conditions, including introduction and establishment of national standards on water quality monitoring in accordance with epide? miological situation. Waterborne parasitic disease has appeared in Georgia as an urgent problem since 1998 when over 2000 cases of amebiasis including liver abscesses were registered in Tbilisi. They were revealed in all districts of the city. Investi? gation of the outbreak confirmed the preliminary hypothesis that drinking water was the source of outbreak and revealed serious shortcomings in the sanitary surveillance service of the country; namely, lack of regulatory documents on monitoring drinking water quality, no assessment of risk of spreading parasitic diseases for prognostic and preventive purposes. In addi? tion no contemporary methods were available to detect amebic cysts and determine contact time with disinfectants for inactivation. Although the outbreak was caused by contamination of Grmagele surface water source the quality of drinking water before and after distribution was within the "Drinking water standard - 82"; E.coli index and number of bacteria per 1 ml water did not exceed the norms (3 and 100 respectively). Residual chlorine mainly was 0.5 mg/1, turbidity ranged within 2.6-3.5 NTU. All these prompted to perform parzitological testing of drinking water. E.hystolitica cysts were found in 9 samples of untreated water and in 3 and 2 samples of treated water before distribution and after distribution respectively. Bacte- riological indicators of the same samples were within standard. In order to control the outbreak the following measures were carried out: turbidity was decreased to 2 NTU, level of residual chlorine raised to 0.7 mg/1, because of the resistance of cysts to disinfectants it was decided to determine contact time (CT - were C- residual chlorine in mg/1, T- time in minutes). Due to double chlorination and increased level of residual chlorine CT raised from 48.5 to 75. Thus elaboration ofthe national drinking water standard became necessary. Along with turbidity and bacteriological criteria it includes parazi- tological testing of surface and treated water. As for sanitary surveillance purposes barrier capacity of water treatment facilities, level of water con? tamination and CT measurement were proposed to be considered at an early stage of drinking water source selection.</page><page sequence="85">S86 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 230 REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OF WOMEN LIVING IN THE PROX? IMITY OF OIL FIELDS IN THE AMAZON BASIN OF ECUADOR MIGUEL SAN SEBASTIAN, ARMSTRONG BEN, STEPHENS CAR- OLYN. Instituto de epidemiologia y salud comunitaria "Manuel. EMail: m.sansebastian@lshtm.ac.uk Background. Since 1972, oil companies have extracted more than two billion barrels of crude oil from the Ecuadorian Amazon, and in the process have released billions of gallons of untreated wastes and oil directly into the environment. Objectives. To determine whether living surrounded by oil fields was asso? ciated with increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes in rural com? munities of the Amazon basin of Ecuador. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted comparing women living in communities close to oil fields (less than 5 km) and women living far away (more than 30 km) from oil fields. The study population was women aged 17 to 45 years resident for a period of at least 3 years in the study communities. Socioeconomic and reproductive histories were obtained from personal interviews. Reproductive information was collected on the number of preg? nancies to the time of interview, the outcome (live birth, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth) over the last 3 pregnancies, the date and gestational age at the end of each pregnancy and, whether liveborn children were still alive. Only pregnancies that ended before December 31, 1998 and occurred during the residence of the women in the communities were included. Information from the questionnaire was available for 365 participants in the exposed group and 283 in the non-exposed group. The study was conducted between November 1998 to April 1999. Results. The total number of pregnancies reported was 1,377. Of these pregnancies, 7.5% were spontaneous abortions and 1.8% ended as stillbirths. Pregnancies of women living in contaminated communities were more likely to end in a spontaneous abortion than those of women living in comparison communities (OR: 2.34; 95% CI: 1.48-3.71; p&lt;0.01). No association was found between stillbirth and exposed women (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.35-2.05; p=0.83). After adjustment for the potential confounders - age at interview, age at pregnancy, pregnancy order, year of pregnancy and level of education -, the estimated odds ratio was slightly higher than the crude value and that the association between spontaneous abortion and living in the proximity of oil fields remained significant (OR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.58-4.02; p&lt; 0.01). Conclusions. Women living in communities surrounded by oil fields re? ported a higher risk of spontaneous abortion than women living where no oil fields exist. Limitations such as recall and reporting bias are acknowledged. An environmental system to assess, control and assist in elimination of sources of pollution in the area is necessary. 232 RE-EVALUATION OF DAILY TEMPERATURE-MORTALITY RE? LATIONSHIP USING DETAILED INFORMATION YASUSHI HONDA. University of Tsukuba. EMail: honda? taiiku.tsukuba.ac.jp Previously we analyzed daily temperature-mortality relationship using pre- fectural data in Japan. The analysis provided some useful results: V-shaped relationship, i.e., mortality is the lowest at a certain temperature (optimum temperature) and it becomes higher as the temperature becomes either higher or lower; this V-shaped relationship is affected by the climate such that the prefectures in colder climate tend to have lower optimum temper? ature; mortality rate at an optimum temperature is almost constant across prefectures. In the previous studies we selected only one observatory station in the capital city as a representative of the prefecture (47 stations in total). The rationale of using only one station was that a capital city usually has the largest population size, and that some other stations are located in extreme places such as tops of mountains or small islands suited for weather predic? tion. However, prefectures are not always homogeneous in terms of temper? ature status. In the present study, we obtained temperature data collected by "Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition system" that has 1,313 mon? itoring points all over Japan. We then assigned the monitoring points to corresponding villages, towns, or cities (hereafter described as cities, for brevity). If a city had no monitoring point, the closest point was used, and if a city had two or more monitoring points, we used the average temperature of these points. In Japan, merging of cities is common but departing from a city is rare. Hence we used the latest list of cities for the assignment. By using 1,313 points instead of 47, the extent of temperature misclassification should be considerably reduced. We will present the results of re-evaluation using the detailed temperature information, and the extent of the effect of temperature misclassification due to using only one observatory station for a prefecture. 231 ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND CANCER INCIDENCE NEAR OIL FIELDS IN THE AMAZON BASIN OF ECUADOR MIGUEL SAN SEBASTIAN, ARMSTRONG BEN, STEPHENS CAR- OLYN. Instituto de epidemiologia y salud comunitaria "Manuel. EMail: m.sansebastian@lshtm.ac.uk Background. In response to a community concern about the health effects of oil pollution, San Carlos village, which is surrounded by oil fields, was visited in October of 1998. In part of a broader study of the situation, the study team found that some inhabitants mentioned the presence of several cases of cancer in the village. Objectives. To examine environmental exposure and incidence and mortal? ity of cancer in the village of San Carlos, Amazon basin of Ecuador. Methods. Water samples of the local streams were analyzed for total petro? leum hydrocarbons (TPH). A preliminary list with potential cancer cases from 1989 to 1998 was prepared. Cases were compared with expected numbers of cancer morbidity and mortality registrations from Quito refer? ence population. Results. Analysis of the samples taken from the rivers of the village showed a TPH concentration of 144 and 288 times the limit permitted by the European Community regulation. Ten cases were diagnosed while resident in the village of San Carlos. An overall excess for all types of cancer was found in the male population (8 observed vs. 3.5 expected) with a risk 2.26 times higher than expected (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.97-4-46). There was an overall excess of deaths for all types of cancer (6 vs. 1.6 expected) among the male population 3.6 times higher than the reference population (95% CI: 1.31-7.81). Conclusions. The analysis of the water showed a severe exposure to TPH by the residents. The study suggested further an excess of cancers among the male population in the village of San Carlos. All specific cancer sites showed an excess. Results of overall cancer mortality were also 3.6 higher than expected among males. Errors in population estimates, access to health services, socioeconomic and other possible unmeasured factors might con- found the risk estimates. Further research is necessary to confirm these results. An environmental monitoring system to eliminate the sources of pollution and a surveillance system to gain knowledge of the evolution of cancer incidence and distribution in the area are recommended. 234 IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HAIR MANGANESE AND BLOOD PRESSURE? LORETA STRUMYLAITE, KREGZDYTE RIMA, RYSELIS STANISLO- VAS, DUDZEVICIUS JUOZAS. KAUNAS UNIVERSITY OF MEDI? CINE. EMail: loretas@kma.lt Manganese (Mn) is widely spread in environment. Some authors found a negative association between Mn exposure and blood pressure (BP). The data of our previous studies showed that about 1/3 of study population had increased Mn (&gt;2.93 /x-g/g) in hair. Therefore, we tried to assess a relation between hair Mn and blood pressure. The study included 630 Ceramics Plant workers occupationally exposed to Mn and 533 randomly selected controls. Inasmuch as, we tried to assess internal dose and effect relation, all study population was analyzed. Mn in hair determined by AAS. The measurements of BP were standardized ac? cording to WHO recommendations. Arterial hypertension (AH) considered to be systolic BP &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 90 mmHg. Age adjusted AH prevalences in men from 1st, 2nd and 3rd terciles were 48.1%, 42% and 41.9%, respectively (p&gt;0.05). The prevalence of AH in women from 1st tercile was significantly higher than in 3rd one (42.1% vs. 29%, p&lt;0.01). There were no significant differences between the means of systolic and diastolic BP adjusted for potential confounders in men and women from different Mn terciles. But BP differences between 1st and 3rd terciles were 5.77 mmHg in men and 2.24 mmHg in women for systolic and -1.48 mmHg and 1.96 mmHg, respectively, for diastolic BP. Multiple re? gression analysis of systolic and diastolic BP on log(hair Mn) did not show significant relation between BP and hair Mn neither in men, nor in women. These findings do not suggest the relation between blood pressure and manganese in hair. Other biomarkers or bigger study is necessary to prove the association.</page><page sequence="86">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S87 235 TOTAL OZONE DEPLETION AND MELANOMA OF THE SKIN IN CZECH REPUBLIC 1970 - 1997 ALEXANDER M. CELKO, VANICEK KAREL, DANOVA JANA. Charles University, 3rd School of Medicine, Prague, CZ. EMail: martin.celko@lB .cuni.cz The most recent estimates of Age Standardized Incidence Rate (World Standard) of skin melanoma in the more developed regions of the world are 5,69/100 000 in males and 5,53/100 000 in females. In the Czech Republic increased ASIR of skin melanoma from 6,4 in 1990 to 8,0/100 000 in 1997 in males and from 5,0 to 7,7/100 000 in females. As the measurements of total ozone have been carried out at Solar and Ozone Observatory in Hradec Kralove since 1962 and the data series well describe long-term changes of the ozone layer over Central Europe, we tried to compare secular trends of skin melanoma incidence with year's averages of total ozone measured in Dobson Units from 1970 till 1997. Climate and the atmosphere are not static and neither is the ozone layer. The amount of ozone in the stratosphere varies at different latitudes, altitudes and at different times of the year. And it also varies from year to year. But the linear regression of the trend of 28 years' averages of measurements of total ozone in DU. shows 6,8% decrease. On the other hand the linear regression of the melanoma incidence trend shows during the same time (1970 - 1997) 168% increase in males and 150% increase in females. Malignant melanoma usually occurs in younger people. In 1997 occurred 23% of new cases ( = 126) in males younger 50 years of age and 43% of new cases ( = 236) in males younger 60 years, comparing with females 51,2% (=314) under 50 and 86,3% of new cases (=529) under 60 years. Years of Potential Life Lost under 65 years in cutaneous melanoma represents 14,1 lost years in males, resp. 14,9 lost years in females, which stress the burden of this cancer in productive age. Comparing to nonmela? noma skin cancers, in melanoma intermittent acute sun exposure seems to be more damaging than cumulative exposure, especially on childhood and adolescence. As Czech Republic is the inland country, tinned skin repesented for decades symbol of expensive holiday spent on the sea-shore. Only radical changes in recreational activities together with keeping up the Motreal protocol setting limits on the use of CFCs, can slow down the negative trend of total ozone depletion hand in hand with cutaneous melanoma incidence (and other nonmelanoma skin cancers) in the Czech Republic. 238 PREVALENCE OF PARENT REPORTED SYMPTOMS IN URBAN CHILDREN AND MODELLED TRAFFIC RELATED AIR POLLU? TION USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS PAUL FISCHER, BRETVELD R. Nat. Inst. Publ. Health &amp; Environment RIVM. EMail: p.fischer@rivm.nl The aim of the study was to assess the association between modelled traffic-related air pollution and respiratory symptoms in a population of children aged 5/6 and 11/12 years in the city of Utrecht. Long term N02 concentrations were used as indicator component for traffic-related air pollution. Long term N02 concentrations were estimated by using Geo? graphic Information Systems. Based on data from N02 measurement cam- paigns at 60 sites with passive sampling devices, linear regression models were developed decribing the association between measured N02 and a number of environmental variables. Variables used were fraction of area covered by buildings, type of street at measurement-site and the distance of the site to the nearest traffic road. In the analyses four exposure measures were used: modelled N02 concentrations around the postcode area of the child's residence, around the postcode area of the school, time-weighted concentration based on residence and school concentration. Information on respiratory symptoms and potential confounders (gender, passive smoking, presence of furry/feathered pets, dampness of the home, parental education, etnicity) was collected by questionnaire. Data of 1949 children of age 5/6 and 1320 children of age 11/12 were analysed. The response rate was 87%. Data were analysed with multiple logistic regression. No associations were found between the different estimated outdoor N02 measures and respiratory symptoms. The conclusion of the study was that no association was found between modelled traffic-related air pollution and respiratory symptoms in this group of children. 236 EMERGING ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN CHIL? DREN DURING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: TAIWAN AS AN EXAMPLE 1UNG-DER WANG, CHUNG CHIH-WEN, CHAN CHANG-CHUAN. Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial. EMail: jdwang@ha.mc.ntu.edu.tw During the last three decades, Taiwan has been on a rapid economic development with increases of gross domestic product from US$ 2.54 billions in 1964 to US$ 283.3 billions in 1997. During the same period, mortality and morbidity caused by environmental hazards have emerged to the most important health problem for children, because most infectious diseases have been under control. This review focuses on three specific fields to illustrate such a tendency: motor vehicle injury, respiratory disease related to indoor and outdoor air pollution, and environmental lead poisoning. Motor vehicle related injury has become the leading cause of death for children, which increased from 2% of total mortality in 1964 to more than 30 % after 1990. Prevalence of asthma in school children of Taipei increased from 1.3% in 1974 to 5.1% in 1985 and to 10.8% in 1994. School children in the urban communities had significantly more respiratory symptoms (day or night cough, chronic cough, shortness of breath, and nasal symptoms) and diseases (sinusitis, wheezing or asthma, allergic rhinitis, and bronchitis) when com? pared with those living in the rural community, after adjustment for various determinants. Moreover, ozone exposure appears to temporarily impair pul? monary function of school children, and acute exposure to nitrogen oxides increased schools children's absenteeism. A case study of increased lead absorption and impaired IQ (intelligence quotient) among children attend? ing a kindergarten next to a lead recycling smelter also indicated the significance of community right-to-know and pollution prevention. We conclude that motor vehicle-related injury and environmental pollution should be dealt with proactively during economic and industrial develop- 239 THE CELL TYPES OF SKIN CANCERS ASSOCIATED WITH IN? GESTION OF ARSENIC HOW-RAN GUO. National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. EMail: hrguo@mail.ncku.edu.tw The association between arsenic ingestion and cancer has been documented for more than a century. Previous studies showed that the carcinogenic effect of ingested arsenic on urinary system was cell-type specific. To evaluate whether it is also true for skin cancers associated with arsenic ingestion, an ecological study was conducted on 243 townships in Taiwan. The arsenic levels were assessed on the basis of measurement reports from a previous survey, and thecases of skin cancer were identified using the information gathered by the National Cancer Registry Program. The data were analyzed by regression models using multiple variables to describe the exposure status to arsenic; each variable denoted the proportion of people in a specific exposure category in each township. Among the three cell types of skin cancers studied, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma appeared to be associated with arsenic levels in drinking water. But, such associations were not observed for malignant melanoma.

EMail: hrguo@mail.ncku.edu.tw Since 1992, more than 200 buildings in Taiwan were found to contain steel contaminated with 60Co, and thousands of civilians received chronic low dose radiation on a daily basis. We conducted a study to assess the cancer risk associated with such exposures. To the end of 1997, we foilowed up 686 men and 730 women who had stayed in the contaminated buildings for more than 1 year and received more than 1 mSv of excessive radiation each year. We calculated the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for each type of cancer using the data from the National Cancer Registry Program. A total of 18 cancer patients were identified, and we found a statistically significant increase in the risk of thyroid cancer (SIR = 6.8, two-sided p = 0.02). Non-statistically significant excess risks were observed for gall bladder cancer (SIR= 4.5), leukemia (SIR = 3.7), tongue cancer (SIR= 3.6), ovarian cancer (SIR = 2.7), lymphoma (SIR= 2.6), and breast cancer (SIR = 1.8). The results suggested that chronic low dose radiation may increase the risks for certain types of cancer in human population. However, because no more than three cases were observed for cancers of any organ, further follow-up of the population is needed to confirm our findings. 243 THE EFFECTS OF THE ASIAN DUST EVENTS ON DAILY MOR? TALITY IN SEOUL, KOREA HO-1ANG KWON, CHO SOO-HUN, CHUN YOUNG-SIN. Dankook University. EMail: hojang@anseo.dankook.ac.kr Wind blown dust originating from the arid deserts of Mongolia and China is a well-known springtime meteorological phenomenon throughout East Asia. The dust appears as a distinct yellow cloud in Korea, we usually call it "yellow sand". It is likely that this dust cloud has caused many casualties in Korea. And these concerns have increased because it comes to Korea passing over heavily industrialized eastern China. This study was planned to inves- tigate the possible effects ofthe dust events on mortality. Between 1991 and 1998, we identified 57 "yellow sand" days in Seoul. The 24hr mean TSP concentration during dust events was 115.2 ug/m3. During control days which are pairs of days-one from 1 week prior to dust event and the other from the following week, that was 84.6 ug/m3. We used the bidirectional case-crossover design in which exposures to the dust event at death are compared with exposures both before and after death. We compared the rate of nonaccidental deaths on the event versus nonevent days using 1:2 conditional logistic regression model. There was an elevated risk on the event days (RR=1.32; CI, 1.22-1.42). Relative risk for cardiovascular death (RR=1.52; CI,1.38-1.66) was greater than that of total nonaccidental death. Our results suggest that the Asian dust events experienced in Seoul may have increased daily mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality. A fine characterization of this events is needed to understand the mechanisms of increased mortality. 242 HISTORICAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES IN A NESTED CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF BREAST CANCER ERIN S. O'LEARY, VENA J, FREUDENHEIM JL, CALKINS H, BRA- SURE J. SUNY at Stony Brook. EMail: eoleary@uhmc.sunysb.edu Agricultural pesticide use was extensive on Long Island from the late 1940s through the 1970s, when many of the organochlorine pesticides were banned. However, it has been difficult to study these exposures because no historical records exist to indicate where and how much of these chemicals were applied. We estimated the historical environmental exposure to pesti? cides in 105 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1980-1992 and 210 age and race-matched controls from a cohort of residentially stable Long Island residents who completed a short mailed questionnaire. Length of residence was validated in the county clerks' offices. Prior agricultural land use was assessed for each woman's long-term residence from aerial photo? graphs taken in 1947 in Suffolk and 1950 in Nassau County. Pesticides detected in drinking water were estimated from records obtained from health departments from the late 1970s to 1992. Geographic information software was used to calculate the distance between residences and hazardous waste sites containing pesticides. An increased breast cancer risk was found for women residing within one mile of hazardous waste sites containing organo? chlorine pesticides (Odds Ratio [OR] =2.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 - 7.09), after adjusting for risk factors. A statistically significant inter? action of residence on land used for agricultural in 1947 or 1950 and age at first birth was shown. Although this interaction may be related to breast cancer through hypothesized pathways involving endogenous estrogens and xenoestrogens, its biologic significance is unknown at this time and needs to be replicated. This exploratory study suggests that exposure to pesticides in the environment related to breast cancer in women needs to be more comprehensively investigated. 246 HEALTH EFFECTS IN POPULATIONS LIVING CLOSE TO LANDFILL SITES LARS IARUP, ARNOLD RICHARD, GROSSINHO ANA, KOLD- JENSEN TINA, MORRIS SARA, REED SEAN, WAKEFIELD JON, EL? LIOTT PAUL. The Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Department of. EMail: l.jarup@ic.ac.uk Background There is public concern about the potential health effects of living close to landfill sites. Exposure to landfill contents may take place if there is leakage of gases or fugitive soil particles from the landfill or if landfill chemicals leak into the ground water. Recent studies involving UK landfill sites (the Welsh Nant-y-Gwyddon study and the EUROHAZCON study) have shown mod? erately increased risks of congenital malformations near landfill sites. The objective of the present study was to study health effects, mainly congenital malformations, but also some cancers, in the vicinity of UK landfill sites. Methods and results A total of 6,900 landfill sites (including special (hazardous) waste sites as well as sites containing household waste) have been identified using the Environment Agency landfill site database. The site characteristics have been identified in a separate validation study on a random selection of 285 sites. In particular, the location and contents of the landfill sites have been validated as well as the existence of other sources of potential exposure in the vicinity of the landfill sites. Using the databases held by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College, analyses of birth defects/birth weights and incidence of selected cancers in the vicinity of landfills have been performed. Relative risks for these health outcomes have been computed for various distances from the landfill sites to explore potential trends in relative risks with distance from the sites. Meteorological data have been used to refine exposure assessment. Separate analyses have been performed for special waste landfill sites and sites containing household waste. Results will be presented at the conference.</page><page sequence="88">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S89 247 ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE AND P53 MUTATIONS IN LUNG CANCER ANNA YNGVESON, BOFFETTA PAOLO, HUSGAFVEL-PURSI- AINEN KIRSTI, NYBERG FREDRIK, PERSHAGEN GORAN. Institute of environmental medicine, Karolinska. EMail: anna.yngveson@imm.ki.se OBJECTIVES: Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is abun- dant and has been implicated as a risk factor for lung cancer in nonsmokers. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are common in lung tumors of smokers but less is known about lung tumors of nonsmokers. We investigated mutations in the p53 gene in lung tumors among nonsmokers and their relation to ETS exposure. METHODS: The study included 122 lung cancer cases among nonsmokers recruited from the National Swedish radon epidemiological study and a Swedish study on ETS and lung cancer. Information regarding ETS exposure from the spouse and other risk factors was obtained through questionnaires. Residential radon was measured in residences of study subjects during the last 35 years before diagnosis and a time weighted average radon exposure was calculated for the period 35-3 years. Exon 5-8 of the p53 gene were sequenced after PCR-amplification and single stranded conformation poly? morphism or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses. RESULTS: The overall mutation prevalence was 11 per cent. When ad? justed for age, gender and residential radon, the cases ever exposed to ETS at home had an OR for p53 mutation of 2.3 (95% CI 0.7-7.8) compared to those never exposed to ETS at home. No mutation was detected among the 21 cases never exposed to ETS from the spouse and with time weighted average residential level less than 50 Bq/m3. Base substitutions were the most common type of p53 mutation (9/14) with G:C to A:T transitions dominating. The mutation pattern did not show any pronounced difference between ETS exposed and unexposed cases but the limited number of mutations makes interpretation difficult. No G:C to T:A transversion, which is the predominant type of mutation among smokers, was seen among the ETS exposed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests higher mutation prevalence in the p53 gene in lung tumors among cases ever exposed to ETS at home. No clear difference in mutation pattern was seen between ETS exposed and unex? posed cases. 249 CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS FROM CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES IAMES GOMES, LLOYD OL, ANILAL SV. Centre for Agricultural Med? icine, University of. EMail: James.Gomes@usask.ca Acetylcholinesterase-activity-inhibiting organophosphorus pesticides are neuro- toxic and are reported to induce neurological and neuro-muscular dysfunction in farmers. Acute exposure to some of the organophosphates (Chlorpyrifos) have been reported to induce congenital malformations in humans. To assess repro? ductive toxicity from chronic exposure to a mixture of selected organophospho? rus pesticides, the incidence of congenital malformations was examined in experimental mice. A mixture of six most commonly locally used organophos? phates (Salute, Selecron, Dursban, Actellic, Hostathion and Nogos) was pre- pared by mixing formulations of individual pesticides in proportion to their LD50 dose value. Groups of mice (Group A: males and females exposed to a low dose (3% of LD50) of pesticides, Group B: males and females exposed to a high dose (10% of LD50) of pesticides, Group C: only males exposed to a high dose and Group D: only females exposed to a high dose) were exposed prior to pregnancy for a period of six weeks as per the protocol to a measured dose of the mixture of pesticides. Control group (Group E) was exposed to only corn oil for a period of six weeks prior to pregnancy. The exposed and control groups of mice were monitored for weight gain and intake of food and water during pregnancy. The pregnany was carried to full term gestation during which food and water was provided ad libitum. The embryos at full time gestation were observed for anatomical malformations of the abdomen, brain, ears, eyes, heart, jaws and tongue. The exposed groups of mice were compared with unexposed mice (exposed to only corn oil) for congenital malformations. The most commonly obsrved malformations in all the exposed groups were low set microtia, maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia, exopthalmia and protruding tongue with Groups B and D showing the highest incidences of congenital malformations and also multiple malformations. Stunted growth was also commonly observed in all the exposed groups. The percent incidence of congenital malformations was the highest (10.1%) in males and females exposed to high dose (Group B) foilowed by females-only-exposed-to-high-dose group (8.2%)(Group D) and males-only- exposed-to-high-dose group (5.3%) (Group C). Spontaneously induced congen? ital malformations in the control group were 0.7%. Chronic exposure to selected organophosphorus pesticides in either males or females prior to pregnancy increased the risk of congenital malformations in embryos at full term gestation in a dose response manner. 248 A SIMULATION STUDY FOR ALLOCATING PARTIALLY CLAS? SIFIED PERSON-TIME ADA YOUK, STONE R, MARSH G. University of Pittsburgh. EMail: ayouk+@pitt.edu PURPOSE: We implemented a simulation study to assess the validity and reliability of a method for allocating partially classified person-time in a cohort study. The Iterative Allocation (IA) algorithm is a model-based technique developed using the EM algorithm (Dempster AP, Laird NM, Rubin DB, JRSS, 1977). The IA is an adaptation of a method proposed by Gong et al. (JASA, 1990), who considered misclassification involving a non-time-dependent covariate in a Poisson regression setting to estimate the distribution of events and person-time for correctly classified individuals. We implemented the methods of Gong et al. in S-PLUS and extended these in several directions to classify deaths and person-time in the presence of misclassification. The IA uses individual-level data and incorporates either internal cohort rates or external population-based rates into the imputation. We estimated the variance of the estimated person-time using the bootstrap (Efron, 1982). METHODS: We simulated ten data sets based on known data for a large cohort, by assigning racial data to be missing completely at random for some workers. For each of the simulated data sets, person-time generated using OCMAP-PLUS (Marsh GM, Youk AO, Stone RA, et al., JOEM, 1998) was allocated using the IA. We computed multiple imputation variances for the mean person-time. We validated the IA by comparing total age-time-race- specific person-time contributions to the corresponding quantities using the known data. RESULTS: The IA produced virtually identical results for all ten replica- tions of the simulation. The relative variation of the estimated mean years of age-time-race-specific person-time was about 5% and 10% for white and nonwhite workers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in the example considered, the IA produced reliable estimates of the age-time-race-specific years of person-time and their corresponding variances. 250 PROSTATE CANCER AMONG RURAL AND URBAN MEN IN SASKATCHEWAN, 1969-1998. IAMES GOMES, SMITH P, MCDUFFIE HH. Centre for Agricultural Medicine, University of. EMail: James.Gomes@usask.ca Prostate cancer in men in Canada is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin tumours) and is the second most common cause of cancer mortality. From 1984-97, in Saskatchewan, the incidence and mor? tality rates of prostate cancer have been higher compared to the Canadian average. The incidence of prostate cancer has been reported to be higher among farmers compared to non-farmers. To examine the hypotheses that farmers have a higher incidence of prostate cancer compared to non-farmers and that farmers develop prostate cancer at an older age and also die at an older age compared to their counterparts, this ecological study sought associations between prostate cancer incidence and mortality and residence type (rural versus town versus city). All cases of prostate cancer diagnosed between January 1, 1969 and Decem? ber 31, 1998 were extracted from the Cancer Registry of the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency. The Cancer Registry is population-based and cancer is a reportable disease in Saskatchewan. Thus, the Cancer Registry achieves virtually 100% case ascertainment. Variables extracted were: date of diag? nosis, date of death, cause of death, age at diagnosis, morphology and residence code at diagnosis. The analysis was based on three residence types: city, town and rural. Denominator data came from the annual Saskatchewan Covered Population publication produced by Saskatchewan Health. Age- specific incidence rates, mean ages at diagnosis and death and mean survival were calculated by residence types. There were 14,158 cases of prostate cancer registered in Saskatchewan between 1969 and 1998 after exclusion of cases of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma. There were 14,133 cases with residence-type data, with 3904 (27,6%) cases in rural, 4009 (28.4%) cases in towns and 6220 (44-0%) cases in urban areas. A total of 4062 deaths were recorded during the study period with prostate cancer as the primary cause of dearh. Prostate cancer incidence in rural areas during the five five-year periods (1969-73, 1974-78, 1979-83, 1984-88 and 1989-93) were lower compared to the incidence in cities for all men over 55 years of age and higher for men in towns, however, in 1994-98 rural men over 75 had the highest incidence of prostate cancer. The mean ages at diagnosis and death for men in towns were higher for each of the five-year periods compared to men from cities. Men from towns are diagnosed with prostate cancer later in life and these men also died at an older age and have a higher incidence rate of prostate cancer.</page><page sequence="89">S90 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 251 IS SHE GETTING THE MESSAGE? THE GREAT LAKES BASIN- WIDE SPORT FISH ADVISORY OUTREACH PROGRAM LAURIE DRAHEIM, ANDERSON H, HANRAHAN L, FALK C, KA- NAREK M, STEENPORT D. WI Division of Public Health. EMail: ldraheim@facstaff.wisc.edu The Consortium for the Health Assessment of Great Lakes (GL) Sport Fish Consumption has developed a GL basin-wide outreach program to distribute sport fish advisory information to women of childbearing age and minority groups. Previous studies conducted by the Consortium have shown that these target groups are not receiving the message about what sport fish they should and should not consume. High consumption of PCB-contaminated fish has been linked to slower development and learning disabiiities in infants and children borne to women who regularly have eaten highly contaminated fish for many years before becoming pregnant. A two-day risk communication workshop was held in December 1998 with the Consortium states (IL, IN, Ml, MN, NY, OH and WI) to discuss the problem and brainstorm ways of communicating the fish advisory message to women and minority groups. Speakers were recruited from a variety of disciplines and arenas, including risk communication and psychology. Since the workshop, the states have collaborated and developed several outreach "tools", such as fish magnets, recipe cards, and posters, to convey the fish advisory message to women and minorities. Each state has developed their own awareness message and selected outreach products based on their state-specific strategy. Outreach materials will be distributed throughout the Great Lakes basin in a variety of places such as WIC clinics, Ob/Gyn clinics, pediatric clinics, health fairs, state fairs, and fishing shows. The outreach products will aim to encourage women and minorities to follow their state's fishing advisory when they decide to eat sport fish. 254 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEMOCHROMATOSIS MUTATIONS AND BONE LEAD CONCENTRATION IN THE NORMATIVE AG? ING STUDY ROBERT WRIGHT, WRIGHT R, SILVERMAN E, SENTER J, BARTH M, WEISS S, SPARROW D, LEE M, HU H. The Channing Laboratory, Brigham and Women's. EMail: robert.wright@channing.harvard.edu Background: Body iron burden is inversely associated with blood lead con? centration. Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease in which subjects develop increased body iron burdens, making it a candidate to modify body lead burden. Objective: To determine whether the C282Y or H63D hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations are associated with body lead burden. Methods: Patella and tibia lead levels were measured by X-Ray flourescence in subjects from the Normative Aging Study. Blood lead levels were mea? sured by inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry. DNA samples were genotyped for C282Y and H63D using PCR/RFLP. A series of multiple linear regression models using bone or blood lead as dependent variables; age, smoking and education (which have been identified as primary determinants of bone lead in previous studies) as independent variables and C282Y or H63D as effect modifiers were constructed. Subjects with the most education were the referent group. In addition, regression models stratified by HFE genotype were constructed. Results: 58/476 subjects carried the C282Y mutation and 147/607 carried the H63D mutation. Mean tibia, patella and blood lead levels were consistently lower in both carriers of C282Y and H63D compared to wild type genotypes. For example among C282Y carriers, patella lead levels differed from wild type subjects (25.7 ? 12.8 ug/g bone vs 30.1 ? 20.1 ug/g bone; p = 0.03). Among the regression results of most interest, in the patella lead model, when C282Y was entered as an interaction term with education, the beta coefficient for education changed from 10.3 ug lead/g bone lead among wild type genotypes to 5.8 ug lead/g bone lead among subjects with C282Y (p=0.26 for interaction). The effect of education on tibia lead levels across strata of H63D exposure changed from a beta coefficient of 7.4 ug lead/g bone among wild types, to 4-2 ug lead/g bone among subjects with H63D (p=0.07 for interaction). The results of the stratified models also demon? strated evidence of possible effect modification by both C282Y and H63D on the association between education and blood/bone lead levels and will be presented. Conclusions: Since education is a known proxy measure of environmental/occupational lead exposure, HFE mutations may alter the kinetics of lead accumulation after exposure. These effects may be mediated by alterations in lead metabolism via iron metabolic pathways regulated by HFE gene product. 253 PM2.5 MEASUREMENTS IN AMBIENT AEROSOL: TEOM VS. HARVARD IMPACTOR IOSEF CYRYS, DIETRICH GUNNER, TUCH THOMAS, HEINRICH JOACHIM. GSF-National Research Center for Environment and. EMail: cyrys@gsf.de Objectives: Systematic lower levels of PM concentrations were reported for the Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) method compared with the time-integrated gravimetric PM methods for some U.S. and Australian locations. It was suggested that the differences between the TEOM and the gravimetric method may be due to the sample heating employed in the TEOM. The purpose of this study was to verify tnese results for an urban aerosol in Germany. Furthermore this study investigates whether a heated Harvard-Marple Impactor (HI) would lead to disappear of the differences between TEOM and the gravimetric HI method. Methods: The measurements were conducted from March through May 1999 in Erfurt, Germany. TOEM Model 1400A with an inlet flow rate of 3 1/min was used. The filter was heated to 50 ?C. For time-integrated PM2.5 measurements the Harvard-Marple Impactor (HI) operating at 4 1/min was used. A heating system allowed to keep the HI filters at 50 ?C (? 1 ?C) was developed. PMZ.D were measured continuously by the TEOM and parallel to it by unheated HI (32 days) and heated HI (14 days). Results: Two time-series or comparisons were conducted. The first time series compared the TEOM with the unheated HI, the second one compared the TEOM with the heated HI. Ratios of the PM2.5 PM2.5 means (TEOM N (TEOM) (HI) vs. HI) TEOM/HI unheated 32 15.1 ug/m3 21.9 ug/m3 0.74 ? 0.19 TEOM/HI heated 14 16.4 ug/m3 15.5 ug/m3 1.05 ? 0.06 The following regression parameters were obtained: PM2.5 (TEOM) = 0.66 PM2.5 (unheated HI) + 0.8 with R2 = 0.81 PM2.5 (TEOM) = 1.06 PM2.5 (heated HI) - 0.1 with R2 = 0.94 No correlation were found between the measured TEOM/HI ratios and the concentrations of gaseous air pollutants such as NO, N02, S02 and 03, or meteorological parameters such wind velocity, temperature or humidity. Discussion: The mean TEOM/unheated HI ratio observed in Erfurt (MR=0.74) is comparable to the U.S. and Australian results (MR between 0.63 and 0.89). After the implementation ofa heating system in the HI, both methods provided very similar results. This finding supports the suggestion that volatilization of semi-volatile aerosol components from the heated filter in the TEOM caused the lower TEOM values in comparison to the gravi? metric measurements. Because the level of measured ammonium nitrate is very low in Erfurt, other semi-volatile components might be responsible for the loss of particulate mass and should be further investigated. 255 LOW PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND OVERWEIGHT AS RISK FAC? TORS FOR RECURRENT RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN PRE- ADOLESCENT CHILDREN WIESLAW JEDRYCHOWSKl MAUGERI U, FLAK E, BIANCHII. Jagiello- nian University, Chair of Epidemiology and. EMail: myjedryc@cyf-kr.edu.pl Background. Over the last decades an interest has been focused on environ? mental factors that may influence the risk of respiratory illness in childhood such as air pollution or environmental tobacco smoke. Very small attention was given to other potential risk factors explaining childhood respiratory illnesses in terms of life-style like overweight or physical activity level. However, physical exercise in children enhancing immune function may lessen the risk of acute respiratory tract infections. Material and methods. Standardised interviews with mothers of 1028 preadolescent children in Krakow that have been gathered over three year follow-up dealt with child's respiratory health and repeated episodes of acute respiratory infections, allergy, overweight, social background, outdoor and in? door pollution. Predisposition to acute respiratory infections in child has been defined as frequent spells (10 or more) of acute respiratory infections experi? enced by a child over the last three years. Practising regularly sport and the number of hours spent daily on TV watching or home work over the study period defined physical activity levels. Overweight was based on the BMI index. Results. The adjusted RR estimates of predisposition to acute respiratory infec? tions (PRI) was significantly higher in children with the low physical activity (RR = 2.77; 95% CI: 1.65-4.65) or with moderate activity (RR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.32- 2.68) than among highly active group. The corresponding RR esti? mates in the non-allergic children were 3.13 (95% CI: 1.52-6.14) and 1.86 (95% CI: 1.13 - 3.04). In the allergic children the adjusted RR estimates were consistent with those found in non-allergic subjects. The RR estimates among the overweight children were also much higher in the low physical activity group (RR = 4.16; 95%CI: 0.78- 22.2) and in the moderate activity group (RR = 3.00,95% CI = 1.22 - 7.34. The corresponding RR estimates in children without overweight were 2.65, (95% CI: 1.52-4.60) and 1.74, (95%CI: 1.18-2.57). Conclusions. Physical exercise in children may enhance immune function and lessens the risk of acute respiratory tract infection rates. Low physical activity in preadolescent children is independent predictor of increased risk of respiratory infections besides overweight and other potential risk factors. from *) the Chair of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Coli.

EMail: myjedryc@cyf-kr.edu.pl The aims of teaching environmental epidemiology are numerous and the recognition of health hazards in the community are certainly the primary one. In the undergraduate and postgraduate courses we put much emphasis on teaching the students about the methods and field techniques in gaining the knowledge on the interaction between the environment and the com? munity health. However, there is much less engagement and interest in teaching the students evidence based prevention (EBP). If epidemiology has to meet the challenges of the new millennium we have to pay much more attention on how prevention practice may be built up on epidemiological evidence and how its effectiveness should be assessed in both community and clinical settings. Certainly, it is not an easy task as new approaches and methods have to be introduced in the teaching curriculum.

ING HABITS IN YOUNG PEOPLE FROM PANEVEZYS REGION RAMUTE VAICAITIENE, SEREIKA V, CERNIAUSKIENE L. KAUNAS UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE. EMail: RAMUVAIC@TAKAS.LT Research studies which have been done at Lithuanian centres, showed that our population improper behaviour is frequent, unhealthy envinronmental factors are often influencing on the organism, unhealthy habits are frequent. The social and economical conditions are causing feeling of unsafety and rising up psychoemocional stress at public life. Biochemical mechanism of psychoemocional stress and smoking is similar - the development of oxida? tive stress. Aim of our study was to investigate blood samples of young reqruits called up to Panevezys infantry batalion (MIB) before the service as well as their anthropometric and psychological and behaviour data. Object and methods: 177 recruits of Panevezys MIB, using questionnaire for eval? uating stressogenic factors and smoking habits, EUROFIT test system for anthropometric measurement, biochemical - for lipid peroxidation product malondyaldehid (MDA) concentration, as the marker of clinical oxidative stress and antioxidantic vitamins E ir A concentration in blood serum measurement. Results: Biochemical data showed MDA concentration between 2,6 - 7 micromol/1 (mean 4,56?0,79 micromol/1). Vitamin E concentration ranged between 8 - 44 micromol/1 (mean 21,8+0,41 mmol/1), vitamin A -1,3 - 3,3 micromol/1 (mean 2,18?0,41 micromol/1). Rural conscripts MDA concen? tration (mean 4,71+0,75 micromol/1) was significantly higher than urban (mean 4,32?0,77 micromol/1), mean age was 20,7?1,3 years. Vitamin A concentration in smokers was significantly higher than in non-smokers (2,23?0,39micromol/l and 2,07?0,41micromol/l, p&lt;0,01). Increased MDA serum concentration ( 5,0micromol/l) was found in 38,3% smokers and in 27,7% non-smokers respectively. Conclusion. The complex of these investigations showed very important role of smoking as an oxidative stress increasing the concentration of biochem? ical markers of young Lihuanian men raising up the problem of needfull preventive strategy in service units. 258 ASTHMA SYMPTOMS AND SLOWER LUNG FUNCTION GROWTH OVER TWO YEAR FOLLOW-UP IN PREADOLESCENT CHILDREN. THE CASE COHORT STUDY. WIESLAW IEDRYCHOWSKI, MAUGERI U, FLAK E, BIANCHI I. Jagiellonian University, Chair of Epidemiology and. EMail: myjedryc@cyf- kr.edu.pl The purpose of the paper was to assess the effect of recent and persistent asthma symptoms on lung function growth in children over two-year follow- up. The main lung function end point was the slow lung function growth (SLFG), defined as being below the low quartile of gain in FVC, FEV1 and FEF25-75% over two years. In the multivariate logistic analysis, a set of potential confounders and variables that were potentially associated with pulmonary function growth included baseline height and the level a given pulmonary test at the entry to the study, growth rate (difference in height between 1997 and 1995) and gender. Diagnosis of the asthma was based on the occurrence of wheezing and/or attacks of breathlessness. Adjusted risk ratios of SLFG in the study sample was consistently higher in the exposed groups (with asthma symptoms) in comparison with the children for whom the symptoms over the study period have not been reported. The adjusted risk ratios for SLG(FEF25-75%) in children with persistent symptoms were 5.84 (95% CI: 2.53-13.50), in the group with remitted symptoms 2.63 (95%CI:1.38-4.99) and in those with new symptoms 2.03 (95% CI: 0.97 - 4.28). The corresponding risk ratios for SLFG (FEV1) were 3.46 (95%CI: 1.43 - 8.40, 2.06 (95%CI: 0.93-4.58 and 1.46 (95% CI: 1.02-2.10). 261 WHERE BENEFITS EXCEED COSTS: TWO US DRINKING WA? TER REGULATIONS RONNIE LEVIN. USEPA. EMail: levin.ronnie@epa.gov Since the 1970s, US federal regulatory agencies have been required to conduct cost(-benefit) analyses on proposed regulations. Conceptually, es? timating both costs and benefits is fairly straight-forward; in practice, esti? mating the benefits is many times more difficult - speculative and 'soft' - than estimating costs. And indeed, it is uncommon for benefits to exceed or even equal costs. For two US drinking water regulations, multiple and different cost-benefit analyses have shown a clear argument for regulation: lead and microbial contamination. Interestingly, both cases are 'residual' risks, that is, the exposures had already been addressed when subsequent analyses indicated that additional regulation was cost-justified. Three separate and different cost-benefit approaches have been conducted for each of these regulations, which included divergent categories of health and other benefits. For the regulation of lead in drinking water, Levin 1986, EES/KJC 1989, and EPA 1991, each estimated the costs and benefits of controlling lead contamination of drinking water through corrosion control and source reduction; benefits ranged from 4:1 to &gt; 10:1, even though the EPA 1991 included only health benefits and EES/KJC 1989 included only materials damages! The issue of microbial contamination of drinking water is more complicated as it is related to drinking water disinfection, with attendant health and other impacts. Nonetheless, 3 separate and different economic and risk assessments have found the benefits of improved control of microbial contam? ination to be highly cost-justified. Again, the methods vary greatly, from a general cost-benefit approach in Levin and Kleiman (in press), to the applica? tion of the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) metric (Havelaar, in press), to the combination of cost-effectiveness and Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) approaches with the traditional risk assessment paradigm (EPA 1998). The recent time-series and modeling studies linking general water quality indicators with gastrointestinal disease will contribute significantly to these studies by providing a more accurate estimate of attributable risk.

A.N. SISIN HUMAN ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT. EMail: perchov@glasnet.ru, novik@com2com Introduction. According to the decree of Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation l 25 and ! 03-19/24-3483 from 10/11/97 it was decided to begin the risk assessment methodology implemention in Russia. The importance of this problem is determined environmental status and also by unsufficient scientific development or low accessibility to screening risk assessment. In Russia envi? ronmental status assessment is conducted by comparing real levels of contami? nation with the standarts, which is developed allowable level of content of a substance in environmental media (air, water, soil), which does not cause nonadverse effects - Maximum Allowable Concentration (MAC). MACs, us a rule, substantiate in a chronic animals experiments (in ambient air - 24 h./day, 7 day/week, 4 month., in water - 6 day/week, 6 month.), using sensitive tests. To the present time in Russia more than 1400 MACs in water and 400 MACs in ambient air have substantiated. However MACs aim is prevention of any, including indirect changes in a health state and living conditions of the population, including waming of possible development of subjective responses (for example, smell, colouring, taste). The only 1/3 MACs in water substantiate using direct health effects. Therefore in case of MACs exceeding, application hygienic normative to direct health effect risk assessment isn't always possible. Objectives.As first priority in Russia today methodology of reference dose substantiation should be developed, which requires generalization of all allow? able information on foreign reference doses and concentration, usings, generally accepted information sources, comparative analysis of domestic and foreign safe exposure levels to be able to detect possible reasons of discrepancies between them, substantiation of methodologycal approaches to development of Russian safe exposure levels, which will be a basis for realization of risk assessment in this country, development of the first list of substances, for which these values will be substantiated. Methods. More than 20 information sources were generalized including Russian publications and database. By results of made work 25 specialized database were create. They contain information about all known reference dose and principal studies for it, physical and chemical, toxicological and hazard chemical proper? ties (more than 100 characteristics). Results and conclusions. Pilot variant integrated computer information and prognosis system to risk assessment; pro? gram to prognosis cancer risk, calculation dermal exposure risk and multimedia complex exposure risk are created. A comparative thorough analysis of primary materials substantiating foreign and russian safe exposure levels and cancero- genic effect potentials was conducted. Methodologycal approaches to the sub? stantiation of Russian reference levels were developed. Basis principles are consideration principal studies to substantiating both reference doses form different sources and Russian MACs, using universal uncertainties factors system (temporary, interspecies distinctions, degree adverse effect, database completeness etc. - in general 11 parametrs); confidence assessment; calculation weighted average value. An extended list of Russian reference dose was prepared. 265 ECOLOGIC STUDY OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE TO PCBS AND CANCER INCIDENCE IN EASTERN SLOVAKIA. MARIAN PAVUK, CERHAN J, LYNCH CF, PLESKO I. School of Public Health, University of Iowa. EMail: mpavuk@blue.weeg.uiowa.edu PCBs were produced in the Chemko Strazske chemical plant in the Michalovce district of Eastern Slovakia from 1959 to 1984. Recent environmental sampling in Michalovce documents extensive PCB contamination in the environment and food chain, and greater than three-fold higher serum PCB levels in the general population of this area compared to Svidnik, an unexposed district in Eastern Slovakia. We conducted an ecologic study to compare cancer incidence in the two districts from 1985 through 1994. During this time frame, there were 6662 incidence cancers in the Michalovce district and 2036 cancers in the Svidnik district. We first calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for each district for 51 cancer sites reported to the National Cancer Registry, using standard age-specific rates from the entire Eastern Slovakia population. Next the ratios of SIRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare the cancer experience between the two districts. We found an excess of oropharyngeal cancers (Ratio=1.35, CI 1.00-1.84), cancers ofthe gastrointestinal tract (Ratio= 1.15, CI 1.02-1.30) and cancers of the respiratory tract (Ratio=1.10, CI 0.94-1.29) in the Michalovce district. This excess was mainly due to stomach (Ratio=1.44, CI 1.13-1.85), colon (Ratio=1.42, CI 1.05-1.94) and lung (Ratio=1.18, CI 1.00-1.39) cancers. There was also an excess risk in Michalovce for all female reproductive cancers (Ratio=1.32, CI 1.09-1.60), mainly explained by an excess of ovarian and cervical cancers. We did not observe excesses for cancers ofthe liver, brain, lung or for melanoma, leukemias or lymphomas. Our finding of increased incidence of gastrointestinal cancers is consistent with some previous reports that found increased mortality for gastrointestinal cancers in PCB-exposed cohorts; the findings for oropharyngeal cancers are novel. These findings must be interpreted with caution given the study design, lack of control for confounding by other lifestyle or other environmental factors, and the evaluation of multiple cancer sites. Nevertheless, given that ingestion is the primary route of PCB exposure and the fact that the exposure in this population is environmental rather than occupational, these findings warrant further follow-up. 264 AFRICAN-AMERICAN ANGLERS* CULTURAL NOTIONS OF POLLUTION AND RISK: RESULTS FROM A FOCUS GROUP STUDY GREGORY BEEHLER, MCGUINNESS B, VENA J. Department of Social &amp; Preventive Medicine, University. EMail: gbeehler@acsu.buffalo.edu Concern has been raised regarding recreational anglers' awareness and com- pliance with volunteer risk reduction guidelines for sport fish from contam? inated waters. In particular, minority anglers have been suggested to be less aware and less compliant with these guidelines than non-minority anglers. To better understand risk perception regarding fishing practices, four focus groups were conducted in Western New York with African-American an? glers age 18 to 82. Both licensed and unlicensed anglers were sampled. Each group was composed of 7 to 13 participants of similar age and gender. The aim of this formal qualitative analysis was to develop a framework of concepts that identified sport fishing beliefs and behaviors of anglers' who fish in contaminated waters. Analysis revealed culturally-based notions of risk related to pollution and contaminated sport fish. Because participants' motivation for fishing was for several perceived beneficial effects such as stress reduction, risks associated with this activity were minimized. Knowl? edge which guided fishing practices did not actively incorporate fish advisory information even for anglers who were aware advisories existed. Anglers valued traditional knowledge gained from personal experience or by learning from other anglers. Though anglers considered local waters polluted, scien? tific concepts related to chronic exposure to persistent chemicals which could lead to adverse health outcomes were not present in their testimonies. Pollution was recognized and avoided either intuitively or based on empirical judgements via the senses. Polluted waters and polluted fish were actively avoided based on an angler's personal judgement of safety. Results suggest that current risk communication policy has failed to consider how preexist? ing culturally-based angler knowledge influences risk perception and risk reduction guideline compliance. Study results also point to new directions for education and intervention, including the use of focus groups in minority communities to heighten awareness of fish advisory guidelines. By better understanding how culture influences risk perception, the efficacy of future risk communication efforts may be enhanced. 266 DECREASED BONE LEAD ASSOCIATED WITH LACTATION M T?LLEZ-ROJO, HERNANDEZ-AVILA M, ROMIEU I, GONZALEZ- COSSIO T, HU H. Instituto Nacional de Salud Pubiica. EMail: mmtellez@insp3.insp.mx OBJECTIVE: We studied the relationship between intensity of breast feed? ing and bone lead levels among lactating women in Mexico City, where residents continue to have significant dietary lead exposure and also have high bone lead burden from years of environmental exposure. METHODS: We identified 1382 post partum women of whom 611 (44.2%) participated in the study. Umbilical cord and blood specimens were obtained at delivery. One and seven months (+/- 5d) postpartum, participants at? tended our research center for K-X-Ray Fluorescence (KXRF) measurements to determine tibia and patella lead levels. Maternal venous blood samples and updated questionnaire information including feeding practices, were obtained at delivery and at one, four and seven months postpartum. Blood- lead levels were analyzed using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spec- troscopy. The effect of breast feeding on bone-lead levels was determined by analysis of longitudinal data using Generalized Estimating Equations. The KXRF instrument used to estimate bone lead-levels provides a continuous unbiased point estimate that oscillates around the true bone-lead value; however, negative point estimates are sometimes produced when true bone- lead values are below the limit of detection (5ug-Pb/g mineral bone). We also reanalyzed our data replacing negative values by simulated data from a uniform distribution in the interval (0,5) RESULTS: After adjusting for blood-lead levels, proportion of life spent in Mexico City, maternal childhood practice of using lead-glazed ceramics and parity, we found that women who stopped lactating at any time during the follow up, tended to have significant higher patella lead levels (3.3 ug-Pb/g mineral bone 95% CI: 0.7, 5.9) than those women who were still lactating. When data were reanalyzed using the uniform distribution we observed that the change in patella lead levels was 3.3 (95% CI: 1.0, 5.5). We found no significant association with tibia lead levels. Parity and time spent in Mexico City were positively related with tibia and patella lead levels and these relationships were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there is an inverse relationship between intensity of breast-feeding and trabecular lead levels among women with a high bone lead burden. Multiparous and women with higher propor? tion of life spent in Mexico City, tend to have significantly higher bone lead levels.</page><page sequence="92">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S93 267 MORTALITY AMONG FEMALE NUCLEAR WEAPONS WORKERS GREGG WILKINSON, PRIORE ROGER, GRAHAM ROBIN, TRIEFF NORMAN, FRIES MICHAEL, JONES JENNIFER, YOUNG BRENDA, RAY LAURA, LOUGHLIN JEANNE. University at Buffalo. EMail: gwilkins@buffalo.edu Although a number of mortality studies of male nuclear workers have been completed, few have considered female employees. We estimated mortality among female workers who were first employed at 12 U.S. nuclear weapons facilities between 1943-1980. External comparisons compared deaths observed among facility-specific and all cohorts combined with deaths expected based on U.S. death rates for all female workers, radiation workers and nonradiation workers. Cox regression was used to investigate whether the relative risk for radiation sensitive cancers increased with increasing dose, and whether survival time differed between radiation and nonradiation workers. For most causes, fewer than expected deaths were observed for facility-specific cohorts and for the combined cohort. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were elevated for deaths from mental disorders, genito-urinary diseases and ill defined conditions. SMRs for workers who were not issued a radiation badge were elevated for mental disorders (SMR= 153,95%confidence interval (CI)=126-184), ill defined con? ditions (SMR=183, 95%CI=161-206) and suggestively elevated for homicide (SMR=119, 95%CI=93-151). SMRs for radiation workers were suggestively increased for mental disorders (SMR=141, 95%CI=88-216), but not for known radiogenic cancers. The relative risk (RR) per rem of cumulative pen- etrating radiation for the combined cohort was increased for leukemia other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RR=1.13, 95%CI= 1.02-1.25), and sug? gestively elevated for all cancers (RR=1.03, 95%CI=0.99-1.06), breast cancer (RR=1.05, 95%CI=0.99-1.12), and hematologic cancers (RR=1.08, 95%CI=0.99-1.17). Risk estimates were increased among Savannah River employees for all cancers (RR=1.13, 95%CI=1.04-1.23) and radiosensitive solid tumors (RR=1.16, 95%CI=1.04-L28), and among X-10 workers for hematologic cancers (RR=1.25, 95%CI=1.07-1.47) and leukemia (RR=1.32, 95%CI= 1.13-1.55). RR estimates for nonradiation compared with radiation workers were increased for all deaths, all cancers, lung cancer, and brain cancer. These findings suggest that a strong healthy worker effect exists among female nuclear workers, that health endpoints usually associated with radiation are not increased among the 12 combined cohorts, and that limited evidence exists of an overall dose-response association with cumulative penetrating dose. The increased mortality for mental disorders is unlikely due to radiation exposures. If this association is not spurious, it may evince a previously unrecognized public health need among female nuclear workers. 270 OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES AND K-RAS MUTATIONS IN EXOCRINE PANCREATIC CANCER MIQUELPORTA, ALGUACIL JUAN, MALATS NURIA, KAUPPINEN TIMO, KOGEVINAS M, BENAVIDES FERNANDO, PARTANEN TIMO, CARRATO ALFREDO, RIFA JULI, GUARNER LUISA, REAL FRANCISCO. IMIM / UAB / UPF (Barcelona), Hospital Vall d'Hebron. EMail: mporta@imim.es Pancreatic cancer is the human tumour with the highest prevalence at diagnosis of K-ras mutations. Whether this partly reflects environmental, clinical or other influences is yet unknown. Ras genes are critical DNA targets for chemical carcinogens. Wild-type (non-mutated) K-ras carcinomas of the pancreas may arise through a genetic pathway distinct from carcino? mas that harbour a K-ras mutation. A number of occupational exposures have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between past occupational exposures and mutations in the K-ras gene in exocrine pancreatic cancer. The study included 107 incident cases of exocrine pancreatic cancer from whom cytohistologic tumour material was analysed for K-ras mutations, and from whom occupational, life-style, and clinical information was available from personal interviews and medical records. Occupational exposure to 22 chemical agents and 4 physical factors was assessed with the Finnish job-exposure matrix (HNJEM). Exposures among K-ras mutated pancreatic cancer cases were compared to those of non-mutated cases (case-case analysis). Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence limits (CL) were computed by unconditional logistic regression. The risk of a K-ras mutated tumour was increased over 6-fold among workers exposed to aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents (OR 6.41, 95% CL 1.14 - 122), aromatic hydrocarbon solvents(7.37, 1.33 - 139), chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents (14-81, 3.35 - unq. high), other organic solvents, and gasoline. Patients with a K-ras mutation were also over more likely to have been exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (OR 5.47, 95% CL 0.92 - 107), PAHs, lead, chromium compounds, and gasoline engine exhaust. The magnitude and statistical significance of most estimates held after adjusting for potential confounders and after taking into account a 10-year latency time. Some solvents, gasoline, benzo[a]pyrene, PAHs, lead, and chromium com? pounds may be involved (directly or indirectly) in the pathogenesis of exocrine pancreatic cancer; mechanistic scenarios include pathways that affect the modulation of K-ras activation and the provision of a growth advantage to K-ras mutated cells. 268 BLOOD NUTRIENT LEVELS IN A CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF AN ARSENIC-EXPOSED POPULATION IN WEST BENGAL, IN? DIA IOYCE S. CHUNG, HAQUE R, MOORE L, SAMANTA S, GHOSH N, MITRA S, GUHA MAZUMDER D, SMITH AH. UC Berkeley. EMail: jochung@uclink4.berkeley.edu There is a large population in West Bengal, India currently exposed to high levels of arsenic naturally occurring in the ground water. Since effects of arsenic at low doses are unknown, a case-control study is being conducted to examine low-level exposure from the drinking water and nutritional suscep- tibilities in the development of arsenic-induced skin lesions. Blood samples have been obtained to evaluate the nutritional status of participants and determine if there are increased risks among those with lower levels of specific blood measurements. Preliminary analyses have been done on 158 participants (58 cases, 100 controls). Blood assays measured the following: glucose, cholesterol, transthyretin, amino acids and proteins associated with methylation (cysteine, homocysteine, methionine, glutathione), micronutri? ents and carotenoids (vitamin B12, vitamin B6, folate, selenium, retinol, alpha-tocopherol, lutein/zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, lycopene, beta-cryptox- anthin.) In this sample, most of the nutrient levels and biochemical indi? cators fall in the lower range of the U.S. population levels. The average concentrations in cases and controls were generally similar, but increased odds ratios were found for low values of some nutrients. An interesting finding was evidence of increased risks of skin lesions among those in the lowest quintile (&lt; 26 ug/dl) of serum beta-carotene (OR=2.98, 95% CI 1.33-6.64.). The preliminary assessment of this study do not suggest that nutritional factors play a major tole in the overall occurrence of arsenic- induced skin lesions. However, there is some evidence of increased risks in subsets of the population that fall in the low end of the distributions of certain micronutrients. 271 ARSENIC IN DRINKING WATER AND CANCER RISKS ESTI? MATED FROM EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN ARGENTINA, CHILE, TAIWAN AND JAPAN ALLAN SMITH, LOPIPERO P, CHUNG J, HAQUE R, HERNANDEZ A, MOORE L, STEINMAUS C. University of California, Berkeley. EMail: ahsmith@uclink4.berkeley.edu We calculated cancer risks from arsenic in drinking water based on studies in Taiwan nearly ten years ago and found that the risk of dying from cancer associated with drinking water containing 50 /u,g/L might be on the order of 1 in 100 exposed (Smith AH et al, Cancer risks from arsenic in drinking water. Environ Health Perspect 97:259-267, 1992). Since then, we have conducted studies in Argentina and Chile which provide additional causal evidence concerning cancers caused by arsenic in drinking water. These studies show that at high levels of arsenic in water (approximately 500 /utg/L) arsenic may eventually cause death due to cancer, mainly of the lung and bladder, in 1 in 10 persons exposed. In this paper we use results from these epidemiological studies to again estimate cancer risks extrapolated down to the current US arsenic drinking water standard of 50 /xg/L. Combining information from studies in four countries indicates that the risks of lung cancer alone associated with drinking water containing 50 /ng/L may be on the order of 1 inlOO. Combining cancer risks from each major site, including lung, bladder and skin, suggests that overall cancer risks would exceed 1 in 100. These high environmental cancer risks call for further epidemiological studies, especially of lung cancer, at lower exposures in the range of 50 to 100 /ig/L, a range in which increased lung cancer risks might be epidemiologi- cally detectable.</page><page sequence="93">S94 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 273 LIPID-MOBILISATION AND THE ROLE OF ORGANOCHLORINE COMPOUNDS IN THE ETIOLOGY OF PANCREATIC CANCER: A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT MIQUEL PORTA, MALATS NURIA, JARIOD MANUEL, GRIMALT JOAN, CARRATO ALFREDO, GUARNER LUISA, ALGUACIL JUAN, SANTIAGO-SILVA MARY, RIFA JULI, COROMINAS JOSEP, REAL FRANCISCO. IMIM / UAB / UPF (Barcelona), Hospital Vall d'Hebron. EMail: mporta@imim.es Because of its challenging biological, clinical and epidemiological features, pancreatic cancer provides an opportunity to think particularly in-depth about a new set of methodological and logistic issues that, to varying degrees, are also relevant for other human cancers in whose pathogenesis organochlorine and other environmental compounds are hypothesised to play a role. Our aim was to assess whether biochemical and clinicai variables potentially related to tumour-induced lipid mobilisation were associated with serum con? centrations of organochlorine compounds (OCs) in exocrine pancreatic cancer. Incident cases of exocrine pancreatic cancer were prospectively identified in 5 general hospitals. They were interviewed and had biological specimens (includ? ing blood) collected soon before diagnosis. The present analysis is based on 51 cases, along with 26 hospital controls recruited in one of the hospitals. Serum concentrations of OCs were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron-capture detection and negative ion chemical ionisation mass spectrometry. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence limits (CL) were computed by unconditional and by conditional logistic regression. Several methods were used to adjust by Total Lipids. Among cases, Spearman's correlation coefficients (r) between cholesterol, and Total PCBs and congeners 138, 153 and 180 were 0.37, 0.39, 0.36 and 0.42 (all P&lt;0.05); no strong correlation was apparent between PCBs and triglycerides. The reverse was true among controls. DDT and DDE were unrelated to lipids among cases (all r&lt;0.24), while r was 0.43 (P&lt;0.05) between DDE and cholesterol among controls. The percent of cases with detectable levels of any of the 5 previously mentioned OCs was not significantly associated with tumour stage at diagnosis, cachexia, or weight loss. There was no significant increasing trend in serum levels of OCs with increasing tumour stage, no matter whether values were crude or lipid-adjusted. Again, crude and lipid-adjusted OC levels were unrelated to cachexia and weight loss. If cancer cases are recruited promptly, it may be feasible to control some moderate types of bias induced by physiologic changes occurring around the time of diagnosis through specific indicators such as: signs, symptoms and clinical status at the time of blood extraction; cholesterol and triglycerides levels; other laboratory findings; tumor stage at diagnosis; diagnostic procedures; treatment type and timing; clinical complications; and survival. Before adopting qualitative criteria and quantitative standards their impact upon causal estima- tors should be assessed. 276 MORTALITY AMONG RESIDENTS OF THE THREE MILE IS? LAND ACCIDENT AREA: 1979-1995 EVELYN TALBOTT, YOUK A, MCHUGH K, ENGBERG R. University of Pittsburgh. EMail: eotl@pitt.edu Residents near the Three Mile Island (TMI) Plant on March 28, 1979 represent the largest US population exposed to low -level radioactivity released by an accident at a nuclear power plant. The University of Pitts? burgh, collaborating with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, reports on the mortality experience of the 32,135 members in this cohort from 1979-1995. Analyses of standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) using a local comparison population and relative risk (RR) regression modeling were performed to assess overall mortality and specific cancer risks by confounding factors and radiation related exposure variables. Total mortality was signif? icantly elevated for both men and women (SMR =108 and 115, respec? tively). All heart disease accounted for 41.7% of the 4638 total deaths and demonstrated elevated SMRs for heart disease of 113 and 126 for men and women. When controlling for confounders and radiation factors in the RR analysis, these elevations in heart disease were no longer evident. Overall cancer mortality was similar in this cohort compared to the local population (SMR=102, males; SMR=97, females). In the RR modeling there was a significant effect for all lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue in males in relation to natural background exposure (p=.02). However, no trend was noted (Rrs=1.00, 2.26, 0.93). A significant linear trend for female breast cancer risk in relation to increasing levels of TMI related likely gamma exposure seen in the 1992 update of this cohort (1.00, 1.76, 1.76, 2.42) was slightly attenuated for follow-up through 1995. RR estimates still remain highly elevated (1.00, 1.72, 1.66, 2.12). Although similar relationships have been noted in other investigations, emissions from the TMI incident were significantly lower than in other documented studies. Therefore, it is un? likely that this observed increase is entirely related to radiation exposure the day of the accident. The mortality surveillance of this cohort does not provide consistent evidence that radioactivity released during the TMI accident has a significant impact on the mortality experience of this cohort to date. However, continued follow-up of these people will provide a more comprehensive description of the morbidity and mortality experience of this cohort. 275 NON-HODGKINS LYMPHOMA, HODGKIN'S DISEASE AND PESTICIDE EXPOSURE:REGIONAL PUNAM PAHWA, MCDUFFIE HH, SPINELLI J, MCLAUGHLIN JR, DOSMAN JA, FINCHAM S, ROBSON D. University of Saskatchewan. EMail: pahwa@sask.usask.ca A database resulting from a population based case-control study conducted in four regions (six provinces) [Ontario; Quebec; Prairies (Manitoba; Saskatche? wan; Alberta); and British Columbia] was analyzed to determine whether there were any regional differences associated with pesticides exposure and the inci? dence of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), and Hodgkin's disease (HD). Exposure information was collected by mailed questionnaires on 517 men diagnosed with NHL; 316 men diagnosed with HD; and 1506 controls. A telephone interview was administered to those who initially reported exposure to pesticides of &gt;=10 hrs/yr and a 15% random sample of the remainder. Conditional logistic regression adjusted for age was used to investigate possible differences in the relative risk for (i) questionnaire based pesticide exposure of &gt; = 10 hrs/yr; (ii) questionnaire based occupational chemical (other than pes? ticides) exposure; and (iii) interview based major chemical classes of herbicides and insecticides among four regions. An interaction term (e.g. pesticide expo? sure and region) was added in the conditional logistic regression model to study the possible differences among regions, considering Ontario as a reference region. Results were presented in the form of odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Based on the mailed questionnaire information, potential predictors were fitted one at a time. Results were reported as (i) pesticide exposure of &gt; = 10 hrs/yr was significantly associated with NHL for prairies [1.39 (1.01-1.92]; (ii) a significant association was observed between chemical exposure and NHL for Quebec [1.43 (1.02- 2.02)] and for British Columbia [1.90 (1.37- 2.63)]; (iii) a significant association was observed be? tween exposure to diesel and NHL for British Columbia [2.32 (1.58-3.41)]. Based on telephone interview information, among major chemical classes of (i) herbicides, the risk of NHL was significantly associated with phenoxyherbicides [2.58 (1.44- 4.60)] and to dicamba [7.92 (2.82- 22.2)] for British Columbia; (ii) insecticides, the risk of NHL was significantly associated with organophospho? rous for British Columbia. [2.20 (4-97?11.26)]; to carbamate for Quebec [5.21 (1.51-18.06)] and for British Columbia [6.45 (1.65- 25.22)]. The risk of HD was significantly associated with organophosphorous for Prairies [1.88 (1.13-3.14)] and with glyphosate for British Columbia [3.96 (1.38-11.35)]. Even though the risk from pesticides and chemicals associated with NHL and HD varies among regions, it is apparent that in British Columbia subjects exposed to major chemical classes of herbicides and insecticides were at higher risk .

Uni? versity of Pittsburgh. EMail: eotl@pitt.edu Background: In 1986, widespread contamination of dairy products with hepta- chlor, heptachlor epoxide (HE) and other organochlorine pesticides (OCs) were discovered throughout Arkansas. Although this contamination occurred pri? marily in dairy cattle feed, the exposure of other farm animals to tainted feed was possible. This study explores the contribution of dietary fat, both animal and dairy, to breast milk OC levels in Arkansas women. Methods: The Arkansas Health Department conducted a cross-sectional study to obtain breast milk samples from women who had delivered a child in 1986 for determination of OC pesticide levels. A questionnaire was also administered at the time of sample collection that included dietary intake of dairy and meat products, duration of breast feeding, use of pesticides around the home, occupation, and reproductive/ medical history. A total of 837 women had demographic, dietary, and pesticide data available for analysis. Univariate Spearman correlations and multivariate forward selection regression models were conducted to evaluate the association of dietary fat with pesticide levels. Age, body mass index, weeks breast fed, and household pesticide spraying were included as covariates. Results: Women were an average of 27.8 years of age, 88% had a high school diploma, and 28.3% had an income of &gt;$25,000 per year. Only 14% currently smoked, and 24% of the women consumed alcoholic beverages. Half of the women resided in a high quarantined or exposed area. Significant positive correlations were noted be? tween and dietary fat consumption and breast milk organochlorine levels (p&lt;.05). Consumption of fat from eggs was positively correlated with HE. Ham and bacon fat intake was significantly correlated with p-Aldrin. Chicken and bacon fat consumption was correlated with p,p-DDE and oxychlordane levels. Conversely, whole milk fat intake was negatively correlated with p,p-DDE. Breast milk pesticide levels of HE, p-Aldrin, and p,p-DDE were significantly associated in the multivariate models with dietary fat intake. HE was predicted by weeks breast fed (negative) and egg consumption (p&lt;.001); p-Aldrin was predicted by ham ,age and spraying (negative) (p=.001); p,p-DDE was associ? ated with age, pork intake, weeks breast fed (negative) , chicken intake and 2% milk intake (negative) (p&lt;.001). Conclusions: Breast milk pesticide levels were significantly associated with dietary consumption of both dairy and animal fats in this exposed population. These findings may reflect possible cross contami? nation of animal feeds or other pesticide application processes in this highly agricultural environment.</page><page sequence="94">Epidemioloev Julv 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S95 279 GEOGRAPHIC VARIABILITY IN HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES AMONG THE ELDERLY IN THE UNITED STATES ROBERT MORRIS, MUNASINGHE RAJIKA, NAUMOVA ELENA. Tufts University School of Medicine. EMail: robert.morris@tufts.edu Background: The rates of infectious diseases vary widely between developed and less developed countries, but less attention is given to variation within developed countries. This paper focused on the geographic variation in hospitalizations for infectious disease in the United States. Design: All hospital admissions for respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, gas? troenteritis, septicemia, and cellulitis from the United States for a six year period (1984 through 1989) were identified using Medicare admissions records. Age, race, and sex standardized annual admission rates were calcu? lated for each county and spatial clustering of disease specific rates was evaluated using Moran's I statistic. Ecological analyses were conducted using multiple regression procedures with county-specific measures of average annual temperature, average income, household crowding, median educa? tional level, population density, physicians per capita, and hospital beds per capita together with surrogate measures of cigarette consumption and occu? pational exposures as predictor variables. Results: Admission rates in the elderly for all five categories of infectious disease showed dramatic and significant clustering (p&lt;.0001), particularly in the Appalachian and Southern Gulf states. Median education level, per capita income and household crowding were all associated with elevated admission rates. Surrogate measures of cigarette consumption were strongly associated with hospital admissions in all five disease groups. Hospital beds per capita demonstrated strong positive associations with admissions, but the number of physicians per capita exhibited consistent inverse relationships with hospital admissions. Conclusions: Admission rates for infectious diseases among the elderly show marked geographic variation. The heterogeneous nature of this geographic distribution provides strong evidence of regional differences in health care utilization and delivery, medical practice, and/or factors influencing the incidence and severity of infectious diseases in the elderly. Understanding which environmental exposures are involved in the relationship between SES and hospital admissions will help guide interventions to reduce mor? bidity. 282 CAN SEMMNDIVIDUAL STUDIES HAVE ECOLOGIC BIAS? TOM WEBSTER. Dept. Environmental Health, Boston University School. EMail: twebster@bu.edu Objectives: Semi-individual-level studies assign outcome and covariate val? ues to each subject but employ a group-level (ecologic) measure of exposure, e.g., air pollution measured at central air monitors. Are such studies subject to ecologic bias? Loomis et al. argued that "the biases stemming from the ecologic fallacy do not apply to these studies. Instead, these should be viewed as individual level studies in which exposure is measured with error." (Loomis D et al. (1999). Environ Health Perspect 107A392). Methods: For simplicity, I estimate risk differences using ordinary and weighted least squares. I analyze exposure measurement error via a general error model. Ecologic biases are examined using risk diagrams and bias magnification due to reduced exposure variance (Webster T, submitted to ISEE 2000). Results: When exposure is binary, non-differential misclassification of ex? posure within groups biases away from the null, just as in pure ecologic studies. Semi-individual studies are also subject to other biases observed in pure ecologic studies, e.g., confounding and effect modification by group. However, the magnitude of the bias depends on the reduction in exposure variance caused by grouping. Studies with continuous exposure variables will tend to have less bias than those with binary exposure. Conclusions: Semi-individual studies are individual with exposure measure? ment error, but this does not prevent at least some of the types of bias seen in ecologic studies. One explanation for this apparent paradox is that exposure measurement error in a semi-individual study is quite special, typically reducing exposure variance. However, the ecologic biases discussed here could be diminished or even absent in many semi-ecologic studies using continuous exposure measurements. 278 MORTALITY DISPLACEMENT DUE TO COLD TEMPERATURE IN LONDON BEN ARMSTRONG, WILKINSON PAUL, STEVENSON SIMON. london school of hygiene and tropical medicine. EMail: b.armstrong@lshtm.ac.uk BACKGROUND. It is well known that cold days are foilowed by days of high mortality. There is speculation that this association is due to deaths among very sick people being brought forward by a just few days, but this has not previously been systematically investigated. OBJECTIVES. To identify whether deaths due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with recent cold outside temperatures represent only short displace- ment. METHODS. Data comprised daily deaths from CVD (mean 77) in London from 1987 to 1997, along with daily measures of temperature and weekly influenza reports. We investigated the association of daily mortality with tem? perature using Poisson regression methods adapted for time series. We adjusted for influenza, and other seasonal and long term variation using a combination of Fourier (12) and cubic spline (7/year) terms. We investigated the extent to which the association of temperature with mortality reflected short and longer term displacement of deaths by lengthening the unit time intervals from which the association between deaths and explanatory variables was estimated - a simplified version of the method proposed by Schwartz (Am J Epidemiol 1999) to examine mortality displacement due to air pollution. RESULTS. The daily time series showed that after adjusting for all other identified explanatory variables, mortality was approximately linearly associated with maximum temperatures below 19 degrees. The effect was strongest the day following the cold day, but persisted in diminishing magnitude up to about three weeks. The total effect was well captured by a distributed lag model built from the daily maximum temperatures (degrees less than 19) over each of the three preceding weeks. The estimated effect of 1 degree lowering of temperature was 2.5%.(95% CI 2.0-2.9). On lengthening the time interval from one day to 9 weeks, this remained remarkably constant: 1 week:2.3( 1.8-2.8), 3 weeks 2.5%(1.8-3.2), 7 weeks 2.6%(0.5-4.7), 9 weeks 4.2%(-2.8-11.2), suggesting that the associated deaths were displaced by at least two months. About 12% of CVD deaths in London were displaced in this way. CONCLUSIONS. This evidence indicates that in London deaths associated with low temperatures were brought forward by several months at least, not just a few days. This analysis could not identify the extent to which displacement was longer than two months. This might be possible with less cautious modelling of season. The results nevertheless suggest that much of the seasonal variation of mortality, at least in London, is explained by temperature effects. 281 CHILDHOOD ASTHMA HOSPITALIZATION AND RESIDEN? TIAL EXPOSURE TO STATE ROUTE TRAFFIC SHAO LIN, MUNSIE JP, HWANG SA, FITZGERALD E, CAYO MR. NYSDOH. EMail: sxl05@health.state.ny.us Objective: To investigate whether pediatric hospitalization for asthma was associated with living near a road with heavy traffic. Methods: In this case-control study, the cases (N=417) consisted of white children aged 0-14 years who were admitted for asthma and who resided in Erie County, NY, excluding the city of Buffalo. The controls (N=461) were children in the same age range admitted during the same time period for non-respiratory diseases. The subjects* residential addresses were linked to traffic information provided by the New York State Department of Trans? portation. Results: After adjusting for age and poverty level, children hospitalized for asthma were more likely to live in the highest tertile of the Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) roads [odds ratio (OR): 1.94, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.14-3.29] and had an increased risk of having trucks and trailers passing by within 200 meters (OR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.04-1.98) compared to the controls. However, childhood asthma hospitalization was not signifi? cantly associated with residential distance from a state road, annual VMT within 500 meters, or whether trucks or trailers passed by within 500 meters. Conclusion: This study suggests that heavy traffic density within 200 meters of their residences may contribute to asthma hospitalization among suburban white children.</page><page sequence="95">S96 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 283 DENGUE-FEVER:SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SEASONAL? ITY MARCELO SOUSA TAVARES, SPECIAN APARECIDA ARACELI. Universidade Estadual de Londrina. EMail: marctav@uel.br Dengue-fever is re-emerging in developing countries. In Londrina, Southern Brazil, no case of this disease was recorded in 1997, but 15 in 1998 and 16 in 1999. An incidence rise of 2.81 cases/100,000 inhabitants to 3.69/100,000 was detected as well as a change in spatial distribution (East-West axis, compared to North-South). Positive serologies among suspected cases also increased (from 4.76 % in 1998 to 12.5 % in 1999). A higher incidence was observed in first semesters of both years (100 % in 1998 and 81.25 % in 1999). However, a correlation between number of cases and mean temper? ature, which in turn could influence the reproduction of mosquitos, the main vector of the disease, was not detected (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: the incidence of Dengue-fever is increasing in Londrina, South? ern Brazil. A seasonal pattern of the disease could be detected, probably related to environmental conditions. More data are necessary to analyse this event. 285 CHANGES IN SERUM PCB AND DDE CONCENTRATIONS OVER TIME IN RELATION TO FISH CONSUMPTION CHANGES GRACE TEE, SWEENEY ANNE, HUMPHREY H, GARDINER J, GASIOR D, SCHANTZ S. University of Texas Houston School of Public Health. EMail: gtee@sph.uth.tmc.edu Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlordiphenyltrichloroethane (DDE) are persistent environmental contaminants which have been sug? gested to cause adverse human health outcomes. The Michigan Department of Health established a cohort of 572 fisheaters and 419 nonfisheaters from the Great Lakes area during 1979-1982 to evaluate the effects of fish consumption patterns in relation to serum PCB and DDE concentrations. Data on demographics, fish consumption and medical history, and serum samples were obtained for all study participants during 1979-82 and 1989- 1991. In 1996, a subsample of 101 fisheaters and 78 nonfisheaters from the original Michigan cohort were selected from all participants over age 50 to evaluate neuropsychological and cognitive functioning in relation to serum PCB concentrations. Additional sera and exposure data were collected on this subset from 1993-1995. The present study evaluates these 179 partici? pants at the three time points in order to 1) characterize changes in total serum PCB and DDE concentrations over time and 2) examine whether changes in total serum PCB and DDE levels are associated with changes in fish consumption patterns. Overall, serum PCB and DDE concentrations have declined in fisheaters and nonfisheaters over time. Mean PCB concen? trations in 1980, 1990 and 1994 were 35.0 ppb, 25.15 ppb and 16.03 ppb in fisheaters and 9.20 ppb, 8.42 ppb and 6.18 ppb in nonfisheaters, respectively. Mean DDE levels in fisheaters were 50.37 ppb, 21.11 ppb and 15.92 ppb in 1980, 1990 and 1994, and 15.63 ppb, 10.21 ppb, and 7.40 ppb in nonfisheat? ers, respectively. The differences in serum contaminant levels between fisheaters and nonfisheaters are statistically significant at all time points (p&lt;0.001). This study will further assess the independent effects of changes in fish consumption on serum contaminant levels, controlling for confound? ing factors. 284 POLYCHLORINATED PHENOLS FROM EXPOSURE TO NEW CLOTHES WKARMAUS, OSIUS NADIA, KRUSE HERMANN, WITTEN JUTTA. Department of Epidemiology, Michigan State University. EMail: karmaus@msu.edu In the framework of human longitudinal biomonitoring in the environment ofa toxic waste incinerator in the Rhine-valley in Hessen, Germany in 1997, we investigated factors that explain the variation of chlorophenols (CPH) in urine samples of 339 children. Blood samples and 24-hour urine and samples were collected and questionnaires were gathered from parents of children (9-12 years) in three regions with different exposures. For the determination of CPH in urine we focused on children who participated also in phlebot- omy. The urine samples were spiked with internal standards, treated by acid hydrolysis, steam bath distillation and extraction. Tri-, tetra-, and penta- chlorinated phenols were determined by GC/ECD (detection limits in the range of 0.02 mg/1). Since we intended to use this sample as a comparison group for children exposed to ortho-nitroanisole after a major accident in a chemical plant in Frankfurt, Germany, we also collected detailed informa? tion of exposure to new clothes. The association of PCPH and exposure to clothes was analyzed by means of linear regression controlling for age, gender and blood concentration of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), gamma-hexachlo- rocyclohexane, PCBs and DDE. Concentration of CPHs were significantly higher in children who wear new clothes immediately before washing. The geometric mean with and without washing the clothes: e.g., TCP234: 0.2 mg/1 vs. 0.29 mg/1, TCP345: 0.43 mg/1 vs. 0.51 mg/1, TCP2345: 0.64 mg/1 vs. 0.78 mg/1. Surprisingly, direct uptake of CPH due to its occurrence in leather and textiles seem to be a major predictor of polychlorinated phenols con? centration in children. The results indicate the need to control and reduce exposure from clothes. 288 HUMAN EXPOSURE TO POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS IN MICHIGAN SPORT CAUGHT FISH: VALIDATION OF SELF-RE? PORTED EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT ANDREW MULLARD, KARMAUS W, WIRTH J. Michigan State Uni? versity, Department of Epidemiology. EMail: mullarda@msu.edu Human exposure assessments of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) via con? sumption of sport caught fish (SCF) have shown increasing sophistication in determining factors explaining human exposure. Using the Michigan De? partment of Environmental Quality fish tissue concentration total PCB (FTC-PCB) monitoring data set (n=5788) collected from Michigan waters from 1980-1997, we present a modified fish-PCB formula. In an attempt to improve assessment of available dose we use multivariate linear regression of log FTC-PCB modeled on species, location, specimen adjusted weight, and collection year. The model explains 65% of the variance of FTC-PCB. Species contributed 33%, sampling location contributed 27%, specimen adjusted weight con? tributed 4%, and collection year contributed 0.5%. Adjusted geometric means reveal a 63 fold higher FTC-PCB level between highest and lowest species, and 122 fold higher contaminate level between highest and lowest fishing location sampled. We compare exposure scenarios for commonly consumed species at popular locations. These data suggest that for Michigan waters location is as important as species for prediction of potential intake of PCB. Thus location should be considered in FTC-PCB exposure assessments. We present a validation for a Revised Fish PCB Index using data on self-reported lifetime fish consumption (by year, species, and location) and lipid adjusted serum total PCBs for a cohort of 100 females from the Michigan Fisheaters Family Health Project. Analysis will determine whether location makes a statistically significant and practical contribution toward prediction of human PCB serum level.</page><page sequence="96">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S97 289 ANALYSIS OF THE AIR POLUTION HEALTH EFFECTS AC?

Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: abraga@hsph.harvard.edu In order to evaluate the response of different age groups of children and adolescents to air pollution exposure, records of respiratory admissions in 114 hospitals of Sao Paulo, Brazil, for five different age groups (0 - 2 years, 3 - 5 years, 6-13 years, and 14-19 years) were obtained for the period 1993 through 1997. Daily counts of asthma or bronchiolitis (wheeze) and pneu? monia or bronchopneumonia (pneumonia) admissions were compared to daily levels of air pollution (PM10, 03, S02, CO, and N02). Poisson regression (generalized additive models) were fitted adjusting with nonpara? metric smoothers for time trend, minimum temperature, relative humidity, and day of the week, and with indicators for holidays. Increased admissions were associated with air pollution on the same day and up to six days prior and the 7-day cumulative effect were estimated using unrestricted polyno? mial distributed lag models. An increase in seven-day mean PM10 (10ug/ m3) was positively associated with increased wheeze admissions among all children (0-19 years: 2.1 % +- 0.8 %) and specifically in 3 age groups (0-2 years: 2.6 % +- 1.0 %; 6-13 years: 2.2 % +- 2.0%; 14-19 years: 1.6 % +- 2.2 %). S02 and CO increases were also associated with wheeze admissions. Similarly for pneumonia admissions, there was an effect for all children (2.6 % +- 0.4%), and the extreme age groups presented the highest response to increases in PM10 (0-2 years: 3,0 % +- 0.5 %; 14-19 years: 3.3 % +- 2.4 %). S02 and CO presented less consistent associations. These results show that the exposure to air pollutants may promote responses with different intensity according to different children and adolescent age groups. These differences could be modulated by particularities in the immune system response or due to variations on the intensity of exposure to environmental agents.

EMail: Ken-LCDC-Johnson@HC-SC.gov.ca We evaluated the relationship between living near industrial plants and the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using population-based, case-control data from eight of the ten Canadian provinces. The analysis included 717 female and 782 male patients with newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 5,033 population control subjects who com? pleted a mailed questionnaire including standard cancer risk factor informa? tion and a lifetime residential history. Residential proximity to seven major types of heavy industry between 1960 and the early 1990's was established by linking the residential histories to a database of historic Canadian industrial plant locations. Overall, living within .8 kilometers (1/2 mile) (71 cases, 194 controls) or within 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) (473 cases, 1,434 controls) of an industrial plant was not associated with increased non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk (respective odds ratios (OR) 1.16(95% CI 0.87-1.54) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.96-1.25)). For the follicular histological sub-type of non-Hodgkin's lym? phoma an odds ratio of 1.44 (95% CI 0.1.07-1.94) was observed for women who had lived within 3.2 kilometers (83 cases/148 controls), and the test for trend years of close proximity was statistically significant (p=.03). No increase in risk was observed for men for the follicular subtype. Odds ratios for NHL were elevated for proximity to copper smelters OR 5.13 (95% CI 1.49-17.7) but based on small numbers (7 cases and 4 controls within 3.2 kilometers). Odds ratios for proximity within 0.8 kilometers of sulfite pulp mills were also elevated (OR 3.71 (95% CI 1.46-9.42) (9 cases, 10 controls). This analysis suggests the possibility that residential proximity to some industries may increase non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk, but replication in other proximity studies would be needed to determine whether the associ? ations are meaningful or by chance. 290 PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS FOR ASTHMA AND OTHER ALLERGIC DISEASES IN SCHOOL CHILDREN IN JUAREZ CITY, CHIHUAHUA. ALBINO BARRAZA, SANIN L, ROMIEU I, TELLEZ-ROJO M, LACASANA M. Universidad Autonoma de Chihuahua. EMail: iromieu@insp3.insp.mx The prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases was determined in a random sample of school children (n=6,174), aged 6-8 years and 11-14 years residing in Juarez City, Chih, an important border city in Mexico. The methodology used was the one suggested by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) to determine the prevalence and severity of asthma, rhinitis and eczema. Parents were asked to fill out a standardized questionnaire on current and accumulated prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema. The questionnaire included information re? garding risk factors. Logistic Regression was used for statistical analyses. The accumulated prevalence of medically diagnosed asthma and wheezing all ages combined were 6.8%(6.2-7.4) and 20%(19.7-21.8), respectively. The prevalence of wheezing in the last 12 months was higher in children aged 6-8 years than those aged 11-14 years (9.7% vs 5.8 %; p&lt;0.001). The prevalence of medically diagnosed rhinitis all ages combined was 5.0 % (4.5-5.6). The prevalence of symptoms of rhinitis in the last 12 months was 28.8% (6-8 years) and 29.0 %(11-14 years). The prevalence of medically diagnosed eczema all ages combined was 4.1% (3.6-4.6). The prevalence of eczema symptoms in the last 12 months was 12.7%(6-8 years) and 13.3%(11?14 years). Severe symptoms of asthma were significantly higher in the 6-8 years group and during the autumn months. Predictors were related to familiar and personal history and indoor factors. The prevalence of medically diagnosed and symptomatic asthma was relatively low in compar? ison with those observed in various international studies that used a similar methodology but similar to results from studies conducted in other Mexican cities. 292 RISK ASSESSMENT OF LEAD POISONING IN THE SMELTER'S ADJOINING AREA IN CIUDAD JUAREZ; CHIH: MEXICO. DAVID REYES, SANIN L, ROMIEU I, DlAZ-BARRIGA F, ORNELAS- HICKS M, LACASANA M. Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez. EMail: iromieu@insp3.insp.mx We carried out an assessment of the residual risk of lead poisoning in the area close to the ASARCO smelting plant in Anapra where remediation oc? curred in 1973, and determined major predictors of blood lead levels in mothers and children. A stratification of the zone was done according to the distance from the smelter. In each of the three strata, a random sample of mothers in reproductive age and their 1 to 5 year old children was selected (n=50). In addition 150 children were randomly selected in the school of the area. Samples of capillary blood were obtained from the mother-children binomials, and analyzed with a portable voltammeter (lead care) with a strict quality control. In each of the sampled households, samples of soil, paint, dust and water were taken for later analysis through anodic voltammetry. Socio-demographic and nutritional data were collected by interviewers when visiting the households. Doses of lead exposure were calculated according to the EPA's risk assessment methodology. Predictive models were made with simple and multiple linear regression. A total of 200 children were exam? ined. Their blood lead levels ranged from 3.5 - 23.6 /ig/dL with an arithmetic mean of 7.35 /ig/dL (s ? 3.50), and a percentage of 30% = 10 /xg/dL. Blood lead levels were inversely related to the distance to the smelter. Global mean of maternal lead (n=50) was 4.22 /xg/dL (s ? 2.19). Superficial soil samples showed lead levels ranging from 32 to 138 ppm. Major predictors of blood lead levels in children were related to lead exposure to soil through playing activities. Based on our model, we estimated that soil represents 60% of the lead exposure sources, especially for small children, although values were lower than those established by the EPA to take remedial measures. Results suggest residual contamination in the zone adjoining the smelter. Even though environmental intervention may not be indicated, educative mea? sures are necessary.</page><page sequence="97">S98 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 293 BIAS MAGNIFICATION IN ECOLOGIC STUDIES TOM WEBSTER. Dept. Environmental Health, Boston University School. EMail: twebster@bu.edu Objectives: Textbook discussions of ecologic bias tend to be qualitative rather than quantitative. How does the amount of bias in ecologic studies compare with individual-level studies in simple situations? Methods: For simplicity, I estimate risk differences using population weighted least squares. I combine the approaches of Piantadosi et al (parti- tioning variance and covariance within and between groups), Greenland and Morgenstern (confounding and effect modification as sources of ecologic bias), and King and Palmquist. Results: Suppose risk is a linear function of exposure and there is no confounding within groups or effect modification. Confounding cannot then occur in the ecologic analysis unless it occurs in the crude individual-level data. Furthermore, the ecologic bias-due to confounding by group-equals the individual-level bias multiplied by a magnification factor: var[x]/var[X]. Since exposure variance on the individual-level (var[x]) usually exceeds exposure variance on the group level (var[X]), the magnification factor is usually greater than one, sometimes much greater (See Ref. 3 for a closely related concept). The magnification factor depends on the exposure distri? bution within groups. Given the same between group exposure variance, the magnification factor is larger for studies with binary exposure than studies with a continuous exposure variable. If there is no exposure variation within groups, the magnification factor equals one, i.e., the ecologic bias equals the individual-level bias. Similarly, ecologic bias due to effect modification (of the risk difference) between groups equals the magnification factor times the difference between the crude individual estimate and a weighted sum of the within-group estimates. Conclusions: The reduction in exposure variance caused by aggregation magnifies the bias due to group-level confounding or effect modification. Other things held constant, ecologic studies with continuous exposure variables will have less bias than those with binary exposure. 1. Piantadosi S, Byar DP, Green SB (1988).

Harvard University. EMail: howard.hu@channing.harvard.edu Recent research has indicated that a polymorphic variant of delta-aminole- vulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) may influence an individual's level of lead in bone and blood and, as a result, may also influence an individual's susceptibility to lead toxicity. In this study, we investigated whether this ALAD polymorphism is associated with altered levels of lead in bone and blood among 726 middle-aged and elderly men who had community (non- occupational) exposures to lead. Blood and bone lead levels were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy and a K-x-ray fluores? cence (KXRF) instrument, respectively. The ALAD Mspl polymorphism in exon 4 was determined by a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Of the 726 subjects, 7 (1%) and 111 (15%) were homozygous and heterozygous for the variant allele respectively. The mean (SD) of blood lead (&amp;#61549;g/dL), cortical bone (tibia), lead (&amp;#61549;g/g), and trabecular bone (patella) lead (&amp;#61549;g/g) were 6.2 (4.1), 22.1 (13.5), and 31.9 (19.5) in subjects who did not have the variant allele (ALAD 1-1), and 5.7 (4.2), 21.2 (10.9) and 30.4 (17.2) in the combined subjects who were either heterozygous or homozygous for the variant allele (ALAD 1-2, and ALAD 2-2). In multivariate linear regression models that controlled for age, education, smoking, alcohol ingestion, and vitamin D intake, the ALAD 1-1 genotype was associated with cortical bone lead levels that were 2.55 &amp;#61549;g/g (95% 0:0.05 - 5.05) higher than those of the variant allele carriers. No significant differences were seen by genotype with respect to lead levels in trabecular bone or blood. In stratified analyses and a multivariate regression model that tested for interaction, the relationship of trabecular bone lead to blood lead appeared to be significantly modified by ALAD genotype, with variant allele carriers having higher blood lead levels, but only when trabecular bone lead levels exceeded 60 mcg/g. These results suggest that ALAD genotype modifies lead kinetics by decreasing lead uptake into cortical bone and increasing the mobilization of lead from trabecular bone. 294 INCORPORATING KINETIC PRINCIPLES AND ELUCIDATING KINETIC PARAMETERS IN EPIDEMIOLOGICALLY-DRIVEN EX? POSURE ASSESSMENT TOM KOSATSKY, PRZYBYSZ R, ARMSTRONG B, KEARNEY J. Mon? treal Department of Public Health. EMail: tkosatsk@santepub-mtl.qc.ca Exposure studies commonly relate biomarker measures to the joint distribu? tion of human behaviours and environmental contaminant loads. These studies incorporate, either openly or implicitly, notions of how the target contaminant is absorbed, transformed, and eliminated following human contact. In our analysis of (methyl)mercury burdens among 132 urban sportfishers, we related demographic and behavioural characteristics to mea? sured blood mercury concentrations. In multiple regression models, frequent consumption of local fish species having higher levels of mercury, was associated with elevated blood mercury measurements. After adjustment for demographic and frequency-of-consumption parameters, we found that fish? ers tested at the end of the 6-month open-water season had mean blood mercury concentrations 1.4 times (95% CI=1.1-1.8) higher than fishers tested following the shorter 10-week ice-fishery: this finding is consistent with a blood mercury half-life described as 50-60 days, where first-order kinetics predicts that while winter fishers best fit the zone of rising blood mercury, open-water fishers should have attained steady-state. Our finding that, after adjustment for consumption frequency, blood mercury rises with age is both novel and of impact for risk assessment. While fishers of 20-34 years had an (adjusted) geometric mean blood mercury of 2.1 jU-g/L (95% CI= 1.6-2.8) those age &amp;#61619;65 years averaged 3.3 fig/l (95%CI=2.2- 4.8). The paucity of experimental subjects overall and a particular lack of older testees, may explain why historical assessments of the half-life of (methyl)mercury did not demonstrate the age-dependancy of it's elimina? tion. In contrast, our reanalysis of two additional epidemiologic studies of blood mercury in fish eaters also supports our finding that (methyl)mercury elimination is age-dependent. This work demonstrates the value of making kinetics an explicit component of exposure assessment. 297 CAN WE OVERCOME THE BIAS IN CASE-CROSSOVER ANALY? SES OF ENVIRONMENTAL TIME SERIES? THOMAS BATESON, SCHWARTZ J. Harvard Enviromental Epidemiol? ogy. EMail: tbateson@hsph.harvard.edu The case-crossover design represents an attractive approach to examine the impact of time varying exposures that may be triggers of adverse health events. It has recently been applied to examine the effects of air pollution on daily deaths. Questions have been raised about the choice of control periods that suggest that it is more difficult than initially expected to choose control periods that avoid bias and seasonal confounding. We have investigated the sensitivity of the case-crossover approach to the choice of control periods using both real and simulated data that include seasonal and sub-seasonal patterns in the exposure and response measures. Following up on the work of Navidi (1998) and of Bateson and Schwartz (1999), we have identified three specific sources of bias relating to the interaction of the choice of controls with patterns in the exposure and response. We offer some limited recom? mendations for identifying potential bias and possibilities for minimizing it. We used the symmetric bi-directional case-crossover approach and simulated data with simple trigonometric patterns to show that when the patterns in the exposure and response are the same and in phase, bias is generated that is a predictable function of the trigonometric patterns and the distance in time between the hazard day and the control days. Even when the patterns are different but close, which implies no confounding, bias is generated that is a predictable function ofthe patterns in exposure and response, and the lag between the hazard day and the control days. This bias is inversely propor? tional to the length ofthe time series. The third bias is generated by patterns in the exposure alone and is inversely proportional to the length of the time series. We estimated the size of this bias using 6 years of real PMIO data from Chicago. We imposed a null effect by fixing the response variable at a constant. The regression coefficients should have been zero since exposure and outcome were independent, but we found that this bias generated regression coefficients that ranged from +0.011 to -0.067 for the 22 lag lengths between 7 and 28 days. Air pollution studies often report Relative Risk estimates below 1.10. These effects are on the same order as the exposure bias which can be generated by naive case-crossover analyses. This last bias, due solely to patterns in the exposure, can easily be estimated and removed.</page><page sequence="98">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S99 298 UNFILTERED DRINKING WATER TURBIDITY AND GASTRO? INTESTINAL ILLNESS IN SEATTLE'S ELDERLY THOMAS BATESON, LEVIN RONNIE, KOENIG J, SCHWARTZ J. Harvard Enviromental Epidemiology. EMail: tbateson@hsph.harvard.edu Turbidity is a measure of the cloudiness of water and is used as a proxy for the risk of microbial contamination in drinking water. Several documented waterborne disease outbreaks have been associated with elevated turbidity levels. Waterborne pathogens may also contribute to the "endemic" level of gastrointestinal (GI) illness in the general population. This study investi- gates the potential association between daily-maximum turbidity of unfil- tered drinking water from a pristine source and daily fluctuations in GI illness among Seattle's elderly population. We obtained MEDICARE records for both physician visits ('91-'94) and hospital admissions ('90-'94). Anal? yses were conducted using Poisson regression analyses controlling for time trends, seasonal patterns, day-of-the-week, and temperature. Separate anal? yses were conducted for each outcome, two age groups (65-79, 80+), and for each of two six-month "seasons". We found that, among those aged 80 years and older, a three day moving average of summertime daily-maximum turbidity 5 to 7 days prior was associated with an increased risk of a physician visit, with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in turbidity being associated with a 7% increase in risk of a physician visit (95% CI 0%, 15%). Among the same group, we found that wintertime daily-maximum turbidity 7 to 9 days prior was associated with a 4% increase in risk of a physician visit (95% CI 0%, 7%). We also found that among those aged 80 years and older, a three day moving average of summertime daily-maximum turbidity 10 to 12 days prior was associated with an increased risk of hospital admission, with an IQR increase in turbidity being associated with a 34% increase in risk of a hospital admission (95% CI 0%, 80%). Among the same group, we found that wintertime daily-maximum turbidity 12 to 14 days prior was associated with a 13% increase in risk of a hospital admission (95% CI -3%, 31%). No association was seen for subjects below age 80. Our findings indicate that drinking water, which met EPA's Surface Treat? ment Rule for unfiltered water throughout the study period, was associated with a significant level of GI illness. 300 PREVALENCE OF RESPIRATORY DISORDERS DECREASED ALONG WITH A DECLINE OF AMBIENT PARTICLE CONCEN? TRATION IOACHIM HEINRICH, HOELSCHER B, FRYE C, MEYER I, PITZ M, WICHMANN H. GSF-Institute of Epidemiology. EMail: Joachim.Heinrich@gsf.de Objective: Ambient pollutants related to combustion of surface coal tremen- dously declined in East Germany after German re-unification. Therefore, time trends of the prevalence of respiratory disorders were investigated with decreasing exposure to ambient particulates in Eastern German children. Methods: Three areas within Sachsen-Anhalt were selected: Zerbst (Z), Bitterfeld (B), Hettstedt (H). While the areas of Bitterfeld and Hettstedt experienced high concentrations of ambient particulates until 1990, the area of Zerbst served as a control area. Children aged 5 to 14 years were examined in three identical cross-sectional surveys in 1992-93 (S I), 1995-96 (S II), and 1998-99 (S III). Ambient particulates were measured as TSP by beta attenuation. Results: Within each of the two first surveys a gradient of increasing prevalence of bronchitis, frequent cough in the morning and frequent infectious diseases was found with increasing area specific annual means of TSP. The third survey in 1999 did not show these associations consistently for all health outcomes. Between the first and third survey the prevalence of respiratory disorders decreased in all three areas concurrent with the decline of TSP. In parallel to a stronger decline of the annual mean TSP between survey I and II compared with the slightly further decline between survey II and III, a strong improvement of respiratory health was found between survey I and II, whereas respiratory health between survey II and III im? proved Only marginally. The strongest positive effect of respiratory health parameters was found for children living in the most polluted area of Hettstedt. Conclusion: The prevalence of non-asthmatic respiratory symptoms and diseases was higher in children living in more polluted communities espe? cially with respect to TSP and suggests that disease occurrence may be reduced by improvement of the air quality within a short period. 299 EVALUATION OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE DUE TO ENVIRON? MENTAL FACTORS ANTA ZUR NIEDEN, HERR CAROLINE, MANN MARION, BOEDE- KER ROLF-HASSO, ALBRECHT ANDREAS, EIKMANN THOMAS, GIELER UWE. Institute for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine,. EMail: Anja.zur.Nieden@hygiene.med.uni-giessen.de Quality of life is a criterion for the assessment of outcome in clinical studies. It can also be used to evaluate the impact of environmental factors on the population but is seldomly applied in epidemiological studies. The SF-36 Health Survey (Ware 1994) is an internationally accepted standard in generic instru? ments measuring general aspects of the quality of life. It was applied in an environmental study concerning aircraft-noise in Germany (Bullinger 1997). It was the aim of the presented cross-sectional study concerning the public health relevance of composting facilities to evaluate the perceived health of the population around these sites. In the vicinity of three sites the nearest residents (An, Bn, Cn) and three distant corresponding groups (Ad, Bd, Cd) -979 persons altogether- were studied. Part of the assessment was to apply the SF-36 ques? tionnaire. In addition environmental health questionnaires were administered and the respondents reported their annoyance due to odors of the facility. Exposure to microorganisms (total microorganisms, total fungi and thermophilic actinomycetes) was measured in the residential area around each site. Around one site (An) up to 106 cfu/m3 (total microorganisms, thermophilic actinomy? cetes) were found in the residential air and 80% of the population complained about odors. Around other two sites bioaerosols were only found in normal -upwind- concentrations in the residential air and 88% (Bn) respectively 41% (Cn) complained about odors. The evaluation of SF-36 was done for physical and mental score. Only the physical score showed differences when the whole group living near a site (N total near= 463) was compared with the whole distant (N total dist.= 291) group (median total near =51.2; total dist. =52.2). Looking at the three sites separately only comparison of An with Ad showed differences for both physical (median An= 49.4; Ad= 53.6) and mental score (median An= 51.4; Ad= 52.4). The SF-36 indicated differences in general aspects of quality of life for residents living close to facilities. In further analysis these differences remained clear only for the residents exposed to relevant amounts of bioaerosols in the residential air in Anear. Reporting bias due to odor annoyance cannot explain these results, because, no differences in quality of life were found where odor annoyance was regularly reported but relevant amounts of bioaerosols were not measured (B and C). These results coincide with those of a questionnaire applied to assess somatisations (SOMS 2, Rief et al. 1992). 301 OCCUPATIONAL CHEMICAL HAZARDS SURVEY PERNG-TY TSAI, YEH WEN-YU, CHANG CHING-WEN, LIN MING- HISU. Dept. of Environmental and Occupational Health. EMail: pj tsai@mail.ncku.edu.tw This study is set out to establish an occupational chemical-agent-based exposure intensity predictive model [OCEIPM] to further analyze field survey data obtained from the "Occupational Chemical Hazards Survey Program" conducted during the period from August 1996 to May 1999 in Taiwan area. Due to the lack of personal exposure data, the development of OCEIPM is merely based on the available field survey data, including types of chemical agents, exposure duration, the effectiveness of the health and safety management, and the efficiency of engineering control methods. The OCEIPM is designated to classify the exposure intensity of each studied industry site, however, the model can be regarded as a semi-quantitative model at best. The results found in this study will be serverd as a basis to help governmental agencies to initiate their own health and safety policies. The exposure intensity predicted by OCEIPM is presented as the Exposure Hazard Index (EHI). Here, the EHI encompasses the combination effect of three indices, including the Toxicity Index (Tl), Exposure Index (EI), and Protection Deficiency Index (PDI). The proposed EHI model was further examined and modified by using the expert evaluating system via the use of field survey data obtained from 7 plants, including 20 experts with extensive experiences in the industrial hygiene field. The result indicates that the modified EHI model does show consistent results to those assessed by 20 experts on the tested survey data. It is concluded that although the EHI model can effectively classify the health-hazard intensity of studied indus? tries, the model is still required further comfirmation by testing against personal exposure data.</page><page sequence="99">S100 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 302 PREVALENCE OF RESPIRATORY DISORDERS DECREASED ALONG WITH A DECLINE OF AMBIENT PARTICLE CONCEN?

EMail: pjtsai@mail.ncku.edu.tw This 3-year(1996/8 to 1999/5 )Occupational Chemical Hazards Survey Pro? gram in Taiwan is aimed at establishing* a national-wide chemical exposure data bank, in order to help both governmental agencies to initiate their own safety and health policies, and industries to plan their own occupational exposure abatement programs. All field data are used to estimate the Expo? sure Hazard Index ( EHI) and Exposure Hazard Rating ( EHR ) in order to evaluate the exposure hazard potentials and exposure hazard severities of all investigated industries. Results show that 2,402 chemical-containing mate? rials are being used in the 2,962 investigated companies from 119 industries. Among them 842 materials are found containing hazardous chemical agents, in which 105 species of hazardous chemicals are involved. The averaged EHI and EHR for the investigated 119 industries are 12.12 and 96, respectively. The highest EHI(=51.36) and EHR(=854.00) are found in the data pro? cessing and storaging equipment manufacturing industry and oil refinery industry, respectively. By taking both EHI and EHR into account, this study suggests that governmental agencies should pay more attention on the oil refinery industry, data processing and storaging equipment manufacturing industry, and paints and related products manufacturing industry. 307 BLOOD LEAD LEVELS AND CALCIUM INTAKE IN MEXICO CITY CHILDREN UNDER FIVE YEARS OF AGE LACASA1SIA MARINA, ROMIEU I, SANlN-AGUIRRE L, PALAZU- ELOS-RENDON E, HERNANDEZ-AVILA M. Instituto Nacional de Salud Piiblica. EMail: mlacasan@insp3.insp.mx Objective: The relationship between daily calcium intake and blood lead levels was evaluated among children under five years of age living in Mexico City. Methods: We selected a random sample of 200 children under five years of age, resident in two neighborhoods of Mexico City: Xalostoc, an industrial neighborhood, and Tlalpan, a residential neighborhood (100 from each area). The mothers of these children filled out a questionnaire on predictors of blood lead levels including daily calcium intake. Lead levels were deter? mined from the venous blood samples. Calcium intake was assessed using a short Food Frequency Questionnaire including 11 food items that accounted for 95% of calcium intake in Mexico. Results: The average blood lead level was 9.93 ug/dl (range 1-31 ug/dl). An inverse relationship was observed between blood lead levels and daily calcium intake. This relationship was statistically significant among children aged 13 months to 5 years. Conclusion: Our results suggest that calcium provided a protective effect against lead accumulation in the body among children. Further studies should be undertaken to evaluate this hypothesis through experimental design. 305 PAIRED CITY STUDIES OF WATERBORNE CRYPTOSPO? RIDIUM FLOYD FROST, KUNDE T, CALDERON REBECCA, CRAUN G, MUL- LER T. Lovelace Clinic Foundation. EMail: frrost@lrri.org Cryptosporidium oocysts, occasionally found in surface-derived drinking water, have uncertain public health implications. We conducted two sero- logical studies of blood donors in pairs of United States Midwest cities with different source of drinking water (surface versus ground). Serological re? sponses to two Cryptosporidium antigen groups were measured initially and at 3-9 month follow-up periods. Risk factor data were collected and related to serological responses. The first study found higher baseline serological responses among donors from the surface water city (38% vs 14%, RR=2.63 [1.78,3.91]) and higher rates of seroconversion (38% vs 18%,RR=2.07 [1.31,3.25]) over a 9 month period of time. The second study also found higher baseline serological responses among donors from a city using surface- derived drinking water (p&lt;0.05). These studies suggest that users of surface- derived drinking water in the United States Midwest may be at higher risk of Cryptosporidium infection. However, we did not detect evidence of illness associated with seroconversion nor did we observe higher rates of illness among donors from the city using surface-derived drinking water. 309 ANTIOXIDANT SUPPLEMENTATION AND RESPIRATORY HEALTH AMONG ASTHMATIC CHILDREN RESIDENT OF MEX? ICO CITY I ROMIEU, SIENRA-MONGE J, REYES N, RAMIREZ M, LACASAftA M, HERNANDEZ M. Pan American Health Organization. EMail: iromieu@insp3. insp.mx Ozone exposure has been related to adverse respiratory effects including increases airway inflammation, respiratory symptoms, and decrement in lung functions. Antioxidant vitamins are free-radical scavengers and could have a protective effect against photo-oxidant exposure. To evaluate whether acute effects of ozone on the respiratory health of childhood asthma could be attenuated by antioxidant vitamin supplementation, we conducted a ran? domized trial using a double-blind design. Moderate to severe asthmatic children (4 groups of 40 children) were randomly assigned to take daily a supplement (vitamin E 50 mg/day, vitamin C 250 mg/day) or a placebo and were foilowed during 12 weeks over a 1 year period. Pulmonary function tests were done twice a week, and daily respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow rate were recorded. In addition blood samples and nasal lavage were obtained to measure antioxidant levels as well as inflammatory markers and markers of lipid peroxidation. Air pollution exposure was determined using the monitoring network of Mexico City, as well as repeated personal expo? sure assessments using portable monitoring devices. We are currently com- pleting the follow-up ofthe last group of 40 children. Results of this trial will provide some incite on the health benefits gain by increasing the intake of antioxidant in susceptible children populations exposed to high levels of ozone and other air pollutants.</page><page sequence="100">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S101 311 RISK ASSESSMENT OF LEAD POISONING IN THE AVALOS, CHIHUAHUA SMELTER'S ADJOINING AREA. MARGARITA ORNELAS, SANIN L, ROMIEU I, DlAZ-BARRIGA F, REZA S. Secretarfa de Salud del Estado de Chihuahua. EMail: iromieu@insp3. insp. mx We carried out an assessment of the residual risk of lead poisoning five years after the dosing of the world's largest smelting plant, establishing predictors of lead levels in blood in mothers and children. This plant operated for nearly 90 years in this area, without any previous evaluation. A stratification of the zone was done according to the distance from the smelter. In each of the three strata a random sample of mothers in reproductive age and their 1 to 5 year old children was selected; samples of capillary blood were taken from the mother and children, analyzing them with voltammeter, using a portable device (lead care) with a strict quality control. In each of the sampled households, samples of soil, paint, dust and water were taken for later analysis through anodic voltammetry. There were also samples of capillary blood taken from children younger than 6 years old in the selected preschools for each strata, and environmental samples taken in each school. Socio-demographic and nutritional data were collected when the samples were taken. Doses were calculated according to the EPA's risk assessment methodology. Predictive models were made with simple and multiple linear regression. A total of 197 children were examined. Their blood lead levels ranged from 3.0 to 59.0 fig/dL with an arithmetic mean of 11.45 /ug/dL (s ? 8.72), and a percentage of 40% = 10 /ug/dL and 20% &gt;20 /xg/dL. Blood lead levels were inversely related to the distance from the smelter. Global mean of maternal lead (n=50) was 5.22 /xg/dL (s ? 3.36). Lead concentrations in superficial soil samples ranged from 100 to 9000 ppm. The major predictor of children's blood lead levels was exposure to soil. We estimated that soil represents more than 90% of the lead exposure sources, especially for small children, with values higher than those established by the EPA to take remedial measures. There is an urgent need to take some control measures in the area and educate the population on preventive measures. 314 CHROMOSOMAL TRANSLOCATIONS IN WORKERS OF MA?

EMail: vborja@toluca.podernet.com.mx To assess potential genotoxic effects of DDT exposure, we evaluated chro? mosomal translocations in a sample of nineteen male sprayers (median age 46 years), working in campaigns to control malaria vectors in the state of Guerrero, Mexico. The main activities of these workers were the application of pesticides, detection of malaria cases and promotion of preventive mea? sures for control of vectors. The average time of exposure to technical grade DDT was 25 years, being their last exposure 5 months before sampling. An interview gathered information on the occupational history, reproductive performance, life styles and other relevant factors. DDT Data obtained in a previous study from eleven individuals, 5 women and 6 men, living in Mexico City, and occupationally unexposed to DDT were used as reference group. Chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes were analysed with a chro? mosome painting technique, a high sensitivity technique for detecting complex chromosomal translocations. o,p'-DDT was the only metabolite significantly associated with the frequency of chromosomal translocations (p= 0.003). Individuals presenting the higher levels of o,p'-DDT in serum (&gt; 0.79 ug/g fat) had a mean frequency of chromosomal translocations (5.1 x 1000 metaphases) two times higher than the observed in workers occupa? tionally exposed to 0.5 Gy of radiation. A positive relationship between the duration of exposure to DDT, measured as years working for the vector control program, and chromosomal translocations was observed. These re? sults suggest an increased risk for diseases with a genetic component such as cancer. 312 RELATION BETWEEN CHILDHOOD ASTHMA EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION IN JUAREZ CITY, CHIHUAHUA.

EMail: iromieu@insp3.insp.mx We studied the relation between concentrations of particles of a diameter smaller or equal to 10 /im (PMIO) and ozone in the environment and, the daily number of emergency visits due to asthma and acute respiratory diseases, among children younger than 15 years old living in Juarez City, Chihuahua. Atmospheric data were obtained from the database of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), from 8 monitoring stations lo? cated in Juarez City, Chihuahua and El Paso, Texas. Health data of emer- gency-visits for respiratory causes were extracted from existing medical records from 2 hospitals of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in Juarez City for the period July 1997 to December 1998. Diagnoses were classified in two groups: asthma and upper respiratory infections (URI) according to the International Classification of Diseases (IDC-9 and/or IDC-10). The anal? ysis was carried out using the Poisson Regression time series methodology. During the study period, the mean 24-hour PMIO level was 34-46 jbLg/m3 (SD 17.99) and the mean ozone level was 51.60 ppb (SD 20.70). Our model predicted that an increase of 20 /ig/m3 in the average 24-hour exposure to PM10 was related to an increase of 4-97% (95% CI 0.97%, 9.13%) in emergency visits for asthma with a 5-day lag and to an increase of 9% (CI 95%: 1.8%, 16.8%) when a 5-day cumulative exposure was considered. We observed that the impact of PM10 on emergency visits for asthma was larger on days with ozone ambient levels exceeding 49 ppb (median levels). Adverse effects of PM10 ambient levels are present at concentrations who are not exceeding the standard and a synergic effect of PM10 and ozone may be present. 315 CHROMIUM EXPOSURE AND GASTRIC CANCER. A COM? BINED ANALYSIS CIELO FERNANDEZ-ORTEGA, ZHANG Z, FROINES J. Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health. EMail: cielo@ucla.edu Recent evidence indicates that Hexavalent Chromium compounds may induce other types of cancers than respiratory cancer and in particular can affect the Gastro Intestinal (GI) system. The purpose of this study was to examine the literature and to combine the published results through a meta-analysis procedure, in order to clarify the association between chro? mium exposure and gastric cancer. From the 59 retrieved articles with some information about gastric cancer , only twenty-two fulfilled all the pre-established requirements and the experts panel evaluation. The random effect estimation of the 22 studies finally selected for the combined analysis, gave a pooled standardized mortality ratio of 1.45 (CI 1.27-1.63) Those studies that were performed using a personal or location sampling to assess exposure presented a higher pooled SMR (1.955 CI 1.490-2.420) The studies that were considered by the panel group as of better quality gave a pooled SMR of 1.905 (CI= 1.465-2.346). The smallest pooled SMR estimates were found among the studies that used only job titles as a proxy of exposure (SMR 1.226 CI 1.020-1.432), as well as those determined as having lower quality of exposure assesment, with an SMR 1.255- (CI= 1.041-1-470). The results from this meta-analysis, without taking into account the heterogeneity of all the studies, present clear evidence which indicates that exposure to chromium may lead to an increase in the risk of gastric cancer. Exposure to chromium in the form of mechan- ically generated dust would results in substantial amounts being deposited in the head-airway region with subsequent mucociliary, cleaning and swallow- ing. This could lead to chromium deposition in the GI tract prior to absorption, although this situation will depend primarily on the type and susceptibility of the population and the prevalence of exposure. Chromium VI is reduced in the acidic environment of the stomach to chromium III. Therefore there is a competition between chromium III formation, chro? mium VI uptake and absorption. Further toxicology and epidemiologic research is required to further clarify the potential risk associated with chromium and the GI track.</page><page sequence="101">S102 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 316 HOUSING AND EXCESS WINTER DEATH FROM CARDIOVAS? CULAR DISEASE IN ENGLAND, 1986-1996 PAUL WILKINSON, LANDON M, ARMSTRONG B, STEVENSON S, FLETCHER T. London School of Hygiene &amp;. Tropical Medicine. EMail: paul.wilkinson@lshtm.ac.uk Background: Britain has an excess of winter deaths which is proportionately greater than in most other countries of continental Europe and Scandinavia. Much of the seasonal increase is due to a rise in cardiovascular death. We have investigated whether the vulnerability to winter death is related to housing quality and socio-economic status. Methods: Analysis of 80,331 deaths from cardiovascular disease in England, 1986-1996, linked by postcode of residence to data from the 1991 English House Conditions Survey. Results: Overall, deaths from cardiovascular disease were 22.9% (95% CI 21.2 - 25.0%) higher in winter months (December to March) than in other months of the year. The percentage of winter excess varied little by region or socio-economic status, but rose steeply with age. After adjustment for age, sex and socio-economic group, statistically significant gradients in excess winter death were seen with age of the property (28.2% winter excess in properties built before 1850 compared to 15.0% in properties built after 1980, p&lt;0.001 for trend) and with poorer thermal efficiency ratings. A strong association was also seen with an index of lower indoor temperatures: an increase from the 5th to 95th percentile of this index was associated with a relative risk of 1.24 (1.12 - 1.38) after adjustment for age, sex and soc.io-economic group. Adjustment for the index of indoor temperature flattened the gradient in risk seen with age of property. Conclusions: The results suggest that indoor temperature and markers of thermal efficiency of dwellings, including property age, are associated with increased vulnerability to winter death from cardiovascular disease. Substan? tial public health benefits can be expected from measures which improve the thermal efficiency of homes and the affordability of heating them. 320 LOW INDOOR TEMPERATURE IN WINTER: ASSOCIATION WITH COLD-RELATED CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH IN ENGLAND PAUL WILKINSON, ARMSTRONG B, LANDON M, STEVENSON S, FLETCHER T. London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. EMail: paul.wilkinson@lshtm.ac.uk Objective: To assess variation in indoor temperature in winter as a vulnerability factor for cardiovascular mortality in England. Methods: Analysis of temperature and energy data from the 1991 English House Conditions Survey, and their linkage by postcode of residence to daily mortality and outdoor temperature data for 1986-1996. Results: When corrected to standard conditions of 5 degrees Celsius outdoor temperature, it was estimated that 38% of households would have hall temper? atures below 16 degrees Celsius. Indoor temperatures had a positive association with household income and energy efficiency of the dwelling, and an inverse relationship with the age of the property and the cost of heating it to a standard regime. Mean corrected (to 5 degrees Celsius outside temperature) hall temper? atures (95% CI) by tenure and heating cost were as follows: Standardized heating cost (quartile) These temperatures were found to have an inverse association with cold-related cardiovascular mortality. Cardiovascular mortality overall was 26% (95% CI: 22 -29%) higher on days when the outside temperature was less than 5 degrees Celsius compared with all other days, and the excess increased by 6.1% (95% CI 2.7 - 9.5%) for each degree Celsius fall in mean hall temperature. Conclusions: Many households in England, especially those in the socially- rented sector with high heating costs, experience temperatures below minimum recommended levels on cold days. Residents of dwellings which maintain relatively low indoor temperatures are at higher risk of cold-related cardiovas? cular death. Improvement in home insulation, especially for the elderly and other vulnerable groups, should be a goal of public policy. 318 GIS EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT FOR PESTICIDES AND DRINK? ING WATER IN THE CAPE COD BREAST CANCER AND ENVI? RONMENT STUDY IULIA BRODY, MELLY S, RUDEL R, MAXWELL NANCY. Silent Spring Institute. EMail: brody@silentspring.org OBJECTIVES: In a case-control study of possible environmental factors in cancer etiology, researchers must assess exposures years ago, often to factors study participants are not able to report themselves. The Cape Cod Breast Cancer and Environment Study addresses this problem by applying GIS technology to link historical geographically-based environmental data with interview data. The objective is to assess historical exposures to pesticides from wide-area spraying and pesticide-treated land uses, to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) from wastewater infiltration in drinking water, and to certain other pollutants from residential, commercial, and industrial land use. This paper focuses on GIS exposure assessment methods. METHODS: The case-control study includes approximately 2500 Cape Cod women: women diagnosed in 1988-1995 and age-matched controls. Interviews included established breast cancer risk factors, hypothesized environmental factors, and women's Cape Cod addresses for the past 40 years and at birth. Addresses were geo-coded to link to GIS environmental data. GIS coverages include locations of wide-area pesticide application, selected land uses, waste disposal facilities, known plumes of groundwater contamination, public drinking water wells and distribution systems, and zones of contribution to public water supplies. Polygons representing wide-area pesticide application are linked to spreadsheets identifying the pesticide, amount applied, and years of application. Land use coverages from aerial photographs for four time periods dating back to 1951 provide information about pesticide-treated land uses, including cranberry bogs, other agricultural land, golf courses, and wetlands likely to have been sprayed for mosquitoes. Exposure variables were developed beginning with a conceptual model of exposure from each source, then defining operational procedures and pre-testing procedures on 5,000 residential addresses. Exposure variables will be exported and used in odds-ratio analyses. For example, geographically based exposures to wide-area pesticide spraying for gypsy moth may be aggregated over a woman's Cape Cod addresses and combined with interview data about her home and garden pesticide use. RESULTS: Practical methods were developed and tested for estimating expo? sures to pesticides and to drinking water infiltrated by wastewater. Exposure variables constructed from GIS data show meaningful variation in exposure of Cape Cod addresses to pesticides from wide-area application, pesticides associ? ated with selected land uses, and public drinking water quality. CONCLUSIONS: GIS techniques are a promising complement to interview data in case-control studies of possible environmental factors in cancer etiology. How? ever, missing historical data in GIS coverages and loss of detail during aggregation to construct exposure variables may be substantial sources of misclassification. 322 ESTIMATION OF EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION ON DAILY MORTALITY USING POISSON REGRESSION MODELLING WITH OFFSET ON LOG(EXPECTED NUMBER) OBTAINED FROM THE CORE MODELS CHIT-MINGWONG, MA STEFAN, HEDLEY ANTHONY JOHNSON, LAM TAI-HING. The University of Hong Kong. EMail: hrmrwcm@hlaicc.hku.hk OBJECTIVE In APHEA (Air Pollution and Health: A European Approach) studies, it is accept- able to use highly correlated covariates for establishment of core models. However when a pollutant is introduced into the core model, multicollinearity may occur and would give rise to biases if there are measurement errors in the pollutant concen? trations. To overcome these problems, we introduced and assessed an approach using offset in Poisson regression modelling. METHODS Daily numbers of deaths due to all non-accident, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, for the period 1995 to 1997 were used as the dependent variables. Daily means of temperature and relative humidity; dummy variables for influenza, holidays and days of the week; as well as smootning functions on serial number of days (1 to 1096), were used as covariates in Poisson regression. A two-stage offset approach: (i) establishment of the core model with the above-mentioned covariates using APHEA guidelines and (ii) modelling the pollutant with offset on log(expected number). The expected numbers were estimated from the core model. The relative risks (RRs) for 10th to 90th percentile change of pollutant concentrations, the dispersion measure (phi) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) were compared between those from the two-stage offset approach and those from following the APHEA guidelines. RESULTS Cbmparing with the APHEA approach, RRs estimated from the two-stage offset model were all smaller for the four pollutants N02, S02, PM10 and OJ: (a) in non-accident mortality from 1.033 =&gt; 1.018, 1.030 =&gt; 1.026, 1.016 =&gt; 1.009, and 1.011 =&gt; 1.007; (b) cardiovascular mortality 1.057 =&gt; 1.041, 1.046 =&gt; 1.041,1.024 =&gt; 1.020, and 1.014 =&gt; 1.011; and (c) respiratory 1.069 =&gt; 1.040, 1.041 =&gt; 1.038,1.054 =&gt; 1.027, and 1.031 =&gt; 1.022. But at the same time phi's were smaller from around 1.14 =&gt; 1.11,1.10 =&gt; 1.05 and 1.09 =&gt; 1.06; and the AICs with adjustment in degrees of freedom were also smaller by a magnitude of around 30. CONCLUSION Poisson regression with offset provides a better estimation method, in that the dispersions were smaller and tne models fit the data better. It was also robust to biases arising from multicollinearity and measurement errors. It also allows stratified analysis readily after expected numbers have been derived from the core models. However we need to assume that the daily counts of health outcomes are generated in a two-stage process and the expected numbers are without measurement errors. Although the assumptions are apparently justified in view of the smaller AIC, simulation studies are required for verification.</page><page sequence="102">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S103 323 APPLICATION OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) IN HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT AROUND AMSTER? DAM AIRPORT SCHIPHOL CARLA VAN WIECHEN, FRANSSEN E, LEBRET E. National Institute of Public Health and the Environment. EMail: carla.van.wiechen@rivm.nl Introduction: Amsterdam airport Schiphol, the main airport of the Nether? lands, is expanding at a high rate. At the same time public concern about the health risks of pollution, associated with air traffic, is growing as well. In the framework of a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement, the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) co-ordinates and performs a Health Impact Assessment Schiphol (HIAS) of aircraft related pollution on public health. The HIAS consists of risk assessments (phase I), analysis of existing health registries and a series of epidemiological surveys (phase II), and a monitoring component (phase III). Application of GIS: GIS applications have played an important role in all phases of the HIAS. In the risk assessments, GIS was essential in estimating the number of people in the region with health risks attributable to airport-related exposures, by overlaying cadastral information with exposure contours and combining these with exposure-response information. Spatial (auto-)correlations were addressed in the analysis of data from existing health registries. In the epidemiological field studies, GIS was used in various stages of the research. These studies were aimed to assess exposure-response relationships between exposure to aircraft noise or air pollution and health effects, such as annoy? ance, sleep disturbance, perceived health and respiratory diseases. An other objective was to collect baseline information for the monitoring component. For example, in the design and sampling stage, GIS was used to obtain a stratified sample for the questionnaire study, using noise contours and distance strata. Moreover, GIS was applied to assign exposure to individuals under study, based on residential address. In the presentation of results GIS was useful as well, to address spatial patterns, e.g. yearly maps of aircraft noise complaints. Results of the use of different GIS applications in the HIAS will be presented and discussed. Conclusion: GIS is an integral tool for the Health Impact Assessment Schiphol. Critical aspects are the availability of cadastral and demographic information of high spatial resolution and availability of additional information of potential confounders, e.g. age, sex, smoking, ethnicity, and education. 325 MODELLING LEVELS OF POLLUTION FOR USE IN TIME SERIES STUDIES EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH GAVIN SHADDICK, WAKEFIELD JON, ELLIOTT PAUL. Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Department of. EMail: g.shaddick@ic.ac.uk In conducting time series studies to investigate the relationship between air pollution and a health outcome, for example respiratory mortality, it is important to have a good measure of the level of pollution on any particular day. Often daily measurements are available from a number of monitoring sites across the study. Each of these monitors may measure different sets of pollutants, there may be periods of missing data, and all of the recorded measurements will be subject to error. This paper describes the problems of combining such data to produce estimates of the levels of pollution that can be used in modelling the health outcome. A hierarchical model is used for the analysis, addressing the issues described, and specifically, allows information from multiple sites on different pollut? ants to be combined. This allows an estimate of the underlying pollution level for each pollutant at each site to be obtained, incorporating any possible lag structure, along with a measure of uncertainty. This is particu? larly useful for accounting for the variation in the pollution level, whether formally via error-in-variables modelling, or informally when interpreting the regression coefficients describing the relationship between risk and pollution. These methods are used in assessing the relationship between respiratory mortality and pollution in London for the period 1993-96. A number of pollutants, including PM10, CO, NO and S02, were measured at five sites in London and the available data used to calculate a daily estimates of the underlying levels of pollution which are then analysed with respect to the health data. 324 ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE AND NON-FATAL MYO? CARDIAL INFARCTION AMONG NEVER-SMOKERS MATS ROSENLUND, BERGLIND NIKLAS, GUSTAVSSON ANNIKA, REUTERWALL CHRISTINA, HALLQVIST JOHAN, NYBERG FREDRIK, PERSHAGEN GORAN. Department of Environmental Health, Stockholm. EMail: mats.rosenlund@smd.sll.se An increased risk for myocardial infarction (Ml) related to environmental tobacco smoke exposure (ETS) has been reported in epidemiological studies, but some aspects of the association are still uncertain. We studied the Ml-risk associated with ETS exposure among male and female nonsmokers in a large Swedish population-based case-control study 1992-1994. In par? ticular, we focused on the importance of intensity and duration of exposure, time since last exposure, and combined exposure from spouse and work, i.e. the major ETS exposure sources. The study population comprised 334 non-fatal never-smoking Ml-cases in the ages of 45-70 years, and 677 population controls matched on age, gender, and hospital catchment area. Fatal cases of Ml were excluded due to the lower quality of questionnaire information on ETS and other exposures from next-of-kin. A postal questionnaire provided information on ETS exposure, and a large set of other potential risk factors for Ml, including physical and psychosocial work environment, social factors, different life? style factors, and diet. After adjustment for the matching variables, body mass index, socioeco? nomic status, jobstrain, hypertension, and diet, the odds ratio for Ml was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0-2.6) among those with an average daily exposure of 20 cigarettes or more from their spouse or cohabitant. Combined exposure from spouse and work showed a consistently increasing odds ratio for Ml, up to 1.56 (95% CI 1.0-2.3) in the highest category of weighted duration, i.e. more than 90 hour-years of exposure (1 hour-year=365 hours, or 1 hour/day for one year). In addition, the combined exposure appeared to convey a higher risk for more recent exposure. In conclusion, our data confirm a risk of non-fatal Ml from exposure to ETS, and show that intensity of spousal exposure, combined exposure from dif? ferent sources, and time since last exposure might be of special importance. 326 CHANGING GEOGRAPHIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN AIR POLLUTION AND CARDIO-RESPIRATORY MORTALITY IN GREAT BRITAIN, 1962-1996 DAVID BRIGGS, ELLIOTT PAUL, SHADDICK GAVIN, FRASER AMANDA. Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Department of. EMail: g.shaddick@ic.ac.uk Major reductions in concentrations of black smoke and S02 have occurred in Britain over the last 30 years, due to the introduction of emission control policies, technological innovations and structural changes in industry. In recent years, these trends have also been associated with a change in the source and composition of these pollutants: for example, a reduction in coal-based emissions and an increase in contributions from road traffic. Marked geographic variations in levels of pollution have nevertheless per? sisted. This study thus uses a novel design to examine the geographic association between cardio-respiratory mortality and concentrations of black smoke and S02, measured at the small area (ward) level over the poeriod since 1962. Data on annual pollution concentrations are derived from the national monitoring network for the period 1962 to 1993. Data on cardio- respiratory mortality were obtained from the national database held within the Small Area Health Statistics Unit for five periods of time (1977-80, 1981-84, 1985-88, 1989-92, 1993-96). Relationships are investigated for different exposure periods (1962-77, 1966-81, 1970-85, 1974-89, 1978- 93) and for different latencies. Using expected values based on standardised national rates for Great Britain, Poisson regression is used to model the ward level data in order to assess the relationship berween cumulative exposure to black smoke and S02 and the health outcome. In addition to investigating the effects of different latency periods, the model allows for the effect of pollution to vary over the study period, reflecting the changes in the levels and composition of the pollutants. In addition, the effect of socio-economic confounding is examined, using a ward-level measure of deprivation based on census data.</page><page sequence="103">S104 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 328 ARE WE GETTING THE RIGHT FIGURES? METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN ASSESSING THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF TRANS? PORT POLICIES AND THEIR COSTS FRANCESCA RACIOPPI. DORA CARLOS, PHILLIPS MARGARET, MADDISON. DAVID. World Health Organization, European Center for. EMail: frr@who.it INTRODUCTION In the countries of the European Union the external costs of transport are estimated in the order of around 4 - 5 % of the GDP, which in the European Union amounts to about 300 billion Euros. The estimated share of the effects considered is as follows: Accidents: 2.5 % GDP (ca. 7.5 billion Euros); Air pollution: 0.6 % GDP (ca. 1.8 billion Euros); Climate change: 0.5 % GDP (ca 1.5 Euros); Noise: 0.4 % GDP (ca 1.2 billion Euros); Uncovered infrastructure costs: 0.15 % GDP (ca. 0.45 billion Euros). Although these figures are considered to be reasonable for the purpose of policy making, there is consensus that they underestimate certain costs, such as air pollution and climate change, and neglects others (e.g. separation effects, damage to land- scapes). (Source: Efficient Transport for Europe - Policies for internalisation of external costs" 1998 - ECMT). METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS The key methodological problems in the evaluation of transport-related health costs emerged from a recent review carried by WHO include the following: 1. Incomplete economic valuation of identified health outcomes. Only costs that are more easily measured tend to be considered (such as medical treatment or lost wages), neglecting more problematic ones, such as the cost of pain and grief. The valuation of one cause of death has been applied to other types of deaths. For example, deaths precipitated by air pollution are often erroneously valued the same as road accident fatalities. 2. Failure to capture the full spectrum of health consequences of transport. There is a need to incorporate the health costs of psychological consequences, such as fear, stress and irritation; of isolation and social disruption that busy roads can generate; and the benefits of physical exercise from cycling and walking for transport. This leads to incorrect estimates of costs and benefits. 3. Failure to consider the health costs of aversive behaviour and the loss of welfare it represents. For example, many people possibly feel prevented from engaging in walking or cycling for transport, by fear of traffic accidents, road noise or air pollution. This leads to a reduction in the physical activity level for a population and is likely to result in substantial health costs. Reason for the above issues is also the lack of adequate epidemiological evidence on some of these health effects and benefits. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for: 1. Research on some key limitations in the present ways of assessing the health impacts of transport. The research objectives of epidemiologists should include a contribution towards filling these gaps, thereby informing the policy development process, including through economic analysis. 2. Guidance on the implementation of methods for the valuation of the health impacts of transport and for their harmonization. 3. Dissemination of best practices, taking stock of current experience. 330 EFFECT OF SHIFT WORK ON 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE OF MILD HYPERTENSIVE WORKERS HYUNGIOON CHUN, SON M, PAEK D. School of Public Health, Seoul National University. EMail: happyday@plazal.snu.ac.kr Twenty four-hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rates monitoring was done for the evaluation of shift work effect on blood pressure and heart rates of hypertensive shift workers. Ten mild hypertensive male shift workers in an automobile manufacturing plant adopting 12 hour shift system participated in blood pressure and heart rates monitoring during their day and night shifts. Hourly mean systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rates according to clock time were compared with elapsed time after work started. Circadian blood pressure and heart rates rhythm were reversed along shift schedules. For the evaluation of mean blood pressure and heart rates change due to shift work, we used mixed effects model adjusting other factors including current smoking status, usual alcohol drinking, family history of hypertension, at work or off work in a day, subject's age, tenure, duration of shift work, and interpersonal difference of subjects. From the mixed effects model, shift work effect on blood pressure and heart rates was statistically insignificant. From the results of present study, it is concluded that circadian rhythm of blood pressure and heart rates of hypertensive shift workers is preserved and reversed acccording to shift schedules, but shift work does not signigicantly influence on 24-hour blood pressure and heart rates. Further studies are needed whether shift work effect on blood pressure and heart rates presented in this study is consistent with other shift systems, industries, races. 329 EFFECT OF INTERPREGNANCY INTERVAL ON RISK OF SPON? TANEOUS PRETERM BIRTH ANNE CARTER, HOSSAIN M. M., CARTER THOMAS. Faculty of Med? icine and Health Sciences, UAE. EMail: anneandtomcarter@netscape.net Background. Short interpregnancy interval, a potentially modifiable puta? tive risk factor for preterm birth, has been studied mainly in US populations with equivocal results. Emirati women represent an ideal population to study because they have a wide range of interpregnancy intervals and uniformity in other potentially confounding factors, some of which may be unidentified. Methods. Cases (all multiparous Emirati women delivering singletons spon- taneously before 37 weeks gestation) and controls (the next eligible similar woman delivering after 37 weeks gestation) were identified from the 1997 and 1998 labour room log books of all three hospitals (delivering 99% of babies) in Al Ain, UAE. Medical records of each subject were searched to document prenatal care and obstetrical history. Women whose most recent previous delivery was unavailable, multiple, preterm or resulted in fetal loss were excluded, leaving 87 cases and 86 controls eligible for the study. Results. Short interpregnancy intervals were significantly associated with case status. Unadjusted odds ratios (and confidence intervals) for the 1st, 2nd, and 4th quartile of interpregnancy interval compared with the lowest risk 3rd quartile are 8.8 (3.2-23.9), 2.3 (1.0-5.7) and 1.1 (.45-2.7) respec? tively. When adjusted for birth weight of current child, gestational age of previous pregnancy, sex of current and pervious child, matermal age and gravidity, these odds ratios are, 13.8 (3.1-61.9), 9.7 (2.1-44-3) and 2.7 (0.7-10.9) respectively. Conclusion. A short interpregnancy interval is a risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth in Emirati women. The magnitude of the risk and the dem- onstration of a risk gradient between exposure quartiles make it likely that this risk factor is causally associated and that modification of the risk factor will lead to reduced risk of preterm birth. 331 OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO VIBRATION, ETIOLOGICAL FACTOR FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE LUCIANA TAMAIAN. Pneumoconiosis Lab. Mining Institute, Cluj, Ro? mania. EMail: ocupatio@jeffmcm.ispcj.ro Aim: This study intends to contribute to the acquaintance of clinical symptoms and functional disorders in blood pressure, in vibration occupa? tional exposure. Method: It was foilowed the prevalence of high blood pressure to 150 patients, males, distributed in 3 groups (A, B, with occupational exposure to vibration and C without occupational exposure to vibration). Results: The relationship expressed as prevalence was examined by the chi squared test and the differences between means by the student's t-test. The prevalence of high blood pressure was 50% in A group, 18% in B group and 12% in C group, chi squared test= 16,88 p&lt;0,001 (A/C); chi squared test=0,706, p=0,05(B/C). Conclusion: The results of the study show that occupational exposure to vibration leads to a significant increase of the high blood pressure, mostly when Raynaud phenomenon is present.</page><page sequence="104">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S105 332 SPATIAL DIFFERENTIALS AND MORTALITY IN A DEVELOP? ING URBAN AREA ROMULO PAES-SOUSA. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Med? icine. EMail: romulopaes@hotmail.com Studies on health inequalities on developing cities are scarce. They have mainly focused on infant and child mortality and life expectancy at birth. Studies of adult mortality and cause-specific studies have seldom been carried out. An ecological study was performed in order to investigate the relationship between mortality due to all causes of death, infectious diseases, combined illness of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnutrition, external causes, homi- cides, and motor vehicle traffic accidents, and socio-environmental condi? tions in a developing city, Belo Horizonte in Brazil. Death certificates relating to 1994 were processed. A total of 10,558 certif? icates were geocoded according to 75 geographical areas. The areas were classified according to the income of the head of family (or female illiteracy when appropriate), and plausible routinely environmental factors. In the study of mortality due to infectious diseases, water, sanitation, crowding, and rubbish collection were tested. Among the external causes, the study focused on homicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents, testing the effect of public illumination, crowding and the average time for police response to a phone call. Analytical and descriptive techniques were used in the study. Mortality rate (MR) ratios were estimated using random effects Poisson regression. A high correlation was found between socio-economic and environmental variables. These correlated to the distribution of mortality rates across the areas. Shantytown areas (the favelas) presented higher risk of mortality than non-favela areas. Infectious diseases, homicide, and combined illness of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnutrition (under 5 years old) presented MR ratios of 1.59, 2.05, 1.62, respectively. All of them presented p-values for trend &lt;0.00. Deaths due to all causes presented 1.12 (p=0.04). Adverse socio-economic and environmental conditions are associated with higher rates of specific cause of death. Deprived areas encompass highest vulnerable groups. The use of routine data in developing countries can be used to measure the inequalities in health, helping build up more adequate urban and health policies. 335 AIR POLLUTION, BIRTHWEIGHT AND PREMATURITY IN SAO PAULO, BRAZIL NELSON GOUVEIA. Departamento de Medicina Preventiva. EMail: ngouveia@mandic.com.br Background/Objectives: Previous studies have implicated air pollution in in? creased mortality and morbidity especially for the elderly and children. More recently, associations with mortality in very young children and with some reproductive outcomes have also been reported. This study aims to explore the association between exposure to outdoor air pollution during pregnancy and two different outcomes: birthweight and prematurity in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Data on all singleton livebirths to mothers resident in Sao Paulo during a one-year period were obtained from the births registry. For each individual birth, information on gestational age, type of delivery, apgar scores, birth weight, sex, maternal education, maternal age, place of residence, and parity was available. Births were grouped into full-term and pre-term datasets. Data on daily levels of PM10, S02, N02, CO, 03, temperature, and humidity were also gathered. The association between the daily number of pre-term births and air pollution and meteorology was assessed in a time-series framework using Generalized Additive Models. Multiple linear regression was used to assess if exposure in different periods of the pregnancy was associated with birth weight, adjusted for other variables. Results: There was little evidence that daily numbers of premature babies were associated with levels of air pollution up to a week before delivery in models adjusted for time trends, day-of-week and meteorology. Nevertheless, a strong association with temperature was found. Birth weight was shown to be associated with length of gestation, maternal age and maternal instruc- tion. On adjusting for all these variables, birth weight was negatively and statistically significantly associated with each pollutant except N02. No association was observed when the exposure considered was the mean in the lst trimester. Most of the pollutants exhibited associations either at the 3rd trimester or when exposure was measured over the entire pregnancy. For example, a mean exposure of 100 mg/m3 of PM10 during the 3rd trimester was associated with a 170 g. reduction in birth weight. Conclusions: Low birthweight is one of the strongest predictors for infant mortality in both developed and developing countries. Thus identification of such a widespread risk factor which, to date, has been understudied is important from the Public Health perspective. Despite information on some factors such as maternal smoking not having been available, these results are consistent with two other studies revealing that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy might interfere with weight gain in the fetus. 333 AIRBORNE ARSENIC AND ITS DOSE-RESPONSE BEHAVIOUR IN CAUSING LUNG CANCER: KNOWLEDGE FROM OCCUPA? TIONAL EXPOSURE DATA HEMANTHA WICKRAMATILLAKE, FRYER P, HARRISON P. MRC Institute for Environment and Health. EMail: hdwml@le.ac.uk While the unit risk is being used to measure the risk of airborne As, researchers have also examined the dose-response behaviour of As in their attempts to measure the risk. These attempts have been based on the data from occupational exposures. The dose-response curves, plotted using data from occupational exposure studies, suggest a possible non-linear relation? ship between occupational As exposures and the risk of lung cancer. The dose-response curves for lung cancer risk among As-exposed workers in several studies appear to increase more steeply at lower exposures. Some researchers (Hertz-Picciotto &amp; Smith, 1993) thought that data from two of the workplaces (i.e. smelters) may be consistent with a linear dose-response, but did not contradict a curvilinear relationship; for one of the studies' adjustment for age in a nested case-referent study appears to eliminate any curvature of decreasing slope. They postulated several possibilities for the non linearity: ? Artefact of statistical method ? Confounding by other carcinogens ? Confounding by smoking ? Synergism ? Healthy worker effect ? Exposure misclassification As at present, the behaviour of arsenic in causing lung cancer at low doses remains unclear. 336 ESTIMATION OF THE HEALTH DAMAGES- EXPOSURE TO PARTICULATE MATTER AIR POLLUTION IN SANTIAGO, CHILE LUIS CIFUENTES, MOREIRA S. Catholic University of Chile. EMail: lac@ing.puc.cl Current levels of respirable particulate matter (PMIO) in Santiago, Chile are well above the national standard of 150 ug/m3 for a good portion ofthe year, and above the currently proposed annual standard of 50 ug/m3. Health risk assessment was used to evaluate the reduction in health effects produced by a reduction in particulate matter from the current levels to compliance levels.. We developed a model to analyze several concentration reduction scenarios, which represent the posible paths to attainment. Special attention was placed in the analysis of the reduction of damages due to reductions of PM2.5 concentrations, and in the consideration of all the uncertainties associated with the estimation of the health effects. The estimate of the damages, coupled with the valuation of each effect, were used to estimate the economic damage produced by the actual concentrations of particulate matter A variety of health endpoints were analyzed and grouped into five categories; premature mortality, chronic bronchitis, hospital admissions, emergency room visits and restrictive activity days. Concentration-response functions obtained in Santiago were used for acute mortality and child medical visits. For the other endpoints, concentration response funcions were obtained from analysis carried out elsewhere, mainly in the US. The base rate of the effects were obtained from statistics of the Ministry of Health. The results indicate that a reduction of 1 ug/m3 of PM2.5 in the year 2000 is associated with 83 less cases of premature mortality (95% CI of 72-95), 270 (CI 200-360) less new cases of chronic bronchitis, 190 (140-240) less hospital admissions, 2500 (1700-3300) less emergency room visits, 1,000 (360-1700) less child medical visits, 32,200 (21,700-42, 600) less asthma attacks and acute bronchitis and finally 844,000 (470,000-1,210,000) less restricted activity days. Using unit values developed in another study, these reduced health effects amount to a marginal benefit of 49,5 millions US dollars per each ug/m3 of PM2.5 reduced. The biggest share of these benefits come from reduced mortality (59%) and reduced incidence of chronic bronquitis (32%).</page><page sequence="105">S106 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 337 SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF AMBIENT PARTICLES ON MOR?

EMail: kkatsoug@cc.uoa.gr Short-term effects of ambient air particles (PM) on the daily total, respira? tory and cardiac mortality have been investigated in 30 European cities within the context of the multi-center collaborative APHEA2 (Air Pollu? tion and Health: a European Approach) project. All cities provided mortal? ity data and at least one indicator of particulate matter (about 20 had PMIO or TSP and 15 black smoke measurements) for at least 4 years in the 90's. Data on several confounders (including other pollutants and meteorological variables) and on effect modifiers (variables characterising the city popula? tion, environment and climate) were also available. In the first stage, the data of each city were first analyzed separately using generalized additive models extending Poisson regression, to allow more flexibility in modeling meteorology and other city-specific time-varying characteristics. Only days with levels of PM &lt;150ig/m3 were included. Adjustment was done for seasonality, temperature, humidity, influenza epidemics, day of the week, holidays and other important events. In the second stage,pooled effects were estimated using fixed and random effects models. Meta-regression models were used to assess the importance of potential effect modifiers (such as annual or seasonal temperature, standardized mortality rate, lung cancer mortality etc). Results from the combined analyses indicate a 3 to 4% increase in the total daily number of deaths associated with 50 ig/m3 increase in PMIO or black smoke. These estimates were heterogeneous. Meta-regres? sion models allowed the identification of effect modifiers which account for a significant proportion of the observed heterogeneity. The above results, derived from a much larger data-base than in APHEA 1, are consistent with the figures previously reported by European andb U.S. studies. The use of meta-regression gives a better insight in the nature of the observed hetero? geneity. 339 LEAD POISONING IN CHILDREN, BAIA MARE, ROMANIA EUGENGURZAU, VILAN D, AVRAM D, RAMBOIU STELA, GERHESI. Environmental Health Center, Cluj, Romania. EMail: egurzau@mail.dntcj.ro Baia Mare has been identified as one of the "hot-spot" polluted areas in Romania. The main industry is represented by two smeiteris, lead being the most important pollutant. Objective: To assess the risk and to evaluate the level of risk perception of the population group with the highest susceptibility to lead from environ? ment (infants), to elaborate a communication strategy to work with the community in order to decrease the exposure, to cut the main pathways. Methods: A cross-sectional study in young children (2-6) to assess the effects on lead body burden of long term exposure to lead in environment. A risk perception study on children's parents. The questionnaire consists of questions related to knowledge, attitudes, and practices that could influence the lead expo? sure. Results: The lead concentration in air, dust and soil was measured. The lead con? centration in soil reached values between 2.000 and 4.000 ppm. The average of blood lead level was very high, 59.16 ug/dL. Strong correlation were found between blood lead level and some behaviors related to hand washing, frequent wet-mopping, eating vegetables from contaminated area, playing with soil, family income. Some ofthe children were under chelation therapy, prior the study. Conclusions: Controlling exposures to soil and dust is more difficult than reducing air emissions, and may require measurements such as increasing public aware? ness, restricting children's access to soil, promoting personal hygiene prac? tices, promoting other dust control measures in homes. Monitoring results should be used to measure the impact of remedial measures and should be made available to the community. In addition to monitoring lead levels in environment, blood lead level should be measured regularly in children, along with indicators of its toxicity such as IQ and grouth rates. A concerted effort should be made to reduce lead exposure due to the insidious effects it can have on young children. 338 INFLUENCE OF AIR POLLUTION AROUND SCHIPHOL AIR?

EMail: p.fischer@rivm.nl An epidemiological study on the association between respiratory symptoms and air pollution due to road- and airtraffic was conducted in 1998/1999 in a population of children living in 7 towns in the surrounding of Schiphol airport (Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Information on respiratory symptoms and potential confounders was collected among 2763 children in the age of 7 to 12 years, using a questionnaire. At the primary schools (n=30), lung function measurements and blood tests for IgE were performed. Several exposure measures were used in this study. First, long term measurements of PM2.5, 'soot', N02, benzene and alkanes were conducted in indoor (school) and outdoor (schoolyard) air. Second, modeled long term air pollution levels (road- and airtraffic) at home address were assessed with geographic infor? mation systems (GIS). Third, distance of home address to nearest runway and to nearest highway was assessed with GIS. In and near primary schools situated close to busy highways, higher concen? trations of 'soot' and N02 were found compared to schools situated at longer distances from highways. Levels of N02, 'soot' and benzene decreased with increasing distance to Schiphol airport. The results show differences between towns in prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the amount of IgE in blood. However, the prevalence was not related to distance to Schiphol airport. No association was found between the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, decreased lung function or amount of IgE in blood and the different exposure measures (measured air pollution, modeled air pollution and distance to runway/highway). The conclusion of this study is that there is no association between air pollution in the surroundings of Schiphol and the health endpoints that were looked at in the participating children. 340 AIR POLLUTION ON STROKE AND ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE MORTALITY IN SEOUL (1991-1997) YUN-CHUL HONG, LEE J, KIM H, KWON H, SCHWARTZ J, CHRIS- TIANI D. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: yhong@hohp.harvard.edu The association between circulatory mortality and air pollution was inves? tigated for 7-year period (January 1991 to December 1997) in Seoul, Korea. Concentrations of total suspended particulates (TSP) and gaseous pollut? ants, such as sulfur dioxide(S02), nitrogen dioxide(N02), ozone(03), car? bon monoxide(CO), were measured daily during the study period. A gen? eralized additive model was used to regress daily circulatory death counts on single pollutant and selected two pollutants, controlling for time trend, day of week, and meteorological influences such as temperature and relative humidity. Strokes and ischemic heart disease deaths were examined sepa? rately. Stroke mortality was found to increase 0.5% (95% CI: 0.4 to 0.5%) for each 10 ug/m3 increase in TSP, 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3 to 0.7%) for each 10 ppb increase in N02, 0.6% (95% CI: -0.2 to 1.5%) for each 10 ppb increase in S02, 3.4% (95% CI: 3.0 to 3.9%) for each 1 ppm increase in CO, and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7 to 1.1%) for each 10 ppb increase in 03. The risk for ischemic heart disease mortality was increased 2.7% (95% CI: 1.1 to 4-2%) for each 1 ppm increase in CO and 1.5% (95% CI: 0.7 to 2.3%) for each 10 ppb increase in 03. However, ischemic heart disease mortality was not increased with TSP, N02, and S02. In two-pollutant models of TSP+03, TSP+CO, and 03+CO, the association of TSP remained positively asso? ciated with stroke and negatively with ischemic heart disease mortality. The positive association of 03 with stroke and ischemic heart disease mortality was not changed in the two-pollutant models. The risk of CO on stroke mortality changed negatively in the two-pollutant model with TSP, but remained strongly positive in ischemic heart disease mortality. The associ? ation of particulate and gaseous air pollution with stroke mortality was observed while 03 and CO are significant positive predictors on ischemic heart disease mortality. The influence of air pollutants on stroke and isch? emic heart disease mortality was different and suggests different pathogenesis of air pollution on stroke and ischemic heart disease. Misclassification may occur if stroke and ischemic heart disease mortality are considered together in studies of the health effects of air pollution.</page><page sequence="106">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S107 341 AIR POLLUTION AND LIFE-THREATENING CARDIAC AR- RHYTHMIA SIMON STEVENSON, WILKINSON P, FLETCHER T, ARMSTRONG B. London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, UK. EMail: s.stevenson@lshtm.ac.uk Background Epidemiological studies have linked outdoor air pollution to mortality and morbidity from cardio-respiratory disease. Using patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) we have examined the relationship between air pollution and the frequency of life- threatening cardiac arrhythmia. These patients are a suitable group for study as they present a relatively stable underlying pathology and the data from the ICD are stored by the device and can be downloaded for subsequent analysis. Aims. To test the hypothesis that the incidence of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, reflected by the discharge of implantable cardioverter defibrillators, is increased on days of high outdoor air pollution. To highlight design issues in the methodology and pilot methods for a prospec? tive multi-centre study. Methods The study population comprises of the 180 patients (aged 29-99 years) im- planted with ICDs from the Department of Cardiology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London since January 1990. Clinical details ofthe patients and other variables such as age, sex and postcode have been obtained from patient records. Details of discharge events (date, time, change of rhythm and type of event) are downloaded from the ICD. Exposure to outdoor air pollution is obtained from the London Air Quality Network and the National Air Quality Monitoring Network. We have linked patients to their nearest outdoor air pollution monitoring station from their postcode using a Geographical Information System (GIS). Data was obtained on daily mean concentrations of particles (PMIO), sulphur dioxide, nitrogen diox? ide and ozone. Meteorological data for the same period was obtained from the British Atmospheric Data Centre: minimum, maximum and mean daily tem? peratures, absolute and relative humidity and wind speed. Data on influenza and respiratory infections were also obtained from the Public Health Laboratory Service and from the Royal College of General Practitioners surveillance practices. Results We will present results of the study using established Poission time-series analysis where the main outcome of the daily rate of ICD discharge will be calculated in relation to person-time at risk. Examination of pollution-response relationships will include analysis of lagged events. Confounding by temperature, seasonal factors and respiratory infection will be addressed using standard methods. Discussion will also be given to methodological factors such as potential changes in sensitivity from the periodic reprogramming ofthe ICD, the need for improved data on patient activity, the potential misclassification of exposure from fixed site monitoring and the use of personal monitoring devices. 343 A EUROPEAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR DISEASE AND EXPOSURE MAPPING AND RISK ASSESSMENT SAMANTHA COCKINGS, JARUP LARS, AYLIN P, ELLIOTT P, POULSTRUP A, REUTERWALL CHRISTINA, PEKKANEN JUHA, MARTUZZI M, FERRANDIZ J, STAINES A, RICHARDSON S. Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Imperial College. EMail: s.cockings@ic.ac.uk The European Health and Environment Information System (EUROHEIS) project aims to improve understanding of the links between environmental exposure, health outcome and risk, by developing integrated information sys? tems for the rapid assessment of relationships between the environment and health at a geographical level. The project is a feasibility study to assess the possibility of implementing systems for point source investigations and disease and exposure mapping in eight European countries (UK, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Spain, Italy, France and Eire). The partners involved in this project have been at the forefront of developing systems and methodologies for the appraisal and analysis of disease occurrence in small geographical areas as related to point source exposures and disease mapping within their respective countries. A system for point source investigations, including some disease mapping capabilities, has already been developed within the UK. The project aims to use this expertise and experience to extend and apply the systems and methodologies across the participating countries. The project provides a detailed report of the geographically referenced health, environmental, population, socio-economic and geographical datasets available for use in developing the systems within the participating countries. Accessibility, coverage, completeness, quality, and feasibility issues related to their use are ad? dressed. Recommendations, specifications and guidelines on the practical implementa? tion of computerised systems for rapid point source investigation and disease and exposure mapping within each partner country are developed. Sets of core data requirements for various levels of implementation are identified. The possibilities for assessing socio-economic status from the various routinely collected data sources within the participating countries and incorporating these into the systems are explored, together with mechanisms for elucidating ine? qualities in health and exposure. The impact of data quality and resolution on estimates of disease occurrence are also considered. Previously developed statis? tical methodologies (including Bayesian statistical models using WinBUGS) are applied within some of the participating countries. The results from the project are to be widely disseminated within the partner countries and the European Community as a whole (including the development of an internet site) and should form the basis for the future practical implemen? tation of the systems and methodologies within the participating countries. 342 HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR RESPIRATORY ILLNESS IN CHIL? DREN UNDER FIVE IN A HIGHLY INDUSTRIALISED AREA IN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND. ALEX BOTTLE, AYLIN P, GROSSINHO ANA, ELLIOTT P. SAHSU, Imperial College School of Medicine. EMail: robert.bottle@ic.ac.uk Background Acute increases in the levels of air pollution are associated with acute ill health and excess mortality, especially from cardio-respiratory diseases. Much less is known about the effects of chronic exposure to air pollution on health, including possible health effects among people living close to indus? trial sources. Methods and Results We have carried out studies of hospital admissions for respiratory illness in children and cardio-respiratory disease in the elderly. There was a suggestion of excess risk in children under five years of age in Teesside, a highly industrialised area in the North East of England. This study used pollution modelling to estimate exposure to NOx and S02 in Teesside in order to investigate possible associations between hospital admissions to respiratory illness and pollution concentrations among children under five years of age. Results will be presented at the conference. Further analyses are planned to test the sensitivity of the results to different pollution estimates incorporat- ing other meteorological and monitoring station data. 344 METHODS OF ASSESSING EXPOSURE TO HAZARDS RELEASED FROM WASTE LANDFILLS: RECOMMENDATIONS OF WHO WORKING GROUP MICHAL KRZYZANOWSKI, WHO WORKING GROUP. WHO Euro? pean Centre for Environment and Health,. EMail: mkr@who.nl Potential risk to health from hazardous waste disposal in landfills remains a public concern. However, the results of available epidemiological studies are insufficient for reliable risk assessment mostly due to the weakness of exposure assessment methods applied in the completed studies. The WHO Working Group, convened by the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, is to recommend the methods of assessing exposure to hazards released from waste landfills. The methods should be applicable both in epidemiological studies and in risk assessment of the existing landfills. Use of these standardized methods in the future research should allow comparability of results produced by various studies. It should also enable their combined analysis, increasing the reliability of results and identifying specific charac? teristics of landfills modifying the health risk. This, in turn, should contrib? ute to the improved design and operation of the landfills, increasing their safety and protection of public health. The recommended methods should also facilitate future monitoring and risk assessment. Based on the back? ground papers prepared by invited scientists, the WHO WG Meeting, convened in Lodz, Poland, 10-12 April 2000, will propose exposure indi? cators and methods for their generation. The summary of the recommended methods will be presented at the Conference.</page><page sequence="107">S108 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 345 MONITORING HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN EUROPE: RECOMMENDATIONS BETTINA MENNE, CAMPBELL-LENDRUM D, WILKINSON P, KUHN K, HAINES A, PARR T, KOVATS SARI, BERTOLLINI R. WHO. EMail: bme@who.it NoLIMITS (Network of Long Term Integrated Monitoring Sites) is a preparatory action of the European Union ENRICH (European Network for Research in Global Change) programme. A subgroup of NoLIMITS exam? ined the data availability and methods of monitoring the health impacts of climate change in Europe using evidence on the temporal and geographical patterns of climate-sensitive disease. We report the summary findings of the subgroup in relation to four headings. Vector-borne illness. For most vector-borne illnesses (malaria, Leishmania- sis, tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease), current monitoring data can provide only very broad quantification of the relationship between climate and human disease. Assessment of the climate contribution to long-term trends requires data on such factors as land use, host abundance and inter? vention measures. The suggested approach is to obtain high quality serial data on vectors and vector abundance at a modest number of sites within currently endemic areas. In addition, monthly data from sites along specified transects would provide useful indication of changing vector distributions. Health effects of thermal extremes. Reliable temperature and mortality data are widely available and can provide long time-series for multiple geograph? ical locations across Europe, often with linkage to infectious disease data. A priority for research based on such data is to examine the modifying effect on the temperature-mortality relationship of individual, social and environmen? tal factors, such as poverty, housing quality, pre-existing morbidity and individual behaviours. Acquisition and linkage with corresponding datasets is needed to support such analysis. Extreme weather events. The EM-DAT database, maintained by the Cath- olic University of Louvain, contains data on extreme weather events over the last hundred years which should be a key resource for monitoring trends. To maximize its utility, attention is needed to ensure completeness and consistency of reporting extreme weather events across a wide geographical area, and to ensure use of standard definitions of events and the application of comparable methods for attribution of health impact. Interpretation of temporal patterns will be aided by work to examine the extent to which human activity and environmental modification protects or increases vul? nerability to extreme weather. Food and water-borne disease. Although there are uncertainties over the consistency of notifications of food and water-borne diseases over the long term, clear temperature relationships are observable from analysis of weekly reports. It is suggested that future investigations should utilise current routine notification systems for cases of food poisoning and incidence of specific pathogens to examine variation in the temperature-disease relation? ships between populations in different geographical areas. 348 AIR POLLUTION, METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND MORTALITY - A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS DANIEL RABCZENKO, BOGDAN WOJTYNIAK, KRYSTYNA SZAFRANIEC, JANUSZ SWIATCZAK. National Institute of Hygiene. EMail: daniel@medstat.waw.pl Meteorological conditions are commonly believed to be important factors affecting wellbeing and health of people, especially those who are already ill. On the other hand there is an important concern in modern time series studies of mortality and air pollution about potential for confounding by meteorological variables. Usually in the studies appropriate lags of temper? ature and mortality and humidity are taken into account and only a very few investigators considered atmospheric pressure or synoptic weather modeling in their analyses. The purpose of our study was to assess sensitivity of air pollution parameters to changes in the amount of meteorological conditions controlled for in the model. The meteorological variables comprised: temperature, change of temperature between consequent days, atmospheric pressure, change of atmospheric pressure between consequent days, humidity, wind. In the analysis we have controlled for long-term trend and seasonality of deaths, days of week holidays, vacation periods, influenza epidemics and air pollu? tion with black smoke and sulfur dioxide. The analysis was carried out for two of the largest Polish cities Cracow and Lodz. Time series covered period 1990-1996. We took into account all deaths without external causes and cardiovascular mortality of all inhabit? ants and those of age 65 years and more. In the analysis we have applied GAM models. We have observed that mortality was significantly associated not only with temperature and humidity, but in several cases also with the other consid? ered meteorological variables. However, we have not found air pollution parameters to be generally sensitive to the presence of those additional meteorological variables. Nevertheless, in a few cases there was a visible change in the mortality risk associated with air pollution. 347 IDENTIFYING, VALUING, AND COMPARING RISKS AND BEN? EFITS OF PUBLIC DRINKING WATER TREATMENT PRAC? TICES: NOVEL APPLICATION OF THE QUALITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEAR(QALY)METRIC IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SETTING. PATRICIA A. MURPHY, RICE G, RHEINGANS R, COHEN J, TEUS- CHLER L, LIPSCOMB J, CLARK R, MILTNER R, BOUTIN B, BROWN M, HARVEY T. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EMail: murphy.patricia@epa.gov The disinfection and treatment of public drinking water supplies to prevent transmission of microbial pathogens is a necessary and successful public health intervention. In 1974 it was discovered that disinfection byproducts (DBPs) were formed when chlorine was added to source waters containing organic precursor material. Epidemiologic and toxicologic studies have raised concerns that DBPs may be associated with other adverse outcomes (cancer and reproductive problems). Any action taken to reduce DBP levels must assure that adequate protection from waterborne infectious agents is main? tained. To help evaluate and manage this environmental risk trade-off, the authors adapted existing techniques and data from epidemiology, risk anal? ysis, and health economies and developed a framework that compares the disparate risks of DBP and microbiological exposures to the benefits of disinfection, and considers the financial costs of actions to reduce these risks. Because both morbidity and mortality are important components of the total disease burden that must be measured and compared, the total impact is captured by using the QALY metric. The presentation will 1) describe the analytical framework and outline the steps for assessing the risks of interest and translating the expected health outcomes into QALYs; and 2) highlight the assumptions and data needs for conducting such an analysis, illustrated by a hypothetical case study that evaluates the incremental cost-effective? ness of two altemative treatment strategies (baseline + ozone and base? line + ozone + in-home filters) compared to the baseline filtration/chlori- nation treatment train. Analyses show both alternatives to be cost-effective by typical public health standards. The projected reductions in Cryptospo- ridiosis that would result from application of both alternatives were the primary factor in the favorable cost-effectiveness ratio. The decrease, as measured in QALY gains, greatly out-weighed the increased cancer risk (as measured by QALY losses). The comparative risk methodology is an infor- mative risk management tool because it is capable of concurrently evaluating the benefits of intervention, i.e., disinfection of public drinking water, the risks of unintended side effects ofthe intervention, i.e., potential health risks posed by disinfectants and DBP, and the relative costs of implementing the intervention strategies. 349 BURDEN OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCB'S) AND PESTICIDES AS PREDICTORS OF BIRTH-WEIGHT OF OFF? SPRING IN THE NEW YORK STATE ANGLER COHORT STUDY (NYSACS) MICHAEL BLOOM, BUCK G, WEINER J, GREIZERSTEIN H, KO- STYNIAK P, VENA J, FITZGERALD E, SWANSON M. SUNY@Buffalo. EMail: msbloom@buffalo.edu Reductions in birthweight have been reported for infants whose mothers consumed PCB contaminated fish. To address this issue, the authors ana? lyzed n= 20 human sera samples from participants in the NYSACS in relation to infants* birthweight. Toxicologic analysis included 82 PCB con? geners, l,l-dichloro-2, 2-bis (chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE), hexachloro- benzene (HCB), and mirex. The laboratory data were adjusted for recovery and lipid concentration, and transformed to logarithms. Maternal age, gra? vidity, parity, body mass index, smoking and alcohol use, socioeconomic status, plurality of birth, marital status, and infant's gender, plurality, and year of birth were considered in a stepwise multiple linear regression model to determine statistically significant relations with the outcome variate. Birthweight was found to be significantly inversely related to PCB congener IUPAC # 99 (R2 = 0.38, P&lt;0.001). 100% of participants exhibited PCB IUPAC #99 values above the level of detection. This congener has a 4,4' substitution pattern which tends to bioaccumulate in mammals. The ana? lytic method employed in determining this congener is incapable of elimi- nating the possibility of contamination by plasticizers inherent in the sol? vents used in the analysis. As such, the finding that this congener apparently is associated with fetal growth should be viewed with caution and more detailed analysis is warranted.</page><page sequence="108">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S109 350 DESIGN OF ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR USE WITH THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ACTION PLANS MICHAL KRZYZANOWSKI, DALBOKOVA D, HUIJSMANS K, WHO WORKING GROUP. WHO European Centre for Environment and Health,. EMail: mkr@who.nl The WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, Bilthoven Divi? sion, has launched a project "Design of environment and health information system for the NEHAPs". The main objectives of this project are to create a common core set of environmental health indicators and to propose an appropriate technological framework to facilitate data access and exchange within as well as between the Member States. This project responds to the recommendations of the 3rd Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health, London, June 1999. The conference emphasized the need for further development or establishment of national information systems as a basis of implementing and monitoring policies, actions and for communication with the public. When applied, the indicators will be an important tool for assessment of the progress of National Environment and Health Action Plans (NEHAPs), which are in advanced stage of implementation in several Member States. A Steering Group meeting, convened in Bilthoven, in January 2000, has selected environmental health issues, which will be included in the system. They cover ambient and indoor air quality, housing, settlements / living environment, noise, sanitation, waste and soil pollution, drinking water, food safety, workplace, recreational waters, radiation and chemical emergencies. The indicators will relate to all elements of environ? ment and health relation chain, including actions. The indicators will be based on existing, routinely collected data sets and on known environmental exposure - health effect relationships. Tentative sets of indicators have been proposed by the Steering Group and will be further elaborated by WHO experts to define their operational form and methods of generation. A WHO Consultation planned for May 2000 will review the proposed set of indica? tors, assess their feasibility for wide application and agree on the structure of the information system. The methods recommended by the Consultation will then be tested in selected countries of the WHO European Region. The progress of the project, and experiences from its implementation relevant for the environmental epidemiology research and practice will be presented at the ISEE meeting. 352 RADON, ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE AND LUNG CANCER IN NEVER-SMOKERS FREDRIK NYBERG, LAGARDE FRfiDfiRIC, AXELSSON GOSTA, DAMBER LENA, MELLANDER HANS, PERSHAGEN GORAN. Insti? tute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska. EMail: Fredrik.Nyberg@imm.ki.se OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the lung cancer risk posed by residential radon exposure for never-smokers and interactions with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). METHODS: We conducted a multi-centre case-control study of 258 never- smoking lung cancer cases and 487 never-smoking controls in Swedenl980- 1995 incorporating measurements of radon in subjects' residences. Data on ETS exposure, occupation and residential history were obtained via questionnaires and from population registers. During the 32-year exposure period 35 to 3 years before entry into the study, radon measurements were obtained for 1595 resi? dential periods (77.7%), covering 81.7% of the observation period for cases and 83.8% for controls. These data were pooled with data on 178 never-smoking cases and 1162 never-smoking controls from a previous nationwide study of radon and lung cancer 1980-1984, in which radon measurements were obtained for 72.6% of residential periods, covering 78.8% of the observation period for cases and 80.0% for controls. Thus, a time-weighted average (TWA) radon exposure was calculated for a total of 436 cases and 1649 controls. Statistical analysis used an excess relative risk (ERR) regression model and were adjusted for age, sex, urbanization, occupational lung cancer risk, socioeconomic status, centre and broad matching areas. RESULTS: The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for lung cancer from residential radon exposure with subjects exposed to &lt; = 1 pCi/L as baseline (RR=1) was 1.3 (1.0-1.9) for 1-2 pCi/L, 1.2 (0.9-1.7) for 2-4 pCi/L and 1.7 (1.1-2.5) for &gt;4 pCi/L (1 pCi/L = 37 Bq/m3). The excess relative risk (ERR) and 95% CI for a continuous radon exposure variable was 0.10 (-0.07 to 0.27) per 100 Bq/m3. Subdivided by ETS exposure status, the ERR estimate for a continuous radon exposure variable was close to unity (0.01, -0.17 to 0.20) for subjects who had never been exposed to spousal ETS at home and 0.28 (-0.12 to 0.68) for those ever exposed. When spousal ETS exposure was examined in categories of time since last exposure, a gradient of higher risk was suggested with more recent ETS exposure and higher TWA radon exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the excess relative risk of lung cancer from radon exposure among never-smokers is similar to that among smokers, but that it may concern mainly those with ETS exposure at home. 351 METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES OF MONITORING THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN EUROPE PAUL WILKINSON, CAMPBELL-LENDRUM D, KUHN K, MENNE BET- TINA, HAINES A, PARR T, KOVATS SARI, BERTOLLINI R. London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. EMail: paul.wilkinson@lshtm.ac.uk McMichael and others have pointed out the multiple threats to human societies, both direct and indirect, posed by climate change. In Europe, the principal concerns are in relation to the direct effects of exposure to heat and cold, extreme weather events (storms and floods), food and water-borne illness and vector-borne disease. We have examined evidence on the pattern of these diseases and the methods of monitoring climate-driven changes in them as part of the NoLIMITS (Network of Long Term Integrated Moni? toring Sites) project. In principle, the process of climate shift should be reflected in corresponding and directly measurable changes in the basal frequency of climate-sensitive diseases, in their seasonal pattern (e.g. longer transmission seasons for certain diseases), or in their geographic distribution (e.g. shifts towards the poles or to higher altitudes). However, for most health impacts, acquisition of such evidence Eresents methodological challenges. Climate change is a gradual process and its ealth impacts are thus observable only over a period of decades. Moreover, most diseases show substantial year to year fluctuation, which means that long time-series are necessary for detecting the generally modest shifts in their underlying rates. But over the long term, changes occur in non-climatic risk factors (and perhaps also in disease detection/recording), which tends to modify or obscure the effects of climate-related change. For example, malaria, once widespread in Europe, has disappeared from all but a few areas over the last century while temperatures have risen: the effects of changes in land use, improved health care and other factors have predominated. Similarly, changes in deaths relating to thermal extremes are likely to have been modified by improvements in housing and social conditions, and altered human behaviours. Available data and methods more readily allow assessment of short-term climate and health associations, which, if used in conjunction with recorded or projected climate changes, can yield indirect estimates of their health impacts. The principal limitation of this approach is uncertainty over how such associations may be modified by gradual physiological acclimatization, behavioural adaptation, control interventions or other factors. However, comparisons of climate-disease associations and vector distributions in dif? ferent geographical locations can provide evidence on such modification, and it is evidence of this kind that may be most useful in assessing the future health risks of climate change and how they may be mitigated. 353 AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO CONDUCTING A SYMP? TOM AND DISEASE PREVALENCE STUDY IN A COMMUNITY NEAR A HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE ROBIN M. WAGNER, PARKER P, CANTERBURY T, WHITE M. atsdr. EMail: riw8@cdc.gov When communities discover they may be exposed to chemicals at a hazardous waste site (HWS), they often request assistance from health agencies. Fre- quently, an approach used has been to conduct a prevalence survey, which compares the potentially exposed to a nonexposed group on a large number of self-reported symptoms and diseases. Such studies often lack hypotheses, have poor exposure measures, and yield a high proportion of positive findings in a variety of organ systems, limiting their interpretation and, thus, value to communities. In a Massachusetts community where children attended schools located on a HWS, activists outside the school system demanded that the federal health agency, ATSDR, conduct a prevalence survey. Instead, ATSDR turned to the affected school community, which requested a survey of community needs be conducted to help identify appropriate follow-up actions. The survey assessed parents' concerns about potential exposures and health problems in their chil? dren who attended these schools. The survey also asked parents to select services, including health studies, they would like provided. The survey was mailed to all households in the affected school system (N=1554) and was conducted by local school organizations. ATSDR's role was limited to technical assistance. While parents reported relatively few health problems existed in their children, they were very concerned about their children's future health. Parents also indicated concern about possible exposures occurring in the schools. The most desired service, chosen by 92% of responding households, was an evaluation of environmental contaminants at the schools. Health studies that could link illnesses to specific chemical exposures were also desired (79%). However, descriptive studies that could not link illnesses to specific exposures - the design typically employed in symptom and disease prevalence studies - were the least favored service (22%). Assessing the affected community's needs improved ATSDR's ability to address community concerns. Environmental contaminants at the schools are being evaluated for the community. This effort also demonstrated that local involvement enhances community participation and acceptance of the results. The survey response rate was sufficiently high (67%) to be viewed as a community mandate. Other steps fostering acceptance included mailing the survey results to all parents in the school system, foilowed by holding meetings with parents to discuss the results. Althougn this approach requires considerable resources and highly moti- vated local partners, its rewards are potentially great. It is recommended that health agencies consider this altemative to help guide their public health actions, when feasible and appropriate.</page><page sequence="109">S110 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 355 ENHANCED COMMUNITY CANCER SURVEILLANCE USING GIS AND ECOLOGIC ANALYSIS: BREAST CANCER ON CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS NANCY MAXWELL, MELLY S, GARDNER J, SOTO C, SPAULDING C, BRODY JULIA. Silent Spring Institute. EMail: nmaxwell@silentspring.org We combined epidemiologic and computerized mapping approaches to probe local patterns of breast cancer incidence on Cape Cod as they relate to environmental and social factors. Environmental factors of concern on Cape Cod include pesticide use and patterns of residential development that put drinking water at risk of contamination by domestic wastewater. Social factors of interest include socioeconomic status and the rapid population growth that the Cape has experienced in recent decades. Using US Census and geographic data on population, income, education, housing units, drink? ing water supply, sewerage, residential land use, cranberry bogs, and land uses subject to regular pesticide spraying, we defined key characteristics of small areas. On the basis of these characteristics, we then used a GIS algorithm to combine small areas into surveillance units that optimize the tradeoff be? tween geographic resolution and statistical stability, and also have some environmental and social reality as places. Surveillance units defined in this way have adequate population to allow the detection of a specified elevation in breast cancer incidence, and have greater internal homogeneity, enhanc- ing ecologic analyses. We calculated standardized incidence ratios for the newly defined surveillance units and assessed associations between incidence and environmental and social factors. To complement the correlation and regression approaches of ecologic epidemiology, we used GIS approaches including map comparison methods and map animation. 357 RISK FACTORS FOR GIARDIA INTESTINALIS INFECTION IN AGRICULTURAL VILLAGES PRACTICING WASTEWATER IR- RIGATION IN MEXICO MARIANA GOMEZ CAMPONOVO, CIFUENTES ENRIQUE, TELLEZ- ROJO M, ROMIEU I, RUIZ-VELAZCO SILVIA.

Exposure groups included 2,257 individ? uals from households exposed to untreated wastewater, 2,147 from a group using the effluent from a series of reservoirs, and 2,344 from rain-fed agricultural villages. Stool samples were collected from 6,748 individuals. Wastewater samples were tested for fecal coliforms/100 ml and Giardia sp. cysts/L. Untreated wastewater samples contained 10A8 fecal coliforms/100 ml and up to 300 Giardia sp. cysts/L. Hydraulic retention (3-7 months) in the reservoirs, however, provided an improved effluent quality (10A4-10 fecal coliforms/100 ml and =&lt; 5 Giardia sp.cysts/L). Children 1?14 years of age had the highest prevalence of infection (20%). Data showed marginal associations between storing drinking water in unprotected containers and lack of facilities for feces disposal and the risk of infection (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.76 and 1.95, 95 % confidence intervals [CLs] = 0.95 - 3.23, and 0.97-1.45, respectively). Individuals purchasing vegetables at the city mar- ket had higher rates of infection than those buying at the village shop (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.00-6.17). No excess risk was found in individuals exposed to untreated wastewater compared with controls (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.84-1.36); the group using reservoir water was not different from the controls (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.94-1.58). No risk from agricultural activities was detected (OR = 0.83). This pattern of infection may be addressed by primary health care and wastewater treatment. 356 EVALUATION OF TASK-BASED INTERVIEWS IN A CHILD? HOOD LEUKEMIA STUDY Kyndaron Reinier, S. Katherine Hammond, Jan Kirsch, Patricia Buffler. Studies of childhood leukemia indicate that parental occupational exposures may be related to risk of childhood leukemia, but this association remains controversial. In an ongoing case-control study of childhood leukemia, nineteen task-based occupational interviews ("job modules") were devel? oped to collect detailed information about selected jobs based on the potential for exposure to chemicals of interest. Beginning in January 2000, these job modules will be administered as part of an in-home interview. Parental job history data from 331 cases and controls accrued from 1996 to 1999 was used to estimate the number of job modules needed per family to characterize occupational exposures from a year before the child's birth to the child's third birthday. Approximately 25% of all parents' jobs in the period of interest required a job module; 75% were deemed to have no potential for exposures of interest. Fathers were more likely than mothers to have a job requiring a module. Accounting for jobs held by both parents, approximately 40% of families required no module, 38% required one, and another 17% required two modules. Based on these data, with each job module designed to take no longer than 20 minutes, a detailed assessment of occupational exposures can be gathered for 95% of families in 40 minutes or less. The performance of the job modules in characterizing exposures was assessed in a pilot study with sixty-seven study participants in 1999. There was considerable variability in the job tasks performed by respondents with the same job title. The six mechanics interviewed performed from 33% to 100% of twelve tasks, while five medical workers performed from 10% to 40% of fourteen tasks. To determine whether exposures assigned using these task-based modules differ from exposures assigned using a job exposure matrix, parents' jobs were coded using U.S. census occupation and industry codes, and a job exposure matrix was used to assign exposures to selected chemicals for each parent. The results of this comparison will be presented. 358 A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY OF WATER DISINFEC? TION BY-PRODUCTS AND ADVERSE HUMAN BIRTH OUT? COMES IN GREAT BRITAIN MIREILLE B. TOLEDANO, ELLIOTT PAUL, NIEUWENHUIJSEN MARK J., WHITAKER HEATHER, BEST NICOLA G., COCKINGS SAMANTHA, JARUP LARS, FAWELL JOHN. Small Area Health Sta? tistics Unit, Imperial College,. EMail: m.toledano@ic.ac.uk Background: Concern about the potential health effects of the by-products of chlorination has prompted the investigation of the possible association between exposure to these by-products and risk of adverse birth outcomes. To date, most of these studies have been carried out in the US and Canada. We have started the first UK study to examine this possible association, which will take into account UK specific factors using a retrospective cohort design. The design for this study was presented at the 11th Annual meeting of the ISEE in Athens in 1999. Methods: The first stage of this study has covered approximately 17 million people supplied by three water suppliers in England. The study period was 1992-1998. The study cohort comprised ca. one million births from the water regions under study and were identified from the national births and stillbirths registries, which are maintained by the Office for National Sta? tistics (ONS) and held at the UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU). The following outcomes were studied: stillbirths; low and very low birth weight; birth weight distribution; and sex ratio. Routinely measured total and individual trihalomethane (THM) levels were modelled to provide annual exposure estimates for each water zone. Each water supply zone, covering a population of &lt;50,000 people was subse- quently classified into one of three pre-defined exposure categories (low, medium, and high) with a probability estimate of misclassification. Exposure estimates were assigned to individuals by means of a postcode-water zone link that was created using Geographical Information Systems to allocate the study population to water supply zones. Analysis: Relations between expo? sure estimates and outcome data were modelled using Poisson regression, stratified by water company and year of birth, with adjustment for potential confounders such as socio-economic status (Carstairs index) and maternal age measured at the enumeration district level and individual level respec? tively. The main aim was to determine whether areas with high THM levels were associated with an increase in adverse birth outcomes relative to areas with low THM levels. Mapping of risk at the water zone level using Bayesian smoothing techniques was also undertaken. Results will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: A powerful retrospective cohort study to determine the relation between routinely collected THMs and birth outcomes is ongoing in the UK. Further work is being carried out to improve the exposure assessment.</page><page sequence="110">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S111 359 SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION OF ORCHIDOPEXY, AS A PROXY FOR CRYPTORCHIDISM, USING HOSPITAL ADMIS? SIONS DATA FOR ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND, 1992-1996 MIREILLE B. TOLEDANO, JARUP LARS, WAKEFIELD JON, HAN- SELL ANNA, QUINN MIKE, ELLIOTT PAUL. Small Area Health Sta? tistics Unit, Imperial College,. EMail: m.toledano@ic.ac.uk Background: Cryptorchidism describes the condition in which the testes have not descended normally into the scrotum during development. Recent reports have suggested increasing frequencies of this malformation, but the results are not conclusive because changing treatment procedures and diagnostic criteria may have influenced trends. Common aetiologic factors have been suggested for cryptorchidism and testicular cancer and it has been hypothesised that increas? ing levels of exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting agents may have contributed to increasing occurrences of cryptorchidism. Data on cryptorchidism are not currently collected as part of the national congenital anomalies registry for England and Wales. Hospital episode statistics (HES) may, however, be used to study the rates of orchidopexy, the operation carried out to correct for cryptorchidism. The primary aim of this study was to examine the temporal and geographical variations in orchidopexy rates in England and Scotland. Methods: Data were included for ages 0-14 years, grouped in 5-year age bands, for the five years 1992-1996. Temporal trends were examined using data from the English HES, Scottish Hospital Inpatient Statistics (SHIPS) and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Spatial trends were examined using data from HES and SHIPS at electoral ward level across England and Scotland. Poisson regression was used to examine for regional, urbanisation and socio-economic effects while Bayesian mapping techniques were used to assess spatial variability. Results: A 30% decline in hospital episodes for orchidopexy was identified over the study period that was apparent in all age groups and all regions to varying degrees. Orchidopexy rates were significantly different between regions (p=&lt;0.001) and between age groups and showed a significant trend, with rates declining with increasing age. There was significant heterogeneity (Potthoff and Whittinghill, p&lt; 0.0001) in the risk of orchidopexy across wards. Discussion: Interpretation of the decline in hospital episodes for orchidopexy should focus on three possible explanations: data artefact; changes in clinical/coding practice; and a real change in the incidence of cryptorchidism. The latter must also consider factors that introduce discrepanices between orchidopexy rates and cryptorchidism rates. The potential for underlying geographical variations in these factors, as well as in clinical practice from one hospital to another, highlight the constraints in using orchidopexy rates estimated from hospital episode statistics and the need for cautious interpretation. 361 URBAN-RURAL DIFFERENCES IN MORTALITY BY SEX, AGE AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS IN ITALY NICOLETTA DI TANNO, MARTUZZI M, MITIS FRANCESCO, TER- RACINI B, BERTOLLINI R. WHO. EMail: ndt@who.it Italy is composed by 103 provinces. With minor exceptions, the adminis? trative capital of the province is the largest town of that province. All towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants are the capital of the province except one. Within each province, age-standardized rate ratios between residents in the capital and in the rest of the province should reflect the impact of urban? ization on mortality. Such ratios have been estimated separately for males and females during 1992-94 for mortality from all causes and from some major causes. Marked differences in all cause mortality were noticed between the two sexes and among the 4 major Italian geographical areas (North West, North East, Centre, South). In men, provinces where mortality rates in the capital exceeded rates for the rest of the province were 46% in the North West, 50% in the North East, 89% in Central and 93% in Southern Italy. Corresponding figures for women were 38%, 59%, 78% and 67%. Results suggest that urbanization had an adverse effect which affected Southern Italy to a greater extent than Northern Italy, and that the effect was greater in men than in women particularly in the South. Analyses were also carried out on the distribution of mortality rates in the 103 province capitals for all ages, age &lt;65 and 65 + . For all ages, towns with rates exceeding the 75th percentile of the distribution were 29%, 27%, 11% and 37% in North West, North East, Central and Southern Italy among men; the corresponding proportions in women were 4%, 9%, 15% and 63%, with the difference appearing particularly relevant for women aged 65 + . These distributions suggest that factors related to urban lifestyle (most likely related to socioeconomic status) have a greater impact in women than in men and with a cohort effect, especially in Southern Italy. Interpretation of such complex data will be attempted using a model including variables representing socioeconomic status, rurality of the province and geographical area in addition to age and sex. 360 ATMOSPHERIC DISPERSION MODELLING TO ASSESS POPU? LATION EXPOSURE AROUND POINT SOURCES OF POLLU? TION IN THE TEESSIDE AREA (UK) ANA GROSSINHO, BOTTLE ALEX, AYLIN P, COLVILE R, JARUP LARS, ELLIOTT P. Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. EMail: a.grossinho@ic.ac.uk Objectives The aim of this paper is to present the use of the UK Air Dispersion Modelling System 2 air pollution model and Geographic Information Sys? tems to estimate population exposure to S02 and NOx from point source emissions in an industrial area of the UK. Methods The 98 percentile and long term average estimates of S02 and NOx levels for the Teesside area was estimated using emission data from 1996 provided by the Environment Agency, and statistically averaged meteorological data registered at the Boulmer Meteorological Office Station. Pollution estimates were produced taking into account the effect of fifty major sources in the industrial complex, including two coke works. Results were compared with monitored values registered at the Middlesbrough monitoring station. The model outputs were mapped on a grid with 1 km spatial resolution and imported into Arc/Info for census data, integration and extraction. Results The modelled pollution estimates suggest a non-circular distribution around the 50 modelled point sources, which reflect local topography and meteo? rological conditions. Conclusions This method potentially offers an improvement in the delineation of areas of exposure around an industrial complex in comparison with the traditional distance based methods. 362 EFFECT MATERNAL LEAD BURDEN ON INFANT WEIGH AND WEIGHT GAIN AT ONE MONTH OF AGE, AMONG BREAST-FED INFANTS. LUZ ELENA SANIN, GONZALEZ-COSSIO T, ROMIEU I, PETERSON K, RUIZ, PALAZUELOS E, HERNANDEZ-AVILA. Universidad Au? tonoma de Chihuahua. EMail: iromieu@insp3.insp.mx Introduction. Transfer of lead from the bones into blood increases during lactation. Because bone lead has a half-life of years-to-decades, lead remains a significant threat to the breast-fed infant, even long after cessation of external lead exposure. However, the effect of maternal lead burden on growth in breast-fed newborns is still unknown. This study examined early postnatal growth in a cohort of healthy breast-fed newborns in relation to maternal lead burden. Methods Lead levels were measured in 329 mother-infant pairs in uterus and at one month of age. Evaluation of the mothers at one month postpartum included lead measurements of the blood and bones (measured in the tibia and the patella). Blood lead was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy. Bone-lead was measured byl09cd KXRF. The primary parameters were weight gain from birth to 1 month of age and weight differences at one month of age, which were analyzed in relation to lead biomarkers and other infant and maternal covariates by linear regression models. Results During an average of 31 days of follow-up, the infant studied had an average weight gain of 33.1 g per-day (SD= 11.6). Mean infant (at birth and at 1 month of age) and maternal blood-lead levels were 6.8 ug/dL (SD=3.8); 5.6 ug/dL (SD=3.0); and 9.7 ug/dL (SD=4.1), respectively. Mean maternal bone-lead levels were 10.1 (SD=10.3) and 15.2 (SD=15.2) mg Pb/g bone mineral for tibia and patella, respectively. Both maternal blood and bone lead levels were significant predic? tors of infant blood lead levels. Infant blood lead levels were inversely associated with weight gain, with an estimated decline of 15.1 g per ug/dL of blood lead (95 % CI 1.8 to 28.3; p&lt;0.01). Patella lead levels significantly modified the effect of breast feeding on weight gain. Children who were exclusively breast-fed had significantly higher weight gains; however this gain decreased significantly with increasing levels of patella lead. Maternal patella lead and weight at one month of age were inversely associated. The regression analysis predicted a 3.6g (p&lt;0.01) decrease in weight at one month per unit of maternal patella lead levels. Conclusions Maternal lead burden is negatively associated with weight at one month and postnatal growth until 1 month of age. Although this growth delay was observed in healthy infants, postnatal growth retardation is potentially harmful. Additional studies are needed to better understand this source of exposure and to develop interventions to minimize its impact.</page><page sequence="111">S112 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 363 GEOGRAPHICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY OF PROSTATE AND TESTIC? ULAR CANCER IN GREAT BRITAIN MIREILLE B. TOLEDANO, JARUP LARS, WALLACE C, WAKEFIELD JON, ELLIOTT PAUL. Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Imperial Col? lege,. EMail: m.toledano@ic.ac.uk Background. The incidence rates of testicular and prostatic cancer have in? creased during recent years, possibly linked to environmental exposures. Since exposure to environmental carcinogens is unlikely to be evenly distributed geographically, this may give rise to geographical clustering of disease. The primary aim of this study was to examine the temporal and spatial variations in testicular and prostate cancer risk across Great Britain. Methods. Registrations for testicular cancer, ages 25 to 49, and prostate cancer, ages 45 to 64 were included. Temporal trends were examined for Great Britain between 1974-1997 and spatial trends across electoral wards, 1975 to 1991. Poisson regression was used to examine for regional, urbani- sation and socio-economic effects while Bayesian mapping techniques were used to assess spatial variability. Results. In Great Britain, the incidence of both cancers increased over the study period (1974-1991). For prostate cancer, in older men (55-64) the incidence rose from 37 (per 100,000) in 1974 to 58 in 1991, i.e. a 55 % increase over the 18 year period. For testicular cancer, there was an increase in incidence, from 6.5 to 11.1 in younger men (20-34), and from 5.6 to 9.7 in older men (35-49), i.e. an approximate doubling of the incidence over the study period. In contrast, there was a 50% decline in mortality for testicular cancer in both age groups and in the older age group for prostate cancer. There was a significantly lower testicular cancer risk with increasing social deprivation at the small area scale. There was an indication of geographical differences in both prostate and testic? ular cancer relative risks at a regional level, ranging from 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78-0.87) to 1.19 (95% CI: 1.12-1.27) across regions for prostate cancer and from 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.84) to 1.32 (95% CI: 1.25-1.38) for testicular cancer. As expected, there was significant heterogeneity in the risk for these conditions across wards, although the range of relative risks was narrow. Fur? thermore, an analysis within the NW Thames region did not indicate any geographical clustering for either cancer. Conclusion. The absence of any geographical clustering at small area scale argues against a strong geographically determined environmental factor operating in the aetiology of these two cancers, although problems of long latency periods and migration are likely to reduce the ability to detect any true variation. . 365 HOURLY VARIATION OF PERSONAL PM2.5 EXPOSURE AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN SUBJECTS WITH CORONARY HEART DISEASE TIMO LANKI, TIMONEN KIRSI L., VANNINEN ESKO, TIITTANEN PEKKA, PEKKANEN JUHA. National Public Health Institute. EMail: timo.lanki@ktl.fi The association between heart rate variability (HRV) and continuous per? sonal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was studied in Helsinki, Finland, in the framework of ULTRA study. The goal is to find out, whether short-term PM2.5 exposures have health relevance. 47 subjects (aged 54-83 yrs, all with documented stable coronary heart disease, 23 females) were foilowed for 6 months with biweekly clinical visits. During visits, ambulatory ECG was recorded during a fixed protocol including e.g. a 5-min period of paced breathing. Time and frequency domain analyses of HRV were con? ducted from 5-min samples. During the study, 24-h continuous personal PM2.5 exposure measurements were done with a photometer. Previous preliminary analyses have been done using fixed site daily average PM2.5 data. The most consistent associations of PM2.5 with HRV were observed during the paced breathing period. Thus the focus is on this period. The mean (range) 2-h average PM2.5 concentration was 12.0 (366) ju.g/m3 (n=275). Random intercept linear model assuming constant correlation within subjects, adjusting for day, time of the ECG recording, temperature, and barometric pressure, was used. Preliminary analyses of HRV show, that SDNN, r-MSSD or total power (or its components) have no clear associa? tion with 2, 4, 6, or 8 h lagged 2-h averages of PM2.5. The effect of relative humidity on the photometer will be examined, because it may hinder from finding association between HRV and PM2.5. 364 AREAS AT HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL RISK IN ITALY MARCO MARTUZZL BERTOLLINI ROBERTO, MITIS FRANCESCO, BIGGERI ANNIBALE. World Health Organization, European Centre for. EMail: mam@who.it The Italian Ministry of Environment has identified 15 areas throughout the country as at "high risk of environmental crisis". The areas host important industrial activities that may result in exposure to environmental pollutants among the residents, through occupation and the general environment. This presentation describes an on-going epidemiological study aimed at assessing the health of the populations residing in the areas, and evaluating the potential role of routinely collected data in developing public health policies in an industrialised country of the European Region of WHO. Mortality data for the period 1981-1994 are retrieved from the ISTAT database at the level of munici? pality. Several causes of mortality are studied. Rates and SMRs are tabulated for the areas, for all residents and, for removing migration effects, restricted to people born locally. The geographical distribution within areas, time trends, and birth cohort effects are also investigated. Several analyses are also carried out allowing for potential confounding effects due socio-economic deprivation.. Preliminary results suggest that, in some of the areas but not in all, excess mortality is observed for several causes of death. In many instances excesses can be ascribed to known exposures (occupational or environmental) known to have occurred, although this is not always the case. Geographical heter? ogeneity and significant time trends are also observed in numerous cases. Socio-economic factors seem to play an important role in the relationship between environment and health. These findings indicate that the populations who live in areas known for their compromised environmental conditions have mortality rates higher than expected for some causes. In some areas, further data at higher geo? graphical resolution is being collected in order to evaluate the informative- ness of municipality data. Results will be evaluated with special reference to their implications for public health decision making. 366 SURVEY OF THE PROJECT "HEALTHY COMMUNITIES FOR EM- POWERING WOMEN'S HEALTH" ANDREI-DUMITRU IACOBAS, VERMAN DANIEL. Ovidius Univer? sity, Medicine, Constanta, Romania. EMail: iacobas@medcon.ro Background: On September 15, 1998, the American International Health Alliance (AIHA) and the United States Agency for International Devel? opment (USAID) award a grant to the Humana Foundation and the Uni? versity of Louisville, Kentucky, to establish a healthy communities project in women's health with partners in Constanta, Romania. The Jefferson County Health Department is an integral partner in the project. The project consists in two phases and has a duration of two years: 1998-2000. Project objectives: i. To improve women health in Constanta, Romania; ii. To educate and prevent disease in the entire community by providing social marketing through health education and prevention material and messages; iii. To reduce the domestic violence by public awarness campaign and training program to educate personnel from medicine, law enforcement, criminal justice, education and other key community representatives, including government, to recognize the signs of domestic violence, patterned injuries, and what can be done to help. Managing of the Project: The Coordinating Committee established and con? vened six work teams: the Survey Team, the Breast Cancer Outreach Team, the Mass Media Relations Team, the Health Promotion and Education Team, the Health Care Finance Team, and the Community Empowerment team. Survey Team developed and administered the first survey in the women community of Constanta in January-June 1999, as well as the second one in Spring 2000. The activities included the pretesting of the instrument, the typing and printing the final survey, training of medical school students to administer the survey, introducing, processing and interpreting the data. Procedure: Women (&gt; 16 years old) stable population size of the city of Constanta is 130,799. The random quota sample size, in 95% confidence level, is 1,184, when the expected frequency of answer is 50% (worst acceptable 10%). We questioned 1,188 women, with 96% rate of answer. The multiple-choice questionnaire contained 124 questions, orga? nized in 13 sections. Section A: Self perception of health and life quality (22 questions), Section B: Medical Self Care Services (16 questions), Section C: Con? traception and Family Planning (13 questions), Section D: Smoking (6 questions), Section E: Alcohol and drugs (8 questions), Section F: Safe and Domestic Violence (16 questions), Section G: Early Detection of Diseases and Women Health Prob? lems (10 questions), Section H: Nutrition (4 questions), Section I: Mental Health and Depression (10 questions), Section J: Health and Safe at Work (7 questions), Section K: Community Health Problems and Life Quality (1 questions), Section L: Demography (7 questions), Section M: Suggestions (1 questions). Results: i. it elicited community input to identify top issues; ii. improved community' knowledge and practice of healthy lifestyles; iii. held regular meet? ings of community workgroups and issues specific sub-groups to help guide the assessment process; iv. involved members of the community in the program; v. instilled community ownership. In this final year of the project grant, the Constanta Health Promotions Team will assume the lead role in the partnership to ensure a smooth transition of the Healthy Communities project from an AIHA Partnership Program to a sustainable community supported program.</page><page sequence="112">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S113 367 ENVIRONMENTAL LEAD EXPOSURE AND CA(2+)MG(2+)-AT- PASE ACTIVITY IN MATERNAL AND CORD BLOOD DAVE CAMPAGNA, HUEL GUY, HELIER GEORGETTE, GIRARD FRANCOISE, SAHUQUILLO JOSIANE, FAGOT-CAMPAGNA ANNE, GODIN JEAN, BLOT PHILIPPE. French National Institute of Medical Research and. EMail: DTC2@CDC.GOV Lead poisoning induces hematological, gastrointestinal and neurological dysfunctions. One of the potential mechanisms is the inhibition of Ca(2 + )Mg(2 + )-ATPase activity, a transmembrane enzyme. We investi? gated the effects of an environmental low lead exposure on Ca(2 + )Mg(2 + )- ATPase activity in 247 mothers and their newborns in North-East Paris. Cord and mother blood, and newborn and mother hair were sampled at delivery. Geometric means for mother and cord blood lead (Pb-B) and for mother and newborn hair lead (Pb-H) levels were 6.3 and 4.8 ug/dL, and 1.7 and 1.1 ug/g. Means for mother and cord basal Ca(2+)Mg(2 + )-ATPase activities were 2442 and 2675 nM/mg/hr. Mother enzymatic activity was negatively related to her Pb-B and Pb-H levels and to the cord Pb-B and newborn Pb-H levels. Newborn enzymatic activity was negatively related to his Pb-H level only. Adjustment for gestational age; child's sex; mother's age at delivery; alcohol, coffee, and tea consumption; and smoking habits during pregnancy did not modify these relationships. The findings support the hypothesis that lead toxicity could be in part mediated by a reduction of Ca(2 + )Mg(2 + )-ATPase activity. This effect was observed in mothers and newborns at low environmental exposure. 369 FIRST AND SUBSEQUENT EPISODES OF WHEEZING BRONCHI? TIS FROM BIRTH TO 12 MONTHS: A FOLLOW-UP STUDY PAULINA PINO, WALTER,T, PADILLA A, VILLEGAS R, OYARZUN M, OLAETA I. University of Chile. EMail: ppino@machi.med.uchile.cl Introduction.-In Santiago, a highly polluted city, we have shown (ISEE 1998) that the risk of clinic visits for wheezing bronchitis (WB) increases with the rise of outdoor airborne particles, in infants 4 to 12 months of age. Objectives.-To characterize factors determining the incidence and timing of first and ensuing episodes of WB in the first year of life. Methods.-Infants (n=504) from community health clinics in the periphery of Santiago were foilowed with monthly well-child-care at the clinic and weekly home visits from birth to one year of age with ad lib access to project physicians. Eligibility criteria included birth weight above 3.0 Kg, no peri? natal events nor chronic disease; a consistent, literate caregiver and having never attended a nursery. The airborne particles and meteorological vari? ables were measured by the city network while Socio-economic status (SES), indoor pollution sources including environmental tobacco smoke exposure, were evaluated with a standardized questionnaire at home and serum coti? nine at 12 months. The first episode was considered as the first clinic visit with a diagnosis of WB. Survival analysis hazard ratios (HR) were calculated with Kaplan-Meyer and Cox regression. Results.- During the follow-up we identified 492 episodes of WB. 298 infants (60%) had at least one episode. Of these, 74 (25%) had a second one and 107 (36%) had 3 or more. Cox regression showed that male sex (HR=1.34; 95% CI. 1.05-1.71) , a rise of 10 ug/m3 of PM2.5 (HR=1.05; 95% CI. 1.01-1.09) and a lower socioeconomic status (HR=1.16; 95% CI. 1.07 - 1.25) increased the hazard of the first event of WB. However, introduction of meteorological variables - increases in humidity (HR=1.03; 95% CI. 1.01-1.04) and mean temperature (HR=.93; 95% CI. .90-.96) - abolished the effect of PM2.5 without affecting sex or SES. The effect of indoor contaminants, months of exclusive breast feeding and parental history of asthma were not significant in this model. The analysis of factors affecting the occurrence of the second and three or more episodes will be contrasted with the first. Conclusion.-Meteorological variables may modulate the HR impact of PM2.5 on the first episode of WB in infants. 368 IDENTIFIYING COMPONENTS OF SEASONAL VARIATION IN MORTALITY BEN ARMSTRONG, WILKINSON PAUL, STEVENSON SIMON. lon? don school of hygiene and tropical medicine. EMail: b.armstrong@lshtm.ac.uk BACKGROUND. It is well known that mortality rates vary across seasons, particularly strongly in Britain. The extent to which this variation is ex? plained by specific risk factors is not known. OBJECTIVES. To identify specific causes for seasonal variation in cardio? vascular disease (CVD) mortality in Britain. METHODS. Data comprised daily deaths from CVD (mean 77) in London from 1990 to 1997, along with daily measures of temperature, other mete- orology, and black smoke; and weekly influenza reports. We investigated the association of daily mortality with season and seasonally varying factors, using Poisson regression methods adapted for time series. We modelled effects of season, defined as patterns repeated annually, with Fourier terms up to the sixth harmonic; other long/medium term variation with a cubic spline (3 terms /year); and specific variables. Distributed lag models were consid? ered for temperature, and simple lags for pollution and influenza. Proportion of deaths attributable to variables or groups of variables, assuming all values were reduced to their minimum risk level, were estimated using standard methods (Bruzzi AJE 1985). RESULTS. When no specific determinants were considered (but allowing for long term trends), peak-to-trough seasonal mortality ratio was 1.41, with 14.2% of deaths attributable to season. On including low temperature along with the Fourier terms for season, these figures reduced to 1.14 and 5.7%. On further including influenza reports, black smoke, and high temperatures these figures changed to 1.13 and 5.2%. regression coefficients and attrib? utable fractions (AF) for the variables in this model were: 1. low (&lt;19) maximum daily temperatures over the previous three weeks: 2.5% increase per degree, AF=12.0%, 2. black smoke on the same day: 0.9% for 5th -95th centile AF=1.0%, 3. influenza: 0.4% for 5th-95th centiie,AF=0.7%, 4. high (&gt;29) temperatures on the same day: 4.0% per degree, AF= 0.2%. CONCLUSIONS. Most of the seasonal variation of CVD mortality, at least in London, is explained by temperature effects. The number of excess deaths is substantial. The fact that countries with other more severe winters have smaller seasonal variation suggests that many of the excess deaths are avoidable. 370 MORTALITY IN THE COKE/STEEL-MAKING TOWN OF SYD?

EMail: mcamus@videotron.ca Until 1988, the air of Sydney (Nova-Scotia, Canada) was heavily polluted by metals and gases emitted by a coke oven and a steel foundry. A creek pouring into Sydney's harbour was used as a waste site. Now dubbed "the Sydney Tar Ponds", it is heavily contaminated with PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), solvents, and various heavy metals. In the early 1980s, high levels of contaminants in the sea fauna lead to a fishing ban. Populations may have been contaminated through respiratory, digestive and cutaneous routes. Previous reports have shown excess cancer mortality in the area, but were limited by short observation periods, biased comparisons, and residential misclassification. OB? JECTIVES: To assess the health impact of past and present pollution in Sydney, a comprehensive health impact assessment plan was developed by citizens groups and govemmental partners. In the exploratory "Phase I" of the plan, an ecologic mortality study covering 44 years of data (1951?94) was conducted to screen which of 120 causes of death suggested Sydney-specific risks relative to the surrounding and socio-economically comparable Cape Breton County. METHODS: Local mortality rates were corrected after assessing residential misclassification errors from a review of all death certificate data, using GIS tools. SMRs were computed using Canadian rates, and a Poisson chi-square statistic was used to test whether SMRs were significantly higher (P&lt;=.05) in Sydney relative to Cape Breton County excluding Sydney. RESULTS: There was no excess mortality among the population 0 to 14 years of age. Among adults, some SMRs were significantly higher in Sydney than in CBC: "all cancers" (SMR ratio=1.05), cancers ofthe salivary glands(2.4), esophagus(1.3) and colon(1.3), multiple myeloma(1.8), ill-defmed and secondary cancers(1.3), diabetes in males(1.6), multiple sclerosis(1.8), asthma(1.4), liver diseases(1.3). Many more SMRs were significantly elevated relative to Canada but not relative to surrounding CBC. CONCLUSION: These excess risks suggested Sydney- specific health problems but could not be attributed to specific pollution factors. Because this mortality study was less biased, more sensitive and more specific than previous ones, the observed excess risks had a greater impact on health decisions and research. They justified and were used to design well-focused case-control studies for the health impact assessment's "Phase II". Phase II is under way and will test specific occupational, environmental and life style hypotheses with a better control of potential confounders.</page><page sequence="113">S114 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 371 MATERNAL ORGANOCHLORINE BLOOD LEVELS IN ARCTIC CANADA IODY WALKER, SEDDON L, CORRIVEAU A, VAN OOSTDAM J, MCMULLEN E, MILLS C, WEBER J. formerly Government of the North- west Territories,.

Dept Epidemiology, UNC-Chapel Hill. EMail: ihp@unc.edu Even though high air pollution has been associated with increased infant mortality, reproductive and immunologic effects have not been well studied. Using data from the Teplice Program in the Czech Republic, markers of immune status were evaluated in pregnant women from two regions: Teplice, a polluted coal-mining district, and Prachatice, a district with lower pollu? tion. Maternal and cord blood specimens were collected at delivery and serum was extracted for immunoglobulin determination by nephelometry. Interviews obtained lifestyle, occupational and reproductive information. Data on medical risk factors and on labor and delivery were also abstracted. This report is based on births from 1994-1996. Teplice women were younger, less educated, and more likely to be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. Multiple linear regression was used to adjust for season, parental education, medications during labor, and other pregnancy risk factors. Levels of IgG in maternal and cord blood and maternal IgA and cord IgE were similar between the two districts. Teplice mothers had higher levels of IgE (Adjusted difference=79.1 IU/ml; SE=36.42) than those in Prachatice. Levels for maternal IgM were also higher in Teplice (Adjusted difference=0.41 g/L; SE=0.13). Given previ? ously reported alterations in the percentages of T and NK lymphocites by district, these results provide further evidence that air pollution may influ? ence immune status. This study was supported by the Czech Ministry of Environment (Teplice Program II-VaV 340/1/1997), the USEPA (CR#820076), USAID and Com? mission of European Community. 372 AIR POLLUTION AND SERUM MARKERS OF CARDIOVASCU? LAR RISK I SCHWARTZ. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: jschwrtz@hsph.harvard.edu Recent attention has focussed on how air pollution could be associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Several recent authors have reported association of airborne particles with electrocardiogram changes and serum changes that convey increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This paper seeks to replicate those findings in a large national sample. I merged air pollution concentrations to subjects in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in the US, and examined their association with fibrinogen levels (mg/dl), and counts of platelets and white blood cells. Regressions controlled for age, race, sex, body mass index, current smoking, and cigarettes per day. The complex survey design was dealt with using mixed models, with a random sampling site effect. In single pollutant models, PM10 was associated with all three outcomes (p&lt; 0.05). S02 was significantly associated only with white cell counts, N02 only with platelet counts, and 03 with none of the outcomes. In two pollutant models, PM10 remained a significant predictor of white cell counts controlling for S02, but not vice versa. PM10 was marginally significant in a model for platelet counts with N02, and the sign of the N02 coefficient reversed. These results were stable with control for indoor exposures (wood stoves, ETS, gas stoves, fireplaces), dietary risk factors (saturated fat, alcohol, caffeine intake, n-3 fatty acids), and serum cholesterol. The magnitude of the effects (e.g. 13 mg/dl fibrinogen for an interquartile range change in PM10, 95% CI 4.6-22.1 mg/dl) are modest. However the odds ratio of being in the top 10% of fibrinogen for the same interquartile range change was 1.97. These effects provide considerable biological plausibility to the mor? tality studies. 375 IMPACT OF AMBIENT HYDROGEN SULFIDE AND TOTAL RE? DUCED SULFUR LEVELS ON HOSPITAL VISITS FOR RESPIRA? TORY DISEASE IN DAKOTA CITY AND SOUTH SIOUX CITY, NEBRASKA, DURING 1998 AND 1999 DAVE CAMPAGNA, LEWIN MICHAEL D, INSERRA STEVEN G, PHIFER BETTY L, WHITE MARY C. Division of Health Studies, Agency for Toxic. EMail: DTC2@CDC.GOV Background. In response to public concern about respiratory diseases in Dakota City and South Sioux City, Nebraska, the Agency for Toxic Sub? stances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), conducted a study using hospital records to examine the relationship between respiratory diseases and ambi? ent measures of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and total reduced sulfur (TRS) (a combined concentration of sulfur in air from H2S, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide). Methods. Information on outpatient and inpatient visits for respiratory diseases (ICD-9 codes 460.0 through 519.9) during 1998 and 1999 was obtained from two local hospitals. During the same period, 16 H2S and 3 TRS monitors placed in selected locations recorded ambient and indoor concentrations on a continuous basis. The relationship between H2S and TRS measurements and the daily number of hospital visits will be assessed using Poisson regression models, which will control for climatic variables. To assess potential short- and long-term effects, air pollution levels will be analyzed in relation to hospital visits for respiratory diseases during the same exposure day, and the 2 following days. As a comparison, we will also examined hospital visits for digestive diseases (ICD-9 codes 520.0 through 579.0), which have no plausible relationship with exposure to H2S and TRS. Results. Contaminant levels measured in Dakota City and South Sioux City varied with the seasons, with the highest values measured during the summer months. Four monitoring locations recorded peak concentrations of H2S greater than 90 parts per billion (ppb), the ceiling limit of detection. Other residential monitoring locations recorded multiple peak levels of H2S be? tween 30 and 50 ppb. Compared to indoor concentrations, ambient levels of H2S were higher in concentration but shorter in duration. During the first 22 months of the study period, there were 2,573 visits for respiratory disease and 1,516 visits for digestive disease. Conclusions. The health effects of ambient low exposure to H2S among the general population, and in particular among children and elderly, are still unknown. The existence of multiple ambient air measurements of contam? inants on a daily basis in these communities offer a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between H2S or TRS and hospital visits for respiratory illnesses using time-series methods. The results will be presented.</page><page sequence="114">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S115 377 MEASUREMENTS OF PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO NITROGEN DIOXIDE IN FOUR MEXICAN CITIES IN 1996.

EMail: iromieu@insp3.insp.mx Nitrogen dioxide (N02) is a ubiquitous pollutant in urban areas, indoor N02 concentrations are influenced by both penetration of outdoor concen? trations and by indoor sources. The objectives of this study were to evaluate personal exposure to N02, taking into account human time-activity patterns in four Mexican cities. Passive filter badges were used for N02 indoor, outdoor and personal measurements over 48 hrs, and indoor workplace measurements over 16 hours. Precision in the study was determined with replicate samples. Volunteers completed a questionnaire on exposure factors as well as a time-activity diary during the sample period. To compare differences among cities and mean personal concentrations among housing characteristics, as well as determine which variables predicted the personal N02 concentration, an unpaired t-test, ANOVA analysis and a linear regression were performed. Sampling periods were in April, May and June, (1996) in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Cuemavaca and Monterrey. All 122 volunteers in the study were working adults, with a mean age of 34 (SD?7.38), 68% were female; the majority worked in public offices and universities. The highest personal N02 concentrations were found in resi? dents of Mexico City (median = 40 ppb) and the lowest in residents those of Monterrey (median = 24 ppb), significant differences were found among the cities in different microenvironments. During the sampling period, volunteers spent 85% of their time indoors. The highest personal N02 concentration was found when volunteers kept their windows closed (p=0.05). In the regression model adjusted by city and gender, the best predictors of personal N02 concentration were outdoor N02 ambient levels (beta= 0.23) and indoor concentrations (beta = 0.08)). These findings suggested an important influence of outdoor N02 concentrations in the personal exposure to N02 due to the specific characteristics and behavior of the people in these Mexican cities. 379 VALIDATION OF PARENTAL REPORTED SYMPTOMS ON ASTHMA AND WHEEZE IN SCHOOL CHILDREN EMMA LIVESLEY, GULLIVER JOHN, PICKARD GILL, BRIGGS DAVID, ELLIOTT PAUL. MRC Institute for Environment and Health, UK. EMail: ejl9@leicester.ac.uk Epidemiological studies regularly make use of questionnaire surveys to esti? mate the prevalence of respiratory disease and symptoms in selected popu? lations. This paper reports a cross sectional study on the association of urban air pollution with respiratory health in school children ascertained through parental completion of a health questionnaire. Validation of reported ques? tionnaire outcomes were assessed by spirometric testing (lung function) in a sub sample of children. Exposure to traffic-related pollution was estimated using a regression-based model (the SAVIAH method); modelled estimates were validated by com? parison with monitored data from 38 sites at which triplicate passive sam- plers were deployed, across the study area. Individual estimates of exposure at home, school and a weighted index combining both locations were compared against three key health outcomes: whistle or wheeze at any time in the past, whistle or wheeze in the last 12 months and doctor diagnosed asthma. The prevalence of symptoms as estimated by questionnaire response was 27%, 15% and 21%, respectively. No relationship between any of the symptoms and any of the health measures was found, either with or without control for confounding by socio-economic factors. Validation of the questionnaire findings was carried out using a randomly selected sub sample of children who were subject to spirometric testing, before and after 2 minutes of exercise. Exercise is one of the most common precipitating factors of acute attacks of asthma in children and is frequently used as a provocation test in its diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis was defined by exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), a 10% reduction of post exer? cise FEVl. Evaluation of the questionnaire response and spirometric testing was com? pleted by sensitivity and specificity analysis. The study emphasises the use of parental completed questionnaire surveys as an accurate and cost effective technique to obtain estimates of disease prevalence in large school popula? tions. Limitations however are likely to arise when different reporting definitions of symptoms are used between study populations. 378 PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AND TRANSIENT CHROMOSOME 7 IN- TERLOCUS (V(D)J) INVERSION HELEN MCDUFFIE, NORDAL R, KIRSCH I, NAKAHARA K.. Centre for Agricultural Medicine. EMail: mcduffie@sask.usask.ca Building a theoretical construct of cancer etiology using family history and incidence data related to a rare tumour, Knudson hypothesized (a) that cancer is a multi-step disorder; (b) that two or more events must occur in the same cell (or its daughters) and (c) that in those cancers with a strong hereditary component, one of the events occurs before conception. Exposure to chemical carcinogens was predicted by Knudson to be a potential inter- active risk factor for developing cancer. Both occupational exposure to specific pesticides and a positive family history of cancer have been associated with a heightened risk of developing certain tumours including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer and Hodgkin's disease. We evaluated several biological markers as measures of occupational exposure to pesticides. One of these was transient chromosome 7 interlocus V(D)J [variable-(diversity)-joining] in- versions which result in hybrid antigen receptor genes. We recruited volunteers with 10 or more hours per year of pesticide exposure (exposed) and age, sex and smoking pack year, pesticide unexposed volun? teers (unexposed). Potential subjects with medical conditions or exposures known to contribute to genetic instability were excluded. An administered questionnaire and pesticide use diaries were utilized. To evaluate the fre? quency of the V(D)J inversion, we obtained blood samples from 75 pesticide exposed people during spring, autumn and winter (234 samples) and from 51 urban-dwelling age, sex and smoking history matched controls (76 samples). A higher frequency of men compared to women tested positive at a dilution less than or equal to 250ng, the level which is outside of the standard population norm. Forty-eight percent (31/65) of exposed and 34% (15/44) of unexposed men tested positive while 30% (3/10) of exposed and 14% (1/7) of unexposed women were positive. Among positive exposed subjects, 7/31 men and 2/3 women tested positive at least twice at dilutions of 125 ng or less. Five of these subjects had a positive family history of cancer, five were allergic to various substances, all were occupationally exposed to herbicides, eight to insecticides and six to fungicides, two had worked for a long period in a building constructed over a pesticide disposal site and two were current smokers. Their positive tests did not appear to be temporally related to recent exposure to pesticides.

Centre for Agricultural Medicine. EMail: mcduffie@sask.usask.ca Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been associated with farming and agri? cultural exposures including specific herbicides and insecticides. The hypothesis that exposure to specific herbicides and/or insecticides is etiologically associated with NHL remains controversial. We conducted a Canadian multi-centre pop? ulation-based incident, NHL case (n = 517) - control (n = 1506) study among men. We collected lifetime occupational history including pesticide exposure by utilizing a self-report postal questionnaire followed by a telephone interview administered to those initially reporting exposure to pesticides of 10 hours per year or more and a 15% random sample of the remainder. We computed odds ratios (OR) using conditional logistic regression adjusted for the matching variables of age and province of residence. Among major chemical classes of pesticides, in univariate adjusted analyses, we found that risk of NHL was significantly increased by exposure to phenoxyherbicides, to dicamba containing herbicides and to carbamate and organophosphorus insecticides. Among indi? vidual active agents, risk was increased by exposure to the herbicide mecoprop and to the insecticides malathion, DDT, carbaryl, aldrin and lindane. Utilizing conditional logistic analyses which included in the model all covariates for which the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) excluded unity, we found that antecedent cancer, a family history of cancer among first degree relatives and exposure to mixtures containing the herbicide dicamba or mecoprop (a phe- noxyherbicide) and to aldrin (an organochloride insecticide) were statistically significant independent predictors of an increased risk of NHL while a personal history of measles and of allergy desensitization treatments were protective. Models which explored the relationships among the number of days per year of personally applying/mixing individual compounds and risk of NHL showed (a) no relationship to increasing days of exposure for bromoxynil; several phenoxy? herbicides including MCPA; 2,4-D and 2,4-DB; dicamba; diallate, triallate or treflan. (b) more rhan two days per year of exposure to glyphosate resulted in an OR (95% CI) of 2.11 (1.20, 3.72). (c) one or 2 days per year of exposure to mecoprop resulted in an OR (95% CI) of 2.22 (1.35,3.67) and more than 2 days per year of exposure to mecoprop resulted in an OR (95% CI) 2.05 (1.17, 3.60) consistent with the multivariate model.

New York University School of Medicine. EMail: thurston@env.med.nyu.edu An environmental and health database was constructed for Philadelphia, PA for the period 1992-1995 in order to assess the importance of PM components in mass associations with adverse health effects. PM data were collected by Harvard University for the U.S.EPA. Daily measurements included H+, S04=, PM2.5, PMIO, CoH, S02, 03, CO, N02, temperature and RH. Fine mass trace element data are also being analyzed for PM source contributions. Daily counts of hospital admissions and mortality were grouped: respiratory, cardiovascular, and total. Comparisons consider days when H+ measurements were made (during 1992-1993), in order to equalize power across pollutants. Poisson time-series regressions, controlled for season, day-of-week, holidays, and weather, were employed to determine PM component-health effect associations. Results indicate consistent air pollution-health effect associations across outcomes. Inter-correlations across pollutants prevented an unambiguous identification of one causal PM component. However, the PM2.5 mass was more consistently significant in regressions than the PM10-PM2.5 (coarse) mass. S04= and H+, indicators of acidic secondary aerosol PM, demon? strated associations that were more consistently significant across these health effect outcomes than was CoH (Coefficient of Haze, an index of carbonaceous primary particles). CoH was never significant, while H+ was significant for total and circulatory mortality, and had the highest t-statistic of all PM indices for respiratory deaths. PM2.5 and PMIO were also signif? icant, but not PM10-2.5. Ozone was the gas most consistently associated, but adding 03 to the PM regressions only modestly lowered PM estimates. The role of spatial and measurement errors was investigated by calculating CV's across available site pairs in the city. CoH was among the best measured (i.e., smallest spatial plus measurement error), but among the least significant in health regressions. Conversely, H+ was among the worst measured, but among the most often significant. In this city, fine particle PM2.5 mass is apparently driving the PMlO-health effects associations, and the PM2.5 secondary aerosol component plays the most significant role. Consideration of measurement errors accounted for much ofthe PM mass size fraction differences in significance, but they strengthen the argument that H+ is associated with mortality and morbidity in this city. There is a need for further investigations into the role of aerosol acidity in PM-health effects associations. ******** Funding from U.S.EPA Star Grant R825264 and U.S.EPA Cooperative Agreement CR827358 supported this work.

TION BETWEEN AIR POLLUTION AND DAILY DEATHS? ALFESIO BRAGA, SCHWARTZ J, ZANOBETTI A. Harvard School of Public Health. EMail: abraga@hsph.harvard.edu The role of Influenza epidemics on the reported associations between air pollution and mortality has been target of increasingly interest. In addition, other respiratory epidemics may effect mortality rates. In order to estimate the contribution of these infectious diseases to the air pollution health effects we carried out a time-series study using daily records of deaths for all ages obtained from four US cities: Chicago, IL (1988 - 1993), Detroit, Ml (1986 - 1993), New Haven, CT (1988 - 1992), and Spokane, WA (1986 - 1993). Daily levels of PMIO and weather measurements were used. City- specific analysis was estimated using Poison regression in generalized additive models, adjusting for time trend, temperature, dew point, barometric pressure and days of the week. Variables to control for infectious disease epidemics were created using pneumonia hospital admissions. Days with the number of admissions greater than the 90 percentile were defined as - epidemic days. Periods with at least 10 consecutive -epidemic days- were defined as epi? demics. A cubic polynomial was used for each epidemic period and a dummy variable was used to control for isolated epidemic days. A 10ug/m3 increase in PMIO (lagO-l) was associated with increased daily deaths in Detroit (0.87%, 95% CI: 0.60,1.14) and Chicago (0.84%, 95% CI: 0.57,1.11). When controlling for influenza epidemics no significant changes were ob? served (Detroit: 0.83% , 95% CI: 0.54,1.12; Chicago: 0.81%, 95% CI: 0.56,1.06). Even in the cities where the association between air pollution and deaths were not significant the control for influenza did not change the coefficients substantially (New Haven: from 0.66%, 95% CI: -0.08,1.40 to 0.52%, 95% CI: -0.24,1.28; Spokane: from 0.25%, 95% CI: -0.49,0.66 to 0.25%, 95% CI: -0.16,0.66). Using a random effects meta-analysis the overall effect of PM10 was 0.70% (95% CI: 0.46,0.94) per 10ug/m3 before controlling for epidemics and 0.68% (95% CI: 0.46,0.90) after. These results confirm the strength of the association between air pollution and adverse health effects.

Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Reg? istry. EMail: djw8@cdc.gov More and more residents of communities located near hazardous waste sites have expressed concern about the perceived high prevalence of certain types of autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, lupus) in their area. Not having their concern addressed in a meaningful manner is frustrating for the community, and also frustrating for public health officials. In order to address community health concerns regarding possible exposure to hazardous waste and disease outcomes, public health agencies examine available health data and compare community-wide rates of illness, diseases, and death with national and state rates. When a community identifies a cluster of a specific autoimmune disease, however, it is often difficult to address these concerns for several reasons. First, autoimmune diseases are not reportable and na? tional prevalence data are not readily available for comparison. Second, causal agent(s) of these disease have not been identified, although limited epidemiologic studies support both genetic and environmental components of susceptibility. Intense study of community-identified clusters have repeatedly failed to identify a specific causal agent(s). Often the small number of cases in such "clusters" limits the ability to differentiate between an excess of etiologic interest and a chance occurrence. However, it is important to seriously consider all such reports. This presentation will provide an overview of the various types of autoimmune diseases and what is currently known about the possible causes of these diseases. Data that are available on autoimmune disease incidence and prevalence will also be discussed, as well as the limitations of this information. Results from previous cluster investigations of autoimmune diseases will be reviewed, as well as the some of the diffi? culties public health agencies face when assessing such clusters.

Texas Department of Health. EMail: Judy.Henry@tdh.state.tx.us A reported cluster of multiple sclerosis (MS) in El Paso, Texas prompted an investigation by the Texas Department of Health, with funding from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. A 42 year-old former El Paso resident with MS contacted the Texas Department of Health to report an apparent "cluster" of MS cases among people who spent their childhoods in the Kern Place-Mission Hills area of El Paso. Fourteen of the fifteen individuals identified attended Mesita Elementary School, the local public elementary school and one attended private school. Of the 14 individuals who attended Mesita Elementary, 12 people reported a definite diagnosis of MS and 2 a diagnosis of probable MS. Applying national prevalence rate estimates of 102/100,000 to the estimated 3,100 students who attended the Mesita School from 1948-1970, approximately three cases of MS would be expected. The objectives of this study are: 1) to conduct a retrospective cohort study to determine if the cohort of students who attended Mesita Elementary have an increased prevalence of MS as compared with national prevalence rates; 2) evaluate the feasibility of expanding the study cohort to include a second elementary school with a primarily Hispanic population; and 3) evaluate the feasibility of obtaining historical environmental and biological sampling data and matching the data with the study cohort. This session will discuss the geographic area of interest for the study which includes two neighborhoods which are in the immediate vicinity of a smelter; historic environmental data, including emissions data from the smelter, soil and dust samples; historic biological data including blood lead data and childhood hair samples; and challenges associated with a retrospec? tive cohort study.

EMail: Stephan Wei? land &lt;weilans@nwz.uni-muenster.de&gt; We investigated the association between climatic conditions and the prev? alence of childhood asthma and allergies using data from 15 European countries who had participated in the ISAAC programme. In each study centre community random samples of children ages 13-14 years (57 centres) and 6-7 years (26 centres) were studied between 1992 and 1996 (appr. 3,000 per age group and study centre). Standardised written (WQ) and video questionnaires (VQ) on the prevalence of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic eczema during the last 12 months were completed by the adolescents (WQ and VQ) and parents of 6-7 year olds (only WQ). We abstracted longterm average data on climatic conditions from one standardized source 'The world weather guide' and calculated mixed linear regression models to take into account whether centres were located in the same or different country. All reported associations are statistically significant at the p&lt;0.05 level. In both age groups there was a positive association between latitude and the prevalence of eczema symp? toms; altitude was inversely related to the occurrence of asthma symptoms (WQ). Mean temperature was correlated only with eczema symptoms (neg? atively), while variability in annual temperature showed a negative associ? ation with symptoms of asthma (WQ) and rhinitis. Mean relative humidity was not related to any of the atopic symptoms. However, when the temper? ature was taken into account and a standardised relative humidity was estimated for an indoor temperature of 20C, the estimated indoor relative humidity was positively associated with the prevalence of asthma symptoms (VQ and WQ) in both age groups. These data suggest that climatic condi? tions may affect the prevalence of childhood asthma and allergies in chil? dren. 387 GEOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF SURVEY DATA : AN ENVI? RONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY TOOL. YVETTE BONVALOT, BOMN MARIE-CLAUDE, LABRtCHE FRANCE. Montreal Public Health Department. EMail: ybonvalo@santepub-mtl.qc.ca Introduction: One of the challenges of environmental epidemiology is ex? posure assessment of the potential causal factor under study. The first step of exposure assessment requires the ability to discriminate populations with different gradients of exposure. The work presented here became necessary in order to define exposure in terms of wood buming, in a restricted urban area, the Island of Montreal, the second largest city of Canada. Materials and Methods: To establish the prevalence of ownership of any wood buming appliance among Montreal families, we conducted a simple random telephone survey aiming at interviewing 1,000 families reporting any wood buming. The questionnaire asked, among other rhings, about reasons for buming wood and estimates of quantities bumed last year. The interviewed sample, 7,970 families, represented 1% ofthe number of dwell? ings on the Island. The initial question, and inclusion criterion, asked for the postal code which permitted geographical analysis. We subdivided the total area in squares of 500 m x 500 m and adjusted for the type of surface utilization (light industry, heavy industry, parks, etc.) and dwelling density by using data aggregation methods. Results: Small area maps of the Island of Montreal were produced with varying color intensities representing the ratio of users to non-users of wood buming appliances. This permitted the selection of exposed and non-exposed areas after taking into account winter winds direction, neighboring areas (presence of other sources of wood combustion such as wood oven bakeries and pizzerias), dwelling density, type of dwellings, high circulation streets, etc. The first analysis iden? tified 2 high-using areas on opposite sides of the Island, and several low-using ones. High-using areas were then discriminated according to the reason for wood buming, one of them using wood mainly for leisure purposes, and the other one as a main or secondary heating source. One low-using area was then selected upwind from any high-using area. Validation of the results: Two methods allowed a verification of the results: 1) on site inspecting the areas for the presence of residential wood buming systems and industrial or commercial sources of wood buming, and 2) as part of an environmental study of wood burning pollutant levels, we randomly telephoned about 200 families in each of a high and low using area and validated the prevalence of wood buming among each area. Conclusion: Geostatistical methods can prove to be extremely helpful in refining study areas in environmental epidemiology studies. 386 MICROBIOLOGICAL GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND HEALTH INDICATORS ENRIQUE CIFUENTES, MAZARIM M, CALVA J. National Institute of Public Health. EMail: ecifuent@insp3.insp.mx Groundwater quality was evaluated in the southern and western zones of Mexico City, using bacterial indicators and pathogens. Water quality from 40 wells was related to prevalence rates of diarrheal diseases through 995 individuals interviewed. The focus of this first study on environmental health indicators (EHI) was based on population data, such as drinking water supplies and basic sanitation; and displayed using a Geographic Information System (GIS). 60% of the wells monitored comply with the Mexican drinking water standards, although based on other microorganisms 95% of the wells did not provide good quality water for human consumption. No significant difference was detected among hydrogeological zones. When analyzing by microbial indicators, the southern and western area of the city showed statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.01). The highest rates of diarrheal diseases were detected in the south, the lowest rates were observed in the west. Although wells in the western side of the city appeared to be more contaminated (54%) than in the south (40%), no significant associ? ation with health indicators was detected. These preliminary findings suggest ways to improve the potential of EHI, by framing epidemiological data and use of GIS. 389 A MEDICAL FOLLOW UP OF IMMUNE BIOMARKERS IN CHIL? DREN WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS ROSALYN DHARA, SLADE B. ATSDR. EMail: ryd3@cdc.gov During the years 1991 through 1993, approximately 1,800 individuals aged 1 through 75 years participated in a multisite lead and cadmium exposure study conducted in four states (Pennsylvania, Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois) for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Similar data collection protocols for blood lead, urinary cadmium, complete immune panel (cellular and humoral parameters), and standardized questionnaires were used in each study area. Study participants were residents of commu? nities located near hazardous waste sites that were contaminated with heavy metals, as well as residents of comparison communities. A combined analysis identified 158 (8%) children aged 6 months to 10 years with blood lead levels 10 g/dL and approximately 60% of these children tested outside of the age-specific reference range in one or more of the ten immune tests that were administered. This 6-year medical follow-up study was conducted to identify changes in blood lead levels and to evaluate the long-term effects of lead exposure on immune function. Of the 158 participants of the original study who were eligible to participate in the follow up, 84 were located and 75 were enrolled for participation providing an overall participation rate of 89%. The sample members had an average age of 10.07 years, with an age range of 9.63 years. The sample was predominantly white (66%) and male (51%). Forty percent of participant's head of household had a high school education, with an income less than $15,000 (36%). Approximately 5% of the population had lived in their respective area of concern for less than 5 years; 45% more than 5 but less than 10 years; 45% more than 10 but less than 15 years; and the remaining 5% more than 15 years. However, the average length of residence of a participant child was approximately 9.5 years. Preliminary analyses include distribution of blood lead levels, distribution of complete blood parameters and immune markers. Additional analyses in? clude correlational analyses of selected immune biomarkers with current blood lead levels; comparison of selected blood count parameters from time 1 to time 2; comparison of selected immune cellular and humoral markers from time 1 to time 2; frequency distribution of Out of Standard Reference Range for selected immune markers at time 1 and time2; and finally change in the character of selected immune markers from time 1 to time 2 (Normal to normal, normal to abnormal, abnormal to normal, and abnormal to abnormal). All results will be presented.</page><page sequence="117">S118 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 390 GIS &amp; TRI: INTEGRATION FOR DISEASE PREVENTION RUTH ALLEN, CONOMOS M, POWERS M. U.S. Environmental Pro? tection Agency. EMail: allen.ruth@epa.gov The objectives are to achieve integration and ultimately disease prevention through the use of rapid advances in computing technologies. This is a complex task filled with statistical challenges, public concerns, scientific cautions, and the need to make powerful new distinctions in environmental health and epidemiology. The methods of this paper include case studies that describe results from ongoing environmental health and epidemiology projects in the United States at the state, county and town levels of analysis, e.g., from New York, Connecticut, Iowa, North Carolina and others loca? tions. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer application that is designed to manage, display and perform statistical analyses using geographic or spatially referenced data. The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data are collected for regulatory purposes, such as industry reported pounds of chemical released per square mile. The results include lessons learned where community members, industry and environmental leaders, and civii authorities representing particular area, and people with preexisting diseases that are sensitive to levels of pollution in their local environment are all interested in mining such data for insights that guide prevention and wise use of resources, but they do not always speak the same language. If the data are shown as total pounds released, total pounds released per person, or total pounds per square mile, completely different conclusions can be drawn by most casual observers. No amount of caveat or disclaimer is sufficient to avoid this issue and when the compounds are genotoxic, immunotoxic and carcinogenic pesticides, air or water pollutants, the need for a precautionary approach is heightened. The conclusions reveal specific needs for research and practical ways to make new and powerful distinctions among all these groups in their efforts to achieve prevention goals, and make better risk based decisions. 392 THE EFFECTS OF GREAT LAKES SPORT-CAUGHT FISH CON? SUMPTION ON BIRTHWEIGHT MARC WEISSKOPF, ANDERSON H, HANRAHAN L, KANAREK M. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. EMail: mvw5@cdc.gov Background: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyl di- chloroethene (DDE) are organochlorine compounds that have been associ? ated with a number of health effects of concern including low birthweight. A number of studies have demonstrated the positive correlation between sport-caught fish consumption and serum PCBs and DDE levels. In fact, sport-caught fish consumption is the major source of PCBs exposure for the general population. On the other hand, fish consumption can have a beneficial effect on birthweight. Therefore, we investigated the impact of maternal Great Lakes sport-caught fish (GLSCF) consumption on birth? weight. Methods: The Health Departments of five Great Lakes states? Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana?formed a consortium for the health assessment of Great Lakes sport fish consumption, which identified 1998 frequent and 1274 infrequent (less than 6 fish meals per year) GLSCF consumers households. Mothers from frequent GLSCF consumer households were administered a survey of fish consumption and reproductive history for children born after 1970. Mothers from infrequent GLSCF consumer house? holds were administered the reproductive history survey only. From this cohort we identified 644 singleton firstborn children for whom we had a reproductive history. We obtained birth records for 97% of these children. Results: Of these children, 415 were from frequent, and 229 from infrequent, GLSCF consumer households. Among frequent and infrequent GLSCF consumers the mean birthweight of these children was 3362?588g and 3357?478g, respectively, and each group had 6% under 2500g. Among frequent GLSCF consumers, mothers ate GLSCF fish for an average of 6.3?8yrs before the birth of their first child. The cohort was robust enough to identify known risk factors for low birthweight such as maternal age and the number of prenatal care visits. Conclusions: Preliminary analyses have not found a positive association between low birthweight children and increased GLSCF consumption. This presentation will consider the risk-benefit complexities in addressing the relationship between organochlorine contaminated GLSCF consumption, both before and during pregnancy, and birthweight. 391 HEALTH IMPACT FROM A WATER AND LAND RECLAMATION SYSTEM XOCHIMILCO, MEXICO ENRIQUE CIFUENTES, HURTADO M, JUAREZ L. National Institute of Public Health. EMail: ecifuent@insp3.insp.mx In response to public and official request, an initial assessment of health risk from a water reuse at the south outskirt of Mexico city was carried out. The effluent ofa secondary wastewater treatment plant (5 m3/sec) flows through? out a network of canals, and used to irrigate a more than 200 hectares of farming land, which also contributes to aquifer recharge. This study provided baseline information on the epidemiology of "sentinel" health events and their associations with water and sanitation related variables. Two cross- sectional surveys were conducted, in the rainy and the dry seasons 1996- 1997, respectively, and the target population were children aged 0 - 5 years. A total of 335 children were involved in the rainy season study, and data was gathered by means of questionnaires and parasitological tests. The health events reported in the paper include acute diarrhoeal diseases (episodes) and Crypstosporidium parvum intestinal infection. Water samples were collected from and canals, and tested for faecal coliforms and total coliforms. Pilot procedures (immunofluorescence and flow citometry) are being carried out for Crypstosporidium and Giardia in samples from the plant effluent and wells. Available results showed that the prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in children was 14.5%, whereas the prevalence of Crypstosporidium infection was 5.4%. Data showed that the risk of diarrhoeal diseases resulted higher among children from families farming vegetables (OR=5.4),. Those living in overcrowding dwellings (OR=7.5), and frequent water supply breakdowns (OR=2.9). The risk of Crypstosporidiosis was higher in children in the canals (OR=3.5), from households in which drinking water is stored in unprotected tanks and poor standards of domestic hygiene prevail (OR=2.99). According to current regulations, the treatment plant is com- plying with effluent quality bacterial requirements for unrestricted cropland irrigation; neverthless, high concentrations of bacterial indicators were de? tected throughout the canals, suggesting point-source discharges of untreated sewage. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy detected Cysts of Giardia in two wells and samples from the piant's effluent (before chlorina? tion). Oocysts of Crypstosporidium- Further research is being focussed on health risk from protozoal infections in children, as well as characterization of pathogens detected in canals (irrigation) and wells (groundwater) and drinking sources, containers and taps. 393 SPATIOTEMPORAL AND PREDICTIVE MODELLING OF AMBIENT PM10 CONCENTRATIONS FROM TSP MONITORING DATA DAVID KIM, MICHAEL JERRETT. McMaster University. EMail: kimd6@mcmaster.ca Background This research addresses the question of how to overcome sparse air pollution monitoring data to derive useful exposure estimates. The Region of Hamilton-Wentworth, located at the Western end of Lake Ontario in Canada, has temporally and spatially extensive total suspended particulate (TSP) data, but only a few monitoring stations for particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10). Recent studies have shown that PM10 accounts for more of the variation in mortality and morbidity than TSP. To overcome this data limita? tion, the relationship between PM10 and TSP at co-located air pollution monitoring sites is modeled to generate PM10 estimates for the entire Region. Methods A combination of regression and spatial modelling techniques were used to derive intra-regional estimates. First the intra-regional and temporal distribution of PM10, TSP, and the ratio of PM10/TSP were analyzed with ANOVA techniques. Second models that predict PM10 from TSP measures were developed using ordinary regression without a constant term. Third PM10 estimates from the regression models were interpolated to generate pollution surfaces for the Region. Methods tested to generate pollution surfaces included weighted moving averages, Thiessen polygons, and kriging. Results PM10 and TSP were found to vary significantly across season and station location. Significant variation was also found across station location and season for the PM10/TSP ratio. The regression coefficients were signif? icantly different, as measured by the Chow test, ranging from 0.31 to 0.39 (R2&amp;#61627;0.96 in all models). Preliminary kriging results showed that, compared to spatially disaggregated PM10 models, a region-wide model of PM10 under-predicted concentrations in downtown Hamilton and over- predicted in Eastern Hamilton. Continuous surfaces of PM10 generated from using other interpolation methods will be presented at the conference. Conclusion The significant spatial variation of PM10 suggests that correlation studies of air pollution and health should derive intra-regional urban population exposure to ambient particulate matter, as estimates based on region-wide averages may result in exposure misclassification. Geostatistical techniques and geographic information systems (GIS) can assist with assessing intra-regional exposures, but caution must be exercised to minimize error propogation.

FORNIA DAVID GOLDSMITH, MILLS PAUL K, CAMPELMAN S. George Wash? ington University. EMail: eohdfg@gwumc.edu Background: The link between environmental exposures and childhood cancer is a vital public health concern especially in Central Valley (CV) of California-a major agricultural region where pesticide use is extensive. To assess regional trends in childhood cancer incidence, we used data from Cancer Registry of Central California contrasted them with state and na? tional pediatric leukemia rates. Methods: Age-, sex- and ethnic-specific (Hispanic versus nonHispanic whites) leukemia incidence in children aged 0 to 19 years were compared with the Central Valley (CV) of California, the entire state of California, and for U.S. California data were from California Cancer Registry (CCR) for years 1991 to 1995, and U.S. data were from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute for 1987 to 1991. Results: For males, aged 0 to 19 years, CV children have higher leukemia incidence than all California children, who in tum have higher risks than U.S. children. The risk differential appears largest in males 15-19 years where the rate in CV is 6.5/100,000 versus 2.6/100,000 in the U.S. For females, the same pattern is true with the exception of the 5-9 year old age group, where CV rates are less than California and U.S. rates. The same patterns generally hold true when examining Hispanic and nonHispanic white children. When histology is compared, the risk appears to be higher for acute myelocytic leukemia comparing California to U.S. (2.6/100,000 versus 2.3/100,000), but approximately the same for acute lymphocytic leukemia (-1.7/100,000). Conclusions: The findings suggest that children from CV have higher leukemia incidence than children from the whole state of California or from U.S, and these results are consistent for both Hispanics and nonHispanic whites. Case-control studies including detailed pesticide and agricultural chemical exposure assessments on children and their parents are being planned. 396 PARAOCCUPATIONAL LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN UN? DER 6 YEARS OLD OF REPAIR RADIATORS WORKERS IN MO- RELOS STATE, MEXICO AGUILAR-GARDUISlO CLEMENTE, AGUILAR-MADRID G, LACASANA M, TELLEZ-ROJO M, SANfN-AGUIRRE LH, ROMIEU I, HERNANDEZ-AVILA M. National Institute of Public Health. EMail: clemente@insp3.insp.mx Introduction: The repair of automobile radiators is an activity that is usually carried out in small workshops, habitually located near or in the workers' houses, that makes evident the lack of control measures and surveillance of lead exposure, that may increase the para-occupational exposure (risk transference to the workers' homes). Of particular concern are the reports on the existence of more than enough pediatric poisonings due to paraoccupational lead exposure. Objective: To evaluate the main predictors of blood lead levels in children, under 6 years old, sons of repair radiators workers in the Morelos State, Mexico. Methods: We carried out a cross sectional study to evaluate the main determinants of blood lead levels in children, under 6 years old, sons of these workers. The mothers of these children filled out a questionnaire on predic? tors of blood lead levels including daily calcium intake. Lead levels were determined from the capillarity blood samples with the field kit Lead Care, developed by CDC. We also carried out the determination of dust lead of their homes floors. Results: The mean of blood lead levels in the exposed children group was 17.08 ug/dl (range 3.1-66 ug/dl), and in the non-exposed group was 7.36 08 ug/dl (range 0.4 - 16.5 ug/dl). This difference was statisticaly significant (p&lt;0.001). Multivariate models were constructed including variables that were related to blood lead levels (based on bivariates models) and potential confounding factors of the association of blood lead levels and living in the workers' houses . Our final model to predict blood lead levels included living in the workers' houses (B 0.76, 95% IC [0.42, 1.094]), picca habit (B 0.36, 95% IC [-0.16, 0.88]), cottage industry (B 0.53, 95% IC [0.005, 1.06]) and gender (B 0.35, 95% IC [0.02, 0.68]). The goodness of fit of our final model was evaluated using analysis of studentized residuals. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the sons of repair radiators workers living at their homes, with more severity in the cottage industry, have higher blood lead levels that the in general, overcome the standard limits recom- mended by the US, Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and the Mexican standard. 395 DEVELOPMENT OF TWO-SOURCE TWO-DETECTOR KXRF SYS? TEM TO MEASURE LEAD LEVELS IN BONE ROKHO KIM, TAK S, JUNG S, LEE J, KIM H, SHIN H. Seoul National University School of Public Health. EMail: rkim@snu.ac.kr Bone stores 90-95% of lead body burden. The K-X-ray fluorescence (KXRF) technique has been used to measure the concentration of the lead in bone. It is a safe, non-invasive, and reasonably reliable method, but still has rooms to improve. We designed and constructed a unit of two-source and two- detector KXRF system to measure both trabecular (patella) and cortical (tibia) bones simultaneously. The main advantage of this new system is the reduction of measuring time up to half. We validated the new mobile KXRF system in terms of its accuracy and precision, and developed a protocol of quality control for a standardized operation. For this goal, we compared the KXRF measurements to the chemical measurements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using cadaveric bone specimens. We will apply this pilot system to actual field study of health volunteers and patients with lead poisoning. However, this research includes some problems to be solved such as the interference between two source-detectors, the extraction and improvement of the signal peaks, and the design and con? struction of the detectors-moving piatform. The new system will make it possible to apply the KXRF technique to the clinical diagnostic applications as well as field survey in the future. 397 PLASMA LEAD PREDICTORS IN LITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING PRESS WORKERS OF MEXICO CITY CUAUHTEMOC IUAREZ, JUAREZ-PEREZ C, AGUILAR-MADRID g, LACASANA-NAVARRO M, TELLEZ-ROJO M, PIACITTELI G, SMITH D, HU H, HERNANDEZ-AVILA M. Institute Nacional de Salud Publica. EMail: cjuare@insp3.insp.mx We estudied the relation between the exogenous and endogenous lead levels in plasma and sources of the metal, in a population of workers of the litographic printing press in Mexico City. The study was made in 69 workers exposed to inorganic lead. The contribution of the diverse exogenous and endogenous sources was evaluated, in the levels of plasma lead. The plasma lead levels were measured through a ultra-clean test, with spectrometry of masses of high resolution; blood lead was quantified by atomic absorption espectrophotometer and bone lead, (tibia and patella) through fluorescent X-K rays. Additionally, a personal measurement of lead in hand before and after washing, and levels of lead in air was made. Two questionnaires, were applied. One including sociodemographic and occupational issues and en? vironmental exposures to lead, as well as hygienic habits in the work place. The second one tried to assess the food ingestion. The model for plasma lead levels including patella lead levels as predictor variable, explains 59% of the variability; the proportion of remaining lead hand after the washing was the best predictor of the exogenous sources of plasma lead (b=0,9 CI 0.105? 1.65) , adjusted for blood lead (b=0,07 CI 0.05-0.09), for lead patella (b=0,007 CI 0.0019-0.011), and for index of hygiene (b= -0,10 CI -0.23- 0.033). The model for plasma lead levels including tibia lead levels as predictor variable explains 56% of the variability; the proportion of the remaining lead in hand after the washing was the best predictor of the exogenous sources (b=0,71 CI -0.13-1.54), adjusted for blood lead (b=0,08 CI 0.055-0.10), for tibia lead (b=0,006 CI -0.0029-0.014) and for hygienic index (b= -0,14 CI -0.27- -0.0006). Our results suggest that the ingestion of the lead is predominant, and the good practices of personal hygiene in the work, may contribute to have less plasma lead. The blood lead and lead in bone may constitute an endogenous sources of this metal. The present occupational regulate must consider a substantial reduction in the level of blood lead, so that the chronic endogenous exposure to this metal and its adverse consequences decrease.</page><page sequence="119">S120 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 398 DIFFERENTIAL RESIDENTIAL MISCLASSIFICATION IN MOR? TALITY STUDIES OF POINT-SOURCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION MICHEL CAMUS, WILKINS RUSSELL, HENRI JOHN, JOSEY SHERI, SE- MENCIW ROBERT, BAND PIERRE, ZIELINSKI JAN, JIANG HUIXIA, WHITTERS JAMIE Health Canada. EMail: mcamus@videotron.ca BACKGROUND: Sydney (Nova-Scotia, Canada) has been heavily polluted by a coke oven and steel foundry complex. SMRs based on Canadian rates were computed (1951-94) for Sydney (pop.=32,000) and for surrounding Cape Breton County (CBC, pop.=96,000) to test for a gradient between these two areas. SMRs were significantly higher in Sydney than in the rest of CBC for many causes of death, including "all causes"(+9%), "circulatory system"(+4%), diabetes(+30%), "all cancers"( + 16%), cancers of the mouth(+47%), co- lon(+38%), lung( + 17%), breast(+23%), prostate( + 19%), etc. OBJECTIVE: One of us (RS) hypothesized that residential misclassification might bias the SMRs and the Sydney/CBC comparison. A check of 100 death certificates of alleged Sydney residents found 15 with postal codes from CBC areas outside Sydney. We assessed the extent of such misclassification and its impact on the mortality study. METHODS/RESULTS: One collaborator (RW) had electron- ically recoded civic addresses on death certificates for Canadian urban areas in 1991, and this work was completed manually for CBC. 7% of deaths in CBC-excluding-Sydney had been erroneously assigned to Sydney in 1991, resulting in SMRs being underestimated by 7% in CBC-excluding-Sydney and overestimated by 20% in Sydney. Misclassification resulted from Sydney out- skirts municipalities serviced by Sydney's post office, some outskirts residents using 'Sydney' rather than their actual municipality of residence in their postal address. Postal office workers used census data and history of mail delivery routes to estimate these populations over the 44-year study period. Assuming a con? stant propensity of outskirts populations to be wrongly assigned to Sydney, we extrapolated the 1991 misclassification rates to other years. Over the 1951-1994 period, SMRs would have been overestimated by 10% for Sydney and under? estimated by 3.5% for the rest of CBC. Lately, we recoded all Sydney death certificates over the 44 year period and concluded that Sydney SMRs were overestimated by 7% (rather than 12%). CONCLUSION: Postal systems may seriously affect mortality statistics in small urban areas. Of the aforementioned causes of death, only the following remained significantly increased in Sydney after correction: diabetes( + 16%), "all cancers"(+5%), colon cancer(+27%). Extrapolating misclassification rates based on one year (1991) was partly suc- cessful, resulting in overcorrection. A better sampling strategy to estimate misclassification could probably avoid an exhaustive review of death certificates. A Sydney cancer incidence study showed similar biases. Similar errors can be expected when investigating point sources of pollution in small urban areas, where post offices may be named from the central municipality. 400 THE EFFECT OF GENERAL HOUSING ENVIRONMENT ON BRONCHIAL HYPERRESPONSIVENESS KIM SANG SUP, HYUNG-JOON CHUN, DO-MYUNG PAEK. Depart? ment of Occupational and Enviromental Health,. EMail: sskiml@snu.ac.kr BACKGROUND Increasing tendency of prevalence of asthma has been reported in many country of western world since 1960s. Allowed that outdoor pollution has been improved during this time, it can be inferred that increased prevalence of asthma is mainly due to indoor environmental factors. OBJECTIVE We are to know which housing factors influence on bronchial hyperresponsiveness, known to be predisposing factor of asthma. METHODS The families of officials in a ward of Seoul city was sent questionnaire on general housing environment that include heating system type, indoor air pollution source (allergen, heating appliance, cigarette smoke). And 831 persons in all memebers of this families are conducted methacholine provocation test and skin prick test. We presenst bronchial hyperreponsiveness level as BRindex, continuous scale which Burrow('92) used. ( BRindex=loglO[{%fall of FEVl/logl0(last conc.of meth)}+3] ). In bivariate analyses, age, skin index(mean wheal size by allergens per mean wheal size by histamine), gender, heating system type, smoking status and gas applianc in all independent variables were meet the p&lt;0.2 cut off level for statistical significance. So, these variables were included into final multi? variate model. During multiple regression analysis, because we found that there are significant interaction between sex and other indpendent variabls, We conducted also analyses after stratifying by gender. RESULTS Smoking status was statistically significant both male (p=0.0174)and female(p=0.0221). As expected, brindex was significantly higher in the current smokers. Especially in female group, passive smoker's brindex was borderline(p=0.055) different with non smoker. And the pre- sensce of heating appliance(p=0.0188) was associated with high brindex in female group. 399 RESPIRATORY DISEASE AS A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE OF NON-RESPIRATORY MORTALITY ASSOCIATIONS WITH PAR? TICLE MASS IN NEW YORK CITY SAMANTHA DE LEON, THURSTON GEORGE, ITO K. NYU Medical Center. EMail: deleon@env.med.nyu.edu Most past time series studies of air pollution have analyzed broad underlying causes of death. In this analysis, we examined underlying circulatory or cancer deaths with or without respiratory contributing causes of death, in New York City (1985-1994), in order to clarify the cause-specificity of short-term effects of Particulate Matter less than lOum (PM10). We used the case-crossover study design to control for day-of-week and seasonal influence on mortality. Underlying and contributing causes of deaths for the metro? politan New York City area were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. Air pollution data were obtained from the U.S. EPA Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) database. Weather data from LaGuardia Airport were used. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the effects of PM10 on mortality. Each case was matched with the control exposure periods seven days prior to and seven days after the day of death. We also stratified the data based on the presence or absence of contributing respiratory causes of death. The model included the average of the same-day and previous day's PM10 concentrations and temperature variables for heat (same-day) and cold effects (2-day lag). Circulatory deaths with contributing respiratory causes had a higher relative risk (RR) estimate (RR=1.113, 95%CI: 1.047, 1.184) compared to circulatory deaths without contributing respiratory causes (RR= 1.035, 95%CI: 1.014, 1.056) per inter- quartile-range of PM10. Similarly, cancer deaths with contributing respira? tory causes also had higher effect estimates (RR=1.110, 95 %CI= 1.008- 1.223) than cancer deaths without contributing respiratory causes (RR=0.994, 95%CI=0.994-1.025). These results suggest that PM10 effects of broad underlying cause of death categories may be due to misclassification of respiratory effects under other categories. This is consistent with the hypothesis that air pollution is causally related to mortality. 401 LUNG FUNCTION GROWTH OF CHILDREN CHRONICALLY EXPOSED TO AIR POLLUTION IN MEXICO CITY GUSTAVO OLAIZ, PEREZ-PADILLA R, BORJA-ABURTO VICTOR, REGALADO J, ROJAS R, CHAPELA .

Schools were &lt;2 km from 10 monitoring stations distributed across Mexico City Metropolitan Area. Children had a spirometric evaluation and a questionnaire twice a year during spring and fall. Exposure was estimated according to migration history, activity patterns and assumed to be propor? tional to ambient air pollutants concentrations in the monitor closest to homes and school attended. The annual average concentration of ozone in the monitors with extreme measurements during the study period was 31 and 45 ppb whereas similar daily average peaks were 95 and 150 ppb. Lung function growth rate as evaluated during the first 7 exams was larger for girls during this period. Mean lung function growth rate was significantly slower for children living in more polluted areas. The largest effect was observed for ozone. The more severe effect was on Forced Vital Capacity, and more marked in boys than girls. These findings call for a continuous monitoring of possible retardation in pulmonary growth during long term ozone exposure in cities like Mexico.</page><page sequence="120">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S121 402 GIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AT THE BORDER PAUL ENGLISH, NEUTRA R, SCALF R, GERSTENFELD L, WOLFF C. CA Dept of Health Services. EMail: penglish@dhs.ca.gov The U.S./Mexico border region has been the site of significant demographic and environmental changes over the last two decades. The California/Baja California border in particular has grown in population rapidly, with urban centers such as Tijuana doubling in size over the time period. Increased traffic, agricultural pesticide applications, and an expanding maquiladora industry have placed a substantial burden on the area's environment. One of the border counties, Imperial County, has the highest rate of childhood asthma hospitalizations for non-Hispanic whites in California, and concerns have also been raised over health problems in the region such as adverse reproductive outcomes and childhood cancers. Computerized geographic information systems (GIS) and new sources of geocoded data now allow researchers the capability to link population, environmental, and health data. This presentation will demonstrate a GIS for environmental health for the border region which has been used to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of health events and their relationship with environmental con? taminants and socio-demographic data. Specifically, we will show applica? tions of GIS to (1) examine the distribution of agriculturally-applied pesti? cides of concern near sensitive populations in the border region; (2) examine associations between traffic flow and risk of childhood asthma; and (3) generate and analyze patterns of low birthweight births and their relation? ship with socio-demographic indices. Issues such as the generation of smoothed health outcome distributions, linkage of environmental and health data, and the strengths and limitations of GIS for epidemiologic analyses will be addressed. 404 IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION ON THE INDUCTION OF CYP1 Al AND CYP19 ACTIVITIES IN PLACENTAL TISSUES RSRAM, MACHALA M, ULRICH R, VONDRACEK J, DEJMEK J. In? stitute of Experimental Medicine AS CR. EMail: sram@biomed.cas.cz The relationship of PMIO, PM2.5 and carcinogenic PAHs in early preg? nancy with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was recently observed in the highly polluted district of Teplice (Northern Bohemia) as well as in the control district of Prachatice (Southern Bohemia). The induction of CYP1A1 in placental tissues was proposed as a biomarker of environmental exposure. This pilot study was concemed to check any correlation between CYP1A1, as well as CYP19, and air pollution and/or pregnancy outcome (IUGR). This effect was studied in placental tissues of nonsmoking women from both the districts with IUGR and normal pregnancy outcomes (nonl- UGR, total N=40). CYP1A1 activity was determined as 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) by fluorimetric method, CYP19 (aromatase) activity by HPLC Ten samples were analyzed in each group. In placental samples from Teplice district with IUGR the CYP1A1 and CYP19 activities were 3.7?4.3 and 22.5 ?8.1 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The CYP1A1 and CYP19 activities in nonlUGR samples were 2.4?3.7 and 24.1 ?10.5 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. In placental samples from Prachatice with IUGR the CYP1A1 and CYP19 activities were 1.0?1.2 and 32.5?17.5, with nonlUGR 0.6?0.4 and 42.7+62.0 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. EROD activities were the highest in placentas with IUGR as well as in the polluted district, aromatase activities were in the opposite direction, higher in placental tissues with nonlUGR as well as in the control district. Both the enzyme activities seem to be related to DNA adducts determined by 32P-postlabeling in the same placental tissues. The measure? ment of EROD and aromatase activities may be useful as an another biomarker of exposure.

Dept. of Epidemiology at the Centre for Environmental. EMail: herbarth@expo.ufz.de Introduction: Prevalences of airway diseases and allergies are increasing. This cannot be attributed to improved diagnostics only. The role of exposure to both "classical components" of air pollution and compounds as VOCs cannot be fully explained. Although, both pollutant groups are rhought to be able to initiate or promote inflammatory processes, the latter are of significance owing to their supposed immunmodulatory and allergy-promoting characteristics. Methods: Using the same design in Leipzig (L), Germany, and Mendoza (M), Argentina, a epidemiologic study involved the use of the same questionnaire and clinical parameters. Children, aged 5 to 8 years (nL=736; nM=297) were recruited as this age group is less mobile. Consequently, exposure measurements could be limited to three main localities: home, kindergarten/school, and the way to and from. Subjects in each city were divided into 'exposed' and 'not exposed', based on exposure measurements and questionnaire analyses. Results and discussion: Lifetime prevalences [%] were found to be for M/L 12.5/10.3 for asthma, 39.1/59.8 for bronchitis/infections, and 13.8/13.2 for allergic symptoms. The difference in bronchitis prevalence between M and L may be attributable to S02 (concentration ratio cM/cL = 1/25). Comparison within L revealed a higher S02-dependent illness risk for bronchitis with an ORL=1.5 (p=0.02; 0:1.1-2.0). A significant effect of typical road traffic emission components were found on airway diseases and allergies in both M (ORM=1.8 [p=0.04; CI:1.1-3.1]) and L (ORL=1.5 [p=0.02; CI:1.1-2.1]). This became even more evident when only allergic diseases were considered (ORM=1.9 [p=0.05; CM-3.7]; ORL=1.7 [p=0.007; CI:1.1-2.5]). The daily 24h mean total outdoor VOC (TVOC) loads (M: 134 jug/m3; L: 41 jmg/m3) does not explain the similar ORs. Contrary to M, indoor measurements of probands' homes in L show high VOC levels, TVOCs averaging 281 jug/m3, in part due to renovations, re-decorating as well as a lack of adequate ventilation. Considering that these children spend approx. 90% of their time indoors, this exposure would explain the similar ORs. Thus, the observed effects in M may reflect exposure to traffic-derived pollutants while in L they may reflect exposure to traffic and indoor air pollutants. Conclusion: As the mechanisms causing these effects are unknown, it may be assumed for the present that the total VOC burden is a decisive factor. The investigated health effects are of special importance when one considers the extreme traffic density in South America's metropolitan centres and the dominant impact of indoor exposure in Europe. 405 POTENTIAL HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE LANDFILL SITES: A REVIEW OF EPIDEMIOLOGIC EVI? DENCE ADETOUN MUSTAPHA. Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria. EMail: b.a.mustapha@openmail2.hsw-sysm.spdcwri.simis.c Municipal solid waste (MSW) is generated in all countries of the world at increasing quantity as a result of domestic and social activities in human settlement. Its heterogeneous nature makes it liable to cause health hazards if not properly managed. Majority of it is disposed in regulated sanitary landfills in developed countries and in open dumps in many developing countries. The latter is creating enormous problems and governments in developing countries are moving towards construction of sanitary landfills to address this. However, sanitary landfill may become subject of poor engineering or operation. Its efficiency to reduce occupational and environmental impacts are now being questioned due to complaints of various health effects by workers and residents living near such sites. This study examines published epidemiological literature to determine the strength of evidence documenting human health effects of MSW landfill sites and whether developing countries should explore other healthy and cost-effective ways of managing their MSW. Published literatures were obtained between 3rd March 1999 and 31st July 1999 through the electronic bibliographic databases and previous reviews. Lack of direct method for exposure assessment, unavailability of relevant environmental data on landfill emissions and the fact that there are many confounding factors that are not effectively adjusted undermines the integ- rity of any observed positive association between living close to landfill sites and health effects. Moreover, the health outcomes observed are not specific for emissions from MSW landfill sites and the relative risks and odd ratios for most of the elevated cases were low (&lt; 2.0). This study therefore opens up areas of scientific uncertainties that still exists and worth looking at by future research so as to develop rational regulatory actions and improve operations of the landfills. It also proposes possible MSW management options for developing countries and suggests selection of best option based on protection of public health, cultural issues, available resources and locally sustainable technology.</page><page sequence="121">S122 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 409 BIRTH RATE INDEX, CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS ANE INFANTILE MORTALITY IN A NEIGHBOURING AREA OF A URANIUM MINE STELA RAMBOIU, MELANIA POSTESCU, STEFANIA SALAGEAN LIANA GORCEA. Environmental Health Center, Cluj, Romania. EMail stela.ramboiu@usa.net Recent investigations demonstrated the lowering of fertility rate as result ol the exposure of rats to high Radon-222 and Radon-222 progeny levels in the air, six months after the end of exposure. The effect of high Radon-222 anc Radon-222 progeny concentrations in the air on fertility rate, congenital malformations and infantile mortality for population living in the neigh- bouring area of "Avram Iancu" uranium mine were investigated. Method. "Avram Iancu" mine was one of the most reache in uranium ore ir Europe. Population living in the vicinity of this mine (Nucet) and a contro group from the same geographic area (Baia de Aries) in the neighbouring ares of non-uranium mine, with a similar age group distribution were investigated Birth rate, congenital malformations and infantile mortality index during 1960- 1995 were analysed. Indoor and outdoor Radon-222 and Radon-222 progeny were measured using Lucas cells and Nazaroffs method, respectively. Results Outdoor and indoor Radon-222 and Radon-222 progeny are signifi? cantly higher for Nucet area as compared with Baia de Aries. The main sources of Radon in the air are Radium-226 from soil, uranium ore deposits anc transport as well as building materials. For about 10% of exposed area indooi Radon-222 and Radon-progeny concentrations had the same order of magni tude as the occupational maximum permitted limits (1,110 Bq. m-3 and 0.3 WL respectively), as a result of use of sterile uranium ore as building material. The highest values for birth rate index for exposed group were observed during 1961 and 1962 (102.9 %o and 163.2 %o, respectively). Beginning with 1963 the birth rate index decreased rapidly, ranging between 45.5%o in 1963 and 9.1 %c in 1979. The total number of children increased from 246 to 346 during 1961-62, but after 1962 it decreased significantly up to 49 in 1973; the infantile mortality index was maximum in 1963 (98.03 %o), decreasing to 20.83 %o ir 1966. Between 1966 till 1995, the infantile mortality did not change, ranging between 37.03 %o and 19.23 %o. The fertility index, congenital malformation; and infantile mortality for control group did not changed in time, being significantly lower than for exposed group. Conclusions. The long-term exposure to Radon-222 and Radon-222 progeny lead to a significant decreasing of birth rate, for population living in the vicinity of a uranium mine as compared with a control group from the same geographic area. The effect was observed 15 years after the beginning o uranium mining. It is possible that the inhalation of Radon-222 and iti progeny is not related only to a high incidence of lung cancer but also 411 COMPARATIVE STUDY OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ASTH MATIC ATTACKS AND ENVIRONMENT AMONG ASTHMATIC CHILDREN IN MALAYSIA.. ZAILINA HASHIM, JALALUDIN JULIANA, HASHIM JAMAL. Uni versiti Putra Malaysia. EMail: zailinahas@hotmail.com A comparative study was conducted on 163 asthmatic children from Kuak Lumpur (polluted area) and 38 asthmatic children from Terengganu (les: polluted area). The objective of this study was to compare the lung function of the asthmatic children between the 2 sexes and study areas: to determine the relationship between percent asthmatic attack with the air pollutam concentrations. Questionnaires and diary cards were used to obtain back ground information and frequency of asthmatic attacks. A spirometer wa used to measure lung functions of the asthmatic children. Findings showec that there was a significant difference in the FEV1% predicted (p=0.002) FEV1/FVC % predicted (p =0.001) and the %FEV1/FVC (p=0.002) be tween male children in the two areas. However, only the FEV1% predictec (p=0.011) was significantly different between the female children in the twc areas. Significant correlation was also found between the frequency o asthma attacks with FEV1% predicted (p=0.008), FEV1/FVC % predictec (p=0.001) and % FEV1/FVC (p=0.001) among the Kuala Lumpur childrer but no significant correlation was found among the Terengganu children Significant correlations were found between the percent asthmatic attacl and respirable particles or PM10, ( p=0.001), nitrogen dioxide (r = 0.824 p = 0.001), sulfur dioxide (p= 0.035) and ozone (r=0.623, p= 0.001) Results also showed that the PM10 and N02 were significantly related to the percent asthmatic attacks. These pollutants contributed to 71% of the variations in the asthmatic attacks while the rest were due to other factor: such as food, pollen, animals hair, carpet and other genetic factors. 410 THE INFLUENCE OF BLOOD LEAD AND NEUROBEHAVIORAL STATUS ON THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF MALAYSIAN SCHOOL CHILDREN. IAMAL HASHIM, ARIFFIN O, ZAILINA H, BAHARI S, IDZUAN A. Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. EMail: jamalhas@medic.ukm.my A cross-sectional study was conducted on 184 elementary school children from 3 study areas, chosen based on their levels of atmospheric particulate and lead pollution. Kuala Lumpur represents the high pollution area, while Kemaman and Setiu represent the moderate and low pollution areas, respec? tively. The objective of this study was to study the influence of environ? mental variables represented by blood lead and neurobehavioral status, as well as selected social variables, on the children's academic achievement. Atmospheric respirable particulate and lead pollution were highest for Kuala Lumpur, followed by Kemaman and Setiu. Blood lead levels of the children were highest for Kuala Lumpur (5.00 &amp;#61549;g/m3), followed by Kemaman (2.51 &amp;#61549;g/m3) and Setiu (2.06 &amp;#61549;g/m3). The mean neurobe? havioral scores of Kuala Lumpur, Kemaman and Setiu children were 48.74, 50.65 and 52.82, respectively. Blood lead was only found to be inversely correlated with the neurobehavioral scores of Kuala Lumpur children. When blood lead, neurobehavioral score and selected social variables were consid? ered as predictors for academic achievement in a multiple regression model, only neurobehavioral score was found to be predictive. This may mean that children's exposures to other environmental pollutants besides lead may also influence their academic achievement. 413 TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH COLIN SOSKOLNE. University of Alberta. EMail: colin.soskolne@ualberta.ca Reductionist approaches in science preclude the examination of societal problems in a systemic or holistic way. While they have their valued place in science, they are self-serving and relatively narrow in their contribution to knowledge that extends beyond the confines of any single discipline. Consequences for anything that falls outside of the narrow confines of the reductionist paradigm are rarely, if ever, entertained. Multi-disciplinary approaches were deemed a step forward - a strength of epidemiology - and regarded as the hallmark of new paradigms for solving complex problems. However, this paper argues that further paradigm shifts are needed in the approach to addressing the impacts of ecological declines on human and, consequently, on public health. Indeed, transdisciplinary approaches are needed if concerns about the impact on public health of ecological declines are to be addressed. The notion of the "transdisciplinary approach" gains meaning, however, only when it can be defined. No definition exists in either the Mirriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary, or in A Dictionary of Epidemiology. A definition is proposed which was adapted from that developed by Dr. David Rapport, in 1998, in the context of transdisciplinary approaches to ecosystem health. It is pro? posed that the following definition will help advance the science that would examine upstream determinants of public health, namely global ecological integrity and global change, of which climate change is but a part, and for which environmental epidemiology holds the greatest promise. Thus, "trans? disciplinary approaches to human health are defined as approaches that integrate the natural, social and health sciences in a humanities context, and in so doing transcend each of their traditional boundaries. Emergent con? cepts and methods are the hallmark of the transdisciplinary effort". Adop- tion of this definition would enable epidemiologists to transcend traditional boundaries defined through proximate approaches from reductionist study designs. These approaches are needed if science is to contribute to informing policy about the impacts on human health from declining ecological integ? rity on the global scale. The implications of this in opening new frontiers for environmental epidemiology are many.</page><page sequence="122">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S123 414 COMMUNITY INTERVENTION STUDY FOR ESTIMATION OF ENDEMIC WATERBORNE DISEASE REBECCA CALDERON, CRAUN G. USEPA. EMail: calderon.rebecca@epa.gov The nature and magnitude of endemic waterborne disease is not well charac- terized in the United States. Recent Canadian studies suggest that in some communities, drinking water could be a significant source of pathogens that cause gastrointestinal disease. Because these illnesses are rarely seen by the medical community, they are difficult to study by traditional observational epidemiologic designs. EPA's Surface Water Treatment Rule of 1989 requires all communities that use surface water as a source of their drinking water to filter their water unless special criteria are met. The promulgation of this rule provided an opportunity to use a natural experiment and a quasi-experimental design to evaluate endemic waterborne illness. A survey of water utilities affected by the Surface Water Treatment Rule revealed 21 utilities that would be good candi- dates for an epidemiologic study of waterborne disease. Additional information was collected on those utilities, and a community was selected for a pilot epidemiologic study to evaluate the endemic gastrointestinal illnesses associated with microbes in drinking water and to provide information for use in designing additional studies. A community intervention study was designed, and informa? tion on daily gastrointestinal symptoms was collected from families before and after the addition of filtration to the drinking water treatment process Informa? tion was obtained during July through December in 1996 and 1997. As a requirement for participation, families had to include one or more children in the study. Of the families that finished participation in the study before water filtration, 56% continued to participate after the water was filtered. The rela? tively poor retention resulted in additional families having to be recruited for study in the after filtration months. Results indicate that there was a significant reduction in the rate of credible- gastrointestinal (CGI) illness after filtration of drinking water. The relative risk of CGI before versus after filtration was 1.8 (95% CI=1.5-2.1). The attributable risk of CGI associated with unfiltered drinking water is 34%. These results are preliminary and additional analyses are in progress to further evaluate the changes in health as the result of filtration, the potential for bias and the potential for confounding, however, there is no evidence at this time to suggest that the results are affected by significant bias. This study is the first of three planned community intervention studies. Future studies will include an assess? ment of CGI in families in a control community to help interpret observed waterborne risks. 420 COMPARISON BETWEEN ARIMA AND GAM APPLICATIONS IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DATA ANALYSIS LEI CHEN, YANG WEI, JENNISON BRIAN L., OMAYE STANLEY T.. University of Nevada, Reno. EMail: leic@scs.unr.edu Two statistical regression models, the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), were compared in this study for their ability to assess the association between ambient particulate air pollution concentrations and daily hospital admis? sions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Reno/Sparks, Nevada during the period 1990-1994. The study involved 3115 admissions for COPD. The daily average concentration of ambient PMIO was 36.55 micrograms per cumic meter. After adjusting for the effects of weather variables, day-of-the-week, seasons, and time trend, both the ARIMA and GAM methods consistently suggested that PMIO is a statistically significant predictor of daily hospital admissions for COPD. The percentage increase of hospital admissions for COPD for an interquartile increase (26.6 micrograms per cubic meter ) of the 24-h average of PMIO on the 14 prior days is 4.29% (95% CI 1.22-7.36%) with ARIMA analysis and 5.62% (95% CI 2.16?9.08%) with GAM analysis. The percentage increase of hospital admissions for COPD for an increase of 26.6 micrograms per cubic meter of the 24-h average of PMIO on the concurrent day was 4.73% (95% CI 0.88?8.58%) with the GAM analysis. Comparisons of both methods showed that the GAM was more sensitive than the ARIMA analysis in predicting correlations between PMIO levels and hospital admissions for COPD. However, the ARIMA method is a more powerful technique in dealing with the problems of high order autocorrelation errors. 417 SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF CLASSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL AIR POLLUTANTS - SYNOPTIC WEATHER CONDITIONS ON DAILY MORTALITY IN BUDAPEST: APHEA2 PROJECT A PALDY, BOBVOS J, ERDEI ESTHER, FARKAS I, VAMOS A, KAROSSYCS. Nat.l Public Health Centre, Nat.l Inst. for Environmental. EMail: paldy@mail.joboki.hu Short-term effects of ambient air pollutants on the daily total, respiratory and cardiac mortality have been investigated in Budapest, a city with 1,9 million inhabitants within the context of the multi-center collaborative APHEA2 project. Total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality and air pollution data were collected for 1992-1995. Data on pollen counts and synoptic weather conditions were also available for the same period. The data were first analyzed using generalized additive models for the whole period. As for mortality depended on the differences of temperature to a great extent, slightly different models were constructed for the summer and winter periods. The effect of S02, N02, CO, 03 and TSP, as well as total pollen count, pollen of trees, grasses and weeds, and 13 synoptic weather conditions were studied separately. In a second phase the impact of synoptic conditions and that of pollens on the effect of air pollutants on mortality was investigated. The effect of single classical air pollutants on mortality in the summer and winter models were in concordance with the results found in the model for the whole period, but some pollutants had stronger effect in summer, others in winter. The strongest associations for an interquartile increase in concentration were: for TSP on respiratory mortality of 15-64 years old population in winter: RR 1,17 95 % CI: 1.07-1.27; for 03 on respiratory mortality of the total population: RR 1,14 95 % CI: 1,01-1,26. The association of total pollen count was significantly positive with cardio? vascular mortality of day lag3 on 15-64 y age group (RR 1.0024 95% CI: 1.00038-1.0043). Pollen count did not modify the effect of air pollutants on mortality. Synoptic weather conditions in themselves did not cause a sig? nificant increase in mortality, neither modified the effect of air pollutants. Further modeling is necessary to clarify the modifying effect of weather conditions on air pollutants affecting mortality. 421 EFFECTS OF EL NINO AND AMBIENT TEMPERATURE ON PE- DIATRIC DIARRHEA IN LIMA, PERU WILLIAM CHECKLEY, EPSTEIN L, GILMAN R, FIGUEROA D, CAMA R, PATZ J, BLACK R. Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. EMail: wcheckley003@md.nwu.edu There is growing concern that the effects of El Nino, and more generally global warming, may harm the health of human populations. To investigate whether ambient temperature and the El Nifio phenomenon had an effect on childhood diarrhea, we analyzed daily admissions to the Oral Rehydration Unit of the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Nino in Lima, Peru, between January 1993 and November 1998. Our analytical method combined har- monic regression, semi-parametric curve fitting, and autoregressive-moving average models to assess the effect of El Nino on diarrheal admissions. During the 1997-98 El Nino event, ambient temperature in Lima increased more than 5?C higher than normal, and the number of daily admissions for diarrhea increased by more than 200 percent. For each degree centigrade of increase in mean ambient temperature, the number of admissions increased by 8 percent. The effects of ambient temperature and El Nino on the number of diarrheal admissions were greatest during the winter. El Nino also had an influence on admissions greater than that attributable to an increase in ambient temperature alone. Our results indicate that extreme climate variability driven by El Nino episodes, or potentially long-term global warming are likely to have strong effects on the epidemiology of diarrheal diseases. If our findings for Lima are reproducible globally, then cases of diarrhea may increase in other regions of the world with each degree of increase in ambient temperature.</page><page sequence="123">S124 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 422 PARTICULATE AIR POLLUTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ACUTE PHASE RESPONSE IN MEN. RESULTS FROM THE MONICA^AUGSBURG STUDY ANNETTE PETERS, FROHLICH M, DORING A, IMMERVOLL T, WICHMANN H, HUTCHINSON W, PEPYS M, KOENIG W. GSF- National Center for Environment and Health,. EMail: peters@gsf.de Background: Episodes of increased air pollution are associated with increases in hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease. Even modest acute phase responses are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. The study investigates whether induction of an acute phase response by exposure to air pollution may contribute to cardiovascular pathology. Methods: A prospective cohort study based on a survey in 1984/85 with a three year follow-up was conducted in 631 randomly selected men aged 45 to 64 years free of cardiovascular disease at entry. Serum C-reactive protein concentrations were determined by a high sensitivity immunoradiometric assay. Findings: C-reactive protein concentration was increased in association with the 1985 air pollution episode. In multivariate analyses, elevated concen? trations were independently associated with concentrations of total sus? pended particles and sulphur dioxide. During the air pollution episode, the odds of observing C-reactive protein concentrations above 5.7 mg/1 (&gt; 90th percentile) tripled. Outside the episode, increases of 26 /u,g/m3 total sus? pended particles (mean of 5 days) increased the odds of C-reactive protein levels above the 90th percentile by 50%. Interpretation: Exposure to current levels of particulate matter in the atmo? sphere elicits an acute phase response in randomly selected men healthy middle-aged, which may explain in part the increased cardiovascular risk caused by air pollution. 424 WHAT FACTORS AFFECT PRIORITY SETTING OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN FORMER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES IN EUROPE?

EMail: hana.slachtova@khsova.cz There is little published information available on the perception of health and/or environmental risks in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), especially since their rapid transformation Objectives: In 1996 a 6 country risk perception (RP) survey was carried out within the CESAR study (Central European Study on Air pollution and Respiratory Health). The RP study aimed to assess attitudes to environmen? tal health risks (relative to other concerns) to assist the development of a risk communication strategy for the CESAR health study results. This paper focuses on patterns and demographic correlates of levels of priority accorded to different perceived risks and problems. Methods: A RP questionnaire was developed and circulated to samples of the adult population in the CESAR study areas in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Slovak Republic. Completed question? naires ranged from 161 to 396 per area in 24 communities. Respondents were asked to indicate their level of concern about 20 specific problems including environmental (e.g. state ofthe local environment), health (e.g. AIDS) and social problems (e.g. crime). Answers were given in a 5-point scale of concern for each item. Variables included in the analysis were country, sex, age group and socio-economic indicators such as education, occupation and economic well-being. Analyses include comparison of the ranking of these issues between subgroups of the study population and multivariate analysis of predictors of the level of concern, using ordinal logistic regression. Results: Initial analyses indicate that the most significant contrasts in the ranking of different issues were between countries. For example, in the Czech Republic and Poland the environmental problems were ranked higher than in other countries, where health, social and economic problems predomi- nated. The health of children ranked highly across nearly all sub-groups. Analysis of predictors of concern about personal health suggest that concern was greater for those who had less education or were in manual jobs. Concern about environmental problems appeared higher in non-manually working and the relatively rich, though in multivariate analyses, country, age and sex were more important predictors than SES. Detailed analyses cur? rently underway will be presented. Conclusion: While Environment/Health were ranked relatively highly across most groups, interesting differences emerge relative to country, age and SES in the levels of concern for these and other issues during this period of transition in Central Europe. 423 MODELING AN AREA EFFECT ON HAVING RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS IN REPEATED MEASUREMENTS DESIGNS CHAVA PERETZ, GOREN A, HELLMANN SARAH. inst. for environ? mental research, tel-aviv university. EMail: cperetz@post.tau.ac.il Background: Repeated measurements data sets are characterized by relatively large number of short time-series. In addition the times of measurement maybe unequally spaced and different among subjects. The series may include missing values (an unbalanced design) and measurements done on the same subject are correlated. Modeling a repeated discrete health-out- come adjusted for covariates is rarely done in an exhaustive way which includes all available subject's information rather than a summary measure. Objective: To evaluate an area effect on the probability of having respiratory symptoms, in asthmatic and non-asthmatic schoolchildren based on an unbalanced repeated measures data-set. Methods: A panel of 158 children, half asthmatics and half matched non- asthmatics living in 3 areas near a power-plant (similar in socio - economic status) were followed for having respiratory symptoms between 5/97-4/98. Each child was questioned 10 times per season using a short structured questionnaire, for his recent health-status. Due to absenteeism, repeated measures per child were 9-29. Statistical GEE modeling was applied to model the area effect on having respiratory symptoms. Results: Apart of sputum, OR for asthmatic children in comparison to none were significant, for cough, cold, wheezing and wheezing with shortness of breath (1.50, 1.90, 6.25,13.09 accordingly). Symptoms' rates, adjusted for area, were: 36%, 48%, 9%, 4%. In both asthmatics and non-asthmatics, significant OR in winter in comparison to fall, were found for cough, sputum and cold (1.64,1.92, 2.07 respectively). The concentrations of S02, NO, N02, NOX in the study period were low (4.9?3.5, 4.7?4.1, 15.6?6.2, 20.3?9.6 jt?g/m3 accordingly). Even though significant differences in the concentrations among the areas were observed, area was found to have a non-significant effect on the probability of having respiratory symptoms accounting for season and having asthma. GEE models that included also residential daily pollution concentrations did not depict significant effects of pollutants on the probability of having symptoms. Conclusion: The results suggest that an area effect was undetectable on the probability of having respiratory symptoms due to the very low-level expo? sure observed in this period. 426 A CASE CONTROL STUDY ON LUNG CANCER AND AIR POL? LUTION FROM INDUSTRIAL SURCES IN CIVITAVECCHIA, IT? ALY. PAOLAM1CHELOZZI, FANO V, ANOONA Q CAPON A, FORASTIERE F, PERUCO C. regional epidemiology unit EMail: epiainb@sMo.regione.lazio.it Background. Civitavecchia is an industrial town located north of Rome; the main sources of air pollution are three oil-fired thermoelectric power plants, an industrial harbour, and a large cement plant. Over several years, concern has been expressed that the incidence of cancer in the area was higher than normal. Since the early '80s lung cancer mortality rate among residents was a 20-30% higher than in the regional general population. A case-control design was used to evaluate the association between air pollution exposure in the area and lung cancer. Methods. 263 cases of lung cancer (died between 1987 and 1995) and 789 controls matched by gender, date of birth, and date of death were enrolled into the study. Environmental exposure was evaluated using historical residence data in the area. A geographical information system was used to compute distances from residence and each source of pollution; a weighted average distance, with length of residence used as weights, was computed for each subject. A questionnaire to close relatives was used to collect information on smoking and a wide range of occupations linked with lung cancer. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%C.I.) were computed with a logistic regression to estimate the relative risk of lung cancer associated with the risk factors collected through the questionnaire; ORs for weighted distances from the four sources were computed, by adjusting for smoking habits, education and occupation. Results. Smoking habit (&gt;20 cigarettes, OR=6.78), occupational exposure to asbestos (OR=3.53), and work as seamen (maritime) (OR=1.56) were significantly associated with lung cancer risk in the area. Residence distance from harbour was not associated with an increased risk. For both the cement plant and the power plant located in the central area, the odds ratios increased with increasing distance although not significantly; for the power plant the estimated risks (reference =&lt; 1 Km) were OR=l.l between 1-2 Km, OR=1.48 between 2.0-2.5 and OR=1.52 for a distance &gt; 2.5 Km. Perceived traffic level of area of residence (low, medium, high) was not associated with cancer risk. Conclusions. Smoking habit and occupational exposure to carcinogens (as? bestos) were significantly associated with lung cancer in the area. Lung cancer risk increased with distance from the thermoelectric power plant located in the central area although not significantly. Since air emission dispersion models indicate lower decay of pollutants in the closest area to power plant, the association that we see might be interpreted as a result of exposure to air contaminants.</page><page sequence="124">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S125 427 DECREASED OXYGEN SATURATION AND INCREASED HEART RATE ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICULATE AIR POLLUTION (PM2.5 ) AMONG COPD PATIENTS.

EMail: epiamb@sirio.regione.lazio.it Background Premature mortality from cardiopulmonary diseases has been consistently linked with particulate air pollution. The underlying mechanisms, however, are still unclear. A panel study was carried out in Rome (Italy), aimed at evaluating the possible association between exposure to particulate air pol? lution and cardiac or respiratory impairments in subjects with pre-existing chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). Methods Repeated 12-hour pulse oximetry at night and spirometry examinations were conducted on 11 non-smokers COPD cases (7 men and 4 women) during the 1999 summer (May 27 - June 24) and winter (November 21 - December 22). A total of 176 person-days were accrued (16 repeats per subject on average; range: 2 - 33). Daily outdoor concentrations of PMIO and PM2.5 were measured (dichotomous samplers Andersen / GMW's PM10/2.5 located at two different urban monitoring sites). PM2.5 concentrations averaged 27.6 mg/m3 over the study period (SD = 20.3 mg/m3; interquartile range = 23.7mg/m3). Indoor PM2.5 levels, measured in a side reliability study, were highly correlated with outdoor concentrations (r = 0.79). A multiple linear regression model for repeated individual measures (fixed-effect) was used, controlling for meteorological conditions (barometric pressure and temper? ature) and time (survey and week-ends). Results A decrease of maximal hemoglobin oxygen saturation was associated with a unit (10 mg/m3) increase in PM2.5 levels on the same day (-0.3%; 95% CI = -0.1.% - -0.5%). A unit increase in PM2.5 at lag 0 was related to a linear increase in the average heart rate (3.50 beats / minute; 95% CI = 1.6 - 5.4). An increase in heart rate variability (standard deviation of the average heart rate) was also evident (1.10; 95% CI = 0.04 - 2.17). Pulmo? nary function parameters (FVC, FEVl and FEF25-75) showed an association with PM2.5 levels recorded during the previous two days: for FEVl (% of predicted; mean = 70%; SD = 17.7%; 158 person-days), the estimated b coefficient at lag 1 was -0.68 (SE = 0.30). When the outcome variables were regressed against PMIO daily levels, similar but lower effects were observed. Conclusions A decrease in oxygen saturation and increases in pulse rate and heart rate variability were found to be associated with ambient concentration of fine particles. A heart rate acceleration may well result either from impairment of autonomic nervous cardiac control or in response to hypoxia. 429 THE CONTEXTUAL EFFECT OF MATERIAL DEPRIVATION MARCO MARTUZZI, BIGGERI ANNIBALE, DREASSI EMANUELA, MARCHI MARCO, BERTOLLINI ROBERTO. WHO Rome Italy. EMail: mam@who.it The relationship between socio-economic factors and health has been stud? ied in many circumstances. It is unclear whether the association takes place at the individual or population level (contextual effect), or both. Some studies suggest that knowledge of the socio-economic characteristics of the (small) community to which a given subject belong is more informative, in term of control of potential confounding, than the individual's status. We used data on the general population of Florence to investigate the join contribution to mortality of individual and population based socio-economic factors. We will reframe the analysis of potentially contextual variables like the material deprivation indicators using individual data and hierarchical bayesian modeling. Our objectives are to show that different ways of mod? elling contextual variables assume prior believes on the nature of the effects and to show that a simple individual-level analysis could produce more biased results than a simple aggregate-level analysis. We will do this using a material deprivation index and data from the Tuscany Longitudinal Cohort Study. 428 INDICATORS OF HEALTH AND DRINKING WATER AS TOOLS FOR PRIORITIES SETTING Dr. Ioana Iacob*, Dr. Mihaela Vasilescu. Institute of Public Health Bucha- rest - Romania Health and environmental indicators are considered to be efficient tools of health policy, if they are representative and can quantify with accuracy different situations and phenomena. Indicators might improve the commu? nication to decision makers and public, provide information in a more significant form, and can measure policy performance. The objective of the study was to set up a model for the aggregation of data regarding drinking water quality and quantity and health status, as a tool for reporting the information to decision makers and public. As a methodology approach, the data were collected from 1997 annually report on drinking water quality. The study included 41 cities representing the capital of each district and the city of Bucharest. Drinking water indicators referred were: number of pop? ulation with access to the drinking water system, number of population supplied with intermittence in water distribution, percentages of samples and analyses not in compliance with standard and the size of population popu? lation exposed to substandard drinking water. Health indicators were: inci? dence of dysentery, incidence of viral hepatitis A, acute diarrhea disease and standardized mortality rates for tumors. The indicators were organized into a matrix. According to this empirical model, it was established a score for the actual situation of localities supplied and the goals to be achieved. The results were validated for 37 cities (90.24%), with 7.885.749 inhabitants. The representative aggregated indicator for health in relation with drinking water is the coverage of population with safe water resulted from: size of population supplied with drinking water, size of population supplied with water in compliance with standards and size of population continuously supplied. 431 ETS EXPOSURE AND IMMUNE BIOMARKER EXAMINATIONS AMONG HUNGARIAN ASTHMATIC SCHOOL CHILDREN - IN?

EMail: eerdei@mail.joboki.hu Objective. Within the framework of the CESAR (Central European Study of Air pollution and Respiratory health in children) study, a survey was conducted to measure a panel of immune biomarkers in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. Methods. Blood was collected from 460 school children aged 9to 11 (10to61 children in each of 19 communities) between 11 April and 10 May 1996. Parents completed questionnaires including information on respiratory health, smoking in the home, use of gas appliances to cook and also heat the house in winter, type of heating system, use of unvented gas heater, use of open fireplace, presence of dampness and pets in the house. Percentages of B, CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry (Bec- ton Dickinson). Total immunoglobulins G, M, A and E were measured by nephelometry. Associations between indoor factors and each log transformed biomarker concentration were studied by linear regression, with adjustment for age, sex, country and socioeconomic status. The effect of indoor factors on biomarker concentration was expressed as relative difference (in percentage) between exposed and unexposed children. When ordinal categorical variables were considered, significance level of a linear test for trend was computed. Results. The associations with environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) are reported here. In these children, an increasing number of lymphocytes was found with increasing number of smokers in the house. The trend was significant for number of B lymphocytes (p value for trend=0.01), with a 12.3% increase from children living in a house with no smokers to children living in a house with 3 or more smokers. Similar trends were found for CD4+ (19.3% increase) and CD8+ (14.5% increase), though these did not reach statistical significance. No such trends were detected for associations between ETS and concentration of total immunoglobulin G, M, A or E; only a non-significant trend in the opposite direction for total IgE. Conclusions. A possible interpretation of our findings is that long-term exposure to ETS may lead to chronic irritation of the airways and activation of the cellular immune system. Acknowledgements.

CLAUDIA GALASSI, OSTRO BART, FORASTIERE F, CATTANI STE- FANO, MARTUZZI MARCO, BERTOLLINI ROBERTO. Regional Health Documentation Center (CDS),. EMail: claudia.galassi@ausl.bologna.it Several epidemiological studies have indicated an association between urban air pollutants and a wide range of adverse health effects. The scientific evidence is strongest for particulate matter up to 10/xm (PMIO). The objective of the study is to assess PMIO exposure in the Italian cities with more than 400 000 inhabitants (Turin, Genoa, Milan, Bologna, Flo- rence, Rome, Naples and Palermo) and to estimate the number of selected health outcomes that can be attributed to PMIO exposure above some reference values, including international air quality standards. The collec? tion of air quality data has been performed through the ITARIA Collabo? rative Group that include the air quality-network managers of the eight cities. To estimate mean annual exposure from the existing monitoring data we selected relevant monitoring stations for each city and considered the arithmetic mean of the ambient concentrations. The annual average value was then used as indicator of the current population exposure. Baseline rates of the health outcomes in study were derived from city-specific data (overall mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions), and from national or European data (bronchitis in children, asthma attacks, restricted- activity days, respiratory symptoms). The dose-response functions for each health outcome were derived from a meta-analysis of the existing epidemi? ological literature. The observed annual mean PMIO levels in 1998 was above the current Italian standard (40 /xg/m3) in all the cities, ranging from 43 to 72. Preliminary estimates indicate that there are likely to be significant impacts on both mortality and morbidity from exposure to PMIO in Italy. The results of this study will aid the policy makers in choosing among altemative pollution control levels and strategies. 434 CHANGES WITH TIME IN AIR POLLUTION LEVELS IN TEL- AVIV AND THEIR EFFECTS ON MORTALITY. RONY BRAUNSTEIN, GOREN A. Dep. of Epidemiology, Sackler School of Medicine,. EMail: ronyb@post.taii.ac.il Background: The current study examines changes with time in air pollution levels in Tel-Aviv. The changes were examined for their trend and nature. Possible effects on mortality were examined as well. This study was done as a part of the APHEA II project. Objectives: (i) to evaluate the pattern (increase/decrease) of daily air pol? lution concentrations with time (ii) to evaluate and to interpret changes in air pollution dispersion with time and (iii) to estimate the effect of changes in daily air pollution levels on mortality from the attributable diseases (Respiratory and CVD). Methods: the data were collected for two consecutive periods: (i) 1/1/80? 31/12/83 (1461 days) and (ii) 1/1/91-31/12/96 (2192 days). For the first period the daily averages of S02,NOX and 03 were collected. For the second period the data consist of: (i) daily averages of S02,NOX,03 and PMIO (ii) daily number of deaths from respiratory and from cardio vascular diseases and (iii) daily environmental and meteorological data. Descriptive as well as numerical methods were used in order to evaluate the changes in air pollution levels with time. Statistical Process Control (SPC) approaches were used for the evaluation and interpretation of the air pollution disper? sion. The effect of air pollution on mortality was obtained by using a General Additive Model with smoothed functions. Results: (i) significant differences in the daily mean concentrations between the 1980's period and the 1990's period were found (ii) significant decrease with time was found for S02,NOX,03 concentrations during the 1991? 1996 period, while no time trend could be shown for PMIO (iii) a decrease in S02 dispersion with time could be shown while other pollutants showed an increase in their dispersion (iv) The daily number of deaths from Respiratory+CVD decreased with time while daily mortality from other diseases increased (v) PMIO was found to be the only pollutant with a significant effect on CVD mortality with RR= 1.046 for a change of 50 mg/m3 (Pv=0.0071) (vi) the PAR for PMIO was found to be 1.9% for a change of 50 mg/m3. PMIO is responsible for 70 out of 3,697 deaths per year from CVD in Tel Aviv. Conclusions: The results show that changes in air pollution levels occurred in Tel Aviv. S02,03 and NOX concentrations constantly decreased during the period 1991-1996 while PMIO levels remained almost constant. The fact that S02 concentration dispersion decreased with time implies that the main source for S02, the power station, is well controlled. The huge number of uncontrolled NOX sources, cars, explain the increase in NOX concen? tration dispersion. The effect of air pollution on mortality was found to be very small. For S02.NOX and 03 no significant effect on mortality could be shown. Although a significant effect was found for PMIO, in practice the effect is relatively small. 433 IMMUNE BIOMARKERS AND EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMEN?

EMail: emniciu@com.pcnet.ro Objective: To investigate possible risk factors for inhalant allergy in children of six Central and Eastern European countries. Methods: Within the framework of a multi-centre study addressing the relationship between air pollution and childhood respiratory health, which took place in 25 areas in six Central and Eastern European countries, information was collected on doctor diagnosed allergy for inhalant allergens, respiratory symptoms and disorders and potential risk factors in a cross- sectional design for 13,074 children aged 9 to 11. Possible risk factors for sensitisation in early life and allergy to inhalant allergens were assessed by means of a self administered health questionnaire distributed among the children's parents. Information was collected on different risk factors known from the literature, including: day care in the first two years of life, severe breathing trouble in early life, number of children in the family, home dampness, pet ownership, smoking habits of the parents and especially mother's smoking during pregnancy, as well as possible confounders. A screening test for multiple and specific IgE (Pharmacia Phadiatop CAP system) was performed in 400 children. The health questionnaire was validated using the IgE mixture as "gold standard". Results: Prevalences of allergy to inhalants ranged from 3.3% - 12.5% in different countries. The risk factor analysis (logistic regression modelling) showed strong associations for: serious breathing troubles in early life (p&lt;0.001) , presence of pets (p=0.036), parents allergy (p&lt;0.001), dampness of the home (p&lt;0.001), number of children in the family (p=0.010). These associations remained significant after controlling for age, sex area, and education of the mother. Reported allergy to inhalants collected by the questionnaire, has a low sensitivity (9-25%) but a high specificity (95-98%) when compared to Phadi? atop IgE screening. This pattern is consistent across countries. Conclusion: Our findings support a role played by several early childhood factors in affecting risk of allergy in children in Central Europe.

DANTECACERES, QUIfiONES S. LUIS, GARUTI A. CLAUDIO. Uni? versidad de Chile. EMail: dcaceres@machi.med.uchile.cl Nowadays it is known that the indoor pollution due to toxic emissions from inappropriate or bad kept heating systems could be very important for the population health. This is even more important in cities with cold and rainy weather, where the people spend more time inside homes. Therefore, it is of crucial importance that people have enough judgement parameters to select the most convenient energy altemative for heating system, considering variables like: the given benefit, the cost and the potential risks in health and environment. For this purpose it was applied to 10 users (included the authors) the AHP method (Analytic Hierarchy Process). This is a powerful and flexible decision making tool for complex multicriteria problems where both qualitative and quantitative aspect need to be incorporated. The analysed alternatives were, gas, kerosene, wood S. (slow buming), wood N (normal burning), electricity (oleolytic system) and charcoal. All these criteria were evaluated by a multidisciplinary group using national and international scientific information. The results showed that electricity is the best altemative because of its behaviour in each criteria (49%). Second place was for gas (30%). Both system were much more preferable than the others. This study suggest that the use of recent methodologies for environ? mental management represents the best way for acquiring the right decision in regard to a problem which is particularly important in public health. 440 ASSESSING EXPOSURE TO TRIHALOMETHANES IN WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE MICHELELYNBERG, NUCKOLS J, ASHLEY D, SINGER P, MENDOLA PAULINE, LANGLOIS P. cdc. EMail: mcl2@cdc.gov We conducted a field study in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Cobb County, Georgia with the objective of developing and evaluating exposure measures for trihalomethanes (THM). These areas were selected because the water utility serving them best met specific water quality criteria concerning THM levels and speciation. Participants were mothers living in either geographic area who gave birth to healthy infants between June 1998 and May 1999. Methods for assessing exposure included obtaining information on both water use habits and tap water characteristics. A number of approaches for classification of individual exposure were used: including two different interviews; a one-day diary concerning water use and consumption patterns; analysis of the residential water quality; metered water use at the residence; two blood analyses for THM; and computer-based total exposure modeling for inhalation, dermal absorption, and ingestion. This report focuses on the blood and water samples. The two 10 mL whole blood samples were collected prior to and immediately following showering (providing a biologic measure of the baseline and peak THM blood levels). Individual THM species levels (parts per trillion (pptr)) in whole blood were determined by heated purge and trap gas chromatography isotope dilution mass spectros? copy. Water samples were obtained from the water treatment plant, distribution system, and the resident's home. THM levels (parts per billion (ppb)) in the water samples were determined by liquid&amp;#64979;liquid extraction, using cap- illary column gas chromatography and electron capture detection. In the Corpus Christi tap water samples, brominated compounds accounted for over 75% of the mean TTHM concentration, while in Cobb County, chloroform accounted for 84% ofthe TTHM. The median baseline blood level of bromoform was 0.29 pptr and 3.5 pptr, for Cobb County mothers and Corpus Christi mothers, respectively (a 10-fold difference). The median baseline blood levels of chloro? form for mothers in Cobb County and Corpus Christi were 70 pptr and 25 pptr, respectively. The median peak bromoform blood levels were 0.38 pptr in Cobb County mothers and 17 pptr in Corpus Christi mothers. The median peak chloroform blood level in Cobb County was 280 pptr (range 130 to 1100 pptr) vs. 57 pptr (range 25 to 670 pptr) for Corpus Christi mothers. These results suggest that baseline and peak blood levels of THM species vary substantially across populations, depending on both water quality characteristics and water use habits. Such variation has important implications for epidemiologic studies of the potential health effects of disinfection byproducts. 437 ALCOHOL POISONING IN POLAND AND ITS RISK FACTORS - TIME SERIES ANALYSIS BOGDAN WOITYNIAK, RABCZENKO D, SEROKA W, STOKWISZE- WSKI J. National Institute of Hygiene. EMail: bogdan@medstat.waw.pl In Poland every ear there is about 1500 deaths due to accidental poisoning by alcohol. This number is almost the same as the number of deaths from asthma. Little is known about short and medium term variation in mortality from this cause and the factors that determine this variation. The purpose of our analysis was to asses the association between daily number of deaths from accidental poisoning in Poland and the following factors: month, day of week, holidays, increase in alcohol price (24 in study period), pay days, other special events and temperature. The study period covered years 1983-1996 and altogether comprised 5114 days. In the statis? tical analysis we applied generalized additive models. Alcohol poisoning affected primarily males, people less educated, more often urban than rural area residents. More than 90% of deaths occurred outside of hospitals. The average daily number of deaths was 4.0 and it varied from 0 to 16. We have found that number of deaths was significantly increased in cold months except January, paydays, during Easter holiday and in a week before alcohol price increase. On the other hand the deaths count was significantly lower on the beginning of week (Monday, Tuesday), in second and third week after alcohol price increase and in three days after Christmas. The risk of deaths was significantly and negatively associated with temper? ature. 441 AIR POLLUTION AND LOW BIRTH WEIGHT MILDRED MAISONET, BUSH T, JAAKKOLA JOUNI J.K.. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. EMail: mnml@cdc.gov Objectives: We assessed the relations between the risk of low birth weight (LBW) and exposures to ambient levels of carbon monoxide (CO), partic? ulate matter up to 10 m in diameter (PM10), and sulfur dioxide (S02) during the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: The study population comprised 101,153 singletons, term live births (37 to 44 weeks of gestation) that were born between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1996 in six cities of the northeastern United States: Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Springfield, and Washington, D.C. The outcome of interest was low birth weight (&lt; 2,500 grams). Information on birth weight and potential confounders were retrieved from the National Center for Health Statistics Natality Data Sets. Air monitoring data was obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We estimated, for each individual pregnancy, the average exposure to the studied air pollutants during the third trimester on the basis of the maternal residence information registered in the birth certificate and the correspond? ing air pollution concentrations in the cities where they lived. Results: In a logistic regression model including the three pollutants and other covariates, the risk of LBW was related to average third trimester exposure to CO (adjusted odds ratio [AORj=1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.15-1.85 per 1 ppm CO increase), but not to PM10 (AOR=1.00; CI=0.99-1.00 per 1 g/m3) and S02 (AOR=0.99;O=0.98-1.00 per 1 ppm). The effect of CO seemed to be strongest in infants whose third trimester occurred in winter. Conclusions: The results suggest that exposure to ambient air CO concen? trations, at the levels measured in U.S. urban areas, could be harmful to fetal development. A plausible effect mechanism is chronic placental hypoxia due to the capacity of CO to bind to hemoglobin.</page><page sequence="127">S128 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 442 A COMMUNITY-BASED SURVEY OF SELF-REPORTED GASTRO? ENTERITIS UNDERTAKEN DURING A WATERBORNE OUT? BREAK OF CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS PAUL HUNTER, SYED QUTUB. Public Health Laboratory Service. EMail: Paul.Hunter3@virgin.net The largest waterborne outbreak recorded world-wide was the 1993 outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee during 1993. However, the size of this outbreak was estimated from a retrospective community survey done by telephone some time after the outbreak was detected. Recent research has shown that retrospec? tive community-based surveys can dramatically over-estimate the prevalence of gastroenteritis. It is not clear whether the publicity that inevitably accompanies outbreak investigation would increase this overestimation. We took the oppor? tunity provided by a recent large outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the North West of England to conduct a study to attempt to validate retrospective community surveys as a technique for assessing the size of waterborne outbreaks. On 20 April 1999 cryptosporidial oocysts (3.4/L) were detected in routine 10L grab samples of water originating from Thirlmere reservoir in the English Lake District. During the following weeks it became clear that there was a sudden increase in reports of cryptosporidiosis in the North West Region. The large majority of cases were resident in the four health authorities that received most of their water from this treatment works. In total some 329 cases were identified in residents of these four authorities and a total of 551 cases in the region as a whole. The outbreak was classified as strongly associated with drinking water because of the finding of a high oocyst count in treated water and the descriptive epidemiological study which supported the hypothesis and did not identify any viable altemative hypothesis. The community-based survey was done in eight towns in the North West. Four towns were in the area affected by the outbreak and four were not. The four towns not within the affected area were chosen because of their geographical proximity to the outbreak area so that respondents would not necessarily know they were not resident within the outbreak area. The survey was sent out at the end of May and asked respondents whether they had suffered from compatible symptoms during the outbreak period. The outbreak will be described and the final results of the analyses of the community survey will be presented. Early indications are that retrospective community-based surveys dramatically over-estimate the number of cases of illness in outbreaks of waterborne disease. Consideration will be given to how epidemiological studies during outbreaks could be used to assess the true size of those outbreaks. 444 STABILITY OF DERIVED DEFINITIONS OF MEDICALLY UNEX? PLAINED SYMPTOMS: GULF WAR ILLNESS HOWARD KIPEN, BOYD K, WARTENBERG D, HALLMAN WK. EOHSI, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. EMail: kipen@eohsi.rutgers.edu Medically unexplained symptoms characterize a number of significant prob? lems in environmental and public health including Multiple Chemcial Sensitivities, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Sick Building Syn? drome, and Gulf War Illnesses. We have explored different strategies for definition of the apparently substantial overlap in symptoms between indi? viduals with these putatively distinct conditions and putatively distinct causes. This project examines both methodologic and substantive differences among research results in this field. . Previously, we presented data that compared the results of 4 different factor analytic techniques for identifica? tion of symptom patterns within a single data set of Gulf War veteran questionnaire responses. Thus we were comparing the effects of modestly different methods, and we found some differences in the number and constitution of factors that were identified. In this study we investigate the effect of deriving the factors from either of two different data sets of Gulf War veterans. One data set is much richer in likely cases (over 60%) whereas the other is more representative of the general population of veterans, and mixed with a non-veteran group, for an overall case representation of 25%?30%. The impact of case richness, and the associated variable of deployment status, will be examined as to how it affects further derived factors.

EMail: lrojasbr@hsph.harvard.edu This study aims to characterize personal exposures and indoor concentra? tions to PM2.5, PM10, 03, N02 and S02 in children aged 10 to 12. In addition, the study will identify factors that affect indoor concentrations and personal exposures, and will develop statistical and physico-chemical models to estimate indoor and personal exposure. In 1998 we conducted a pilot study, and in 1999 we finalized the extended study. In both settings we monitored two houses per week, for five consecutive weekdays. Seven and 18 children were included in the pilot and extended study, respectively. Per? sonal exposures, indoor and outdoor concentrations were measured for 12 hours (7am-7pm). Personal exposure monitors were used to collect personal PM samples, and Harvard impactors for indoor and outdoor samples. Passive monitors were used to sample 03, N02 and S02 in all three microenvi? ronments. Results from the pilot study showed that only particulate matter and N02 presented concentrations above their respective limits of detection. Median personal PM2.5 exposures were 69 /ig/m3, and median PM10 exposures were 164 jug/m3; indoor PM2.5 and PM10 medians were 67 and 143 /xg/m3, respectively; and, outdoor median values were 55 and 139 /mg/m3, respec? tively. For N02, mean personal, indoor and outdoor values were 29, 46 and 31 ppb, respectively. These results were expected and are consistent with those from earlier studies. People generate particles around their body to form a "personal cloud," which is thought to be originated by people's activities. As for N02, higher indoor concentrations probably resulted from the presence of gas stoves, a known source of N02 indoors, in each of the monitored homes. The analysis of the extended study is in process. Statistical and physico-chemical models will be developed in order to better understand the main determinants of personal exposures in this urban setting during the winter. 445 ACUTE ETS EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH HRV C. ARDEN POPE, EATOUGH DELBERT J., KANNER RICHARD E., PANG YANBO, NEILSON KAREN R., NATH PREMA. BYU. EMail: cap3@email.byu.edu Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has been associated with substantial cardiovascular disease and death. Potential pathophysiological pathways leading from ETS exposure to cardiopulmonary disease are still being explored. Reduced cardiac autonomic function as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with increase risk of cardiac death. Recent studies have observed changes in heart rate (HR) and HRV associated with acute changes in exposure to respiratory suspended particles (RSP). This study evaluated changes in exposure to ETS in a commercial airport with acute changes in cardiac autonomic function as measured by HR and HRV in a panel of 16 adult participants. Continuous ECG monitoring was conducted for a full eight hour period while participants alternated 2 hours in non-smoking and smoking areas. Air quality monitoring was also conducted in the smoking and non-smoking areas using specially designed air samplers. The ECG recordings for each participant were divided into time periods that corresponded to the periods in and out of the smoking area and HR and standard time-domain and frequency domain measures of HRV were calculated. Potential associations with ETS were evaluated statistically using pooled data and fixed-effects regression modeling techniques. Mean HR was not significantly associated with ETS exposure. ETS exposure was consistently negatively associated with all of the HRV measures. Measures of overall HRV and measures of power in the relatively low frequency ranges were more strongly associated with ETS than were estimates of the short- term components of variability. No clear differences were observed across former smoking status, age, or health status. The association between HRV and ETS exposure was greater for females than for males.</page><page sequence="128">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S129 446 CANCER MORTALITY AMONG TELECOMMUNICATION WORKERS HOW-RAN GUO, KE YING-FENG, GUO L. YUE-LIANG. National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. EMail: hrguo@mail.ncku.edu.tw The carcinogenic effects of strong inorganic acid mists were well docu? mented. We conducted a study on the employees of a large telecommuni- cation company in Taiwan to evaluate the cancer mortality associated with exposure to low-level acid mist. From 1985 to 1996, a total of 157 deaths were observed among approximately 100000 employees who had worked in buildings with battery rooms, and 48 of them died of cancer. Although the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for cancer was only 0.64, the low SMR for all causes of death (0.43, p &lt; 0.001) indicated a health worker effect. Using proportional mortality ratio (PMR) to adjust for the health worker effect, we observed increased risks for all cancers combined (PMR = 1.41, p = 0.03) and stomach cancer (PMR = 2.77, p = 0.02). The results suggested a positive correlation between working in buildings with battery rooms and cancer mortality among telecommunication workers. Because the effects of other health hazards in the working environment may also con? tributed to the increase in cancer mortality, further studies are needed to confirm our observations. 448 PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF CRYPTOSPORIDIUM GENOTYPING GORDON NICHOLS, MCLAUCHLIN J, AMAR C, PEDRAZA-DlAZ. Public Health Laboratory Service. EMail: gnichols@phls.nhs.uk Studies of the distribution of Cryptosporidium genotypes have identified three genotypes associated with human disease. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall pro? tein (COWP) was applied to DNA extracted from whole faeces from 1732 humans with cryptosporidiosis as detected by conventional light microscopy. Over 14 full months between 1998 and 1999 a total of 1295 of 5400 patients with cryptosporidiosis in England were typed, representing between 11 and 35% (average 23%) of all cases in each month. Genotype 1 was demon? strated in 31% of all cases, genotype 2 in 70% and genotype 3 in 0.3%, and 0.8% had both genotypes 1 and 2. Of 105 livestock animals tested all yielded genotype 2. Amongst 1187 sporadic Cyptosporidium cases where a genotype was estab? lished, marked temporal and geographic differences were observed. Geno? type 1 was significantly more common in patients infected during the summer and autumn and also in those with a history of recent foreign travel. The spring peak in cases was predominantly due to genotype 2. The geo? graphic distribution between the two main types showed some regions with over 80% of genotype 2 and others with approximately equal numbers of genotypes 1 and 2. There were 543 patients infected during thirteen water related outbreaks. Five of eight drinking water related outbreaks were predominantly due to genotype 1 and three to genotype 2. Two of five swimming pool associated outbreaks were due to genotype 1, one to genotype 2, and the remaining two involved both genotypes 1 and 2. Samples from 26 family groups of 2-3 persons were examined and the same genotype was recovered from the different members of each group, 13 were due to genotype 1 and 14 genotype 2. Two sequential samples from four of five patients had the same genotype on both occasions. The fifth patient had genotype 1 on one occasion and both genotypes 1 and 2 six days later. 447 LEAD IN CHILDREN IN URBAN AREAS IN DIFFICULTIES ANNE STEENHOUT. Free University of Brussels (ULB). EMail: asteen@ulb.ac.be Lead-free gasoline does not preclude excessive Pb exposure in children, more vulnerable to lead than adults. Safe blood Pb have been reduced by US authorities (Centers for Disease Control, CDC). The relative contribution of various remaining sources (drinking water, paint, etc) require reassessment. We are examining the relation between exposure, socio-economic status (SES) and type of housing in Brussels. Pb or mixed piping (lead/copper for example) are frequent in Belgium. The question of compliance to the European directive on quality of water intended for human consumption is discussed in terms of housing renovation and removal rate of lead pipework. Levels largely higher than Maximal Admissible Concentration (10 ju,g(mi- crog) Pb/1) occur in overnight samples, or after a few hours of stagnation during the day, or even after volumes of water have already been drawn for preparing meals. The EC reference sample (weekly average) may not ensure a proper evaluation of worst exposure encountered. Old lead paints flakes and dust are of concern too. Lead ingestion in young children is also increased due to poorer calcium intake in low SES children. This work about factors of exposure is a part of a risk assessment study including tooth lead level (a cumulative indicator we quantitatively related to blood lead) and biokinetics modeling. Due to its impact on blood lead, the 25/xg Pb/1 level accepted by the European Union for up to a 15 yr period should not be considered as safe, as other sources occur concomitantly. 450 ENHANCED EVALUATION OF DISINFECTANT BY-PRODUCT EXPOSURES FOR THE RE-ANALYSIS OF CANCER RISKS IN PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES PATRICIAA.MURPHY, CRAUN G, AMY G, KRASNER S, DUNDORF S. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EMail: murphy.patricia@epa.gov Analytic epidemiological studies in various geographic areas of North Amer? ica have reported associations between bladder, colon, and rectal cancer and chlorinated surface water systems. Inconsistent relative risk estimates (RR), both within and across studies and geographic regions, make a coherent interpretation of this literature difficult. The studies were conducted to estimate risks possibly associated with disinfectant by-products (DBPs)in drinking water; a major design limitation is that, among the many possible DBPs in chlorinated water, exposure to only total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) was evaluated. One explanation for the observed heterogeneity of the RRs is that there are important differences in the mix of DBPs in the various study areas which are obscured using the TTHM exposure variable. We explored the feasibility of obtaining more specific chemical exposure data to re-analyze these studies to evaluate this hypothesis. We assessed the validity of the published studies against standard epidemiologic criteria and evaluated the likely DBP mix for each study, using pertinent available data sources. We concluded that cancer studies conducted in Iowa, Colorado, Ontario (Canada), and Maryland were informative; that the DBP mix may differ among areas; and that water quality models using readily available historical water quality and treatment plant operational data to predict historical levels of THM species, haloacetic acids (HAAs), and other DBPs in these areas, could and should be developed. Water quality models that we developed and tested in Colorado, and to a limited extent in Ontario and Iowa, suggest it is feasible to develop regional or site-specific models for water utilities in these areas and use the models to construct retrospectively an integrated DBP exposure history for 30+ years. In Iowa (Cantor et al., 1998; Hildesheim et al., 1998)and in Ontario(King and Marrett, 1996), individual residential history and water consumption data can be linked to the predicted DBP levels to estimate individual chemical ingestion exposures for each case and control. The presentation focuses on the structure of the predictive DBP formation models, sources and surrogates for the necessary data elements, newly anticipated epidemiologic analyses and the uncertain- ties in this exposure reconstruction project.</page><page sequence="129">S130 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 453 SWISS NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH ACTION PLAN (NEHAP): BASELINE ASSESSMENT CALLS FOR ACTION SONIA KAHLMEIER, BIRCHER URS, HALLER DANIEL, KRANZLIN IRENE, BRAUN-FAHRLANDER CHARLOTTE. Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine of the. EMail: sonja.kahlmeier@bs.ch Since 1998, the Swiss NEHAP is translated into action. Its main goal is to promote health and well-being in a healthy environment. Emphasis is put on the intensification of intersectorial cooperation to strengthen the environ? ment and health network. Baseline data has now been collected, against which progress will be compared in 5 and 10 years, respectively. This baseline assessment demonstrates a need for action. In the area of "Nature and well-being" the Swiss NEHAP aims at 75% of the population being in a position to consume healthy and balanced food (including environmental aspects of food consumption like harmony with seasons, regionally produced food and type of production) and thus to contribute to sustainable agricul? ture. Actually, 2/3 of the population pay attention to the type of food they consume (not too much fat, enough vegetables/ffuit etc), but only 45% consider seasonality when buying food, 34% the geographic origin of a product and 24% the type of production (e.g. organic). Only 52% have good knowledge of seasonality and there exists a discrepancy between knowledge and behavior. A further target of the NEHAP is the promotion of organic production. In future, 30% of the agriculturally productive land should be cultivated organically whilst actually just 6.7% is cultivated this way. An important goal of the NEHAP in the area of "Mobility and well-being" is the attainment of the Swiss Air Quality Standards. Actually, 70% of the population are exposed to N02-levels above the standard (30 jLig/m3), 61% to increased PMlO-levels (above 20 u,g/m3) and almost 100% to 03-levels exceeding the limit of 120 /mg/m3 for several hundred hours during summer. A further aim of the NEHAP is the doubling of joumeys made by bicycle as an example of ecologically harmless and self-sustained mobility. Currently, the bicycle is used for 5-7% of journeys. In the area "Housing and well-being", a specific aim is the reduction of exposure to involuntary environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Baseline data indicate that 60% of non-smoking Swiss are exposed to ETS at the work? place (on average 3.5 hours/day) and 35% report to be frequently annoyed by ETS in restaurants. 47% of Swiss schoolchildren are exposed to ETS at home. The process and the results of the implementation of the Swiss NEAHAP will be thoroughly evaluated as well. 502 ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS FOR PRESENCE OF CRYP? TOSPORIDIUM PARVUM ANTIBODIES IN HUMAN SERUM ELIZABETH HILBORN, FROST FLOYD, MULLER T, CALDERON RE? BECCA. US EPA. EMail: hilbom.e@epa.gov Background - Cryptosporidium parvum is a parasite that infects a variety of vertebrate hosts. Sources of infection include contaminated raw produce and drinking water. Outbreaks of foodborne and waterborne infection are infre- quently reported, yet serological evidence suggests that infection may commonly occur. Methods - We analyzed serum and data gathered from a convenience sample of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III participants to identify risk factors for the presence of anti-cryptosporidial antibodies. Seropos- itivity was defined as: those samples determined to contain IgG antibodies to 15/17 kDa proteins by the enzyme-linked immunoelectro-transfer blot assay with an intensity of response greater than 10% of a positive control. Data were characterized by univariate analysis. Bivariate statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were used to determine rhe association between gender, age, race, city of residence, salad and water consumption, serum carotenoids (bi? omarkers of exposure to produce), pet ownership, antacid and bottled water usage, home water source, and seropositivity. Results - Of 1356 participants, 558 (41%) were seropositive. Persons resided in seven cities and ranged in age from 1-90 years (median: 38 years); 50% were female, 50% white race, 25% African- American race, and 22% Hispanic ethnicity. Seropositivity varied by city (range: 29% - 57%). Older participants were significantly more likely to be seropositive (trend p&lt; 0.0001). The full regression model included gender, age, race, city, and serum alpha-carotene, all significantly associated with seroposi? tivity; inclusion of an increased water consumption variable in the model improved the fit, but was not statistically significant (p=0.09). No other variables listed above were significantly associated with seropositivity. Conclu? sion - These data suggest that significant differences in seropositivity exist among populations of different cities, and that prevalence of seropositivity increases with age. Increased serum alpha-carotene is significantly associated with seropositivity. Although serum alpha-carotene levels have been correlated with consumption of produce, the biomarker is not specific to the raw produce items which may be potential vehicles for oocysts. Although exposure to municipal water (by city) and serum alpha-carotene appear to be independent risk factors for seropositivity, unmeasured differences in food consumption, behavior, or cultural practices among persons living in various geographic areas may contribute to these findings. This is an abstract of a proposed presentation and does not necessarily reflect EPA policy. 501 USING DENSITY EQUALIZING MAP PROJECTION (DEMP) IN EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEILLANCE: AN ANALYSIS OF FEMALE BREAST CANCER INCIDENCE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA CHRISTINE ERDMANN, SELVIN STEVE, MERRILL DEANE W.. Uni? versity of California at Berkeley. EMail: erdmann@socrates.berkeley.edu This study examined the spatial distribution of female breast cancer inci? dence in the San Francisco Bay Area (California, U.S.A.) in relation to various demographic variables using cartograms for control of population density. Using a map technique known as density equalized map projection (DEMP), census tract boundaries of geopolitical maps are transformed such that the resultant census tract areas are proportional to their population at risk. With spatial confounding removed, the maps become more useful for identifying potential causal factors associated with geography, including environmental factors. Breast cancer incidence data for the years 1988 to 1992 were obtained from the United States National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Population data from the 1990 census were obtained from the United States Census Bureau. Using the DEMP algorithm developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, transformed census tract maps were created for two age groups (30-49 years and 50-69 years), two race groups (Non-Hispanic White and African-American), and two geographic sub-areas within the San Francisco Bay Area. Cases of breast cancer were plotted on the transformed maps and a density estimation function was applied. Contours of risk were plotted on the density equalized maps. High risk areas identified on each density equalized map were then marked on its corresponding geopolitical map. Census tracts of high case density were compared with census tracts of low case density with respect to various sociodemographic characteristics using descriptive and logistic regression analysis. 504 IMPROVED DIOXIN EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT USING HIGH RESOLUTION GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROME? TRY ARNOLD SCHECTER, PAEPKE O, RYAN J, PISKAC A. University of Texas-Houston School of Public Health at. EMail: arnold.schecter? email.swmed.edu In 1983, dioxin congener-specific human blood and fat analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectometry (gc-ms) was first performed in US work? ers and the general population. Patterns of dioxin and dibenzofuran conge? ners matched environmental sample patterns from a Binghamton, New York PCB transformer fire. This congener specific analyses also documented contamination of the general US population with dioxins and dibenzofurans. This improved method of exposure assessment was first used in an epidemi? ology study when NIOSH reported a correlation between cancer and ele? vated dioxin blood levels. Later studies demonstrated characteristic patterns of dibenzofurans and dioxins in American and Japanese municipal inciner- ator workers (elevated dibenzofurans with some elevated dioxins), and Russian men and women chemical production workers and their children (elevated TCDD, a dioxin, and PnCDD). Characteristic dioxin blood pat? terns were found in German chemical workers over 35 years after exposure, and in American Vietnam veterans decades after exposure to Agent Orange contaminated with TCDD. Vietnamese in the south of Vietnam were found to have TCDD as high as 1,850 parts per trillion (ppt) in 1970, the last year Agent Orange was sprayed. TCDD in Vietnamese living in Vietnam gen? erally declined until new samples collected and analyzed in 1999 from Vietnam showed elevated TCDD (above 4-10 ppt) in some persons from recent exposure with levels as high as 271 ppt TCDD. Most Vietnamese food and human tissue did not contain elevated dioxin. Elevated TCDD was found only in some parts of southern Vietnam where Agent Orange was used. In the north of Vietnam where no Agent Orange was sprayed, and where less synthetic chemicals were used, dioxin levels were markedly lower than southern levels in humans and in lake sediment. Very low dioxin levels were found in north of Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Thailand, India, and much of Russia. Chinese exposed to chlorophenols used to kill snails (to eliminate schistosomiasis) had elevated tissue levels of the higher chlori? nated dioxins and dibenzofurans characteristic of chlorophenols. High res- olution gc-ms of human tissues, now usually blood, taking dioxin toxicoki- netics into account, is useful in exposure assessment and in determining source of these compounds. A limited number of dioxin laboratories have been certified by WHO for these analyses. Cost per analysis is now less than previously. No biological or chemical screening tests are currently in com? mon use since these usually do not provide congener specific data, dioxin levels, and total dioxin toxic equivalent levels.</page><page sequence="130">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S131 509 IODINE DEFICIENCY IN HUNGARY AND ITS POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE HEALTH PARAMETERS OF THE POPULATION BY THE HELP OF GIS PROGRAM IFARKAS, SAJGO M, PALDY A, NADOR G. Nat.l Public Health Centre, Nat.l Inst. for Environmental. EMail: farkas@mail.joboki.hu The iodine map of the drinking water was compared to the distribution of morbidity and mortality data in Hungary with the help of the GIS pro? gramme. 80 % of the population is iodine deficient, consuming water with iodine content below 25 ug/L and the urinary iodine excretion, the biolog? ical marker of the iodine status is low, the goiter frequency among children of 7-11 years was about 20 %. On the contrary there are several towns where the iodine content of the drinking water is 100 - 500 ug/L and the urinary iodine excretion is above 100 ug/L, the goiter frequency there was about 5 %. Iodine supplementation is still lacking and the present situation gives an excellent opportunity to study the role of iodine deficiency in some health parameters. Pathologic events of the thyreoidea are known to be more frequent on iodine deficient area, hypo- and hyperthyreosis as well and the thyreoid cancer cases are different by histological picture. Thyreodectomy because of follicular cancer were double in frequency and follicular forms were less in iodine deficient area similarly to the literature data. The age of the patients with cardiac infarction was higher and persons with the need of care with cerebrovascular events were lower in iodine rich area than in iodine deficient area. The occurrence of spontaneous abortion, hepatitis among pregnant women and hepatic cirrhosis was lower in iodine rich area. Earlier the authors reported about the possible protective role of iodine in the carcinogenicity of arsenics (ISEE 1996). The present data support the role of iodine as a regulator of basic metabolismus that are important in several health processes. 514 ASSOCIATION OF AIR POLLUTION WITH DAILY CONSULTA- TIONS WITH GENERAL PRACTITIONERS FOR ALLERGIC RHI? NITIS IN LONDON. SHAKOOR HAIAT, HAINES A, ATKINSON RW, BREMNER S, ANDERSON HR, EMBERLIN J. royal free and university college medical school. EMail: s.hajat@ucl.ac.uk Objectives: Few published studies have looked at the effects of air pollution on health in the primary care setting; and of these most have concentrated on the effects on lower rather than on upper respiratory diseases. We investigated the relationship between daily GP consultations for allergic rhinitis and air pollution in London. Methods: Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to regress time series of daily numbers of patients consulting for allergic rhinitis against measures of air pollution; controlling for time-trends, seasonality, day-of- week cycles, influenza, temperature, humidity and pollen levels, with adjust? ments for overdispersion and serial correlation. The consultation data were available from between 44,406 to 49,596 patients aged 0-14 and 185,267 to 204,039 aged 15-64. These patients were registered with between 45 to 47 London practices contributing to the General Practice Research Database during 1992-1994. Results: Sulphur dioxide (S02) and ozone (03) were both highly signifi? cantly associated with increases in consultations for allergic rhinitis in both children and adults, and there were also significant positive associations with particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (N02). In general, esti? mates were largest for concentrations three or four days prior to consultation in children and slightly longer in adults. In children, a 10th-90th percentile increase in S02 levels four days prior to consultation (13-31 mg/m3) was associated with a 24.5% increase in consultations (95% CI 14.6, 35.2) P&lt;0.00001; and a 10th-90th percentile increase in averaged 03 concentra? tions on the day of consultation and the preceding three days (6-29 ppb) was associated with a 37.6% rise (23.3, 53.5) P&lt;0.00001. Smaller effect sizes were observed in the case of adults and S02 and 03. Associations with N02 and PM10 were abolished in the presence of S02, and that of 03 was slightly attenuated. The association with S02 remained highly significant in the presence of other pollutants. Conclusions: This study suggests that air pollution worsens the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, leading to substantial increases in consultations. S02 and 03 seem to be the pollutants particularly responsible and both seem to make an independent contribution. 512 ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; HEALTH SITUATION OF SHKODRA DIS?

The main objective was the identifi? cation of rhe environmental problems in rhe Shkodra District, their hygienic situation. The study areas included drinking water quality as a priority, waste? water discharges, solid waste management, air pollution, food products control and health situation as well. The other. specific objective was the implementa? tion of group work method to the District sanitary inspector's. The study should be considered as an appeal also, for assistance and co-operation to all the parties that may influence and help the process of improving the environ? mental situation in Albania.

The collection of necessary information and all materials needed for the study were gathered in collaboration with Sanitary inspectors of the District through, The consultation with the database of the HED of the District, Field visits and Sanitary inspections in the drinking water distribution network from its natural source to the consumer, sewage facilities, industrial enterprises, Hospital center etc. Consulting and meetings with local authorities in a Municipality, etc. The drinking water distribution network of Shkodra city and rural areas had many damages, contributing to the lack of water, low pressure and mtermittent water supply. The only treatment done is chlorinating with the manual manner with low efficiency in water disinfecting. 33.3 % of rural networks hasn't any possibility for disinfecting. The sanitary protection zones in many places does not respect This entire situation might have the potential health impact to the populations. Urban untreated wastewater's of Shkodra city and hospital's one discharged into the Drini river and sometimes in rhe Shkodra lake, affecting human health, flora and fauna also. The industrial wastewater's with a open channel were discharged into the river Kir which after 2.5 km is linked with Drini river. After 1992 all enterprises and factories were closed and in 1996 their waste? water discharges was in a low level. Solid waste (about 90 ton per day) management together with the solid wastes of 6 hospitals, realized only with collecting, transport and disposal into a vicinity of river Kir, helping its pollution. The air pollution, only with S02 and Soot determination, dispute with the reduction of industrial emis? sions, continues to increase due to the large number of old cars. The general morbidity of local population was in high level as well. The recommendations of this situation were rhe urgent rehabiiitation in most of the water distribution networks and introduce of the automatic chlorinating of drinking water. The treatment of the effluent of wastewater was very important in the healrh hazard reduction.

K, HENNEMAN T, FENSTER L, SWAN S. CA Dept. of Health Services. EMail: gwindham@dhs.ca.gov In previous studies we found an elevated risk of spontaneous abortion (SAB) with increased consumption of tap water in a specific region of CA. We subsequently noted an association between SAB and higher consumption of water containing high total trihalomethane (THM) levels and high bromodi- chloromerhane levels. To determine wherher THM's are associated with other reproductive endpoints and to identify possible mechanisms for the SAB effects, we are examining THM exposure and menstrual function in a study of 400 women of reproductive age. They collected urine samples daily for up to 6 months (average 4-4 menstrual cycles) to measure steroid metabolite levels rhat were used to define menstrual parameters such as cycle length and variability, phase length, menses length and ovulatory status. At baseline, the women were asked how many glasses of various beverages they usually consumed daily, including drinks of, or made from, cold tap water at home. A THM exposure data base was assembled using quarterly measurement data from water utilities in die study area. Subject address(es) were geo-coded and assigned the THM level measured during an individual 90 day window based around the date urine collection began. We analyzed menstrual parameters as continuous and cate? gorical variables (e.g. mean cycle length and risk of short cycle) in relation to various exposure measures including amount of tap water consumed, THM level, and their product to estimate the dose of THM from consumption (THM level X # glasses/ day). In adjusted models rhat accounted for repeated measures, we found little difference in the mean or bivariate cycle parameters by amount of tap water consumed. There appears to be some variation by categories of THM dose consumed, but not in a monotonic dose response pattern. For example, cycles in the middle exposure category were about three times as likely to be short (&lt; 24 days) as cycles in the no(95% CI=1.5-6.5) or high exposure categories. This was also reflected in about a doubled risk of a short luteal phase (OR=1.9; 95% 0=0.70-5.1). The adjusted mean cycle length of this group was 1.3 days shorter (p=0.09) than in the non-exposed group and the mean luteal phase length was 0.6 days shorter (p=0.02). The trends towards increased risk of short cycle and luteal phase were also noted in the highest THM level group (&gt;80ug/L). We will explore further rhe reasons for this pattern, including calculating risks associated with specific THM compounds and considering potential exposure from showering.</page><page sequence="131">S132 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 522 INVESTIGATING SUSCEPTIBILITY FACTORS RELATED TO AR?

EMail: rhaque@socrates.berkeley.edu An environmental tragedy has been discovered in West Bengal, India, where over 800,000 inhabitants are consuming water that is geologically contam? inated with inorganic arsenic. Arsenic is known to cause a variety of health effects, but individuals' susceptibility factors are not established. Early man- ifestations of arsenic include skin keratoses of the palms and soles, and hyperpigmentation of the limbs and torso. A 1996 cross-sectional study of an arsenic-affected district in West Bengal surveyed 7,683 residents regarding health effects and measured arsenic content in their drinking water supplies. More than 400 individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions were identified, over 200 of whom were exposed to less than 500 ug of arsenic/L. This completed survey offered a unique opportunity to investigate susceptibility factors related to arsenic-detoxification mechanisms. Using a case- control design nested in the cross-sectional survey, 200 skin lesion cases were interviewed along with 200 randomly selected age- and sex-matched controls. Urine samples were also collected from these participants. Arsenic is believed to be metabolized into less toxic monomethylarsonate and dimethylarsinate via methylation, but a portion remains in the inorganic form. To determine if susceptibility to skin lesions is related to individual methylation effi? ciency, we compared the percent of inorganic arsenic in total arsenic in the urine of cases versus controls. Preliminary analyses of urine samples from the first 60 cases and 99 controls were conducted for those with more than 50 ug/L of total arsenic in urine. Arsenic methylation efficiency was estimated by the proportion of arsenic that remained in the inorganic form. On average, 17% of urinary arsenic was found to be in inorganic form (16% in cases and 17% in controls). In participants with greater than 26% arsenic in the inorganic form (the upper 20th percentile), the estimated odds ratio for skin lesions was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.19-1.92). While the confidence interval is wide, there is no evidence at this stage in the study of an increased risk of skin lesions among individuals who methylate poorly. 524 NUMBER OF REPEATED MEASUREMENTS NEEDED TO PRO? VIDE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF MEAN ANNUAL FRONT DOOR BENZENE CONCENTRATION VFANO, IAVARONEI, LAGORIO S, MICHELOZZI PAOLA, BIGGERI A, SALVAN A, PALLOTTIG, FORASTIERE F. Agency of Public Health, Lazio Region (Italy). EMail: epiamb@sirio.regione.lazio.it Background. Monitoring strategies based on repeated individual measure? ments allow to increase the reliability of mean personal exposure estimates and to reduce the bias in dose-response relationships. Objectives. To determine the number of repeated measurements needed to provide a reliable estimate of mean annual front-door benzene concentration. Methods. A reliability analysis was carried out using data from a benzene measure? ment survey conducted in Rome in 1996 (50 sampling sites; 22 repeats per site over one year). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for a single measure (ICC1) was derived from a two-way (season and site) random effect analysis of variance for repeated measures of log-transformed concentrations. The reliability of the average of k measures (ICCk) was then computed using the Spearman-Brown formula. Parallelism of measures within season and site was assumed. The non-balanced nature of the design and the season-speciflc variability were taken into account. Results. Mean annual benzene levels ranged from 11.4 to 47.7 mg/m3 over all sampling sites, and from 19.3 to 31.4 mg/m3 over seasons. Both the sampling site (F49;673= 8.07; p-value&lt;0.001) and the season (F3;673= 3.67; p-val- ue&lt;0.001) were strong predictors of the benzene levels. Reliability of one measure was poor for all seasons. ICCk computation suggested a range of 8 to 16 repeats per year (1-2 measures in winter; 2-4 measures in spring and autumn; and 3-6 measures in summer) in order to achieve a reliability between 40% and 60% (a level characterised as "good" by Landis and Koch) (Table 1). Table 1. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients for k = 1. . .8 repeats per site, by season Conclusions. Front-door benzene levels may be used as proxies for individual ben? zene exposure from outdoor sources. Findings from this study may support strategies for reduction of measurement error through repeated measures. However, in our study variability in benzene levels was restricted by design, as we excluded both sampling sites with close proximity to emission sources and sampling days with unusual weather conditions. In an epidemiological study based on front-door ben? zene measurements the above sampling restrictions would not operate. In feet, one would expect a higher variability than observed in our study, which would make our sample size indications conservative. 523 ARSENIC-INDUCED SKIN LESIONS AND NUTRITION IN A POPULATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN NORTHERN CHILE ALEXANDRA HERNANDEZ, ARROYO A, BEERIS M, MAZUMDER D, KOSNETT M, MOORE L, SMITH M, SMITH A. U.C. Berkeley. EMail: halexa@uclink4-berkeley.edu Atacamenos, indigenous people of northern Chile, have been exposed to high levels of arsenic in drinking water for centuries. Anecdotal accounts that arsenic-induced skin lesions do not exist in this population have led to suggestions that adaptation may have occurred over time to protect against arsenic-caused health effects. An additional hypothesis has been proposed that malnutrition may increase susceptibility, an idea derived from studies in Taiwan and West Bengal, populations where both arsenic skin effects and malnutrition are prevalent. We therefore conducted the first intensive investigation of arsenic-induced skin lesions and nutrition in the Atacameno population. Eleven families from Chiu Chiu, a village with 750-800 ug/L of inorganic arsenic (InAs), and 8 families from Caspana, a village with 10 ug/L InAs, were invited to participate in our study. Each participant was exam? ined by 4 physicians familiar with arsenic-induced lesions who were blind to the exposure status of the patient. Each family took part in a structured interview that included nutrition as measured by weekly food consumption. Chiu Chiu participants consisted of 11 men (average age 38), 11 women (average age 36), 14 boys, and 9 girls (average age 11). Caspana participants consisted of 8 men (average age 48), 8 women (average age 46), 6 boys (average age 13) and 9 girls (average age 15). Four of the men, no women, and 2 children from Chiu Chiu were affected with skin lesions. The average body mass index (BMI) of the 4 affected men was 25.3, of the 7 unaffected men 26.0, and of the men from Caspana 27.4, none significantly different from each other or the U.S. average. Food frequency data also did not suggest that malnutrition was a factor. The families in which cases were found reported eating an average of 9 servings of fruit per week, 26 servings of vegetables, and 5 servings of animal protein. The unaffected families and the families from the control village had similar eating patterns. Further inves? tigations are being conducted including blood nutrient assays and urinary metabolite measures. However, from the findings to date, it does not appear that these people have a lower incidence of arsenic-induced skin lesions than those in Taiwan and West Bengal, India, nor does it appear that they are protected by good nutrition. 525 BLOOD LEAD IN PRIMARY STUDENTS FROM SANTIAGO (CHILE) MAURICIO ILABACA, SANCHEZ J, BRAVO R, VINAS M, MARTIN M, SOTO I, CAMPO E, SOLARI V, HERNANDEZ J. servicio de salud.

University of Otago. EMail: shales@wnmeds.ac.nz Health scientists have the difficult task of estimating the likely types and ranges of future health impacts associated with global climate change. One way in which scientists can approach this task is by reference to "analogue" situations that foreshadow aspects of global climate change. One such aspect, foreseen by many climatologists, is an increase in the variability of regional climate patterns. El Nifio is the best example of natural climate variability on a year-to-year time scale and is known to affect human health in many ways. In this paper, we present original findings of the relationships between communicable disease and El Nino, including studies of dengue fever, Ross River virus and ciguatera. We briefly discuss how these climate-health relationships might help us to understand - and respond to - the effects of global climate change. 530 VITAMINS A, E AND C IN MATERNAL AND CORD BLOOD AND PREGNANCY OUTCOME I DEIMEK, SOLANSKY I, STAVKOVA ZDENA, BENES I, SRAM R. Inst.Experiment.Medicine Acad.Sci. Czech Rep. EMail: dejmekj@ms.anet.cz Vitamin status may influence fetal development and the effects of exogenous noxae. A possible relationship between vitamins in blood and pregnancy outcome was studied in Teplice a highly polluted district of Northern Bohemia. Vitamins A, E and C at delivery were examined in venous and cord blood of about 700 mothers in a nested case control study. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), low birth weight &lt;2,500g (LBW) and prema? ture births&lt;37 weeks (PB) were used as outcome measures. Adjusted Odds Ratios (AORs) of adverse outcomes for 3 levels (tertiles) of each vitamin (low, medium-M and high-H) and for their continuous values were esti? mated after adjustment for a range of covariates using logistic regression models. A crude ORs of IUGR decreased significantly along increasing levels of vitamin C in maternal blood (for M=0.54 P&lt;0.02 and for H=0.36 P&lt;0.0001). An adjustment (e.g. for education AOR=4.71;CI 2,08-10.68) reduced this association: AOR for M=0.86;CI 0.46-1.59 and for H=0.64;CI 0.36-1.11 (trend P&lt;0.08). For mothers with &lt;0.4mg/dl of vitamin C in blood AOR of IUGR was 2.43; (1.26-5.88). A highly significant relation? ship was observed between vitamin A in cord blood and PB: AOR for M=0.53; CI 0.27-1.06 and for H=0.18; CI 0.07-0.45 (trend P&lt;0.0003). This relationship was linear in wide range of vitamin concentrations. No association was found between vitamin E and endpoints studied.

Institute of Public Health of Republic of Slovenia. EMail: andrej.perc@gov.si The Republic of Slovenia covers approximately 2,025,000 hectares, of which approximately 410,624 hectares is cultivable land. Figures on import quan? tities of active substances show that in the past ten years the consumption of plant protection products per hectare of cultivable land in Slovenia has exceeded the standards for West European countries. In Slovenia food is subject to continuous monitoring for pesticide residues. The main objectives are to monitor the residue levels in food on the market in relation to health hazards and to verify compliance with existing regula? tions. During a 24-month period (from 1997 to 1999) laboratories in Slov? enia analysed some 1,262 samples of food for organophosphate pesticide (OPPs) residues. Permanent monitoring of the chemical pollution of soil has not yet been established in Slovenia. Current legislation concerning soil quality does not include OPPs as dangerous substances. Due to their short degradation times, OPPs were not considered a threat to the quality of drinking water in Slovenia and dierefore permanent monitoring of this group of parameters was never begun. In 1998 we carried out a trial analysis of a number of drinking water sources. OPP analysis was included and the OPP values from all the samples taken were below detectable limits. In June 1999 Slovenia's Institute of Public Health began a case study in Miren to examine the exposure of workers and residents near the pear plantations there to the pesticides used to spray the plantations. The spray? ing included OPPs. There is virtually no control over the distribution and handling of pesticides in Slovenia. According to available data annual consumption of pesticides in Slovenia varies from 1,452 to 7,000 tonnes. However, positive movements are being made as far as the use of pesticides in Slovenia is concerned. Integrated fruit production began ten years ago in Slovenia. This paper has been written with a view to presenting the situation in Slovenia regarding rhe use of OPPs and to establishing the consequences associated with OPP emissions into the environment. In rhis paper we will present the legisla- tive acts in this area, the results of food analysis carried out in 1997 and 1998 for presence of OPPs, the results of water analysis and the results of the case study in Miren. Proposals and suggestions will also be made regarding control over the use of OPPs and measures to reduce their use in fruit production. 605 EARLY LIFE FACTORS AS PREDICTORS OF PREVALENCE OF ASTHMATIC SYMPTOMS AMONG 7-11 YEAR OLD CHILDREN P RUDNAI, LEONARDI GIOVANNI, HOUTHUIJS D, NIKIFOROV BOJIDAR, HRUBA FRANTISKA, FABIANOVA ELEONORA, NICIU EMILIA MARIA, PATTENDEN SAM, FLETCHER T, VOLF JARO- SLAV, ZEJDA JAN. National Institute of Environmental Health, National. EMail: rudnai@okil.joboki.hu Introduction. Some factors affecting the children's health in the early period of their life have been found of importance in relation to the respiratory health of these children in later life although the mechanisms of their action are still not clear. We analysed these associations and the interrelationships of the various early life factors in the frame of the CESAR (Central European Study of Air pollution and Respiratory health) Study performed in 25 communities of six Central European countries involving altogether 20,271 children of 7-11 years of age. Methods: All children visiting the appropriate classes of schools in the 25 areas were invited to join the study. Their parents were asked to fill in a questionnaire with items on the children's present and past health status, family history of respiratory problems, household characteristics (including indoor pollution sources) and the socio-economic status of the families. The overall response rate was 64 %. A combined outcome variable of asthmatic symptoms was created from 6 questions all relating the occurrence either of wheezing or doctor diagnosed asthma attacks or asthmatic/spastic/obstructive bronchitis during the last 12 months. The following early life factors were chosen for evaluating their associations with asthmatic symptoms: parental wheezing, smoking during preg? nancy, length of pregnancy, birth complications, twin births, age of the mother, breast-feeding, attending a nursery and family size. The statistical analysis was performed by logistic regression using Stata 5. Odds ratios were calculated after adjustment for age, sex and area. Results. Parental wheezing and lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRI) during the first two years of life were found to have the strongest association with the prevalence of asthmatic symptoms during the last twelve months. In the case of one parent wheezing the odds ratio (OR) was 2.65 (95 % confidence intervals: 2.42-2.89) while both parents wheezing gave an odds ratio of 4-39 (3.88-4.96). The OR for asthmatic symptoms of children with LRI during the first two years of life was 3.70 (3.40-4.04). Smoking during pregnancy, preterm birth, small birth weight, perinatal complications, birth order, lack of breast feeding, having attended nurseries, as well as the number of the household members were also found to be significant risk factors. Conclusion: Our findings in Central Europe support the notion that factors affecting the children around the time of birth or in the first two years of life may have a long-term impact on their health status at age 7 to 11.</page><page sequence="133">S134 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 606 TRIHALOMETHANE EXPOSURE AND RISK OF SELECTED BIRTH DEFECTS BRUCE LIN, LYNBERG MICHELE, WONG L, SINGER P, MENDOLA PAULINE. Dyntel. EMail: bel9@cdc.gov Epidemiologic studies associating trihalomethane (THM) exposure with developmental outcomes have used varied exposure assessment approaches, making comparisons of results across studies difficult. Public water system monitoring records were used in this population-based case-control investi? gation of selected birth defects to assess the impact of various exposure time windows on THM exposure classification and birth defects risk estimates. Control infants (n=301) and infants with defects previously associated with THM exposure, neural tube, cleft and cardiac (n=316), were bom between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 1996 in metropolitan Atlanta. Based on residence at birth, subjects were assigned to water systems using GIS. THM exposure was determined using system wide averages from each utility. Various cutpoints were explored including 40, 60 and 80 ug/L, as well as tertiles and quartiles of exposure. Risk estimates for all defects combined varied around 1.0 regardless of exposure window and were not significant. The authors attempted to refine exposure assessment and restricted the analysis to the infants with exposure data available during the time window of vulnerability for specific defects. For neural tube defects, averages of THM levels one month before and one month after the date of conception were used, while averages of THM levels during the first two months of pregnancy were used to classify exposure for cardiac and cleft defects. Prevalence odd ratios (POR) were generated using logistic regression for each defect and for the combined group of defects with restricted exposure windows. The au? thors are continuing to evaluate the risk among more homogeneous sub? groups (e.g. specific type of defect and the presence of multiple defects). None of the preliminary results for broad defect/exposure window categories were significant, but changing the exposure window resulted in different point estimates (NTD risk ranged from OR=0.38 to OR=1.34) suggesting the importance of exposure window definitions in estimating risk. 609 INITIAL INVESTIGATION OF SYMPTOMATIC PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN IN AN AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY PAULINE MENDOLA, WALSH D, HERN S, GONZALES M, HILBORN ELIZABETH, NEEDHAM L, BARR D, ROBERTSON G, RHONEY S, ROYSTER M, CARTY C. US EPA. EMail: mendola.pauline@epa.gov Pesticide exposure among children in agricultural communities is a great public health concern. Very little data are available on the prevalence of exposure and the potential for unrecognized pesticide-related illness among pre-school children. This initial study attempts to identify symptoms that may be related to pesticide exposure in young children and to explore whether clinical settings can be used to identify children at high risk of pesticide exposure in an agricultural community. Eligible children were between the ages of 2 and 4 years, reporting to a participating pediatric clinic with flu-like symptoms between October 18 and November 4, 1999. Children were screened for eligibility and trained interviewers obtained informed consent. Nearly three-quarters of the inter? views were conducted in Spanish, the remainder in English. Of the 122 children who participated, the majority were male (62%), and toilet trained (89%). According to parental report, half of the children did not have any recent pesticide exposure and 13% of parents were unsure. Of the 37% who did report recent exposure, the most common routes were living next to sprayed fields, home use of pesticides, and contact with parents in work clothes upon retuming from farm work. The most common symptoms reported were: malaise (69%), loss of appetite (67%), trouble breathing or wheezing (50%), abdominal pain (43%), leth- argy (41%), weakness (38%), headache (37%), vomiting (37%) and nausea (34%). Children whose parents reported recent pesticide exposure were more likely to have diarrhea (chi square = 9.6, df = 1, p&lt;0.01) and dizziness (chi square = 3.8, df = 1, p = 0.05). No other symptoms were associated with parental report of exposure. Urine samples were obtained from 112 children for analysis of organophos- phate pesticide metabolites. Children who were still in diapers were less likely to provide a urine sample (64%) than toilet-trained children (95%). Finger stick blood samples were collected from 106 children for measurement of cholinesterase activity. Further analyses of symptoms in relation to bio? logic results are planned as well as comparison of parental report of exposure with the presence of pesticide metabolites.

Occupational Health Program, Department of. EMail: rests@channing.harvard.edu Chronic exposure to lead at high concentrations can result in a high risk of chronic nephropathy. The issue of toxicity to renal function at relatively low levels of lead exposure remains controversial. Increased bone demineraliza- tion due to aging increases lead mobilization from bone and, as a result, may increase the risk of nephropathy among middle-aged and elderly individuals. In this prospective study with 3-year follow-up, the relationship of lead levels in bone and blood to renal function was examined using multiple regression analysis among 447 middle-aged and elderly men (mean age of 66 years old at baseline), a subset sample of the Normative Aging Study. Bone lead may impair kidney function either directly or indirectly via circulating lead or elevated blood pressure. It is difficult to distinguish the interactive effects of these factors on kidney dysfunction using traditional multiple regression analysis. Structural equation modeling (SEM), which can partition the variance in a set of interrelated outcomes, was applied here to differentiate the direct and indirect effects of bone lead on kidney dysfunction. We used a K-x-ray fluorescence instrument to measure lead content in cortical (tibia) and trabecular (patella) bone, and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy to measure lead in blood, respectively. Lead levels were generally low at baseline, with median blood lead, patella lead and tibia lead values of 6 ug/dl, 31 ug/g, and 21 ug/g, respectively. Serum creatinine concentration at follow-up visit (mean of 1.0 mg/dl) was lower than at baseline (mean of 1.2 mg/dl). Results from multiple regression analysis showed that the 3-year follow-up serum creatinine was positively associated with lead levels in blood and bone, after adjustments for time elapsed until follow-up and baseline measures of age, upper arm circumference, and serum creatinine. A 10-fold increase in blood lead was associated with a 1.11- fold increase in serum creatinine at 3-year follow-up (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.17). A 10-fold increase in patella lead and tibia lead were associated with a 1.07-fold increase (95% CI, 0.99-1.16) and 1.03-fold increase (95% CI, 0.96-1.11) in serum creatinine at 3-year follow-up, respectively. As expected, with adjustment for blood lead levels, the mag? nitude of bone lead-renal function relationship diminished. Results from SEM analysis showed that patella lead was significantly associated with a higher 3-year follow-up serum creatinine concentration both directly and indirectly via blood lead, whereas only an indirect association with tibia lead was found. In conclusion, a chronic effect of low-level lead exposure on kidney function impairment among middle-aged and elderly individuals environmentally exposed to lead was observed. 610 SMOKING,TBARS, VITAMIN E AND USAGE OF VEGETABLES IN LITHUANIAN URBAN MALE COHORT DALIA LUKSIENE, LIUCIJA RITA CERNIAUSKIENE, RAMUTE VA- ICAITIENE, ZINA VARSKEVIOENE. INSTITUTE OF CARDIOLOGY. EMail: KLBIOCH@KMA.LT The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between smoking, TBARS and vitamin E level and consumption of vegetables. Subject: 586 males 35-64 yrs: 205 regular smokers, 137 previous smokers and 244 never-smokers. Results. The average frequency of total consumption of boiled and fresh vegetables (with exception of potatoes), fruits and their juice, expressed as total average score (TAS) of smokers was lower than of non-smokers - never-smokers or previous smokers (11.8?4.18 and 12.7?4.1 respectively, p&lt;0.05). Influence of smoking on TBARS and vitamin E concentrations was obtained in males 45-54 years. In relation with 82 never-smokers, in 74 smoking males of this age increase of TBARS (4.83+/- 0.98 v.s. 4.2+/- 0.93 mikromol/1) and decrease of vitamin E (22.9+/- 6.54 v.s. 25.5+/- 7.21 mikromol/1) were significant. After dividing the smokers and never-smokers aged 45-54 years into two subgroups according to TAS (below and over its cohort median =13), increase of TBARS in smokers did not depend on TAS; vitamin E concentration (its relation with cholesterol) in subgroup TAS&gt;13 was 4.62+/-1.20 mikromol/1 in never-smokers and 4.08+/- 0.91 in smokers (p&lt;0.05); in subgroup TAS&lt;13 it was 4.17+/- 1.36 mikromol/1 in never-smokers and 3.87+/- 1.29 mikromol/1 in smokers (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion. Smoking increased TBARS and decreased vitamin E in males 45-54 years; in smokers as well as in never-smokers vitamin E concentration was lower in subgroups with lower consumption of vegetables.</page><page sequence="134">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S135 614 THE MOST IMPORTANT INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS FOR CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASE IN CHILDREN: ANALYSIS OF CA. 6,000 QUESTIONNAIRES B KATSNELSON, KOSHELEVA A, MALYKH O, PRIVALOVA L, KUZMIN S, GURVICH V, FOURMAN VLADISLAV, LEBEDEVA NA- TALIA, ZEMLYANAYA G, RAKITIN PAVEL, PARISE H.

The total of 6,230 Qs were distributed and 6,088 Qs (98%) filled in by parents of elementary schoolchildren were returned. The following health outcomes (as reported in the Q) were chosen for analysis: cough in the morning, cough at other times of the day, wet cough other than with colds, cough of any kind, wheezing other than with colds, bronchitis diagnosed in the last 12 months, asthma diagnosed in the last 12 months, either bron? chitis or asthma diagnosed in the last 12 months, asthma diagnosed any time in life, asthma attacks on the background of constant medication in the last 12 months. Explanatory variables where grouped as follows: socio-economic status, indoor risk factors, traffic, etc; previous illness and parents' symptoms; "miscellaneous" (town, time spent in the countryside, etc). Within each group a logistic regression analysis was conducted stepwise for finding vari? ables most significantly associated with each of the above health outcomes, to be included (together with age and gender as a priori variables) into the full model for each outcome. 617 ASSESSMENT OF AIR POLLUTION AND MORTALITY RATE IN 70 REGIONAL CENTERS OF RUSSIA VLADISLAV FOURMAN, ZEMLLIANAYA GALINA, KISLITCIN VIC- TOR, LEBEDEVA NATALIA, KEAN SUSAN. CPPI. EMail: ehc@eneemp.msk.ru The relationship between air pollution and population health is an issue of continuing public concern in Russia. There is growing understanding of the urgent need for environmental policy to address this problem. Furthermore, there is a long-term need in Russia to set up an information infrastructure for identification and epidemiological analysis of exposure "hot-spots" and po? tential pollution-related clusters of diseases. The purpose of this study is to develop and test methodologies for performing national level studies, using routinely collected data, to: evaluate trends of air pollutants concentrations and mortality rates; investigate associations between air pollution level and population health status; perform health risk assessments; and develop rec? ommendations for environmental management. This study uses data sets on populations in regional centers across all Russia. The air pollution data is from Russian regional centers for 1985-98. The demographic data, as well as mortality data for 1985-98, were obtained from the State Statistic Commit? tee and other government organizations. These extensive data sets allow investigation of air pollution effects in large populations, across a wide range of ambient pollution concentrations and mixes. Among the first analyses using these data will be health risk assessments, using U.S. EPA methods and dose-response data, in conjunction with the Russian air pollution data, to obtain a rapid assessment of the air-related environmental health situation in these cities. Eventually, multiple group time-trend ecological study de? signs will be applied and log-regression analysis of air pollution levels and mortality rates in specific population groups will be conducted, using these data. 616 AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION (AP), RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS AND PEAK FLOW MEASUREMENT IN GROUPS OF CHILDREN WITH AND WITHOUT BACKGROUND RESPIRATORY HIS?

EMail: Kuzmin@ocsen.mplik.ru In Spring 1999 a panel study based on diaries for respiratory, eye and skin symptoms and twice a day peak flow measurements was carried out on 217 elementary schoolchildren recruited from two schools located in two districts of the Nizhni Tagil City characterized by presumably higher and lower levels of the ambient air industrial pollution. The periods of observation were 77 days for the more polluted area and 53 days for the less polluted one; 92.7% and 96% of the children, respectively, have completed the study. For each child background health information was obtained with the help of a special questionnaire, and current health status was estimated by a chest specialist. Based on this information, each panel was subdivided into two almost equal subpanels with or without chronic broncho-obstructive syndrome, asthma included. Concurrently with the panel observation, AP was monitored daily close to the schools using Harvard impactors for PMIO and PM2.5, Yanagi- sawa badges for N02, and Ogawa badges for S02 measurements. To study the association between air pollution and symptoms' incidence we used the GEE model with AR(1) error and a logistic link controlling for age, gender, trend, fever, BOS, asthma medication intake and for ambient temperature and relative humidity as well. 618 A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVESTIGATING GAS?

A number of investigative studies and highly publicized outbreaks of water? borne disease have raised concerns about the safety of water supplies in developed nations, and suggested that waterborne pathogens may be respon? sible for a significant fraction of endemic gastroenteritis. We undertook an epidemiological study to determine the contribution of drinking water to gastroenteritis in a major city with minimal water treatment. Methods. This was a double blind randomized controlled trial carried out in Mel? bourne, Australia. This city of 3.3 million draws its drinking water from a protected forest catchment, and the water is chlorinated but not filtered before distribution to consumers. Six hundred families were randomly allo- cated to receive either real or sham water treatment units (WTUs) installed in their kitchen. Real units were designed to remove viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Study participants completed a weekly Health Diary reporting gastrointestinal symptoms during the 68-week observation period. Results. There were 2,669 cases of highly credible gastroenteritis (HCG) during the study (0.80 cases /person/year). The ratio of HCG episode rates for the real WTU group compared the sham WTU group was 0.99 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.15, p=0.850). Seven hundred and ninety-five fecal specimens were collected from participants with gastroenteritis, and pathogens were not more signif? icantly common in the sham WTU group. Conclusions. We found no evidence of waterborne disease in a city with an unfiltered supply drawn from a protected catchment.</page><page sequence="135">S136 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 619 OCCUPATIONAL DETERMINANTS OF BONE AND BLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN MIDDLE-AGED AND ELDERLY MEN FROM THE GEN? ERAL COMMUNITY: THE NORMATIVE AGING STUDY (NAS) SAHAR ELMARSAFAWY, TSAIH S, DICKEY J, SPARROW D, ARO A, HU H. Occupational Health Program, Department of. EMail: smarsafa@hsph.harvard.edu Adult bone lead levels, which can now be measured in vivo using K-x-ray fluorescence instruments, have been found to be representative of cumulative lead exposure and predictive of manifestations of chronic toxicity such as hypertension and adverse reproductive outcomes. A number of studies have identified risk factors for elevated blood lead levels in the general population, but few have investigated risk factors for elevated bone lead levels. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential relationship between broad occupational categories and bone and blood lead levels in community-exposed men participating in the Normative Aging Study, a cohort study of aging that began in 1962. Blood lead levels were measured by graphite furnace AAS and tibia (cortical) and patella (trabecular) bone lead levels were measured by a K-x-ray fluorescence instrument. Participants were divided into three categories, including those who had reported during the duration of the study to have always worked in a blue collar occupation (BC; 41%); always worked in a white collar occupation (WC; 37%); and have worked in both blue and white collar occupations (BWC; 22%). No participant reported working in a major lead industry (e.g. smelting, battery manufacturing). The geometric mean + SD of blood lead was 6.6+4-1 ug/dl in BC subjects, 5.7+3.7 ug/dl in WC subjects and 5.5+3.5 ug/dl in BWC subjects (p&lt;0.01 in ANOVA). Mean tibia lead levels were 25.8+16.1 ug/g bone mineral in BC subjects, 18.3+9.7 ug/g in WC subjects and 19.8+11.0 ug/g in BWC subjects (p&lt;0.001). Mean patella lead levels were 36.8+22.9 ug/g in BC subjects, 27.0+15.5 ug/g in WC subjects and 27.8+14-8 ug/g in BWC subjects (p&lt;0.001). The differences in blood and bone lead levels between the three groups disappeared in the younger age group (&lt;47 years of age), among African-Americans, and among current smokers. In a final regression model that controlled for age, education, smoking and alcohol, the BC subjects continued to have higher tibia and patella lead levels in comparison to the WC and BWC subjects. At different tibia and patella lead levels, blood lead level did not show any difference between the three groups. We conclude that both blood and bone lead levels are higher in BC workers versus WC and BW even if their jobs are not directly related to lead exposure. These differences are absent in younger age with shorter duration of lifetime exposure, in smokers and in African-Americans. Blood lead level is a poor indication of cumulative body lead exposure in a non-occupationally exposed population. 621 BEHAVIOURAL OBSERVATIONS IN MICE DURING CHRONIC EX? POSURE TO A MIXTURE OF ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES IAMES GOMES, LLOYD OL, REVITT DM. Centre for Agricultural Med? icine, University of. EMail: James.Gomes@usask.ca Some of the organophosphorus pesticides are neurotoxic and inhibit acetylcho- linesterase (ACh) activity. Our previous studies have shown that chronic exposure to acetylcholinesterase-activity-inhibiting organophosphorus pesti? cides also inhibits erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity in farm workers. We have also shown previously rhat chronic exposure to a mixture of organophosphorus pesticides adversely affected liver function in laboratory mice. In this study behavioural modifications from chronic exposure to a mixture of organophosphorus pesticides were explored in mice as a measure of neurological and neuromuscular dysfunction. Male and female mice (TO strain) were ex? posed to a mixture of acetylcholinesterase-activity-inhibiting organophosphorus pesticides at low dose (3% of LD50 dose) or high dose (10% of LD50 dose) for a period of seven weeks. The pesticide doses were given once a week in com oil by gavage. Rota-rod and the (total and ambulatory) activity meter measure? ments were used as a measure of neuro-muscular co-ordination and function. Erythrocyte and brain acetylcholinesterase activities were measured at the end of the exposure period. Control group was given only corn oil by gavage. Both AChE and brain acetylcholineseterase activity were significantly lower (p&lt;0.001) in borh the low and high dose exposed groups compared with the control group. The rota-rod readings at week three were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher for low and high dose exposed groups compared with the control group and were significantly (p&lt;0.0001) higher for low dose exposed group and significantly (p&lt;0.0001) lower for dHe high dose exposed group. Low dose exposure to organophosphorus pesticides produced decreased ambulatory and total activities during the first three or four weeks of exposure, followed by an increase in the activity until the end of the observations at week seven. A gradual decrease in activity was observed for the ambulatory and total activities during the seven weeks of high-dose exposure to organophosphorus pesticides. The ambulatory and the total activities at week seven were significantly lower in rhe high dose exposure group compared to similar activities in the low dose exposure group. Chronic exposure to a mixture of organophosphorus pesticides decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain and erythrocytes. Rota-rod, total and ambulatory activities at high dose exposure showed a gradual decrease during the seven weeks of exposure, however, at low dose exposure there was an overall increase in these activities at the end of exposure period. 620 MAGNETIC FIELDS, MELATONIN, AND AMYLOID BETA PRO? TEIN IN ELECTRIC UTILITY WORKERS CURTIS NOONAN, REIF J, BURCH J, MAGNUSSON K. Colorado State University. EMail: cnoonan@cdc.gov Objective: Recent studies suggest an association between Alzheimer's disease and occupational exposure to magnetic fields. Further, occupational magnetic field exposure may perturb production of the pineal hormone melatonin, and in vitro studies have shown melatonin to affect the release of amyloid beta (Abeta), a protein associated with the hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between occupational magnetic field expo? sure, melatonin, and concentrations of blood-borne soluble Abeta. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from male electric utility workers (n = 60) to quantify two lengths ofthe protein, Abeta(l-40) and Abeta(l- 42), with the latter being the form more likely to undergo a conformational change to an insoluble form and seed the subsequent deposit of amyloid. Urine samples were collected to evaluate concentrations of the urinary melatonin metabolite, 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate. Magnetic field exposure was assessed using personal data logging devices. Participants completed a questionnaire which included demographic data and items relevant to work activities and risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Results: Subjects who had engaged in physical work on the day of blood draw had lower levels of Abeta. A summary measure ofthe intermittance of magnetic field exposure (the rate of change metric, or RCM) was inversely associated with Abeta(l-42) and the ratio Abeta( 1-42)/Abeta( 1-40). Individuals in the high? est tertile of RCM exposure had lower plasma Abeta than individuals in the lowest tertile of RCM exposure (p = 0.05 and p = 0.01 for Abeta(l-42) and the Abeta ratio, respectively. None of the measures of magnetic field intensity were associated with the Abeta parameters. As predicted, there was an inverse association between between Abeta and post-workshift concentrations of 6-hy? droxymelatonin sulfate. Discussion: The association between RCM and Abeta was difficult to interpret. Variability in magnetic field exposure may be required to elicit biological effects. Alternatively, RCM may be a surrogate for physical activity, explaining some of the variation in Abeta not fully described by the physical work variable. Previous studies indicate that exercise and physical activity may be pro? tective for Alzheimer's disease. The inverse association between physical work and Abeta concentrations suggests that activity may beneftcially affect Abeta processing or clearance. Our findings offer limited support for an inverse relationship between melatonin concentrations and levels of soluble Abeta in blood. Additional research that incorporates serial measurements are needed to see whether Abeta follows seasonal or circadian patterns similar to melatonin. 623 SEROPREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS FOR CRYPTOSPO? RIDIUM PARVUM IN THE FARMING ENVIRONMENT RACHEL CHALMERS, ELWIN K, SALMON R, GUY E, KENCH S, COLEMAN T, MEADOWS D, MORGAN-CAPNER P, SOFTLEY P, SILLIS M. Public Health Laboratory Service. EMail: rachel.chalmers@phls.wales.nhs.uk The parasitic protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum causes diarrhoeal illness in young farmed animals and humans of all ages. Human cases occur both sporadically and as outbreaks. Transmission is by the faecal-oral route either directly or indirectly from both human and animal sources. Waterborne outbreaks have the potential to affect large numbers of consumers and while the illness is self-limiting in immunocompetent patients, death may occur in those with deficient T cell counts. Detection of the parasite is particularly difficult where low numbers may be present, such as asymptomatic hosts and environmental samples, but important since the infectious dose is low. In order to elucidate risk factors for exposure to C. parvum and better understand the epidemiology, serological tests (distin- guishing between past and recent infection) combined with detailed exposure data are useful. One approach is to investigate seroprevalence and risk factors in a sentinel cohort of occupationally exposed individuals. A cohort of 606 farm workers and their families on 345 farms was recruited in three diverse areas of England (Hereford, Preston and Norwich) to investigate prevalence and risk factors for various zoonoses1 2. The cohort was validated as being representative of people involved in agriculture in each area. Since 1991, seven rounds of blood sampling for serology and questionnaires have been undertaken. Exposure data collected during structured face-to-face interviews included person and farm details, agricultural and other exposures and the range and extent of animal contact. During 1998 specific questions concerning recent gastro-intestinal symptoms and known risk factors for cryptosporidiosis (such as type of drinking water supply) were also asked. Seroprevalence of C parvum was measured by Western blot3 to detect anti? bodies to two sporozoite surface antigens with molecular masses of 15/17kDa and 27kDa. Statistical associations between exposure and outcome were measured by calculating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical variables. The extent of animal contact, amount of unboiled water drunk (ranked on an ordinal scale) and the number of animals contacted were compared in positive and negative subjects by the Mann Whitney 2-sample test. The investigation of seroprevalence and risk factors for exposure to C parvum in this well-characterised, sentinel group in different regions of England is current work in progress and results of the investigation will be presented at the conference.</page><page sequence="136">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S13 7 624 SELF-REPORTED MCS-LIKE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH INDOOR USE OF PESTICIDES - A POPULATION BASED STUDY RAINER FRENTZEL-BEYME, TERSCHUEREN CLAUDIA, HOSTRUP OLAF, HOFFMANN WOLFGANG. university bremen. EMail: beyme@uni-bremen.de Background: Etiology and pathogenesis of MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitiv? ity) are presently uncertain and a matter of intense debate. Patients with MCS report environmental chemicals as triggers if not causes of the syndrome. Several classes of pesticides are among the possible candidates. Organochlorines as well as pyrethroids have become almost ubiquitous indoor contaminants in many countries. However, while pyrethroids are clearly neurotoxic in cases of acute poisoning, their long-term, low-dose action is less understood. The majority of the few empirical studies conducted to date are based on selected samples and/or comparatively high exposure constellations. Materials and methods: Indoor application of pesticides was assessed in detail by means of standardized computer-assisted personal interviews within the context of a population-based case-control study on environmental risk factors for leukemias and malignant lymphoma. In one part of the interview all participants were asked to report subjective frequency, intensity, and duration of 116 neurologic, vegetative and irritative symptoms. At the same time, dust samples from the participants' homes were analysed for an array of pesticide compounds and typical synergists. In extrapolatory analyses reporting of symptoms was strongly associated with tumour case status. We therefore restricted this analysis to controls (N=349). For the present analysis "Cases" and "Controls" were defined using a score for "MCS-like symptoms". The score was defined a priori based on descriptive data from the international literature on symptom prevalence in MCS-patients. By use of this stringent score the study sample was dichotomized into 152 cases and 197 controls. Exposure status was derived from information provided in the interview as well as based on dust sample chemical analyses. Results: Odds ratios for various measures of personal contact with pesticides were increased. For "ever vs. never used biocides myself' OR was 2.4 (95%CI 1.5 - 3.7), for "ever vs. never pesticides inhaled" 2.5 (1.6 - 4.0) and "ever vs. never hands sprinkled with pesticides" 1.8 (1.1 - 3.0). Risk estimates for exposure based on chemical measurements were increased, too, but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: This study for the first time provides evidence for an associa? tion between contact with indoor pesticides and MCS-like subjective symp? toms based on a random sample of the population. The a posteriori character of this analysis, the study's arbitrary "case"-definition, and limited sample size render the results extrapolatory. Methodologically, the meaning of dust sample contamination with respect to individual exposure remains unclear. From a public health point of view, however, these first results indicate increased caution against extensive and uncritical use of indoor pesticides. 627 ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND MORTALITY AMONG CHIL? DREN IN LITHUANIA REGINA REKLAITIENE. Institute of Cardiology, Kaunas University of Medicine. EMail: atamos@kma.lt Background. The review of the environmental factors, presented in the WHO documents (1999), emphasizes quality of food, water and air, acci? dents, and especially road accidents among children and teenagers. The London conference "Healthy Planet Forum" in 1999 approved the charter on Transport, Environment and Health, stating that the health and envi? ronment requirements must be taken into account in decision making related to transport. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the prevalence and mortality from injuries, traumas and road deaths among adults, teenagers and children in Lithuania in 1997 and in 1998. Methods. The data used in this report were taken from the Lithuanian Health Statistics data base. The prevalence and crude mortality rate was calculated per 1000 persons. Results. In 1998 the prevalence of traumas, poisoning by drugs and other conditions due to external causes taken together was significantly higher compared to that in 1997 among both adults (including teenagers) (75.6 and 73.6, respectively, p&lt; .05) and children (78.0 and 65.8, respectively, p&lt; .001). Among adults, there were no statistically significant differences in prevalence rates of injuries of head, neck and breast, shoulder and upper arm, hip and legs in 1998 compared to corresponding rates in 1997. However, an increase in prevalence rates of injuries of shoulder and upper arm, hip and legs was observed among children in 1998 compared to those in 1997 (30.9 and 25.2, p&lt; .001, and 20.3 and 17.0, p&lt; .05, respectively). Looking at the specific causes of deaths, a statistically significant increase in mortality rates of road accidents was noticed among children in 1998 compared to that in 1997 (0.07 and 0.04, respectively, p&lt; .05), while no changes were detected in three different age groups (15-44, 45-64 and more than 65) of the adult population. Conclusion. Data presented confirm, that road accidents occurred to be one of the main mortality causes among children aged 1-14 years in Lithuania. Therefore reduction of road deaths and injuries becomes the main goal preventive programmes in kindergartens and schools. 626 GENDER DIFFERENCES IN OCCUPATIONAL RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS AMONG FARMERS MONA KIMBELL-DUNN, BATES M, CRANE J. University of Otago, Wellington, New Zealand. EMail: mona@wnmeds.ac.nz A postal survey of respiratory health in current New Zealand farmers was conducted in 1997. There were 409 female and 1397 male respondents, aged 18 to 64, with response rates of 75% and 76%, respectively. Prevalence rates for respiratory disease symptoms varied greatly between job titles. Female sharemilkers and farm employees reported more asthma, shortness of breath, and combined respiratory symptoms than males in the same job categories (ORs 2.4 to 5.1). Compared to male farmers, female farmers reported a higher prevalence of asthma (OR= 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.5), shortness of breath (1.7, 0.5-1.03), and allergic diseases (1.3 for hayfever and 1.9 for skin allergies). Although women in this age group in the general New Zealand population tend to report a higher prevalence of asthma than men, the difference in asthma symptom prevalence between male and female farmers is even greater. Females from the New Zealand population reported an asthma symptom prevalence 1.4 times greater than males, whereas female farmers reported an asthma symptom prevalence 2.8 times greater than male farmers. Possible explanations for the noted increase in female farmer's asthma include 1.) Greater susceptibility to farm agents, 2.) Differing exposures in job tasks for males and females, and 3.) The possibility of a job transfer bias between men and women (in farming situations women may have less freedom than men to leave a job that affects their health). 628 DETREMINANTS OF BONE AND BLOOD LEAD LEVELS IN THE EARLY POSTPARTUM PERIOD MARY 1EAN BROWN, HU H, GONZALES-COSSIO T, PETERSON K, SANIN L, KAGEYAMA M, PALAZUELOS E, ARO A, SCHNAAS L, HERNANDEZ-AVILA M. Massachusetts State Laboratory Institue. EMail: maryjean.brown@state.ma.us Objective: This study investigated determinants of bone and blood lead levels in 430 lactating Mexican women during the early postpartum period and the contribution of bone lead to blood lead levels. Methods: Maternal venous blood lead levels were measured at delivery and postpartum and bone lead levels, measured using in vivo k-xray fluorescence, were measured postpartum. Data regarding environmental exposure, demo? graphic characteristics and maternal factors related to lead exposure were collected by questionnaire. Linear regression was used to examine the relationships between bone and blood lead levels, demographics and envi? ronmental exposure variables. Results: Mean (SD) blood, tibia and patella lead (Pb) levels were 9.5 (4.5) mg/dL, 10.2 (10.1) /xg Pb/g bone mineral and 15.2 (15.1) u.g Pb/g bone mineral respectively. These values are considerably higher than values for women in the United States. Older age, the cumulative use of lead glazed pottery and higher proportion of life spent in Mexico City were powerful predictors of higher bone lead levels. Use of lead glazed ceramics to cook food in the past week and elevated patella lead levels were significant predictors of elevated blood lead levels. Patella lead levels explained one third of the variance accounted for by the final blood lead model. Women in the 90th percentile for patella lead had an untransformed predicted mean blood lead level 3.6 mg/dL higher than those in the 10th percentile. Conclusions: This study identified use of lead glazed ceramics as a major source of cumulative lead exposure, as reflected by bone lead levels, as well as current exposure, reflected by blood lead levels, in Mexico City. A higher proportion of life spent in Mexico City, a proxy for exposure to leaded gasoline emissions, was identified as the other major source of cumulative lead exposure. The influence of bone lead on blood lead coupled with the long half-life of lead in bone has implications for other populations and suggests that bone stores may pose a threat to women of reproductive age long after exposure has declined.</page><page sequence="137">S138 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 629 PERCEPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN URBAN POP?

EMail: gregurkovi@iol.cz Introduction: As a part of the National Monitoring Programme of Environ? ment and Health, we examined people's perception of environmental pol? lution and risks in the Czech Republic. Methods: A random sample of men and women aged 45-54 resident in 6 cities were asked to complete a questionnaire; 2838 subjects agreed to participate (response rate 63%). Perception of different environmental issues was measured by a battery of questions, each at 6-point scale, ranging from "entirely unsatisfied" to "entirely satisfied". Results: The proportion of people unsatisfied with the quality of environ? ment in their city ranged from 14-5% to 23.4%, and correlated strongly with air pollution measurements (p &lt; 0.001). In all cities, people were most concerned with car traffic (31.9%), dirty public areas (29.9%) and air pollution (24.6%). Inhabitants of less polluted cities complained more often about noise. At individual level, women were significantly more critical about the cleanliness of public areas than men; more educated subjects were more concerned about the cleanliness of public areas and less about car traffic and noise; and dissatisfaction with the quality of the local environ? ment was strongly associated with poor social conditions (OR 4.7; 95%CI 3.1-7.3), dissatisfaction with own life (OR 2.9; 95%CI 1.9-4.4), and eco? nomic inactivity (OR 1.7; 95%CI 1.2-2.4). Conclusion: Perception of environment in urban population is related to objective indicators of environmental quality, but is also strongly associated with individuals social and psychosocial factors. 631 NATIONAL SYSTEM OF MONITORING OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC RUZENA KUBINOVA, H.KAZMAROVA, F.KOZISEK, P.SISMA, M.CERNA, J.RUPRICH, M.GREGURKOVA, M.TICHY. National Insti? tute of Public Health, Praha, Czech. EMail: gregurkovi@iol.cz Introduction: The Czech National System of Monitoring of Environment and Health (the Monitoring System) was established in 1994, and is cur? rently running in 30 selected cities. The aim of the Monitoring System is to provide data to inform national and local environmental policy. The Mon? itoring System consists of 6 subsystems: (1) air pollution; (2) drinking water; (3) noise; (4) dietary exposure to chemicals; (5) exposure to toxic pollutants from the environment (biological monitoring); and (6) health status. Methods: The monitoring programme uses routine information but relies increasingly on newly collected data on both environmental indicators and health status. Results: The results so far include: (1) persisting higher levels of air pollution in some areas; (2) frequent supplier's failures to observe the recommended level of chlorination of drinking water (both underchlorination and partic? ularly overchlorination); (3) high incidence of food born alimentary dis? eases; (4) repeated findings of high exposure to nitrites and nitrates from foodstuffs and drinking water ingestion; (5) low level of dietary exposure to chemicals; (6) good quality of drinking water in public water supply; (7) concentrations of contaminants in organs and tissues was similar to western European countries; (8) health status differs between monitored cities, and health indicators seem related to both area-based environmental indicators and individual's socio-economic characteristics. Conclusions: The National Monitoring System proved to be a valuable source of data on environment and health, and a powerful and flexible tool to assess the link between environmental exposures and health, both at individual and geographical level. 630 RISK FACTORS OF COMBINED HEAVY ALLERGIC DISEASES VERA FAIERAIZLOVA, E.SVANDOVA, R.KUBINOVA. National Insti? tute of Public Health. EMail: gregurkovi@iol.cz Objective: To investigate whether prenatal and early childhood factors are related to allergic diseases in later childhood. Methods: A population based case-control study for which subjects were selected from a cross-sectional survey of 9947 children. Cases were 152 children aged 5-13 with allergy (asthma pollinare, dermorespiratorious syn? drome etc); for each case, 3 controls (children without allergy) of the same age were sampled from the survey. Data on children were obtained from the pediatricians' records, and through a questionnaire completed by parents. Data were analysed by logistic regression. Results: In addition to well known factors such as family history and high respiratory morbidity in early childhood, a range of other factors were associated with increased risk of allergy: maternal age 35 or more at delivery (OR 3.8; 95%CI 1.6-9.5), health problems during the pregnancy, especially during the first trimester (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.1-2.9), mother's stress during pregnancy (OR 1.6; 95%CI 1.0-2.6), mother's allergy during pregnancy (OR 3.7; 95%CI 2.1-6.4), complications during the delivery (OR 2.1; 95%CI 1.1-4.3), child being resuscitated (OR 2.5; 95%CI 1.2-5.2), medical treatment ofthe child after birth (OR 1.7; 95%CI 1.0-2.6), treatment by antibiotics (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.2-2.4), an allergic reaction before the second year of the child age (OR 4-0; 95%CI 2.4-6.9), having a source of envi? ronmental pollution near home (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.0-2.2), and main road home (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.0-2.2). Conclusion: Although reporting bias cannot be excluded, this study suggest that a range of pre- and perinatal and early childhood factors may be associated with the risk of allergy. 633 THE IMPACT OF COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS ON RESPIRA? TORY SYPMTOMS ALP AKER, KARAVU? MELDA, CEBECI DILSAD, BAKIRCI NADI. Marmara University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of. EMail: savecebeci@superonline.com Objective:This study was carried out for assessing the impact on respiratory functions of stack emmisions of a coal-fired thermal power plant station. Methods: The study was conducted on 320 subjects living in two villages close to coal-fired plant area. Other two villages with a sample of 321 subjects were selected from uneffected area for matching purposes. Data was collected in June-July 1998 through applying questionnaires about respira? tory symptoms and annoyance, addditionally by measuring their pulmonary functions using a portable spirometer.Spirometric measurements were car? ried out at successive consecutive measurements.The highest measurement values were used in analyses. Prevalences of symptoms and diseases were compared by chi-square tests.The values of respiratory functioning were sex-specific and age-standardized but other factors such as smoking, educa? tion and living time in the area were controlled in general factorial analysis of variance. Results: There were no significant difference between two areas interms of respiratory symptoms such as coughing with or without phlegm, hawking- .dyspnea. Respiratory annoyance was found slightly higher in effected area and statistically signifcant difference was detected in pulmonary func? tions.Forced expiratory volume in first second (FEVl) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were found lower in effected area. Conclusion: These findings indicate the negative impact of pollution arise from coal-fired power station. The preventive measures needs to be taken for prevention of possible chronical airways disease later in life.</page><page sequence="138">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S139 634 CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENT ASTHMA IN TWO CANA? DIAN COMMUNITIES WITH DIFFERENT AIR POLLUTION HIS? TORIES MARK RAIZENNE, EDWARDS B. Health Canada. EMail: Mark?Raizenne@hc-sc.gc.ca The increasing prevalence of asthma in children and the influence of acute and chronic exposure to air pollution on the development and exacerbation of asthma and asthmatic symptoms remains an area of concern in public health. We examined the effects of genetic predisposition and environmental factors on asthmatic symptoms in 2,800 children and adolescents. Saint John (SJ), New Brunswick, is a community of &gt; 120,000, with local sources of air pollution from a generating station, a refinerie, a pulp mill and experiences transient episodes of long range transport from the eastern coast of the US. Penticton (Pct), British Columbia, is a community of ~50,000 with minimal small local sources and occasional episodes of pollution from wood burning or forest fires. In 1996- 1997,1310 grade 5 parents in SJ completed a self-administered questionnaire on their child's health and residence history. In both Saint John and in Penticton- (Pct), British Columbia, 1511 grade 12 students completed self-administered questionnaires on health, smoking, activity levels and residential histories. For the grade 5 cohort, the prevalence of current asthma was 14.9% and 9.9% for males and females respectively. The strongest predictors of current asthma were childhood history of allergies (OR=6.3, 95%CI=4.2 to 9.3), parental asthma (either parent) (OR=3.1, 95%CI=2.0 to 4.9) and female gender (OR=0.5,95%O=0.3 to 0.7). Exposures at home to tobacco smoke was not significant. Exposure to mould in the home was found to be a significant predictor for persistent wheeze (OR= 1.7,95%Q=1.1 to 2.5). For the grade 12 cohort, current asthma in females was more prevalent than for males in both SJ and Pct (SJ females: 16.6%, Pct females 14.8%, SJ males: 10.8%, Pct males: 8.4%). Only a history of allergies was observed to predict current asthma (OR=4-8,95%CI=3.8 to 7.5) adjusting for gender, current smoking, household mold and residency in SJ. In contrast, persistent wheeze in adolescents was significantly predicted by history of allergies (OR=2.9, 95%CI=2.1 to 4.0), current smoking (OR=2.5, 95%CI=1.8 to 3.4), household mould (OR=1.6, 95%CI=1.2 to 2.2), residency in SJ (OR=1.9, 95%CI=1.2 to 2.9) and female gender (OR=1.8, 95%CI=1.3 to 2.4). These data indicate that between the ages of 10 and 17, the prevalence of reported current asthma increases in females and decreases in males. Persistent wheeze appears to be a sensitive outcome measure for exposures to environmental factors in adolescents. 636 CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA (0-19 YEARS) AND INDOOR IONIZ? ING RADIATION OLAV AXELSON, AKERBLOM GUSTAV, FREDRIKSON MATS, HARD? ELL LENNART. Linkoping University. EMail: olav.axelson@ymk.liu.se Objectives. The etiology of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is poorly under- stood but determinants agreed on are ionizing radiation and rare genetic disor? ders. Here we report an investigation on ALL in relation to the increased background radiation in Swedish homes built of uranium containing alum shale lightweight concrete. Approximately 800.000 Swedes (8.5 % of the population) live in some 300,000 such dwellings with increased indoor gamma radiation to about 0.30 microsievert per hour (microSv/h) as an average and rarely lower than 0.20 microSv/h versus about 0.10 microSv/h in other houses. Sometimes the levels can be as high as 0.50 microSv/h and even 1.20 microSv/h. Methods. The first concerns about adverse health effects from indoor radon around 1980 were limited to the constructions of alum shale concrete, and the Swedish Radon Commission therefore initiated measurements by cars equipped with sensitive scintillometers driving along streets and roads and measuring the gamma radiation from the facades. Information in this respect was obtained about the homes in 154 out of the 286 Swedish municipalities. Every case of ALL in the country aged less than 20 years was identified for the period 1980-89, altogether 618 subjects. They were matched on age, gender and county with eight controls, 4 944 in total, from the population registry. However, only 312 and 1418 of them, respectively, were included in the study as belonging to properly measured municipalities. Results. Having lived for some time in an alum shale concrete house, i.e., exposure to &gt; 0.10 microSv/h, resulted in an OR of 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.0 - 1.9) with a corresponding etiologic fraction for the population of 6.8%. A subdivision of the exposed subjects into cumulated or time-weighted exposure categories revealed no clear-cut dose-response relationships, however. Conclusion. This study seems to corroborate the findings in earlier studies from Sweden and Italy that have indicated a possible effect from indoor gamma radiation with regard to leukemia. The lack of a dose-response relationship weakens the conclusiveness of the study, but may simply be due to less proper assessment of exposure, or depend on the particular problem of dealing with the strongly age dependent amount of exposure obtained in young ages. 635 ESOPHAGEAL AND GASTRIC CARDIA ADENOCARCINOMA IN SASKATCHEWAN MALES, 1969-1998. PAMELA SMITH, OSEI WILLIAM, GOMES JAMES, MALOWANY KONNIE. Saskatchewan Cancer Agency. EMail: psmith@scf.sk.ca BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer is thought to be a disease whose control will come from primary prevention based on the findings of epide? miologic studies. There are large differences in the incidence of esophageal cancer over geographic areas and over time. This suggests environmental factors are important in the etiology of esophageal cancer. Adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia is believed to be the same disease as esophageal adenocarcinoma and distinct from other stomach cancers. In Saskatchewan, as elsewhere in developed nations, the incidence of esophageal and cardia adenocarcinoma appears to be increasing. PURPOSE: To examine the hypothesis that incidence rates might be in? creasing and might differ by residence type, this ecological study sought associations between incidence of esophageal and cardia adenocarcinoma and city versus rural residence type from 1969 to 1998. METHODS: Data on all cases of malignant, primary esophageal and cardia cancer (n=1402), as well as non-cardia stomach cancer (n=2915), diag? nosed between January 1, 1969 and December 31, 1998 were extracted from the population-based Cancer Registry of the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency. There were 234 (198 male, 36 female) cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma and 409 (329 male and 80 female) cases of adenocarcinoma of the cardia. Among males, there were 527 cases of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or cardia: 261 (49.5%) city and 266 (50.5%) rural. Variables extracted were: date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, morphology and residence code at diagnosis. Denominator data came from Saskatchewan Health's annual Covered Population Report. Age-specific incidence rates were calculated for esophageal and cardia cancer for adenocarcinoma and for all other histolo? gies combined. Age-specific incidence was calculated by residence type. RESULTS: Over the 30-year study period, age-specific incidence rates for males did not change for non-adenocarcinoma cancer of the esophagus and cardia but declined for stomach. The rates declined for adenocarcinoma of the non-cardia stomach but increased for both cardia and esophagus. The rate of increase in incidence is greatest in the 40-49 year age-group. Changes in classification over time are unlikely to account for the entire increase, especially that observed recently among 40-49 year-old males. Age-specific incidence was higher in cities compared to rural areas. CONCLUSION: Incidence rates for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and cardia are increasing among males in Saskatchewan, especially among younger men. Higher incidence is associated with residence in cities at time of diagnosis. This descriptive analysis strongly supports the need for further analytic investigations into environmental factors important in causation. 639 EPIDEMIOLOGIC "WHISTLEBLOWERS": NEXT STEPS ELIHU RICHTER, TAMAR BERMAN*. Hebrew University Medical School Jerusalem. EMail: elir@cc.huji.ac.il The mission of environmental and occupational epidemiology is to measure and report health risks from exposures to toxic and physical agents, so that preventive measures can be taken. Whistleblowers are persons who are subjected legal harassment, ostracism, job loss, loss of funding, intimidation, abuse, threats, or even force after reporting accurate, valid or peer-review- able information on such risks, or are prevented from reporting such infor? mation. The high-risk groups for such harassment are younger or less well- known epidemiologists, employees in government or industry, or members of the exposed population itself in settings where protection of human rights is weak. But information on the distribution of such harassment is not readily available. The following steps are suggested to protect whistleblowers: (1) ISEE can network with other organizations with similar concerns (2) Provide libel insurance for investigators at risk for legal harassment in the form of libel suits (3) Promote development ofa code of practice not only for professional societies, but also for employers (universities, government agencies, indus? trial organizations) to protect persons unfairly treated.(4)Publicize episodes of harassment of whistleblowers.</page><page sequence="139">S140 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 640 ROAD DEATHS: A PUBLIC HEALTH FAILURE, NOT AN ACHIEVEMENT ELIHU RICHTER, BERMAN T, BARACH P, BEN-MICHAEL E, RICH? TER E. Hebrew University Medical School Jerusalem. EMail: elir@cc.huji.ac.il A recent CDC document claims that federal countermeasures were respon? sible for the 90% decrease in risk of death from road crashes in the U.S. between 1925 and 1997. Data tracking the decline in death rates per vmt show that most of the drop preceded these countermeasures. Data suggest that much of the reduction in death rates in the USA and world-wide has resulted more from unplanned reductions in travel speeds than from public health policy or countermeasures. The use of risk (deaths/ vehicle mile traveled) as opposed to absolute number of deaths conceals this effect. The CDC document ignores increases in death tolls in the US following increased speed limits. Use of the case fatality rate, which is independent of exposure, tracks the full impacts of raised speed limits and travel speeds. These impacts are substan? tially understated by before-after comparisons in death tolls in absolute numbers. Correction for increases in exposure fails to take into account the fact that death risks per vehile miles travelled (vmt) fall with increases in vmt. New data from Israel that before-after comparisons understate the full impact of raised travel speeds on road deaths over a several year period by almost half. Ironically, much of the "success" in the USA in reducing vmt is attributable to the failures of the system to provide rapid transit during what are called "rush hours". The US has failed to implement policies and programs based on modal shifts to rail and speed camera networks. Such networks immedi- ately produce large reductions not only in the death rate and in the absolute number of persons killed. This situation is not an achievement in public health, but a failure. 643 ROAD DEATHS IN COLOMBIA ELIHU RICHTER, POSADA J, BEN-MICHAEL E, HERMAN A, KA- HAN E, RICHTER ED. Hebrew University-Hadassah Jerusalem. EMail: elir@cc.huji.ac.il Background and Objectives: Road deaths are becoming the ranking cause of death in the young in many countries. We report data on the distribution and determinants of road deaths and injuries for all victims, with the aim of defining targets and priorities for highway death prevention in Colombia and other rapidly urbanizing countries. Methods: We analyzed data on deaths and injuries from 1993 to 1995 for the nation as a whole and for the country's two largest cities, Bogota and Medellin. Data Sources were: Colombia's Fund for the Prevention of Road Injury and the national death registry. Results: Deaths and injuries are rising in the nation as a whole. Of the deaths, 75% occur in urban areas, and 80% are males. Pedestrians aged 15-34 are a peak subgroup. Thirty-four percent of deaths are attributable to speeding and/or alcohol consumption. Death tolls are highest at night and on weekends. Conclusions: Specific priority targets for intervention are indicated by the fact that 75% of road deaths in Colombia occur in urban areas and that 80% of all victims are males. 642 TRANS-BORDER EPIDEMIOLOGY: LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHIL?

EMail: elir@cc.huji.ac.il Background and Objectives: Past work identified flour from stone mills, kohl, ceramics, and occupational exposures as hot spots for focal lead exposure and leaded gasoline as the major source of population-wide back? ground exposure. The USCDC Lead Project aimed to trace hot spots and to assess impact of progressive reduction of leaded gasoline on blood lead levels in children aged 2-6. Methods: Questionnaires and portable kit for field testing of blood leads (PbB) and ZPP of urban children, (n=approx 300 in each area), case investigations and environmental tests for sources. Findings: Mean PbB's in Israel, West Bank and Gaza are now well under 10 dl-1. But hot spots were found in children in Gaza and Hebron living in proximity to small smelters. Conclusions: Population-wide exposure levels fell from re? duction in use of leaded gasoline and almost total disappearance of flour from stone mills, but hot spots persist. The project is now moving on to studies of iron deficiency, a more widespread problem. 646 ACUTE EFFECTS OF FUNGAL EXPOSURES IN RICE-FIELD AND OFFICE WORKERS IN TAIWAN: III. A SHORT-TERM LONGITU? DINAL LUNG FUNCTION STUDY CHIH-HUNG KU, RYAN L, BURGE H, LIOU S, YANG C, CHRIS- TIANI D. School of Public Health, NDMC EMail: cku@ndmctsgh.edu.tw Objectives: We conducted a study to evaluate between-group differences and within-group changes in lung function of rice-field and office workers over a 14-day study period; to assess the association between lung function and serum immunoglobulins levels over the exposure period; and to assess the relationship between airborne fungal concentrations and changes in lung function. Methods: Personal cassette samplers were used to collect air borne particles at the work sites. Fungi were washed from the cassettes and cultured on DG-18 agar. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEVl) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured by Micro Spiro Plus Spriometrics; daily PEF was measured by Mini Wright Peak Flow Meter. Serum-total IgE, IgG and subclasses were measured by immunoassay (Behring Nephelometers). Skin tests were performed using a multitest with 11 allergens (Bayer, Elkhart, IN, USA). Statistical analysis included generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to assess the relationships of interest, with appropriate adjustment for repeated measurements. Results: FEVl was positively correlated with PEF, with adjustment for repeated measurements. FEVl varied by work site and by day, with daily patterns of variation differing between work sites. Compared to skin-test- negative workers, workers who reacted to one or more fungal allergens had significantly lower FEVl, and FEVl was slightly lower in workers who reacted positively to allergens other than fungi. The pattern of change in FVC between rice-field and office groups was the same over the study period. However, after controlling for confounders, office workers had consistently lower FVC than rice-field workers. Compared with each group's baseline, FVC decreased significantly on day eight and day 14 in both groups. Daily change, diumal variation, and percent change in PEF between morning and evening (a.m. and p.m.) were correlated with immunoglobulins levels. No exposure-response relationships between airborne fungal exposures and lung functions were found. Conclusions: Although no relationship between measured fungal concen? trations and lung function measures was found, sensitization of the workers to fungi appears to play an important role in relation to lung function. We conclude that there is a fungal exposure effect on lung function, especially evident in workers with fungal sensitization. Future studies need to focus on the incidence of sensitization to fungal allergens, fungal-related lung func? tion changes and exposure-response for airway hyperresponsiveness in ex? posed workers.</page><page sequence="140">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S141 647 ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; HEALTH SITUATION OF SHKODRA DIS?

EMail: josif@albaniaonline.net This study presents the Environmental and hygienic situation in the Shkodra District, during the important political, social, and economic changes in Alba- nia, the changes that hasn't finished yet. The main objective was the identifi? cation of the environmental problems in the Shkodra District, their hygienic situation. The study areas included drinking water quality as a priority, waste? water discharges, solid waste management, air pollution, food products control and healrh situation as well. The other specific objective was the implementa? tion of group work merhod to the District sanitary inspector's. The study should be considered as an appeal also, for assistance and co-operation to all die parties that may influence and help the process of improving the environmental situation in Albania. The study refereed the data of year 1996, but the earlier data for rhe comprehension purposes have been used. The collection of necessary information and all materials needed for the study were gathered in collaboration with Sanitary inspectors of the District through, The consultation with the database of the HED of the District, Field visits and Sanitary inspections in the drinking water distribution network from its natural source to the consumer, sewage facilities, industrial enterprises, Hospital center etc. Consulting and meetings with local authorities in a Municipality, etc. The drinking water distribution network of Shkodra city and rural areas had many damages, contributing to the lack of water, low pressure and intermittent water supply. The only treatment done is chlorinating with the manual manner with low efficiency in water disinfecting. 33.3 % of rural networks hasn't any possi? bility for disinfecting. The sanitary protection zones in many places does not respect. This entire situation might have the potential health impact to the populations. Urban untreated wastewater's of Shkodra city and hospital's one discharged into tiie Drini river and sometimes in the Shkodra lake, affecting human health, flora and fauna also. The industrial wastewater's with a open channel were discharged into the river Kir which after 2.5 km is linked with Drini river. After 1992 all enterprises and factories were closed and in 1996 their wastewater discharges was in a low level. Solid waste (about 90 ton per day) management together with the solid wastes of 6 hospitals, realized only with collecting, transport and disposal into a vicinity of river Kir, helping its pollu? tion. The air pollution, only with S02 and Soot determination, dispute with the reduction of industrial emissions, continues to increase due to the large number of old cars. The general morbidity of local population was in high level as well. The recommendations of this situation were the urgent rehabilitation in most of the water distribution networks and introduce of the automatic chlorinating of drinking water. The treatment of the effluent of wastewater was very important in the health hazard reduction. Encouragement for the use of new cars and increased of tax for old one will help in air pollution reduction and health education is crucial as well. This study was carried out in the framework of Project-ENVIRONMENT ALBANIA-between the Institute of Environmental Engineering (IGE) of the Institute of Technology in Loussane (EPFL) and PHI in Tirana, financed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). 650 DEVELOPMENT OF A RESEARCH STRATEGY FOR ASSESSING THE PRESENCE OF ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS IN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT USING SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANE DE? VICES (SPMDS) ELVA BUGLIOSI, GILLI GIORGIO. Dep. Public Health and Microbiol- ogy. EMail: ebugliosi@hotmail.com Evidence is growing that a serious health link exists between chemicals that mimic the hormone estrogen and damage to the human reproductive system. Known as Endocrine Disruptors (ED), these chemicals are widely diffused in the environment. ED can get into water supplies in various ways. Since many ED are herbicides and pesticides, agricultural runoff can carry these chemicals into water supplies. Some are products of industrialization and may contaminate through various means, such as leaking storage tanks, accidental spills or illegal dumping. With no visible characteristics, smell or taste, ED are very difficult to detect and humans and animals could be routinely exposed to many different pesticides in drinking water. In order to detect the presence of ED in the aquatic environment a innovative sampling technique based on Semipermeable Mem? brane Devices (SPMDs) was applied. This method provides a useful tool to asses the bioavailability of chemicals, such as ED, because the SPMD sequestration medium consists of triolein, a neutral lipid largely diffused in the gills of fish. Thus, SPMD can mimic the bioconcentration in fatty tissues of aquatic organ? isms. Water Samples were monitored in this way and extracts were then tested using a Proliferation assay with human estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells (E-screen test) was performed. The growth of cells is strictly dependent on the concentration of estrogen in the culture medium so that the presence of estrogenic compounds can evaluated. Measuring the proliferation rate in cells exposed to water samples the estrogenic activity could be deter? mined. The application of the E-screen assay combined with a SPMD deploy- ment could be a useful method to assess the presence of contaminants with estrogenic potency in aquatic environment. 649 DRINKING WATER NITRATE AND RISK OF BRAIN CANCER IN NEBRASKA, USA MARY H. WARD, HEINEMAN EF, CANTOR KENNETH P., CHEN H, MCCOMB RD, WEISENBURGER DD, MERKE SK. National Cancer Institute. EMail: wardm@exchange.nih.gov Nitrate is a precursor compound in the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOC), most of which are potent animal carcinogens. Dietary intakes of NOC and nitrite have been associated with brain cancer in epidemiologic studies; however, drinking water nitrate exposure has not been extensively evaluated. We conducted a population-based case-control study of adult brain cancer (glioma) in eastern Nebraska, an agricultural state with ele? vated nitrate levels in many public water supplies. Cases were men and women newly diagnosed with glioma in 1988-1993. Population controls were matched to cases by gender, race, age, and vital status. Interviewers obtained a complete residential and water source history. Nitrate levels in 136 Nebraska towns (1965-1984) were linked to the water source histories by town. To reduce misclassification by unknown nitrate levels in private wells, we computed an average nitrate level from 1965-1984 among those who used public supplies with nitrate data for 80% or more of their person- years. A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess intakes of dietary nitrate, nitrite, and vitamin C. Among controls, the median nitrate-nitrogen average was 2.6 mg/liter (interquartile range 2.4-4.6). After adjusting for age, there was a significant trend of increasing risk of glioma with increasing quartiles of average nitrate among women but not men (odd ratios [OR] women: 1.5, 1.6, 1.8; men: 1.8, 1.0, 1.2). Adjustment for other brain cancer risk factors did not change the ORs substantially. We evaluated risk by intake level of vitamin C, an inhibitor of endogenous nitrosation. Compared with those who consumed water with low nitrate (&lt;median) and had higher intake (&gt;median) of vitamin C, there was an elevated risk only among women with high water nitrate and low vitamin C intake (OR= 1.8, 95% CI 0.7-4.6). This pattern was not observed among men. Intakes of dietary nitrate and nitrite were not significantly associated with risk. Our results suggest that long-term exposure to elevated nitrate in drinking water is associated with brain cancer risk among women. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to limited epidemiologic data from other populations and the contradictory findings for men. 651 CONSUMPTION OF PCB-CONTAMINATED FISH FROM LAKE ONTARIO AND RISK OF PREGNANCY LOSS-A FOLLOW-UP STUDY 1UN YANG, BUCK G, WEINER J, VENA J, SWANSON M. SUNY AT BUFFALO. EMail: junyang@acsu.buffalo.edu Using couples from the New York State Angler Cohort Study who were considering pregnancy between 1991-93 (n=2130), the authors assessed parental consumption of PCB-contaminated sport fish from Lake Ontario and the risk of pregnancy loss (PCBs are potential reproductive toxicants). Fish consumption (years eating between 1955 and 1991, monthly frequency and amount in 1991) was ascertained in 1991 upon enrollment into the cohort. Self-reported pregnancy loss was ascertained via standardized tele? phone interviews in 1993. The sample was restricted to women who had their first pregnancies between 1991 and 1993 (n=265); 14.7% women reported losses. Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess risk of loss for parental fish consumption (duration, frequency and amount) con? trolling for parental ages and cigarette smoking, and history of endometriosis in women. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. The adjusted odds ratios for duration, frequency and amount of paternal fish consumption are: 1.41 (95% CI=0.51-3.92), 0.71 (95% CI=0.14-3.50), and 1.48 (95% CI=0.59-3.71), respectively. Odds ratios for maternal consumption are: 1.27 (95%CI=0.51-3.15), 2.16 (95%CI=0.51-9.17), and 0.98 (95% CI=0.38-2.56), respectively. There was no interaction observed for parental consumption. No significant ele? vated risk was observed in this study, which may stern from our limited sample size and missing data for selected variates. Findings await confirma- tion from prospective inquiry of sufficient size.</page><page sequence="141">S142 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 653 ASTHMA PREVALENCE AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN ISRAEL SARAH HELLMANN, GOREN A, DANON YL. Tel-Aviv University. EMail: machon@post.tau.ac.il Background: Evidence about the rise in asthma prevalence during the seventies and eighties were demonstrated in different countries, as well as in Israel. Some studies, exploring the relation between asthma and air pollu? tion, found higher asthma prevalence in urban and industrialized areas. Aims: 1. Evaluating asthma prevalence during the period 1992-1996 among the Jewish population aged 17-18 years (conscripts), by gender, and , for the immigrants from the U.S.S.R - by the number of years in Israel. 2. Comparing asthma prevalence among the adolescent population in 1992? 1996 to prior periods. 3. Evaluating the influence of geographical areas and air pollution levels on asthma prevalence. Methods: Our study is based on: 1. The Israeli army computerized file of the conscripts population for the years 1992-1996. 2. Air pollution data, derived from the Israeli monitoring stations system. The statistical analysis referred to the following variables: 1. Gender. 2. Birth year. 3. Geographical indexes (geographical area and place of residence). 4. Origin (Israeli bom, former U.S.S.R born and others). 5. Number of years in Israel (only for former U.S.S.R bom). 6. Year of first medical committee (1992-1996). 7. Asthma severity (3 degrees). Results: More than 400,000 medical files of Jewish conscripts were studied. Asthma prevalence among male conscripts was higher than among females. A significant gradual rise in asthma prevalence among male and female conscripts was observed (between 1980-1996). Asthma prevalence among former U.S.S.R born conscripts almost doubies within a decade of stay in Israel and becomes very similar to that among Israeli born conscripts. The highest prevalence of asthma was observed among conscripts from Tel-Aviv and Haifa areas, while the lowest among those from Jerusalem area. Asthma distribution by place of residence is in line with asthma distribution by geographical area. No differences could be demonstrated between more polluted and less polluted settlements in the same geographical area. This finding may be connected to some scio- economic factors that characterize residential areas in Israel, rather than to community air pollution. Only in a high polluted residential area in Tel- Aviv the prevalence of asthma was significantly higher, compared to other Tel-Aviv neighborhoods, both among females and among males. 665 AIR POLLUTION AND DAILY MORTALITY IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY ZEYNEP DORTBUDAK, NEAS LUCAS, TIMBIL SUKRAN, ERKAN- ,FEYZA. University of North Carolina, Center for Environmental. EMail: dortbudak.zeynep@epa.gov Previous studies have shown that mortality is associated with ambient air pollution in the U.S. and Europe. For the period from January 1, 1994 through January 31, 1996, we investigated an association between daily mortality in Istanbul, Turkey and ambient particulate matter (Black Smoke, BS) and sulphur dioxide (S02) using the APHEA-2 protocol. Daily mor? tality was collected from death certificates in the five burial grounds in the Istanbul metropolitan area and classified by cause (cardiovascular (ICD9: 390-459) and respiratory (ICD9: 460-519)) and by age category. Mean daily 24-hour concentrations of S02 and BS were obtained from 19 air quality monitoring stations. After adjustment for smoothed functions of trend, season, day of week, mean daily temperature and relative humidity, a 50 jLLg/m3 increment in a five-day moving average of Black Smoke was associated with increased total mortality (3.8%, 95% CI 1.1% to 6.5%) and cardiovascular disease mortality (4.2%, 95% CI 0.8% to 7.7%) among subjects aged 65 to 74 years. The BS association was not as strong among subjects aged 75 years and older (2.3%). A 100 jng/m3 increment in a five-day moving average of S02 was associated with cardiovascular mortality among subjects aged 65 to 74 years (6.4%, 95% CI 3.0% to 8.8%) and subjects 75 years and older (7.7%, 95% CI 3.5% to 12.0%). These associa? tions are similar to those observed in U.S. and European studies. 664 ENDOCRINE FUNCTION IN MALE WORKERS OCCUPATION? ALLY EXPOSED TO LEAD IN KOREA HYEONGSU KIM, LEE W, CHANG S, LEE S, JU Y, CHOI J, PARK J. Department of Preventive Medicine. EMail: mubul@hanimail.com The objective of this study was to assess whether occupational exposure to lead may be associated with changes in some endocrine function in Korea. Male workers exposed to lead in lead acid battery factories and smelting factory (n=30; mean tenure 8.5 years) and control workers not exposed to inorganic lead occupationally (n=30) were examined. The data was col? lected by interview-type questionnaire, physical examination and estimating biological markers of lead and sex and thyroid hormones on October, 1998 Hemoglobin was significantly lower in exposed group (mean 14-4 g/dl, S.D. 0.9 g/dl) than in nonexposed group (mean 15.6 g/dl, S.D.: 1.0 g/dl). Zinc protoporphyrin(ZPP), blood lead and urine lead were significantly higher in exposed group (mean 87.6 ug/dl, S.D. 75.5 ug/dl; mean 34-4 ug/dl, S.D. 12.9 ug/dl; mean 63.1 ug/g-Cr, S.D. 95.5 ug/g-Cr respectively) than in nonex? posed group (mean 33.1 ug/dl, S.D. 4.6 ug/dl; mean 2.7 ug/dl, S.D. 1.3 ug/dl; mean 2.6 ug/g-Cr, S.D. 4.2 ug/g-Cr respectively). Lutenizing hormone(LH), follicular stimulating hormone(FSH), testosterone, sex hormone binding globuline(SHBG) and free testosterone index(FTI) were lower in exposed group than nonexposed group but there was not statistical significance between exposed and nonexposed group. Study subjects had normal values of thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH) and free thyroxine(T4). TSH was in- significantly lower in exposed group (mean 2.99 ulU/ml, S.D. 0.15 ulU/ml) than nonexposed group (mean: 3.05 ulU/ml, S.D.: 0.12 ulU/ml) but free T4 was significantly lower in exposed group (mean 19.65 pM/1, S.D. 1.86 pM/1) than nonexposed group (mean 21.53 pM/1, S.D. 1.98 pM/1). In exposed group, sex hormones and TSH had no correlation witiH biological markers of lead but free T4 was negatively correlated with amount of smoke (r=-0.41, p=0.04), blood ZPP (r=-0.39, p=0.04), and blood lead (r=-0.37, p&lt;0.045) in simple regression analysis. This study is the first published data on endocrine function in male workers occupationally exposed to lead in Korea. These findings indicate that lead exposure of high concentration influences on some endocrine productions or functions.

A comparison of the performance of these various methods, alone or in combination, will be presented based on our recent data collection completed in 18 Inuit communities. While repeated 24hr recalls provided the most reliable estimates, a mixed-methods approach generates reasonable estimates more efficiently on a larger scale.</page><page sequence="142">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S143 670 ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH OXI- DIZED NITROGEN EXPOSURES AND OXIDATIVE STRESS: HU?

EMail: STabacova@nctr.fda.gov Oxidized nitrogen compounds (e.g. oxides of nitrogen and environmental nitrates) are potent oxidants. Exposures to such compounds during preg? nancy may interfere with its normal course and outcome. Pregnant women, residents of an area contaminated by nitrates and nitrogen oxides, were studied during gestation and at parturition for presence of pregnancy com? plications and neonatal pathology at birth. Methemoglobin in maternal and cord blood was measured as a biomarker of individual exposure to NOx. Blood lipid peroxides and glutathione were determined as oxidative stress biomarkers. Higher maternal exposures to NOx were found in pregnancies with complications in comparison to normal pregnancies. The elevated exposure was associated with increased lipid peroxidation in maternal and cord blood, which in turn was associated with poor birth outcomes, such as prematurity and low birth weight. Controlling for maternal age, parity and smoking did not affect these relationships. Experimental confirmation of these findings was obtained in a study of pregnant Wistar rats exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of N02 levels throughout gesta? tion. A dose-dependent increase in embryofetal loss, decreased birthweight, and postnatal functional deficits in the progeny were observed in association with increased lipid peroxidation in maternal and fetal tissues and placenta. The findings provide evidence that prenatal exposures to oxidized nitrogen compounds are associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes in both human and animal species, and that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of this effect. 673 THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MARINE HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS LORA FLEMING, DEWAILLY ERIC, BADEN D. NIEHS Marine and Freshwater Biomedical Sciences. EMail: lfleming@med.miami.edu The marine Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) appear to be rapidly increasing in incidence and geographic distribution. In addition, new emerging diseases such as Amnesiac Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) are being discovered. Increased seafood consumption, tourism, and recent studies linking global climate change and other anthropomorphic interventions may all be contributing to the increasing incidence of the marine harmful algal bloom diseases. However, the epidemiology of the human diseases caused by the harmful marine phytoplankton is still in its infancy. In general, the epidemiology of these diseases has consisted of case reports of acute illness, sometimes as epidemic outbreaks, associated with the ingestion of suspicious seafood. Furthermore, even these outbreaks are highly under-reported, especially in poorer countries and in traditionally non-endemic areas. True incidence data are not available due to the lack of disease and exposure biomarkers in humans, as well as the global lack of routine exposure and disease surveil? lance. Without true incidence data to establish background population rates, it is impossible to evaluate the impact of Global Change or the apparent increasing incidence. General principles of the epidemiology of the marine harmful algal bloom diseases will be presented. The issue of disease surveillance as an essential component in the epidemiologic study and public health control of the marine harmful algal bloom diseases in human populations will be discussed. Recommendations will be made for the epidemiologic study and public health control of the marine harmful algal bloom diseases in human popu? lations. 672 GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION AS A HEAD AND NECK CANCER RESEARCH STRATEGY CINDY TWOREK, WEINER J. SUNY at Buffalo. EMail: CindyT@buffhet.net This report illustrates a computerized and technical text analysis process to assist epidemiologic investigators in dealing with new and complex topics. New areas of interest to epidemiologists are molecular biology and genetics. Typically, the learning curve for effective collaboration and interaction can be lengthy. The new methodology aids in shortening the time and improving comprehension. This was demonstrated by the construction of a compre? hensive review document with new research strategies, using a head and neck cancer knowledgebase. Those strategies matched 85% of the ones dealing with head and neck cancer genetics in the NIH CRISP database for 1997 and 1998. An example of a current problem facing epidemiologists is the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the occur? rence of cancer. One of the strategies identified from the literature analysis focused on gene-environment interaction and multiple polymorphic path? ways to head and neck cancer development with sufficient exposure to common environmental carcinogens (i.e. alcohol, tobacco). This study demonstrates the methods and indicates the advantages of using this com? puterized knowledgebase approach. The comparison with funded research showed that the largest number of currently funded head and neck strategies in CRISP encompassed gene-environment interaction as a possible etiologic mechanism (41.5%). 675 CHILDREN'S RESPIRATORY HEALTH AND EXPOSURE TO PARTICULATE MATTER AND CO-POLLUTANTS IN EL PASO, TX MELISSA GONZALES, NEAS LUCAS, MUKERJEE SHAIBAL, OZ- KAYNAK HALUK. US Environmental Protection Agency. EMail: gonzales.melissa@epa.gov Two issues of scientific uncertainty in particulate matter epidemiology are the relative health impact of ultrafine particles (&lt;0.3 microns) versus fine particles (PM2.5) and the role of co-pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (N02), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Ultrafine particles may follow the same spatial gradients as the gaseous emissions from mobile sources while PM2.5 may not. Each year over 18 million vehicles cross the three international ports of entry between El Paso, TX and Cuidad Juarez, Mexico. The characteristics of border traffic conges? tion in conjunction with winter meteorologic conditions provides an unique opportunity to investigate the health effects of mobile source pollutants including CO, N02 and VOCs, PM2.5 and ultrafine particles in children. In February 1999, N02 measurements were collected at 20 El Paso elementary schools as an indicator of vehicle emissions. Gradients of N02 concentra? tion were observed with distance from central El Paso and the international border crossings. To further characterize the spatial gradients among ultra? fine PM, PM2.5, CO, N02 and VOCs, measurements were collected during December 1999. From these data, a model will be developed to to charac? terize spatial variation for ultrafine particles from measured concentrations of PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants. The model will be used to assess children's exposure in the subsequent health study. During spring 2000, an assessment of health status will be conducted among fourth and fifth grade students in El Paso. A voluntary respiratory health questionnaire will be distributed through the school to the parents of the students, and pulmonary function measurements will be conducted for those children with parental permission. These data can be compared to a concurrent epidemiologic study of elementary school children and air pollution in Ciudad Juarez. This study will lead to the better understanding of the effects of exposures to ultrafine PM, PM2.5, air toxics and other gaseous pollutants on children's respiratory health.

Institute of Community Medicine, University of Tromso,. EMail: jon.oyvind.odland@ism.uit.no An ongoing study of human pregnancy outcome, trace elements and envi? ronmental pollutants in blood, urine, and breast milk from delivering women and their newborns has lead to the first overview of human environmental exposure in the area. The project is integrated in the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP). We have found elevated levels of pesti? cides at the Russian side, probably explained by local use of chemicals. The levels are significantly higher than comparable values from arctic Scandi- navian areas. Blood lead levels are high, up to the level of clinical concern, in remote areas of the Kola Peninsula and urinary nickel levels are generally high in the Russian populations of study. Detailed dietary studies in coastal, fish eating population are now performed, parallell to analyses of organic contaminants in blood from the same persons. The contaminant levels are low, and not correlated to fish consumption. However, contaminant levels in blood are found to decrease during the breast feeding period. The next phase of the study will be used to explore the relevance of traditional food in relation to levels of toxic substances in human biological material, to look for trends in levels of toxic substances in blood and breast milk in already explored areas, and expand the monitoring areas based on the ?Key areas - strategy? in the AMAP. We have shown significantly lower birth weight in Russia compared to Norway. The difference in newborn children's body mass index (BMI) is even more significant. In the Sami population we find the mean birth weight comparable to the Russian values, while mean BMI is comparable to the Norwegian values, pointing out that the Russian babies are thinner than both the Norwegian and the Sami babies. Explanations for this are not known, but both nutritional and environmental factors might be important. 681 CLIMATE CHANGE, HEAT EXPOSURE AND LABOUR PRODUC- TIVITY TORD KIELLSTROM. University of Auckland, New Zealand. EMail: t.kjellstrom@auckland.ac.nz "Too hot" working environments are not just a question of "comfort", but a real concern for health protection and ability to perform work tasks. For un-acclimatized persons, already at temperatures above 22.5 degrees C the ability to perform at full capacity is reduced, and for acclimatized persons this reduction starts at 26 degrees C (WBGT). The reduction in work ability can be considered a form of "disability" that should be taken into account when assessing the "burden of disease or ill health" caused by global warming. People in tropical developing countries are to some extent acclimatized to the climate in their area of residence, but high temperatures still affect their ability to work. The international standard for work in hot environments (ISO, report 7243, 1989) provides a framework for analyzing the reduction of physical work ability as temperature increases, and it takes acclimatization into account. The standard identifies maximum WBGT temperatures for continuous work (8 hours per day), 75% reduction of work hours, 50% reduction, etc. If work continues beyond these limits the worker is at high risk of diminished work ability, diminished mental task ability, increased accident risk and heat stroke. Converting these relationships for different work intensity into functions showing the reduction of work ability as temperature increases indicates that, even with only one degree increase in temperature (from an already hot temperature) the reductions of work ability can be quite dramatic: up to 30% or more. The consequences of a temper? ature shift for the work ability of populations in selected developing and developed countries are analyzed and calculated in the form of "burden of ill health". 680 DETERMINANTS OF POPS EXPOSURE IN GREENLAND INUIT PETER B1ERREGAARD, DEWAILLY ERIC, AYOTTE PIERRE, PARS TINE, FERRON LILIANE, MULVAD GERT. National Institute of Public Health, Denmark. EMail: p.bjerregaard@dadlnet.dk The purpose of the study was to assess the exposure for organochlorines in relation to age, sex, and diet in a general population sample of Inuit from Greenland. Survey data and plasma concentrations of 14 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 16 pesticides, including 5 toxaphene conge? ners, were recorded in a random population survey of 408 adult indigenous Greenlanders. The geometric mean plasma concentration of the sum of PCB congeners was 12.5 mg/1. Expressed as Aroclor 1260, the PCB concentration was twice as high as among the Inuit of Nunavik, Canada, and 25 times higher than in western societies. Concentrations were similarly elevated for all PCB congeners and pesticides. Concentrations showed statistically sig? nificant positive associations with age, marine diet, and male sex in multiple linear regression analyses. Concentrations adjusted for sex and the consump? tion of marine food increased until appr. 50 years of age equivalent to the birth cohorts of the 1940s, after which they remained constant. This indi? cates that bioaccumulation started in the 1940s, which is a likely date for the introduction of the compounds into the Arctic environment. 684 THE RELATIONSHIP OF MATERNAL BONE LEAD AND UMBIL?

NANDEZ-AVILA M. 1) Department of Preventive Medicine, Dongguk. EMail: hkcheong@mail.dongguk.ac.kr Prenatal lead exposure has adverse effects on the mental development of children. The authors analyzed the effect of prenatal lead exposure on the mental development of children using prenatal lead exposure indices, in? cluding umbilical cord blood lead, maternal bone lead, and children's blood lead at the time of examination. From our Mexico City lead cohort, 633 children bom from mothers at three hospitals in Mexico City were recruited. Maternal lead exposure was assessed by measuring prenatal blood lead, cord blood lead at birth, and patellar and tibial bone lead by KXRF at 1 month postpartum. Children's Bayley mental scale (MDI) and motor scale (PDI) and blood lead was measured at 12, 18, and 24 months of age. After excluding missing data and those not meeting the exclusion criteria, from 152 to 206 children were eligible for regression analysis of their MDI and PDI scores at 12, 18, 24 months. Linear regression analysis was performed on each cross-sectional and longitudinal increment of MDIs and PDIs between each time periods as the response variables, with the lead exposure indices of maternal cortical and trabecular bone lead, cord blood lead, children's blood lead as predictor variables. Mean (SD) cord blood lead level of the subjects was 6.6 (3.6) ug/dL and mean (SD) patellar bone lead was 14.9 (15.5) ug/g. In cross-sectional analyses, umbilical cord blood lead and patellar bone lead was not associated with MDI scores before 24 months of age after controlling for the covariates. Change of MDI score between 12 and 18 months was not related to any of the lead indices. However, changes of MDI from 12 months to 24 month had a significant relationship with patellar bone lead (B=-0.167, p=0.038) and a borderline significant relationship with umbilical cord blood lead (B=-0.754, p=0.060). Change of MDI from 18 months to 24 months was significantly related to umbilical cord blood lead (B=-0.714, p=0.020), and had a borderline significant relationship with patellar bone lead (B=-0.013, p=0.071). The above results suggest that trabecular bone lead, as well as umbilical cord blood lead, is a good predictor of children's mental develop? ment after 12 months of age.</page><page sequence="144">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S145 685 CORRELATION ANALYSIS OF DIGESTIVE CANCER MORTAL? ITY IN RELATION WITH CONTAMINATION BY DSP TOXINS IN FRANCE SYLVAINE CORDIER, MONFORT C, MIOSSEC L, RICHARDSON S, BELIN C INSERM UNIT 170. EMail: cordier@vjf.inserm.fr Shellfish consumers are exposed to the risk of diarrhea resulting from shellfish contamination by, among other contaminants, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP)- producing algae such as Dinophysis spp. Although pre? vention of these acute effects has been effective since the set-up in 1984 by IFREMER of a phycotoxins monitoring network along the coasts of France, there is concern that residual levels of okadaic acid, the main toxin present in French coastal waters, and known tumor promoter, might lead to an increase in the risk of cancer among regular shellfish consumers. In order to test this hypothesis we conducted an ecological study linking digestive cancer mortality rates with a proxy measure of contamination by DSP toxins in 59 coastal areas. Observed and expected numbers of deaths (using country rates as reference) were computed by sex, cause of death, and area, for two time periods : 1984-1988 and 1989-1993. The level of contamination in each area was estimated by the total number of weeks of shut-down of the producing area, because of DSP-toxins contamination, since the beginning of monitoring. We used both Poisson regressions and test for trends of standardized mor? tality ratios across four categories of exposure. We found some evidence of assocations for several digestive cancer sites (oesophagus, stomach, colon and liver and total digestive for males, stomach and pancreatic cancer for females). Among males, after taking into account possible confounding by alcohol drinking most statistical significances dis- appeared except for colon cancer. In the absence of human data this study is a first step in the investigation of potential health effects of okadaic acid. The conclusions provided by this analysis are very temptative ; they need to be strengthened and interpreted in the light of other pieces of knowledge on potential long-term effects of DSP-toxins in shellfish. 687 A REVIEW OF THE ECONOMIC EFFECT OF SMOKE-FREE RES- TAURANT AND BAR POLICIES ON THE HOSPITALITY ECON- OMY. ANDREW HYLAND, VENA CHRIS, CUMMINGS K MICHAEL. Ro- swell Park Cancer Institute. EMail: andrew.hyland@roswellpark.org The objective of this review is to assess the economic impact of smoke-free restaurant legislation on the hospitality economy. A number of different methods have been used to address this issue including the analysis of aggregate taxable sales data, surveys of restaurant owners, surveys of con? sumers, analysis of restaurant employment statistics, and analysis of com- plaint and violation records. Data will be presented providing an overview for the rationale for the passage of clean indoor air policies and results of the most recent studies that outline the current state of the literature in this area. Additionally, opportunities for future research will be examined. 686 RESEARCH SYNTHESIS OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES IN EN? VIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY CONCERNING WITH DAILY TIME SERIES OF AIR POLLUTANTS AND RESPIRATORY HEALTH EFFECTS CHIARA BONETTO, BELLINI PIERANTONIO. Department of Statisti? cal Sciences-Bologna University. EMail: chibone@tin.it This work is an attempt to deal with the question of how it is possible to do research synthesis in such a way that the available sample of selected studies supports reasonable inference about environmental epidemiology, particu? larly with attention to the relationship between air pollutants and respiratory effects based on daily time series. The authors intend to point out that the statistical tools used in papers involved in this kind of research synthesis may have a problematic role in the interpretation of the results of the same research synthesis. Mainly two are the points considered here. The first regards to how it is possible to combine studies; the second focuses on the kind of bias (e.g. publication bias, language bias, citation bias, multiple publication bias, database bias, inclusion bias). The authors have been interested in the development of answers to some methodological questions as well as the implementation of a bibliographical DB which includes papers about the association between air pollution and health effects published on four major journals (American Journal of Epi? demiology, Archives of Environmental Health, Environmental Health Per- spectives, Environmental Research). With the aim of putting into concrete form a research synthesis process about observational studies, the authors have updated the above mentioned DB, previously concerned with papers published during the decade 1985-94, to the period 1995-99.

TION IN THE ARCTIC CHRIS FURGAL, DEWAILLY ERIC, BRUNEAU SUZANNE, BLANCHET CAROLE, GREY MINNIE. CHUQ - Pavillon CHUL. EMail: cfurgal@cspq.qc.ca Traditional foods obtained through hunting, fishing and collecting from the land and oceans have been central to the lives of Aboriginal people in the North for hundreds of years. In the past, the Arctic has been viewed as a region free from much of the environmental damage seen at lower latitudes related to industrial activity. However, more recently, significant levels of persistent pol? lutants, such as organochlorines and heavy metals, have been found in northern ecosystems and people. The understanding of contaminants at northern lati? tudes is important because the specificity of this ecosystem, and Aboriginal peoples' relationship to it, implies that human exposure to contaminants can be of great concern. Risks of contaminants to human health through consumption of traditional foods vary from immunosuppressive, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and hormone disturbing effects to potential neurodevelopmental and reproduc? tive disorder. Additionally, risks related to some food borne diseases and some traditional food preparation techniques (igunak) raise concern among public health officials as they can result in incidences of botulism and toxoplasmosis in local populations. Despite these risks, traditional food is still the anchor to cultural and personal well-being and is essential to the nutritional and social health of individuals and communities in the North. Traditional foods comprise nearly 50% of weekly protein, iron and vitamin A intake among individuals in some age groups across the North and make up approximately 30% of the total food weight consumed. On an annual basis, 100% of Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) of selenium, vitamins D and A, and greater than 50% of RNIs for iron and protein are reached through current levels of traditional food consumption in some regions. A low incidence of cardiovascular heart disease, diabetes and some cancers in Inuit populations has been attributed, in part, to traditional food consumption because of their high concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants such as selenium. Additionally, traditional food collection, distribution (sharing), preparation and consumption are reported by northerners to contribute vital components to many aspects of their social well-being and cultural health. This presentation derives data from a number of studies to discuss the various benefits and risks presented by the consumption of traditional foods, and the challenges this combination of perspectives pose for northern environment and health officials in managing and balancing the benefits and risks when making decisions and conducting communications related to human health and traditional foods in the Arctic.</page><page sequence="145">S146 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 690 LEAD SHOT AS A SOURCE OF LEAD POISONING IN THE CA? NADIAN ARCTIC. ERIC DEWAILLY, LEVESQUE BENOIT, DUCHESNE JEAN-F, DUMAS P, SCHEUHAMMER ANTON, GARIEPY CLEMENT, RHAINDS MARC, PROULX JEAN-F. CHUQ. EMail: edewailly@cspq.qc.ca Since the beginning of the 1980s, lead contamination of the environment has progressively become a major public health concern since low level lead exposure has been shown to induce neurobehavioral effects in young chil? dren.. Native people may receive unusually high doses of heavy metals and other food chain contaminants due to their particular dietary and lifestyle habits. .We report here the results of a survey conducted among Inuit newborn from Nunavik (Northern Quebec, Canada) to document the lead concentration in cord blood and investigate the possible sources of exposure. Close to 7% of the 475 participating newborn had a cord blood lead concentration equal or greater than the 0.48 mmol/l (10 mg/dl) level of intervention adopted by govemmental agencies. An epidemiological inves? tigation as well as determination of the lead stable isotopic ratio by ICP-MS in cord blood samples were conducted among 29 newborns with lead levels equal to or greater than 0.48 mmol/l. Each of these children was paired with a control from the same community and 3 other controls previously sampled from a study carried in the South of Quebec. For each blood sample isotopic ratio (206/207) was determined. The geometric means of cord blood lead concentrations for the most exposed Inuit, the least exposed Inuit, and the new-boms from Southern Quebec were respectively: 0.62 jxmol/l (95% CI: 0.57-0.67; n=29); 0.20 /unol/l (95% CI: 0.17-0.23; n=31); and 0.11 /xmol/1 (95% CI: 0.10-0.11; n=89). The average 206Pb/207Pb ratio for the 60 Inuit new-boms was 1.195 (range: 1.166-1.230; 95% CI: 1.190-1.200). There was no meaningful isotopic difference (Student t-test: p=0.09), either in the range or the average between the most exposed new-boms and the least exposed ones. Thus the two groups were likely exposed to the same sources of lead. In the population of new-boms from southern Quebec, on the contrary, the average 206Pb/207Pb ratio was significantly less radiogenic (1.166; range= 1.126-1.230; 95% CI: 1.163-1.168; Student t-test: p?0.0001) indicating different source of exposure. We also examined the lead isotope of the four most popular brands of shotgun cartridges used by Nunavik hunters. They yielded a mean 206Pb/207Pb ratio of 1.193 (n=10; range: 1.125-1.233), similar to that of the lead found in Inuit new-boms (1.195). Consequently, it is likely that the ingestion of lead shot or lead- bearing fragments from game meat, and notably waterfowl may be respon? sible for the higher lead levels found in Nunavik Inuit new-borns. 692 HEALTH EFFECTS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES: DATA FROM THE NATIONAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION EX? AMINATION SURVEY, 1988-1994 DAVID MANNINO, MOORMAN J, KINGSLEY B, ROSE D, REPACE JAMES. CDC. EMail: Dmm6@cdc.gov We sought to determine the effects of prenatal and postnatal smoke exposure on the respiratory health of children in the U.S. We analyzed data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey including questionnaire information, measurements of serum cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine), and pulmonary function measurement of 5,672 children, representing an esti? mated 37.7 million U.S. children. We stratified the study participants into tertiles, based on serum cotinine levels, and used logistic and linear regres? sion modeling, adjusting for known covariates, to determine the effect of high environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure (based on a high coti? nine level) to outcomes such as the prevalence of current asthma, the prevalence of frequent wheezing, school absence, and lung function. For children 4-11 years old we also attempted to determine the effect of prenatal maternal smoking on these outcomes. Adverse effects of ETS exposure were seen in all age groups after adjusting for covariates. Among children age 4-6 the largest effects were for wheeze apart from cold in the past year (odds ratio (OR) 4.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1, 9.6) and current asthma (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.6- 9.3). Among children age 7-11 the largest effects were for chronic bronchitis (OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.6- 8.3) and low lung function (OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.9-4.7), and among children age 12-16 the largest effects were for 6 or more school absence days in the previous year (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.8-4.8) and low lung function (OR 2.3,95% CI 1.1,4.7). Recent ETS exposure is most predictive of adverse outcomes, although prenatal ETS exposure may be related to current asthma in the youngest children. ETS exposure adversely affects children of all ages, although the exact effects may vary between age groups. For the outcomes we investigated in children 4 years and older, post-natal exposures seem to be more impor? tant than prenatal maternal smoking. 691 AIR POLLUTION HEALTH EFFECTS STUDIES UNDER BORDER XXI MELISSA GONZALES, ROSALBA ROJAS. US Environmental Protec? tion Agency. EMail: gonzales.melissa@epa.gov Rapid population growth and industrialization in cities along the US- Mexico border have created concerns about pollution and health. To address these concerns, the Border XXI Environmental Health Workgroup was formed to increase collaboration between environmental and public health entities to address environmental health concerns and reduce the rates of associated disease along the border. Additionally, the Air Workgroup has coordinated the efforts of US and Mexican agencies to assess causes of and solutions to air quality problems. The Paso del Norte (PdN) region, repre- senting El Paso (USA) and Ciudad Juarez (Mexico), is one of the largest sister-city metropolitan regions on the border. Over 18 million vehicles annually pass between the two cities, and numerous maquiladoras (assembly plants) and other industrial facilities are located in the area. The PdN has experienced major air pollution problems including levels of particulate matter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (03) that exceed regulatory levels for both countries. Three air pollution health effects studies have been planned and/or conducted in the PdN region under Border XXI. A retrospective analysis of asthma-related emergency room visits and levels of 03 and PM10 in 1994-95 showed a significant association between emergency visits and the PM10 levels two days prior (Hart 1999). Subse- quently, a surveillance system to define acute and chronic health effects related to 03, PM10 and CO was started in Ciudad Juarez during Spring 2000. The system includes four projects: 1) morbidity in school children, 2) effects on asthmatic children, 3) surveillance in the general population, and 4) surveillance of daily morbidity in first contact, outpatient, emergency and hospitalization services. In El Paso, a study will be initiated in Fall 2000 to assess the association between respiratory symptoms and illness in children and levels of PM10, PM2.5, ultrafine PM, air toxics, and other criteria air pollutants. These studies utilize the air monitoring networks established on both sides of the border. The El Paso study includes enhanced school-based monitoring and exposure modeling. Under Border XXI Workgroups, atmo? spheric characterization and modeling studies as well as population exposure assessments, have been conducted in other sister-cities along the border. These studies may lead to future epidemiologic and intervention studies in the region. Hart et al. (1999) Ambient Air Quality and Acute Pediatric Respiratory Illness in the Paso del Norte Airshed.

CHUQ. EMail: edewailly@cspq.qc.ca The global community has become increasingly concerned about interac? tions between ocean and human health as potential impacts reach multiple levels of public health, economies, and environments. Degradation of our oceans is having profound effects on coastal communities and some specific emerging public health events, such as those related to harmful algal blooms, contamination of aquatic foods chain by heavy metals and organochlorines, epidemics of pathogens, and extreme climate events are more frequently observed today than ever before. These phenomenon are now observed world-wide and often take place within contexts involving rapid and com? plex economic and demographic change. Consequences of interactions between ocean and human health are not only direct through related mortality and morbidity, but also indirect through such processes as shifts in dietary habits. In order to monitor these changes, indicators for ocean and human health must be developed and their status repeatedly assessed over time. In November 1999, the International Centre for Ocean and Human Health hosted an international conference, sponsored by NIEHS and IOC (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission), on this subject. Public health indicators for maritime communities were selected with priority for the assessment of exposure and effects related to: 1) pathogens (cholera, hepatitis A, etc); 2) persistent organic pollutants (PCBs, DDT, etc); 3) heavy metals (MeHg, Cd, etc) and; 4) harmful algal blooms. Indicators of human susceptibility were also considered (level of seafood consumption, population density, etc). Harmonisation of these indicators with those developed for ecosystem health was deemed a necessary and important contribution to this process. In the selection of indicators, emphasis was also placed on the need for cost effective and easily implemented tools to be used in the assessment of human exposure and effects related to ocean change. Although some selected indicators are universal (can be applied in all geographical regions), others are considered to be more regionally specific (e.g. tropical vs. arctic). The examples of populations living on small tropical islands, in remote Arctic communities, and in more heavily polluted coastal urban centres will be used to illustrate the choice of selected public health indicators to monitor ocean and human health in a global context.</page><page sequence="146">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S147 694 THE EFFECTS OF MIGRATION ON THE DETECTION OF DIS?

Imperial College School of Medicine. EMail: m.joffe@ic.ac.uk The range of endpoints covered by reproductive epidemiology is potentially wide. The central focus is on the conception, intra-uterine development and survival of infants, but also included is the health of the reproductive systems of both sexes, which can be defined in restricted or in broad terms. Time is of the essence in infant development. Thus the timing of an insult in relation to the stage of development is crucially important; a given exposure may have a different impact, or no impact, at a different stage. Pathogenic processes include genetic - both inherited and sporadic - and teratogenic processes. They do not correspond directly to outcomes manifest to parents and clinicians. For example, embryotoxicity may be manifest as early loss or malformation. They are not equally simple to ascertain, and may correspond to different dose levels, giving rise to a "dose-response fallacy". Moreover, a chromosomal aberration present since conception will cause malformation only if the embryo survives to birth, raising the question of intra-uterine "quality control", and how this relates to embyonic/early fetal loss - perhaps 25% unrecognised loss plus 10% recognised miscarriages. Low birth weight is a clear risk factor for neonatal mortality, a range of outcomes in childhood and for several chronic diseases of late adult life. Its determinants are therefore very important to understand. However, birth weight is merely an indicator variable - a biomarker. To indict low birth weight or reduced fetal growth per se is an over-simplification: paradoxically, babies who are at increased risk both of low birth weight and of mortality, e.g. because of being twins or of in utero exposure to tobacco smoke, have relatively low mortality risk within each birth weight category below 2500 grams. This raises another question: to what extent are variations in birth weight physiological (association with maternal size, possibly) or patholog- ical? The reproductive health of adults is also important. The health of the male reproductive system has received a great deal of attention in recent years, due to increasing testicular cancer incidence and probably falling sperm concentration. The hypothesis that synthetic chemicals with estrogenic (or more generally, endocrine disrupting or modulating) properties are respon? sible has been prominent, although it does not fit well with the time course or with other data. Less attention has been given to other toxicological mechanisms that could affect the health of gametes and embryos. 695 PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AND ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN YOUNG CHILDREN ALONG THE US-MEXICO BORDER PAULINE MENDOLA, ROSSANNE PHILEN. US EPA. EMail: mendola.pauline@epa.gov There is substantial public health concern regarding children's exposure to pesticides. In many border communities, agriculture is a year-round enter- prise and persistent exposure is possible. Research on pesticides and children is complicated because children may be exposed to multiple pesticides from a variety of sources and pathways and the potential health impact of these exposures is largely unknown. Children are assumed to be particularly vulnerable to adverse health effects associated with pesticide exposure be? cause their behavior (hand-to-mouth, playing on floors, etc.) puts them at higher likelihood of exposure and because their developing organ systems may be more sensitive. The purpose of this initiative is to develop and implement an approach to examine the cumulative risks in children from persistent exposure to pesti? cides via multiple pathways and sources. This initiative consists of three phases. Phase I, completed in 1998, assembled data on pesticide usage, pediatric health; developed compatible GIS systems along the border; and held a health effects workshop focused on potential pilot studies for various health endpoints including neurologic, developmental, pulmonary, immu? nologic and cancer. The main questions being addressed in Phase II are the extent and distri? bution of pesticide exposures in children living in the border region and the identification of children with the highest levels of exposure. Screening studies for organophosphate exposure have been conducted among school children in Arizona and pre-schoolers in California. The CDC, EPA and the border states are cooperating on several studies including investigations of infant immune response to vaccination, non-occupational pesticide expo? sures, home pesticide use, and a study of highly exposed children in Texas. In addition to these field studies, several Phase II investigations are designed to address the lack of simple, rapid and inexpensive biomarkers of exposure. Phase III will include a more complete monitoring of exposure pathways and an epidemiologic study will be conducted to examine specific hypotheses regarding the impact of pesticide exposure on the health status of children. This is an abstract of a proposed presentation and does not necessarily reflect EPA policy. 697 ECOSYSTEM INDICATORS OF OCEAN AND HUMAN HEALTH ANTHONY KNAP, DEPLEDGE M, DEWAILLY ERIC. Bermuda Biolog? ical Station for Research, Inc. EMail: knap@bbsr.edu The interaction between Humans and the Ocean is important and requires more detailed study on an international basis. The world's oceans provide great health benefits to humans from food and nutritional resources, to recreational opportunities and new cures of human disease. Migration of humans to the coastal zone and increasing human populations will increase pressure on this ocean/land interface. Coastal degradation, climate variabil? ity and increased industrialization will increase the risk of mobilization of anthropogenically derived and natural toxic agents in the environment and thus transfers to humans. Studies of these interactions need to be focussed at the point of entry to humans - Ingestion, Dermal and Inhalation. Of all the modes of entry, the main concern is the ingestion of contaminated seafood, therefore those humans who ingest large quantities of seafood are most a risk, however pathogen and marine toxin outbreaks provide an acute health risk. A monitoring system that includes Rapid Assessment of contaminants in the ecosystem with appropriate internationally distributed GIS-type data bases needs to be developed to provide early detection leading to prevention of human illness. As analysis of contaminants is expensive and time-consuming - appropriate markers and indicators need to be used, new ones developed and all assessed. Parts of such a system are currently being developed by the Health of the Ocean Panel of the Global Ocean Observing System where a program RAMP (Rapid Assessment of Marine Pollution) has been adopted. The program uses biological markers as potential early warning systems for ecosystem degradation and is ideal for remote areas where sophisticated chemical measurements are difficult to deploy.</page><page sequence="147">S148 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 698 ACHIEVING UNIFORMITY IN REPORTING OF LABORATORY ANALYSES OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS 1 VENA, WEINER J, BUCK G. SPM. EMail: jvena@buffalo.edu The New York State Angler Cohort Study was initiated in 1991 to estimate the health consequences of consumption of sport fish and wildlife from Lakes Erie, Ontario and their associated tributaries. As part of that ongoing program, blood samples were obtained from women and men to investigate links between concentration of environmental toxicants and various re? ported behaviors and endpoints. The specimens from these individuals were analyzed using improved methods designed to measure 78 congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and seven selected pesticides. The labo? ratory process involved incorporation of four essential quality control func? tions. The first was assessment of procedure error by including a specimen containing the extraction solvents (i.e., the hexane procedure blank). The second was assessment of recovery of known concentrations (i.e., the recov- ery specimen). The third was measurement of the lipids contained in each blood sample to assess the carrier effect associated with the lipophilic character of the analytes. The fourth was a duplicate sample of one of the participant specimens. These values, for each batch of 10 participant sam? ples, were used to assess and adjust the measured amounts of the congeners in order to provide a more accurate description of the environmental toxicant effect versus closely related effects associated with the analytic process. The designation of the limit of detection (LOD) is a complex process often simplified in service laboratory settings by computing the mean and standard deviation or standard error and assigning the LOD to be some multiple of that measure of variation above the mean. Other designations of the LOD can be zero or some midpoint between zero and the mean for the procedure blanks. A more recent approach involves determination of the probability distribution associated with LOD values and using that informa? tion to impute a reasonable value for the LOD. As such, the values for specific congeners of PCBs and pesticides coming from the laboratory appear to be of two types-examples of background noise based on the designation of the LOD and real measurements again based on the assumed LOD. However, without identification of biologically relevant indicators, the laboratory measurements cannot be interpreted. This report illustrates a formalized process in determining the importance of a congener value. The first crite? rion employed is statistical significance based on the selected multivariate model. The second criterion is laboratory credibility by determining the proportion of the sample with the identified significant congener values greater than the LOD in exposed versus unexposed groups. The third is biologic relation by showing that the statistically significant and laboratory credible congeners also are involved in describing a biologic relationship. By providing results based on these criteria, the various field studies can achieve uniformity and standardization enabling appropriate comparison and inter? pretation of the findings. 700 MEASURING ENDPOINTS IN REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOP? MENTAL HEALTH: RECENT AND FUTURE RESEARCH GAYLE WINDHAM. CA Dept. of Health Services. EMail: gwindham@dhs. ca.gov Compromised reproductive function as a result of exposure to environmental contaminants is of great concern to the public. Yet research in this area in humans has been limited until relatively recently. One of the difficulties in studying reproductive and developmental toxicity is the necessity of considering up to three individuals, i.e. each member of the couple and their offspring. In terms of reproductive health, other difficulties arise from the complex nature of menstrual cyclicity and limitations of access to the germ cells and products of conceptus on a population basis. Thus reproductive potential has been assessed by such crude measures as infertility, based on lack of clinical pregnancy or birth in a defined time frame, or descriptions of menstrual cycle length and regularity or non-specific symptoms. Developmental endpoints have traditionally been studied as observable adverse outcomes of pregnancy, such as low birthweight or congenital malformations. This talk will highlight new methods for examining reproductive potential and fecundity in both males and females in epidemiologic studies. Recent work on measuring hormone metabolites in urine, for example, has allowed more detailed assessment of menstrual function and earlier examination of conception or pregnancy. These may also be useful for assessing another endpoint of concern, namely the end of the reproductive life span, or menopause. In males, analysis of sperm count and motility has been available for some time, but newer computerized methods allow for additional mea? sures of semen quality and hormones may also be measured in males. In terms of developmental outcomes, later effects of prenatal exposures are of increas? ing interest, such as on neuro-behavioral and sexual development. In addi? tion, identifying susceptible sub-groups via genetic variation is also receiving recent attention. Measurement of these endpoints and examples from cur? rent work will be presented. 699 CONCENTRATION OF CONGENERS AND CONSUMPTION OF SPORT FISH FROM GREAT LAKES MICHAEL BLOOM, WEINER J, VENA J, BUCK G, GREIZERSTEIN H. SUNY@Buffalo. EMail: msbloom@buffalo.edu Seventy-eight individual PCB congeners and 3 pesticides were measured in blood specimens from 51 male participants in the New York State Angler Cohort Study (NYSACS) as a part of a validation study conducted in 1993. The data values were adjusted for recovery, level of procedural detection, lipid concentration in the blood specimen and transformed to the natural logarithmic scale. The data were analyzed using stepwise linear discriminant function analysis to determine the congeners significantly involved in dif- ferentiating males who did and did not consume sport fish from Lake Ontario and other Western New York waters. In addition to this identification of statistically significant variates, the congeners were assessed for laboratory credibility by determining for each involved congener the percentage of values above the respective Levels of Detection (LOD) in the exposed groups, i.e., congeners with at least 30% of laboratory values above the LOD. This criterion ensured that the statistically significant values also were present more frequently in the exposed group, thus, enhancing potential interpretations of the findings. Finally, the statistically significant and cred- ible congeners were employed in seeking biologic relations. The findings illustrated the importance of low yield congeners, or those that tended to be less prevalent in humans, as markers of sport fish consumption and are consistent with the possibility that such congeners may be instrumental in influencing noncancer endpoints such as reproductive health. These results are in keeping with the premise that many of these congeners disrupt endocrine functions. 701 CHALLENGES IN IDENTIFYING GENETIC MARKERS OF SUS? CEPTIBILITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS FOR PAR? KINSON'S DISEASE HARVEY CHECKOWAY. University of Washington. EMail: checko@u.washington.edu Increasing recognition that environmental exposures may be important risk factors for non-familial (sporadic) Parkinson's disease (PD) has prompted concomitant research into genetically-determined susceptibility traits. Case- control comparisons of frequencies of polymorphisms for candidate genes has been the primary research strategy. Enthusiasm for this avenue of research was greatly stimulated by studies in the early 1990s demonstrating roughly 2-fold PD risks associated with the genotype for poor metabolizer status of the liver enzyme debrisoquine hydroxylase, cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Coherence for the observed relation with CYP2D6 derived from observations that the CYP2D6 enzyme is expressed in brain and detoxifies l-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a street drug con? taminant that is an established cause of human parkinsonism. However, subsequent epidemiologic studies of the CYP2D6 gene and PD yielded considerably weaker evidence. Numerous other candidate genes have been investigated, including genes for monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) which activates MPTP, cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) which metabolizes sol? vents and can generate free radicals, glutathione S-transferases (GST) that reduce oxidative stress damage from numerous chemicals, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) which can either provoke or protect against oxidative stress damage; an SOD mutation has also been linked to familial amyotro- phic lateral sclerosis. The results have been highly variable, and to date, the "susceptibility" genes for sporadic PD remain to be determined. The most noteworthy impediments to progress identifying susceptibility genes are: 1) the absence of consistent associations for specific environmental toxicants and PD; 2) limited understanding of the functional consequences of many genetic polymorphisms; and 3) low statistical power to test for gene/envi- ronment and gene/gene interactions, due to the relative rarity of many mutant variants. Anticipated advances in environmental exposure assess? ment and functional genomics research, and collaborative multi-center PD studies should help to overcome these obstacles.</page><page sequence="148">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S149 702 EXPOSURES OF CURRENT INTEREST IN REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL HEALTH: EMERGING OR UNDER- STUDIED PROBLEMS SONIA TABACOVA. National Center of Hygiene Bulgaria and NCTR, FDA. EMail: stabacova@nctr.fda.gov A number of chemicals, occurring as environmental contaminants, are potentially hazardous to human reproduction and prenatal development. However, as recognized by the World Health Organization, the extent of reproductive health impairment from occupational and environmental ex? posures is unknown. Few agents have been studied in man; efforts at systematic evaluation are hindered by the complexity of environmental exposures, difficulties in measuring individual exposures, multifactorial eti? ology of reproductive/developmental pathologies, and difficulties in control? ling for a multitude of confounding factors. In the process of risk assessment, exposure assessment is the first, and often most essential step. This presen? tation discusses issues of identification of exposures potentially hazardous to reproductive and developmental health and approaches to their assessment and use in studies of adverse outcomes in humans. Prioritization of environ? mental chemicals according to their potential as developmental toxicants and their accessibility to human populations will be discussed. Approaches to assessment of internal exposures by biomarkers (e.g. determination of agents or their metabolic products in matemal/fetal biological media) will be illustrated by examples from chemical classes of high priority (e.g. metals, oxidants, organic solvents, and other volatile organic compounds). Complex exposures to chemical agents and non-chemical factors resulting in modifi? cation (especially potentiation) of adverse reproductive and developmental effect will also be discussed. 705 PESTICIDES AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE: THE AGRICUL? TURAL HEALTH STUDY FREYA KAMEL, TANNER C, HOPPIN J, UMBACH D, CHAN P, LANGSTON J, BLAIR A, SANDLER D. National Institute of Environ? mental Health Sciences. EMail: kamel@niehs.nih.gov Exposures to environmental toxicants may play a role in the etiology of PD. Numerous case-control studies have suggested that rural living, well-water drinking, farming occupation, and pesticide use may be associated with increased risk of PD. However, these studies typically involved few partici? pants exposed to pesticides and therefore had limited power to address this issue. Furthermore, exposure assessment usually relied on questionnaires and was restricted to broad classes of pesticides, limiting the opportunity to identify specific etiologic agents. The Agricultural Health Study is a pro? spective cohort study of 52,000 private applicators, mainly farmers, and 32,000 of their spouses; participants were enrolled in 1994-96 in Iowa and North Carolina. We are planning to conduct a nested case-control study to evaluate the association of PD with exposure to pesticides or other environ? mental toxicants in this cohort. PD cases will be ascertained using a multi- stage screening process designed to identify cases in unselected populations. We expect to identify approximately 120 prevalent and 40 incident cases. Diagnosis of PD will be confirmed with an examination by a board-certified neurologist. We will compare the cases to 480 individually age- and sex- matched controls randomly selected from the remainder of the cohort. Exposure information will be derived from (1) pre-existing data collected from the entire cohort at enrollment and 5 year follow-up; (2) telephone interviews; (3) surveys of farm sites and records; and (4) measurement of organochlorine pesticides and metals in blood and household dust. The proposed study will be both population-based and representative of a large segment of the farming population. In addition, exposure assessment will involve both prospective and laboratory-based measurements as well as validation of self-reported information. Thus this study has the potential to contribute greatly to our understanding of the role of pesticides and other toxicants in the etiology of PD. 703 THE CONTINUING IMPACT OF LOVE CANAL E FITZGERALD, KIM N, STARK A, KENNY L, MAZUR A. NYS De? partment of Health. EMail: eff02@health.state.ny.us The Love Canal landfill contained approximately 21,800 tons of chemical wastes. Substantial migration and contamination of soil, groundwater and basement air of nearby homes was apparent in the late 1970s. Residents of two streets adjacent to the landfill were evacuated in 1978, and residents of several nearby streets were evacuated in 1980. (May 20, 2000 is the 20-year anniversary.) This site has been documented as one of the most seriously contaminated landfills in the United States to date. The methodologies available at the time for environmental sampling, chemical analysis, risk assessment, environmental epidemiology and risk communication were at early stages of development. Consequently, the evaluations were often inconclusive and conflicting. These equivocal results left former residents confused and apprehensive about their long-term health risks and distrustful of governmental agencies. This symposium will include: a discussion of governmental responses between 1978-80; the perspective of a former resident and community activist; the perceptions of a scientist from the Department of Health; an integrated overview of the catastrophe by a social scientist; and a presentation of the current follow-up health study. The current project is using advances in scientific methods and community involvement to more precisely estimate the potential level of exposure for each individual and the evaluation of risk of cancer, adverse reproductive outcomes and all-cause mortality. Exposure estimation will be based on the 13,000 multi-media environmental samples that were collected between 1978-80, modeled behavior patterns based on age and gender and analyses of archived sera of former residents for Love Canal indicator chemicals. Health outcomes will be estimated using the New York State Cancer Registry, birth certificates, death certificates, and the New York State Congenital Malformations Registry. Community involvement is being main- tained throughout the study through an advisory committee, open meetings and a twice-a-year newsletter that is mailed to the approximately 6,000 individuals who comprise the study cohort. 706 PREDICTING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE EXPO? SURES AND RISKS OF RESTAURANT, BAR, AND CASINO WORKERS IAMES REPACE. Repace Associates, Inc, Secondhand Smoke. EMail: &lt;repace@erols.com&gt; Assessing the exposures of hospitality industry workers in restaurants, bars, and casinos is important because these workers appear to have both the greatest environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposures and the least pro? tection from those exposures of any group of workers. Data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) shows that in 1996, while 65.3% of all workers worked in smoke-free conditions, only 36.3% of food service workers did (Shopland, 2000), and the percentage of casino workers who work smoke- free is likely to be close to zero. Restaurant and bar owners typically resist smoking bans, and often litigation is threatened, suggesting that this group of workers will remain the least protected. It is therefore important to assess exposure, dose, and risk for hospitality industry workers. Casino workers in New Jersey and Nevada, as well as in Perth, Australia, have filed suit over smoking. Measuring concentrations of ETS in bars, restaurants and casinos under representative natural conditions is difficult; however time-averaged concentrations of ETS tracers such as RSP and nicotine can be modeled or back-calculated from cotinine in body fluids, and vice versa. These models allow a generalized discussion of risk and control for occupational health policy purposes. Future research needs are discussed.</page><page sequence="149">S150 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 708 INVESTIGATION OF HEAT STRESS IN THERMAL WORK EN? VIRONMENT TADESSE AGONAFIR, LAKEW K. Labour and Social Affairs Bureau, Addis Ababa,. EMail: AAchamberl@telecom.net.et Aim: -To determine the extent of heat stress among heat exposed workers and to evaluate the physiological and work place thermal parameters in comparison to the ISO standard. Method: Eighty nine workers with mean age 35 ? 10 years and mean length of employment of 8.92 ? 8.3 years from 13 factories having hot work environment were assessed. Thermal parameters such as Dry Bulb(DB), Wet Bulb(WB), Wet Bulb Globe Temperature(WBGT),Globe Temperature (GT) were measured using Heat Stress Monitor (HSM-lOO)and the air speed was assayed by Anemotherm air meter. Physiological parameters such as heart rates and weight difference as a measure of sweating rates were determined following the ISO protocols. Signs and symptoms of heat stress were also assessed by administrating a pretested questionnaires. Result: The mean dirunal temperature was between 23-26 OC. The mean WBGT readings were 26.40?2.40, 8.73?3.33,and 29.85 ?3.230C for mod? erate, high and very high work load respectively. The Globe temperature varied between 28.20 and 59.46, the mean temprature being 39.3 ?7.45 OC. The relative humidity ranges from 32% to 50%b and the mean air velocity recorded was usually between 0.20-2.12 m/s. The mean deep body temper? ature was 37.35 (range 36.70-39.40) . The average heart rate was 80.15 =t 11.98 beat/minute and the mean skin temperature was 36.25 ? 0.886. Sweating rate among the study subjects was 428 ?0.7g/h. Signs and symp? toms of heat stress such as sweating (92.13%), blurred vision (64.04%), weakness (52.81%) and head ache (49.44%) were prevalent among the workers. Eighty percent of heat exposed subjects complained about discom? fort they encounter in their work and said that they work either in too warm or warm environment. Conclusion: Although the WBGT values for moderate work was below the ISO standard, most of the workers complained that their workplace is not comfortable. Signs and symptoms were prevalent among the study subjects. Sweat rate was nearly 400g/hr and heart rate was also below 100 beat/min. This is due to the fact that most workers had moderate work load and have longer rest period. 710 ISSUES RELATED TO STUDYING OCCUPATIONAL METAL EX? POSURES AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE BENTAMIN RYBICKI, GORELL J, JOHNSON C, PETERSON E, FISHER J, KIRKEY K. Henry Ford Health System. EMail: brybickl@hfhs.org While cancer epidemiologists have long employed expert review of job histories for assessing occupationally related exposures, neuroepidemiologists have only recently made use of such methodology. In general, both are faced with retrospectively characterizing exposures over a long pre-disease period because of unknown disease latencies. Neurological diseases, however, present a unique set of methodological challenges, including determining whether exposures can cross the blood-brain barrier, accuracy of disease diagnoses and possible referral biases. In this presentation, we show how industrial hygienist assessed occupational exposures were used to draw in? ferences about chronic metal exposure and risk for Parkinson's Disease (PD). Methodological issues particular to neurological diseases that need to be considered will be reviewed. The reliability of the industrial hygienist review methodology and its comparability to other exposure assessment methodol? ogies will also be explored. Based on our findings of a link between PD and chronic occupational exposure to copper, manganese and dual combinations of copper, iron and lead, future research directions in PD occupational epidemiology, including use of biomarkers, will be discussed. 709 ASSESMENT OF HEALTH STATUS OF LEAD EXPOSED WORK? ERS IN ETHIOPIA MEHARIWAGHEGN, ALEMAYEHU ASFAW. LABOUR AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS BUREAU, ADDIS. EMail: AACHAMBERl@TELECOM.NET.ET Aim: To investigate the health effects of lead on exposed workers by determining the concentration of lead in blood (PbB) and lung function parameters in comparison to symptoms of lead poisoning. Method: A total of 63 workers from six printing and two car battery manufacturing industries with 30 comparable controls were assessed. Con? centration of lead in blood (PbB) was assayed using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer and Symptoms of lead poisoning were also assessed by administrating a questionnaire. Lung function status of workers was assessed using Vicatest pl spirometer. The parameters considered were Forced vital capacity (FVC), Forced expired volume in 1 second (FEV1), Maximum Mid-Expiratory Flow Rate at 25% and 50% (MMEFR 25% and MMEFR 50%) and ratio of FEV1 to FVC (FEV1/ FVCX100 ) and each value was expressed as a percentage of predicted value. Result: Blood lead level was high among lead exposed workers (0.60-1.00 ppm) as compared to controls (below 0.10 ppm). Poisoning symptoms were also significantly higher in the exposed workers than in controls (p&lt;0.01). PbB level was also found to be positively associated with the relevant symptoms of lead poisoning and to the length of exposure. In the case of female lead exposed workers, 66.6% of them had cases of abortion and still birth. Longer exposure was related to decay and broken of teeth. Age and height adjusted pulmonary function variables (FVC, FVC1 , MMEFR and FEV1/ FVCX100 ) for exposed and control groups has shown no significant difference (p&gt;0.05). Moreover, no association was observed between respiratory functions to the increment of PbB level. Assessment of casual factors of poisonig showed that 98 % of the workers eat and drink near and around the work place. Almost none of the workers were provided with personal protective equipment and most of them lack the knowl? edge of toxicity of lead. Conclusion: Unlike to the complain of most of workers, there was no significant relation between the lead exposure and lung function status. However, as observed from high blood lead levels and poisoning symptoms, lead exposed workers are generally suffering from health hazards emanating from their occupation. Measures that should be considered to minimize the problem are recommended. 711 CURRENT AND FUTURE POPULATION VULNERABILITY TO HEATWAVES SARI KOVATS. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. EMail: s.kovats@lshtm.ac.uk Because of the likelihood of a change in the pattern of occurrence of heatwaves under conditions of climate change, there is need to better understand the extent, and determinants, of their mortality impact. We have estimated the excess mortality associated with two major heatwaves in London, United Kingdom. Using episode analyses to describe current vulnerability to heatwaves, we compared the impact on daily mortality in England and Wales (E&amp;W) and in Greater London by age, sex and cause during a 5-day heatwave in July/August 1995 and 15-day heatwave in June/July 1976. RESULTS. An estimated 768 extra dearfis (11.2% increase) were observed during the 1995 heatwave in E&amp;W relative to equivalent period in 1993/94. From published daily mortality risk coefficients for air pollutants in London, we estimate that up to half the excess mortality during the heatwave may be attributable to coexistent increases in air pollution. In London, where daytime temperatures were higher (and with lesser falls at night), mortality increased by 23.0% during the heatwave with not more than 6% excess mortality attributable to air pollution. During the 1976 heat? wave, all-cause mortality increased by 9.7% in E&amp;W and by 15.4% in Greater London, when compared to 31-day moving average for 1976. The excess mortality is higher when compared to the average daily mortality for 1974/75/77 (16.4% in E&amp;W , 20.3% in Greater London). Excess mortality was apparent in all age groups, with the largest excess in the 85 + age group. The daily mortality excess attributable to air pollution (black smoke and ozone) for the 1976 hearwave was in the range 3.8-12.2% - again, about half of the total excess mortality during the episode. DISCUSSION: The most significant risk factor for heat-related mortality is age. Increased levels of ozone have very similar impacts to high temperatures on daily mortality and it is difficult to separate the effects of the two exposures. In borh heatwaves, excess mortality in Greater London was markedly higher than for E&amp;W as a whole. This is likely to have been due both to higher temperatures (particularly the higher night-time temperatures associated with the urban "heat island" effect) and to higher levels of air pollutants, especially ozone. These results also indicate that large urban popu? lations may be more susceptible to heatwaves (and accompanying air pollution) than the rest of the population. More generally, there is a need to describe, and explain, differences in heatwave-related mortality in varied urban populations around the world. We are currently embarking on such a study. The implica? tions of climate change and future increases in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves will be discussed.</page><page sequence="150">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S151 712 THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES ON ETHIOPIAN FARM WORKERS ALEMAYEHU ASFAW, MEKONNEN Y. occupational Safety and health division, Addis labour. EMail: aachamberl@telecom.net.et The effect of organophosphate (OP) pesticide exposure on cholinesterase (ChE) activities were assessed in relation to occupational factors by subject- ing 430 pest control workers from three state farms and 161 comparable controls. Plasma cholinesterase (PChE) and erythrocyte cholinesterase (AChE) activities were determined using electrometric method. Plasma alkaline phosphatase (AP) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were estimated colorimetrically by using diagnostic kits 6391 and 1442520 re? spectively. Information on OP poisoning symptoms and related occupational factors were collected through a questionnaire developed based on the WHO and WHO-UNDP recommendations. Pest control workers had a signifi? cantly lower PChE and AChE activities compared to the controls (p&lt;0.001); 58 (13.5%) and 47 (10.9%) of the exposed workers had PChE and AChE activities below the lower limits of the controls respectively. Normal plasma AP and GPT values without significant difference from the controls were noted. Among the exposed population, the " spray men" and those who are exposed for 5 years or below were found to be the most affected groups. Although poisoning symptoms were more frequent in the exposed workers than in the controls, only sweating was found to have accompanied by a significant reduction in AChE activities (p&lt;0.05). The study revealed that the health risks are more apparent in the exposed workers and are of immediate concern. Pre-placement and periodic medical exami? nation and creation of awareness among the exposed population are recom- mended to minimize the problem. 714 PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM AN INVESTIGATION ON PES?

EMail: rmh8@cdc.gov Preliminary Results of an Investigation on Pesticide Exposure among Chil? dren Living in Agricultural Areas along the U.S.-Mexico Border in Yuma County, Arizona. Hart R, Ortega L, Rosales C, Robertson G, Barr D, Philen R. We are conducting a cross-sectional study to test the hypothesis that children living or attending school near pesticide-treated fields have greater exposure to pesticides than children living or attending schools distant from such fields have and that this exposure differential can be measured in biological and environmental specimens. This investigation uses biological markers in children's urine samples as a measure of exposure to organophos? phate pesticides and measures a wide array of pesticides and other contam? inants in dust samples in the homes and schools of participants. The study population includes approximately 160 children between 5 and 6 years old who attended kindergarten or first grade in Yuma County or who lived in Yuma County. Each of these 160 children represent separate households. We also collected urine samples from the siblings of the primary participant who were between the ages of 3 years and 10 years. These urine samples from the siblings will be analyzed if the results of the urinary pesticide metabolite analysis of the primary participant are within the upper or lower 10 percent. We contacted potential participants and their families through a combina? tion of strategies. When a family agreed to participate and signed a consent form, a community health worker visited the family in their home to conduct a brief interview, collect the dust sample, measure the distance to the closest agricultural field, and leave a urine collection container for each child; the community health worker picked up the urine samples on the following morning. The data collection period for the interviews and bio? logical and environmental samples was from October 1999 through January 2000. Information on the location of the house, schools and closest fields to the house will be recorded using the Global Positioning System (GPS). We will discuss the study design, implementation, and preliminary results. 713 HAIR MERCURY, SERUM PCB CONCENTRATIONS, AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS IN THE OJIBWA OF THE UPPER GREAT LAKES REGION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IOHN DELLINGER, TAVRIS DALE, GERSTENBERGER SHAWN, KA? NAREK M, KMIECIK NEIL. University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. EMail: johndellinger@yahoo.com Background: Methyl mercury (Hg) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have long been known as environmental health risks due to adverse out? comes to exposures in many populations. The Ojibwa (Chippewa) people have a long tradition of both subsistence and commercial dependence upon the Great Lakes fishery. Methods: In this cross-sectional epidemiologic study, fish consumption pat? terns and medical histories were surveyed for 524 Native Americans on eight Ojibwa communities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Hair and serum were collected and analyzed for Hg (162 subjects) and PCBs (139 subjects). Results: Average annual fish consumption was 19.9 g/day when based upon source (e.g. lake, river, store) and 26.1 g/day when based upon species (e.g. walleye, lake trout, panfish). The mean serum PCB concentration was 0.68 mg/dl, with a maximum of 12.8. Hair Hg concentrations were significantly associated with panfish (R2 = 0.08, p&lt;0.005) consumption. Serum PCB concentrations were significantly associated with Lake Superior fish con? sumption (p&lt;0.005), particularly with PCB congeners 118 (R2=0.04, p&lt;0.01) and 153 (R2 = 0.13, p&lt;0.005). Using multiple logistic regression, Hg concentrations were associated with COPD (p&lt;0.01), wheezing (p&lt;0.005), phlegm (p&lt;0.005), vision problems (p&lt;0.005) shaking (p&lt;0.05), and fatigue (p&lt;0.025) after controlling for age. In the univariate analyses, serum PCB concentrations were associated with thyroid disease (p=0.02), liver disease (p=0.003), and diabetes mellitus (p=0.01). After controlling for age in the multivariate analysis, only liver disease remained significantly associated with serum PCB concentrations (p&lt;0.005). Conclusions: A moderate potential for chronic health risks associated with dietary exposures to Hg and PCBs was confirmed. Expansion of the data set and the ongoing collections of fish for persistent environmental contami? nants is warranted. A model geographic information system (GIS) mapping approach has been developed to better convey the fish contaminant infor? mation back to the tribes. 716 PARENTAL OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES TO ELECTROMAG? NETIC FIELDS AND RADIATION AND THE INCIDENCE OF NEUROBLASTOMA IN OFFSPRING ANNECLAIRE DE ROOS, OLSHAN A, TESCHKE K, SAVITZ D, POOLE C. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. EMail: aderoos@email.unc.edu We examined associations between parental occupational exposures to fields and radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum and the incidence of neuro- blastoma in offspring. Cases were 538 children under the age of 19 years with a confirmed new diagnosis of neuroblastoma between 1992 and 1994, reg? istered at participating hospitals in the United States and Canada. Age- matched controls were selected by random-digit telephone dialing. Analyses examined self-reported exposures to electrical equipment and radiation sources, self-reports reviewed by an industrial hygienist to reclassify unlikely exposures, and average exposures to extremely low frequency (ELF) mag? netic fields (MF) estimated by assigning published measurements to jobs of parents in our study. Effect estimates were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. Although elevated odds ratios were found for certain types of equipment, no consistent patterns were observed. Maternal exposure to x-ray machines was associated with a 60 percent increased incidence of neuroblastoma. Paternal exposures to battery-powered forklifts (OR=1.6; 95% O: 0.8-3.2) and high-frequency are welding equipment (OR=4.7; 95% O: 0.6-39.9) were positively associated with neuroblastoma, as were some types of equipment that emit radiofrequency radiation (ORs=2.0). Variables representing maternal and paternal exposures to the equipment grouped by the major emitted frequency (ELF, radiofrequency, ionizing) were very weakly associated with neuroblastoma (ORs 1.2-1.3). Maternal average ELF MF exposure was not associated with neuroblastoma, whereas paternal average ELF MF exposure &gt; 4.0 milligauss was associated with a sixty percent increased incidence, that was slightly diminished after adjusting for occupational chemical exposures. Overall, there was scant supportive evi? dence for associations between exposures in the electromagnetic spectrum and increased incidence of neuroblastoma in offspring. Future studies might focus on better characterization of exposure to ELF fields in different occu? pations, ELF fields in combination with high frequency fields, and radiofre? quency fields.</page><page sequence="151">S152 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 717 INDOOR AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE AND IMMUNE BIOMAR?

Nat.l Public Health Centre, Nat.l Inst. for Environmental. EMail: eerdei@mail.joboki.hu Objectives: In the frame of the Hungarian National Environmental Health Action Program (NEHAP), we conducted a cross-sectional study in six cities with different outdoor air pollution levels to determine important home environmental factors and immune biomarkers of the children suffering from respiratory problems. Methods: Study population was recruited from different schools in every city. 2788 children from the 3rd grades were invited to participate, 1768 parents filled-in-questionnaires were returned (63,4%). 580 pulmonary function measurements were performed. Blood samples were collected from those pupils (176), who had asthma or spastic bronchitis according to the parents' answer. Beside of indoor concentration of chemical pollutants (benzene, xylene, toluene, N02, formaldehyde), biological exposure (Der p I, house dust mite allergen) was assessed by monoclonal ELISA method from the children's bed as well. Immune biomarkers were determined describing humoral and cellular immunity, then effector functions (complement factor) parameters. We continued to use specific immunoglobulin isotypes (G, A, M) determinations against encapsulated bacterial airways pathogens (Hae? mophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in relation to indoor exposure factors. Results: We found statistically significant correlation between the number of the peripherial lymphocytes and benzene concentration in the child's bedroom. Indoor formaldehyde has an effect on the humoral immune response of asthmatic children as well. C3c and C4 complement factors are correlated strongly with each other, and C4 component were related to house dust mite allergen (Der p I) concentration also, however this effect does not reach statistically significant level. House dust mite abundance is obvious in the Hungarian homes, 74% of the samples showed higher con? centration of this ubiquitous indoor allergen than the WHO proposed guideline level (2 ug/g dust). Concentration ofthe specific immunoglobulin M and G against Klebsiella bacteria are associated with increased number of the lymphocytes and higher concentration of the Haemophilus IgG antibody production also. Conclusion: We concluded that chemical and biological indoor air pollution, bad housing circumstances influence asthmatic chil? dren's respiratory symptoms and their immune biomarkers in Hungary. 719 A GLOBAL APPROACH FOR RESPONDING TO HAZARDOUS WASTE HENRY FALK. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. EMail: HXF1@CDC.GOV The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is the lead U.S. public health agency for addressing the health effects of hazardous waste. The experience gained in the United States has broad application to other countries. Developing countries experience higher levels of environ? mental contamination and have fewer resources available to assess and ameliorate the problem and its human health consequences. Over the last decade, advances in technology and information resources have opened up new opportunities and expectations for addressing global pollution problems. To successfully respond to these challenges in the future, public health agencies can contribute to the development of a trained international community of environmental epidemiologists, facilitate the establishment of coalitions and partnerships with international and national agencies and nongovemmental organizations, and provide leadership in the establishment and use of surveillance data. This talk will illustrate an approach for better addressing hazardous waste issues throughout the world. 718 BORDER XXI AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH WORK? GROUP HAROLD ZENICK. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EMail: zenick- hq.hal@epa.gov The Agreement for the Protection and Improvement of the Environment (La Paz Agreement) was signed by the governments of the United States and Mexico in 1983 and provided the basis for cooperative environmental efforts between two countries. These efforts were continued with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993. The mission of the Border XXI Program, established in 1994, is to achieve a clean envi? ronment, protect public health and natural resources, and encourage sus? tainable development along the 4,000-mile border region. Nine binational Workgroups of Border XXI (Natural Resources, Air, Water, Hazardous and Solid Waste, Contingency Planning and Emergency Re? sponse, Information Resources, Pollution Prevention, Environmental Health, and Cooperative Enforcement and Compliance) integrate the efforts of participating entities and design specific projects to meet Border XXI objectives. The mission of the Environmental Health Workgroup (EHWG) is to identify and address those environmental conditions that pose the greatest risk to human health. The border region has experienced rapid increases in population and indus? trial activity without the development of adequate health care and environ? mental infrastructure. These conditions, and the resulting contamination of air, water, and soil are suspected of being factors contributing to illness and health risks in border communities. EHWG activities are being conducted in the areas of a) linking environmental exposures to health risks; b) training and education; c) environmental monitoring and assessment; and d) com? munication. To guarantee meaningful measures of success, the Border XXI Program has recognized the importance of linking environmental and health issues. The EHWG has the potential to become a forum to bring together domestic and binational activities and tie them into the other Border XXI Workgroups. To accomplish this, the EHWG is fostering better ties with the Air, Water, Information Resources, and Hazardous Waste Workgroups. 720 DIOXIN, FURANS AND PCB SERUM LEVELS AMONG INFRE- QUENT AND FREQUENT CONSUMERS OF GREAT LAKES SPORT FISH C FALK, HANRAHAN L, ANDERSON H, KANAREK M, NEEDHAM L, PATTERSON JR. D. Division of Public Health. EMail: falkcm@dhfs.state.wi.us In 1985, dioxins, furans and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were identi? fied by the Great Lakes Water Quality Board in a report to the International Joint Commission as critical pollutants in the Great Lakes (GL) ecosystem. These pollutants are toxic, persist in the environment and bioaccumulate to concentrations that can be harmful to humans. The Health Departments of five Great Lakes states: Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana, formed a consortium to study body burden levels of chemical residues in frequent and infrequent fish consumers of Lakes Michigan, Huron and Erie. Over 4200 participants, 2542 frequent GL sport fish consumers and 1664 infrequent consumers, completed a telephone interview to obtain fish con? sumption habits and demographics. Approximately 200 blood samples were analyzed for 8 dioxin, 10 furan, and 4 coplanar PCB congeners. Overall, 189 samples were analyzed, 109 from men, 80 from women, 96 and 93 from frequent and infrequent consumers respectively. All subjects median Teq dioxin sum, furan sum and coplanar sum were 15.2 (range 1.7-67.6), 6.7 (range 0.7-25.5) and 3.2 (range 0.1-66.2) respectively. Frequent consumer's median Teq dioxin sum, furan sum and coplanar PCB sum levels were 12.7 (range 4.5-52.2), 7.4 (range 2.7-25.5), and 4.3 (range 0.1-66.2) respec? tively. Infrequent consumer's median Teq dioxin sum, furan sum and copla? nar PCB sum levels were 17.2 (range 1.7-67.6), 5.5 (range 0.7-15.8) and 2.5 (range 0.2-16.3) respectively. This presentation will discuss the differences in body burden levels between frequent and infrequent consumers. It will also describe the association between GL sport fish consumption and dioxin, furans and coplanar PCBs. This research was funded by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

GRAM QUALITY ASSURANCE-QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM 1QHN RIEBOW, O'KEEFE M, GEIGER M, SCOTT J. Michigan Depart? ment of Community Health. EMail: riebowj@state.mi.us For the past eight years, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Great Lakes Human Health Effects Research Program (GLRP) has funded ten research grants in the Great Lakes basin. These grants have investigated Great Lakes fish consumption as a potential source of human exposure to environmental contaminants. The Michigan Depart? ment of Community Health (MDCH) has been awarded one of the GLRP grants for the past seven years. The primary focus of the MDCH grant has been to develop and administer a quality assurance-quality control (QA/QC) program to assess the quality of laboratory data generated under the GLRP. The QA/QC program has involved the preparation, characterization and distribution of proficiency testing samples to other Great Lakes basin laboratories that provide analyt- ical laboratory analysis of human serum specimens for the GLRP funded research grants. The data generated from the analysis of proficiency testing samples, including the laboratory procedures used by the participating lab? oratories, has served as a means of assessing comparability of the inter- laboratory data generated by the GLRP. We report here the results from the previous four rounds of proficiency testing under this program. Each round of proficiency testing samples con? sisted of ovine serum sample spiked with five individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and one chlorinated pesticide. These data indi? cate acceptable agreement among the participating laboratories. These re? sults will be discussed relative to laboratory methods, instrument calibration, PCB congener specific peak identification, limits of detection and limits of quantitation. This research was funded in part by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 724 FISH CONSUMPTION HABITS &amp; ADVISORY AWARENESS AMONG ANGLERS WHO FISH THE FOX RIVER D STEENPORT, ANDERSON H, HANRAHAN L, FALK C, DRAHEIM LAURIE, KANAREK M, NEHLS-LOWE H. Wisconsin Division of Public Health. EMail: dmsteenp@facstaff.wisc.edu Eating contaminated sport caught fish is thought to be the largest single environmental source of human exposure to PCBs. This has raised some concern about the health risk of eating particular species of fish. Research has shown that PCBs can especially be harmful to children and unbom babies. The lower Fox River is a popular fishing area for anglers and their families, but the presence of PCBs has long been a concern. The sport fishing health advisory published by the State of Wisconsin recommends which fish not to eat from the Fox River due to high PCB contamination. However, there is reason to believe that many anglers and their households, especially non-English speaking anglers, are not aware of the health risks of eating these contaminated fish. From May 1999 to October 1999 a face-to-face survey was administered to 104 anglers fishing at two different locations along the Fox River. The purpose was to characterize their fish consumption habits and their knowledge of the sport fish health advisory. Of the 104 anglers surveyed, 91 were male and 13 were female. Preliminary results indicate that 20 anglers eat some or all of the fish they catch and 84 practice "catch and release". Almost all the anglers were not familiar with the state's sport fishing health advisory but had heard of the health risks from their local newspaper and TV. As a follow-up to the survey, a sport fish health advisory brochure specific to the Fox River was developed. This research was funded by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 722 MERCURY AND FISH CONSUMPTION: IS SHE GETTING THE MESSAGE? LAURIE DRAHEIM, ANDERSON H, HANRAHAN L, FALK C, KA- NAREK M, STEENPORT D, SMITH A. Wisconsin Division of Public Health. EMail: ldraheim@facstaff.wisc.edu The Wisconsin Division of Public Health and the State of Maine Bureau of Health have collaborated on a mercury awareness project to estimate the prevalence of the mercury sport fishing advisory awareness among women of childbearing age, determine the most effective method(s) of disseminating health information to women and determine the mercury body burden level among this subpopulation. The five components to the project include focus groups, a 12-state telephone survey of 3,000 women of childbearing age, hair mercury analyses, intervention programs and follow-up telephone survey in Maine and Wisconsin to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention phase. 82-90% of respondents in the 12 states reported consuming fish during the past year. Sport fish consumption in the past year varied between 13-43%. Advisory awareness among sport fish consumers ranged from 5-43%. 415 hair samples were analyzed for mercury from women in the 12 states. A goal of the program is to develop educational materials on how to avoid and reduce exposure to mercury to be distributed to the target populations who eat sport fish. The program will utilize information gathered from the focus groups and national telephone survey to develop methods to successfully distribute advisory information to women who are not getting the message. By increasing the proportion of women who are aware of the advisory, the program will decrease mercury exposure to women of child? bearing age and their offspring. In addition, the intervention design will be shared with other states so that their advisory information will be distributed successfully to this subpopulation. This research was funded by the Environ? mental Protection Agency. 725 INFLUENCE OF FLUORIDE EXPOSURE ON REACTION TIME AND VISUOSPATIAL ORGANIZATION IN CHILDREN IAQUELINE CALDERON, MACHADO BLENDA, NAVARRO MARI- ELENA, CARRIZALES LETICIA, ORTIZ MARIA DEOGRACIAS, DIAZ-BARRIGA F. University of North Caroline. EMail: Jaqueline.Calderon@sph.unc.edu Fluoride exposure is an important public health problem in several Mexican states. In the city of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, above 90% of the children have some degree of dental fluorosis. The main source of exposure to fluoride is tap water. The objective of the study was to evaluate the influence of chronic exposure to fluoride on neuropsychological development in chil? dren. Sixty-one children aged 6 to 8 years were included. Fluoride concen? trations in tap water ranged from 1.2 to 3 mg/L. Fluoride exposure was measured in urine samples by electrothermal ion selective method. Blood lead (PbB) was measured as indicator of lead exposure by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Height for age index (HAI) was calculated as indicator of past nutritional status. Three test were used to evaluate the neuropsycho? logical development: (1) Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Revised version for Mexico (WISC-RM), (2) Rey Osterreith-Complex Figure test and (3) Continuos Performance Test (CPT). Mean value of fluoride in urine was 4.3 mgF/g creatinine (1.6-10.8). Mean PbB value was 6.2 ug/dl(2.0- 15.6). After controlling by significant confounders, urinary fluoride corre? lated positively with reaction time and inversely with the scores in visuo- spatial organization. IQ scores were not influenced by fluoride exposure. An increase in reaction time could affect the attention process, also the low scores in visuospatial organization could be affecting the reading and writing abilities in these children.</page><page sequence="153">S154 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 726 GREAT LAKES CONTAMINANTS AND COGNITIVE DEVELOP? MENT IN CHILDREN PAUL STEWART, DARVILL T, LONKY E, REIHMAN J, PAGANO J. SUNY Oswego. EMail: pstewarl@oswegu.edu The persistence of organochlorine contaminants in the Great Lakes basin, including PCBs and organochlorine insecticides, indicates that low-level human exposures to these chemicals will continue for years to come. An important question is whether the developing nervous system is sensitive to current levels of the contaminants. During the 1980's and 1990's, a series of reports from Jacobson and colleagues suggested that prenatal exposure to low levels of PCBs impaired cognitive development in children, with small but significant memory and IQ deficits persisting well into the school age years. Current data from New York State have replicated some the Jacobson results. Initiated in New York more than 10 years after the Jacobson work started, the Oswego Newborn and Infant Development Project has tracked the cognitive and behavioral development of nearly 300 children from birth to the present day. Many of these children were prenatally exposed to low levels of PCBs through maternal consumption of PCB-contaminated Great Lakes Fish. Cord blood PCB levels,obtained at the birth of the each child, have been predictive of small but statistically significant neurobehavioral chsmges immediately after birth (Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS)), and on later cognitive assessments. These include perfor? mance decrements on the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence at 1 year of age, and the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities at 3 years of age. These associations are significant after control for a wide range of potentially confounding variables, such as SES, alcohol use, smoking and maternal education. The long-term significance of the associations, however, is not yet clear. Data from adult animals exposed in utero to Great Lakes contam? inants at the Oswego laboratory may help address this issue. Both the sets of data will be discussed in the context of the existing literature to help address the question of central nervous system effects of Great Lakes contaminants.

Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki. EMail: helena.mussalo-rauhamaa@helsinki.fi In Finland, there are an increasing number of building related discomfort complaints. Indoor Air Clinic was established in 1995 at the Helsinki University Central Hospital to examine persons who are suspected to have indoor-air-related health symptoms. For this study 80 subjects were selected from the patients of this clinic by the inspector of the clinic and the stuff physician on the basis of odor findings at homes. Selected patients medical examination comprised, e.g., clinical status examination, pulmonary func? tion tests, and skin prick tests to common allergens, some of which are building material related. Indoor climate and quality measurements were carried out at home of each patient. In order to collect essential background information, the subjects and their family members filled in a modified questionnaire about their complaints and somatic symptoms, and residential conditions and any related problems, e.g. odor annoyances. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and also aldehydes and ammonia measurements were carried out by Technical Research Centre of Finland. The VOCs were collected on Tenax TA and Tenax GR from indoor air and VOCs were thermally desorbed from sampling tubes into a GC/MS system. Different chemical groups as terpenes, carbonyl compounds, aromatics and specific material based compounds were dominant in homes investigated. Additionally some compounds known to originate from microbial growth in homes were recognized. Symptoms, disorders and clinical findings of the occupants and their connection to indoor air exposure will be reported. 727 DIETARY EXPOSURE TO PCBS AMONG MOHAWK WOMEN AT AKWESASNE E FITZGERALD, HWANG SA, LANGGUTH K, YANG B, LAUZON T, WORSWICK P. NYS Department of Health. EMail: eff02@health.state.ny.us As part of an ongoing epidemiological surveillance of exposure to polychlo? rinated biphenyls (PCBs) from a nearby Superfund site, a study was con? ducted of pregnant Mohawk women at Akwesasne, a Native American community along the St. Lawrence River. From 1992 to 1995, 111 women were interviewed, and each donated a 20- ml venous blood sample for serum PCB determinations. Fish, ambient air, and residential surface soil samples were also obtained, and dietary, residential, and occupational pathways were evaluated. Consumption rates of local fish declined from a mean of 31.3 meals per year two or more years before pregnancy to an annual mean of 11.7 meals during pregnancy (p = 0.002). This change is probably the conse- quence of local advisories against the consumption of local fish by pregnant women, since 90% of the women were aware of the advisories and 40% changed their fish consumption patterns as a result. Consistent with their low current rate of local fish consumption, 41% had a serum total PCB concentration below the detection limit of 1 ppb. The maximum serum Level was 7.8 ppb, and the geometric mean was 1.2 ppb. Multiple regression analysis revealed that serum total PCB levels increased with age (p &lt; 0.001) and cumulative lifetime PCB exposure from local fish consumption (p = 0.05). Local fish consumption was also significantly related to serum levels of three individual PCB congeners: 1) IUPAC # 74+ 94; 2) IUPAC # 99; and 3) IUPAC #118. All three are found in samples of contaminated local fish. Serum total PCB concentrations were not related to residential soil and ambient air PCB levels, and no women was considered by an industrial hygienist to have had a job that entailed occupational exposure to PCBs. The data suggest that local fish consumption has contributed to body burdens in this population and that the advisories have been effective in modifying fish consumption habits over time. This research was supported in part by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 731 THE NRC'S REPORT ON THE OCEAN'S ROLE IN HUMAN HEALTH: THE CHALLENGE TO ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMI?

Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. EMail: heh2@cdc.gov The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Great Lakes Human Health Effects Research Program (GLHHERP) was created by an amendment to the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990. The Congressionally mandated program is designed to characterize exposure and investigate the potential for short- and long-term adverse health effects to persistent toxic substances (PTSs) in the Great Lakes basin via fish con? sumption. These substances include chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, furans, mirex, dieldrin, dichlorodiphenyl trichlo- roethane (DDT), toxaphene, methylmercury, and alkylated lead . The at-risk populations being investigated in this program include sport anglers, Native Americans, pregnant women, fetuses and nursing infants of mothers who consume contaminated Great Lakes fish, young children, the elderly, and the urban poor. Significant key research findings have been reported in the last 4 years which include: (1) at-risk populations continue to be exposed to PTSs; (2) fish consumption appears to be the major pathway of exposure to PTSs; (3) a significant trend of increasing body burden of PTSs is associated with increased fish consumption; (4) body burden levels of some PTSs are 2 to 4 times greater than in the general U.S. population; (5) men and women consume Great Lakes fish during most of their reproductive years; (6) exposure to Great Lakes PTSs may cause disturbances in repro? ductive parameters; and (7) newborns of mothers who consumed contami? nated Great Lakes fish exhibited neurobehavioral and developmental defi? cits and these effects are still present at 3 years of age. These studies will be described and the public health implications of these findings discussed. The research findings from these studies indicate the need for greater health education, and preventive measures to interdict exposures, and mitigate toxicity not only in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River basins but in other ecosystems with similar pollution problems. 734 ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY TRAINING AND RE?

Education of fundamentals of environmental epidemiology is provided within 3 weeks course (75 teaching hours) devoted to hygiene and epidemiology (environmental medicine in "western" concept) aimed at the primary prevention in the protection of the population and individual's health. Teaching is done in the 5th study year in form of a three-week-block affiliation ending with the State Exam. Roughly 1/4 of the 75 teaching hours is devoted to environmental epidemiology related basics. 733 PCB BLOOD LEVELS IN PREGNANT AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WHO CONSUME GREAT LAKES FISH DONALD WALLER, KATZEN R, WICKS C, HIBBARD J.. University of Illinois at Chicago. EMail: dpwaller@uic.edu The presence of PCB's and other environmental pollutants in Great Lakes fish places individuals who consume large amounts of fish at risk of exposure to these pollutants. Urban populations adjacent to Lake Michigan utilize these waters as an inexpensive and accessible source of fish for consumption. Several cohorts have been studied in the past which indicate higher levels of PCB' are observed in populations who consume large amounts of Great Lakes fish. In this study, pregnant urban African American women who regularly consumed fish obtained from Lake Michigan or its surrounding waters were identified and completed a questionnaire and interview to provide information on demographic, environment, diet and occupation histories. Maternal blood and cord blood were collected at the time of delivery and a GC analytical procedure performed to analyze the concen? trations of 20 PCB congeners and DDE in the maternal and cord blood. Placenta and meconium were also collected. Clinical parameters for subjects were also obtained including, hematocrit, hemoglobin, albumin, cholesterol, G-6PD, cholesterol, triglycerides, weeks of gestation, baby's weight, baby's length, head circumference, and Apgars. The demographic character in? cluded a majority with incomes less than $15,500, less than 26 years old and a household with one adult. A variety of fish were consumed including catfish, perch and buffalo fish. The levels of the PCB' congeners were similar to those obtained in other cohort studies, however, the presence of some PCB's at the limits of sensitivity occur in a greater frequency in subjects who consume large amounts of Great Lakes fish. No differences between fish eating groups were observed for the clinical parameters. The relationship between PCB levels and other confounders is also being evaluated, with particular attention being focused on residence location. This cohort is providing important information regarding the levels of PCB's in an urban African American population and potential links to exposures related to fish consumption, occupation and environmental factors. 735 ROUDTABLE DISCUSSION: METHODOLOGIC ISSUES IN STUDYING GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS IN CAN?

In addition, we will discuss constructing a framework for examining and weighing ethical considerations inherent in studies utilizing biological exposure measure? ments and/or genetic markers.</page><page sequence="155">S156 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 736 SERUM PCDDS, PCDFS, AND COPLANAR PCBS IN CONSUM? ERS AND NON-CONSUMERS OF LAKE ONTARIO FISH IAMES OLSON, STEPHEN F, GREIZERSTEIN H, KOSTYNIAK P, SWANSON M, VENA J. UB. EMail: jolson@buffalo.edu Consumption of fish from Lake Ontario represents a potential source of excess exposure to persistent halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs), including dioxin-like polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzo? furans (PCDFs), and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Dioxin- like HAHs have a common aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediated mechanism of action and elicit a common range of potential adverse effects, including, cancer promotion, immune suppression, endocrine disruption, and reproductive and developmental toxicity. This study was designed to assess exposure to dioxin-like HAHs in anglers that consume Lake Ontario fish (consumers, n = 27) and an age and gender matched control group (non-consumers, n = 16) with no history of consumption of Lake Ontario fish. These subjects are a subset of the New York State Angler Cohort (NYSAC) study which is an ongoing investigation of fishing license holders from 18 to 40 years of age (in 1991) in the 16 upstate NY counties within close proximity to Lake Ontario. Since these congeners are highly persistent and lipophilic, analysis of serum lipids by high resolution GC-MS provides an estimate of cumulative past exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD), the most potent HAHs, was detected at levels from &lt; 0.8 to 2.2 (ppt, pg/g, lipid adjusted) in non-consumers and at levels from 1.2 to 3.7 ppt in the serum lipids of consumers. 3,3',4,4',5-PentaCB (PCB 126), the most potent PCB, was detected in serum at levels ranging from 3.4 to 45.5 ppt in non-consumers and at levels from 4.2 to 151.0 ppt in consumers. In addition to these congeners, the mean serum levels of 1,2,3,7,8-PCDD, 1,2,3,7,8-PCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-PCDF, and 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexaCB (PCB 169) were significantly elevated in the serum of consumers. These results indicate that the con? sumption of Lake Ontario fish is associated with excess exposure to dioxin- like HAHs, but represents only one of many sources of human exposure to these environmental contaminants.

Department of Geography, University at Buffalo. EMail: lbian@geog.buffalo.edu The present project is intended to apply the spatial object and field concepts in geographic information science to modeling people-environment inter? actions in the context of epidemiology. These interactions include those between individual people, between groups of people, and between people and the environment. The research objective is (1) to design a modeling tool that can support the simulation of the interactions and (2) implement the tool with the component-ware technique so that the tool can be integrated easily with other tools in a distributed and interoperable computing envi? ronment. Three specific tasks are conducted to accomplish the aforementioned objec? tives. (1) The development of a conceptual framework for the modeling of people-environment interactions. Based on the epidemiology literature, the spatial objects and fields are identified to represent individual people, groups of people, and the environment. In addition, the conceptual model of the interactions between people, groups, and the environment is established in order to provide a guideline for the subsequent design and implementation of the modeling tool. (2) The development of design principles of components. Components are software entities that share common interfaces to allow easy communication and combination between data and GIS functionality. While technical standard has been published for the development of software components, little is studied of the semantic design of components. In the present project, components are identified according to conceptual models of spatial objects and fields, the type of interactions between them, and functionality neces? sary to support the modeling of these interactions. (3) The technical implementation of the tool. The GIS tool MapObjects and object-oriented programming language C+ + are used to implement the semantic components into software components. The implementation fol? lows the standard specification posed in DCOM (Distributed Common Objects Model). 737 GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OF RATES OF LATE STAGE COLO?

AARON COHEN, M. HEI. EMail: acohen@healtheffects.org This symposium deals with the modem applications of case-crossover design in epidemiologic investigations with special emphasis on environmental situations. The case-crossover design represents an attractive approach to examine the impact of time-varying exposures that may trigger adverse health events. Current studies involving air pollution and reproductive health will be featured in this discussion. 742 ACUTE EFFECTS OF CONSUMPTION OF PCB CONTAMINATED SPORT FISH FROM LAKE ONTARIO ON FECUNDABILITY: A PROSPECTIVE CROSS-OVER DESIGN ENRIQUE SCHISTERMAN, BUCK G, WEINER J, MCGUINNESS B, VENA J. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. EMail: schistermane@cshc.org Women who consume PCB contaminated sport fish from Lake Ontario are reported to have reduced fecundability in comparison to women who do not eat fish. Serum PCB levels initially rise then fall to baseline following ingestion of contaminated fish meals in humans, raising concern about the potential "acute" effects of fish consumption on human fecundity. Utilizing a prospective pregnancy study comprising 90 women discontinuing birth control to become pregnant and who completed daily diaries on fish consumption and other lifestyle factors, we employed a case cross-over design to determine whether fish consumption during the "fertile" period reduced the risk ratio of fecundity among women who became pregnant, regardless of outcome, and who contributed consumption data for 1 + months (n=60). Ovulation was based entirely on diary data and uniformly said to occur 14 days before the onset of the next menstrual period. A menstrual cycle was determined to be at risk if the woman had vaginal-penile intercourse 1 + times during the fertile period, i.e., 5 days up to and including the day of ovulation. Time periods are classified as controls if pregnancy did not occur in that cycle and case if pregnancy did occur. Fish consumption was characterized by self-reported consumption of 1 + fish meals during the fertile period. In the case-crossover design, the varying numbers of risk cycles per woman are taken into account and linked to the occurrence of preg? nancy. The optimal duration of the effect period was empirically determined to be consumption of sport fish 5 days up to and including the day of ovulation. Conditional logistic regression was utilized to estimate the fecundability risk ratio (FRR). No reduction in fecundity was seen for "acute" fish consump? tion (FRR=1.93; 95% confidence interval 0.52-7.14). Our results are lim? ited by small sample sizes and a crude measure of ovulation. The feasibility and utility of the case crossover design for reproductive studies of environ? mental exposures will be discussed further. 741 PROMISING NEW METHODS FOR COLLECTING, MANAGING AND ANALYZING DATA FOR REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVEL? OPMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY. G BUCK. University at Buffalo. EMail: gbuck@buffalo.edu Epidemiologists engaged in the study of reproductive and developmental processes and outcomes face unique challenges in designing, conducting and analyzing such studies, given the many unique characteristics underlying human reproduction. Some examples of these challenges include the couple- dependent nature of human reproduction, the type and timing of parental exposures, population and individual forces that modify fecundity and fer? tility, and the interrelatedness of outcomes. Technologic advances in the assessment of exposures and outcomes and novel tools in medical informatics offer epidemiologists new approaches for planning and conducting research. The young distribution of study participants in reproductive epidemiology is an added strength for these web based methodologies for conducting re? search, since many participants will have computer skills. This talk will present an overview of web-based approaches for data collection and man? agement as well as the feasibility and utility of newer designs (e.g., case- crossover) and statistical approaches (Bayesian) for reproductive epidemiol? ogy- 743 WRAP UP - WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

Dept Epidemiology, UNC-Chapel Hill. EMail: ihp@unc.edu The goal of this symposium is to provide both an overview and some concrete examples of the application of epidemiologic research to quantita? tive risk or health impact assessment. Risk or health impact assessment attempts to quantify the projected burden of morbidity or mortality from a specific exposure scenario. To do so, collaboration is needed with exposure assessors to determine the environmental exposure, including probable routes and quantified levels for the specified population A dose-response relationship or an explicit threshold assumption is developed, based on existing data. Finally, the projected risk for the population is characterized. The results of such quantitative assessments are used by regulatory bodies to guide their actions. As such, risk/health impact assessment serves as a critical link between research and policy. Speakers will discuss specific examples, highlighting the approaches used. Speakers and topics include will include: Michal Krzyzanowski presenting "Epidemiology in assessment of health impacts of air pollution in Europe;" Allan H. Smith whose title is "Health risk assessment for arsenic in drinking water;" Irva Hertz-Picciotto, discuss- ing "The use of epidemiologic data on mixtures to assess the carcinogenic potency of individual compounds." 745 HEALTH EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO MYCOTOXINS RUTH ETZEL, HOFMEISTER V, MISSMER S, HERR C, KU C.

NYS Dept of Health. EMail: eff02@health.state.ny.us Billions of dollars have been spent remediating and managing hazardous waste in the U.S. alone, but questions persist about the risks posed to human health by the continuing presence of hazardous substances in the environ? ment. These questions pose unique methodologic challenges to epidemiol? ogists because of the number of people exposed to hazardous substances around any particular source tends to be small, environmental exposures may be difficult to assess, and health effects may not be apparent for several years. In addition, the needs of the communities exposed to hazardous substances go beyond the research questions posed by epidemiologic studies. The speakers at this session will describe innovative approaches that have been applied to address these challenges and present important new research findings related to exposure to chemicals frequently encountered at hazard? ous waste sites. The session will be of interest not only to environmental epidemiologists and other researchers but also to government agencies in? volved in policy making.</page><page sequence="159">S160 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 753 HEALTH EFFECTS OF THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENT - SYMPOSIUM OVERVIEW K MOYSICH, MICHALEK ARTHUR.

OLOGIC STUDIES IOHN SCHUSTER, WEINER J, VENA J, BUCK G, MCGUINNESS B, SWANSON M. SPM. EMail: weiner@buffnet.net The New York State Angler Cohort Study (NYSACS) involves a large number of disciplines in studying the possible relations between social and occupational behaviors and experiences, medical history, aromatic hydro- carbons, pesticides, heavy metals and health effects. The prominent out? comes presently under investigation include fecundity, fertility, develop? mental delays, learning disabilities, and child behavior. This report describes a data management approach (i.e., the Data Base Repository System [DBR]) that replaces traditional information processing typically used in epidemio? logic studies. The new process involves state-of-the-art web technologies and innovative database structures. The system provides the investigator with the necessary control and supervisory enhancements without requiring knowledge of modern computer science techniques. The investigator can focus on the science associated with the construction of the data collection instruments to be employed. That process coupled with uniquely designed administrative software yields a complete, web-based data management operation in what appears to be an automatic fashion. The DBR system offers complete flexibility in use of different numeric entry options. It provides reusable question sets so that established and valid questions may be replicated from study to study. It provides a mechanism for local control (via workstation-based client software) in design and web-based control (via web-based client software) of the study under conduct. Finally, it enables extensive use of quality control and security features to ensure proper conduct of sophisticated and complex studies. The use of the worldwide web enables access to the research data (under strict controls) from any where at any time thus enhancing conduct and management of multi-site, multidis? ciplinary epidemiologic investigations. 754 CIVIL UNREST, WAR, AND OTHER COMPLEX EMERGENCIES: AN EMERGING AGENDA FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH B MOSCATO, WINKELSTEIN JR. W. SPM. EMail: bmoscatc@acsu.biifralo.edu Complex emergencies represent urgent environmental and public health problems for the next millennium. These "man-made humanitarian emer? gencies" may be manifested by diverse activities ranging from collective overt discrimination and community riots to systematic torture, armed conflict, and war. While the holocaust remains as a most extreme example of genocide during this century, more recent events in Los Angeles, Rwanda, Sudan, Somalia, Rwanda, Belfast, Bosnia, Chiapas, Kosovo, and East Timor, serve as poignant and diverse examples of the more than 38 major complex emergencies that have occurred in this decade. Increased mortality and morbidity were associated with each of these cited episodes. During the 1990's, at least four million people have been killed in violent conflicts. By the late 1990's, the United Nations estimated that there were over 35 million refugees and internally displaced persons around the world. While there has been considerable development in the study of complex emergencies in the past few years, many environmental health parameters have not been assessed and many parts of the world have not been studied systematically. There is a need for long-term environmental studies on the adverse effects of complex emergencies on both human and natural re? sources. Raising awareness of major complex emergencies represents an essential first step in the development of an epidemiologic research and action agenda. This symposium expands upon the framework established to address humani? tarian emergencies during last year's ISEE/ISEA meeting in Athens, Greece. Invited speakers, D Guha-Sapir (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, Brussels, Belgium) and R Fehr (Department of Environmental Health, Bielefeld, Germany) will provide a policy review of field evidence on environ? mental conflicts. The environmental and public health consequences of com? plex emergencies will include the mental health sequelae of mass violence as summarized by RF Mollica (Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US). Varied presentations by invited speakers will be followed by a panel discussion addressing complex emergencies and the role of environmen? tal epidemiology. Suggestions for a research and action agenda for epidemiolo? gists include, but are not limited to: 1) the collection of epidemiologic data documenting long-term sequelae of complex emergencies, 2) the need for continued formulation of theoretical frameworks regarding civil unrest within a public health perspective, and, 3) active development of multidisciplinary contributions (e.g., sociologists, political scientists, policy analysts). Finally, identification of gaps in existing strategies will be assessed. Such agenda may provide the groundwork for effective and urgent intervention, prevention, and policy-making strategies related to complex emergencies, where formulation of both short- and long-term policies is imperative. 756 ISEE2000 SYSTEM - A WEB-BASED COMMUNICATION AND DATABASE MANAGEMENT APPROACH FOR CONDUCT OF SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCES IOHN SCHUSTER, WEINER J, VENA J. SPM. EMail: weiner@buffnet.net The ISEE2000 Conference held in Buffalo, New York employed a web-based communication and management system in dealing with the acquisition of participant registration, author registration, abstract acquisition, review of abstracts, construction of the agenda and communication of conference information throughout. The system employed a public web address - http://phoenixworkgroup.com/isee2000 - and two administrative web ad- dresses. One for system administrators - http://phoenixworkgroup.com/ad- minlogin.asp - and one for scientific reviewers - http://phoenixworkgroup- .com/rvwlogin.asp . The security attached to each was appropriate for the information being processed. In addition, additional system management functions were enabled using a workstation-based client program interacting with the web-based server. This combination of computer techniques rep? resents a modern approach to management of complex problems requiring investigator control and supervision of the design and conduct processes. The local client software was primarily employed at the outset in establishing the site and fine tuning its operation. The web control was employed in managing the dynamically acquired information and in communicating with the conference leadership and participants. The active, server-oriented da? tabase management process offered complete and current information en- abling the geographically dispersed managers of the system to be aware of and effect changes as required in an instantaneous fashion. This conference was presumably the first epidemiologically oriented one to be managed using this web-based approach. Over 100 countries are represented in the confer? ence. Over 750 abstracts were entered via the web-based portal and more than 90% of the participants were able to perform the required data entry functions (registration and abstract submission) without difficulty. The inherent capability of the web to connect with a variety of different local computers and systems has been dramatically illustrated by this example. Perhaps, of greater importance was the realization of the theme of the conference, namely, the web-based system was effective in bringing the worldwide assembly of investigators in environment health closer together.</page><page sequence="160">Epidemiology July 2000, Volume 11 Number 4 Supplement 2000 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ISEE S161 757 SIMPLIFIED SURVEY SYSTEM (S3) - A WEB-BASED DATABASE MANAGEMENT APPROACH FOR MODERN EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES 1QHN SCHUSTER, WEINER J, VENA J, BUCK G. SPM. University at Buffalo. EMail: weiner@buffnet.net This report describes a web-based data collection system designed to enable the participant to provide the epidemiologic information via a web-based process. This self-administered questionnaire using computer entry via the web imposes some restrictions on the form of the data collection instrument. Clearly, it must be simple and intuitive in its presentation so that the most inexperienced respondent will not require a long learning curve in order to perform the required functions. The questions and acceptable answers must be structured so that the respondent can find an acceptable answer easily from those offered. The response mechanism must be simple and interactive (i.e., the computer must show a response to each act by the respondent.). A data management approach (the Simplified Survey System [S3]) is de? scribed. This system replaces the paper version of the self-administered questionnaire with a web entry version. Further, the traditional information processing methodology used in epidemiologic studies is replaced by the automatic system similar to that used in the DBR (Data Base Repository System). The new approach is comparable to the DBR in utilizing state-of- the-art web technologies and innovative database structures. In terms of modern computer approaches, the S3 system offers design and web-based control (via web-based client software) of the study under conduct. With web-based control throughout, the S3 system is more amenable to the varied short-term and less complex needs inherent in many aspects of data collec? tion. The S3 system enables extensive use of quality control and security features to ensure proper conduct. As with the DBR system, the use of the worldwide web enables access to the research data (under strict controls) from anywhere at any time thus enhancing conduct and management of multi-site, multidisciplinary prospective epidemiologic investigations. 760 SYMPOSIUM OVERVIEW-PESTICIDES, INDIANS, AND ARTI? FACTS DAVID GOLDSMITH. Department of Environmental &amp; Occupational Health, The George Washington University. Email: eohdfg@mail.gwumc.edu Background: In the U.S. repatriation of Indian ceremonial artifacts from public and private collections has begun. Ceremonial objects have been preserved with pesticides, fungicides, and antimicrobial agents, including arsenic, mercuric chloride, DDT, strychnine, tobacco, and naphthaiene. Indian communities are concemed about the safety and health of handling these objects (especially risks to native children and elders); and museum staff and scientists seek guidance about workplace toxicity and prevention. Purposes: This session is designed to introduce this issue to international environmental and occupational health researchers.
