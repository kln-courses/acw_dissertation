<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SACRAMENTAL THOUGHT IN VONDEL'S DRAMA In Vondel's twenty-four original plays and seven translations there seems to be little evidence of a development towards any particular end or any co-ordination round one central problem. But since we have abundant evidence from Vondel himself' that he was by nature an allegorist, it is clear that a superficial glance at the material of his plays will reveal little of the underlying thought. Though the subjects range in time from the Creation to his own day, and in space from the Heavenly Kingdom to a Chinese city and from the upper universe to an imaginary realm on earth, yet if the plays are read in the spirit in which Vondel wrote them, the restrictions of time and place will not obscure the allegorical, symbolic or even sacramental meaning of any play. A tragedy with a contemporary subject may be the point at which an eternal truth comes to light. Similarly, biblical, historical or mythical characters may be the shadows cast by people of Vondel's day. Just as all colours have one source, so too the whole gamut of Vondel's themes, divers and incongruous as they may seem, have one common origin and together form one central theme: Vondel's experience of reality. Vondel's early plays are in themselves clear allegories. The Spanish war was the temporal event which reminded Vondel of the eternal nature of the Redemption, which being beyond time, could equally well be allegorized by the deliverance of Israel from Egypt in Het Pascha. Even as Josua suffering oppression from Pharao had acknowledged Dat Godt nu zyn belofte in ons niet en vervult Daer zijn wy oirzaeck van om onzer zonden schuldt2 so Vondel saw the destruction about him as God's judgment on those who were as faithless as the inhabitants of Hierusalem Verwoest, his next play. Palamedes, inspired by the death of Oldenbarnevelt, is the most clearly allegorical of all Vondel's plays and is so obviously an occasional piece that no deeper significance need be sought in it. Gijsbreght van Aemstel was similarly an occasional piece (for the opening of the new theatre at Amsterdam), but the occasion imposed only a superficial restriction on Vondel's choice of theme, and there is more than a Vergilian glorification of Amsterdam in it. Why did Vondel think of Troy? Was it only Vergil's and Seneca's artistic genius that won his admiration for the Aeneid and Troades, or was there a correspondence between his thought and the themes of these two works? The fundamentally important addition made by Vondel to his model is that Amsterdam, unlike Troy, is only destroyed as a necessary condition of rebirth. The cycle of thought, which began with the Redemption-typology in Het Pascha, that good may come of evil,3 was continued in Hierusalem Verwoest, where the wages of sin is death, and is completed in Gijsbreght van Aemstel where just retribution is meted out to sinners, whose faith and virtue however have their reward in Rafael's prophesy by which glory shall be reborn out of the ashes of a sinful past, 1 In his prefaces. See J. Koopmans, Vondel als Christen Symbolist (Amsterdam, 1906), p. 190. 2 Het Pascha, 11. 357-8 3 "t quaet...den goeden streckt tot heil, den quaede tzynder straffen' (11. 515-16).</page><page sequence="2">204 The Sacramental Thought in Vondel's Drama In Gijsbreght van Aemstel a second 'leitmotif' is apparent which links it with Hippolytus, one of the translations of this period. Of these translations De Amsteldamsche Hekuba, Hippolytus and Josef of Sophompaneas, only the first seems to reflect Vondel's early root-Idea. The trans- lation of Sophompaneas was of course motivated by Vondel's admiration for Grotius, and though its later association with Joseph in Egypten was to bring it into close kinship with Hippolytus, the two translations can have had no mutual connection at that time. Hippolytus however, introduces a fresh motif, of love and lust, which will frequently recur in later plays, and this suggests that Vondel chose this play for its theme as well as its artistic merits. Vondel was very happily married and Badeloch alone is convincing witness of this, for she is a creation from Vondel's heart, not a recreation of Dido or Hecuba. In Hippolytus unrestrained erotic love clashes with absolute chastity, in Gijsbreght van Aemstel the conflict arises of valour against virtue, of duty against marital love, and this conflict can only be resolved by the deus ex machina Rafael. Widely divergent views are held about Vondel's change of loyalty from the Latin dramatists to the Greek, and from a Protestant faith to Roman Catholicism, and the influence this had on his more mature drama. But Verhagen's opinion, diametrically opposed to Barnouw's,1 that Vondel's drama, modelled on the Greek, reveals deep personal conflicts,2 has much to support it. In the early plays the simple allegory ministers to the needs of the world about him. There is little evidence of the tragedy of one man, and the conflict rages on the battle-field, not in the realms of the heart or soul. There is indeed a trend towards the refinement of the personal conflict in the last play of this early group, where Gijsbreght, leader of the forces fighting against treachery, is also the embodiment of virtue striving against temptation within himself. The allegory will become less clearly defined as Vondel's artistry improves and as, with increasing experience of life, his understanding matures to greater and greater depth. But allegory3 remained the principle of Vondel's art. It provided the safe cloak for anonymity for his most intimate spiritual experiences, and he had a higher purpose in this than concealing his own feelings, for as he learned the answer to his problems, he also experienced the essence of reality, and this microcosmic revelation had a macrocosmic significance belonging to eternity and infinity. This means that the immediate or moral allegories (where they exist) will become less important than the hidden allegory containing the inner truth. The adoption of the Greek dramatic form, complete with its unities and the unrealistic presence of the chorus throughout, baffles us unless we realize the necessity of such a medium for conveying something of the essence of absolute reality rather than material realism. 'He did not aim at creating an imitation of a real world, for that which he dramatized was to him not reality itself but an allegory of the real.'4 Elektra, Vondel's first translation from the Greek, furnishes little evidence of anagogical allegory, though its tragic theme is similar to that of Hippolytus-in 1 In Vondel (New York, 1925), p. 124. 2 'Vondels Dramatische Problemen', Vondelkroniek, Ile Jrg. (1940), 86 ff. 3 This word has such a diversity of meanings today, that I use it here and elsewhere in the richest sense it has ever had, in medieval and renaissance times. For this reason Dante may well be considered the highest authority and his definition of the word, given in his letter to Can Grande della Scala, is used'here. 4 A. J. Barnouw, loc. cit. pp. 133-4.</page><page sequence="3">both a son suffers for the sin of lust in his mother. Without unduly stressing the theme of true and perverted love in the translations since it would be difficult to find an ancient myth in which this theme did not figure, we shall see that there are already in Hippolytus, Gijsbreght van Aemstel and Elektra signs of the clash of sexual passions which is a recurrent theme in Vondel's later drama. As if to emphasize the growing importance of the love-motif, Maeghden, written in the same year as Elektra, introduces a secondary tragic conflict of lust against continence which even overshadows the original intention of the play by which the martyrdom of Ursul would have been the central theme.l This play, though dramatically uncoordinated, is of particular interest as demonstrating Vondel's drift towards the personal conflict as the focal point of all tragedy. There are three aspects to the play: the purely extraneous homage paid to Cologne, the allegory of all martyrdoms as human adumbrations of the sacrifice of Perfect Man, and Attila's inward con- flict between his feelings for Ursul and his duty as leader of the Hun army. Lust and violence are ranged against saintly purity; the allegory is still too clearly defined by Vondel as he passes from the early plays, moralizing on the world situation, to his next play Gebroeders, where the tragedy of a purely spiritual con- flict needs no didactic allegory to point its moral. This difference between conscious and unconscious allegory in Vondel is a peculiarity of the great Christian poets.2 David in Gebroeders is faced with the dilemma of his duty to his country con- flicting with the feelings of his heart. The sufferings of his people are clearly caused by the sin of their previous ruler, and justice demands that wrongdoing be expiated either by the repentance of the sinner or the suffering of innocent people on his behalf. Only when David understands this inalienable working of justice can he see t.lat the few must suffer that the rest may be saved. Though the seven 'brothers were not David's sons, it is clear from Vondel's preface, in which David is likened to Abraham, that Vondel felt the closeness of the family ties linking David to the victims. This brings the thought in Gebroeders into close relationship with Gijsbreght van Aemstel. Here is further evidence of Vondel's growing depth of thought. Up till now the state and patriotism have been important though external aspects of the Idea: Holland's resistance to the King of Spain, the destruction of his home- land by war, Sophompaneas the perfect statesman, Palamedes the perfect patriot, the glory of Amsterdam defended by Gijsbreght's heroism, and Maeghden dedicated to Agrippine, his birth-place Cologne. After Gebroeders the state ceases to figure in Vondel's Idea, for although Vondel remained a conscientious patriot (as Batavische Gebroeders shows), patriotism was not a deeper spiritual experience and had no further part in his search for Reality. Underlying the political justice in the play (and therefore of greater importance to the apprehension of Vondel's Idea), is the thought that Man's sin (in Saul) required the blood of the innocent Son of Man (in the 'brothers').3 Similarly, though no typological parallel between Joseph in Joseph in Dothan and Christ is stated anywhere in the play or preface,4 the likeness in Vondel's 1 B. Verhagen, loc. cit. p. 95. 2 W. Kramer, 'Vondel's Lucifer', Nieuwe Taalgids, Jrg. 34, pt. v, p. 203. 3 See Dedicatory Epistle to Koning David Hersteld, Gebroeders, 11. 1171-7 and its Berecht. The typology is only vaguely suggested by the context of Gebroeders among the other plays. Specific references are entirely lacking. 4 Though 11. 15-26, 545-50 are indications of the parallel far clearer than anything in Gebroeders. 205 PETER KING</page><page sequence="4">206 The Sacramental Thought in Vondel's Drama treatment is nowhere mistakable. If, instead of reading the play only as far as the interpretation of Joseph as the prototype of Christ, we abandon our intellect and follow our intuition further, we shall share Vondel's experience of the relationship of Man to God in the tragic paradox of Juda, Ruben and Levi, all sons of one Father, planning to kill their own brother, the son of the Father, who was raised to glory, not however without causing the Father acute anguish at the news of the death of his son. Juda's sin is Vondel's sin, Jacob's grief is Vondel's grief for his sin. The expected sequel to this would be the play about Peter and Paul, who were the Juda's and Levi's of the world, sharing, as Vondel did, the unfathomable hope of the Redemption. Joseph in Egypten however comes first; probably in order to complete the Joseph trilogy. Here, as in Maeghden, purity and trust in God fall victims to lust and wantonness. The similarities with Hippolytus are obvious, and though the fatality of the one is replaced by the hope of the other (for Joseph's imprisonment was as necessary a condition of his exaltation later as Christ's death was of His Resurrection), both plays resolve into a tragedy of the affections. In the one, Theseus grieves at the innocent death of his son, in the other Potifar grieves at the sentence he had to pass on one whom he could not help loving.' In Peter and Pauwels we come face to face with the paradox that the body must die that the soul may live; the Old Adam must die, Paul says, that we be born again into the Resurrection. Nero and his world of violent evil are able to destroy only worldly things such as Peter's and Pauwels' bodies, and this is what they themselves long for, since by mortifying the flesh they are killing the Old Adam which is the cause of sin. Material forces turn against themselves, the flesh destroys itself and the goodness of immortal life rises out of the evil. How much more profound is the thought here than in Maeghden where personified virtue is martyred to personified vice! The spiritual experience is fuller even than in Joseph in Dothan, for the apostles have in their natures something of both Joseph the innocent sufferer and his brothers the traitors and would-be murderers. In Peter and Pauwels, as in Vondel himself, the spirit of God in His martyred Son can only survive the assaults of the flesh by continually striving against it and mortifying it. Though Leeuwendalers is a pastoral written in a totally different vein from the rest of Vondel's drama, the country of the Northerners and Southerners is a creation of Vondel's own fantasy and its Utopian quality furnishes evidence of Vondel's ideals. For this reason it will be taken into account when considering Vondel's Idea as a whole and reference will be made to it later in this connexion. The by now familiar conflict of love and duty recurs in the following play Salomon, but the tragic problem is more subtle than it has been previously. In Hippolytus and Joseph in Egypten the vice was clearly lust and the remedy purity. Gijsbreght's dilemma between love and duty was solved for him by Rafael. Ursul, like Hippolytus and Joseph, experienced no conflict, for not even the alternative of certain death could tempt her to fall from virtue, since God had already prepared her for death at the hands of her enemies. But in Salomon, though the apparent sin is idolatry and the cause of the sin is lust, the root sin is disobedience for it embraces cause and effect. By disobeying the commandment to 'love none other gods but Me', Salomon loved Sidonia literally to the point of idolatry. That Salomon fell from great glory to sin is itself evidence of the conflict and subtlety 1 Joseph in Egypten, 1. 1390.</page><page sequence="5">of the temptation, for men of strong character do not fall easily, and the choice for Salomon was not easy where a righteous love for his wife degenerated under the weakening influence of Sidonia's domination. Indeed, the tragic element becomes more and more refined as the spiritual con- flict becomes ever more difficult to resolve and the tragic hero, of such virtue that only the subtlest temptation can throw him into a spiritual dilemma, will be the more tragic for the height from which he falls. Lucifer, Jeptha and Adam exhibit only the high positive values which are the mark of the finest tragic hero.' In each a high positive value imperceptibly but inevitably yields to a lower positive value ;2 inevitably since the very quality which has produced an essential good in each of these beings is also the cause of a danger which a less fine or less sincere being might avoid, and this danger results in his fall. Vondel's frequent examination of his conscience brought him ever nearer to the focus of the vexing enigma of the clash in his spiritual experience between perfect and less perfect values resolving themselves ultimately into right and wrong. The duality underlying his dramatic conflicts is simply the projection of his own experience. Lucifer as the fullest expression of this enigma, is but the symbolism in comprehensible terms of the purely abstract ambivalence underlying his every experience. As such, Lucifer can best be read as the background to Vondel's total dramatic creation and further consideration is postponed until the survey of Vondel's drama has been completed. Salmoneus, written through force of circumstance which moreover required its staging to be similar to that of Lucifer,3 excusably adds little to what Vondel has already said. It is a hybrid of Salomon and Lucifer. The great virtue throughout the play Jeptha is obedience to God. Jeptha finally keeps his promise, thereby obeying the dictates of his conscience; the court priest requires Jeptha's obedience to the high priest as God's spokesman, and Ifis offers herself for the sacrifice in perfect obedience to her father's will, Tot een spiegel voor de jeugd Die hieruit zal leeren Godt in d'oudren eeren. (11. 1631-3) So Ifis, like Christ, is a mirror of the virtue of perfect obedience to God. In this play are gathered together all the themes so far apparent in Vondel's drama-the sacrifice leading to the Redemption, the husband's love of his wife, the father's of his children, and the child's of its father. King Edipus, like David in Gebroeders, took the advice given him for saving his country from famine, and he paid a bitter price for past wrongs.4 But Edipus' tragedy is greater than David's, for Edipus, an entirely sincere man bent on knowing the truth, learned, like Jeptha, too late what he had done, without being able to prevent it. If there be a hidden meaning to the translation of Sophocles' play (and of course there need be no deeper significance to a translation than its prima facie merits as a tragedy), then it would be the Christian's searching of his 1 Max Scheler, Vom Umsturz der Werte der Abhandlungen und Aufsdtze (Leipzig, 1919), p. 246. 2 As Vondel's thought deepens, the tragic issue changes from a moral to a psychological one- the conflicting ideals of a sensitive conscience. As Scheler puts it (loc. cit. p. 245): 'Die Kraft, die vernichtet, darf nicht wertfrei sein; sie muB selbst einen positiven Wert darstellen'. 3 Berecht to Salmoneus. 4 J. van den Bergh van Eijsinga-Elias, 'Vondel en de Griekse Tragici', De Gids, LXXI (1907), 499. 207 PETER KING</page><page sequence="6">208 The Sacramental Thought in Vondel's Drama conscience for signs of wrongdoing for which penance must be done, which is comparable to Edipus' earnest inquiry into his past even when discovery of the truth is likely to cause bitter remorse. Samson, like so many of the later plays, can be interpreted at two allegorical levels: the typological-Samson foreshadowing the Messiah triumphing over his adversaries,1 and the anagogic which symbolizes the workings of grace. Samson sins (the theme of carnal affections once again), repents and requites his sin, whereby God's grace returns to him, the symbol of which is Samson's long hair, the token of his strength.2 The sorrow of a father for his child is familiar from Joseph in Dothan, Gebroeders and Jeptha. In all these plays the father suffers for the loss of his innocent child or near kinsman. The two tragedies about David and his son Absolon however show us a father grieving for the sins of his son, accepting the sorrow his son causes him as his penance for his own past sins and for ever offering forgiveness to his son. Absolon's sin, like Lucifer's and Salmoneus', is ambition, but the sin causing the tragic conflict is the more familiar sin of lust (David's own with Bath-sheba and Ammon's with Tamar). Whether or not we accept Verwey's opinion,3 that Jeptha's grief for his daughter was the expression of Vondel's own grief for his son Joost, it is reasonably safe to assume that the two David plays are autobiographical, being the anonymous expression of Vondel's penitent suffering not only for Joost's corruption in business and then his death at sea during his deportation, but rather perhaps of remorse for his own motives in being so harsh in punishing Joost, reflecting, as he thought in his doubts, the strictness of his condemnation of his own past life. Adonias, in the play of that name, like Absolon his brother, seeks to usurp the throne. To ambition he adds the sin of abusing marital love by seeking in his intended marriage with Abizag only a disguise for his political intrigue. For this Abizag, herself innocent, pays the price, first by being suspected of complicity in the plot of which she has no inkling, and then by losing a man she sincerely loves. Batavische Gebroeders reminds us that Vondel, while earnestly grappling with his spiritual problems, did not seek the calm refuge of a recluse. That he remained to the last a patriot is by no means an anomaly in a man whose faith was built on the firm foundation of discipline-the obedience of children to their parents, of Christians to their spiritual counsellors and of all men to their secular leaders; for all just men of authority on earth received that authority from God, and all men who subjected themselves to a God-fearing authority were but showing obedience to God through them. The two Batavian chieftains have the unenviable task of obeying their Roman overlords without neglecting their responsibilities to their own people. The way out of their dilemma, how to ease the afflictions of the Batavians without causing an insurrection against the powers set over them, is found for them when one is sentenced to death and the other to captivity. We see again the ties of love between two brothers as they both claim the right to die, and between their mother and them as she courageously speaks on their behalf. In the martyrdom of the one brother the thought within the play goes beyond history and a demonstration of Holland's greatness to the inner quality of a man 1 See Vondel's Dedicatory Epistle to Samson. 2 Cf. also the name Comforter for the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. 3 Een Inleiding tot Vondel (Amsterdam, 1900), p. 570, and Vondel's Vers (Santpoort, 1927), p. 111.</page><page sequence="7">following the Son of God, Whose kingdom was not of this world, Who did not attempt to overthrow the Roman rule as His people hoped He would, but redeemed them by dying on their behalf. With the exception of Leeuwendalers, Lucifer and Faeton, we have now surveyed the trend of thought in Vondel's drama up to 1664, the year of Adam in Balling- schap. The sub-title of this play, 'aller treurspelen treurspel', suggests that it embraces the themes of his other tragedies and even excels them in tragic force, for in this play the greatest issues are at stake: not just one sin but all sin, not just one life but all human life, not just one time or place but all times and everywhere that Man is aware of the duality within him arising from God's love and the freedom of will to abuse that love. Now the processes of Man's free will could be dramatized without difficulty in the manifestation of any spiritual conflict. But Divine Love, though Vondel experienced it as surely as he experienced free will, could never be expressed as anything more than some anthropomorphized symbol. In his attempts to plumb this all-pervading mystery, Vondel sensed that perfect Love between humans was but the incarnation of Divine Love, and so he interpreted the various aspects of his own human love, for his children, his wife, or parents, as sacramental, that is, an 'outward' sign in human life of an inward and spiritual grace. To Vondel the two New Testament commandments are inseparable; to love one's neighbour as oneself is to love God with all one's heart, soul and mind, for human love is God's love. The total sum of all aspects of perfect human love forms an approximation to the nature of God's Love, a fuller understanding of which can only be experienced in the soul. Love or its antithesis (hatred, or in sexual relationships lust), figures prominently in every play after Hierusalem Verwoest. In Gijsbreght van Aemstel, Leeuwendalers and Adonias an important theme is the love between husband and wife or a lover and his lass; in Maeghden, Joseph in Egypten, Salomon, Salmoneus, Samson, Koning David in Ballingschap, Koning David Herstelt and Noah lust is shown to be an utter travesty of true love. In Gebroeders, Joseph in Dothan, Jeptha, the two King David plays, Batavische Gebroeders, Faeton, and Noah there is the love of parents for their children; in Jeptha and Noah, the love and obedience of children to their parents; in the King David plays and Faeton, the hatred or disobedience of children. In Batavische Gebroeders and Adonias brother loves brother,l and in Joseph in Dothan and Adonias there is the antithesis of this. In the two remaining plays, the spiritual love of the saints for their Lord is typified by the spiritual kinship of Plautil and Petronel with the saints, and the very Love of God itself is the theme of the angels in their supernatural kinship with God in the play Lucifer. Lucifer is an attempt to present the Idea itself in dramatic form. In order to create an illusion essential if the reader is to be able to experience the emotional force of the spiritual conflict, a degree of anthropomorphism is inevitable. Vondel compromises the purity of his intuition of things beyond human comprehension by translating it into the terms of a universally comprehensible poetry. But the 1 As in Sophompaneas, though for reasons stated translations are not considered valid evidence for Vondel's Idea. However, if they have any significance in the total picture, it is noteworthy that in every tragedy except Ifigenie in Tauren the catastrophes are caused directly or indirectly by inconstancy, lust or incest. In Herkules in Trachin there is moreover the true love of Deienira, in Ifigenie in Tauren the love of a brother and sister, in Amsteldamsche Hekuba the love of a mother for her children, and in Herkules Furens the love of a father. 209 PETER KING 14 M.L.R.LI</page><page sequence="8">210 The Sacramental Thought in Vondel's Drama greatest poetry is a compromise, for 'poetry is relative; but the intuition and the knowledge from which poetry is born is absolute. And there is no reconciling them.' That Vondel should have made such a compromise is evidence, not of any under- estimation of his task as an artist, but only of the intensity of his spiritual experience. wat op 's harten grond leyd Dat weltme na de keel; ick word te stijf geparst, En 't werckt als nieuwe wijn, die tot de spon wtbarst.2 The deepest love and kinship of man to woman, of son to father and father to son, and of brother to brother are fused and exalted to pure spirit in the super- natural love in Lucifer. Lucifer's remorse in 11. 1634-55 is more than that of any prodigal son, for his love for God was greater than any man's for man.3 The inner- most theme of Lucifer is the contamination of this spiritual love by the world. As soon as Lucifer breaks the 'spell' of the mutual flow of love between him and God by looking down at Adam and Eve, the corruption of worldly values inevitably begins eroding the higher spiritual values. In the play itself we see only the final stages of the destruction of Lucifer's pure intuition by intellectual reasoning, but, more from the angels and archangels than from Lucifer himself, we sense the perfection of his unquestioning love and loyalty up to the moment that he turned away from God to look down at Eden. Lucifer has rightly been called 'meesterwerk van de kunst van het embleem, de geliefde stijlvorm van de 17e eeuw. Embleem der "staetzucht" zo scherp geslepen, zo geconcentreerd, essentieel geestelijk doorlicht, dat het spreken blijft door alle eeuwen'.4 But unless we can find Vondel's own philosophy behind the didactic emblems exhibited, as it were, on the front page of his plays, we shall come no nearer to Vondel's Truth than the outward manifestations of such vices as ambition, jealousy and lust, or the virtues of obedience or purity. We shall be overlooking the deeper significance of Vondel's typology by interpreting his drama in the light of the Ten Commandments instead of the laws of Reality, the two Commandments given by the Redeemer Himself.5 Vondel knew Lucifer within himself, not as Evil, nor even as Temptation, but as the whole sum of temporal values threatening the holy. Every tragedy implies the mortification of worldly values that spiritual values may prevail, in martyrdom, penitence and obedience. Human love itself can only remain undefiled if it remains the clear mirror of Divine Love. Vondel's love for his wife must strive to imitate Christ's love for His Church or Man, his children's love towards him or his own towards his parents must be 1 Middleton Murry in Discoveries. Essays in Literary Criticism (London, 1924), p. 42. 2 Vondel, Roskam. See also W. Kramer, 'Vondel's Lucifer', De Nieuwe Taalgids, 34, pt. v, (1940), p. 214. 3 B. Verhagen, loc. cit. pp. 100-1, reads Lucifer's words too literally. His love for God is not simply like the son's for his father, though in terms of human language that may be the nearest approximation to his real feeling. 4 W. Kramer, loc. cit. p. 214. Vondel in his preface to Samson, written significantly between Jeptha and the King David plays in which parental love figures so prominently, writes: 'Hij overwint de vyanden door zijn doot, tot een voorbeelt van den beloofden Verlosser, en Wetgever der menschen, die door het voorschrift van de wet der liefde, in het eenige woort Bemin begrepen, alle voorgaende wetgevers en wijsheit overtreft, en de wraeckgierigheit, met wortel met al uit de harten zijner leerlingen ruckende, deze nieuwe en volkome wet plant, waer tegens alle, die op zijnen naem ydel roemen, zich ten hooghste bevlecken, zoo menighmael zy hun leedt en ongelijck met gedachten, woorden, of wercken wreecken, en niet liever door weldaedigheit hunnen haeters overtuigen, om te tonen dat zy van de geest der liefde gedreven worden, naer het onbevleckte voorbeelt, hun in dien hemelschen wetgever voorgestelt.'</page><page sequence="9">like that of Christ for the Father, and he must love his children as God loves Man. The immeasurable power behind every play is Vondel's inward experience of Divine Love in himself. This is the noumenon beyond allegory, emblem, symbol and type. Jacob's sorrow for Joseph is God's grief at the loss of His Son as Vondel personally experienced this. David's suffering for Absolon's sins and his forgiveness of him is a translation of Christ's suffering for sinful Man from Vondel's own experience of pain and forgiveness for his son Joost. Here we are no longer in the realms of the natural, but the supernatural. Vondel's spiritual awareness that his love for his children must be like God's Love for Man has in practice become the spiritual experience of that Love within himself, and in that supernatural experience Vondel apprehends the very nature of God's Love for His Son.1 We should not expect to find a confession from Vondel of such a deep sacramental experience, but the Preface to Koning David Herstelt clearly implies such a confession, provided that we accept that the play is autobiographical. Faeton, written at a crucial point in the sequence of Vondel's drama (three years after the King David plays and a year before Adam in Ballingschap), can be considered as the complement of Jeptha. Jeptha subjects his free will to the Will of God as he interprets it through his conscience. Febus' promise to Faeton is complete freedom of will, which gift Faeton abuses. Faeton, half-god, half-human, is promised a free choice by his divine father because of his semi-divine nature. By abusing this promise and by disregarding his father's advice and disobeying his orders for the journey, Faeton falls from heaven to sudden death on earth. This is the outline of the story with Faeton at the centre of it, and similarities with Lucifer and Adam in Ballingschap are obvious: the disobedience in Faeton, Lucifer and Adam is the disobedience in Vondel himself. But what of Febus and Jupiter? Febus loves his son, and because of that love he makes a promise he must keep even when it is certain that Faeton will abuse it. He cares for his son bent on his perilous purpose, right up to the last, giving him his instructions as if for a journey through life. When Faeton's reckless course endangers the whole earth, the heavenly hosts appeal to Jupiter to stem the utter destruction. He is loath to take the life of Febus' own son, but the need is urgent and Faeton must be punished. To the last Febus does all in his power to protect his son from Jupiter's thunderbolt; like David he would fain die in the place of his son. There is a suggestion of the two great aspects of Divine Love, mercy and justice, in Febus who represents the new law of love, mercy and forgiveness no matter what the cost to him, and Jupiter (the God of justice) who must save the disciplined order of creation without which justice could not exist, by punishing the evil-doer even though this must cause bitter anguish to his son who, like Christ,2 cries out in his sorrow: 'och mijn zoon. Och waert ge nooit geboren !' Yet this same Febus, granting his son freedom of choice and later suffering at his son's presumption and fall, bears more resemblance to God the Father than to God the Son. And elsewhere Febus resembles sinful Man, when he is reproved by Jupiter for recklessly assigning his god-given power to his son in order to establish his own prestige in his son's eyes. 1 Cf. John x. 14-15, 'I know mine own and mine own know me as the Father knoweth me and I know the Father', of which W.

But in Febus we can sense something of Vondel's under- standing of the mystical relationship between God, Christ and Man in the relation- ships of Febus towards his Adam-like son and his omnipotent father. The expression of such a mystery cannot be complete since it is confused by the paradoxes inherent in any mystery; yet by including within the experiences of one figure, Febus, two kinds of human love, parental and filial, themselves symbolic of aspects of the one whole Divine Love, Vondel comes nearer in this play than in any other to expressing his own spiritual experience in the thoughts of the players. Just as Febus has in him something of Jupiter as well as Faeton, so Vondel embodies divine goodness and sin. As Febus' relationships as father and son placed him between the human and the godly, so too Vondel's relationships on earth were the human experiences through which Divine Love could be imparted. In this play then, we find the various elements of thought implicit or explicit in all Vondel's plays except the purely occasional works. Central is God's Love with its promise of free will, resulting in Man's abuse of that free will, his dis- obedience to God's Will and abuse of this divine nature to be a god unto himself; and the only means by which the order of justice can be restored is through the suffering of God Himself for that sin, the Satisfaction which has restored mankind in the Redemption.' But equally central in the play is Vondel himself, living in Jupiter and experiencing something of God's sorrow for the sins of Man and the suffering of His Son,2 living in Febus, sharing something of Christ's Passion, living in Faeton as the sinful son of God abusing His Love and promise of free will, and living in all three as Vondel the father, husband3 and son. Lucifer and Faeton are complementary images of the Absolute using symbols for supernatural qualities. Having attempted to interpret the Absolute in its essence, Vondel's way is prepared for expressing fully the Absolute in the Parti- cular: Man; for Vondel remains to the last a practical man of the world, not a mystic.4 In essentially human experiences he learns the Truth and in human form, that Truth, which is found within ourselves, is most comprehensible. Adam in Ballingschap is the objectification of Reality incarnate. Here we see the actual duality in man, the perfection that was Christ's, the second Adam's, and the disobedience that was Lucifer's, and the two extremes clash and struggle for supremacy in Man, Adam. Adam in Ballingschap is of all Vondel's plays the fullest externalization of Vondel's spiritual life, even as Adam's conflict is the truest possible externalization of Vondel's conflict, for in Adam as in Vondel are the dual natures of the flesh and the spirit, the material and the holy: perfect love which can only be interpreted in terms of God's Love, and carnal affection; perfect spiritual unity with God which can be disrupted by communion with the devil, with their symbolic equivalents in the contrasts of Paradise and barren wilderness and of the robes of original righteousness and the leaves of nature. The chain of Vondel's drama is like a necklace of many coloured stones; several stones have but different shades of the same colour, the clasp without which the chain could not be complete is the intangible Lucifer, but the diamond pendant of 1 Cf.

Haentjens, Hugo de Groot als Godsdienstig Denker (Amsterdam, 1946), pp. 89 ff. 2 Act iv, sc. ii, especially 11. 1112-52. 3 Husband, since Klymene, Febus' mortal wife, plays an important part in the early stages of the play. 4 G.

Here we can catch a glimpse of the different tones of every aspect of Truth appearing severally in the plays, they will elude us if we try to separate them. Adam and Eve have in their innocency the natures of Joseph, Ursul, Gijsbreght, Badeloch, Peter, Pauwels, Ifis, Noah and Gabriel; and in their fallen state they have something of Attila, Jempsar, Peter and Pauwels, Salomon, Sidonia, Salmoneus, Filotimie, Samson, Absolon, Adonias, Faeton, Urania and of course Lucifer. One translation is of particular interest because of the similarity of its theme to the Father-Son-Man Idea emerging more and more clearly in Vondel's later plays. Hercules in Hercules Furens, born of a divine father and a mortal mother, had lived a life of glory under divine protection, and was an exemplary virtuous (pius) being. Juno, jealous of his semi-divine heritage and the divine favour shown to him, sought to avenge Hercules' birth on Jupiter his father. But she had not succeeded in attacking him openly and he had survived the twelve labours, thereby van- quishing Hades and gaining potential immortality. Juno says of Hercules: 'quaerit ad superos viam', and Lucifer says of Adam: 'Een andre klaerheit komt in 't licht der Godtheit stijgen' .1 It was at the very peak of Hercules' achievement that the spirit of Madness, Juno's emissary, succeeded in its surreptitious assault. In his frenzy Hercules killed his wife and children and brought disgrace and exile on himself. Moreover he could not take his arms with him, since they were gifts from the gods. Lucifer was, like Juno, jealous of Adam's divine heritage and promise of im- mortality. Unable to attack him openly, he sent Belial, his crafty confederate, to assail him (through Eve) at the height of his glory immediately after the wedding-feast. Adam did not kill his children, but he cut them off from eternal life by his action, and he, like Hercules, must needs go into exile rather than take his own life, leaving the robes of Original Righteousness, also a gift from Heaven, behind him. Like Hercules, the second Adam was the son of God and yet born of mortal woman, and when Hercules finally dies he reappears to his mourning mother as a spirit in Heaven.2 The similarities between Hercules, Adam and Christ join a pattern of similarities between Hercules and Samson,3 who was, in Vondel's words, intended of God's wisdom to portray a great Redeemer by his birth, life and death.4 Hercules, like Samson, degenerated from mighty deeds to unworthy slavery through love for Queen Omphalia, and fell ultimately, like Adam, through love for a woman, Iole. We have also seen that Samson's sin cost him his special gift from God, even as Adam lost his white robes of innocency. Indeed, the 'staetsveranderinge' sym- bolized by the metamorphosis from veiled innocence to shameful nakedness has its counterparts in many plays, and in none more vividly than in Lucifer. These metamorphoses are only manifestations of a change in heart, mood or condition. The transformation of Lucifer from God's deputy to monstrous fiend is really no more comprehensible than the contrast of Heaven to Hell. But the change in Adam and Eve brought about by the Fall is complementary to the change of scene Lucifer, Act II, 1. 357. 2 Hercules Oetaeus, Act v. The Chorus sings: 'Alcides once again has conquered Hell.' 3 See F. M. Krouse, Milton's Samson and the Christian Tradition (Princeton, 1949), pp. 44, 45. 4 Preface to Samson. 213 PETER KING</page><page sequence="12">The Sacramental Thought in Vondel's Drama from Eden to exile in the outside world. We can readily encompass that because only perfect and imperfect humanity is involved, and with it an unspoiled order of nature which we have all sensed because we are part of that natural order. The artist can see the contrast between virgin nature and nature defiled by Man, as is evident in the great quantity of lyrical poetry in the world and of pastorals in particular. Leeuwendalers is but a pleasing fantasy of a paradise country, where the laws of Pan bind all creatures in simple concord and happiness. Pan himself is the symbol of the spirit and flesh in Man, the soul in Adam and the body in Eve, for 'zijn bovenste deel vertoont den hemel; zijn onderlijf en ruige bocksvoeten, het aertrijck met zijn ruighte'.1 So Pan lives, as we should expect, in a land not unlike Eden, and Adelaert and Hageroos love one another with the same pure naivety as Adam and Eve.2 Like the New Testament parables Vondel's plays tell a story, they contain a certain amount of didactic exposition, they have a deeper symbolic significance and an even deeper anagogic or sacramental meaning, and the study of Vondel, like that of the parables, must be in depth as well as in breadth; the inner meaning of the Idea, growing steadily as one play follows another, will only begin to emerge when we accept Vondel's belief concerning his relationship to the Author of the parables, which is expressed in the sacramental allegory in his plays.
