This collection is designed to put matters right by supplying a text "devoted exclusively to environmental ethics" for "courses on contemporary moral problems" (ibid). Part One, entitled 'Defining an Environmental Ethic' serves this purpose fairly well, although the task essayed by the contributors has been one of characterising a suitable ethic rather than of defining one. Part Two, however, does not altogether live up to its title ('Specific Environmental Problems'), and the contributors there seldom show any awareness of the fundamental issues debated in Part One about the moral standing of nonhuman animals, of plants and of ecosystems. (Robert Socolow's essay is an exception.) Also, where specific problems do emerge, as over the state of American law about land use and confiscation, the issues are rather too parochial, or, as in the case of Tocks Island dam, treated in too technical a jargon, for the issues of principle to exhibit their universal interest and importance, let alone to illustrate what "philosophers. . . have been . . . concerned with" (Introduction to Part Two, EE, 94) in environ mental ethics. This discussion will mainly concern Part One, but there will first be a survey of Part Two. As there are no clearcut links between the two Parts, no loss of coherence will be suffered through this strategy, and those readers whose chief interest lies in Land Use, Cost-Benefit Analysis and/or Individual Versus Collective Choice (the three section headings of Part Two) will have their curiosity satisfied the sooner. II The papers within Part Two are scarcely the ones best suited to a course on environmental ethics, even when the editors' desire to avoid overlap with other collections in applied ethics is taken into account; but some are never theless of considerable value. One such is Eugene C. Hargrove's 'Anglo American Land Use Attitudes'. It tells of Thomas Jefferson's efforts to reintroduce the Saxon freehold tenure system, of John Locke's theory of property, and of the claims of modern freeholders to an entitlement to treat *Review article of Donald Scherer and Thomas Attig, Ethics and the Environment, Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1983, pp. iv + 236; paperback, ISBN 0-13-290163â€”3. 289</page><page sequence="2">290 REVIEWS land as they please. Hargrove's article is not unique in suffering from misprints, and at p. 107 leads the unsuspecting to believe that Robert Filmer's Patriarcha was published in 1280 (rather than in 1680). The same page also gives the impression that Locke was in exile throughout the reign of Charles II as well as that of James II, whereas in fact he did not flee until the fall and death of Shaftesbury in 1683. But Hargrove has the gift of making history come alive; and also advances some salutary 'Modern Difficulties with Locke's Position', before his article comes to the new point that appeals to freehold are no adequate reply to environmentalist criticism, and ends without further explanation or ado. There follow two contributions on American land law. Philip Soper supplies a Critical Natural Features theory of certain restrictions: wetlands promote flood control and ecological balance, and for that reason the law debars their unrestricted development. Judicial support for this theory is found in Chief Justice Hallows' judgement 'Just v. Marinette County', which constitutes the next contribution. These two papers add to that of Hargrove specific legal grounds for curtailing the activities of freeholders, but contribute little or nothing on legal constraints on land use outside USA, or on moral constraints in general. There again, Hallows contends that trees are "the natural fruit of the land" and may be harvested for human benefit if they are subsequently replaced (EE, 134); nonhuman interests do not come into the picture at all. There follows a Section professedly on 'Cost-Benefit Analysis'. Alasdair Mclntyre's paper, which is the only one centrally concerned with the title of the Section, compares bureaucratic processes such as cost-benefit analysis with the felicific calculus of utilitarianism, and argues that it is beset with the same deficiencies. The argument is powerful and unabating, and concludes that we are all subject to the need to suppress moral conflicts, which are generally unsettlable both in modern society and within ourselves as individuals. But the premise that values are incommensurable is assumed rather than argued; I should maintain that there is much more scope for the rational appraisal of moral conflicts within an enriched teleological or consequentialist theory than Mclntyre allows, though this is hardly the place to pursue the matter.1 (If the problems of business executives are as irresolvable as Mclntyre says, perhaps it is due to an excessive endorsement of current business practice rather than to the ultimate relativity of values to institutions, ideologies or forms of discourse.) Mclntyre's contribution ends with the claim that, to avoid unmanageable moral conflict, executives need two kinds of device; the first (the drawing of watertight boundaries around diverse areas of social 11 have attempted to show how a consequentialist theory may be defended against at least some of the standard criticisms in 'Towards a Defence of Teleology' Ethics, 85, 1974-5, 123-35. The theory is developed further in chapters 6 to 9 of The Ethics of Environmental Concern, Oxford: Basil Blackwell Publisher and New York: Columbia University Press, 1983; but not in chapters 5 and 6 of God and The Secular, Cardiff: University College Cardiff Press, 1978, as one recent reviewer, confused about the sense of teleology, has claimed.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 291 life) has been left to stand in the text; in place of the second, there is an aposiopesis represented by three asterisks. Could not his full prescription have been allowed to stand? Robert H. Socolow's paper draws attention to further weaknesses of cost-benefit analysis, such as the tendency to ignore the side-effects when natural systems are changed. The 'golden rules' employed by analysts provide an illusory shelter from such problems. Here imperfect editing appears again: Socolow relates (EE, 155) how "Others in this volume comment" on the effects of calculating the value of recreation in different ways; but the volume to which he refers is not the present one, but presumably that in which his paper appeared originally. Presumably a similar reference is made when he twice refers to Laurence Tribe's essay, without further indication of which essay he is referring to (EE, 168, 169). But Socolow has several more profound points to make. We should get accustomed not to absolute guarantees of invulnerability against "nature's excesses", but rather to reduced vulnerability, combined with some degree of "subordination to nature's variability". For it needs to be recognised that compromise is essential when we seek to optimise over multiple variables. There again, a sufficiently inventive technology with an increased cybernetic emphasis should make our machines and buildings easier to repair and "increase our sensual contact with our natural surroundings" (EE, 160). He also brings to the surface the distinct discourses of, on the one hand, managers of forestry and fisheries who assume that man can improve on nature and, on the other, of conservationists who tend to assume that human interventions spell deterioration and that "nature knows best"; and the separate languages used by conservationists when talking to others and when talking to each other. In this way the latter tend not to articulate that what they really value is nonhuman creatures or natural systems, rather than the 'crops' which humans derive from them. Similarly they may fail to point out the significance of conserving nature's rhythms rather than e.g. evening out river flow. "A river that flows evenly is not a natural river, however convenient it may be to man; plants and animals, in countless well-understood ways, are keyed to the seasonal flow engendered by melting snow. By various yard sticks such as species diversity or production of desired species, the evening of flow could be said to have deteriorated the river". Whether Socolow is arguing here from the river's interests as well as from those of the species in question (and of humans) is itself unclear; his later view that the river should have standing when decisions are made may suggest that this is his position, but those concerned with the interests of animate creatures only could easily make the necessary adjustments. His main point is a good one; planners ought to listen carefully to ecologists and conservation groups, and, beyond that, to question them, lest important emphases or solutions be overlooked. Socolow proceeds to illustrate the possibilities of unlooked-for solutions to environmental problems, arrived at when disputes are reappraised in the light of ecological awareness.</page><page sequence="4">292 REVIEWS Alan Gewirth's paper argues that the Right to the Non-Infliction of Cancer is an absolute one, and bears on cost-benefit analysis only in that the latter suggests otherwise. His conclusion that the right in question is not subject to the willingness of potential victims to accept financial compensation (EE, 175) is cogent enough, but it never becomes clear within the paper what an "absolute" human right is, with the result that it is impossible to assess the central conclusion. Whether a crucial passage has been edited out, I cannot tell. There is a parallel problem with the related "right of informed control". Gewirth explains what the informed control criterion is for attributing responsibility, and thus when it is that agents exercise informed control; but he seems not to spell out what the counterpart right amounts to. My substantial hesitation about whether either of these rights, once spelt out, are unconditional, is grounded in the possibility that in some circumstances they could only be honoured if vast numbers of excruciatingly painful experiments on/animals were carried out. If this possibility materialised, then a person's rights against those who had it in their informed control to prevent the infliction of cancer might rightly be overridden. Ralph B. Potter's essay 'The Simple Structure of the Population Debate' is not really on cost-benefit analysis at all, but concerns four different solutions of the (so-called) population problem, and the diverse values found by Potter among economists, ecologists and demographers. (Do demographers really give the priority to individual freedom which Potter ascribes to them? Even if he is right about the middle-class, Protestant origins in Scandinavia and Anglo-Saxon lands of the family planning movement, 1 have not noticed this priority among the demographers of my acquaintance.) In due course Potter concentrates on an exposition of the views of Paul Ehrlich, until his text reaches a by now familiar abrupt curtailment. Just before this, two criticisms of Ehrlich are made. Firstly, if structured change awaits the emergence of a new ecologically-minded breed, but this development requires prior structural change, then there can be little hope of such change. Secondly, ecologists praise a simple and harmonious life-style, but have little alternative to appearing strident themselves, and thus to abandoning their own mission. From Potter's account of Ehrlich, one key point emerges: if, for reasons of population or resource limits, underdeveloped countries must be asked to forego Western levels of industrialisation, then distributive justice requires an immense reform of the international trading system to favour these countries, and to annul the way in which the current system discriminates against them. (Indeed surely distributive justice requires this anyway.) I have argued elsewhere that social and economic development in the Third World, for which measures such as these may well be required, probably constitute the only way to decrease the rate of population increase there.2 2The Ethics of Environmental Concern, chapters 1, 6 and 10; also Robin Attfield, 'Population Policies and the Value of People', Journal of Social Philosophy, 14.4,1983, 84-93 (conference microfilm edition)</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 293 In the first essay of the final Section ('Individual Versus Collective Choice') the late William T. Blackstone is represented by a paper comparing utilitarian and libertarian models of decision-making with a third, the liberal-pluralist model, which is a blend of the other two, and is preferred by the author on intuitive grounds. His main example (exposure to toxic substances) gives the paper such relevance as it has to the collection. But Blackstone's dilemma arises from considering an insufficient range of models. His understandable rejection of both arbitrary state-interventionism and capricious individualism surely does not warrant accepting a blend of the two. Solutions arrived at communally or involving communal cooperation should also be considered. This is done by Donald Scherer in his essay 'The Game of Games'. To problems of the 'Tragedy of the Commons' type he presents three types of solution: the games of "mutual coercion mutually agreed upon" (Garrett Hardin); of "small is beautiful" or "community solidarity" (Ernst Schumacher); and that of "as-if altruism" or voluntary prudential cooperation (Thomas Schelling). Scherer also elucidates the different conditions in which one or other of these games is preferable; the game of games is played when we choose between these models. Scherer's examples of "as-if altruism", car sharing and off-peak electricity, show it to be a viable approach in face of at least some environmental problems. The issues of where the decisions are made, and who is to play the game of games, lie beyond his brief. There follows an extract from Thomas Schelling's Micromotives &amp; Macro behavior? After establishing the practical limits of "self-enforcing con ventions" he argues for "an enforceable social contract" (EE, 218) in cases where large benefits are to be had, but only if cooperation is unanimous. Perhaps it is worth labouring the obvious, especially when this is done so entertainingly. In the final contribution to the collection, Mark Sagoff further castigates cost-benefit analysis and its practitioners. Sagoff's main theme is that the preferences which we make as customers are often in conflict with the values which we cherish as voters, and that the former are no substitute for the latter. He also ascribes to cost-benefit analysts an emotivist construal of all value-judgements which fail to support their own criterion of rectitude; and contrasts this construal with the "Kantian" conception of value (which turns out to be ethical objectivism). The conclusion that only on an objectivist understanding can moral judgements be taken seriously is to be applauded, but not at the price of rejecting all consequentialist or more generally all non Kantian accounts of normative ethics. Indeed, annoying as it must be when cost-benefit analysts devalue everyone else's discourse, there is surely no conceptual necessity for them to be so uncouth; and if not, further reasons are needed to show why efforts to compare costs and benefits (to all interested parties) are not the best available guide when political decisions have to be 3 Thomas Schelling, Micromotives and Macrobehavior, W.W. Norton &amp; Company Inc., 1978</page><page sequence="6">294 REVIEWS made. Those who do not, as Mclntyre does, accept the bankruptcy of any attempt to maximise the balance of good over bad consequences of actions and policies may like to consider whether alternative approaches to costs and benefits, as expounded in another collection of environmental ethics by Robert Goodin,4 may not carry some wisdom, and thus whether cost-benefit analysis should be reformed rather than jettisoned. Such a reform would, of course, have to take into account nonhuman interests alongside human interests if, as several contributors to Part One argue, nonhuman creatures have moral standing. But as Socolow's implicitly reformist paper shows, even such a far-reaching reform as this is within the bounds of the practicable. Ill Part One begins appropriately with two extracts from the writings of Aldo Leopold, one from A Sand County Almanac and one from "Some Fundamentals of Conservation in the Southwest", a paper composed in the 1920's. As J. Baird Callicott points out (EE, 62, n.22), the analogy of the biotic community as a moral community, which predominates in the former, does not altogether supersede even there his earlier analogy of the land as an organism, expressed in the latter; certainly both models have proved seminal in the subsequent development of environmental ethics. As John Rodman remarks (EE, 89), the vision implicit in the 'Land Ethics' chapter of A Sand County Almanac is best captured by reading that work as a whole, and this I heartily commend. Leopold the field-worker illuminates the relations and points of view of wild creatures, and against this background his visionary plea for a "land ethic" secures a hearing. Leopold the philosopher is something of a disaster, and I dread the thought of the student whose concept of philosophy is modelled principally on these extracts. (Can value "in the philosophical sense" be contrasted with instrumental value? If concepts of right and wrong did not apply to slaves in Homeric Greece, how could Odysseus suspect the slave-girls of "misbehavior"? If all ethics rest on relations of interdependence, how are obligations to infants and small children possible? And how can "obligations have no meaning without conscience"5, granted that the notion of conscience is conceptually dependent on that of obligation?) As Rodman reminds us, an action can be right or wrong in reference to 4 Robert Goodin, 'Ethical Principles of Environmental Protection', in Robert Elliot and Arran Gare, Environmental Philosophy, A Collection of Readings, St. Lucia, Queensland: University of Queensland Press, Milton Keynes: Open University Press and University Park, Pennsylvania: Penn State University Press, 1983, 3-20. sAldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac, New York: Oxford University Press, 1949, p. 209, cited by Callicott, EE, 65.</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 295 individuals as well as communities, and when Leopold claims that "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise" (EE, 8) his statement needs to be recognised as an overstatement. Indeed, as Rodman also allows (EE, 90), Leopold presents no logical arguments for his case. Yet his plea for an extension of our perceptions of the moral community has alerted many to their moral blindness, and well deserves the prominence and the elaboration which it receives in this collection. As Callicott has pointed out, there is no need to ascribe obligations to all members of the biotic community for it to be allowed that human beings have obligations in their regard.6 At all events Leopold was a shrewd observer of history as well as of the natural world. In particular, and despite finding most current religions to be "anthropomorphic" (EE, 11) (by which he means "anthropocentric") he remarks how Ezekiel and Isaiah asserted that the despoliation of land was not only inexpedient but also wrong (EE, 7), and detects in Ezekiel an ethic of stewardship and an interpretation of dominion over nature entailing the responsibility of passing on the earth to the future the better for our use (EE, 9). Many writers find the attitudes of the Biblical writers to nature to be susceptible of a despotic interpretation, if not actually to require it; I have argued elsewhere to contrary effect,7 and welcome Leopold's testimony to the depth of Judaeo-Christian tradition in the matter of regard for the land. But I should contest his view that this regard has been harboured by individuals only, and never till recently by communities. There follow two papers which variously defend and explicate anthropo centrism, the position which represents ethics as concerned with human interests only. W.H. Murdy is quite explicit about this in 'Anthropocentrism: A Modern Version'. Human beings must, he holds, exploit nature to live (EE, 14); they will inevitably put their own survival and that of their species first (EE, 15); and in any case an anthropocentric belief in the creative potential of humans is necessary to motivate participation in our own future evolution, which will in fact involve living harmoniously with th'e wholes to which we belong, nature included. Curiously, Murdy does not deny the intrinsic value of nonhuman species, but he also holds that even where this value is recognised, human survival remains the predominant motive. Yet even if this were the unqualified truth, Murdy has no grounds on which to resist the moral relevance of nonhuman interests, which even within his scheme of things might be expected to carry weight at the margins. Further, the campaigns and the life-styles of many participants in the animal welfare and environmental movements are testimony to the possibility of people setting nonhuman 6J.

As Murdy would agree, there is a strong human interest in conservation; and his faith in human creative potential is also to be commended. This potential, however, includes an ability to be inspired by values, and to recognise loci of value, undetected by anthropocentrism. Mark Sagoff, by contrast, urges us to look beyond utilitarianism as a rationale for preserving the natural environment and take more seriously its aesthetic value. He recognises the problem of grounding conservation in the symbolism of nature, notably that symbolism might shift in such a way as to prompt environmental destruction instead, and that in any case significant symbols reduce ultimately to a further human interest to be aggregated with and matched against the rest. But he maintains nonetheless that aesthetic qualities are objective, and that natural environments objectively symbolise qualities important in American cultural history; and contends that the right of access to this symbolism should be enshrined in the constitution. Sagoffs position has been well discussed by Tom Regan8 (whose writings are sadly unrepresented in this collection). Here it may be sufficient to point out, with Blackstone, that rights are never unqualified and need to be pitted against each other (rather like, in fact, the corresponding interests); that Sagoffs case does not as much as touch on wilderness outside USA; that a future culture may find nature objectively to symbolise qualities other than those which people cherish now; and that Sagoffs case turns ultimately on human rights, and is thus as anthropocentric as Murdy's. Thus if there is a case for conservation which does not depend wholly on human interests (if, say, it would be wrong for the last human to spend his or her last hour destroying the surrounding vegetation), it must be found elsewhere. The five papers which follow are attempts to characterise and defend an enlarged ethic which would transcend anthropocentrism. The absence of any contribution from Val and Richard Routley, perhaps the leading theorists in this area, and the lack of mention of them even in the Selected Bibliography, are greatly to be regretted. Nevertheless the debate is well forwarded by Kenneth E. Goodpaster's paper 'On Being Morally Considerable' with its cogent defence of the possession of interests as the condition of having moral standing. As Goodpaster points out, the interests-criterion takes us beyond the realm of the sentient, at the boundaries of which Geoffrey Warnock, William Frankena, Peter Singer and Joel Feinberg set the limits of moral considerability, and requires us to include all living organisms. I have argued elsewhere that some additional reasoning is required to exclude the possibility that some organisms might have a specific good of their own but lack moral Tom Regan, 'The Nature and Possibility of an Environmental Ethic', Environmental Ethics, 3, 1981, 16-31; reprinted in Tom Regan, All That Dwell Therein, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, 1982, 184-205.</page><page sequence="9">REVIEWS 297 standing nonetheless;9 but I believe that what is needed can be supplied, and with minor qualifications only I accept the conclusion just mentioned. Goodpaster also suggests at two points (EE, 31, 39) that ecosystems may also have moral standing as such; I shall return to this question later. Even if they do not, yet as long as their living members have such a standing we already have the basis of a justifiably enlarged and ecologically sensitive moral system. The members, after all, cannot survive without the systems on which they depend. Whether there is a defensible ethic of this kind is the concern of Holmes Rolston III in 'Is There an Ecological Ethic?'. In the first part he shows how, just as once it is allowed that prudence generates obligations it can be shown that obligations exist to preserve one's health, so, once it is allowed that human survival generates obligations, the obligation to recycle can similarly be estab lished. But there is nothing distinctively ecological about such an ethic, says Rolston, until the premise changes to something like Leopold's master-principle. In the second part Rolston claims that study of nature predisposes us to value the beauty and integrity of the biotic system; "the values seem to be there as soon as the facts are fully in, and both alike are properties of the system" (EE, 48). The resulting ethic is both new, enlarged and well-grounded in observation. He goes on to find traces of the ecological conscience in existence already, to argue that there is no requirement for a suppressed anthropocentric value premise, and to explore the implications of the emerging ethic, including its scope for overcoming the widespread modern sense of alienation. Rolston sometimes interprets his ecological ethic as a partial one, not intended to displace existing "social-personal codes" (EE, 52), but rather supplementing them. Indeed "we cannot say whether value in the system or in the individual is logically prior" (ibid). Nor are we forbidden by this ethic from "rearrangement of nature's spontaneous course": there is room for human creativity. But human action should complement the beauty, integrity and stability of the planetary biosystem, not do violence to it (ibid). People ought to be able rationally to show that their actions enrich the system; and what they do is only right if its beauty, stability and integrity are preserved. If, however, "personal-social codes" yield acceptable guidance only where there is no conflict with preserving these qualities of the planetary biosystem, then the satisfaction of Leopold's principle is a necessary condition of moral Tightness in all matters. If we seek Rolston's justification for this view, we find an acknowledgement that the obligation to promote the beauty and integrity of the biosphere is a special case of a more general ought-principle, namely "that one promote beauty and integrity, wherever he finds it"; but this general principle, while not analytic, is virtually unarguable - and is thus 9 Robin Attfield, 'The Good of Trees', Journal of Value Inquiry, 15, 1981, 35-54; The Ethics of Environmental Concern, chapter 8.1 have also defended the pattern of reasoning embodied in Goodpaster's paper in 'Methods of Ecological Ethics', Metaphilosophy, 14,1983,195-208.</page><page sequence="10">298 REVIEWS unexceptionable. Yet if it is to support an exceptionless necessary condition of moral Tightness, it must be exceptionless itself, and not just true ceteris paribus. But that it is true in all circumstances needs to be argued, especially as John Rodman, in his paper, suggests omitting 'beauty' from Leopold's principle altogether and inserting "additional criteria, especially diversity" (EE, 90) (which Rodman holds to be of value in its own right). Moreover it is plausibly false, as it is plausibly right to protect one's family from gunfire by holding in front of them a painting, even if its beauty and integrity is ruined thereby. Admittedly the ruination of the biosphere would involve the ruination of all the loci of value situated therein; so it might seem that, where the beauty of the biosphere is in question, there is no similar problem. As, however, the biosphere can survive localised perturbations, it is far from clear that no action can ever be right which fails to enrich it. Rolston mentions, as a high moral principle, the obligation to keep promises (EE, 47): does he seriously suggest that promises should be kept only in cases where the biosphere would be enriched? I conclude that the central principle of his ecological ethic is a highly implausible one, and that it cannot be upheld unless much stronger grounds are given in its support. Indeed as far as I can see, the point of preserving the stability and integrity of the system (as opposed to its beauty, which, as Rodman may be suggesting, is nowhere near as important) is to preserve the flourishing of its present and future living members; unless this view is confuted, no one is required to accept the intrinsic value of biospheric stability and integrity. (There will, of course, be ample grounds for every one who is not insane to accept their immense instrumental value, but this recognition falls far short of justifying the claim that every action must enrich the system, or even the weaker claim that every action must preserve it.) But if so, then the values are not agreed as soon as the facts of ecological relationships are acknowledged, and Rolston has not begun to produce, as he had hoped, "an authentic naturalistic ethic" (EE, 54). He has, however, elaborated a principle which could form a subordinate part of a defensible ethical system, and, at that, one which offers to its holders the possibility of an ecologically broadened sense of identity and of one's own good (EE, 50f.) and the sense of being no longer distanced from nature but of being a member of its community of value (EE, 53). Even if the ultimate value lies in the flourishing of the members rather than in qualities of the system, such an ethic still allows nature to be respected not, as in an anthropocentric ethic, with fear, but, as Rolston would wish (EE, 54), with love. J. Baird Callicott has none of Rolston's hesitations over making Leopold's master principle supreme. On his account individual organisms (people included) have no intrinsic value, but have only a value which is relative to their contribution towards upholding the biosphere as a whole (EE, 63f). Similarly there is nothing intrinsically bad about pain, which is in any case only information; indeed pain usually has positive value relative to a creature's</page><page sequence="11">REVIEWS 299 functioning, and there is no general case for minimising it (EE, 68f.). Further, the present level of human population is so disruptive of the biosphere that it should be reduced to twice that of bears, for above that level individual humans are of negative value (in the only sense of 'value' which Callicott allows) (EE, 65). Callicott elicits this position largely from that of Leopold, and performs the useful service of distinguishing Leopold's land ethic from the "humane moralism" of philosophers such as Peter Singer and Tom Regan, and in general of the animal liberation movement. Where Singer and Regan, in their different ways, locate intrinsic value in individual creatures or their conscious states, Callicott finds none; where they oppose factory farming and hunting on grounds of cruelty, Callicott objects to the former because animals are reduced to machines, but not because of their sufferings, and as to hunting, he commends it. And where they might wish to liberate domestic animals, Callicott (unlike Rolston (EE, 52) ) would prefer their annihilation on eco logical grounds (EE, 67-72). To avert their sense of unfamiliarity, Callicott also reminds his readers of Plato's readiness to support drastic political measures, such as infanticide and the withholding of medical treatment from the chronically ill, all for the good of the whole, and maintains that adherents of a holistic ethic must be similarly unshrinking. (EE, 65-67). Very largely, I consider that Callicott is a consistent expositor of Leopold's central holistic themes, though some of his interpretations maybe idiosyncratic: for example there is room for dispute about the present level of the human population being ecologically disruptive, rather than, say, the activities of powerful corporations and governments, and here, maybe, there is elaboration rather than exposition. Nevertheless, if Leopold's master-principle is not recognised, as it is by Rodman (EE, 91), as an overstatement, this is the "ethic" which we get. But as soon as we come across such proposals for daily life and social policy, we ought to pause and reflect on whether they are defensible, or even consistent with the values, such as love of parents and children, friendship, trust and respect for persons, without which we should lack our ethical vocabulary â€” and to the prevalence of which, plausibly, most of us owe our individual survival. And, of course, they are not. Nor is there any way of arguing to them from received judgements without inconsistency. Thus we cannot appeal from the general value of beauty to the supreme value of the beauty of the biosphere, if endorsing the latter is liable to require the elimination of a vast number of instances of beauty (i.e. most human beings and domestic animals), and of most of the subjects on whose appreciation of beauty, surely, the value of beauty depends. Nor can we, as Callicott does, argue that land can be valued for its own sake as easily as people can (EE, 65), at any rate if the consequent valuation of land is so exclusive that individual people cannot be valued for their own sake at all. Indeed Callicott's totalitarian conclusions are even worse supported that Plato's; for Plato would have maintained at all events that he was concerned with the common good of the humans of his polity, a position which can be followed enough to allow one</page><page sequence="12">300 REVIEWS to dispute it, whereas for Callicott human interests count for little (or rather for nothing if one is not among the quota of people permitted to exist before double the number of bears is reached). I do not make these remarks to defend the ethical system of either Singer or Regan; indeed I have criticised their systems elswhere.10 Nor does what I have so far said in any way settle the question of whether macrobiotic systems are of intrinsic value. If, however^ nothing else is accorded intrinsic value, the resulting code is conceptually adrift from almost all recognisable anchorages, and seems to undermine any basis for conducting life justly and mercifully among our fellow humans. Some may seek to defend the adoption of such a holistic code by talk of a paradigm-shift; but this is surely a mere evasion intended to make one's position invulnerable to the kind of rational discussion to which any ethic may properly be submitted. There is a further danger to remark in Callicott's text; for Callicott holds that "there can be no value apart from an evaluator". Would the foreseen demise of all evaluators then make it acceptable for the last of them to survive to lay about him just before his death, destroying all remaining life within reach? I have heard anthropocentrism defended on the basis of Callicott's "no detachable values assumption" (as the Routleys calls this tenet); and, though the defence was in my view inconclusive,11 an objectivist meta-ethic constitutes, as Sagoff recognises, the strongest bastion against philistine reductions of genuine judgements of value to mere expressions of emotion or preference. Rolston has recently attempted to defend the objec tivity of non-anthropocentric values 12; and to whatever extent my own efforts to defend the objectivity of moral judgement hold water13, the case is just as strong for the objectivity of propositions of intrinsic value. Unlike Callicott, Donald Scherer has the good sense to argue to rather than from attributions of intrinsic value. By considering a sequence of thought experiments about hypothetical planets ('Lifeless', Modified Lifeless', 'Flora', 'Fauna', 'Modified Fauna' etc.) he shows how judgements of value can reasonably be made quite independently of the interests of the valuer, and that wherever there are organisms sustained by an interdependent organisation of functions there is a locus of (non-instrumental) value. Thus he also shows WThe Ethics of Environmental Concern, chapters 8 and 9; also in 'Western Traditions and Environmental Ethics', 'The Good of Trees' and The Ethics of Environmental Concern, chapter 7. 11 Michael A. Fox, 'Human Values, the Value of Nature and Environmental Ethics', in Pro ceedings of the Seventeenth World Congress ofPhilosophy, Montreal (1983), forthcoming. 12Holmes Rolston III, 'Are Values in Nature Subjective or Objective', in Elliot and Gare, 135-65. 13 Robin Attfield, 'The Logical Status of Moral Utterances', Journal of Critical Analysis, 4, 1972, 70-84; God and The Secular, chapter 4; 'The Value of Value Inquiry', Lettera, 19, 1980, 113-22.</page><page sequence="13">REVIEWS 301 how there can be a nonanthropocentric conception of value which is not holistic. Further he argues with some cogency that some sorts of rights may reasonably be attributed to individuals which have certain kinds of awareness, within an environmental ethic designed to maximise flourishing and minimise inter-species conflict. In a nine-page paper, this is good going. Scherer is eager not to exclude "individualist" values as Callicott does, and at the same time seeks to avoid ethical atomism. Indeed (unlike me) he regards biosystems with interdependent functioning as of intrinsic value alongside the flourishing of individual organisms, and adds that, because individuals are physically dependent upon a viable ecosystem, therefore their value derives from its value (EE, 80f., if I interpret the passage alright). But this reasoning is invalid; if a is causally dependent on b, and a is valuable, this shows that b has a value deriving from that of a, in maintaining which b is instrumental, rather than that the value of a depends on that of b. Lifeboats derive their value from their passengers and not vice versa. Yet Scherer has other and better defences of the claim that his ethic is an environmental one despite its atomist tendencies. Scherer's ethic includes the prioritised principle that no acceptable action may damage the vitality of the ecosystem; at the same time it is held that this is compatible with vast modifications of the system by individual valuers. It would seem that, though prioritised, the former principle is not as strong as the form taken by Leopold's master-principle within Rolston's sytem; before it is possible to tell whether Scherer's ethic is consistent or defensible, it would be necessary to know how vast the modifications can be. But as, unlike Rolston, he does not require actions to enrich the biosphere on pain of not being right, his prioritised principle may serve mainly as a necessary constraint which is neutral with respect to most actions through which creatures promote their own or others' flourishing. If so, then it is to be applauded as far as his paper allows it to be understood. The last paper in Part One is John Rodman's 'Four Forms of Ecological Consciousness Reconsidered'. This paper is a model of clarity, surveying in turn the anthropocentric Resource Conservation movement, the more pantheistic Wilderness Preservation movement, the so-called 'Moral Extension ism' of John Lilly, Peter Singer, Christopher Stone, Charles Hartshorne and John Cobb, and the more holistic, Leopoldian position of 'Ecological Sensi bility' preferred by Rodman himself. The superiority of the fourth position over the others is supposedly demonstrated thereby. My own view, argued in this journal on a previous occasion14, is that extensionism is both an acceptable and indispensable method of ecological ethics. Such analogical reasoning from familiar cases outwards is found in this volume in the extracts from Leopold (EE, 7), throughout Goodpaster's entire article, in Rolston (EE, 49), tacitly in Scherer (EE, 79), and even in Callicott (EE, 62, 65). Extensionism can take the form of recognising the moral standing, 14 In 'Methods of Ecological Ethics' (see note 9)</page><page sequence="14">302 REVIEWS alongside humans, of whatever has a good of its own within its own species, and need not measure the good of any species by the good of any other. At the same time distinctive capacities can qualify for distinctive recognition, and received judgements about inter-human relations are in most cases supplemented rather than supplanted. Rodman criticises such approaches for their atomistic tendencies; but I am yet to be convinced that there is much wrong with a theory which locates intrinsic value in the states, activities and experiences of individual organisms only, as long as future ones are not overlooked. "It seems bizarre to try to account for the value of a forest or a swamp by itemising and adding up the values of all the individual members", he asserts (EE, 87). But itemising and counting the living members of a swamp will in practice be no more necessary for atomists than for their critics, and in any case we should remember to take account of its countless future members, the lives and flourishing of which will depend on the swamp's continued existence. But what is there about the swamp such that its intrinsic value is greater than that of its members (present and future)? Its structural features are certainly interesting, but the value of interestingness is dependent on the states and activities of perceivers, as intrinsic value plausibly is not. It may also give us a sense of harmony with nature, but to this the same remark applies. Its internal stability and integrity are, I should maintain, valuable just because they are necessary for flourishing lives to be lived in it; and the value of its internal diversity surely lies, pace Rodman (EE, 90f.), in promoting its stability, where it does not lie in interest, delight and other observer-related values. The interesting possibility remains that a swamp or forest, like an insect, a fungus or a tree, has a good of its own in a sense appropriate to qualify it for moral standing. Now all homeostatic systems have an inbuilt telos, and might seem to qualify for moral standing on these grounds. Yet there are few who would on this basis accord moral standing to artificial systems like refrigerators, or to such physical systems as Scherer's planet Lifeless, well as it may maintain its own climate. It is where life enters that we detect the presence of value; and, if so, the value is surely contributed to an organic system not be its systematic or structural properties, but by the consistuent lives and their quality. Maybe, though, the developmental tendencies of ecological communities give them a good of their own in a relevant sense (Rodman, EE, 89). Certainly there is value in such communities developing to a natural climax, as in the case of the tropical rain forest cited by Rodman (EE, 99). Yet I am not sure that this does not consist in the value of the lives of the trees, insects, birds, orchids etc. of the climax phase; and it is clearly not a genetically programmed development in the way that the development of natural organisms is. The real test would arise if the community could be dispersed but the lives of all its members could be preserved, without loss to their prospects of flourishing, by inserting each of them into another suitable ecological niche. What of value would be lost? Interest and beauty, perhaps; but the value of</page><page sequence="15">REVIEWS 303 interest and beauty is observer-dependent, or, in Frankena's terms, inherent, not intrinsic. There is also the loss of ecological niches for other organisms, but this is explicable in terms of the loss of the intrinsic value consisting in the flourishing lives of the individual organisms which might have lived there. I am not convinced that there is more. The losses of value just mentioned, however, constitute strong reasons against interfering with the natural com munity and dispersing it in the way described. Indeed there are strong atomist reasons to preserve whatever has the value-linked characteristics mentioned by Rodman; diversity, complexity, integrity, harmony, stability and scarcity. Yet, importantly, none of these confer intrinsic value on the entities which instantiate them, or such value would be present wherever these characteristics are found in the inanimate realm as well as in that of the living; and this implication is strongly counterintuitive. Ecological Sensibility, says Rodman (EE, 91), is holistic in a special sense. He does not have in mind deference to Leopold's master-principle, as for him this is just one among others. Rather he intends the way in which this position unifies environmental and social issues, respecting, for example, the importance of diversity in both cases. But this is also a quality of the largely atomistic environmental ethic put forward by Scherer (and of the even more atomistic system defended in The Ethics of Environmental Concern by myself). In the editors' introduction it is remarked that the further an environmental ethic diverges from the "established paradigm", the harder it is to articulate it. But if the four movements compared by Rodman or the three positions contrasted by Callicott count as paradigms, then there is no good reason to hold that paradigms are unamenable to rational comparisons, firmly as this may sometimes be stipulated as a matter of definition. The problem is rather that those who argue that familiar concepts (whether right action, obligation or intrinsic value) apply to unfamiliar cases must argue in ways which shows that they really are dealing with familiar concepts rather than substitutes, and that to do this they must argue by means of analogies and disanalogies with received judgements. And, if so, extensionism is mandatory,-at least as a method. What conclusions the method yields about the relative intrinsic value of the flourishing of members of different species is, however, another matter, which cannot be tackled here. IV Part One of this collection introduces the reader to the fundamental debate in environmental ethics at least as well as any other, but is defective through the lack of representation of the different approach of Tom Regan, much castigated here by Callicott and Rodman, and of anything from the Routleys. It is also strange that there is so little discussion of the principal continuous philosophical text on the subject, John Passmore's Man's Responsibility for</page><page sequence="16">304 REVIEWS Nature,15 and a pity that there is nothing by Mary Midgley or Stephen Clark. Indeed users of Part One should be encouraged to read it in tandem with the papers in Part Two of Environmental Philosophy16 by Rolston, Midgley, Clark and Mary Anne Warren. Part Two of the present collection is much less satisfactory, despite its brighter moments, being largely anthropocentric and mostly written as if the debate in Part One had never been thought of. Papers could surely have been found which considered the bearing of diverse ecological postures (e.g. the "deep" and the "shallow") on ecological problems, or discussed diverse grounds for wilderness preservation etc., as do the papers of C.A. Hooker and Janna L. Thompson in Environmental Philosophy. That collection is, indeed, in general more academically challenging than the present one, to the extent that textual errors (concentrated, I fear, in my own contribution) allow. If the debates on environmental ethics are to receive the wide circulation which they deserve, the two collections should be read and studied together, alongside the relevant works of Passmore, Regan, the Routleys and others mentioned above.
