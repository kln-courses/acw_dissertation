<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAMUEL DAVIES AND CALVINIST POETIC ECOLOGY JEFFREY H. RICHARDS Old Dominion University In The Environmental Imagination, Lawrence Buell considers a number of nonfiction prose writers in the era of Thoreau and beyond in order to detect evidence of an ecological consciousness in American letters. His specific interest has to do with what he calls "literary ecocentrism," a textual understanding of nature that puts it above human concerns. For Buell, there is a kind of paradox that develops through nineteenth- and twentieth-century environmental writing: the creation of an aesthetic of human removal (nature viewed as non-anthropo?entric) that comes from considering the natural world in its human-like subjectivity. In the end, it is not just "nature" that he seeks in literary works, but an awareness of the necessity for reorienting the consciousness of American and other readers toward new, sometimes radically new, forms of relationship to the bio sphere. The multiple strands of The Environmental Imagination pose chal lenges to readers of creative texts on nature, including a recognition of the role of pastoral in both the politics and anti-politics of ecological affirma tion. Thoreau is Buell's touchstone, a nineteenth-century transitional figure whose many writings on nature, including Waiden, mark a key shift in the movement toward literary ecocentrism. Buell's contribution to criticism is to move discussion of American works out of the old romantic naturalism school and into considerations of literary activism. Because his commentary on colonial America is relatively limited, how ever, Buell leaves open a number of questions one might ask of writers before Thoreau, including writers of different genres, in terms of the con nections among literary form, historical position, and ideology. For ex ample, can one talk of "ecology" or "ecocentrism" at all when the texts are poems and the author is an eighteenth-century Presbyterian preacher in rural Virginia? The origin of the term ecology, like other eco- words, is the Greek oikos, house, with the implication of a system of household order, as in economy. The modern understanding of the science of ecology is that nature constitutes a vast and complex system, or set of overlapping sys tems, and that the student of ecology is one whose task is to comprehend how the various parts of the system fit together. As a concept, ecology has inspired dispassionate scientific inquiry, passionate politics that challenge 29</page><page sequence="2">30 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 human hegemony, even theological debate about the relationship of the religious to the natural order. On the surface, it would seem far removed from an individual whose religious orientation is Calvinist, whose model of poetic form is the rhymed couplet, and whose European-American con temporaries are, unconsciously or not, exploiting the vast tracts of land available to them for personal and colonial wealth, power, prestige. My test case for the uncovering of a possible ecological or protoeco logical consciousness will be Samuel Davies, a Presbyterian minister in Virginia's Hanover County, whose 1752 book Miscellaneous Poems, Chiefly on Divine Subjects and newspaper and periodical verse constitute one of the largest such bodies of work extant from eighteenth-century Calvinist ministers in the South. Davies is not the only southern cleric, dissenter or otherwise, to write verse in the eighteenth century. James Sterling, William Dawson, Jonathan Boucher, James Reid, and Josiah Smith are but some of those with ministerial training or theological interests who, during their years in southern colonies, turned to the muse for self-expression. But Davies is distinctive for bringing a religious perspective to nearly all his poetry. Strongly influenced both by the nature poetry of James Thomson and the theology of John Calvin, the Virginian dissenter, in a more forth right manner than many of his contemporaries, uses nature as an image, symbol, or theme in a number of poems and finds himself caught in a thicket of ideological and literary contradictions from which he has diffi culty extricating himself. In his struggles within individual poems, Davies indicates to his readers that nature means something more than a set back drop or a mere pastoral excuse for dipping the quill, thus allowing us to probe his work for sympathies that might be said to be ecocentric.1 Given the popularity of his poems among transatlantic communities?Anglican Virginian planters and English dissenters among them?and his mixture of direct natural observation, theology, and literary influence, Davies is more than a random choice for such an inquiry.2 As a writer on nature, Davies joins a growing band of Americans who take the world they inhabit as something other than a howling wilderness or a list of exploitable commodities. As Pamela Regis has described, after mid-century, such prose writers as William Bartram and J. Hector St. John de Cr?vecoeur turn to the more systematic and exacting descriptions of the landscape pioneered by Linnaeus and other rationalist natural histori ans. Despite the critical tendency to read Bartram's Travels or Cr?vecoeur's Letters from an American Farmer as narrative literature, Regis argues that the new sensibility is primarily a scientific one. Of Cr?vecoeur's Letter 10, for example, on hummingbirds and snakes?a chapter that inspires specu lation about its allegorical significance?Regis notes that "The mode of presentation here is still natural historical and the rhetoric recognizably objective, for all of the anthropomorphic tendencies we can discern in the</page><page sequence="3">Calvinist Poetic Ecology 31 narrator's perceptions of these animals" (119). These prose writers seek after language and genres that allow them to present nature in America as a system of related objects, while still shaping their texts with narra tive structures. Such writing anticipates later strides by more ecologically minded writers such as Thoreau; but for Davies, the better choice of form, because richer for his era in natural description, was poetry. Davies is better seen as one of several colonial American writers incor porating images from nature into verse. His most important predecessor as a Calvinist poet reflecting on nature is Anne Bradstreet, whose "Con templations" reflects some of the same tensions in Davies's work. On the one hand, staring at the autumnal foliage, Bradstreet can announce, "Rapt were my sences at this delectable view," only later to clarify that all things in nature "shall darken, perish, fade and dye" (167, 172). As Rob Wilson points out, however, Bradstreet restrains her depiction of rapture, never allowing herself as poet to exclaim over the scene before her in the broader expressive range conjured by Davies.3 With Bradstreet, as charming as some of her scenes are, nature's physical reality does not press on the poetry with quite the same insistence as it does with the later poet; never theless, for both writers, nature often functions as a source of spiritual lessons or as a point of departure for the internal life. In Bradstreet's case, trees and other living things take their place in a system of godly designs: nothing corporeally alive can last. The impress of that understanding mat ters only to God and humankind. Davies's nearer contemporaries seek more immediate poetical relation ships with the landscape (Bradstreet, after all, never quite sees the Mas sachusetts she appears to describe, layering the scene with English birds). Susanna Wright, a Quaker contemplative poet from Pennsylvania, has re course to natural imagery in describing human thought and experience. Her poem "A Meditation" (ca. 1720) follows Jonah in the whale as "Down to the Bottom of the boundless Flood" he goes, a "Rebel," and therefore missing the "shining Plains &amp;c coral Groves" through which the whale passes (120). For Wright, whom Catherine Blecki identifies as a more sophisticated poet than Davies, nature is a source of metaphor and the loss of Eden a register of humanity's confrontation with pain and conse quent labor (Blecki 81-83). More intricately, that loss-of-Eden motif ap pears in a complex and as yet unpublished poem, "The Grove," in which Wright confronts the philosophical implications of the cutting of a clus ter of trees.4 The opening lines, "The Darling Grove in Native Verdure Gay / The Growth of years Demolished in a Day," indicates the poet's sym pathetic identification with the natural scene and her preparation of the reader for the recognition that, as with Bradstreet in "Contemplations," nothing in nature after the expulsion from the garden can last. Even so, Wright, like Davies, lingers longer over the pleasures of nature and the</page><page sequence="4">32 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 place of it in the larger cosmic scheme than Bradstreet. The Quaker poet is able to see as well as meditate on the materiality and aesthetic imag ing of the grove, then move into questions of relation, from the sight of "Neibouring Boughs in freindly Comfort Joyn'd / to Break the Blasts of unrelenting wind, / from Sumer Suns to form a Shadowie Scene / of Rising Banks &amp; Level Beds of Green" to the questions posed by the scene itself: "As Nature prompted &amp;C as Reason Taught / of each Efect the Latent Cause had Sought / to try the utmost Stretch of Humane thought." What she comprehends from nature, and from the destruction of the grove, is the sudden thwarting of all human plans and desires in their bloom: "So I (If my Prophetic Soul foresee / Ere noon of Life the Scatterd Grove Shal be." Thus the call to the muse of pastoral early in the poem is reversed at the end?"Leave of[f] fond Muse Leave of[f] the rural day"?for a recogni tion that vernal nature, for all its beauties and evocations of the earthly paradise, can be destroyed in an instant. Nevertheless, what remains is not only the lesson, but the images of the grove itself, as if calling "Hapless Humane-kind" to remembrance of its connection to the literal trees. Wright's contemporary Richard Lewis, writing in Maryland nearly two decades before Davies, extends colonial poets' ability to recreate natu ral scenes at greater length before recourse to the inevitable allegory of origins. As will be discussed further below, Lewis shares with the Vir ginian an interest in the Thomsonian sublime, and in overall approach comes closer to Thomson than Davies. For the first two hundred lines of "A Journey from Patapsko to Annapolis, April 4,1730," the poet de tails the nature he observes in his one-day travel. With Lewis, individual plant and bird species are worth naming and putting into ecological con text, in a specific place at a particular time: pines, savanna, streams, and shrubs form a single unit (662), for instance; in another case, seven differ ent species of tree and plant all combine to mix their scents (663). More than most American religious poets before Davies, Lewis lingers in the concrete, allowing the observer-poet to take extended pleasure at the vari ous scenes, vernal and tempestuous. Only in the last half of the poem do living scenes become abstract lessons, as the poet replays his day's jour ney as an allegory of human life. Though there is no question that Lewis, like Davies, seeks the principle behind nature, he shows the possibilities in evocation of natural history; "TREMENDOUS GOD" is apostrophized, but he only once vaguely invokes "the Son of Man" (667). Lewis, whose personal background is somewhat obscure, follows a deistic path?"sci entific deism" as Leo Lemay calls it (Lemay 140). More immediately than Davies would appear to do, Lewis points the way to a post-Calvinist admi ration for nature that includes the possibility of worship through it to the "omniscient Power" that is its cause.5 Closer to Davies in time and belief is William Livingston, author of Philo</page><page sequence="5">Calvinist Poetic Ecology 33 sophical Solitude (1747). Livingston, a Yale graduate with basically Calvin ist principles, celebrates his rural New York retreat as a rejection of urban culture and corruption, but is somewhat less concrete than Lewis in natu ral description. As for both Davies and Lewis, not to mention Bradstreet and Wright, nature for Livingston is a lens through which to perceive the divine: "None but a Pow'r omnipotent and wise / Could frame this earth, or spread the boundless skies"; as in Wright, the seas abound with "coral groves," with the others, "the warblers sing, / And praise their maker" (23). For Livingston, however, the ecology of his poem includes culture, primarily literary and philosophical, and the friends to join him in appre ciating it: Milton, Pope, Watts, Newton, are identified in Philosophical Soli tude as among the favored authors of those happy few who will share the scene with the poet. Livingston, too, in the Thomsonian tradition identi fies death in Arcadia also?indeed, all these visions of nature are distinctly postlapsarian?but that is only a short interlude in an otherwise celebra tory poem. Perhaps the relatively slight focus (that is, for a Calvinist poem) on mortality and God as a threatening power may have accounted for the great popularity of Livingston's poem; it went through nine editions before the turn of the century. However much Davies may or may not have read Livingston or other American poets, he was one of several who combined more than dismis sive glances at natural phenomena with a religious sensibility. Davies, a Log College graduate and associate of the Tennents and Samuel Blair, had an education that allowed him both authority at home and some conver sance with intellectual life abroad. As with his contemporary Livingston, he knew at first or second hand the works of Locke and Newton; was well read in Pope and Milton; and quotes or alludes to major texts of other contemporary British writers, notably James Thomson, Edward Young, Isaac Watts, and Elizabeth Rowe.6 Davies's theology was moderate New Light; recognizably "Puritan" in content, his beliefs were often cast in a Great Awakening emotionalism that expressed grief at the potential loss of saving grace but never omitted to recall the significance of reason in ordering the mind and soul for apprehension of the divine plan. He also spent most of his brief career?he died before he was forty?in the rural South, where nature in its profusion would have been everywhere in evi dence. His neighbors, taken broadly, included some of the "Chesapeake gentlemen" of whom Carl Bridenbaugh has remarked, "Nowhere in the Western World did the rural phase of the Enlightenment evoke such active responses as among certain of this responsible aristocracy" (52). While his Calvinism gave him his grounding, Davies's social being would have been influenced in some measure by contact with people who read in the polite literature of the day but who also participated vigorously in activities fos tered by extensive land ownership and relative proximity to wilderness. At</page><page sequence="6">34 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 some level, then, Davies understood (if not necessarily shared a belief in) nature in the terms of his landholding?and, in many cases, slaveholding? neighbors: as something immediate and vital and significant, a realm that had daily meaning as the locus of prosperity or destruction.7 In addition to his immediate surroundings in Hanover County, Davies's vision of the natural world was shaped by his choice of poetic influences. For a writer in the mid-eighteenth century, form goes a long way in de termining content or stress, but for Davies, form struggles with content. Like George Herbert or his dissenting clerical predecessors, those poeti cizing men of the cloth, Davies wrote poetry for meditational purposes, to allow himself, as with Edward Taylor, to contemplate the topic of a ser mon in a more personal way than the public prose preachment. Davies writes more about nature, generally speaking, in poems than in sermons, and as a consequence, it seems prudent to examine Davies's appropriation of and relation to his chief poetic sources, particularly those that influence how he confronts nature in his own poems. The result of this approach will be to query how an ecological consciousness might evolve from the combination of source, form, and personal observation and experience. Along with Lewis, whose pastoral "A Journey from Patapsko to An napolis" is one of the first American works to reflect the Scottish bard (Lemay 148), Davies owes a considerable debt to James Thomson. That poet's long, Miltonic work, The Seasons, appeared as a complete text in 1730, a copy of which Davies must have owned or had easy access to. Although Davies might have acquired the book or known of it before he came to Virginia, Thomson was an author widely available and read in the southern colonies. As Richard Beale Davis notes, "The colonial south erner, as an out-of-doorsman, may have enjoyed The Seasons for its de piction of, or at least reaction to, physical environment" (Colonial in). Interestingly, Thomson himself began his career as a divinity student at the then College of Edinburgh, training to be a Presbyterian minister. He gave that up to venture to London and find another kind of fame, as a poet. Before the publication of the first part of The Seasons, "Winter," in 1726, Thomson worked as a tutor in an academy run by Isaac Watts, the great dissenting hymn writer and, coincidentally, apostle of Newtonian science. What Thomson presented to the Virginian was a number of things that Davies would have found congenial: a sense of God reared (if not always expressed) in Calvinist orthodoxy; time spent in rural places, details of which are thickly woven in The Seasons; a feeling of awe, indeed, of the sublime, in creation; a belief in the power of reason and science to aid in the apprehension of God's majesty; and a concomitant desire to read nature poetically, that is, as a system of signs, metaphors, metonyms, and allegories, that reveal other, frequently moral and religious truths.8</page><page sequence="7">Calvinist Poetic Ecology 35 The matter of the sublime complicates both Davies's use of Thomson and the way in which moderns read eighteenth-century texts for attitudes toward nature. There is a considerable literature on the sublime, particu larly on its appearance in Britain, with much of it using as a seminal text Edmund Burke's A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756).9 Dayies, of course, was writing before Burke; he might have imbibed ideas of the sublime from earlier writers like Joseph Addison or Milton, or possibly from the inspiration for many British writings on the sublime, Longinus, whose work Peri Hypsous had been translated into English earlier in the century. Rob Wilson identifies elements of the perception of lofty things in Bradstreet and Livingston in his study of the American sublime and by implication suggests a tradition in which Davies might have participated (67-113). But for Davies, the most likely influence for writing in the sublime mode would be Thomson. As David B. Morris observes, Thomson incorporates the dimension of terror in his Seasons, an inspiration to the sublime later identified by Burke as the chief source, but one that Morris suggests is the factor that prevents Thom son from being read simply as a Deist. Thus, Thomson's seeing "Nature and God [as] mysteriously terrible as well as benevolent" is the key to a "religious sublime" (Morris 141). The chief problem with focusing intently on the poetic sublime, from the perspective of literary ecology, is the tendency to reduce natural ob servation either to psychology or aesthetics only. Thus the perceiver is in spired to an apprehension of the sublime that fundamentally obliterates the material scene before him or her for the effect of the scene on con sciousness. For Burke and later writers, the sublime becomes primarily an aesthetic category, part of a theory for interpreting scenes through a sys tematic analysis of their constituent parts. What Davies appears to have derived from Thomson, however, is a more complex understanding of rela tion that incorporates elements of the individual, the divine, the rhetorical package (poetics), and the peculiarities of natural systems taken as such. Given the extensive debates in the eighteenth century on the meaning of the sublime, it is not surprising that Davies had trouble resolving how to render nature in the sublime mode. At the same time, however, one must take caution against only seeking for the sublime in his poetry, at the ex pense of some other understandings of how nature can be apprehended by a Calvinist who reads Newton and Locke and shares a culture that sees in nature forms of relation (even if only Linneaian) unimagined the century before. Among other influences, Alexander Pope deserves at least a brief men tion. Pope's power as a shaper of poetic taste was extraordinary; for an essential amateur like Davies, living where libraries and literati would have</page><page sequence="8">36 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 been few, the Augustan manner, much celebrated in the British literary journals and newspapers read in America, would have been too pervasive for a colonial to resist or contest. Not only does Davies overtly refer to Pope (most frequently to the "Essay on Criticism") in his preface and in his poems, but he also largely adopts rhymed couplets as his poetic unit of choice. Even in poems where he takes on a Thomsonian theme, he for the most part puts those green thoughts in a Popean package. Davies, who, as a hymn writer in imitation of Thomson's one-time employer Watts, would have required rhyme anyway, may have also felt that the containment, the order, of the couplet form allowed him to assert a measure of control over material that he feared he could not in blank verse. What holds true for Pope also holds for Davies: "What the artist has to produce is a shapely expression of unshapely material," recognize the forces and elements that tend to chaos, but give them expression in an orderly package (Ehrenpreis 235). Pope's critique of overwrought sublimity in "Peri Bathos" would also have served for Davies as a corrective to thoughtless adoption of the sub lime as a mode. In any event, Davies borrowed heavily from both Thomson and Pope in creating his own southern Presbyterian poetics. That choice of those two poets alone creates conflict. For Pope, natural description means georgic, with couplets in the manner of John Denham's "Coopers Hill" (1668). For Thomson, the georgic mode still holds to some degree, but by using blank verse, that poet relies more on structural ele ments than versification for establishing concepts of relation between the human and the natural. By placing together Pope's nature poem "Windsor Forest" (1713) with Thomson's first season, "Winter," Ralph Cohen shows that "If for Pope the end rhymes are forms of witty repetition of sound and sense, for Thomson, the cyclical pattern of the seasons provides the under lying harmony of nature." In "Windsor Forest," Pope provides couplings both between lines and within lines of "contrasting physical places" that indicate the overall "metaphysical harmony" exemplified by his choice of subject. Thomson, meanwhile, incorporates a recursive perceiver, scientific terminology, and a larger natural?not purely poetic?pattern (Cohen 85). By choosing Pope for form, Davies selects devices that bring orderliness to a subject in a variety of poetic rhetorical ways, but almost always by the second line of a couplet. By selecting Thomson for theme and man ner, Davies can choose to indulge disorder further, see where it leads, but inevitably find it clash with the demands of couplets. For Davies, there is a clear tension then between the embrace of nature as a large and complex system and the relative simplicity of couplet form; at the same time, there is another tension, that between two essential truths. On the one hand, he strongly believes in the systematic wholeness of cre ation, the perception of which is actuated by an inborn principle:</page><page sequence="9">Calvinist Poetic Ecology 37 There is in almost all Mankind an innate Love of Harmony; which gives those Things that are conveyed to their Minds in a poetical Vehicle a pecu liar Relish. This harmonious Turn of Mind is the Stamp of Heaven, the Image of the eternal Author of Order; and 'tis He that teaches us to feel the Charms of Poetry.10 For Davies, poetry?in particular, in forms such as the Pindaric ode and the iambic couplets favored by Pope and his generation?is a reflection and an expression of the universal system, ordered by the harmony-loving and creating God. As a literary mode governed strictly by attention to sound, rhythm, accent, beginnings, and endings, poetry represents a means by which the minister-writer can encompass in form a doctrine that con tains harmony. At a minimum, Davies's pursuit of poetry is nothing less than what his seventeenth-century Puritan forbears might have done in their efforts to have the resources of literary methods at their disposal for the purposes of inculcating or learning the faith; but by publishing an en tire book of poetry within three years of beginning his Virginia ministry, he clearly meant verse to be something more than a useful adornment to his preaching methods. George Pilcher notes that "the purpose of his verse, like his prose, was primarily to encourage people to seek salvation" (39), "to lure men from sin" (42). Even so, Davies's poetry also calls his readers to pay some attention to the world in which they find themselves and to query the relationship they maintain with a nature that is at once beautiful and threatening. In the context of the passage above and other works, "Harmony" is a poetical term in Dfavies that signifies a protoecological principle of inter relationship. For the eighteenth century, harmony would signify many things, all related to the original Greek sense of the word in joining, con cord, fitting together. In addition to its general meaning, harmony has specific application to music, aesthetics, and religion, among other uses. Isaac Watts employs the term in The Harmony of All the Religions Which God Ever Prescribed (1742) to indicate a unity created out of difference among Adamical, Noahical, Abrahamical, Mosaical, and Christian "dis pensations" through the conversion of the Jews (1-40). Other writers in corporate a more technical meaning, the linkage of the four Gospels into a single agreeable narrative or collation. Davies as a Christian and poet could find multiple reasons for invoking harmony, and to some extent one may assume in his work a kind of harmony of harmonies. Thus, to write about the natural world means to find a language and theology, as well as a poetics, that allows one with an eye on the next world to find some concord in this. In terms of Davies's literary borrowings, harmony is also a word much</page><page sequence="10">38 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 favored by Thomson. In fact, Davies in his preface to Miscellaneous Poems quotes a passage from "Spring"?deleted in Thomson's post-1730 edi tions?that expresses concisely the significance of harmony to a total view of nature: 'Tis HARMONY, that World-attuning Pow'r, By which all Beings are adjusted, each To all around, impelling, and impell'd, In endless Circulation, that inspires This universal Smile. Thus the glad Skies, The wide-rejoicing Earth, the Woods, the Streams, With every LIFE they hold, down to the Flow'r That paints the lowly Vale, or Insect-Wing Wav'd o'er the Shepherd's Slumber, touch the Mind To Nature tun'd, with a light-flying Hand, Invisible?, (qtd. Davies, MP iv-v)11 For Thomson, says Alan McKillop, this passage indicates that apprehen sion of the world by sensory means is conjoined to "a record of poetic rev erie," leaving the poet with the belief that the "world order" can be grasped "in the immediacy of sense experience." Although Thomson's voice may claim to see God in the harmonies he observes, McKillop continues, "He is not, however, to be identified with the pattern or organism of the world" (41, 42). Whatever Thomson's actual theological principles, how ever, Davies cannot afford to let his use of such terms indicate only vaguely the presence of the divine. Like the Scot, the Virginian identifies percep tion of the universal with the consciousness of the individual, yet he also would have us see harmony as something directly connected to godhead. The perceiver has an innate "Love of Harmony," which implies the exis tence of harmony itself as part of the universal frame. What Davies does not clarify immediately, however, is the connection among God, harmony, and nature itself. But one might infer at least something in Davies from what Thomson's mentor Watts states in two short essays from Miscellaneous Thoughts, "A Meditation for the First of May" and "Divine Goodness in the Creation" (Watts 519-21). In the first, Watts follows the natural order up the usual ladder of being, but makes clear that human apprehension of that order is not in itself something ultimate. In the body of an insect is "An exqui site world of wonders" while "The active powers and curiosity of human nature are limited in their pursuit." Further, "It is a sublime and constant triumph over all the intellectual powers of man, which the great God main tains every moment in these inimitable works of nature, in these impene trable recesses and mysteries of divine art!" (519) Yet at the same time as he takes a scientific interest in the wonders of nature and acknowledges</page><page sequence="11">Calvinist Poetic Ecology 39 their immense complexity, Watts states a conventional Christian view that "All that we see above us, and all beneath us, is suited to our nourish ment or to our delight" (520). For the scientifically minded Christian of the eighteenth century, ecocentrism comes hard: approached by the newly understood sense of complexity of natural systems, it is avoided by the in sistence that nature serves human need primarily through the production of food and shelter. In his preface to Miscellaneous Poems, Davies augments his picture of na ture's revelation of interconnectedness with a passage from another source, the poet and fictional moralist Elizabeth Singer Rowe. Her connection to American Puritanism dates back at least to 1699, the year she met Benjamin Colman of Boston during his sojourn in England and during a time she was writing poems under the name Philomela, many of which were collected in Poems on Several Occasions (1696) (Chapman). She inhabited dissent ing circles, among whose members were Isaac Watts and Frances Thynne, Countess of Hertford (Grieder 5-6; Richetti 522). Her most important works were Friendship in Death and Letters Moral and Entertaining (1728 1732), epistolary fictions that included letters from the dead and clearly Christian poems and which were dedicated to the poet Edward Young, au thor of Night Thoughts, another influence on Davies. Like Thomson and Young, Rowe worked elements of the sublime into her works, but in a context that was compatible with dissenter theology. Indeed, Davies's very choice of Rowe as a source suggests his consciousness of a system of trans atlantic connections among himself and other American Christian writers and those whom he credits with infusing poetry with devotion?Rowe, Watts, Thomson, Young?and a harmony of styles and beliefs that reso nate with his own interest in linkages among terrestrial and extraterrestrial phenomena. In addition to the passage from "Spring," Davies quotes a poem from Rowe's Letters Moral and Entertaining to explicate his understanding of harmony: From Harmony to Harmony we rise, To that superior Skill which turn'd the Spheres; Th' inspiring GOD dwells in the mystic Sound, And charms and captivates the list'ning Soul, Thro' all her soft Capacities of Joy. (qtd. Davies, MP iv)12 As with his own explanation of the "innate Love of Harmony," Rowe iden tifies the term as being connected to poetry and therefore music: a gift from God, in dissenter logic, for the greater glory of God. In the broader context of the fictional letter in which the poem appears, the writer, Phi lander, a deist, tells his correspondent, Eusebius, that the latter has been</page><page sequence="12">40 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 correct to urge him to see "That there is a GOD all nature cries aloud through all her works" (Rowe, Letters Moral, part 1, 22). Rowe herself was an early reader of Thomson, and in a later letter, not specifically cited by Davies, the writer Rosalinda speaks happily of her new rural surround ings by exclaiming, "A more agreeable situation cannot be imagined, nor a greater variety of sylvan scenes described in poetry, unless Mr. Thomson's SPRING and SUMMER Seasons could rise in one enchanting prospect" (Letters Moral, part 2, 4).13 In essence Davies asserts, as does Rowe, that the poetical union of vision effected by a Thomson may indeed be superior to one's own ability to see nature directly, especially where that vision has not been trained to see the pattern behind the details. In other words, both poetry and nature are systems, the one growing from, even informing, the other.14 On the other hand, that "innate love of Harmony" coexists with a terror of chaos. In his poem "Separation from GOD the most intolerable Punish ment," attached to a sermon delivered on 13 January 1750/51, he expresses in a rare blank verse effort the anxiety of one whose desire for felicity with the creator may be thwarted by human inadequacy: But gloomy Guilt obscures the glimm'ring Hope; Whispers a thousand Horrors, and forebodes Eternal Separation from Thy Face, In the waste Realms where Desolation frowns, Unconscious of Thy Smiles. Tremendous Thought! Oh! Horrors! Horrors!?An immortal Soul, With ever-gnawing and immense Desires, Torn off from all the Pleasures Sense can yield, Without GOD! Without a Drop of Bliss To quench her raging Thirst! Cursed from the Earth, A restless Fugitive thro' the dark Voids Of boundless space, and the thick Glooms of Hell! (MP 114-15)15 The poet stares terror-struck at the reality that there is no harmony with out God, no order, no meaningful end. Even so, both harmony and chaos coexist, both present, both always actuated by human souls?the one by a nearly romantic sense of union with an otherwise rationally expressed de sign of the "Great Author of this Glorious ALL!" ("Philosophic Devotion," MP 10), the other by sin, by guilt, by acts of separation that divide the human individual from "the parental Mind." The task here, then, is to de termine the degree of ecological consciousness possible for one who holds these coincident beliefs and to discover what it means to frame thoughts about nature in poetry.</page><page sequence="13">Calvinist Poetic Ecology 41 One thing must be stated clearly: Davies cannot?or rather, does not wish?to imagine nature outside of principles ordained by God. In the first poem of his collection, "Lord Thou knowest all Things," he establishes the basis for his observation of nature: Say, Great OMNISCIENT! (for Thou know'st my Heart) Can Nature ease my Soul, if Thou depart? No! all Creation dwindles to a Toy, And Heav'n itself could not excite my Joy. The chearful Sun glares hateful to my Eyes, And every blooming Beauty round me dies. (MP 3-4) Such a statement, seemingly unequivocal, creates problems both for reader and poet. Davies seems not to want to recognize nature as a system at all, without the presence of God; but Reformed tradition denies the literal in corporation of God in nature anyway. Nevertheless, he leaves available the possibility that nature can be reconstituted as a system of harmonies in consciousness in the perception of "chearful Sun" and "blooming Beauty." True enough, as American poets from Bradstreet on have reminded us, all things in creation are mortal; but Davies's choice of words indicates that nature holds a certain attraction that is not in itself an inspiration to evil. Modern ecologists would not be bothered by death itself; it is part of the system whereby decay of one individual is nourishment for another. For Davies in this poem, the central concern is the poet's particular relation to nature, not nature of itself. At the same time, he betrays his own interest in nature, fearing, perhaps, its systemic attractions to one taught to abjure chaos. In other poems, and like his model Thomson and his near-contemporary Lewis, Davies enjoys lingering awhile on certain natural scenes. In a poem addressed to "two young ladies" entitled "Early Piety Recommended," he links spring and youth in the cluster-of-images manner of Thomson: The tuneful Birds, that hail the welcome Spring, Grateful at Nature's Restoration sing, And all the Groves with charming Music ring: A living Green arrays the Woods and Fields, And the sweet Vale a thousand Pleasures yields: The lovely Family of Flow'rs appear, And breathe Perfumes thro' balmy Air: The Sun shines bright and mild; the gentle Breeze Regales our Sense, and whispers thro' the Trees: The wide Creation smiles; Earth, Sky and Air In vernal Robes and blooming Youth appear. (8)</page><page sequence="14">42 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 Again, as with Thomson, although winter comes to remind us emblemati cally of the limits of temporality, the point is that recognition of beauties of the natural world is not at odds per se with a Calvinist belief in an over whelming God. While nature is not godhead, creation reflects the range of God's lessons, from cheer to fear; in short, it is not to be ignored or written away. For as a poet, he too creates, in emulation of the primary cause; and God, then, as in "Philosophic Devotion," is "Great Author of this Glorious ALL!" (10). In his most interesting philosophical poem, "Solomon," Davies makes the Hebrew king his voice for a review of what the world has to offer as a stimulus to bliss. We need not be surprised by the conclusion; like the later Paul Tillich, who systematically dismisses groundedness in heteronomy (things) in order to assert the same in theonomy at the end,16 Davies has his Solomon echo Ecclesiastes in calling the things of this world "Vanity of Vanities." Nevertheless, Solomon is drawn greatly to nature and betrays the tension evident in any budding Calvinist ecologist: Perpetual Spring, her numerous Beauties strew'd Thro' all my Groves, and blest the waving Wood. Refreshing Rills, thro' various Pipes convey'd, Their chearing Moisture thro' all the pleasant Wild. Here oft' I walk'd in sacred Solitude, And, unmolested, Happiness pursu'd;? In vain; for Happiness cou'd not be found Among the Groves in this delightful Ground. (16) Davies leaps quickly and perfunctorily to his conclusion; a Calvinist Chris tian, he is obliged to show the limits of the material to provide comfort, but the passage is perhaps the most comforting in the whole poem. As with the analogous phrases in "Lord Thou knowest all things," he anticipates Emer son and Thoreau in seeing "chearing moisture" while walking in "sacred solitude" in a natural setting. Indeed, once again, Davies openly acknowl edges the beauty of earth and its implicit interconnectedness. Although he does not go as far as Watts in describing the complexities of even the smallest elements in creation, he does suggest that life is a wonder and ap preciation of it a natural, even good thing to do?as long as nature itself, or other material pleasure, does not substitute in human consciousness for the last knowledge available only in faith in God. Davies does not fully resolve the difficulty he creates for himself; although he measures faith by eternity over temporality, he also leaves signs in his poems of his desire to retreat, to find in the woods and fields of Hanover County, which he had to traverse on his way to one or another of the seven churches he serviced, the sacral. There is a Newtonian Aristotelianism in Davies?"To Thee the universal</page><page sequence="15">Calvinist Poetic Ecology 43 Cause, / Whence Nature her Existence draws" ("The Soul early estranged from its Divine Parent," MP 42)?that also contends with Platonic lan guage?"The Charms of Nature in her fairest Dress / Are but faint Copies of Thy fairer Face" ("Whom Have I in Heaven but Thee?" MP 51). Each of these strands, the scientific/rationalist and philosophical, contends in turn with the evangelical desire to render all existence as subordinate to the drama of individual human salvation. Whenever he broaches the causal relation or begins to see in nature evidence through imitation of the divine, though, he steps back, as if he fears he has gone too far. In the same poem, he can exclaim in anticipation of Walt Whitman, "Thus Mortals read some Letter of thy Name, / On every Pin in this amazing Frame" (53), and cry out, as a desperate Calvinist, "If Thou art absent, every Place is Hell" (54). The best compromise he can reach is to join both God and nature simul taneously: "The borrowed Beauties of Thy Works but raise / The restless Pant to view Thy brighter Face" (53). Davies's approach-avoidance pattern toward nature is evident especially in poems addressed to his wife, Jane (or Jean) Holt Davies, whom he calls Chara. He praises her beauty and celebrates their love as one that expresses the overarching plan of Harmony in the natural order: 'Tis Love adjusts this fair harmonious World; On Wheels of Love the heavenly Spheres are whirl'd, Ten Thousand Systems round Ten Thousand Suns, Impell'd by Love, each in its Orbit runs. What's the Attractive or Projectile Force, But Love well-ballanc'd, to direct their Course? Love, the great Cement of the Universe, That hinders Worlds to conflict and disperse. (56) Davies makes of love a nearly physical force that prevents the onset of chaos, as if a kind of gravity operating against entropy. Harmony, on which Davies spent so much in the preface, is now to be identified with love?"the great Cement of the Universe." In this aspect of his ecological metaphysics, the American diverges from his Scottish source. Buell remarks of The Sea sons that while the impulse of affection for nature is largely humanitarian and therefore anthropocentric, Thomson elevates animal life poetically to a level nearly equal with human beings (224). In other words, Thomson does not require a force such as love to account for interrelationships he depicts over seasons and across species. For Davies, whose domestic re sponsibilities and feelings exert a more concrete influence on his work than one sees in the bachelor Thomson, this embrace of nature through love both insists on human centrality and yet threatens the very ground of his universal harmonics. In the poems to Chara, he approaches his wife in rapturous terms, as</page><page sequence="16">44 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 if leading his readers to a new Song of Solomon, particularly in "Conju gal Love and Happiness" where he shouts in all capitals, "CONNUBIAL LOVE!" Quickly, though, he catches himself: "But here, ah! here a guilty Scene appears!? / . . . Chara, I find Temptations ev'n in thee!" (MP 61). Drawn by Holt's natural beauty and charm, the poet fears this physical attraction will set up a rival god: "Far from my Breast expel? each human Fair; / But Oh! let JESUS reign unrivall'd there" (62). This leads us then to one of the great killjoy passages in American letters: When on the Bridal Day I took thy Hand, And clasp'd thee to me in the nuptial Band, This Thought did mod'rate my Excess of Joy, "Resistless Death this Union will destroy" (63) For the rest of the poem?it continues for five more pages?Davies strug gles with desire for his bride, thoughts of death, and the need to assert a God-ordained order on the chaos he fears awaits him if he loves too much. Being with Chara ironically threatens his faith: "Nature, perverse Nature, will rebel / And o'er my calm and settl'd Thoughts prevail" (66). Thus far from being the cement of the universe, love, of one soul-bearing crea ture for another, is an invitation to dissolution and "separation" from the God whose love provides universal harmony. Inevitably, Davies grounds his perception of a natural system on presence of the divine, but he leaves open the notion that nature may still be considered as a system in its own right?reflecting, after all, the Supreme Planner of the universe?even if it cannot be perceived so by one who centralizes personal salvation. Not surprisingly, perhaps, given what has just been described, Davies's best poems on nature are those of storms. Momentarily, order and chaos, life and death, awe and fear all conjoin in a moment of perceptual har mony. As R. B. Davis notes, Davies shared with contemporary and earlier Calvinists a belief that "awe could produce sublime emotion . . . which might reach the souls of men" (Introduction xix). In "The war of the ele ments," inspired by a storm he witnessed on a transatlantic voyage, Davies draws an expected lesson that the sea is an "inconstant, boistrous element! the Type / Of human Life" (CP 161) but he obviously relishes, as a poet, the release he achieves through depiction of the storm: "The mountains break, in a tumultous [sic] Roar; / The angry foam flies up to Heaven in showers, / And burns and sparkles in the briny Waves" (161). He bor rows the occasional figure from Thomson, who has some compelling foul weather passages, and like the late Lewis, calls up particular storms with romantic fury and power. In "A Description of a Storm, May 9, 1751," Davies allows himself to merge as closely with The Seasons as he ever dares in his verse:</page><page sequence="17">Calvinist Poetic Ecology 45 Still the dire Lightning with malignant Glare In flaming Curves wheels through the Air; Here a fierce Streak of angry Fire Sudden in various Windings cuts the Cloud; Another here, another there Darts on the winking Eye, till all the Hemisphere One wide-expanded Sheet of flashing Flame appear; While Peals on Peals still undistinguish'd crowd, And Heav'n's eternal Cannons roar aloud. (129) Although there are some recognizable couplets, the poem does not con form to a strict end-rhyme structure, reflecting the tempestuous and threat ening image of the violent storm. Davies modulates between concreteness and symbolism, drawing the Calvinist conclusion that such a storm no doubt sends a message to those freighted with sin to mend their ways, while the "guiltless" may enjoy the display of God's power in serenity. Nevertheless, that serenity, which is not only a state of guiltlessness but also an understanding of the principle of harmony, frees one to observe nature in all its rage with the care and the wonder of one for whom the environment writ large is something to be celebrated. The terror that is awe?a dimension of the sublime?can also be read in the poems, however, as the recognition of God's retribution not only on sinners but on nature itself. In "A Description," mentioned above, God is described as riding "On wild unruly Hurricanes and Storms; / While all their most outragious Forms / Tamely obey His mighty Call, / To purge the Air, or shake this guilty Ball, / To scathe the sturdy Oak, or blast audacious Worms" (MP 127). Davies's depiction of a drought during the Seven Years War in "National Judgments deprecated, and National Mercies pleaded" (1756), where "Nature round us fades and dies," suggests that divine maj esty, not ecological cycle, is the cause of nature's untimely withering (CP 166). Most graphically, in "The different States of Sinners and Saints in the Wreck of Nature," the poet makes absolutely clear that nature has no inde pendent power outside of God's pleasure or wrath to sustain itself without Him: "How great, how terrible that GOD, / Who shakes Creation with his Nod! / He frowns, and Earth's foundations shake, / And all the Wheels of Nature break." In the final judgment, he commands his reader, "See Ocean, Earth, all Nature's Frame / Sink in one universal Flame" (CP 164). Davies never abandons his Calvinist training, especially in time of crisis. Even so, as with Susanna Wright in "The Grove," Davies comprehends that rationalist philosophy, scientific natural history, and contemporary poetics contribute to an expanded understanding of the systematic whole ness of creation. To be sure, God wields all the power in this system, but he does so not because he is inscrutable; rather, Davies yields to the</page><page sequence="18">46 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 eighteenth-century thought that it is harmony that underlies the univer sal totality. Perhaps one might go so far as to say that God is harmony, although Davies is never that overt. Harmony may include drought, disas ter, and a fiery end for nature and sin-sick humankind, yes, but in harmony may also be read both poetics and the overall functioning of nature, not to mention the linkage between nature and poetry through the perceiv ing agent, the poet. There are deep contradictions to be found in all this; neither Davies nor any other of the nature poets discussed earlier resolves a universal natural harmonics without an independently functioning deity. Still, the point ought to be made that Calvinism does not in itself preclude the possibility of seeing in nature something more than sign or symbol. Is there in this body of eighteenth-century religious poetry evidence of ecocentrism or ecology? Not precisely, and certainly not as Buell de fines the tradition. In Davies, human existence always supersedes the non human, the next world makes claims over this. But in the combination of Newtonian science, Calvinist wonder, Augustan order, and romantic captivation with nature, Davies evinces the possibility of a literary con sciousness that sees in nature something more engaging than just a howling wilderness?something whose eventual spoliation would be recognized by late twentieth-century eco-theologians as violence against creation and "an offense against the Creator" (Hill 60). Although he never calls for a re envisioning of nature, in light of science, he admires and is influenced by others who do.17 To some extent in Rowe, but more overtly in Watts and Thomson, Davies had models of poets with dissenting principles who took a pleasure in nature that would allow for succeeding generations to re spond differently to the whole of earth as more than merely the scene of mortality and sin. In his attempt to link theology, poetic form and sources, and experience of nature into a single system, Davies sought an expres sion of harmony that at once accounted for the beautiful in the world, was rational, yet could not in itself serve as an end. It is in the contradictions of Davies's poetry, the eagerness to peer behind nature's curtain coincident with the desire to revel in its physicality, that we most see the glimmering of an ecological perception of birds, flowers, and storms. NOTES The author wishes to thank Pattie Cowell for including an earlier version of this piece of an MLA panel; David Shields for suggestions and supplying a copy of Wright's "The Grove"; Michael Clark for valuable criticism of a draft; and Bill Wooldridge and Ellis O'Neal for their interest and support. i. Davies's poetry has received only modest critical attention. Benson, who did not know of Miscellaneous Poems, discusses and reprints the Davies hymns that first appeared in Thomas Gibbons, Hymns adapted to Divine Worship (1769); Gilborn places the poems overall in a religious context; and Pilcher, Samuel Davies: Apostle</page><page sequence="19">Calvinist Poetic Ecology 47 of Dissent, situates poems biographically, in terms of the writer's moderation be tween Anglican rationalism and Whitefieldian emotionalism (35-53). Davis's in troduction to his edition of Collected Poems remains the best overall treatment of Davies's verse as such. Davies was writing at a time when much of the poetry about "nature" was about commercial exploitation of it; on that tradition, see Shields, Oracles, esp. 56-92. 2. Davies's poems were copied and reprinted in newspapers and journals on both sides of the Atlantic, and account books show the diversity of buyers of his Miscellaneous Poems in Virginia (Davis, Introduction xxiii-xxiv). On the history of the printing of his hymns, especially in England, see Benson, 284-86, 343-44, and notes attached to individual hymns, passim. The best account of the immediate reception of his poems in Virginia, with newspaper exchanges, is Gilborn 75-79. 3. Wilson puts Bradstreet in the tradition of the "American Sublime," calling her muse one of "sublimated sublimity" (92). 4. A typescript of this undated poem was made available to me by David Shields, to whom I am grateful. The martial imagery suggests a wartime event (Shields thinks Seven Years War or the Paxton uprising), but because the direct topic is the cutting of trees and the language of mangled limbs a multilayered set of metaphors, the poem to my mind could be dated anywhere from 1720, when Wright was in her early twenties and the date of her earliest poem in the Milcah Martha Moore commonplace book, to the 1760s (Wright died in 1784). 5. Lemay's discussion of Lewis is the first comprehensive one and remains the best overall appreciation of his verse. Among Lewis's influences are many on Davies ?Milton, Denham, and Pope?and one unlikely known to the Virginian, James Ralph's Night (1725). See Lemay 126-84. 6. For a longer list of literary and other influences, consult Gilborn 65-69. 7. Although Davies does not address slavery in the poetry, he was known for his efforts to educate and convert slaves and for speaking to the issue in his ser mons, as detailed by Pilcher, "Samuel Davies and the Instruction of Negroes," and Greenberg. One might also conceive of a larger ecology, a natural social ecology that includes the complex relationships among master, slave, and wilderness. The boundaries of such a discussion, interesting though it might be, would be consider ably expanded beyond what is possible here. 8. In addition to standard reference sources, biographical information on Thom son related to The Seasons can be found in Sambrook ix-xxii and Stockdale. 9. Monk provides the best account of the sublime's introduction into eighteenth century critical vocabulary. Before Burke, frequent references are made in Britain to Longinus, Peri Hypsous, frequently translated as On the Sublime; Joseph Addi son, John Dennis, and others write about the sublime in the first half of the century; Pope, of course, criticizes its excesses. Other useful background sources include Hippie, Morris, Voller, and Wilson. See also, for the generation of American poets before Davies, Shields, "Religious Sublime." 10. Davies, Miscellaneous Poems iv; hereafter abbreviated MP, to distinguish the poems in that published book from those collected by Davis and added to his fac simile edition of the 1752 book, hereafter abbreviated CP. n. Davies's quotation differs only slightly from that reproduced by McKillop (41), the single substantial word change being Davies's "World-attuning Pow'r" and in McKillop, "World-embracing." 12. The original for this passage can be found in Letter 4 of Letters Moral (Rowe, part 1, 23). The ellipsis is mine. 13. Rowe also sent a poem in praise of Thomson's Seasons and the celebra</page><page sequence="20">48 Early American Literature, Volume 35, 2000 tion of rural retreat to Gentleman's Magazine that was published there in 1736 (Hansen 49). 14. By the 1740s, when Davies began writing poetry, Elizabeth Singer Rowe was already being touted as a paragon of virtue. Rowe, a widow for twenty years before her death in 1737, had been highly sought after in her youth by such personages as Watts, Colman, poet Matthew Prior, and the publisher of her early poems?not all of them religious?John Dunton. By the time she began to publish her pious fictions, her reputation for virtue was being well circulated; after her death, there was a virtual hagiographie industry dedicated to elevating her piety and, accord ing to Marlene Hansen, suppressing any sensuality in her earlier work. Yet as John Richetti notes, there are elements of sensuality in the fictions, even if they are re jected when they lead to illicit affairs (524-29). For Davies, the example of Rowe, a writer who had some sense of the power of nature, admired it, but also knew that to keep her reputation had to establish its dangers, would have been compelling. 15. Although this imagining of one's separation from the divine is a standard Puritan exercise, Davies's formulation here goes for extremes not indulged by one of his literary masters, Watts. Cf. "Absence from God, Who Is Our All": "I am even amazed at my own stupidity that I could live so much absent from them, when my eternal all depends upon thee" (Watts 564). 16. Tillich's ideas on groundedness are worked out in several books, among them The Religious Situation (1956), The Protestant Era (1957), Theology of Culture (1964), and Systematic Theology (1965). For a summary of Tillich's theology in the context of Christianity and environmentalism, see Hill 25-31. 17. Samuel Finley, in his sermon on Davies's death, remarks on the Virginian's firmness of belief but openness to new ideas and willingness to admit error when persuaded (Sprague 146).
