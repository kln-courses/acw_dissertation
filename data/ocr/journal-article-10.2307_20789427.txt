<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Cusp of an Era: Art in the Pre-Kusana World. Edited by Doris Meth Srinivasan. Brill's Inner Asian Library, vol. 18. Leiden: Brill, 2007. Pp. vi + 402, plates. $264. All but one1 of the fourteen essays in this volume are based on papers delivered at a symposium at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri (November 11-14, 2000) by a distin guished gathering of international scholars convened and organized by Doris Srinivasan. The title and introduction would lead one to expect much more of an emphasis on art history over a broader 1. The chapter by Jason Neelis, "Passages to India: Saka and Kus?na Migrations in Historical Contexts," appears in the book, but was not presented at the symposium.</page><page sequence="2">506 Journal of the American Oriental Society 129.3 (2009) geographical range than one actually finds among the essays, which are largely concerned with the regions now bounded by Pakistan and Afghanistan, historically known as Gandhara and Bactria.2 Furthermore, the essays primarily present research and findings from archaeological excavations and surface explorations, Buddhist literature, and epigraphy?a commendably interdisciplinary approach, but with very little art history. In general the papers are extremely engaging and present careful and thorough analyses of their topics in eloquent and readable prose indicative of meticulous editing. The volume includes an index, but a bibliography and short biographies of the authors would have been welcome. There is no apparent logic to the order in which the essays have been presented, except that the three papers dealing with regions south of Gandhara appear last and the first two essays concern ancient travel routes. Saifur Rahman Dar lays out the web of roads and passes historically used by travelers to cross the forbidding terrain from Central Asia and Afghanistan to Pakistan and India. Most of us have heard only of the Karakoram Highway or the Khyber Pass through the Hindu Kush, so the author does a great service by revealing such a surprisingly complex array of routes. It is not always clear from which sources the information has been gleaned and how relevant each route was during the Pre-Kus?na period specifically, but art historians and archaeologists will benefit from understanding which sites were actually connected by known travel routes, in order to better argue for the transmis sion of styles and motifs. Jason Neelis's essay provides a welcome clarification of the different branches and lineages of Saka or Scythian rulers and groups who traversed these routes and came to control areas of Pakistan and northern and western India during the Pre-Kus?na and Kus?na periods. He takes a fresh approach by using evidence from graffiti and petroglyphs that survive along the roadsides, in conjunction with epigraphic and literary sources, to elucidate the role of these groups in the transmis sion of Buddhism and the movement of Buddhists across Asia. Two amply illustrated essays on coinage by David W. Mac Dowall present useful synopses of the Pre-Kus?na coin types primarily of Bactria and Gandhara, with some reference to adjacent regions. There is little explanation of terminology, so non-numismatists may have some difficulty following the descriptions. Embedded amidst the historical surveys are important observations and caveats concern ing the appropriate uses of coins in the dating of archaeological strata. Osmund Bopearachchi convincingly argues for the use of the Hellenistic mixed-media acrolithic technique in the case of a splendid Gandharan sculpture, in which marble was used for the head, and the section of torso and arms, while other materials such as wood, clay, and textiles would have been used to create the remainder of a monumental image. Thus, not only were motifs transmitted from the Greco-Roman world, but sculptural methods and materials were adopted to the Buddhist context of Gandhara as well. By focusing on the archaeological excavations at Barikot in Swat, Pierfrancesco Callieri shows how some cities in Gandhara continued to use Hellenistic urban planning even after the defeat of the Indo-Greeks and the abandonment of their Bactrian city of A? Khanoum in 145 b.c.e. Other detailed archaeological reports of excavations at Butkara and Saidu Sharif in Swat, Taxila in Gandhara, and Sonkh in Mathura are presented by Domenico Faccena, Shoshin Kuwayama, and Herbert H?rtel. Such careful descriptions and evidence for chronological developments are useful to have in English, though at times the terminology could be obscure for nonspecialists. These site-specific discussions reveal a remarkable diversity in artistic practice in closely interconnected, contemporaneous establishments. Epigraphist and philologist Richard Salomon grapples with difficult issues concerning the extent and territories of the reigns of some Pre-Kus?na rulers in Gandhara. His article also puts forward linguistic 2. Fourteen papers presented at the symposium do not appear in this volume. They broadened the geographical scope and introduced some more art-historical subjects. For example, S. P. Gupta and Amiteshwar Jha discussed the archaeological findings and coinage from sites along the Gangetic valley and Central India. Kazim Abdullaev, Antonio Invernizzi, and Xinru Liu contributed work pertaining to Parthia and Central Asia. Phyllis Granoff used textual sources to explain why Saiva narrative imagery is not found in the early periods. Art historical analyses of the imagery on the so-called toilet trays and other decorative arts of Gandhara were given by Claude Rapin, Katsumi Tanabe, and Chantal Fabr?gues, and John Twilley presented a scientific and technical evaluation of ancient sandstone.</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books 507 evidence suggesting that a Gandhari inscription written in accomplished Kharosthi calligraphy on the halo of a stone Buddha image could date from the same period as manuscripts and reliquaries that were inscribed during the time of Pre-Kus?na rulers. This allows us to reconsider the possibility that the mature Greco-Roman hybrid style of Gandharan sculpture could be Pre-Kus?na and earlier in date than generally thought. The essay by Gregory Schopen illuminates why Buddhist monks had an interest in embellishing their monasteries with art, and that is, in short, because a beautiful site attracted more visitors and more financial support from the lay community. He draws his evidence from the M?lasarv?stiv?da-vinaya, a monastic code that appears to have been redacted in the region of Gandhara. However, the descrip tions in the text appear to be even more congruent with the architectural and archaeological remains in the Gangetic plains. Overall, this article presents some of the most lucid observations and conclusions concerning the function and context of early Indian art. A comparative discussion with the art and sites of other groups coexisting with the Buddhists would be a welcome continuation to his discussions. Doris Srinivasan devotes much of her essay to cogent arguments for the authenticity of monumental stone sculptures of goddesses from the Mathura region. Like the Bopearachchi article, it draws atten tion to the looting of antiquities in South Asia during the last decades of the twentieth century that will hopefully be curtailed with more stringent international standards on purchasing and collecting. She also brings to bear her literary acumen, with references to rituals associated with serpent divinities in a variety of texts. Pia Brancaccio's keynote lecture from the symposium forms the closing essay, using the evidence of coins and terra cotta "artifacts" to address the varying ways in which occidental forms were received in different regions, notably Gandhara, the Deccan in western India, and Andhra Pradesh in the south east. The different modes of reception of objects such as Roman coins can aid our understanding of the level and type of preexisting artistic traditions. Overall, the papers in this volume achieve the highest level of scholarly research. However, at times the reader is unclear as to how much of the material is summarized from previous publications and how much is new. In many of the essays, authors state that they wish to revisit the conclusions made by pioneers in the field, such as John Marshall, R. E. M. Wheeler, Giuseppe Tucci, and W. W. Tarn. These early writers are so frequently footnoted, one is left wondering whether their work is being cited because the author disagrees with it, or whether the work is still considered to be accurate. Many of the most difficult problems of Pre-Kus?na art are not addressed at all, so readers should not expect to find answers to long-standing questions, such as the origin of the Buddha image or the priority of anthropomorphic imagery in Mathura versus Gandhara. Jaina and Brahmanical traditions are barely touched upon, and nothing close to a complete picture of the Pre-Kus?na art of northern Indian sites of the Gangetic plain is presented. One collection of essays certainly cannot cover all topics, but the title and introduction could better reflect the contents. In her introduction Doris Srinivasan sums up the "hallmarks characterizing the vitality and creativity of Pre- and early Kus?na art" as being adoption, adaptation, and transformation (p. 25). I would argue that these are characteristics of Indian art as a whole, and the papers in this excellent volume testify to some of ways in which this holds true during the first centuries before and after the common era.
