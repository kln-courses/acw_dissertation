<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART AND CRITICISM On the Problems of Living Art Criticism J. P. Hodin I The questions to be touched on here do not refer to the entire sphere of the critical approach to art, but confine themselves to criticism of modern art- what in France is called la critique de l'art as against l'histoire de l'art. What is implied by the title: On the problems of living art criticism? Firstly, that a theoretical treatment of this subject is only of value when it is able to affect life, an analysis valuable only when it finally leads to a new synthesis; likewise, criticism is only critical when, with other necessary in- gredients, it contains an evaluation of the purely pictorial elements of the work of art. Further, this question has appeared to the author as a living problem, because both art-lovers and artists have a living interest in it, the former to intensify their awareness of art, the latter because they demand correct interpretation of their work. If the artist were to question whether art criticism is justified at all, what interest it serves and what its aims are, this would seem to strike less at the necessity of art criticism itself than at the existence of a gulf between artists and art critics, at a decadence in art criticism, at the protest against the type of critic who is defined as "a gentleman who takes ink and paper and writes what he pleases." It is the very nature of the problem that gives such great significance to the word living, which implies not a limitation but an extension. The productive contact of the critic with the life of art is of such importance because the art life we see before us provides our only means of learning how the process of artistic creativeness actually develops,, how the mind of the artist works, how traditional values are given new, unexpected forms-briefly, because, from life, we glean ex- periences by which we can test the truth of theories and hypotheses. It neces- sarily follows that living art criticism must seek contact not only with the work of art and its influence on present-day people, but also with the artist, the living author of the work. And how else can the breadth of a personality be more truly judged than by direct contact with it? The objection that this might render the critic's judgment less objective does not, in my opinion, out- weigh the advantages accruing from such contact between artist and critic. If the artist's judgment proves more correct, it can hardly harm the critical atti- Dr. Hodin, the first Director of Studies and Librarian of the Institute of Contempo- rary Arts in London, editor of Les Arts Plastiques in Brussels-has published several books and contributed articles and book reviews to CAJ and to IAAC. In January 1955 he received first prize for art criticism in an international competition at the Biennale in Venice. CAJ XV 1 18</page><page sequence="2">tude of the critic. On the other hand, a critic of sound judgment, knowledge and instinct can mean much for the artist. The direct contact between artist and critic also makes possible a critical confrontation of the intentions of the artist with the work in which he has expressed them. Art historians have gone to infinite pains to reconstruct little-known details of the lives of great artists, not only from an interest in their person, but also because they realise how much time and environment affect creativeness. The careers of great artists stimulate succeeding generations of artists and have a moral effect on all those who, in the lives of the artists, would see a high endeavour towards an exalted goal, thus obtaining a close-up of the daily struggle for poetry and beauty and the will to enrich art with new values. There is another, even greater purpose than this biographical and moral one, which I would outline as follows. The art critic has approximately the same relation to the work of art as the naturalist to Nature. If Nature could provide a being who could answer her students' eager questions as freely as the artist willingly communi- cates with the beholder, who will deny that the naturalist could rejoice in results which he might otherwise never reach? We are deeply grateful for the conversations with great artists which have come down to us, and for each line in which they themselves embody their thoughts and their feelings. Scholars of modern art should recognize the great worth of the accounts of the lives of modern artists resulting from living contact with the subjects. The art critic is dependent on the problems which encounter the artist in his work, as is clearly proved by the mass of faulty interpretations, and confusing defini- tions and concepts generated by the modern stylistic trends. Only living con- tact with the artist can establish unequivocally what he had in mind. It would therefore be an inspiring task to write the lives of a living generation of artists, and by discussions, conversations, correspondence and personal ob- servation lay the foundations for an artistic assessment of the present day which would surely be far more stable than any incidental comment, and of infinite importance to the historical perspective. For the art critic, the requirement of living contact with the artist is necessarily linked with a revision of the concept of tradition. The custom in art history is to start at the known beginnings of art and work forward to our own times. The creative artist does not see tradition as something impersonal and linear. He experiences it more concentrically, from the starting-point of his own creative will --the formative will of the present, our own age. The line of vision is thus reversed: from the present to the past. Thus the artist finds anchorage in life itself and can dispense with a fruitless journey in the wake of his predecessors, following the track of art development through one art epoch after another. In the sphere of technique, the idea of development must be fully accepted. There is no mechanical logic in creativeness, however; often the development proceeds by leaps and bounds; it follows its own innate urge divorced from that of chronology and causality. It is difficult to speak of a development to something higher. Our present day has taken im- 19 Hodin: Art and Criticism</page><page sequence="3">pulses from the art of primitive peoples and ages even in the technical sense. And when 20th-century city dwellers find sources of inner life in the art of the primitives, we can hardly speak of development in the ordinary sense. Every critical question can penetrate to the essentials of the problems of art. An art critic whose mind has a unifying tendency, the innermost ramifi- cations of whose ideas form a world view, has a surer and more steady grip on his task than the one who merely allows himself to float on the changing moods of the moment, or whose limited personal register cannot admit any- thing in the living generation which is greater than or different from himself. Sentimental criticism and that prompted by resentment, the criticism of unsuc- cessful artists, and such as is dictated by art-political reasoning-cultivated by cliques, groups, partisanship due to other than purely artistic reasons, such as humanitarian, social, class-conscious, and so on-harm art criticism as such. An obvious question arising in this connection is whether there is such a thing as absolute, objective art criticism. I do not think so. Just as there is no absolute truth accessible to man's mind, so also is there no objective attitude to a work of art. The most paradoxical consequences could be deduced from this statement-and, indeed, these are often verified in practice. The most disturbing consequences can, however, be avoided by not regarding as criti- cism that which does not display certain significant elements. What are these elements, and what must the critic do to make his subjective judgment valid? The first question concerns the substance of the criticism, the second that of the critic. Art criticism has developed with special vigour during the last fifty years. This hangs together with the new renaissance of art, resulting in the triumph of modern art principles, and revolutionising the vision and the artistic feel- ing of the West. As a result, new opinions on art matters have grown up among the general public; the battle of aesthetic prejudices against new prin- ciples has been initated. Emanating from the art center, Paris, in fulfillment of that city's mission, the change spread to other countries. This new renais- sance in art has been accompanied by a renaissance in the attitude of art critics. Concepts and methods of visual approach have been reassessed. In his foreword to La vie litteraire, Anatole France upheld the stand- point of subjective criticism as the only possible one: Objective criticism is no more possible than is objective art, and all those who pride themselves on having put anything other than themselves into their work are victims of the most deceptive philosophy. The truth is that one can never get away from one- self . . . we are shut up in our personality as in a permanent prison. The most we can do, it seems to me, is to accept this bitter state of affairs cheerfully, and admit that we are speaking of ourselves every time we have not the strength to keep silent. The battle between the subjective and the objective approach in art criticism is a manifestation of the battle for liberal principles in art, in the sense that no absolute laws of beauty and taste, having a restrictive influence upon artistic creativeness or approach are recognised. The notion of the exist- CAJ XV 7 20</page><page sequence="4">ence of absolute beauty goes back to Plato's conception of the ideas as the sole and perfect prototypes of the sensible world. While liberal criticism prevents us from judging from one historically fixed and immovable point only, it may drive us into a relativity that does away with all values. This may turn out to be the new, Inferno of our time. If everything I see merely calls up a subjective picture within me, then these subjective pictures must all have an equal justification. Is an evaluation possible at all in that case? Against this apparent fact, life pits a true one in the shape of the personality. It is solely thanks to the personality, to the fluidum it sends out and the convinc- ing strength it imparts, that an evaluation is possible. Great art is the art of great artists. They have with their work created values which in all ages kindle new life in new personalities. The yardstick of the world is man. Was it this that made Buffon write: Le style est l'homme meme? Man is also the yardstick of the art critic. A blurred medium reflects the objects as dim and blurred, while in a clear mirror they stand out pure and clear. And in the same way that a glass cannot catch the whole contents of a living spring but only an infinitesimal part of it, a beholder of limited capacity cannot grasp either the consummateness offered by a really great artist, or understand all that is lacking in a dauber. There is little real weight in Picasso's demand: "Everyone wants to understand art. Why not try to understand the song of a bird? Why does one love the night, the flowers, everything around one, with- out trying to understand them ?" The new, often very personal formal prin- ciples of our day rule out the traditional approach and confront the beholder with something which intrigues but at the same time baffles him. The neces- sity of art interpretation is incontestible. To understand and to pass judgment is a primitive need in the man eager for knowledge; and were there no pro- fessional criticism there would certainly be that of conversational exchange, the oral criticism of which Saint-Beuve says: The real criticism in Paris emerges in conversation, and the critic would achieve his most complete and truest results by listening to all sides and making a discriminating compilation of them. II What is the sign of a true critic? It is the creative power of intuition and judgment, the deeply felt relationship with art achieved by personal endeav- our, it is character and the moral awareness of his task. It is by no means only his method or the lack of it which characterises a critic-it is personality or absence of personality. Otherwise, a layman would only have to acquire the critical vocabulary and jargon to be entitled to criticise. But the true critic, who feels called to be a champion of art, and as such to enjoy and use his independence, regards criticism less as a profession than a vocation. If such critics did not exist, they would have to be invented. The critic must, like the artist, be extremely sensitive, susceptible, receptive. He, too, is creative. He has daily to contrive afresh a living relation with the work of art. It is not 21 Hodin: Art and Criticism</page><page sequence="5">bestowed upon him by any schema, or dogma, or charter; either he acquires it or he does not. The difference between him and the artist lies in the sphere of their experience-on the one hand art, on the other Nature. The artist interprets Nature; the critic the work of art. Read Baudelaire on Delacroix, read Ruskin's demands for a new ideological content in art, read what Stend- hal has written on Italian painting; read Valery's essays on art, follow Jens Thiis in his defence of Edvard Munch and Julius Meier-Graefe or Roger Fry on the recognition of the supremacy of French impressionism; read Herbert Read's and F. X. Salda's efforts to defend the modern trend of art in Eng- land and Bohemia respectively; read the essays August Brunius wrote as interpreter and champion of the ideals of the Fauvist generation of Swedish artists in 1909-and you will see what I mean. The true critic fights for honesty, greatness and purity in art; he pricks the dulled conscience, with the high ideal ever before his eyes that genius is the spiritual goal of man's life and aspiration, forming and directing the longings of the nation. Generations live from one genius. The true critic knows this. He sees the greatness of the masters and their lives, both past and present; for it is they who provide him with a criterion of greatness and virtue. If the age has no great men, he must cry out for them and criticise the ephemeral tin gods of the day, relegating them to their proper place. It is here that criticism actually begins, for the critic is filled with devotion for the supreme. He solves for the layman the difficult question of who shall be honoured and who not. Therefore, true criticism is the due only of him who, born for love and admiration of art, has been mocked and betrayed in these things. Criticism is a form of scepti- cism, bitter because it is always obliged to pass sentence, but yet building up where it demolishes (F. X. Salda). The true critic has a direct function in life in that he influences contemporary judgment and knowledge. In his longing for the inspired artist he helps to form the spiritual make-up of the people. Enough has been said to show that reason alone cannot accomplish a critical work, that no theory can do auty for the living heart and the receptive mind, and that the critic must possess greatness to understand and experience great- ness. Criticism is not a purely rational activity; it is a part of the creative process of art itself, and the artist unable to criticise would be pitiable indeed. If honesty in art is the critic's pursuit, it follows that he must condemn everything that threatens this honesty and adulterates that true enjoyment of art which is one of the most important sources of mankind's rejuvenation and its liberation from the bonds of a world of delusions and violence. Conse- quently, he must above all consider the formative side, the quality of the presentation, the "language" used by the artist to express his world. Every work of art conveys a spiritual experience; but in the means it employs it is a product of craftsmanship which can as such evoke joy and love. It is too often forgotten that the most important argument in judging the worth or worth- lessness of a work of art is found in its quality, the mastery of the constituent elements and the harmony or disharmony between them; and that this argu- CAJ XV 1 22</page><page sequence="6">ment must therefore be given pride of place in the critical assessment. Is it not strange that the name of criticism is given to that which is none, where the formal presentation is given no mention among all the secondary charac- teristics of the work? Let us look at the great works of art throughout the ages in Europe and Asia, whether primitive or highly civilised, romantic or classi- cal-they all bear the hallmarks of quality. This has always been recognised; and countless are the pronouncements such as Van Gogh's: "A painter must work on his technique inasmuch as he wishes to give better, truer, more inward expression to his feelings," or Max Liebermann's "In plastic art, the spiritual perfection is at the same time technical perfection, for here content and form are not only one, but identical." It is the quality of the work of art alone that makes it a work of art. It was with regard to this judging of quality that modern art criticism found itself in a changed situation after the new principles of art had become established. For the generations prior to the impressionists, the greatness of art consisted in its technical accomplishment. Later on the human component was stressed and the expressive quality was given preference. This can be understood from Gauguin's dictum that if his right hand proved to be too skillful, he would draw with his left hand, and if even that seemed to him, too easy, he would not hesitate to use his foot. This new principle has, how- ever, also a purely negative aspect. Previously, the critic has seldom been up against a case of a painter's lacking a certain fundamental standard. The artists were skillful craftsmen who understood their mitier and, as was custom- ary in every other craft, had been apprenticed to one or more masters, and had learnt to control their tools in a school or by intensive self-instruction. The disregard of questions of quality, so important to all true art, was reserved for subsequent generations and their want of patience. The desire for personal expression eclipsed the desire to give this expression a solid artistic form. Such integrity of presentation became increasingly ignored, and works flouting all tradition in this sense were produced on the conscious or unconscious pre- text or expressiveness, disregarding the primary rules of art. Even if there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of an inner experience, it must be remem- bered that the experience does not make the artist. A work's deficiencies can be concealed by endless expedients; the ornamentally-decorative, the topo- graphical, even the religious; furthermore, there is the appeal to the senti- mentality of the beholder, and last but not least the charm of the sketch. Having been struck with the frequent appearance nowadays of unfinished or half-finished works in exhibitions, and understanding that such substitution of uncompleted for completed work is a phenomenon of the times, we must pity the art that is capable only of these "feverish attempts." The attitude of toler- ance to unfinished work has gone so far that at present things are put on show that are only fit to serve as a rough sketch in the artist's studio. Everything that is conceived, created and given form needs time to come to maturity. So much must be discarded on the way-ideas missing the truth by a hair's 23 Hodin: Art and Criticism</page><page sequence="7">breadth, incidentals, mistakes. But nowadays, distinctions are not to the point; and, in the general hustle, the artist seems to have no time to spare for the mature work. This problem, has also another side, however, which cannot be discussed in this context. It is Picasso who once said that an artist has to learn the difficult art of how not to finish a painting. There is a close resemblance between the way a work of art affects us, and the way in which it was brought into being. If the latter process needs time to mature, the former also needs time to show whether the work is genuine, or merely of occasional or superficial character. How, then, can a criticism be reliable when written down after an often merely fleeting inspec- tion, because the newspaper-the personified demon of the times-requires that "guide to the evaluation of art" so necessary to the public, immediately after a private view? The purveyance of news, the contact which the criticism of the day must maintain with a wide public not well versed in artistic ques- tions, starts official art assessment on lines other than those indissolubly linked up with serious appreciation. Journalistic criticism is a spontaneous criticism, often an expression of art-political interests, and its very connection with the daily press gives it a special position. It is for this reason that it often takes its most primitive form here, that of descriptive criticism. Unduly personal perspectives also enter in, and the review frequently exhausts itself either in undefined attacks or glorifi- cation, conveying no positive sense of the viewpoint that prompts them. As a historical example of descriptive criticism, I quote the Greek poet Lucian on a work of the painter Zeuxis: I am not sufficiently initiated to pronounce on the other beauties of this painting, whether the artist has succeeded in combining the different elements that constitute a perfect picture, such as the accuracy of the drawing, the truthfulness of the colours, the effects of depth and shadow, the exactness of the proportions, and the general har- mony; it is for the painter and those who claim to know the rules of art to praise these things. I admire in Zeuxis the ability to display the whole wealth of his genius within a single subject, since he has given the Centaur a fearful and savage aspect. This is quite intelligent writing-which is not always the case with newspaper reviews-yet it gives no evaluation of the work, but merely the impression it makes. It is noteworthy that Lucian calls himself not sufficiently initiated-an admission that would come hard to a modern critic, who is con- vinced that when he describes the tone of a landscape and says that it is coarse or sensitive, he has therewith established the artistic value of the work; whereas in actuality he has merely passed from a description of the subject to a description of the technique. This does not mean there should be no description; description forms part of any art criticism, though less so when there are a fair number of illustrations. Now if, instead of this descrip- tion, we have an emotional outburst from the critic, are we any nearer an evaluation demanding quite different arguments? Delacroix once wrote, of a study by Gautier on the English school: CAJ XV 1 24</page><page sequence="8">He should have had the courage to use comparison with other paintings, in which we in France admire the same excellencies, to bring out the merits of the English painters: I find no trace of this. He takes a painting, describes it in his own way, himself produces a picture which is enchanting-but he makes no real criticism. He is satisfied if he can, with a joy that is often conveyed to us, find beautiful words that sparkle and reflect, if he can but quote Spain and Turkey, the Alhambra and Atmeidan in Con- stantinople. He has attained his goal of being a notable writer, and I fancy he wants nothing further. . . In such criticism we find neither enlightenment nor philosophy. Now it is precisely the newspaper critic who has the important task of giving a wide public the first impulse, the first introduction to a deeper pene- tration into artistic values. Schematic verbalism, a bombastic flow of words, arid enumeration, neglect of artistic evaluation and unreasoning criticism drive the public, the art-dealer and, above all, the young artist along paths that must in time prove harmful. The great artist imparts a true conception of greatness, and thereby neutralises those all-levelling, equalising forces which, nowadays, misunderstanding the democratic tendencies (or perhaps under- standing them too well), are always satisfied "artistically" but never "eco- nomically"; in the same way we require in criticism an authority who, while finding fault, explains why he does so; who educates by passing judgment. But how are we to judge a criticism that is more fully and objectively criticised by the artist than the artist by it? Art criticism should start where the self- criticism of the artist goes astray. Can a non-judging criticism fulfill this demand? Before ever it has pronounced on the work of art, criticism pro- nounces primarily on the critic himself. It has often been said that a man must himself be a painter to assess painting-as if the epithet painter also implied a qualification to criticise. Were this so, there would be no bad painters. Criticism plays an enormous part in practical life. The fate of an artist often depends on the criticism he receives. This provides a professional guar- antee for the art-lover, on whom the art-dealer and, on the whole, the ethics of the pursuit of art depend. The critic must feel a great responsibility when he knows that, having rather heedlessly helped a young artist to an undeserved success, thereby saving him the trouble of holding his own against criticism and public, and so of maturing, he may be closing his way to genuine art while ushering him into that of easy productivity. Particularly grave demands are put on an art critic in an age when the young artists consider knowledge beneath them and, still immature and ignorant, appear in public with their one-man shows, when they are more imbued with the idea of producing things that are easy to sell than by that of improvement-an age marked by a spread- ing interest in art among a wider public, in which galleries spring up like mushrooms, each one eager to discover and exploit a new prodigy. Now, is journalistic criticism up to such a task ? To be sound, criticism necessarily calls for gradations. Besides the spontaneous brand of the daily press, we must have that of the cultural periodicals and art reviews, concentrating on the quality of the judgments, on formulation and artistic ideals. Formulation is impor- 25 Hodin: Art and Criticism</page><page sequence="9">tant because it gives the assessment a more definitive form, and because form- lessness must not be combatted with formlessness. A periodical review that does not answer these requirements is journalistic, for its essence, .even when disguised in book form, remains the same. It is necessary to keep firm hold of this idea of 'quality, technical and ideological, since it is not important that everything occurring in art shall be dealt with in a periodical; the point is, rather, that everything of value shall be brought out and the faults openly and honestly discussed. Criticism defends the human soul against automatism, and its frequent task, as Brunetiere said, is "to teach man to judge, often contrary to his own taste." The critic finds his criterion not in the -ism or the school, but in the distinction between good and bad art. And the qualitative verdict of good or bad implies in itself that it is not the limitation of an artist that evokes a criticism as such. Unquestionably, a painter assumes greater importance if he solves the more important problems of art; and he who paints only landscapes has a narrower range of vision than he who applies himself to both landscapes and figures. A badly painted monumental work has less value than a small still-life displaying pictorial values. But if criticism uses the same words for everything, will they not ultimately lose all meaning ? In a time such as ours, when there is a temporary lull in the emergence of new creative ideas, when the young artist should be thoughtfully looking back to see what enduring elements have been thrown up by modern trends, a time which maybe marks the beginning of a new attitude to art values, the critic, too, must revise his accustomed concepts. Extremes have been aban- doned; nobody believes any longer in some one and only dogma of redemption; people are not so artistically keyed up as before, and they often feel at a loss. It is a period for careful assimilation of what has already been gained, of hesitant embarkation perhaps on other courses leading to new heights. An artist who employs already outworn means of expression cannot possibly produce a stirring artistic experience, since such an experience cannot be imparted with these means. An artist of this kind does not create in the true sense of the word; he only reproduces. Moreover, an artist who does not understand that the sole freedom in art is not to do everything he wants but to find his own personal expression, is no artist. Only that measure of strength put into a work can communicate itself to the beholder; and it is also the strength in the conviction of the critic that gives his criticism its value. Quali- tative criticism has a qualitative artistic production as a result, and rules out demoralisation in the world of art. The judging of art follows universal rules valid throughout the world. The artist who can nowadays make contact with all artistic products to date through travel, visits to museums and the study of exhibitions and publica- tions, must have at hand a criticism of the same universality. How far would we get if a critique drew a geographical boundary round each country? There is no special English, Swiss or American criticism beside that universally valid. CAJ XV 1 26</page><page sequence="10">If an assessment of values disregarded both the great masters of the past and the truly creative artists of the present, the results obtained would inevitably give false perspectives. The national features in art must certainly be observed, but they are on another plane (what is Spanish in Goya and French in Renoir, for example; when we come to El Greco or Chagall, this narrow approach meets with difficulties)-the plane of national tradition, determinative environment, and psychological and geographical idiosyncrasy. They do not touch the question of genius and quality. III I should like to touch on some questions which are closely associated with the revaluation of certain terms and conceptions in the current attitude to art, whose solution might help us to new and better viewpoints. Above all, there is the question of the artistic experiment. It is a sign of the creative will that a work of art is not only labour but also a manifestation of the spirit. The experiment develops, impels the artist to a personal synthesis; it embodies the true valour of the spirit and its challenge to the inclination towards inner ease and outer mass production. In his formulation of the difference between poetry and literature, poetry's eternal value and the temporal one of sheer craftsmanship, Benedetto Croce has made a differentiation which can by analogy also be applied to the plastic arts. If we call the first category artists, what shall we call the second, whose exponents claim that their serial produc- tion shall be esteemed art; while, for example, a piece of pottery of outstand- ing shape and design is to be called handicraft? Art is the conquest of new values of beauty and form, illogical just as life is illogical, but sustained by an inner necessity. Artistic creation is an act of spiritual discipline, and as such it is in contrast to what is merely spon- taneous, expressive, eruptive. It is wrong to think that significant works of art can be produced solely by spontaneity. The constructive, compositive element, the balancing, ordering, critical spirit is as important to a work as the fire of conviction. If it does not find its pictorial expression, which only attains its personal form by means of experiment, the painting can only aim at creating a mood, and cannot escape the slur of being considered inadequate or limited. It is the lack of these consolidating elements that characterises the half-fin- ished, merely rudimentary works I mentioned earlier. The objection may be raised that the artist is forced to this kind of production on material grounds, as otherwise he would not be able to paint at all: and an artist who has to paint a picture for a low fee cannot give it as much time as a thorough piece of work would require. This objection does not hold water, and merely shows an unstable attitude to artistic values. Great artists have been strong enough not to "sell" themselves; they have followed the gleam under the hardest conditions. The early history of modern art is not that of the easy-going, well- to-do artists mechanically turning out pictures; it is one of saints and martyrs (Courbet, Daumier, C6zanne, van Gogh, Gauguin, Munch) ; this incidentally, 27 Hodin: Art and Criticism</page><page sequence="11">throws a strange light on the idea our modern society has of culture. On the other hand, Holland has shown that a group of artists can live in the best circumstances without detriment to the quality of their production. The question of the experiment is most profoundly connected with the problem of artistic truthfulnesS. When Delacroix broke with the tradition of his time, he did so because he considered its colour was muddy, its drawing dead, its ideal rusty. He sought to regenerate painting by the study of Rubens and Tintoretto. When Courbet rose against the literary falsehoods in the art of his time, when the Pleinairists stormed out of the studios and discovered air and light and the lyricism of the atmosphere, when the Neoimpressionists fought the weak formal tendencies of Impressionism, they were prompted by no other than purely artistic considerations, with direct bearing on the method of presentation. The living problem of artistic creativeness, the psychology of the artist, the problems dealing with causes and tensions of the artistic urge, all help us to find a new attitude towards that art which is a destiny, a yearning of the soul, in contrast to the mere reproduction of nature-creativeness as opposed to mere diligence, the inner compulsion as against the mere desire to produce. It was inevitable that depth psychology should come to dominate when the anthropomorphic idea of God began to totter. The eye of the artist changed direction, and began to plumb humanity. Innumerable modern works of art can be traced back to the influence of psychoanalytical research, above all to Freud and Jung. This new psychological approach to artistic creativeness has borne much fruit. By its help Andre Malraux has freed himself from the historico-materialistic view of the world, to follow Flaubert and Nietzsche in a new existentialist formulation of artistic values. Proceeding from psychology, however, it will be necessary to reach a new attitude to the miracles of life, with- out which all art and all artistic experience remain a mere substitute. With every artist, the question of expression is posed anew; applicable to each generation is the maxim: tout reste a faire-tout reste a refaire. And therefore the age is always waiting for the great artist with the inspired, ordering spirit, who finds expression for his time. And the clinching argu- ment for a living art in both painters and critics is that it gives itself passion- ately to its age, that it produces the only true and palpable present, the most real reality. All else is fluid, an illusion, construction, recollection, without living necessity; tradition without living roots. And for this reason the artist's relation to his own time and its reality, to life, is of primary importance. Only after this is established does tradition have validity. While the links of tradition can be compared with a long path (horizontally), it is the warm life of the artist that enables him to strike root direct in existence (vertically). Therefore, art history and art theory must not lose contact with life, either. Is it not precisely because they sprang from the living womb of art that Delacroix's Journal, van Gogh's letters, the aphoristic statements of Cezanne, Gauguin, Braque, Picasso, the programmatic clarity of Matisse etc. mean more for the aware- CAJ XV 1 28</page><page sequence="12">ness of art than so many abstract theses written in libraries ? By the side of the criticism of the professors and the experts, and the spontaneous utterances of amateurs, we have here, as a new factor, the criticism of the great artists. The question of motif is also one calling for particular attention. Much has been said about non-representational art-that the motif does not deter- mine the true content of the work; while the opposite attitude was called "literary," meaning that it lay outside the purely artistic approach. Extremes never hold for long. On the one side, time brought a dissipation of the spiritual content of the work of art, on the other we have-the illustration. Extremes are necessary for a bold thrust forward into hitherto unknown realms of creativeness and inner awareness; the mature art, however, is that of harmony, inner equilibrium, repose, in which the single pictorial elements all work together. The "human idea," then, has been dispersed, and art is the poorer for it. It seems incontestible that the urge driving the modern artist to expression is the same that we find in the works of magic art, of Byzantium, of Giotto, of El Greco, of Rembrandt. Can the artist leave out man's spiritual consciousness when pursuing technical perfection? Edvard Munch was one of the great painters of our time who had a thorough grasp of the importance of this question. He would never have been able to achieve such strong effects without his technical resources; but without his spiritual profundity his art could not move us as it does. The same is true of Picasso and Kokoschka. Though Chardin's still-life with the eggs or Manet's brioches are of sterling quality, the motif in a still-life always expresses another sphere of life than that of humanity. To paraphrase a well-known aperlu of Max Liebermann: Even if a badly-painted madonna has less value as a picture than a well-painted turnip, a well-painted madonna expresses deeper human con- texts than a well-painted turnip. Both fulfil their function in life-one per- haps in a church, the other in a dining room or salon. It is the formal imagi- nation which saves the motif from becoming topography or literature. If we think of mediaeval art and the numerous versions of the Entombment or the Crucifixion of Christ, we see what is meant by the formal imagination of the artist. The motif was there; all depended on the artistry of the presenta- tion and of the spiritual attitude. The generation that ordained motif-less art did not mean it absolutely, for it too had made a choice of motif, and indeed a very precisely defined one. What the Impressionists did-and they stand in the forefront of this development-was to protest against certain historical and literary motifs and conceptions, which in their time had been all-prevail- ing, the purely artistic viewpoints being pushed into the background. The logical consequence followed: non-representational, "scientific" art. The new artistic viewpoint has triumphed, and from its deficiencies a new art may emerge and reconcile the extremes. The one-sided acceptance of intensive colours must also come in for criticism today. Solutions of artistic problems are relative, depending on the exigencies of their time, and they necessarily undergo changes. Colour alone 29 Hodin: Art and Criticism</page><page sequence="13">cannot replace the other pictorial elements. A time in which the enthusiasm for colour has subsided will, according to the natural law of opposites, turn its attention to other values. From an art-historical viewpoint, the intensifica- tion of colour through the Symbolists, van Gogh, Matisse, the Expressionists was balanced later by the structural ideas of Seurat, Picasso (Cubism, and Ab- stract Art). In the realm of expressiveness of colour no further possibility of development is discernible. The periodicity in matters of taste plays a part here. After dark comes light, after colour form; the two united produce mature, classic art. Thus today we are less attracted by that which was revolu- tionary yesterday, and which perhaps, if it bears the stamp of authenticity, will one day rise again from the darkness of the past as a new truth. Much has been said about simplification, though seldom in connection with the idea of intensification. And yet the simplification which merely uses single pictorial elements with the aim of concentrating their effect is unthinkable, illogical and nugatory without such intensification. The consequence of a shallow simplification was that it often resulted in a poster-like banalisation and attenuation. Is the style of our age to be that of universal simplification and popularisation, rendering things easier to grasp, but at the same time spiritually poorer, emptier, more insipid ? The unduly one-sided emphasis on the elements of rhythmical composi- tion, such as contrasting and complementary, or warm and cold colours, the decorative outline and so on, also contains a certain materialism. For though a picture that perhaps satisfies all theoretical demands can be produced without the creative factor in the personality, without soul, without living warmth, it will remain vacuous. The neglect of figure painting is a serious deficiency, which openly came to light when the movement for a new monumental art set in; artists addicted to the constructive, the ornamental, the expressiveness of colour, the com- munication of moods inspired by natural scenery, were confronted with the task of reproducing the human form. And the drawing raised difficulties which were not immediately surmountable, and which should not have existed if the young artists had been better equipped for their profession. Their relationship to the human form revealed itself as too superficial, often schematising, unpsychological, without inner tension, illustrative-this by the way and not to our surprise also in the academic painters who claim the privilege of due instruction in the art of draughtsmanship. One is often astonished to see how the ornamentation on a garment ranks higher than the expression in face and hands or the bodily posture, that flowers are more suc- cessfully rendered than the symbolism in an action, that scenery dominates where human figure should do so. A narrative content is. to gloss over short- comings in presentation. I have often thought of the words of the old master in Lessing's Laokoon to a pupil who has painted a very bedizened Helen: "Since you couldn't make her beautiful, you rendered her rich." Many of the deficiencies in present-day art are due to a general lower- CAJ XV 7 30</page><page sequence="14">ing of the level of erudition as compared with earlier ages. This is partly connected with the contempt for schooling: either the artist has something to give, we hear, or he has not. And if not, no school will help him. There is no doubt, however, that artists of former days often had a far richer, more com- prehensive and profounder attitude towards spiritual life. If a man has something to say, it certainly sounds far better if it is not stuttered out; a musician's feeling is more clearly expressed if his instrument is in tune and he strikes true notes. Has one ever heard of a genius coming into the world equipped with all gifts, and disdainfully passing over every- thing that others have achieved and known before him? Facts show that this cannot be. Intimately linked herewith is the notion that the artist can draw everything out of himself, rather like a spider. He will owe nothing to any master, any school, any influence. But in reality he is intensely dependent on values of tradition and contemporary creativeness-a fact that never escapes a trained critic. (The critic as detective.) Even if hundreds of thousands of pictures were needed to fill the newlywed's apartments with colour sensations, to enliven the unduly economic and geometric modern architecture, even if the mercantilism of art were to go even further, the level of artistic quality in the pictures would not be thereby enhanced unless it finds its earnest champion in the artist, and a supporter in the critic. The one must paint as if van Gogh or Picasso or Cezanne, Braque or Klee stood behind him, the other judge as if these masters were to utter their opinion of his ideas. "Conscious" primitivism (naivism) as we meet it today embodied, at the start, the aspiration towards a more primordially genuine artistic experi- ence. A link in the officially acknowledged tradition was broken by endorse- ment of the primitive and popular, and denial of the Renaissance values, by overestimation of the pristine element in pathological art and in children's drawing. But it was from these very foundations that the resulting primitive mannerism sprang. If the term naive is synonymous with genuine, deep, artistic, then it applies to all artists and not only to the primitivists; and by this same token primitivism revokes itself. The concurrent depreciation of technical skill gave rise to the dilemma which brought certain products of art to the brink of dilettantism. Now the same is true of works of art as of human beings: even with the greatest faults they can be lovable. But this must still not stop the critic from fulfilling his mission. The young artist must find a new synthesis, and the critic must pilot him to a conception of art that gives the qualitative artistic values precedence over the merely subjective ones- this by means of a criticism that is both truly constructive and also didactic. In so doing, he must avail himself of an intensified insight into the history of both art and theory, thereby throwing a living bridge from these sciences to the artist and the public. His judgment must be guided both by his sense of quality and his feeling for and understanding of the style of a work as the expression of its inner tension, of the relation of experience and craft-but above all by his taste. Like the artist, he must possess le g6ut. Rodin, who had 31 Hodin: Art and Criticism</page><page sequence="15">a particular affection for this term, said: "A man who has knowledge of sculpture or painting without having taste will never make a sculptor or a painter." He goes on: "Art is contemplation; it is the pleasure of the thought that penetrates Nature and senses there the spirit with which she herself is animated; it is the joy of the intellect which sees clearly in the universe, and which recreates it through illuminating it by consciousness. Art is man's most sublime mission, since it is the employment of the mind that seeks to under- stand the world and to render it understandable. . ... Art is, furthermore, taste. It is in all the objects an artist fashions, the reflection of his heart. It is the smile of the human soul over the house and all it contains. It is the charm of the mind and the sentiment incorporated in everything that serves man- kind." Taste is the supreme law, the compass of art. What is a critic without taste? In one passage in the diary of the Gon- court brothers, we read the following ironic pronouncement: "The simile is not a lofty one, but allow me, gentlemen, to compare X, to a hunting dog I once had. It foraged, it came to heel, it went through all the business of a hunting dog quite marvellously; the only thing was, it had no nose. I was obliged to sell it." Taste is restricted by the mental limitations of the critic, by his incapacity to adjust his spiritual powers to artistic phenomena, by the degree of his sensi- bility. Where is the intellect to encounter the unexpected, if not in art and science? Where is the chameleon-like character of the human mind and heart more forcibly expressed than in its quest of new cross-sections through the riddle of the sensible world? A critic is not worthy of his calling who believes that the constant use of the loud pedal denotes vigour, who does not realise that the strength of a work consists in the artist's having given only a fraction of what he is capable of giving; who does not see the justification in a weak patch or the beauty in an irregular rhythm. A critic who is duped by the mystic or scientific pose of an artist and forgets to judge the genesis of his ideas together with their form, is not worth much. If he does not see that there is a value in the artist's one-sidedness, and that ugliness exists only in the mind of man and not in Nature, if he does not accept the ineffable that triumphs only in a genuine work, and if he does not set the imagination of the artist above all else, he has no right to criticise. He is no critic who shies away from making a real critical contribution in the rich, now stormy, now gentle stream of living art, who has a good word for everything he sees. Without evaluation there is no criticism. If the work in question strikes no chord in the critic (it is the secret of great works of art that they enthrall us and imprint their individuality upon us), and he tries to read into it something that is not there he is a poor critic. By his laissez-faire, laissez-aller he degrades himself into a mere advertising device for too facile performances. Art, which once found its patrons in a circle of persons who were often well versed in such matters, turns today to the people as a whole. "But the ordinary man," writes F. X. Salda in his righteous indig- CAJ XV 1 32</page><page sequence="16">nation, "does not feel and apprehend the higher values of life; he has only heard their names, he knows of them only by hearsay, indirectly and at twentieth-hand. In this fusty, benighted and base world, there is only one person who enters into and knows reality actively, freshly and constructively, unshakably and positively: the artist." In an earlier period, the critic addressed himself to the connoisseur and the art-lover rather than to the man in the street. Modern times have put a heavy task upon the critic. Today it is the mission of popular education to bring up the people to experience beauty, so that they may share in the creative work of today, prepare the future, abolish prejudice and inhibitions more quickly and easily, be a moral support and defender of idealistic interests, guide and influ- ence taste, divide what is essential from what is merely transient, and fight for the genuine and the eternal in art-in all these ways smoothing the path for coming generations.</page></plain_text>
