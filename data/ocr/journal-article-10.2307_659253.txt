<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERIODICAL LITERATURE CONDUCTED BY DR ALEXANDER F. CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE.-Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthropologist by sending direct to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have noticed in these pages. - EDITOR.] GENERAL Andr6 Lefbvre. (R. de 1' c. d'Anthr. de Paris, I904, xIv, 383-96, portrait.) Memorial addresses by MM. D'Echerac, Thuli6, Deniker, Delbet, Herv6, on the life, character, and works of the dis- tinguished French anthropologist. His chief publications were on Religion and mythologies, Man through the ages, Myths and religions, Races and lan- guages, Slavs and Teutons, Ancient Italy, etc. By his will he left to the tcole d'Anthropologie "my head - face, cra- nium and brain,- and more, if useful." Balfour (H.) The relationship of mu- seums to the study of anthropology. (J. Anth. Inst., Lond., 1904, XXXIV, IO-20.) Argues for individualization, variety, and cooperation. Museums must not be mere scrap-heaps of "curios", a type now fast disappearing. Great Britain needs a National Museum and " Folk-Mu- seum," and special museums to illustrate special subjects (environment, etc. ) Banchi (A.) Intorno ai presunti ritratti di Andrea de Sarto. (A. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 1904, XXXIV, 301-13, pl.). Discusses from an anatomical point of view the six portraits of Andrea del Sarto, alleged to be in existence. From his physiognomic analysis Dr B. con- cludes that the portraits in question rep- resent at least three different individuals ; which is Andrea is still doubtful. Beddoe (J.) The somatology of eight hundred boys in training for the Royal Navy. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1904, XXXIV, 92-99. ) Details of color obser- vations of 8oo boys 16-17 years of age, and head-measurements of 2o0 compared with 86 reformatory school and 122 other boys of like ages. The navy boys have larger heads and are darker-haired than the reformatory and industrial school boys. London-born boys are oftener darker-eyed, darker-haired, and dolichocephalic. Binet (A.) Questions de technique c6ph- alom6trique d'apres M. Bertillon. (An- nee Psychol., Paris, 19o3 [1904], x, 139-40.) From measurement of 104 subjects it was found that in 38 there was no difference in length of head when measured from the glabella and from the root of the nose; in 29 the first diameter was less, in 37 greater. The individual differences are greater with the greater excess of the glabellar measurement. Br6al (M.) Andr6 Lef~vre. (R de l'tc. d' Anthr. de Paris, 1905, xv, 1-2.) Brief appreciation of life and works. Among other literary efforts, Lef6vre, the anthropologist, published two vol- umes of poems pantheistic in sentiment and classic in style and form. He was also the author of a translation of Lu- cretius. Delvaille (J.) La vie sociale. (R. Philos., Paris, 1904, LVIII, 583-601.) The au- thor does not accept the theory that social phenomena are a mere prolongation of biological phenomena. Many compar- isons of this order are superficial and ex- terior. Human changes are due to in- dividual minds, but science alone cannot create civilization. Moral ideas, indi- vidual energies escaping scientific for- mulae are also necessary. Duff (R. A.) Proverbial morality. (Int. J. Ethics, Phila., 1904, XIV, 172-9.) From a consideration of proverbs or maxims concerning human conduct, etc., D. concludes that " if the ideal of con- 328</page><page sequence="2">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 329 duct which most popular maxims present is not of very high type, it is at least a many-sided and self-corrective one." For most of the popular maxims another one of opposite import exists. The an- tagonisms, uncertainties, and contradic- tions of life are well expressed. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) Le ossificazioni di spazi suturali e i parietali divisi. (Mon. Zool. Ital., Firenze, 1904, xv, 172-8, 4 fgs. ) Treats of ossifications of sutural spaces in relation to divided parietals. G. holds that inter-central membranoufs spaces can independently ossify. Divided parietals may be real and pseudo, one part of the so-called "Idivided parietal " being really an inde- pendent ossification in the sutural space. - I1 canale infrasquamoso di Gruber e altre particolaritUt morfologiche nella regione temporale, canale interstiziale e processo ensiforme. (Ibid., 298- 303, I fg.) Describes the occurrence of Gruber's canal in two European (Roman Apulian) male skulls out of 1,3oo examined. It did not occur once in 400 Papuan skulls, and the only other example was in an infantile Peru- vian skull. The occurrence of the ensi- form process is noted in four Peruvian skulls. In the Italian skulls when it oc- curs (ca. I : 350) it is not so typical. Gli pseudo-parietali tripartiti del Frasseto. (Ibid., 1905, xvI, 64-70.) Critique of article by Frassetto in same periodical for Dec., 19O4. G. considers that the cases of Zoja and Fusari, Ranke, and the Egyptian skull of the Paris Mu- seum cited by F., can be interpreted otherwise than as divided parietals, and attributes to him " an extraordinary facil- ity for seeing divided parietals." The theory of the ossification of the periparie- tal sutural spaces is advocated by G. L'indice tibio-femorale e l'indice radio-omerale (A. di Anat. e di Embr., Firenze, 1904, III, 546-65.) The con- clusions of this interesting paper are that, contrary to the opinion of Taruffi, macro- somia (gianthood) does not alter the re- spective proportions of femur and tibia; nor does microsomia (pygmism) alter them according to any fixed law. The radio-humeral index is higher in male, and not in females (as Calori maintained); the greater development of the humerus in giants, relatively to the radius, is not proved. Taruffi's " law ", that low stature is accompanied by an augmentation of radial length, is disproved. The great majority of the lower races have high anti-brachial in- dices, independent of stature. - Un cranio acrocefalico. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 1905, XI, extr., pp. 1-17, 2 fgs.) Describes with measure- ments an acrocephalic skull belonging to an individual ca. 8 years of age, and dis- cusses the general subject (views of Top- inard and Hanotte,- for the latter acro- cephaly and oxycephaly are synony- mous). The precocious closure of a great part of the coronal and of the an- terior part of the sagittal suture is the cause of the excessive reaction causing the peculiar form of the skull, its prog- nathism. etc. The capacity 'is 1,330 ccm., the cephalic index 96.7. The par- ietal bosses are asymmetrical. - Partecipazione della donna al pro- gresso. (Riv. Pop., Napoli, 1904, estr., Io pp.) Discusses r61e of women in human progress in ancient and modern times. In the Homeric age and corre- sponding epochs elsewhere woman repre- sented a progressive element; man was priest and warrior and conservative. Woman's conservatism to-day is retro- gression; she has been mechanized by religion, etc., and civilization has lost infinitely much. Woman must be allowed again to infuse into human cul- ture her grace and gentleness, by acquir- ing a clearer intellect and a deeper sin- cerity. Woman ceases to study before she is twenty; what would man do if he were in like status? Matrimony and child-birth are, after all, episodes, not all of life. de la Grasserie (R.) De l'expression de l'idee de la sexualite dans le langage. (R. Philos., Paris, 1904, LVIII, 225- 46.) Author holds that sexual gender is the slowest and latest of several strata to appear. Gender appeared long before sexuality was recognized in this category ; biotic and logistic preceded sexual gender. Greenwood (M.) A first study of the weight, variability, and correlation of the human viscera, with special reference to the healthy and diseased heart. (Bio- metrika, Cambr., 1904, III, 63-83. ) Gives statistics of weight, variability, correlation, etc., of heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys, based on 1,382 cases from general hospital population and from 358 to 413 cases of healthy hearts. Special</page><page sequence="3">330 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 7, 1905 diseases and general want of health both tend to increase variability and reduce correlation. Heart-kidney correlation is highest. In health heart-weight in- creases with age, but the healthy hear- is much smaller than the heart in diseaset The weight of the average healthy hear. has been underestimated. de Helguero (F.) Determinazione della grandezza e della forma degli organismi in somatometria. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 1905, XI, 17-26.) Emphasizes importance and distinction of size (mass) and form of organisms. Stature seems to be the best index of size, all organ- isms being reduced to a common stature of Iooo units, and the somatic coefficient being determined. The value of the relation between brain-weight and body- weight is somewhat doubtful. In woman the brain-weight is, relative to the body- mass, greater than in man. Indices are not generally independent of the abso- lute masses of organism. Hellmich (H.) Der G6tze'sche B6sch- ungsmesser. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 885-90, 3 fgs.) Gives results of practical experience with the G6tze scarp-measure. See American Anthro- Jologist, 1904, N. s., vI, 554. Herv6 (G.) Le journal de voyage de Relian. (R. d. 1' Ec. d' Anthr. deParis, 1904, xIv, 415-22.) Gives extracts on maritime superstitions (use of powdered shark brain as medicine), the Hottentots ("their language resembles more the cry of a turkey than the voice of man "), manners of the Europeans at Batavia in Java (they keep slave mistresses, selling them when tired), the Chinese in Java (a "Chinese question" existed then as now), poisoning by female slaves abandoned by their European paramours, the Chinese of Canton (industries, reli- gion, medicine, etc.), the orangutang (called "a wild man"), etc. from a Ms. of the I8th century (1754) by a ship's surgeon named Relian, of Geneva. ten Kate (H.) Die blauen Geburtsflecke. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1905, LXXXVII, 53-8.) Discusses the occurrence of " blue birth-marks" (Mongolian spots) in Asia, particularly Japan and China, Indonesia (they are not unknown among the Papuans), America (Mayas, Bra- zilian Indians, etc. ), whites of Europe, etc. Dr ten Kate concludes that the evidence in hand indicates that these "blue spots" are an isomorphism (in the sense of Lehmann-Nitsche), and "occur with different intensity and fre- quency in all human races." Folk-lore in Japan attributes them to coitus during pregnancy; in parts of China to "Ithe slap of a fairy," the mark of the king of the lower world, etc.; in Java to the "lick " of dwarf-like spirits, the lick of a snake, etc. Lamieri (Vittoria) Folk-lore et pedagogia. (R. di Psicol. Appl., Bologna, 1905, 1, 26-31.) Author describes a game of proverbs introduced by her into the school for the feeble-minded at Bologna and the good results therefrom. Lapicque (L.) Sur l'emploi d'une toise horizontale en campagne; experience faite dans le Sud de l'Inde. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, ve S., V, 337- 40o.) Describes a measure for taking the length (height) lying, etc., of human subjects, used by the author in southern India. The principle of the apparatus was suggested by Papillault. L. finds the difference between the height stand- ing and the length lying to be about 2 cm. Lejeune (C.) La communion. (Ibid., 404--II.) Discusses various theories (Leftvre, Reinach, Maury) concerning the origin of communion as practised by the Christian churches, etc. For L. the Catholic ceremony is a survival from the cannibalism of remote ages--anthropo- theophagy. The author looks upon Catholicism as the greatest danger of the future. von Lendenfeld (R.) Bemerkungen iiber die Bedeutung der Riickbildung fiir die Anpassung. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.- Biol., Berlin, 1904, I, 793-7.) Dis- cusses the significance of regression for adaptation. Regression of unused parts is not retrogression but progression, for it increases the regression of the whole organism. To get rid of the superfluous is an advantage, - to accomplish the most, with the least expenditure. Nega- tive variation leads to the regression of what is unused, superfluous, unpro- ductive. MacDougall (R.) The significance of the human hand in the evolution of mind. (Amer. J. Psych., Worcester, 1905, xvI, 232-42.) General discussion. M. holds that there is "an intimate connec- tion between the features of the hand and the soul of man," that its individu-</page><page sequence="4">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 331 ality is "no less characteristic than that of the human face," and that " in its features and capabilities is symbolized all that man has achieved in his long up- ward march from the primeval ooze." Mahoudeau (P. G.) Poudre de crane. (R. de l'Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, xIv, 332.) Note on a recipe of powder made from the skull of one who has died a violent death, given in a botanical and pharmaceutical dictionary published in Paris in 1716. Mann (R.) Facial expression. (Intern. Quart., N. Y., 1905, xI, 148-62.) General discussion. Education and inher- itance constantly increase the differences between adults. The infantile and adult faces among civilized peoples are farther apart than among savages. Aristocratic and socially-selected classes have greater social expressiveness. The contrasts between the faces of men and women are greater among civilized than among sav- age peoples. Manouvrier (L.) L'individualit6 de 1'an- thropologie. (R. de l'c. d' Anthr. de Paris, I904, XIV, 397-410.) Address at St Louis Exposition, September 23, 1904. General discussion of the indi- vidualization of anthropology as a dis- tinct science. Anthropology is con- cerned with anatomical, physiological, psychological, and sociological differ- ences, and the connection of these with one another is not to be forgotten. The practical organization of the science is of great importance. The theoretic recog- nition of its individuality in the minds of all anthropologists dominates all other questions. Mantegazza (P.) Primee linee di psicolo- gia positiva. (A. p. 1' Anthr., Firenze, 1904, xxxIv, 143-82, 193-241.) Sec- tions xxv-xxxu, treating of inferior intelligences, psychic processes in hu- man societies, pathology of thought, higher forms of human endowment, memory, imagination and fancy, speech and gesture in races of man, ethical character of human thought (every thought of weak brains is low), etc. Memory increases with hierarchy of races. In biology and psychology Ioo I oo is of more importance than 2 = 2. Invita Minerva applies to muscular effort. Minakov (P. A.) O posedenii volos. (Russk. Antrop. Zhurn., Moskva, 1903, No. 2, 1-12, 2 pl. ) Treats of the grow- ing gray of the hair. M. opposes Met- chnikov's pigmentophagi theory - the pigmentophagi are really pigmentophors of Riehl, K6lliker, etc. de Mortillet (A.) Les tumulus. (R. de 1' ]c. d' Anthr. de Paris, 1904, xlv, 247-62, 6 fgs.) Treats of names, num- ber (exceeds 3000 in France - infinitely more have been destroyed without re- cord) ; classification (true tumuli or tom- belles; pseudo-tumuli: mnottes, buttes, etc.); buttes due to mineral exploitation ; murgers or more or less modern funeral cairns, also callied pierriers; tombelles or sepulchral tumuli of earth (barrows); neolithic tumuli, etc. De M. holds that, except those buried directly in the ground, all dolmens were covered by tumuli. Mott (L. F.) The Round Table. (Pubs. Mod. Lang. Assoc. Amer., 1905, xx, 231-64.) Treats chiefly of the Arthurian " Round Table " as a courtly festival celebrated on some great feast day. Author seeks to show that "all the known features of Arthur's Round Table are found in primitive agricultural celebrations," the basis being Celtic folk-custom. Nicolle (C.) Reproduction exp6rimentale de la l'pre chez le singe. (C. -R. Acad. d. Sci., Paris, 1905, CXL, 539-42.) Describes the inoculation of a female Macacus sinensis with leprosy from a human being. Other related experi- ments are in progress at the Pasteur Institute. Pearl (R.) A notable advance in the theory of correlation. (Science, N. Y., 1905, N. S., xxI, 32-5.) Calls atten- tion to the importance of Pearson's recent memoir On the theory of contin- gency and its relation to association and normal correlation (London, 1904, pp. 1-35) in widening the range of prob- lems and material which can be effect- ively handled by biometric methods. Pistrement (C. A.) Les races chevalines dans les temps et dans 1' espace. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, ve s, v, 412-36.) Discussion and critique of Zaborowski's recent article Le cheval domestique en Europe et les Protaryens (C.-R. Ass. frang. A. d. Sci., 1903, 845-62.) Z. is in error in applying the term large (grand) to the Asiatic race of Sanson and to the Assyrian</page><page sequence="5">332 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 7, 1905 horses and those of the Parthenon. Nor were the horses bestridden by Cesar's Teutons so small as Z. thinks. There is no evidence that any race of horses has grown larger before the 19th cen- tury (at this epoch, improvements of the soil and climate and domestication with better and more abundant food have combined to improve the breed). P. thinks that the peninsular Arabs of the time of Mahomet already possessed what might be called a breed of horses. Pittaluga (Rosetta) Su un caso di ossa wormiane etmo-lacrimali e del palato duro. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 1905, XI, 52-5, 2 figs.) Treats of two small ethmo-lacrimal wormian bones and two large wormian bones in the hard palate of a female skull (from Siena) belonging to a person not more than 15 years of age. Facial asymmetry and dental anomalies were also present. Rachitic influence is suggested. Preuss (T.) Der Ursprung der Religion und Kunst. I. Der Zauber in K6rper- offnungen. (Globus, Brnschwg, 1904, LXXXVI, 321-7, 355-63, 375-9, 388-92, If figs.) Treats of the "magic" of the bodily openings in connection with the origin of religion and art: Magic song of animals (e. g., grasshopper as bringer of heat,-animals thus become deities), magic of defecation (among Aztecs, etc., excreta and urine in rites and cere- monies), magic of cohabitation (Peru- vian and Mexican ceremonies for the "renewing" of nature, sexual orgies of gods and men), magic of breath (breath- ing into mouth of woman as necessary as as injectio seminis for completion of child), magic of animal dances (men imitate animals and increase power)-- these are matters of magic, not mere representations of scenes and ideas (this occurs after the dances have become secular, or at a higher stage of develop- ment). The conception of a magic power or orenda in the whole of man was preceded by the idea of the "cmagic" of separate portions of the body and of fixed acts. Personal magic began with the belief that out of the openings of the body came magic powers and magic stuff--out of the nose breath ; out of the mouth breath, voice, spittle, and other excreta out of the anus, penis, and genital organs. The magic of man is the origin of religion and of art. R. (J.) Ein Oberkiefer mit iiberzAhligen Zghnen. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1905, xxxv, 57, I fig.) The supernumerary teeth grew after the wisdom teeth in the twentieth year. Rhumbler (L.) Klaatsch's und Schoeten- sacks Theorien iiber Abstammung und Urheimat des Menschengeschlechts. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.- Biol., Berlin, 1904, 798-808.) Critical discussion of Kla- atsch's theory of the separation of the human stock branch and the anthropoid- stock branch at the period of the mam- mal, or the primnatoid, pre-simian ances- try of man, and the argument of Schoeten- sack that Australia was the scene of the origin of mankind,--here the natural environment was especially favorable to the development of such a being. R. considers both hypotheses untenable. The discovery of fossil human remains, etc., in Australia must occur before Schcetensack's theory can have a status. Salmon (P.) Influence du sexe sur le dessin. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, ve s, V, 332-7.) Dr S. holds that drawing is homosexual and of the corresponding sex,--it is easier for a girl to draw a woman, for a boy to draw a man. The personal equation is large even in famous artists. There are "natural drawings" and " influenced drawings." The esthetic sense hardly appears, even with education, before the thirteenth year. There exists in man an innate tendency to draw. Drawing is precocious in the race and in the indi- vidual. Shaler (N. S.) Earth and man: an economic forecast. (Intern. Quart., N. Y., 190o5, x, 227-39.) According to S., " the genus honzo is one of those ex- ceptional groups, of which there are many, which have a peculiar capacity for withstanding those influences which bring about the death of organic groups." Man's intellectual quality exempts him from calamities and accidents of extinc- tion and "he is not to pass from the earth in all foreseeable time, but is to master it and himself for ages of far- reaching endeavor." Slaughter (J. W.) Music and religion: a psychological rivalry. (Intern. J. Ethics, Phila., 1905, xv, 352-61.) According to the author, "music and religion are rivals for the same claims in</page><page sequence="6">CHAMBERLAIN.] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 333 human nature, and so long as music oc- cupies its present place in the general consciousness, we can look for no wide- spread revival in religion." Stoops (J. D. ) Three stages in individual development. (Ibid., 1904, xIv, 81- 9o. ) Author seeks to show that in the individual, and correspondingly also in society, there exist three developmental stages: organization; negative, exclusive self-consciousness; reorganization be- tween growing sense of self and deeper life. Stratz (C. H.) Das Kind als Erzieher. (Vrtljhrs. f. K6rp. Erzhg., Wien, 1905, I, 17-22, I fg.) We should not only educate children but we ought also to let them educate us- especially in the light of mens sana in corpore sano. The child must not be deprived of its natural and healthy instinct for nakedness and its expression. Strauch (Hr.) Ueber eine Methode far- biger Konservierung frischer Leichen- teile fiir die Zwecke der somatischen Anthropologie. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 190o4, xxxvI, 671-5.) Gives author's experience with the Littlejohn wet method of preserving fresh parts of the body, which he highly approves. A woman's head has been preserved by this method since Nov., 1903. The realism of the specimens is remarkable. Stiickelberg (E. A.) Ueber Pergament- bilder. (Schwz. A. f. Volksk., Ziirich, 1905, VIII, I-IS, 4 pl., 5 fg.) Treats of the so-called "parchment pictures," of which the author has seen some 1o,0oo (at the Second International Congress of the History of Religions at Bale), or memorial pictures for pilgrims and devotees, of saints, etc. The pic- tures themselves, their origin, use, etc., are discussed, also the inscriptions on them. Their flourishing period was the time of the barok and rococo style and they were made in monasteries, etc., as e. g., at Einsiedeln. These helgli are still sometimes presented to children or put into coffins, or hung on chamber walls. Symington (J.) John Grattan's crani- ometer and craniometric methods. (J. Anat. and Phys., Lond., 190o4, xxxvIII, 259-74, 2 pl.) Describes, from G.'s article in the Ulster Journal of Arche- ology for 1853, an apparatus for tracing on paper the curves of skulls, the methods used, etc. Tenchini (L.) Di un canale perforante arterioso (infra-parietate) nella volta cranica dell' uomo adulto. (Mon. Zool. Ital., Firenze, 1904, xv, 101-10, I fg.) This phenomenon of arrest occurred three times in 430 skulls of criminals and in 12o normal skulls investigated by the author. Terman (L. M.) A study in precocity and prematuration. (Amer. J. of Psych., Worcester, 1905, xVI, 145-83.) Treats of infancy, education and prematuration, over-pressure, criminal and religious and sexual precocity, precocity and un- balance, nervousness, etc. There are race-precocity, individual precocity, and "prematuration " (the result of outside influences). Tovo (C.) Le forme del cranio nello svi- luppo fetale. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 1905, xI, 27-44.) Gives results of examination by Sergi's method of 86 Piedmontese fetal skulls (second month 3, third 4, fourth 5, fifth II, sixth 9, seventh 7, eighth 5, ninth I I, term 31). Of these skulls 37 were pentagonoid, 22 ellipsoid, 20 ovoid. Before the seventh month 96.9 % are ellipsoid-ovoid, after that period 74-5 % pentagonoid. Normally, therefore, the fetal skull assumes from the seventh month of intra-uterine life a pentagonal form; before this comes a distinct period with an ellipsoid-ovoid form. The pen- tagonal form in adult skull is probably a fetal residuum. Cephalic indices are given. Volkov (Th.) Variations squelettiques du pied chez les primates et dans les races humaines. (Bull. Soc. d' Anthr. de Paris, 1903, ve s., IV, 632-708; 1904, v, 1-50, 201-331, 57 fgs., 172 tables.) Detailed and valuable mono- graph based on the study of some 200oo human subjects (43 Amerinds), 57 an- thropoids, monkeys, etc., and 24 other animals. The European foot is the result of the very slow and gradual transformation of the foot of a climbing ancestor, the transitory forms of which still occur in the flat foot of the fetus and of modern savages. The arch of the foot is the most essential anthropo- logical character, and the index of curve, or relation between the height and the length of the foot, is an important datum. Very important also are the foot of the new-born and the so-called supernumer- ary bones. In the Hylobates and the</page><page sequence="7">334 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 7, I905 gorilla in part occur the beginnings of adaptation to the upright position and bipedal progression. Vram (U. G. ) L'indice alveolare inferiore. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antr., 1905, xI, 49-5'.) Gives the results of measure- ments of the prognathism of the jaw in 34 Bolognese (males 17), 13 Fuegians (males 8), and 6 Milanese skulls, accord- ing to the relation of the intergonial- alveolar line to the intergonial pogonon (Tarak). An index below 103 indicates a prognathic chin, above 103 a prog- nathic alveolus and a retreating chin. Here the relation of two linear measure- ments is substituted for the measuration of an angle. - Un quarto molare in un cranio di un Cercocebus. (Ibid., 47-48, I fg.) Brief description of a fourth molar in the skull of a macaque from Sumatra, -very small, as was the fourth molar in a human skull recorded by V. Waldeyer (H.) Os tibiale externum Pfitzner. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 881-2.) Brief note on four cases of this variation, one on both sides. Whitelaw (C. E.) The origin and de- velopment of the Highland dirk. (Trans. Glasgow Archeol. Soc., 1905, N. s., v, 32-42, 3 pl.). Author distinguishes four types, developed from the form of " the simple dagger knife in use over western Europe from the 14th to the I6th centuries inclusive." As a distinc- tive weapon the Highland dirk does not seem to exist earlier than the I7th cen- tury, although at that time the "univer- sal type " of dagger knife was then in use. W. believes that "the existence of Celtic ornament on weapons of the 17th and I8th centuries was a revival rather than a survival." Wilder (H. 1H.) Duplicate twins and double monsters. (Amer. J. Anat., N. Y., 1904, III, 387-472, II fgs., 2 pl.) Treats of multiple births and their rela- tionship to composite monsters, intra- uterine relationships in twin gestations, triplets and other multiple births, dupli- cates among lower animals, relation of duplicate twins to double monsters, clas- sified list of double monsters (diploplagi, autosite and parasite), origin of compo- site monsters (recent theories, etc.), configuration of the friction-skin (palms and soles) in twins and triplets, physical measurements of duplicate twins (four sets). Good bibliography (pp. 465- 472). Among the conclusions reached in this valuable monograph are these: Twins are either duplicate (invariably of same sex - "the result of the total separation of the first two blastomeres of a single egg) or fraternal (of same or different sex - " resulting from the si- multaneous ripening and consequent fer- tilization of two separate eggs" ). Du- plicate twins usually "resemble each other to the point of confusion" ; fra- ternal twins may or may not resemble each other. Symmetrical double mon- sters (diploplagi) are closely related to duplicate twins; unequal double mon- sters (autosite and parasite) are due to " the secondary fusion of two embryos." Twins show greater differences from each other in the soft than in the skeletal parts. EUROPE Abercrombie (J.) A method of arrang- ing British bronze-age ceramics in chron- ological order. (Trans.

(Globus, Brnschwg., 1905, LXXXVII, 21- 27, 37-44, 15 fgs., plan.) Interesting account of the German colony of Rie- bensdorf in the Government of Voronej (founded in the latter part of the I8th century by immigrants from Sulzfeld, near Heilbronn) and its people. The language is Swabian with a few Little Russian loan-words. The colony orig- inally numbered 209 souls; the popula- tion in 1902 was I, 192, practically sta- tionary since 1881. The people have retained their Protestantism, thrift, and industry. Agriculture and cattle-breed- ing are the bases of material culture. Government interference (law of 187 I) gave the colony a blow from which it never recovered. Ammon (0.) Die Bewohner der Halli- gen. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.-Biol., Ber- lin, 1904, 1, 84-98.)

(Univ. of Toronto Stud., Philol. Ser., 1903, I, 1-45.) Author concludes that "professional singers existed among the Anglo-Saxons as well as among the other Germanic races of the 6th, 7th and 9th centuries." The scop was warrior, poet, sage, teacher, historian. Bardon (L.) et Bouyssonie (J. et A.) Monographie de la grotte de Noailles, Corr~ze. (R. de l'Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, xIv, 283-94, 8 fgs.) De- scribes the "Chez Serre" grotto near Noailles, condition and contents,-arch- eological strata, flints, piercers and bor- ers, nuclei and flakers, etc. The "new type" of borer was common here. The fauna and implements of the cave attach it to the Solutrean-Magdalenian epoch. There are analogies with Brassempouy and Sordes especially. One carving was found. The number of non-retouched flints was great. Bartels (P.) Ueber Schadel der Steinzeit und der friihen Bronzezeit aus der Um- gegend von Wurms a. Rhein. (Z. f.

Report on animal bones from Langbank pile dwelling. (Ibid., 49-51, 2 pl.) Bones of oxen (chiefly), deer, pig, goat, sheep were found. The remains correspond with those found at other Scotch pile dwellings. The ox is the Bos albifrons or Celtic short-horn, the pre-Roman domestic species. One sheep presents characters not found in any existing variety. - On certain points in Scottish ethnol- ogy. (Scott. Hist. Rev., Glasgow, 1905, 11, 275-86 II figs.) Treats of chambered cairns, their contents and human remains. Author holds that when the east of Scotland was occupied by an Eur-Asian (Ripley's "Alpine") people, the west was inhabited by an Iberian tribe whose customs and culture have certain characteristic features. The Eur-Asians brought with them the beaker, - the food vessel was apparently native. There took place "a degenera- tion in situ of the Iberian before the Eur-Asian type of custom and culture."

Describes grotto of Graze in Dordogne discovered in 1904 (the eleventh so far knowr), its contents, engravings, etc. The Graze grotto seems to put an end to questions as to the au- thenticity of these mural pictures, since the sand and clay accumulation had long covered them up and indeed preserved the few now existing --the cave was once full of such mural engravings of bisons, horses, deer, etc. Their rudeness also indicates their antiquity. The bison figure, though profile, has both horns represented. Flints and bones were also found. Capitan (A.), Breuil (l'AbbM), et Peyrony (M.) Une nouvelle grotte a parois gravies, La Calevie, Dordogne. (Ibid., 379-8 , 2 fgs.) Brief account of the grotto with decorated walls at La Cal~vie (the figures are of horses) in the Dor- dogne.

Les Bulgares et les Mac-&amp; doniens. Note compl6mentaire a la communication du Dr Wateff. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, ve s., v, 459-66, map.) Discusses the distribu- tion of the cephalic index in Bulgaria and Macedonia, according to the investi- gations of Wateff, Pittard, etc. In the region north of the Balkans brachy- cephaly predominates, in the south doli- chocephaly. Western Rumelia is espe- cially dolichocephalic. The indices for women follow about the same course as for men. In the discussion M. Atgier attributed the brachycephaly of the north to a Celto-Slav and the dolicho- cephaly of the south to an " Ibero- Pelasgic " element. Finn (Hr.) Ueber neuere Ausgrabungen in Skandinavien. (Z. f.

The average capacity of 14 skulls is 1477.6 ccm., the cephalic form for 13 male skulls is dolicho-mesato ce- phalic. The estimated stature for males is 1,686 mm., for females 1,590. These rather tall eneolithic people may be the ancestors of the tall Sicilian element of to-day, related to the race of Cro-Mag- non, the "Berbers," and the "littoral type" of Deniker, all one and the same thing. Apparently a tall type has ex- isted in Sicily since eneolithic times. Goldstein (F.) Die Malthusische Theorie und die Bev651kerung Deutschlands. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1905, LXXXVII, 46-50.) Author considers "Isocial over- population " the menace, not "Malthu- sian over-population " - the first has been present in Germany for some time and is becoming more and more oppress- ive. Not lack of food but excess of work, overfilling of occupations, is the real trouble. Gorganovic-Kramberger (K.)

(Globus, Brnschwg., 1905, LXXXVII, 34.) Brief r6sum6 of the section in Prof. A. Forel's Le Lman treating of the influence of the Lake of Geneva on the distribution of population. The riparian zone has great attractive power,-the lake is a source of food, and land-attacks are more easily repelled. Other factors, geographic, climatic and meteorologic, have also been at work to favor this zone against country behind it. Handschin (C. H.) Das Sprichwort bei Hans Sachs. I.

Among the marked characteristics of the Alsatians are good-nature, honesty, and industry, but they are lacking in vivacity and initiative, considerably addicted to drunkenness, brave, gay, with a good humor. Their habits and customs are patriarchal, simple, and conservative, with much survival of superstition and popular rites and ideas which have af- fected the Christianity of the country.

Notes the recent (1902-o3) literature on the prehistory, ethnology, ethnog- raphy, folk-lore, etc., of Galicia, Rus- sian Poland, and the Ukraine, contained in the publications of the Cracow Acad- emy of Sciences, the folk-lore journal Lud, issued by the Lemberg society, the Tchevtchensko society of Lemberg, etc., among which are included very important works by Fedorowski on the White Russians; Kolessa on Galician- Ruthenian folk-songs; Gnatiuk on Gali- cian-Ruthenian folk-tales (2 vols. ); Franko on old Russian folk-tales, etc. R6sumbs are also given of recent works by Majewski, Ketrynski, Niederle, Tal- ko-Hryncewicz, etc., on Slavic ethnology, Ciszewski on the ethnology ana history of the heart, Windakiewicz on the ancient Polish folk-drama, etc. Suchie- wicz's work on the Huzuls is also note- worthy. Korolev (S. A.) Astrachanskie Kalmyki. (Russk. Antrop. Zhurn., Moskva, 1903, No. I, 22-47, 4 fgs., 3 diagr. ). Gives results of observation and measurement of 200 Kalmucks of both sexes and various ages. K. compares the Kal- mucks with their Asiatic relatives the Torgots, - the effect of the European environment of ca. 130 years is seen, but the basal race characters remain. Of 93 males between the ages of 21 and 65 years, 56.99 % had a stature between 1576 and 1675 mm. The average ceph, alic index of 96 males of like ages was 81.o8. Larson (L. M.)

This valuable first report of the com- mittee of the German Anthropological Society on prehistoric type-maps presents distribution maps of flat and rimmed bronze axes, oar and disk head needles, and wheel head needles, for the German empire, with indications where speci- mens are now preserved and references to literature. The rimmed bronze axe has the following varieties: Armorican type, North German, South German, Saxon, "nicked," long-stemmed, East Baltic. Transition forms are very num- erous. L. wishes to ban the word Celt and use only Axt (axe). The Armori- can type is the simplest, the East Bal- tic very limited in occurrence. The oar needle has 4, the disk needle 2 types, - there is also an East Baltic type of the disk needle with flat ribbon-spiral head. Of the wheel needle there are 4 types (earless, Upper Rhenish with one eye, Central German with two and four ears, Hanoverian with three ears). L. op- poses the idea that the wheel needles were developed from the disk needles. Long after the bronze age, in the Roman imperial period, the use of wheel needles appears again in Livonia, etc. Mehlis (C.) Die neuen Ausgrabungen im neolithischen Dorfe Wallb,5hl bei Neustadt a d.

Describes the important recent neolithic finds- at Wallbihl in 1904, seeming to indicate the existence of a village (22 huts have been noted), a new fact for Bavaria and the Palatinate. The most interesting objects are ceramic objects, amulets, idols, beads, flints, etc. This find establishes a settled population in this region at ca. 2000 B. c., with trade relations with western Switzerland, northern Italy, the Danube country, and the shores of the AEgean.

The meas- urements for each individual are given in the tables also the same details for 23 best pupils and 23 backward pupils. The more intelligent pupils were found to have a greater development of the head and better of the face. The two classes (more and less intelligent) as determined by the teachers showed chiefly physiolog- ical differences, which tended to vanish (accentuating the cranial differences in favor of the more intelligent) when Dr M. arranged the two series. Better de- velopment of head would seem to pre- vail among the well-to-do and the more intelligent. One problem has to do with the intelligence, another with nu- trition. Nerong (0. C.)

One female skull is treated at length (349-354). The average cephalic index is 74-94; the estimated brain- weight raises the Chamblandes people above those of modern "lower races" and tends to approach that of the Euro- peans of to-day, although they were of small stature. Three chief cranial types (Herve's Baumnes-Chaudes, prob- ably the descendant of the Magdalenian paleolithic race of Laugerie-Chancelade ; the Grimaldi type of Verneau, of negroid nature ; a neolithic dolichocephalic type of northern origin,-two skulls only) are recognized. The other remains (flints, ornaments, axes, etc. ), indicate the first part of the age of polished stone as the peri- od of sepulture, and complicated funeral ceremonies were probably in vogue. S. considers that the remains at Cham- blandes prove that Switzerland was in- habited at the end of the paleolithic and beginning of the neolithic age by the ancient prehistoric races of northern and western Europe. Schmidt (H.) Troja-Mykene-Ungarn. Archlologische Parallelen. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 608-56, 34 figs.) Discusses archeological parallels in the prehistoric culture of Troy, Mycenoe, and Hungary. Bodily ornaments (buckles, spirals, etc.), the culture of the Thraci, the neolithic culture of the Danubian and Balkan countries (Lengyel, Tordos, etc.),-painted ceramics in particular. S. holds that the evidence justifies the belief that certain ceramic and orna- mental forms were carried by migrating tribes from central Europe to the zEgean culture-area, and that Thracian peoples had their share in the development of the narrower Mycenoean culture.</page><page sequence="14">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 341 Schmit (t. ) Investigation d'un puits fun&amp; raire de l'6poque n6olithique (p6riode carnac enne) .

(Globus, Brnschwg., 190o4, LXXXVI, 297- 9. ) Sketches the history of the defores- tation of Istria, from early times to the present. The remains found in the pre- historic "1stations " indicate forests where none are now. Neither the Romans nor the Venetians, but the inhabitants of the peninsula are to be credited with most of the destruction. Schoener (J. G.) Die Kolonization Siid- west-Finnlands durch Schweden. (Mitt. d. k. k. geogr. Ges. in Wien, 19o05, XLVIII, 173-4.) Rysumi s the views as to the Swedish colonization of Finland contained in Wiklund's recent work Niar komnmo Svenskarne till Finland? (Up- sala, i9go). Montelius holds that the Swedes have inhabited Finland for some 4000 years, while the Finns came there only after the beginning of the Christian era. Archeologic and linguistic data alike indicate the presence of the Swedes in Finland ca. 2000 B. C. Stasi (P. E.) e Regialia (E.) Grotta Romanelli (Castro, Terra d' Otranto) stazione con faune interglaciali calde e di steppa. Nota preventiva.

In the early part of this epoch man pos- sessed, besides fire, a lithic industry no longer primitive, later a stage corre- sponding to a part of the Solutrean. During the subsequent glacial period, and since, the cave seems to have been visited by man. v. Stenin (P.) Der Geist der Getreide- darre und sein Namensfest bei den Gross- russen.

General descrip- tion of the physical characteristics of the Astrakan Kalmucks based on the author's observations of 75 individuals. The chief anthropometric data concerning these 75 are compared (p. 12) with those obtained by Metchnikov, Koll- mann, Deniker, Erkert, Ivanovski, etc. Vorobiev's average stature, 1642.2 mm., is higher than that of the others. The limbs of the Kalmucks show the effect of nomadic horse-life. The average cep- halic index is 83.05. The Mongolian characters are especially marked in the young. Waagen (L.) Fahrten und Wanderun- gen der n6rdlichen Adria. (Mitt. d. k.k. geogr. Ges. in Wien, 1905, XLVIII, 3-30.)

R6sum6s the results of an- thropometric observations on 36,493 soldiers (age 19-25), 319,841 school- children (age 6-20), several hundred other Bulgarians of all ages, 500 brains of Bulgarians of all ages, and 1,330 crania, a few of which belong to the I3th century. Height, color of eyes, hair and skin, measurements of head and face, and weight of brain are considered. The Bulgarians are predominantly (50 per cent.) brunet, only 5 per cent. being blonds; have an average stature of 166.5 cm. for men (women 156.7) ; are largely (77 per cent.) mesocephalic; have an average brain-weight of 1388 gr. for men and I260 for women. The heaviest brains come from the Macedon- ians, the lowest average from the southern Bulgarians. The male country people have heavier brains than the urban population. The heaviest male brain (1850 gr.) belonged to a peasant, as did also the heaviest female brain (I1440 gr. ) Wibling (C.) Drottningh6gen i Helsing- borg. (Ymer, Stckhlm., 1904, XXIV, 259-280, 13 fgs.) Describes a prehis- toric tumulus at Helsingborg and con- tents (flint objects, potsherds, pitted and " cup " stones. Wilser (L.) Urgeschichtliche Neger in Europa. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1905, LXXXVII, 45-6.) R6sum6s data as to the existence in Europe in prehistoric times of a negroid race. The earliest evidence was the skull from the Maas Valley described by Spring in 1855. Since then the finds in Monaco (Doule), on Lake Geneva (Schenk), in Armorica (Verneau, Herv6), etc., have strength- ened the case, and now little doubt exists, according to W., of the former presence of negro-like peoples in south- western Europe. Zaborowski (S.) L'autocthonisme des Slaves en Europe. Ses premiers d6fen- seurs. (R. l'tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, xv, 3- 17.) Treats of the various theories as to the European origin of the Slavs, from the ancient Russian Chronic of Nestor down to ethnologists, etc., of the I8th and I9th centuries - Suro, wiecki, Schafarik, Lelewel, Malte-Brun, Wilser, Samokvasov, etc. Z. upholds the European origin, - probably in the Danubian region. Zindel-Kreissig (A.) Die Knabengesell- schaft von Sargans. (Schwz. A. f. Volksk., Zurich, 1905, viII, 52-5.)

The circumcision ceremony among the Naivasha Masai. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1904, 167-9.) Describes briefly the E-unoto feast, the boy's feast, the operation of circumcision after these ; also the circumcision of girls. The E-unoto lasts for 3 months, the other for two days. For girls the operator is a female (usually the mother), for boys a member of the Andoro-tribe, who are cattle-slayers. No uncircumcised youth can have connection with a circumcised woman, but may with an uncircumcized girl. Besuch (Ein) beim Bangalahauptling Katchungo. (Mitt. d. k. k. geogr. Ges. in Wien, 1905, XLVIII, IO3-7.) Reproduces from the Nat. Zeitung a description of the Bangala, a little visited tribe of central Africa, who are said to be still cannibals. The chief and his surroundings are discussed. Blyden (E. W.) The Koran in Africa. (J. Afric. Soc., Lond., 1905, Iv, 157- 71.) Treats of the influence of the Koran, the Arabic language, and the feast of Ramadhan, in negro Africa. The African Muslims object to being called Muhammedans and pay less re- gard to tradition than to the words of the sacred text. Their chief objections to Christianity are : Its desocializing in- fluence (breaking up family ties, disinte- grating communities), its priesthood caste, its countenance of the liquor traffic and liquor drinking. In many respects the Muslim facts are best and acts of Christian missionaries and their country- men, not preachings, are necessary. The Koran (chap. 31 is said to refer to a negro) and the Muslims have no negro- phobia.</page><page sequence="16">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 343 Crawford (D.) African shibboleths. A new check in philology. (Ibid., 232- 7.) Among these are Arab w for v (e. g. Luban), Vemba f (Luban v), Rugaruga g for k, Luapula c for ch, etc. The Arab, "iwilly-nilly, is a disturbing feature both in African lands and African languages." He has "imarked indelibly his Semitic phonology on the musical Bantu tongues." The blend of the east coast is Arab in mouth and African in mind. The Luban makes fun of it in a little song. Cummins (S. L. ) Sub-tribes of the Bahr- el-Ghazal Dinkas. (J. Anthr.

Among the Dinka a ceremony of speech obtains. The Dinkas are bet- ter spearmen and cattle-herds than hun- ters; possession of cattle is the great ambition, and tending them the chief occupation. Force of public opinion regulates conduct. The Dinkas have a good map-making sense. Darker (G. F.) Niger delta natives, with special reference to maintaining and in- creasing the population of southern Nigeria. (J. Afric. Soc., Lond., 1905, IV, 206-26, 2 pl., 3 maps.) After in- troductory remarks on the decrease of primitive peoples, author discusses the population of southern Nigeria as di- vided into three classes, according to hygienic zones: Waterside peoples-- people of the mangrove swamps (the "islands " are ideal places for keeping slaves; each is a little town, with a "chief") ; inland peoples near the coast--people of the bush (producers of oil and nuts) ; inland peoples proper near to Africa civilization; grass and forest men (hardier type, with iron in- dustry and cotton cloth). Diseases are discussed, also native hygiene, with proposals for health improvement. In two appendices (pp. 220-6), "Negroes in the United States " and "tNegroes in the West Indies" are considered. David (J.) Weitere Mitteilungen fiber das Okapi. (Globus, Brnschwg, 1904, LXXXVI, 385-6.)

Of 188 existing in Tunis, the author has visited 138, of which 94 were discovered by him. Variations in form, etc., ornamentation, sculptures, engrav- ings, paintings (ornamental, symbolical, animal) are briefly described. The sculptures recall the South Algerian rock carvings, etc. The haouanet themselves find analogues in Sicily and in the arti- ficial grottoes of Marne. Fairclough (T. L.) Notes on the Basuto, their history, country, etc. (J. Afric. Soc., Lond., 1905, IV, 194-205, 4 pl.)

In the rain-making of I885 more than Io,ooo people took part in the Leribe district alone. Left-handed na- tives are rare. The native population of Basutoland increased from about 218,500 in 1891 to 347,731 in 1904. Fies (K.) Der Hostamm in Deutsch-To- go. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1905, LXXXVI, 13-I7, 2 fgs.)

Brief notes on Arab, Berber, Tua- reg, Mzab, and other women of the Saharian tribes. The absence of the men from the family tent for days leads to a certain freedom on the part of the women, grudgingly given by jealous husbands and often cruelly avenged. Daughters are property and disposed of as such. Virginity is often relative (the Tuaregs practise infibulation). Famous are the Ulad Nafl or Saharian prostitutes, who had their representatives in antiquity. Rutter (F.) Aug.

Egypte (Lyon, 1904) relating to the ancient and modern Egyptians. Chantre concludes that Egypt represents an autochthonous Lib- yan culture, on which foreign inroads have made little or no durable impres- sion.

The author, who was in the Herero country in 1903, attributes the uprising of the natives to the "civilization'" of the pro- tectorate, the increase of the German power, the rinderpest of 1897 and its consequences, the actions of the traders, and the reservation question. T. (H. R.) The opening up of British East Africa. (J. Afric. Soc., Lond., 1904, IV, 44-55.) Treats of chief duties and action of officials. The strength of the district officer " lies in the support of the authority of tribal chiefs and in their realization of the extent of the respon- sibility."

The Akikuyu are hard-working, thrifty and moral, with an assured future; also ex- traordinarily prolific. The Akamba are primarily agriculturists, but not so thorough or neat as the Akikuyn. The languages of both are Bantu. Tepowa (A.) Notes on the (Nembe) Brass language. (J. Afric. Soc., Lond., 1904-5, IV, 117--I33.) Grammatical notes, vocabulary of some 550 words and 30 easy sentences.

Note on the terms used for "right hand" and "left hand" in the Bantu languages. (Ibid., 1904, Iv, I12-Ii6.) Among the results of the author's investigations of 37 languages of the Bantu stock are: In i8 (or pos- sibly 21) the right hand is known as "eating hand"; it is often called "male hand," and, less frequently, "strong, great, or the hand." The left hand is sometimes (but not so often as might be expected) called "the fe- male" ; also " the inferior" ; in many, if not most instances, the word for left hand (in contrast to that for right) "can be traced to no other meaning, and is probably a root denoting "the left hand." - A "hare" story in African folk- lore. (Ibid., I39-4I.) Gives native text and English version of a tale ob- tained in 1894 at Pa Ntumbe in the West Shir6 district from a girl named Mbuya. The hare is the symbol of astuteness and lives by imposing upon the other animals. Hottentot roots in Bantu click-words. (Ibid., 142-3.)

Dis- cusses past experiences and modern ten- dencies. When Judea fell "Judaism abode henceforth in safety in the schools." The Ghetto narrowed the life of the Jewish schools. The home still remains the safeguard of the peo- ple. Birkner (F.) Zur Anthropologie der Mon- golen. (A. f. Rassen u. Ges.-Biol., Ber- lin, 1904, I, 809-21, 6 fgs.) Treats of the physical anthropology (color and " Mongolian spots," skin, hair, stature, bodily proportions, forms, etc., of head, face, nose, " Mongolian fold," physical types) of the Mongolian or "yellow race." B. considers the term "yel- low" justified. As compared with Europeans the Mongolians have a thicker skin and hair, less and later beard and body hair, smaller average stature. The longer trunk and shorter legs, and dif- ferent bodily proportions ascribed to them by various authorities need further measurements for their substantiation. The form of the head (mesocephalic to brachycephalic) has no characteristics that are sui generis. The face profile of the Mongolian depends essentially on the thickness of the soft parts, and the physiognomy is further influenced by the form of the nose and the peculiarity known as the "Mongolian fold." The great extent of the Mongolian habitat has led to the formation of a fine and rude type, recognizable everywhere, the second being Baelz's Malayo-Mongol, the first his Manchu-Korean.

Id6es religieuses des Tchouktchis. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, ve s., v, 341-55, 3 fgs.) Treats of the evolution of primitive religion as exemplified by the ideas of the Chukchi. B. recognizes five stages : I. Indentification of man with nature, subjective and amorphous. 2. Search for outward resemblances (however vague) between material objects and man. 3. Supposition of two forms of objects, one ordinary, the other trans- figured and anthropomorphic. 4. As- sumption of existence of genii living within material objects and capable of leaving them at will; the idea of the human soul as distinct from the body. 5. Idea of spirits, human-like, indepen- dent from objects, invisible and moving freely about the earth; conception of dead as living after the destruction of the body, - beginning of ancestor-worship. The material accumulated by B. will be published by the American Museum of Natural History, New York (see p. 320 of this issue). An English ab- stract (6 pp.) of this paper also appeared in the protocol of the Congr~s Inter- national des Am~ricanistes at Stuttgart in Aug., 1904. Casanowicz (I. M.) The Wat Chang pagoda of Bangkok, Siam. (Smithson. Misc. Coll., Quart., Washington, 1904, II, 273-4, I pl. ) Brief description of the "great monastery" pagoda, of which a wooden model is in the U. S. National Museum. The shape recalls the terraced towers of Babylonia. d'Enjoy (P.) Associations, congr6gations et soci6t6s secretes chinoises. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, ve s., v, 373-86.) According to d'E. the Chinese have a special vocation for social solidar- ity- they are born societative, devoted to combination, impassioned for mutuality. By family, origin, profession, political ideas, religious conceptions, private and public life, the Chinaman is a mutualist, Even in death he fears solitude. Abroad, this character makes societies take root and thrive at once. They are an im- perium in imperio and mingle religion and politics. The Lily society has over 2,000,000 members. The present dy- nasty fears them much. Fischer (A. ) Chinesisch-Japanische Neuerwerbungen. (Z. f. Ethn., Ber- lin, 1904, xxxvI, 698-9.) Notes on new acquisitions in the author's Chinese- Japanese collection at Zehlendorf: A painted carved modem wall-picture (Ming dynasty); "the dragon-bridge," a Japanese wall ornament; a 200-250 year old picture of the interior of a Japanese No-theater; silk and paper Japanese wall pictures; two bronze lion heads (ca. 1200 A. D.); paintings (ca. 150 years old) of the Makemono procession; examples of metal art, etc. Fisher (C. S.) The Mycenoean palace at Nippur. (Amer. J. Arch., Norwood, Mass., 1904, 2d s., vIII, 403-32, 3 pl., 20 fgs.) Describes palace resembling that at Tiryns and characteristic features. Author thinks that this part of the nearer East was the last influenced by Mycen- oean culture: this because of its being "the place to which some Mycenoeans migrated after their expulsion from the mainland of Europe by Dorians." This sudden extension of the Mycenoean area to the center of ancient Babylonia is in- deed remarkable. Holcombe (C.) The moral training of the young in China. (Int. J. Ethics, Phila., 1904, xIv, 445-468.) Treats of boys and young men exclusively. Training is now as it was ages ago. The Chinese "are peculiarly given to acts of indirection." Text-books and examina- tions are discussed briefly. Confucius is still the great power for social and political virtue in China. The Chinese are still the most peace-loving race, in- dividually or en masse, in the world. Ivanovski (A. A.) Kirgizi srednei ordi. (Russk. Antrop. Zhurn., Moskva, 1903, No. 2, 54-77, 4 fgs.) Gives details of measurements of 156 Kirghiz of the middle horde made at Semipalatinsk in southwestern Siberia in 1888-89. Color of hair and eyes (no blonds; only 5 % mixed), cephalic index (av. of 99 subjects 89-39, - no dolichocephals) and other head, face and nose measure- ments, stature (av. of 99 subjects 1651 mm. ), chest-circumference, size of hands and feet, etc., are considered. The Kirghiz are a mixed race, and the vari- ous hordes differ not a little from one another. Laufer (B.) Ein buddhistisches Pilger- bild. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXVI, 386-8, I fg.)

The moral educa- tionofthe young among Muslims. (Int. J. Ethics, Phila., I905, XV, 286-304.) Gives Moslem view from the Koran and the Iya of al-Ghazzall (d. A. D. IIII), " a man of the intellectual rank of Au- gustine." The order of education is : Mechanical imitation and practice; habit, intellectual acceptance and devotion. The Arabian Nzights is also referred to as valuable. Niehus (H.) Das Ramfestspiel Nordin- diens. (Globus, Brnschwg., I9O5, LXXXVII, 58-6I, 7 fgs.) Describes the yearly Io-day festival of Ram (hero of the Kamayana) as celebrated at Ghazi- pur on the Ganges, at an expense of 2,ooo rupees. The representation con- sists entirely of pantomimes with the reading of the texts of the Ramayana. No stage is used and the scene is changed almost daily. The action follows the Ramayana. Sakhokia (Th.) Presentation d'objects ethnographiques de la-G orgie. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, ye s, v., 370-3, 3 fgs.) Notes on a calabash vase, an implement for softening skin- thongs, a distaff and bobbin-ring, a bean- crusher, wooden vases and other dishes, sort of snow-shoe, a bee-smoker, a New Year's offering or tchitchilaqui, two stone amulets, one suspended over a door to protect against the evil eye, the other worn by a wife to cure her hus- band's sickness. Seklemian (A. G.) The Armenian alpha- bet. (Armenia, Boston, 1904-5, I, No. 6, 39-45.) Historical account of the ",invention " by Mesrob (b. 361 A. D. ) of this alphabet. Before this the Arme- nian had used the Phenician alphabet, and, much earlier, cuneiform writing. Mesrob, who was assisted by the cali- grapher Rophanus, made his alphabet read from left to right. INDONESIA, AUSTRALASIA, POLYNESIA Bouchal (L.) A. Henry Savage Landor's Reisen auf den Philippinen. (Mitt. d. k.k. geogr. Ges. in Wien, 1905, XLVIII, 31-51.) Critical r6sum6 of Landor's The Gems of the East (2 vols., Lond., 1904), with references to the chief litera- ture of the subject. The brevity of Landor's journey causes one to ask whether he himself could have made some of the detailed observations re- corded. Only the averages of the an- thropological measurements are given by L. Chinesen (Die) auf Java. (Ibid., 93-4.) The Chinese in Java number 265,000 with strong yearly increase ; are no mere servants, but capitalists, promoters, business men, traders, land-exploiters, speculators. The Japanese term the Chinese "swine," but the latter rise in spite of all opposition and are now in- dispensable. They learn in a few weeks what does not come to a Malay in his whole life-time. They can be relied on, too. Giglioli (E. H.) Lo scudo pubico e l'as- tuccio penico degli indigeni del sud e sud-ovest della Nuova Guinea. (A. per l'Antrop., Firenze, 1904, xxxIv, 317- I8.) Describes briefly the "pubic shield," made of the Cymbrium melo and known as lorda or vedere ere, in use in parts of southern and southwestern Guinea. The lorda is often ornamental. Besides the "pubic shield," a penis cover is also sometimes used. - Di alcuni strigili litici e specialment di uno bellissimo dei Landak di Borneo. (Ibid., 319-20.) Brief account of "skin-scrapers" (used after a bath) from Hawaii, - called there pohaku kuai-kua, - and from the Landak, a tribe of land-dyaks in Borneo. The latter is an elegant and artistic instru- ment, putting to shame a modern Eng- lish scraper of pumice. Howitt (A. W.) and Siebert (0.)

R.) Notes sur les Nouvelles- H6brides. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, Ve s., v, 356-69, 3 fgs.) Brief notes on the natives of Erromango, Anatom, Tanna, Vat6, Api, Mallicollo (especially, pp. 357-65), Ambrym, Pentecost, Aurora, Aoba, Espiritu- Santo. The New Hebridians are Mel- anesian (Papuan and Melanesian people) with a Polynesian element, in some regions recent and still clearly notice- able, and, perhaps, Negrito traces. The natives of Api are famed for their skill in vegetable poisons. Those of Mallicollo live in "a mixture of fero- cious savagery and joyous childishness." They fear not only the dead but also the living, shamans. Impotent old men and the helplessly sick are put to death. Caste-systems exist for both men and women. The fragments of old pottery at Olal on the coast of Ambryn are prob- ably exotic, since except in northern Espiritu-Santo no pottery is now made in the New Hebrides. Dances are common, lasting often for hours. Three races are discernible in Espiritu Santo. Mathews (R. H.) Language of the Wuddyawarru tribe, Victoria. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, XxxxI, 729-34.) Brief sketch of grammar, with vocabulary of I50 words. This language has a trial number. M. says that the native texts given by R. B. Smith in his Aborigines of Victoria, II, 48-40, are "mere ungrammatical jargon." AMERICA Azara (F. de) Geografla fisica y esf6rica de las Provincias del Paraguay, y mis- iones Guaranies. (An. d. Mus.

Azara's description of Paraguay from MS. of 1790 in the National Li- brary, with bibliography (pages liii-lx) introduction (lxiii-cxxxii), containing valuable ethnographic and linguistic matter, and notes by R. R. Schuller. The "Idescripcion general" includes (353-427) notes on the Payaguis, Mbayas, Guands, Lenguas, Tupis, Guay- anas, Cainguis, Guaranis, and other In- dian tribes. Also items concerning ne- groes, mulattos, etc. The linguistic matter by Schuller includes a compara- tive vocabulary of the Guaycuri' family, also one of the "Nu-Aruak." The tribal names are discussed in detail by S. Bleyer (Dr) Ueber die wilden Wald- indianer Santa Catharinas : die "Schok- leng." (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 830-44, 5 fgs.) Treats briefly ofphysical appearance, dwellings, dances, food (preponderatingly animal; fond of honey), basketry, ornament, weaving, wood-carving, flute, weapons, hunting and capture of animals, bow and arrow, relations with whites, Shokl6ng skull, kidnapping, diseases (syphilis and lep- rosy unknown), death and burial. They live in small hordes, have ho hammocks, do not smoke, have no plantations. Burnham (J. H.) The coming of the Mississagas. (Ont. Hist. Soc., .Pap &amp; Rec., Toronto, 1905, VI, 7-II.) Re- cords on the authority of Chief Paudash, grandson of Cheneebeesh (d. I869, age 104), "the solemn tradition of the Mississagas respecting their present place of settlement in Ontario and the migra- tion which led them thither." The Mississagas are incorrectly said to be " Shawnees," and to them is attributed the Otonabee serpent mound -a struc- ture said by Boyle to be "Imost undoubt- edly the work of a people who occupied the soil long before the coming of the Mississagas."

Porto Rican stone col- lars and tripointed idols. (Smithson. Misc. Coll., Quart., Washington, 1904, II, 163-86, 8 pl., I fg. ) Discusses the forms and types of these relics, the the- ories as to their origin, use, etc. ; based on the author's investigations in Porto Rico, 1902-03, and comparisons with other material. These stone "collars" are practically confined to Porto Rico, and they do not occur in the shell heaps. The "tripointed idol " is equally Porto Rican. Dr F. considers most suggest- ive the theory of J. J. Acosta that "these stone collars were united with the tripointed stones to form a serpent idol." Flom (G. T.) The Scandinavian factor in the American population. (Iowa J. Hist. and Pol., Iowa City, 1905, III, 57-91, map.) Based on census statis- tics of 19oo. Treats of causes of emi- gration from Scandinavia, growth and distribution of Scandinavian population in the U.

(F. uses as material 188 tonala- matl in the Codex Madridensis and 6o in the first part of the Codex Dresdensis). Of the I888 in the Madrid Codex 44 fall on the day ahau ( 17), of those in Dres- den Codex 13 on the same day. The settlement of the fixation of the tonala- matl and the order of succession would be a real progress in Mayan epigraphy. - Vergleichung der Dresdener Maya- handschrift mit der Madrider.

Archeol., Madison, 1904, IV, I-19, 6 pl.) Treats briefly of 57 pottery frag- ments from Sand Ridge, Ozaukee, New Amsterdam, Sheboygan, Two Rivers, Brown co. The pottery is usually fab- ric-marked. From some sites were ob- tained "a small number of miniature rounded vessels, evidently moulded on the thumb," and probably toys. The Sheboygan pottery varies distinctly in character and ornamentation from that of the other sites. - and Brown (C. E.) Additions to the list of Wisconsin aboriginal pottery. (Ibid., 19-21.)

Life and culture of the Hupa. (Univ. of Calif. Publ., Amer. Arch. &amp; Ethn., Berkeley, 1904, I, 1-88, 30 pl., map.) This valuable monograph adds abundantly to and corrects the data in Powers and Ray-Mason. The topics treated are: Environment, history, vil- lages, houses, dress, food, occupations of men, occupations of women, measures, social customs, social organization, amusements, war, diseases and their cures, burial customs, religion. The Hupa have no migration myth and believe their ancestors originated in loco. They have "an undercurrent of deep religious feeling." - Hupa texts. (Ibid., 89-368.)

Author argues that the town-name Napanee is derived not from the Mississaga word for "flour" (naw-pdw-nay, as often written) but from the earlier river-name Apanee after- ward applied to the settlement. The difference in accent does not exist, how- ever, as N14anee really represents French l farine. Kilroy (Margaret C.) Local historical places in Essex county.

Brief ac- count, reproduced from the Hamburger Nachrichten, of the flourishing German colony of S. Bernardino, founded 20 years ago on Lake Ipacarai in Paraguay. The town council has representatives of several races. The Germans are in the majority, but the jefe politico is a Para- guayan. Kroeber (A. L.) Basketry designs of the Indians of northwestern California. (Univ. of Calif. Publ., Amer. Arch. and Ethn., Berkeley, 1905, II, 105-64, 7 pl., 225 fgs.) Treats of the specially de- veloped canistral art of the linguistically distinct but culturally related Yurok, Karok, and Hupa, giving the results of the author's extensive investigations in 1900-02. The native names of the designs are recorded,- and "many of the words are not names of animals or objects, but geometrical or descriptive terms not translatable by the Indians." Only slight tribal differences are noted,- the Karok, e. g., favor more red, vertical outlines, etc. The Yurok work is per- haps finest. The so-called "artistic poverty " of the Pomo can apply only to design names. Dr K. finds that there " is no deep or inherent relationship be- tween the designs of California basketry and their names "; and symbolism is non- existent. The design names are "free from attempts at picture writing or the expression of religious ideas." The designs are primarily decorative. Latcham (R. E.) Notes on the physical characters of the Araucanos. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1904, XXXIV, 17o-80, I pl., 2 fgs.)

I - the race being sub-brachy- cephalic (range 70-88). Artificial de- formation seems unknown. During ex- ertion these Indians have a marked, disagreeable skin-odor. Physically they are inferior to Europeans and half-breeds. Stature (200 individuals) averages for males 1630-1635, and for females 1420- 1440 mm. (great difference due to early marriage and hard work). Large fami- lies are rare. Lehmann-Nitsche (R. ) Altpatagon- ische, angeblich syphilitische Knochen aus dem Museum zu La Plata. (Z. f.

Describes journey made in 1899, with notes on the Turyuara Indians, their boats, huts, etc. The Turuyu.ra are nominally Catholic and monogamous. They cultivate manioc, cotton, and a few fruits. The women make fine hammocks. Many of the names of animals are onomatopoeic. At pages 294-5 is given a brief list of personal names of men and women.

Describes the offering of gifts to the dead by the Ay- mara and Quichua (who are much more conservative than the Tacana tribes) of the Bolivian-Peruvian border, and re- tain, even under Christian influence, many old customs in relation to burial, etc. Precolumbian graves are opened and European articles put in sometimes. One way of presenting things to the dead is to gather together the articles used by him and burn them on a nearby spot. The Indians excavate chulpas to get the skulls to "Imake weather" with.

The negro "is now indis- putably the equal of the white in cate- gories in which ioo years ago he would have appeared naturally his inferior." Negrophobia (instinctive race prejudice) is a source of danger. In the British West Indies " assaults by black or col- ored men on white women or children are practically unknown."

(Ibid., 225-231.) Treats of Nihancan (creator, death-giver, deceiver, sensual being, fool, ingrate, etc.), a chief figure in the Arapaho traditions as recorded by Dr Kroeber. The term white man (Nihan- can has now this meaning) may have reference to the complexion of the new- comers. In certain elements of Arapaho mythology Mr W. sees evidence of "a culture area which included the greater part of Asia as well as North America." Ward (D. J. H.) The problem of the mounds. (Iowa J. Hist. and Pol., Iowa City, 1905, III, 20-40.) Discusses his- tory of problem and investigation, kinds of prehistoric works (earthworks, refuse heaps, house sites, hut rings, stone works - cairns, enclosures, box-shaped graves, cliff houses - excavations, canals and ditches, pits, garden beds, fire-hearths, trails, mines), material of the mounds, current investigations elsewhere, num- ber, size and contents of mounds (Illi- nois has 5,000 within a radius of 50 miles of the mouth of the Illinois river) ; When did the mound-builders live? what the mounds intimate, need of legis- lative action, methods of investigation. Dr W. argues that "if the mounds were built by Indians, that is, by the ancestors of the present existing tribes, they must have degenerated before the Europeans arrived." And he wonders " if the cave men are young as com- pared with the mound builder in America."</page></plain_text>
