Paris (Paul Hartmann, distributed by F. de Nobele), ?6. This important picture-book - for it is primarily a picture-book - is a companion to M. Devinoy's Le Siege en France, reviewed in these columns two years ago.' As in its predecessor, the photographs are of high quality, large-scale details of many con- structional features are shown, and the illustrations are mostly of unfamiliar pieces from French private collections or the Musle des Arts Decoratifs. They range from the medieval Pupitre de Sainte Radegonde from Poitiers down to examples of art nouveau, but, as might be expected, two- -thirds of the illustrations are of eighteenth- century pieces, for that period witnessed the apotheosis of the meuble leger. The larger sorts of furniture, the buffet, the cupboard, or the chest, meet perman- ent needs of civilized mankind and change their forms slowly, but the small piece is the true mirror of the manners of its period, for it is generally developed to satisfy the requirements of a passing fashion. Early in Louis XV's reign smaller rooms came into vogue. By mid-century Cochin had formu- lated the ironical rule, 'plus la personne sera elevee en dignite, plus son appartement sera petit'. This, and the rapidly-changing occupations of the fashionable society of eighteenth- century Paris, gave rise to numerous types of compact multifunctional furniture, bureaux-toilette, bonheurs-du-jour, ath6niennes (which could be used as a plant pot, a wash-hand-basin, a candelabrum, an in- cense burner, or merely as a piece of modish neo-grecque decoration), whose names are so baffling in contemporary inventories. 'Je crois que l'inventaire de notre mobilier Itonnerait un ancien s'il revenait au monde. La langue des huissiers-priseurs qui savent les noms de cette foule immense de superfluitis est une langue trWs ditaillie, tres riche, et trWs inconnue aux pauvres', exclaimed Mercier. Even Ruobo, the most articulate of eighteenth- century cabinet-makers, admits himself un- able to explain certain fashionable names like 'chaise en cabriolet'. To the interpreta- tion to this bewildering vocabulary, M. Guillaume Janneau brings the experience of a life spent in the Mobilier National. His fifty-page introduction is packed with learning drawn from early inventories, sale catalogues, and a wide acquaintance with literary sources. Thus he is able for the first time to define exactly the charac- ter of the vuide-poche (which performed more functions than its name implies), the ecran a la Montagnard, the table d l'anglaise, and the multifarious varieties of toilettes which played so important a part in the public, as well as private, life of an eighteenth-century society lady. But even he confesses to having been defeated by the designations 'table en mouchoir' and 'table en la Mahon'. M. Janneau is especially 1 Vol.xcII, [i95I], p.Io8. THE LITERATURE OF ART illuminating on the dating of certain fashions such as the constantly varying types of gaming table or the protean changes of the commode, though he has been misled into ante-dating to 1756 the first use of Sevres porcelain plaques for the decoration of furniture. He bases his thesis on a table in the Wallace Collection (xix.I2); unfortunately its porcelain top not only bears a false date-letter but is, in fact, merely a soup-plate adapted to its purpose rather than made specifically for furniture decoration. Three other tables in the same collection bear porcelain plaques dated 1759, I759, and 1760 res- pectively and seem to be the earliest known examples of this highly anti-functional type of furniture decoration, though an examination of the archives of the Sevres Manufactory might prove illuminating on this point. The author brings to light some little- known facts on the relationship between furniture styles in France and England. All through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries these were closer than is generally supposed, and from quite early in the eighteenth century complaints against the large-scale importation of French furniture were voiced in the English Press. But the traffic was not all in one direction. It is, for example, interesting to learn that tables with flaps and gate-legs on the English model were introduced into France during Louis XIV's wars, when commercial rela- tions with this country were officially inter- rupted, and the extendible dining-table (as well as other English appurtenances of the dining-room) became fashionable in Paris under the designation table d I'anglaise during the American War of Indepen- dence, just when the English were particu- larly unpopular. One of M. Devinoy's plates shows a Louis XVI table-secritaire entirely veneered with straw-work marquetry. The French are known to have brought this technique to a very high pitch of excellence. Ex- amples of this fragile work are rare and little is known of the craftsmen working in the medium, though a retired huntsman, Delasson, earned a reputation for thi fine furniture he decorated in this manner be- tween 1768 and 1790. One or more prac- titioners of this technique must have been amongst the French prisoners-of-war con- fined in the Norman Cross camp from 1797 to 1816. It was doubtless they who produced the straw boxes, etc., which are still occasionally to be found and which are popularly (and erroneously) supposed to have been the mere idle pastime of any prisoner of the Napoleonic wars willing to sacrifice his straw palliasse to their produc- tion. The finest collection of these things is now in the nearby Peterborough Museum; they are to be distinguished from their English equivalent by their superiority of craftsmanship and the way their decora- tion almost always follows Louis XVI models very closely. The only serious criticism to be made of this fascinating book is that M. Janneau's introduction hardly ever refers to furniture shown in M. Devinoy's plates. To make full use of his learned text it must be read in a reference library exceptionally well- furnished with illustrated sale and museum catalogues. F. J. B. WATSON The Meaning of China's Most Ancient Art. By A. Bulling. 150 pp. (79 figs.)+ viii pl. Leiden (E. J. Brill), 34 guilders. This intriguing book sets out to discover the meaning of a selected group of motifs on the Kansu painted vases - namely circles and spirals, triangles, lozenge pat- terns, and tree and anthropomorphic patterns. Dr Bulling's method consists in working from the known to the unknown - that is, using classical and mythological texts to interpret the designs on the bronzes and reliefs of the historical periods of Shang, Chou, and Han, then finding paral- lels to these motifs on the Kansu vases and transferring the meanings arrived at to the interpretation of these earlier designs. The first condition for the success of this method is, of course, that the historical and cul- tural link between Neolithic Kansu and these later periods be firmly established. The writer apparently considers it un- necessary to demonstrate this connexion, for the question is nowhere raised. That the patterns on the vases had definite meanings seems certain, and on this point Dr Bulling is convincing. But that they meant the same things to the Stone Age people of Pan-shan as they did to the rela- tively sophisticated population of Anyang and Loyang is highly debatable, and can- not simply be assumed. And what did they mean? Here' the author confidently states, 'if the ancient patterns of pottery had any meaning at all, it was most likely connec- ted with cosmography, the orbit of hea- venly bodies and with the calendar. This is supported, to a certain extent, by pas- sages in ancient Chinese literature. The earliest symbols referred to in texts are all more or less connected with the calendar, stars and planets'. The main body of the book is devoted to a discussion of the motifs in the light of this interpretation, for which there is certainly some support. But although Neolithic man in North China was presumably groping towards an awareness ofthe movements of the heavenly bodies, we cannot assume that this was his main preoccupation. Fertility cults and hunting magic, neither of which are con- sidered as possible clues, must have been at least as important. It is possible that this dangerous method of research might have succeeded if it were based on a very cau- tious use of what little evidence can be substantiated; but unfortunately the argu- ment is too often built up on a framework of rickety logic, of which one example must suffice. On p.78 ff. lozenge patterns are discussed, and the following gives the gist of the argument: the lozenge is filled with concentric lines (i.e. smaller lozenges), 'this 342</page><page sequence="2">is the conventional method used for indi- cating height ... they are designed accord- ing to a strictly conventionalised system, which was already firmly established when these patterns were used and could be easily understood by the people. The paral- lel lines ... indicate height and this makes it very likely, that mountains rising in steps and with a platform at the top are repre- sented. The patterns would then represent two ranges of smaller mountains with a larger mountain shaped like a table moun- tain in between them ... Although both lozenges and triangles represent cosmic mountains, the fact that different patterns were chosen as media of representation makes it very likely that each stood for a particular type of cosmic mountain ... where can these cosmic mountains stand?' None of these statements are supported by evidence, and what is put forward as a tentative hypothesis in one sentence is accepted as fact in the next. By such means the reader is led into a discussion of cosmic mountains as they are described in the literature of the fourth century B.C. and in such later and even more fanciful sources as Huai-nan-tzu. The material is culled from a wide variety of sources and makes fascinating reading in itself; it just seems to have no demonstrable connexion with the Neolithic culture of Kansu. The author has collected considerable material to- wards a study of the motifs in Chou and Han art - the section on the cosmic tree and tree myths in general, for instance, has important bearing on the beginnings of landscape representation - so perhaps we can look forward to a further study of that difficult period, which, compared with the Neolithic Age, provides the student with relatively more iconographic problems, and fewer historical and methodological pitfalls. For the next edition of this present book one might suggest some editorial tidying up, particularly the footnotes, and the re-drawing of the illustrations by a competent artist. It is a pity that the material is not better presented, for Dr Bulling has some challenging ideas and theories that should certainly be taken into account in any research into the still elu- sive meanings in the art of the Shang, Chou, and Han periods. MICHAEL SULLIVAN Viennese Porcelain of the Du Paquier Period. ByJ. F. Hayward. xiii+218 pp. +76 pl. (4 in colour). (Rockliff), ?7 7s. Wiener Porzellan aus der Manufaktur Du Paquiers (1718-1744). i9 pp.+56 pl. Venezianer Glaser. 12 pp.+48 pl. Altorientalische Teppiche. 16 pp.+46 pi. All Vienna (Verlag des Oesterreichischen Museums fur Angewandte Kunst). Vienna porcelain has in the past won far less favour with British collectors than that THE LITERATURE OF ART of most other German factories. This neg- lect arises partly from the fact that the only productions of the factory to reach this country in any quantity are the highly- decorated wares made about the time of the Holy Alliance; another factor has been the discredit resulting from the forgeries of these, in every degree of deceptiveness, which have for long been current among the less reputable antique dealers. It is indeed the case that, whilst Dresden china was imported almost from the beginning to meet the eager demands of fashion, specimens of the earliest Vienna porcelain were of the rarest occurrence in England until they became available by the break- up, in recent troubled times, of Austrian collections. It is well that amends have now been made for this lack of interest by the publication of a handsome volume, the first book written in English to be devoted solely to Vienna china. Its scope is limited to the earliest wares, made before the factory, founded in 1718 as a private concern by Claude Innocent du Paquier with a patent from the Emperor, was taken over, in I744, by the State. Mr Hayward gives in his introductory chapters all that is known of the history, with a praiseworthy wealth of documen- tation: not only the patent of foundation but also other official reports and letters from which he derives his facts are quoted in extenso in the original German, a great convenience to students, who are unlikely to have the exceptional opportunities en- joyed by him of access to these sources. There follows a detailed analysis of the wares, their styles of decoration, plastic or painted, and the distinctive mannerisms of various artists so far as these can be recog- nized; the part played by Hausmaler is carefully considered. A very interesting chapter deals with sources of design; it is curious to note among these a London publication, Stalker's Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing. The author well insists on Du Paquier's independence of Meissen influence, in spite of occasional copying of Meissen shapes. The Vienna forms are essentially baroque, with a gravity, sometimes pon- derous, which never developed into the light rococo animation of the older factory; their inspiration is seldom derived, like that of so much Meissen, from the Far East, but rather from goldsmith's work, and it is significant that Vienna porcelain was often so highly valued as to be deemed worthy of being mounted in gold. At their best, as a glance at the copious illustrations of specimens drawn from a wide field will show, Du Paquier's wares have a massive dignity which is admirably set off by enamelled decoration of a kind quite recog- nizably sui generis; the colours used are of a peculiar and charming quality. In figure-modelling the factory never rose to the height of inspiration which animates the work of Kindler and his associates at Meissen; the graceful crouching youths on the Itagere, reproduced in pl.66, are quite an exception to the squat, wooden shapes which represent, as a rule, the modellers' best attainments. The chromatic qualities of Du Paquier's decoration, giving 'Heiter- keit und naive Anmut' to the baroque forms, are well stressed in the introduction, by Wilhelm Mrazek, to another publication, the little book on the factory which has recently been issued by the Oesterreich- isches Museum fur Angewandte Kunst; the illustrations to this exemplary museum picture-book are usefully complimentary to those of Mr Hayward. Two other books in the same series have been received from this museum, showing the same high standard of production. One of these, on Venetian glass, has a short text by Dr Ignaz Schlosser; he gives an in- teresting analysis of the forms in which the glassblowers of Venice in the Renaissance period attained a supremacy lost by them when rivalry with the art of the rock crystal carver compelled them to adopt glyptic decoration, and never since re- gained; the loveliness of their endless variations on the themes 'bowl' and 'stem' can be judged from the specimens in the museum shown in the forty-eight plates. The second handbook in question deals with the museum's unsurpassed collection of Oriental carpets. Here again, there is an introduction - by Siegfried Toller - for the guidance of the amateur. The technique of carpet-weaving, born of a primitive desire for something more attractive to the eye than the unworked hide and fleece of animals' skins, is briefly described; the various national types - Persian, Indian, Turkish, Caucasian - are then surveyed, under their local variations, with allusion to the symbolism and psychological signi- ficance underlying the motives of design. An excellent feature of the illustrations is the inclusion of a number of large-scale details from the carpets shown in their entirety. BERNARD RACKHAM Four Hundred Centuries of Cave Art. By Abbe H. Breuil, trans. Mary E. Boyle. 447 pp. (531 ill.) Montignac, Dordogne (Centre d'Etudes et de Documentation Prehistoriques); London (Zwemmer); paper covers, 6200 frs; bound, 6500 frs, ?77 During the last fifty years, the study of pre- historic art has revolved increasingly around the figure of the Abbe Breuil. When a new cave has been discovered, the Abbe has been among the first to investigate its contents. When paintings have had to be copied, it is the Abbe who once again has played a tireless role. Indeed, more than any other single scholar of our time, he is responsible for salvaging for the future these earliest examples of human expres- sion. The present volume is the culmination of a lifetime's labour and is the most com- prehensive survey ever to be made of pre- historic art. Not only is it magnificently 343</page></plain_text>
