<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cremation Graves in Northwest Pakistan and Their Eurasian Connections: Remarks and Hypotheses by Giorgio Stacul In an earlier study that examined various culture phases present in the Swat Valley during protohistory, we noted the different components that distinguish certain periods, especially the most ancient fades in the cemeteries of Loebanr I, K?telai I and Butkara II, fairly datable to the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. C). We saw, in fact, that in the period indicated, the rite of inhumation coexists along with that of cremation, while the graves have different groupings and different kinds of furnishings according to the burial rite practiced (2). We deduced from that a probable differentiation of the tribal groups settled in the Valley in that period; this differentiation might be explained by the various influences ? or actual waves of migration ? to which the region may have been subjected in the epoch under examination. What are the origins of the different cultural components present in the Sw?t Valley in the last three or four centuries of the 2nd millennium B.C.? While examination of the inhumation graves has shown various resemblances to north? ern Iran, especially to the fades referred to the 1st period of the Iron Age, it is much harder to establish similarities for the graves marked by the cremation type of burial, since for the moment no cultural aspects that resemble them have been found in nearby areas, above all those near the northwest regions of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent (3).

(3) Cremation graves dated to the Late Bronze Age have recently been discovered in the cemetery at Tulhar, in southern Tadjikistan, near the confluence of the Kafirnigan River and the Amu Darya: see A.M. Mandel'stam, Pamjatniki epohi bronza v juznom Tadzikistane {MIA, 145), 1968. Nevertheless, the furnishings and other distinctive elements of these graves do not seem to show correlations with the cremation graves of North? west Pakistan that are being examined here. The presence of solar emblems and swastikas (formed with rows of stones on the floor of the graves) in the cremation graves at Tulhar, has suggested that this fades of southern Tadjikistan may be derived from the Andronovo culture of Siberia, in which the cremation rite connected with swastika emblems can be found (see G. Frumkin, Archaeology in Soviet Central Asia, Leiden-K?ln, 1970, p. 68). 9</page><page sequence="2">Apart from frequent evidence of crematory rites going back to neolithic times, we can distinguish two different cultural areas in Eurasia where true cemeteries with cremation graves dated to the chalcolithic period can be found: an area in southern Anatolia, where recent excavations have brought to light graves with crematory urns earlier than the Hittite period (4); and an area in the Middle Danubian Basin, where the same rite was widely prac? ticed by the peoples of the Baden-Pecel Culture between the end of the 3rd and the begin? ning of the 2nd millennium B.C. (5). Another concentration of cemeteries with cremation graves appears later in the area between the lower Volga and the southern Urals, during the Classical Timber-grave period (6). It is perhaps no accident that these different areas in which we find the rite of crema? tion prevail, well in advance of the impressive European phenomenon of Urnfields, were along with the Caucasian region, the most important metal-producing areas of that time: hence the hypothesis, proposed some time before, that the first important conquests of metallurgy and the consequent capacity for innovation recognized in fire were determining factors in the change in burial customs (7). The strong Anatolian component in the Danubian culture of Baden-Pecel has been emphasized on various occasions; it can probably be explained by movements of expansion in a S-N direction, which took place at the end of the 3rd millennium B.C. and had Asia Minor as their centre (8). Some scholars have suggested the possibility that the cremation rite may have been introduced into this area by tribal groups that originated in Anatolia, and this hypothesis is supported by the recent discovery of cremation graves in Asia Minor dated to the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C. (*). The Middle Danube area also had a strong concentration of cemeteries with cremation graves in the Early and Middle Bronze Age, till past the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C., when this type of ritual prevailed more or less thoroughly among the various cul? tures settled in the Great Hungarian Plain, that is, among the Caka-Nagejev, Hatvan, Kisa postag, North Pannonian Encrusted Pottery and Vatya cultures. These are partly contem? porary, variously differentiated and correlated to one another, and have a highly significant element in common: they seem to be fundamentally extraneous to that cultural strain that goes back to the traditions of the so-called Kurgan peoples, that is, to that vast movement of expansion of the tribal groups native to the steppe area, distinguished, among other things, by the habit of inhuming and strewing the bodies with a layer of ochre powder.

We have thought it opportune to dwell on these characteristics, and especially on those typical of some of the Danubian regions of Central Europe, because this important area of cultural concentration and divulgation furnished the impulse development ? in the Middle and Late Bronze Age ? for migratory movements of expansion destined to have deep repercussions not only in Europe and the eastern basin of the Mediterranean, but most likely even within Asia itself, as far as the northwest regions of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent, as would seem to be shown by certain data we shall now present. In the Pakistan valleys of the Swat and Panjkora Rivers, where the Italian Archaeo? logical Mission (IsMEO) and the University of Peshawar (21) have carried out many excava? tions in recent years, the rite of cremation probably takes root after the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. and lasts for a long time, through successive cultural phases (12). But only in the initial phase does this rite seem dominant (in the last three or four centuries of the 2nd millennium B.C., and perhaps at the very start of the following millennium), that is, in what corresponds in the Swat Valley to our cultural Period V (13). In the cremation graves referred to the above period, the most common type of cine? rary urn is a large vase with a globular-oval body, wide mouth, flaring rim and disk base (14). Antecedents for this type of urn can be found in the cemetery of Gedikly in Ana? tolia (15) and later in various crematory cemeteries of the Middle Danube, referred to the Hatvan and Kisapostag cultures (T?szeg B phase), datable to about the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. (16). A distinctive trait common to a large part of these Pakistani urns is the presence of plastic decoration, of clearly anthropomorphic inspiration, found on the body and near the neck of these containers. These are the so-called ? face-urns ?, known in various types, where the essential features of the human face are shown with holes (eye and mouth indi? cations) and sometimes with relief modelling too (bridge of nose, eye-sockets) (figs. 1, 3). It is significant that anthropomorphically inspired ? face-urns ? containing cremation remains have been found in the Middle Danubian Basin, even dating back to the end of the chal colithic period, in a final phase of the Baden-Pecel culture dated to about 2000 B.C. (17). (10) N.J. Merpert, ?Eneolit stepnoj polosy evropejskoj casti SSSR?, L'Europe a la fin de Vage de la pierre, Praha, 1961, pp. 161 f.; Gim butas, op. cit.y pp. 188 ff.; S.

I-IV. 11</page><page sequence="4">This type of urn is most likely derived from earlier Anatolian prototypes, especially com? mon in the phases of Troy II-V (18); but we should not underestimate the fact that in the area of the Balkans and the Middle Danube the use of anthropomorphic vases traditionally goes back to the late neolithic period, when the use of this kind of container does not as yet seem to have been related to burial rites (19). In cultural Period VI of the Sw?t Valley, we still find crematory urns decorated with anthropomorphic motifs, clearly based on the ? face-urns ? of the preceding period. The latter is in fact followed by the so-called ? eye-bearing urns ?, where all reference to the human figure is limited to the eyes, expressed only with a pair of holes (figs. 2, 5). It should be noted that the anthropomorphic urn is widespread in cremation graves in Central Europe, going back to the Early and Middle Bronze Age; in these, the eye and breast motifs placed near the neck or rim of large jars are shown in a pair of indentations or protuberances {figs. 4, 8) (20). Similar anthropomorphic examples, specifically linked to the concept of the ? eye-bearing urns ?, are common in Central Europe itself and, at a later date, in Northern Europe; we find them mainly in the Early Iron Age or Haistatt C Period, when they spread from Moravia to the Baltic, but are present above all in Pomerania (21). These last cinerary urns are more or less contemporary with the later ? eye-bearing urns ? of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent, with which they seem to share the shape of the con? tainer as well (compare fig. 5 with fig. 6). Apart from burial in jars after cremation, we also find burial in earthenware box-shaped urns in the Sw?t Valley, usually with a sequence of three or four holes on one side (figs. 11-14). We have already stated the fact that rectangular urns containing cremation remains and based on the idea of a hut, are thought to have been used in Palestine far back in time, perhaps at the end of the 4th millennium B.C. (22). But apart from these remote archetypes, we find there is a significant parallel between the above-mentioned Sw?t urns (cultural Period V) and similar cinerary urns from two different graves in northwest Hungary (North Pan nonian Encrusted Pottery Culture), dated to about the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. (fig. 15) (23). These Hungarian examples do not have hole sequences on the sides, as the Sw?t urns always do. It should be noted, though, that other finds from Hungary itself supply us with highly interesting chances for comparison, apart from the different uses to which the objects themselves were put: we are referring to a terracotta cart model with a sequence of four holes on two opposite sides, like the Sw?t box-urns (except for the tiny (18) W.

There is still another type of urn, common in the Danubian cemeteries of the Early and Middle Bronze Age, which can be compared to the cultural horizon of nortwest Pa? kistan mentioned above: this is a vase with a high, funnel-shaped neck and a round or vaguely biconical body, and it is characteristic of the Hatvan, Kisapostag and Vatya cultures (fig. 10) (26). A similar type of container with a round body is frequently found in the crema? tion graves of Swat dated to cultural Period V, where it is always used as furnishing (fig. 9) (2T). In certain cases, the likeness also extends to decorative motifs, especially to the multiple small cordon on the neck, to which large modelled semicircles, probably with an anthropomorphic meaning, are sometimes added on the shoulders (28). Generally one can note that the modelled motifs with an anthropomorphic meaning are widespread in the Middle Danubian Basin as decoration for cinerary urns going back to the Early and Middle Bronze Age, above all on pottery of the Hatvan-Kisapostag cultures referred to the T?szeg B phase. We find this detail interesting, because a similar preva? lence of modeled decoration with analogous meaning can also be found on the urns and other furnishing-vases of the most ancient cremation graves of northwest Pakistan, which often have motifs exactly like those met with on earlier Danubian vases. We refer in par? ticular to the groups of two, three or four bosses (fig. 7) (29), which were perhaps indica? tions of breasts symbolizing a female goddess; to the single or paired semicircles that can be interpreted as orbital signs referring to the same goddess (30); and to the vertical seg? ments in groups of three or four, generally accompanied by horizontal cordons, that pro? bably represented pendants (fig. 1, first to the right) (31). The motifs of incised decoration, present above all on the Sw?t Valley pottery dated to cultural Period VI, also show significant similarities to vase ornamentation common in the Middle Danubian Basin in the Early and Middle Bronze Age. This is true for the tree-shaped motif (32), the W-shaped one (33), the oblique line or V-motif with a row of dots on both sides (34) and the concentric semicircles surrounded by small dots and radial marks, (24) Kalicz, Die Fr?hbronzezeit..., cit., pi.

Let us note that the ? X ? decoration found on the chests of some human figurines placed at times even inside the cinerary urn, and present in Sw?t Valley graves dated to cultural Period V (36), is also met with on Danubian idols referred to the Baden-Pecel cul? ture (37), while earlier examples with similar decoration have appeared in Anatolia and on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean (38). Lastly, a separate observation must be made for the small metal objects found inside the Sw?t cinerary urns; they generally date from cultural Period V and are always of copper, mostly in the shape of large pins. The relative simplicity of the various types advises caution in assigning them possible resemblances or identity with examples from other cultures; but it may not be wholly accidental that the main metallic types found in the Sw?t Valley, in the above-mentioned cultural horizon, have antecedents in the area of the Middle Danubian Basin, referable to the Early Bronze Age or to the Middle Bronze Age. We are referring in particular to the conical-headed pins (39), those with a disk head (40), with a small loop head (41) and with a broad flat head (42), as well as to small dagger blades or knives (43); in the period we have mentioned, the main area of European diffusion of the above-mentioned finds seems to be located between northern Hungary and Slovakia. -k Jc &amp; Scholars of prehistory and protohistory are quite accustomed to similarities and affi? nities, often extremely precise and significant, between noteworthy cultural aspects of re? gions of Eurasia far distant from one another. As regards the Late Neolithic Period, one need only mention the resemblances noted between the Ukrainian culture of Tripolje and that of Yang-shao in China, concerning the common use of polychrome vases decorated with a very special type of spiral-shaped motif (44).

Pontic migration ? (45). The isolated presence in Cen? tral Asia of peoples belonging to Western Indo-European groups ? the so-called Tokha rians ? has also aroused various suppositions as to the more or less consistent shifting of human groups from West to East, from the territories of Central-eastern Europe to the northern oases of the Taklamakan desert, in present Chinese Sinkiang (46). But these reconstruction attempts can only be expressed with cautious reservation, and then mainly as temporary work hypotheses, given both the extremely scarce and fragmen? tary documentation we now have on so many geographical areas (and above all on Central Asia), and the fact that much of our data is far from convincing or definitive, and there? fore open to further revision. Only by taking this situation into account can one try, in a wholly preliminary way, to interpret the meaning of the analogies met with between the horizon of northwest Pa? kistan marked by the presence of cemeteries with cremation graves, and similar cultural aspects that appear earlier, above all in the Middle Danubian Basin; on the basis of the data presented above, these analogies can be summed up as follows: a) the practice of cremation; b) the use of the so-called ? face-urns ?, ? eye-bearing urns ? and ? box-urns ?; c) the use of plastic and incised decoration, with particular reference to certain spe? cific motifs with an anthropomorphic meaning. We are definitely not dealing here with completely casual resemblances or with simple analogies derived from coincidental factors of environment; and so we must take into ac? count the possibility of a relationship of dependence between these manifestations. Various interpretations can be made of their true nature and consistency. That is, we can assume we are concerned here with a phenomenon of typological and cultural diffusion derived from normal trade contacts and slowly developed between neighbouring cultures related to one another in various ways; or with an actual superimposition of new human groups, not necessarily massive but weighty enough to dominate to a certain degree. Even this second possibility might be explained by different kinds of causes: that is, it might be the product of tribal pruning, involving the periodic expulsion of small groups to cut down the number VOriente, Roma, 1961, pp. 93 f.; W.

Pontic migration ? a few centuries later. Let us now examine the elements that support this last hypothesis. We have already pointed out that in the Middle Danubian Basin during the Early Bronze Age, the cremation rite prevails among cultures that remained basically extraneous to the superimposition or to the influence of the so-called Kurgan peoples. Not only the presence of particularly evolved agricultural cultures, but also and above all the control of important sources of metallurgical production, from Slovakia to Transylvania, may have favoured the relatively autonomous development of this important area of cultural concen? tration. Only after the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. did other tribal groups, in cer? tain respects similar to the Kurgan peoples (48), gain control of the Great Hungarian Plain, causing the rapid decline of the pre-existent local cultures. We are in fact dealing here with the emergence of the so-called Tumulus Culture (H?gelgrabenkultur); its violent seizure of these territories is shown in the stratigraphical data that bears witness to impres? sive levels of fire and destruction after the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. (49). What was the fate of those tribal groups that survived? The progressive destruction of the large settlements, which reached its peak at the end of the 14th cent. B.C., was accompanied by a so-called period of migration; this was a long phase of cultural adjustment that may have led tribal groups native to the Hun? garian Plain and other surrounding territories to carry out widespread migration in many directions (50). In our opinion, it is still difficult to decide to what degree these movements, that helped to spread the crematory rite to different European regions, should be referred to groups belonging to the old Middle Danubian substratum that tried to escape from the pres? sure of the warriors with the ? long swords ?, or should be considered the expression of a new culture that arose from the fusion of that same substratum with the peoples of the H?gelgrabenkultur (51). The fact remains that these expansive migratory movements, which had the Middle Danubian Basin as their centre, were in all probability not only directed towards the West (47) S. Ferri, ?

Various resemblances suggest the wisdom of taking another possibility under consideration: that of migration towards the East, which might also have been justified by the minor cultural density in that area and therefore by the minor resistence that eventual migratory groups would have faced as they crossed the Eurasian steppes. The way of the steppes towards Central Asia was probably not unknown to the tribal groups that lived in the Great Hungarian Plain in the early metal age; in fact, this area is the furthest western point of that immense strip of prairie and desert that stretches to the east as far as Manchuria. Some significant similarities have already been noted between typological aspects peculiar to the Baden-Pecel culture and to that of Sh?h Tepe in nort? hern Iran (52). Other signs let us presume the possibility of earlier relations between Sh?h Tepe itself and the Danubian culture of Lengyel, to be dated to about the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C. (55). An anthropological examination has also suggested the chance that there may have been sizeable settlements of Danubian peoples in the southern area of Turk? menistan from the first neolithic period (54). The propelling forces of expansion that brought the cultures of the Middle Danubian Basin towards the steppes of the East, are also confirmed for the Middle and Late Bronze Age by the various discoveries of metal objects of the ? Hungarian ? Koszider type (Ko marov culture) in many areas of the Ukraine, and especially along the Lower Dnieper and the coasts of the Sea of Azov (55). One current stemming from this same western origin may have settled later in the area of the Srubnaja culture located in the zone of the Lower Volga D. As regards the spread ? in the same period ? of the metallic types typical of Eastern Europe into various regions of the Middle East, the possible derivation of the ? antennae ? swords and daggers of the upper plain of the Ganges from Caucasian and probably Balkan prototypes has already been underlined (57). The bronze sword found by chance at Rajanpur in the Panjab, dated to the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C., probably shares the (52) V. Milojcic, ?

(53) Formal elements common to the ceramics of Sh?h Tepe III-II and of Lengyel, are given by the recurrence in the respective productions of vases in which the lower part of the body has a convex profile (compare T.J. Arne, Excavations at Shah Tepe, Stokholm, 1945, figs. 188-192, 369 374, with J. Dombay, Die Siedlung und das Gr?berfeld in Zeng?varkony, Budapest, 1960, pls.

Further possible confirmation of such Eurasian correlations, the result of migratory or trade currents datable to the Middle or Late Bronze Age, might be the significant resemblance between certain flat copper anthropo? morphic figurines from the upper plain of the Ganges (59) and the various spiral-shaped pendants of the ? Hungarian ? Koszider type, also thought to be a derivation of the sacred ivy-life motif (60). There is also the significant fact that a ? Hungarians ? Koszider type of circular pendant, with cruciform decoration and embossed reliefs (61), can be found with certain variants in the Caucasus (62) and later in Iran (63) and in Northwest Pakistan (64). As regards in particular the appearance of the crematory tradition in the regions of Northwest Pakistan, if we admit the possibility of a relation of dependence on the area of the Middle Danubian Basin, we must presume that the circumstances that originated these relations go back to a period earlier than the 13th cent. B.C., that is, to the period usually considered to have seen the start of the European phenomenon of Urnfields. In fact, we have noted that the typological and cultural aspects common to the oldest Pakistani fades marked by the presence of cremation graves, finds resemblances above all in the main cultures of the Early and Middle Bronze Age in the Middle Danube: the late Hatvan, Kisapostag, North Pannonian and Vatya Cultures, the definitive disappearance of which, after the rise of the Tumulus Culture, can probably be placed within the 14th cent. B.C. (65). But that same Pakistani fades does not show other aspects that might indicate contacts with the Late Bronze Age Danubian cultures; as for example, in regard to the pottery typology, the almost baroque style with recurring spirals and twining volutes, the vases with large breast-shaped bosses, the biconical urns, etc., even taking into account the inevitable impoverishment these shapes must be subjected to in a different cultural environ? ment (there is a significant lack of handles in all the protohistoric pottery of the Indo? Pakistan sub-continent, even when involving shapes derived from prototypes with handles). There are certain hints, though, that make us think possible the existence of relations of dependence in a later period, after the end of the 2nd millennium B.C. We might inter? pret in this way the presence in the Sw?t Valley, in the horizon that corresponds to cul? tural Period VI, of elements that clearly imitate derivations from the Central European tradition of cord pottery, or else the recurrence of motifs of incised decoration ? suggest? ing a solar ideology as well ? that are known in the cultures of the Early Bronze Age in (58) Piggott, op. cit., p. 236.

There is also a certain significant synchronism in the recurrence of the so-called ? eye-bear? ing urns ? in specific regions of Europe and northwest Pakistan. This data definitely tend to suggest the possibility that repeated movements of ex? pansion that radiated from Central Europe may have been able to penetrate deeply towards the East, perhaps following a common migratory iter. These shifts may not have been isolated, given the particular moment in which they took place: that is, corresponding to those vast and prolonged phenomena of movement with the consequent new cultural arran? gements, that had the Middle Danubian Basin as their centre. They were destined to have deep effects not only on continental Europe, with the spread of the various Urnfield cul? tures, but also on Anatolia, Syria and Egypt as well (66). At least for the moment, a crucial lack of data relative to vast geographical areas prevents a more precise formulation of our assumption. Even the archaeological documen? tation to which we refer, regarding the Pakistani fades, is still far from thorough in its basic data (67). At any rate, we are convinced that further research into the problems broached here cannot limit itself to data collected by archaeological investigation: even though the typological correlations of the finds may be suggestive and precise, they will have to be integrated with the research contribution of other fields of inquiry, such as that of linguistics, as it is more than likely indeed that the supposed migratory thrusts, at the origin of the cor? relations we have established, cannot be considered outside those movements of tribal groups that introduced Indo-European idioms into the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent and Central Asia &lt;(68). A problem, the last one, the complex nature of which may perhaps be reflected in the different components that appear in a single cultural horizon in the Swat Valley.
