UMANSK Y  Central Conference of American (Reform ) Rabbi s (CCAR) gathere d  together at the historic Pittsburgh Convention of 18856 that "Refor m  Judaism wil l neve r reac h it s highe r goa l [o f spiritua l an d mora l  elevation] withou t havin g first  accorde d t o th e congregationa l  council an d i n th e entir e religiou s an d mora l spher e o f life , equa l  voice to woman with man." 7  Yet, Classica l Reform' s commitmen t t o women' s equalit y wa s  more theoretical than real . As Riv-Ellen Prell has observed,  The Reformer's concer n fo r women was an inevitable outgrowth of  their commitment to the Enlightenment's values of equality, reason,  and humanism. That the role of women in Judaism was not actively  addressed until the last decade of feminist activism in America, de- spite its prominence in Reform's initial program, is as much because  social reality lags behind ideology as it is because the women's issue  for Reformer s wa s a  logica l consequenc e o f thei r ideology , no t a  central cause.8  My own researc h o n th e role s an d statu s o f wome n i n Refor m  Judaism bears out Prell' s assessment. Despite early pronouncement s  of commitment t o women's equality in Germany and in the United  States, "i t wa s not unti l th e lat e 1960s , as the burgeonin g feminis t  movement [i n th e U.S. ] began t o creat e ne w expectation s amon g  women themselves, " tha t Refor m wome n bega n t o pres s fo r an d  achieve significan t change. 9 Thus , eve n thoug h member s o f th e  CCAR overwhelmingly passe d a  resolutio n a s earl y a s 192 2 main - taining tha t wome n coul d no t "justl y b e denie d th e privileg e o f  ordination," it was not unti l 197 2 that women gained entrance into  the Reform rabbinate. 10  In attemptin g t o ascertai n wh y thi s wa s so , i t i s instructive t o  examine more closely the 1922 CCAR Resolution and the discussion  preceding its adoption. Rather than arguing for women's ordination  (perhaps on the basis of Reform's understanding of progressive reve- lation or of the need to create a Judaism more in line with the spirit  of th e moder n age) , supporter s o f th e resolutio n maintaine d that ,  given all that Reform stood for (o r did not stand for, including strict  observance of traditional Jewish practice), there were no legitimate  reasons for denying women th e opportunity t o become Reform rab - bis.

Th e first,  Tehilla Lichtenstein, assumed spiritual leadership of the New York- based Societ y o f Jewis h Science , a  Jewis h countermovemen t t o  Christian Science , i n 1938 . While Jewish Scienc e di d no t formall y  affiliate wit h Reform , it s major proponents , includin g the Society' s  founder, Tehill a Lichtenstein' s husband Morris , were Reform rabbi s  and member s of the CCAR . Throughou t th e 1920 s and 1930s , some  of them attempte d wit h littl e succes s t o induc e th e CCA R t o en - dorse it s understandin g o f spiritua l healin g a s centra l t o Jewis h  religious life. Therefore, member s of the Central Conference i n 1956  were no t unawar e o f Tehill a Lichtenstein' s achievements . Indeed ,  by then she had been leader of the Society for almost twenty years—  a position that she retained unti l her death in 1973.  Perhaps mor e influentia l wa s Paul a Ackerman , wh o assumed  spiritual leadership of Reform congregatio n Beth Israel in Meridian ,  Mississippi, in 1951 , following the death of her husband, th e congre- gation's rabbi .

UMANSK Y  gation's request tha t Ackerman serve as their leader, seems to indi- cate tha t initia l approva l o f this request reflecte d a  desire, a t leas t  by some Reform rabbis, including Eisendrath, to determine whether  women could gain congregational acceptanc e as religious leaders.14  This interpretation o f rabbinic interes t i n Ackerman' s tenur e a t  Temple Bet h Israe l i s strengthened b y Michael Meyer' s claim tha t  by the end of the 1940s "the Hebrew Union College found itsel f hard  pressed to keep up with th e demand fo r rabbis." Responding as best  it could to Reform's congregational growth, HUC introduced a  more  active recruitmen t progra m an d i n 195 0 merged wit h th e Jewis h  Institute o f Religion . Consequently , Meye r writes , "from les s tha n  500 rabbis in 1943 , [CCAR] membership rose to 850 in 1964 and grew  even more rapidly thereafter." 15  Finally, a  ne w receptivenes s i n 195 6 t o th e ide a o f wome n a s  rabbis may be attributed t o new leadership. Certainly, the member- ship of the Boar d o f Governors had change d sinc e 1922 , as had th e  presidency o f the College . Even befor e th e CCAR voted t o reaffir m  the 192 2 resolutio n supportin g th e entranc e o f wome n int o th e  Reform rabbinate , Nelso n Glueck , the n presiden t o f th e Hebre w  Union College-Jewis h Institut e o f Religio n (HUC-JIR) , publicl y  expressed hi s suppor t fo r thi s proposa l an d state d tha t th e Refor m  seminary woul d ordai n an y woma n wh o passe d th e require d  courses.16  Yet i t wa s no t unti l th e lat e 1960s , when Sall y Priesand , afte r  receiving a  joint B.A . degre e from  HUC-JIR an d th e Universit y o f  Cincinnati, decided t o continue he r studies a t HUC, that th e doors  to the Reform rabbinate were finally opened to women. I t should be  noted tha t Priesand' s decisio n t o ente r HUC s rabbinica l progra m  came with littl e fanfare. 17 Tha t Priesand  complete d he r rabbinica l  studies and received ordination testifie s both to her tenacity an d t o  the suppor t o f member s o f th e facult y an d administration , mos t  notably Glueck and Alfred Gottschalk , who succeeded Glueck afte r  his death in 1971 as president of HUC-JIR.  In short , i t was not a  change i n Reform ideolog y tha t le d to th e  ordination o f women a s Reform rabbis ; i t wa s th e change d socia l  climate o f th e lat e 1960s. 18 Female religiou s leader s wer e gainin g  acceptance withi n Protestan t denominations ; qualifie d wome n  were intereste d i n enterin g th e rabbinate ; ther e wer e indication s  </page> <page sequence="7"> FEMINISM AND AMERICAN REFORM JUDAISM Y]\  that congregations might be willing to accept them; and the Reform  movement was in need of more rabbis to serve its congregations.  Feminism doe s no t seem t o hav e directl y le d t o th e entranc e o f  women int o th e Reform rabbinate . Indeed , i n the lat e 1960s , when  Sally Priesand entere d HUC' s rabbinical program , th e second wav e  of American feminism, spurred by the publication of Betty Friedan's  Feminine Mystique  i n 1964 , was stil l i n it s infancy .

Nonetheless, the impact of feminism on the ordination of women  as Reform rabbi s sinc e th e earl y 1970 s cannot b e underestimated .  Feminism insure d tha t onc e wome n wer e grante d th e privileg e o f  ordination, a  sufficien t numbe r o f qualifie d wome n woul d see k t o  enter the Reform rabbinat e with al l of its personal an d professiona l  demands. Sinc e th e mid-1980s , feminism ha s take n deepe r roo t i n  the Jewish community . A s women rabbi s within th e Reform move - ment have become more visible and accepted, standing on the bima  beside equall y visibl e wome n cantor s wh o gaine d entranc e int o  the Reform cantorat e i n 1975 , feminist expectation s hav e begun t o  transform th e Reform rabbinate. 19  In a n essa y entitle d "Ho w Wome n Ar e Changin g th e [Reform ]  Rabbinate," Rabb i Jane t Marde r point s ou t that , a s o f June 1991 ,  few of the 16 8 women ordained b y HUC-JIR "have achieved promi - nent positions of leadership in the movement" :  None head s a  thousand-membe r congregation ; onl y thre e serv e a s  senior rabbis of congregations larger than 300. But it would be wrong  to conclude that women's impact on the [Reform] rabbinate has been  minimal. On the contrary, one senses in conversations with women  rabbis that we are witnessing the beginning of a profound transforma- tion withi n th e rabbinate—a chang e brough t abou t b y distinctive  values and goals women have brought to this once exclusively male  enterprise.20  Many women rabbis , she maintains , consciousl y se e themselves a s  "agents fo r change " an d ar e attemptin g t o reshap e th e rol e o f th e  American Reform rabbi .

While American feminism o f the lat e 1960 s and early 1970 s may  have viewe d th e struggl e fo r women' s equalit y a s th e gainin g o f  equal pay for equal work, by the 1980s increasing numbers of white,  middle-class feminists (includin g Jewish feminists) bega n to rethink  the notio n o f equality . I f equalit y mean t workin g eight y hour s a  week a t a  high-pressure job a t th e expense of one's health, family ,  and friends , perhap s the concept needed t o be redefined.

"  Consequently, man y feminist s o f th e lat e 1980 s and earl y 1990 s  replaced th e notion o f "having i t all " with tha t o f "achieving bal - ance." Whil e no t al l o f the 16 8 women ordaine d a s Reform rabbi s  would identif y themselve s a s feminists , th e feminis t emphasi s o n  balance has proved t o be appealing no t just t o the vast majority o f  women rabbis but to a  small but growing number of male rabbis as  well. Marde r note s tha t "man y younge r mal e rabbi s ar e tryin g t o  make family tim e a  priority." While some of those she interviewed  doubted whethe r thi s was a  realistic expectation , I  have observed ,  as a  forme r facult y membe r a t HUC-JI R i n Ne w Yor k an d a s a  lecturer o r scholar-in-residence a t dozen s o f Reform congregation s  throughout th e country , tha t Marder' s observatio n i s accurate . I  have hear d a n increasin g numbe r o f Refor m rabbis , mal e an d fe - male, ask , "How can I  teach my congregants about the importanc e  that Judaism attaches to family lif e and then sacrifice my own?"21  This questio n i s relate d t o th e tw o othe r feminis t value s tha t  Marder describes in her essay: intimacy and empowerment . A s psy- chologist Caro l Gilligan , theologia n Catherin e Keller , an d other s  have noted , wome n see m t o plac e greate r valu e tha n d o men o n  human relationships , a  value that Kelle r calls "connectedness" and  </page> <page sequence="9"> FEMINISM AN D AMERICA N REFOR M JUDAIS M 27 3  that Gilliga n identifie s a s a n "ethic s o f care." 22 Whethe r biologi - cally or culturally based (o r both), concern for others is reflected i n  what Marde r describe s a s intimacy: th e desir e among many o f th e  women rabbi s who m sh e interviewe d t o for m clos e relationship s  with thei r congregants, leading them to choose small congregation s  in whic h i t wa s easie r t o creat e a  sens e o f community .

No t  only i s ther e n o evidenc e tha t support s thi s claim , bu t th e dat a  seem to point to a different conclusion . While women on the whole  do not seem to be seeking larger pulpits, most male rabbis still hope  to move to larger, "more prestigious" congregations.23 Certainly th e  desire for greate r intimacy i s not th e only reason why the majorit y  of wome n rabbi s hav e no t aspire d t o large r pulpits . No r d o mal e  rabbis wh o aspir e t o large r congregation s necessaril y fea r o r lac k  interest in intimacy. Bu t if feminism ha s influenced th e decision of  many women rabbi s not t o seek larger, mor e prestigious pulpits , i t  has also meant tha t ther e ar e few i f any women rabbi s today wh o  can be considered among the leaders of American Reform .

A s early a s 1970,  96 percent o f al l Reform temple s in the United State s had elected a  woman t o thei r congregationa l boards . Since then, th e number s of  women serving on board s and a s officers o f their congregations ha s  increased further . B y the mid-1970s , i t wa s no longer unusual fo r a  woman to serve as synagogue president .  While much o f the leadershi p of the Union of American Hebre w  Congregations (UAHC ) remain s male , wome n hav e increasingl y  assumed position s o f leadership withi n th e movemen t a s a  whole .  Since 1973 , for example , whe n th e UAH C electe d it s first  woma n  vice-chair, severa l women have been elected to this position.29  Eleanor Schwartz , th e forme r executiv e directo r o f th e Wome n  of Reform Judaism (formerl y know n a s the Nationa l Federatio n o f  Temple Sisterhoods) , ha s argued tha t feminism i s currently havin g  a positive impact upon the organization. Sh e maintains tha t sister - hoods, always "radical i n goal if not i n style," recently have begun  to attrac t younger , college-educated , professiona l wome n wh o  would no t have considered joining the sisterhood of their congrega - tion twenty years ago. 30 According to Schwartz, templ e sisterhood s  seem t o b e "undergoin g a  renaissance " a s th e participatio n o f  women i n Refor m congregation s ha s increased , a s mor e wome n  have taken on leadership roles in thei r synagogues and in the secu- lar world , an d a s feminis m ha s reasserte d th e importanc e o f  women's organizations and of women's forming social, professional ,  and spiritua l bond s wit h on e another . T o b e sure , no t al l loca l  sisterhoods ar e flourishing,  bu t Schwart z predict s tha t th e numbe r  of local chapters throughout the United States will rise.31  Feminism ha s als o affecte d religiou s educatio n withi n th e Re - form movement. By the mid-1970s religious school textbooks "began  to presen t femal e rol e model s other tha n mother s an d teachers." 32  Growing numbers of women have gained full-time position s within  the las t decad e a s educatio n director s o f Refor m congregations ,  where they have become increasingly involved in selecting the text- books bein g used .

Michael Meyer maintains that the increasing influence of  the feminis t movemen t account s for beginning effort s t o eliminat e  gender-based language :  Gates of  Prayer [published i n 1975 ] in it s English portions removed  male languag e i n referenc e t o th e worshipers : "al l men " becam e  "all"; "fellowship" became "friendship/* One English version of the  Avot praye r made reference t o the "God of our mothers" as well as  our fathers. Yet , although there were experimental substitutions of  nongender names and pronoun s als o for God , th e standard Reform  liturgy i n the 1970 s continued t o refer t o deity a s "our Father , our  King" and a s "He" and "Him. " Moreover , th e Hebrew prayer s re- mained untouched by feminist criticism.35  By the late 1980s , references to God and the words of Hebrew prayers  were no longer immune to feminist criticism . As a result of changes  on the loca l level , including the creation o f congregational gender - inclusive siddurim,  i t ha s become difficul t t o speak o f a  "standar d  Reform liturgy. " I n response t o increased suppor t from member s of  the Reform rabbinate , cantorate , an d laity, th e Central Conferenc e  of American Rabbis has finally revised some of the services in Gates  of Prayer so that Englis h references t o God are gender inclusive and  the mother s o f Israe l ar e mentione d i n bot h Hebre w an d Englis h  prayers. Similar changes were made to the CCAR Haggadah, origi - nally published in 1974 and revised in 1982: while the earlier edition  refers to God as "Lord" and "King of the universe," the later editio n  identifies God as the less gender-specific "YHVH " and "Sovereign of  existence." All reference s t o God a s "He" are omitted . Two recen t  publications by the CCAR Press refer to God as "Adonai" and "Ruler  of th e Universe, " scrupulousl y avoidin g an y referenc e t o Go d i n  male terms . Bot h text s deliberatel y mak e referenc e t o wome n a s  central to Jewish history and contemporary Jewish life. 36  Thus far , th e feminis t cal l fo r a  mor e radica l revisionin g o f lit - urgy ha s me t wit h resistanc e from th e majorit y o f Reform congre - gants.

Lon g use d b y rabbi s t o mak e traditiona l text s com e  alive, midrash  ha s recently becom e a  popular an d effectiv e mean s  of writing wome n bac k int o biblica l history . A t th e instigatio n o f  Jewish feminists i n the 1970 s and 1980s , growing numbers of Reform  Jews are writing midrashim tha t explor e the actions and feelings of  biblical women and their significance fo r today. 42  Among othe r step s taken b y th e Reform movemen t i n th e 1980 s  for whic h feminis m shoul d receiv e a t leas t partia l credi t wa s th e  adoption b y the CCAR of the patrilinea l descen t resolution .

" A  provis o wa s tha t th e child' s  Jewishness woul d als o b e establishe d "throug h appropriat e an d  timely public and formal act s of identification wit h the Jewish fait h  and people. " Influencing thos e CCAR members who voted in favo r  of the proposal in 198 3 was the recognition that , given men's grow- ing involvement i n th e raising of thei r children (itsel f a  byproduc t  of the feminist movement) , "th e standing of the Jewish spouses and  parents i n mixe d marriages " shoul d b e equalized . Accordin g t o  Rabbi Herma n E . Schaalma n i n hi s 198 7 report t o th e CCA R as - sessing th e patrilinealit y resolution , "equalizatio n o f statu s be - tween female and male .  .  .  [was] the core of our 1983 statement."43  The CCAR adoptio n o f a n a d ho c committee' s repor t o n homo - sexuality an d th e rabbinat e als o reflect s th e impac t o f feminism .  First create d i n 1986 , th e seventeen-membe r committe e sponsore d  an information sessio n a t the 198 7 CCAR convention, loca l consul - tations, an d a  plenary session followed b y workshops a t th e CCAR  convention i n 1989 . Finally , th e committee' s repor t wa s approve d  by the members of the CCAR at the 1990 convention in Seattle. The  most widely publicized aspec t of the repor t was an endorsement of  HUC-JIR's newly introduce d polic y o f viewing th e sexua l orienta - tion o f a n applican t t o HUC-JIR' s rabbini c progra m "onl y withi n  the context of a candidate's overall suitability for the rabbinate." 44  This policy reflected a  change i n th e former polic y of viewing het - erosexuality a s a  necessar y componen t o f rabbinic suitabilit y an d  therefore denying admission to openly gay or lesbian applicants .  The concern o f many within th e Conferenc e abou t homophobi a  in America n societ y an d th e Jewish communit y resulte d i n a  cal l  for "greate r educatio n an d dialogu e i n ou r congregations." 45 More  than a  liberal commitment t o pluralism, thi s also reflects a  growing  awareness, mainl y throug h feminis t writings , tha t religiou s an d  societal attitudes toward homosexuality , lik e religious and societa l  attitudes towar d women , ar e culturall y based . Withi n th e libera l  Jewish community , ther e seems to b e a  growing acknowledgment ,  as Judith Plaskow has written, tha t "the creation of Jewish commu- nities in which differences ar e valued as necessary parts of a greater  whole is the institutional and experiential foundation fo r the recov- </page> <page sequence="15"> FEMINISM AN D AMERICA N REFOR M JUDAIS M 27 9  ery o f th e fullnes s o f Torah." 46 T o b e sure , neithe r th e Refor m  rabbinate nor the laity is unanimous in its support of the ordination  of gay and lesbian Jews. Those within th e Reform movement wh o  value difference do not agree on the kinds of differences that should  be valued. Yet the feminist emphasis on naming and valuing differ- ences echoe s th e libera l commitmen t t o civi l right s and "unity i n  diversity," a s wel l a s t o th e Jewish belie f tha t al l huma n being s  have bee n create d with equa l dignit y an d worth . A s such, i t ha s  clarified and strengthened among many Reform Jews the view that  "homosexuality ca n b e a  legitimate expressio n o f Jewish an d hu- man personhood " an d tha t th e Refor m movemen t shoul d accep t  homosexuals "a s they ar e and not a s we [i.e. , thos e of us who are  heterosexual] would want them to be."47  Last, feminis m t o a  grea t exten t ca n b e held  accountabl e fo r  shifting relationships among the Jewish movements. Many feminist- influenced positions have led to a widening gap between the Reform  and Orthodox movement s a t th e same tim e a s they hav e brough t  Reform and Reconstructionism closer . On the role of women in the  synagogue, Refor m an d Conservatism hav e becom e mor e similar ,  whereas position s o n conversio n an d patrilinea l descen t hav e un- derscored th e difference s betwee n them . I n short , feminis m ha s  become a crucial factor in Reform Judaism's ongoing understanding  of itsel f a s a n authenti c ye t divers e movemen t tha t continue s t o  occupy a  significant plac e i n contemporary America n Jewish reli - gious life.

I  would argu e tha t th e Hebre w "Adonai " (Lord )  remains a  male image of deity. The intention o f the creators of these  new liturgies, however , i s to invoke an image that congregants do not  consciously view a s male, perhaps because they do not know Hebrew,  perhaps because the word "Adonai" does not conjure up as easily the  kinds of exclusively male, anthropomorphic images as does the English  word "Lord."  37.
