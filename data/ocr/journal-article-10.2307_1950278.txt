<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE CHARNER PERRY University of Chicago That an animal, presumably a cousin of the simians and certainly very, similar to them, has developed societies in which millions and even hundreds of mil- lions of individuals live and act together in orderly relation to each other is one of the astounding facts of history; and an impartial observer would hardly be surprised if the incredibly intricate network of cooperation, overstrained, should suddenly tear apart. The aggregation of men into huge organized groups is, of course, relatively recent. For a million years or longer men or near-men lived an animal-like existence, scattered in small groups. It was not until fifteen or twenty thousand years ago that men, perhaps as a consequence of unprecedented pressure from the environment,1 organized groups of any considerable size; it is only within the last three or four thousand years that large-scale societies have existed; and it is only in the last three or four hundred years that complex orderly inter- play and interaction among individuals and subgroups in societies have been developed. It is clear that modern mass society, with its complex and delicate organiza- tion, was not consciously contrived by man, was not planned, blueprinted, and then constructed according to specifications. Many of its features are the unintended consequences of the actions of men who neither foresaw nor desired the consequences. There was trial and error; and one thing led to another, frequently in very surprising fashion. Sometimes men learned a little from their mistakes and sometimes they saw a few steps ahead. At any rate, we now find ourselves in the middle of, and dependent on, vast, intertwined mechanisms of whose principles and internal structure we know very little. It is the case that "History reveals no society which has gained a consciousness of the mechanics and dynamics of its institutions sufficient to prevent their operation to ends quite different from those for which they were devised and quite alien to any comprehensible purpose."2 It is equally clear that the construction of advanced societies has involved considerable foresight, inventiveness, and understanding, and that in the later stages of social development more and more understanding of the functioning of institutions is needed. As individuals, groups, and the factors of existence become more and more interdependent and delicately organized, there is in- creasing danger that the malfunctioning of some part, or the operation of some factor not considered, or a lack of proper adjustment among institutions will produce a serious or even disastrous breakdown. Whether or not systematic knowledge of the workings of social institutions does or will match the need for such knowledge (it may be that the owls of 1 Cf. Rushton Coulborn, "Survival of the Fittest in the Atomic Age," Ethics, Vol. 57, pp. 235-258 (July, 1947). 2 Frank D. Graham, Social Goals and Economic Institutions (Princeton, 1942), p. 5. 394</page><page sequence="2">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 395 Minerva take wing only when the shades of night are falling), the development of complex societies has involved a concomitant development in- man of a considerable body of social lore, compounded of techniques, skills, myths, attitudes, habits of mind, and some foresight and understanding. Institutions, despite figures of speech, are not mechanisms; they are resultants of human behavior; and the existence and operation of institutions are dependent on something which individuals have learned or acquired. Corresponding, then, to the large and complex societies which man has developed there is a body of social lore, perhaps equally complex. What needs emphasis is the newness and the highly artificial character of this social equipment. Though some of it doubtless has very ancient roots, most of it must have been invented or created just when it was first used, developed in action to meet problems that arose. It is highly artificial, not merely because it is made up of artifacts but also because in the cumulative process of invention and creation later inventions were so based on earlier ones that the relation of the result to nature or to human nature became extremely tenuous. Double entry bookkeeping, for instance, is the result of artifice piled upon artifice. The relation between human behavior and the social lore by which it is guided is, of course, not an external one. Social techniques are not tools which one picks up and lays down as one might a hammer. They are integral with the behavior in which they function. It is true that civilized man, like his savage ancestors, is born, eats, sleeps, has children, and dies; but the social roles and the behavior that correspond to social institutions and organizations are in- vented along with the institutions. If society is a recent and relatively sudden creation, then it would seem that a question fundamental to any social science would be whether there is any invention or creation or group of them which is central to the development of complex societies and upon which other social inventions directly or indirectly depend. There would, I think, be little doubt nowadays as to the answer. Language, and various systems of symbols more or less directly dependent on language, are not merely the basic technique but even today the framework up- on which the superstructure of society is supported. Politics is obviously mostly a matter of talk, and so is the law, whether considered in terms of the compelling utterances of judges or the binding words inscribed in the books. Accounting, money (which is a system of sym- bols), contracts (oral or written), and other linguistic phenomena are the essence of business and the market. Production and engineering are dependent on calendars, maps, timetables, blue prints, computations, and specifications. In these forms of social behavior, and in others, language is not merely a tool or instrument, external to the behavior, but is rather the essential stuff or structure of the behavior. Language, of course, is not merely chatter. Monkeys chatter a great deal; but their chatter is functional only in a simple and immediate way. The dis- tinctive fact about language is that man has made chatter functional in a far- reaching and complex fashion so that, all of his behavior is guided by and built</page><page sequence="3">396 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW upon systems of language and symbols. Language is, one might say, what language does, the functions it performs or supports. The functional existence of language is found in the inventions or constructs the development of which constitutes the development of language. These, in conventional terms, are social institutions, art, technology, and science, or, collectively, civilization. Civilization is the functioning of language; and, of course, it is the functioning of language which is interesting and important-considered merely as chatter, language is unimportant and interesting only to specialists in phonetics. We have arrived now at a double fact which has baffled many social scientists and semanticists. If one sets out to study civilization, or any part of it, such as science or social institutions, one is confronted with the fact that the objects to be studied are artificial and that their existence and modes of operation are radically conditioned by systems of language and symbols. If, on the other hand, one turns attention to language, as many people have done from the time of the Greeks, one finds that language is not a self-contained or independent system of natural entities but rather a system of functions coincident with the opera- tion of the various parts of civilization. The frustrated semanticists who hope to discover an isolable system of -denotable objects exhaust themselves in constructing a barbarous terminology for talking about some of the accidental and superficial aspects of language. It is certainly the case, as previously suggested, that the -development of civilization has involved the creation and conservation of a considerable body of lore. This body of lore, 'compounded of techniques, habits of mind, attitudes, sets of distinctions, and, if one may use the term, knowledge, may aptly be called "commonsense" not that it is common in the sense of being a native endowment of man or in the sense of being evenly distributed among men, but because it is the common stock of artifices which men in varying degrees assimilate by learning language and by learning to participate in the institutions which make up civilization. Two important facts about commonsense are here relevant. The first is that commonsense contains a great deal of what, for want of a better word, may be called "knowledge." Despite the difficulties of semanticists, ordinary men know language in that they can use it; and the use of language (meaning, of course, not merely gossip or polite conversation but also arithmetic, accounting, political discussion, and the talk of the courts, the market, the factory, and the pulpit) involves a large mass of distinctions, information, and other material which may be transmitted by education, which may be exhibited or described in meaningful sentences, and which may be critically judged in various ways as being more or less reasonable, adequate, clear, or correct. Similarly, ordinary men know a good bit about social institutions in that they act in such institu- tions; and, at least in advanced societies,'social action requires, especially on the part of the more prominent members of society, a great deal of knowledge, much of which is explicitly formulated and transmitted by formal or informal education, of the structure of society and an immense amount of information</page><page sequence="4">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 397 about the specific facts relating to a society's actual composition and day-to-day operations. Thus, it is clear that the amount of social knowledge contained in common- sense is not negligible in quantity. Until very recent times such commonsense knowledge of human behavior and the working of social institutions made up the major part of human knowledge. As to its quality there is at least the prag- matic test that it sufficed to mediate the transition in a relatively short time from simple simian life to the complex civilization of modern mass societies. The second relevant fact about commonsense is that commonsense was formed in relation to and for the guidance of practice. Its distinctions and terms reflect the purposes, needs and exigencies of action-not crude physical action, to be sure, but the subtle actions and complex kinds of behavior that were created by language and which proliferated in the social exploitation of lan- guage. Commonsense is anthropocentric and anthropomorphic. It apprehends and portrays the environment as opportunities and obstacles to human action, as relevant to and providing material for various activities of man. Accounting, for instance, that elegant discipline which is rapidly becoming a basic part of commonsense, is so correlated with highly artificial kinds of activity and com- plex institutions that any attempt to translate it into a non-teleological, value- free, naturalistic or scientific version would be fantastic. The teleological, anthropomorphic character of commonsense, though long ago noticed, has been obscured by lack of an effective contrast. In recent years, however, the natural sciences have succeeded to an amazing degree in freeing themselves from teleology and in avoiding the projection into the description of the nature of the peculiarities of the human point of view. Science as a social institution and as practice is, to be sure, rooted in commonsense; but in its explicit theory it uses terms and distinctions which are detached from reference to human desires, needs, or activities. Science uses language, and its use thereof is subject to the criteria of language and to the norms of the artificial behavior of which scientific language is a correlate; but the subjectmatter of the natural sciences does not include language or behavior built on language. Simian chat- ter does seem to have been transformed into an impersonal, objective descrip- tion of nature. Suggestions may indeed be found, in the pragmatists, operationalists, Marxians, and sociologists of knowledge that the popular account of natural science is incorrect or at least in need of some qualification or interpretation. However that may be, the success of natural science, whether real or apparent, furnishes a contrast by which the anthropomorphic and teleological character of commonsense is emphasized. This contrast between science and common- sense, though not the source of the central problems in social science, has cer- tainly influenced the shape such problems have taken in recent years. Social science has its foundations and most of its substance in commonsense; but commonsense, though it has been useful, is not regarded as science. The impressive accomplishments of the physical sciences suggested to many</page><page sequence="5">398 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW brilliant minds that a like application of scientific method to the study of man would furnish a new and solid basis for the construction of a rational society and rational institutions, including political institutions. Such an attempt has been under way for two hundred years or more. The subtitle of Hume's Treatise, in 1739, proclaimed that work to be "an attempt to introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects." It is more than a hundred years since Comte asserted that the customary bases of Euopean civilization were fast crumbling and that civilization would soon fall unless new and firm founda- tions were provided by a science of society. Social knowledge has indeed been greatly extended and improved in the last two hundred years; but so far as I know there have been no important contribu- tions in the field resulting from the application of scientific method. The zeal for science has probably been quite important as a motivating force but as a guide to investigation it has been almost, if not completely, sterile. Economics, which has had the most impressive development of any of the social sciences and has come nearest to the construction of a substantial struc- ture of theory, has certainly developed along lines quite different from those projected by the proponents of scientific method. Such, of course, is the ground of the criticism directed at classical economic theory by Veblen and other Insti- tutionalists. "It may be taken as the consensus of those men who are doing the serious work of modern anthropology, ethnology, and psychology, as well as of those in the biological sciences proper, that economics is helplessly behind the times, and unable to handle its subject-matter in a way to entitle it to standing as a modern science.... In the general body of knowledge in modern times the facts are apprehended in terms of causal sequence. This is especially true of that knowledge of brute facts which is shaped by the exigencies of the modern mechanical industry. To men thoroughly imbued with this matter- of-fact habit of mind the laws and theorems of economics, and of the other sciences that treat of the normal course of things, have a character of 'unreality' and futility that bars out any serious interest in their discussion. The laws and theorems are 'unreal' to them because they are not to be apprehended in the terms which these men make use of in handling the facts with which they are perforce habitually occupied."3 As Veblen's remarks suggest, the desired transformation of the study of man into a science involves much more than the superficial application of scientific method to a given subjectmatter. It involves a transformation of the subjectmatter, a substitution of one point of view and set of terms for another. To put the matter briefly, for the commonsense universe of discourse (what Veblen calls the archaic, teleological point of view), there must be substituted a system of terms, concepts or categories which abstract from human purposes, needs, and ideals, in Veblen's terms, concepts which disclose a "colorless im- personal sequence of cause and effect." Veblen is perhaps no longer regarded as a great man; but he was a perceptive I T. Veblen, "Why Is Economics not an Evolutionary Science?", The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 12, pp. 373, 396 (July, 1898).</page><page sequence="6">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 399 mind and sensitive to the currents of thought of his day. His criticisms of eco- nomic theory would apply with equal or greater force to political science. His dissatisfaction with economics and his fumbling attempts to delineate an 'evolutionary science'' reflect a problem which has disturbed the social sciences for generations and is still unresolved. As he says, "The intellectual attitude and the method of correlation enforced upon us in the apprehension and assimi- lation of facts in the more elementary ranges of knowledge that have to do with brute facts assert themselves also when the attention is directed to those phenomena of the life process with which economics has to do; and the range of facts which are habitually handled by other methods than that in traditional vogue in economics has now become so large and so insistently present at every turn that we are left restless, if the new body of facts cannot be handled accord- ing to the method of mental procedure which is in this way becoming habitual." That Veblen was correct in his insight that there is a radical discrepancy be- tween the terms and distinctions functioning in natural science and those func- tioning in economics (and, we may add, in the other social sciences) can hardly be doubted. There is little reason for doubting, either, that existing social lore is something less than adequate for dealing with present problems and that improvement is badly needed. Veblen, nevertheless, was quite unable to con- struct a substitute for economic theory. The classical theory, despite its limita- tions, is useful and in some sense true. The teleological, normative, or even moralistic terms in which economics and political theory are stated seem, however, to the modern mind to belong to a subjective or fictitious universe of discourse quite inappropriate to a gen- uine science of society. There is wide acceptance of Veblen's ideal of apprehend- ing human behavior in non-teleological terms, in terms of "colorless impersonal sequence of cause and effect. " We do not, however, as a matter of fact have any such apprehension. We know the terms used in physics and chemistry as applied to natural phenomena but when applied to social phenomena such terms furnish only feeble and opaque analogies. There have been many attempts, notable among them in recent years the efforts of the behaviorists, to describe behavior in terms appropriate to natural science; but such attempts have been abortive because the distinctions and preconceptions of commonsense have quickly reimposed themselves even when mutilated by a strained terminology. There is a deep gulf between the actual social sciences and the ideals or canons through which a real social science is prescribed. The outstanding fact, then, in the present situation is that political science, along with the other social sciences, is suffering from a bad case of schizophrenia. As a body of theory and facts political science is developed and stated in com- monsense terms, in the "archaic" system of teleological concepts. Aristotle, if brought back to earth and given a good corps of research assistants, could begin immediately grinding out research monographs, treatises and textbooks. On the other hand, to many people who have become habituated to science, the propositions of political theory "have a character of 'unreality' and futility that bars out any serious interest in their discussion."</page><page sequence="7">400 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW This dilemma or neurosis has an influence that spreads far beyond the people who explicitly discuss method. It inhibits the systematic exploitation of the commonsense conceptual scheme, it leads to extensive and sometimes fantastic exploration of possible new approaches, and, perhaps, most important, it produces considerable confusion in the selection, utilization, and organization of the vast amount of information that is now available. It has had a part in the unfortunate divorce of the social sciences and the humanities; and it has com- pounded confusion in the confused ideal of a value-free social science. Though the dilemma of social science is not easily resolved, certain considera- tions are clear. First and foremost, the universe of discourse of language and commonsense, however subjective and fictitious its teleological categories may seem, is certainly real, since it is the counterpart of society and civilization,- which are certainly actual. Any projected study of society which disregards the intricate ways in which behavior is structured by linguistic functions will surely be vain and empty. The way to social science must be through and not around the teleological categories of commonsense. Second, it is absurd to think that there is no knowledge except that which runs in terms of the concepts of natural science, in non-teleological categories, in terms of "colorless impersonal sequence of cause and effect." That there is a considerable body of other knowledge is attested by the existence of modern civilization, the development and continued operation of which surely depend on the effective utilization of large amounts of knowledge constructed in other terms. Moreover, knowledge about science, of scientific method, and of logic is not stated and cannot be stated in the concepts which are used in explicit scien- tific theory. Consequently, social knowledge does not lie unborn, awaiting the midwifery of a new conceptual system. It may be too weak for its present tasks and badly in need of therapeutic treatment'; but it has been doing a man's work in the world for a long time. My own belief is that it is suffering from a typical modern malaise, a psychic disorder resulting from the strain, frustration, and insecurity of contemporary civilization, and that the indicated therapy is not an operation but rather expert psychiatric ministrations. However that may be, it is obvious that the services of an obstetrician are not needed. Further considerations depend on some elucidation of method and on refer- ence to some of the most obvious ways in which social behavior is structured by the operation of language. Method, in general, consists in clear posing of problems, the selection of data relevant to the problems posed, and the organi- zation of the data to constitute significant and warranted solutions. Possible problems are usually classified into three main types and mixtures of these. One may ask what happened or what is the case; one may attempt to estab- lish what is always or generally true of events or objects of a certain kind; or one may consider what is a prudent or reasonable line of action. Thus, Hume asserts that "after the dissolution of the commonwealth, the Roman yoke became easier upon the provinces, as Tacitus informs us; and it may be ob- served that many of the worst emperors, Domitian, for instance, were careful to prevent all oppression of the provinces." He then goes on to say: "The prov- inces of absolute monarchies are always better treated than those of a free</page><page sequence="8">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 401 state." And somewhat later he remarks that "Here, then, is a sufficient in- ducement' to maintain with the utmost zeal in every free state those forms and institutions by which liberty is secured, the public good consulted, and the avarice or ambition of particular men restrained and punished."4 The three broad lines of inquiry indicated by the questions and illustrated by Hume's statements may be identified as history, science, and ethics, each of these terms being used in a very wide sense. Political science at the present time is, of course, mostly history and ethics (including under history a great mass of information about the current organization, constitutions, laws, per- sonnel, and actions of governments and other public or semi-public organiza- tions), and, to a considerable extent, a mixture of the two. It is no deprecia- tion, however, of this entirely proper state of affairs to suspect that inquiry directed to generalizations is in some sense crucial, not merely because some modicum of this component seems required to justify the "science" in "polit- ical science," but, more importantly, because some generalized theoretical structure seems needed to furnish terms and articulation to history and to provide rationale and cogency to formulations of policy. We do not nowadays share Hume's confidence that generalizations may rather easily be established; and so far as I know the general proposition quoted has not been carried forward into contemporary political science. In- deed, enough is known now about science and scientific method to warrant the assertion that no important generalization has been or will be established in any science by crude correlation of unanalyzed phenomena. General state- ments as to what is always or usually true about kinds or types of objects or events depend upon the establishment or isolation of kinds or types. Further- more, the specification of a subject matter about which generalizations can be fruitfully made seems to involve a system of interrelated distinctions. Pareto stated very well the general form of a social science, though he failed miserably in his attempt to bring social phenomena under the scheme he projected. The proper procedure for making scientific generalizations, according to -Pareto, is to abstract from concrete reality a system of events which can be described by equations. The equations contain factors or variables, and "ties" or types of change or variation appropriate to the system, and should state conditions of equilibrium for the system. The term "equation" may, perhaps, be construed loosely; and the ideal of stating conditions of equilibrium might be relaxed to the requirement that the kind or direction of change introduced into the system by change in one of the variables or factors must be determi- nable. We may grant also Pareto's contention that such a generalized descriptive system may be very useful in picking out factors relevant to a specified kind of change and in seeing how such factors interact even though it is not pos- sible to give exact or numerical values to the variables.' 4All three sentences are from the essay, "That Politics may be reduced to. a Science," Essays, Moral and Political, Part IT Essay III. 5 Vilfredo Pareto, The Mind and Society [Trattato di sociologia generate] (New York, 1935). An excellent brief account of Pareto's methodology is given by Lawrence J. Henderson, Pareto's General Sociology (Cambridge, 1935).</page><page sequence="9">402 THIE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW If we accept Pareto's schematism as having some heuristic value, and turn to the phenomena of political science, we must at the very beginning take account of the fact that most of the objects and processes pertaining to govern- ment are artifacts or artificial objects. As Merriam has emphasized, the organs, devices, and techniques of government are not fixed or frozen but are in a proc- ess of change and development, occasioned by new needs, new problems, and new instruments and limited only by human ingenuity and imagination.6 There can be, strictly speaking, no science about artificial objects though vari- ous sciences may be relevant to the arts by which they are constructed and operated. The scientific generalizations of political science must refer to proc- esses more fundamental than the concrete organs and operations of actual governments. That an abstract, generalized scheme of action is possible is suggested by the example of economic theory. The means-end and exchange framework ex- ploited by economics seems a necessary condition of any action intelligently directed toward the accomplishment of results; and the analysis of action in terms of the allocation of resources among alternative means for attaining ends is of wide applicability. It is true that such analysis must be supplemented by various assumptions regarding the conditions of action and even by consider- able factual or historical material before it has much content; but it neverthe- less furnishes a powerful guide for the selection of factors relevant to the or- ganization of behavior through markets and for the determination of the kind and direction of change occasioned by changes in the relevant factors. Economic analysis has, however, only a limited application to political processes. When one turns to a consideration of the functioning of language in social behavior, one notices, first, that language has been used to construct patterns of cooperation and social action. These patterns of cooperation are analogous to games and dramas in that they prescribe roles or differentiated types of actions for the participants and also provide the rules of the game and the plot whereby the various roles are integrated. At a very simple and low level social patterns involve, perhaps, merely the coordination of behavior which might occur separately. Above-this simple level, however, the social roles or types of action and the pattern of the action are constructed on the basis of language and significant symbols. Courts, for instance, with their apparatus of judges, clerks, lawyers, bailiffs, and litigants, seem to perform actions and to provide diverse social roles which are created by, and are specifiable only in terms of, a structure of significant symbols. The courts, one may presume, administer justice; and the administration of justice is not a simian activity merely more efficiently performed through division of labor mediated by language. Language not only orients men to each other but also orients behavior to the environment. By means of words and other symbols, such as maps and calendars, men are able to refer to and locate objects and events absent in space I Charles E. Merriam, Systematic Politics (Chicago, 1945), pp. v, ix, 325 and passim.</page><page sequence="10">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 403 or time, and to attach appropriate information to such objects and events. This means that the behavior of advanced societies is formally, and to some extent effectively, oriented, to events in space extending at least over the sur- face of the earth and events spread an indefinite distance in the past and future. Language also enables men to apprehend and to put into communicable form interpretations and generalizations directed to important similarities and relationships lying beneath the superficial appearances of facts. Current ac- counts of the environment and of the problems and opportunities which it presents are in process of constant change; and they, of course, interact with social behavior. The control and exploitation of the environment, mediated by social institutions as well as by technology, tools, and inventions, seem a cumulative process, each new technical advance occasioning a series of un- planned social changes, creating new problems, and requiring additional in- ventions, techniques, regulations, and social adaptations. Language, also, to abbreviate what might be a long story, orients men to what, for want of a better term, may be called "values." The patterns of social cooperation and the various types of action which occur in society are not mechanical combinations or aggregations of fixed elements. They are, rather, shifting combinations of changing components given unity by organizing prin- ciples and given stability and persistence by conventions, customs and disci- plines which are shaped by the accidents of social history but are oriented to the organizing principles. Such organizing principles are not objects of desire or concrete objectives but norms or criteria of success or failure. Social behavior is not a colorless sequence of cause and effect; it has a sense of direction and a series of polarities-good-bad, right-wrong, true-false, appropriate-inappro- priate, correct-incorrect, rational-irrational, and many others. In technology the norm of efficiency is conspicuous; and economic activity is characterized by the norm of economy or economic rationality. Courts are directed, one might say, though certainly this does not tell the whole story, to the administration of justice. Norms may be talked about at a high level of abstraction; but in actual social behavior they are usually mixed with more concrete material and com- bined into groups or constellations. Norms in this form, such as liberty, equal- ity, democracy, justice, science, progress, power, education, furnish the major themes of human history and make possible the dramatic oppositions, the sus- pense, and the sense of movement toward a climax and a resolution which are so characteristic of, and apparently essential to, human history. Even this birdseye view of linguistically conditioned behavior suggests the main factors or conditions in the problem of finding isolable systems of change and determining the general ideas or conceptual schemes in terms of which they are described. The description of what is happening in some specified society or group is radically limited by the fact that the institutions and actions of any society are conditioned by what has happened or is happening in other groups and by the even more important fact that, under modern conditions, what is hap-</page><page sequence="11">404 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW pening elsewhere may, through communication, enter directly into the calcu- lations and socially effective processes of the specified society. Nevertheless, we do'describe what is going on in New York, or Russia, or Middletown, even though such social groups or regions hardly constitute isolable systems in any scientific sense. The important fact, however, is that the specification of a limited group or society or area of social changes does not provide the terms or general ideas in which the description is constructed. It indicates what we are going to describe but not how or in what terms we construct the description. Though the processes of civilization interact factually and also have a tend- ency to fusion or integration by reason of the fact that one process is related to others in discussion and speculation, one may, within narrow limits describe or even analyze systematically selected segments. Thus, one may take tech- nology as given, and attempt to see how technology has influenced various social institutions; or one may take certain social institutions for granted and attempt to see how they have conditioned or guided (or misguided) technology. Such descriptions, though useful, are severely limited and do not give us iso- lable systems; but this is not the important fact about them. What is important is that no such partial description gives us the terms which are necessary for describing even the limited segment of social behavior to which the partial description is directed. Technology and institutions must each be described in terms which include reference to both. The various functions of 'language are all necessary components in any in- stance of social behavior. They are, so to speak, the framework in which action occurs and through which it must be described. Any behavior involves knowl- edge of the environment, a conventional or institutional component through which the behavior is patterned, norms or systems of norms through which the behavior is guided, and an agent (whether an individual or a group) with capac- ities for action (needs, abilities, resources).' These components or dimensions of behavior are interdependent, they are definable only in terms of each other, they are known concretely only through acquaintance with or participation in social behavior in which they function, and they furnish the conceptual schema in which behavior must be described. It would follow, of course, that the indicated schematism of action would furnish the fundamental principles through which specific problems are formu- lated, in terms of which data are selected as relevant, and against the back- ground of which empirical generalizations would be interpreted and evaluated. It may be that within this general framework certain lines of inquiry appro- priate to special social sciences can be discriminated, as the example of eco- nomics suggests.-Though the separation of economics from the other social sciences is easily overestimated and is largely illusory, nevertheless other dis- 7No exact or complete analysis of the components of action is here intended; for de- tailed presentation of a view having important similarities to the one suggested see Talcott Parsons, The Structure of Social Action (New York, 1937), especially Ch. 19; for another view, similar in a quite different way, see John R. Commons, Institutional Eco- nomics (New York, 1934).</page><page sequence="12">THE SEMANTICS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 405 ciplines might be differentiated in a similar way, that is, by taking certain aspects of components of action as given, as facts, and concentrating on changes or the manner of change in those aspects selected for attention. Talcott Par- sons in the work cited, argues that sociology, political science, and psychology (in so far as it is a social science) may, as well as economics, be differentiated. I am inclined to believe, however, that political science is, in some sense, an architectonic science, or, at least, an eclectic discipline having something of the same relation to the social sciences as medicine has to the biological sciences.8 The differentiation of political science from social science in general is not im- portant in regard to the issues here examined, since the discussion both applies to all the social sciences and also suggests that any distinctions made would not cut very deep. Though the preceding discussion has indicated the general terms or con- ceptual system utilized in the social sciences, namely the components or dimensions of action which are related to, and indeed equivalent with, the func- tions of language, a basic problem remains. The schema of action seems sub- jective, the way action appears to an agent, and perhaps also to an observer, but appearance nevertheless. Behavior, however, is not merely appearance. It occurs in or upon or in some relation to the real world; it makes use of physical instrumentalities; and it involves a physical component. What, then, is the re- lation of appearance to reality? How do the terms of social science have objec- tive reference? It would seem that the answer to such questions must be given by reference to norms or normative principles. Though norms cannot be defined except in relation to the other dimensions of action, or exhibited except in the behavior which they organize, they seem to be the central factor in the schema of action and the aspect of behavior by which it is at once distinguished from and re- lated to physical change. Consider, for instance, the simple case of a two- dimensional map of North America made, say, in 1713. The map is a physical object and considered as such it has some slight resemblance to the area mapped. If, however, we consider the map and the making of it as items of social behavior, the points we consider are the accuracy and scope of the maker's knowledge of the area mapped, his more or less appropriate selection of means for representing a large curved surface on a small plane surface, and his more or less correct utilization of such means for presenting the knowledge he had in relation to the purposes for which the map might be used. If we ask, 8 Political science seems to be concerned with whatever social actions, techniques, and institutions are used by a society or civilization to bring order into, or to maintain equilibrium among, the lesser institutions and groups. Though similar disorders and sources of instability occur and recur in societies and more or less standard procedures for dealing with some of these disorders have been developed, the sources of disequilibrium, the kinds of disequilibrium occurring, and the possible means for dealing therewith vary widely as the institutions and historical circumstances of society change. Political sci- entists, like their fellow specialists, the military experts, should be on their guard against assuming that the next war or political crisis will be just like the last one.</page><page sequence="13">406 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW now, what is the relation of the mapmaker's behavior to reality, the answer must be given in terms of the component activities, viewed in terms of, and in relation to, appropriate norms. Our description of the mapmaking is related to reality in the same terms, with the added complexity that our apprehension of the mapmaker's activities may be more or less correct and more or less adequate. In other words, to describe behavior is to relate it to reality in terms of the purposive activity involved; and to relate behavior to reality is to de- scribe its purpose in terms of the component activities as guided by appropriate norms. To say that behavior is apprehended and related to reality in terms of norms is not to assert that norms are the explicit objects of knowledge but to assert, rather, that they are the preconceptions or principles by which factual material is selected as relevant, organized, and interpreted. This, of course, was Veblen's indictment of economics; and it seems that his view is correct (though not his conviction that the case should be different) for economics and for the other social sciences as well. This is the basic fact in the semantics of the social sciences, that is, the manner in which their terms are related to reality. One would like to find some easier, simpler, and more direct way of under- standing political phenomena than is here indicated; and when one attempts to describe the action of a court ruling on a fair rate of return for a public utility and is faced with the intricacies of accounting, money, the enterprise system, and legal rules one is tempted to make a short cut through the tangle of words, intentions, abstractions, assumptions and rationalizations which seem to have such tenuous relations to any tangible facts. Civilization, however, is built on words, uncounted billions of them; and any one who fails to follow words through their proper logic to the purposes and activities they reflect must pay the penalty of being himself entangled in words, beguiled by logodaedaly and in danger of becoming a logomaniac.</page></plain_text>
