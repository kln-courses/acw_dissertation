<plain_text><page sequence="1">894 Reviews rightly pointed out here, 'Michelet considered his life consubstantial with his creation'. It is precisely this which lies behind his notion of history as an integral resurrection of the past. Thus the 'relentless anthropomorphism' is still there, determining, for all the scrupulous use of archives, that the past shall relive in Michelet's guise. Now, as Professor Kaplan also argues, 'Michelet's synthesis of natural and human history is a projection of the androgynous mind which produced it'. This is to refer to Michelet's notion of 'the two sexes of the mind', to his conception of the complete because androgynous human being. It is then in this androgynous source that the poet and reformer in Michelet have their common source. It is to be hoped that it will not be thought unfair to mention one particular lapse. In a footnote, we read that 'Georges Poulet correctly emphasizes the male sexual rhythm which characterizes Michelet's view of history'. But in that case, what has become of the androgynous Michelet? And it would be no good invoking here the support of R. G. Collingwood. With some reason, he is used to support Michelet's insistence on the historian's need to relive the past. But he would have had no time for the sexual rhythms of historians. This blemish apart, Professor Kaplan has written a penetrating and convin- cingly systematic assessment of Michelet. Strong as he is on background, he has also made an important contribution to the intellectual history of the nineteenth century. HAROLD WARDMAN UNIVERSITY OF LANCASTER Romantisme et reverie. By MARCEL RAYMOND. Paris: Jose Corti. 1978. 298 pp. 88 F. Marcel Raymond's latest book consists of seventeen essays on the dream-like states experienced or described by a wide range of major and minor French writers between roughly I820 and I870. With the exception of the last and longest piece, on the composition ofNerval's Aurilia, these are not scholarly essays but 'invitations a la promenade, ou a la lecture, avec de belles citations'. M. Raymond's notion of the reverie and his typology of its manifestations are well known from his critical editions of the Reveries du promeneur solitaire and his important book, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, la reverie et la quete de soi. The two general essays on reverie included in the present volume add nothing to the earlier work but introduce and justify the following pieces on Chateaubriand, Nodier, Gautier, Maurice de Guerin, Baudelaire, Stendhal, Balzac, Sand, Flaubert, Michelet, Amiel, Hugo, and Nerval. Several of the essays are very short, and many are composed of several one-page or two-page fragments with little explicit linkage. It is the sort of book which will annoy some readers; only a man of the stature of Marcel Raymond could get away with publishing it. Yet with a little good will there is much pleasure to be had from this series of brief meditations, each centred on a well-chosen quotation, which taken together constitute a rambling literary history of the reverie in the nineteenth century. Behind many of them stalks not so much the sentimentality of Rousseau as the inquiring mind of De Quincey. A chapter on the Confessions of an Opium-eater would have added more to the interest of the volume than the insubstantial piece on Balzac, for example.
