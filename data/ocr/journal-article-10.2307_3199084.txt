<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE 1974 MEETING Despite an apparently general decline in the availability of institutional travel funds for SAMLA members, the forty-fourth annual meeting of the Association was very well attended. Almost 1,800 persons officially registered for the convention, SAMLA's second in the nation's capital. Attendance was equally good at most group meetings in Washington, and post-convention comments by mail indicate that the programs offered were both interesting and professionally valuable. To the participants in the programs and to the officers of the SAMLA Sections and Circles, the membership owes a special debt of gratitude. Special highlights of the meeting included Morse Peckham's stimulating address at the opening General Session on "A Ph.D. in the Humanities?" and President Bub's pithy luncheon consid- eration of the question, "Why Was Faust Blinded?" As at the 1970 SAMLA convention, the Folger Shakespeare Library served as gracious host to the Renaissance Circle meeting, and a number of foreign embassies in the Washington area held receptions for As- sociation members. An interesting display of literary manuscripts at the Library of Congress and an attractive exhibition of some fifty high-relief copperplate illustrations of Don Quijote by Frank Maturo, sponsored by the University of North Carolina at Ashe- ville, are particularly notable among other special events arranged for the convention. Also notable again this year is the continuing success of the invitational SAMLA Poetry Readings, in Washington featuring readings by Irene McKinney (Potomac State College) and Wendell Berry (Kentucky). Associated meetings held in conjunction with SAMLA this year included six individual programs of the Southeastern Confer- ence on Linguistics, an experimental gathering of the Associated Writing Programs, and the usual meal functions arranged for the AATF, AATG, and the College English Association. The program of the South Atlantic Association of Departments of Foreign Lan- guages was appropriately focused on government and academic interaction and featured as guest participants a number of govern- ment officials in the Washington area, as well as Richard Brod, Staff Coordinator of the national ADFL. The meeting of English department chairmen (SAADE) was particularly timely in its con- sideration of fragmentation or diversification in undergraduate English programs on the one hand and academic tenure under attack on the other, the last being the subject of an address by Bertram H. Davis, immediate past General Secretary of the AAUP. A special afternoon meeting of the AATSP replaced that group's</page><page sequence="2">South Atlantic Bulletin usual breakfast at the convention this year and featured an address on "Involving the Community in Foreign Language" by Zenia Sacks Da Silva, President of the national AATSP. As the SAMLA meeting has grown dramatically in attendance and number of individual meetings scheduled in recent years, so have the areas for potential logistical problems and membership discomforts multiplied. That there were remarkably few difficulties of that kind to be endured in Washington was largely owing to the excellent work of a dedicated Local Committee on Arrange- ments made up of staff volunteers from the host institutions in the area and efficiently directed by the chairman, James F. Burks of George Washington University. On behalf of all who attended the meeting, I want to convey very genuine appreciation to this always cordial and highly effective group. I am particularly happy to extend a cordial welcome to all those who joined the Association in Washington. I hope that you and all members will continue to be actively involved in the meet- ing and other Association affairs. And I trust you will invite col- leagues who do not already belong to join in SAMLA efforts to advance teaching and scholarship in the humanities by forwarding membership dues (regular: $5.00; graduate student: $2.00; joint husband-wife: $7.00) to the SAMLA office and participating in the next annual meeting of the Association, to be held in Atlanta, Georgia, November 6-8, 1975. Section and Discussion Circle officers for that convention are listed elsewhere in this issue of the Bulletin. EDWARD W. BRATrON, Executive Secretary. SECTION MEETINGS AMERICAN DIALECT SOCIETY (South Atlantic Section) Chairman-JOHN ALGEO, University of Georgia. Secretary-DAvID L. SHORES, Old Dominion University. On Defining Standard American English-EDWARD A. STEPHEN- SON, University of Georgia. The claim, made here, that Standard American English exists would have been noncontroversial until recently. Admittedly, Standard English is difficult to define, is constantly changing, and is relative to time, situation, and place. Studies such as those by Leonard (1932), Marckwardt and Walcott (1938), Fries (1940), Hook and Mathews (1956), and Bryant (1962), which have contributed 49</page><page sequence="3">Meeting to the identification of Standard English, assumed the validity of the Doctrine of Usage-herewith defined more explicitly than usual. * * * * Can (and Should) Standard American English Be Defined?- WALTER E. MEYERS, North Carolina State University. Definitions of Standard American English (SAE) offered in handbooks, books on usage, and sociolinguistic studies differ so much in their descriptions of the dialect that one may question its existence. Proponents of defining SAE justify their efforts with several reasons, none of which are very convincing on examination, and many of which show profound misunderstanding of the nature of language and dialects. No benefits and many disadvantages fol- low an arbitrary definition of SAE. Describing a Dialect: The Afro-American Example-RICHARD A. LONG, Atlanta University. Most purported descriptions of dialect have been admittedly fragmentary. The "description" begins with the assumption that a "standard" is known to the parties to the descriptive transaction and the dialect is delineated in terms of one or more deviant fea- tures, lexical, phonological, and occasionally grammatical. This type of description may be called folkloric or picturesque. More serious pretensions to systematic dialect description have been made in reference to Afro-American speech (or Black Ver- nacular English) in recent years. A large but largely conflated bibli- ography of the subject now exists. In fact, however, there is really no systematic description of BVE. The bits and pieces approach is as rampant here as in the older picturesque tradition. However, an important anomaly is now evident: there are really no fully de- scribed dialects (and hence languages) since many dialect (and hence language) elements intuitively recognized are not formally recognized in any linguistic model. A proposed model must reorganize at least four categories: 1) Morpho-phonological, including intonation and voice quality; 2) lexical; 3) syntactic; 4) stylistic, including idiomacity. * * * * Suggestions for Investigating Tennessee English: A Socio- linguistic Approach to Dialect Study-BETHANY K. DUMAS, Uni- versity of Tennessee. The best way to gather sociolinguistic data which will yield sound and relevant pedagogical information for Tennessee is to include in a survey an examination of the language of children, 50</page><page sequence="4">South Atlantic Bulletin partly for immediate pedogogical usefulness, partly so that research- ers can gain insights into the processes of obsolescence and replace- ment in the syntactic, phonological, and possibly also lexical sys- tems of three or four generations of native speakers of Tennessee English. Such an investigation must be based upon a careful exami- nation of existing data. * * * * Social Stratification of /I/ and /al/ among White Speakers in Tuscaloosa, Alabama-L. BEN CRANE, Temple University. This study is a sociolinguistic analysis of /aI/, a selected phonological variable, as produced by white informants in Tusca- loosa, Alabama. A purposive sampling procedure was used to choose 56 informants for interviews. Informants were ranked according to education, income, and occupation to determine social class. Spe- cific environments of /aI/ were chosen for study. Conclusions show that the highest social class and the youngest age group produce the closest pronunciation of /aI/ to broadcast standard. * * * * Southern Standards Revisited-RAvEN I. MCDAvID, JR., Uni- versity of Chicago, and RAYMOND K. O'CAIN, University of South Carolina. Fifteen characteristics of Standard Southern English are con- sidered. The status of each feature is examined diachronically for the Low-Country of South Carolina; each feature was examined at intervals by at least four of six observers working in the period 1888-1969. It is concluded that defining Standard English in gen- eral, and Southern Standard English in particular, was never a simple matter. It is likely to become more complex in the light of profound social changes in the South. * * * * AMERICAN LITERATURE Chairman-JOHN C. BRODERICK, Library of Congress. Secretary-ELAINE M. NEWSOME, Fayetteville State University. Preparation for Justification: A Study of The Day of Doom and Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God-CLAUDIA B. JOHNSON, University of Alabama. The joylessness of Michael Wigglesworth's The Day of Doom and Jonathan Edwards' Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God are better understood in the light of Puritan preparation for justifica- tion. The minister's role in justification was repeatedly described as his duty to "soften" the hearts of his flock so that God could more easily allow them a glimpse into themselves. The most effec- 51</page><page sequence="5">Meeting tive tool available to spiritual leaders was terror. In dwelling in great detail upon the horrors of sin, death, the last judgment, and hell, both Wigglesworth and Edwards were performing the duties expected of them, using high dramatism to lead their listeners and readers on a mock infernal descent in preparation for the profound justifying descent which only God could control. The patterns of each follow the expectations of justification: the loss of faith in the will, the reason, and the goodness of man during an inner journey. * * * * Washington Irving's "American Sketch Book"-RICHARD D. RUST, University of North Carolina. Until now only the titles have been known of Washington Irving's 1825 "American Essays." Newly discovered manuscript fragments compared with Irving's 1825 notebook in Journals and Notebooks, Volume III, and with an unpublished Irving notebook reveal over 14,000 words of notes and extracts intended for prepa- ration of the American Essays. Furthermore, three completed essays from Irving's intended "American Sketch Book" are "To the Editor of the Knickerbocker," "National Nomenclature," and "A Time of Unexampled Prosperity." * * * * Fire and Fire Imagery in Thoreau's Journal and Walden- THEODORE HADDIN, University of Alabama, Birmingham. Examination of Thoreau's Journal account in 1850 of his part in burning the Concord woods in 1844 and comparisons with later passages in Walden reveal Thoreau not as a guilty woods burner but as a literary artist whose management of aesthetic distance concerning fire and fire imagery is evident throughout the years prior to and after he wrote Walden. Thoreau's grief over the fire and his interest in spectacle evoked significant expressions of his art. Homosexuality and Spiritual Aspiration in Moby-Dick-T. WALTER HERBERT, JR., University of Kentucky. Melville depicts homosexual affection in Moby-Dick in accor- dance with the orthodox Calvinist interpretation of its meaning, which held homosexuality to be a sign of man's innate spiritual blindness. Ishmael's initial encounter with Queegueg conveys his defiance of such teaching, as he sets out upon an independent spiritual quest. "A Squeeze of the Hand" revives the motif to pre- sent a moment in which that quest seems futile. 52</page><page sequence="6">South Atlantic Bulletin Charles Chesnutt's The House behind the Cedars: Racism and the Genteel Romance-GEORGE B. BALL, JR., University of North Carolina, Greensboro. In his novel of passing, The House behind the Cedars (1900), Charles Chesnutt skillfully adapts the form of the genteel romance, which accepted the popular doctrine of Anglo-Saxon superiority, to his own antiracist thesis. His addition of a single element, the long undetected fact of the heroine's "legal" blackness, renders an otherwise standard plot action ironic, and exposes the falsity of myths of black inferiority. Chesnutt also attacks interracial color prejudice in his subplot. The Bridge as Dream Allegory-W. MCMAHON, Western Ken- tucky University. A dream framework and dream references are so dominant in The Bridge that it may be seen in the genre of the dream vision, and the "happenings" in the poem gain coherence and even verisi- militude as dream-like projections from a protagonist who, as in classical dream allegories, remains stationary, often close to some sacred dream icon. The dream mode, furthermore, allows Crane a key device for sealing and preserving idealisms not currently operative but protected for cultural recall. Theme and Image in The Great Gatsby-CHRISTINE IURPHY BIRD, Georgia State University. The Great Gatsby is a highly topical work, with many refer- ences to customs of the day, but it is also highly mythical. Jay Gatsby is a fisher king, a ruined and sterile god who dies and takes his civilization with him. Nick Carraway is his worshipper. Fitz- gerald uses wasteland imagery from Frazer's The Golden Bough. His imagery makes use of all the different cycles of natural life. The novel, unlike Fitzgerald's others, is controlled, compact, and satisfying. T. S. Eliot: The Symbol in Theory and in Practice-NANCY D. HARGROVE, Mississippi State University. Despite the importance Eliot gave to the symbol, he never set forth a clearly defined theory of symbolism. However, a compilation of scattered remarks in his prose writings reveals that he did indeed have such a theory outlining the creation, function, and char- acteristics of the symbol. A study of one of his major poetic sym- bols, urban and rural landscape, clearly illustrates the tenets of the theory at work. 53</page><page sequence="7">Meeting Nabokov's Pale Fire and the Four Quartets-RoNALD T. SWIGGER, University of Maryland. Nabokov's parodies of poetry in Pale Fire include calling Eliot's Four Quartets "some phony modern poem." Nabokov dis- likes Eliot; Pale Fire offers disengaged answers to some of the questions Eliot posed. Nabokov's pursuit of "plexed artistry" is a parodistic response to Eliot's dry "the poetry does not matter." Using similar images-reflections, birds, the yew-and referring to some of Eliot's issues-religion, time-Nabokov reaffirms his own valuation of poetry as meaningful game. * * * * Invisible Man: The Re-Creation of a Myth-B. JOYE PETTI- GREW, Winthrop College. Invisible Man blends the archetype of initiation with racial myths so much a part of the Negro's everyday life to re-create the universal experience of modern man in search of his own identity. Ellison "washes" clean of traditional meaning the archetypes of The Sacred Marriage and The Atonement of the Father and re- experiences them as art. This washing accounts for the tension between the affirmation of the framework and the rejection of the initiate's "story." COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Chairman-TED R. SPIVEY, Georgia State University. Secretary-CHARLES MOORMAN, University of Southern Mississippi. The Cataclysm of Darkness: Vonnegut's Mother Night as a Revision of Goethe's Faust-RAINULF A. STELZMANN, University of South Florida. Though Vonnegut openly reveals his source for title and motto of Mother Night in the preface of the novel, it is far from obvious that the book may be read as a twentieth century revision of Goethe's Faust. There are four major points of comparison which elucidate the peculiar relationship of the two works. 1) The pact with evil. While it augments Faust's potential, it painfully dehumanizes Vonnegut's protagonist. 2) The escape into the magic of words. Faust uses it successfully. Campbell realizes its fallacy and futility. 3) Both heroes fall victim to the treachery of evil. 4) While Goethe seems to be incapable of endorsing a negative view of evil, Vonnegut depicts it as the original all-destructive force of our world. So the new Faust has no choice but to kill himself in despair. 54</page><page sequence="8">South Atlantic Bulletin Vision, Revelation, Prophecy: Zola and the Conformations of Apocalypse-PATRICK BRADY, Rice University. Zola's Rougon-Macquart series possesses all the characteristics of apocalypse: it is a vision expressed in symbols, a revelation of mysteries, and a prophecy of the future. Its essentially symbolic character has rarely been recognized, because it is latent rather than manifest; the mysteries revealed concern the projection of Man's darker, instinctual drives upon the world around him through various phantasmagoria; and the prophecy of the future predicts (retrospectively) the catastrophic end of the Second Empire. Apocalyptic: Georg Kaiser's Gas Trilogy-RICHARD ARTHUR FIRDA, Georgia State University. Georg Kaiser's Gas trilogy, a series of German Expressionist plays, shows the survival of apocalyptic thought in contemporary literature. The writer's theme of world destruction is especially related to a Christian concept of timeliness found in the Book of Revelation, while his total vision shows the future in terms related to its end. Kaiser's pessimistic conclusion reflects a deeply unsettled feeling concerning the final outcome of the historical process itself. * * * * Thrusting to a New Germination: The Apocalyptic Endings of The Rainbow and Germinal-WALLACE G. KAY, University of Southern Mississippi. The closing paragraphs of Zola's Germinal and Lawrence's Rainbow have several similarities in imagery, including images of germination, thrusting forth, bursting into life, and others. All of these images suggest that a new order of society is imminent but not yet present. The new orders are envisioned by the protagonist of each novel, following a traumatic experience by each. The con- clusion is that both Zola and Lawrence have written novels with apocalyptic endings following personal cataclysms of the protagon- ists. Resurrection of the Body: Apocalypse in Hermann Hesse and Norman 0. Brown-JOSEPH K. DAVIS, University of Southern Mississippi.

An Aspect of the Religious Art and Literature of the Baroque -GREGOR SEBBA, Emory University. 55</page><page sequence="9">Meeting Literature, the art of the written word, is coeval with the "higher" civilizations and thus with history as contrasted to pre- history, according to a distinction now in need of revision because of new archaeological evidence. Art spans prehistory and history in a sequence of visual, nonverbal products which on principle re- quire no verbal addition. The historical distinction is still funda- mental and fruitful, as the test case of the baroque age shows. Here architecture is the dominant visual art, still fulfilling its symbolic function of expressing societal self-understanding. This architecture presses all other visual arts into its service; but, outside it, easel painting and literature develop into independent "free arts." This is why literature cannot satisfactorily made to fit the "baroque" label. Today, painting and literature are the dominant arts, displacing architecture. As "free arts" they reflect the state of the civilization precisely by their refusal to symbolize societal order. * * * * Reading Gainsborough's Landscapes-RONALD PAULSON, Johns Hopkins University. Gainsborough's landscape paintings of the 1770's and '80's are almost pure form and color. Mythology, even story and represen- tation and so communicable meanings, appear to be minimal. But a study of these paintings showed that they contained a few obses- sive forms and representations which project a meaning, though a personal, even private one, as clearly as any narrative picture. * * # * Diderot, David, and Chenier-MICHAEL FRIED, Harvard Uni- versity. Analysis of Andre Chenier's article "Sur la peinture d'histoire" (1792) strongly suggests, first, that he was familiar with Diderot's as yet unpublished writings on painting and, second, that his use of the concept of naivete, not just in that article but in his Essai sur les causes et les effets de la perfection et de la decadence des lettres et des arts, reflects Diderot's definition of naivete in the Pensees detachees sur la peinture. Comparison of Ch6nier's L'Aveugle and related texts with David's drawings of Homer reciting his verses and Homer asleep (1794) further suggests that the former helped inspire the latter. Finally, it is argued that David's Homer drawings are them- selves to be seen as attempts to realize the Diderotian ideal of naivet6 adumbrated earlier. * * * * Ludic Structures in the French New Novel and Conceptual Art-CHARLES RUSSELL, University of Virginia. 56</page><page sequence="10">South Atlantic Bulletin ENGLISH II Chairman-PATRICIA G. PINKA, Agnes Scott College. Secretary-JOAN HARTWIG, University of Kentucky. Christ on the Pinnacle: Interpretive Illustrations of Milton's Paradise Regained-J. KARL FRANSON, Arkansas State University. Illustrators and critics of Paradise Regained interpret the com- plex pinnacle scene either as a human balancing feat by Christ or as a miracle by his Father. Only William Blake's illustration, which accords with a close reading of the text, suggests a miracle by an independent Christ. By identifying as Milton's theme Christ's unique and independent nature rather than his identity, Blake emerges as a significant source of insight into the poem. (Accepted for publication in the Milton Quarterly.) * * * * Herrick's Georgic Encomia-JAMES S. TILLMAN, Georgia State University. Two of Herrick's encomia of his contemporaries, poems en- titled "A Country Life" (H-106) and "The Country Life" (H-662) and addressed to Thomas Herrick and Endimion Porter, are lyrical appropriations of the georgic ethos. The poems reveal their georgic qualities not only in echoes of Virgil's praise of the happy hus- bandman in the Georgics, but also in Herrick's exhortative ideali- zation of the gentleman addressed as self-restrained, laborious master-husbandmen of their country estates. Porter, especially in contrast with his pastoral role in another of Herrick's encomia (H-492), appears as a georgic figure who accepts a laborious, lowly, and constrained life among his country husbandmen for the sake of his duties to the husbandry of estate and kingdom. Thomas Herrick makes similar sacrifices as Porter, but for more precise philosophical values. In particular, the moral rewards of self- restraint, usually imposed upon the lowly georgic husbandman by necessity, are willingly accepted by Thomas, who appears more as a philosophical "husbandman" than as the traditional naive hus- bandman of the georgic tradition. * * * * "Runnawayes Eyes" and Juliet's Epithalamium-GARY M. McCowN, Guilford College. For Juliet's soliloquy spoken on her wedding night (III, ii) Shakespeare imitates conventions from the classical epithalamium. Epithalamic motifs appear prominently in her invocation to some deity to preside over her nuptials, her exhortations to time and night to accelerate, and her identification of Night as her matron of honor. Out of this rhetoric of invocation and exhortation an 57</page><page sequence="11">Meeting hymeneal refrain emerges. Investigation of Renaissance icono- graphic tradition about Cupid identifies the "runaway" of line 6 as "Love the Runaway" from Moschus' popular poem. Juliet's inversion of nuptial imagery (the marriage torch, Cupid's bright eyes, Hesperus, the matron of honor) adumbrates, however, an ironic and tragic conclusion for her epithalamium. Dreams Mount Heavenward: Milton's Upland Paradise in Mesopotamia-GEORGE YOST, Florida State University. The stream of Milton's Paradise is the Tigris. Paradise itself, foreshadowed in Adam's dream, is the Hanging Garden, fore- shadowed in Nebuchadnezzar's dream. The Eastern Gate is the Tower of Babel, foreshadowed in Nebuchadnezzar's other dream. Jacob's dream of the stairway into heaven, actualized, caps the upward thrust of structures and dreams. All features are in Meso- potamia, as Milton says, and man's dreams reveal the creations of God as things of earth resemble those of heaven. * * * * The Disarming of the Knight: Comic Parody in Lyly's Endym- ion-SARA DEATS, University of South Florida. Despite the recent critical interest in the comic sub-plot, a characteristic feature of Elizabethan and Jacobean drania, the Sir Tophas episode in Lyly's Endymion has received surprisingly scant scholarly attention. Examination of Lyly's comedy has focused almost exclusively on the allegorical levels of the play, both his- torical and philosophical. This essay seeks to demonstrate that the comic sub-plot is more than a device for gay pranks and "fun by contrast." It is instead an integral and significant element of the drama. Sir Tophas functions as a carefully delineated burlesque of the romantic posturings of Endymion, and to a much lesser degree, Eumenides. This pervasive comic parody conjoins with other elements of the main plot, particularly the Corsites-Tellus interlude, to underscore both the destructive aspects and the comic potentialities of unrequited love. Thus, Tophas's farcical travesty of the Courtly lover punctures the romantic pretensions of the main plot, suggesting a dramatic ambiguity, a tension, and an equipoise, without which Endymion would be a much poorer and thinner play. "Regeneration" in a Welsh Grove-KAREN H. HORTON, Uni- versity of North Carolina, Charlotte. Henry Vaughan's poem "Regeneration" is tinged with Celtic color that both belies the poet's Welsh background and continues a Celtic-mythological tradition of viewing groves as supernatural 58</page><page sequence="12">South Atlantic Bulletin sources of poetic inspiration, a view that also graces the verse of the medieval Welsh bard, Dafydd ap Gwilym. At the least, it ap- pears that in "Regeneration" Vaughan uses Celtic mythology and a Welsh poetic tradition to describe a religious experience; it is also quite probable that Welsh groves, mentioned in sexeral Silex Scintillans verses, created in Vaughan a personal struggle between a type of inherited Celtic animism and traditional Christian doc- trine. ENGLISH III Chairman-JOHN M. ADEN, Vanderbilt University. Secretary-PAUL F. BETZ, Georgetown University. Persona and the Personal Animus in the Satires of Swift DONALD T. SIEBERT, JR., University of South Carolina. Criticism stressing the persona as a key to Swift's satires has blind spots. Using the term, we tend to elevate Swift to a pedestal of selfless moral vision and rigorous formalism, thus detaching him from those passions and energies which inform his art and quicken our responses to it. It is important to realize that Swift does not cloak his identity when he tries out a persona. Somewhat as in a masquerade, disguise does not function to isolate or absolve the masker from responsibility as a moral agent, or to purify his in- tentions; rather, it gives him more range. * * * * "The Grease of God": The Form of Eighteenth-Century Fic- tion-MELVYN NEW, University of Florida. The proper conceptual context for an understanding of the form and meaning of eighteenth-century fiction is neither solely the providential world order mirrored in romance nor solely the secular world order mirrored in the novel, but a unique structure, imaging forth a world of intellectual and imaginative transition between these two world views. The eighteenth-century writers shaped a world in which the claims of romance were carefully dis- placed from the center of narrative. * * * * "High Argument": The Prelude in Mid-Stream-STEPHEN GILL, Cornell University. My title refers to the magnitude of Wordsworth's claims for his poetry, as expressed in the "Prospectus" to The Recluse and to his definition of his task in The Prelude as tracing the stream of the imagination from the place of its birth. I am interested in that tracing process at its mid-point. 59</page><page sequence="13">Meeting Between January and early March, 1804, Wordsworth was try- ing to complete The Prelude in five books and seems to have come very near to doing so, and yet around March 10, despite his desire to complete the work before Coleridge left for Malta, Wordsworth decided to reorganize the poem completely and embarked on the structure that finally became the 1805 Prelude in thirteen books. What would the five book poem have looked like? What pressures were operating on the poet as he attempted to shape his material? The answers to the first question are looked for in the manuscript evidence surviving from the period. Some answers to the second are looked for in the themes of the poem itself as they relate to Wordsworth's other writing of the period, notably the Ode: Inti- mations of Immortality and the recently identified further work on The Pedlar. * * * * Coleridge on Shakespeare: The Ipsissima Verba?-JoHN F. ANDREWS, Folger Shakespeare Library. John Payne Collier's diary (Folger MS. M.a. 219-28) contains the best extant transcript of Coleridge's 1811-12 lectures on Shake- speare, and R. A. Foakes is to be commended for basing his 1971 edition of Coleridge on Shakespeare on the diary rather than on Collier's unreliable 1856 edition of the lectures. Even so, however, Collier's transcript revisions raise questions that Foakes has not faced, and we are therefore still awaiting a definitive edition of the 1811-12 lectures. ENGLISH IV Chairman-GEORGE CORE, University of the South. Secretary-FRED L. STANDLEY, Florida State University. Two Irish Biographies: Quinn and Casement-B. L. REID, Mount Holyoke College. Critics make an error of principle when they demand of biog- raphy the same things they ask of a novel: neatness of shape, order- ing by theme, dramatic modulation, vividness of sensation. Biogra- phy by nature is less a fine art than a useful art, a branch of history rather than literature. Its duty is to order fact within the discipline of time, to show a life finding its own shapes within the quotidian. Biography becomes fine art when it realizes its own nature superbly. * * * * Autobiography: A Secession from Literary States of the Self- Louis A. RENZA, Dartmouth College. 60</page><page sequence="14">South Atlantic Bulletin Autobiography is an anomalous genre. It engages a set of prob- lems totally different from biography or first-person fiction. First, the autobiographer cannot entrust his life to narrative without a sense of alienation from both. Second, because of the latter, auto- biographical narratives tend to be de facto fragmentary. Finally, unlike the biographer and writer of fiction, the autobiographer cannot assume an implicit interlocutor as he writes. Hardy as Narrator: The Fragmentation of Consciousness in Jude the Obscure-HAROLD L. WEATHERBY, Vanderbilt University. Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure presents a problem of definition which stems in turn from ambiguity in the narrator's attitude toward the story. Critics have acknowledged the difficulty, but none has resolved it. A fresh approach is to admit the difficulty and seek its source in Hardy's artistic intentions-in his attempt to write a new kind of fiction in which the impressions of the author take precedence over traditional considerations of plot and character. The Strange Irregular Rhythm of Life: James's Late Tales and Constance Woolson-RAYBURN S. MOORE, University of Georgia. "The Beast in the Jungle," "The Jolly Corner," and "The Bench of Desolation" demonstrate in various ways that there is life behind James's art, particularly in regard to his friendship with Constance Woolson and his abiding reaction to her death in 1894. Each tale centers on a relationship that is rooted in James's experience with Miss Woolson. Moreover, some of James's corre- spondence reflects a continuing interest in C. F. W., as he some- times alludes to her, and his notebooks project imaginative treat- ments of the friendship. FOLKLORE Chairman-JOHN A. BURRISON, Georgia State University. Secretary-RALPH W. HYDE, Middle Tennessee State University. The "Defolking" of Rural America: Josh Billings' Farmer's Allminax-DAVID B. KESTERSON, North Texas State University. Partly for fun but also to bring enlightenment to his rural audience, Josh Billings satirized both the farmer's almanac tradition and the folk tastes and superstitions behind its popularity. Being an astute businessman, however, Billings knew his work must not offend or it would fail to sell. Thus he satirized gently. Ironically, then, the Yankee shrewdness in him-a trait he ridiculed as an almanac mainstay-overpowered him in his role as satirist. 61</page><page sequence="15">Meeting The Content of Afro-American Folktales-BEssIE W. JONES, Alabama A. and M. University. The Afro-American folktale has drawn its material from a multi-racial heritage, but it derives its meaning and significance from the Afro-American culture and tradition in America. The core of the Afro-American experience in America has been a radical search for identity, and it is through his tale that the Afro-American approximates that identity. In form and spirit as well as in content, the folktale has proved peculiarly adaptable to his basic needs and through it he has projected the best and worst of his experiences. Elements of Verbal Folklore in Scott's Fiction-GEORGE VW. BOSWELL, University of Mississippi. Scott's mind was an enormous lumber-room filled with plunder that he had amassed from reading and personal contact. The materials naturally group themselves under eight headings: oracle, early traditional literature, ballads, songs, and rimes, proverbs and Wellerisms, popular etymology, games, and dialect and supersti- tion. For the best speech, go to Andrew Fairservice, Meg Merrilies, Edie Ochiltree, Hobbie Elliott, and Cuddie Headrigg. Drawn from his capacious memory, these materials entertain the reader and convincingly illustrate the historical settings. (Accepted for publi- cation in the Tennessee Folklore Society Bulletin.) A Comparative Study of Folktale Structure and Musical Form -J. RUSSELL REAVER, Florida State University. Oral storytelling can be appreciated as another evidence of constructive ability in human imagination when narrative struc- tures are compared with musical forms. Designs common to West- ern music and to world narrative are one-part form, binary form, ternary form, sonata form, and cyclic form. Propp's functional symbols can be adapted to show the storytelling imagination struc- turing folktales from the simplest to the most complex forms analogous to the typical structuring methods familiar in Western music. * * * * Riddles in Thigpen's Store News-ANDREW BADGER, Delta State University Thigpen's Store News, in existence since 1924, has been cater- ing to a rural people whose interests and traditions are not literary. While the purpose of the News is to promote Thigpen's Hardware Store of Picayune, Mississippi, and to meet the needs of its readers as manifested in the classified ads to which its pages are devoted, the News also provides a source of entertainment which reflects the 62</page><page sequence="16">South Atlantic Bulletin folklore of its audience. The News uses sayings, jokes, riddles, and various types of verse as fillers. This paper focuses on the riddles, comparing examples of the various types with variations found locally and in other sources, and attempting to establish that these riddles from the printed page are really a part of the oral tradition in south Mississippi. * * * * FRENCH I Chairman-RAYMOND C. LA CHARITE, University of Kentucky. Secretary-JosEPH L. ALLAIRE, Florida State University. Perceval's "Welshness": Paradox as Structure in the Conte del Graal-RUPERT T. PICKENS, University of Kentucky. Paradox is central in Chretien's romance constructions. In the earlier romances it appears to be so deeply submerged, however, that only its ironic facets seem significant. In the Conte del Graal, on the other hand, paradoxicality is so pervasive that, in exploring the limits of his poetics, in which paradox is essential, Chr&amp;tien explodes the romance form. In this paper are examined the impli- cations in the Conte del Graal of an important thematic aspect of a particular paradox called the felix culpa. The themes involved are Arthurian courtliness and its antithesis, Welshness, a quality associated with the Gaste Forest. The Grieving Maiden, whom Perceval encounters after his failure at the Grail Castle, suggests a new perspective for regarding the young knight's progress. His ascent in the world of Arthurian courtliness is simultaneous with a fall from the Gaste Forest and Welshness. His abandonment of his Welshness, associated with the Gaste Forest and his mother, is a "fault," but a necessary and fortunate one, for otherwise he cannot realize his destiny as a hero and a man. Yet to succeed at the Grail Castle, he must regain the state of Welshness from which it is necessary to fall, yet while retaining his experience of the fall. * # * * A Morphological Analysis of the Fabliau-MARY JANE SCHENCK, St. Andrews Presbyterian College. The definition of the term fabliau and the problem of whether these stories constitute a distinct sub-genre of the tale remain open questions in spite of the renewed scholarly interest in these tales. A new structural approach to the genre will demonstrate that by analyzing the action in the narratives, it is possible to see that the majority of the fabliaux do have a common underlying structure. When the diverse events recounted in these tales are analyzed in terms of the function they play in the plot as a whole it is possible to see that the narratives are built around only ten basic actions 63</page><page sequence="17">Meeting or functions. These ten functions constitute a structural definition of the fabliau, and the analysis by functions can serve as a model for defining other medieval genres. Satire in Villon's Testament-DOUGLAS R. BUTTURFF, Queens College, City University of New York. * * * * De Pantagruel au Tiers Livre: Panurge et le pouvoir-GERARI) DEFAUX, Bryn Mawr College. Sensible a l'ecart temporel apparent, la critique rabelaisienne distingue generalement, de Pantagruel au Tiers Livre, l'existence d'une rupture. Cette etude s'efforce au rebours, a travers le person- nage de Panurge, de souligner d'un livre a l'autre la continuite narrative et le coherence du processus createur. Elle propose de voir dans la "prosopopee" panurgienne le fruit d'une meditation de Rabelais sur le pouvoir. Le seul vrai pouvoir n'est pas celui que l'homme acquiert sur autrui, mais sur ses propres passions. Chatelain de Salmiguondin, mais esclave de ses desirs, roi dechu devenu bouffon de cour, Panurge apparait dans le Tiers Livre comme l'antithese incarnee de la sagesse socratique et de la charite paulinienne: sophiste, et silene renverse.

Sentences and the Alexandrin: Clue to Characterization in Racine-MARY LYNNE FLOWERS, University of Kentucky. One important feature of Racine's sentence structure is sen- tence type which measures the extent to which the physical limits of a sentence coincide with those of the alexandrin. This paper examines sentence types, especially the irregular ones, for new clues to characterization in Andromaque, Britannicus, Berenice and Phedre. Differences in sentence type, traceable to a wide range of factors, provide insights into specific characters as well as greater understanding of basic conflicts in the tragedies. Order and Orders in the Pensees of Pascal-HrGH M. DAVID- SON, University of Virginia. Pascal uses the word ordre in three senses. An examination of the first of these, ordre as sequence or arrangement, leads to some understanding of the logical and rhetorical stages of the apologetic argument with which many of the Pensees are concerned. An exami- nation of the second sense, ordre as category or domain, leads to 64</page><page sequence="18">South Atlantic Bulletin some conclusions regarding the nature of Pascal's distinctions and his method of problem-solving. The third sense of ordre-as com- mand-is easily related to the other two. Voltaire, Shakespeare, and Thomas Rymer-ROBERT J. O'BRIEN, West Virginia Wesleyan College. Voltaire manifests a high regard for Thomas Rymer, a critic notorious in recent times. The lingering dispute between pro- Othello and anti-Othello interpretations of Zaire can be settled through an examination of Rymer's critique of Othello. Elements of Zaire which cannot be explained with alternative hypotheses can be explained on the principle that Zaire is a revision of Othello designed to meet the complaints of Rymer. * * * * Romance and Novel: The Question of Narrative Modes- PHILIP STEWART, Duke University. The conventional distinction made in English criticism be- tween "romance" and "novel" needs to be reexamined in the light of its failure to achieve recognition in other critical traditions. French nomenclature, for example, cannot adequately translate this opposition; the explanation seems to lie in the greater sense of continuity in the history of French fiction. A distinction like romance/novel, cast in terms of English fiction, may be weaker theoretically than we have generally supposed. * * * * FRENCH III Chairman-ALBERT B. SMITH, University of Florida. Secretary-VIRGINIA LA CHARITE, University of Kentucky. Literary Criticism through Parody: The French Theatre from the Revolution to the Restoration-MARIO HAMLET-METZ, Madison College. Between 1789 and 1820 parodies of the French tragedies still written following the classical mould became extremely popular among theatre-goers of the Parisian Theatres de Boulevard. These parodies, by no means literary masterpieces themselves, often proved useful tools of literary criticism, as their authors, while keeping the audiences laughing, pointed out in no uncertain terms the many defects of the new tragedies as well as the urgent need for modernizing this decadent but important genre. * * * * Diirer in French Romanticism--JAMES S. PATTY, Vanderbilt University. 65</page><page sequence="19">Meeting The work of Albrecht Diirer inspired in French Romanticists many literary expressions of sympathy, even of identification, with the artist and his work, notably by Hugo, Gautier, Nerval, and Michelet. This interest was mostly focused on Durer's graphic pro- ductions and especially on the celebrated engraving "Melencolia I." The present paper attempts to survey the literary impact of Diirer and his work on the French Romanticists, with special emphasis on Hugo, and to relate this phenomenon to the move- ment they represent. Les Fleurs du Mal and the Exotic: The Escapist Psychology of a Visionary Poet-FREEMAN G. HENRY, University of Georgia. Baudelaire's development of the escapist psychology of Les Fleurs du Mal corresponds to an autobiographical account of real and illusory experiences. The poet's escapism passes through sev- eral hierarchical stages, each one characterized by the search for illusion on a higher, more sophisticated plane. Despite the increas- ing sophistication, this search never loses its exotic character. For each stage of the illusory hierarchy is described in terms of the climate, the inhabitants, and the geography of distant lands. En rade and the Symbolic Integration of Self-ALLAN H. PASCO, Purdue University. The undeserved neglect and unjustifiable condemnation from which En rade, by J. K. Huysmans, suffers appears to derive from critics' separate consideration of the events of Jacques's dreaming and waking life. When, conversely, it is understood that the dreams and realistic description function, not as two unrelated entities, rather as one, and when the reading is guided by a knowledge of the traditional symbolic systems suggested by the text, En rade is revealed as a highly integrated, masterful account of the protagon- ist's struggle to understand and dominate himself.

GATLIN, Queens College, and H. LEON GATLIN, University of North Caro- lina at Charlotte. A survey of representative SAMLA colleges reveals that the "C" grade in freshman composition is based primarily on lack of supporting detail, inadequate literacy, and absence of fresh or original insights. While there is essential agreement about the meaning of the "C" in all types of institutions, "official" definitions of the grade range from highly impressionistic to entirely mechani- cal. There is enough general agreement throughout the region to assume that a "C" represents "average" if not really "adequate" composition skills. * * * * Harmony, Hominy, and Homonyms: Dialectal Relativism in Freshman English-JAMES C. RAYMOND, University ofAlabama. However sound the theoretical basis of the CCCC statement on Students' Right to their own Language, the resolution is often misunderstood by both teachers and students. Sensible implemen- tation of the CCCC policy would include the following: the devel- opment of standards which are sensitive to more significant aspects of form and content; interpretation of students' vocational aspira- tions as prima facie evidence of their linguistic aspirations; a pluralism in which various institutions might choose the kinds of language skills generally suitable to them as institutions, and vari- ous individuals might choose the variety of language most suitable to them as individuals. * * * * Solving the Problems of Freshman English-HILTON ANDERSON, University of Southern Mississippi. Two of the most important problems in the teaching of fresh- man composition are the apathy of the instructor and the apathy and fear of the student. Both of these problems can be overcome if the instructor cares. By dividing a class of sixteen freshmen into four groups and meeting with the class two periods a week and with each four-man group one half hour per week, I achieved excellent results in the teaching of freshman composition.

TAX, University of North Carolina. Secretary-CHRISTOPH SCHWEITZER, University of North Carolina. Zur Struktur und Thematik des Buchs von Bern (Dietrichs Fluch t)-MICHAEL CURSCHMANN, Princeton University. Much of medieval epic poetry is the product of a process of constant transformation of material that never reaches a definitive or clearly individualized form. Close analysis of one particular text-the "B.v.B"-against the background of its manuscript tra- dition, earlier reworkings of the same material, and contemporary heroic legend, shows that (and how) nevertheless individualization does take place in certain instances which relates the traditional material to contemporary (in this case political) concerns. The Signs of Old Age in Oswald von Wolkenstein's Ich sich und h6r (Klein No. 5)-GEORGE FENWICK JONES, University of Mary- land. Wolkenstein's "Ich sich und h6r" combined two unrelated literary traditions: the "Lament of the Damned Soul" and the "Signs of Old Age." It is not the corpse of a sinner whose soul is suffering in hell that warns against youthful folly, but an ancient man who manifests the inevitable decrepitude of old age. His symp- toms of senility represent a literary tradition reaching back to Horace and Ovid and developed by Pseudo-Cyprian, Maximianus, and Innocent III.

Scholars in Romance languages have usually ignored the fact that German poets took up the petrarchist tradition after 1600, thus transforming the medieval misogynic heritage to catch up belatedly with the European mainstream of erotic poetry. This essay sketches the development of petrarchism in Germany by closely observing the reception and analysing the stylistic exploits as well as the various functions of the snow imagery from Schallenberg to 68</page><page sequence="22">South Atlantic Bulletin Hofmannswaldau. Particular emphasis is placed on the latter's expression "Der schultern warmer schnee," one of his famous oxymora, which the present author traces back to Marino and finally Petrarch's "calda neve il volto," thereby proving the con- tinuity of the concettist tradition. * * * * Johann Christian Giinther and the Satura Tradition in Germany-RICHARD J. ALLEN, Johns Hopkins University. The assimilation of the Graeco-Roman heritage to the German condition, a process completed in the main during the Baroque period, led to the renewal and creative adaptation of the classical genres. Among these was the formal verse satire of Roman proveni- ence, whose efflorescence in Italy, France, and England has been well documented (Ariosto, R6gnier, Boileau, Donne, Pope, etc.), but which likewise flourished in Germany, i.e., from the mid- seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth century. One of the sig- nificant figures in the German tradition, Johann Christian Giinther, is already justly celebrated for his superlative amatory verse, his moving Klagelieder, and his ability to elevate occasional verse to the level of art. However, it is not widely known that he was also an important exponent of the craft of Horace, Persius, and Juvenal. This is regrettable in view of his unique extension of the genre as a blend of the panegyric and the satirical as well as in view of his skillful handling of the traditional topoi and devices of the Roman satura: the quasi-dramatic verse form, the vivid detail, the conver- sational tone, the dichotomy of the lofty and the colloquial, the sudden shifts in style, the autobiographical elements, the rhetorical and epideictic devices, the inclusion of illustrative vignettes and extended metaphors, the apologia, etc. Furthermore, Giinther's thirteen formal verse satires were written by a poet whose artistic efforts signaled an end to the grand Baroque experiment in poetic depersonalization and the beginning of a new age of poetic sub- jectivity (ipso facto an element germane to satura). Thus they pro- vide a platform, critically speaking, that offers a much needed per- spective of the neglected German tradition from Jakob Balde to Johann Daniel Falk. * * * * Ziglers Asiatische Banise 1689 und 1788: Zur Wirkungsge- schichte des Barockromans-VoLKER MEID, University of Massa- chusetts. It is a widely unknown fact that some of the major German novels of the seventeenth century were reissued between 1780 and 1790 causing an angry reaction from the established literary criti- cism of the Enlightenment. The new editions of the Baroque novels, 69</page><page sequence="23">Meeting e.g., Anton Ulrich's Aramena (1669/73-1782/86) and Zigler's Asia- tische Banise (1689-1788), were thoroughly revised by minor, though experienced writers to adjust them to the sentimental prose style of the late eighteenth century and to the then popular genre of the "didactic-sentimental novel" (moralisch-didaktischer Priifungsro- man). This "revival" of the Baroque novel has to be considered in the frequent discussions on the continuity of the German novel in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. * * * * GERMAN II Chairman-FRANK G. RYDER, University of Virginia. Secretary-URsEL BOYD, Eastern Kentucky University. Erbsiinde und Erbtugend in Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahren -KLAUS THOENELT, George Washington University. Most critics hold that Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre (1828) is a social novel without hero. Notwithstanding the title of the book, they contend that Goethe has failed to assign a central func- tion to Wilhelm Meister. This view is questionable. While travelling, Wilhelm is a mediator between secluded communities. Moreover, he acquires the ability to reconcile modes of existence as opposed to each other as those of Makarie and Jarno-Montan. As a surgeon, he is also a psychologist able to convert man's ever-present drive to possess things into reverence for life. In Goethe's terms, he reduces the manifestations of original sin and increases those of original vir- tue. In so changing the human condition prevailing in the tale of the fisherman's son, he also changes society. He becomes the founder of a new way of life. Obviously, this unique and vital function transcends that of a social leader. We contend, therefore, that Wilhelm Meister is the hero of the novel. Goethe's Homunculus as Symbol-DAN R. LATIMER, Auburn University. The character of Homunculus in Faztst II provokes a number of puzzling dramatic and thematic comparisons with other figures and scenes in Goethe's poem. As disembodied spirit Homunculus recalls Faust's early ambitions of transcendence. But in his longing for a proper birth he illustrates the philosophical shift in Pt. II away from transcendent to immanent prejudices. His death-rebirth scene recalls aspects of both the Thammuz vegetation cult and Goethe's own Stirb und Werde doctrine. But finally, the suggestion of menace in Homunculus derives from his kinship with Mephisto and from the frustration of organic law in his alchemical nativity. 70</page><page sequence="24">South Atlantic Bulletin 71 Beaumont and Fletcher in Vienna; On the Sources of Grill- parzer's Ein treuer Diener seines Herrn-F.

"Optimismus" in der DDR-Literatur: Voraussetzungen und Konsequenzen eines zentralen Begriffes der sozialistischen Liter- aturtheorie und -praxis-THEODOR LANGENBRUCH, Georgia Institute of Technology. Historischer Optimismus ist ein Kennzeichen sowohl der marxistischen Gesellschaftslehre als auch der sozialistischen Aesthe- tik. Dieses Prinzip tendiert dazu, den gesellschaftlichen Fortschritt und das Rationale einseitig zu betonen. Als Forderung sozialistischer Kulturpolitik wird Optimismus daher zum Problem. Institutionell verfestigt, manifestiert er sich in epigonaler Fortfiihrung klassischer Traditionen und in der Ablehnung "pessimistischer" Autoren; andererseits entwickeln Autoren wie Kant, Christa Wolf und Plenz- dorf in der Auseinandersetzung mit dogmatischem Optimismus neue Stil- und Ausdrucksformen ("negative Helden," Zitierstil, Parodien). Message from America: The Verse of Walt Whitman as Inter- preted by German Authors in Exile-WARD B. LEWIS, University of Georgia. German writers in exile looked to Walt Whitman during World War II for inspiration at a time of crisis and invoked his name in the pages of journals such as Decision, edited by Klaus Mann in New York, and Deutsche Bldtter, which appeared in Santiago, Chile. Whitman's verse and thought became an object of politics and were employed as an argument both to impel America's participation in the war and to induce her to assume a policy of world leadership among governments. * # # * IRISH STUDIES Chairman-WELDON THORNTON, University of North Carolina.

The Irish Legendary Hero in Yeats, Lady Gregory, and Synge, 1903-1909-JOHN A. BYARS, Converse College. From 1903 to 1909, in their dramas based on Irish legendary sources, Yeats, Lady Gregory, and Synge present a type of hero with a distinctive pride, force of will and concern for fame. Com- bining the roles of champion and poet, this type of hero fulfills both the aesthetic ideals of these writers and reflects their relation- ship to their audience. * * * * O'Casey's Cock-a-Doodle Dandy and the Bardic Tradition- GEORGE POTRATZ, University of Kentucky. In Cock-a-Doodle Dandy Sean O'Casey takes a divided stance toward the Gaelic tradition. He mocks it, or what has become of it, through the figure of Shanaar, a withered and pietistic cousin of Yeats's wandering Aengus. At the same time, however, he affirms it and lays claim-through the Cock himself, an emblem of the poet and the poetic spirit-to membership in the ancient company of Irish satirists. In this way O'Casey establishes an Irish pedigree for his own peculiar breed of dramatic satire. * * * * John Synge's (Irish) Primitives-WILLIAM M. Moss, Wake Forest University. Despite attempts to cast Synge as a closet nationalist or as an earthy devotee of the Celtic Twilight, and more general views of him as a seeker after the essential Irishman, his essays, journals, and even plays reveal surprisingly few consciously and essentially Irish concerns. Rather, under the influence of de Jubainville, Nutt, Frazer, and other folklorists and cultural anthropologists, Synge sought in his Irish primitives the embodiment of a prenational, preethnic, primitive intensity of the life force.

The vexing question of the proper relationship between litera- ture and nationality informs much of Anglo-Irish writing, never 72</page><page sequence="26">South Atlantic Bulletin more radically than in the Revival period. The works of James Stephens show a clear progression from a short-lived belief in the didactic mode (propaganda), to the mimetic mode of his writing until ca. 1915 (essentially, a superficial use of Irish material, espe- cially settings), to the symbiotic mode of his career during his last ten years in Ireland (an attempt to elevate the ideals of the nation by recreating its mythology).

Fools, Heroes, and Saints: The Petrarchan Theme of Fame in Donne's Songs and Sonets-SILVIA RUFFO-FIORE, University of South Florida. Donne creatively adapts the Petrarchan fame theme to his own vision of mutual love and man's quest for permanence through poetry. In "The triple Foole," Donne follows the Petrarchan ana- logue closely, while in "The undertaking" and "The Relique" Petrarchan ideas are a springboard for a witty, innovative, and dramatic variation. As fools, heroes, or saints Donne's lovers "anger destiny" by seeking self-eternalization. Awareness of the Petrarchan concepts at the heart of Donne's poems reveals to what extent he was in fact a revolutionary poet. The Roman de la Rose and Boccaccio's II Filostrato-MICHAEL HARRY BLECHNER, University of Tulsa. II Filostrato is indebted for its plot to Benoit de Sainte-Maure and Guido delle Colonne, but in its attitude toward love and love's effects on the lover it is a dramatization of the influential Roman de la Rose, particularly of Guillaume de Lorris' part. Amant is given "a local habitation and a name" as Troilo, the Rose as Criseida, and Ami as Pandaro. Jean de Meun completed the Roman and gave it a "happy" ending; Boccaccio in effect also completed Guillaume's text, but he shows the disastrous effects of the kind of love pursued by Amant. * * * * Reality of Illusion and Illusion of Reality in Leopardi's Zibaldone-ERAsMO GERATO, Florida State University. The purpose of this study is to develop the theme of illusion in Leopardi as presented in one of the poet's most obscure works, the Zibaldone. An attempt has been made to show how the theme of illusion changes throughout the poet's lifetime. 73</page><page sequence="27">Meeting Illusion is in itself a powerful and positive force which, in the end, remains the sole element capable of sustaining the poet even when he is faced with the grand paradox of the "vanity of all illusions" as contrasted with the "necessity of illusion in man- kind."

SHARP, Virginia Commonwealth University. The date traditionally assigned to the replacing of the -th with -s as the normal third person singular present indicative of verbs is "around 1600," or "during Shakespeare's career." This study examines fifteen plays, and analyzes all occurrences of the -th form as either metrical or rhetorical, with only two occurrences where neither will account for it. This suggests that the -th form was not replaced in normal discourse during Shakespeare's career but before it, inasmuch as he does not use it except for metrical or rhetorical effects. * * * * Permutations of Relative Clauses in Early Modern English- CAROLE P. HINES, Old Dominion University. Relative clause constructions from Early Modern English pro- vide some evidence of the opposing tendencies at work during the time. On one hand we see not only the need for syntactic groupings in a word-order oriented language opposed to a strong traditional tendency to move complex elements to the end of the sentence, but also on the other hand we see the need for placing a complex 74</page><page sequence="28">South Atlantic Bulletin noun phrase in a sentence-initial position in order to focus atten- tion on it. The demands of the opposing needs of the language are worked out on the individual rule level through the loss of old rules, the development of new rules, or the addition or deletion of constraints on old rules. Ultimately a balance is achieved. Conjunction and Ambiguity: Some Problems of Coordinators in English, Past and Present-DoUGLAs SHORT, North Carolina State University. Recent attempts to explain the phenomenon of conjunction have primarily employed syntactic or transformational arguments to formulate conjunction theories. However, if we examine the problem of ambiguous conjunction, we discover that the individual conjoining elements themselves can have a variety of different lexical properties and are therefore explainable by a distinctive features analysis. Such an analysis enables us to postulate a theory of conjunction that sees the phenomenon as inherent in the seman- tic rather than the syntactic component. MEDIEVAL LITERATURE Chairman-FRANCIS A. HILL, Mississippi State University. Secretary-SIEGFRIED WENZEL, University of North Carolina. Death and Dying in Medieval Manuscript Illumination- GLORIA K. FIERO, University of Southwestern Louisiana. Manuscript illumination is our best resource for an apprecia- tion of the social life of medieval man. In this paper death is exam- ined as it appears in a variety of miniatures in manuscripts dating from the sixth to the fifteenth century. Analysis reveals that (1) in secular manuscripts death is treated with remarkable objectivity, (2) in religious manuscripts the eschatological consequences of death predominate, and (3) after the thirteenth century manuscripts (like the ars moriendi) appear in which the act of dying becomes more important than the consequences of dying. In these illuminations a more naturalistic and existential approach to death is apparent. (Accepted for publication in The Connoisseur.) The Apocalyptic Vision in Old English Poetry-HUGH T. KEENAN, Georgia State University. Apocalypticism as a manner of reacting to intolerable periods of stress recurs with certain images and ideas. These can be traced both in contemporary life and in the late period of Old English poetry. In addition to coloring much OE poetry with the urgency of Christian apocalypticism, this human state of fear and hopeless- 75</page><page sequence="29">Meeting ness transmits its message of the longing for escape through four fixed images in literature and art: 1) the charitable state of the saved, 2) the drunken state of the damned, 3) the fiery messenger of God, and 4) the fire-flood of the End. For that time, as for ours, the last is the dominant image. Art in the Cantigas de Santa Maria of Alfonso X-CHARLES L. NELSON, Eastern Kentucky University. In an attempt to show Alfonso's involvement in the actual pro- duction of the illuminations of the Cantigas, a number of color slides of the art work were shown illustrating the great variation between what the narratives relate and what the visualizations of those narratives portray. The conclusion was reached that Alfonso X probably left the direction and overall planning of the art to some master artist while he himself was little involved in the pro- duction of the famous illustrations.

Secretary-IRvING DEER, University of South Florida. The Computer: From Super Power to Christ Figure-ALICE CAROL GAAR, Auburn University. A "popular" figure in science fiction today is the super com- puter which takes control of human affairs (or tries to), convinced that imperfect human beings are doomed by their own illogicality. Since one cannot assign a living personality to a computer, one must assume that the portrayal of the computer as potentially dangerous represents a space-age anthropomorphism somewhat analogous to a primitive's tribal gods. The computer as such is not important here nor is it in this paper analogous to the sacrificial aspect of the Christ figure. In all of the novels discussed-Heinrich Hauser's Gigant Him or Giant Brain (Munich: Goldmann, 1962), Martin Caidin's The God Machine (New York: Bantam, 1968), David Gerrold's When HARLIE Was One (Garden City: Double- day, 1972), and D. F. Jones' The Fall of Colossus (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1974)-the quasi-religious overtones are obvious and sometimes even blatant. The paper is an inquiry into several fictional responses to the increasing emphasis on formal logical processes. 76</page><page sequence="30">South Atlantic Bulletin 77 The Jew as Sex Hero-STEVE RUBIN, University of South Florida.

The clearest example of Machado de Assis' influence on the Marxist Graciliano Ramos is reflected in the latter's second novel, S.

In both works the narrator, bidding for understanding, argues his innocence with regard to the wife he has destroyed.

The type of debate is a dialectic akin to that now associated with Hegel: each thesis leads to an anti- thesis which in turn leads to a synthesis. The poet sees man through a series of paradoxes: the mortality of the body and the immortality of fame, the wise man made a fool by love, etc. Each paradox leads to the synthesis of man's nature. * * * * Ritualistic Form and Legal Formula in Njals Saga-SUsAN K. HAGEN, University of Virginia. The exacting legal passages in the Old Icelandic Njals saga have been viewed as either an artistic flaw on the part of the author or a satiric statement in regard to its subject. Ancient respect for the power of words in attested patterns, ritualistic efficacy of forms, and formulaic composition, however, all join to suggest that the legal formalism is a manifestation of a more general legacy in the Islendiga s6gur of ritualistic practice, the efficacy of which would have been recognized as valid for their tenth-century ancestors by the thirteenth-century audience of the saga. * * * * Edvard Munch and Contemporary Literature-J. GILL HOL- LAND, Davidson College. An examination of the personal library of the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch (now housed in the Munch Museum in Oslo) shows that Munch was familiar with the literature of the day and indeed left a partial record of his reading in the margins 78</page><page sequence="32">South Atlantic Bulletin of works by such writers as Zola and Baudelaire. Munch often took literary figures as portrait subjects and in turn shows up in the novels, poetry, and drama written by these contemporaries. One noteworthy instance of the fictionalized Munch is found in the novel Homo Sapiens by his friend Stanislaw Przybyszewski, who figures in a number of Munch's paintings and prints dealing with the subject of jealousy and the bohemian life. Structure and Theme in Kjeld Abell's Vetsera blomstrer ikke for enhver-ORLEY I. HOLTAN, Slippery Rock State College. SEASA Chairman-HASSELL A. SIMPSON, Hampden-Sydney College. Secretary-ALFRED REID, Furman University. Malamud's Suffering Savants-SANDY COHEN, Albany State College. Malamud has adopted many approaches and techniques to convey his themes which were demanded in no small part by the unstable and largely myth-dominated nature of contemporary society. Often myth controls the lives of his protagonists. Their central task is to learn, usually through suffering, to abolish these myths from their lives. For his Jewish protagonists this task is much harder because of their traditionally and historically hostile environment. Malamud's Schlemiel and the Comic Grotesque-GRIFFITH T. PUGH, Florida State University. Conspicuous among the sufferers that Bernard Malamud de- picts in his fiction, now nine volumes, is the schlemiel, a tradi- tional figure in Yiddish literature. The figure was a little common man, a sufferer, inept but ironically hopeful in the face of crush- ing odds, persistent, enduring, courageous, and pathetically comic. Beginning with the second novel, The Assistant, Malamud casts the schlemiel in a conspicuous, often dominant role in settings and circumstances that characteristically merge the comic with the grotesque. * * * * Philip Roth's Letting Go of Religion: Goodbye, Greatness- JULIAN MASON, University of North Carolina at Charlotte. At the beginning of his career Philip Roth showed a potential for greatness as a writer. Even though he remains a good writer with certain obvious and valuable skills, the possibility of great- ness for him seems to have vanished. A significant reason for this 79</page><page sequence="33">Meeting change is that he has abandoned important moral concerns (for him rooted in the religious faith of Judaism) for, instead, some- times ethical, psychological, or sociological considerations, but more often for just wit. For Roth the writer this was a mistake. Portraits of the Jew as Young Artist in the Fiction of Philip Roth-JOHN N. MCDANIEL, Middle Tennessee State University. The Daedalus myth provides the most appropriate paradigm for describing the arc traveled by the protagonists in Philip Roth's fiction. Many of Roth's early protagonists are artists-prophets who rely on their self-invented "betterness" to rise above what is com- mon, crude, and crassly materialistic in society; after When She Was Good, however, Roth concerns himself with fallen heroes, artists brought down by their own "inventions." The Daedalus figure adumbrated in Roth's protagonists emphasizes his increasing interest in the plight of the artist, rather than the plight of the Jew, in America. SLAVIC Chairman-JOHN J.

My objective is to analyze the symbolic mode of expression in Z. N. Hippius' mystical poetry. It will be contended that symbolic expression is the most felicitous form of expression of mystical experience. A mode of maximal associative potential is necessary for the depiction of the elusive, ineffable realm of emotion and idea. At first the symbol will be localized in Hippius' poetry. Its characteristic property will be discussed, and its function will be illustrated with excerpts from Hippius' poems. Subsequently, Hippius' symbolic mode of expression will be analyzed in two poems "The Song" (1893) and "Between" (1905). These Ipoems written at two different periods of creativity-beginning and ma- ture periods-illustrate the development of symbolic expression in Hippius' poetry. Mixail Kuzmin's Aleksandrijskie pesni-JOACHIM T. BAER, University of North Carolina at Greensboro. 80</page><page sequence="34">South Atlantic Bulletin In this cycle of thirty-two poems distributed over seven sections the poet praises the civilization of ancient Alexandria. His love for it is expressed through rich sound instrumentation and vivid imagery focusing on the brittle and transitory nature of all precious objects from which life derives its pleasure and physical intensity. Ancient Alexandria, once a city of unbounded delights, is used as an image for the brevity of joy and love. Transformed into an aesthetic experience through recollection and the creative process of the poet's imagination the joyous physical perception of life in Alexandria is preserved. Transitoriness and death are van- quished by beauty which lives on in the poet's memory, and creative product. * * * * Christianity in Osip Mandelstam's Poetry-GEORGE IVASK, Uni- versity of Massachusetts. * * * * Georgii Ivanov: From Snob Aestheticism to Existentialism- IGOR CHINNOV, Vanderbilt University. # * * * SPANISH I Chairman-HENRY ZIOMEK, University of Georgia.

La satira es un aspecto esencial de la coredia del siglo de oro. Desde esta perspectiva estetica las "comedias de capa y espada" adquieren valor trascendente. Calderon desarrolla una tecnica dramatica al servicio de la censura de las costumbres. Plantea el conflicto con precisi6n. Complica la acci6n hasta que un ambiente ficticio e irreal cambia el curso de aquella. En el caso de La dama duende, una figura sobrenatural obtiene relieve por la fantasia primitiva del criado y una serie de acasos y ardides confunden a don Manuel. La ironia c6mica ofrece una evidente denuncia de la supersticion, mientras los parlamentos de Cosme por medio de especificos procedimientos estilisticos logran producir la risa ante ciertas creencias falsas de la epoca. * * * * La posible genealogia de la Danza de la muerte: una busqueda de sus origenes remotos-JOSEPH SNOW, University of Georgia. The Danza de la muerte, in its emotional content and use of detail, corresponds to a particular social and intellectual back- ground. But of its pre-history as a combination of nuclear ideas and themes much more can be said. Earlier hispanic literary works, 81</page><page sequence="35">Meeting and notable among them a cantiga of Alfonso X, show that differ- ent social and intellectual backgrounds make use of the same basic elements as the Danza and that we need to revise our objective in searching for antecedents. * * * * Calder6n's Ideological Impact on the East European Litera- tures-JULIAN S. DROBOWOLSKI, Western Carolina University. The first penetration of Calderon's works into the Slavic coun- tries took place in Warsaw (1782) and the first piece produced was El alcalde de Zalamea. Fifteen years after the "discovery" of Calder6n by the Schlegel brothers, John Kaminski presented in Iwow (1824-1827) three Calderonian dramas with El medico de su honra. It is a great credit to Kaminski that he opened the door of this part of Europe for Calder6n. The real invasion of Calder6n came with the romantic period and with the best translation of El principe constante by the great poet Julius Slowacki (1843), which marks a long reign of the Spanish genius in Poland. Don Fernando became deep-rooted in the Slavic soil, leading to an event without precedent in world literature: a foreign work becoming the patrimony of another country, as a symbol of its struggle to regain its lost independence. The influence of Calderon has remained in the Slavic coun- tries up to the modern times and penetrated to all Slavic regions including Russia. * * * * The Mortal Melancholy in Garcilaso de la Vega-FRANK E.

Amor, concupiscencia y codicia en la tematica galdosiana- ALAN A. GONZALEZ-ARAUZO, North Carolina State University. Incontinent eroticism is one of the themes through which Gald6s depicts a dislocated society. Le6n Roch and Jose Maria Bueno de Guzman, both exhibit this destructive passion. Leon confuses concupiscence with love and ruins his life. Jose Maria futilely pursues the desires of others and brings ruin and frustration on himself and others. In the process, love is degraded; all moral and social values are corrupted; concupiscence and greed reign supreme. 82</page><page sequence="36">South Atlantic Bulletin Gald6s, Ayguals de Izco, and the Platonic Origin of Marianela -B. J. DENDLE, University of Kentucky. Critical disagreement as to the interpretation of Marianela is in part caused by our ignorance of Gald6s' sources. The inspiration for Marianela must, however, be sought in Ayguals de Izco's "La belleza del alma," the intrigue of which markedly resembles that of Galdos' novel. Marianela is, nevertheless, much more complex a work than Ayguals' tale. Relating his action to the past experi- ence of mankind, Gald6s uses numerous metaphors of Hellenistic origin. Plato's allegory of the cave is essential to our understanding of the novel; Pablo's reception of sight represents, in Platonic terms, passage from the light of the sun to the darkness of the cave. The fundamental teaching of the novel is very much in keep- ing with the spirit of Greece: the avoidance of all excess. * * * * The Meaning of Metaphor in La Regenta-MIRIAM WAGNER RICE, University of Florida. La Regenta is a novel rich in metaphor. A study of these meta- phors reveals that Clarin, like any artist, was influenced by the cultural currents of his time. The novel's metaphors are of two types: implicit and explicit. The former are descriptions or situa- tions literal in the book's context but with a figurative meaning implied by that context. Explicit metaphors are ordinary com- parisons. Among the most important motifs common to both types are birds, animals, and the hunt. These motifs are related to the pro- tagonists in such a way as to define the conflicts they face as a struggle analogous to the struggle for existence in nature as de- scribed by nineteenth-century evolutionists. * * * * Perfil del genero chico: Estado y sentido de los estudios criticos -AUGUSTo HACTHOUN, University of Alabama. * * * * La destrucci6n de Sodoma: A Reconstruction of Federico Garcia Lorca's Lost Drama-SUZANNE BYRD, College of Charleston. Dr. Luis Saenz de la Calzada of Le6n, Spain, the only living person who heard Lorca's reading of the manuscript, has recounted the cardinal points of this revolutionary theatrical work. The dramatist, denouncing established social concepts of morality, has developed the theme of sexual deviation within a Biblical frame- work of violence. The homosexuality of the Angels leads to the climactic scene of incest, as Lot is overcome with desire for his daughters. 83</page><page sequence="37">Meeting A Musical Aspect of Garcia Lorca's Poetry-EDWARD F. STAN- TON, University of Kentucky. Just as the lyre was the emblem of ancient poetry, the guitar might have been Garcia Lorca's. The instrument functions as an image or symbol with a definite range of meanings in his verse, but exerts a more pervasive effect in poetic rhythms, tones and dynamics. Insofar as it embodies a fusion of popular and classical influences, the guitar can illuminate Lorca's own poetry-a mar- velous union of traditional forms with the most refined sensibility and technique. * * * * SPANISH III Chairman-JosEi ANGELES, Florida State University.

Boquitas pintadas: Novela de la "desecritura"-JUAN LOVE- LUCK, University of South Carolina. * * * * La soledad en la obra de Caballero Calderon-ROBERT KIRS- NER, University of Miami. The predominant theme in the novels of Caballero Calder6n is the loneliness of living. From within the self, each one must forge his own vital heroism, which consists in transcending one's own desolateness. Love, Country, Religion are but pretexts for the noble effort. Yet, loneliness is not mere static lugubriousness. It embodies within it the search for dialogue. Indeed, unless one undertakes to experience the loneliness of his fellow beings, he will not succeed in grasping the reality of his own devastating solitude. * * * # Jorge Luis Borges y las vanguardias culturales-STELIO CRO, McMaster University.

Although the story seems very simple, the events are structured around a main plot (an officer setting up a prostitution "service" upon instructions of the Peruvian army) and a subplot (the activi- ties of a religious sect). Both stories are narrated by means of army reports, letters, radio broadcasts, newspaper articles, dialogues. Both plots mix in the characters of Pantale6n and one of the prostitutes sacrificed by the fanatic sect, with whom the officer falls in love. Pantale6n also stands up as a contemporary technocrat who is capable of carrying out any kind of assignment just to do his duty.

Ukrainian Women Writers and Their Protagonists-OLENA H. SACIUK, University of Florida. Unlike many of the European literatures, women writers play a prominent role in Ukrainian letters. In the 1850's Marko Vovcok's short stories are first to treat the peasant woman under serfdom in prose. At first other women writers follow suit, but eventually they turn from their peasant protagonists and portray women from different social classes. Some of these women writers become pacesetters in their genre, as Ol'ha Kobyljans'ka in the novel and Lesja Ukrajinka in poetry. Role-Playing as Art in Maya Angelou's Caged Bird-MYRA MCMURRY, Valdosta State College. Maya Angelou's autobiographical novel, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, tells the story of a self-conscious child who is trapped in roles which conceal her true selfhood. Painfully and humorously she learns that by playing her roles creatively, she can transform them into vehicles for self-realization. Role-playing be- comes an art which enables her to transcend restriction by assimi- lating adversity into her own creative potential rather than allow- ing the role to impose limits on selfhood. 85</page><page sequence="39">Meeting Toys and Slaves: The Suppression of Women Throughout the World in the Writings of Mary Gaunt-CARROLL MILLER, Tennes- see Tech University. Mary Gaunt's most significant contribution to early twentieth- century literature is her analysis of the role of women in society, in which she demonstrates that patriarchies insure the suppression of women and that the similarity of the forms of suppression over the world is concealed only by a thin veneer of cultural variation. Her travelogues explore sexism in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Jamaica; and The Uncounted Cost, one of her most successful novels, adds psychological depth to her commentary by portraying the effect of sexual politics upon individuals. * * # * From Emancipation to Liberation: Ina Boudier-Bakker (1875- 1966)-JENNY B.

SECRETARY'S REPORT The past year has been a reasonably active and typical one for SAMLA, characterized by considerable success in some areas and disappointing results in others, by gratifying expansion here and some anticipated retraction there, and by Executive Committee actions, for example, experimentally new on the one hand and happily resurrective of the old on the other. Not an especially poetic year perhaps, but one suggestive of a reconciliation of opposites under the attractive headnote, continuing vitality. And, despite some playful temptations, referring to Coleridge's aesthetic principle does seem more genuinely appropri- ate and pertinent here than quoting from "The Jabberwock." The pull of opposites is especially apparent this year in considering the publications sponsored by the Association. As if in compensation for a recent year when there were two SAMLA Studies Awards winners, there was no prize- winning manuscript submitted to the $500 Awards Competition in 1974, and I especially want to remind scholars with manuscripts near completion that the 1975 competition will officially open on January 1. After five years on the Awards Committee, three of them as Chairman, Aubrey Williams (Florida) completes his tenure this year with the particular thanks and commendation of the Executive Committee for his knowledgeable and dedicated service to the Association. Manuscripts for the 1975 competition should be submitted to the incoming Chairman of the Awards Committee, J. Wayne Conner, Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, University of Florida, Gainesville 32601. To look even casually this year at the other SAMLA-sponsored publication is to note a happy adjustment in the pagination, made to accommodate manu- script submissions recently increasing in both number and quality. The chubby May and November issues of the South Atlantic Bulletin are almost sufficient in number of pages to equal three issues of the usual size. In relation to that and on the recommendation of the Editor, Frank M. Duffey, and the Bulletin Edi- torial Board as a whole, the Executive Committee voted last December to at-</page><page sequence="42">South Atlantic Bulletin 89 tempt something of an experiment in appreciation. The committee authorized the payment of $10.00 for each Bulletin manuscript evaluated by scholars to whom Associate Editors must frequently turn for assistance. Amounting to a total expenditure of $610 to 32 different readers over the effective nine-month period, these token payments generally went to SAMLA members who hadl been good enough to evaluate other Bulletin manuscripts on various occasions over the years. And perhaps to have made this gesture of appreciation to them especially, has been an appropriate way for SAMLA to approach the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the official journal of the Association in 1935. Whether it will be feasible or possible to continue the experiment will be determined by Executive Committee review in Washington. The Executive Committee was also considering both the past and the future in selecting sites for the 1976 and 1977 annual meetings. In keeping with the usual rotation pattern of meeting in Atlanta every other year, the 1975 con- vention to be held at the Biltmore there has already been announced. Noting that the Association was founded in Atlanta in 1928, however, the Committee has looked ahead to the desirability of celebrating SAMLA's fiftieth anniversary in that centrally located city in 1978. Consequently, the annual meetings of both 1975 and 1976 will be held in Atlanta, with Orlando, Florida, having been chosen for the 1977 convention, and a return to Atlanta in view for 1978. In both 1976 and 1977, SAMLA convention headquarters will be in new hotels, neither of them presently completed-the Peachtree Center Plaza Hotel in 1976 and the Orlando Sheraton Towers in 1977. The convention sites chosen for 1976 and 1977 essentially reaffirm Associa- tion policy of rotating the location of the annual meeting in a manner geograph- ically equitable for as many members as possible. To try in a sense to bring the convention to the membership is particularly important in the present con- text of national concern about both energy and economics. Attendance at the meeting in Washington this year will certainly not approach that for an Atlanta convention-well above 2,500 in 1973. But more than 1,300 persons did pre- register for the meeting this year, and probably some 1,800 members will attend, the presence of many of them made possible only by the geographical proximity of the convention. The lower anticipated convention attendance this year ironically combines with another opposite: SAMLA membership is higher now than it has been in the fall of any previous year in Association history. More convention packets than ever before (almost 4,500) were mailed out in September and October to members, special guests, and exhibitors. And I am happy to report that actual memberships in SAMLA now total 4,216, including 115 emeritus and honorary members, 400 associate members, and 3,701 regular and joint husband-wife mem- bers. Especially in a period of shrinking institutional travel funds, the geograph- ical breakdown of the membership directly affects convention attendance and might be of interest here. North Carolina continues to lead the other SAMLA states in memberships with a total of 712, and both Florida and Georgia can claim well above 500 members in the Association. South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia make up the second tier of states, each with more than 300 mem- bers. Some 270 members reside in Alabama, 191 in Kentucky, and 168 in Mary- land, with the remaining membership scattered among some thirty states and a few foreign countries. In addition, more than 170 libraries subscribe to the South Atlantic Bulletin. As an interesting sidenote, more than 60% of the SAMLA membership consists of those whose primary professional interests fall under the general heading of English and American language and literature. Evidently, the foreign-language professors who originally founded the Associa- tion have richly succeeded in making their colleagues in those disciplines feel very welcome.</page><page sequence="43">90 Meeting In connection with types of Association memberships, the Executive Com- mittee last year noted with some surprise that there are currently only three honorary members on the SAMLA rolls and directed President Bub to reacti- vate the apparently forgotten Committee on Honorary Members. That Com- mittee's deliberations during the year will probably result in the nomination of several persons for election to honorary memberships in the Association at the Washington business meeting. SAMLA's second annual convention in the nation's capital city gives every promise of being outstanding. That promise is in a large measure the direct restlt of special efforts of an extraordinarily efficient and cooperative Local Committee on Arrangements, made up entirely of volunteers from the host institutions for the meeting. To the superb chairman of that committee, James Burks of George Washington University, to his always cordial and efficient secre- tary, Esther Naylor, and to the sub-committee chairmen and the hard-working members of their staffs, I extend the very sincere appreciation of the Executive Committee and all SAMLA members at the Washington convention. I want also particularly to thank the artist Frank Maturo for the very special pleasure offered SAMLA members through the convention display of his beautifully de- tailed copperplate illustrations of Cervantes' Don Quijote, to the University of North Carolina at Asheville for sponsoring the display, and to Marcel Andrade of that institution for being the indispensable catalyst at every stage of prepara- tions for the exhibition. As has been usual in these reports since 1967, the Secretary wishes, in a necessarily inadequate way, to express on behalf of all SAMLA members the deep sense of gratitude we feel toward the University of Tennessee for such admirably constant support of the Association's executive office over the years. Here, the Secretary can discern no opposites, but rather a productive union of coordinate purposes which has made possible so much that SAMLA has recently attempted in service to the advancement of the humanities in the southeast. One final pairing of opposites this year should be mentioned, however. The SAMLA membership mailing list has recently been computerized. Despite some associations of accuracy with computers, they can but feed us back what they have first been fed; and they are indiscriminately voracious machines. So I appeal to each member to help the SAMLA office provide the right kind and quantity of computer nutrition-accurate information about your current mail- ing address, institutional affiliation, and professional rank and special interests- thereby effecting a more nearly adequate reconciliation of such information now recorded and the expectation of a greater degree of accuracy through computer use.

The very substantial increase in that activity is indicated by corresponding increases in revenues and expenses for the year and in the total monies handled by the Treasurer's office. As usual, the financial statement consists of three exhibits. Exhibit A represents the Balance Sheet of the Association at September 30, 1974, exactly as prepared by the auditor and contained in his report to the Executive Com- mittee. Exhibit B is the Income Statement of the Association for October 1, 1973, through September 30, 1974, as prepared by the auditor, and contains a detailed breakdown of revenues and expenditures for the year. Additional in-</page><page sequence="44">South Atlantic Bulletin 91 formation is provided by Exhibit C, the Treasurer's Fiscal Review, a brief, comparative financial statement bringing together the Fund Balance at Septem- ber 30, 1973, and the Fund Balance at September 30, 1974, and showing the total monies handled by the Treasurer's office during the fiscal year. The Fund Balance at each of these dates is also broken down in Exhibit C to show the cash assets of the Association in terms of checking and savings accounts and certificates. The figures in Exhibit C show that the Fund Balance has increased during the year by $5,572.82, representing the second largest annual increase in the Fund Balance in Association history (the largest occurring in 1969). The current Fund Balance is $37,324.90 compared to $31,752.08 last year. As exhibit C indi- cates, slightly more than $67,000.00 was handled by the Treasurer's office during 1973-74, an increase of more than $10,000.00 above the previous fiscal year. Exhibit B reflects very substantial increases in all three general categories of Association expenditures for the year, the total increase amounting to slightly more than $4,000.00. On the other hand, increased income from the Association's revenue accounts has been even more substantial, totaling some $8,000.00 above revenues for the previous fiscal year. As examples, total income from dues payments is up more than $4,000.00; from exhibit space rentals, more than $500; from program advertising, more than $1,000.00; and from interest on savings, almost $1,000.00.

In round figures, the comparison shows that income from dues pay- ments has risen from $8,000 to $18,000; exhibit space rentals, from $3,000 to $7,000; program advertising, from $1,200 to $4,000; and interest on savings, from $100 to $2,000. Over the same period, the Association's fund balance has increased from $8,000 to the present $37,000. The Treasurer wishes at this point to add some sobering words to his glow- ing financial report. For several perfectly natural reasons, the coming fiscal year will very probably bring with it substantial decreases in almost all Associa- tion revenue accounts and will unquestionably bring substantial increases in most categories of Association expense. It would be normal, in fact, for the Association's fund balance to decline at least slightly during the coming year. One reason is clear to everyone: rampant inflation. Other reasons, which might not be so evident, include the earlier than usual 1974 convention, resulting in a greater number of dues payments (through preregistration) falling within the past fiscal year. Also, if typical, the Washington convention will be somewhat more expensive for the Association than meetings in Atlanta or elsewhere; yet attendance in Washington will be substantially lower, meaning reduced income from such accounts as convention registration and new memberships. Finally, greatly increased publication costs and other financial woes faced by both uni- versity and commercial publishers will certainly mean further cutbacks in their promotional budgets and consequent decreases in exhibit and advertising in- come for SAMLA. To return to the present, however, after considering all aspects of the cur- rent financial status of the Association, I am pleased again this year to report that it is excellent. As usual, the annual billing for membership dues not paid EXHIBIT C: TREASURER'S FISCAL REVIEW, 1973-1974 Fund balance 30 September 1973 $31,752.08 (Including: Checking account $ 4,974.44 Savings account 26,650.10 Total cash assets $31,624.54 Revenues fiscal year 1973-1974 35,442.55 Total to be accounted for $67,194.63 Expenses fiscal year 1973-1974 $29,869.73 Fund balance 30 September 1974 37,324.90* (Including: Checking account $ 6,939.77 Savings account and certificates 31,036.96 Total cash assets $37,976.73 Total accounted for $67,194.63 *For accounting accuracy, the fund balance does not include income from ad- vance purchases of meal tickets or preregistration during September; the amount of this income is included, however, in the total cash assets (see "Advances for 1974 Convention" in Exhibit A).</page><page sequence="47">94 Meeting through convention registration will be done in December or January.

BRATTON, Association Treasurer. EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE T he Executive Committee of the South Atlantic Modern Language Associa- tion held its first convention meeting October 31, 1974, at 2:15 p.m. in the Adams Suite of the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D. C. President Douglas F. Bub presided. Other members present or joining the Committee in session were: Vice President-Robert L. Kellogg; Executive Secretary-Edward W. Brat- ton; Editor-Frank M. Duffey; Retiring President-Stephen Manning; term ex- piring 1974-Armand E. Singer; term expiring 1975-George Bergen and Ria Stambaugh; term expiring 1976-William MacBain and T. Dan Young. The Committee first approved the minutes of both the Executive Committee and Business Meeting of the forty-third annual convention in Atlanta, Georgia, as published in the South Atlantic Bulletin (January, 1974). As the second order of business, the President reported that the MLA had provided him with minutes of the most recent MLA Executive Council meeting, which he had been unable to attend because it was scheduled so near the time of the SAMLA convention. He then read excerpts from the minutes, particularly noting Council actions or MLA activities in connection with the new professional interest divisions set up by the national association, the new graduated dues structure, and matters related to the MLA Delegate Assembly report and recom- mendations to the Council. The President then commented briefly on his tenure in office and expressed particular thanks to those members who had so readily accepted appointment to various SAMLA committees during the year. As the third order of business, the report of the Executive Secretary was accepted as read. In connection with the Secretary's report, the question of why there are comparatively few SAMLA members at junior and community colleges was raised. The Committee discussed various aspects of the question and related matters at some length, particularly including: 1) the SAMLA image projected to faculty at these institutions through the Bulletin and the convention; 2) the relative degree of emphasis given to research and to teaching in the activities of the Association; 3) the relationship between scholarship and teaching in the modern lan- guages and literatures; 4) older SAMLA convention groups (Freshman English, Language Teach- ing) and recently added groups (Films, Humanities, Popular Culture) perhaps of particular interest to faculty at two-year institutions; 5) the work of the SAMLA Committee on Junior and Community Colleges, concluded in 1972. As a result of the discussion, it was moved and seconded that George Bergen be appointed Chairman of a committee to examine possibilities of furthering SAMLA relationships with junior and community colleges. With the additional provision that special consideration be given to humanism, as opposed to research-oriented aspects of modern languages and literatures, the motion was passed with one abstention.</page><page sequence="48">South Atlantic Bulletin 95 As the next order of business, the Editor presented the following report on manuscripts submitted to and articles printed in the Bulletin during the year: Articles received, 11-1-73 to 10-28-74, by field: American 17; Comparative 3; English 39; French 10; German 3; Linguistics 1; Slavic 3; Spanish 4.

Articles accepted and awaiting publication: American 6; Comparative 1; English 7; French 5. Total: 19. The Editor then mentioned the need for one or two additional Associate Editors to fill vacancies on the Bulletin staff, and a motion was made, seconded, and unanimously passed authorizing the Editor to make the necessary appoint- ments. The Treasurer's report for the fiscal year 1973-74 was next accepted and approved as read; and the Auditor's report and the report of the Auditing Com- mittee were accepted as submitted by the Treasurer. As the next order of business, the Secretary reviewed the results of earlier Executive Committee action to make token payments of $10.00 for each manu- script evaluated by readers necessarily enlisted by Bulletin Associate Editors. After a discussion of various aspects of the nine-month experiment in apprecia- tion (resulting in a total expenditure of $610 in payments to 32 different readers), a motion was made and seconded to continue the policy of making the $10.00 payments. With one negative vote and two abstentions, the motion was passed. A motion was then made, seconded, and unanimously passed that SAMLA continue its constituency support of the Southern Humanities Conference by means of the usual contribution of $100. Aubrey Williams (Florida), retiring Chairman of the SAMLA Studies Awards Committee; J. Wayne Conner (Florida), incoming Chairman of the Committee; and Ralph Stephens, Director of the University of Georgia Press, then joined the Executive Committee. The report of the Awards Committee, indicating that no prize-winning manuscript had been submitted during the 1974 competition, was already in hand and was formally accepted with the thanks of the Executive Committee to the Chairman and members of the Awards Com- mittee. The Executive Committee then rejected a suggestion that a representa- tive of the cooperating press be appointed as a member of the Awards Commit-</page><page sequence="49">96 Meeting tee and reaffirmed the current decision-making process of the competition, in- cluding the stipulations that unrevised dissertations are unacceptable and that manuscripts not winning the $500 Award, but particularly worthy in scholarship and writing, be awarded Honorable Mention in the competition and recom- mended for serious, independent consideration by the University of Georgia Press. Various proposed changes in the Awards competition were then con- sidered; and, after a thorough discussion of the scholarly standards, procedures, timing, manuscript submissions, publicity, and other aspects of the competition, a motion was made and seconded to continue the competition as in the past during 1975 and to reconsider proposed changes in the spring, when additional pertinent information would be available. The motion was passed by acclama- tion. As the next order of business, a motion was made, seconded, and unani- mously passed directing the Secretary to increase the convention preregistration fee from $1.00 to $1.50 and the on-site registration fee from $2.00 to $3.00, effective with the 1975 convention. The Executive Committee adjourned the first session at 5:15 p.m. The second session of the Executive Committee began at 9:15 a.m., Novem- ber 1, in the Adams Suite, with Robert Hiller (Tennessee), Chairman of the Program Committee, present for a report of that Committee's actions during the year. Professor Hiller also presented a Program Committee recommendation that a regulation be established stipulating that no member can serve as a principal officer (chairman or secretary) of two regular SAMLA convention groups for the same annual meeting. With the further stipulation that the regulation would not apply to group officers elected at the 1974 convention, the Executive Committee approved the recommendation and directed the Secretary to insure its implementation through current group nominating committees. As the next order of business, the report of the SAMLA Committee on Resolutions was presented by the Chairman, Egbert Krispyn (Georgia) and ap- proved by the Executive Committee. In connection with the report and other issues raised by the Chairman, the Executive Committee instructed the Secretary to take appropriate steps: (1) to arrange a division into smoking and non-smoking sections at future convention meetings; and (2) to indicate through the Bulletin that the SAMLA Program Committee is the appropriate body for considering and responding to membership complaints or comments about procedures used in selecting papers to be read at the regular SAMLA Sections. As the next order of business, Ashley Brown (South Carolina), Chairman of the Committee on Honorary Members, joined the Executive Committee and presented the names of six persons for consideration as nominees to be elected Honorary Members of the Association at the annual business meeting. In dis- cussing guidelines for the selection of nominees for Honorary Membership, the consensus of the Executive Committee was that each nominee should in some way be related to SAMLA and its activities as an organization centered in a specific geographical region of the United States. Accordingly, the Executive Committee referred the name of one person suggested for Honorary Member- ship back to the Committee on Honorary Members for further consideration and formally approved the following persons for nomination at the business meeting: Francis Fergusson, John Gotthold Kunstmann, Jesse Stuart, and Eu- dora Welty. The Secretary then reviewed the various stages of preparations for the 1975-78 conventions, and a motion was made, seconded, and unanimously passed authorizing the President to appoint an ad hoc committee to consider possibili- ties for special bicentennial programs and other 1976 convention activities</page><page sequence="50">South Atlantic Bulletin 97 appropriate to the country's bicentennial year and to advise the Executive Committee accordingly. The Secretary was then instructed to explore the possibility of arranging for occasional joint convention meetings of individual sections or discussion circles of SAMLA and one or more of the other regional MLA's. The Secretary was next directed to encourage a consciousness in Association nominating committees of the general desirability of considering equitable representation of types of institutions and geographical areas in the process of selecting nominees for election as SAMLA executive and group officers. Since there was no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:00 a.m. EDWARD W. BRATrON, Executive Secretary. BUSINESS MEETING The Business Meeting of the forty-fourth annual meeting of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association came to order at 8:40 a.m. on Saturday, November 2, 1974, in the International Ballroom-East of the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D. C. President Douglas F. Bub presided. As the first order of business, the minutes of the Business Meeting of the forty-third annual meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, were approved as published in the South Atlantic Bulletin (January, 1974). As the second order of business, the report of the Executive Secretary for the year 1973-74 was accepted as read. As the third order of business, both the Treasurer's report and the report of the Auditing Committee for the fiscal year 1973-74 were approved as pre- sented by the Treasurer. The President then expressed appreciation to those accepting appointment to various SAMLA committees during the year and reviewed some recent actions of the Executive Committee. He particularly noted the Committee's concern to achieve a more nearly adequate representation among Association officers of the various types of institutions in the region, especially the four-year colleges. The report of the SAMLA Studies Awards Committee was next officially accepted as presented earlier at the SAMLA luncheon by the Chairman of the Committee, Aubrey Williams (Florida). The report of the SAMLA delegate to the 1974 Southern Humanities Con- ference, Gerald D. Johnson (Alabama), was then accepted as read. As the next order of business, Ashley Brown (South Carolina), Chairman of the Committee on Honorary Members, reviewed the criteria and procedures employed by that Committee in selecting nominees for election as honorary members of the Association. Professor Brown reported the names of six persons originally considered by the Committee, indicating the four approved for nomi- nation by the Executive Committee and one referred to the Committee on Honorary Members for further consideration. A motion was then made, sec- onded, and unanimously passed stating the sense of the meeting to be that the name of the sixth person also be referred to the Committee for further con- sideration. The following persons were then formally nominated and elected honorary members of SAMLA by acclamation: Francis Fergusson, John Gotthold Kunstmann, Jesse Stuart, and Eudora Welty. As the next order of business, Anne Baecker rose as member of the Nomi- nating Committee and presented the following slate of nominees: for President, Robert L. Kellogg (Virginia); for Vice President, Joseph L. Allaire (Florida State); for the Executive Committee with terms expiring in 1977: Robert Bell</page><page sequence="51">98 Meeting (Alabama) and Rayburn Moore (Georgia). There were no nominations from the floor, and the slate was elected by acclamation. Since there was no further business, the newly elected President was invited forward and adjourned the meeting at 9:15 a.m. EDWARD W. BRATrON, Executive Secretary. AWARDS COMMITTEE The eighth annual competition for the Modern Language and Literature Studies Award of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association was held in 1973-74.

PHILLIP A. CRANT, GEORGE HARPER, WILLIAM MACBAIN, PHILLIP H. RHEIN, EGBERT KRISPYN, Chairman. SOUTHERN HUMANITIES CONFERENCE The twenty-seventh meeting of the Southern Humanities Conference was held at the Continuing Education Center on the campus of the University of Alabama at 1 uscaloosa on April 25-27. Presiding was Professor Clyde Williams of Mississippi State University. Reports and discussions at the conference reflected the current concern of academic humanists about the role of their discipline in a time of tight money and shifting priorities. Dean Oscar C. Page of Wesleyan College, Macon, Georgia, struck what proved to be the key-note of the conference in his opening state- ments as moderator of the Friday afternoon session. Unless the humanities, he stated, revise and reform their curricula, methods of teaching, and ways of reaching people outside the academies, they will continue to suffer failing en- rollments and loss of status in a time in which the highest priority is being placed on 'goal-oriented" education. The Friday afternoon and Saturday morning sessions addressed themselves to this challenge and suggested two ways of confronting it. The first of these might be called "out-reach"-ways of establishing contact with the adult popula- tion outside the traditional purviews of the academic humanist. The aim of such contact is to demonstrate to these people that humanistic methods and concerns bear upon the decision making processes and problems of identity at all levels of human interaction. In this endeavor, the universities may be assisted by the National Endowment of the Humanities, which, through its State-Based Endowment Programs, offers matching funds to implement innova- tive proposals bringing together humanists and the public. Such endowment programs are already underway in Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee, and a program has recently been initiated in Alabama. The confer- ence heard full reports on the Georgia program, presented by Dr. Richard Wie- gand, Director of Continuing Education at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and on the Mississippi program by Dr. John K. Bettersworth, Vice-President and Dean of the Faculty at Mississippi State University. Briefer reports were given by Dr. Austin Hyde and Dr. Jim Noel on the North Carolina program and by Ms. Jane Crater on the Tennessee program. According to Dr. Wiegand, during the three years since its inception, the Georgia Screening Committee has read over 200 proposals from the various institutions in the state and some fifty have been funded. As an example of a successful proposal, Dr. Wiegand mentioned a program on race relations sponsored by Valdosta College. This program, which was granted $1,885, consisted of the performance of a play by Jean-Paul Sartre as a springboard for an open discussion on race relations by an integrated audi- ence. 376 people, 60% white, 40% black, attended the performances. According to Dr. Noel, the North Carolina Program achieved a significant success with its Johnston County Forum, which was a series of public forums held in Smith- field, a community that is rapidly declining in population. Smithfield originated the forum by requesting a "professor in residence" from Duke University. This professor helped the citizens to focus and articulate their concerns about their</page><page sequence="53">100 Meeting community in a time of transition. Since then, this "professor in residence" service has been extended to other outlying sections of the state. The theme of the Saturday morning session was actually stated by the speaker at the Friday evening banquet. This was Dr. Blaine Brownell, Assistant Professor of History and American Studies at Purdue University and Associate Editor of The Journal of Urban History. Dr. Brownell is shortly to become director of Urban Studies at the University of Alabama in Birmingham; and, in his address, he outlined an interdisciplinary curriculum that would engage scientists and humanists in Urban Studies. Curriculum revision and reform, moving specifically towards interdisciplinary programs, was the topic of the Saturday morning session. The conference heard reports from Professors Gregory Ulmer and Stephen McKnight of the Univer- sity of Florida and Professor Patrick E. Green, Chairman of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. The Florida program used an NEH planning grant to establish a Center for Human Studies. This center, which is staffed by professors with dual appointments in Humani- ties and various specialties, offers team-taught interdisciplinary courses and other special topic courses, such as humanities in medicine. According to Professor Green, the University of Alabama, which only recently received a $30,000 plan- ning grant from NEH, is still working on its curriculum. It will, he suggested, resemble slightly the program at the University of Denver, which attempts to avoid the broad survey approach by allowing students to choose a particular period (e.g. "Fifteenth-Century Florence") and immerse themselves totally in that period, studying the language, the men, the literature, music, and art. The University of Alabama program will include basic courses in the Western, Eastern, and American Experiences. The theme will be "The Modern and Post-Modern Mind" and the focus will be on a set of ideas. From the basic courses, the student will select a culture other than his own, a period other than his own, and an issue of his time. In closing, the conference elected the following as officers for next year: Leah Strong, Wesleyan College, Chairwoman; Thomas McHaney, Georgia State University, Vice-Chairman; L. Charles Stagg, Memphis State University, Secre- tary-Treasurer; Patrick Hogan, University of Houston, member of the executive committee. The twenty-eighth annual meeting will be held in Memphis. GERALD D. JOHNSON, Delegate. * * * * Resurrection of the Body: Apocalypse in Hermann Hesse and Norman 0. Brown-JOSEPH K. DAVIS, University of Southern Mississippi. Herman Hesse and Norman 0. Brown confirm the proposition that the human body is the problem today in the individual's quest for an integrated wholeness of Self. In Steppenwolf Hesse's hero (or anti-hero) Harry Haller cannot overcome his socially condi- tioned morality and accept Hermine, his feminine counterpart, thus integrating her into his total life. In Love's Body Brown argues that only a resurrected body-one in which Eros is supreme and life-and-death are experienced without repression and anxiety -is likely to permit the continuation of the human race.</page></plain_text>
