<plain_text><page sequence="1">PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTES ON THE THEORY OF ART AS PLAY CATHERINE RAU The play theory of art is dismissed by contemporary writers on aesthetics with more or less disfavor. To cite two examples-Professor Ducasse, in The Philosophy of Art,' finds it inadequate; and Professors Gilbert and Kuhn, in their History of Esthetics,2 suggest that it is confused and absurd. The present essay argues for the thesis that, though these judgments are justified by the historical statements of the play theory, this view of art nevertheless deserves careful con- sideration, for it could be fruitfully developed with the aid of recent psycholog- ical findings. A summary and analysis of the views of three of the principal play theorists are herein offered; and suggestions are made as to some sources of light in contemporary psychology. The theory of art as play was proposed by Schiller, as everyone knows, in Letters on the Aesthetical Education of Man. He mixes up metaphysics and an- thropology in a way which has fortunately gone out of fashion. The transcen- dental speculation is here left out of account since the interest of the present essay is exclusively empirical. It seems likely that the entanglement with meta- physical speculation has impeded the development of the theory. Schiller finds play running through all of animate nature; animals and plants display more energy than is necessary to maintain life. When the lion is not driven by hunger, and when no other beast provokes him to fight, he expends his superabundant energy, without an object, for the sheer pleasure of doing so; he fills the desert with his roars. Insects flit about aimlessly in the sunlight, and birds sometimes sing from no need (so Schiller believes). This overflowing animal energy is free from any specific external necessity though still under the general constraint to expend itself. An animal works when privation drives it to action; it plays when surplus energy causes it to act. Even plants show an excess of life, for they grow and produce seeds more abundantly than the preservation of the individual and the species requires (Letter XXVII). Man, Schiller continues, not content with satisfying his physical needs, de- mands the superfluous. At first interested only in matter, he piles up provisions for future use. His enjoyment, though greater, is not different in kind; he has not yet risen above animal life. But when he becomes interested in the forms of the objects which satisfy his needs, then he begins to enjoy beauty; his pleas- ure has become higher in kind as well as greater in extent and intensity. When he begins to prefer form to matter, humanity has appeared in him (Letter XXVII). Schiller's concept of play has to do with superabundance, sometimes of en- ergy, sometimes of material possessions such as food, clothing and implements. He has in fact two notions of play, each of which opposes it to work; and work 1 C. J. Ducasse, The Philosophy of Art (Dial Press, New York, 1929), Ch. VII, pp. 95-109. 2 K. E. Gilbert and H.

On the one hand, he calls "play" the laying up of provisions for future needs. Now if "wrork" is the name of any activity which is directed toward gratifying a present need, then, by defi- nition, providing for future needs is not work. And if any activity which is not work is play, then making provision for the future can be named "play." But this is an unaccustomed and confusing use of the terms. On the other hand, Schiller conceives of play as the gratuitous expenditure of surplus animal en- ergy, i.e. of energy which is not utilized at the moment in meeting any demand of the organism or its environment. Examination of this second concept of play is deferred till after the summary of Spencer's views, for he makes extensive use of it. Schiller observes that man's imagination plays just as his body does. He holds that, in its early stages, the play of fancy is blind animal impulse rejoicing in its power and freedom; it is purely material; it is an arbitrary succession of im- ages ungoverned by form. When the imagination at length attempts to create form, it passes in one leap to aesthetic play. Schiller makes a useful point in ob- serving that man's imagination plays as well as his body. His account of play is superior in this respect to Spencer's. Schiller takes the flow of images in fan- tasy to be arbitrary; but psychologists have demonstrated repeatedly that it is neither arbitrary nor haphazard. There is conclusive evidence that daydreaming is motivated, just as nightdreaming is. Schiller shows keen insight in his appre- ciation of the "leap" of the imagination from fantasy to art. The "leap" is ac- complished by the attempt to create form, that is, by self-imposed discipline. The gravest inadequacy of Schiller's view is his failure to distinguish the pro- duction of art from the contemplation of it, i.e. artistic creation from aesthetic experience. This defection renders his account confused and, indeed, superficial. As this same objection is to be brought against Spencer's treatment of art, dis- cussion of this point will be deferred. Spencer, in The Principles of Psychology,3 offers the following account of the aesthetic activities. Play and the aesthetic activities are alike in that neither subserve directly the processes of life. The bodily and mental faculties in their primary action, besides finding immediate gratification, have the ultimate aim of maintaining the individual or the species; whereas the playful and aesthetic activities of the faculties yield as their only benefits the immediate gratifications which they give; they serve no ulterior end. Play and the aesthetic activities do, of course, increase the power of the faculties which they exercise and thus in- directly further life; but this effect they share with the primary exercise of the faculties (?533). Animals low in the evolutionary scale utilize all their energy in maintaining life; but higher animals, i.e. those with more numerous and more efficient fac- ulties, do not find it necessary to expend all their energy in satisfying their im- mediate needs. An organ, when inactive for a time longer than required for nor- mal rest, becomes unusually ready to act and to have its "correlative feelings" aroused; and it is in these circumstances that desire arises in consciousness. When the real activity of an organ is not needed, the organ readily discharges its en- 3H. Spencer, The Principles of Psychology (Appleton, New York, 1898), Part IX, Ch. IX, pp. 627-648.</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTES ON THEORY OF ART AS PLAY 231 ergy in simulation of that activity. This is play. All faculties play, from the lowest to the highest; and those faculties most important in sustaining life play most. Although any superfluous exercise of the faculties is play in a broad sense, it is more properly play when there is a conscious accompaniment of feeling (?534). The play of predatory animals such as dogs, cats and human beings is clearly mimic hunting and fighting. The games of skill of both children and adults offer the satisfaction of conquering an antagonist; victory at chess, for example, is a substitute for "ruder" victories. Spencer makes a penetrating remark on wit; he finds it characterized by the effort to dominate the listener. He continues that what is the case for the bodily faculties and destructive impulses holds also for all the other faculties: their organs store up energy which is discharged in ideal or artificial action when the real or natural action is not required. Thus the higher faculties, as well as the lower ones, come to be exercised for immediate gratification without ulterior aim; the aesthetic activities are the substitute ex- ercise of the higher faculties, as games are the substitute exercise of the lower ones (?534). It will be remembered that, for the doctrine of evolution, the higher organisms and faculties are the more complex ones, while the lower ones are the less com- plex. Spencer's principle for differentiating aesthetic activities from play is so vague as to be only very roughly applicable; it is moreover of doubtful validity. For example, playing tennis obviously requires a far higher degree of muscular coordination than painting a picture does; yet Spencer would call the former "play"; and the latter, "aesthetic activity." Spencer does not labor under Schiller's biological innocence, yet both his psy- chology and physiology are very obviously inadequate. He is thinking in terms of the activities of organs, not in terms of the behavior of the whole organism; that is, his concepts are molecular, not molar as they need to be on the psycho- logical level. With apologies to William James, this may be called "vicious physiologism." Drive-psychology furnishes a more serviceable concept: that of the total organism mobilized to serve a drive which has become dominant. More- over Spencer is making some untested physiological assumptions in declaring that the faculties most important in sustaining life play most. Which faculties are most important; those of the heart, the brain, the lungs or the digestive tract? He seems to be making a very hasty generalization. There is vicious physiologism also in his assumption that needs are exclusively somatic. It is, of course, a commonplace of contemporary psychology that there are viscerogenic needs and psychogenic needs, and that the former are often neglected for the sake of satisfying the latter. Spencer does indeed distinguish mental, or "higher," faculties from bodily, or "lower," ones; but he reduces psychic needs to a somatic status by his explanation that the organs of the mental faculties store up energy which is discharged in ideal activity when their real activity is not required. (And this is aesthetic activity.) He does not recognize play of the imagination qua imagination as Schiller does. This failure, a symptom of Spencer's inability to grasp the very nature of art, renders his whole account shallow and trivial. The assumption that needs are exclusively somatic leads to the Schiller-Spencer</page><page sequence="4">232 CATHERINE RAU theory of play as expenditure of surplus energy, and to the opposition of play and work. But this is not an adequate account of play. It is a fact among others clear to psychologists that both play and art give substitute satisfaction to many and diverse needs and drives when these latter cannot obtain their "real" satis- faction; hence a significant opposition for the play theory of art is not that between play and work, but rather that between play and reality. It is indeed a biological function of play to "blow off" surplus energy, but this is only one of its functions and perhaps a relatively unimportant one as compared to the ob- taining of substitute gratifications. In this case, its function is to maintain the stability of the animal organism by finding outlets for its drives. It is here suggested that the various versions of the play theory of art hereto- fore proposed are inadequate, not because art has little in common with play, but because no adequate concept of play has been used by aestheticians. Both advocates and critics of the play theory have committed the fallacy of exclusive particularity; assuming that there is only one sort of activity which can properly be called "play," they have ignored or rejected all other activities usually so-called. Obviously there is not just one thing called "play"-as there is not just one thing called "art." Play is whatever is called "play." It is always arbi- trary to adopt any one usage of the term to the exclusion of all others; and the choice is justifiable and undogmatic only when it is consciously arbitrary and made for a strictly specified purpose. If Spencer had not been so preoccupied with stressing the fact that play does not serve the life-processes directly, he might have seen that it gives them in- dispensable service indirectly, that it does have an ulterior end. He was at least started on the track of an adequate concept of play in his recognition of the mimic victories of games. But his insight was blocked by his assumption that an animal plays only with surplus energy when its "real" activity is not needed; what he did not perceive is that animals, especially human animals, resort to play when the real objects of their needs are not available. Spencer, like Schiller, fails to distinguish the production of art from the con- templation of it. This confusion of art creation and aesthetic experience renders his whole discussion loose and vague. As an account of aesthetic contemplation, Spencer's theory is a pleasure theory such as Professor Santayana's4 or David Prall's,5 with this in particular: the aesthetic experience is held to be possible only with excess energy. If this is to say that we can enjoy objects aesthetically only when our somatic needs are not insistent, it is a psychological truism. It clearly is not the case that an overflow of energy is necessary for achieving aesthetic pleasure. As an account of art creation, the Schiller-Spencer theory scarcely begins to take cognizance of the facts; it is based upon no serious obser- vation or experiment. Karl Groos, in The Play of Animals6 (Ch. I) and in The Play of Many (part III, Section 1), criticizes the Schiller-Spencer theory, pointing out that surplus 'G.

Baldwin (Appleton, New York, 1914).</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTES ON THEORY OF ART AS PLAY 233 energy, though a favorable condition for play, is not a necessary one. He asks why each species of animal has its own kind of play. The overflow of energy cannot account for this fact. He finds the explanation of play in instinct, main- tainingf that instinct is the source of play, though not all play is purely instinc- tive. Instinct is "a power in itself" which does not need surplus energy. An ap- propriate stimulus is all that is required to set an animal in motion; for example, a kitten will pounce upon a rolling ball just as a mature cat will go for a mouse. Groos points out that instinct operates even in a state of fatigue, even to exhaus- tion; and he gives examples from the play of puppies, children and adults. He sets forth his concept of instinct at some length (The Play of Animals, Ch. II; The Play of Man, Part III, Section 2). All animals have innate capacities necessary for the preservation of the species. In many animals, these capacities are highly developed complex acts, or instincts, originated by hereditary brain tracts. He excludes the question as to whether instinctive acts are conscious as either unanswerable or unimportant. He continues that a given act may be partly instinctive and partly voluntary; this consideration is important for play. Since in higher animals, and especially in man, the instincts are "imper- fectly prepared," practice is necessary to perfect them; hence the play of man and animals during youth, which is a period of learning. He maintains that the biological function of play is to fit the animal for its "life duties"; it affords practice and exercise for the activities necessary to survival. He finds the imita- tive impulse to be a hereditary "faculty" similar to instinct and closely connected with it, but more complicated and flexible; imitation is most useful to the higher animals in that it supplements instinct by individual acquirements, thus favor- ing the development of intelligence; furthermore imitation is the very condition of race heritage and tradition. He insists that there is not a single and particular impulse to play, as Schiller held; but rather that there are various instincts which are given practice in play before their serious exercise is required, and thus they become special forms of play. Groos's notion of instinct is much wider and vaguer than our present concept; it is so wide that it is a screen for wholesale tautology. As everyone now under- stands, when animals are declared to have an instinct for hunting, an instinct for fighting, an instinct for imitation, all that is being said is that they do hunt, they do fight, they do imitate each other. The notion of instinct has been dis- carded except for the limited case of a behavior sequence not modifiable by learning; hence it does not provide a principle for "explaining" play. Here again, drive-psychology offers more serviceable though as yet not clear or com- plete concepts; and by application of these concepts, Groos's theory could be revised and sharpened. Where he says that young animals of many species play at hunting because they have the instinct to hunt, a contemporary psychologist would say that they do hunt, and that their hunting activity can satisfy a vari- etv of needs: hunger, aggression, dominance, sadism, vanity, desire for social approval, etc. And the differences in kinds of play between one animal species and another can be accounted for precisely by the differences of organic struc- ture; for example, kittens play with their claws because they have claws. The question of the biological functions of playr is not one to be answered by</page><page sequence="6">234 CATHERINE RAU aestheticians, or even by psychologists; it is best left to biologists. The various activities usually called "play" obviously fulfill various functions, of which expending surplus energy and finding substitute satisfactions have already been mentioned. Groos maintains that practicing life-sustaining activities is the bio- logical function of play; but it is dogmatic and arbitrary to choose any one as the function. He concedes that play provides recreation; he overlooks the facts that it also staves off boredom and, more importantly, gives opportunities for vigorous emotional discharge. The list could be lengthened considerably. Groos assumes (The Play of Animals, pp. 81 and 287) that, if the play of young animals can be explained, the play of adults can be; for all "genuine" play is at first youthful. Of course, the same explanation might be found for both youthful and mature play; but, on the other hand, play in successive periods of life might differ totally in nature. Only long and careful observation can discover the facts. All play is at first youthful in the sense that every animal, as the world now goes, is young before it is old. Groos asserts that adult animals play be- cause they remember the pleasure of past play. Though he grants that the sur- plus energy theory may apply to mature play, he finds the experience of pleasure given by play to be the important factor. His meaning is not clear, but he is probably saying that most of adult play is merely repetition of youthful play. This is, at least, what his view of play as practice for "life duties" requires; however, it is obviously not an adequate account of many adult activities called "play," e.g. bridge or roulette. Or he might mean that the aim or motive of adult play is pleasure; but this is clearly false psychologically. Groos repeatedly defines play as conscious practice of an instinct purely for pleasure. The activity ceases to be play in the following cases: when it becomes automatic (The Play of Man, p. 82); when rules are set up and the sport is taken seriously (op. cit., pp. 120-121); when an external aim is superadded to the play, e.g. earning one's living thereby; or when the technique of the activity is acquired by systematic effort (op. cit., p. 140). Having defined play as pleasurable exercise of an instinct or impulse, Groos tries (The Play of Animals, Chs. III and IV; The Play of Man, Parts I and II) to fit to this bed of Procrustes nearly everything that children and young animals do and much that adults do, excepting always the securing of food or a sex partner. He includes in the class of play such diverse activities as random movements of the limbs, enjoyment of sensory stimuli, learning to walk, swim or fly, tearing up or smashing objects, building or making things, mimic hunting and fighting, daydreaming, curiosity (which he construes as play of attention), playing chess, solving puzzles and wit as plays of "reason,") quiet endurance of pain as experimentation with will power, gambling, folk festivals including feasting and dancing, all art production when engaged in for its own sake without external aim, and even courtship, though he doubts that courtship is genuine play of youth (The Play of Animals, pp. 248-250; The Play of Man, pp. 253-254) since the acts, performed in actual exercise of an instinct, are serious means to a real end. He concludes that love play is merely similar to play but is not truly play. In setting up and appiying his definition of play, Groos falls into the old and</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTES ON THEORY OF ART AS PLAY 235 treacherous pitfall of hypostatization: he assumes that, because one word is used to name many and diverse activities of human beings and animals, these activi- ties have some character or property in common, which common character or property is the essence of play, distinguishing "true" or "genuine" play from its analogues and semblances. Moreover he frequently concludes without grounds that a given animal activity, such as the swarming of insects or the darting about of fish (The Play of Animals, Ch. III, Section 2) or the adopting of the young of other animals (op. cit., Ch. III, Section 6), is playful (i.e. accompanied by conscious pleasure). In regard to the habit of rats and certain birds of collect- ing bright objects, he remarks that, if no other explanation can be found, it must be play (op. cit., p. 157); and he gives examples of dogs howling in response to music as cases of imitation of human singing (op. cit., pp. 188-189). His ani- mals are often disconcertingly anthropomorphic. On the whole, his data are defective, being derived mostly from chance observations or literary anecdotes, though his method is admirably thorough and detailed. Furthermore, his anti- quated faculty psychology leads him to such pernicious oversimplification as subdividing mental play into play of the intellect, play of the feelings and play of the will. The defects just noted are not, however, inherent in his play theory per se, but are merely weaknesses of human nature. Groos proceeds to a discussion of the psychic accompaniments of play, where he is on speculative rather than empirical ground, and where his theorizing be- comes more or less arbitrary (The Play of Animals, Ch. V; The Play of Man, Part III, Section 3). He finds that play develops gradually from mere reflex actions through attempts at muscle coordinations to the make-believe of games and finally to art, where the shamming is fully developed and completely con- scious, for the artist is playing a role. For him all play is accompanied by pleasure. He distinguishes a primary pleasure given by the satisfaction of instinct, and a further pleasure derived from the exercise of power. This "joy in being a cause" is experienced in control- ling our own bodies, external objects and other animals; it is given by victory in the struggle for supremacy and by exercise of skill; its ultimate form is found in play ing a role. This two-fold pleasure is, according to him, the indispensable psychic condition of play; and artistic production is play and remains play as long as the artist enjoys it for its own sake; when he makes it a serious business, or when he acquires an external aim, art ceases to be play. It is by now common psychological knowledge that not all activities usually called "play" are pleasant in the sense of being fun, as Groos takes them to be. A clear example of his mistake is to be found in the section entitled "Love Play in Art" in The Play of Man (pp. 268-278). Here, though he shows insight into the processes of sublimation and substitution (he does not use the terms), he construes the expression of sex in art as playing with the instinct merely for fun. Recent psychological findings3 and, indeed, everyday experience point clearly S The literature is extensive. For those who do not have time to explore the field, R. H. Alschuler and L. W. Hattwick: Painting and Personality (University of Chicago Press, 1947), will give an adequate notion of the work which is being done.</page><page sequence="8">236 CATHERINE RAU to the fact that children are often unhappy in their play, especially in solitary play. Less extensive studies have been made of adults,9 but they appear to be in the same case. A theory which attempts to account for all the activities which Groos calls "play" must be broader than his and reoriented in respect to pleas- ure; it must take cognizance of the fact that, though many play activities are fun, many others are motivated by frustration and fear. But on the other hand, a theory which defines play as pleasurable by nature must be much narrower than Groos's. "Joy in being a cause" is not a peculiar mark of play; indeed hard work and even desperate struggle can be rewarded by the satisfaction of accomplishment. The matter could be settled by definition, and any activity attended by this satisfaction could be called "play." But then some work would have to be called "play." This would violate common linguistic usage, and furthermore, the defi- nition would add nothing to our knowledge of the phenomena under consid- eration. Groos points out that the shamming of play has a close relation to artistic invention (The Play of Animals, Ch. V; The Play of Man, Part III, Section 3). He maintains that the artist, in producing a work of art, is creating an illusion; the spectator enjoying the work of art is aware of the illusion yet surrenders to it, i.e. he enjoys it. He recognizes himself as cause of the pretense, and this exercise of power gives him, too, the "joy in being a cause." Groos adds that man is free when he plays, for he himself creates his illusion; thus "joy in being a cause" culminates in the highest and noblest of pleasures, the love of freedom. And Groos asserts that, in the world of illusion (i.e. of play and art), man is re- leased from the necessity for work and the pressure of anxiety. This last assertion puts him in danger of giving his biological gains back to the surplus-energy theorists; but, if one disregards it as the slip which it probably is, one must ask in what sense we can be said to be free when we play. Groos is very vague in this matter, but he seems to take freedom in the sense of complete self-determi- nation. The only psychologically plausible answer is that we are free when we play in the same way in which we are said to be morally free: we are doing what we want, not what others want us to do; we are motivated by our own desires rather than by external pressures. Perhaps the only character common to all kinds of children's play is that it is free from the demands of adults. But we are clearly not free from internal necessity; we are not free to choose our own desires or to escape from our needs and anxieties. In fantasy we do indeed create our own illusions, but they are the illusions which gratify our wishes and allay our fears. Whereas in traditional German aesthetics the illusion theory of art remains vague, Groos attempts to give it precision with the help of the doctrine of em- pathy; he makes the content of the artistic illusion the inner imitation of, or sympathetic identification with, the object (The Play of Man, Part III, Section 4). He repeatedly declares the aesthetic experience, whether of art or nature, to be essentially emphatic (The Play of Animals, pp. 162, 222-224; The Play of Man, 9 The literature is considerable here, too. H. A. Murray et al.: Explorationsin Personality (Oxford, New York, 1938), Ch. VI, Section 21, is one of the important contributions to it.</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTES ON THEORY OF ART AS PLAT 237 pp. 31, 234, 247-252). He moreover gives a summary of the doctrine of empathy as it stood at the end of the nineteenth century (The Play of Man, pp. 322-333). And he discusses imagination as the illusion-making capacity, indispensable for enjoyment of art and aesthetic contemplation of nature, distinguishing it from imagination as the power to transform the memory content (op. cit., pp. 131-144, 290). But, since empathy lies beyond the scope of the present essay, it may be dismissed without comment. Though Groos clearly distinguishes artistic production from aesthetic con- templation, he interprets them both as forms of play (op. cit., Part III, Section 4). To a casual eye, play and the production of art appear very much alike, while the aesthetic experience seems different from both. Groos reverses the perspec- tive: for his pleasure theory, the similarities between play and aesthetic enjoy- ment are the closer. He explains that all sense organs have impulses to activity, and that pleasure experienced in the satisfaction of impulse is the basis of play. Now aesthetic pleasure is connected with sense perception. Observation for its own sake he interprets as playful use of the senses; and this is the lowest form of aesthetic experience. But aesthetic enjoyment is more than sense play, he hastens to add, for higher psychic powers are active in the "inner imitation" which characterizes it; aesthetic enjoyment transcends (but does not exclude) play by its moral elevation and profundity of insight into life. He gives his rea- sons for considering the relations between play and the production of art less close than between play and the enjoyment of art. Almost always, art is the serious business of the artist, preoccupying him exclusively; art requires tech- nical skill, the acquisition of which is far from playful; the aim of the artist is to achieve recognition and admiration, or to exert influence upon others; and these aims are foreign to play. The relations between production of art and aesthetic contemplation require far more careful and detailed investigation than Groos was able to give them. To resolve the problems which confront us here, we will have to make much more extensive use of anthropological and sociological data than he did; and our psychology as it is today is not yet adequate to the task. Repeatedly in The Play of Man, Groos points out and emphasizes the continui- ties from childish play to adult art, and the similarities between children's art and the art of primitive peoples and savages. He notes the progression from the voice play of infants to fully developed poetry (pp. 31-41), from the sound play of children and even of animals to modem instrumental music (pp. 41-46), from the hopping and skipping of children to social and exhibition dancing or the complicated dance rituals of savages (pp. 88-92), from childish fantasy to literary fiction (pp. 131-144), from children's dramatic imitation of their parents, ani- mals, machines, etc., to professional drama (pp. 300-313) and from the crude drawing and modeling of children and savages to painting and sculpture (pp. 313-322). No one at present would undertake to deny that children's painting, drawing and clay modeling are continuous with adult activities of the same sort; but it is not so obvious that childish dramatic play is of the same nature as adult drama. Here Groos is making most useful observations. Poetry, stories and music are produced in large quantities by adults for consumption by chil-</page><page sequence="10">238 CATHERINE RAU dren; but, as everyone who has worked with groups of children knows, if they are left to their own devices in these fields, their inventiveness is inexhaustible. Juvenile art differs from mature art only in lacking technical skill, self-conscious purpose and general experience of life. As Schiller pointed out, art is subjected to discipline, whereas play is not. Groos makes what is perhaps his most important contribution to the theory of art as play by taking play seriously. Not all play is trifling or dalliance; it is not mere fun; much so-called play is earnest and creative. It is always important biologically and sociologically.</page></plain_text>
