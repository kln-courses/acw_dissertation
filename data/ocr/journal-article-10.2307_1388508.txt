LEDYARD STEBBINS Department of Genetics University of California Davis, California More than any other period in the history of mankind, ours is a time of change. Among the welter of ideas and theories about modern society and where it is going, this one truism, above all, stands unchallenged. Anybody who has lived for half a century or even less is so personally aware of this change that it is bound to have a strong in- fluence on his entire outlook toward life. A biologist in this modern world, whose thoughts are centered almost en- tirely about either his personal affairs, those of the body politic around him, or about the nature of the living world outside of man, cannot help making constant comparisons and analogies between social change and those changes in populations of animals, plants, and microorganisms which, following Darwin, he has learned to call evolution. Are these comparisons and analogies nothing but an interesting parlor game, useless and misleading to anyone who is seriously studying the nature and future prospects of mod- em society, or can at least some of them be used to give us a deeper insight into the trends of social change? This is the question which I shall try to answer in this paper. In previous discussions of this subject with anthro- pologists and sociologists, the strongest impression I have gained is of the misconceptions which are widely, perhaps generally, held about the nature and course of organic evolution. The words "evolution" and "evolutionism" are often used in a derogatory sense, and refer to the belief that human culture has changed in a linear and progres- sive fashion, with many close parallels between the course of evolution of entire cultures in different parts of the earth. The idea that cultures have evolved progressively toward what we call civilization, and that one function of anthropologists and sociologists is to classify each culture into one of several progressive stages of this evolution, was being developed simultaneously with Darwin's studies on the evolution of the organic world. These two ideas of organic and cultural evolution became inevitably in- terwoven shortly after the publication of the Origin of Species. With the dawn of the twentieth century, both organic evolution and cultural change began to be ap- proached in a more pragmatic and objective fashion. Con- sequently, in both fields, the excesses of generalization committed by the previous generation of scientists became increasingly apparent. Biologists of the twentieth century distrusted more and more, the "phylogenetic trees" which their forbears had erected in order to place in a supposed evolutionary succession, the various modern phyla, orders, and families of plants and animals. Anthropologists and sociologists discarded completely the concept of "cultural stages," and many of them spoke only of diversity and change, rejecting completely any implication that cultures advanced or regressed as wholes during the time of man's existence on the earth. Moreover, they did not associate organic evolution with the experimental studies of evolu- tionary processes, which began in 1900 with deVries' dis- covery of mutations and the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of heredity, and which now dominate scientific research on the evolution of contemporary organisms. They were more familiar with the descriptive and speculative phylo- genetic comparisons which were in vogue among biologists of the previous generation, but which were being looked upon with increasing skepticism by the new generation of biologists. Many contemporary students of human culture, such as Steward' and Hallowell2 use the concept of evolution in much the same way as do modern biologists. The view- point to which they adhere, and which I shall now sum- marize, is often called the modern, synthetic theory of evo- * Paper presented at the annual meetings of the American Socio- logical Association, Montreal, Canada, September 3, 1964. 1 J.

Dobzhansky,4 Sir Julian Huxley,5 and in a series of symposia held in 1959, the centenary of the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species. The most elaborate of these,6 at the University of Chicago, presented discussions of cultural as well as organic evolution. THE MODERN THEORY OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION The modern synthetic theory of organic evolution ac- cepts the occurrence of evolutionary change as a fact, for which the evidence is as strong as it can be for any series of historical events which can never be exactly repeated. Furthermore, the supporters of this theory are reluctant to speculate about the course of evolution, or phylogeny, on the basis of the supposed primitiveness or advancement of modern forms of life. Nearly all modern organisms are specialized in at least some respects, and in groups of which the fossil record is reasonably good, the extinct probable ancestor of any two or more modern groups looks so different from its contemporary descendants that its nature could not have possibly been reconstructed solely from comparisons between these descendants, without ref- erence to fossils of extinct types. Since, however, most of the analogies made in the past between organic and cul- tural evolution have been phylogenetic in nature, a sum- mary of the present opinions of biologists and particularly paleontologists about the course of evolution is needed as an introduction to the present topic. As seen from the fossil record of those organisms in which it is most complete, particularly the vertebrates and molluscs, the course of evolution is better described as a succession of adaptive radiations into different habitats and different ways of exploiting similar habitats, than as a steady progress toward a particular goal. Let us look, for instance, at some of the major features of the evolution of vertebrates. During the Devonian Period, about 300 million years ago, the earliest fishes and their relatives radiated into a variety of habitats; oceans and lakes, rivers, and small streams. Some became larger and anticipated the evolution of modern sharks, others developed large scales and evolved in the direction of sturgeons, while sev- eral other groups evolved along specialized pathways which led to "blind alleys" and extinction. Two groups of these radiants became adapted to living in shallow, fresh water lakes of tropical and subtropical climates, in which the water often became poor in oxygen and even tended to dry up during seasons of drought. These forms, as fishes, were obviously highly specialized and aberrant. In them, genetic changes, guided by natural selection, fa- vored the acquisition of air pouches or bladders, enabling the fish to gulp in oxygen from the air when that in the water was exhausted. In one group (the Crossopterygians), further adaptation to changes in water level was acquired by the evolution of strong fins by means of which the fish could waddle toward deeper water as its lake was drying up. As the climate became increasingly drier, larger air pouches and stronger fins were favored until the fish could make short journeys over land from one completely dried up lake to another which still contained some water. This was the probable way in which the conquest of the land began. Given the ability to live at least some of the time on land, four-footed animals (amphibians) radiated into a number of ecological niches and ways of exploiting their habitat, but were at first restricted in their ability to do this be- cause they had to lay their eggs and spend their larval life in the water. One of the first of these radiants evolved an egg which contained inside it, protected by a tough outer coat, the liquid medium required for early development of its embryos. This acquisition triggered off a much larger radiation, that of the reptiles, which dominated the earth for 100 million years or more. At an early stage in this second radiation, one of its branch lines consisted of small, tree-living animals with specialized jaws and teeth, and perhaps with warm blood. These gave rise to the mammals, which at a much later date, about 60 million years ago, diversified and radiated to become eventually the various kinds of animals which dominate the earth today. This brief sample of some features of vertebrate evolu- tion can be supplemented by reading Colbert's Evolution of the Vertebrates.7 From it, one can clearly see the pre- dominance of successive patterns of adaptive radiation. Advances in complexity and more efficient ways of exploit- ing the environment were made whenever one particular radiant acquired some special adaptive device, such as lungs, legs and feet, the amniote egg, and warm blood. In a few rare instances an evolutionary line acquired two or three of these specializations which complemented each other. By this means, the descendants of this line advanced to a high level of organization, and radiated anew into various ecological niches by virtue of their more efficient ways of exploiting their environment. From this brief account, one can see that an impression of progressive advancement toward a particular goal can a G. G. Simpson, The Meaning of Evolution, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1949. 4 T.

The impression of progress is dissipated even further when we consider differential rates of evolution, both between dif- ferent groups of organisms, and between different charac- teristics of the same evolving group. For instance, a group of Devonian fishes related to the ancestors of the first land animals acquired a different adaptation to the vagaries of the climate and changes in water level. Possessed of very small, weak fins, they simply increased their tolerance for foul, stagnant water. Some of their descendants acquired the ability to encase themselves in mud and become dor- mant during periods of drought when their lakes dried up. These fishes became adapted to increasing drought by ex- tending their dormant period. After a short evolutionary spurt which adapted them perfectly to this narrow, spe- cialized ecological niche, their rate of evolution slowed down and almost stopped. The modern lungfishes of Africa are hardly different from their ancestors which existed 150 million years ago. When we compare vertebrates with other forms of ani- mals, our impression of steady evolutionary progress to- ward more complex, highly developed forms becomes even further dissipated. We are accustomed to thinking of in- sects as considerably lower forms of life than mammals, particularly man. Yet the amount of change in bodily form and structure which took place in the evolution of insects from their remote one-celled ancestors was certainly as great and probably greater than that of mammals. Fur- thermore, when we study the elaborate instincts and social behavior of bees, ants, and wasps, we realize that their nervous systems are equally highly evolved. The course of evolution from primitive forms of life to man on the one hand and higher insects on the other differed greatly in kind and direction, but little in degree. Even if we define evolution as change in populations of organisms toward greater complexity (a definition which is un- acceptable, as I shall point out) then ants and bees are as highly evolved as we are. When we turn toward the class of insects, however, we recognize that a considerable number of evolutionary lines have not changed toward greater complexity. Fleas, aphids (plant lice), and thrips differ almost as much from the primitive common ancestor of insects as do butterflies and bees. Yet the later evolutionary history of these groups of insects has been one of progressive simplification. Similar lines of evolution toward greater simplicity can be found in many groups of animals and plants, particularly those which have become parasitic. Unequal rates of evolution are equally apparent, both in comparing different groups of insects with each other and in comparisons between insects and mammals. Bees have evolved a tremendous number of diverse types dur- ing the last ten to twenty million years; modern cock- roaches are hardly different from their ancestors of 150 to 200 million years ago. Insects as a whole have evolved relatively little during the past 40 million years; the mar- vellously preserved fossil fauna of insects from the Baltic amber is essentially modern in composition. Yet when these modern insects were inhabiting the forests of north- ern Europe, the mammals of the same fauna were still very primitive. Forms resembling modern cattle, deer, cats, foxes, and horses did not appear until twenty to thirty million years later. We see the same unevenness of evolutionary change when we compare different characteristics in animals be- longing to separate lines of evolution. The head structure of elephants has been greatly modified by evolution, but their legs and feet are far less specialized than those of horses or deer. In nearly every group of animals we can find some organs which are greatly modified and others which have changed much less. The course of evolution as a whole has been devious, uneven, and opportunistic. The fact that the forms of life which now dominate the earth have, on the whole, a more complex organization than those which have preceded them in previous geologic epochs is due not to any evolutionary urge toward greater complexity, but to the fact that certain types of more com- plex structure and behavior enable their bearers to achieve more complete dominance over their environment, both the physical world about them and the other forms of life with which they are associated. The two evolutionists who in recent times have seriously debated the question as to whether or not progress can be recognized in evolutionary change are G. G. Simpson8 and Sir Julian Huxley.9 Simp- son reached the conclusion that progress can be recog- nized only by defining it in anthropomorphic terms. Hux- ley defines progress as evolution toward increasing domi- nance over the environment, both inanimate and living. On the basis of this definition, he regards mankind as the most progressive form of life, since our control over our environment is greater than that possessed by any other organism. ORGANIC EVOLUTION AND SOCIAL CHANGE When we compare this survey of evolutionary change in the animal kingdom with that of social change in hu- 8 Op. cit. 9 Op. cit. Spring, 1965 5</page><page sequence="4">man cultures, such as has been recently discussed by Wil- bert Moore,1o the similarity between the two is obvious. The course of change in human cultures has been devious, uneven, and on the whole opportunistic. In the words of Moore, "The course of change may be gradual or rapid, peaceful or violent, continuous or spasmodic, orderly or erratic.""1 As in organic evolution, the progress in cultural change is not self-evident. It may be defined in ethno- centric terms, i.e., progress toward that particular form of society in which the writer lives, or following Huxley, in terms of greater dominance of man over his environ- ment, including people belonging to different cultural groups. This definition is most likely to be adopted by members of dominant societies. Sahlins12 has developed a most interesting pair of con- cepts which may be applied to organic as well as cultural evolution. He speaks of diversity through adaptive radia- tion as Specific Evolution; and the rise of "higher forms," which he defines, like Huxley, in terms of dominance over their environment, as General Evolution. His diagram to show the relationship between these two phenomena is en- tirely in agreement with the ideas which I am presenting today. THE PROCESS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION AND SOCIAL CHANGE Faced with this undoubted similarity between the course of organic evolution and of social change, we naturally ask ourselves whether an equal resemblance exists between the processes which have brought about organic evolution and those responsible for social change. This question is particularly timely at present, since our knowledge of the dynamics of organic evolution has greatly increased dur- ing the last thirty years. Books and articles published dur- ing the past five years have revealed a remarkable agree- ment among most serious students of evolutionary proc- esses, even though they have been studying very differ- ent groups of organisms from diverse points of view. They agree that the major processes of evolution are known to us; we need no longer search for hidden causes. These major processes are genetic mutations, chromo- somal changes, and genetic recombination, which provide the source of variability; and natural selection and repro- ductive isolation between species, which canalize and di- rect this variability into adaptive systems. In considering these processes, we must emphasize the fact that all of them are equally essential to evolutionary change. Furthermore, they interact with each other in such numerous and complex ways that none of them can be considered separately from the others. Their interrela- tionships can be expressed by the following analogy. We can compare a line of organisms evolving through time to an automobile moving along a highway. The mutations and chromosomal changes can be compared to the gaso- line in the tank. They are the ultimate source of change, but do not contribute directly to it, since most of the mu- tations toward greater adaptive fitness have such small effects by themselves that they are significant only in com- bination with other genes. The mechanisms of Mendelian heredity, which is responsible for genetic recombination, can be compared to the engine, since it provides the direct source of variability which natural selection, through in- teraction between organisms and environment, guides into channels of adaptive fitness. In this analogy, therefore, natural selection can be compared to the driver of the vehicle. Reproductive isolation, a general term applied to a great variety of mechanisms which prevent or restrict successful hybridization between members of different species, may be likened to the highway, with its boun- daries and directive signs, enabling a large number of "vehicles," or evolutionary lines, to follow similar or opposing directions in the same general habitat, without mixing or colliding. Before comparing these processes of organic evolution with those which have guided social change, I must first point out and clarify some widespread misconceptions about the processes of organic evolution, particularly natural selection. Darwin's dramatic phrase "the struggle for existence," has given to many nonbiologists the im- pression that the chief mode of action of natural selection is by direct conflict between the different individuals of a population, which causes the death of the less fit indi- viduals. Even Darwin recognized, however, that this is only one of the numerous ways in which natural selection can act, and modern studies have emphasized increasingly the importance of other ways. Once we recognize that heredity is determined by essentially constant, particulate units, the genes and chromosomes, we realize that the basis of evolutionary change is differential alteration in the frequency of particulate genes rather than of individual genotypes. This places differential reproductive capacity in the key position, rather than differential survival. One of my students, Joshua Lee,'3 performed an experiment with cultivated barley which showed clearly that one va- riety can supplant another through differential fecundity, even though every seed which germinates grows up to an adult plant that bears some seed. If, on a particular plot of ground, equal numbers of plants of two varieties exist initially, but the plants of one variety produce a larger 10o Wilbert Moore, Social Change, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Pren- tice-Hall, 1963. 11 Op. cit., p. 33. 12 M.

The same rule would apply to animal popula- tions, particularly those like many marine fishes which produce enormous numbers of eggs and young, the great bulk of which are destroyed at random. The key to success of such species, and probably of the majority of species of organisms, lies not in direct competition with other organisms, but in developing more efficient ways of con- verting the resources of their environment into growth and reproduction of their kind. A commonplace fact of ecology is that in any biotic community the largest num- ber of individuals and the greatest diversity of species, both of which could be taken as good indices of evolu- tionary success, are possessed by the herbivores, which go quietly about their way, eating, reproducing and avoiding enemies. The competitive carnivores, at the pinnacle of the food chain, are the fewest in number of individuals, and their evolutionary lines have evolved fewer species. In his recent book, Animal Species and Evolution,14 Ernst Mayr presents much evidence to show that an im- portant direction of evolution in many different lines of animals has been toward avoidance of competition with other animals in the same community. These facts show that even if analogies between organic evolution and social change can validly be made, those of Herber Spencer and others, which were the foundation of the so-called "Social Darwinism" of the 19th century, were based upon a mis- conception of the mechanism of organic evolution. Whether or not valid analogies can be made between or- ganic evolution and social change depends largely upon the degree of similarity which exists between the processes governing the two types of change. We must, therefore, ask ourselves whether processes comparable to genetic mu- tation, recombination, natural selection, and reproductive isolation are responsible for social change. The processes are undoubtedly different, but do they have enough char- acteristics in common so that they can be compared? I believe that they do. In social change or cultural evolution, as in organic evo- lution, there are some factors which contribute to variabil- ity and make change possible, as well as others which sort out the possible changes and give direction to them. Varia- bility depends largely upon the invention of new tools, machines, and styles of clothing and architecture, as well as the development of new laws and customs. These proc- esses are comparable to mutation. Transmission of this variability depends upon learning and tradition, while its spread to new cultures depends upon cultural diffusion. These processes are, therefore, comparable to hereditary transmission and gene flow in organic evolution. Selection also operates to effect cultural change, but the analogy with natural selection is indirect. Cultural selection may involve differential survival, but this usually affects whole cultures rather than the indivduals composing them. The more spectacular examples of this are wars and revolutions, but changed conditions of life have probably been the more effective way of favoring the spread of one culture as com- pared to others in the same region. The reduction of the Indian population in parts of temperate North and South America was due much more to their susceptibility to disease and their indability to adapt themselves to the changes produced by European culture, than to defeat in battle. Equally important has been conscious selection of new inventions, laws, or customs, by members of a so- ciety which is changing itself, usually by imitation, follow- ing cultural diffusion. The second method of canalization which operates in organic evolution, reproductive isolation, has no counter- part or at best a feebly developed and temporary substi- tute among the processes of social change. Any member of the human species can potentially mate with any other of the opposite sex. Social barriers exist in most cultures which reduce intercultural unions, but these are never irreversible, as are the barriers of reproductive isolation between species of animals and plants. Barriers to cultural diffusion have sometimes been erected, in the form of physical barriers, like the Great Wall of China, or of cen- sorship and propaganda against foreign ways. These have always been temporary, and present means of communica- tion are likely to reduce their effectiveness more and more as time goes on. On the basis of these similarities and differences be- tween organic evolution and cultural change, what analo- gies should we avoid, and what, if any, can we make that will help us to understand the processes of social change? The first problem is the validity of the analogy implied by designating social change as cultural or social evolu- tion. This has now been done by a number of biologists, particularly Huxley, Dobzhansky, Waddington and the writer, and by such anthropologists and sociologists as White, Steward and Hallowell. Other social scientists have been reluctant to apply the term, largely because of the connotation which it acquired as a result of the specula- tions of 19th century anthropologists and philosophers. I believe that it is justified principally by the striking simi- larity between the course of organic evolution and of social change. Furthermore, the most important events in organic evolution have been the successive appearance of those adaptive systems which have enabled their bearers to exploit their environment in a more complex and ef- ficient way, and thus have increased the independence of 14 Ernst Mayr, Animal Species and Evolution, Cambridge: Har- vard University Press, 1963. Spring, 1965 7</page><page sequence="6">and dominance over the inanimate environment which is one of the most significant characteristics of life as a whole. One cannot deny the fact that during the past 25 thousand years mankind has increased his independence of and dom- inance over his physical environment to a greater degree than has any other evolutionary line of organisms, even over periods of many millions of years. This increase has been accompanied by an almost negligible change in those biological characteristics, such as intelligence, powers of speech, and manual dexterity, which are the basic prere- quisites for it to occur. As a method of increasing domi- nance over the environment, organic evolution has in mankind been replaced by social change or, as I prefer to call it, cultural evolution. In the past, many anthropologists who used the term cultural evolution for change in man's way of life be- lieved that this enabled them to arrange all of the diverse contemporary societies into stages of cultural advance- ment, and on the basis of such seriation to predict the future of cultural systems. Such predictions have not been realized. In addition, a true comparison between the course of organic and of cultural evolution must emphasize the fact that major advances in organic evolution have been so rare and sporadic that no amount of study of those organisms which existed before these major events oc- curred would have made possible their prediction. For instance, if an intelligent being had been transplanted to the world of life existing in the Triassic period, when the reptiles were in their most active stage of adaptive radia- tion, he could not possibly have constructed the body plan and behavioral pattern of a bird or placental mammal, much less have predicted that these classes would, sev- eral million years later, almost completely displace the dominant reptiles. A social scientist who looks to an or- ganic evolutionist to help him predict what will happen to society in the future, is a blind man seeking help from another who is equally blind. THREE ANALOGIES Rather than ending upon this pessimistic note, I should like to conclude by bringing up three analogies which may give better insight into the problems of both organic evo- utionists and sociologists. Two of them have to do with pro- cesses of evolution, the third with its course. The first analogy, suggested by Service15 is called by him the Law of Evolutionary Potential, and deals with the course of evolution. He refers at first to the statement made by a number of biologists, particularly Julian Huxley, that animals with a high degree of specialization cannot give rise to new types. By analogy, he reasons that the more specialized and adapted is a particular culture, the less likely it is to give rise to a new culture with a different, more progressive way of life. According to him, this gen- eralization applies to particular cultural traits, such as writing, as well as to entire cultures. I do not have the necessary knowledge and experience to say whether or not this generalization is sound from the anthropological and sociological point of view. I should like to point out, however, that its biological basis is doubtful if not actually false. Simpson"6 has pointed out that new adaptive types have in many instances arisen from groups which, at the time of their appearance, were among the most advanced and specialized of the then existing types. The lung fish types with strong fins (Cros- sopterygians) which gave rise to the first amphibians, as well as the tree-climbing reptiles (Ictidosaurs) which were the ancestors of mammals are both good examples. The belief, which has been expressed by many evolution- ists, that only generalized forms can give rise to entirely new adaptive types, is apparently based upon comparisons between the probable ancestors of new groups and the later and more specialized descendants of some of their collateral relatives. The second analogy is developed by W. B. Cannon in the last chapter of his book, The Wisdom of the Body.17 An eminent human physiologist, he pointed out in the prin- cipal portion of his book the need of the human body to maintain a steady state or "homeostasis," of its basic func- tions, which may involve the "brain and nerves, the heart, lungs, kidney and spleen, all working cooperatively." In order to maintain this basic stability, the body requires both efficient systems of communication between all of its parts-provided by the blood stream, nervous system, and hormones of the endocrine system-and the ability of each separate organ to change the rate of particular acces- sory reactions which are needed to restore any unbalance of the basic stability which arises when the organism faces various kinds of unusual environments. In the Epilogue of his book, Dr. Cannon makes an analogy between the homeostatic adjustments of the human body and similar adjustments which are needed to maintain the steady state of the body politic. From his analogy he concludes that "the organism suggests that stability is of prime impor- tance (italics of the original). It is more important than economy." Later, he suggests that: "The hope is not un- reasonable that the distress arising from catastrophes can be greatly mitigated, and that suffering due to lack of necessary things which is attendant on great economic fluctuations can be obviated, by carefully planning and by intelligently regulating the processes of production and distribution." A final word of wisdom is that "The main 15 Op. cit., Chapter 5. 16 Op. cit. 17 W. B. Cannon, The Wisdom of the Body, New York: Norton, 1932. 8 Pacific Sociological Review</page><page sequence="7">service of social homeostasis would be to support bodily homeostasis. It would therefore help to release the high- est activities of the nervous system for adventure and achievement. With essential needs secured, the price- less unessentials could be freely sought."18 I understand that this analogy of Dr. Cannon has been much discussed by sociologists, although I have not been able to find specific references to such discussions. I be- lieve that it should be studied carefully by both biologists and sociologists. Perhaps an expansion of it could do much to develop a reasonable philosophy of modern life, and help to ease our apprehensions about the future of the body politic. The final analogy is one about which I have been think- ing for some time. It is based upon an evolutionary prin- ciple which was originally worked out by the English geneticist, C. D. Darlington"9 and which biologists have found to be an increasingly valuable guide to understand- ing the diversity of systems which exist in various groups of plants and animals for achieving genetic stability or variability. This is the principle of compromise between immediate fitness and evolutionary flexibility. In higher animals and plants, with their complex bodily structures and elaborate systems of adaptation, mutation is far too slow and haphazard to serve by itself as a means of pro- viding the necessary variability by which natural selec- tion can enable these organisms to adjust to changing en- vironments. Consequently, all cross fertilizing populations of higher organisms have acquired a large store of con- cealed genetic variability, in the form of recessive genes and gene combinations, which becomes revealed when they are inbred. All of these genes lower the adaptation of the population to its immediate environment, but some of them can contribute toward adjusting the population to rapid changes which it may face in the future. In a few in- stances, populations of flies and hamsters have become ad- justed to seasonal variations in climate by means of alter- nate gene combinations, one of which becomes relatively frequent in summer, and the other in winter or spring. This genetic variability is never completely hidden, and from time to time causes the appearance of inferior individuals, thus lowering the average fitness of the popu- lation. It must be regarded as a sort of genetic insurance, without which evolutionary lines are doomed to eventual extinction. Many groups of organisms have, however, dis- pensed with most or all of this insurance by substituting asexual for sexual reproduction, by various devices which favor inbreeding or self fertilization, or by altering the chromosomal mechanism in such a way that genetic link- age is strongly reinforced, and recombination corres- pondingly diminished. These organisms have also evolved in the direction of shorter life, less complex adjustments to their environment, and particularly to the ability to colonize rapidly unoccupied habitats. Among plants, this reduction of genetic variability, sacrificing evolutionary flexibility for the sake of immediate fitness, is found most commonly in weeds. These plants are highly successful in certain restricted habitats, and many of them have per- sisted for long periods of time, but they are apparently unable to evolve entirely new adaptations to their environ- ment. Their variation patterns are restricted to fluctua- tions about a theme which was already outlined in their cross fertilizing ancestors. If a radical alteration of the environment should occur, they are much more likely to become extinct than to advance toward a new level of evolutionary adaptation. I should like to suggest that societies, like populations of higher organisms, must make a compromise in their cul- tural system between the needs of immediate fitness and those of long term flexibility. As long as the environment of a community is constant, its stability and smooth func- tioning are best maintained if its members adhere to a rigid code of ethics, which have worked in the past. Such a code is easily passed on from one generation to the next. Everyone knows his place, is not worrying either about his position in society or what is in store for himself or his children in the future, and goes contentedly about his as- signed task. Such systems, whether they originate as de- vices for protecting the wealth and power of a ruling class, or as utopias founded by idealists, can succeed only if their environment, cultural and biological as well as physical, remains essentially constant, so that the lead- ers can predict coming events. The eventual disintegration of such societies in the face of changing conditions has occurred so many times as to be a commonplace event in history. Any society which is to remain healthy through such upheavals as the industrial revolution and the atomic rev- olution must take out a certain amount of cultural insur- ance. This should consist of ideas, inventions, and legal or constitutional provisions which may appear to be useless or even harmful in the immediate present, but which may form the basis of rapid adjustment to changed conditions. Furthermore, complex societies in a constantly changing world must value and give credit to those of their mem- bers who are capable of unorthodox thinking, and who by their vision and foresight can produce and make avail- able the components of this cultural insurance. On the other hand, if all members of society are permitted to have an unlimited range of unorthodox thinking and behavior, the homeostatic stability of the body politic will decline, and its functioning will be seriously impaired.
