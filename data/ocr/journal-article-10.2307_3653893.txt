Augustine in The City of God does not deny the reality of the old gods but identifies them as dead heroes or as demons. The power of the old gods was still manifest to the Christians of antiquity; it was their moral worth, not their existence, that was to be challenged. Such an interpretation is not found in Muslim accounts of the Greek gods. For all practical purposes Greek polytheism was entirely dead by the time Is- lam came onto the scene. Indeed, even Arabian polytheism, though still vigor- ous when Muhammad began his prophetic career, died out within three de- cades of the proclamation of Islam. Pious Muslims might be offended by the icons in Christian churches, but the temples of the Greek gods were gone these three centuries or more, their statues broken up and their stones stolen to build churches. The other forms of polytheism with which Islam came into con- tact-Zoroastrianism (the most important), Buddhism, Hinduism, and gnostic religions like Manichaeism and Harranian Sabianism-could rightly be under- stood as forms of monotheism (or dualism). Only the occasional idol temple in some out-of-the-way place-the shrine of the god Zun or Zuir in Zamtndawar in Afghanistan,1 for example-might illustrate pure idol worship, but such in- stitutions were soon destroyed and posed little intellectual challenge. Thus, by the time highly intellectual forms of Islam came into being in the eighth and ninth centuries, there was no real idol-worshipping paganism to oppose. De- spite the uncompromising monotheism of Islam, polytheism aroused little emotion for the generations of Muslims born after the passing of the Prophet's companions. Shirk, polytheism, went on to have a rich history in Islamic thought, but it was idols of the soul, not idols carved from stone and wood, that stirred the imaginations and fears of serious Muslims. The Muslim contact with Greek polytheism was thus not with living pa- gans but with literary allusions in Greek philosophical and scientific texts. In late antiquity philosophy had been the last bastion of paganism, a fortress whose outworks may have been stormed perhaps but whose citadel still held out, manned by doughty and commited fighters like Proclus and Simplicius. But the fortress had at last fallen, and even the ancient philosophers had finally been brought to the baptismal font. The fact that they knew little more than the names of Greek gods was another factor preventing Muslim scholars from taking alarm at Greek polythe- ism. The obvious first question to ask when we examine what Muslims thought of the Greek gods is what they might have known about them. How indeed do we know about Greek religion? Mostly we know mythology from literature: Hesiod, Homer, Greek drama, and manuals of literature and rhetoric. None of 'C. E. Bosworth, The History of the Saffarids of Sistan and the Maliks of Nimruz (Costa Mesa, Calif., 1994), 91-93. 390</page><page sequence="3">Greek Gods in Islam these sources were available to Muslims. The translators were not interested in literature, which they knew resisted translation, so even Homer appears in Ara- bic sources as a sage, one of a number of authors of wise sayings. For us such literary sources are fleshed out by archaeological materials, but archaeology was also not understood in the Middle Ages. Thus, the Greek gods appeared to even the best informed medieval Muslims as little more than names. The most remarkable fact of the treatment of Greek religion in Islamic sources is how seldom the names of the gods even appear. Rosenthal's anthol- ogy of borrowings from Greek in Islamic sources contains a few references to Zeus but virtually no mention of the other Olympians.2 Only Hermes has any prominence, but he is the sage of Egypt, not the messenger of Olympus. The Muslims did not receive a representative sample of Greek literature; for the most part only scientific, philosophical, and occult works were translated. With- out the Greek language and Greek poetry there was no need for manuals of Greek mythology. In the works that were translated, Neoplatonic quasi-monothe- ism dominated. Specific references to the gods tended to be bowdlerized by the translators, most of whom were Christians. Gods became "God" or "angels," as in the famous example of the Arabic translation of the Hippocratic oath. Deified heroes like Asclepius were restored to manhood. An interesting example is found in two translations of commentaries on the Golden Verses of Pythagoras, one attributed to Proclus and the other to Iamblichus.3 The beginning of the Golden Verses reads as follows in translation from the Greek: Honor the immortal gods first, in the order appointed by custom, and revere your oath. Pay reverence next to the noble heroes and the spirits of the dead by performing the prescribed rites.4 2 Franz Rosenthal, The Classical Heritage in Islam (Berkeley, 1975). 3 Ibn al-Tayyib, Proclus' Commentary on the Pythagorean Golden Verses: Arabic Text and Translation, ed. and tr.

The questions of the authenticity and attribution of these two works are not too important to my argument. A cursory reading shows that at least the "Proclus" commentary certainly is a translation from a pagan source. The Ibn al-Tayyib re- sponsible for the version we have was a Nestorian scholar in Iraq who died in 1043. His contribution to the work, according to the MS title, was in producing an istithmdr of it, which must mean extracts or summary. The point is not important for us, since the text is clearly a translation. The editor of the "Iamblichus" commentary accepts the view that it is a translation from Greek. 4 Trans. Johan C. Thom, in The Pythagorean Golden Verses: With Introduction and Com- mentary (Leiden, 1995), 95; cf. the translation in The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library, compiled and translated by Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie (Grand Rapids, 1987), 163. 391</page><page sequence="4">John Walbridge Ibn al-Tayyib's version renders this as "God [Allah] is the first of the immortals to be honored."5 Soon, however, the Arabic text drops any pretense of monothe- ism and unselfconsciously refers to "the god" (al-ildh, i.e., Zeus), daimons (sakindt), heroes (trawis), divinization (ta'alluh), animal sacrifice, libations, and other pagan themes.6 Even in Arabic the text remains thoroughly pagan. The Iamblichus commentary smoothly hides its pagan origins under monothe- istic renderings of religious terms. The same passage from the Golden Verses reads," 'Venerate those who will not be touched by death.' They are the angels of God (Allah tabdraka wa-ta 'dla), and his saints."7 In five lines of Arabic there are at least nine distinctively Islamic religious terms. It is true that the Iamblichus translation is more natural Arabic, but in translation it has ceased to be a pagan text and has become Islamic. Nonetheless, as for Christians like Augustine, so too for Muslims who wished to appropriate the heritage of ancient philosophy, the intellectual prob- lem still remained of the relation between Greek polytheism and Greek wis- dom. Was not philosophy tainted by its pagan polytheistic origins? If not, how could so lofty and divine an enterprise arise outside the system of revelation? Such questions point to various areas of investigation: the relation of philoso- phy to religion and of reason to revelation; the religious views of the philoso- phers; and how the Greek gods who appeared sometimes in the philosophies of the ancients might be replaced by the one God of Islam. Here I wish to examine the ways in which Muslim scholars committed to the appropriation of the an- cient heritage and non-Muslim scholars working in Arabic in the Islamic world reinterpreted the Greek gods so as to make them intellectually innocuous. I will deal with three major approaches: the anthropological comparative mythology of Briini, the interpretation of Greek religion as "Sabian" star-worship, and the discovery of the origins of Greek philosophy in Judaism. BTruQn: Comparative Mythology The medieval Muslim writer best informed about the Greek gods was prob- ably al-Btrulnt-a fact clearly seen, oddly enough, in his India. Btruni refers to various mythological characters, casually citing "the mythologists" (ashdb al- amthdl), "the well-known histories" (al-tawdrtkh dl-mashhura), and "the histo- rians" (al-mu'arrikhan) as his sources of information.8 He explicitly cites the 5 Ibn al-Tayyib, 8; my translation. 6 Ibid., 10, 18. 7 Iamblichus, 38. 8 Kitdbfi Tahqtq mali 'I-Hind (Hyderabad, 1958), 73; Alberuni's India, tr.

His detailed knowledge of Greek mythology imposed on Btruint the obli- gation to make some sense of it. His method is anthropological-comparative mythology-and is governed by three principles: that the religious beliefs and practices of the Greeks and the Indians tend to follow similar patterns, that a distinction is to be drawn between popular beliefs and the beliefs of the elect, and that polytheism is to be explained historically and rationally. These prin- ciples give his analysis a curiously moder quality. This is especially true since his India is the closest thing to a moder ethnography ever attempted by a medieval Muslim scholar. These explanations are related but not identical, so I will examine each in turn. 1) Comparability of the religious beliefs and practices of the Greeks and the Indians. In the beginning of the India BTruinl writes: I shall place before the reader the theories of the Hindus exactly as they are, and I shall mention in connection with them similar theories of the Greeks in order to show the relationship existing between them. For the Greek philosophers, although aiming at truth in the abstract, never in all questions of popular bearing rise much above the customary exo- teric expressions and tenets both of their religion and law. Besides Greek ideas we shall only now and then mention those of the Sufis or of some one or other Christian sect....10 His reason for this procedure seems to be both scientific and rhetorical. He certainly is interested in comparisons between civilizations. His Chronology of Ancient Nations, for example, is an attempt to bring into systematic relation all the data on calendars available from every people known to him. One suspects that he also enjoys flaunting his erudition. He is, however, anxious to combat the prejudice against India and Indian culture that he expects his readers will bring to the book. India, as he acknowledges in various ways, is oftentimes an odd place, odd in ways that were and are peculiarly objectionable to Muslims. The elaborate mythology of Hinduism with its accompanying iconography and ume (Karachi, 1979), 344-49; repr. in Fakhry, Philosophy, Dogma, and the Impact of Greek Thought in Islam (London, 1994), sect. vii. 9 No Arabic translation of Aratus is known to be extant, but one certainly once existed; see S. E. Honigmann, "The Arabic Translation of Aratus' Phaenomena," Isis, 41 (1950), 30- 31. The Sabians of Harran evidently considered Aratus to be a prophet; al-Mas'idL, Kitdb al- Tanbth wa'l-Ishraf, ed.

Sachau, I, 5-6. 393</page><page sequence="6">John Walbridge ritual still strikes many Muslims as a particularly bizarre and irrational poly- theism. Bruinl, an enthusiast for his subject, knew well the esoteric sides of Hindu thought, but his readers were likely to know Hinduism only through polemical Arabic works and travelers' tales. The Greeks had a better press, and so he found it useful to identify parallels to ideas and beliefs held by the un- questionably civilized Greeks. Btrint's scientific comparison of Greek and Indian religion seems to have been based on the belief that the Greeks and the Hindus were similar. As we can see from the passage quoted above, they shared, in his view, the trait of combining very high levels of scientific and philosophical accomplishment with a particularly anthropomorphic popular religion. Their religions were simi- lar." It would be easy to read too much into it, but this insight is at the least a canny premonition of the discovery of the Indo-Europeans. Certainly he de- serves credit for recognizing that the Greeks and Hindus shared something that they did not have in common with the Jews, Christians, and Muslims. 2) The distinction between popular beliefs and the beliefs of the elect. As he begins a chapter on the Hindu concept of God, Btruin writes: The belief of the educated and uneducated people differs in every nation; for the former strive to conceive abstract ideas and to define general principles, whilst the latter do not pass beyond the apprehen- sion of the senses, and are content with derived rules, without caring for details, especially in questions of religion and law, regarding which opinions and interests are divided.12 The philosophical origins of this view can easily be identified in the Platonic political tradition. In Islam the notion that the religions of the elect and the common people can and ought to differ is identified with the Platonic political tradition of Farabt and the Spanish philosophers and with the Isma'tlts. What- ever its philosophical pedigree, it is certainly a fair portrayal of the religious situation in the classical world and in India. In both civilizations colorful poly- theistic cults thrived side by side with extremely sophisticated philosophical speculation, whose authors in turn felt comfortable remaining within the exo- teric religions of their countrymen. Once again, this is an observation with both scientific and rhetorical implications. It allows Btruin to make sense of the gulf between philosophy and popular religion in both cultures and to make the ex- cesses-in Muslim eyes-of Indian religion palatable by distinguishing be- tween high and low religion. 3) Polytheism to be explained historically and rationally. But where, the curious medieval anthropologist might ask, did these odd beliefs and cultic " India, 18; tr. Sachau, I, 24-25. 12 India, 20; tr. Sachau, I, 27. 394</page><page sequence="7">Greek Gods in Islam practices come from in the first place, and in particular what is the source of the belief in multiple gods? The answer is apotheosis or divinization, ta'alluh, a term that, Blruint remarks, has a particularly unpleasant sound to Muslim ears.'3 The origins of such cults and beliefs is to be explained in rational terms. To be sure, he piously states: [I do not compare them] in order to prove their truth, for that which is not the truth is heresy, and polytheism is a single religion, for it is deviation from the truth.'4 This statement seems to be an effort to deflect accusations of an unhealthy interest in non-Islamic religions, for it does not do justice to the complexity of his account of the origins of polytheistic beliefs and practices, or even accu- rately represent the view that he presents in the rest of the book. Btruin gives several slightly different accounts of the origin of polytheism. The first involves the veneration of religious images. Ordinary people, Btrun observes, are much affected by visual images. While the learned may be able to conceive the immaterial world in rational terms, even ordinary Muslims would venerate a picture of the Prophet, were one to be shown to them. Thus it is that in certain religions-Judaism, Christianity, and especially Manichaeism-re- ligious leaders have decorated their temples and scriptures with images, and the ordinary people will make little distinction between the reality and the image. For this reason statues are made as monuments to venerated individuals such as prophets, scholars, and angels to keep alive their memory. With the passage of time, however, these statues cease to be memorials and become objects of veneration in themselves. The legislators of ancient times, under- standing this phenomenon, ordered their worship as a way of instilling reli- gion.'5 A slightly different account, omitting the element of deliberate religious propaganda, explains idolatry as an evolution from funerary memorials: It is evident that the first cause of idolatry was the desire of commemo- rating the dead and of consoling the living; but on this basis it has developed, and has finally become a foul and pernicious abuse.'6 Another explanation for polytheism, BtriinT thinks, is in a misunderstand- ing about the meaning of the term "god." After a series of quotations from Galen and Plato, he says: 3 India, 27; tr. Sachau, I, 36. 4 India, 18; my translation; cf. tr. Sachau, I, 24. '5 India, 84; tr. Sachau, I, 111-12. 16 India, 96; tr. Sachau, I, 124. 395</page><page sequence="8">These quotations prove that the Greeks call in general god everything that is glorious and noble, and the like usage exists among many na- tions. They go even so far as to call gods the mountains, the seas, etc. Secondly, they apply the term god in a special sense to the First Cause, to the angels, and to their souls. According to a third usage, Plato calls gods the Sektnat. But on this subject the terms of the interpreters are not perfectly clear, so that we only know the name, but not what it means.17 In this passage and through the quotations that support it, Biruin argues that a confusion exists due to the fact that the ancient peoples used the term "god" in a much broader sense than do Muslims. Having cited a decidedly monotheistic passage from Plato to show that the concept of God as first cause was known to the Greeks, he shows that the Greeks applied the word "god" to a great variety of people and things: the souls of those blessed due to their role in ruling the world; the great benefactors of mankind, such as the founders of beneficial arts and the lawgivers; the angels; the great natural phenomena; the stars and plan- ets; and abstract ideas. Perhaps more significant is the fact that Biruin does not condemn polythe- ism in this passage but explains it as a matter of linguistic usage. The reason seems to be that these examples are all taken from the works of eminent Greek philosophers and scientists: Galen, Hippocrates, Plato, Proclus, and Asclepius are all either quoted or mentioned. Such men cannot be accused of crude poly- theism. These are the elect of the Greek nation, whose beliefs may be assumed to be in general agreement with the philosophers of other nations. Thus, for Brfuin the problem of the Greek gods is primarily anthropologi- cal and not religious or philosophical. No nation has a monopoly on truth, nor are the religions of the Greeks and Indians, whether of the ordinary people or the elect, to be understood simply as error. Greek popular religion, like the religion of any other nation, not excluding Islam, is a representation of the truth, more or less imperfect but always based on the senses, a representation shaped not only by the limitations of those who formed it but by historical accidents and the beneficial lies of legislators. In contrast the religion of the elect, whether of Plato or the Bhagavad Gita, is detached from the material world. Thus, religions can converge on the plane of philosophy, while their popular forms have wildly different sensible expressions.'8 17 India, 26-27; tr. Sachau, I, 35-36. This is the word that Ibn al-Tayyib's text uses to render daimon; Ibn al-Tayyib, 18. It is obviously the Hebrew shekinah. The term appears several times in the Qur'an (2:248, 9:26, 9:40, 48:4, 48:18, 48:26), where it generally refers to some kind of assistance sent down from heaven to the believers. 18 See also Franz Rosenthal, "Al-Birinl between Greece and India," in Ehsan Yarshater (ed.), Biruni Symposium (New York, 1976), 1-12, repr. in Franz Rosenthal, Science and Medi- cine in Islam (Aldershot, Hampshire, 1990), sect. XI; and Bruce B. Lawrence, "Al-Birunini's 396 John Walbridge</page><page sequence="9">Greek Gods in Islam This theory of religion probably has as its philosophical context the theory of prophecy and religion put forward by Farabl half a century earlier and devel- oped in Bruinl's time by Avicenna and later by the Spanish philosophers Ibn Bajja (Avempace), Ibn Tufayl, and Averroes. Prophecy by this account was a matter of casting truth in the form of images suitable for ordinary understand- ing. These images, as well as religious laws and practices, could differ depend- ing on the nature and circumstances of the particular community and would naturally be understood differently by those of different levels of ability- BTriun's educated and uneducated people. The elect would understand the true meaning of the symbols, and to the degree that they themselves were philoso- phers, their understandings would agree with those of the philosophers of other nations.'9 Sabianism, the Religion of the Greek Star-Worshippers Blruin's anthropology of religion was only possible for a scholar deeply immersed in the lore of other nations. For those less versed in the mythology of the Greeks, there were other imperatives, in particular the need to find an Is- lamic explanation of Greek religion. Of course it would have been simple to class the devotees of the Greek cults as mushrikiun, those who associate other gods with God, either denying the reality of the old gods or identifying them as demons, as the early Christians had done. Such a solution would not do. First, the early Christians had developed their theologies at a time when the old gods still retained some of their strength-for who could deny the reality of their occult powers? By the time of Islam the gods were dead, their power gone forever from the world. It was no longer necessary to provide an explanation for their malevolent influence. Second, the logic of the Islamic revelation demanded of those in serious contact with Greek thought that the Greek religion be legitimized in some sense. This demand was felt not only by Muslim philosophers and philhellenes but even by enemies who had taken serious notice of Greek thought, notably GhazalT (d. 1111), the author of the most important Islamic attack on Graeco-Islamic philosophy. The Qur'an had offered a universal account of history in which a succession of prophetic religions expressed the divine truth. Such a theory Approach to the Comparative Study of Indian Culture," in Yarshater (ed.), Biruni Symposium, 27-48. Rosenthal is interested in the way that Birunl recognizes the achievements of the Indians while continuing to assert the superiority of Greek achievements; Lawrence analyzes the specific limitations that prevented Bruint from obtaining a truly accurate understanding of Hindu thought. 19 The main texts expounding this view are collected for the English-speaking reader in the Islamic section of Ralph Lerer and Muhsin Mahdi (eds.), Medieval Political Philosophy (Ithaca, 1972). Its most vivid presentation is in Ibn Tufayl's philosophical novel Hayy ibn Yaqzdn, ed. and tr. Leon Gauthier (Beirut, 19362); tr. L. E. Goodman (New York, 1972). 397</page><page sequence="10">John Walbridge worked admirably for the Judeo-Christian tradition with which Muhammad and the Arabs had been familiar. It could easily be extended to account for Zoroastrianism and, had anyone wished to do so, could even include Buddhism and Manichaeism. It did not work for Greek religion, which was in no sense monotheistic and had no prophets. On the other hand, the failure to account for so conspicuous a part of cultural history must inevitably call the whole system into doubt-as eventually happened in Europe. Thus, Greek religion needed to be fit into the Qur'anic sacred history. The answer was Sabianism. In three passages the Qur'in had mentioned the Sdbi'uin along with the Jews and Christians as believers in Allah.20 Who these people were was a mys- tery to the early commentators on the Qur'an and remains an unsettled ques- tion. Several groups, notably the pagans of the city of Harran and a gnostic group in Iraq, claimed to be Sabians. Their motivations for doing so seem simple enough; as Sabians they were "people of the Book," monotheists en- titled to the free exercise of their religion under the protection of the Muslim state.21 A more interesting question is why Muslims accepted such claims, and indeed extended the use of the term "Sabian" to refer to a variety of extinct polytheistic religions, including those of Greece and Egypt. "Sabians," the great heresiographer Shahrastain tells us, are those who ac- cept both the sensible and intelligible worlds, who obey religious laws and ordinances (buduid wa-ahkdm), but who, unlike the Zoroastrians, Jews, Chris- tians, and Muslims, do not believe in a shar'a (religious law) or islam.22 "Their religion," he adds, "centers on zeal for the spiritual beings (ruhadn?ydt)."23 Ac- cording to the Spanish historian of science, Sa'id al-Andalusi, "Most of the Greeks were Sabians who venerated the heavenly bodies and persisted in their worship of idols."24 The same was true of the ancient Egyptians: "In the distant past, the people of Egypt were Sabians; they worshiped idols and maintained temples."25 The best-known Sabians were the Harranians, whose pagan star cult has been often discussed. It seems that the ancient moon cult of Harran had 20 2:62, 5:69,22:17. 21 A summary of the current state of the art in Harranian studies, with all the major bibliog- raphy, is Tamara M. Green, The City of the Moon God: Religious Traditions of Harran (Leiden, 1992), especially chaps. 4-8. Another recent work is $inasi Giindiiz, The Knowledge ofLife: The Origins and Early History of the Mandaeans and their Relation to the Sabians of the Qur 'an and to the Harranians (Oxford, 1994), who concludes that the Sabians of the Qur'an were the Mandaeans of southern Iraq and that this group had no significant connection with the Harranians. See also G. Fehervari, Encyclopaedia of Islam (2nd ed.) s.v.."Harran." The definitive study of the Sabians as they appear in Islamic literature is C.

The details of the cult are not as well known as we might like (the ubiquitous Birumn is one of our better sources), but certainly it was a survival of Greek paganism and may have played a significant role in the survival of Greek philosophy after the crack- down on pagan philosophers in the early sixth century. The Harranians also played a significant role in the transmission of Greek learning to the Muslims. The Harranians had every reason to assert the claim to be "Sabians" if the term included the polytheistic religions of ancient Egypt and Greece. As a Her- metic cult their religion had its origins in both Greece and Egypt, Hermes being an ancient Egyptian and the rest of their cult being thoroughly Hellenic. Aratus, the author of the poem on the mythology of the constellations cited by Brfint, was one of their prophets, for example. Such an identification would be attractive to Muslims for their own reasons. To scholars committed to both Islam and Greek philosophy, the appearance of philosophy in a pagan nation poses a problem. For medieval Christian philosophers there was only one full revelation of God's truth, the incarnation of Christ, a light compared to which all else was darkness. God emerges into history decisively only once. Greek philosophy is a remarkable achievement of unaided human reason, but the pa- gan philosophers are fundamentally no different from any other non-Chris- tians. The Qur'an, however, had injected revelation into history in a more thor- oughgoing way. There was one religion, often renewed. It was embarrassing that the greatest achievements of human reason should take place precisely in that civilization least amenable to explanation in terms of revelation. Much the same was true of Egypt, whose material achievements could still be seen and whose intellectual achievements had not been forgotten. Identifying the reli- gions of these two civilizations as "Sabian" brought them into the realm of the prophetic. To be sure, no one knew exactly how the Sabians originated, but the label at least protected the integrity of Islamic sacred history and allowed Mus- lim scholars to justify philosophy as a fundamentally religious enterprise. The legitimacy of such an identification could be strengthened by the char- acterization of the Sabians as "star worshippers." The worship of stars was scarcely pure monotheism, and the Abraham of the Qur'an had rejected it. "When night came, he saw a star. He said, 'This is my Lord.' But when it set, he said, 'I love not those that set.' " Likewise, in subsequent verses he rejects the worship of the moon and sun.26 Nonetheless, star worship could be justified as a legitimate but primitive practice. It was even easier for the philosophers, for whom the stars and planets were living beings of a higher and purer nature than ourselves. They were angels or something very like angels. They were cer- tainly beings closer to God than us. The worship of the stars was thus not shirk in the same sense as the old Arabian worship of stone idols. Like Christianity 266:76. 399</page><page sequence="12">John Walbridge and Judaism such a religion fell short of the pure monotheism of Islam, but like them it had a portion of the truth. Thus the identification of the Greeks (and the Egyptians) as Sabians served several intellectual and practical interests. It al- lowed the Harranians to practice their pagan cult in peace. It allowed Muslim philhellenes to defend Greek thought as the product of the monotheistic reli- gious tradition. Finally, it safeguarded the integrity of Qur'anic sacred history by placing Greek philosophy and science, both of them unquestionably great achievements of humanity, within the realm of the prophetic religions. The Greek Philosophers as Biblical Monotheists There is one other solution to the challenge posed by pagan philosophy to the sacred history of monotheism, a solution that makes the "divine" Greek philosophers monotheists of the biblical tradition-or, for their enemies, pla- giarists of the wisdom of the prophets. It is not hard to defend the claim that the Greek philosophers, at least the Platonists, were monotheists, or at least well on the road to monotheism. Au- gustine, for example, considered Neoplatonism to be a suitable waystation on the way from paganism to Christianity. Proclus's proof that all existence pro- ceeds from a single first cause and that this first cause is the Good and the One27 is as pure a statement of monotheism as one could wish. The issue was even clearer to a medieval Islamic reader, for the Arabic translations of works like pseudo-Plutarch's doxography used terms like Allah, al-ilah, and ilahf, all respectable Islamic terms for the Divinity.28 We find two explanations offered for such pagan monotheism. The first and less philosophical explanation concerns the history of phi- losophy in Greece. In an often copied account we read that Empedocles had learned his wisdom in Syria from Luqman the sage, a legendary figure men- tioned in the Qur'an.29 Luqman had lived in the time of David and, we pre- sume, learned from that great prophet. Pythagoras, placed incorrectly after Empedocles, had studied in Egypt with the disciples of Solomon, another prophet according to the Qur'an. With such a pedigree we are not surprised to learn that Socrates derived [his] wisdom from Pythagoras, but limited himself to the di- vine sciences, to the exclusion of other kinds. He turned away from worldly pleasures and publicly declared his disagreement with the Greeks on religion, confronting the leaders of the polytheists with ra- tional arguments and logical demonstrations. The king consigned him 27 Proclus, Elements of Theology, prop. 11-13. 28 Pseudo-Plutarch, De placita 1.6-7, in Hans Daiber, Aetius Arabus: Die Vorsokratiker in arabischer Uberlieferung (Wiesbaden, 1980). 29 31:12-13. 400</page><page sequence="13">Greek Gods in Islam to prison in order to appear praiseworthy to them; and he gave him poison to drink, in order to guard against their wickedness.30 Variants of the story make clear that Socrates had opposed the idol worship of the Athenians. An alchemical text attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan, for example, alludes to Socrates rejecting Zeus.31 Socrates' story is thus merged with the story of Abraham's rejection of polytheism in the Qur'an, and he becomes a martyr not of philosophy but of Islam. Variants of this account are to be found elsewhere. Sometimes Hermes, identified with the Qur'anic prophet Idris and the Biblical Enoch, is the first link in the chain of philosophy-whence his title, "father of philosophers." Empedocles is said to have been the first "to combine the meanings of the attributes of God," perhaps to be read as a uniting of the separate aspects of the divinity, formerly expressed as many gods, in one God. The details do not matter much, since once linked with the Jews, the philosophers can be left in peace to elaborate their arguments about God in the shade of the tree of proph- ecy. The same account describes a plague in the time of Plato. The Greeks pray to God (Allah) and consult a prophet of Israel as to the cause of the plague and how it might be averted. God reveals to the prophet that the Greeks must double the size of a certain cubical altar. The Greeks at first misunderstand the instruc- tion, doubling each side of the cube, and the plague is only averted by Plato's mathematical skill in creating a cube of double the volume of the original. The original story is well known in Greek, where in the earliest sources the story is set at Delos, the offended God is Apollo, and the "prophet" is the famous oracle there.32 Curiously, this explanation is also given by the greatest opponent of phi- losophy in Islam, al-Ghazalf. In his autobiography, The Delivererfrom Error, he tells how he had investigated the claims of philosophy by mastering it from the inside. While we may question whether his two years of study provided him with quite the mastery of philosophy that he claimed, he certainly had a solid understanding of its strengths and weaknesses and a healthy respect for its achievements. What he does not do is denounce it as tainted by its polythe- istic origins. In the introduction to his great refutation of philosophy, The Inco- herence of the Philosophers, he hotly denies that the great philosophers were polytheists or that they had denied the existence of God, prophecy, and reli- gious law and insists that those who have rejected religious belief, thinking that they are imitating the great philosophers, have simply failed to understand their 30 al-'Amiri, Kitib al-Amad 'aid 'l-Abad, in Everett K.

In actuality, Ghazali says, the philosophers' errors are on points of detail, not on fundamental issues of prophecy, religion, and the unity of God.33 It is in regard to ethics and politics that GhazalT claims monotheistic ori- gins for philosophical doctrines, stating that their ethical doctrines were plagia- rized from the mystics and their political doctrines from the prophets.34 Al- though he does not discuss them in much detail, in some ways philosophical ethics and politics are more dangerous to Ghazalt than the physics and meta- physics. It was easy to show that the philosophers themselves disagreed about many important metaphysical doctrines, and moreover that these doctrines were contrary to Islam and, in Ghazalf's view, internally inconsistent. The same could not be said of ethics and politics, subjects on which the philosophers were in general agreement. In the case of ethics their doctrines were in full agreement with Islam. In the case of politics they provided a philosophical explanation of religion in general and Islam in particular, one with which he had some sympa- thy.35 Ghazall, as he was probably well aware, faced a dangerous dilemma here. He could not reject these sciences outright because he agreed with them, but if he admitted their validity, he was also implicitly accepting the philosophical explanation of religion and thus the claim of the philosophers to have given a master explanation of religions in general and Islam in particular. His solution was to claim that these two sciences were the products of revelation, not rea- son, and to hurry on before too many questions were asked. Among the historians who study late antiquity, it is a popular amusement to trace the disappearance of classical paganism and identify exactly when and how the old gods disappeared from various places and aspects of life and soci- ety.36 As we have seen, the Greek gods are so thoroughly banished from medi- eval Arabic texts that when they appear, they are curiosities, not major intellec- tual and spiritual threats, as they would have been for Augustine half a millen- nium earlier. Nevertheless, they did pose a challenge even to Muslims born far too late to have met living polytheists; for the old gods were the patrons of Greek philosophy and science, enterprises too lofty, successful, and useful for those familiar with them to dismiss out of hand. For Muslim scholars the chal- lenge was intellectual, not religious: the old gods had to be explained, not exorcised. 33 al-Ghazalt, The Incoherence of the Philosophers, ed. and tr. Machael E.

In the process he developed the beginnings of an anthropology of reli- gion, an achievement for which he perhaps deserves more credit. After all, most other Islamic philosophers and scientists simply ignored the details of Greek popular religion on the grounds that only the elite religion of philosophi- cal theology was worth their trouble. More often the Greek gods posed a challenge to Islamic sacred history, which explained religious development in terms of successive prophetic reli- gions. Greek religion had to be made to fit one of the existing categories in Islamic sacred history. The two that were used were Sabianism, usually identi- fied as star worship, and the biblical prophets, whose monotheism was trans- mitted to early Greek philosophers who visited Syria and Egypt. Medieval Muslims were not alone in finding such an explanation appealing; the Jewish philosopher Judah Halevi wrote: What is thy opinion of Solomon's accomplishments? Did he not, with the assistance of divine, intellectual, and natural power, converse on all sciences? The inhabitants of the earth travelled to him, in order to carry forth his learning, even as far as India. Now the roots and principles of all sciences were handed down from us first to the Chaldaeans, then to the Persians and the Medians, then to Greece, and finally to the Ro- mans. On account of the length of this period, and the many disturbing circumstances, it was forgotten that they had originated with the He- brews....37 Leopold Bloom in Joyce's Ulysses also held such a view: What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concern- ing a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen? That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical phi- losopher, name uncertain.38 Our texts thus give us one more answer to the old question of when paganism finally died: it died when Muslim scholars looked upon the names of the old gods and did not fear their power.
