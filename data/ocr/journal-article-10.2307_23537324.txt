<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Genetic Approach to Teaching Madame Bovary Éric Le Calvez Imagine an ideal situation where your department agreed to acquire the microfilms or photocopies of the Madame Bovary manuscripts (preserved in the Bibliothèque Municipale of Rouen). One of the main difficulties in teaching the novel from a genetic standpoint stems from the very nature of Flaubert's drafts: their sheer volume. Examining the 3600 pages of a text that contains only 350 pages in its published version would require even more time than the ten years J. Goldin spent on the drafts of a single chapter (Goldin 1989; see also 1984). Thus, the course will be divided into sections, each one illustrated with precise exam ples and issues: what is a scene?; what are the distinctive features of dialogue?; what is the meaning of description?, and so forth. Before hand the student must become familiar with technical skills which are analytical tools that allow the construction of an interpretative appa ratus. It will be a question of making the manuscript talk, depending on the individual's point of view and using theoretical principles (stylistic, narratologic, semiotic, etc.). Interpretative and Methodological Premises Let us consider a specific issue—the one of description—and a spe cific example: the landscape description introduced into the scene dur ing which Emma surrenders to Rodolphe. In the definitive version of the novel is appears as follows: Elle renversa son cou blanc, qui se gonflait d'un soupir et, défaillante, tout en Eleurs, avec un long frémissement et se cachant la figure, elle s'abandonna, es ombres du soir descendaient; le soleil horizontal, passant entre les branches, lui éblouissait les yeux. Çà et là, tout autour d'elle, dans les feuilles ou par terre, des taches lumineuses tremblaient, comme si des colibris, en volant, eussent éparpillé leurs plumes. Le silence était partout; quelque chose de doux semblait sortir des arbres; elle sentait son coeur, dont les battements recommençaient, et le sang circuler dans sa chair comme un fleuve de lait. Alors, elle entendit tout au loin, au-delà du bois, sur les autres collines, un cri vague et prolongé, une voix qui se traînait, et elle l'écoutait silencieusement, se mêlant comme une musique aux dernières vibrations de ses nerfs émus. Rodolphe, le cigare aux dents, raccom modait avec son canif une des deux brides cassées. (165-166)1 The landscape description "displaces the reader's attention from the first sexual encounter between Rodolphe and Emma and is itself rudely interrupted by the depiction of Rodolphe after the event."2 The prob 127</page><page sequence="2">128 A Genetic Approach to Teaching Madame Bovary lem this passage raises is thus twofold, the connection with the charac ter and the connection with the narrative. As far as the description-character relationship is concerned, it is one of those "emotional landscapes" (Lloyd 110-140) or "psychological descriptions" (Bollème 215 sq) dear to Flaubert. On the one hand, a de tail acts upon the character (the sun itself passes and dazzles) whereas on the other hand, anthropomorphic predicates reciprocally invest the descriptive statement (tremblaient, doux). This is one of the expres sions of metonymy, a fundamental operation of prose (Jakobson 136) and of the function of some descriptions (Riffaterre 1981a, 11). Indeed, the scene of Emma's surrender reappears on the next page in the form of an analepsis (Emma's memory: "elle voyait les arbres"), and the text reads: Elle voyait les arbres, les chemins, les fossés, Rodolphe, et elle sentait encore l'étreinte de ses bras, tandis que le feuillage frémissait et que les joncs sifflaient. (166-167) Our passage lacks this last descriptive touch. However, Emma abandoned herself "avec un long frémissement." This intratextual echo is a sign of the circulation between the character and the landscape, and hence of the psychological role of the description. It is based upon a sort of syllogistic mode: if Emma shudders, and if the landscape that surrounds her shudders, then Emma's shudder is that of the landscape, and so the landscape description acts as a substitute for the analysis of her feelings. As far as the description-narration relationship is concerned, this example is a crucial one. In fact, theory (or, rather, a certain conception of narratology) teaches the predominance of action and of narrative changes (see Prince 42). Here the sequence of events is interrupted. Between the two actions stated ("elle s'abandonna" and "elle enten dit") the central action—the sexual act—dissolves into the evocation of a psychological landscape. We only know that it has happened; there is a gap in the narrative, the description retains only a few tem poral traces of this displacement (recommençaient, alors, dernières vi brations). It is a paralipsis.3 "The narrative does not skip over a mo ment of time, as in an ellipsis, but it sidesteps a given element" (Genette 1980, 53). Nevertheless, Flaubert, in his Correspondance, often names the scene a baisade (directly referring to the eluded event): "je suis à leur baisade, en plein, au milieu."4 Analyzing this passage from the standpoint of its genesis cannot help but reveal the processes that gov erned this curious textual layout. After having found the drafts among the totally disordered manuscripts, and having classified them in chronological order,5 the</page><page sequence="3">Éric Le Calvez 129 genetic study can be tackled. One of the key requirements of the method then intervenes. Neither the causes of the effects, nor the confirmation of one's own presuppositions should be sought in the manuscripts.6 Keeping in mind the text in its definitive version and the theoretical principles that allow its interpretation, one must endeavor to define or to bring to light the modes of production, paying attention to the perti nent transformations. Scenarios: Setting up the Description. Flaubert's manuscripts follow a similar chronological and structural pattern. First of all Flaubert writes scenarios, in which he organizes his story little by little. He then writes rough drafts, passing to the ac tual writing stage of his work, seeking the appropriate form for a long time. The scenarios testify to the emphasis Flaubert places on the link ing of the episodes, on the progression of the story (see Gothot-Mersch 181). I will therefore pay particular attention to them, and then use the rough drafts to consider a few transformations relative to the issue in question. The first folio where the extract germinates appears in the follow ing manner (ms gg9 f° 2 v °):7 De ses deux amants, le 1er coup est résisté et au bout H dans les bois - automne d'une longue lutte avec elle même surtout - le second est Emma,(amazone française) monte une surpnsc-B elle est tout étonnée quand elle revient à elle. à cheval avec lui. il faut que le 1er coup comme couleur domine tout le reste de la passion. - qu'il y en ait toujours dessus le reflet. Originally this event, so central in the story of Madame Bovary, is quite detached from the narrative. It is not really a scenario yet, but a sort of isolated summary in which Flaubert compares Emma's two lovers. He states the particularities of each one in relation to an event that is literally stated (coup). As often with Flaubert, the marginal addition is essential. Indeed, it contains the two principal components of scene necessary to the existence of narrative: space (bois) and time (automne). It infers a setting (and therefore the possibility of a descrip tion), and its atmosphere. It predicts a scene (representing the event), grounding itself, in an implicit way, on a stereotyped system of values (autumn, falling leaves, Emma—ripe and ready for picking).</page><page sequence="4">130 A Genetic Approach to Teaching Madame Bovary Furthermore, the metaphorical color specifies the narrative effect that the scene will have to produce, insisting on its uniqueness (domine tout le reste). However, when he integrates this passage into the scenario, Haubert does not seemingly associate it with a specific scene (ms gg9 f° 3 v°: - l'empoigne en blaguant et lui remue vigoureusement le temperament c'est dans les bois, à cheval - rendez-vous dans le bois - Indeed, if the passage was obvious in Flaubert's mind, it is not clear for us, as it contains linguistic ambiguity. The "eternizing" effect created by the use of the present tense (a distinctive feature of any of Haubert's scenarios) does not allow us to say if Haubert is imagining a scene. Moreover, due to the lack of article, this rendez-vous remains imprecise. Is it a single rendez-vous or several? Finally, the scenario illogically states, at the same time, les bois and le bois. In other words, will the text become iterative or singulative? It is difficult to decide, all the more so, since the sequence remains separated from the narrative, situated in a summary about Rodolphe. In the following scenario the scene has germinated and the manuscript reveals the textual marks that establish it in the narrative (ms gg9 f° 10 v° ): il la fait monter à cheval avec lui - dans un bois d'automne |baisadc) - figure d'E rouge de vent - son voile accroché aux buissons - haletante de la course elle descend et est obligée de s'appuyer contre un tronc de chêne - baisade - Now the story is not located "dans les bois" but "dans un bois." The singularity of place (and of time: "dans un bois d'automne") is a sign of the singularity of the event: the present tense has no longer the general value it had before. It should be stressed that the appearance of the scene in the narrative is linked to the appearance of topographic de tails: tronc de chêne, buissons, vent. Topographie germination and nar rative germination are simultaneous. By way of conclusion the event is introduced: baisade (the very title of the scene in Flaubert's letters).</page><page sequence="5">Éric Le Calvez 131 If the narrative is organized in broad terms, it has not yet the spe cific nature found in the published version. If spatial details are be ginning to proliferate, the description they seem to imply does not take shape. In the four following scenarios, Flaubert copies the same infor mation (he just adds some new details to the scene),8 but in the eighth scenario the text evolves in a decisive way (ms gg9 f° 27): Courses dans le bois - Au galop. - elle est essoufflée. - on met pied à terre. - il attache les deux chevaux qui broutent les feuilles - on marche. |env| crainte vagues d'Emma - elle veut revenir vers les chevaux - petites clochettes des vaches perdus dans le taillis - soir d'automne - Mots coupés - roucoulemens a soupirs entremêlés dans le dialogue (- hein... voulez-vous, quoi). - (la baise sur) voile noir, oblique sur sa figure, comme des ondes - Montrer nettement le geste de Rodolphe qui lui prend le cul d'une main, a la taille de l'autre - et elle s'abandonna. - renature - bourdonnement de tempes d'Emma. Seemingly, at the very moment Flaubert writes the injunction to be very precise in representing the event ("montrer nettement le geste de Rodolphe") he decides to make it disappear from the text. In parallel the title of the scene (which also designates the event) is no longer mentioned. Is this a simple deletion? Not really, as baisade is replaced by three successive statements: preliminary action {et elle s'aban donna), description to be produced {renature), and effect upon the char acter {bourdonnement de tempes d'Emma). The very juxtaposition of these statements discloses their corollary quality: the paralipsis and the metonymy are ready, as is the narrative and psychological function of the forthcoming description. As far as the paralipsis is concerned, the nature of the text will no longer be modified. In fact, Flaubert establishes the textual flow of the narrative (its mouvement, as he said) in such a way that the sentence is already given a stylistic mold. The verb changes to the past historic tense (a phenomenon that is rather rare in the scenarios), the structure of the clause will never vary (only the "et" will disappear), and nor will its position in the narrative (rupture, new line, description). Let us note that in the following scenario (ms gg9° f° 25 v°) Flaubert discovers one of the juxtapositions later contained in the published version, the irony of which has been underlined (Chambers 208): "paysage de soleil couchant—bruit de clochettes—R. fumant son cigare." It creates a fur ther discrepancy between the landscape, the character's emotion it sig</page><page sequence="6">132 A Genetic Approach to Teaching Madame Bovary nifies, and the lack of emotion of the other character with whom the statements are juxtaposed. As far as the metonymy is concerned, the link joining landscape and character becomes more precise as the text evolves. The most significant example of this is the last scenario (ms g2233 f° 252): R: ils s'arrêtèrent - moi aussi je suis plus faible j'ai le coeur... quand je vous regarde feu au ventre. elle pleure Oh est-ce vrai. Rod ts'appuie sur son epaule. un baiser sur le cou} a elle s'abandonna Nature Calme bourdonnement de mouches qui embêtent les chevaux - gd paysage - Rodolphe rajuste la fi/v.vce bride a fume. grand ciel rouge - Whereas before Flaubert defined the characteristics of nature {soleil couchant), which the published version does not contain, he now qualifies the landscape several times: "nature calme," "grand paysage," "grand ciel rouge." (The color, which was metaphorical in the first scenario, becomes here literal, in a stereotyped way.) This im posing (and repetitive) appearance is of course linked to the unique quality of the passage, and the first anthropomorphic adjective is in troduced: the calm of the landscape is that of Emma after the event. Among the diverse expressions of the metonymy at this embryonic stage of the text, the following significant detail must be noticed: "bourdonnement de mouches." This is curiously reminiscent of the "bourdonnement de tempes d'Emma," found in a previous scenario (f° 27). More than an indication of Flaubert's hesitation when choosing details, this symmetry is a testimony of the comings and goings between landscape and character, indeed, of the interchangeability of the signs that represent them respectively. One must always pay attention to this circulation of values that the manuscripts conceal and that the hesitative nature of creation in the drafts permits (this is one of the temporary traces of the intratextual echo that I have mentioned in my preliminaries, and which will be transformed in the published ver sion).</page><page sequence="7">Éric Le Calvez 133 Studying the scenarios is thus enlightening in several ways. First of all, they show that the two phenomena (paralipsis/metonymy) found in the final version are totally interdependent and simultaneously take shape, in the pre-text, due to the choice of a structure: simple juxtaposition of the statements after deletion. Moreover, they show that the description is not independent of the narrative, but also that the elaboration of its function is linked to the elaboration of the narrative itself. Finally, if "the mimesis is subordinated to the significance" (Riffaterre 1981b, 125), the manuscripts reveal that this is not a secondary of additive process. It is rather an overall process that takes possession of the whole text during its tentative writing. (We learn at the same time how to distrust theoretical precepts that often seem ineffective: in this case, considering the narrative from the point of view of action does not really make any sense.) Rough Drafts: Further Transformations Flaubert chooses not to elaborate the color of the sunset. He certainly is concerned about endowing his passage with an unique appearance.9 When he begins the drafts (three successive occurrences for this para graph), Flaubert concentrates on the calm of nature, a generative nu cleus of the description and metonymy. However the presence of such a metonym is only an intermediary and temporary stage in the elaboration of the text. In the first draft, the adjective calme is replaced by a clause: "sentiment d'un immense silence a repos" (ms g2233 f° 257 v°). It literally designates the meaning of the description, all the more so, since the calme of the landscape has been displaced: "les battements de son coeur se calmant." This statement is modified in the second draft, where Flaubert writes (ms g2233f°256): "[le repos—la sécurité], qq chose de doux semblait sortir des arbres." Flaubert moves from explicit to implicit, transforming a psychological statement into a topographic one. He deletes the psychological se quence and associates an anthropomorphic predicate (doux) with a de tail of the landscape (arbres), leaving it undetermined (quelque chose, semblait). The anthropomorphic appearance of the landscape in the published version is thus the result of preliminary métonymie trans formations. In the final text, the calm of the landscape and the uniqueness of its atmosphere depend on several devices, the nature of which is both thematic—smallness of the evocated details (taches, colibris, plumes), silence (le silence était partout)—and stylistic: for example the abun dance of comparisons (comme si des colibris, comme un fleuve, comme une musique).</page><page sequence="8">134 A Genetic Approach to Teaching Madame Bovary The fineness of details, associated with luminous effects and an un realistic comparison, is not immediate in the manuscripts. In the first draft, the emotional intensity spontaneously takes the form of rigid matter, as often in Flaubert's work (see Danger 97): "moires d'acier sur l'eau." In the second draft, the description of the water disappears and the steel shimmerings are transmuted into some "plaques lumineuses chatoyant entre l'ombre du sol" (it is only in the third draft, ms g2233 f° 257—that Flaubert replaces "plaques" by "taches," eliminating the metallic connotations of the passage), and a simile is added: "comme les plumes tombées de quelque paon." Then Flaubert deletes the sentence and writes: "comme si des colibris en volant eussent éparpillé sur le bois les plumes de leur queue" (after an amazing attempt in the margin, which is worth noticing: "comme le plumage éparpillé d'un troupeau de colibris"). Though it is not possible to interpret the arrival of these fantastic (and exotic) humming-birds, it is possible to detect the reason for the peacock's disappearance. In such a context, and because of Rodolphe's proximity, the presence of the peacock—falling within a stereotyped symbolism: Rodolphe is a peacock that struts about and se duces his female—would have implied, with no doubt, an ironic and implicit discrepancy with Emma's emotion, disrupting the role of the métonymie description. Likewise, if Flaubert immediately comes across one of his eloquent "silences" (Genette 1966, 234 sq) in the first draft, associating it with a very human feeling ("sentiment d'un immense silence a repos"), he does not yet think of the voice that in the published version mingles with the calm while disturbing it. In the first draft, the end of the passage takes the form of a metaphorical comparison: "le battement de ses nerfs emus comme un instrument de musique qui arrête ses vibrations." In the second draft, Flaubert elaborates the conclusion of the passage: " et le dernier tressaillement de ses nerfs emus. R à coté d'elle avait allumé un cigare a il racommodait avec son Canif une des deux brides Cassées." However some suspension points precede the sentence: they seem to indicate an empty space to fill, as if Flaubert was looking for a connection.10 He finds it later and adds it at the bottom of the page: alors elle entendit tout au loin une voix lente qui [appelait] qui se traînait en ap pelant. a absorbée elle l'ecoutait [avec delices] délicieusement, a se mêlait comme une musique au dernier tressaillement. The comparison is used again and transformed (it is now an anony mous voice that is music). This thematic, structural and rhythmic addi tion emphasizes in parallel the landscape-character connection ("se</page><page sequence="9">Éric Le Calvez 135 mêlait comme une musique"). Such a connection becomes a perfect inter action in the third draft, since Flaubert restores the metaphor by re placing "[tressaillements]" by "vibrations," as in the first draft: Emma reappears as a metaphorical musical instrument. Finally, the river of milk comparison is found within the second draft and never varies, whereas another comparison in the first draft is not retained in the published version: "la terre avec des balancements comme le pont d'un navire." It should not be concluded that Flaubert suppresses this latter comparison because of its impertinence. If he had maintained it, would we question its pertinence? Probably not.11 In ad dition, he elaborates it in the margin of the second draft (then he deletes it): [La terre doucement lui semblait osciller comme le pont d'un navire avec la cime des arbres qui se confondaient.] For the purpose of economy, Flaubert is not likely to create multiple comparisons in a short paragraph (the description already contains three times the adverb comme). However, it is more interesting to no tice that he again uses an identical metaphor in a very different con text later in the novel. When Emma reads Rodolphe's letter, she is so desperate that she almost commits suicide, and the text reads: Le rayon lumineux qui montait d'en bas directement tirait vers l'abîme le poids de son corps. Il lui semblait que le sol de la place oscillant s'élevait le long des murs, et que le plancher s'inclinait par le bout, à la manière d'un vaisseau qui tangue. Elle se tenait tout au bord, presque suspendue, entourée d'un grand espace. Le Bleu du ciel l'envahissait, l'air circulait dans sa tête creuse, elle n'avait qu'à céder, qu'à se laisser prendre; et le ronflement du tour ne discontinuait pas, comme une voix furieuse qui l'appelait. (211)12 This phenomenon raises a major (theoretical) problem that demon strates how much the closure effect of a text rests on a reading illusion. If Emma's happiness and misfortune can be associated, even temporar ily, with an identical sign, then textual units have no intrinsic semiotic value, but rather diverse values that depend on the context in which they are inserted. * * * Examining the manuscripts, while revealing what the text could have become, unveils the production (in a dynamic sense) and the elaboration of a finished product (see Bellemin-Noël 5). Here the production does not obey predefined criteria. Its dynamism, progressively oriented around the effect the description has to produce in the narrative, appears to be an agglomerate of interdependent processes, that are often difficult or artificial to dissociate.</page><page sequence="10">136 A Genetic Approach to Teaching Madame Bovary The pedagogical contribution of genetics is multiple. The first contri bution results from the technical aspect of the method. The student learns how to consider the novel as a text, concentrating on its textual ity; the realist illusion then dissolves. The student becomes more sen sitive to the author's processes, understanding better the devices of the novel and the way it functions. The second contribution is a result of the theoretical aspect of the method. The manuscripts, and the issue chosen to study, can be understood only by continuously shifting focus between the particular and the general, between practice and theory (avoiding hermeneutics). Genetics therefore allows the student to be given a solid scientific training starting at an undergraduate level (and an exposure to research). The last contribution results from the combinative and dynamic aspect of the method. In fact, "the use of different critical methods applied to drafts treated as texts teaches critics: 1) that their conclusions are relative; 2) that their method and theories sometimes are questionable; 3) that in any case they often are victims of the clo sure illusion."13 Genetics necessitates an analytical flexibility that re fuses any didacticism and modifies the reading of texts. Little by little, the student acquires a new interpretative approach, which reveals it self closer to a theory of text production than philology.

I admit that this interpretation is pure supposition. However, it is justified by the knowl edge of Haubert's manuscript practice in other contexts.
