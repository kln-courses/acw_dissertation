<plain_text><page sequence="1">PALAEOLITHIC RACES AND THEIR MODERN REPRESENTATIVES By W. J. SOLLAS, D.Sc., F.R.S. Professor of Geology in the University of Oxford Magdalenian Man and the Eskimo In caves where the succession of deposits is complete a com- paratively thin layer of loam, often not more than twenty to thirty inches in thickness, is all that separates the Magdalenian stage from the underlying Solutrian; yet the change in the general character of the industrial cult is complete. The flint implements are less elaborated, ruder in style and lacking in finish ; the elegant Solutrian laurel-leąf points have disappeared, and we meet instead with long thin flakes and splinters which have been converted by a minimum amount of dressing into scrapers, gravers, drills, and other simple tools. It is not to these flints, however, that we must look for the distinctive character of the Magdalenian industry ; they still played an important part, not directly as weapons of the chase, but rather as the implements by which those weapons were made. The new kind of material which had come into use - bone, reindeer's horn, and mammoth's ivory - possessing very different pro- perties from flint, and requiring a different kind of workmanship, effected a revolution in the arts. The arms it furnished to the hunter increased in the number and complication of their forms, and new kinds of implements were devised which added to the comforts of daily life. The stimulus of discovery led to rapid progress in the new industry, and the deposits in the caves reveal three stages in its development, succeeding one another in a definite order from the simpler to the more complex : thus as the characteristic of the first stage we have the simple point, of the second the harpoon with a single row of barbs, and of the third the harpoon with two rows of barbs, one on each side. The simple forms of arrow-head and spear-head which came in with the first stage, but persisted throughout the remainder of the period, are simple cylindrical rods of various dimensions, 16</page><page sequence="2">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 17 terminating at one end in a conical point, and at the other in a base for attachment to the shaft. The base is fashioned in several different ways: very commonly by slicing off the head obliquely to its length, so as to afford a surface for making a simple splice with the shaft ; sometimes, though almost exclu- sively in deposits of the first stage, it is excavated by a wedge- shaped fissure, evidently intended to fit on to a shaií with a correspondingly wedge-shaped extremity ; in some cases this last relation is reversed and the base forms a solid wedge, which was probably inserted into a slit at the end of the shaft. In a few rare examples the wedge is converted into a tongue by which a square-shouldered joint is produced ; there is no better joint, so far as security is concerned, than this, and it is the kind exclusively adopted by the Eskimo and some other hunting tribes at the present day. The union of the head with the shaft was no doubt secured by threads of sinew tightly bound round the joint. Finally there are some simple points with a base which truncates the head trans- versely; perhaps with a view to providing a loose joint, so that the head might readily break off in the wound, its con- nection with the shaft being maintained by a separate cord. Both arrow-heads and spear-heads, especially the latter, are usually adorned with some simple incised design, such as a series of transverse lines, zigzags, or scroll work. This, as Lord Avebury has pointed out in the case of Eskimo weapons, served no doubt as a means of identification. Such marks of ownership are commonly met with on the arrows of existing wild races ; they provide a useful arbiter in the settlement of disputes, such as arise from time to time in battle or the chase. In fig. 5, on the right, two Eskimo are represented as quarrelling over the carcase of a walrus which one of them has slain ; it is to be hoped that the arrow bears the owner's mark. Some of the simple points are scored with a deep longitudinal groove, sometimes called the blood-channel ; it has been sug- gested that this may have been intended to carry poison. In this connection it may be mentioned that some of the interior tribes of British North America make use of poisoned arrow- heads. The poisons are of various kinds, that obtained from the fāngs of the rattlesnake being the commonest and most deadly.1 1 C. Hill Tout, British North America, p. 132 : London, 1907. 2</page><page sequence="3">i8 SCIENCE PROGRESS The simple point presented itself almost ready-made as one of the prongs of the reindeer's horn ; the harpoons of the suc- ceeding stages required more elaborate workmanship. The form with uniserial barbs often ends below in a conical point with a flange on one side only, and in some cases two or three of these heads may have been bound together at the end of the shaft to form a bident or trident for spearing fish. In some well-made examples from Castillo, in Santander, a perforation Fig. I. - Harpoon-heads from Castillo, in San- tander, Spain. exists near the base - probably intended for a connecting thong (fig. i). The harpoons with biserial barbs take a great variety of forms, and near the base frequently swell out into an annular ridge, or two opposed lobes, before terminating in a blunt cone. This, again, is suggestive of a loose union with the shaft, and in one instance the upper angles, where the lobes spring from the head, are deeply incised as though to afford a notch for a connecting thong. The double-barbed harpoons of the Azilian stage, which succeeds the Magdalenian, are per- forated with a fairly large hole, obviously intended for the passage of such a thong. No bows have been discovered in any Magdalenian deposits ; this weapon, if it existed, was almost certainly made of wood. Some of the simple bone-points are of such comparatively small size that they could not have served for spears, and can only be interpreted as arrow-heads. Whatever doubts may be entertained as to the existence ot the bow, there can be none as to the "propulseur" or spear- thrower, an instrument still in use among several wild hunting tribes, including some who at the same time are also in pos- session of the bow. The spear-thrower reduced to its simplest terms is a stick with a recurved tooth at one end ; the spear is laid parallel with the stick, its butt-end resting against the tooth. It is differently held by different races ; the Eskimo rest it between the root of the forefinger and thumb, the ends of these digits holding the spear. By a sweeping movement of the wrist and forearm the spear is discharged, and as the</page><page sequence="4">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 19 fingers close over the handle of the throwing-stick this is swept forwards with great force and rapidity, following and accelerating the spear in its flight (fig. 2). Several Magdalenian spear-throwers have been discovered, chiefly in the caves of Dordogne. They are carved in one piece out of bone or ivory, and adorned with engravings or finely sculptured after some animal form. One of the finest specimens is that represented in fig. 3 - a spirited study of the forepart of an antelope in its skilful rendering, its vigour, and its truth. This is a master- Fig. 2. - The upper figure illustrates the use of the spear-thrower by the Eskimo, the lower one by the Australian. piece of art : to put it to common use would to our eyes seem nothing less than a desecration. There are several objects among the Magdalenian bone im- plements to which it is difficult to assign a use. One of the most interesting of these is the bâton de commandement , as it is termed by De Mortillet. In its simplest form this is a rod of reindeer's horn, perforated with one or more cylindrical holes ; very commonly it consists of a part of the stem of an antler bearing one of the tines. Sometimes it is carved into a simple symmetrical form devoid of ornament, at others it assumes a more elaborate character, and is adorned with incised designs. In several instances the extremity just beyond the perforation</page><page sequence="5">2o SCIENCE PROGRESS is sculptured to represent two heads adossée, a motive not infrequently met with in primitive art. In one instance, on the other hand, the two heads, in this case of mammoth, are opposed face to face. De Mortilleťs explanation of the bâton de commandement is implied in its name, translated " sceptre " by some English Fig. 3. - Throw- ing-stick from Mas d'Azil. writers. One of the commonest forms bears some resemblance to a symbol of office carried by some North American chiefs, and known among them as a poga magati, but this always lacks the characteristic perforations. By some authors it has been regarded as a tent-peg, by others as a drum-stick; but perhaps the strangest sug- gestion of all is due to Dr. Shoetensack,1 who imagines that it was used as a rude kind of fibula. This view has been hailed by Dr. Klaatsch2 as a " glucklicher gedanke," and it seems to be widely accepted in Germany. That a people who had achieved such a mastery over the carving of bone and ivory as the Magdalenians, and who showed such a keen sense of the appro- priate in art, should have fastened their garments by such a clumsy device seems at least unlikely, and expert hunters would scarcely choose to start on the chase with a piece of bone about a foot and a half long dangling from their necks. The Magdalenians were quite capable of making respectable buckles or fibulae, but they probably fastened their dress in quite another fashion. A more plausible explanation, as it seems to me, is that proposed by Prof. Boyd Dawkins, who has compared the bâton with the Eskimo's arrow- straightener. For some reason this view has not been very favourably received by anthropologists either at home or abroad,3 possibly because most of the Eskimo arrow- straighteners exhibited in our museums have been brought 1 O.

Hoernes, Der Diluvial Mensch in Europa, Brunswick, 1903, p. 72.</page><page sequence="6">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 21 from Greenland or other regions where this instrument has obtained its most perfect form and development. Such examples are generally of comparatively small size, skilfully carved out of ivory, and especially distinguished by the form and other characters of the perforation, intended for the insertion of the arrow. It is invariably lozenge-shaped, and, as Mr. H. Balfour points out with just insistence, it passes obliquely through the implement. Both the form and direction of the perforation ensure a good grip of the arrow-shaft, and at the same time in such a manner as to minimise the chances of bruising it during the operation of straightening. In the Magdalenian implement, on the other hand, the hole is always circular or cylindrical, and takes a straight course, at right angles to the two faces. This difference, which impairs to some extent the usefulness of the Magdalenian implement, seemed to me at one time to offer a fatal objection to the identification suggested by Prof. Dawkins ; but it now appears that the Greenland form, with which we are most familiar, is not universal among the Eskimo. Boas has figured an example from Baffin Land, in which the hole is cylindrical, and appar- ently takes a direct and not an oblique course. Between this and the Magdalenian bâtons there is no essential difference; both are arrow-straighteners. There are some other Magda- lenian implements perforated by several holes, which I should have regarded as problematical, but for the fact that Boas also describes a piece of bone, similarly perforated, as an arrow- straightener, and expressly mentions that it is provided with several holes of various diameters in adaptation to the various thicknesses of the arrow-shafts.1 Although the Greenland arrow-straightener is a much superior instrument to the Magdalenian, yet a remarkable resemblance may sometimes be traced in their decorative form, the heads adossée already referred to as a motive in Magdalenian art being a frequent feature in the Eskimo examples. In both cases also the handle of the straightener is incised with line engravings representing animal forms. As connected with the chase, we may mention the bone pins not uncommonly met with in Magdalenian deposits. These, 1 Franz Boas, "The Eskimos of Baffin Land and Hudson Bay "Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist. vol. xv. p. 84, fig. 117, New York, 1901 ; W. J. Solías, Nature, vol. 74, P- 372, fig-, 1906-</page><page sequence="7">22 SCIENCE PROGRESS though inappropriately thick, are supposed to have served for dress fasteners ; but it is extremely unlikely that a people, who were evidently adepts in the art of sewing, would show so great a disregard for valuable skin garments as to drive such rude pegs as these "pins" through them. We shall find a more probable explanation by reference to the Eskimo, who possess similar pins, which they call " taa-poo-ta," and use for skewering to- gether the sides of the wounds inflicted in killing seals or other large animals, with the object of securing the blood, not a drop of which is willingly lost.1 The Algonkian Indians, who live inland, next to the Eskimo, have the same custom. Occasionally the Eskimo make use of a bone plug instead of the " taa-poo-ta " ; it is inserted in the wound as a kind of stopper.2 An ivory peg figured by Piette from Brassempouey, with the remark "use unknown," may perhaps have served the same purpose.3 Whistles made from the phalange of a reindeer, such as in use by North American Indian tribes, have been found in Magdalenian deposits of several caves. A variety of evidence leads to the conclusion that the clothes of the Magdalenian people were made from the skins of animals killed in the chase ; the reindeer probably furnished some of the warmest and most resistant to the weather. That these, after dressing and trimming, were sewn together is suggested by the abundant bone needles which are found strewn through Magdalenian deposits. The needles are remarkably well made, straight and slender, with sharp points and round or elongated eyes. Their variety in size - the length ranging from 37 to 72 mm. - seems to show that the seamstress was particular as to the fineness of her work. In making a needle the first step was to obtain splinters of bone from a reindeer's shoulder-blade, or to cut strips out of the cannon-bone of a horse or deer ; these were then scraped into shape with a flint flake, rubbed smooth and pointed by a grooved piece of sand- stone, and finally drilled by means of a delicately chipped flint awl. The awl was no doubt mounted in some manner, probably by binding it with sinew on to a rod of wood or bone. In drilling holes for arrow-straighteners a large flint borer was 1 W. J. Solías, " On some Eskimo Bone Implements from the East Coast of Greenland," Journ, Anthr. Inst vol. i*. pl. vii. 1880. 8 F. Boas, loc. cit . 8 Piette, DAnthrop. vol. vi. p. 135, fig. 6.</page><page sequence="8">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 23 necessary, and the question arises whether any accessory appara- tus was used, such as the bow drill, so common among many primitive people at the present day. The Eskimo use an ivory bow drill, and if a similar implement had been known to the Magdalenian men we might expect to find examples, preserved in the cave deposits ; none, however, have so far been met with. The bow is not the essential part of the bow drill, but merely a mechanical refinement, ensuring that the bow string is main- tained in uniform tension. The string, twisted round the borer, may be employed alone, its ends being held one in each hand and pulled alternately in opposite directions. This simple method of obtaining rotation, still in use among various wild tribes, was possibly first introduced by the Magdalenians ; the addition of the bow would then have followed later. Domestic utensils are not numerous. A shallow bowl, made out of a fine close-grained sandstone, was found in the cave of La Mouthe, Dordogne ; it is produced at one side into a kind of shelf, which affords a handle, and the base is engraved with a rough sketch of a wild goat. It has been interpreted as a lamp, and it is certainly not unlike some of the stone lamps used by the Eskimo to warm their winter houses. These lamps give no smoke when carefully tended, and this suggests the question whether they may not have been used to illuminate the dark recesses of those caves which are adorned by mural paintings. Personal ornaments have been found in great variety. In addition to the teeth of bear, horse, and reindeer, sea-shells, and even fossils, all perforated for suspension, we encounter pendants of various forms carved out of bone or ivory, some of which are of especial interest on account of their precise resemblance to similar ornaments in use among the Eskimo, who attach them to needle-cases, housewife bags, and sometimes as tassels to their dress. Long, thin bone or ivory rods also occur, very carefully shaped and bearing incised designs ; they closely resemble in form and ornament the hairpins still in use among the Eskimo. A small broken ornament with little pit-like mark- ings found in the Magdalenian of Kulna,1 Moravia, recalls some objects of unknown use which the Eskimo women carry attached to their "housewives." The art of the period is most fully expressed in sculpture 1 J. Knies, Časopis muzejního Spolkn v Olomuci , taf. xiv.</page><page sequence="9">24 SCIENCE PROGRESS and line engraving. It seems to be generally assumed that some of the later paintings on the walls of caves already referred to really belong to the Magdalenian age, but this is a question which awaits further investigation. The line en- gravings, sometimes deeply cut, sometimes faintly scratched in, are frequently met with on the sides of bone implements, more rarely on stones ; towards the close of the period the designs become conventional and geometric, but the earlier drawings, which are fortunately the most numerous, are faithful delinea- tions of the contemporary animals ; one of the earliest dis- covered and best known is the famous mammoth from the rock shelter of La Madeleine, which has always been regarded with especial interest, not only as an evidently faithful portrait of an extinct animal drawn from life, but as confirming in an unexpected manner the conclusion obtained from other evidence that palaeolithic man was familiar with this animal in the living state. None of the characteristic features of the mammoth have escaped the artist's observation : the profile of the head, the great curved tusks, and swinging trunk, the coating of long hair, the little eye and large half-opened mouth, and the peculiar gait indicated by the position of the kneeless hind-legs have all been rendered with convincing truth - so much so that we feel as though an apology were due to the artist when we add that the fidelity of his sketch is confirmed by independent evidence, including that afforded by the complete and well preserved specimens of the mammoth found in the frozen soil of Siberia. The reindeer is a favourite subject, and has provoked some of the cleverest sketches. The horse, supposed to be Przevalsky's species, is frequently represented, and its frisky colt is drawn in characteristic attitudes. Several studies are known of the bison, and one in particular from Laugerie Basse is of special interest, since it represents, behind a grazing bull, unconscious of impending evil, a Magdalenian hunter, crawl- ing on the ground with a spear in his right hand which he is about to throw. The human figure is not well drawn, so that no trustworthy conclusion can be deduced from it ; it shows a large powerful lower jaw with an angular chin, and a curiously peaked roof to the skull; a hatching of simple lines represents the hair of the head, and since similar lines are distributed over the legs and body it has been conjectured</page><page sequence="10">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 25 that these parts of the body also were hairy. Sketches of several other naked human figures are known - as, for instance, the femme au renne from Laugerie basse, which again shows indications of a growth of hair over the thighs and abdomen. A broken arrow-straightener from La Madeleine bears a sketch of a standing human figure, evidently naked ; it is diagrammatic, but faithful, and shows a complete absence of any tendency to steatopygy. The profile of a man-like form found at Mas d'Azil is distinguished by such an extraordinary projecting face that Piette thought it might represent an anthropomorphic ape ; it has a projecting muzzle not unlike that which we may attribute Fig. 4. - Reindeer and Salmon incised on a piece of horn from Lorthet. to Neandertal man, but is without any other features of re- semblance. A human face with very oblique eyes cut on a piece of reindeer's horn found in the cave of Rochebertier recalls the faces which figure on the doorposts of some of the houses of the North American Indians. Of the remaining animal forms which find representation we may mention the ibex, seals, geese, trout, pike, and salmon. An admirable drawing of salmon, in various attitudes, lazily disporting themselves in the water, is reproduced in the illustration (fig. 4). The sculptures in bone and ivory afford some of the finest examples of Magdalenian art; the bone dagger from Laugerie basse, with its lifelike rendering of the reindeer, artistically adapted to form the handle, is a famous example. The same</page><page sequence="11">26 SCIENCE PROGRESS cave has furnished several other daggers; one has the figure of a mammoth for the hilt, another that of some great carnivore. Some of the sculptured figures which have been regarded as the handles of daggers are possibly not of this nature ; the Abbé Brueil believes that they were all intended simply and solely as images of the animals they represent, and he is inclined to think that magic influence was attributed to them: there is no doubt a considerable amount of truth in this view, and it may very well apply to a sculptured mammoth found in the cave of Bruniquel, but scarcely to the reindeer hilted dagger of Laugerie basse. As another instance of an animal form carved without any apparent ulterior purpose may be mentioned the head of a musk ox, found in the Kesserloch, near Thayngen, Switzerland. Most of the sculpture, however, is decorative; as additional instances we may cite a pendant carved with the figure of a Saiga antelope, the same animal as that which is sculptured in so masterly a manner on the spear-thrower mentioned on p. 20 (fig. 3). The apposed heads of bison at the extremity of an arrow-straightener may also be recalled here. The engravings and carved figures illustrate in a remarkable manner the natural history of the Magdalenian age ; and their evidence is in complete harmony with that derived from a study of the associated bones. The fauna includes among others the following : Reindeer, stag ( Cervus elafhus), the great Irish deer ( Cervus megaceros), bison, horse, ass, musk-ox (now confined to arctic North America), Saiga antelope (now confined to the steppes of Russia), glutton (now distributed over lands bordering the Arctic Ocean), arctic hare (Alpine and Arctic regions) ; piping hare ( Lagomys pusillus, an inhabitant of the Asiatic steppes), lemming (restricted to the northern parts of Europe). It is evidently a mixed fauna, containing some forms characteristic of the steppe, others of the tundra. At an early period in the study of palaeolithic remains observers were led by the presence of the cold-loving species of the tundra to look to the Arctic regions for the surviving representatives of reindeer men. Pruner Bey was one of the first to identify the Magdalenians with the Mongolians, though on somewhat in- sufficient grounds. He was followed by Hamy,1 who asserted that it is solely among Arctic people, Lapps, Eskimos, and Chukchis, that we find the same customs, weapons, and im- 1 E. T. Hamy, Précis de Paléontologie Humaine , Paris, 1870, p. 366.</page><page sequence="12">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 27 plements as those of the Magdalenian age. These races, he remarks, continue down to our own days, in the circumpolar regions, the age of the reindeer as it existed in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. A similar view was subsequently supported by Prof. Boyd Dawkins,1 who pointed to the Eskimo as the one race which makes the closest approach to the Magdalenian in the character of its art, implements, and mode of life. Of late years, however, this conclusion has been strongly contested. Laloy remarks : " Cette théorie est absolutement contredit par les faits " 2 ; Steensby, the latest writer on the origin of the Eskimo, dismisses it as fantastic and impossible.3 In face of such conflicting judgments it becomes necessary to examine this question in some detail. If we can find an existing race which may fairly be regarded as the lineal descendants of the Magdalenians, we shall have connected two dissevered ends in human history, thus linking together by a single explanation the fate of one race and the origin of another ; but the very consciousness of our desire for continuity must warn us against too facile an acceptance of testimony. As a useful preliminary to our inquiry we may begin with a brief sketch of the habits and mode of life of the inhabitants of the North American tundra. The belt of barren land which is known as the tundra borders the Arctic Ocean both in the Old World and the New: it supports a scanty vegetation of mosses and lichens, together with a few trees, such as the arctic willow, dwarf birch, and two species of conifers, which are chiefly found in the neighbourhood of lakes and water- courses. Towards the interior the tundra is succeeded by a forest zone characterised by pines and other conifers, but including patches of willow, poplar, and birch. Beyond the forest follows the great prairie or steppe. The men who inhabit these regions are the Red Indians4 and the 1 W.

This author is mistaken in asserting that in Greenland decoration is confined to lines and points. 3 H. P. Steensby, Om Eskimokulturens Oprindelse , Copenhagen, 1905, pp. 1-2 19. This work contains a very full bibliography. 4 A pedantic objection has been raised to the use of this name on the ground that it is applied to a people who are neither Indians nor red : " red," however, is a term with very wide meaning, and there is a good historic reason for "Indian" ; the nomenclature is consecrated by usage, and cannot lead to any serious misconception.</page><page sequence="13">28 SCIENCE PROGRESS Eskimo,1 both alike members of the Leiotrichi. The Eskimo occupy the Arctic coast from Greenland to Alaska, and even beyond, extending into the Aleutian Islands and the extreme north-east of Asia, as far as Kolyuchin Bay.4 They number, all told, according to Kurl Hassert's estimate made in 1891, about 40,000 individuals. The Chukchi and Kamchadals, character- ised by similar habits and mode of life, but belonging to a different race, are found in Kamtchatka and the north-east extremity of Siberia. Wherever they occur the Eskimo are distinguished by a Temarkable uniformity in bodily characters, habits, implements, language, and mode of life. Yet they have no national unity, and completely realise the anarchic ideal of government; they are without chiefs, and even the " angakok " or medicine-man possesses far less authority or influence than his nearest homologue, the Asiatic shaman. The only differentiation of labour is that between men's work and women's work. Some fifty dialects have been distinguished in their language, but the most unlike of these, i.e. the dialect spoken on the east coast of Greenland and that on the Asiatic side of Behring Strait, do not differ more than, say, English and German. Thalbitzer,3 the latest writer on the subject, remarks that the Eskimo language, so far as it is known, stands apart from all others. No one has yet succeeded in discovering any language, •either in Asia or among the American Indians, which might possibly have been originally related to it. Their physical characters bear the same testimony, and stamp them as a race apart ; their resemblance to the Mongolians, though marked in many respects, is no greater than might be •expected to exist between two races which are both included ■within the Leiotrichi. The Eskimo are of short stature, the mean height of the Greenlanders being 1,621 mm. Their hair is absolutely black, •coarse, and straight like a horse's mane. Their skin is reddish brown in colour; smooth and full to the touch, like a Negro's. 1 As in the case of many a Scottish clan, the Eskimo owe their name to their «enemies, the adjacent Indians: it means "eaters of raw flesh," though as a matter of fact the Eskimo generally cook their food, unless prevented by necessity. Their own name for themselves is Innuit - i.e. men. 9 W. H. Dd.ll, Joum. R. Geogr . Soc. vol. iii. p. 568, 1881. 3 W.

The face is long and orthognathous ; the nose both long and narrow : it is indeed the most leptorhine as yet observed. The head is long, high, and wall-sided, with a pent-roof-like summit. The cranial' capacity is great ; according to Duckworth, 1,550 cc., thus surpassing some of the most civilised peoples of Europe.1 The Indians, who succeed the Eskimo towards the interior, occupy a broad belt of wood and tundra stretching right across the continent ; they are divided into two great races - the Algonkian on the east and the Athapascan on the west. In mode of life there is a considerable amount of resemblance between the Eskimo and these northern Indians ; and some of the Algonkians possess very similar bodily characters, except as regards stature, the Algonkians being a tall people. They are also less dolichocephalic, though towards the east they make a close approach to the Eskimo in this respect.2 The other animals which inhabit the tundra and the pine woods are the fox, wolf, bear, and marten ; squirrels, hare, beaver, and beaver-rat; the bison, which is restricted to the tundra, and never enters the woods; the mountain sheep, which is found in the Rocky Mountains, the elk or moose and the reindeer. There are also abundant water-fowl, and the waters swarm with fish, especially salmon, sturgeon, pike, and the white fish ( Coregonus albus). The last named, much esteemed for its fine flavour, contributes largely to the sustenance of the Indians during the winter; it is the chief food of the Ojibways (Algonkian), who call it the " reindeer of the water." 1 Brierly, however, from an examination of seventeen skulls found in Green- land, obtained an average of only 1,357 cc. J. Brierly, Journ . Anthr. Inst. 1906, vol. xxxvi, p. 120. 2 The taxonomie position of the American races may be indicated by the following attempt at classification. The Leiotrichi include two groups, one characterised by finer and the other by coarser hair (Deniker, "Essai d'une Classification des Races Humaines," Bull . Soc . ď Anthr ., 1889). We will dis- tinguish them as the Leptocomae and the Pachycomae. The Pachycomae may be subdivided into the Mongoloids, with a small and depressed nose, and the Americans, with a large and salient nose. The Americans then fall into the following groups : Dolichocephalic ; long face ; short stature . . Eskimo Mesaticocephalic ; „ „ . Fuegian, Botocado Brachycephalic ; nose aquiline ; tall or medium height Redskins (the Eastern Algon- kians are dolichocephalic) „ nose straight ( tall . . Patagonia^ or upturned ( short . . South American Indians.</page><page sequence="15">30 SCIENCE PROGRESS The passage of the sun across the equator sets a great part of this animal world in motion. The reindeer, on which the very existence of man depends in these inhospitable regions of the north, leaves the forest belt at about the end of May and travels northward over the tundra in search of fresh vegeta- tion. It marches in herds numbering many thousands of individuals, reaches the margin of the Arctic Ocean just before the winter ice breaks up, and finds a passage over this to the islands lying off the coast, which furnish its most northerly feeding-grounds. There, isolated front the continent after the disappearance of the ice by the open sea, it enjoys the short Arctic summer, and fares well, growing sleek and fat, till on the approach of winter it turns south again, crosses the sea as soon as the surface is covered with fresh ice, and regains its home in the woods. In these annual oscillatory migrations it is exposed to continual danger: wolves are never very far off ; from the woods through the tundra the Indian follows the herds as far as the limits set by the Eskimo occupation, or if farther at his own peril ; beyond this limit the hunt is continued by the Eskimo himself. There is no close time for the reindeer, but it is more particularly during the return journey, when the animal is in good condition, and accompanied by its newly- foaled young, that its flesh is sought. In the case of the rein- deer both Eskimo and Indian pursue the same methods of capture : it is waylaid at spots where its trail crosses a river, or it is driven by noise and alarms in the direction of con- vergent stone fences, which extend for great distances, and lead to a lake or watercourse, where the hunter Waits concealed in his birch-bark canoe or his kayak, ready to dispatch victim after victim with his spear. By this latter method, when the plot is well arranged and the herd not too large, not a single animal will escape. The reindeer flesh is the favourite meat of Indian and Eskimo alike : every part of the animal is eaten, even the contents of the stomach ; the blood is boiled, and makes a rich brown soup, greatly esteemed as a dainty ; sometimes the half-digested vegetable food from the stomach is mixed with the blood before boiling - a welcome addition in a region where plants edible by man are scarce or altogether absent. The marrow is extracted from the bones, which are then pounded small and the fat boiled out. The autumn hunting affords a rich store of reindeer meat,</page><page sequence="16">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 31 which is dried and set aside as provision for the winter. The mode of curing, at least among the Indians, is as follows : The flesh is first cut in thin slices and dried in the sun, or over the smoke of a slow fire. It is then pounded between stones, and finally a quantity of melted fat - about one-third of its bulk - is poured over it. The result is the well-known pem- mican. If carefully protected from damp it will keep good for several years. The horns of the animal are used to make fishing-spears and fish-hooks, ice-chisels, and other implements. The skin is carefully dressed, cut into shape, and made up into winter clothing. A shin-bone, split longitudinally, is used as a scraper to remove superfluous hair and fat. The undressed hide furnishes a substitute for rope. It is cut into long strips of various thicknesses, and twisted into thongs for deer-snares, bow-strings, net-lines, fishing-nets, and snow shoes. The tendon of the dorsal muscle is split up into fine threads for sewing. During the absence of the reindeer - i.e. for about eight or nine months of the year - the Indians of the tundra live chiefly on white fish, which is caught by hook or net: in winter, when all the lakes and waterways are thickly frozen over, the nets or hooks are introduced through holes broken in the ice. The Eskimo hunter, while possessing much in common with the Indian, is distinguished by greater aptitude and by special methods of his own. He represents the triumph of human adaptation to the changing conditions of a rigorous climate; by the variety and ingenuity of his implements, weapons, and devices he has brought the art of hunting to its very highest state of differentiation, and in the exercise of this art he stands supreme among all the hunting races of the world. In summer (July to September), when the sea is' open, he lives along the coast, dwelling in tents made of reindeer skin or seal's skin, and hunts the seal with harpoon and bladder from his kayak, using a spear-thrower to hurl the harpoon. In some localities, as at Point Barrow, he also goes a-whaling at this season. The whales migrate towards the north at the beginning of summer, and return about the end of August, moving southwards to the Mackenzie: on the return journey they are attacked from umiaks (large skin-covered boats), con- taining as many as twelve men, all armed with harpoons. When a whale appears, as many harpoons as possible are cast into it, and endeavours are made to drive it towards the shallow water</page><page sequence="17">32 SCIENCE PROGRESS off the shore. The whale is valued not only for its flesh and blubber, but for a variety of useful purposes : threads of "whale- bone " are used for making nets, its jaws serve as runners for sledges, and, when wood is scarce, its ribs are used for rafters or tent-poles. Fishing is also carried on in the inland waters, chiefly by children, women, and old men: the fish are taken by hooks, nets, and barbed spears or harpoons. In dangerous places, such as rapids or whirlpools, the sport requires great skill and nerve, and is undertaken by able-bodied hunters. Birds are shot with a fowling spear, or captured by a kind of miniature bolas ; their eggs are collected by the children. In autumn (August and September), when the reindeer are on the homeward road, the best hunting of the year begins, and a heavy tax is levied on these animals, to provide not only for present eating, but also a sufficient store for the winter season. Salmon fishing is also actively pursued, and large quantities of these fish are preserved for future use. At the beginning of winter (October) the Eskimo go into their winter house, a solidly constructed dwelling capable of containing several families. It is sometimes built of stones, sometimes of timber, and in each case thickly covered over with a layer of earth. The wooden house is ingeniously designed, with a skeleton of upright pillars and transverse balks, to which the boards forming the walls and roof are affixed. The timber is furnished by driftwood found on the coast : in some localities this driftwood is so scarce that it may take three or even five years to collect as much as will build a single house or provide the framework of a boat. It is said that these winter houses are the best that could be devised, under the circum- stances, to meet the rigours of an arctic climate. They are entered by a long covered passage, and warmed by blubber lamps (these are simple variously shaped bowls of soapstone, sandstone, or other rock, in which blubber, usually obtained from the seal, is burnt). The houses are so proof against cold that, with these lamps, a temperature of 20o C. is maintained. Speaking of the Greenland houses, which are built of stone, Hans Egede remarks: "I cannot forbear taking Notice, that though in one of these Houses there be ten or twenty Train- Lamps, one does not perceive the Steam or Smoak thereof to fill these small Cottages: The Reason, I imagine, is the Care they take in trimming those Lamps - viz. they take dry Moss,</page><page sequence="18">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 33 rubbed very small, which they lay on one Side of the Lamp, which, being lighted, burns softly, and does not cause any Smoak, if they do not lay it on too thick, or in Lumps. This Fire gives such a Heat, that it not only serves to boil their Victuals, but also heats their Rooms to that Degree, that it is as hot as a Bagnio. But for those who are not used to this Way of firing, the Smell is very disagreeable, as well by the Number of burning Lamps, all fed with Train-Oil, as on account of divers Sorts of raw Meat, Fishes and Fat, which they heap up in their Habitations ; but especially their Urine-Tubs smell most insufferably, and strikes one, that is not accustomed to it, to the very Heart."1 On entering into winter quarters the Eskimo begins to reward himself for the labours of the year : reindeer meat, seal's blubber, and dried salmon furnish forth a long succession of Gargantuan feasts, which continue as long as the provisions last. When they give out - and in good times this will not be till the darkest days are past - hunting must perforce begin again. By this time the ground has long been frozen hard; rivers, lakes, and the sea are covered with a continuous sheet of smooth winter ice. Hares may now be trapped ; the musk-ox, which never leaves the tundra, is an easy prey, but never eaten, except as a last resort ; the arctic bear may be engaged in fight, and this calls for all the skill and courage shared by the two men who undertake the combat. But the main food of many Eskimo tribes, both now and all through the greater part of the year, is provided by the seal. There are four kinds of seal in the Arctic Ocean, and two of them extend northwards beyond the Arctic Circle, as far as Grinnell Land. One or other species is fairly plentiful up to lat 60o N. ; its favourite haunts are deep fjords, covered for nine months of the year with smooth ice. It makes holes in the ice in order to obtain air to breathe, and in summer it crawls up through larger holes on to the ice to bask in the sun. In spring it feeds its young in a hole under the snow, and when the snow has melted away it returns to the ice. The walrus, which affords a favourite food, is far less widely distributed. It is most dainty in its choice of a dwelling- place ; the sea must not be too deep, the bottom must be covered with abundant shellfish, and certain relations must exist between the sea-currents and the ice. 1 Hans Egede, A Description of Greenland , London, 1745, P- 117- 3</page><page sequence="19">34 SCIENCE PROGRESS In late winter and spring, the Eskimo, for the most part, leave the land and spread in small groups over the ice, travelling by dog-sledges along the coast, and never re- maining very long in one place. They live at this time in snow houses, warmed by blubber lamps, and hunt seals, chiefly by the " maupak " method - that is, the hunter sits down by the side of an air-hole and waits till a seal comes up to breathe, when he despatches it with a harpoon : as the year advances, the " arpok " method is also used, the seal in this case being killed as it lies basking at midday in the sun. The dress of the Eskimo, which is much the same for the women as the men, consists of short trousers and a tunic ending above in a hood to cover the head. The trousers are sometimes continued downwards into stocking feet. Of boots, which are well made, they have a great variety, to be worn according to the weather. Shoes with very ingeniously con- trived soles are made for walking on the ice. Fur gloves or mittens are also worn. An overall for use in wet weather is made from the intestines of the seal. The intestine is thoroughly cleaned, inflated with air, and hung up to dry. It is then carefully flattened and rolled up tight, like a spool of ribbon. When required for use it is slit up longitudinally, and makes a strip about three to five inches wide. The margin is pared, and several strips are sewn together into the desired form. These overalls are extremely light, not above six or seven ounces in weight. The transparency of the seal's gut renders it useful for other purposes : it makes an excellent substitute for glass as a window-pane. The Eskimo wear their dress only when out of doors; in their houses they go stark naked, and the first hospitality offered to a visitor is an invitation to strip. Notwithstanding the hardships of the struggle which the Es- kimo wage with reluctant Nature for their existence, they were at one time by no means a miserable race ; they made them- selves comfortable in a frozen region where other men would have perished, took a healthy enjoyment in life, and were dis- tinguished by many estimable domestic and social qualities. The intrusion of the white man has brought with it its usual evil blight - poverty, sickness, selfishness, and loss of self-respect. It would be beyond our province to give instances, but one</page><page sequence="20">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 35 case where a different result might have been expected may be cited from Rink. He writes : - " On approaching these places [Ny Herrnhut and Lichtenfels] the visitor, on being told that each of them contains about a hundred natives and two or three missionary families, will be at a loss to make out where the former have their abodes. The mission lodges are pretty spacious, and for Greenland even stately in appearance. The stranger will probably be surprised on being informed that these buildings are only inhabited by missionaries, because he discovers nothing like human dwellings anywhere else. Then his attention will be called to something resembling dunghills scattered over low rocks and partly overgrown with grass, and he will be sur- prised to learn that the native population live in these dens." 1 At one time these people had good winter houses. The number of Eskimo is diminishing, especially in Green- land, and if the race should become extinct, the country will remain uninhabited, for white men alone could not live there. Detailed descriptions of the implements, weapons, and mis- cellaneous possessions of the Eskimo may be found in the Annual Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology, published in Washington: a brief enumeration will suffice for our purpose. The kayak, umiak, salmon-fork, bird spear, spear-thrower, bow and arrow, bird bolas, and skin tent are chiefly used in summer; dog sledges, harpoons, spears, winter houses, and blubber lamps during the winter ; besides these there are bow drills, arrow straighteners, needles and needle-cases, bone pins, tool-bags with bone handles, buckles, belt fasteners, snow picks, hair combs, and a vast variety of other miscellaneous objects. The adjacent Indians possess the birch-bark canoe in two forms, a larger corresponding to the Eskimo's umiak, and a smaller corresponding to the kayak, which is sometimes covered in for as much as three-quarters of its length ; snow shoes, sledges for travelling over snow, drawn by women assisted by dogs, the bow and arrow, spear-thrower, ice-chisel, fish-hooks, nets, and fishing-spears : to ensure their recovery the arrows are sometimes attached by a long thread to the bow, and a line held at one end in the hand is sometimes attached to the fishing-spear. In some cases, indeed, as among the Ojibways and Shoshones, a rudimentary harpoon was 1 H. Rink, Danish Greenland ' London, 1877, p. 181.</page><page sequence="21">36 SCIENCE PROGRESS used, provided with a point which became detached from its immediate union with the shaft on entering its victim, a con- nection however being still secured by a long intervening line. The Eskimo harpoon is a further development of the same device: it is distinguished from all others by the introduction of an additional movable segment between the detachable point and the shaft. This intermediate piece is articulated with the shaft by a ball-and-socket joint, and held in position by two stout thongs of reindeer hide which pass through holes drilled in it and the shaft. If now we turn to the Magdalenian implements, we must admit that a large number of those most characteristic of the Eskimo are not to be found among them. The sledge, the kayak, and the fully developed harpoon are all missing, and since in each of these bone or ivory occurs as an essential part, they should have left some trace of their existence, had the Magdalenians possessed them. This argument does not apply, however, to the birch-bark canoe and wooden sledge of the Athapascans and Algonkians, for, as we have seen, wood is a perishable material. The sledge, the kayak, and the harpoon of the Eskimo are all highly specialised instruments, and we should scarcely expect to find the remote ancestors of the race in full possession of the completely developed Eskimo cult as it now exists. When we examine the various kinds of objects which are common to the Eskimo and Magdalenians, we cannot fail to remark a surprising amount of resemblance between them in detail. There is no essential difference between the more primitive Eskimo arrow-straighteners and those of the Magda- lenians ; the bone arrow-heads are often strikingly similar, and this similarity extends to those used by the Indians, especially as regards the character of the ownership marks ; the bone hairpins of the Magdalenians may be matched among those of the Eskimo, and the lobate ivory pendants, sometimes heart- shaped, which both races possess, are almost identical in form. These are used by the Eskimo as ornamental appendages to fur bags, " housewives " or clothing. Not much stress can be laid on the bone needles^ for these are of almost world-wide distribution, but the bone pins or taapootas seem to be more characteristic. The barbed bone spear-head of the Magdalenian more closely resembles that of the Eskimo than of any other</page><page sequence="22">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 37 people: that in use among the Fuegians is simpler and ruder in form ; but it is by no means certain that the Fuegians should be omitted from this comparison. The spear-thrower is common to the Magdalenians, Eskimo, Indians, and many other races, including the Australians^ and thus does not count for much; nor should we omit to point out that the form of the Magdalenian implement is very differ- ent from that of the Eskimo. The sculpture of figures in the round presents many remarkable analogies, the reindeer, mammoth and musk-ox of the Magdalenians finding parallels in the whales, seals, and bears of the Eskimo, though on the ground of art superiority must be allowed to the more ancient race. The same is true of the line-engravings, with which both adorned their imple- ments. The Magdalenian sketches are always the more realistic, the Eskimo the more conventional. There is also a difference m?,,, ť-* Fig. 5. - Drawings on Eskimo bow-drills. On the left a man gathering berries, in the middle two boys playing football, on the right hunter quarrelling over the possession of game. in motive. The Magdalenian artist was an artist for pure love of art - he took pleasure in the graceful form and attitudes of the reindeer and delighted in representing it ; the Eskimo, on the other hand, is more interested in story-telling, his drawings show a strong tendency towards picture writing, and almost achieve it (fig. 5). The difference will be perceived at a glance on comparing the well-known figure of a feeding reindeer from the Kesslerloch, near Thaingen, with the drawings engraved on an Eskimo arrow-straightener preserved in the British Museum and represented by Prof. Boyd Dawkins in Cave Hunters , p. 354. In the one our admiration is aroused by the truthful outline and artistic feeling of the sketch ; in the other our pleasure is less aesthetic but perhaps more intellectual: we are impressed by the skill with which the animals are generalised - the detail is as sparing as in Egyptian hieroglyphs and the symbolisation is just as correct - but our chief interest is in the event which the drawing records. In the one case the object of the drawing</page><page sequence="23">38 SCIENCE PROGRESS is a reindeer, in the other a reindeer hunt. The hunters, disguised with reindeer horns, are stalking the unsuspecting herd. This difference is essentially similar to that which we have already observed in the case of Solutrian and Bushman art, though the Bushmen have not carried generalisation so far. We should perhaps scarcely have expected this order of development, though now that it is suggested good reasons can be found for it. Children often display a remarkable aptitude for rough portraiture ; the illustration (fig. 6) records the spontaneous efforts of an untaught English girl at the age of seven or eight. They are admitted by their victims to be excellent caricatures, but the artist showed no signs of unusual ability with her pencil Fig. 6. - Artistic efforts of childhood. in later years. A stage of imitative art may thus occur in the childhood both of the individual and the race. On a general review of the facts it would appear that, allowing for the long interval which separates the Magdalenian from the Eskimo in time, there is a sufficient degree of similarity between the products of their industry and art to furnish a prima-facie case in favour of an alliance by cult. The evidence is by no means convincing ; and if, proceeding a step further, we begin to speculate on the consanguinity of the two races, we are met with geographical difficulties, not to mention others, which are amply sufficient to justify those who maintain a sceptical attitude. There still remains, however, one class of evidence to which as yet we have made no allusion : it is that relating to the bodily characteristics of Magdalenian man. Such of his skeletal</page><page sequence="24">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 39 remains as are preserved in our museums were, until recently, surprisingly few ; many more, no doubt, have been encountered by explorers of caves, but unfortunately many of these persons were more intent on enriching their collections with " curiosities " than on scientific investigation, and we have to deplore, in consequence, the loss of much precious material, which has been ruthlessly destroyed because it was not fitted to adorn a cabinet. Of late years, however, the systematic excavation of the caves at Mentone under the generous patronage of the Prince of Monaco has put us in possession of several well-preserved skeletons, so that our knowledge of one part of the Magdalenian population of Europe has now been placed on a secure basis. The material at our disposal indicates the contemporaneous existence of two distinct races, one represented by the giants of Mentone, the Crô Magnon race ; and the other by a man of comparatively low stature, whose skeleton was found at Chancelade. The Crô Magnon race was recognised as Mongoloid by Pruner Bey,1 but it presents several very remarkable characters which do not find any close analogy among any existing people. Skeletons belonging to it were first discovered in i868, in making a cutting for a railway line from Limoges to Agen at Crô Magnon (whence the name), near Les Eyzies, in the valley of the Vézère ; additional discoveries have since been made from time to time, the most recent being afforded by the grottes de Grimaldi, which have yielded six additional skeletons.2 These were found under circumstances which show that the Crô Magnon people buried their dead ; some were interred over a hearth, others in a grave, or in a rudimentary tomb, made by placing stones on edge for the walls, and roofing over with slabs. The corpse was buried, possibly dressed in the clothes, and certainly adorned with the ornaments, which had been worn during life; these include perforated shells of Nassa neritea, perforated teeth of deer, vertebrae of fish such as salmon, and carved pendants, representing together the remains of a neck- lace or collar. The perforated shells are sometimes found on the skull, and seem to have been sewn on to a cap. Flint implements of Magdalenian type are also found in the burial place. 1 Pruner Bey in Lartet &amp; Christy, Reliquia Aquitanien 1868, p. 88. * Verneau, Les Grottes de Grimaldi , 1906.</page><page sequence="25">40 SCIENCE PROGRESS The bodily characters presented by all the remains of skeletons are of a very uniform kind. The stature ranged from 1,750 mm. to 1,890 mm., with a mean of from 1,820 to 1,870 mm. (6 ft. to 6 ft. 3 in.). The cranial capacity is very great, ranging from 1,590 to 1,715 cc. The head is dolichocephalic, and thus not in harmony with the face, which is broad and short (index from 63*2 to 63 -4) ; the glabella and brow ridges are well marked, the orbits rectangular and very deficient in height (index from 61 *4 to 667); the nose is depressed at the root, but rises rapidly, and is long and narrow, or leptorhine (index from 45-9 to 56*9). A race distinguished by tall stature, a short face and depressed orbits was certainly not Eskimo, nor does it appear to be repre- sented among the Athapascans or Algonkians, whether living or fossil. The Crô Magnon was the first discovered of the two races, and for a long time afforded the only evidence we possessed as to the physical characters of Magdalenian man. Our knowledge of the Chancelade race is bąsed on a single skeleton found on October 10, 1888. It lay buried in the deposits of a rock shelter on the left bank of a rivulet called the Beauronne, 7 kilometers north-west of Perigueux, in the commune of Chancelade. The remains of a rich Pleistocene fauna, flint implements of Magdalenian type, as well as implements of bone and reindeer's horn, were found associated with it. It rested on a rocky floor at a depth of 1*64 meters from the surface of the soil ; overlying it were first a hearth and associated débris, 37 cm. thick ; then a sterile layer, 32 cm. thick; next another hearth and débris, 40 cm. thick; and finally a superficial layer of cave earth, 53 cm. thick. We owe a masterly anatomical study of the skeleton to Dr. Testut, who states that it represents a man of low stature, only 1,500 mm. in height, with a large skull (capacity 1,700 cc.) having the characteristic Eskimo form : a comparison which is borne out by every feature in detail ; it is wall-sided, with a pent- like roof, and dolichocephalic, with an index (72*02) almost the same as that of the Eskimo (mean value 7172); the face is remarkable for its length, and there is à close correspondence in the relation between the length and the breadth, or the facial index, which amounts to 72^8 in the Chancelade and 72*2 in the Eskimo skull ; the nose also is long and narrow, its index (42^5) agreeing closely with that of the Eskimo (42 "62) ; the orbit is</page><page sequence="26">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 41 wide and high, just as in the Eskimo, its index being 86*97, and that of the Eskimo 87 '8 ; the palate is fairly long in comparison with its breadth, with an index of 6yg, that of the Eskimo being 68 '4 ; finally the naso-malar angle of Flower, which measures the recession of the face behind the orbits, is very large, attaining the value of 145 : in this respect also it makes a nearer approach to the Eskimo, with a value of 144, than to any other known race. The evidence could scarcely be more definite; the osteological characters of the Eskimo, which are of a very special kind, are repeated by the Chancelade skeleton so completely as to leave no reasonable doubt that it represents the remains of a veritable Eskimo, who lived in southern France during the Magdalenian age.1 In North America, as we have seen, a tall Indian race im- mediately succeeds the Eskimo towards the interior; and in Europe a tall Crô Magnon race was associated with the short Chancelade people. If we have rightly identified the two short races one with the other, we shall next be tempted to suppose that some close bond of blood may have existed between the two tall ones. There are, indeed, some characters which they possess in common, the Algonkians, in the eastern part of the continent, having long heads, like the Crô Magnon men, and this in itself appears to be a remarkable fact, when we consider the rare occurrence of dolichocephaly among the Leiotrichi. The short faces and depressed orbits of the Crô Magnon men mark them off, however, as a distinct race. The Magdalenian cult extended east from Mentone, through France, Switzerland, Germany, Bohemia, Moravia, and as far as Russian Poland, and it has been traced northwards to Kent's Hole in Devon and Creswell Crag in Derbyshire. Future discoveries alone can inform us as to the relative distribution of the two races, who probably shared this territory between them, but it is safe to suppose that the Chancelade race occupied the more northern stations, though all that is certainly known is its occurrence in southern France. The question next arises as to how the existing Eskimo acquired their present distribution. The Magdalenians are the latest completely palaeolithic race which inhabited Europe : their successors on this soil, apart from the Azilians, were the neolithic folk, who brought with 1 L. Testut, " Recherches Anthropologiques sur le Squelette Quaternaire de Chance lade, Dordogne," Bull . de la Soc. ďAnthr . de Lyon^ tom. viii., 1889.</page><page sequence="27">42 SCIENCE PROGRESS them a pastoral or agricultural mode of life. It is highly probable that these neolithic folk were already in existence, previous to their entrance into the Magdalenian area, and if so, the time was almost certain to arrive when by a natural increase in numbers they would begin to exert a pressure on adjacent tribes. The chase is extravagant in the demands it makes upon territory : possibly a hundred farmers could exist on the land which would only support a single hunter. Thus, from the very nature of their industry the neolithic people could scarcely fail to grow strong numerically, and consequently capable of forcing their way into fertile regions in face of whatever resistance the hunters might oppose. Simultaneously with this pressure from behind, an attraction may well have arisen in front, for towards the close of the Magdalenian age a steady amelioration of climate was in progress which especially affected the temperate zone ; as a consequence the sub-arctic fauna which supplied the Magdalenian hunters with so large a part of their food, especially that important member of it, the reindeer, so highly esteemed by Indian and Eskimo alike, was shifting its limits towards the north. In this connection we may recall the fact that Magdalenian stations are known to occur well within the limits of the greatest extension of the ancient ice, as for instance at several localities in Switzerland, and .at Cresswell Crag in' England. The cold fauna, represented by fossil remains of the reindeer, musk-ox, and walrus, is found in North America as far south as southern New Jersey, or in the adjoining region to the south and west ; and it seems to be confined to superficial gravels, a fact which points to a comparatively late immigration. Possibly it was followed or accompanied by Magdalenian man. Ingress to the North American continent might take place over Behring Strait and the Aleutian Islands, or across the Icelandic bridge. At first sight the latter route appears most promising. It is doubtful, however, whether at this time it was still standing ; it had possibly ceased to be intact during Miocene times, and is generally supposed to have completely broken down before their close. Besides this, no relics of Magdalenian man have been discovered on those remnants of the bridge which still stand above water, nor on the neighbouring shores. Scotland has yielded none,1 and the earliest human remains 1 Perforated bone harpoons like those of the Azilian stage have been found at Oban. Joseph Anderson, Proc. Soc. Antiq. of Scotland, vol. xxix. p. 21 1, 1895.</page><page sequence="28">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 43 found in Scandinavia date from tfre neolithic period. The more probable route would therefore appear to have lain over Behring Strait or the Aleutian Isles.1 A general consideration of all the facts might, then, lead us to some such hypothesis as the following. During the Mag- dalenian age two races of dolichocephalic Leiotrichi, differing greatly in stature,, extended from western Europe to the east,, across the entire breadth of Asia, occupying a zone which included much of the tundra and the steppes. They possessed a common Magdalenian culture, and resembled in their mode of life the Algonkians and Athapascans of the tundra as they existed before the advent of the white man, feeding on reindeer and mammoth, horse and bison, together with various kinds of fish. The taller, and probably more powerful, race held possession of the more favoured regions in the south, where the climate was less rigorous and game more abundant ; the shorter race, hemmed in by its tall relations in the south and the ocean or the ice in the north, had to make the best of its inhospitable surroundings, and developed, thanks to its great intelligence, a special mode of life. No doubt other Leiotrichous races, but distinguished by broad heads, were in simultaneous existence in the more southern parts of Asia. As the climate became warmer, the pressure of the rapidly increasing neolithic people began to make itself felt, acting probably from a region somewhere between the Carpathians and India. A movement of the Leiotrichi was thus set up* towards the north ; but as there was no room for expansion in that direction, it was diverted towards the only egress possible, and an outflow took place into America over Behring Strait or the Aleutian Islands. The primitive Eskimo, already accustomed to a boreal life, extended along the coast. The primitive Algon- kians, following close upon their heels, occupied the southern margin of the tundra, and extended east as far as the Atlantic Ocean. The broader-headed Athapascans came next, and gradually acquired possession of the western half of the southern tundra. The Eskimo were rigidly confined to the coastaL regions, but there was nothing to arrest the progress of the primitive Red Indians towards the south - everything, indeed,, 1 See A. Hamberg, Om Eskimoernas härkonish och amerikas befolkande , Ymer,, 1907, p. 15.</page><page sequence="29">44 SCIENCE PROGRESS seemed to invite them in that direction. No geographical barriers rise across the path, and game of all kinds was abundant, so that in no very long time the primitive Indians may have populated both the American continents throughout their whole length, from north to south. It is interesting to observe in this •connection that at the southern extremity of South America we still find a dolichocephalic Leiotrichous race, the Fuegians, who, though very inferior to the Eskimo in all respects, yet present some very striking resemblances to them in bodily structure, implements, and mode of life. The subsequent differentiation of the original Red Indian races - i.e. the primitive Algonkians and Athapascans - may have given rise to all the existing races of both the American con- tinents, except along the western coast, where the occasional stranding of vessels from the east of Asia or the islands of the Pacific may have added a foreign element. That the Algonkian and Athapascan races once occupied a far larger area than they do now, or rather did before the invasion by modern Europeans, is shown not only by fossil remains found outside their present boundaries, but by circum- scribed areas still inhabited by them, which are isolated from the main body of their race by alien tribes. Recurring for a moment to the Eskimo, we may mention that Steensby,1 as the result of a very interesting investigation, is led to conclude that the origin of the fully developed Eskimo ■cult must have occurred somewhere near the region of Corona- tion Gulf, where the conditions are peculiarly favourable for an " emancipation from forest life " and an adaptation to thé environment provided by the Arctic coast. This view would not be wholly inconsistent with that which we have just sketched out ; but it rests on resemblances between the imple- ments and mode of life of the Eskimo and Indians which are susceptible of a different explanation. If the views we have expressed in this and the preceding articles are well founded, it would appear that the surviving races which represent the vanished palaeolithic hunters have succeeded one another over Europe in the order of their -cranial capacity or intelligence : each has yielded in turn to a more highly developed and more highly gifted form of man. From what is now the focus of civilisation they have one by 1 H. P. Steensby, Om Eskimokultur ens Oprindelse, Copenhagen, 1905.</page><page sequence="30">PALAEOLITHIC RACES 45 one been expelled and driven to the uttermost parts of the earth : the Mousterians survive in the remotely related Austra- lians at the Antipodes, the Solutrians are represented by the Bushmen of the southern extremity of Africa, the Magdalenians by the Eskimo on the frozen margin of the North American, continent, and as well, perhaps, by the Red Indians. It is a singular fact, when considered in connection with the claims sometimes asserted in favour of the dolichocephalic skull, that in each of these ancient races, marked by so many primitive characters, a long head is distinctive. Perhaps this also is to be numbered among the primitive characters? Finally we may ask in the light of this history what part is to be assigned to justice in the government of human affairs ? So far as the facts are clear they teach in no equivocal terms that there is no right which is not founded on might. Justice belongs to the strong, and has been meted out to each race according to its strength ; each has received as much justice as it deserved. What perhaps is most impressive in each of the cases we have discussed is this, that the dispossession by a new comer of a race already in occupation of the soil has marked an upward step in the intellectual progress of mankind. It is not priority of occupation, but the power to utilise, which establishes a claim to the land. Hence it is a duty which every race owes to itself, and to the human family as well, to cultivate by every possible means its own strength : directly it falls behind in the regard it pays to this duty, whether in art or science, in breeding or organisation for self-defence, it incurs a penalty, which Natural Selection, the stern but beneficent tyrant of the organic world, will assuredly exact, and that speedily, to the full.</page></plain_text>
