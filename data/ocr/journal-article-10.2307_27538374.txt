<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WHORLED EAR By WALTER ELDER "^ ?W TTAS who guilty?" \/\/ I was not, she thought, considering the question in just that way. Or was I? In any case, it had simply floated towards her out of the study as she was walking down the hall. "Is he guilty, of course." She looked at herself in the mirror and lifted her hand to touch her hair. The hand came up holding a glass with a martini in it. She sipped at the drink and tried to count back. How many, she asked her face?which stared back rather in solently?have you had this afternoon? Do not try to tell me, face, that you need a great many martinis because you have had a bad day or a bad week. If you've had, say, a bad year, then you should get another one and then another one right away. She drained her glass, spat the olive at the mirror?it must have taken her face by surprise because it gave her a rude, discommending look?and turned back towards the living room. Then she re membered that she had left to go to the bathroom, so she turned around and began to pass the door of the study again. The name of a reformed traitor, a persecuted liberal, a notor ious leftist floated out of the study on a flat, informative voice. It was answered by an exclamation inflected to show interest, to reserve judgment, and to request a resume of the conversation and its original intonations. That, she thought as she went by the door, would be one of those polite inconclusive arguments which her husband pretended to relish. He called them exagminations. Were he here, he would be seated in that room leading them on to misjudge his</page><page sequence="2">WALTER ELDER 457 youthful appearance so that his flippant judgments would be taken as possibly mature. As she looked in, she kicked her olive, and she wondered who would be so careless as to drop an olive on these lovely, sanded, restored, polished floors, and leave it there. She worried about the olive until she came back through the hall, and then she remembered who had dropped it. You did. You pick it up. I can't find it. "Let's be specific about the charges. Are you thinking of the legal indictment or the political charges?" She opened the door into the room which she had left. There seemed to be a great number of people in the room for the number of people present. The host?he had been called the perfect host?noted her re entry, her lack of a glass, and, hence, her lack of a drink. He set off with the gleaming pitcher, but he was intercepted. Shortly the very good host went to the kitchen and frowned over a fresh mixture. He frowned because he feared he had violated his guests' trust. These people?without exception, he hoped,?drank martinis almost every day to put away the day up to this point?the day during which they went somewhere and worked at something? and to cross pleasantly into the hours when they might go some where not to work. They would try to be husbands or wives, guest or hosts, or themselves, or to do something if they wished. They would not stay too late. They would eat dinner sometime, somewhere. Then what had moved him to experiment? These were not people who would accept a bar martini to keep their hands off the table equipment until the waiter brought the food. They were not found in the host's kitchen at midnight weaving over an omelet containing, inspiredly, the last of the canapes. A proper martini?he had long ago discarded younger, wilder notions?was five parts gin to two parts French vermouth in a</page><page sequence="3">458 THE WHORLED EAR chilled glass rubbed with a twist of lemon peel, the glasses and the pitcher cold as they could be, and enough ice to last once around the room. Nothing more and nothing less. One could be conscientious without being fastidious. It was slovenly to have put six measures of gin with two of vermouth. It was a small thing, but it was the small things which set the tone. He rejected the notion that vermouth was simply a graceful disguise for the lust to drink gin. A good martini was a good martini, and he could not imagine why he had not corrected his mistake. He carried the pitcher across the edge of the room, gave the young lady a chilled glass and a drink, and went on into the study where the question of guilt was suspended to receive him. The host gathered that the temperature of the group was warmer than the clock indicated, but it was still unheated. The issue was lying before them, but no one had chosen a fragment as his own to compare it against others. The host circled slowly around the other room where the guests stood in little islands, drifting in the rush of steady conversation, the flow of non-committal talk which the host liked to watch since it never sank into shoals of silence or rose into waves of disputa tion. Any number could play the game, and everyone was a small winner, taking turns investing tiny amounts of attention which were returned at polite intervals without envy or rancor. He preened a bit over his pawns. They were so suitable that he could have been accused of having sampled with care. Super numerary bachelors involved themselves idly with wives of the husbands who were off in the study, and they handed around trays with seemly banter to escorted young ladies. The escorts were jauntily away from their charges, and they, too, moved from is land to island as the host would have wished. Elderly, respected females had planted themselves so that they were approached with deferential bowing; they were attended in a manner befitting ones who are graciously accessible.</page><page sequence="4">WALTER ELDER 4-59 Circling benignly was the youngish clergyman with a brilliant reputation. He had seen at once that in this place with these people he could indulge his wordliness, and, in so doing, he could further his interest in their stake in his investment in other worldliness. He spoke intently, for instance, of pictures, poems, and plays, insisting on the integrity of the pure artist to the verge of casuistry. He took what he would have called, chuck ling, unholy glee in watching them dangle as they were left to ponder, for instance, an impassioned declaration that artists were the most important people in the world. To the hearty rejoinder on his second round and to one exuberant clap on the shoulder, the clergyman would smile gently and bow his head before the conversation which they flung at him, jovially, as though at a regular old secular. He would flow away, and, as they hushed, he would flow back. They reached out for their words, picked them off his presence, and tried to drop them unobtrusively over their shoulders. He received another drink beyond his quota. He eyed the study door in the hope that he might enter into another sort of exchange. Would a group of men sequester themselves except for commerce, flesh, or politics? One of the bachelors began centering his attentions on the young lady who had spat an olive at her own image. The host began to watch the narrowing circles and filed a note with the recollection that the young lady had arrived with liquor already laid down. She looked around for her husband. She missed his being there as she missed eating a long, slow breakfast. She would go home and find him working at his desk on one of those papers?he said they were called thinkpieces?and he would meet her, smiling, a sandwich in his hand, neat stacks of paper on his desk, and a napkin under the coffee cup. She would be full of martinis, and sandwiches never seemed to go well on martinis. He would</page><page sequence="5">460 THE WHORLED EAR make a special point of going out with her as soon as he could after working on one of these papers. He seemed edgy when they went out, but that suited her more than when he tried to be soothing. He was always trying to keep his conversation impersonal. But?steadily and easily, always so surely on a play, a theory, or an irrelevant and ridiculous incident, he would display that considered, light-hearted judg ment which led one to think that he was speaking a set piece. So far as she knew, he didn't rehearse, but couldn't he be discerning or gay without being both? He would have seen through the clergyman immediately. She realized that she never would have if she had not watched her husband when he saw through people like that. He would have caught the clergyman on his second round, maybe before, with an earnest request for information about the artist's moral responsibility. Why had she not? He would have avoided any suspicion of shop talk. He would have been as a dutiful bachelor to enthroned dowagers, who would have taken him as very well-placed because he would have seemed well-bred. He would have fashioned interplanetary literary comics for the global-minded young men and women. She had heard him bewitch and shock United Nations' enthusiasts, preventive warriors, peace appealers, and point four people with elaborate and possibly apocryphal digests of utopias, accounts of which he had read, and all of which he foundered eventually on the reef which had wrecked the Platonic ship of state. He would have been able to sort out the study group by giving them a direction to follow; he would have told them of some tidbit to which they could rise and cease their wandering,?a point in law, a precedent, an analogy, anything at all. She had seen him do these things. She had not tried them, yet. For one year he had been married to her, and he continued to woo her so that she could never take him for granted. Since their</page><page sequence="6">WALTER ELDER 461 marriage he had increased his attentions steadily without pressing her too tightly and without satisfying all her desires and?so far as she knew?his. She thought that she had kept nothing back, but he seemed always to find something more which she was delighted to offer. She never felt that she was giving as much as he. She was often sure that she liked it all very much, and she was sure that she would continue to like it more. She was so sure that the notion nagged her. "Of course he's guilty. But as charged. Only as charged." Had the study group spread? No, it was only someone on her island who was urging his view of the public question of the moment. I may be drinking martinis a little too fast, she thought, and she put her glass down, rolling the olive with her tongue as she walked away. Everyone saw her leave. The host, the clergyman, and the bachelor watched her. As if they made her nervous, she caught her toe for an instant on the door sill, and the men drew them selves up exactly the same distance to signify that they would have come to her side. In the hall she puckered her mouth before the mirror and tilted her head. Sternly and steadily she looked back at herself. "Dreyfus. Take the Dreyfus case." "J'accuse," she whispered to the other face, mouthing the other language as she had been taught to mouth it. The olive rolled down her tongue against her lower teeth. She spat it against the mirror, and it bounced along the floor. "J'accuse," she said clearly. Since the olive was projected at almost the same angle and with little more velocity, it entered the study, passed its prede cessor, and stopped on the edge of the rug. Those who saw it could not reach it. When she came back to the other room, the host met her with a fresh glass, and stood beside her. He was standing guard, and they both knew it. She had to show him that she was not going</page><page sequence="7">462 THE WHORLED EAR to become a menace, and he had to make her believe that his anxiety for her was not disapproval of her behavior. The words rose easily to his face, but he had to leave them there while he scurried back for another speech. Had he said that he was sorry that her husband couldn't come, then she might have thought that he wished desperately that her husband were here. She had anticipated him, and had arranged her face to reply that it was a shame that her husband had to work. She left that on her face while he recomposed his lines. The din made it easier, since when he did say that she seemed particularly enigmatic today, she did not really hear, and answered that everyone seemed to be having a fine time as usual. He said that she did look very attractive. From then on they simply talked. It was the kind of conver sation in which one partner could have said that his mother had just died, the other could have replied that it was a good thing the old bitch was gone, and neither would have enjoyed talking less. At the other end of the room the host watched the bachelor detach himself from a group as a fighter plane in the movies does when the hero is about to launch himself on a bit of derring-do. The host tracked him like a camera plane while the lone wolf took evasive action from cloud to cloud, leading his audience through photogenic acrobatics, describing an ever-narrowing circle about his target which droned along in the camera's lens, menacing but not alert. The ace's guns began chattering even before he was within range, and the camera offered a close-up of the smiling, irrespon sible face,?a gay face in helmet and goggles, the wind whipping a white silk scarf over one shoulder, a "gotcha" smile curling his lips. The target tensed instinctively. Away from his formation in disobedience of general regulations and the special orders of the day, the eager eagle struck.</page><page sequence="8">WALTER ELDER 463 "Sex. It's basic. Right?" "Find this out all by yourself?" "Known it since birth. Inscribed on the tabula rasa in print too fine for small eyes. It is now perfectly clear. Am reborn. Like a Platonic soul." "Do we have to?" "It figures. Take that bunch in the study. Opinion dropping. Over there. Name dropping. There, money dropping. Again, house dropping. Another, horse dropping. And in every sense of the?" "It certainly figures. Sex is basic." "Aha. Aha. Your irony betrays your boredom. Ergo. What about sex?" "I never talk sex." "We have skipped miles of dull travelling. Leave us, host." "I never think sex." "Of course not." "Sex is a dull, boring subject." "We won't mention it. Go away, host, you're intruding." "Maybe you can discuss it with her husband." "My husband does not discuss sex." "Of course not." "Why don't you two discuss something else?" "Something basic, perhaps?" "If it's basic, then it's serious." "Oh, the hell with sex. You think it's serious." She wavered just enough to make herself drop the thread for an instant. They saw her totter ever so slightly. Drunk, they thought, damn. As the target lurched under accurate shooting, it fired back stitching a neat row of holes along the canvas-covered wings well away from the engine and the cockpit. The terror of the enemy skies waggled his wings and whipped off a great many feet of</page><page sequence="9">464 THE WHORLED EAR acrobatics which would have to be deleted before an audience paid to see the rest. "As if it really mattered. Stick around, host, before I give this kid the scare of his young life. If I gaze deep?or is it deeply?into his eyes and sigh, like this, and put my hot lips up to be crushed, like this,?if I so much as brushed against him or breathed deep?deeply here, I'm sure?what would he think was basic? Sex? My hat. This juvenile would smell love." "It might come later. Ours would first be an affair of pure animality." "Balls. Big words." She wobbled again?against her will. To an attentive audi ence, the target plane seemed imminently doomed. The director signalled frantically, and the cameras searched the sky. A black powder burst hazarded the ace, but the movie flak was late, dis tant, and barely visible. "Come out in the kitchen and help me with something really basic." He put a hand on the raider, but a neat Immelmann, which fooled the cameraman completely, took the rakish craft out of range. Into the pertinent piece of sky came the kindly, wise, mature squadron leader. With the rest of his flock safely back over friendly territory, he was seeking his gallant, foolhardy stray. His eyes narrowed and clear, his forehead wrinkled, he squinted until he saw smoke, and then banked his plane towards the scene. He circled at a safe distance, weighing his course with the wisdom of a higher command level and a cultivated fear of unauthorized impulsiveness. His charge, the daredevil, was tattered, but not bloody. The enemy?he shot forward in his seat and jammed the throttle open?was sinking, staggering, falling, but there was something peculiar about her markings. Stay a moment, Hollywood, our hero has blundered! The</page><page sequence="10">WALTER ELDER 465 plane's insignia identified her to commanders as a friendly craft on a dangerous and secret mission. Disguised as an enemy, she could have misled impetuous young aces. That was precisely why there were formations, discipline, general regulations, and special orders. It was too late. The killer pressed home his advantage, and the squadron leader could only circle sorrowfully over the wreck age, noting another monument to danger's risks accepted. "I say sex is basic. Sex, that is. Not orderly, sane, calculated, legal intercourse." "Oh? How were things at Locksley Hall?" "Fine when I left. How are they now?" When she flung her glass down, she splattered herself less than the young man, and the clergyman was barely sprinkled. She marched to the bathroom, clacking down the hall, hearing from the study? "Theory and practice are two different?" As she returned, she saw the clergyman at the other end of the hall trying to look as if he were not waiting for her. There was no getting past him, so she sat on the upholstered seat in the hall and looked at the top of her head in the mirror. He sat opposite her, and if she let her eyes go lax, her hair seemed to be standing on the clergyman's head. Most of the men in the study could look through the door and see the mirrored face of a young lady who sat listening to some one. She was twisting her finger slowly in a curl above her ear. With almost no effort, they could let their minds go limp and become fascinated by the young lady's ear. The arguments had fallen into the hands of the legalists now who seemed to be talk ing about something very mysterious. The clergyman wished he were with them. He could picture himself with them. He could picture some of them to himself as?as pictures. He believed he knew some of the more quiet</page><page sequence="11">466 THE WHORLED EAR ones who were not listening carefully. They were picturing things to themselves. But not for long. He knew his men. None of them could take a picture and leave it at that, which is precisely what I have to do in order to avoid going beyond a certain dimension and getting into processes which I should like to ignore. One he knew would turn away from any picture at once. He would see it simply as an effect of the camera which was a device to carry out the process which was a specific exemplification of the laws of light and chemistry. He would arrive quickly at first physical principles, and there he would remain happily, until he was jostled and forced to look at this particular picture or another. He did not care about composition, interest, or subjects. He liked mechanical laws. He would say, To hell (although he could hardly intend it literally) with people. The host dispensed martinis. Or that person. Would it sell? Was the camera expensive? Heavy silver frame? Well-dressed subject? Does it add to the world's treasures? I am thinking, the clergyman thought, in ideal terms, in stark delineations of black and white without shadings or texture. But so do they. A third? The environment man? If we abolish poverty and illiteracy, then we abolish crime and even error. Everyone will have a camera and take pictures of healthy homes, the car, the dog, the kids, and the wife. The pictures are always in focus. This photographer is, of course, subtly distinguished from the liberal. The man with natural rights plops down his pictures of egalitarianism carelessly. One can buy them, steal them, stumble over them, or treasure them. They may end on the mantle next to one's grandparents. They are like childish experiments. Yet he, too, would seek to eliminate all the bad smells, and he could imagine whole streets of photographic studios filled with pictures</page><page sequence="12">WALTER ELDER 467 smiling at their subjects who were smiling at their own flat smiling pictures. The clergyman sipped swiftly, hoping to shake himself loose. The young lady watched the image of his head with her hair piled on top. With her, she guessed, he had decided to be human, not humane. He would conserve his office for someone more appropriate at a more appropriate time. So they spoke of paintings. As they talked, she stared at the double image in the mirror, and, as though she were moving away from herself, she watched her fingers reach into the empty glass, remove an olive, and loft it easily at the top of the superimposed heads. It struck the mirror with a quiet plip, bounced from a clerical knee, pursued its course, and took its place before the bowed heads in the study. Lifting their heads?as flowers open in nature films?they re traced the projectile's course through the door, across the startled face of the clergyman, and to the launching fingers which were now twiddling a ringlet about a young lady's ear. "But the motivation. The sudden conversion. To have a thing like that dawn on you all at once. It's cheap dramatics." One lifted head agreed that it was. To look, for instance, at the swirls in a woman's hair or the shape of her ear, and to spin from those delicate convolutions an uncomplicated swinging of the soul from black to white, white to black, black to white,?one does not, ordinarily. Yet?and one pair of eyes narrowed, the spine lounged a bit more, the other voices rasped and faded?what could one surmise from one delicate ear? If one did not look at the body, if one did not see the nervous finger tracing the movements of the grasping conversation, if one took away the clergyman and his weekday soothing syrup,?if one could see the ear alone. From this ear one could go all the way. Created? In a sense. Purposive? Made to hear. To listen to the music of the spheres without the roar of traffic. To listen to the soughing of the atoms</page><page sequence="13">468 THE WHORLED EAR as they sifted freely and undirected through the pre-Socratic void. No minds attached to the ear to interpolate anthropomorphic gruntings into the sounds. To hear the crackling, the whimpering bang as the errant atom swerved pointlessly, purposelessly, portentously from its simple path and skidded into another and equally blameless particle. The whirling, the swirling, the pro cess set on its path, the nebulae, the heat, the cold, the mass, the force, all deriving from the fortuitous deviation which could never be repeated. The one and only miracle had come to pass long ago, and the rest was uninteresting. The ear is a fine ear. The rest is worthless. Someone was winding up his voice. Need he speak? Must I listen? Translate the noises, always it's try to translate the noises. What does it mean? What does it mean to me? What are you trying to say to me? What can I get from what you are saying? "I can't see why he has to get rich now for what he did then." Other eyes caught the nervous twitching of the finger in the hair. They moved straight to the costume and appraised it. With that dress and that tiny, expensive hat, and with her other acces sories, she should be wearing earrings. Heavy silver or gold ear rings?gold would be better?would have given her the class she seemed to want. It was like wearing the wrong cufflinks or letting one's socks droop. When one went out or stayed at home when someone might drop in, it was easy to be dressed. I spend my time, he mused, inside the correct fabrics, and I am a man, not fussy about my clothes. That young lady is better provided for than she shows today. I know something of her husband's circumstances, and she is re flecting on him. My wife would not let that happen. With a handsomely-fixed head like that, she has an obligation to wear a well-produced, well-packaged, well-merchandized de coration. She should be complete. Then the processes in which we spend so much time would in turn be complete. An enormous</page><page sequence="14">WALTER ELDER 469 industry is devoted to making her what she ought to be, and to leave any part of it at home on a dressing table was a waste, an insult to a carefully-machined universe. He glared at the offending ear. She was shameless. She was revealed more than if she had forgotten her dress. The young lady had the impression that chatting with the clergyman was a very difficult thing to do. The superimposition of their heads distracted her more and more. It was as if they could not stand apart. What should one do with a clergyman in such a setting? She wished that for the moment she had a trite problem to let him play with. She felt only that some little thing had gone wrong, and that it was really too small to find, let alone examine. She remembered that in the morning she had been angry with her husband, probably because he had refused to let her alone. She pulled at her ear lobe and tried to return to her first drink of the day shortly after or was it before lunch. He had been thinking of her or for her or thinking of something for her. He was always thinking of something for her. He would call from the office to suggest that she might go somewhere and do some thing, and sure enough, it would be true that she did not want to stay home. He was splendid about meeting her, and he would have parked the car, organized the tickets, the meals, and all that. When she thought that she would be oppressed by it all, it would be then that he would say, "You choose." The details of his work stayed at his office, and he brought home only that work which realized itself in almost immediate advancement. He was making more money all the time, and now they were going to build a house, a house in which all the graceful things in their apartment would sit so correctly. It would be their house to live in and plan and enlarge, something to do and dream. How he would have shone at this party. They would love him. Everyone loved him. She loved him, too. He had promised, when he had called, his eagerness to touch</page><page sequence="15">470 THE WHORLED EAR her, after his work and after her party. The first one through would set a scene. The other would enter it, dramatically naive. They would act and play, and then he would reach out for her, and? The bachelor lurched into the hall, chortling boisterously at his host who was clinging gaily to his guest's jacket. The bachelor racketed cheerily between the clergyman and the young lady. She stopped twiddling her finger. Against this assault the clergyman jelled his visage and his attitude, gathered his officiousness hastily about him, and, thus cloaked, fenced for the young lady's attention. He never touched her, officially. The unabashed other troublesome guest threw off his host, seized the young lady around the neck, clasped her head, and whispered sibilantly into her delicate, miraculously convoluted ear. The guests in the study, boring with boring each other, watched the inspiration of their speculations being plied with moistly pro pelled messages from grinning, salaciously-curved lips. She listened for a moment and laughed. Then she patted him on the cheek. She listened some more. She did not smile and pulled away. The clergyman bent forward, and, as he did, he took on the burden of all the guests and the host who wanted to know why she had listened and laughed, then listened and pulled away. They had no magic; they were fearful of being disenchanted. They handed over their investment in her mystery. The clergy man was the hope of the situation. He could be understanding if he needed to be. He could be gracious or tolerant or forgiving. He may not have realized that he was being called to counter sloth and slovenliness. The young lady bent to the clerical bending, the tip of her thumb poised on the edge of her ear lobe. She watched him clear his throat, poised her face in precarious attentiveness. She was glad to see that her hair was no longer piled on top of his head.</page><page sequence="16">WALTER ELDER 471 In the study someone picked an olive off the floor and studied it. The host jiggled his dangling pitcher, rattling the slushy ice and dregs. He could only think to say, "Drink?" The young man draped himself snakily against the wall, lounged menacingly over the young lady, dangled his hand threateningly at her waist, and drooped his cigarette carelessly over the polished floor. She licked her lips at the clergyman. He dropped his eyes from her ear, swept them across her face and her shoulders, sensed the crouching attitudes of the others, scurried across her blouse, sped down her torso, down her thighs, her calves, her tautly-stockinged calves, bounced off her strapped ankles, swung back to her face, through her eyes, to the tip of her ear. Was not the clergyman the one to handle this? Shouldn't someone do something? Is this a crisis? Can we help? Shall we try? They descended. The bachelor reached an arm around her and pressed her ribs gently. The host leaned his hand on her back and rubbed tentatively. Two men from the study strode forward avuncularly. To seize the situation, the clergyman reached out for her while she was being handled. He tried to speak, but they were all murmuring* He tried her eyes. They were unf ocussed. As she stiffened under their hands, the clergyman touched her knee. Pat?no release?pat, pat?the tension tightened?pat, pat, pat. ?this eagerness to touch her, the innocent, playful caressing, then insistently beginning?pat?no clear intention yet?-pat, pat?he may spring?pat, pat, pat. And then it would be as it was every other time, but never exactly the same. He would lead, and she would follow as though they were in a dance which he had rehearsed thoroughly without her. She screamed leisurely, rose, and in the silence which she called 8</page><page sequence="17">472 THE WHORLED EAR down, strode clacking to the sanctuary of the bathroom. There she confronted an efficient mirror, and her boredom showed through her drunkenness. She giggled over the bachelor. He was absurd. She stretched and yawned. She was tired of her husband with his poise and his little pressures, his balance and the banter of his studied, casual thinking, and his probably reasoned love making. He was never absurd. That could be the way to take the question of guilt. Tomorrow / may feel guilty, but right now he is. He is guilty of doing all those little things, the pets and the pitty-pats which have been run together all this time, but at the moment I see them distinctly and separately. He is cautious, controlled, and boring. He never drinks too much. He never worries beyond his depth. He is so devoted to little things that no little thing is ever going to upset him. He does not get excited, but he likes me to get excited. I usually do. I am not now. In the hall she had left the silent men who had seen her, but who would not bear witness. Recovering from having been swung so violently out from themselves, they all withdrew into themselves. From their re-goaded egos they bounced quickly out again, waiting for someone to be the first to restore the normal tone of an otherwise normal afternoon. They stared until they realized separately that each knew of his metaphysical journeying privately. As they grasped at this happiness, the young lady marched out of the bathroom, looking very unlike screaming again. They were themselves, and they turned to each other talking as though they had been no other selves, doing nothing else, thinking nothing else, wanting nothing else. They had always been here at this place, at this time, and with no more on their minds than what was showing through their open, friendly mouths. The host called a taxi for the young lady. Riding home, she tried to remember what she was going to think of when she saw</page><page sequence="18">WALTER ELDER 473 her husband. She adjusted her hat and examined her face. My earrings. I've lost them. Or did I forget them? I must have looked silly. Such a little thing, but so important. Still, it's a rather nice ear. Who was that man who had said that it was delicately whorled? The rest of the guests dispersed on a rising tide of bright chatter. The host carried things into the kitchen thinking that despite some little things it had turned out rather well. One could even tamper with martinis and get away with it. Provided, of course, you don't get obsessed with such a little thing and let it worry you to death.</page></plain_text>
