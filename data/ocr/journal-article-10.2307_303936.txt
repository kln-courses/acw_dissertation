<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aesthetics and Cultural Criticism Eric Gans Why do we interpret aesthetic works? What is there about aesthetic experience that makes it so conducive to discussion in person and in print- far more so than religious experience, which we generally concede to be more profound? This is the kind of question that is appropriate for originary analysis. Instead of seeking a sociological explanation for an anthropological phe- nomenon, we define the latter in terms of the minimal conditions for its appearance. Only after "interpretation" has been understood in the most general possible sense do we examine its specific historical manifestations. This is not an antihistorical position; on the contrary. The best way to re- spect history is to situate historically known behavior with respect to the hypothetical beginning of history. The fundamental structure of aesthetic experience is paradoxical. The aesthetic sign creates an image (not necessarily a visual image, al- boundary225:1, 1998. Copyright ? 1998 by Duke University Press.</page><page sequence="2">68 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 though our notorious visual bias is no accident). In the everyday practical use of language, such images are seldom thought of separately from the language that expresses them and that they help us to understand. But the artwork exists only to give us this image to contemplate, and it cannot become independent of the work itself; the aesthetic sign outside us com- mands the image's existence. Our relationship to the imaginary world of the artwork oscillates between our participation in the content of that world and our this-worldly return to the sign as its formal basis. The sign has the power to suggest the image to us and to make us desire to participate in it, but this participation cannot maintain itself without renewed attention to the sign, which holds for us the force of a mimetic model. The sign tells us "look at the image, not at me," but as soon as we forget the sign, the image disappears. Our experience is a pragmatic paradox along the lines of the classic example of the son whose mother tells him to "be spontaneous." Its oscillatory structure is the basis of the familiar opposition between form and content, and of the conflicting necessities of each. For example, as spectators at a tragedy, we identify with the pro- tagonist's desire in a manner that is inconceivable in the real world-as a pure mimetic model without the possibility of resentment or conflict. This is our participation in the content-world of the artwork. Yet, we would be dis- appointed in the work itself if the protagonist actually succeeded. We may already know the plot, or at least its negative outcome; tragedy is consid- ered the noblest of literary forms because it retains more than any other the inevitability of ritual sacrifice. At the same time as we identify with the protagonist, imitating his desire on the level of content, we identify on the level of form with the social order as a whole in its obligation to sacrifice desire and those who incarnate it. The tragic victim's guilt for the crimes his death or suffering is meant to expiate is inherent in the form prior to its necessarily relative and problematic figuration in the content of his actions. Oedipus's crimes are familiar ritual accusations of the kind we still hear today in the streets, but as his story is told, we are forced to understand, as he does, the necessity of his punishment. In the greatest tragedies, the desire that is the content of the work comes closest to the paradoxical gen- eration of sacrificial form from within itself; the search for a scapegoat for the plague recoils on the seeker. But this paradox is not experienced as mere intellectual titillation; it is felt in the depths of our experience. Cathar- sis is no mere symbolic exercise. We who desire with Oedipus learn that our desire also requires us to be blinded with him, but we are protected by the barrier of form from the physical realization of our complicity.</page><page sequence="3">Gans / Aesthetics and Cultural Criticism 69 This paradoxical structure is present in all aesthetic experience. In music, the form-content contrast, although less rich in anthropological con- tent, is in fact easier to grasp than in literature. Music arouses desires in the listener but continually defers their fulfillment. The desire to regain the tonic is the basis of all the formal manipulations of traditional Western music. (Atonal music must find a substitute source of narrative desire, such as the return from rhythmic complexity to a fundamental pattern.) We desire the tonic, but we would not enjoy music that did nothing but repeat it. The tonic stands at the horizon of our desire, ever reminding us that we need the rest of the scale to bring us back to it. The form-content opposition is a fundamental structure of all human representation. The originary function of the sign is to defer mimetic conflict by offering a representation in place of a scarce and therefore unappropri- able reality. The moment of imaginary satisfaction, of content, substitutes for real satisfaction; in the formal moment, we recognize that this very re- nunciation is the basis of our imaginary pleasure. Ritual reproduces the moment of crisis in which language became necessary; the originary function of language is to explain its own emer- gence. The first sign expressed the renunciation of its referent as an object of appropriation but, in the same act, designated it as sacred. This is God, so we cannot appropriate it. From the beginning, the content of language tells the story of how form came into being. The interpretive element in this configuration fulfills the task of jus- tifying formal constraint on the basis of the content alone, of showing why the story is worth telling. In ritual, the interpretation and the story or myth are one, the purpose of the latter being to provide the etiology of the former, to explain why this animal is killed or why these costumes are worn. Myth is anthropomorphic, attributing plausible human motives to the sacred ob- jects of collective mimetic desire. It acts as a supplement to ritual action because this action is always already insufficient to reproduce the tension of originary crisis and its resolution. If the relation of myth to ritual is one of explanation, secular art takes the further step of incorporating the components of ritual into the profane world. The language of the sacred is taken over into everyday life, whether in prayers that have become lyric poetry or in tales of the Gods that are now told of men. In secular culture, myth no longer explains anything but itself. The story has come to interest us independently of the rite because we have come to understand that our own desire contains within itself the structure of the scene that ritual commemorates. What attracts me to the</page><page sequence="4">70 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 rite is my identification with the desire it enacts-the forbidden desire of the sacred center. With the loosening of the archaic hierarchies that marked the beginning of Greek culture, the stability and productivity of the social order come to be less well served by expelling this desire through sacri- fice than by putting myself in the place of the one who desires the center and experiencing within myself the necessity of his punishment. Cultural language forever narrates the paradoxical event of its own emergence, re- ducing the verticality of this event, its revelatory newness, to a horizontal causal chain, within which we are made to relive the revelatory reemer- gence of the vertical. We speak of "criticism" when language only explains the event with- out making us reexperience it. There is no intrinsic difference in this regard between the arts of language and the other arts. Criticism is not simply the supplementation of action by language. The passage from rite to myth and from myth to fiction is a movement toward experiential autonomy. Where the rite enacts a collective purgation and the myth concerns objects of communal belief, the literary work is designed to operate on the individual spectator, independently of any communal ties, by the force of mimetic desire alone. It is this desire that criticism is designed to remove, or, more precisely, to bracket. Philosophy as Criticism The pre-Socratic writings contain cosmologies that Karl Popper calls the first scientific hypotheses, in which the empirical is called forth to jus- tify, however abstractly, the mythical. In these writings, the anthropological ideas, of more lasting interest, are inspired by ritual. Heraclitus's vision of conflict, Xenophanes' critique of idolatry, and Parmenides' search for the way of truth are critical reflections on ritual practice; they are not directly concerned with language. Plato's dialogues, the origin of metaphysics, that is, of philosophy proper, are the first self-conscious attempts at critical bracketing of textu- ally generated desire. Unlike the pre-Socratic fragments, but like the dis- course of the Sophists, the early Socratic dialogues contain many literary references, mostly from Homer. But they differ in the spirit of these refer- ences. The Sophists' stories defend "causes," judicially disputed courses of action; an action one wishes to justify would be declared analogous to a praiseworthy action in the Iliad. In contrast, the Socratic critique interro- gates the story with regard to the praiseworthy quality itself. Where the</page><page sequence="5">Gans / Aesthetics and Cultural Criticism 71 Sophist seeks a literary parallel with a courageous action, Socrates inquires about courage. Metaphysics originates as the critical deconstruction of narrative. In- stead of following the story, vicariously experiencing the situation in which courage, friendship, or beauty is realized, one seeks the Idea, the "eternal" sense of the term, so as to be able to dispense with the story. The ten- sion between performance and criticism, between theoretical and narrative modes, has existed since the beginning of formalized thought. Criticism ulti- mately denies the relevance of the interpreted text by restating its content in theoretical terms. Yet, the ultimate is not a real place but a horizon. Plato wanted to get rid of the poets, as we know. Philosophy has not yet replaced poetry, however, not even now, at the "end of history." Aesthetic temporality varies between the polar extremes of diach- rony-the performing arts-and synchrony-the plastic arts. Literature is close to the first pole, although written forms can approach the second pole. But the difference between the temporalities of, say, music and painting is secondary with respect to the temporal dichotomy of the aesthetic and the critical. It is this division that is incompatible with the assimilation of artistic and critical "texts" to a common model. All aesthetic forms borrow the temporality of worldly experience, which is essentially narrative. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Laocodn: An Es- say on the Limits of Painting and Poetry says nothing else: The poem tells the story, the sculpture illustrates its critical moment, but the story is there in either case. Secular art is born with the appearance of temporal exis- tence within the work, in the sourire grec (Greek smile) of the preclassical era. Epics are about crisis and resolution, and so are paintings. If the story in an abstract painting is difficult to extract from the forms in tension, the painting's success is measured by our desire to do so. Although theoretical discourse, like fictional discourse, is read in time, it renounces participation in lived temporality. The deconstructive mode of thought suspects this renunciation and, with it, the essential difference be- tween critical and aesthetic representation. From this perspective, the texts of philosophy-or of generative anthropology-are no different in kind from fictional narratives; all exemplify the narrative presencing of the logos. This affirmation itself is theory, of course, but theory that denies its difference from either storytelling or the metaphysical claim of making-present, which it can only denounce as content while embracing it as form. The point of critical thought is to detemporalize narrative experience. The clearest example of an atemporally constructed discourse is a mathe-</page><page sequence="6">72 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 matical proof, a construction not yet fully formalized in Plato's time. A proof is a narrative, as is the geometric demonstration given in the Meno, but its temporality is not that of lived experience. It generates a result, in the form of a new theorem, from previously accepted truths. Platonic dialogue in general imitates this form; the actual proof in the Meno does not differ in style from the demonstrations of the other dialogues. But the central content of philosophical texts is not geometry but ethics. The demonstrative rigor of philosophical discourse-which Spino- za's Ethics pushed to a point that only modern analytic philosophy has surpassed-is supposed to permit us to reason about the ethical more geo- metrico (in a geometrical manner). Here there is no "story," no experiential temporality, only a demonstration constructed from the properties of con- ceptual entities or Ideas that we all presumably hold in common. The ethical demonstrations of metaphysics neglect the fact that human beings, unlike mathematical entities, understand and react to what philosophers say about them; the human cannot be excluded from participation in the form as well as the content of ethical discourse. The theoretical detemporalization of such discourse is always vulnerable to deconstruction, to the recovery of its origin in experiential, and ultimately sacrificial, temporality. We learn from Aristophanes' Frogs that, even as the Athenians used literary texts as sources of ethical exemplarity, they not only remained atten- tive to their literary merits but attributed to their aesthetic value, as to that of Aeschylus's and Euripides' verses in the play, ethical weight. This aspect of criticism is necessarily ignored by Plato and his followers to this day. Having postulated the equivalence of the Beautiful with the Good, metaphysics cannot allow an independent aesthetic criterion of evaluation. Philosophy presents its ethical reasoning independently of the artwork or the myth that "illustrates" it. That the aesthetic reveals no independent truth is the first principle of Platonic aesthetics-and of Western philosophy. The artwork creates critical interest in its audience, the interest that we give to crisis. To use the work as the basis for reasoning about ethics is to accord a special status to the crisis produced by the aesthetic effect. Poetic justice becomes a privileged basis for our concept of justice. But critical discourse reproduces the paradoxical oscillation of the aesthetic experience itself. On the one hand, the work and its content form an inde- pendent world from which we seek to derive ethical principles. On the other hand, by the very fact of extracting these principles, we deny the necessity that the work itself be the source of our understanding. Once our discourse becomes a series of ethical propositions independent of the work, it must</page><page sequence="7">Gans / Aesthetics and Cultural Criticism 73 return to the work in order to demonstrate the correctness of its insight. Seen as a historically relativistic dialogue between the mental universes of critic and text, this cyclical movement is Hans-Georg Gadamer's herme- neutic circle. It becomes paradoxical when we situate the critical discourse in the transhistorical framework of metaphysics. It is not surprising that the structure of aesthetic interpretation is the same as that of the aesthetic itself. The stories told by artworks are all ver- sions of the one essential cultural story, which tells of the sacrificial fate of the desiring subject; all teach the same lesson-that of the deferral of desire. Criticism would like to teach that lesson independently of the sacri- ficial experience of the artwork, by dint of pure reasoning, and yet it cannot, since it has always already admitted defeat in taking the aesthetic narrative as its point of departure. The originary discourse of philosophy is the apology of Socrates, the martyr whose death condemns the social order that condemned him. The Platonic system is constructed in such a way as to make Socrates' death unnecessary; sacrifice is banished from his Republic. Because Socrates' story ends badly, the philosopher understands that henceforth we must do without stories unless they are strictly subordinated to a logical exposition of ethics that makes experience-which is inevitably sacrificial experience- unnecessary. Today, we understand, according to la logique du supplement (the logic of the "supplement"), that rewriting the history of Socrates' martyrdom is only a way of repeating it, that the aesthetic element that is expelled at the outset of philosophy will continue to haunt it, because to eliminate the sacrificial is, in effect, to embrace it. It is therefore only poetic justice that philosophy in the postmodern era has again become, as it was at its origin, indistinguishable from aesthetic criticism. The Beginning of the End of Culture Now that I have outlined the hypothesis of the originary relation be- tween criticism and literature, we are ready to witness how the historical evolution of this relation deconstructs it. We like to think of all cultural modes as cooperating to comprise a culture, but, in fact, they are in competition with one another, each seeking its own advantage. This opposition is not an eternal dialogue de sourds but a dialectic; each form seeks to encompass</page><page sequence="8">74 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 the other. Where the critical text strives to demonstrate the ethical truth that the literary text can only exemplify in fictional experience, the literary work incorporates the theoretical element as an extension of the fictional experience itself. The original role of the aesthetic protagonist is to turn us away from the center by making us experience the sacrificial from within. The funda- mental principle of classical ethics, the basis of its aesthetic of the golden mean, is meden agan, ne quid nimis, or nothing in excess: We must avoid anything that risks making ourselves objects of resentment. The only unique individuality is that of the central figure, and therefore of the victim; to occupy the center is to risk suffering the sparagmos (ritual dismembering). There is no need for exemplary heroes, because to participate in the ethical order is to do one's duty, to maintain one's place. Classical art begins with a smile because it is always ironic; its point is that its human protagonist-whether tragic or comic-should not have been on the scene in the first place. The very fact of serving as a mimetic model is equivalent to condemnation. The high classical tragic hero is counterexemplary; but some of Eu- ripides' later tragedies introduce the neoclassical tragicomic mode of the happy ending, where sacrifice is reduced to initiation. This mode comes in stronger and weaker varieties. Romantic comedy, beginning with works such as Euripides' Helen, presents us with characters whose trials we share but whose final happiness is a conventional "happily ever after." In the tragi- comic form, the protagonist's sufferings are a genuine ascesis. Pierre Cor- neille's early tragedies-for example, Cinna: ou, La clemence dAuguste- are the high point of this mode. The sublimity of their deeds makes the characters Rodrigue and Auguste figures of external rather than internal mediation, heroes to be admired rather than directly imitated.1 We copy the general form rather than the specific content of their gestures; their role as models is ethical rather than aesthetic. To emulate the "clemency of Augustus" is not to play at being a literary character; it is to strive to tran- scend the limitations of worldly desire to make oneself worthy of the scene of representation. 1.

Its whimsy is that of a subjec- tivity that mocks the reader's narrative expectations because it has become too de-ritualized for the sacrificial closure of classical form. Yet, this critique of the classical system, far from signaling a definitive rejection of the aes- thetic, is a precondition of its renewal. Just as Laurence Sterne passes from Tristram Shandy to A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy, the whimsical narrator of the eighteenth century will become the soulful one of the nineteenth, which is what he longed to become all along. The forms that appeared to be imposed by convention, that is, by ritual that has lost its raison d'dtre, would be regrounded in the shared experience of writer and reader. In Denis Diderot's Jacques le Fataliste, the deconstruction of the traditional narrative mode by the ever deferred account of the mas- ter's amours weaves traditional narrative linearity into a multidimensional narrative space; the traditional relationship between author and reader is both subverted and enriched by their mutually avowed search for a good story. After the century of "philosophy," the rejuvenated aesthetic mecha- nism will become the principal source of anthropological understanding; Sterne's and Diderot's paradoxical reflection on narrative will be pursued only in the twentieth century. From the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the father of the romantic movement, it is difficult to anticipate the importance of aesthetic form among his followers. The anthropological imagination revealed in his Discourse on the Origin of Inequality and in the autobiographical writings is clearly more powerful than that displayed in the narrative of La nouvelle H6elose, half of which is unadulterated theorizing, in any case. But it is Rousseau's histori- cal role to reveal the operation of the aesthetic mechanism at the heart of the ethical discourse of metaphysics. It is no accident that Jacques Derrida chose Rousseau's writings as the primal object of deconstruction. Rousseau's anthropology, like that of his classical antecedents, is political rather than economic; he ignores Voltaire's prescient model of wis- dom, revealed at the end of Candide, as cultivating one's garden for the agricultural market. Rousseau sees the chief threat of modernity, as well as its solution, not in the anonymous marketplace but in the face-to-face of ritual, degenerated or renewed. His prescription for Geneva in the "Let- tre a D'Alembert sur les spectacles" is to replace urban theater with the equivalent of village festivals.</page><page sequence="10">76 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 For Rousseau, the aesthetic as such has become suspect. His attack on catharsis-"[le theitre] purge les passions qu'on n'a pas, et fomente celles qu'on a"-affirms that the classical aesthetic, indeed, the aesthetic in general, has lost its value as an anthropological discovery procedure.2 Whereas the festival returns the population to their ritual function as par- ticipants rather than spectators, the spectacle cultivated by society is that of the resentful denigration of the virtuous (such as Moliere's Misanthrope). Rousseau's prelapsarian anthropology does not recognize the passions that theater purportedly discovers and uproots, those passions that reflect the inherent perversity of desire. In contrast, he is very much aware that the ritual concentration of the onlookers surrounding the spectacle exac- erbates the social passion of vanity: I don't care about the hero sleeping with his mother; I attend the theater to show off my new mistress. Rous- seau's anthropological intuition tells him that the scenic configuration of the stage is more fundamental than the content that fills it. When the audience neglects the action on stage and becomes the real spectacle, this signals the return of the social crisis that the theater and, before it, ritual had been created to solve. Rousseau would have us choose between two types of ritual culture: the participatory and positive, or the passive and resentful. High aesthetic culture is, for him, a mere pretension. This view of culture resonates with our own, but it could not be farther from that of his romantic disciples-or from the aesthetic implicit in his own prose. Romanticism and Aesthetic Anthropology The romantic turn toward the irrational could not have been antici- pated in the Enlightenment. How could anyone imagine that the bourgeois revolution would usher in a century whose culture would cultivate sentiment rather than reason, aesthetic rather than critical discourse, and culminate in a vision of apocalyptic totality that would exclude self-reflection altogether? The romantics learn their culture of resentment from Rousseau, but their relationship to the aesthetic is quite different. Postrevolutionary "eco- nomic" romanticism revalorizes the high-popular distinction that Rousseau's political romanticism had discarded. The point is no longer to bring the com- 2.

The romantics pretend not to notice that to resist and to participate in the market are complementary, not contradictory, functions. The bourgeois market is not a norm-based institution; the essential feature of its ethic is without a rule.3 Hence, its social order is impene- trable by theory so long as theory itself has not grasped, as it cannot be- fore our own era, the originary foundation of the market ethic. The ethic of romanticism, and of the nineteenth century in general, is best expressed in aesthetic form. The romantics' return to the aesthetic after its eighteenth- century subordination to the theoretical is marked by the paradoxical status of the exemplary protagonist, whose existence is fundamentally at odds with the social norms that early modern political theory had thought itself capable of determining. The beginning of the end of culture is the romantic establishment of the literary character as a genuine mimetic model, the merging of high literature with popular wish fulfillment. Just as Christianity makes the sac- rificial victim our model in the imitatio Christi, so, ultimately, does Christian literature. Romanticism emerges in a society devoid of a ritual center; in the market system, the central object of desire has lost its sacrificial danger. On the romantic scene, there is no such thing as bad publicity; the tragic hero, however great his sufferings and even opprobrium, becomes a figure of envy. This is all the more obvious when these sufferings are ignored by his fellows in the fictional universe but granted central significance by the author. What theoretical formulation can justify proposing as a mimetic model the exceptional individual who rejects the norms of the social order? Consumer society has taught us that this is precisely the structure of market activity, that one must reject the market to operate within the market, that is, reject its current values to create new ones that will generate new desires and new profits. But in the early stages of market society, the open-ended potential of its interactions is not apparent. The romantic hero cannot see himself as merely a superior manipulator of the mimetic. The mensonge romantique (romantic lie) is a historical and psychological necessity. 3.

The more tragic he appears, the more he is imitated, whether he be the real Byron or the fictional Werther and Rene. A rash of suicides (and yellow trousers) follows in the wake of Goethe's novel; it is as though Athens had celebrated the success of Oedipus rex with an outbreak of self-blinding. The decline of the classical aesthetic in the preceding century spawned delicious pastiches of tragedy, far more entertaining than their models. Romantic drama is a pastiche of itself. Its protagonist is the tragic hero as self-made man. Victor Hugo's Hernani seeks martyrdom from start to finish; he offers his life to nearly every character in the play as a dem- onstration of the Spanish pundonor (point of honor). The exaggeration of his victimary temperament only emphasizes its voluntary nature. As a char- acter in a play, and an "exotic" at that, Hernani has no reason not to do anything he can to attract attention. His hyperbolic posing is nonetheless a model for advantageous behavior in the market system. The more one thinks of oneself like Hernani, the more easily one is able to maintain the sense of one's uniqueness and, thereby, one's value on the market. The bourgeois youth who plays at romantic heroism knows what he is doing. The Realist Alternative Realism is, more consciously than romanticism, an aesthetic dis- covery procedure for the fundamental interactions of market society. This mode never subordinates the aesthetic to an ethical model. The typicality of the realist character is not the sign of his generality but a mass-produced version of the calculated uniqueness of the romantic hero. In contrast to the classical caracteres (characters), such as the Miser or the miles gloriosus (boastful soldier), who incarnate fixed forms of interaction in the prebour- geois era, the very interest of the "type" is its historical boundedness. The insistent descriptive detail that creates a sense of contiguity between the fic- tional and the real world gives the literary content of these works a historical specificity beyond any possibility of generalization. The real point of realism is not sociological but anthropological: Aes- thetic form alone can impose order on the world of historical contingency. The exemplary tale of desire and disillusion is Gustave Flaubert's discovery procedure for exploring the nascent consumer society that would not be understood, or scarcely even noticed, until the following generation. The consumer is precisely one who does not exemplify the sacrificial structure</page><page sequence="13">Gans / Aesthetics and Cultural Criticism 79 of the classical aesthetic: Satisfaction of his desires does not bring him into inevitable conflict with others. The figures of salvation of Flaubert's last de- cade are typical of a new self-consciousness of the novelist-as-consumer that will reach its high point in Marcel Proust. That Emile Zola and other fin de siecle novelists on both sides of the political spectrum turn their backs on this ultimate insight reflects the renewed hopes and fears of a political solution to the problems of the mar- ket aroused by the rise of socialism in the 1870s and 1880s. Zola naively declares his creative procedure scientific, but his novels obey the sacrificial formulas of classical aesthetics. Naturalism gives aesthetic form the apoca- lyptic role of revealing the utopian future beyond the market-and beyond the necessity of aesthetic representation. Zola assimilates market activity to the polluting crimes of traditional tragic heroes; his last-ditch romanticism still conceives of market society in 1900 as a sinful aberration. His last novel is hardly a novel at all: F6condite fantasizes a world of endless repetition where the paradoxical individuality of the classical aesthetic is transcended in self-reproducing anonymity. This idyllic follow-up to the apocalypse of capitalism in the Rougon-Macquart series reveals the dependence of the sacrificial form of the classical aesthetic on the ultimate reality of a "natural" prebourgeois social order. This naturalist cul-de-sac allows us to understand why Flaubert's later work deviates from the realist aesthetic of Madame Bovary and L'edu- cation sentimentale. But Flaubert's figures of salvation, however much their specificity is made symbolic, are not universalizable and therefore are not detachable from their aesthetic framework. What does it mean to write about a servant girl or a saint rather than about oneself? The nineteenth- century narrative tradition is based on the fundamental intuition that the writer's knowledge of the world cannot be put to direct practical use-an intuition, in effect, about the operation of the free market. At the outset of modern realism, Honore de Balzac expresses this intuition in La peau de chagrin, in the figure of the hundred-year-old antiquary, who opposes the universality of savoir (knowledge) to the narrowness of vouloir (will) and pouvoir (power). The writer's transcendental role is protected from the world, whether or not Balzac the unhappy investor is aware of the transcen- dental position of Balzac the novelist. In Flaubert, transcendence becomes a conscious attitude: Worldly success is incompatible with artistic integrity; failure is a sign of salvation. This radical antimarket position reveals by the logique du supplement that it is the market that supplies the artist's letters of nobility, that justifies the aesthetic and maintains it beyond the reach of</page><page sequence="14">80 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 critical thought. Market society has too many degrees of freedom for theory to comprehend, but it can be understood by art. The claim of the artists of the last century to have grasped human truth better than the theorists is well founded-they had the better anthropological method. Apocalypse and Transition Wagner's operas mark the culmination and decadence of the heroic age of nineteenth-century art, which is characterized by works of gigantic proportions that attempt to exhaust the world of experience. The Wagner- ian narrative ends with a cosmic reconciliation beyond the merely human. The Gesamtkunstwerk abolishes the need for interpretation altogether in a hyperromantic vision of the sacrificial-aesthetic as complete in itself. We know what this aesthetic of the Gemeinschaftwas destined to lead to on the political front. It poses a direct challenge to the critical, self-reflective ten- dency of the modern-the productive side of the market system. Wagner's tales have no moral, unless it be the expulsion of the "Jewish" character- not insignificantly identified in Die Meistersinger with the critic. But this is also the expulsion of irony, and transcendental experience, as we know, has precisely the structure of irony.4 In turning Wagner's expulsion of the critical on its head, Proust cre- ates the only true Gesamtkunstwerk, the one that tells us what it means to create it. Proust understands that the horizon of nineteenth-century aes- thetic anthropology is the abolition of the metaphoric form of the fictional narrative. Flaubert's premonitions of this self-consciousness are never ex- pressed in his own name. The characters Felicite, Bouvard and Pecuchet, and Saint Antoine are all spokesmen for the novelist, and yet they are other than he: The only praxis he could not represent directly is his own. This blind spot is an avoidance of the paradox that Proust takes up as a challenge. Only in our era has the experience of aesthetic paradox been accepted as definitive. Proust's novel A la recherche du temps perdu (Remembrance of things past) is about nothing but its own creation. If the novelist expresses the truth of the human in the specific form of his own experience, this form can only be that of writing a novel. All the other major art forms-music, painting, theater, and the "psychological" novel-are weighed and found 4.

The author sings the praises of Elstir, the bohemian painter, and Vinteuil, the obscure music teacher reviled by his lesbian daughter, but his real, subversive point is that their great- ness can be fully comprehended, and thereby transcended, by the novelist, whose work not merely includes discussion of his rivals' works but can reproduce their aesthetic effects. Elstir and Vinteuil create amid the unre- solved turmoil of their lives; the novelist can only begin to write at the end of time, after working through and renouncing the world of desire. Yet, Proust's critical remarks in Le Temps retrouve (Time regained), the final installment of A la recherche, are of less interest than the fact of their presence in the novel, and it is not surprising that most readers find them more a chore than a triumph. The passage between literary and critical consciousness has not been bridged so much as recognized and formalized in discourse. The very fact that the novelist must pass from the stage of life to that of art is a sign that the two stages comprise different anthropological paradigms. A more crucial sign of this dichotomy is the nature of this theoretical content. Proust's work abounds in observations about desire and disillu- sion. But in Le Temps retrouve, the lessons in desire are brought together not in an ethical but in an aesthetic doctrine. It would be perverse to con- demn the aestheticism of one whose entire life is spent in the anticipation and composition of a single artwork. The novel can have no other con- clusion. The author cannot develop a theoretical ethic; the only theory he can enunciate is the one that justifies the composition of his novel: narra- tion as totalization. The recherche du temps perdu accumulates the stuff of transcendence. Each living moment becomes a brick in the edifice of salva- tion-which is never a mere lesson in ethics. The greatness of the human lies in the unfulfillable necessity-for us to live together in peace-that all the paradoxes of transcendence be resolved. No moment shall be lost, for every moment of experience aspires to the condition of the immortal words of language, whose source is originary crisis. Proust's novel is the summit of nineteenth-century aesthetic con- sciousness, but for that very reason, it is another dead end. If the novelist's vision of exemplarity can only be the creation of a novel, then his work ex- cludes all others, including other ("lesser") novelists, from the possibility of following his example. By eliminating the metaphoric link between Felicite and Flaubert, Proust eliminates aesthetic metaphoricity in general and, with it, the romantic article of faith that a particular life may bear a general ethi- cal lesson. Romanticism had begun by making the classical hero a mimetic</page><page sequence="16">82 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 model for the reader; modernism begins with the emergence of the rivalry between the artist and his audience. Modern Times Since culture is always paradoxical, we should avoid the hubris of thinking that we are exempt from the mensonge culturel (cultural lie) that we observe so easily in romanticism and in modernism as well. The post- modern fusion of the high and the popular is unlikely to put an end to the revelatory claims of culture. But any skepticism about our own pretensions should not prevent us from exposing the simpler ones of the past. The twentieth century is, from the beginning, an age of criticism. Futurism and its progeny are forms of "conceptual art" avant la lettre, where the idea is more important than its hypothetical implementation. Writers such as Filippo Tommaso (Emilio) Marinetti, Tristan Tzara, Paul Valery, and Andre Breton are remembered more for their aesthetic doctrines than for their works. Extending the ideas of predecessors such as Arthur Rimbaud about the process of aesthetic creation, their powerful reaffirmations of the value of the aesthetic discovery principle reflect unspoken anxiety about their ability to make use of it. The modernist has by no means abandoned the romantic faith that the individual self is the guardian of the aesthetic mechanism that had previ- ously been the province of the public scene of representation. This faith has become so absolute that it need not, cannot, any longer manifest itself in works. Automatic writing is the reductio ad absurdum of modernist aesthet- ics. The affirmation of its merits only demonstrates its incapacity to stand on its own. The surrealist rejects the conscious activity of formalization in his search for originary anthropological truth. But in the sincerity of his belief, he forgets that the postulation of the aesthetic value of the human-in-general does not suffice to lend aesthetic value to his work in particular. This can be done only by interpretation, not surprisingly along the lines of Freud's interpretation of dreams. The article of faith is that there is an underlying narrative to be reconstructed-and who can deny it? But now interpretation, whether carried out actually or virtually, has become the real locus of the aesthetic mechanism. And if we do not experience the aesthetic pleasure consonant with a coherent interpretation, it is not the work's fault but our own, just as it is the psychoanalyst's problem if he is unable to construct a coherent narrative from a dream. Modernism worships the primitive, the prelinguistic, in hope of dis-</page><page sequence="17">Gans / Aesthetics and Cultural Criticism 83 covering the "natural" basis of desire. The preceding century taught it that only in art could real anthropological discoveries be made, but as the irony of intellectual history would have it, just at the moment when it learned this truth, it became a falsehood; the owl of Minerva takes wing only when its food supply has been exhausted. A postimpressionist painting tells us nothing about the world; like a Rorschach inkblot, it allows us to project our desires on it, but only if we first choose to endow it with oracular significance as an instrument of divination. Modernism is forced to learn that the aesthetic has its limits; the comparable discovery in the political sphere is equally sobering and far more expensive. When World War II ends in the Holocaust, aesthetic utopia is given a bad name, apparently for good. Henceforth, the only images permitted are those of victims; the slaughtering hero gets no billing. The Postmodern Era Modernist theorizing always sees itself as auxiliary to aesthetic pro- duction even when it effectively substitutes for it. Today, this strikes us as nalve; the supplementary role of theory has become essential, even domi- nant. Postmodern art is primarily, often exclusively, conceptual; it under- stands and exploits the irony of this situation by selling its fetishized concepts to the still vilified-but ever tolerant and even complicitous-bourgeois. The dominance of popular, at the expense of high, culture in the postmodern era reflects the downgrading of aesthetic culture's familiar sac- rificial pattern of centralization and expulsion. High culture now differs from popular culture only in its conceptual, self-reflective element; the aesthetic mechanism itself is unpretentiously popular, which still means sacrificial. In terms of density and sophistication, today's market produces a better- designed culture for all, just as it produces better-designed automobiles for all. But just as the basic structure of the automobile is unchanged, so is that of narrative. Now that we are all certain our real lives have been purged of sacrificial violence, we don without compunction our mass persona to be entertained. As awareness of these trends impinges on our aesthetic conscious- ness, both high and (to a lesser extent) popular culture react to it. The high-cultural work is sure to tell us that its content is only "quoted," but once the convention has become familiar, the quotation marks become in- definitely faint, and only the genre or the artist's name remains to convince us of its status. (Alain Resnais's imperceptibly self-mocking film Melo is an</page><page sequence="18">84 boundary 2 / Spring 1998 example of this.) Meanwhile, popular culture itself becomes citational. We come to enjoy stories, even crudely sacrificial ones, through what we con- sider the safe remove of quotation marks, not noticing to what extent these are themselves a form of sacrificial protection. The current spate of extreme cinematic violence, of which Quentin Tarantino is the acknowledged mas- ter, is a dialectical response to this felt need for deferral; if our aesthetic effects can only be quoted, let them be quoted as violently as possible. The postmodern includes the critique within the work and makes it indistinguishable from the work. But at the point at which it becomes in- distinguishable from its object, it vanishes. Just as modernism reached the natural limit of the aesthetic in the formless and tiresome production of automatic writing, so postmodernism reaches its cultural limit in layers of self-reflective citation. Postmodernity recognizes that there is no human nature, that all in the human is culture. Hence, it rejects the Platonic attempt to distinguish within the cultural domain between demonstration and narration, between criticism and art. This firmer grasp of the specificity of the human should make our era the golden age of anthropology. But the irony of intellectual history dictates that just at the moment when this specificity appears to have been recognized, the anthropological as a category is rejected. Apes talk, ants build societies, computers think, and Gaia is our divinity. As soon as we become able to understand ourselves in universal terms, this under- standing loses its value in the marketplace. Real thinking can take place only in the interstices of our intellectual world. The aesthetic can absorb layer upon layer of reflection, but its funda- mental mode of operation cannot change any more than the fundamental structures of language can change. The culture-and the ethics-of the postmodern era must absorb this simple truth. It implies the end of high culture as it has existed since the Greeks. Once the aesthetic appears as a mechanism ultimately resistant to thought, it can no longer play the leading role imagined for it in antiquity and again in the Renaissance of "elevating the soul." High culture incarnated our aspiration to human dignity: I, as an individual spectator, independently of the judgments of my fellows, can ex- perience within myself the purgation effected by sacrifice. I sacrifice not the other but myself; the tragic hero's downfall is my own. This attitude is incom-</page><page sequence="19">Gans / Aesthetics and Cultural Criticism 85 patible with the postmodern self-consciousness that the self undergoes no originary experience but simply participates in the mimetic operation of cul- ture, repeating what humanity has always known. Nor do we identify with the tragic victim in any privileged sense. We are disposed to enjoy-and here postmodernism, following Rousseau, explodes the essential pretension of secular aesthetic culture-both the victim's suffering and our own vanity in participating in this suffering. We can still obtain pleasure by the ironically self-aware manipulation of this mechanism, but the pleasure is incompat- ible with the metaphors of cultivation and raising up that are embodied in the term culture, which the attribute high only reaffirms. The postmodern has yet to say its last word on any of these matters. What era can succeed the end of eras is something we cannot know, nor can we know the path along which the present era will arrive at its limits. What we can do is profit from our age of aesthetic criticism to construct a more powerful critical aesthetic-a more powerful anthropology.</page></plain_text>
