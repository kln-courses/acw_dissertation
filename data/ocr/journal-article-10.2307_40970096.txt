<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL'S CRITIQUE OF MARXIST HUMANISM BY MARTIN JAY v/NE of the most significant intellectual legacies of the Weimar period resulted from the challenge presented by a number of young thinkers to the prevailing orthodoxies of Marxist thought. Revived scholarly interest in Hegel * contributed to the reexami- nation of old shibboleths, as did other purely intellectual stimuli, but the major impetus doubtless came from the crisis within the socialist movement itself. Schematically put, the crisis resulted from three unanticipated developments in the convulsive history of Europe in the years after 1914: first, the craven collaboration in national war efforts by socialist parties pledged to international class solidarity; second, the pathetic failure of German revolu- tionaries after the war in contrast to the unexpected success of their Russian counterparts; and third, the meteoric rise of fascism as a competitor for the right to succeed liberal capitalism. With the organizational ruin of the Second International came the col- lapse of its theoretical underpinnings. Nowhere was this change felt more severely than in the country whose socialist party had been the central supporter of the International - the newly cre- ated Republic of Germany. The story of how in the early 1920's, George Lukács and Karl Korsch began the process of dismantling the orthodoxies of pre- war Marxist dogma has been told too often to need recapitula- tion here. Suffice it to say that their seminal work, in History and Class Consciousness and Marxism and Philosophy respec- tively, in combination with the rediscovery of Marx's early manu- scripts in the late twenties, nurtured an alternative direction in i The beginning of the "Hegel renaissance" is often traced back to Wilhelm Dilthey 's Die Jugendgeschichte Hegels in 1906.</page><page sequence="2">286 SOCIAL RESEARCH Marxist thought which continued to develop well after the demise of Weimar. Known at various times as "Western Marxism," 2 "Para-Marxism," 8 and perhaps most frequently, as "Marxist Humanism," 4 this new trend was quickly declared anathema by the official guardians of Marx's legacy, both in the East and West. Neither the Social Democratic nor the Communist parties of the Weimar period were prepared, for example, to accept the role of consciousness in the dialectical process assigned by Lukács, Korsch, and their successors. Nor did concepts like reification or alienation enter into the popular discussion in a meaningful way. Instead, the gap between the outmoded theoretical baggage of the older generation of Marxists and the practice of at least some of their successors continued to widen (e.g., the voluntarism of Leninist revolutionary activity combined with the retention of a mechanistic and deterministic materialism on the level of theory).5 In fact, not until the period after the second world war did Marxist Humanism, stimulated by its uneasy integration with existentialism in France and popularized by a number of German refugees in America, become a significant force in some socialist movements and widely known in academic circles.6 Within the 2 Merleau-Ponty uses this term in Les Aventures de la Dialectique (Paris, 1955). The relevant chapter has been translated into English in Telos, 6 (Fall, 1970). a Michel Crouzet first used this term and Ueorge Meiner piocea it up in nis Language and Silence (New York, 1967). * Perhaps the best definition of the term, and certainly the earliest, can be found in Marx's own writings. In the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts, he wrote: Communism as a fully developed naturalism is humanism and as a fully de- veloped humanism is naturalism. It is the definite resolution of the antagonism between man and nature. It is the true solution of the conflict between exis- tence and essence, between objectification and self-affirmation, between free- dom and necessity, between individual and species. It is the solution of the riddle of history and knows itself to be this solution. (Karl Marx: Early Writings, trans, and ed., T. B. Bottomore (New York, 1963), p. 155.) ß Lenin himself developed a strong interest in Hegel s Logic during tne nrsi world war, but little of this filtered down to Bolshevik ideology in the subsequent years.

The reasons for this are not difficult to discern. The Frankfurt School, as the Institutes inner circle around Max Horkheimer became known, did in fact reject the monistic materialism, copy- theory epistemology, and reliance on "scientific" laws of historical development held by more traditional Marxists. They were furthermore very much taken with the notions of reification and commodity fetishism which Lukács had done so much to revive. They were also convinced that the social totality, rather than the socio-economic substructure alone, was the proper sphere for the radical social theorist to investigate. And finally, they fre- quently stressed individual gratification as a legitimate moment in that totality in a way that distanced them from the older Marx- ism which permitted the negation of the individual actor in the name of impersonal socio-economic forces, and from its newer, Stalinist perversion. For these and other reasons, it might be argued that the Frank- furt School can be placed squarely in the camp of the Marxist Humanists. This certainly has been the prevalent interpretation of its work. Daniel Bell, for example, in his well-known article on "The Debate on Alienation," 7 written in 1959, cited the Institut for its contribution to the discussion of Marx's early writ- ings and the accompanying interest in alienation. A decade later, George Lichtheim called an essay he wrote on the Frankfurt School for the Times Literary Supplement, "From Historicism to Marxist Humanism." 8 And more recently, in a lengthy critique of Horkheimer and his colleagues in the New Left Review,0 Goran Therborn characterized them as "historicist humanists" 7 Reprinted in Revisionism: Essays on the History of Marxist Ideas, ed. by Leopold Labedz (New York, 1962). » (June 5, iyt&gt;y).

"There is no room," he wrote, "in the historicist conception of history for social totalities as structures of irreducible complexity, or for a discontinuous development of those complex structures. Society is always reducible to its creator-subject, and history is the continuous unfolding of this subject. At every given point in time, society is a unique manifestation of Man." 12 As others have charged,13 Therborn saw the Frankfurt School as a regres- sion to the pre-Marxist Young Hegelians who reduced social criti- cism to philosophy. "They substitute for real history a construc- tion derived from a philosophy of history, the 'history' of Man's alienation or reification or - in Frankfurt School vocabulary - the 'dialectic of the enlightenment'." 14 Whether or not Therborn's critique of Marxist Humanism as such is valid is not the point at issue here, however, as a discussion of Althusser's "scientific" Marxism would lead us too far afield. What I would like to focus on instead is the legitimacy of his characterization of the Frankfurt School as a variant of Marxist Humanism, which, as we have noted, is shared by other com- mentators such as Bell and Lichtheim. What I will argue is that 10 Ibid., p. 70. n For Althusser's polemic against Marxist Humanism, see his For Marx, trans, by Ben Brewster (New York, 1970), p. 219-247. 12 Op. cit., p. 77. i3Marcuse has been the special target of this allegation.

Elsewhere in his essay, Therborn perceptively notes that the Frankfurt School concentrated on exchange rather than alienation or reification as the fundamental relation of capitalism. He fails, however, to draw the implica- tions of this difference for the rest of his analysis. The dialectic of the Enlighten- ment was disliked by Horkheimer and Adorno precisely because it assumed the identity of interchangeable atoms in the social as well as natural universe. As will be made clearer below, hostility towards identity theory underlay the Frank- furt School's critique of humanism. Reification and alienation, which are humanist concepts, are by no means the same as the concept of exchange as the central reality of capitalist society.</page><page sequence="5">MARXIST HUMANISM 289 only in the broad sense that its members consistently opposed Stalinism can their position be called Humanist, whereas under- stood more precisely, it served as a critique of both "scientific" and "humanist" Marxism. To begin, it is necessary to make clear which members of the Institut für Sozialforschung are being discussed here, as a broad spectrum of viewpoints was sheltered at various times under the Institutes several roofs. This was especially true during the years after its creation in Frankfurt in 1923. Carl Grünberg, its first active director, came from the world of Austro-Marxism. Adherents of the German Communist Party such as Karl August Wittfogel, Julian Gumperz, and for a brief time, Richard Sorge, espoused a more orthodox Marxist-Leninist line. Karl Korsch, although never a fully integrated member, participated in the Institut seminars, bringing with him his mercurial left-opposition- ist views. The economically orthodox position of traditional Marxism was represented by Henryk Grossmann, an expert on crisis theory. At the other end of the spectrum were several younger entrants into Institut affairs, who joined in the years immediately preced- ing the emigration in 1933. Erich Fromm presents the clearest case of an Institut figure who can be placed among the unquali- fied exponents of Marxist Humanism. In all of his writings on socialism, most explicitly in his Marx's Concept of Man 15 and the volume of essays he edited entitled Socialist Humanism,1* Fromm has demonstrated how thoroughly he believes that Marx's work can be grounded in his early writings. Ever since the twenties and his association then with Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig and others in the so-called Frankfurt Lehrhaus, Fromm has ac- cepted the necessity of a philosophical anthropology as the start- ing point for any social analysis. Herbert Marcuse, who joined the Frankfurt School shortly after Fromm in 1932, is somewhat more difficult to categorize, although is (New York, 1961). This volume contained the first complete edition of Marx's Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts to reach a wide audience in this country. - a *^_ v -m w m « ^k. &gt;* k^ &amp; i« (wew York, i')bõ).</page><page sequence="6">290 SOCIAL RESEARCH his opposition to traditional, "scientific" Marxism was clear from the beginning of his scholarly career. In his days as a student of Martin Heidegger in the late twenties, Marcuse also displayed a considerable interest in anthropological questions and in his teacher's distinction between historicity (Geschichtlichkeit) and mere history. Significantly, Marcuse greeted the recovery of the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts with enormous enthusi- asm in an essay he contributed to Die Gesellschaft in 1932.17 His second major study of Hegel, Reason and Revolution,18 which he wrote after several years as an Institut member, was one of the first extensive presentations of the contents of Marx's early writ- ings to an English-speaking public. During his years with the Institut, which extended into the early forties, Marcuse admittedly lost much of his Heideggerian concern for questions about man's ontological reality. Still, in later works such as the Essay on Liber- ation, recent critics have been quick to find residues of his pre- Frankfurt School attitudes. Marcuse's mature stance towards Marxist Humanism has, how- ever, been more sceptical than Fromm's. "The objective identity of socialism and humanism," he wrote in 1965, "is dissolved. It was never an immediate identity: it was real to the extent to which the objective condition was seized and transcended in the con- sciousness of the historical subjects and in their action. This mediation is suppressed by the overwhelming power of technical progress welded into an instrument of totalitarian domination. . . . With the passing of the objective conditions for the identity of socialism and humanism, socialism cannot be made humanistic by committing socialist policy to the traditional humanistic values." 19 Marcuse's growing scepticism about the efficacy of merging humanism and socialism, which distanced him from Fromm, was it "Neue Quellen zur Grundlegung des historischen Materialismus," Die Gesell- schaft.

Here I am speaking primarily of Max Horkheimer, the Institutes director after 1930 and the chief architect of its "Critical Theory"; 20 Theodor W. Adorno, who joined officially in 1938, but was a close associate during the previous decade; Leo Lowen- thal, the managing editor of the Institutes Zeitschrift für Sozial- forschung, and Friedrich Pollock, Horkheimer's associate director and the Instituas administrative head. It was their work which constituted the core of what later became known as the Frankfurt School. Marcuse, of course, made significant contributions to the genesis of Critical Theory which should not be ignored. In under- standing how the Frankfurt School differed from Marxist Human- ism, however, it is more useful to concentrate on the work of Horkheimer and Adorno, who more unequivocally repudiated the anthropological elements in the humanist tradition.21 Adorno's role in this repudiation seems to have been crucial. In fact, if one had to pick a date when the Frankfurt School dis- tanced itself irrevocably from Marxist Humanism, it would have to be either 1938, when Adorno emigrated to America, or 1939, when Fromm departed from the Institut to pursue his own clini- cal and scholarly interests. Fromm's severance of his ties with Horkheimer and the others followed a number of years of grow- ing estrangement. Although personal difficulties complicated the picture, the primary reason for the break was a widening disagree- ment over the meaning of psychoanalysis. To Fromm, Freud's libido theory and biological determinism (i.e., the metapsycho- logical instinct theory) were incompatible with his more optimis- tic reading of Marx. To Horkheimer and Adorno, on the other hand, the libido theory, despite its tendency to hypostasize an immutable human nature, expressed something very crucial about 20 This became the name of the Frankfurt School's theoretical position after the publication of Horkheimer's essay "Traditionelle und kritische Theorie," Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, VI, 2 (1937). ziTherborns admission that "comparatively little space has been devoted to Adorno" in his essay (p. 95) helps explain why he neglects the distance between Critical Theory and Marxist Humanism.</page><page sequence="8">292 SOCIAL RESEARCH man's relationship to society, which Fromm and other so-called neo-orthodox revisionists like Karen Horney had misunderstood. What this insight was I will explain in a few moments, when other aspects of the Frankfurt School's critique of humanism have been clarified. Suffice it to say for now that Critical Theory's interest in psychoanalysis served a dialectical purpose in relation to the question of humanism: it brought it closer in the sense that it drew attention to the legitimacy of individual, personal gratifica- tion as against the claims of the totality, while at the same time distancing it by undermining the humanists' attempt to read society as a manifestation of the creator-subject, man. Before expanding on the role psychoanalysis played in leading Horkheimer and his colleagues away from humanism, other more obvious aspects of their critique should be spelled out. As Alfred Schmidt has noted,22 the Frankfurt School shared Marx's disdain for the abstract humanism of Feuerbach and was closer to the "real humanism" which Marx offered as an alternative in The Holy Family. "Real humanism" challenged the static implica- tions of Feuerbach's anthropology by making de-alienated man an historical potentiality rather than an inherent reality. The Frankfurt School's castigation of latter-day philosophical anthro- pologists such as Max Scheler rested on the same premise.23 The ultimate function of the phenomenologists' search for an eternal human essence, so Horkheimer and the others contended, was the reconciliation of man to his present, irrational condition. Talk- ing in broad generalities about a shared human nature was thus worse than sentimental: it was objectively reactionary. Here the members of the Frankfurt School shared that disdain for bourgeois humanism which informed such modern classics of Marxist literature as Brecht's Die Massnahme and Merleau- 22 "Adorno- ein Philosoph des realen Humanismus," Neue Rundschau, 80, IV (1969). 23 Horkheimer, "Bemerkungen zur philosophischen Anthropologie," ¿ettschrtft für Sozialforschung, IV, 1 (1935); Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," Negations, trans, by Jeremy J. Shapiro (Boston, 1968), originally Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, V, 1 (1936).</page><page sequence="9">MARXIST HUMANISM 293 Ponty's Humanism and Terror. They drew back, however, from fashioning their critique into a defense of Stalinism as Brecht, Merleau-Ponty, and others like them, each in his own way, had done. The crucial difference came as a result of their question- ing the assumption that the proletariat represented, even poten- tially, a truly universal class in whose name abstract, bourgeois humanism might be transcended. Whereas more orthodox Marx- ists had scorned the bourgeoisie's claim to universality, the Frank- furt School came increasingly to question the possibility of uni- versality itself. This led it away from socialist as well as bourgeois humanism in a way which will become more apparent when we return to its incorporation of Freudianism into Critical Theory. Before leaving the Frankfurt School's critique of philosophical anthropology, however, it should be noted that it was very closely related to another element in its theoretical position: a strong distrust of anthropomorphism. One of its key criticisms of ideal- ism was leveled against the implicit, and sometimes explicit, notion that consciousness could create the world. Horkheimer and his colleagues saw the ego cogito from Descartes to Husserl as an organ of that domination of nature by man which was at the root of the dialectic of the enlightenment. The Frankfurt School certainly did not encourage passivity or resignation, yet at the same time it was highly sceptical of man's ability to create the social world ex nihilo. Therborn's allegation that to the Frankfurt School, "society is always reducible to its creator- subject, and history is the continuous unfolding of this subject" 24 is manifestly untrue. In the Institut's earlier days such a state of affairs was seen as a desirable goal, but never a reality. In its later years, especially after Adorno's arrival as a full-time member, it was understood to be no more than an Utopian dream. Although the Frankfurt School's critique of anthropomorphism appeared most strongly in its discussions of idealism, traces of it can be found in its treatment of dialectical materialism as well. To Marx and all orthodox Marxists, man's most characteristic 24 op. cit., p. 77.</page><page sequence="10">294 SOCIAL RESEARCH activity, his means of self-realization, was labor. The labor process was understood to be constitutive of the totality of human exis- tence, including the cultural sphere. It was this priority of labor which made the derivative character of the superstructure a neces- sary component of Marxist thought. Within the Institut für Sozialforschung, the self-evident nature of these assumptions was the source of considerable debate. Marx- ist stalwarts of the old guard such as Henryk Grossmann and new entrants like Franz Neumann upheld Marx's belief in the cen- trality of labor. Marcuse, both in an article he wrote before join- ing the Institut 25 and in such works as Reason and Revolution,26 also accepted this position. Fromm, who was later to rechristen Freud's "genital character" as the "productive character,"27 ex- pressed special interest in the problem of alienated and de-alien- ated labor (although as a neo-Freudian, he argued that both love and work were aspects of productivity). Horkheimer and Adorno, on the other hand, were far less cer- tain about labor as the sole mode of human self-realization. As early as 1934, in the volume of aphorisms entitled Dämmerung which he published under the name Heinrich Regius, Hork- heimer called the centrality of the dialectic of labor into question. "To make labor into a transcendent human activity," he wrote, "is an ascetic ideology. ... In that socialists adhere to this gen- eral concept, they make themselves into carriers of capitalist prop- aganda."28 In the writings of Horkheimer and Adorno, the 25 "über die philosophischen Grundlagen des wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Ar- beitsbegriff/' Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, LXIX, 3 (June, 1933). 26 See, especially, p. 272ff. 27 Man for Himself (New York, 1947), p. 89ff. 28 Dämmerung (Zurich, 1934), p. 181. Accordingly, Horkheimer and Adorno were not convinced when Marx talked about the reconciliation of man and nature (see footnote 4) when in the same essay he could also write: Industry is the actual historical relationship of nature, and thus of natural science, to man. If industry is conceived as the exoteric manifestation of the essential human faculties, the human essence of nature and the natural essence of man can also be understood. . . . nature, as it develops through industry, though in an alienated form, is truly anthropological nature. (Italics in original.) (Ibid., pp. 163-164).</page><page sequence="11">MARXIST HUMANISM 295 alienation of labor plays a relatively minor role. By Negative Dialektik, his last major work, Adorno was expressly critical of the way in which Marx's early writings had been used ideologi- cally by humanists like Fromm.29 Although they did not deny the special role of the economy, and by extension the labor process, in capitalist society, they never de-historicized labor into man's "ontological" activity. Accordingly, they were reluctant to accept the merely reflective character of the cultural superstructure posited by more orthodox Marxists. While never minimizing the important influence of socio-economic factors on cultural phenomena, Horkheimer and Adorno always avoided reducing the latter to mere epiphenomena of the former. Jürgen Haber- mas's recent systematization of this insight into the separation of the two dialectics of labor and symbolically mediated interac- tion 30 owes much to the Frankfurt School's earlier qualms about the traditional Marxist interpretation of the labor process. Perhaps the major reason why Horkheimer and Adorno shied away from the orthodox view was that they detected elements of the domination of nature by man in the apotheosis of labor. A similar fear prevented their full acceptance of the socialization of the natural world which Marx had so often celebrated. It has sometimes been noted that one of the ironies of the Communist Manifesto is its unconcealed admiration for capitalism's ability to dominate all aspects of human existence. The overcoming of natural relations by social ones, albeit reified ones, was understood by Marx as a necessary prelude to the realm of freedom in which man would consciously control his social destiny. Lukács con- tinued this theme in History and Class Consciousness when he wrote, "To the degree to which capitalism carried out the sociali- zation of all relations it became possible to achieve self-knowledge of man as social being." 31 In his polemic against the pseudo- dialectical naturalism of Engels, Lukács was anxious to demon- io Negative Dialektik (Frankfurt, 1966), p. 189. so Technik und Wissenschaft als 'Ideologie' (Frankfurt, 1969). si History and Class Consciousness, trans, by Rodney Livingstone (Cambridge, Mass., 1971), p. 237.</page><page sequence="12">296 SOCIAL RESEARCH strate the uniquely social status of capitalism, despite its seeming to be a "second nature." He was furthermore interested in dem- onstrating that socialism would be the consummation of this process of socialization. In so doing, however, he tended to obscure what inevitably lies beyond man's control, remaining in the sphere of the natural even after the realm of freedom might be achieved. The Frankfurt School, in contrast to Lukács, was far less san- guine in viewing the capitalist socialization of the world as a fore- runner of socialist freedom. Instead, its members questioned the manipulative, instrumental attitude towards nature which this implied. Man as the measure of all things meant the denigration of nature into an external other. The complete socialization of the world, which was really the materialist version of anthropo- morphism, could only lead to the return of repressed nature in distorted and unforeseen ways.32 Humanism, in short, represented a kind of species imperialism which would ultimately work to the disadvantage of man himself. By refusing to rest its entire theoretical position on the founda- tion stone of labor and by rejecting the total socialization of the world as a desideratum, the Frankfurt School expressed perhaps its key anti-metaphysical insight: the rejection of identity theory, whether idealist or materialist. By identity theory is meant the belief that the ultimate oneness of subject and object, essence and appearance, particular and universal underlies the contra- dictions of the apparent world either inherently or potentially. Critical Theory's rejection of this assumption was the primary reason why it cannot be included among the variants of Marxist Humanism. One of the basic tenets of that position, as has often been noted,33 was the substitution of Hegel's "Absolute Spirit" and the vulgar Marxists' "socio-economic substructure" by "man as the sole creator-subject of the social world." Nowhere is this 32 This was an integral part of the Frankfurt School's interpretation of fascism. See Horkheimer's Eclipse of Reason (New York, 1947) and Horkheimer and Adorno, Dialektik der Aufklärung: (Amsterdam, 1947). 33 See, for example, Mihailo Markovié, "Humanism and Dialectic," Socialist Humanism, ed. by Erich Fromm, p. 85.</page><page sequence="13">MARXIST HUMANISM 297 more clearly shown than in History and Class-Consciousness, where the proletariat functions as the universal class, at once the subject and the object of history.34 Lukács - who later repudi- ated the book for reasons which were in certain ways questionable - was at least correct in pointing to the hidden idealism at the root of his reinterpretation of Marx. Horkheimer and Adorno, on the other hand, were hostile to- wards identity theory from the beginning. (Marcuse, it might be added, was far less so.) S5 In his contribution to the Festschrift for Carl Grünberg in 1930, Horkheimer made clear his rejection of Hegelian metaphysics because of its overemphasis on totality and its concomitant tendency to denigrate contingency as ulti- mately insignificant. Adorno's study of Kierkegaard,36 written for his Habilitation in 1931, attacked the Danish philosopher for smuggling in a secret identity theory behind the guise of his anti- Hegelian subjectivism. All throughout their earlier work, in which the dialectic of totality and moment is stressed, the nega- se To be fair to Lukács, however, it is necessary to mention that his book contains a rejection of static philosophical anthropology: By transforming philosophy into 'anthropology/ [Feuerbach] caused man to become frozen in a fixed objectivity and thus pushed both dialectics and history to one side. And precisely this is the great danger in every 'humanism' or anthropological point of view. For if man is made the measure of all things, and if with the aid of that assumption all transcendence is to be eliminated without man himself being measured against this criterion, without applying the same 'standard' to himself or - more exactly - without making man him- self dialectical, then man himself is made into an absolute and he simply puts himself in the place of those transcendental forces he was supposed to explain, dissolve and systematically replace, (p. 186-187) Yet, elsewhere in the text of History and Class Consciousness, Lukács permits himself to talk of a conception of nature as one in which we can clearly discern the ideal and the tendency to overcome the problems of a reified existence. 'Nature' here refers to authentic humanity, the true essence of man liberated from the false, mechanizing forms of society; man as a perfected whole who has inwardly overcome, or is in the process of over- coming, the dichotomies of theory and practice, reason and the senses, form and content; man whose tendency to create his own forms does not imply an abstract rationalism which ignores concrete content; man for whom freedom and necessity are identical, (p. 136-137). ss For a discussion of this point, see my article "The Metapolitics of Utopianism," Dissent (July-August, 1970); reprinted in The Revival of American Socialism, ed. by George Fischer et al. (New York, 1971). ** Kierkegaard: Konstruktion des Aesthetischen, 3rd ed. (Frankfurt, 1962).</page><page sequence="14">298 SOCIAL RESEARCH tivity of that dialectic was always acknowledged. Adorno's cele- brated statement in Minima Moralia that "the whole is the untrue' ' 37 was anticipated on numerous occasions in his and Hork- heimer's previous writings. It was this rejection of identity theory which underlay their hesitation about reducing culture to a function of the priority of labor. It was the same premise which allowed them to for- swear the radical essentialism of those who would deny the reality of the contingent world.38 It was the same insistence on the in- evitably unreconciled negativity of the dialectic which made the de-alienated, universal, species man of the humanist vision no more than an Utopian dream in their eyes. In short, for all its fury against the reification and alienation fostered by capitalism, the Frankfurt School could not join the Marxist Humanists in positing a world entirely free of those conditions. As Adorno once wrote in an essay on Aldous Huxley, "humanity includes reification as well as its opposite, not merely as the condition from which liberation is possible, but also positively, as the form in which, however brittle and inadequate it may be, subjective im- pulses are realized, but only by being objectified." 8Ô The source of the Frankfurt School's dislike of identity theory and, by extension, of its humanist expression, is difficult to estab- lish with complete certainty. Horkheimer's philosophical interest had been first aroused by Schopenhauer, whose pessimistic denial that the world could become rational or that will and idea might be reconciled made a lasting impression on his thinking.40 37 Minima Moralia (Frankfurt, 1951), p. 80. ss Adorno s study of Husserl, Zur Metakritik aer iLrnenntnistneorie Stuttgart, 1956), which was written mostly during the 1930 's, makes this point very frequently. It also appears in much of his cultural criticism. For example, in his study of Veblen, Adorno wrote: "As the reflection of truth, appearances are dialectical; to reject all appearance is to fall completely under its sway, since truth is abandoned with the rubble without which it cannot appear." (Prisms, trans, by Samuel and Shierry Weber (London, 1967), p. 84). 89 prisms, p. 1Ü6. «o The first philosophical book Horkheimer ever read was Schopenhauer's Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit, which Pollock gave him when they were in Brussels together before the first world war.

In fact, his overriding interest in aesthetics may have meant that he saw reconciliation as a cultural rather than a social potentiality - although he frequently berated other cultural critics for isolating the two spheres. Whatever the initial source, the Frankfurt School's growing interest in psychoanalysis in the 1930's intensified its movement away from identity theory and Marxist Humanism. Although Freudianism has often been acknowledged as an enrichment of their Hegelianized Marxism, few commentators have seen its central role in the evolution of Critical Theory. This is not surprising in that the Instituas true attitude towards orthodox psychoanalysis remained obscure until the publication of the heavily Freudian The Authoritarian Personality in 1950.41 Several years before, however, Horkheimer had admitted to Lowenthal that "we really are deeply indebted to Freud and his first collaborators. His thought is one of the Bildungsmächte (foundation stones) without which our philosophy would not be what it is." 42 That psychoanalysis functioned in the Frankfurt School's phi- losophy to distance it from Marxist Humanism may seem para- doxical, as Erich Fromm was the primary exponent of its merger with Critical Theory in the 1930's.43 In later years, when he be- came one of the most vociferous champions of Marxist Human- ism, Fromm saw no conflict between that position and his revised Freudianism. His task in reconciling the two, however, was made much easier by the jettisoning of several key Freudian concepts, including the libido theory, the Oedipus complex, and the bio- logical determinism of the instinct theory.

This appraisal of the counter-humanist function of psycho- analysis in the Frankfurt School's work will probably seem even more curious when measured against Marcuse's later treatment of Freud in Eros and Civilization ,44 which claims to be an extra- polation from orthodox Freudianism rather than a revision. Despite their obvious differences, Marcuse's use of Freud equalled Fromm's in arousing cries of protest from anti-anthropological critics. One of their number, Neil Mclnnes, has recently gone so far as to accuse Marcuse of reviving idealism in his rendering of Freud: Eros is just a reincarnation of the universal class, of the essence of man and the Gattungswesen. Its Freudian dress keeps slipping, to reveal such familiar avatars as "the integral satisfaction of total man," "the complete individual," "the metaphysical plenitude of total man" and the "realized concept of man." This resuscitation, from young Marx and Hegel, of the unitary theory of mind in- volves a serious retrogression from Freud, since Freud destroyed the monolithic notion of personality by showing the fact of con- flicts between motives. Instead, Marcuse revives the legend that all motives really seek the same thing - "gratification, fulfilment, peace and happiness." This accords well with absolute idealism (all particular motives subserve the whole mind, just as all par- ticular individuals must serve the totality of society) but it does not accord with the facts, which indicate that men and motives want different things, to the point of acute conflict.45 Whether or not Mclnnes's characterization of Marcuse's use of Freud is entirely accurate, it would be misleading to assume that Marcuse, or Fromm before him, spoke for the other members of the Frankfurt School on the question of psychoanalysis. Both Horkheimer and Adorno had been interested in Freudian theory since the 1920's. In 1927, Adorno, with Horkheimer's encourage- ment, wrote a lengthy study of the relationship between psycho- analysis and the transcendental phenomenology of one of his teachers, Hans Cornelius.46 In the following year, Horkheimer «(Boston, 1955). « Neil Mclnnes, "From Marx to Marcuse," Survey, 16, 1 (Winter, 1971), p. 153. **Der Begriff des Unbewussten in der tranzendentalen Seelenlehre (Cronberg i. t., unpublished, 1927).</page><page sequence="17">Above: Albert Einstein Right: Edmund Husserl Below: Max Weber</page><page sequence="18">Above: Berthold Brecht Right: Max Reinhardt Below: Walter Gropius</page><page sequence="19">Left: Max Liebermann and Heinrich Mann Center: Prof. Liebermann at opening of memorial exhibit "Goethe and his World," Berlin, 1932.

Its purpose, he was later to recall,47 was more to learn the theory from the inside than to cure any serious neurosis. In 1929, he persuaded Landauer to form the Frankfurt Psychoana- lytic Institute, which brought Erich Fromm, his wife, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann,48 and Heinrich Meng to Frankfurt. Of these, only Fromm maintained a connection with the Institut für So- zialforschung after 1933. As noted earlier, his relationship with Horkheimer and the other members of the Institutes inner circle soon grew seriously strained, resulting, at least on the theoretical level, from his abandonment of Freud's theories of the libido and the instincts. Although in the early thirties, Horkheimer had reacted warmly toward Fromm's attempts to integrate psychology and sociology,49 by the end of the decade he was becoming in- creasingly wary of what he viewed as the overly facile way in which Fromm was effecting that integration. The rejection of the libido theory, he argued, was tantamount to the impoverish- ment of depth psychology itself. "Psychology without libido," he wrote Lowenthal in 1942, "is in a way no psychology. . . . Psychol- ogy in its proper sense is always psychology of the individual." 50 The libido, which implied a level of human existence beyond im- mediate social control, was an indispensable concept for the pre- vention of the premature reconciliation of society and individual.

Horkheimer then "became a defender of orthodox Freudianism, and considered Freud as a true revolutionary because of his materialistic attitude toward sex. . . .

Similarly, Fromm's notion of a "social character," which he had developed during the thir- ties,52 was a misleading representation of the condition of modern man. "The stress on totality," Adorno wrote in 1946, "as against the unique, fragmentary impulses, always implies the harmonistic belief in what might be called the unity of the personality and what is never realized in our society. It is one of the greatest merits of Freud that he has debunked the myth of this unity." 58 In short, Horkheimer and Adorno came to admire Freud not because psychoanalysis could provide a model for a universal hu- man nature, but because its asocial, biological premises expressed, at least metaphorically, one aspect of the non-identity of man in an unreconciled totality. "In an antagonistic society," Adorno was to write in 1955, "each individual is non-identical with him- self, both social and psychological at once, and, because of the split, maimed from the outset." 54 Moreover, although it was never spelled out explicitly, the Frankfurt School also seemed to appre- ciate in Freud an awareness that the socialization of the world, which both Marx and Lukács had celebrated, could never fully eradicate the natural side of men. In fact, they came increasingly to see Freud as a bulwark against the false identity which threatened man in the post-war period (false in the sense that the rational reconciliation of contradictions in this group.

Fromm spoke of the "character matrix common to all members of the group." By the time he wrote Escape from Freedom (New York, 1951), he was using the term "social character" to describe "a selection of traits, the essential nucleus of the character structure of most members of a group which has developed as the result of the baste experiences and mode of life common to that group/' (Italics in the original, p. 239 in English version entitled Fear of Freedom (London, 1942).) 53 Social Science and Sociological lendencies in Fsycnoanarysis, (unpublished paper dated April 26, 1946, p. 6, in Lowenthal's personal collection). 54 "Sociology and Psychology," first in Sociologica (Frankfurt, 1955), then in New Left Review, 46 (November-December, 1967) and 47 (January-February, 1968).

In a tangibly antagonistic society, men may have been maimed, as Adorno had argued, but at least the tension produced by their self-contradiction prevented them from accepting this condition without protest. In what Marcuse was later to popularize as "one-dimensional society," 55 this was no longer the case. With the increasing liquidation of subjectivity, a kind of identity had been achieved - but it was one which was a mockery of the dream of classical idealism and Marxist Human- ism. What perhaps most distinguished the Frankfurt School in the post-war era from its Weimar days was a growing suspicion that the dream had itself contained the mockery. As Horkheimer wrote to Lowenthal in 1950: Included in dialectics is what brings it to sublation (Aufhebung). Since, however, sublation presupposes spirit and with it subjec- tivity, the process which goes beyond the spirit must contain the raw destruction of the moment instead of its preservation. That is the meaning of the anxiety that mankind might be at its end. We must work on the analysis of this anxiety, not in the psycho- logical, but in the philosophical and social-theoretical sense. It could be that everything which until now has passed for spirit carries something of infantilism . . . [there is] in our anxiety an element of children's cries. We must only guard against its molli- fication by the chastening voice of the father.56 The yearning for a non-antagonistic society in which this would not be the case was never, to be sure, explicitly abandoned in their work. De-alienated man in a rational society was never com- pletely laid to rest as an assumed desideratum. Yet, in the later writings of Horkheimer and Adorno, that inherent caution which ß5 One-dimensional Man (Boston, 1964). e« Letter from Horkheimer to Lowenthal, December 31, 1950 (in Lowenthal's personal collection). Many years later, and without knowing about this letter, Hans Mayer, the distinguished Marxist literary critic, wrote an essay on Adorno which closed with the following words: "He succeeded in not becoming an adult, without remaining infantile." The words were, in fact, Adorno's own and were originally applied to his teacher Alban Berg. Mayer thought they were applicable to Adorno himself.

This is most clearly shown in Horkheimer's recent return to his early interest in Schopenhauer, an interest sparked by Schopenhauer's rejection of Hegel's identity theory and optimism about the inexorability of human progress. For both Schopenhauer and Horkheimer, positive reconciliation, as well as the Marxist Hu- manist dream of a species man, was ideology. As Horkheimer wrote in the 1960's, Hegel's teaching shows that the positivity that distinguishes him from Schopenhauer cannot ultimately stand up. The failure of a logically stringent system in its highest form in Hegel, means the logical end of attempts at a philosophical justification of the world, the end of the claim of philosophy to emulate positive theology. All these attempts rest directly or indirectly on the idea of the world as the work or expression of true mind. But if the world, in its essence and in its actual condition, is not necessarily con- nected with mind, philosophic confidence in the very existence of truth disappears. In that case, truth can be found only in perish- able men themselves and is as perishable as they are.57 In short, to Horkheimer and Adorno (although the latter's inter- est in Schopenhauer seems to have been less intense), in contingent man, not species man, lay the real locus of human freedom. This has certainly taken us a long way from the heady optimism of History and Class-consciousness or, for that matter, from the generally hopeful tone of the Frankfurt School's decade in Weimar and first years in New York. During that time, the shadowy presence of what might be called a negative anthropology in its work was enough to sustain a certain measure of revolutionary confidence. When in later years the sobering implications of Critical Theory's stress on non-identity were worked out against the backdrop of an increasingly quiescent proletariat, this confi- dence dwindled to insignificance. Without a "scientific" Marxist belief in the automatic heightening of capitalism's structural con- tradictions or a humanist Marxist faith in the assertion of uni- versal man as the creator of history, Horkheimer and his colleagues 57 "Schopenhauer Today," The Crittcal Spirit, ed. by Kurt H. Wolff and Barring- ton Moore, Jr. (Boston, 1967), p. 67.</page><page sequence="25">MARXIST HUMANISM 305 were at a loss to identify the agency, if any, of social change. Marcusens pessimism was similar, but his seems to have been tem- pered by a continuing confidence - at least on the theoretical level - in de-alienated, species man as an historical possibility, however remote. In the course of this mounting scepticism, it has seemed to some observers that the Frankfurt School had retreated to the higher ground of cultural elitism and contemplative philosophy, that non-identity was a cover for the return to bourgeois liberalism, and that theory became a substitute for praxis instead of its prel- ude. No one, however, who has really immersed himself in Crit- ical Theory would be satisfied with such formulations of the School's position. For, if Horkheimer and his colleagues refused to negate contingent man in the name of universal man, they were equally reluctant to absolutize the solitary individual at the ex- pense of his social side. Absolute isolation and absolute solidarity, to phrase it differently, were equally anathema. The individual was always to be understood as mediated through the non-identical totality, never as an end-point in himself. In emphasizing the negative moment in the dialectical process, they fostered a critical awareness which both scientific and humanist Marxism seemed to lack. And in so doing, the Frankfurt School preserved the hope of a more truly humane society inhabited by concrete men rather than by the abstract subjects of the humanists, with whom they have so often been confused.</page></plain_text>
