PROULX 16 Taking human heads in warfare as trophies for ritualistic purposes was common in Southeast Asia, West Africa and South America until recent times. Infrequent occurrences of this practice can be docu- mented from almost every part of the globe. The most famous among modern primitives who practice headhunting are the Jibaro of Ecuador and Peru who shrink the decapitated heads of their enemies by an elaborate process of stripping the skin from the skull, boiling it, and completing the job using hot sand and pebbles. Other South American tribes, such as the Tupinumba of Brazil, impaled the heads of slain enemies on the pointed tips of palisades in order to demonstrate their prowess in warfare and to mock the dead man. Often headhunting was associated with cannibalism or human sacrifice, the brain being eaten to gain the power of the dead warrior. The Dyak of Borneo take heads to commemorate the death of their chief, while several tribes in New Guinea use the heads for initiation ceremonies of the young males. The reasons for headhunting are as varied as the peo- ples who practice it. Perhaps no area has a longer tradition of headhunt- ing than ancient Peru. Because of the extreme aridity of the Peruvian coast, archaeologists have excavated mummified specimens of trophy heads dating back to the preceramic period, prior to 2000 b.c. The most extensive occurrence of this practice is found on the south coast, particularly in the lea and Nasca Valleys. The Paracas Culture and the succeeding Nasca Cul- ture were located here. Each had a warfare pattern and religious mythology intricately bound to the tak- ing of human heads. Numerous examples of trophy head representations are known from the pottery, tex- tiles and pyro-engraved gourds of these cultures. In- ferences from the art motifs as well as preserved ex- amples of trophy heads found singly or in caches have shed additional light on the role of the trophy head in the religious practices of these south coastal peoples. The earliest evidence of head collecting in ancient Peru occurs at the late preceramic site of Asia on the central coast, dating to approximately 2000 B.c. Fred- eric Engel excavated forty-nine burials here, two of which consisted of headless adult skeletons. Four other interments contained only several heads, one of these (grave 10) being a cache of four skulls, one adult and three children. The facial skin of the adult had been cut off and a deep incision cut across the forehead parallel to the brow ridges. Unlike some of the later Peruvian trophy heads, these had no further modifica- tions. Head collecting seems to have been sporadic until the beginning of the Early Horizon, about 1300 B.c., when a fully developed agricultural economy permitted the rapid growth of high civilizations.</page><page sequence="2">Map of Peru. Chronological Chart of ancient cultures on the Peruvian Coast. The Late Paracas "Oculate Being" with knife and severed trophy head. This is one of the earli- est representations of this motif on the south coast of Peru. 17 During the Early Horizon Peru was dominated by two main cultures: Chavin in the north and central portions and Paracas on the south coast. There are a few examples of trophy head representations in Chavin art, particularly in the stone sculpture, but these de- pictions are not frequent, and do not seem to be con- nected with the religion of this culture. It appears that trophy head collecting had a secular function; it was merely a technique of warfare with little, if any, religious connotation. In the Paracas Culture, on the other hand, taking heads was not only a warfare pat- tern, but it became an integral part of their religion. Depictions of trophy heads do not appear on Paracas pottery until Phase 9 or on textiles or gourds until Phase 10, these two phases dating to the very end of the Early Horizon. It is unclear how this pattern was introduced to the south coast; it may have been a sporadic local pattern, or it may have been introduced through Chavin influences. The trophy head motif is frequently portrayed in association with mythical creatures in Paracas art. In Phase 9 there are several examples of the "Oculate Being," a wide-eyed mythical creature holding a trophy head clutched in one hand and a knife, which was used to remove the head, in the other hand.

HEADHUNTING continued A trophy head found in the Nasca Valley, south coastal Peru, belonging to the Nasca Culture. This specimen has the carrying rope and pinned lips. 18 Phase 10 the Anthropomorphic Mythical Being makes its appearance in the textile medium. This creature is basically human in form with feline attributes pri- marily in the facial region. He is usually shown with a mouth mask having lateral elements in the form of a cat's whiskers, a forehead ornament, bangles in the hair, and a long cloak terminating in a feline's head and paws. The trophy head is usually clutched by the hair in one of the hands, as with the Oculate Being. A club or knife is found in the other hand. Other ex- amples of trophy heads can be seen on pyro-engraved gourds. Archaeological investigation has substantiated the frequent depictions of trophy heads in the religious art. In 1956 Alejandro Pezzia Assereto of the Museo Regional de Ica discovered a cache containing two trophy heads on the Hacienda Ocucaje in the lea Val- ley. The cache was found on the north side of a small hill in a cemetery dating to the Paracas period. The heads were located very close to the surface and were oriented toward the northeast. In 1966 Pezzia found a second cache at Ocucaje, this one containing 13 heads. They were arranged horizontally in a north- west direction, and had been placed under a textile. In both caches some of the skulls had been artificially deformed. Paracas trophy heads were prepared in the follow- ing manner. After the head had been severed from the body, the cervical vertebrae and remainder of the neck were removed. Next the foramen magnum was enlarged, sometimes being expanded up to the oc- cipital protuberance. The brain and soft tissue of the skull were then removed through this aperture. A hole was pierced through the frontal bone at the cen- ter of the forehead, and a cotton cord was extended through the hole for use as a carrying rope. The eye orbits were either left empty or filled with a black resinous substance. Often rags were placed in the cranial cavity, and these often can be seen protrud- ing from the eye sockets. Finally the lips were pinned shut with one or two thorns, perhaps for ritualistic purposes. The hair was often ornamented, and some- times a warrior's head was wrapped with a sling. The Paracas Culture developed into the Nasca Cul- ture and marked the beginning of the Early Interme- diate Period. The dividing point between the cultures is arbitrary, the main criteria being the switch from post-fired paints to slip paints on the pottery. Nasca was the pinnacle of trophy head collecting in ancient Peru. The religious connotation of the trophy heads, which began with Paracas, continues in Nasca. Judging from the archaeological evidence, Nasca religion re- volved around a series of mythical beings (or deities in a very general sense) who had certain functions in</page><page sequence="4">The Nasca mythical Killer Whale holding a trophy head in its human hand.

It was probably very comparable to the religious mythology of ancient Greece, where each god in the pantheon had a certain function and was the subject of certain myths. Several of the Nasca mythical creatures are always associated with trophy heads, while others have agricultural functions. As in ancient Greece, most of the religious depictions are on pottery, but in Peru there was no written record to give us details of the mythologies. The leading entity among these mythical personages was the Anthropomorphic Mythical Being, who had his origins in the Paracas Culture. By early Nasca times five distinct varieties of this creature were known. The most frequent type has been described above in connection with Paracas ; he is shown holding a trophy head in one hand and a club or knife in the other. Another variety of the Anthropomorphic Mythical Being is depicted holding a head in both hands and eating it. There is a Mythical Killer Whale drawn with human arms, holding a head in one hand and a knife in the other. Finally there is a creature called the Horrible Bird having the head of a hawk with a long spiked beak, the body of a bird and human legs. This monster is always eating a trophy head which is clutched in its beak, and in his body, in X-ray fashion, are several trophy heads which have been ingested. Trophy heads also appear as independent motifs on some of the pottery. Several excellent specimens of trophy heads from the Nasca Valley are in the collections of the Museo Regional de Ica. These conform in most detail to those of the Paracas Culture and were prepared in the same manner. Most of the trophies have been found</page><page sequence="5">A Nasca jar portraying a series of trophy heads with carrying ropes.

HEADHUNTING continued individually and represent slain enemy. Headless Nasca burials have also been found, indicating that reciprocal head taking was present. Nasca potters also made large jars, modeled in the form of trophy heads. These "head jars" are found in many burials and may represent imitations of the ritually powerful heads which the buried individual may not have been fortu- nate to have collected himself, or they may have served as replacements for heads which had been taken. Not enough Nasca graves had been excavated scientifi- cally to test this theory, but there is at least one un- substantiated report of one of these jars being used for this purpose. Although we cannot reconstruct the mythologies of the Paracas and Nasca peoples, we can attempt to ex- plain the role of the trophy heads in these cultures. We might begin by ruling out some of the possibil- ities. Nasca, and to a lesser extent Paracas, spread their cultures over the south coastal area by military means. This can be demonstrated archaeologically by the sud- den appearance of their pottery in new areas, the pres- ence of fortified cities, and the prevalence of weapons in their graves. However, because of the frequent as- sociations of the trophy heads with mythical beings, it is immediately evident that the main purpose for tak- ing the heads was not merely for the purpose of dis- 20</page><page sequence="6">A Nasca "head jar" with pinned lips. A Nasca jar painted with individual trophy heads. Carrying ropes extend from their foreheads. play as a trophy of war. This may have been one of the functions of head taking, but not the primary one. Furthermore there is no evidence to suggest cannibal- ism or human sacrifice as part of this ritual. It is also very unlikely that the heads were used in initiation ceremonies for boys, a function which trophy heads serve in some societies such as the Asmat of New Guinea. And finally we can discount any function the head may have had for fertility of the crops. There are separate mythical beings associated with plants, and trophy heads are never associated with these par- ticular creatures. If we assume that the main purpose for headhunt- ing was ritualistic, we are then faced with several possibilities. The first explanation might be that the heads were meant to be offerings to the mythical be- ings. This concept is supported by the pottery and textile representations illustrating these creatures eat- ing the heads and by the grouping of heads together into caches. Since we lack documentary evidence, we can only speculate about the myths. These myths may have involved the idea of feeding heads to the mythi- cal beings, but the act of eating the head may only symbolize ferocity or bravery in warfare. A more logical explanation involves the taking of a head either to gain the power of the slain enemy or to prevent his soul or spirit from harming the killer. The fact that the lips of the trophy head are pinned shut in- dicates that they were trying to prevent the loss of the soul or power embodied within. An analogous situation can be cited regarding the modern Jibaro Indians. The Jibaro practiced ritual murder to gain the soul of the dead man, and their purpose for taking the head, shrink- ing it, and sewing up the lips was to prevent the aveng- ing soul (the Muisak) , which was embodied within the head, from harming the killer. Certainly the head was something powerful to the Paracas and Nasca peoples, something on which their mythical beings thrived. The skillful warrior gained stature and power by his military prowess, but the ritualistic aspects were even more important. The tradition of headhunting for ritual purposes continued through the Middle Horizon with the ex- pansion of the Huari Culture throughout most of Peru. Trophy heads are still associated with predom- inantly religious motifs. Even the Incas took heads, but by this time the function had again become secular. The Spanish chroniclers report that the Incas cele- brated victories by parading the heads of their enemies on the tips of lances. The religions had changed from the gruesome mythical beings of the Paracas and Nasca Cultures to more benevolent deities, but the tradition of headhunting continued until the Spanish conquest.
