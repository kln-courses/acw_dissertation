Viano Biomedicai Science Department General Motors Research Laboratories Warren, MI Charles Y. Warner and Stanley D. Alien Brigham Young University Provo, UT OVERVIEW Many different surrogates (animals, human cadavers and anthropomorphic dummies) have been used to model human impact responses and injury mechanisms. In investigations involving physio- logical or functional responses, an animal model is the only suitable surrogate. Many experiment- al studies have typically involved an anesthe- tized quadrupedal animal oriented in an unnatural body posture, either upright to simulate a seated subject (1-10)* or supine to facilitate experimentation (2,11-14). The question natural- *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. 1 ABSTRACT ' The influence of body posture, and inher- ently support, on thoracic impact response was investigated in an animal model. Anesthetized and postmortem domestic swine were exposed to blunt, midsternal loading while supported in their natural quadrupedal posture, and the results were compared with previously reported data from similar tests involving an upright body orientation. Twelve male animals were tested, six while anesthetized and six post- mortem. Each animal was impacted once by a 21 kg rigid mass with a flat contact interface moving at a nominal velocity of either 8 or 10 m/s. Measured mechanical responses included applied load, sternal and spinal accelerations, thoracic compression and aortic overpressure. Injury response was assessed from a thoracico- abdominal necropsy. In addition, ECG traces were recorded pre and postimpact to monitor electrophysiological response. A comparison of results indicates generally higher forces and sternal accelerations and markedly different injury profiles and cardiac arrhythmias for subjects tested in the quadru- pedal rather than upright orientation. The anes- thetized animals suspended in their natural posture sustained serious pulmonary hemorrhage without skeletal damage, whereas the upright- suspended subjects suffered multiple rib frac- tures and instances of liver laceration. ECG changes occurred in both postures, although these were generally of minor severity for the quadrupedal orientation. Ventricular fibril- lation did not occur in any natural posture test despite peak sternal accelerations up to 1300 g 's, but occurred in all upright posture tests with peak sternal accelerations exceeding 700 głs. In this preliminary study pretest body posture and support appeared to have a signifi- cant influence on impact responses, injuries, and electrocardiographic changes. 3576 0096-736X/80/8804-3576$02.50 Copyright © 1980 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">ly arises as to whether there might be signifi- cant postural-related differences in the animal's response to experimental impact exposures. In preliminary experiments to address this question, six anesthetized and six postmortem (i.e., sacrificed four days prior to testing) domestic swine (Sitò òcKO^a.) were exposed to a thoracic impact while suspended in a natural quadrupedal posture. The results of these tests were compared with data from a previous study (9) where similar impacts were performed on thirteen animals in an upright-seated position. Because of various differences in experimental methodologies for the two studies, the findings should be viewed as preliminary and approximate. In an additional phase of this study impact response differences were assessed between anesthetized and postmortem animals tested in the quadrupedal posture. METHODOLOGY The impact procedure was basically similar to that of a previous study (9) in which thirteen swine, eight anesthetized and five postmortem, were supported in an upright position and exposed to blunt midsternal thoracic impact. Since the results of these two studies will be compared, they will hereafter be referred to as the 'H' and 'V' Studies, designating horizontal (quadru- pedal) and vertical (upright) orientations of the longitudinal body axis, respectively. TEST CONDITIONS - In both studies a 21 kg rigid impacting mass struck the thorax at a velocity of either 8 or 10 m/s. The contacting interface was an unpadded 15.6 cm diameter wooden block with a 1.3 cm edge radius to prevent localized loading at the perimeter. The impact load was applied at midsternum in the ventral- dorsal direction. Anesthetized and postmortem subjects were tested at both velocity levels (Table 1). Setup for the 'V' Study - Maintaining the subject in the upright posture for impact requir- ed supporting the head and upper body by tether- ing the forelegs and snout to a point above the animal while resting the hindquarters, with rear legs extended, on a plastic mattress (Fig. 1). Immediately prior to impact, the foreleg and snout tethers were released so the animal could respond in an unrestrained manner (i.e., model- ling earlier human cadaver experiments (9,15)). However, it was not possible to precisely control the site of impact with this scheme, so that the center of contact actually varied from approxi- mately 10 cm above to 4 cm below midsternum. Setup for the 'H' Study - A natural quadru- pedal orientation was provided by a horizontal canvas sling with openings for the legs (Fig. 2) . A coarse mesh material was placed over the midsternal area. The sling was supported with parallel bars hung from the ceiling, and a rope and pulley assembly was used to control the height and impact site. This arrangement pro- vided good control and repeatability of pretest geometries. The impactor was a pneumatically driven piston (16) located under the animal and fired vertically. The suspension system included locking elastic retractors which partially followed the animal's upward whole-body motion after impact and reduced secondary loadings as the animal fell back into the sling. MEASUREMENTS - The impact severity level, as indicated by the contact velocity, was con- trolled by impactor operating pressure in the 'H' Study and shock-cord extension in the 'V' Study. Contact velocity was calculated in the 'H' Study by numerically differentiating the impactor displacement-time relationship prior to load- time-zero (animal contact) . In the 'V' Study the slope of the impactor displacement- time curve was determined graphically. The measured mechanical parameters were: 1. contact force (GMR spider load cell) 2. sternal acceleration (Endevco 2264- TABLE 1 Test Matrix Nominal Number Posture Subject Type Velocity of Tests 8 m/s 4 Anesthetized 10 m/s 4 Vertical Postmortem i » 8 m/s 2 10 m/s 3 8 m/s 2 C Anesthetized Postmortem * »» » 10 8 m/s m/s 4 2 Postmortem ^ » 8 m/s 2 10 m/s 4 3577</page><page sequence="3">3578 M.

Study: Kulite Model MCP-080-9R, catheter tip pressure transducer) . The contact force, inertially compensated to correct for load cell acceleration, was measured along the impact axis. Sternal and spinal accelerations were measured with miniature piezoresistive accelero- meters. The sternal accelerometer was mounted to the underside of a protective metal shield and the latter attached to the sternum with bone screws. The spinal accelerometer was mounted to a bracket which was securely clamped to the surgically exposed vertebral spinous process opposite the sternal impact site. Thoracic compression was determined by differential string potentiometers (9) , one attached to the impactor and another to the spinal accelerometer mounting bracket. These transducer outputs were electronically subtracted to yield dynamic chest compression. Also, two physiological parameters, aortic blood pressure and electrocardiogram, were monitored for approximately one half hour pre and postimpact in the anesthetized subjects. ANIMAL PROTOCOL - The test subjects were male, crossbred domestic swine. The animals were maintained at the Veterinary Pathology Laboratory of Brigham Young University and received no feed for 24 hours and no water for 6 hours before testing. Animal procedures were somewhat different for the two studies so that each protocol will be discussed separately. 'V1 Study - Ketamine hydrochloride (25-50 mg/kg) was injected intramuscularly as a preanes- thetic restraining agent and was supplemented with atropine sulfate (.066-. 088 mg/kg) to minimize secretions. The animal was then placed on the surgical table and deeply anesthetized using an inhalation technique (2% initial and .2-. 6% maintenance concentrations of methoxy- flurane, supplemented with N2O/O2) via a trache- ostomy. A pressure sensing catheter was insert- ed in the right common carotid artery and posi- tioned in the aortic arch. Midsagittal incisions were made at the sternal level of the fourth intercostal space over the sternum and opposite this location on the spine for accelerometer</page><page sequence="4">THORACIC IMPACT 3579 implantation. Needle electrodes were inserted to monitor a modified ECG lead II. Approximately thirty minutes after impact the animal was sacrificed by exsanguination. Preparation of postmortem subjects involved the same initial procedures and anesthesia protocol. Also a balloon catheter was inserted in the abdominal aorta to the level of the diaphragm. The animal was euthanized by sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg IV), left at room temperature for 4 to 5 hours, placed in a cooler (4 C) for 60 to 70 hours, then maintained at room temperature for approximately four hours prior to the test. A catheter tip pressure transducer was positioned in the aortic arch via the right common carotid artery. The left common carotid was cannulated and connected to a reservoir of saline. The abdominal balloon catheter was inflated, and, immediately before impact the thoracic arterial system was pressur- ized to between 50 and 150 mm Hg. 'H' Study - Differences in animal protocol from the łVł Study include: 1. The preanesthetic agents were Ketamine hydrochloride (33.0 mg/kg) and Acepromazine (.37 mg/kg) . 2. The inhalation anesthetic was halo- thane (5% initial and 2.5% maintenance supple- mented with N2O/O2) . 3. Four paste-on skin ECG electrodes were used to monitor leads I, II, III, AVL, AVR, and AVF. 4. Euthanasia was by electrocution. 5. Less control was exercised over the pretest temp era ture- time profiles of the post- mortem animals. A complete thoracico-abdominal necropsy was performed following each impact experiment. BODY MEASUREMENTS - Crossbred domestic swine weighing approximately 60 kg were obtained from the Brigham Young University Farm, Swine Unit. A comparison of the animals used in the two studies shows (Table 2) that the 'H' Study group had deeper chests (12%) and were somewhat lighter (8%) than the fVł Study group. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The influence of body posture and support on the impact response of anesthetized and postmortem swine has been examined using both mechanical and biological measures (Table 3) . MECHANICAL PARAMETERS - A comparison of the mechanical responses for the TVf and łHł Studies reveals trends which appear to reflect a postural influence on thoracic impact responses in this animal model.* Tables 4a and 4b provide a complete list of maximum values for the force, compression, acceleration and aortic overpressure responses for the vertical and horizontal orien- tation studies, respectively. Table 5 presents a comparison of the mean maxima for each para- meter and test condition, and Table 6 presents a similar comparison for the anesthetized and postmortem subjects of the łHł Study. Figs. 3 and 4 are composites of the force-time and force-compression relationships, respectively, enabling a qualitative*^ comparison of the waveforms. Finally, Fig. 5 is a typical set of analog response records from the THf Study. *Note that the low velocity postmortem compari- son is in disagreement with the trends observed for the force, compression, and accelerations in the other three comparisons (Table 5) . Since there were only two tests of this type in each study and the two 'H1 Study responses differed widely, this counter-trend is of questionable significance. +The force-compression plots for the !Vf Study have been reproduced from Reference 9. As explained therein, the peak compression values scaled from these plots differ somewhat from the corresponding tabulated maxima because two different analysis methods were used. The tabulated values are given in Table 4a and have been used in the quantitative comparison of Table 5.

In all cases there is an early rise to the maximum value. For the fHf Study the peak force is typically followed by a pronounced drop to a plateau level which is then sustained for 35-40% of the pulse duration. The łVł Study waveforms display more variation after the initial peak, possibly due to differences in the location and alignment of the contact interface. This is partially supported by the significantly differ- ent force-deformation responses observed in a prior study by moving the center of impact 12 cm above or below midsternum (refer to Figs. 2 and 3 of Reference 10) . The most obvious waveform difference is the shorter duration and lower impulse of the force- time histories for the horizontally oriented animal impacts.

The pneumatic striker used in the 'H' Study was subject to some air-braking before completion of the loading event. This was not the case for the shock-cord-propelled striker used in the fVT Study. Thus, even though the striker masses were identical and the contact velocities were very similar for the two studies, the impact exposures were somewhat different. This is further evidenced by the lower thoracic compressions for the TH' Study (Tables 4a, 4b, and 5). However, premature air- braking of the striker mass would not affect responses occurring early in the impact event, such as the maximum contact force and thoracic accelerations . As shown in Table 5, the mean peak applied forces were 5-20% higher and the mean peak sternal accelerations were 25-50% higher for the THł Study than those for the 'V1 Study. A possible explanation for this is that a more nearly square contact interface was achieved with the horizontally oriented animals. Mean peak spinal acceleration was also higher for the 'HT orientation, although there exists consider- able variation in this parameter even among similarly tested animals. It was suggested in Reference 9 that this variation might be the result of differences in the extent of skeletal damage and/or local motions at the spinal accel- Fig. 4b - Contact force (kN) versus chest com- pression^ (cm) - postmortem subjects upper left - low velocity, vertical tests upper right - low velocity, horizontal tests lower left - high velocity, vertical tests lower right - high velocity, horizontal tests ^Refer to footnote on page 3579</page><page sequence="8">THORACIC IMPACT 3583 Fig. 5 - Typical oscillographic recording for 1 Hf Study erometer mount attachment. Considering that • there was typically no skeletal damage in the łHf Study (except for high velocity, postmortem subjects), the latter explanation seems most plausible. Film analysis reveals that the kinematics of the spinal accelerometer mounting bracket did vary significantly for similar impact exposures, indicating variability in vertebral column articulation during impact. Aortic overpressure was substantially higher for the fHf Study anesthetized animals at both velocity levels, whereas there was little difference between postmortem responses in the two studies. The anesthetized animal comparison is particularly interesting in that the higher overpressure in the łHł Study was associated with lower thoracic compression, both on an absolute and normalized basis. The fVł Study animals typically became hypotensive when suspended vertically, and this pretest condition may partially explain the differences in aortic overpressures . Anesthetized and postmortem comparisons of the quadrupedal posture experiments generally indicated a lack of difference in mechanical responses (Table 6). In fact, the only major difference exhibited between the two prepara- tions was a higher aortic overpressure in the postmortem subjects. This was consistent with previous comparative analyses and is believed to be due to the unnatural characteristics of the repressurized thoracic vascular system (9) . However, the difference in overpressure between the anesthetized and postmortem horizontally oriented animals is substantially less than that observed for the vertically oriented subjects. INJURY AND ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC RESPONSE - In contrast to the mechanical response compari- sons, injury profiles and electrocardiographic changes for the łVł and łHf Studies were marked- ly different. Necropsy revealed that every animal tested in the vertical position experienced skeletal damage (including several cases of flail chest) , whereas those tested in the horizontal posture experienced only minor musculoskeletal damage (Tables 7a and 7b) . The anesthetized low velocity animals of the fHł Study experienced no rib fractures, compared to an average of four for each upright oriented subject. However, all of the horizon- tal but none of the vertical animals experienced severe pulmonary hemorrhage. Similarly the postmortem low velocity tests resulted in only a possible sternal fracture in the łHł Study and an average of four rib frac- tures in the fVł Study. The only visceral injury found was a contused pericardium in an upright animal. For the anesthetized high velocity horizon- tal animals there was again only one possible fracture in striking contrast to an average of nine in the łVł Study. Also, in contrast, horizontally oriented animals sustained extensive pulmonary hemorrhage resulting in two cases in a right hemothorax. The vertical animals experi- enced only one case of pulmonary hemorrhage, but there were two cases of liver laceration. An isolated case of cardiac contusion was reported in both experimental programs. Postmortem high velocity tests in the fHł Study resulted in moderate skeletal damage, although the average of four fractures per subject was significantly less than the average of thirteen for the fVł Study. The right atrium was ruptured in isolated cases in both studies, two in the łVf Study and one in the łHł Study. In making comparisons it should be remem- bered that except for the low velocity, postmor- tem tests the thoracic compression was lower in the łHł Study than the ?Vł Study. However, lower thoracic compression (probably due to impactor air-braking) does not appear to be a complete explanation for the low frequency of rib frac- tures in horizontally oriented subjects.

Also, the same compression levels were developed in both low velocity postmortem groups, resulting in moderate damage to the fVf Study animals but only a questionable sternal fracture for the łHf Study subjects. Differences in electrocardiographic response were particularly pronounced (Table 8) . ECG changes occurred in 24 of the 25 animals tested (both studies). However, those in the fHf Study were typically transient and of minor severity in all but one case. Right axis shift and sinus rhythm changes were the most frequently observed alterations in animals subjected to impact while in the horizontal posture. In comparison, upright oriented animals exhibited severe arrhythmias with lethal ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurring in three of eight animals. Each of the cases of VF involved a high velocity exposure with a correspondingly high sternal acceleration (greater than 700 gfs), resulting in a strong correlation between the occurrence of VF and peak sternal acceleration (9,17). However, all high velocity tests with horizontal- ly postured animals resulted in sternal accelera- tions greater than 700 gTs (in one case &gt;1300 głs) without a single case of ventricular fibrillation. In summary, the horizontal animals were less susceptible to skeletal damage and cardiac arrhythmias but more prone to pulmonary hemor- rhaging. Although an explanation for these differences is not immediately apparent, it is conceivable that the distribution of body sup- porting forces and gravitational effects upon the viscera influence impact responses. It is also possible that the animals tested in the upright posture were physiologically compromised and therefore more vulnerable to physical insult . Comparison of anesthetized and postmortem injury responses in the fHT Study indicates a higher susceptibility to skeletal damage (Table 7b) in the postmortem condition. Only one possible fracture occurred at the lower velocity level. However, at the higher velocity the postmortem subjects experienced an average of four fractures each versus none for the anesthe- tized animals. Comparison of visceral damage is difficult because the postmortem subjects did not show signs of contusion. However, it does appear that the right atrium is a potential site for injury in both cases. An isolated case of trauma to the right atrium was found in both test conditions: a contusion in an anesthetized subject and a rupture in a postmortem subject. SUMMARY A preliminary comparison of blunt thoracic impact response of swine tested in a natural (quadrupedal) posture versus an unnatural (up- right) posture has indicated the following: TABLE 8 Cardiac Arrhythmias Low Velocity Test ID Study V Test ID Study H 17/L5 - not analyzed 1/L33/PE - sinus tachycardia - ST depression 18/L4 * - no conductive - right axis shift changes post- Impact 2/L34/PE - sinus tachycardia 19/L4" - multifocal PVC' s - ST change - 2° AV dissociation - bigeminy diminishing to - right axis shift Nobitz II with 2/1 AV block 16/L4 - complete AV block - dissociation - atrium and ventricle firing on their own at less then 20 bpm High Velocity 10/L1 - Idioventricular or 3/L35/PE - atrial fibrillation 1diojunct1onal rate - AV block - ventricular fibrillation - runs of ventricular tachycardia 12/L2 - ventricular tachycardia possible ventricular 4/L36/PE - transient right fibrillation axis shift 15/L3 - 1 dio junctional rhythm 5/L37/PE - sinus bradycardia loss of sinus activity - ST elevation - bi phasic T wave 20/L3 1 - ventricular fibrillation 6/L38/PE - sinus tachycardia - ST segment depression - right axis shift - supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with aberrant conduction</page><page sequence="11">3586 M.

Applied force and thoracic accelera- tions were generally higher for the quadrupedal- ly oriented animals than for those positioned upright, but the differences varied considerably among the four separate comparisons made (anes- thetized and postmortem subjects at 8 and 10 m/s impact velocity) . 2. Aortic overpressure was substantially higher in the horizontal, anesthetized subjects than in the comparable vertical animals. However the posture did not affect aortic over- pressure in the postmortem subjects. 3. The anesthetized quadrupedal animals experienced minor transient arrhythmias and extensive pulmonary hemorrhage in the absence of skeletal damage, whereas the anesthetized verti- cal animals experienced extensive rib fractures and serious arrhythmias, including lethal ventricular fibrillation. 4. The postmortem horizontal animals sustained significantly less skeletal damage than did the upright subjects. In this comparative study the response of swine to thoracic impact appears to have been significantly affected by pretest body posture and support. Those animals suspended in an unnatural posture may have been anatomically stressed and physiologically compromised to the extent that they were predisposed to certain injury responses. In this regard, the distribu- tion of external body supporting forces on the animal's musculoskeletal system, gravitational influences on the viscera and congestion in dependent body areas are some of the possible contributing factors. Other variables and differences in experimental protocol between the two studies may also have influenced the results. Thus, the specific findings presented should be viewed as preliminary and approximate. They do, however, testify to the need for great care in the design and validation of experimental method- ologies involving animal models. REFERENCES (1) P. G. Windquist, P. W. Stumm and R.
