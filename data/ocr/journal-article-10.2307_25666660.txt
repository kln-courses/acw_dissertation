<plain_text><page sequence="1">A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN ENGRAVED ARTIFACTS FROM THE UTZ ONEOTA SITE by Phil P. Betancourt ABSTRACT Engraved objects of various types have been found at the Utz Oneota Site in Saline County, Missouri. A number of these artifacts are described and illustrated in this article, with comparative data from other localities. They indicate a line of cultural contact and/or trade run ning northwest and southeast, along the Missouri-Mississippi River System. Introduction Engraved artifacts of several types have been known for some time from the Utz Site, 23SA2, a large Oneota village in north-central Missouri. "A Prelim inary Survey of Missouri Archaeology" by Carl Chapman (1946, p. 30-31) listed one inscribed catlinite tablet from this village site, and another was reported in Archeology of the Eastern United States (Chapman, 1952, Fig. 65). Southern Cult motifs, which occur engraved on tablets and other artifacts, have been described in detail by Robert T. Bray in The Mis souri Archaeologist (1963, pp. 1-40). The purpose of this presentation is to describe certain other previously unpub lished engraved artifacts from this site, and to offer comparative data where possible. The Utz Site is in Saline County, Missouri, less than two miles south of the pre sent channel of the Mi s souri Rive r. It is on a series of grassy loess hills, and was named after one landowner, William Utz. This village site was identified with the historic Missouri Tribe (Berry, Chap man, and Mack, 1942). Its occupation began before 1673, as at this time it was mentioned by Marquette and Joliet, and lasted possibly into the eighteenth cen tury. The dates of occupation have been given as 1673-1728. The latter date coincides with the abandoning of Fort Orleans, a French fort located approxi mately two mile s north of the Oneota Site, across the Missouri River. The aban doning of this fort after only five years of existence may have been a stimulus for the Indians to move their village (Bray, 1961, pp. 217-218). The relative paucity of trade goods at the Utz Site indicates that it could not have been occupied much past 1728. After this date, items of European manufacture such as iron axes, brass and copper kettles, and firearms became more available to the Indians of this area. With the exception of copper and brass, these items are almost com pletely absent from the Utz Site (Bray, 1961, p. 217). Most objects found provide good evi dence of the hunting-agriculture economy of the Oneota in Missouri. Surface col lecting has been done at the site for some years. The University of Missouri, through its Research Center located at the site, is currently excavating to dis cover new information. 256</page><page sequence="2">Post molds show the dwellings to have been elliptical in shape, and as large as twenty by fifty feet. Refuse pits are typically bell shaped with flat or gently rounded bottoms and were probably used for storage before being converted to depositories for refuse. Fireplaces are found both inside and outside the houses. Burials occur both in cemeteries and at random in the village area. Implements of antler and bone include needles, awls, flaking tools, knife han dles and bison scapula hoes. Beads and other ornaments were also fashioned from bone. Chipped stone end scrapers, knives, and small triangular projectile points are typical as are chipped, center notched axes. Other flaked or chipped artifacts include drills, side scrapers, gravers, and various miscellaneous implements. The materials from which these have been manufactured is chert, which occurs in a wide range of colors with white and gray predominant. Ground stone objects include celts of granite and other igneous rock, sandstone abrading stones, and grooved arrow shaft smoothers. Manos, metates, mortars, and pestles give evidence of corn grind ing, although some were used in the preparation of hematite for paint (Chap man, 1946, p. 30). Pieces of hematite which have been rubbed to obtain paint are relatively common, and some imple ments are found which have been made from this material. Other artifacts include pipes of catlinite, limestone or clay stone. Both elbow and disk type pipes are found, usually of good workmanship. Pendants and other ornaments are found which have been fashioned from catlinite. Shell or naments and mussel shell spoons occur on the site. Pottery at the Utz Site is predomi nantly shell tempered, tan to brown or grey. Rarely, it is painted with red Ocher. The typical vessel is globular in form with recurved rim, strap handles, and a rounded bottom. De signs are trailed or incised and may include punctations. Sizes vary from about one quart size to vessels which would hold several gallons. When compared to Oneota material from Iowa, which appears to be the center of this culture, the pottery contains a mix ture of several Iowa Oneota ceramic traits. Material similar to both Correc tionville and Allamakee Trailed is pres ent on the Utz Site with great variations in decoration, height of vessel rim, handle form, and method of handle attachment (Henning, 1962). A major portion of this paper was prepared as a special research problem in conjunction with a course in advanced archaeology at the Eighteenth Field Ses sion in Midwestern Archaeology of the University of Missouri, in 1964. Addi tional information has been incorporated into the article since that time. Most artifacts described are from the collection of the University of Missouri Lyman Center for Archaeological Research, at the Utz Site. The writer is also indebted to the following people and organizations for allowing him to de scribe material from their collections: Wayne Kitchen and Clifford McGonigal, of Blackburn, Missouri; John Bradshaw, of Marshall, Missouri; Duff Schult, of Caruthersville, Missouri; the Nebraska State Historical Society, Lincoln, Nebraska; Leo Anderson, of Van Buren, Missouri; John Moselage, of Memphis, Tennessee; Frank Magre, of Crystal City, Missouri; and Ralph J. Duerr, of Clinton, Missouri. The drawings for the Bison Horns Tablet, Plume Design Tablet, Millard Thunderbird, Thunderbird Tab let No. 2, Irvine Pipe Disk, and the Week Stone were drawnfrom epoxy resin casts, made from the originals by Mr. Allen Eichenberger, of Hannibal, Missouri. The balance were drawnfrom the actual artifacts, unless noted other wise in the captions. Special thanks are also due to Mr. Robert T. Bray and Mr. Richard A. Marshall of the staff of the University of Missouri, for advice 257</page><page sequence="3">and assistance in the preparation of this article. The writer also appreciates the work of typing and proofing done by Mary A. Betancourt. Engraved Artifacts Bison Horns Tablet This is a hematite tablet, engraved on both sides. It is dark reddish-brown in color and has been smoothed by rubbing prior to the application of the designs. It is 5.0 cm. long, 4.0 cm. wide, and 1.3 cm. thick. Pieces of similar hematite are often found on the Utz Site. They are usually not engraved, but do show evidence of having been rubbed to remove paint. Some chipped artifacts made from this type of hematite are in the collection of the Lyman Center for Archaeological Re - search at the Utz Site. These are poorly made, as the material flakes very roughly. Ground hematite artifacts are also found in the Re search Center's col lection. One side of the tablet has a design which may represent a pair of bison horns (Figure la) For descriptive purposes this has been designated the obverse. The horns curve up from the head of the animal and almost touch, vir tually forming a complete circle. The head contains a diamond design. Another diamond, with a vertical line inside, touches the top of the bison's head and may represent the ears. Bison designs have been reported from other sites which fit well with the art complex of the Utz Site. TheBastian Site, 13CKZ8, an Oneota site near Chero kee, Iowa, has produced at least two catlinite tablets with engraved bisons (Bray, 1963, Fig. 12, 21). The Lyman Research Center at the Utz Site has a cast of a pendant in the shape of a human face in its collection. It is from north west Iowa. On the reverse of this catlinite pendant is an engraved picture of a bison in profile. In addition to the above sites with an Oneota culture, bison motifs occur from sites along the Missouri River and its tributaries from Illinois to the Dakotas. The Anker Site, a Mississippian site in Illinois, has produced a stemless lime stone celt shaped pipe with this animal engraved on one side (Jensen, 1963). Incised catlinite tablets with various ani mal designs including the bison have been reported from the northeastern edge of the Great Plains. This area, east and north of the Missouri River, comprises the land drained by the James, Vermil lion, Big Sioux, Sheyenne, and Red River sy stem s. It ha s a ma r ginal plain s cultur e with some archaeological remains which resemble those from Minnesota and northern Iowa (Wedel, 1961, pp. 210 239). The Sully Site, in South Dakota, is the largest single earth lodge village site along the Missouri. It had a farming economy, and was occupied from the 1600's to approximately 1750. Its pop ulation had some cultural ties with more eastern peoples. A catlinite tablet from this site contains an engraved bison with a similar style to the other plaques dis cussed here (Caldwell and Smith, 1963, p. 31). The bison motif carries through into historic times, and is found on a Winne bago War Club dating from before 1839. The club is fashioned from antler and is well made. Lined triangles decorate the borders and it contains engravings of mythical animals in addition to the bisons (Eyman, 1963). A tablet with several engraved de signs *See the description of the "Engraved Bone" for a different possible interpretation of this tablet. 258</page><page sequence="4">including a bison was foundin 1889 at the confluence of the Meramec and Mississip pi Rivers in the extreme southeast corner of St. Louis County, Missouri. This stone has been called the Week Stone after the finder, C. E. Week. It is 7.3 cm. long by 4. 8 cm. wide, by 0. 7 cm. thick, and is made of chert (Figure 4a, b). The edges and both side shave been smoothed. Other artifacts found by Mr. Week at the same site included notched and multiple notched arrow points and stone hoes. (Frank Magre, personal communication.) Incised de signs occur on both side s of the Week Stone. For descriptive purposes, the side with the bison has been desig nated the obverse (Figure 4a). The bison is drawn in profile, with indications of hair. A triangle (an arrow or spear point ?) is shown on the animal's body. A humanfigure, a bird, and other designs are also engraved on this side of the tablet. Three hands form the principal part of the design on the tablet's reverse (Figure 4b). They have been drawn care - fully, with some indication of fingernails, and with attention to the relative length of fingers. A spiral design is on the wrist of the center hand. A face is shown in profile at the edge of the stone. The relationship between the Week Stone and the Utz material is not so much in the designs on the tablet as in the plaque itself. The motif s are more allied with the Mississippian cultures of the southeastern United States. For example, human hands are found at several sites in the southeast, associated with the "Southern Cult" (Fundaburk, 1957, plate 17). The profile face on the reverse of the stone has several points which are similar to faces delineated on artifacts found on Mississippian sites. An em bossed copperplate from Spiro, Oklaho ma, can serve to illustrate these similarities (Hamilton, 1952, plate 71)? Both the Spiro face and the one on the Week Stone are in profile, with rounded noses. They have similar eyes, identical facial decorations, and mouths are open with the lower lip larger than the upper. The similarity of the Week Stone to material from the Utz Oneota Site lies in the fact that it is an irregular stone which has been carefully smoothed, and has then had designs scratched into its sur face. Like similar tablets from the Utz Site, it has many striations which are unrelated to the designs. Some of the drawings are superimposed over parts of others, another characteristic of many tablets from the Oneota Site. The reverse of the Bison Horns Tablet (Figure lb) shows a de sign which is more stylized and abstract. A long, thin tri angle extends upward into a circular figure. This circle is divided by two vertical lines which extend past its top and become an ellipse. Inside this ellipse is a diamond. Within the circle, in the center of the tablet and on either side of the two verti cal lines, are two forked eye designs. The forks which are toward the center of the circle are longer than the others, and bent at the tip. The outside forks are much shorter. The forked eye design is a common motif among the Middle Mis sissippian cultures of the southeastern United States, and occurs with many variations either with two or three forks (Hamilton, 1952, p. 58). An engraved shell and a shell gorget from Spiro, Okla homa, have eye-de signs very similar to the ones shown here, in that they have one short "squared off" fork and one longer fork that iswavey. The shell gor get contains five faces, each with forked eye designs. On the engraved shell the eyes do not appear on a face, but form a repeat design (Burnett, 1954, plates LV, LVI, and LIX). Forked eyes appear on several other items from the Utz Site. Engraved draw ings of birds on both the obverse and the reverse of the Utz Inscribed Tablet, a catlinite plaque, bear this motif. The same tablet also contains forked eyes in conjunction with a complicated design consisting of a circle above a wide MM" with the eyes and a crescent underneath. An identical design is found on the Mil 259</page><page sequence="5">lard Tablet from the same site, A small modified elbow pipe of catlinite which bears an incised anthropomorphic mask design contains incompletely made forked eyes. Two pottery sherds with forked eye designs are known, and a catlinite pendant in this shape was found imme diately north of this site (Bray, 1963, pp. 3-15). Plume Design Tablet A hematite tablet, roughly triangular in shape, and 6. 7 cm. x 6. 5 cm. x 1. 5 cm. in size, bears a plume or mace de sign (Figure 2c, d). The dark reddish brown hematite has been partially smoothed. Numerous lines, caused by rubbing, remain on both sides of the tab let. They seem to have been applied in removing hematite for paint, and were applied after the smoothing, but before the engraving of the design. The side at the left of Figure 2c is broken and un smoothed. The side with the plume or mace design has been designated the ob verse of the tablet. The principal engraving on this side forms a three pointed design, repeated upside down by a continuous line. It is reminiscent of some of the chipped stone maces from Southern Cult centers such as that at Spiro, Oklahoma (Hamilton, 1952, plates 34-43). The three pointed mace occurs as a motif on various artifacts from sites throughout the southea stern United State s, including Spiro, Etowah, Georgia, and Moundville, Alabama (Fundaburk and Foreman, 1957, plate 19). A very simi lar design occurs on incised pottery from Cahokia, Illinois (Dick, 1955, p. 48). A pointed design occurs on a pottery sherd from the Murphy Mound, a Missis sippian Site in Pemiscot County, Missouri. It bears a slight similarity to the plume or mace design. The sherd is in the collection of Mr. Duff Schult of Caruthersville, Missouri, and illustrated in Figure 31 for comparative purposes. The pottery has a Bell Plain paste, is dark mouse grey in color, and may be a portion of a narrow mouthed water bottle. A water bottle or jar from the Camp bell Site is decorated with a plume design which ties in more closely with the mate rial under consideration here. The Campbell Site is a late Mississippian Site which is also in Pemiscot County, Mis souri. One burial with glass beads and trade iron in association has been re ported from this site (Richard A. Mar shall, personal communication). The jar or bottle is in the collection of Mr. Leo O. Anderson of Van Buren, Missouri. The motif is illustrated in Figure 3m. Three pictures are found on the neck of the vessel, the pointed design and two stylized birds. Both three pointed and two pointed plumes are included in the decoration. The two birds can be com pared with previously published material from the Utz and other Oneota sites. This furnishes a further correlation be tween the Campbell vessel and motifs from the Oneota. The bird at the left of Figure 3m has a striking similarity in overall appear ance with the bird on the obverse of the New Albin Tablet, an engraved tablet from the New Albin Site, an Oneota site, in northeast Iowa (Bray, 1963, Figure 23). The wings are similarly drawn. Both heads are at the same angle, with open beak. The upper portion of the beaks is longer than the bottom, and is pointed. The Utz Site has produced several bird designs with elements which appear also in those from the Campbell Site. Three and four part crests appear on the heads of birds from the Utz Site. These are in the same relative position as the two part crest on the head of the center bird in the Campbell design. The shape of the head and beak on the bird from the Irvine Tab let, a hematite plaque which was found on the Utz Site in 1956, is similar to the New Albin Tablet and the bird on the left in the illustration from the water bottle. Cross hatching occurs on both Campbell Site birds, and is found on several tab lets from the Utz Site including the Irvine Tablet, where it occurs on the bird's feathers (Bray, 1963). The reverse of the Plume Design 260</page><page sequence="6">Tablet has had a large piece broken off, which removed a large portion of the de signs from this side, and those that remain are not readily recognizable. Large numbers of scratches appear on this side, as they do on the obverse. These appear to be completely unrelated to the design. Some were applied after the completion of the engraving. The Millard Thunderbird A hematite tablet, named after the finder, bears an incised bird on its front (Figure lc). The material is similar to that of the Bison Horns Tablet and the Plume De sign Tablet. The front and side s have been smoothed, but the back is un worked and rough. It is 4.4 cm. along the longest axis, and 1.2 cm. thick. The drawing is crude when compared with some others from this locale. The body is triangular, with single lines to repre sent three tail feathers and the wings. A bent line forms the head. What may be a fletched arrow is shown protruding from the bird's side, at the right of the tablet. Plaques depicting animals pierced by projectiles are known from this and re lated sites. A hematite tablet showing an animal (possibly representing a deer), which has been wounded by an arrow or lance, was found on the Utz Site a num ber of years ago (Bray, 1963, pp. 8-12). A number of tablets from the Bastian Site, an Oneota site near Cherokee, Iowa, bear similarly wounded animals (Bray, 1963, pp. 17-32). An engraved tablet from the collec tion of Ralph J. Duerr of Clinton, Missouri, is illustrated in Figure li. It was found in 1933 on Indian Creek, two miles north of Higginsville, Lafayette County, Missouri. The stone is about seven inches long by four inches high, between one and two inches thick, and is smooth on one side. The incised figures are on the rough side of the stone. A figure of an animal, apparently a deer, is shown with a fletched arrow on its side (Ralph J. Duerr, personal communica tion). The small beaver-like animal at the center of the tablet is similar to an example inscribed on one of the Bastian Site tablets. (Bray, 1963, Figure 13a). Thunderbird Tablet No. 2 A second hematite tablet with a bird motif is illustrated in Figure Id, e. This tablet is 4. 3 cm. long by 3. 4 cm. wide, and 1.0 cm. thick. It has been smoothed somewhat on both sides and around the edges. Only the obverse bears a recog nizable design, that of a bird. On the reverse are several scratches. The bird is the type that has been calleda "thunderbird", with outstretched wings and tail, and with the head and beak in profile. Similar designs have been observed as petroglyphs from the site 23MN1, in Monroe County, Missouri (Eichenberger, 1944, pp. 45-64). A small-mouthed water bottle from the Parkin Site contains a complicated set of decorations including a simplified bird design which is somewhat similar to the ones described here (John Moselage, personal communication). The Parkin Site is a Mississippian village site of the St. Francis type, in Cross County, Arkansas (Phillips, Ford and Griffin, 1951, p. 47). The two bird designs discussed here appear rather dissimilar to the more elaborate bird designs from Spiro, Moundville, Etowah, and other middle Mississippian Centers. They are also dissimilar to previously published bird designs from the Utz Site. Their closest affiliation seems to be with a more west ern source. A catlinite pipe from Rice County, Kansas, bears an incised design on its side which is very similar to the one on the Thunderbird Tablet No. 2 (Wedel, W., 1959, plate 45). The Bradshaw Pipe A broken catlinite pipe of the elbow type in the collection of John Bradshaw of Marshall, Missouri bears engraved lines on the front and both sides (Figure lg, h).. On the front are two vertical lines which converge at the bottom of the 261</page><page sequence="7">bowl, with a deep, wide line bisecting them. On the sides is a portion of what may be a pointed design similar to that on the Plume Design Tablet. Both sides of the pipe appear to have had identical designs, but because of the missing por tions it is impossible to state with certainty their complete delineations. It should be notedthat there is a similarity between this design and the tail of the bird on the Thunderbird Tablet No. 2, and that similar design occurs on a pipe from Rice County, Kansas (Wedel, W. , 1959, plate 45). Irvine Pipe Disk A reworked disk from a catlinite pipe is illustrated in Figure If. It was found on the surface of the Utz Site by Sam Irvine, of Marshall, Missouri. The ma terial is light brown catlinite, probably from the quarries in southwestern Minnesota. Disk pipes, constructed of either catlinite or limestone, are common from the Utz Site. The design on the obverse of the disk shows an animal, probably representing a turtle. The reverse (not shown) is un decorated. The animal has an oval body with a diamond shaped head, and a spiked tail. It has three pairs of legs. Aseries of triangular spikes, such as the ones on the tail, surround the turtle, emanating from it. What may be ears protrude from the head. Very similar designs occur from the Oahe Reservoir area of North and South Dakota. A turtle design from this area on the upper Missouri River is known which has a bent, spiked tail and spikes around its body. These portions of the Dakota animal are identical to the illus trated pipe disk. Its head is also simi larly shaped, but without the "ears". A multi-legged turtle whose legs are bent lines like those on the Irving Pipe Disk occurs with the spiked creature (Caldwell and Smith, 1963, p. 6). Engraved Bone An engraved bone, apparently a portion of a human femur, has an interesting motif. It was found on the surface of a field near the Utz Site by Wayne Kitchen, of Blackburn, Missouri. It is 19.5 cm. long and broken at both ends (Figure 2a). There are several scuff marks on the bone (probably plow marks) which have obliterated portions of the design. The engraving completely encircles the bone. The style is similar to that on the other objects from the Utz Site, with some lines deeply incised and others barely scratching the surface. Figure 2b shows the complete design from the arti fact. The focal point of the design is the anthropomorphic figure. It is 2. 5 cm. high. Curved lines form a hooklike de sign on either side of the figure, and extend to the opposite side of the bone. A circle and other lines complete the design. There is a distinct similarity in this design and the obverse of the Bison Horns Tablet when the latter is held "upside down". The possibility of a rela tionship should not be ignored. In this posture the "bison horns" become analogous with the hooklike designs on both sides of the anthropomorphic figure. The lines below the hooklike design also have their counterparts on the other tablet. Bison Scapula Hoe Hoes made from bison scapulas are common at the Utz Site. The one illus trated in Figure 2e is noteworthy because of the engraved design on one side. It was found in the excavation of a refuse pit, in I960. The scapula is 31 cm. long and 15 cm. wide. It shows some evidence of use. The incised lines form a Crosshatch design, crossing obliquely. Some of the parallel line s converge at one side of the implement at various points. The lines are relatively light, and not deeply im pressed into the bone. 262</page><page sequence="8">Miscellaneous Pieces A circular piece of hematite (Figure 3a) is 3.4 cm, in diameter. It is from the collection of Clifford McGonigal, of Blackburn, Missouri. The edges have been smoothed by rubbing. On one sur face, striations are in three groups which cross each other. It is doubtful if the lines were applied with any specific de sign in mind, and are probably a result of removing hematite for paint. A portion of a hematite tablet is shown in Figure 3b. The tablet ha s been broken at one side (upper right of drawing). The remaining portion is 3. 5 cm. by 4. 3 cm., and 0.6 cm. thick. Portions of the de sign have been obliterated by numerous stria tions so that the motif is not apparent. Neither the sides nor the front or back have been smoothed. A fragment of a tablet found in 1959 (Figure 3c) is of compact and homoge nous limestone with a greyish brown color. Incised lines on the tablet have been applied in a manner similar to those on the other plaques, but only a small piece of the original tablet is present. It is 3.9 cm. x 5. 4 cm. x 1.2 cm., and is not large enough to reconstruct the original design. The top and original edges of the tablet are polished, but the back (not shown) is rough. A broken disk pipe (Figure 3d) is made from limestone. The material is dark grey and compact. Some of the striations on the top surface may have formed a recognizable picture, although most appear to be merely random stria tions. The pipe is too incomplete for the determination of any design. A potsherd with incised line s is shown in Figure 3e. The pottery is shell tem pered, has a smooth texture, and a hard ness of 2.0. The color is light tan, and the thickness of the sherd varies from 0.7 cm. to 1.3 cm. The incised lines were apparently scratched into the sur face after the pottery was fired. A typical piece of hematite paintstone is shown in Figure 3f. The incised line s on the piece are the result of removing pigment for paint. The edges have been smoothed. Large numbers of paint stone s, such as this one, have been found at the Utz Site. Chert flakes, reworked along one edge, seem to be one method of re moving the pigment from the parent stone. This would produce the scratched surface common to much of the paint stone found on the site. Flakes have been found in the refuse pits on the site, still stained red from such use. A fragment of rough catlinite wa s found at the Utz Site in 1964. The stone is un worked except for a rubbed line 4 mm. wide across one corner of the reverse (not shown) and for the incised lines on the obverse (Figure 3g). Four short lines cross, roughly forming a square. Other flakes and minor scratches are also found on the artifact. A decoratedpotsherd is illustrated in Figure 3h. The incised lines on this sherd are not typical of pottery decora tion at the Utz Site. Contrary to this example, designs were trailed or incised in the pottery before the ware was fired. The piece is shell tempered with a paste similar to other pottery from the Utz Site. Its color is light brown and it varies in thickness from 0. 5 cm. to 0. 8 cm. One edge of the sherd, the left of the illus tration, has been sawed. The design may not be complete. It shows a cross inside an irregularly shaped area with a line extending outside the area and toward the sawed edge. The hematite piece illustrated in Figure 3i is similar in material and workmanship to the others of this type from the Utz Site. It is not complete, but the left edge of the stone has been smoothed and appears to be one of the original edges of the tablet. The reverse (not shown) contains numerous scratches and striations. Figure 3j shows another smoothed hematite fragment. The lines on the stone have been purposefully applied, but 263</page><page sequence="9">do not forma recognizable design. Some of the lines appear more curvilinear than those on most of the tablets. This is due to irregularities in the surface of the stone, rather than to style. The tablets from the Utz Site exhibit a style which uses straight lines to a much greater extent than curves. When curved lines occur, they are usually broad and sweep ing. Some small curves and circles do appear, but they are in a distinct minority in comparison with the total number of lines on the tablets. A small chip of hematite is illustrated in Figure 3k. The de sign may be complete rather than a portion of a larger one, as only two lines actually extend off the edge of the stone. Cross hatching such as this has been noted on other plaques from the Utz Site, as mentioned in conjunction with the Plume Design Tablet. COMPARISON AND CONCLUSIONS The generic term "engravedartifacts" includes items from several categories. The designs on some objects are undoubtedly purely decorative. The pipe s and possibly some of the tablets and the scapula hoe would be included here. Other designs could be classified as "doodles". Still others may have had a mystical or religious significance. The engraved designs give evidence of contact in two directions by the people of the Utz Site. The line s of cultural contact run generally northwest and southeast, along the area drained by the Missouri Mississippi River System. There is practically no evidence of a northeastern or southwestern affiliation. Contacts between the Utz Oneota and the Middle Mississippian cultures of the southeastern United States have been demonstrated before. The so-called "Southern Cult" is one manifestation of certain Middle Mississippian centers, and similarities between Cult motifs and engraved designs from the Utz Site have been described in detail. Some of the designs occurring in both cultures include the forked eye, speech symbols, concen tric circles, woodpecker and eagle (Bray, 1963). Items described in this paper which have a definite southeastern affilia tion include the forked eye and the plume or mace design. The engraved catlinite tablets have been noted from a large area in the upper midwest (see Figure 5) and they have been listed as a characteristic of the Oneota in this area. Oneota sites from which they have been reported include the New Albin Site at the mouth of the Upper Iowa River, the Blood Run Site in Lyon County, Iowa, and the Leary and Stanton Sites in Nebraska (Wedel, M. , 1959, p. 57). The Nebra ska State Hi storical Society ha s a catlinite tablet in its collection which was collected from the Oto in southeast ern Nebraska about 1869-1872 (Bray, 1963, pp. 36-37).* An engraved tablet has been reported from the Devil's Lake District in North Dakota (Wedel, 1961, p. 223). Two engraved stones were found some years ago on the Victor Hartell farm, thirty miles north of Kansas City, Mis souri, in Clay County. The location is seven miles northwest of Kearney, in the Artey Community, eight-tenths of a mile east of the Artey Methodist Church. The Hartell Stone No. 1 (Figure 4c, d) was foundin 1935 or 1936 by Harold K. Hartell. The second Hartell Stone (Figure 4e) was found in 1943 or 1944 by Victor Hartell. The top of the stone has been broken. Both are described as made from an orange colored, smooth stone, probably catlinite (Frank Magre, personal commu nication). The Utz Site has produced tablets made from both catlinite and hematite. These *A communication from Roger T. Grange, 1964, indicated that the word "north eastern" in Bray's report should have been "southeastern". Apparently the former was a typographical error (Ltr. Kivett to Bray, 1963). 264</page><page sequence="10">are not dis similar except for the material and the fact that the hematite ones tend to be smalle r. It i s po s sible that the relative abundance of hematite led to its substitu tion for catlinite in the manufacture of some of the plaques. It ha^been said that these plaques Were tobacco cutting boards, and this seems a logical explanation for their use. Numerous scratches and striations appear on all tablets from the Utz Site. Usually it is impossible to ascertain if these were applied before or after the en graved de signs. In a few cases, however, they were obviously applied after the design, as they partially obliterate por tions of it. There is at least one known instance of a tablet and tobacco leaves in associa tion. The examination of a Crow medicine bag from historic times revealed both tobacco and a circular catlinite tablet with raised border. The tablet was unengraved. Other objects in the medi cine bag includedtwo whistles, a cup and pin game, hematite paint, and a leather covered rattle with horsehair tassel (Robert T. Bray, personal communica tion). These plaques might also be interpreted as hunting fetishes. Arrows on the plaques, such as the one project ing from the side of the bird on the Millard Thunderbird Tablet, could indicate a desire by a hunter to slay the animal. The numerous scratches on the tablets could have an identical meaning. Besides the above mentioned affiliation with southeastern motifs, certain of the Utz designs have their counterparts from sites to the west of the Oneota. Much of the exchange of ideas between these people and their we ste rn neighbor s seem s to have been up the Missouri River Basin, but it was not confined to this route. The "thunderbird" occurs in Rice County, Kansas, as well as at the Utz Site. The major correlation, however, is up and down the river basin. The inci dence of catlinite tablets in this direction has been noted. (See map,, Figure 5). Bison motifs are prevalent throughout the area. Turtle de signs with characteristics comparable to those from Saline County are found as far upstream as the Oahe Re servoir area in North and South Dakota. The designs from the Utz Site are extremely varied. They range from simple doodles to complicated and styl ized representations of animals and ideas. The engraved materials include catlinite, hematite, limestone, pottery, and bone. Similaritie s in the de signs and the materials engraved are found between the Utz and other Oneota cultures. Similarities also exist with the Middle Mississippian cultures of the Southeast and with various sites up the Missouri and Mississippi River Basins. 265</page><page sequence="11">d e f Figure 1: a, b.
