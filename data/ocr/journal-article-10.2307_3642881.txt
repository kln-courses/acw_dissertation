<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY AIZANOI, 1984.' The excavations at Aizanoi took place from 23 July to 28 September 1984, and were carried out in four places: (a) On the Meydan Kran, Room C of the great ashlar building, a hall measuring 11 x 16 m., was exposed. In it too numerous hypocausts are preserved and on the south side are two praefurnia. In the third phase of the building, in Byzantine times, this room was evidently used as an assembly hall beside the church erected in Room B in the 6th century. Indications are two bronze crosses, one with the inscription ANACTACIOY AATIA, the other with chains on the upper and lower arms. (b) The clearance of the outer wall of the courtyard porticoes of the temple of Zeus was continued by Claudia Naumann and it was established that the conversion of the temple area into a fortification with semicircular and rectangular towers took place already in Late Byzantine times, evidently as a defence against the Tartar invasion. After the conquest a Tartar tribe of the Qavdars settled in the fortress and so it acquired the name Qavdarhisar. (c) At the southeast corner of the Dorian pillared portico Frederike Nau- mann investigated a gatehouse with two passageways, for vehicles and for pedestrians, and beside it another building approached by steps between bases on which, according to the architectural remains, stood a two-storeyed structure with aedicula. Since this building lies under the village street it was partly inaccessible and its function could not be ascertained. (d) The excavations by the Stadium were continued by Adolf Hoffmann. The whole of the west side was investigated and it was found that the building had been hastily erected and did not show any unified concept. On the clearance of the northern end of the Stadium behind the stage building of the theatre many parts of the multi-storeyed superstructure were found, making possible a reconstruction. ANTALYA REGION (SURVEY), 1984.2 From August 22 to September 22 a surface survey was carried out in the Antalya region under the auspices of the French Ministry of Foreign Relations and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. This work was done within the context of French-Turkish collaboration, the staff members being Doq. Dr. I. Kayan (geologist), Dr. A. Minzoni-Deroche (prehistorian), M. H. Tagkiran (government representative) and Dog. Dr. I. Yalginkaya (prehistorian). The aims of this survey were (a) to localize new paleolithic sites-mostly caves-in the Antalya region where the site of Karain was already known and (b) to give a geomorphological and ecological context to the sites. The caves which had been previously indicated with no details were exactly localized and material was collected; other new sites were also discovered and lithic material is under study. Some of the most important caves-besides Karain-were ?arkini, Okiizini, Mustanini, Klzil in, and Direkli. Open air sites like Gdk hdyiik and Tag h6yiik were located. Other sites like Karain and Ayvasil, near Elmah were also discovered. Most of the collected material seems to be attributable to Upper paleolithic and Neolithic; the more detailed study we are now carrying out will give an idea of lithic technological and typological characteristics.

At Aphrodisias, one of these customs is the visit of faithful foremen, workmen or nearby villagers who thus welcome us to another summer's work and assure us of their good will. Early last July, however, a nearly two-thousand-year-old "visitor" greeted us almost literally at our doorstep, a few days after our arrival. Indeed, a large relief carved with the figure of a draped woman appeared face down in the balk of earth of the Sebasteion, under the garden wall of our headquarters. The abundant spring rains had obviously washed away the earth that concealed it. It was tempting to free this lady "in distress" as soon as possible. We maintained our aplomb, however, covered up the relief again and waited until September to perform our act of liberation. For, in the course of spring, a project of shooting a television documentary film on our Aphrodisias work in late summer had been launched in London. The recording of this operation seemed an unexpected windfall and an ideal sequence for the motion picture camera. Thus we bided our time throughout most of the summer, and in early September eagerly watched the release of our unusual "well-wisher" from her prison of earth and stones. The figure proved to be that of a lifesize, frontal, fully draped woman, her head covered, and endowed with a curious conical object by her left foot. Unfortunately, the lower left corner of the panel had been cut out in late antiquity and prevented a full understanding of the figure's activity and identity. However, her partly preserved right arm stretched out above the object in question might well have been involved in weaving. Judging from the location of its discovery by the east end of the south portico of the Sebasteion, the relief once decorated the upper story of that corner of the building. Study, Research and Publication Projects In accordance with the practice started a few years ago, the 1984 campaign gave major emphasis to study and research programmes involving several monu- ments, varied groups of archaeological material and completion of manuscripts and publication preliminaries. It is gratifying to report, in this context, that a general, but well-developed resume of the excavations and their results between 1961 and 1983 was recently finished by this writer. Abundantly illustrated and including plans, full bibliographies and other relevant information, this volume, to be published by Muller, Blond &amp; White, of London. later this year, will be followed by a more detailed analysis of the excavations. Work on this treatise is currently progressing. Despite some delays encountered in its intricate production, the eagerly awaited Prehistoric Aphrodisias by Dr. Martha S. Joukowsky will also see the light of day later in 1985. Furthermore, the manuscripts of Mrs. Charlotte W. Roueche (on the Byzantine inscriptions), Dr. David MacDonald (on the coinage of Aphrodisias) and Prof. Fred M. Lauritsen (on the Ataeymir hoard and fourth century coinage) have been completed and are now on hand. They will be ready to go into production as soon as interested publishers are found. The preparation and continued study of Miss Joyce M. Reynolds on later Roman inscriptions, including a thorough review, collation and re-evaluation of the Diocletianic edicts, are also nearly finished. Her work, with that of the collaborator R. F. Tannenbaum, on the "Jewish" inscription is equally in manuscript form. This last study focused on a most important document concerning the Jewish community at Aphrodisias, 'Condensed from a report kindly supplied by Professor Kenan Erim.</page><page sequence="3">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 177 which seemed to have been sizable. Though a stray find, it perhaps belonged to a local synagogue and will be the subject of a separate book due to be published soon under the aegis of the Cambridge Philological Society. In a different context, the research of Mme. Nathalie de Chaisemartin (on the garland friezes) and of Dr. Sheila Campbell (on mosaics) also witnessed consider- able progress both on and off the field. Having completed his survey and catalogue of garland sarcophagi, Dr. Fahri I?ik, of Erzerum University, has pursued his inventory of all fragments of Asiatic or "columnar" sarcophagi, during his visit in July. On his side, Peter Rockwell also pursued his examination of the marble quarries as well as technical aspects of our sculpture in preparation of a monograph on the idiosyncrasies and techniques of the School of Aphrodisias. Last but not least, the classification of Byzantine and early Islamic glazed ware was extended to pottery boxes collected from additional excavated areas by Dr. Elizabeth Ettinghausen. In addition to these progresses and achievements, two major research projects were also initiated in the course of the 1984 summer, thanks to the participation of valuable new collaborators. In July, Dr. Marc Waelkens, of the University of Ghent, energetically launched a study of the architecture of the Agora and its Portico of Tiberius. The re-evaluation of the details and character of this important structure, however, was the focus of the efforts of another colleague, Dr. Dinu Theodorescu, of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris. In late September and October, Dr. Theodorescu, in collaboration with Mme. Juliette de la Geniere, inaugurated a meticulous new survey and re-examination of all surface and excavated evidence pertaining to the temple. His work will be amplified in the course of the 1985 campaign. The Sebasteion and the Tetrapylon The meticulous inventory, analysis and re-measurement of all the architec- tural elements of the propylon of the Sebasteion were continued. Limited sondages necessary for a full evaluation of the structure were undertaken in front and to the west of the remains of the gateway, more specifically by the two pylons and their descending steps. Though hindered by water seepage, these investigations still produced crucial data. A number of key architectural and other fragments were extracted from the various pavings of the Byzantine street that ran southward in front of the propylon and were packed here to try to confine the inundations resulting from the later fourth century earthquake (c. 365?). Three inscribed bases and many sculpture items were recorded among them and belonged to the decoration of the niches of the gateway. The former bore the names of Tiberius Claudius Drusus, probably a son of the emperor Claudius by his first marriage; of Julia, a daughter of Drusus Caesar (son of Tiberius, by Vipsania Agrippina) and of Agrippina Minor. Concentrated water pumping allowed a small probe south of the propylon at the edge of the south portico. It produced unmistakeable evidence of the original early Roman street, which was packed and overlaid following the fourth century earthquake in order to cope with the disturbed water table and evacuate the inundations coming from the east. No investigations of the temple area of the Sebasteion could be undertaken last summer. However, continued re-evaluation of the epigraphical evidence from here as well as the whole area seemed to suggest that the building complex may well have been in principle a precinct of Aphrodite Prometor, or, in Roman terms, Venus Genetrix, the tutelary divinity of the Julian house, with a suitable associa- tion of the goddess' Julian descendants, particularly Augustus, as well as those of the allied Claudian family.</page><page sequence="4">178 ANATOLIAN STUDIES The Tetrapylon restoration project witnessed much progress. Detailed analyses, measurements and drawings of all phases of the monument were completed. The foundations of the structure were further investigated and prepara- tions for anastylosis initiated. A number of joining fragments, including columns, cornice or entablatures, were repaired. In early October, thanks to the assistance of the Governor of Aydin and the cooperation of the Directorate of the State Waterworks of the province, all still standing columns, bases and entablature of the Tetrapylon were dismantled with a crane and carefully stored in a suitable area nearby. The pouring of new foundations, and subsequently, the start of anastylosis operations will be a major enterprise of the 1985 campaign. Limited mandatory excavations in search of still missing architectural ele- ments of the gateway were undertaken to the north and south. Several key fragments were recovered in walls of later Byzantine and Turkish houses where they had been reused, along with other extraneous material. The latter included a handsome Julio-Claudian male portrait head and several sculpture and epigraphi- cal items. In conjunction with discoveries made in the south Tetrapylon vicinity in earlier years, over fifty late Byzantine graves, many containing children's remains, were again located in upper levels and further strengthened the evidence for the existence of a small late Byzantine chapel or church arrangement within the ruins, or in the immediate neighbourhood of the Tetrapylon. In order to complete her study of Aphrodisian mosaics, Dr. Sheila Campbell briefly resumed the excavation of the private dwelling discovered in 1969 immedi- ately east of the Tetrapylon. Indeed, this rather palatial residence featured at least two rooms with attractive mosaic floors. One of them, an atrium, displayed a series of handsome designs, including panels showing a tigress confronting a snake, a lion attacking a bull and additional animal and geometric patterns. The other room communicating with the atrium to the north had a geometric mosaic floor that had been only partly revealed in 1969. Its excavation was completed in July, and two additional rooms were brought to light to its north. These may be identified as a dressing-room and a private bath, including elaborate plumbing and evidence of an upper floor, while the atrium and a marble-paved courtyard to its south, only half excavated, were part of the entrance and reception areas of the house. The function of the northern room with the geometric mosaic floor remains uncertain. It could have been a triclinium, and like the other units brought to light suggested a very elegant Byzantine townhouse to be probably dated to the middle of the fifth century. Part of another rather luxurious early Byzantine residence was revealed not far from the Tetrapylon, more precisely to the east. Investigations here were motivated by earlier discoveries in the so-called Water Channel area, nestled by the fortification wall in the northeastern sector of the city. The most significant material recovered there included the panels of the handsome Zoilos frieze. Additional stray fragments pertaining to this still unlocated important monument and reused in the foundations of Turkish village houses were found in 1978, but no subsequent investigations could be undertaken. Two trenches were dug in the area last year, and revealed part of a large room with a well-preserved decorative marble floor including its external wall located to the north and skirting a street. The wall also featured remnants of at least three window openings framed by double blue- marble columns with suitable bases and capitals. The iron grills which fitted in the intercolumniations were even found fallen outside on the pavement of the street. The interior face of the wall, on the other hand, was covered with brightly coloured frescoes, echoing a combination of Pompeian First and Second Styles. Elaborate designs imitated multicoloured marble incrustrations framed by attractive well-</page><page sequence="5">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 179 defined Corinthian columns. At least three superimposed layers were recognizable, but all seemed to be in a similar decorative scheme. A large amount of pottery, as well as four bronze vessels, were discovered on the floor level, near an arcuate, well-preserved niche. These finds suggested some household function for the room, but if so, only in its later use. For, its wall decorations would be too elegant for an area involved with domestic chores. It is possible, however, to date the room and its frescoes to the fourth or fifth century, while its violent destruction, amply illustrated by abundant charcoal fragments, the buckling of its marble floor and the collapse of a large chunk of its north wall onto the street, was the result of some catastrophic event. This may well have occurred in the seventh century, when Aphrodisias suffered much destruction resulting from a major earthquake, The study and restoration of the pottery found on the floor could eventually verify the accuracy of these preliminary observations. In the meantime, most of the wall paintings were lifted and suitably stored. The double blue-marble columns were also reset in their original place on the wall. A find recorded in the excavations on the street, outside the room proved to be quite unusual. It was an attractive, though headless, statuette of a squatting Egyptian goddess, perhaps Maat, carved in a handsome dark-green stone, and may well have been an heirloom, or import, perhaps of archaic or later Ptolemaic date. It is useful to recall, in this context the existence of cults of Egyptian divinities in western Asia Minor, Caria, and more specifically Aphrodisias, where representations of Sarapis, Isis and Harpokrates are encountered in several bronze issues of the Roman period. The Portico of Tiberius and the "Agora Gate" The Agora of Aphrodisias, more particularly its Portico of Tiberius and so- called "Agora Gate" was the scene of further intensive and extensive study and restoration activities. More than fifteen columns and their fragments were re- examined and subsequently re-erected on the west colonnade of the portico, adjacent to the Hadrianic Baths, in continuation of our 1983 operations. Many unknown and unrecorded blocks of the garland frieze of the porticoes were discovered. Clearing operations in those areas already dug by Paul Gaudin in 1904, Boulanger in 1914 and then G. Jacopi in 1937, yielded several important finds overlooked or neglected by the early excavators. For instance, a complete, inscribed panel was rediscovered. It recorded a dedication of a bath building to an unnamed emperor, to the theoi Sebastoi (divine Augusti), to Aphrodite and the People by several individuals, some of whom had been apparently also associated with the construction of the Sebasteion. Among several sculpture fragments on the other hand, three heads were especially noteworthy. A battered one was probably of tetrarchic date, while another belonged to a Muse or other female divinity. The most exciting one, however, proved to be a remarkable late (fifth century) bearded male portrait. Indeed, the fragment of its left eye and forehead had apparently been found in 1904 by Paul Gaudin hereabout and taken to France by him. It had been graciously returned to this writer in 1965 by M. Albert Gaudin, son of Paul Gaudin and brought back to Aphrodisias. The discovery of the rest of the head and its complete restoration eighty years after the recording of its small fragment was a thoroughly satisfactory experience. Now that it is whole, the portrait of this obviously squinting gentleman provides a splendid addition to the late antique gallery of Aphrodisian high officials. It also once again illustrates the remarkable achievements of the Carian sculptors in the fifth century. An equally pleasing development in this area was the corroboration of our theory concerning the later fourth century earthquake and its subsequent flooding</page><page sequence="6">180 ANATOLIAN STUDIES effect on the Agora, suggested by our interpretation of several architectural modifications in the Sebasteion and the "Agora Gate". A series of elaborate terracotta pipes were revealed, last year, laid in an east-west direction in the open area of the Agora, but at the level of the stylobate of the portico. A sondage or two along the colonnade brought to light at least one step below its stylobate, implying that the original level of the market-place was lower in Roman times but was filled in and fitted with a system of pipes subsequently to dispose of flooding waters coming from the east. Similarly, the rediscovery of the epistyle blocks bearing the dedicatory inscription of the Portico of Tiberius, originally found by G. Jacopi in 1937 brought us great satisfaction. Indeed, all previous efforts to relocate and re- examine these blocks had been unsuccessful. It appeared that they had been reburied in 1937, though the frieze fragments had been in great part removed to the Izmir Archaeological Museum. In addition, a number of frieze blocks also not seen or recorded by G. Jacopi were also revealed in study and restoration activities along the northern flank of the portico. Four columns were fully or partly erected on that side of the Agora. Finally, work on the "Agora Gate" complex, that huge aediculated faqade closing the east end of the Portico of Tiberius, was limited to study of the excavated architectural elements and tentative restoration drawings. Brief excavations were attempted, however, on the south side of the complex, adjacent to the Acropolis. The face of the imposing sustaining wall already visible on this side of the hillock was further clear, along with additional traces of a passageway, or vomitorium, leading up to the tiers of seats of the theatre. It is likely that this wall acted in part as the backwall of the south colonnade of the Portico of Tiberius, near its junction with the south tower of the facade of the "Agora Gate". A large amount of architectural sculpture and masonry debris of various origins was recorded in these investigations. The Temple of Aphrodite and the Theatre Baths Research and review activities, including several sondages aimed at determin- ing archaic levels, were resumed in autumn, specifically on the Acropolis, in the Agora and the Temple of Aphrodite. Preliminary observations, in part seconded by soundings, suggested two possible phases in the construction of the present temple, one involving the shrine or sanctuary proper, the other the addition of the peristyle around it. These theories, however, require further analysis as well as probes of strategic locations. The major stratigraphical disturbances caused by the trans- formation of the temple into a Christian basilica make it mandatory to inspect and analyze patiently and minutely all relevant archaeological and topographical evidence. In this context, an interesting discovery was made in the north aisle of the basilica. Removal of a few marble slabs used to pave this area in order to probe beneath revealed that the great majority of these slabs were actually sarcophagus panels that had been placed, carved face down, to form the pavement. Over twenty of these fragments were recovered. Most of them belonged to garland, or columnar ("Asiatic") sarcophagus types. Several panels were quite well-preserved, while others were battered or semi-finished. Restoration work was the main preoccupation in the "Kaisersaal" of the Theatre Baths. First of all, the blocks of the two "peopled scrolls" pilasters framing the oecus of this basilica-type hall at its eastern end were reassembled. Some of them were reset in situ and discreet concrete replacements appropriately prepared for their missing portions. By the end of the campaign, both pillars were again re- erected to their full height. All elements of the decorative archway which spanned the distance between the two were also returned to the hall and studied for eventual</page><page sequence="7">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 181 restoration. Moulds of existing bases of the blue-marble columns separatng the nave from the aisles were taken, and out of them, casts were poured for two columns whose bases were missing. These were also re-erected in due course and further enhanced the already impressive appearance of the vicinity of the theatre. ARSLANTEPE, 1984' During the 1984 campaign new data were obtained concerning the 3rd millennium stratigraphic sequence. Moreover the excavation was extended in the most ancient of the public buildings of the end of the 4th millennium (Period VIA). Period VID (Early Bronze III). In the upper part of the mound successive rebuildings of the same house with changing planimetric and accessory arrange- ments point to a development within the period. The pottery found in the earlier structure in fact indicates an early phase of E.B. III showing typological connec- tions with the preceding E.B. II aspect. Moreover, another section of the big town wall surrounding the E.B. III town was exposed in the lower part of the hiiyiik slope. The SW-NE direction of this section gives some indications as to the perimeter of the town and demonstrates the corner position of the semicircular bastion brought to light in 1983. Period VIB (first quarter of the 3rd millennium). Further data have been obtained concerning the main levels of this period, which show an alternation of a Red- Black Burnished Ware Horizon and a Late Reserved Slip Ware Horizon. Particu- larly interesting is the new evidence concerning the first occupation of the period, immediately following the Late Uruk levels. This appears to be a settlement with mostly wooden structures consisting of post-houses with wattle and daub walls and shows an early aspect of the Red-Black Ware Horizon. Numerous pots found in situ on the floor of a better-preserved house manifest, within the Red-Black ware, different characters from the pottery of the superimposed level, pointing to an internal development in this production, which could probably be related to parallel processes in the proper East-Anatolian and Transcaucasian cultural areas. Period VIA (last quarter of the 4th millennium). During the 1984 campaign a palace-type building (Building IV) was discovered, whose monumental gate had already been brought to light in the past seasons. Only a part of this large structure was exposed; anyhow the finding of a complex of storerooms adjoining on the east side of a wide corridor, which runs from the gate towards the north, gives significant indications as to the main planimetric and functional characteristics of the building. The access to the storerooms was through a middle room, which is the only one to have an entrance from the corridor. This seems to have been used for the movements of goods, probably connected with some ceremonial activity, as is suggested by the presence of a large niche and of painted geometric decoration on the back wall. Each of the side storerooms contained different pot categories, which point to different contents. The pottery shows the known typology of period VIA, although a new remarkable presence of spouted vessels, mostly bottles of an unquestionably Late Uruk type, can be observed. 'Information kindly contributed by Professor Alba Palmieri.</page><page sequence="8">182 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Numerous clay sealings have been found in situ close to the pots, among which both cylinder and stamp seals are represented. Cultivated vine seeds from the southernmost storeroom have been identified. They stand out for their early date and geographical location different from the peri-Mediterranean environment of the known 3rd millennium evidence. BESK- TEPE, 1984.1 Beqik- Yassitepe In this year eight areas were excavated on B.-Yassitepe, and in nearly all of them Troy I levels were reached. The settlement pattern of this period, which is too little known on Troy itself, is now becoming clearer. We have evidence for at least seven large houses in a row side by side which can be described as "megaroid" on account of their anterooms. They were 4 to 6 m. long and 12 to 13 m. wide. The roofs were flat. They were supported by relatively numerous stanchions resting upon stone slabs. Both in the anterooms and in the main rooms were to be found beds or "divans" constructed of paving stones covered with layers of clay. In front of the entrances, at a distance of about 2-5 m., lay emplacements consisting of flat stones tightly packed together. They served possibly for storage of provisions. Similar constructions were found at Demircihiiyiik, though there they were sunk into the ground. As regards the finds of the early Troy I period, the number of miniature clay battle-axes has increased to such an extent that with these, as with other, finds a link has been forged with Ezero in Bulgaria. Finds of the Troy VI period also came to light in 1984 at several spots as in the previous year. Within the Hellenistic settlement of the third century B.C. new finds enabled a third building phase to be added to the two already recognized. The small finds show that at this time military operations took place on or against Yassitepe. From the Byzantine period the foundations of a fortified, palace-like layout, perhaps a warehouse, came to light in almost all the excavated sectors. This building is to be dated to the time of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, i.e. the first half of the 13th century A.D. Bedik-Sivritepe Two further soundings brought the work at B.-Sivritepe to a close. In spite of an increase in material, no remains predating Troy I were discovered. They had been totally destroyed by the building of the Hellenistic tumulus. Begik Necropolis South of the settlement at the foot of the mound of B.-Yassitepe an extensive cemetery was discovered in 1984. This graveyard, which is to be dated to the time of late Troy VI or even Troy VIIA (13/12th centuries B.C.) lay originally directly by the sea. In the most southerly of our excavated areas, only 15 m. from the nearest grave, the sea shore of the end of the 2nd century was traced. In the ascent from the shore to the graveyard, 4 metres above, several steps were uncovered which had either been worn by long use or deliberately constructed. The shore itself could be dated by finds. In the cemetery area 56 structures were excavated, all embedded in soft sand and for the most part facing south-east. The absence of intersection and the regular distance beween the structures suggested that there had originally been markers on 'Translated from a report kindly contributed by Prof. Dr. Manfred Korfmann.</page><page sequence="9">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 183 the surface. Their position just underneath the surface had resulted not only in robbing in antiquity but also in destruction through agricultural operations. Five different types of grave were identified. Of these, three variants were only found once: a grave surrounded by a light covering of clay, a stone cist of regular rectangular stones, and a grave house. Stone circles occurred twice. But much the most frequent were pot burials. The pots used were either relatively large pithoi or vessels of medium size. They lay horizontally in the ground with the mouths slightly raised. The mouths were always surrounded with stone slabs and vertical slabs closed the mouths themselves. Hitherto unexplained are small intact vessels, their mouths stopped by stones, but containing neither skeletons nor traces of ash. The most interesting find of the campaign in the cemetery area was a grave house, in the form of a megaron measuring 3-8 by 2-7 m. The anteroom, which had originally been planned as open, had been closed by lightly laid stones. In the aperture that remained was found a rather large pithos. As a grave-gift there was found a Mycenaean seal of black stone. It is the first of its kind from an assured archaeological context in Asia Minor. Along the walls of the grave house and probably in relation to it several pithos graves had been sunk, among them an undisturbed burial of two skeletons of children in a pot. Here were grave gifts of numerous beads of stone, frit, bone and one of gold, and a Mycenaean pyxis, showing the original wealth of this necropolis. Hitherto only bones of men and children have been found, none of women, but in view of the total of only seven sexually identifiable adults that means little. Of a contemporary settlement in the vicinity, to which this large cemetery could have belonged, there are at present no signs. The finds of the Troy VI phase on Yassitepe and from the foot of the mound are somewhat older than those from the cemetery. Beside the possibility that the graveyard might be related to a historical event which formed the nucleus of the Iliad of Homer, one might imagine it to be a plague cemetery, far removed from men's dwellings. It was evidently directed towards the sea, as shown by the stone slabs by the sea shore. These were obviously brought in to form the roofs of the graves. Hasan Paya K6;k Again in this campaign the recording work was continued in the hunting tower of Hasan Papa (c. A.D. 1780). Further incised drawings of ships on the wall plaster were copied. We regard this work as now finished and hope that this important monument will be spared from ultimate destruction by the ravages of time. CAFER HOYUK, 19841 The 5th campaign at Cafer Hdyiik took place in two halves. The first part, from 13 to 28 September, was devoted to the ethnoarchaeological research, the second part, from 28 September to 28 October, to the excavations themselves. Work was undertaken in the areas previously opened but with different purposes: a stratigraphical sounding in the east, a more extended excavation in the west. All activity was concentrated on the neolithic, and no new tombs were opened in the medieval cemetery. Eastern Area The entire campaign was devoted to level VI. The whole sounding was 'Translated and condensed from a report kindly provided by J. Cauvin and 0.

Eight cells were identified, communicating with each other in a north-south direction. Their small interior space was further reduced by buttresses. Walls and floors were in places covered with a whitish coating which has not yet been analysed. At least two phases of construction and occupation could be dis- tinguished. At the latest level one of the rooms yielded some important material: human figurines, an incised clay plaque, bone sculptures. By systematic sieving a bead, vegetable remains and abundant microfauna were recovered. After its destruction this building served as a zone of external occupation, with bones and post-holes, for a building lying outside the excavated area. Western Area Several buildings excavated last year were dismantled to reach the lower levels. It was confirmed that building 4 was later than building 3. West of building 3 a new cell began to appear, beneath which the first neolithic burial yet found at Cafer H. came to light, the skull and the face apparently covered with a whitish coating. This burial (in contracted position) was lifted en bloc for study at the anthropological laboratory of the University of Hacet Tepe. Building 3 as a whole rested on a bed of pebbles. The dismantling of structure 2 revealed that it overlay an earlier building (structure 10) the walls of which were preserved only up to a few centimetres. This structure 10 in turn rested on a bed of pebbles the dimensions of which were apparently the same as those of structure 2 above. Structure 6, to the east, also rested on a bed of pebbles and was seen to be later than structure 10, which it overlapped. To the east, further rooms of structures 8 and 9 were excavated, but it is too early to make any statement about the organization of this sector, which is much disturbed by later pits and by the medieval cemetery. The same applies to the sector north of structures 8 and 9, where remains of at least two further structures, 13 and 14, were uncovered. The impression left by this part of the neolithic village is that of dense occupation, with buildings succeeding one another and resting against one another and using as zones of activity the ruins of earlier structures, where one finds hearths associated with post-holes. Archaeological Material The neolithic furniture of the Western Area comes either from pits or from the interior of houses or from areas outside the buildings. Stone tools include principally scrapers on large flakes, more generally on short flakes, sometimes tanged; arrowheads, all with tangs obtained by bevelled retouch, are rare, as are blades with abrupt parallel retouch on the edges ("sickles"). The use of flint is greater and more varied than in previous campaigns, not only in the form of burins but also pointed blades, borers and side-scrapers. There are large struck blocks of silex and even a core which has been flaked in a similar manner to the obsidian nuclei found in the ditches. In the ditches the ddbitage is more abundant than retouched material. In the buildings, on the contrary, ddbitage and tools are infrequent. Here was found an axe of hard, polished and pecked stone with dissymmetric chamfer, and from the area outside buildings 2 and 10 comes a very fine laminar point with retouched convex edges, of obsidian, and a long sickle-blade of coarse-grained flint analogous to the sickles of the late pre-pottery neolithic of the Levant. Finally, much heavy furniture, bone tools and stone ornaments (fragments of</page><page sequence="11">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 185 bracelets of cylindrical section or flat with ribs, discoid beads) have been found. In particular, a cupel and a marble bracelet with multiple grooves coming from building 9 were recovered, with clay sling balls. The furniture of the Eastern Area belongs to more ancient structures than in the west. At first glance it presents the same typology as the western area: there are no long sickle-blades, but arrowheads, scrapers and "sickles" of obsidian are similar. Two zones have been distinguished: the north, corresponding to an area outside the habitation, contains abundant fauna. The ddbitage is very important and better represented than the retouched pieces: tanged arrowheads on square base, sickles, microliths in the form of micro-awls, blades truncated and retouched, triangles with a concave side. The bone furniture is very varied: large eyed needles, chamfered tools, punches, polishers and numerous worked spalls. To the south, ddbitage is very rare; there are multicellular houses which have produced furniture that is unequally distributed. In four of the cells very little material was found: worked pebbles, an axe in hard stone, some pieces in bone or obsidian. Two other cells differ from these in containing much fauna and microfauna as well as abundant furniture. One (cell 65) produced neither weapons nor sling-balls but several tools, such as a flint sickle, some bone pieces (needle, polisher, spalls) and ornaments (discoid beads, a bracelet of cylindrical section). The other cell (63) produced arrowheads and daggers and a series of exceptional objects: a rectangular plaque of fired clay 2-5 cm. thick of trapezoidal section, with incised lozenges on its upper surface; a bone object, 7 cm. long, of biconvex section, with incisions and grooves at both ends, which does not seem to be a handle; four small human figurines, 3 to 5 cm. high, with schematic head, one (masculine) standing, with small breasts and very marked sexuality, the three others feminine with very opulent breasts, all with truncated legs. Two are sitting in an upright position, the third is bent forward. Thus the 1984 campaign has proved particularly rich in archaeological furniture. The bone industry is much better represented than in previous campaigns in quality, quantity and variety. The human figurines, among the most ancient found in Turkey, are well fashioned and the presence of a male figure is exceptional at this period in the Near East. Geological Studies A petrographic analysis was made of the heavy furniture, ornaments, figurines, hearth stones and the wall plaster. Most of the materials are autoch- thonous or carried down by the De'irmen dere which flows alongside the mound. The chalk used for the walls doubtless comes from a formation of chalky stone situated half-way up the mountain on the left bank of the Euphrates opposite the tell. The quartz, in the form of big lumps, would come from Piitiirge; so also would the marble used for the bracelets. The flint, of which two sorts were distinguished, is either from the region of Karliova north-west of Bingil or possibly from Piitiirge. Calcite and travertine are also from elsewhere. There is no obsidian in this region. In the region of Bingd1, 150 km. north-east of Cafer, it is present, not in the form of flows but as lumps somewhat altered on the surface. Three sources have been identified: at Bingal itself (30 km. east of the town); at Catak near Karliova, and at Alatepe, where snow prevented any prospecting. The last two are on the banks of the Gdniik, a stream that flows into the Murat. These obsidian beds can thus be reached by water. A workshop has been found at one of the sources near Bingd1. Basalt and travertine are to be found near Karliova, at Devecik and Elmahl respectively.</page><page sequence="12">186 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Ethnoarchaeological study This has been carried out this year at the hamlet near Karapinar (20 houses) with the same objective as the previous year for the hamlet of Cafer (15 houses): building techniques, use of space, and domestic furniture. (A YONU, 1984' The ninth season of excavations of the pre-pottery early village site of (ay6nii (Diyarbakir province, southeastern Turkey) was again carried on in 1984 within the istanbul-Chicago Universities' Joint Prehistoric Project with Prof. Dr. H. Cambel and Prof. Dr. R. J. Braidwood as co-directors, Dr. M. Ozdogan as field director and with the collaboration of a team of architects of the Institut fiir Baugeschichte, Karlsruhe University, under the direction of Prof. Dr. W. Schirmer. Field Work Actual work in the field took place in late summer and early autumn and lasted about two months. Excavations were conducted in two different sections of the mound. 1-The western area: In earlier campaigns a number of separate trenches had been worked in this area of the mound and it had become clear that during the so-called "cell building" phase this section was intensively used, both for habitation and for other daily functions, and that the architectural remains were considerably well preserved. In order to investigate a variety of different aspects of village life at Qay6nii, such as the settlement pattern, functional area, etc., it was necessary to expose a larger area. In the previous campaign of 1981, separate trenches were joined by working in the areas between them, so that an area of some 700 sq. m. could be excavated down to the second building level of the cell phase. In 1984 the area was expanded to some 1000 sq. m. in order to save some of the buildings from natural erosion. Excavation of this large exposure has revealed new and interesting facts concerning the settlement pattern and transformations during consecutive layers. Stratigraphically, it is now clear that in this area there are at least four main building layers in the cell phase and a number of re-building phases in each of these. According to the evidence from this exposure, the spacial organization of the cell type of buildings is neatly laid out in every building phase. But even though the main lay-out of the buildings is consistently of cell type, there are a great number of variations concerning the arrangement, number and dimensions of the cells. It is hoped that a better understanding of these will be reached after the completion of the functional analysis of the artifacts found within them. It is in the open areas between the cell buildings that most of the daily activities of the village seem to have taken place. Thus, it was possible this year to recover three different chipping places, two for flint and one for obsidian, as well as numerous areas with clusters of bone, ash or fire, in these open areas. In the main cell-building phases there were considerable changes in the lay-out, orientation and location of the buildings. However, although most of the cell buildings have undergone numerous repairs and additions during their life span, the lay-out of the open areas has been preserved in each case. Below the layers of the "cell phase", two more architectural layers were found this year, within which rather well preserved buildings have been excavated. The 'Report kindly provided by Professor Halet (ambel.</page><page sequence="13">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 187 plans of these latter consist of three rooms (larger than in the cell buildings) in a row, with well paved floors and small inner buttresses. In plan, these are very different from both the cell and grill types of building and we are inclined to consider, with some reserve, that this may be a transitional phase from the grill to the cell buildings. A similar seemingly transitional phase was also encountered in the eastern section of the mound. 2.-The eastern area: The main exposure at Cay6nii is on the eastern part of the mound, where work was already begun during the first, 1964, campaign. The extent of the excavation in this section now reaches to 50 x 50 m. This area has yielded the most substantial buildings of (ay6nfi, among them the so-called "terrazzo building", the "flag-stone building", and a large central open area, a "plaza", contemporary with the cell phase. This year's work in this large exposure is the continuation of work already begun in 1981. (a) The plaza: In previous campaigns there had been attested, by clearing and neatly levelling the remains of earlier buildings, the presence of a large open area, covering an area of about 30 x 40 m., established at the time of the early cell houses. It was conserved all through the cell phase, by repeated re-levelling with debris of burnt mudbrick and clayey soil. Three parallel rows of big standing stones were found within it. Its north and northeast sides were surrounded by substantial buildings. In 1984 trenches of 10 x 10 m. were excavated in this plaza, and we now have some indication that we have finally reached its western end. It seems obvious that such a large well-kept and well-organized open place had a variety of important functions for the whole community. Among others it seems to have been the main butchering area of the site, as indicated by masses of animal bones and specialized tool-like chipped-discs. (b) Another objective of the work in the eastern section was to investigate pre- cell layers in larger areas. In the exposures of previous campaigns, buildings immediately preceding the plaza were usually found to be destroyed and levelled. However, this year relatively well preserved architectural layers were recovered in its southwestern corner which lay below the plaza and above the grill buildings. The building plans of these are rather similar to those recovered in the western area below the cell buildings described above. Below this seemingly transitional layer, there are again the layers of the grill phase. This year four new grill buildings have been recovered and work has continued in cleaning two others recovered in earlier seasons. It is now clear that the number of building layers in the grill phase is much greater than our earlier estimates, being not less than eleven. It is also possible, due to the excavation of subsequent grill layers to state that there was a gradual development in the plans and structural details of the grill buildings. (c) The third objective of the work in the eastern section was to complete the excavation of the so-called "skull-building" which was begun in 1980. Until this year, three small rooms of this building, yielding about 100 human skulls with no other skeletal parts or artifacts were cleaned. The floors of these rooms were neatly paved, reserving a small pit in each room. This year the pits were emptied, and all of them were found to contain various fragments of human skeletons, seemingly thrown in. This year the large courtyard located on the southern side of the rooms was also completely cleaned. It had a lime-plastered floor, and a huge stone slab measuring 260 x 165 cm. was found lying on its southwestern side. The slab is of a pinkish coloured stone, not existing in the immediate neighbourhood of (ay6nii. Its surface and sides are well finished and polished. The face of the building,</page><page sequence="14">188 ANATOLIAN STUDIES looking towards the courtyard, is reinforced with two buttresses. The walls of the building are white-plastered and there are traces of red plaster (ochre?) on the buttresses. It also became clear this year that the building was repaired a number of times and had possibly been rebuilt. Study of the Material The study of the artifactual and non-artifactual material of Qay6nii has been expanded in 1984 in the hope of preparing the second volume of the (ay6nii series. The study of animal bones, bone artifacts, ground stone artifacts and clay objects is practically finished, and the study of the human skeletal material has been initiated. A number of archaeometric studies and analyses are also in progress. DEGIRMENTEPE (MALA TYA), 19841 The rescue excavations at Degirmentepe have been carried out since 1978 by the joint efforts of the Prehistory Department of Istanbul University Faculty of Letters and the General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums. The project has been financed by the Middle Eastern Technical University TEKDAM and conducted within the framework of the Lower Euphrates project. The Degirmentepe mound lies within the area of the Karakaya Dam lake and will soon be covered by water. It is situated 50 m. south of the Euphrates in the territory of Imamli village in the Old Malatya district. It is a medium-sized mound and has yielded material from the Medieval period, the Byzantine/Late Roman, Iron Age, Early Bronze Age I (Khirbet Kerak) and Chalcolithic Ubaid periods. Of these various cultures, the Ubaid period, "predecessor of the Sumerian culture", is the most recognizable. As a result, our main efforts in 1984 were concentrated in unearthing the mud-brick structures of this period which covered a very large area. Excavation was carried out on three levels of this period in a 600 m2 area on the southern part of the mound. The third level of the Ubaid was encountered directly after the removal of the Iron Age remains. 30 mud-brick buildings of different sizes were cleaned out and in some of them, floor level was reached. These square buildings set side-by-side were arranged round an inner courtyard or along both sides of a street. They formed 3 building complexes in the north and east and resembled the south-western building complex dug previously. As a result of the studies carried out on the north of the middle wing of the south- west complex, it was established that these buildings were workshops. A 2 m. long mud-brick covered passage connecting the north to the eastern part of the building was also unearthed. This passage and the furnaces in the workshops were the most important finds of the season. Copper slag found lying near a furnace suggested that copper was melted in these workshops. Clay sealings, bullae and pottery with geometric, floral, animal and human figure decoration were unearthed from the 3 building complexes. Because of the large quantity of clay sealings, seals and bullae discovered at Degirmentepe, it is thought that the site was an important trading centre on the banks of the Euphrates during the Chalcolithic period. At the present time, this collection of finds of the Ubaid period is second in size only to Tepe Gawra and leads the excavators to believe that the social structure of the site was "proto-urban" with a complex economic system. The archaeometry group of the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey continued their studies on the finds from Degirmentepe. These studies included age determination (using C-14, thermoluminescence, electron spin 'Translated from information kindly provided by Professor Doctor Ufuk Esin.</page><page sequence="15">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 189 resonance), analysis of copper remains, thin section studies of ceramics and various source analysis. DID YMA, 1984.1 Work at Didyma took place from 1 August to 27 September 1984 and consisted of the following activities. Excavations In the Temple of Artemis the north-west section of the bedrock was uncovered. After removal of debris with Empire-period pottery and a Hellenistic fill, the surface of the rock was reached; there were traces of buildings and numerous inserts, as elsewhere on this rock. On the north edge a third rock cistern, 1 m. deep, with an overflow, was found; it received its water through a cavern. It lies west of the "altar temenos" and dates, according to pottery found in it, from about 700 B.C. It was filled in at latest at the time of the layout of the temenos, presumably due to failure of the water supply. The Hellenistic pottery found in the fill gives a terminus post quem for the temenos. A sounding inside the western temenos wall, which was built of re-used limestone blocks (mason's mark R) revealed remains of an older layout which was possibly contemporary with the cistern but was not fully excavated. The question of the extent of the shrine on the rock in the 7th/6th century B.C. can be partly answered in so far as the newly found western cistern belongs to the oldest nucleus; unlike the two southern cisterns it had already been filled in at the time of the temple. From the Empire-period debris comes a well-preserved female head from a rather large terracotta figure with stephane, polos and cloak with veil, reminiscent of representations on coins of the cult-statue of Didymaean Artemis. Wells 3 and 4 on the rock (bottoms -9-20 and -24-80 m.), well 5 in the building on the slope (bottom - 810), and well 7 in the north building (bottom -4-70 m.) were investigated. All contain fresh water. Geological examination showed that these wells, like the cistern, were fed through porous layers of rock connecting with a water supply in subterranean dolines. The water comes out of clefts (southern cisterns) or caverns (wells and western cistern). In dry periods the supply diminishes, which had already caused complete failure at the time of the shrine. The wells on the rock again produced from the period of the infilling (4th/ 6th centuries A.D.) the well-known stirrup vases in great quantity, while wells 5 and 7 produced Byzantine pottery of various types. On the eastern side of the Sacred Way a surface excavation was carried out on the available land. In contrast to the temple area opposite, the eastern side shows dense early Byzantine occupation which has often swept away the ancient remains. A preliminary conclusion is that the eastern side was since late Hellenistic times bounded by porticoes and other unclarified buildings, which underwent consider- able changes after the third century A.D. A sounding was made in the Gate Road (Torweg) leading from the Sacred Way to the West Building ("Thermae"). An older road surface was established, which had been built over in the west on the erection of the West Building (1st/2nd century A.D.). Possibly this older roadway too formed a link between the Sacred Way and an unknown building that was later replaced by the West Building. Study of Finds Work on the Hellenistic and Empire period ceramics was concluded; 1700 'Condensed and translated from a report kindly contributed by Prof. K. Tuchelt.</page><page sequence="16">190 ANATOLIAN STUDIES samples were subjected to neutron-activation analysis. Architectural records were completed up to 1983. Recording of the drawings on the walls of the temple of Apollo continued. Animal bones found in 1983 and 1984 were studied. Topographical Investigations In the course of the observations on the Sacred Way between Miletus and Didyma which had been proceeding since 1980, a remarkable layout was located this year on the ridge called Stephania. At that point the road, which is about 5 m. wide and edged with stones, runs along the east flank of a hill, on the top of which lies a limestone foundation about 26 m. long. This high terrace offers a view of Didyma at a distance of about 8 km. Amongst the limestone fragments that strew the slopes were found archaic roof tiles with black and red slip and many pieces of marble much damaged by weather and by fire. The remains of archaic male and female seated statues of the types familiar from Miletus and Didyma were recovered. Much better preserved, however, is the sculpture of a sphinx (ht. 84 cm., head and legs missing) found lying by the western edge of the road just under the surface where it had fallen from above, the first known from East Ionia. It may be presumed that this structure, with its ex votos, is one of the shrines beside the Sacred Way, known hitherto only from the so-called "inscription of the Molpoi" (Miletus I, 3 no. 133), which formed stations on the road to Didyma. DOMUZTEPE-KARA TEPE-ASLANTAS, 1984' The main archaeological work in the Karatepe-Aslantag region was carried out at Domuztepe, located on the left bank of the Ceyhan river, on a hill facing the Late Hittite site of Karatepe-Aslanta? and threatened by the construction of the Aslanta? dam. The site of Domuztepe consists of three distinct zones: the main settlement area on the plateau, the slopes overlooking the Ceyhan river and the actual hill itself of Domuztepe. The latter was partly investigated in the early fifties by the late U. B. Alkim and revealed Classical and Early Iron Age levels, including some reliefs and sculpture of the Late Hittite period. The plateau and slopes, which are a part of a natural park area, were densely covered with trees and shrubs so that precise documentation was impossible until recently. The slopes of the hill, which are in the reservoir area of the Aslanta? dam, were cleared of their green cover in 1983 and rescue excavations were carried out. The campaign of 1983 revealed, rather unexpectedly, the remains of fortified settlements of the 2nd and early 1st millennium B.C. and there were also remnants of earlier occupation debris of the late 4th and early 6th millennium B.C. The Aslanta? dam was completed in late 1983 and by the spring of 1984 the slopes of Domuztepe had already been covered by the waters of the lake. The 1984 season was therefore given over to work on the plateau, with a view to making a topographical survey and recording the extent of the settlement. However, due to a mishap at the Aslantag dam site, the level of the reservoir lake was lowered considerably, thus providing another opportunity to investigate the slopes. Consequently, in 1984, fieldwork at Domuztepe was conducted in two different areas of the site. On the plateau, the thick cover of shrubs and bushes was cleared in an area of about 1 sq. km., so that for the first time it became possible to examine the remains in that area. Remains of substantial architecture, including fortification walls and large buildings have been exposed but the date of these structures is still unclear. 'Information kindly provided by Professor Halet Cambel.</page><page sequence="17">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 191 On the slopes, rescue excavations took place in four different trenches: 1-The early Iron Age city wall. In 1983 the wall was followed only to a height of halfway up the slope. This year we continued to the top of the slope and this will in the future enable us to tie in the wall with the remains on the plateau. 2-In the area behind the gate of the Iron Age city wall exposed in 1983, the remains of a paved passage ascending by steps was found. This year further cleaning of the area revealed a continuation of the passage. 3-The large Iron Age building on the rock outcrop. A major section of the building had already been excavated in 1983. This year another section was cleared. The walls were found to be much disturbed though they were still useful for an understanding of the extent of the building. 4-On the southern part of the slope a large and substantial terrace wall was recovered; this seems to have been used for a long period of time in prehistory. A number of architectural features were found in association with it. EPHESUS, 1984.1 In continuation of the projects started the previous year, work took place from May to mid October, with a staff of 57 and a work force of about 100 men. In the Artemision the acquisition of a stronger pump facilitated work in the north-west area of the Croesus temple. Outstanding among the small finds is an ivory statuette which is similar to the so-called Megabyzos and is distinguished by a peculiar headpiece. It belongs to the seventh century B.C. At the lower Agora work in the lower strata was continued. In places the walls are preserved above window height. Thus the level must have been greatly raised up to the level of the Mazaeus and Mithridates gate in the Augustean epoch. The anastylosis of the South Gate was continued and extended to the Neronic (Eastern) Stoa of the lower Agora. South of the Library of Celsus under a late mosaic we came upon the remains of a peristyle house that had been shortened in the north when the Library was built. Among the numerous finds a great bronze rhyton with the head of a lion may be mentioned. Work on the early Christian basilica by the Eastern Gymnasium has been concluded. On the Magnesian Gate also the publication is being prepared. At the Church of St. Mary a wide trial trench was dug from the north towards the north wall of the church. Finds showed that the dating of the longhouse must be revised. At the Olympieion clearance was continued. The length of the Peristasis is 59 m. In the course of the publication of the houses on the slope test trenches were sunk in house I. Provisional plans were revised as part of an overall survey. Conservation work was continued, house 2 is already covered in. Conservation of the frescoes has been speeded up by means of a new sand-blast machine which can also be used for the mosaics. Two volumes of indexes to the inscriptions of Ephesus have now appeared. New finds are being printed in the Oesterreichische Jahreshefte. Volumes on the sculptures (200-300 pieces) and on the small finds of the market-place (FiE X/2) are in preparation. An enormous number of coins (about 400) once more came to light.

The project was directed by Nurettin Yardimci on behalf of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The 1984 work concentrated on cleaning, surface investigation and recovery excavation. The restoration and excavation team consisted of Adnan Misir, Sabri Kiziltan, Zeynep Kiziltan, Ilkii izmirligil, Pinar D6*erli, Remzi Yagcl, Nur Altmylldiz, Ayge Haznedar Ozkan, Gdniil Ozmen, Mustafa Biiyiikkolanci, Adnan Sakar and Sabria Aydal. The work was conducted in 3 different areas: (1) The H6yiik, (2) The Great Mosque, (3) The Inner Fortress. Work at the H6yiik (1) Trenches A and B which had been opened in the former season were extended. Trench C which was first excavated by Rice in 1952 was further excavated in order to gain a fuller understanding of the stratigraphy. Architectural remains belonging to the 12th and 13th centuries, stone, ceramic and metal artifacts were unearthed as part of these studies on the Hdyiik. The houses were both square and rectangular in plan and were laid out side by side. The streets were very narrow. A circle with a pit lying at the centre was unearthed. The houses consisted of courtyards paved with brick and stone (these were called "hayat") and other rooms opening out onto the courtyard. Generally, there were 20 metre deep wells in the courtyards, and in the storage rooms containers were found in situ. Among the finds made of baked clay, there were potsherds, plates, bowls, measuring bowls, and sling-stones belonging to the Ayyubid period. Metal objects included silver and bronze bracelets, rings, door ornaments, silver and bronze coins. Also unearthed were a bone musical pipe, stone weight, a pestle and a female idol in the Syrian style which might belong to the second millennium. Work at the Great Mosque (2) The Great Mosque was built by Merman II, the last Caliph of the Armenians. Necessary work prior to restoration was carried out; this consisted of cleaning, examination of architectural finds and planning studies. Similar studies were carried out in the courtyard of the mosque, in the minaret, the ?adirvan, in the pavilions on the east and north and at the niche. Work at the Inner Fortress (3) The cleaning work begun in 1983 was continued in 1984; the south-west tower, the area to the left of this tower and the entrance to the fortress were completely cleared. HIERAPOLIS, 19842 The 1984 season of excavation and conservation at Hierapolis in Phrygia began on 2nd August and ended on 23rd September. The excavation, under F. D'Andria, was a continuation of the work done since 1981 in the area east of the main street that joins the Frontinus gate to the Byzantine gate. The following sequence emerged: 'Information kindly contributed by Dr. Nurettin Yardimci. 2Translated from information kindly supplied by Prof. D. de Bernardi Ferrero.</page><page sequence="19">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 193 A. a 12th century Byzantine house with a two-storeyed central block surrounded by enclosures probably used to shelter animals. B. a brick well connected with the kilns discovered in 1983 (post-6th century). C. rubble from the collapse of extensive 6th century brick buildings. D. below the Byzantine levels, remains of monumental buildings including a spacious portico opening to the east, with marble columns about 80 cm. in diameter, Corinthian capitals and dentil cornice. The Roman red glaze and relief pottery found indicated that the buildings dated from the Flavian reconstruction. Between the portico and the building with pilasters already identified as the Caesareum there extends a large area, 110 m. long, apparently devoid of buildings. A sounding showed that the Caesareum opened onto a piazza lying about two and a half metres below modern ground level, the depth of the fill being due to rainwash from the surrounding hills. It seems likely that this enormous space was the Agora of Hierapolis and that it belongs to the new layout of the city adopted in the Flavian period, after the earthquake that occurred under Nero. This discovery opens new possibilities for the study of the topography of the city. In the north necropolis M. Waelkens began a study of the "smooth" sarcophagi in both limestone and marble, with a view to establishing a more accurately dated typology. So far 604 sarcophagi or fragments have been recorded, photographed and classified; they can be divided into about fifty different types. The development in the proportion between chest and lid, in the acroteria and in the mouldings permits very precise dating. It has also been possible to prove that the sarcophagi were roughed out in the quarries but completed in situ. In general the sarcophagi date from the 1st to the 4th century A.D. with a concentration in the 3rd century. In connection with this, T. Ritti worked on the inscriptions on the sarcophagi, most of which are still unpublished. The checking of the inscriptions from the theatre also continued. In the theatre, an excavation, under G. Bejor, in the part of the hyposcenium to the north of the central door confirmed the existence of a scaena earlier than the Severan one; a fragmentary marble statue of Latona was found. To the south of the central passage of the hyposcenium, clay pipes were uncovered that collected and discharged the water in the euripos. Restoration work included the laying of the pavement on top of the reinforced concrete slab laid last year; this was done in a mixture of white cement, limestone chips and crushed terracotta to match the colour of the ancient limestone used in the walls. The re-erection of the front of the hyposcenium was also continued. Five columns were set up (one on the left and four on the right of the central door) together with their entablatures. Casts of the slabs of the Apollo cycle have been set up on the podia of the scaenaefrons, together with part of their related mouldings; and the making of casts of the slabs of the Artemis cycle has begun. IASOS, 1984' Dr. Fede Berti directed the work, which took place in September 1984. After the usual clearing and cleaning of areas selected for investigation, most of the work was done in the regions of the Agora, of the early Christian basilica and of the sanctuary of Zeus by the east gate. Results were satisfactory and important discoveries were made. 'Translated from a report kindly provided by Prof. C. Laviosa.</page><page sequence="20">194 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Early Christian Basilica. The room at the north end of the narthex, measuring 5 m. by 4-60 m., was cleared to reveal a well preserved pavement of small marble slabs. Excavations outside the basilica were continued in order to clear the structure at the end of the north aisle and establish the line of the exterior of the apse, which turned out to be polygonal. During this work a further eleven graves were found, belonging to the late (1 lth-12th century A.D.) cemetery that overlay the basilica. In the north aisle the three surviving panels of the mosaic (one of which still has part of the dedicatory inscription) were lifted. A section was dug right across the width of the nave which revealed three burials, the only ones out of the 238 so far excavated that were certainly between the two pavement levels of the early Christian building. They were enclosed in a small apsed room probably belonging to one of the earliest building phases of the basilica; a small group of coins of Valentinian II was found at a depth of 0-84 m. Sanctuary of Zeus. All material of the late-archaic votive deposit inside the late-classical naiskos was removed. The rectangular foundation at the bottom of the naiskos was also lifted, and much material belonging to the votive deposit was found underneath, until a north wall was reached at a lower level which may belong to the original sanctuary. The very large quantity of material now in process of conservation dates from the middle of the 6th to the first quarter of the 5th century B.C. It includes a great many Attic black-figure and red-figure vases as well as clay statuettes and female masks. One particularly important find was a small kouros statue in limestone, almost complete, which preserves considerable traces of painting. Conservation. The conservation work on mosaics was mainly concentrated on those of the basilica, but the other mosaics in course of treatment were also checked. Conservation of pottery centred on the cleaning and mending of about 300 pieces selected for removal to the Milas Museum. Progress was also made on the sorting and assembling of material from the deposit in the sanctuary of Zeus. Topographical Survey The survey of the land-walls of the promontory, begun in 1980, was continued. The grid for the plan of the island city has been checked as have several specific groups of buildings. Photography In addition to a photographic record of the progress of the excavation, the objects selected for the Milas Museum have been photographed. The recording of the material from the votive deposit in the Agora, which is being studied by Dr. Michelucci, has been completed.

IKIZTEPE, 19841 Systematic excavations sponsored by the University of Istanbul and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism were carried out at ikiztepe in July and August, 'Translated from a report kindly provided by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Onder Bilgi.</page><page sequence="21">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 195 1984. The season's work was oriented only towards exposing the remaining burials in the graveyard on Tepe I. To this end, the grid-squares IV-10/C-19, C-20, D-l, D-2; IV-12/C-19, C-20, D-l, D-2 and IV-13/C-18, C-19, C-20, D-l, D-2 in Trench "D" were investigated. 196 new simple inhumations with burial gifts were found at various depths under the surface soil. The majority of the gifts are of bronze and include weapons, tools, jewellery and symbols, as last year. Here and there were found also baked clay bowls, anthropomorphic representations, stone pendants or bone hooks in some graves which enabled us to shed light on the burial practices at Ikiztepe, although no common orientation was observed in the skeletons. This season for the first time, bronze weapons and tools were found in groups on the earthen floors of the Early Bronze Age II building levels into which the graves of the Early Bronze Age III had been dug; the skeletons of the latter were mostly in an extended position with arms by the sides. These bronze objects display characteristics of types known from those left in burials, thus indicating that the Early Bronze Age III objects are developed from those of the Early Bronze II period. Further excavations planned for the summer months of 1985 might well shed more detailed light on these connections and thus facilitate a greater understanding of the metallurgical development in the Middle Black Sea region of Anatolia in the third millennium B.C. IMIKUSAhI, 1984' The excavations at imikugagi were carried out between 6th August and 14th September 1984 by the students of the Faculty of Letters of Istanbul and Ege Universities. The project was financed by the Middle Eastern Technical University, Department of Conservation and Restoration of Historic Monuments. In 1984, the planning square L 15 was opened at the northeast of the mound in order to re-investigate the details of the Medieval, Late Hellenistic and Iron Age building levels. All the details of the three phased Medieval settlement were established. A complex of three houses was unearthed from the first level of the earliest phase, which has two levels. The 30 metre long Middle Iron Age fortifications consisting of a double wall continued on the top of the mound through planning squares 014, Ni15, M 15 and L15; these were examined and removed. Thereafter, investigations were con- centrated on the second millennium architectural remains which were destroyed by a fire. At the present time, three building levels have been established, two of which belong to the Late Bronze II period (7th and 8th building levels). The architectural remains of the 7th level were 65-70 cm. wide walls and rectangular ovens which have parallels at Norguntepe in the Late Bronze Age; these were much disturbed by storage and rubbish pits. A stone button seal with Hittite hieroglyph inscription provided good information for the dating of this building level. The 8th level belonging to the earlier phase of the Late Bronze Age suffered some destruction; however, a rectangular building complex with four rooms was unearthed in reasonable condition. These rooms have 60-70 cm. wide mud-brick walls on stone foundations. One of the rooms which is in a very good condition measures 3.50 x 4.30 m. The unique find of this level is a mother goddess figurine standing 12-4 cm. high. The figure is nude but wears pointed sandals. The 9th level which was again destroyed by fire has not yet been investigated but some changes were observed in the stone foundations and the new forms of pottery. The pottery of 7th, 8th and 9th levels was completely different to that of the 'Translated from a report kindly contributed by Docent Dr. Veli Sevin.</page><page sequence="22">196 ANATOLIAN STUDIES first millennium. The most common types of the 7th and 8th levels are the flat plates, the orange pots with string cut bases and bottles with pointed bases known from the Keban, Malatya and from the Hittite Empire levels of Central and Southern Anatolia. However, in the earlier levels the cups were more elaborate and the simple smooth edges were sharper. The jars with grooved edges increased in number and some jars were decorated with red bands and others with zig-zag painted lines. These differences are particularly apparent in the 9th building level and for this reason we consider it to be the Late Bronze Age I level. On the south of the mound, in planning squares P13 and P14, we investigated the architectural detail of two magazines belonging to the Late Assyrian Colony period and measuring 7-60 x 2-20 m. It was established that these magazines had undergone a rebuilding, and new information emerged in connection with the wall construction, especially the cross timbers and the wooden lattice-work interposed between the mud-brick walls and the stone foundations. In trench S/14a, which was opened with a view to establishing the transition between the Middle Bronze Age I and the Middle Bronze Age II, it did not prove possible to reach the second millennium levels which lie under a 2 m. deposit of silt. The mud-brick walls on stone foundations and the pottery do not differ from those of the Middle Bronze Age I levels; they are of interest in as much as they demonstrate the earlier phase of this building level. The most common and well known ware of this level is the Habur type cup with red painting on the neck and shoulders. iZNIK KILNS, 19841 The 1984 season was carried out between 6-27 August by Professor Oktay Aslanapa, director; Professor Serare Yetkin, Dogent Dr. Ara Altun and architect M. Baha Tanman together with a large group of specialists and students. We appreciate the assistance given by the administration of Iznik and the Museum Directorate. This excavation was supported basically by funding from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism but we also received some financial help from istanbul University and the Turkish Automobile Club. The 1984 excavation was conducted in a vacant area on the corner of Hamam Street and Maltepe Street to the east of the Municipality Baths. Although it had already been established that there was a well preserved oven by the wall of the garden on the north, the dig was extended towards the south since work in the garden area required legal expropriation. During the course of the excavation, a chimney and a ruined oven connected to the well-preserved oven were partly unearthed and we therefore established that a large tile-ceramic workshop was organized around this complex. More precise results will be obtained about workshop technology and tile- ceramic production during the Ottoman period at iznik if further studies at this site are conducted in future years. The tile-ceramic material unearthed from the site demonstrates that craftsmen were experimenting with innovations. For example the almond-eyed, large face figure like the human head of Miletus is seen on Ottoman ceramics for the first time. A further new find for 1984 was a yellow glazed tile. In addition to these two important pieces, there were many other fragments made by different techniques and these are being restored in the Museum by 'Translated from information kindly provided by Professor Dr. Oktay Aslanapa.</page><page sequence="23">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 197 restoration students. As in past years, restoration and studies were carried out in the Museum by another team; inventories were also drawn up. Twelve pieces, sufficiently valuable to require registration, 244 finds already registered and 53 bags of other material and oven equipment were handed over to the Museum. Other field researches were conducted as part of the excavation programme but no more pits were dug during the season. It will be possible to compare the technology of iznik tile production with that of Kiitahya only when more knowledge has been gained from future seasons and from an evaluation of the 1984 finds. iZNIK THEATRE, 19841 The ruins of the Roman Theatre at iznik (province of Bursa) in the Selguk quarter occupy an area of 7,332-65 sq. m. At the end of the work carried out in 1984 and in the previous years, 1,220 sq. m. have been excavated. As the scaenium of the theatre had been covered by earth, we had no idea of this construction until 1984. In order to learn more about the stage-building (scaenium), which is always the most magnificient part of a theatre, research was carried out in an area of 126 sq. m. Thus the north-eastern part of the proscenium, 20 m. long, has been brought to light. At this point there was a 3 m. space between two parallel walls, running east-west, 0-85 m. thick, made up of rectangular blocks. The height of the foundation is 0-75 m. and the width 0-85 m. The main foundation (1-5 m. wide) which was made in the same technique lay underneath. The walls which were made of square-cut stone were set on foundations of rubble, chalk and sand. Between this main foundation and the foundation on the north a channel, 0-65 m. wide and 1-2 m. deep, was uncovered. In the middle of this wall, there was a 2-25 m. wide door. On either side, 2-4 m. from the door, there was a niche. These niches were 0-85 m. wide, semi-circular in shape and made from crystalline limestone blocks. Only one metre of these niches was preserved but from the presence of iron sockets it is understood that these niches continued higher. A marble plinth 0-15 m. wide and 0-25 m. high was found between the wall and the floor. It was decorated with a row of three leaves, a row of palmettes and then a row of beads. From the presence, in situ, of fragments, it can be assumed that on the plinth there was a 0-50 m. high marble frieze. The lower and upper parts of the frieze were decorated with a Lesbian cyma, while the part between was decorated with a spiral and crest motif. On another piece, two oval shields, leaning on each other, were shown upright. On the outer surface there was a square motif. Separately, a spear, the end of which pointed to the upper corner of the square motif, was shown. On another frieze fragment, which was also found in situ, there was an oval upright shield in an area bounded by Lesbian cyma. There is also a spear (shown with neck and blades) and a helmet with peak; on the helmet there are volute motifs. Above the helmet, there is a sword with sheath and straps. It is thought that a representation of cloak and armour, not on the other frieze, was also shown on this piece. According to the data collected it is clear that as on the front of the scaenium, marble veneer, plinth and frieze extended along the whole front of the proscenium. This is to be understood from the rough trimming of the niches and wall surfaces 'Translated from a report kindly supplied by Dr. Bedri Yalman.</page><page sequence="24">198 ANATOLIAN STUDIES and from the small iron sockets. It is also to be understood from the surviving traces that there were statues in the niches. A base in situ was unearthed at the east end of a late Byzantine wall which ran parallel, 1-5 metres away, to the proscenium. The wall was 11 m. long, 0-5 m. thick and 1-10 m. high. The height of this marble base was 1-15 metres. The upper part was broken; the surviving height is 0-88 m., the diameter (at the base) 1-10 m. The base was octagonal and had eight panels. It was decorated with bead, Lesbian cyma, palmette and a row of 3 leaves. The panels were surrounded by borders of Lesbian cyma. On the upper surface there were iron sockets. In the space between the two parallel walls of the stage building, a Greek inscription was unearthed, 1-38 m. high, 0-44 m. wide, 0.45 m. thick. It had ten lines. At the north-west of the same area, a statue base was found. The height of this base, which had also a one line inscription, was 0-64 m; the width and thickness were both 0-45 m. A tabula ansata is to be seen on the east surface of a stone which was once used in the theatre and was later set on the north wall. There was an inscription and a monogram in this tabula ansata. In 1982, two stone-vaulted exit tunnels, of which one has smaller, the other larger arches were uncovered in the north-east trenches. This year, a part of the larger arch at one of the two symmetrical openings, 2-5 m. wide and 1-5 m. high, came to light. There was a corridor in this vaulted tunnel which began very close to the mouth. The corridor was oriented to the south but then turned westwards and ran parallel to the vaulted gallery before reaching the orchestra. In 1982, Dogent Dr. Metin Ozbek began a study in an area measuring 55 sq. m., in the lower cavea which lies between the diazoma and the orchestra. He continued his study this year and found 37 human skeletons. The skeletons had no regular orientation. They were placed according to the slope of the cavea, the heads up and the feet down. In order to remove wholesale the bodies of these people (who had clearly died in a very short time), the cavea was turned into a tip and the bodies were placed one on top of another as there was not enough room. Some bodies which had been broken into pieces were put into wooden containers and then left. Some of the bodies were naked, some had been wrapped in cloth. The arms were set crosswise on the breast or parallel to the body, or with the hands on the genital organs. The legs were parallel to each other or very rarely, crossed. All of them were male. The ages were between 18 and 41 and the average height between 1-155-8 and 177-9 cm. The skeletons were brachycephalic, hyperbrachycephalic, ultrabrachycephalic, mesocephalic and dolichocephalic. They are thus all from Alpine and Dinaric or Nordic race. On some of the bones and skulls, there are traces of sharp tools to be seen. The teeth were not very worn. There was little sign of decay. In general, their food was meat or fish. They ate very few vegetables. On some of the skeletons, the wisdom teeth were still in the jaw bone. The persons had died before the wisdom teeth had erupted. These skeletons probably belonged to the soldiers and supporters of the Laskarids who defended the city of iznik against the crusaders at the beginning of the 13th century. This conclusion is based on the buckles, keys and spearheads found in the area in 1984 and from the generalizations given above and from the copper coins belonging to the Laskarid period, found under the skull of a skeleton in 1981.</page><page sequence="25">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 199 KA UNOS, 19841 The Kaunos excavations have been carried out on a regular basis since 1966. The 1984 season lasted from July to September and was directed by Professor Dr. Baki Ogiin assisted by four university instructors and assistants and nine students from the archaeology, architecture and drawing departments. The studies were conducted in four different areas: 1. The Bath Excavation: the excavation of the Apodyterium, which was begun in 1982, was completed in 1984. In addition to many coloured marble pieces and bricks belonging to the niche arches, a few ceramics of the Byzantine/Roman periods were unearthed in this area, which had been covered by 1-5 m. of rubble. 2. The Theatre, Skene (Stage Building) Excavation: this year both ends of the skene were cleaned and a small part of the parados wall on the theatron side was unearthed. On the northwest, the orchestra level was reached and some blocks of the threshold of the parados door encountered. As a result of these excavations there came to light many statue fragments belonging to the skene, statue bases, inscriptions and architectural fragments in addition to some pot sherds belonging to the period between the 5th century B.C. and the Byzantine period. 3. Studies in the Terrace Temple: the excavation of this temple is almost complete but further small excavations were undertaken in order to clarify some obscure points. In addition to these small soundings, the south part of the sacred path leading up to the end of the terrace was completely unearthed. Three columns from the north portico of the terrace and the bases of other columns were restored in their place. 4. Studies at the Agora: the studies in front of the stoa were continued and a small trench opened at the floor level of the Agora; during this process ground water was reached. In addition to this work, preliminary studies were carried out for the restoration of the tholos which was unearthed to the east of the ancient harbour in 1971. The drawings and descriptions of the structures were almost completed, the original location of the various pieces were determined and some structures were restored outside the building as a re-building trial. KOiK HO YUK, 1984.2 The 1984 season at K6?k Hdyiik lasted from 11 September to 2 October. The mud-brick walls on stone foundations and carefully plastered floors of level 3 were unearthed immediately underneath the remains of level 2. During the course of the excavation it was demonstrated that the well-preserved architecture of level 3 was not much different in character to that of levels 1 and 2. The daily life of the level 3 people is well illustrated in the ovens, "tandlrs", the grinding stones, pottery, food storage jars, the tools and weapons found in situ on the carefully plastered hard floors of the rectangular houses, store houses and religious structures. The door frames and thresholds established that the houses were entered by a door at street level. The roofs of the buildings consisted of wooden cross timbers, matting, straw and earth, like many of the present-day houses in Anatolia. This construction method is shown by the carbonized wooden timbers and straw discovered during the excavation.

These short-necked, grooved, large mouthed, rounded jars are beige or red in colour and are all burnished. They are decorated with motifs of mother goddesses, gods, bulls, cows, goats, donkeys, antelopes, chamois, turtles and snakes. This type of finely made vase is found in all three levels. The mother goddess representation-long faced, open armed, with exaggerated organs and hair blowing in the wind-was executed in a stylized way. The white-painted bull figures in high relief were usually placed on a red or pink background. the heads were shown from the front while the bodies were shown in profile. Unlike the stylized representation of the mother goddess figure, the animals were executed in fine detail and in a naturalistic manner. The most beautiful and well preserved example of the cow decorated vases was found in situ on a floor of level 3 in 1984. This vase was decorated with two cow figures in high relief, one behind the other; the vase itself was round-bodied and had a pale red burnished finish. The cow figures were done in the same colour as the vase. On another vase there are two chamois, the heads again seen from the front with the bodies in profile. However on this vase the heads of the chamois are placed side by side. On another piece one sees representations of creatures resembling an antelope and a turtle. The front feet of the turtle clasp the rim of the vase making it look as though he is drinking something from the interior. On the bull decorated vases, the mouths of some of the bulls face the vase's rim. The heads are worked in higher relief than the bodies and the eyes, ears, nostrils and horns are very well executed. The bodies of the bulls are extended in line with the head's upward movement. Another find, unfortunately broken, was a large red vase decorated with a white painted cow. The preserved pieces show the back of the cow and a hand milking it; from the pieces that were found, it can be understood that the figures surrounding the vase were separated from each other by vertical bands of geometric motifs. These very well made vases were undoubtedly used as libation vessels. Other vases were decorated with male figures (gods?) in relief. One of these figures wears a round cap and a pelerine and holds a tree. The other motifs appearing on the vases are trees, crescents, sheaves of wheat, triangles, and figures resembling idols. A mother goddess statue made of gypsum was found in level 3. She sat on a throne. This statue is dated to the early Neolithic period and demonstrates the interest in plastic arts during the period. The head of the ?,atalhoyiik mother goddess is missing but the K6ok H6yiik mother goddess statue, although broken at the neck, is complete. She wears a round cap and has large eyes, a Roman nose, plump cheeks, large breasts and large hips and calves. The very stylized details of the face show the advanced level of artistic development that had been reached. Many small mother goddess figurines were also found at K6Ak Hoyiik. These figurines, statues and the vases decorated with mother goddess motifs demonstrate that she was the symbol for fertility at K6k Hoyiik as she was at (atalh6yiik. The ceramics of all three levels were hand made. The pottery of level 1 is all monochrome whereas that from level 2 and 3 is decorated with circular, triangular or wavy motifs in darker paint on a light surface. The repertoire of shapes include handled or handleless bowls, drinking mugs, short or long necked, large mouthed, circular vases, plates, fruit dishes and storage jars. In addition to the monochrome and polychrome ceramics, there are other examples decorated with the in-fill technique. The surfaces of these ceramics are dark in colour and are burnished; they are decorated with white-filled incised dots, lines and triangles which were worked while the clay was wet. The burials of adults and children in levels 2 and 3 demonstrate a tradition of</page><page sequence="27">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 201 intramural burial among the people of K ok H-yiik. The grave goods consisted of decorated ceramics, tools and weapons of obsidian, stone, bone and necklace beads from oyster shell. No stamp seals were found in levels 1 and 2; however four were unearthed from a grave in level 3. The cups and personal articles of a dead person show that the people of K6-k H6yiik believed in life after death. In the excavations thus far, no metal objects have been discovered. The tools and weapons unearthed were made of obsidian, flint, stone and bone. The obsidian knives, daggers, arrow and spear heads demonstrate the very developed level of expertise since obsidian is a material difficult to shape. There is a large quantity of obsidian weapons and tools since the site was situated close to the Melendiz mountain where very rich obsidian beds are found. The obsidian of this region, originating from Qiftlik and Acigil, spread to the west (Catalh6yiik, Stiberde, Qukurkent); to the south west (Antalya, Karain, Okiizini); to Qukurova and Cilicia across the G6ksu plain and through the Sertavul and Giilek passes. It was then distributed to Cyprus (Khirokitiya) by sea and to Palestine (Jericho) by sea and land. Thus, K6ok Hdyiik with rich obsidian sources played an important role in this trade. The cultural similarities between the Konya region and Ko6k Hoyuik lend support to this close relationship. The unique finds of K6ok H6yiik demonstrate the prosperous lives of its people and presumably this prosperity derived from the trade. The vases decorated with human and animal figures in relief are not seen in any other part of Anatolia. The bull and the mother goddess were important cults in the early Neolithic period at ?atalh6yiik but that site did not produce any vases with relief decoration. The vases, undoubtedly used for ritual purposes, are a ceramic type specific to K6'k H6yiik. Only a plate of the Samarran culture with female figures on a painted cross resemble the mother goddess figure of K6?k Hoyiik. There is, however, a stylistic resemblance between the mother goddess statues of Ko6k Hytiik and Catalhdyiik. The polychrome ware is more abundant than the monochrome and the patterns of this polychrome pottery are like that of Catalh6yiik (early Chalcolithic) and Canhasan 2B (early Chalcolithic). In our opinion, the culture of K 6k H-yiik is contemporary with the last phase of the early Neolithic, the late Neolithic and the early Chalcolithic phases of ?atalhdyiik. It is of course somewhat premature to date K 6k H6yiik before determining the definite levels of the settlement. KOiKERBABA HOYOK, 19841 A last season of rescue excavations sponsored as usual by the Middle East Technical University in Ankara was carried out at K06kerbaba Hdyiik in Septem- ber and October 1984. The season's work was devoted to investigating the Early Bronze Age III layer. To this end, the grid-squares 1-10, 11, 12; J-10, 11, 12, 13; K-10, 11, 12, 13; L-10, 11, 12, 13; M-10, 11, 12, 13; N-10, 11, 12 in Trench "A" were excavated. As a result of these excavations two new mud-brick buildings with stone foundations dating from the latest phase of the EBA III were exposed. The one unearthed on the eastern sector of the mound seems to be a shrine of the settlement, since it has a built-in colossal hearth with a round plastered platform next to the west wall. The colossal hearth has white-washed walls and shows no signs of any fire or ash inside or on the round platform. In addition, this building has low narrow plastered platforms running along the eastern, southern and western walls, the lower parts of which are black-washed.

Prof. Dr. 0nder Bilgi.</page><page sequence="28">202 ANATOLIAN STUDIES This and other buildings badly damaged the architectural remains of the second phase of the EBA III. Only a pavement constructed of unbaked mud-bricks was exposed in grid-squares K-12, and K-13. On the other hand, excavations developed in grid-squares J-10, K-10, J-11, K-11, L-11, M-11, M-12, M-13, I-11, 1-12 and J-12 brought to light the architectural remains of the third phase of the EBA III. These remains representing the earliest settlement at K6skerbaba, consist of stone foundations of a huge building, the southern part of which still lies underneath the mud-brick houses of the first phase. The exposed part of the building displays small rectangular rooms connected to each other by narrow openings. This season's excavations also shed light on the burial customs of the EBA III cultural layer of Ko-kerbaba Hdyiik. A child skeleton was found in a polychrome decorated jar buried just beneath a plastered floor of the badly damaged room of the first phase. The mouth of the jar was closed with a potsherd with a grey burnished slip. The second burial was located just outside the north-eastern corner of the so-called shrine of the third phase. This was a pithos grave. Its mouth was closed with two vertical slabs, the outer one of which originally projected from the surface soil to indicate the presence of a grave. This burial yielded no gifts except for a bronze ring still on the finger of the deceased. KUR UCA Y HO YUK, 1984.' The seventh season at Kuruqay H6yiik was conducted in August and September of 1984. The year's objective was to enlarge the excavation trenches and unearth completely level 6A of the Late Chalcolithic period. The trench was, therefore, enlarged by 500 sq. m., the total excavation area now being 3,000 sq. m. The architecture and plan of the Late Chalcolithic level were clarified almost completely. A small room, opened last season, which is thought to be the store room of the "shrine", was again dug in 1984. From the finds in this room, large pots and jars, a bin placed in a corner and many little vessels, it is understood that this room was used for keeping sacred material. On the east side of level 6A, a large town of the Late Chalcolithic period, there was a main gate. This suggests that there were four main gates. An interesting find from this level is a small figurine of a man; it is very stylized, stands 5-5 cm. high and is made of clay. Up to the present time no similar figurines have been found in Anatolia. During the 1984 season there was little extension of the early Chalcolithic level. It was, however, determined that during this period there were at least two building levels on the western slopes. The ceramic materials demonstrate that these two levels parallel absolutely those of the first to fifth levels at Hacilar. The Late Neolithic settlement was encountered approximately 80 cm. below the early Chalcolithic building level. A wall of this building phase, some 30 m. long and 1 m. wide, was unearthed. There are two semicircular towers, one at the west end and the other one in the middle of the wall. It is understood that this is a city wall. The western end of the wall disappears down the slope of the hill; however the eastern end stops abruptly. The line of continuation of the wall could not be fully determined this year but will probably be understood when the excavation is enlarged towards the middle of the mound in the next season. The finds of this level are a very well preserved standing female figurine, some clay spoons and bone spoons with handles shaped like animal heads. These finds clearly resemble those of Hacllar levels 6 to 9. The same may also be said for the rich ceramic finds of this level.

The 1984 season lasted from 6 August until 21 September. Since the funding of the excavation was meagre, the studies were concentrated in the area called the colonnaded building. In order to establish whether or not this building extends towards the south, the 5 x 10 m. trench which was opened last year was enlarged to 10 x 15 m. In addition, two small soundings were conducted to the west of the colonnaded building and to the north of the new trench. In 1983, in the southeast of the 5 x 10 m. trench, the remnant of a wall running towards the west was unearthed and two Attic-Ionic style column bases were found in this wall. In 1984, in the new trench, this wall continued but was covered with rubble and soil from the newly opened trench. Some of the rubble was removed and various architectural fragments unearthed. On the eastern side, some column bases were also encountered. As a result of these investigations it was understood that the south columns of the colonnaded building continued up to this new area. The aim of further research in 1985 is to excavate the intervening area and to compare the finds from this new area with those from the trench opened in 1983 and enlarged in 1984. From the first small sounding a Greek inscription of eight lines on a circular statue base was unearthed. This inscription states that Apol- lonides from Kyme dedicated a statue of a Satyr to the god Serapis. Unfortunately, this statue has not yet been found. From the second sounding there was unearthed only a column base from a Doric style building. Other finds from the excavation included many inscriptional fragments, coins, pottery from the west slope of the hill and further ceramics of the Megara bowl type. LIDAR HO YUK, 1984.2 The sixth campaign on Lidar Hdyiik by the Heidelberg Institute for Pre- historic Archaeology took place from 26 August to 16 November 1984. Work was concentrated on two areas of the Acropolis. The step trench on the north slope was continued to the point that the stratigraphical sequence from the Middle Ages down to the beginning of the Early Bronze is completely revealed. The investiga- tions in the potters' quarter of the Early Bronze Age were further extended. But work in the Early Bronze settlement of Nevalla Cori to the east of the village was discontinued. 1. Acropolis On the plateau, beneath the Hellenistic settlement and the horizon of pits of levels 4 and 5, investigation of the deposits of level 6 of the time of the Persian domination was continued. The latest phase of this level (a) in the main area shows small buildings divided by streets, and in the underlying phase (b) these show a clear plan. Two narrow lanes divide the settlement into three long house com- plexes. In the middle quarter three groups of rooms could be distinguished. In 6 c the buildings have the same basic pattern. The two lanes were closed by gates, and the layout of the plots was evidently taken over from 6 b almost unchanged. Only the inner partition of the house diverges. This phase shows clear signs of destruction by fire. The oldest phase (6 d) shows a different arrangement.

The western sector of the plateau revealed in level 6 of the Persian period three building phases. The houses along the edge of the slope impinged on a fortification running round the summit which was only preserved in traces. The houses contained simple hearths, domed ovens and clay corn bins. A pithos burial also of the Iron Age produced an Old Assyrian cylinder seal as a grave gift. Level 6 is peculiar in the poverty of its finds. The light buff pottery shows mainly carinated bowls and trefoil jugs. Blue frit beads are numerous. Character- istic of the Persian period in Syria and Palestine are the fragments of Persian "rider figures" and Astarte reliefs, also knee fibulae. Whether the lowest stratum of level 6 and level 7 reach back to the Assyrian period future excavations will show. Under the Iron Age occupation and a deep layer of filling, which is dated to the Late Bronze Age, the well-preserved remains of the spacious settlement of Level 8 came to light. Six rooms belonged to a rather large building of character- istic layout, the 1-50 m. wide walls of which were partly preserved up to a height of 2-50 m. The largest room measured 11 x (at least) 6-20 m. The white-plastered walls carried a broad horizontal stripe of dark red colour. Under the carbonized fallen beams of the roof many vessels came to light. Bone carvings belong to inlays such as are characteristic of wooden boxes of MBA Palestine. An 11 -line tablet in Middle Babylonian ductus was also found. 2. The Step Trench The sequence of cultures, more than 30 m. high, on the north slope of the mound was completely laid bare by a trench in 5 steps, resulting in a series from the beginning of the EBA to the Mongol invasion of 1241. There appeared to be a hiatus between the end of the LBA, c. 1200 B.C. and the 7th/6th century B.C. From the new evidence a burnt building-level (3) on the east slope found in 1982 under Iron Age levels, containing mainly hand-made pottery, and in which a notable find was a limestone figure of an ibex, is to be dated to the Late Bronze Age (cf. AS XXXIII, 254). On Step 2, under 3 layers of Hellenistic deposits, remains of a house abutting on the fortification wall were investigated. According to the ceramic evidence they belong to the time of Persian domination. On step 3 with level 17 extensive occupation of Middle Bronze II had already been reached in 1983. The underlying level 18 (a-d) showed a similar layout. Two building complexes, each of 3 rooms, corresponding in plan to those of level 17, were separated by a street running east- west and covered with gravel. In one room were altogether 18 burials, mostly in stone cists but also in pits and pottery vessels. Among them were 5 skeletons of adults in crouching position. Grave gifts included pots, necklaces of mussels and beads and bronze rings and bracelets. In level 18 e-g a change was observed in the tight sequence of levels. North of the street a narrow house impinges on a strongly built fortification wall of mud brick which ends in a two-roomed bastion. According to the rich finds of light-coloured pottery (like Hammmim-et-Tiirkman), terracottas, carved objects of bone and bronze objects, Level 18 also belongs to the Middle Bronze Age. On step 5, under the 3 horizons of the latest phase of the EBA, two further levels were brought to light: level 4, with 3 phases, revealed a large room, 5.60 x 2.80 m., with massive ashlar walls, constructed in a fish-bone pattern. In burnt debris, together with many pots of the late third millennium B.c., lay a bone cylinder seal (ED. III) and the head of a limestone figure which can be compared with similar statuettes and limestone reliefs of the early historical period in south-</page><page sequence="31">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 205 east Turkey and North Syria. The next level 5 showed only meagre traces of architecture, covered with deep layers of ash, clay, slag and potsherds. They may have come from the refuse of furnaces. Thus in 12 m. of cultural deposits the development of the Early Bronze Age, beginning with a fortified settlement of advanced EB I, can be viewed as a whole in all its stages. In the lowest levels finds of the chalcolithic Uruk, Obeid and Halaf types increase, among them two Halaf- period stamp seals. However, building levels of this period have not yet been touched. 3. The Early Bronze Age Potters' Quarter The excavations on the west terrace started in 1981 in the area of an extensive potters' quarter of the Early Bronze Age were continued in levels 4 and 5. From level 6 six more kilns came to light. Best preserved were 3 ovens in a row which stood on the alluvial Euphrates mud against the bottom of the artificial mound. Two of these show firing chambers separated by a central partition within a rectangular base. The perforated floor with part of the domed firing chamber was still preserved. These two structures are 5-40 and 5-20 m. long and 2-70 and 3-20 m. wide respectively. The next oven to the east, of horse-shoe form, is one of the largest examples with a length of 6-20 m. and a breadth of 3-20 m. To the north a battery of two ovens (5-00 x 3-20 m.) was brought to light, which served as an emplacement for a similar group in level 3. They overlay a further horizon of large ovens belonging to the oldest level (5). The mass of sherds forming the refuse add to the picture already obtained of plain Syrian wares with incised, painted and "reserved slip" decoration. Among them were numerous anthropomorphic and zoomorphic terracottas. The products of the 5 horizons of the potters' quarter correspond to the wares coming from the Early Bronze settlement and the necropolis. LIMYRA, 1984.1 Soundings on the slope led to a greater understanding of Lycian dwelling- houses. A complex of such houses covering about 400 sq. m. and presumably one- storeyed, of stone and wood construction, were erected on several rock terraces and comprised a gynaekonitis in the west and an andronitis in the east. Both areas were bounded in the south by a court. The whole complex of about 12 rooms was surmounted in the north by a shrine. The finds date the older period to the late Classical and are reminiscent of the synoecism decreed at Halicarnassos under the Hekatomnids. Possibly these may be the most northerly houses of a residential town laid out by Pericles on the Hippodamian system. Soundings by the Lycian Gate indicate a kind of barbican, leading presumably to the residence of Pericles. The wide walls of the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine successor-buildings in front of the gate favour the conclusion that this continued to be a centre of administration. Work in the ground-water south of the grave of Kaineus in Necropolis III produced further architectural pieces of the two-storeyed superstructure. The torso of a nude warrior statuette shows that this Lycian grave-monument of the period of the dynasts was also decorated with free-standing sculpture on the roof of the hyposorion. The greatest surprise came at the Podium Building in the western city. This building was conceived as a mausoleum on a square plan with sides of 15 m. The 'Translated from information kindly supplied by Prof. J. Borchardt.</page><page sequence="32">206 ANATOLIAN STUDIES upper part of the over 4 m. high podium was adorned with a frieze of metopes and triglyphs with centauromachies and a geison. Whether the upper superstructure was formed like the mausoleum of Belevi or consisted of a tholos needs further clarification. Plinths with fragments of lion-like monsters show in any case that this Hellenistic building was richly decorated with sculptures. A sounding in the orchestra enriched our conception of the stage building by revealing the surrounding wall of the pulpit and parts of a frieze of garlands and masks. MILETUS, 1984.' Work at Miletus began on 24.7.84, the actual excavation on 10.9, and ended on 31.10. There was a workforce of 10-25 men. As in the previous year, the work consisted mainly in the detailed study of earlier finds and the preparations for publication. In particular the following operations were carried out: 1. Soundings on Humeitepe to complete the excavation of the shrine of Demeter and to clarify certain points of stratigraphy. Many terracottas were found. 2. Investigation of the Heroon on the slope by the theatre. This complex, which came to light in 1904-1908, was accurately surveyed and probed by a number of soundings, and it was found that the Late Hellenistic tomb had been erected over a not much older building of which very little survives. The main building phase, with vaulted burial chamber, tumulus, and rows of rooms to west and east, is dated by the pottery, contrary to earlier views, to the late second or early first century B.C., but unfortunately almost everywhere only the foundations of the rooms are preserved, together with the remains of a columned Ionic facade which probably formed the front of the western row of rooms. Two older cisterns produced a wealth of interesting pottery, especially relief ware, which is important for dating purposes. In late antiquity and in the middle ages the complex had been extensively built over and robbed. 3. Soundings in the Heroon by the Faustina Baths. The quite good-quality underlying buildings of the insula were clarified and several cisterns here too produced a mass of pottery. In the debris of an ancient cellar were found many detached fragments of Hellenistic wall decoration with architectural mouldings and figured frescoes. 4. Among other activities, the study of sculpture and epigraphic material and several groups of pottery, as well as the enlargement of the museum depot may be mentioned. The area around the Heroon by the theatre was tidied up; the 4- columned mosque (probably the oldest mosque of Balat, from the 14th century?) was uncovered; and between the mosque, the old citadel gate and Heroon I, safety precautions were undertaken, so that the visitor can now get some idea of earlier spatial relations. In the process the mosque itself was restored. PERGAMON, 1984.2 The campaign began on 8 May 1984 with restoration work at the Trajaneum. This and other work at the Trajaneum ended on 30 September. Excavations in the city were resumed on 1 August and lasted till 6 October. The campaign finally ended on 23 October. 'Translated from a report kindly supplied by Prof. W. Miiller-Wiener. 2Translated and condensed from a report kindly supplied by Prof. W. Radt.</page><page sequence="33">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 207 A. City Excavations After an interval of two years, full-scale excavations were resumed in the area of the city. The area selected for the next few campaigns lies between the northern edge of the upper Gymnasium or the temple of Hera as southern limit and the main street of the Classical period to the north. The area lies immediately west of the peristyle building excavated in 1981 (AS XXXII 19). With constant extension of the excavations the grid system used hitherto had become unworkable and a new system was devised. Every 100-metre square is designated by the two (5-figure) coordinates that meet at its south-west corner, and these 10 figures are then abbreviated to four, namely the third, fourth, eighth and ninth, e.g. 30400/32600 becomes 4060. Within these, 10-metre squares are num- bered in rows from west to east beginning in the south-west corner, and each is in turn divided into 5-metre squares lettered a, b, c and d. Thus 4060/38 a denotes the upper-left 5-metre square of the eighth 10-metre square in the third row from the south in square 4060. Medieval Occupation In order to get a better picture of the Late Byzantine occupation and to avoid sinking shafts into the earlier periods, excavations were halted as soon as the Byzantine houses were cleared. The same will apply to the lower levels in due course. In general, the Byzantine houses built in the first phase (12th century) over the rubble of the ancient buildings were well separated and rectangular with straight walls. Many ancient stones were re-used. The mortar between the stones was, as later, exclusively mud. In the excavated area the later phase showed 4 courtyard houses forming a densely packed settlement. Characteristic of this 13th century phase are floors of well-fitted paving stones derived from ancient buildings. The two northern houses were entered from the main street in the north by way of broad and impressive stairways. They were bounded to the south by a terrace, and south of this the two other houses ended in a steep drop which forms the northern limit of the great Gymnasium above the eastern Thermae. The entrance to the two lower houses must therefore have been from the narrow southern alley. On the western side these complexes have not been fully excavated, and their eastern parts were completely removed during the excavations of the Peristyle Building in 1913, so that their plan remains unknown. The houses possessed the usual inventory of the Late Byzantine houses at Pergamon: wall niches, fireplaces, inner staircases, stone troughs, pithoi and millstones. Movable objects were scarce and it seems therefore that these houses had been systematically evacuated before their destruction. Several coins minted in the Frankish principalities of the Levant came to light, as in previous campaigns, mostly dating to the third quarter of the thirteenth century. From this cultural milieu comes part of a horse's harness which lay as if deliberately buried behind a pithos. It was made of iron, touched up with silver and carried in several places the same European coat of arms, three golden chevrons on a red ground. The form of the shield is high Gothic and is well suited to the building context (mid to late 13th century). Two bronze plaques in three-ply technique, decorated with fabulous animals, also belong to this period according to their find spot among the collapsed roof tiles. From the same context comes the decorated base or lid of a small bronze box(?), with ornament reminiscent of Islamic writing. After the buildings of this apparently prosperous phase and their evidently only partial destruction (earthquake?) followed a third and last phase with narrow</page><page sequence="34">208 ANATOLIAN STUDIES rooms and crooked walls. It is evident that they belong to a time of warlike activity, with a strong influx of refugees. This would be the last phase of the Byzantine occupation of the citadel, c. 1300, the years before Pergamon became Turkish in the first quarter of the fourteenth century. Classical Occupation On account of the systematic concentration on the medieval levels the levels of the ancient world were only encountered sporadically, and no complete buildings were cleared. In 4050/85 a-b and 86 a-b an ancient ramp-road paved with tufa slabs came to light. In 4060/26 b and 27 a-c, just beneath the surface soil, was a high plateau of rock showing many ancient workings. Evidently all walls had been removed in Byzantine times. In a hollow in the rock were found almost intact two terracotta statuettes of Asclepios and Hygieia, apparently buried deliberately. In view of the absence of coherent buildings it was impossible to say whether they represented a building sacrifice. Fragments of marble tiles were numerous, especially in the middle of the excavated area, which supports the supposition that the Empire-period exedra in the region of the peristyle building had a marble roof. Among isolated finds may be mentioned the following. Two Hellenistic marble heads, in miserable condition, were found scattered in the Byzantine levels. One is a half life-size female head of a style intermediate between the Pergamon Altar and the Venus of Milo. Also of the second century B.C. is a fragment of a male head with Corinthian helmet pushed back, strongly reminiscent of the Pergamon Altar. Since the back of the head is lost it is impossible to tell whether it belonged to a free standing sculpture or a relief. Right outside the excavation area was found on the surface part of a horse's head with neck, which must have belonged to one of the many horses on the upper cornice of the Altar. In the area of the Peristyle, built into the wall in the apse of the early Byzantine church, were found two parts of a single marble block with decoration of animals' heads and garlands. The right corner, carrying a ram's head, is preserved; the left part is broken away. This block probably formed part either of the base of the altar or of the socle of the cult-statue in the presumed cult-chamber of the Peristyle building. Six further pieces of the same monument were recovered in area 5060/42. If the socle stood in the 9-metre wide cult-chamber in the north-east of the Peristyle complex, the so-called "Pyrgos", there would have been no problem of space for it. There could well have been four loops of garlands with five heads-ram, bull, ram, bull, ram-making a total length of 3-60 m. Stylistic criteria suggest a date in the second half of the third century B.C. A very simple, small "Aeolic" capital (ht. 22 cm.) of andesite was found in the spoil of the excavation. Its unusual form resembles that of the Early Hellenistic capitals from the Propylon of the Demeter temple, though it is much cruder than these, and its proportions are more slender. The similar motives, however, suggest for it an Early Hellenistic date. B. Trajaneum Western Annex The sounding in WKB 3 made in 1982 was carried down to the bedrock. A further wall was uncovered that belongs to the building under the Trajaneum and runs up against the wall of the Empire period. It is to be connected with the Hellenistic structures better represented in vaults, west of the temple, which were excavated earlier and were finally clarified this year.</page><page sequence="35">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 209 Vault C The excavations of the previous year were extended to the south. The Hellenistic room which was partly exposed last year was completely excavated, including its south wall, and its connexion with the walls of the next terrace to the south was clarified. It seems probable that there was continuous building on this part of the site behind the city wall from Hellenistic into Imperial times. Rock workings in the south-east corner of vault C belong to a stepped alley-way similar to that in vault A a little further west. Vault M The arched passage from vault L eastwards into vault M had become blocked with concrete as part of an earlier restoration plan. This passage was opened up to facilitate a sounding across the vault, which brought the following results. When the Western Annex was built, vault M was designed as a stairway, which may have led into the Eastern Annex. It was about 80 cm. wide. The passage into vault L was closed by a door, which has left traces in the form of grooves behind the threshold. In late Classical or early Byzantine times the level of this passage was raised about 70 cm. Terminus post quem for this alteration is shown by coins to be the middle of the third century. Vault M was connected to this new floor-level, the stairway being torn down. A second fill in Vault M contained finds pointing to its renewed use in late Byzantine times. At the eastern end of this sounding under vault M remains of house walls running obliquely to the Trajaneum were again encountered. Sounding in the Stylobate of the East Portico A sounding down to bedrock was made in the area of the stylobate of the East Portico and immediately west of it, in order to clarify the nature of the foundations and the perimeter wall of the first phase of the Trajaneum before the re-erection of the columns. The usual oblique walls of earlier buildings were found, and in the northern sector a strong white-plastered terrace wall on the valley side and a damp- proof space against the hillside. Under the paving of the courtyard there was a massive packing of stones and cement, founded on the bedrock and obviously intended to prevent the subsidence of the stylobate. C. Outside the city On the east side of the citadel, in the valley of the Kestel Gay. bulldozers working on the construction of the Kestel dam uncovered part of the Roman aqueduct in the form of a vaulted tunnel driven through the rock and strengthened with ashlar walling and cement in places where the rock was split or otherwise insecure. SARDIS, 1984.' The 1984 field programme of the Sardis Expedition (jointly sponsored by the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University, Cornell University, the American Schools of Oriental Research, and the Corning Museum of Glass) included excavation, survey, and pre-publication study of monuments and artifacts exposed in earlier seasons. Excavation focused on two regions of the ancient city site where monumental buildings of the 7th and 6th centuries B.c. provide clues to the urban organization of Lydian Sardis. Two of the buildings are located near the Late Roman Synagogue. Of these the better preserved is "Colossal Lydian Structure" (an 'Information kindly contributed by Prof. Crawford H. Greenewalt, jr.</page><page sequence="36">210 ANATOLIAN STUDIES oblong building of solid construction ca. 20 m. wide at the base, over 70 m. long; standing to a height of 8 m.), whose size, form, and massive construction identify it as a defence work. Excavation in 1984 clarified aspects of the two long (east and west) sides of this Structure. At the south end both sides have vertical faces of stone and are encased by a mass of tumbled brick, both unburnt and burnt, that fell from the top of the Structure. At the north end, both sides have sloped faces, with stone socle and mudbrick superstructure. A puzzling feature at the north end of the west side is a pile made of clay and gravel layers that slope down and away from the core of the Structure. Some of these layers were built in segments, oriented approx- imately at right angles to the west side of the Structure. This pile was created in Lydian times; the possibility that it represents a siege mound has been considered. The north end of the east side, like the south side of the Structure, is encased by fallen brick, which extends 18 m. out from the face and covers nearby Lydian buildings in a thick layer. This layer is an important stratum: a "sealer,"unmistak- able and considerable in the archaeological record, that preserved building architecture (notably mudbrick walls) and artifact assemblages beneath from subsequent deterioration and contamination. Excavation in 1984 uncovered part of a Lydian domestic unit (separated from the Colossal Structure by an alley and a narrow wall) sealed by this layer. The floor of one room or court of the unit yielded 75-100 ceramic and metal artifacts associated with illumination (lamps), textiles (loomweights, spindle whorl), cosmetics (lekythoi, lydions), and food and drink: cooking stand, cooking pots, bread tray, strainer, grater, amphorae, column craters, pitchers, bowl, cups (skyphoi), and dishes (mostly stemmed) as well as carbonized grain (wheat, barley), legumes (lentils, chickpeas), and garlic. Two of the cups are imports from Athens: a Komast cup (attributed by N. H. Ramage and N. D. Cahill to the Vienna Komast Painter) and a Little Master skyphos. Both may be dated to the middle years of the 6th century B.C., and are chronologically consistent with a C'4 dating of 570 B.C. + 50 years for the carbonized grain; and with fragments of a Little Master cup and Fikellura amphora (the latter assigned by G. P. Schaus to R. M. Cook's Lion Group) that were recovered from the fallen brick layer in the earlier seasons. This evidence suggests that Colossal Lydian Structure and the nearby domestic unit were destroyed at about the time Sardis and Croesus's Lydian empire fell to the Persians (an event traditionally dated 547 B.C.). The other monumental Lydian building near the Late Roman Synagogue may have been a terrace platform or part of a gate. Traced so far is a zig-zag facade of handsome ashlar masonry that extends over a distance of 40 m. and revets a core at least 11 m. thick. Excavation in 1984 traced the facade of the building in a northerly direction for 10 m. (included in the figure above), recovered context pottery that should date the construction of the building ca. 600-500 B.C., and exposed a 12 m.-long segment of facade between two corners that is inscribed with ca. 45 "masons' marks": one or two per block and consisting of 9 different signs, some like letters of local epichoric alphabets. The other region of Sardis that was a focus of excavation in 1984 is a spur of the Acropolis in the northeast part of the site. Excavation in 1983 had shown that Lydian terrace construction, faced with handsome ashlar masonry in white limestone, enveloped the outer end of this spur. Excavation in 1984 established the extent of the terrace facade for another 25 m. and revealed a total number of 5 masonry courses in situ on the east side of the spur. Above the Lydian construction are Roman terraced buildings, some decorated with handsome and well-preserved wall revetment and floor paving in opus sectile and mosaic. These buildings must have been residential units or small public facilities. The cistern of one eventually was remodelled to be a lime kiln.</page><page sequence="37">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 211 A side show of the season was re-excavation of a Lydian chamber tomb, first excavated by H. C. Butler's Expedition in 1912. The purpose of this effort was to record unique architectural features that had not been adequately recorded before: a stone staircase flanked by a pair of tall stelai (with palmette anthemia) at the grave entrance. These features had become buried by erosion after 1912 and survived unchanged (the stelai still in situ). Re-excavation showed that the plan of the tomb differs significantly from that in the published drawing, and exposed two features outside the tomb entrance that evidently had been missed by the original excavators: a small terracotta sarcophagus and a well-preserved human skeleton (with head to the north, in informal position: on one side with legs bent, one hand over heart, the other over groin). Two noteworthy inscriptions on stone were recovered by chance on and near the city site. One is a grave stele made and inscribed in Greek for a Mysian in the late 4th or early 3rd century B.C., later inscribed with a funeral text in Lydian (5 lines) for another person. The other is a marble altar-shaped monument of Roman times, inscribed in Greek with two honorific texts that record an otherwise unknown family (Lachanas) and cult (Demeter Karpophoros) of Sardis; one of the honorands in this inscription was both a priestess of Demeter and a kaueis, i.e., a Lydian term for priestess associated at Sardis with the cult of Artemis. The regional survey project that the Sardis Expedition shares with Dog. Dr. Recep Meriq of Ninth of September University, Bornova-Izmir, produced, under Dr. Meri9's direction, information about several little-known or unknown sites and monuments in the region to the north and northeast of Sardis: 7 settlement sites, 5 tumulus graves (all recently exposed in illicit excavation; one with finely carved and painted kline, another evidently with a tile roof laid over the burial chamber but within the earth and stone fill of the mound), 20 Greek inscriptions on stone. UNDER WATER ARCHAEOLOGY, 1984.' Ulu Burun (Kay) The Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) began excavation of the Ulu Burun shipwreck in July and August, with staff drawn from INA, the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, and Texas A&amp;M University; the campaign was financed by the Board of Directors of INA, assisted by a grant from the National Geographic Society. Work was conducted from INA's vessel Virazon, moored semi-permanently over the wreck, less than a hundred metres off shore. A support camp, primarily for field conservation, study and storage of artifacts, also housed staff on the cliff against which the Late Bronze Age ship probably was dashed by a south wind. Over one thousand dives were made on the shallower end of the site, 145 to 160 feet deep, where copper "ox-hide" ingots lay exposed in neat rows. Beneath the sand were found tin ingots as well, some cast in the same "ox-hide" shape. Excavation also revealed dozens of Canaanite amphoras (whose contents included olive pits, grape seeds, pitch, glass beads, and orpiment or yellow arsenic), and nearly two dozen dark-blue, discoid glass ingots, approx. 15 cm. in diameter and 5 to 7 cm. thick. Cemal Pulak's plan of the site suggests a ship perhaps 20 metres in length, carrying at least 150 copper "ox-hide" ingots. A single small concentration of finds included a hippopotamus tusk, part of an elephant tusk, a gold chalice, a gold 'Information kindly provided by Professor George F. Bass.</page><page sequence="38">212 ANATOLIAN STUDIES pectoral in the shape of a falcon clutching cobras, a Mycenaean kylix, a Syrian pilgrim flask, amber and faience beads, a Canaanite amphora filled with glass beads, and a bronze sword. Elsewhere was a round medallion of gold foil next to a Mycenaean stirrup-jar. Other bronze weapons included bronze spear heads and daggers; the latter find their closest parallels at the Canaanite site of Tell el-Ajjul. We tentatively date the wreck to the Late Helladic IIIA:2 period, in the first half of the fourteenth century B.C., on the basis of the Mycenaean kylix and stirrup- jar. One of more than a half dozen pithoi on the wreck contained apparently new Cypriot pottery of the types commonly exported to the Syro-Palestinian coast: Bucchero Ware, White-shaved Ware, White-slip milk bowls, and Base-Ring II ware, as well as saucer-shaped lamps of Near Eastern type; contents of the other pithoi remain unknown. Objects of stone include four haematite balance-scale weights, a mace head, and a tray. Parts of at least two faience animal heads also have been found, one of them very like a ram's head rhyton from Cyprus; such rhyta, however, may be as much at home in the Near East as on Cyprus. Other finds include lead fishing weights and bronze tools, the latter including an axe, a chisel and an adze. Six stone anchors lying in a row across the wreck are similar to those found frequently at Ugarit and Byblos, as well as at Kition on Cyprus, frequently built into the walls of temples, perhaps as votive offerings of seamen. A small area of the ship's hull was revealed beneath ballast stones. The ship's planks were edge-joined with mortise-and-tenon joints held fast with wooden pegs, a joining system much like that of the Kyrenia ship of a millennium later. Keel and planks are of fir; tenons and pegs are of a hard wood, perhaps oak. With weapons, Canaanite amphoras, gold jewellery, ivory, stone anchors, and probably glass and tin coming from the Near East, and with its copper probably originating on neighbouring Cyprus, it might seem that the Ka? ship was a Near Eastern merchant vessel. A small lentoid seal, of the type worn on Aegean merchants' wrists, however, finds its best parallel at Mycenaean Krissa, suggesting at least the presence of a Mycenaean merchant on board. It is estimated that at least five additional summers will be needed to complete the excavation of the ship. Underwater Surveys' During the autumn of 1984, the Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) completed another in a series of underwater surveys that have become annual events since 1980. These surveys are conducted to investigate reports of ceramic deposits sighted by Turkish sponge divers and to search in areas that may have been hazardous sailing grounds for ships of antiquity. The main purposes of the surveys are to assist the Turkish government in identifying and protecting potentially significant underwater sites and to add to INA's growing list of ancient shipwrecks located in Turkish water. During the 1984 season, two separate surveys were carried out along the southern and northwestern coasts of Turkey. Investigations made during the first survey, extending in range from Kag to Giilliik Korfezi (north of Bodrum), revealed the presence of 5 shipwrecks. Dates of these wrecks vary from the 4th century B.C. to the 12th century A.D. Perhaps the 'Report by Mr. Cemal Pulak.</page><page sequence="39">RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN TURKEY 213 most significant discovery is that of a 10th- or 11 th-century A.D. wreck with a cargo of scrap glass. This site is especially exciting due to its close proximity (only 30 km) to Serqe Limani where an 11 th-century wreck also carrying a cargo of scrap glass was excavated by INA between 1977 and 1979 The second survey was devoted mainly to the investigation of sites around the town of Erdek and the island of Marmara in the Sea of Marmara, although an extension was made to istanbul to investigate a report filed the previous year. Seven shipwrecks were located and investigated during the brief survey period. The dates of the wrecks are from the late 4th or early 3rd century B.C. to the 18th century A.D. The best preserved and at the same time one of the most important finds is that of a merchantman laden with a cargo of amphoras of northern or Black Sea origin, perhaps from Chersonesos. The wreck, located near istanbul, and about 1-5 miles from the nearest shore, lies virtually undisturbed at a depth of 33 metres. Several hundred exposed amphoras and two large pithoi mark the site. Because the seabed is of soft, silty consistency, the chances for good hull preservation are excellent. A second wreck of about the same date was discovered near Erdek. Unfortunately, the site is located in an area where ships dredge sand used in construction work. As a result, a large section of the ship's hull has been totally destroyed and the disappearance of the remaining hull is imminent. Parts of the wooden hull along with material such as a wooden sheave block, hawser fragments and other organic remains in an excellent state of preservation, lay totally denuded of their protective sand covering. The site has been badly looted through the years and virtually every complete amphora has been removed. A full day was spent in covering the exposed part of the wreck with sand for protection. The seabed, however, defaced by dredging, is extremely susceptible to bottom currents and the re-exposure of the timbers seems only a matter of time. The Directorate of Antiquities and Museums has been notified of the importance of the site and also has been advised to take immediate action against future dredging. The Serge Limani Hull' The waterlogged wooden hull fragments of the I Ith-century Serqe Limani "Glass Wreck", excavated by the Institute of Nautical Archaeology between 1977 and 1979, have been fully conserved after a three-year treatment in polyethylene glycol. Over 600 fragments have been removed from the treatment vats and are in the process of being cleaned for the reconstruction of the hull in the new gallery built in the inner court of the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology. To date, the keel and certain frames of the bow and midships sections have been assembled. Other work on the Serge Limamn ship involves the continued mending of glass vessels and the epoxy casting of iron artifacts in their natural moulds of seabed concretion; all seven iron anchors found on the wreck have been fully replicated by this process. XANTHOS, 19842 Work on the site of the Letoon was resumed in 1984 after a year of interruption. An extension of the depot rendered necessary by several years' accumulation of material was constructed and improvements were made to the building erected in 1967 and to the depot at Xanthos. In the course of the work two 'Report by Mr. Cemal Pulak. 2Translated from information kindly provided by M.

The grave furniture consisted mainly of glass bottles and terracotta figurines, among them a Fortuna holding a cornucopia and a rudder. Traces of tombs had been noted by E. Kalinka and E. Krickl in 1892 on the side of the hill that overhangs the sanctuary; this observation is now confirmed. The presence of a small cemetery implies a settlement near the sanctuary, but probably not a large one. Actual excavations centred on the western entrance to the sanctuary at the end of the paved road uncovered in 1979 and 1981. A pre-Hellenistic building was identified, probably of the fourth century B.C., which was succeeded by a Hellenistic propylon, and then, in the first century of our era, by a monumental gateway in three bays separated by oblong columns. In the third century of our era a final reconstruction was carried out in order to alleviate the rise of the water level and the alluvium. The floor level was raised and the stone walls were replaced by brick structures. Several interesting inscriptions came to light, notably: a mutilated base of the third century A.D. erected in honour of a worthy who had given a subvention to the "panegyric of the people and the town", i.e. the great annual festival at which the whole Lycian ethnos assembled in the theatre of the Letoon; a decree from the end of the Hellenistic epoch assigning to the benefactor of the sanctuary a bronze statue and part of the thigh of the animals sacrificed: and a stela of the end of the third or the beginning of the second century B.C. specifying conditions to be fulfilled by anyone wishing to enter the sanctuary. This "sacred law" forbids the carrying of arms, the wearing of brooches, certain hair styles (petasus and kausia), gilded rings and in general any richly ornamented apparel; only simple tunics and shoes are admissible. Anyone not offering a sacrifice is forbidden to spend the night under the porticoes of the sanctuary. This document, short but compact, includes clauses hitherto unknown among religious laws and is of great interest to the history of the sanctuary.</page></plain_text>
