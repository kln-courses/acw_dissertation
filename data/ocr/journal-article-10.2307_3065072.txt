Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989 (original Italian edition, Edizioni di Torino, 1979). ?14.50. In 1979 Comotti's La Musica nella cultura greca e romana was issued as the first in a proposed sequence of volumes making up a comprehensive history of music for the Societa Italiana di Musicologia. This new English version is said to be 'revised and expanded', taking into account, for example, the Euripides Iph. Aul. musical fragment subsequently published. In scope, it bears a certain resemblance to the notable Reinach La Musique Grecque, and later synoptic studies of Greek music by Chailley and Neubecker, but being aimed at the non-specialist reader, its general orientation is more historical and sociological than technical, although there is a chapter of some twenty-five pages on 'music theory' which deals with the notoriously difficult questions of ratios, scales, the harmoniai and tonoi, etc. The space allotted specifically to Roman music is quite small. The historical survey, with much attention paid to the lyric poets, the early prominence of Sparta, the innovations associated with Terpander, Lasus, Timotheus, Euripides, the ethical views of Damon, and the nature of the chief musical instruments, is perhaps the best part of the book, and will chiefly engage the non-specialist, although it could hardly be claimed to offer new insights into what for classicists is very familiar territory. I am doubtful however what the layman will derive from the chapter devoted to 'texts with musical notation', of which two texts only are printed, and the other twenty or so described with a list of notes used in the extant portions, along with rhythmical notation when present, especially as not all the technical terms used (e.g. paroemiac, lecythion) appear to be defined for the uninitiated in the text, nor in the rather scrappy glossary. Incidentally, in P Oslo 1413 (no. 12 in Comotti) it is, of course, Deidameia, not Deianira(!) to whom Achilles' ghost appears. As with the Italian original, the book ends with a series of translated passages, from the Homeric Hermes Hymn, Pherecrates, Plato and Aristotle, the anti-ethical Hibeh rhetorical fragment and Aristoxenus, alongside which the single Roman offering, a passage of Aulus Gellius, sits rather awkwardly. As the translations are taken from standard English sources, such as Jowett and the Loeb Classics, aulos is regularly rendered 'flute', contrary to C.'s own commendable objection to this erroneous, and misleading, translation (p. 68). 'Kettledrum', by the way, is hardly the appropriate translation of the Greek tympanon. One hopes that the author bears no responsibility for the lamentable state of the index, which is full of misprinted proper names and technical terms. Some of these are found also in the body of the text - Alcybiades, Lybia, skidnapsos, proimia, prosodoi (for prosodia), enkrousis and enkrousmos (for ek-), chronus protos, but added to these, we find Dionysus of Halicarnassus, Threon of Smyrna, Pratinas of Philius, Thamrys, Taletas, Lemenius, Menachemus, Atelanae, the Isagogue of Alypius, the enlopian metre, hypochoremata, the Lydian idos, lyrophonikion, dexios cheiros, anestremmenon (for -stramm-) but epestrammenon (for ap-). There are separate entries for Athanaeus and Athenaeus, simikeion and simikion, and other such silly duplications. The mysterious tetheamenos an eipoimi seems to have crept in on the assumption that anything italicized in the text must be worth indexing. 'Gent. fragment' simply merits its curious entry because C. has cited a line of Anacreon from Gentili's edition of the poet! Surely someone in a university press could have cleaned up all these (and others) before printing. University of Edinburgh E.

Pp. 120; 60 figs.; 20 tables. Uppsala: Almqvist and Wiksell distributors, 1989. Paper. A.'s field of study is the anthropomorphic figurines of various materials (principally bronze and terracotta) which were dedicated in some twenty Greek sanctuaries between the geometric and classical periods. She sets out to ask two questions of her material: firstly, did the cult-image of the sanctuary have any influence on the appearance of the figurines, and secondly, when figurines of other 'visiting' gods are offered to the cult deity, is there any significance in who visits whom? 0009-840X/90 $3.00 ?
