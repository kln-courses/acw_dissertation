<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERDER'S " URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE " In 1769 the Berlin Academy gave out as the subject of a com- petitive prize essay the following, couched, as was customary, in French: "En supposant les hommes abandonn6s &amp; leurs facult6s naturelles, sont ils en 6tat d'inventer le langage? et par quels moyens parviendront-ils d'eux-momes A cette invention?" There are two points in the wording of this theme which are interesting and characteristic of the time. In the first place, it will be noticed that the pivot of the discussion was to be this: whether language was of natural-i. e., human-or supernatural origin. It could by no means be taken for granted then, as normal in- vestigators would nowadays, that the gift of speech was acquired by man in a purely normal way; the burden of proof, in fact, lay upon those who disputed the divine origin of language. In the second place, the query of the academy speaks of language as an "invention." Just as a machine is a tool, a means for bringing about certain desired mechanical effects, so language was looked upon as a tool, a means for bringing about certain other desired mechanical effects-namely: the communication of ideas by means of audible, secondarily by means of visible, sym- bols. And since history and experience showed, or seemed to show, that machines were "invented" by the application of cer- tain powers of intelligence, the logic of parallelism seemed to require that also that most admirable tool called language should have been the "invention" of some intelligence. The only ques- tion, then, was this: Was the human mind intelligent and resourceful enough to invent so fine a machine, or did the latter require the master-hand of the Deity? Voil" tout. The attitude of a modern linguist toward the proposed subject is certainly very different from that of the eighteenth-century philosopher. To the first half of the question he would unhesi- tatingly answer "Yes;" to the second he would reply: "Language was not invented in any true sense at all;" or, as Topsy would 109] 1 [MODERN PHILOLOGY, July, 1907</page><page sequence="2">2 EDWARD SAPIR put it: "It wasn't born, it growed." It is in these two points, after all, that the chief progress from the older to the modern view of the question lies; and for both of them, the doing away with the conception of divine interference, and the introduction of the idea of slow, but gradual and necessary, development from rude beginnings, we are very largely indebted to Herder. The very answer that Herder gave to the question posed made the question itself meaningless; henceforth there could be no serious and profitable discussion of the divine origin of language, while the crude conception of the "invention" of a language had to give way more and more to that of the unconscious, or, as we should perhaps say now, largely subconscious, development of speech by virtue of man's psychic powers. The question resolved itself into another: Just what factor or factors were most promi- nent in that exceedingly slow process of mental evolution that transformed a being giving vent to his emotions in inarticulate cries to one giving expression to a rich mental life by an elaborate system of auditory symbols? Despite the vast accumulation of linguistic material that has been collected since Herder's time, and the immense clarification that has been attained in linguistic conceptions, processes, and classifications, we cannot today make bold to assert that this problem is satisfactorily answered, or apparently in a way to be satisfactorily answered in the immediate future. Bearing this in mind, we shall be able more justly to value the great service Herder accomplished in merely shifting the point of view. That alone was an inestimable service. It was to be expected that the proposed subject should appeal strongly to a mind of Herder's stamp, occupied, as it was, with problems touching the most important phases of human culture. We thus find him, while still in Nantes, writing to his publisher- friend Hartknoch that he was intending to work up the theme the following year. He speaks of it as "eine vortreffliche, grosse und wahrhaftig philosophische Frage, die recht ffir mich gegeben zu sein scheint."' The latest time at which the competing essays could be handed in was January 1, 1771; yet Herder did not set to work at the actual composition of his treatise until well on in 1 R. Haym, Herder nach seinem Leben und seinen Werken dargestellt, Vol. I, pp. 400-403. 110</page><page sequence="3">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 3 December, 1770, when his Strassburg period was drawing to a close. To excuse the peculiar defects of it, he wrote to Nicolai early in 1772 that it was written "fluichtig, in Eile, in den letzten Tagen des Decembers."' So rapidly, indeed, was this 166-page2 essay composed that it was finished even before Christmas and was sent away anonymously, with accompanying billet, to Tourney, the secretary of the academy. This almost incredible rapidity of composition can be explained only by assuming, as we have every reason to do, that Herder had thought out the whole problem in considerable detail long before, or, as Suphan suggests, even made the first rough draft3 at Nantes, and had now simply to mold these ideas into literary form. Although few would ven- ture to call the Preisschrift a model of literary form, yet the dis- tinctness of the theme and the short time in which it had to be got ready give the treatise "a directness and ease that is too often wanting in his other works."' In few other subjects had Herder been so deeply interested up to 1771 as in this one concerning the origin and development of language. As early as 1764, according to Suphan, he had drawn up a plan for the somewhat elaborate investigation of the origin of language, writing, and grammar. One of his contributions to the Riga Gelehrte Anzei- gen dealt with the problem, "Wie weit alte und neue, fremde und die Muttersprache unsern Fleiss verdienen"-an essay that anticipates some of the striking phrases found in the Preisschrift. In his first important work, the famous Fragmente, Herder had already given expression to some of his later thoughts, among other things maintaining the human origin of language. When Sitssmilch's Beweis, dass die Sprache gottlich sei, which had been read at the Berlin Academy ten years before publication, appeared in 1766, Herder was deeply interested, and wrote to Scheffner (October 31, 1767): "Da Stissmilch sich in die Sprach- hypothese neulich gemischt und es mit Rousseau gegen Moses [i. e., Moses Mendelssohn] aufgenommen, so hatte ich wohl Lust, I Haym, op. cit. 2As contained in Herder's Collected Works, edited by Johann von Maller (Carlsruho, 1820). 3 Distinguished by Suphan as "a."

With what had been said on the subject by Rousseau, Condillac, Abbt, Lam- bert, and others, Herder was well acquainted, so that his own Preisschrift, while in every sense a pathfinding work, takes a definite historically conditioned place in the linguistic-philosophic speculations of the eighteenth century. Before proceeding with the detailed analysis of Herder's epoch-making work, we must briefly consider the theories on the origin of language which prevailed at the time he wrote it. By far the most commonly held theory, at least in Germany, was that supported by Siissmilch, the orthodox view. According to this, language was given or revealed to man by God. The power to create the subtle mechanism of speech was considered by the supporters of this theory beyond the earliest human beings; they had to receive the first rude concept of language, the first fruitful suggestions, at least, from without. In earlier stages of linguis- tic speculation, particularly at the time of the Reformation, it was believed, on inferred biblical evidence, that this earliest God- made language was the Hebrew tongue, from which all other idioms, the Greek and Latin as well as the Chinese, were derived by processes of corruption, transposition of letters, or what not. In Herder's day, however, it was no longer considered necessary by all supporters of the orthodox view to maintain the absolute primitiveness of Hebrew, although Hebrew was regarded, among others by Herder himself, as a peculiarly primitive or "original" language. Many deemed it sufficient to assert the revelation to man of some form, however imperfect, of speech, and were willing to concede the possibly somewhat late advent of the Holy Tongue. We can easily understand some of the reasons that led to the sup- port of this, it is needless to say, now wholly antiquated view. In the first place, scriptural evidence, in general, seemed to imply the divine origin of language; although we are told that the Lord brought the various denizens of the field and forest before Adam, that he might give them names, still this appears to have been done under careful paternal supervision. In the second place, there was good, in fact irrefutable, evidence, from an orthodox I See Haym, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 402. 112</page><page sequence="5">HERDER'S " URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 5 point of view, for the divine authorship of the industries; and it seemed illogical to suppose that a much higher factor of civiliza- tion than the industries, namely language, had been left to the ingenuity of primitive man. In the third place, the less than six thousand years which had elapsed since the creation of the world were looked upon, and with good reason, as quite inadequate for the development from the crudest possible beginnings of our modern, richly organized languages. Even long after Herder had demonstrated the untenableness of the orthodox theory, many scholars still clung to a view which made God, as Goethe put it, "a kind of omnipotent schoolmaster." I note, by way of illus- tration, that our Noah Webster still considered it the most prob- able explanation. From a psychological point of view, granting the possibility of revelation, the theory is, of course, absolutely useless. Its advocates do not seem to have perceived that the imparting of a language to the first speechless human beings, accompanied, as it presumably was, by grammatical instruction, must have been a fairly impossible task, implying, in fact, lin- guistic training in the recipient; moreover, the theory begged the question, by assuming the existence of what it set out to explain. The modern critical standpoint has been well, if somewhat cyni- cally, formulated by Fritz Mauthner in his entertaining Kritik der Sprache: Wir wissen kaum, was der abstrakte Begriff Sprache bedeutet, wir wissen noch weniger, wie wir den Begriff Ursprung zeitlich begrenzen sollen, wir wissen gar nicht mehr den Gottesbegriff zu definieren; da kbnnen wir mit dem "gottlichen Ursprung der Sprache" wirklich nicht mehr viel anfangen.1 A second theory, supported notably by Rousseau and the German Rationalists, was very similar in character to the contract- theory of the origin of government, also held by Rousseau. They conceived the matter approximately thus: Primitive men, after having long been compelled to get along without speech, at last awoke to a consciousness of the manifold inconveniences of their then condition; were in particular troubled by the important problem of communicating ideas. To remedy, if possible, this 1 Fritz Mauthner, Kritikl der Sprache, Vol. II, " Zur Sprachwissenschaft," p. 353. 113</page><page sequence="6">6 EDWARD SAPIR deplorable state of affairs, our primitive ancestors, or perhaps only the wisest of them, put their heads together to devise ways and means for the more practicable interchange of thoughts. After much cogitation-not deliberation, for language was not as yet-they hit upon the excellent device of representing things and actions to each other by means of arbitrarily chosen symbols, presumably auditory. Henceforth they had no difficulty in under- standing each other, civilization progressed more rapidly than heretofore, and all was well. One is amazed to find that men in the eighteenth century were willing to maintain so ridiculous a theory, even if not presented in quite so absurd a light as above. It is not difficult to point out the vicious circle implied therein. Man could not conceivably have advanced so far as to perceive the advantages of speech as a means of communication without already being possessed of it; on the other hand, if primitive man could already successfully communicate such abstract ideas as those of symbols, one fails to see the necessity of a change in method. A far more valuable theory than these two was that held by the English and French "naturalists," though a crude, mechan- istic psychology makes their speculations often seem rather infan- tile today. The "naturalists," generally speaking, were inclined to look upon language as a reflex, expressed in cries, of the sen- sations and perceptions imprinted upon the human mind by man's environment. They considered the growth of a vocabulary abso- lutely co-ordinated with the growth of experience, and were pretty sure, most of them, that untaught children, if isolated from the companionship of their fellow-beings, would develop a language of their own. Condillac, probably the most profound of the philosophes, attempted in his Essai sur l'origine des connais- sances humaines to show how two human beings of opposite sex might naturally be led to acquire speech. He supposes that at the outset all their desires and emotions are expressed by purely instinctive cries, accompanied by violent gestures. By the psychic processes of memory and association these cries gradually come to serve as the fixed means of communicating the more ele- mentary feelings, such as fear, joy, and the like. Says Condillac: 114</page><page sequence="7">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 7 Meanwhile, while these human beings have acquired the habit of associating several ideas with arbitrary signs, the natural cries served them as model to make a new language. They articulated new sounds and, repeating them several times and accompanying them by some gesture which indicated the objects they wished to call attention to, they accustomed themselves to giving names to things. At first the progress of this language was extremely slow. The organ of speech was so inflex- ible that it could articulate only a few very simple sounds. The obstacles that presented themselves in pronouncing others even prevented them from suspecting that the voice was capable of moving beyond the small number of words they had imagined. This pair had a child, who, pressed by wants that he could give expression to only with difficulty, violently moved all the limbs of his body. His very flexible tongue curled itself in an extraordinary manner and pronounced an entirely new word. The want, still continuing, again gave rise to the same effects; this child moved his tongue as before, and again articulated the same sound. The surprised parents, having finally guessed what he wished, attempted, while giving it to him, to repeat the same word. The difficulty they had in pronouncing it made it evident that they would not of themselves have been able to invent it.' In such wise Condillac thinks their language would be slowly and painfully enriched; not until after many generations would a language in our sense be approximated. A fairly ingenious theory, and much to be preferred to either the orthodox or the rationalist views, yet not truly convincing. The great difficulty that Herder found with it was the failure to draw a sharp line between the instincts of the animals and the higher mental powers of man. One does not clearly see why, according to Condillac, the animals should not have likewise developed a language. Herder, although he inclined on the whole to the views of the French "naturalists," attempted to avoid their shallow mechan- istic psychology, and was chiefly concerned in showing that the peculiarly human faculty of speech was a necessary correlative of certain distinctly human psychic conditions. The analysis of Herder's views here given is based, not on the second edition of the prize essay (Berlin, 1789), but on its first published form (Berlin, 1772), as given in Suphan's edition of Herder. Following the formulation of the academy's theme, he divided his treatise into two parts, the first answering the ques- 1 (Euvres de Condillac (Paris, 1798), Vol. I, pp. 264, 265. 115</page><page sequence="8">8 EDWARD SAPIR tion: "Haben die Menschen, ihren Naturfahigkeiten iiberlassen, sich selbst Sprache erfinden k6nnen?"' the second dealing with the problem: "Auf welchem Wege der Mensch sich am fiiglich- sten hat Sprache erfinden k6nnen und mtissen ?'2 Herder begins his treatise with the postulation of a "natural law." All the higher animals involuntarily respond to their emo- tions, particularly the more intense ones, such as pain, by cries. As Herder formulates the "law": "Here is a sentient being, unable to inclose within itself any of its intense feelings; which, in the first moment of surprise, must give expression in sound to every feeling, even without intention and purpose."' But this sentient being is not an isolated phenomenon. There are other beings, besides itself, similarly constituted, that respond to like stimuli in the same way. Hence the instinctive cries of each sen- tient being find a responsive echo in other beings of like organ- ism, very much as a vibrating string will cause other strings to vibrate that are pitched in harmony to itself. These tones con- stitute a species of language, "a language of feeling" directly given by nature (unmittelbares Naturgesetz); its genesis it does not occur to Herder to explain. Such natural cries are not peculiar to the animals, but are shared also by man. No matter how highly developed a language may be, it always includes a number of vocables that are intelligible per se as emotional expres- sions. These are represented on paper-with miserable inade- quacy, as Herder strongly emphasizes-by the interjections (such as ach, 0, and so forth); their real existence, however, is in their utterance in the appropriate emotional milieu. It is true that in our modern, metaphysically refined idioms, these emo- tional elements play a very subordinate role, but in the older oriental and in the primitive tongues Herder thinks to find more numerous survivals of the earliest linguistic conditions. It may be noted that all through the essay Herder, quite uncritically from our modern point of view, considers the oriental, by which he means one or two Semitic, dialects and the languages of primi- 1Herder's Sdmmtliche Werke, herausgegeben von Bernhard Suphan (Berlin, 1891)., Vol. V, p. 3. 2 Ibid., p. 91. 3Ibid., p. 6. 116</page><page sequence="9">HERDER'S " URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE " 9 tive peoples as essentially more "original" than our modern ver- naculars. We should never forget that Herder's time-perspective was necessarily very different from ours. While we unconcern- edly take tens and even hundreds of thousands of years in which to allow the products of human civilization to develop, Herder was still compelled to operate with the less than six thousand years that orthodoxy stingily doled out. To us the two or three thousand years that separate our languages from the Old Testa- ment Hebrew seems a negligible quantity, when speculating on the origin of language in general; to Herder, however, the Hebrew and the Greek of Homer seemed to be appreciably nearer the oldest conditions than our vernaculars-hence his exaggeration of their Urspriinglichkeit. The supposedly "primitive," or rather "original," character of the languages of savages was due to a very natural, though, unfortunately, on the whole erroneous, con- clusion from a priori considerations. Herder next proceeds to take up and refute one of Suissmilch's arguments for believing that language is God's direct work. Sfissmilch contended that it was evident in the alphabetic uni- formity of all languages, pointing to an original divine simplicity; all the sounds found in the multiform idioms of the earth, he thought, could be adequately represented by about twenty letters. This queer argument Herder conclusively showed to be a mere orthographic quibble. It is a huge fallacy, as Herder clearly saw, to imagine that even one language could be perfectly repre- sented by an alphabet at all, let alone one of twenty letters. He recognizes, apparently as clearly as any modern linguist, that the real elements of language are spoken sounds of which letters are but makeshift and imperfect substitutions. He quotes from trav- elers as to the extreme difficulty of representing many of the dialects of primitive peoples through the medium of our letters; but he calls attention also to the very faint idea that one gets of even spoken English and French from the written forms of those languages. That a comparatively "original" language (I speak in Herder's terms) like the Hebrew did not orthographically rep- resent the vowels is due, he thinks, to their finely modulated, natural, almost unarticulated character. "Ihre Ausprache war so 117</page><page sequence="10">10 EDWARD SAPIR lebendig und feinorganisiert, ihr Hauch war so geistig und athemisch, dass er verduftete und sich nicht in Buchstaben fassen liess."' Hence he concludes that the nearer a language comes to the original conditions, the less possible to mirror it in ortho- graphical symbols. After this digression on the Slissmilch argument, Herder returns to a consideration of the natural emotional sounds of man and the animals: he emphasizes the great influence that these still have emotionally, and sees in them the closest bond of union between the various members of animated creation. "Their origin," Herder declares, "I consider very natural. It is not only not superhuman, but evidently beastlike (thierisch), the natural law of a machine capable of feeling."2' But-and here comes a critical point in Herder's argument -it is impossible to explain the origin of human language from these emotional cries. All animals, down to the dumb fish, give vent to their feelings in tones; but no animal, not even the most perfect, has on that account the slightest genuine disposition toward a human language. Let one form and refine and fix this natural cry as one will; if no understanding is present, so as purposely to use the tone, I fail to see how human, conscious lan- guage is ever going to arise. Children utter emotional sounds, like ani- mals: is not the language, however, that they learn from men quite another idiom ? 3 All writers, notably Condillac and Maupertuis among the French philosophes, and Diodorus and Vitruvius among the ancients, that have attempted to derive human speech from instinctive animal cries, are, then, on the wrong path at the very outset of their investigations. Since, among all living beings, man alone has developed a language, in the ordinary sense of the word, and since it is, after all, this power of speech which chiefly separates man from the animals, any rational attempt to explain its origin would have to begin with a consideration of the essen- tial psychic differences between the two. Herder, consequently, proceeds to seek for the most fundamental of these psychic dif- ferences, and finds it in this, "that man is far inferior to the animals in strength and sureness of instinct; indeed, that he lacks 1 Herder, op. cit., p. 13. 2 Ibid., p. 17. 3 Ibid., pp. 17, 18. 118</page><page sequence="11">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE " 11 entirely what in so many animal species we term inborn art- capabilities or impulses (Kunstfahigkeiten und Kunsttriebe)."' This inferiority in instinctive power Herder ascribes to a greater sphere of attention and activity on the part of man. Herder finds by observation "that the sharper the senses of the animals, and the more wonderful their works of art, the narrower their sphere, the more uniform their art-work;"2 and inversely, "the more scattered their attention to various objects, the more unde- fined their mode of life, in short, the larger and more manifold their sphere, the more do we see their sense-powers divided and weakened."3 Now all instincts, even such complicated ones as those we see manifested in the construction of beehives and spider- webs, are to be explained by the intense, specialized activities of the senses within a narrow sphere. Hence Herder feels justified in assuming that intensity of the senses and perfection of instinct are in inverse proportion to the amplitude of the sphere of atten- tion. Since man has the widest possible sphere, is the least specialized of all creatures in his activity, it follows that he is least endowed with inborn mechanical dispositions; in other words, is at birth apparently the most helpless of all living beings. It is inconceivable, however, that nature should have acted in so stepmotherly a fashion as to intend man for the widest field of activity, and at the same time fail to grant him powers successfully to maintain himself in his complex environment. There must be some psychic element which secures him his due position in the world; if we succeed in discovering this psychic element, we shall also have obtained the distinctive characteristic of man; and if, furthermore, we can show the human faculty of speech to be a resultant of this mental characteristic, our problem is practically solved. The peculiarly human characteristic sought is conditioned by the wide range of attention; for this latter implies that the human senses, unrestricted to any narrowly specialized field, are left free for development and the acquisition of clearer impressions. Now, this clearness of view leads to what is variously termed understanding, reason, judgment. Herder, who is alone to be held responsible for the psychology of all this, I Op. cit., p. 22. Ibid., p. 22. 3Ibid., p. 23. 119</page><page sequence="12">12 EDWARD SAPIR is indifferent about the name applied (he himself suggests Beson- nenheit, "reflection"); he very strongly emphasizes, however, that this Besonnenheit is not a faculty superimposed upon the lower animal mind-elements and transforming them into the human mind, but rather a certain disposition or aspect of the really unanalyzable unity called the "mind." It is truly refreshing to find Herder, in the age of neatly pigeon-holed faculties, boldly asserting these to be but more or less convenient abstractions; to Herder the human "mind" is an indivisible entity, in no wise genetically related to the animal mind. As he expresses it: "Der Unterschied (zwischen der menschlichen und der tierischen Seele) ist nicht in Stufen, oder Zugabe von Kraften, sondern in einer ganz verschiedenartigen Richtung und Auswickelung aller Kriifte."' Furthermore, Besonnenheit must have been present in the human race from the very start, must have been implanted in it by the Creator; although this, of course, does not mean that it is not capable of growth with the increase of experience. Any attempt, then, to bridge over the gulf separating man and the animal world is to Herder absurd. Does not reflection or Besonnenheit, however, imply the inven- tion - or, better, genesis--of language ? Herder proceeds: [Der Mensch] beweiset Reflexion, wenn er aus dem ganzen schweben- den Traum der Bilder, die seine Seele vorbeistreichen, sich in ein Moment des Wachens sammlen, auf einem Bilde freiwillig verweilen, es in helle ruhigere Obacht nehmen, und sich Merkmale absondern kann, dass dies der Gegenstand und kein andrer sei. Er beweiset auch Reflex- ion, wenn er nicht bloss alle Eigenschaften lebhaft oder klar orkennen; sondern eine oder mehrere als unterscheidende Eigenschaften bei sich anerkennen kann; der erste Aktus dieser Anerkenntniss2 giebt deutlichen Begriff; est ist das erste Urtheil der Seele.3 Further, the singling out and apperception of any attribute, the formation of a clear concept, is in itself, in the true sense of the word, language, even though it be not uttered; for language can very well be defined as series of associated attributes or concepts, symbolically interpreted. For the purpose of illustration, Herder 1 Herder, op. cit. p. 29. 2 By Anerkenntniss Herder means about as much as " apperception." 3 Op. cit., p. 35. 120</page><page sequence="13">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE " 13 supposes a sheep to pass by primitive man.' The latter, with mind unobscured by the wolfish instinct to tear the sheep to pieces, will, by virtue of his power of Besonnenheit, quietly per- ceive the white, wooly phenomenon. Suddenly the sheep bleats; involuntarily primitive man picks out this remarkable sound as the characteristic attribute in the complex of sensations presented to him by the sheep. The sheep crosses his path once again. Primitive man, not yet fully practiced in the apperception of objects, does not at first recognize his wooly friend. But the sheep again bleats, whereupon he remembers the similar sound heard before; the characteristic attribute then, in this case the bleating, serves to establish the identity of the two sensation- groups. Ever thereafter the remembered audible image of bleat- ing will associate itself with the totality of images, visual, tactile, and others, that go to make up the phenomenon sheep. Does not this mean that the image of bleating becomes the name of the object, even though the speech-organs of primitive man never attempt to reproduce the sound? With the acquisition of a num- ber of constant images of apperceived attributes language is now fairly begun, and is shown to be, in Herder's opinion, a necessary corollary of the postulated Besonnenheit, peculiar to man. At this point Herder takes up certain arguments advanced by some to prove the impossibility of the human origin of language. Siassmilch contended that without the use of language no act of reason was possible. Consequently man, in order to reason, must have been in prior possession of the gift of speech. But it is impossible that he should have himself invented it; for reason, not yet in operation, would evidently have been necessary there- for. The only way out of the difficulty, then, is to assume that God first taught man the use of language, by the employment of which the exercise of reason followed. Herder has no difficulty in showing the circle in the argument. If man was to grasp the linguistic instruction of God, and not simply repeat his words in parrot-like manner, he must already have been in pos- session of an elaborate complex of concepts and, therefore, also of language; for, according to his analysis, the genesis of the two is 1 The illustration was borrowed by Herder from Moses Mendelssohn. 121</page><page sequence="14">14 EDWARD SAPIR simultaneous. To seek a parallel for divine instruction in the language-teaching of children by their parents is of no avail. The child recognizes most attributes and acquires his store of concepts by his own unaided experience-that is, the real acqui- sition of language is his own unaided work; all that the parents do is to force him to label his stock of concepts with those arbi- trary symbols which they happen to use themselves. So far Herder has discussed only the singling-out of attributes in general. The question now arises which attributes are most likely to be picked out originally as the first elements of language. The sense of sight, Herder believes, develops at the start with too great difficulty to allow visual attributes to be seized upon as the characteristic ones of objects; moreover, light-phenomena are too "cold" (this is Herder's term) to appeal to primitive man. The lower senses, notably that of touch, on the other hand, receive impressions that are too coarse and undefined for the purposes of speech. It remains, then, for the sense of hearing to give the characteristic attributes and, as Herder expresses it, become Lehr- meister der Sprache. Thus the sheep, as we have seen, becomes to man the "bleater;" the dog, the "barker;" the wind, the "rustler;" and so on indefinitely. The abstraction, then, of sound-attributes, coupled with a mechanical and spontaneous imi- tation of these, forms the first vocabulary of man. The biblical sentence, "Gott fthrte die Thiere zu ihm, dass er sahe, wie er sie nennte, und wie er sie nennen wiirde, so sollten sie heissen," Herder chooses to consider a poetical, peculiarly oriental rendi- tion of the soberly expressed philosophic truth: "Der Verstand, durch den der Mensch aiber die Natur herrschet, war der Vater einer lebendigen Sprache, die er aus Tonen schallender Wesen zu Merkmalen der Unterscheidung sich abzog.'" If language were the invention of the Creator, we should expect to see his spirit-that is, pure reason-reflected in his work. But such is by no means the case. Pure reason or logic would require us to seek nouns as the most original constituents of the vocabulary of a language; for evidently, in strictly logical reasoning, the subject comes before the predicate, the thing 1 Herder, op. cit., p. 50. 122</page><page sequence="15">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 15 that acts before the action. As a matter of fact, however, the radical elements of languages are not substantive in character, but verbal; this we can explain, if we bear in mind that primitive man was most impressed by sounding actions (IOnende Handlun- gen). Since these actions were manifested in certain objects, it followed that the latter were named by the same natural sounds as the former; thus we have nouns developing out of verbs, and not vice versa. "The child names the sheep, not as sheep, but as a bleating animal, and thus turns the interjection into a verb."' All old and primitive languages clearly show, Herder is very sure, the verbal origin of nouns, and a philosophically arranged dictionary of an oriental language would be "a chart of the course of the human spirit, a history of its development, and the most excellent proof of the creative power of the human soul."' It is somewhat strange to find as keen a mind as Herder's occupying itself with so useless and at bottom meaning- less a problem as the priority of the parts of speech. It goes without saying that in the earliest period of language-formation there could not have been the slightest differentiation in word- functioning. Making use of Herder's favorite example, there is no reason to suppose that the remembered audible sensation "bleating" should originally have had more reference to the action of bleating than to the sheep itself. We shall probably be nearer the truth if we assume that the word made in imitation of bleating was employed to signify all that had reference to the remembered phenomenon. The word, which we may assume foi the sake of argument to be "baa," might in modern terms signify "to bleat," "sheep," "wooly," or what not; only we must beware of imagining that "baa" had any clearly defined, grammatical function. Herder speaks of the sheep as "ein bl6ckendes Geschopf;" noting that bl6ckend is a verbal form, he concludes that the verb was the original part of speech. Nature, Herder proceeds, appears to man as a resounding (tonend) whole; hence man infers that nature is animated, living, and personifies all the phenomena presented to his consciousness. By this peculiarly human tendency to vivify the inanimate and 1 Op. cit., pp. 52, 53. 2 Ibid., p. 53. 123</page><page sequence="16">16 EDWARD SAPIR relate to his own experience the vast sea of extra-human phe- nomena can be easily explained the most primitive religions, the grammatical category of sex-gender, which Herder, erroneously of course, seems to imagine is particularly widespread, and, above all, the genesis of poetry. For what was this earliest language, imitating the sounds of living nature and expressing ideas in vivid imagery, but poetry? Furthermore, this language was song, not learned, as Herder well shows, from the birds, but "song, that was as natural to him, as suited to his organs and natural impulses, as the nightingale's song to herself." "All nature sang and resounded, and the song of man was a concert of all these voices; in so far as his understanding needed them, his feeling grasped them, [and] his organs could give expression to them."' That the oldest song and poetry are derived from this primeval condition of identity of song and language Herder considers proved; he is inclined to look upon the Homeric poems as survivals from this earliest time; and even today the originally musical character of speech is attested by the accents of many savage idioms. All of this enthusiastic speculation of Herder's on the singing- speech of primitive man-ideas which he had already developed in the earlier Fragmente-must now, of course, be taken with a grain of salt. That song and poetry are among the most natural forms of expression, and are found, inseparably linked, practically all over the world, is now fully recognized. Moreover, we have no difficulty in supposing that the earliest forms of language were more expressive emotionally than now; the human voice may, very possibly, have had a more decided pitch-modulation, have moved at greater musical intervals, than now, and thus have pro- duced much of the effect of song. Even this, however, is mere speculation. But to suppose that the earliest speech was, in any true sense of the word, melodic song, from which the vocal art of the Greeks could be more or less directly derived, is to be con- sidered the wildest and most improbable fancy. As to the finished art-works of Greece being survivals from Herder's hypothetical period of spontaneous poesy, that needs no comment here. It is not difficult to understand how objects that have distinctive 1 Herder, op. cit., p. 58. 124</page><page sequence="17">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 17 sound-attributes, such as a bleating sheep, can be symbolized by sound images. But how is it with phenomena that do not of themselves suggest suitable audible symbols? How are the impressions of sight and feeling, taste and smell, to be naturally expressed in terms of auditory impressions? Herder seeks the solution of this puzzling question in a psychologic truth, which one is somewhat surprised to see grasped so clearly in the eighteenth century. His remarks are so illuminating that I can- not do better than quote from them: What are these properties [i. e., of sight, hearing, etc.] in objects? They are merely sensed impressions in us, and as such do they not all flow into one another? We are one thinking sensorium commune, only affected on various sides- therein lies the explanation. Feeling under- lies all senses, and this gives the most disparate sensations, so intimate, strong, indefinable a bond of union, that out of this combination the strangest appearances arise. There is more than one instance known to me of persons who, naturally, perhaps from some impression of child- hood, could not do otherwise than directly combine by some rapid muta- tion [we should say "association" nowadays] this color with that sound with this appearance that entirely different, indefinite feeling, that, when viewed through the light of slow reason, has absolutely no connection therewith: for who can compare sound and color, appearance and feeling ? ' From this now experimentally well-established psychologic law of an ever-present, at times indefinite but always real, undercurrent of feeling, accompanying and coloring the ever-flowing stream of sensation, Herder derives a somewhat nebulously stated corollary, an application of the law to the genesis of language. He declares: Since all senses, particularly in the condition of man's childhood, are nothing but forms of feeling of one mind; and since all feeling, according to an emotional law of animal nature, has directly its own vocal expres- sion; therefore, if this feeling is heightened to the intensity of a character- istic mark (Merkmal), the word of external language is there.2 Furthermore: Since man receives the language of nature only by way of hearing, and without it cannot invent language, hearing has, in some manner, become the central one of his senses, the gate, as it were, to the mind, and the bond of union between the other senses.3 1 Op. cit., p. 61. 2Ibid., p. 64. 3 Ibid., p. 64. 125</page><page sequence="18">18 EDWARD SAPIR That the sense of hearing does really occupy so relatively important a place is, of course, at least questionable; but Herder, undismayed by disquieting doubts, proceeds to give six reasons for thinking so. First, hearing occupies a medial position among the senses in regard to range of impressivenesss (Sphdre der Empfindbarkeil); being richer than the tactile, and less over- whelming and distracting than the optic, sense. Thus it stands in the closest connection of any with the other senses, and is well adapted to serve as a transformer into linguistically usable images of the impressions conveyed through the medium of sight and touch. Secondly, hearing is a middle sense in the matter of clearness; the sense of touch gives too dull, undefined impressions, while the impressions of sight are too bright and manifold. Hear- ing effectively heightens the former, modifies the latter. Thirdly, hearing occupies a middle position as regards vividness (Lebhaf- tigkeit); feeling is too warm a sense, lodges itself too deeply and overpoweringly in one's consciousness, while visual impressions are too cold and leave one indifferent. The auditory sense is, then, for the whole mind, what the color green, as it were, is for the visual sense-neither too dull nor too intense. Fourthly, hearing is the middle sense in respect to the time in which it operates; tactile impressions are sudden and momentary; those of sight, on the other hand, confuse by their simultaneity. As opposed to these, auditory impressions generally take place in progression- not very much is offered at any one moment, but the flow of auditory sensation is fairly continuous. Fifthly, the images induced by the sense of hearing need outward expression. Impressions produced by feeling are too dark and self-centered to need such expression; the objects revealed by the sense of sight are generally permanent and can be indicated by gesture; "but the objects that appeal to hearing" Herder says, "are con- nected with motion: they slip by; but just on that account they give rise to sounds. They are capable of expression because they must be expressed, and because they must be expressed, because of their motion, they become capable of expression."' This quotation is a fair specimen of Herder's method of ratiocina- 1 Op. cit., p. 67. 126</page><page sequence="19">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 19 tion at times. Sixthly and finally, hearing is the middle sense in point of order of development, feeling coming before and sight after. Thus Herder proves, apparently to his own entire satisfaction, that all the impressions of sense become capable of adequate linguistic expression by way of their close connection with the supposedly middle sense-that of hearing. Let us not bother with an unprofitable critique of Herder's anti- quated and subjectively confused psychology, and consider it proved, for the sake of his argument, that all intense outward stimuli, no matter of what description, find their natural response in vocal expression. Herder next proceeds to lay down a series of theses on the characteristics of "original" (urspriinglichen) languages, the purpose of which is to show how clearly the imprint of the human mind is visible in them. This to us is very axiomatic, but we should not forget that it was necessary for Herder to demonstrate it in order to disprove the orthodox theory of divine origin. The first of these Satze reads: "The older and more original languages are, the more is this analogy of the senses noticeable in their roots."' Where we characterize in terms of sight or feeling, the oriental often prefers to have recourse to the sense of hearing. "Anger," for instance, is most commonly in later times thought of in terms of visual phenomena, such as blazing eyes and glow- ing cheeks; the oriental, however, finds its characteristic mark in the fierce snort of the nostrils.2 Again, "life" is to most of us moderns best characterized by the pulse-beat, while the oriental hears in the living breath the most salient element of animated existence. And so on indefinitely. Herder's second thesis reads: "The older and more original languages are, the more do the various shades of feeling cross each other in the roots of the words."3 He proceeds: Let one open any oriental lexicon at random, and one will perceive the struggling desire to express ideas! How the inventor tore out ideas from one feeling and borrowed them for another! How he borrowed most of all from the most difficult, coldest, clearest senses! How every- 1 Op. cit., p. 70. 2 Herder had in mind probably Heb. 'aph " anger ", dual 'appdyim "nostrils." 3 Op. cit., p. 71. 127</page><page sequence="20">20 EDWARD SAPI1R thing had to be transformed into feeling and sound, in order to gain expression! Hence the strong, bold metaphors in the roots of words! Hence the extensions from feeling to feeling, so that the meanings of stem-words and, still more so, those of their derivatives, when put next to each other, present the most motley picture. The genetic cause lies in the poverty of the human mind and in the flowing together of the emotions of a primitive human being.1 The whole discussion of the metaphorical character of "original" languages is one of those wonderfully intuitive bits of insight that one meets with frequently enough in Herder's writings. He saw clearly the perfectly natural, and, indeed, psychologically inevitable, play of metaphor that runs through the history of language. This was remarkable at a time when figures of speech were thought to be the artistic flowers of polite literature. The modern semasiologist can, however, be bolder than Herder. He recognizes clearly that metaphor operates with equal power at all periods in the development of a language, not chiefly in the relatively older phases, as Herder thought, but just as well in times nearer the present. Moreover, he is inclined to believe that not merely a large part of the vocabulary of a language is metaphorically transferred in meaning, but that practically all of it has undergone an indefinite number of gradual semantic trans- mutations. Herder's third thesis is as follows: The more original a language is, the more frequently do such feelings cross in it; the less easily can these be exactly and logically subordinated to one another. The language is rich in synonyms; alongside of real poverty it has the most unnecessary superfluity.2 How can so ill-arranged a mass of material be the work of God? As coming from the hand of man, however, the presence of synonyms is entirely explicable. Herder argues: The less acquainted one was with natural phenomena; the more aspects one could in inexperience observe therefrom and hardly recognize; the less one invented d priori, but rather according to circumstances of sense: the more synonyms.3 This great wealth of synonyms is seen not only in the proverbial two hundred words of the Arab for "snake" and about one 1 Qp. ctt., p. 71. SIbid., p. 75. 3 Ibid., p. 76. 128</page><page sequence="21">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE " 21 thousand for "sword," but also in most languages of primitive tribes. Herder points out that the latter, although often lacking terms for ideas which seem to us most necessary of expression, frequently possess an astonishing wealth of words for ideas but slightly differentiated in our own minds. As fourth canon Herder enunciates the following: Just as the human mind can recall no abstraction out of the realm of spirits which it did not obtain by means of opportunities and awaken- ings of the senses, so also our language contains no abstract word which it has not obtained by means of tone and feeling. And the more original the language, the fewer abstractions, the more feelings.' That all abstract ideas are originally expressed in terms of con- crete images is almost self-evident, and Herder has, indeed, little difficulty in proving his point. Again he has recourse for his illustrations to the language of the Orient and of primitive peoples. "Holy" was, for instance, originally "set apart" in meaning; "soul" meant really "breath." Missionaries and travelers unani- mously testify to the great difficulty of rendering abstract terms in the idioms of comparatively uncultured peoples; the history of civilization shows that many of the terms used in philosophy and other regions of abstract thought are simply borrowed from the vocabularies of nations already farther advanced in specula- tion. All this, Herder rightly emphasizes, points to the operation of purely human powers; no terms are found for abstractions not absolutely necessary to the thought of the people who use them, while in every case such terms are originally of purely sensational origin. Surely there can be no talk here of divine intervention, where only human weakness is manifest. Herder's fifth and last thesis runs: Since every grammar is only a philosophy of language and a method of its use, it follows that the more original the language, the less grammar there must be in it, and the oldest [language] is simply the vocabulary of nature.2 Herder devotes several pages to a consideration of this matter, but his whole treatment seems now confused and antiquated. One acquainted with the elaborate formal machinery, particularly in 1 Op. cit., p. 78. 2 Ibid., pp. 82, 83. 129</page><page sequence="22">22 EDWARD SAPIR regard to the verb, of the Semitic and of many North American Indian languages, both of which Herder considered particularly "original" in character, will be inclined to deny point-blank the validity of his thesis. Herder, however, is not blind to this grammatical complexity. On the contrary, he asserts, paradoxi- cally enough, that this very complexity is a sign of the lack of a true grammatical sense. He thinks that those languages that make use of complicated grammatical schemes show thereby their inability to arrange their material systematically and logically; the Germans or French, for instance, he implies, with fewer para- digms, have more of a grammar in the true sense of the word. Speaking more particularly of verb-forms, he says: The more conjugations [are found], the less thoroughly one has learned to systematize concepts relatively to each other. How many the orientals have! and yet they are not such in reality, for what transplanta- tions and transferences of the verbs are there not from conjugation to conjugation! The matter is quite natural. Since nothing concerns man so much, at least appears to him so linguistically suitable, as that which he is to narrate: deeds, actions, events; therefore, such a multitude of deeds and events must originally have been gathered that a new verb arose for almost every condition.' Herder's arguments do not, it is almost needless to observe, bear inspection. Herder thought of grammar, as was very natural in the eighteenth century, as something which was, with increasing civilization, brought to bear on language from without. With this conception in his mind, it seemed that to admit the existence of complex grammatical form in "original" languages was playing into the hands of Siissmilch. Today, however, owing to the vast stock of comparative and historic linguistic material at our disposal, we see clearly that grammar, so far from needing the loving attention of the grammarians, takes very good care of itself and develops along definite lines. We need not, therefore, deal in paradoxes and can admit, with a clear conscience, that many typically "original" languages, to adopt Herder's now unserviceable terminology, possess truly grammatical features of incredible complexity, as in the case of the Eskimo verb or Bantu noun. 1 Op. cit., p. 83. 130</page><page sequence="23">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 23 Herder ends the first part of his prize essay with a paragraph which contains the following statement: Ich bilde mir ein, das Kbnnen der Empfindung menschlicher Sprache sei mit dem, was ich gesagt . . . . so bewiesen, dass wer dem Menschen nicht Vernunft abspricht, oder, was eben so viel ist, wer nur weiss, was Vernunft ist: wer sich ferner je um die Elemente der Sprache philoso- phisch bekiimmert, .... der kann nicht einen Augenblick zweifeln, wenn ich auch weiter kein Wort mehr hinzusetze.1 And, indeed, Herder might have logically concluded the essay at this point, though we should not like to miss some of the thoughts in the second part. The form of the question as put by the academy, seemed, however, to Herder to demand an arrange- ment of his subject-matter into two distinct parts. Inasmuch as both of the queries posed are practically answered by Herder in the first part, we need not analyse in detail the trend of his argu- ment in the second, which ostensibly discusses "auf welchem Wege der Mensch sich am foiglichsten hat Sprache erfinden konnen und mtassen," but which, in reality, deals chiefly with the gradual development of language. It is itself subdivided into four sections, each of these discussing a natural law operative in this development. The first of these Naturgesetze, which Herder takes so seri- ously as to put in the imperative form, reads: "Man is a freely thinking, active being, whose powers work on progressively; therefore he shall be a creature of language (Gesch5pf der Sprache)."' As the wording of this law implies, Herder here recapitulates, with amplifications, a good deal of what he had already presented in the first part. But there is a new thought introduced here-that of development in the line of progress. The gift of speech is, it is true, as characteristic of man as the ability to construct a hive is native to the bee-with this notable difference: the bee, acting mechanically by virtue of its inborn instinctive powers, builds as efficiently the first day as the last, and will build so, Herder believes, to the end of time; the lan- guage of man, however, increases in power and efficiency with every use that is made of it. The reason for this law of linguistic growth in the individual is evident when we consider the relation 1 Op. cit., p. 89. 2 Ibid., p. 93. 131</page><page sequence="24">24 EDWARD SAPIR between thought and language. "There is no condition of the human mind," Herder says, "which is not capable of linguis- tic expression or not really determined by words of the mind ( Worte der Seele)."' Hence growth in the power of reflexion or Besonnenheit, conditioned by the growth of experience, entails also advance in the employment of language. "The growth of lan- guage," as Herder puts it, "is as natural to man as his nature itself."2 Sassmilch had objected to the idea of a human develop- ment of language on the ground that such a proceeding would have required the thought of a philosophically trained mind, such as it would be utterly absurd to imagine primitive man to have been in possession of. Herder points out the shallowness of his argument in very emphatic terms-an argument that, lacking absolutely all sense of historical perspective, would pic- ture primitive man as placed in the same environment and governed by the same conventions as prevailed in the pseudo- philosophical atmosphere of the eighteenth century. Herder gives a most excellent characterization of the spirit of his time in a few sentences which express his profound dissatisfaction with it: Es ist ffir mich unbegreiflich, wie man sich so tief in die Schatten, in die dunklen WerkstAtten des Kunstmassigen verlieren kann, ohne auch nicht ein mal das weite, helle Licht der uneingekerkerten Natur erkennen zu wollen . . . . Aus den Meisterstiicken menschlicher Dichtkunst und Beredsamkeit [sind] Kindereien geworden, an welchen greise Kinder und junge Kinder Phrasen lernen und Regeln klauben. Wir haschen ihre Formalitaten und haben ihren Geist verloren; wir lernen ihre Sprache und fiihlen nicht die lebendige Welt ihrer Gedanken. Derselbe Fall ist's mit unserm Urtheilen iAber das Meisterstfick des menschlichen Geistes, die Bildung der Sprache iiberhaupt. Da soll uns das todte Nachdenken Dinge lehren, die bloss aus dem lebendigen Hauche der Welt, aus dem Geiste der grossen wirksamen Natur den Menschen beseelen, ihn aufrufen undfort bilden konnten. Da sollen die stumpfen, spaten Gesetze der Grammatiker das G6ttlichste sein, was wir verehren, und vergessen die wahre gOttliche Sprachnatur, die sich in ihren Herzen mit dem menschlichen Geiste bildete, so unregelmissig sie auch scheine. Die Sprachbildung ist in die Schatten der Schule gewichen, aus denen sie nichts mehr fiir die lebendige Welt wirket: drum soll auch nie eine helle Welt gegeben sein, in der die ersten Sprachenbilder leben, fiihlen, schaffen, und dichten mussten.3 10p. cit., p. 100. 2 Ibid., p. 101. 3 Ibid., pp. 111, 112. 132</page><page sequence="25">HERDER'S " URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 25 Herder's second natural law carries the development of lan- guage one step farther; the first law dealt with the growth of language in the individual, the second is devoted to its develop- ment in the family. The law reads: "Man is, according to his nature, a being of the herd, of society: The development of a language is therefore natural, essential, necessary to him."' The great physical weakness of the human female as compared with the male, and the utter helplessness of the newborn child, make it absolutely necessary that human beings, even more so than is the case among the animals, form into families, sharing a common abode. The primitive man, more experienced than his mate and offspring, would naturally proceed to teach them that stock of linguistic information which he had himself so laboriously gath- ered. The child, entirely dependent as he is upon the exertions of his father, would babblingly repeat the sounds uttered in his neighborhood, and in time become inheritor of his parent's entire vocabulary. Arrived at maturity, he would go on enriching the store of linguistic knowledge on the basis of his own experience. In this way the institution of the family becomes an important means for the perpetuation from generation to generation and for the gradual enrichment of language. Moreover, in the very process of teaching, the language becomes more definitely organ- ized, the stock of ideas becomes more and more clearly defined; Herder, indeed, sees in this earliest process of language-instruc- tion the genesis of grammar. The most interesting portion of the second part of Herder's essay is the discussion of the third natural law, dealing with the rise of nationally distinct languages. Herder formulates his law thus: "Just as the whole race of man could not possibly remain one herd, so also it could not retain one language. There arises consequently the formation of various national tongues."2 Herder begins his discussion by clearly pointing out that, in the exact or, as he terms it, "metaphysical" sense of the word, no two per- sons speak precisely the same language, any more than they are exact physical counterparts. Setting aside, however, such minute individual differences, it can easily be shown that more distinctly 1 Op. cit., p. 112. 2 Ibid., pp. 123, 124. 133</page><page sequence="26">26 EDWARD SAPIR marked linguistic groups or dialects would, in the nature of things, form. Every family-group puts its own characteristic stamp upon the inherited linguistic stock; differences of climate work upon the speech-organs, and consequently, Herder supposes, upon the language itself;' the preference for different words and turns of expression in different sections of the linguistic field gives rise to dialects. "Original" languages, moreover, being less hampered, according to Herder, by grammatical rules, are more liable to dialectic disintegration than more cultured idioms; although here, too, the most careful modern linguistic research does not uncon- ditionally bear out Herder's presumption. The oft-asserted and oft-repeated statement of the incredibly rapid change of the languages of primitive tribes is founded chiefly on the untrust- worthy reports of linguistically inefficient missionaries; many of the extreme statements formerly and even yet current are absurdly untrue. Indeed, the most startling cases of linguistic conserva- tism are found among certain primitive peoples, such as the Eskimos. Man, Herder proceeds, with an almost naive anthropomorphic teleology, is made for all the earth and all the earth for man. Hence we find him at home as well in the regions of eternal snow as under the burning sun of the tropics. As is to be expected, under widely diverse geographical and climatic conditions, the originally homogeneous race of man differentiates into diverse races, while the originally homogeneous speech of man differ- entiates first into dialects, then, with the lapse of ages, into mutually quite unintelligible languages. Hence is to be explained the bewildering Babel of tongues; as Herder expresses it: "Die Sprache wird ein Proteus auf der runden Oberflache der Erde."' It is to be borne in mind, of course, that the now familiar con- ception of independent linguistic stocks was in the main a foreign one to Herder; it did not arise until after a lucky fate discovered the relationship of the idiom of ancient India with that of far- distant Greece and Rome. If Herder's view of the gradual 1 It should be stated here, however, that, contrary to all expectation, anatomical investi- gation has never succeeded in demonstrating differences of vocal anatomy to be the basis of differences in dialect or language. 2 Op. cit., p. 127. 134</page><page sequence="27">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 27 differentiation of speech is correct, we expect to find linguistic modifications congruent to geographic differences. How comes it, then, that totally diverse languages are often found spoken side by side ? Herder thinks to be able satisfactorily to explain this puzzling condition by the hatred with which neighboring tribes frequently regard each other. Such discord would oper- ate quite as effectively as geographical barriers toward linguistic isolation. The description of the confusion of tongues in Genesis Herder interprets as a characteristically oriental method of pre- senting this truth. The fourth and last Naturgesetz reads: Just as, according to all probability, the human race forms a pro- gressive whole from one origin in one great system; so also all languages, and with them the whole chain of culture.! After a brief r6sum6 of the links in the chain of linguistic develop- ment- development in the individual, in the family, and in the nation-Herder most emphatically supports a monogenistic view of language as the most rational. His chief reason for the con- tention is the evident similarity he finds in the grammatical structure of the various languages--a similarity that he believes to be so great as to preclude all possibility of polygenism. The only serious departure from the common grammatical outlines is found, according to Herder, in the case of Chinese, which how- ever, is but an exception. Herder advances as another argument in favor of linguistic monogenism the almost universal use of the same or very similar alphabets. This universality was more apparent in Herder's time than now, for the Egyptian and various cuneiform records had not as yet been deciphered. Still one is rather surprised to find a man of Herder's stamp so lose sight of the perspective of history as to present so lame an argument. One might have expected him to perceive that in any case the formation of written alphabets must have taken place long after independent languages had developed, and that the wide spread of the so-called Phconician alphabet was due to several stages of borrowing, to a great extent, within historic times. The latter part of the essay rapidly summarizes the orthodox 10 p. cit., p. 134. 135</page><page sequence="28">28 EDWARD SAPIR stand taken by Siissmilch and his followers as against the more philosophical and psychologically sounder view of Herder con- cerning the origin of language. Herder makes bold to call the orthodox view "nonsense" (Unsinn), and accuses its supporters of petty anthropomorphism in their conception of God's activity. On the other hand, he claims: Der menschliche [Ursprung] zeigt Gott im grossesten Lichte; sein Werk, eine menschliche Seele, durch sich selbst, eine Sprache schaffend und fortschaffend, weil sie sein Werk, eine menschliche Seele ist.' At the very end of the essay we find Herder's own statement of his aim, with which I shall close my analysis of his work as a perfectly good formulation of the spirit to be pursued in investi- gations of such a character even today: Er [i. e., der Verfasser] befliss sich feste Data aus der menschlichen Seele, der menschlichen Organisation, dem Bau aller alten und wilden Sprachen, und der ganzen Haushaltung des menschlichen Geschlechts zu sammlen, und seinen Satz so zu beweisen, wie die festeste philo- sophische Wahrheit bewiesen werden kann.2 It is hardly necesssary to go into any general criticism on Herder's prize essay, particularly as various points in Herder's argument have been the subject of critical comment in the course of our analysis. That much of the work is quite antiquated, both in subject-matter and general attitude, is, of course, self-evident; it is rather to be wondered at how much in the essay is still valid, and with what remarkable intuitive power Herder grasped some of the most vital points both in psychology and language. One wishes that we today could be so cocksure of the solution of cer- tain linguistic problems as Herder seems to have been; but, then, that was characteristic in a large measure of the age of rationalism. The philosophers of the eighteenth century, relying very heavily on pure reason unfettered by hard facts, proceeded, with admir- able courage, to attack and solve the most obscure and intricate problems in the history of human culture-problems to the solu- tion of which we have now learned to proceed quite timidly. Some of this blind trust in pure reason is apparent in our prize essay; yet Herder attempted, as much as possible, to make use of what linguistic material was at hand in the verification of his theories. I op. cit., p. 146. 2 Ibid., p. 147. 136</page><page sequence="29">HERDER'S "URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE" 29 It is not necessary, either, to go into any analysis of the literary style of Herder's essay, as the important thing in our subject is not Herder's language, but rather his thought. The characteristic qualities of Herder's style are here in evidence as elsewhere; wealth of figurative expression; a lavish use of rhetori- cal periods, as outwardly indicated by a generous sprinkling of exclamation points, interrogation points, and dashes (it may be noted that the treatise ends with a dash); and a warm, enthusias- tic diction, which often carries the author away from the imme- diate object of discussion. In general, however, the essay is remarkable, at least when considered as a Herder document, for the systematic development of the theme and for clearness of exposition. It is certainly very strange, and almost incredible, that one who succeeded so well in demonstrating the human origin of language should himself have later been in doubt as to the validity of his conclusions; yet such was the melancholy case with Herder. When Herder wrote the prize essay, during the latter part of his stay in Strassburg (1770), he was still, in the main, in sympathy with the rationalistic advocates of reason, even though the bloodless Aufklcirung of a Nicolai was not exactly to his taste. Hence we find in the essay a strong aversion for the mystic and supernatural, and a desire to explain all cultural' phenomena in the light of human intelligence. In the early part of his Baickeburg residence, however, Herder's ideas underwent a tremendous change. So radical, indeed, was the transformation effected in his general mental attitude that the Preisschrift may be conveniently considered as marking the end of a definitely limited period in Herder's life. The mental change referred to was a break with the older standpoint of "enlightenment" (Auf- klarung), which had on the whole, despite Hamann's influence, dominated Herder's thoughts, if at times equivocally. He now (1771-72), very largely under the influence of the mystically pious Countess of Biickeburg, leaned toward romanticism, and a philosophy and theology that did not seek the final explanation of things in reason. Hence, when the news reached Herder that he had been awarded the prize, he was anything but elated; the 137</page><page sequence="30">30 EDWARD SAPIR whole spirit and tendency of his essay were now quite distasteful to him, and belonged already for Herder to the dim past. Despite the change in Herder, congratulations on the winning of the prize came in from all sides; "the townspeople," he writes, "regard me as the most celebrated of men because I have now gained the prize."' These congratulations, as might well be expected under the circumstances, brought Herder more vexation than satisfaction. At Easter of the year 1772, Herder's former preceptor, Hamann, who had not corresponded with his disciple since the latter had left Riga, and from whom Herder had in the meanwhile become somewhat estranged, intellectually speaking, wrote a cold and hostile review of the Ursprung der Sprache in the Konigsberger Journal. Though many ideas developed in the essay had been largely inspired by suggestions of Hamann himself, nevertheless Herder's flat denial of the direct agency of God in the invention of language was by no means to the other's taste. The stand taken by Hamann is well summarized by Nevinson: "God might act through nature and the voices of beasts, but from God lan- guage, as all else, must come, for in God we live and move and have our being."' Herder felt the sting of criticism all the more keenly in that he was now largely in sympathy with Hamann's views, and felt drawn toward his former teacher more powerfully than ever. Through the mediation of their mutual friend, Hart- knoch, a reconciliation was effected between the two, Herder recanting the heresies of which he had been guilty. In a second and more favorable review, and in a treatise entitled The Last Words of the Red-Cross Knight on the Divine or Human Origin of Language, Hamann clearly shows that the friends of old were friends again. Perhaps nothing can prove more clearly the unhealthy element in the mysticism of Herder's Btickeburg period than his amazing repudiation of the doctrines he had him- self so unanswerably demonstrated. For a time he occupied himself with the thought of adding some words of explanation and semi-apology to the essay, published by authority of the Academy in 1772, but nothing came of the plan.

Da ist es denn kein Wunder, wenn Herder in der Folgezeit den lieben Gott wieder um die Erfindung der Sprache bemitht.1 Certainly disingenuous is Herder's statement, in the long letter of explanation addressed to Hamann, that after all he had not seriously differed from his preceptor, and that in writing for "an enlightened royal Prussian Academy"2 he had been forced to put on the mask of the "Leibnitzian testhetic form."3 After Herder had freed himself from the mists of Btickeburg mysticism, a reversal in judgment set in in favor of his earlier comparatively rationalistic views, so that, when seventeen years later, in 1788-89, he prepared a second edition of the Preisschrift, he found little to change in the text, save in the matter of chastening the wild- ness of the language. We may then safely look upon our Preis- schrift as the most important and genuine expression of Herder's views upon the subject of language. Concerning the influence of Herder's prize essay on sub- sequent linguistic speculation it is difficult to speak definitely, from the very nature of Herder's work. Herder did not, as we have seen, definitely systematize, nor could his solution of the problem be considered in any way final; his own subsequent vacillation shows, perhaps more clearly than anything else, the unsatisfactory nature of much of the reasoning. Contradictions even of no small significance and lack of clearness in the terms used will have been noticed in the course of our exposition of Herder's essay; the weak points in it, both when judged from the standpoint of Herder's own time and from that of the post- Humboldtian and pre-evolutionary view-point of the sixties, are probably best pointed out by the psychologist and linguistic philosopher, H. Steinthal, in his Ursprung der Sprache. Setting aside faults in the essay itself, it is evident that the new vistas of 1 F. Mauthner, "Zur Sprachwissenschaft" (Vol. II of Kritik der Sprache), pp. 47-50. 2See Nevinson, op. cit., p. 197. 3Ibid. 139</page><page sequence="32">32 EDWARD SAPIR linguistic thought opened up by the work of Karl Wilhelm von Humboldt, and the more special labors of Bopp and Grimm, speedily relegated Herder's treatise to the limbo of things that were, so that even as early as the period at which Steinthal and Grimm wrote their works on the origin of language, Herder's Preisschrift had already become of chiefly historical interest. The real historic significance, then, of Herder's work would be shown to lie in the general service it rendered by compelling a sounder study of the psychologic and historic elements involved in the investigation of the problem, and perhaps also in the sug- gestions it gave Humboldt for his far deeper treatment of the same and closely allied themes. Perhaps the best testimony which could be offered on the sub- ject of Herder's more general influence is the following quotation from Jacob Grimm at the close of his own work on the origin of language: Enden kann ich nicht, ohne vorher dem Genius des Mannes zu hul- digen, der was ihm an Tiefe der Forschung oder Strenge der Gelehr- samkeit abging, durch sinnvollen Tact, durch reges Gefiihl der Wahrheit ersetzend, wie manche andere, auch die schwierige Frage nach der Sprache Ursprung bereits so erledigt hatte, dass seine ertheilte Antwort immer noch zutreffend bleibt, when sie gleich mit anderen Griinden, als ihm schon dafair zu Gebote standen, aufzustellen und bestlitigen ist.1 On his immediate contemporaries the prize essay doubtless made a deep impression. To Goethe, who was just at that time under Herder's personal influence, the author showed the essay while still in manuscript. Goethe had not thought very much about the subject, and was inclined to consider it as somewhat superfluous. "For," he says, "if man was of divine origin, so was language; and, if man must be regarded in the circle of nature, language must also be natural. Still, I read the treatise with great pleasure and to my special edification."' The extent and even existence of Herder's influence on Hum- boldt, on the other hand, is a disputed question. It is all the more important because practically all the later thought on the philosophy of language (Steinthal, Schleicher, and others) is 1 Jacob Grimm, Uber den Ursprung der Sprache (Berlin, 1852), p. 56. 2 See Nevinson, op. cit., p. 163. 140</page><page sequence="33">HERDER'S " URSPRUNG DER SPRACHE " 33 connected quite directly with Humboldt's ideas developed in his Uber das vergleichende Sprachstudium in Beziehung auf die verschiedenen Epochen der Sprachentwickelung, and still more in the Einleitung in die Kawisprache: ?ber die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluss auf die gei- stige Entwickelung der Menschengeschichte. Steinthal, himself an enthusiastic follower and developer of Humboldtian views, most emphatically denies any indebtedness on Humboldt's part to Herder.1 Haym, Herder's biographer, on the other hand, just as emphati- cally asserts the perceptible influence of Herder in Humboldt's writings, and claims that the latter is most decidedly to be con- sidered as standing on his predecessor's shoulders. He says: Er [i. e., Humboldt] wiederholt die Gedanken Herder's -er vertieft, er verfeinert, er bestimmt, er klirt sie, er denkt das von jenem gleichsam athemlos Gedachte mit ruhig verweilender Umsicht zum zweiten Male nach und durch.2 He goes on to show how, as with Herder, so also with Humboldt, man is "ein singendes Geschopf, aber Gedanken mit den Tonen verbindend";3 language is to Humboldt very much as to Herder, "die natiirliche Entwickelung einer den Menschen als solchen bezeichnenden Anlage."' To Humboldt the chief task of gen- eral linguistics is the consideration from a single point of view of the apparently infinite variety of languages, "und durch alle Umwandlnngen der Geschichte hindurch dem Gange der geisti- gen Entwickelung der Menschheit an der Hand der tief in die- selbe verschlungenen, sie von Stufe zu Stufe begleitenden Sprache zu folgen."5 This is evidently little else than a more satisfactory and scientific formulation of Herder's idea of the gradual growth of language in concomitance with the growth of Besonnenheit. On the whole, I should be inclined, in view of the greater probability of the historic continuity of ideas, to side with Haym. A com- prehensive statement of the position that Herder occupies in the history of linguistics is given by Lauchert." I H.

As the last general linguist to discuss language problems from the standpoint that maintained the existence of a wide, impassable gulf between man and the lower animals, and stoutly denied any genetic relationship between animal cries and the rude beginnings of human speech, should perhaps be mentioned Max Maller. Like Herder and Humboldt, he saw in language the distinguishing mark that separated man from the brute world, and was never tired, to the end of his days, of arguing that this possession of language was the death-blow to Darwinism. The idea of the interrelation of language and reason, and of their simultaneous growth, common to Herder and Humboldt, we find pushed to its utmost limit by Max Mutller. So impressed was he by this theory of the essential identity of language and reason that his slogan in later days was: "Without reason no language; without language no reason."' As is well known, his assertion of this principle brought on a fruitless logomachy with William Dwight Whitney. Despite Max Miller, however, it seems to me that the path for future work on the prime problems, more especially the origin, of language lies in the direction pointed out by evolution. A new element, the careful and scientific study of sound-reflexes in higher animals, must now enter into the discussion. Perhaps this, with a very extended study of all the various existing stocks of languages, in order to determine the most fundamental properties of lan- guage, may assist materially in ultimately rendering our problem more tractable. We should not only try to imagine to what beginnings the present state of language reaches back, but also to reconstruct an ideal picture of the evolution of howls and cries, under the favoring conditions, whatever those were, into less rude forms of audible expression. Perhaps the ends of the two series can be bridged over? EDWARD SAPIR COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 1 See, e. g., title-page of M. Mfller's Science of Thought (New York, 1887). 142</page></plain_text>
