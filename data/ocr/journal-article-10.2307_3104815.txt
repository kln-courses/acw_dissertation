<plain_text><page sequence="1">TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE Transatlantic Industrial Revolution: The Diffusion of Textile Technologies between Britain and America, 1790-1830s. By David J. Jeremy. Cam- bridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1981. Pp. 384; illustrations. $32.50. The object of this book, to quote one of the author's few forays into reverse anthropomorphism, is to narrate the "opening of the oyster of English technological achievement to the gaze and grasp of foreign visitors," most particularly to visitors from New England textile mills in the period from the 1770s until the 1830s. Jeremy restricts his attention here to cotton and woolen manufacturing processes, with rather more attention paid to carding, spinning, and weaving than to preliminary processing or to finishing techniques. If the reader already possesses some passing acquaintance with the technology of textile manufactures, he or she will find this volume to be an ex- tremely useful reference work concerning both the chronological se- quence of inventions and the subsequent adoption of improvements and alterations in the context of factory production, as well as a source of careful reproductions of patent sketches and photographs of many of the actual machines. In fact, the layout of this book is quite pleasing to the eye, with fifty-six illustrations and numerous tables and charts interspersed throughout the text. Unfortunately, it is that skeleton upon which this formidable graphic display is draped, the text itself, that does not adequately achieve the goal of providing a narrative of how these particular technologies were chosen, or an explanation of why these technologies were the successful transplants and others were not. While the claim that this volume makes use of "analytical tools" and "modern economic theory" figures quite prominently in the text, the only analytical organization this reader could discern was a sequence of unrelated and ill-specified hypotheses concerning technological transfer, which varied from innovation to innovation. Some exam- ples: Jeremy suggests that the immigrant artisan was the prime inter- national carrier of industrial technology before the 1820s (p. 49) but that only a small proportion of immigrants brought new industrial skills with them (p. 159) and that many immigrants were ineffective vehicles of transfer because of psychological predisposition, such as the fact that often they were "rogues" (p. 86). Jeremy also states that the employment of women and children in factory production en- couraged the automation of onerous tasks, but that Rhode Island firms, which depended more heavily upon child labor than did their Massachusetts counterparts, showed less of an interest in such in- novations (p. 211). These and many other hypotheses scattered throughout the text give the reader the impression that nothing much can be said in a general way about the societal determinants of the adoption and diffusion of textile technologies. If there is any consistent organizing principle to be gleaned from this volume, it appears to be a notion borrowed from neoclassical economic theory that the relative costs of the factors "labor" and Book Reviews 641</page><page sequence="2">"capital" act to focus innovative activity, with the object of conserving usage of the more expensive factor. Jeremy inadvertently undermines this thesis, however, when he suggests that there were increasing re- turns to scale in the early textile industry (p. 12); this is because his borrowed notions (from J. R. Hicks) of "capital-saving" and "labor- saving" innovations are well-defined only in the case of constant re- turns to scale. Perhaps more seriously, recent contributions to what has become known as the Cambridge capital controversy have pointed out that there is no necessary negative monotonic relation between "capital intensity" and the rate of return; hence there is no expecta- tion that a high rate of interest or rate of profit would imply low capital intensity or a tendency toward capital-saving innovations. Perhaps the reason Jeremy can make so very few solid statements about the factor-saving nature of any of the innovations he surveys is that "modern economic theory" gives him no rigorous basis for such a classification. Transatlantic Industrial Revolution does not adequately analyze or explain the diffusion of textile technology, although it does provide much of the raw material for such an analysis. The one hypothesis that Jeremy slights, that of the primary consideration of labor control in the choice of technique, might prove fruitful in this regard. The recent work of William Lazonick on the diffusion of ring spinning in Britain and America could easily be extended to other technologies, perhaps employing Jeremy's wealth of technological and anecdotal detail.

Tokyo: Bunshodo, 1981. Pp. 255. The book under review, written by a Japanese expert, contains three chapters: (1) definition of technology transfer (TT), (2) TT in the history of the United States and Japan, and (3) comparison of American and Japanese experiences in TT. In chapter 1, after having considered the origin of the concept of TT, the author stresses the distinction between theory and practice with reference to the definition of TT by R. S. Rosenbloom and D. S. Spencer. The theory refers to conditions that necessitate and facilitate *DR. MIROWSKI, of the Department of Economics, Tufts University, has recently published articles on the relations between institutional change and economic theory. He is at work on a study of the significance of the first law of thermodynamics for economic theory. 642 Book Reviews TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE</page></plain_text>
