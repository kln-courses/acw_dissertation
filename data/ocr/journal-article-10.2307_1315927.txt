<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles Rennie Mackintosh ALAN CRAWFORD. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995. 216 pp., numerous illus. (25 col.). ?6.95 paper. ISBN O 500 20283 4. This beautifully written and thought- fully argued book is by far the best short read on the extraordinarily talented architect and designer, Charles Rennie Mackintosh. It is also very well produced; at ?6.95 it has to be the design history bargain of the year. The excellent illustrations assist the viewer in seeing the objects afresh, particularly from the many interesting angles suggested by Alan Crawford. It is one of the great delights of the book that Crawford takes what many thought to be a well-worn topic but manages to stand back from received wisdom and orthodoxies and look at it afresh, particularly the buildings and objects. Faced with a limit of approximately 40,000 words, Craw- ford insisted on having footnotes in a series that often dispenses with them. All scholars should be grateful. Left with even fewer words, he then had to decide how to organize the material relating to all aspects of Mackintosh's life and work, including his marriage to and working relationship with Mar- garet Macdonald Mackintosh. Craw- ford is sensitive to the need to give Margaret her due and raises some interesting points about a collabora- tion which, if it was as close as he suggests it was at times, makes having only Charles's name on the cover something of a nonsense. Crawford's avowed aim was to tell a chronological story rather than divide the work up into separate chapters on architecture, furniture, interiors, fabrics, watercolours, etc. And what splendid narrative history this is. Within the simple format of following the 'hero' Crawford is care- ful never to romanticize Mackintosh (even though he helps us understand the romantic view of himself as 'artist' held by CRM, as aficionados refer to him-she is MMM). From 'Growing up in Glasgow', through his architec- tural training and visits to Italy and England, his association with 'The Four' and others at Glasgow School of Art, to the years in which he and Margaret designed the work for which he, and to a lesser degree they, are best known, Crawford builds up a complex picture. His touch is both bold and subtle, challenging but also encouraging the reader to look and/or think again for her- or himself. He also has the sense to ask the reader 'to respect the gaps in our knowledge, and to recognise that, for much of Mackintosh's life, we simply do not know what he thought or felt'. We are introduced to CRM growing up in the economically thriving city of Glasgow, and the 'facilitating' role of Frances Newbery, the energetic head of Glasgow School of Art, who influ- enced the tastes and careers of many other talented young people, is rightly emphasized. I particularly like Crawford's argument that it was 'The Four', and particularly MMM, who 'freed Mackintosh's imagina- tion', just as he was liberated socially and personally through mixing with artists and others from a different social class to him. The new freer Mackintosh continued to draw from the past but was also concerned to free design from 'antiquarian detail' and to 'clothe modem ideas with modem dress-adorn our designs with living fancy'. It is the Mackintosh, or rather Mack- intoshes (both in the sense of there being many aspects to CRM, and also in the sense of CRM and MMM constituting 'the Mackintoshes') of 'living fancy' rather than the proto- Modernist or practitioner of a dour vernacular that is so often fore- grounded here. Crawford makes sure we appreciate the subtleties, sophisti- cations, witticisms, and complexities that informed the best Mackintosh work and he does it so well that I 232 Journal of Design History Vol. 9 No. 3 ? 1996 The Design History Society</page><page sequence="2">fear we will soon be reading of CRM the proto-postmodernist. Crawford also is scrupulous in giving credit to the early and late work, neither of which have received the attention they deserve. I may be wrong, but it seems to me that the aspects of CRM's work that Crawford likes most, or at least fascinated him most (and they are not necessarily the same) when he was writing the book, was the period in the early i90os when, he argues, the work of CRM cannot be conceived of except as part of his collaboration with Margaret. My own position is that once there has been such an intense collaboration the effects are cumulative and there- after the influence of the one upon the other will always be there in some way or other. So close was the colla- boration between Charles and Mar- garet that I find it almost impossible to write of him and his work in isola- tion, a problem dealt with here with considerable understanding and the judicious use of the terms 'Mackintosh furniture' and 'Mackintosh interior' to help Crawford skate over some of the complexities of the collaboration which could not be addressed in such a short book. Crawford does not claim this as the definitive study of this multi-talented pair and acknowledges the important work of Janice Helland and others in relation to the collaboration and the wider issues of gender and design. Never- theless, his, at times, poetic descrip- tions of their joint efforts is one of the better parts of an excellent study. He manages to discuss romance, love, sensuality and sexuality, and related visual symbolism without seeming soppy, or too soppy. But a bit of soppi- ness might do no harm and just a little bit of good in a discipline and a topic not normally associated with analyses related to affectivity, to the heart, to the soul, or to the carnal. Yet it was here, perhaps surprisingly because Crawford is good at stimulating one to think of the work of the Mackin- toshes in new ways, that I began to worry about an over-simplistic equa- tion of Margaret with the 'feminine' and Charles with the 'masculine' ele- ments of their work. After all, as Crawford argues, the Aesthetic Move- ment is as important as the Arts and Crafts Movement in this particular story, and it might have been useful to think of how the Aesthetic Move- ment as a whole (ef)feminized design. Thinking along these lines made me realize that, after reading Crawford's sections on the tea-rooms, in which he nicely emphasizes not only the public 'parade' aspects of this social phe- nomenon which afforded women comfortable, pleasurable, and 'appro- priate' social space but also the thea- tricality which could be contained within the generic form, it is difficult for me not to think of the Willow Tea Rooms as a stage set furnished with glitzy (even camp?) anthropomorphic actors/chairs. There are many Mackintoshes and Crawford gives us more than a glimpse of many of them, including the later work at Derngate in North- ampton (c.1916-19). This, again, is covered well. Far from 'avant garde', these somewhat outmoded designs (based heavily on Viennese interiors and furniture of c.1904-6) have been neglected (probably because they do not accord with notions of CRM as the vanguardist innovator) despite their remarkable multi-layered patterning. It is a particular pleasure in such a short book to have a consistent even- handed appraisal of evidence and a concern for and interest in all the work. The odd fan of a particular building, interior, or object may be disappointed while others may wish there were more on the collaboration between CRM and the hugely talented Margaret. However, most will forgive the omissions and applaud the author of a book which takes one beyond the apparent simplicity (and other aspects of the designs and finished works) to discuss what, at any given moment, the work is actually about. Crawford's questioning of evidence and looking at buildings and objects without the shackles of weighty orthodoxies helps us grasp what it is that is actually going on. He would be the first to acknowledge that he is writing at a particularly fruitful time in terms of Mackintosh studies but, nevertheless, perhaps more than any other book on Mackintosh in the last twenty years, this publication has made me reconsi- der some well-known and well-loved work as well as the 'Mackintosh myth' which locates him as misunderstood genius, loved abroad and ignored at home. Read this book and enjoy the pleasures of good scholarship made accessible to a wide audience. The author and publisher are to be con- gratulated.
