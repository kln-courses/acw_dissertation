<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS, THEIR CARE AND BEHAVIOUR, Zdenek Vogel, 228 pp., Viking Press, New York, 1966. The author of this book has done an uneven but reasonably good job of treating two broad aspects of amphibians and reptiles. The strongest parts of the book are the many practical suggestions on the care and mainte- nance of these animals in captivity-design of vivaria, temperature, light, and other physical requirements, foods, conditions for breedings, and the treatment of diseases and parasites. Here the author's experience as a curator of collections is evident, and there is emphasis on a professional approach to the study and con- servation of amphibians and reptiles as well as to their display behind glass. For the care of the commonest pet species such as U.S. anoles, pet store booklets probably have more informa- tion, but the increasing availability of Xenopus, boa constrictors, green iguanas, African turtles, and other exotics in ordinary department store pet areas makes this book of more practical value. There is some emphasis on European species, but this is in some ways a worthwhile feature. This fauna is usually slighted in popular books on amphibians and reptiles of the world. Fair samples of the herpetological faunas of other Old World and New World areas are included, however. The index includes over 400 scientific names, although in the text many of these are merely mentioned. Approximately 20% of the names are of North American species, as are about 15% of the illustrations. It is interesting to see the attention given by a European to some of our common U.S. species. A page is shared, for example, by photographs of a Common Garter Snake and a Diced Water Snake of central Asia, another by a Tiger Salamander and a Siberian Salamander. Photographs are numerous (250; 36 in color) but the quality varies. The least satisfactory feature of the book is its treatment of amphibian and reptile natural history. There is a great deal of information, but it seems fragmentary, not well organized, and occasionally rather anthropomorphic, as where male toads in the breeding season are described as "so filled with desire that they neither see nor hear" and where one toad is said to look at another "as though it wants to box its ears." Technically, the book seems to be quite well done. Scientific names are those in current use. Errors are very rare, although the photo- graph of "mating" adders shows courtship, not copulation. The bibliography of ten references includes some as recent as 1964, but it could have been made much more useful by the inclusion of additional standard works. James C.
