" Oh, how curious, wonderfully curious, The laws of nature are, indeed— So very, very curious." — Old Song CtTRIOUS, indeed, the laws of nature may be, but curious as they are, they are not nearly so curious as are the multitude of opinions held by multitudes of people concerning them. There is perhaps no expression more constantly in use than the phrase, "natural law," and certain it is that no expression has been subject to more abuse. If we were to inquire of half-a-dozen people using the words as to what they meant by them—what, according to their ideas, the expression really signified—we should in all probability discover that no two of them would be in agreement, and that there prevailed a general vagueness of ideas, in many cases amounting to positive misconception. Few indeed should we find entertaining the expression with a full sense of its scientific or its philosophic import. Nor is this misconception con¬ fined to the ignorant and the unthinking, but men of learning, of culture and of great ability, frequently speak of nature's laws in such a manner as to at once show that their conceptions are entirely at variance with the real scientific meaning of the phrase. Nay, even some few scientists have at times attempted to make natural law imply something totally out of har¬ mony with their own scientific teachings, and this being so, we need express but little surprise at the very wide¬ spread misconceptions which obtain among those who, A fUNiVLRStTYl OF BRISTOL I LIBRARY _l</page><page sequence="2">2 LAW AND GOD. lacking scientific training, distort nature's laws to suit their altogether inadequate conceptions of nature's workings. If we try to discover the cause of these general, wide¬ spread misconceptions, we shall probably find out that men have unwittingly fallen into the most common of all errors—an error that may almost be termed a uni¬ versal error. Years ago Locke told us, in his work on " The Human Understanding," that " things themselves are to be considered as they are in themselves, and then they will show us in what way they are to be understood. For to ha-* e right conceptions about them we must bring our understandings to the inflexible nature and unalterable relations of things, and not en¬ deavor to bring things to any preconceived notions of our own." This is a truth which all may learn with advantage ; but to the earnest student, the seeker after nature's truths, it applies with particular fitness. Surely the aim of every truth-seeker should be to avoid imposing upon himself ; for this, as Locke truly re¬ marks, " is a far surer way to be made a fool of than by being exposed to the sophistry of others." Certainly nothing can be gained by distorting facts in order to make them agree with our distorted misconceptions, or by accepting the ideas of others at haphazard, upon trust, without ever having examined them, believing them simply upon the presumption that they are true and solid. To do this is, as Locke again says, nothing but " childish, senseless, shameful credulity." Let us, then, neither distort things to suit our own ideas nor yet accept the ideas of others without patient inquiry and consideration, but, removing ourselves as far as possible from prejudice and bias, try, as earnest students of nature, to discover the true significance of the ex¬ pression, " Natural law." By " nature," then, we mean that which everywhere manifests itself to us in phenomena—" the totality of phenomena including that which is necessary for the happening of past, present and future phenomena." By " law " we mean our knowledge of the methods of phenomenal operation, or, to put it perhaps a little more clearly, " nature's laws " are simply human for-</page><page sequence="3">LAW AND GOD. 6. mulas respecting the invariable order and sequence of events in nature. It may, however, be objected that a mere statement of the method of operation is not, and cannot be, accepted as a satisfactory explanation of the word law —that, indeed, the law is the cause of the operation or phenomenon, and not merely a statement of the method of operation. This objection will, however, come from those only whose ideas of law are entirely drawn from 23arliamentary or municipal enactments, and we shall maintain that the definition given is the only one that can legitimately be applied to the word "law " in con¬ junction with the word "nature." Nature's laws, as commonly understood, have no existence save in the minds of those believing in them, while the investing of them with intelligence, and making them the outcome of a " will," is the result of conceptions en¬ tirely out of accord with scientific thought and research. Not that there is absolutely no analogy between human enactments and nature's laws, but while parliamentary laws have no meaning apart from society, consisting, as they do, of commands addressed to voluntary agents —commands, too, which may be either obeyed or dis¬ obeyed—natural laws are not commands, but assertions respecting the discovered invariable order or sequence of natural events. In spite of civil laws for the punishment and sup¬ pression of crime, crime continues. The law remains, however. A thief may steal, but unless the theft be discovered and the thief be brought to justice, the civil law is powerless to punish him, though the moral law, which is a natural law, may do so. Civil laws may be disobeyed or repealed, but not so natural laws. It is a natural law that, under certain conditions, coal shall burn, gunpowder explode, heated air expand ; but if on some occasions we should, under like con¬ ditions, find the gunpowder refusing to explode and the coal refusing to burn, there would be an end at once to natural law respecting these phenomena, for in nature the law is a rule which admits of no possible exception. And yet, how frequently we hear state¬ ments such as the following: "If men will violate</page><page sequence="4">4 LAW AND GOD. nature's laws, they must learn to put up with the con¬ sequences." Or, again, how often we hear people talk of modifying nature's laws, controlling them, or of making one law subservient to another. Surely such ideas as these have been formulated at haphazard, without any examination, and are held simply upon the presumption that they are true and solid. Nor can we forget that these and similar observations are frequently made by men who in all other departments of learning are most careful to be exact, and who, accustomed to search out principles, would accept no explanation unless supported by a substantial weight of evidence and by inflexible logic. Let us take an instance. Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his admirable work, " The Study of Sociology," gives the following : " Canon Kingsley, in his address on ' The Limits of Exact Science,' says : ' You say the laws of matter are inevitable, so probably are the laws of human life. Be it so ; but in what sense are the laws of matter inevitable potentially or actually Even in the seemingly most uniform and universal law, where do we find the inevitable or the irresistible Is there not in nature a perpetual competition against law, of force against force, producing - the most endless and unexpected variety of results Cannot each law be interfered with at any moment by some other law, so that the first law, though it shall struggle for the mastery, shall be for an indefinite time utterly de¬ feated The law of gravity is immutable enough, but do all stones veritably fall to the earth Certainly not ; for if I chose to catch one and keep it in my hand, it remains there by laws, and the law of gravity is there, too, making the stone feel heavy in my hand ; but it has not fallen to the ground, and will not till I let it do so. So much, then, for the inevitable action of the law of gravity, as of others.' " Here, as Spencer remarks, Canon Kingsley differs from the scientific and the philosophic definition of a law of nature in regarding the law as of itself a power or force. Be¬ sides, a careful examination of the quotation given will reveal the fact that it carries with it its own refuta¬ tion. The learned Canon starts out to show that the</page><page sequence="5">LAW AND GOD. 0 law of gravity is not in every case actually immutable, but does not his own illustration rather prove the contrary We think it does. " The law of gravity," says he, " is there, too, making the stone feel heavy in my hand." But weight and gravity, as applied to the stone, are one and the same, the two words being convertible; and the fact that the Canon describes the stone as " feeling heavy" is in itself a proof that gravity was neither suspended nor modified, much less utterly defeated. To speak of muscular force as a higher or superior power as opposed to gravity is assuredly absurd. Suppose the stone had weighed a ton ; what then would have become of the " higher muscular power As an argument against the im¬ mutability of nature's laws the foregoing is altogether worthless. The force of gravity must be everywhere and at all times operating ; it cannot be suspended. If these laws were erratic in their behavior, if they were subject to suspension, modification and defeat, scien¬ tific progress would be absolutely impossible. It will be well, perhaps, in order that we may obtain more accurate conceptions of the subject under con¬ sideration, to pay considerable attention to the argu¬ ments of those holding -views entirely opposed to those we shall hereafter advance, and in order that we may not deceive ourselves and others by unfairly using our opponents we will take the propositions advanced by one who is frequently quoted in defence of the theo¬ logical interpretation of nature's laws. Some little time ago an American divine appeared among us, the purport of his visit being—if religious and other journals are to be relied upon—to " stem the tide of modern infidelity in England." Havingboth seen and heard this modern Jehu we are of opinion that his chief characteristic is audacity and not ability. And we may, by the way, be pardoned for expressing the opinion that in future these " infidel slayers " may find their time and their energy fully occupied in stem¬ ming the current of Atheistic and Agnostic thought in the land of Ingersoll. Among the published lectures of the " Boston orator " is one entitled " God in Natural Law," the tenor of which may be at once judged from</page><page sequence="6">b LAW AND GOD. the opening paragraph : " Suppose that to-morrow morning the sun should rise inscribed across its face in letters brighter than its own light, and such as to be visible throughout the illumined half of the world, with the words ' Holy Holy Holy Lord God of Hosts. Who was, Who is, and Who is to come.' Let this inscription be made intelligible to all languages and among all nations, one would think that under that awful light, as it passed over the continents and seas, and from people to people, the dusky tribes of heathen¬ dom -would quit their idols at once ; that in the high marts of civilisation, avarice, malice and dishonesty, serpents writhing colossal in the hollow streets as in caves, would wither to ashes ; that literature, politics and art on all their frozen hills would feel the approach of a vernal season beneath this touch of supernatural fire, and that before the slanting rays had passed thrice round the globe they would have pulled from off the burdened world something of the ulcerous growths of sin, and in time would turn into another channel the course of the dolorous and accursed ages." It has been remarked that few oftener blaspheme than those who are ever ready to cry blasphemy, and the foregoing passage would appeal' to confirm this. What business, we would ask, has a world, governed by natural laws which are the outcome of the " divine mind," to be covered with " ulcerous growths of sin " And if the mere appearance of these words upon the sun would produce such an universally bene¬ ficial effect, why do they not appear there God has punished the world from time to time, in order to bring about this desirable result ; he has slain his thousands, and even murdered his own son, knowing, as he must have known (or else Joseph Cook knows more than he), that in three days, by simply command¬ ing these words to appear on the sun, more effectual good would be accomplished than has hitherto been brought about by all the schemes of blunder and blood¬ shed, and which, so far as human redemption is con¬ cerned, have been totally unavailing. Surely, if the world be governed by a divine mind, there should be no necessity for a special advertisement of the magni-</page><page sequence="7">LAW AND GOD. / tude suggested in order to convince us of the fact. " To those who see with the secret eyes of science, the sun is thus inscribed ; and not the sun only, but every natural object—the seas, the mountains, the forest arches, every lowliest violet, the human frame." Putting on one side the illogical and the blas¬ phemous nature of the foregoing quotation (which for charity sake we ascribe to spiritual intoxication) we would ask, Is it true The assertion itself is so as¬ tounding that it almost takes away one's breath, par¬ ticularly so when we remember that for years past our ablest scientists have been accused by the theologians of providing a scientific basis for Agnosticism and Atheism ; that it is not true, will, we think, be generally admitted after careful consideration. "The govern¬ ment of the world," says Strauss, " must not be con¬ sidered as determined by an extramundane intelligence, but by one immanent in the cosmical forces and their relations." Are the laws according to which nature acts—now destroying, now rebuilding, now producing the most varied forms, both organic and inorganic— are they the result of an extramundane intelligence, or are they the outcome of cosmical forces and their rela¬ tions Let us see. In favor of the assertion that nature's laws bear wit¬ ness to a " divine mind," it is usually urged— 1st. That in the universe we know of two things* only, viz., matter and mind. 2nd. That matter is inert, and cannot originate force and motion. 3rd. That force and motion must, therefore, originate in mind. 4th. That nature's laws, in their methods of opera¬ tion, display intelligence—mind. That mind is God. The first proposition is one to which many will readily give assent. No one, we think, will be bold enough to postulate the existence of any third thing. From time immemorial it has been an axiom that there is no tertlum quid. We shall, however, have yet to * We use the word " things " simply for want of a better term. It is not a happy one to apply to " mind."</page><page sequence="8">&lt;S LAW AND GOD. point out that the value of the proposition depends entirely upon what is meant by the terms used, viz., " matter " and " mind." The second proposition—that matter, being inert, cannot produce force or motion—is generally supported by pointing out that huge blocks of matter—boulder- stones, for instance—lie now where they have lain ever since we first knew of their existence, and that there they will continue to lie until moved by some power outside themselves.* Proposition No. 3—that force and motion must originate outside of matter—is the natural corollary of the truth of the previous proposition, and so needs no further arguments in its support. The fourth proposition—that order and adjustment obtain in the universe, and that the order and adjust¬ ment are the manifestations of an overruling intelli¬ gence—is a proposition held to be so self-evident as to require no proof whatever. Indeed, it is frequently asserted that we have only to open our eyes in order to be convinced of its correctness. Having thus stated the propositions and the grounds usually urged for their acceptance, we must now examine them carefully, and so find out whether they are really of a character substantial enough to compel our acquiescence. We think not. The value of proposition No. 1 depends, as previously stated, upon our conception of what mind really is. The existence of matter as an entity is now univer¬ sally admitted. " Science from the first has steadily pointed in the direction of the reality of matter, and it has been invariably found necessary to assume such reality as an hypothesis, if for no other purpose, in order to obtain a basis for the interpretation of the facts of every science."! But what is mind Sir W. Hamilton says it is " that which perceives, thinks, feels, wills, desires." This, however, is no answer to oar question. We want to know what it is that thinks, wills, desires, etc. The physiologist tells us that it is * See " God in Natural Law," Joseph Cook. f Ward's "Dynamic Sociology," vol. i.,p. 222.</page><page sequence="9">LAW AND GOD. the brain, and not some supposititious metaphysical entity altogether beyond our knowledge. To him such an hypothesis is as unfounded in observation as it is superfluous in thought. Dr. Maudsley, in his " Physio¬ logy of Mind," p. 126, says : " By observation of mental phenomena, wherever displayed and of whatever sort, by experiment, by reasoning, by all the means of knowing which serve him in other scientific inquiries, he has come to the assured conviction that mind does not exist in nature apart from brain ; all his experience of it is in connexion with brain, just as all his expe¬ rience of gravitation is in connexion with matter. He has never met with gravitation without a heavy body, chemical force without chemical substances, life with¬ out organic matter, nor thought without nervous tissue." Mind with the physiologist is simply a general term denoting the sense of those functions of the brain which are accompanied by consciousness and which are commonly designated thought, feeling and will. It is with him impossible to conceive of these func¬ tions as other than the properties of extremely com¬ plex organised bodies. " To deal with mind as a force in nature apart from the consideration of matter through the changes of which it is manifested, is truly no less vain and absurd than it would confessedly be to attempt to handle electricity and gravitation as forces apart from the changes in matter by which alone we know them." We know it is frequently urged that it is altogether incompatible for the intellectual and the physical phenomena to co-inhere in the same sub¬ stratum ; but may we not well ask, with Professor Ferrier, who is to dictate to matter what phenomena or what qualities shall inhere in what substances, or what effects shall result from what causes Priestly said, " it is a rigid canon of Newtonian logic never to multiply causes without necessity," and we should adhere to a single substance until it be shown that mind is incompatible with the properties of matter. The burden of proof of an immaterial agent intervening somewhere, and where it intervenes, lies with those who make the assertion. We do not feel justified in fabricating an hypothesis altogether inconsistent with</page><page sequence="10">w 10 LAW AND GOD. what we know to be the orderly development of nature, and which postulates an agent not proved to be neces¬ sary. Nor would it be reasonable, after assuming such an agent, to call upon those who rejected it to disprove it. They certainly do enough if they show the non¬ necessity of the hypothesis. Divorce mind from matter we cannot, try how we will. True, we can think of matter only in terms of mind, but then it is equally true that we can think of mind only in terms of matter, as Spencer says :* " When we have pushed our explorations of the first to the uttermost limit, we are referred to the second for a final answer ; and when we have got the final answer of the second, we are re¬ ferred back to the first for an interpretation of it." The concluding remarks of Professor Bain, in his admirable little work entitled " Mind and Body," are particularly emphatic, and, backed by the close investi¬ gation of the question which the book everywhere indicates, may be held to be conclusive. He says : "The arguments for two substances have now lost their validity ; they are no longer compatible with ascertained science or with clear thinking. The one substance possessing the two properties, physical and mental, would appear to comply with all the exigences of the case." Here, then, we feel bound to admit that the phenomena of mind must in the end come to be regarded as relations of matter. More re¬ fined, more subtle, it is true, than any other relations— adjustments of internal to external relations of a most complex character ; adjustments, however, which abso¬ lutely require a material basis for their manifestation. Thus, while we agree that he indeed would be a bold person who should postulate the existence of any third thing, we cannot but recognise that he too would be equally bold who should dare to state the existence of a second. Propositions Nos. 2 and 3 may best be considered together, for that which proves No. 2 goes a long way towards confirming No. 3. Failing No. 2, No. 3 falls out as being altogether unnecessary. * '• Principles of Psychology," vol. i, p. G72.</page><page sequence="11">LAW AND GOD. 11 " The inertness of matter," is an expression, as well abused, perhaps, as any other in scientific use. But,, shades of Galileo, Kepler and Newton, is this the dark phrase that is still to becloud our vision and distort our perceptions of nature's phenomena " The world moves !" exclaimed Galileo. No one doubts the fact now, but, for the statement of it, the grand old investi¬ gator suffered imprisonment, and alas alas was con¬ demned to burial in unconsecrated ground. Said Kep¬ ler, " The world (together with other planets) not only moves, but moves in regular order, and in an eliptical orbit ;" and Newton, in words that sound like a clarion peal sounding the death-knell of propositions 2 and 3, says : " Yes, and it cannot help it, for the fact is, all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their masses, and decreasing inversely as the squares of their distances." Force cannot be divorced from matter. We know matter only through its force manifestations. Intimately united to matter, force re¬ volves in the same never-ending cycles. Neither can be produced nor destroyed. The indestructability of matter necessarily involves the persistence of its rela¬ tion, Force, while the eternity of their duration and the infinity of their extent, forbids the possibility of repose in nature. Nature knows no rest : in nature nothing is still. Conceive of motion apart from a moving body we cannot, and it is equally impossible to think of energy without, at the same time, conceiving some body of which the energy is a relation. To point out, as did Joseph Cook in his lecture on " God in Natural Law," huge blocks of matter, great boulder stones, still lying in the fields where we saw them lying during our early childhood, is assuredly no proof of the inertness of matter. Every gleam of light, every breath of air, no matter how gentle, each tiny rain-drop—all these have, by their combined efforts, been working great modifications in the stones themselves, and these agencies—material agencies be it remembered—will of themselves suffice in time to remove a block of granite, so large, so heavy, as to defy the power of man to change its position. Such agencies will, in the course of ages, bring about the effectual disintegration of the hugest</page><page sequence="12">w 12 LAW AND GOD. boulder, so that the place that knows it now shall in time know it no more. Besides, may we not ask with advantage how came the boulder stones to the positions they now occupy Surely it is mere childishness to suppose that they have ever lain as we now see them, or that they will always continue to do so. Could we but go back through some 300,000 years of time, we might discover that, though these blocks are so large as to defy the strength of man, they were not powerful enough to resist the energy of frozen water, which none will fail to recognise as a material agency. To speak of these stones as though they were absolutely devoid of energy, is to be wilfully blind to the lessons the stones themselves might teach. In a sense we may say that material bodies resist, and for a time appa¬ rently successfully resist, those combined energies which must eventually bring about their destruction ; but resistance to energy implies possession of energy. Try to break one of the great boulders, and yon will soon discover they are the very oppposite of inert— using the word as implying devoid of force. To break them you must use energy. Does it not follow that whatever force you require to separate the particles one from another, with the same force they cleave to one another To declare that " inherent energy," as attri¬ buted to matter, is a daring and unwarrantable assump¬ tion, is to declaim without reason. Nature nowhere exhibits repose : " its whole existence is a constant cycle, in which every motion, the consequent of a preceding motion, becomes the immediate cause of an equivalent succeeding one. Nowhere is there a gap ; nowhere either loss or gain. No motion in nature proceeds from or passes into nothing ; and as in the material world every individual form can only realise its exis¬ tence by drawing its materials from the immense store¬ house of matter, so does every motion originate from the equally immense store-house of forces to which, sooner or later, the borrowed quantity of force is again returned." Nothing in the world, says Cotta, justifies us in assuming the existence per se of forces indepen¬ dent of the bodies from which they proceed, and upon which they act. Separate force from matter we cannot.</page><page sequence="13">LAW AND GOD. IS It is a quality eternal, inalienable and untransferable. The eternity of matter, and the necessary eternity of dts relation, force, forms the scientific basis of modern materialism. If matter is active and not inert, if its every particle is in motion of itself, and if all the varieties of motion with which we are acquainted are ultimately derived from the motions of the particles themselves, then an energising principle, as a separate entity apart from matter itself, becomes an untenable fallacy because an unnecessary factor. Thus we feel ourselves driven to the conclusion that energy must be regarded as both potentially and actually the relation of matter. Actually, in that it is even now producing all the phenomena of which we form a part; poten¬ tially, in that it possesses the capabilities of producing all the varied phenomena of the future. If it be again asserted, as it has been asserted in the past, that these powers or properties are incompatible with our know¬ ledge of matter, I say, fearlessly and distinctly—No. This much is certain—wherever matter is there are these powers and properties also, and if these powers and properties are its own, we can have no stronger- proof of the fact than that it always and everywhere manifests them. Thus propositions 2 and 3 are seen to be based upon a fallacy so untenable that the marvel is it should ever have obtained at all. The propositions themselves must fall with the exposure of the stupid assumptions upon which they are based. Our very knowledge of matter is obtained through the forces with which matter affects us. As Spencer says: "Webecome conscious of matter only through that resistance which it opposes to our muscular energy—we become conscious of the permanence of matter only through the permanence of this resistance, either as immediately or as mediately proved to us." Proposition No. 4, " That order and adjustment ob¬ tain in the universe, and that the order and adjustment are manifestations of an over-ruling intelligence," is a proposition which, in spite of the fact that it is supposed to be so self-evident as to require no proof, appears to the student of material science astounding in its</page><page sequence="14">14 LAW AND GOD. audacity. That order obtains in the universe all will readily admit; but what is gained by the admission It may be a profoundly wise statement that two and two make four, but then two and two cannot be three, and it is equally impossible that they can be five. What now, do we know of the order and adjustment mani¬ fested save as the outcome of the properties and powers of matter itself The energy of matter being what it is, the results must be what they are. The order becomes a necessity. Had the varieties of energy been different, the results, too, must have been different; hut since the results must have agreed with the ener¬ gies by which they were produced, order and adjust¬ ment must still have been equally imperative. Ask any schoolboy why orange groves and vineyards do not flourish in England as in more southern climes, and he will at once tell you that the climatic conditions of this country are not suitable for the production of these fruits. If all things are creatures of circumstances— and natural law tells us they are—then between crea¬ ture and environment there must be agreement, and order and adjustment are seen to be necessary resul¬ tants. Owing to our extremely limited knowledge, it may to us appear marvellous that matter, with its own powers, should succeed in producing all the wonderful phenomena with \vhich we are acquainted, but then the mystery proves no super-organic agency. To ex¬ press surprise at the existence of order, is as though one should expect to find icebergs at the tropics or palm-trees and vines at the north pole were there not some over-ruling providence preventing their destruc¬ tion by suppressing their roving propensities. Nor must we forget that order and disorder, as applicable to universal phenomena, are relative ex¬ pressions only. The cesspool of filth which to us appears the one blot destroying the order of the otherwise perfectly harmonious landscape, may be a perfect paradise to the myriads of loathsome creatures sporting, revelling in its muddy depths, though it be to everything else around the birthplace of disease and death. It is inconceivable that any ordering in¬ telligence should jeopardise the welfare of the higher</page><page sequence="15">LAW AND GOD. 15 creatures merely to find an abiding place for crea¬ tures not only useless, but positively repulsive and obnoxious, to say nothing of the disfigurement of the otherwise beautiful scene, a fault which, if exhibited in an oil-painting, would be held to show the greatest want of good taste on the part of the artist. Thus the very order which is necessary for the existence of one creature may prove to be the disorder which will bring about the destruction of many others. How fre¬ quently the scientific student is puzzled when, observing nature's methods of operation in his early life, he most probably was taught that nature was ruled and guided by an all-wise, all-powerful and all-loving God, and that nature in its every department reflected the per¬ fect attributes of its ruler. He supposed that nature's methods would be the most orderly method con¬ ceivable, and constitute the most perfect pattern for him to copy. The economy of " nature's laws " had with him become a trite and meaningful phrase. He speaks of nature's adaptations as showing conclusively the existence of an all-wise adapter, and is further prepared to maintain that this adapter is the source of all the intelligence which to him nature everywhere manifests, while, were the same misdirection and lavish waste of energy, the same evident want of economy, exhibited by any business acquaintance, he would in all probability regard him as the most utterly hopeless, the most fatally injudicious, of all business men. As our scientific student proceeds with his investigations, his preconceived opinions receive shock after shock. His mind is disabused of false ideas one by one. He discovers that the supposed order and economy of nature are, indeed, highly illusory, that the deadliest of strife obtains where he had been wont to think was a reign of perfect peace. Energy is most lavishly expended for the most trivial results ; indeed, nature's incongruities and paradoxes may be said to meet him at every new scientific turn. The struggle for life bears witness to the most horrible suffering and slaughter, so much so that myriads of living creatures may be said to exist in a state of constant terror, sur¬ rounded as they are on every hand by enemies count-</page><page sequence="16">16 LAW AND GOD. less in number. Not a single creature is known to him but its very existence implies the destruction of countless other forms. Nor are the inferior always sacrificed for the maintenance of the superior, for parasites innumerable are seen to infest and destroy organisms incomparably their superiors, until at last he feels that, with others, he has erred in " Trusting God was love indeed, And love creation's final law, While nature, red in tooth and claw, With ravin shrieked against the creed." Among the higher orders of animal life the same in¬ congruities present themselves. Countless numbers of human beings are born only to die immediately after birth, bearing witness to wasted vitality and a vast amount of purposeless suffering, while thousands are doomed to an existence cruel in its painfulness, through the incomplete and bungling manner in which nature has done its work. Many permanent institu¬ tions in civilised countries are so many evidences to the manner in which science is continually correcting the blunders of nature, and the terrible struggle for existence so visible among the masses of any great community has its counterpart in every department of living beings. The journey from childhood to old age presents numberless struggles against the adverse con¬ ditions in the environment, and death at last proclaims the triumph of the external over the internal relations. As Ward says (" Dynamic Sociology," vol. ii., p. 15) : " The degree of correspondence between man and his environment, notwithstanding his sagacity and his intelligence, his artful devices and protective institu¬ tions, is not so great but that a large amount of friction constantly exists. This friction not only decimates his ranks and brings mankind to premature death after the manner of the fishes and hares, but what should really be regarded as worse—since the rapid multiplication of individuals could not long continue, and would not be economically desirable—it involves a vast amount of physical and mental suffering, and prevents that state of universal well-being which should be the highest aim of life."</page><page sequence="17">LAW AND GOD. 17 The march of a nation from barbarism to civilisation is attended by similar incidents, only greater in extent and more lasting. Those struggles which characterise the development of the individual or of the species characterise too the development of the nation. The process is one of constant building, pulling down again and rebuilding, and nothing approaching economy is seen from the beginning to the end. It is one lavish expenditure of energy, a squandering with a wanton disregard for the future, a disregard which we can understand only on the hypothesis that nature acts un¬ consciously, and. that her resources are absolutely in¬ exhaustible. That nature's operations are thus devoid of consciousness is the opinion now generally ex¬ pressed by reliable scientific and philosophic writers. " Nature," says Ward, " must be regarded as uncon¬ scious. Throughout all the changes which have resulted in the evolution of man the process has been purely automatic. No thought, no ideas, no plan, no purpose has entered into the great cosmic movement. As the winds blindly obey the physical laws of the earth's special character, due to its motions,* its proximity to the sun, its orbital inclination and its methodless land and water distribution, as the clouds gather, break, and pour their contents back upon the earth, and then vanish or go flying across the sky, impelled by wild, senseless and reckless forces ; as the cataract plunges and the volcano belches in obedience to stern physical impulses to which no one thinks, except metaphorically, of attributing motive or in¬ telligence, so all the great secular processes of nature, including the development of organic forms and of man, have been impelled by blind and mindless energies, guided by no intelligence or conscious power, either from within or from without. The inherent motions of the ultimate atoms of primordial matter—as eternal, uncreatable, and indestructible as the atoms themselves—must be regarded as the all-sufficient cause of all the results we see, however complex and wonder¬ ful we consider those results to be." The argument frequently urged by those who favor the teleological or theological argument "that it is B</page><page sequence="18">18 LAW AND GOD. extremely improbable that nature's phenomena should show such wonderful order unless there be a supreme guiding intelligence, will, after a consideration of the above facts, lose much of its force. It does seem as though the counter-argument would be much more powerful, that such stragglings, such waste, mis¬ direction, destruction and want of adaptation, most con¬ clusively prove the absence of any superintending supernatural intelligence. Besides,the argument—if it is worthy to be called such—of improbability is really most childish, for the improbability in our mind may be entirely due to our ignorance of the potentialities and capacities of matter and its relations. Further, may we not urge that " improbability" counts for nothing, after the fact, many things happen which previous to their occurrence may to us have appeared the most improbable of all events, but when once these things have taken place all talk of previous impro¬ bability is so much wasted time and energy. If we venture to take a ticket in a prize drawing, in which there are a thousand tickets and only one pris?, the chances or the improbabilities against our drawing the prize will be as 999 to 1, but when once we have drawn the prize what do all those improbabilities count for? If we carry this argument to its logical con¬ clusion we shall see how utterly unreasonable it is ; for, if in our case the improbabilities were as 999 to 1, so with every other holder of a ticket in the lottery would they be the same, and thus, if the improbability argument is valid, we must believe that no person could possibly draw the prize, because the odds were in every case 999 to L That certain effects result from certain causes, and that like effects result from like causes—which com¬ prises the whole of natural law—is true, but this is no proof whatever that these particular causes were intelligently arranged to produce their particular effects: these are from pure necessity, and, whether they appear to us orderly or appear disorderly, whether they give pleasure or give pain, nature is equally unmindful- unconscious. I jump into the river to bathe myself in the cool, refreshing water. Suppose I cannot swim,</page><page sequence="19">LAW AND GOD. 19 now, though I have gone there only for the express pur¬ pose of a little harmless, nay, even healthful, pleasure, in obedience to my own natural desires. I unfortu¬ nately get beyond my depth ; the waters overwhelm me, and I am drowned. Another person jumps into the water for the purpose of saving the life of a child ; he is not a powerful swimmer, and, with the added weight of the child clinging around him, he cannot battle with the current. He is a hero filled with pure, noble and courageous motives ; but the water ruth¬ lessly drowns him. Another is thrown into the rushing river by a villainous murderer, who, after robbing him of his treasures, consigns his victim to the deep, dark stream, whispering to him the comforting farewell, " Dead men tell no tales," and the water drowns him. In each of these cases nature works equally effectually. In each case its law shows the same lack of discrimina¬ tion, which is the essential element of intelligence. The innocent pleasure-seeker, the noble hero and hap¬ less victim, are alike effectually put to death. The laws of nature are just as ready to assist the murderer as they are to drown the hero and prevent the saving of an innocent child's life. Not that all nature's laws are thus murderous, but where they are not, they pre sent exactly the same lack of intelligence. Take the following illustration. Mr. B., desiring to put an end to his existence, and having repeatedly tried to do so and failed, resolved on another, and, as he thought, final effectual attempt. Providing himself with a rope, with poison and with a revolver, he, early one morning, wended his way to a cliff overhanging the deep, deep sea. Securing the rope to a stake driven firmly in the cliff, he first placed the noose around his neck, then, rapidly swallowing the poison, he, with revolver in hand, jumped over the precipice. In his eagerness to end his life he fired the revolver, but in the unsteadiness caused by excitement, the bullet which was intended to pierce his head, missed its mark and cut the rope in twain. The possibility of this occur¬ rence had, however, been foreseen, and now surely the water will complete the work of destruction. Not at all. The salt water acted as an emetic, the poison was</page><page sequence="20">20 LAW AND GOD. vomited, a stupidly perverse wave lifted our would-be suicide high on to the rocks, not much the worse for his bath. Strongly convinced of nature's obstinacy, he plodded homeward his weary way, more than ever con¬ vinced that nature was determined perversely to baulk his intentions. These strange paradoxes present them¬ selves to us only so long as we attempt to regard nature as guided by a conscious intelligence. There is as much adaptation in those processes which produce the earthquake, with all its destructive influences, as there is in those processes which eventually give us the beautiful landscape, with all its peaceful harmony. We have seen nature, throughout the early months of spring, clothing the fruit-trees with the fairest blos¬ soms, giving promise of the most abundant harvest to follow, and we have witnessed months of labour both of nature and of man most ruthlessly made abortive through a single night's frost occurring in the later springtime. Could we for a single moment admit the intelligence of a gardener who, after carefully tending his garden with the greatest care, should, just as the beneficent results of his labors were beginning to mani¬ fest themselves, shake all blossoms from the trees, and trample all the tender shoots of the growing plants back into the earth We imagine not. Yet so does nature frequently act. True, in nature there is much that is beautiful, but the beauty is too often disfigured to allow us for a moment to imagine that behind there is a ruling power, a guiding intelligence. The only intelligence we know of in the universe is that intelligence which nature herself produces. Poten¬ tially nature may be said to possess the materials for all intelligence, though she herself be absolutely insen¬ sible. " Mind is merely a relation and thought, a mode of material activity. Science has inverted the ideas of the past. It is nature that produces intelligence and not intelligence that produces nature. This is perhaps one of the most difficult truths for the non- scientific mind to grasp. But when once an idea of the real nature of intelligence is obtained, when once this highest product of evolution is found to conform to specific natural laws, when those subtle manifestations</page><page sequence="21">LAW AND GOD. 21 of forces which have been described as sleeping in the stone, dreaming in the animal and awaking in the man are found to be particular qualities of particular aggregations of matter, then it will be seen how immense becomes the difficulty of conceiving mind as other than a relation of matter itself. The immediate connection between brain-substance and mental phe¬ nomena cannot now be denied. That physical pain —due to mental labor—is confined to the head is a fact to which every student can bear witness. That there is a correspondence between the size of the brain and the mental capacity is pointed out by every writer on mental physiology, and that injury to the brain affects the mental powers is a fact now too well established to be for a moment disputed except by some spiritualistic fanatic. " That the hemispheres of the brain are the seats of the intellectual faculties : viz., Emotion, passion, and volition, and at the same time essential to conscious¬ ness, may be considered proved by the following established facts, first in the animal kingdom a cor¬ respondence is observed between the quantity of grey matter, the depth of the convolutions, and the sagacity of the animal. At birth this grey matter is very defec¬ tive, the convolutions being merely superficial fissures confined to the surface of the brain, and as the grey matter increases, intelligence develops. Vivisection shows that by slicing away the brain the animal be¬ comes more and more stupid, in proportion to the quantity of the grey matter removed. Chemical expe¬ rience proves that, where disease commences at the circumference of the brain and proceeds to the centre, the mental faculties are affected first, whereas, in those diseases which commence at the centre and proceed to the circumference, the mental faculties are affected last." — Professor Hughes Bennett, " Encyclopasdia Britannica." Thus the complete dependence of the mental upon the physical conditions may now be said to be indis¬ putable. Here science thoroughly inverts the theolo¬ gical proposition. Instead of all things having their origin in mind, science shows us that mind, properly</page><page sequence="22">22 LWV AND GOD. regarded, is a particular relation of complexly-organised bodies. The only intelligence we know of in the universe is the intelligence of organised beings, and unless by the word " intelligence" as applied to nature's laws the same is meant as when we apply the word to our fellow-man, we surely have no right to use it. It has been well observed that the true place which mind fills in nature is the most important fact to be learned in the study of philosophy, and this is un¬ doubtedly correct. No ideas have been more productive of mischievous consequences than have the false ideas which obtained with regard to life and mind. That these- are both derivative, that mind itself is but the product of the higher stages of organic evolution appears now to be conclusively established—all modern scientific research points in this direction ; indeed it is the conclusion now generally admitted by all the higher authorities in the physical and psychical sciences. Vital and mental phenomena are but mani¬ festations of certain organised bodies. Upon this point we cannot too emphatically dwell, for here it is that a divergence from the truth is fraught with most unfortunate consequences. The world within us, like the world without us, is ruled by law; but law merely implies that order or sequence of events which is the necessary outcome of the powers and properties of matter itself, as we have previously pointed out. Fol¬ lowing the rigid canons of Newtonian logic, we have no right to multiply causes without necessity: "Matter is already in the field as an acknowledged entity. A guiding intelligence is not so unmistakably in the field."* Assuredly we are not entitled to postulate another cause as long as it is possible to account for the phenomena by a cause already in existence, and which possibility has never yet been disproved. Thus the attempt to prove the existence of a God by citing the orderly methods of nature's operations most miserably fails, and proposition No. 4 follows its pre¬ decessors 1, 2 and 3 only to complete a list of failures. * '• Can the Design Argument be Vindicated," p. 22.</page><page sequence="23">m* LAW AND GOD. 23 Orderly operations produce mind, and not mind orderly operations.!-t * \ The recognition of universal law is a necessity of the greatest magnitude and importance to the seeker after truth. To him the present, the past and the future, in time like the near and the remote in space, are all indissolubly linked together. Even the apparently diverse sciences—astronomy, geology, chemistry, bio¬ logy and psychology—encroach each one upon the domains of the others, and each one requires the others for the completion of its own facts. Step by step science is removing the delusions of the past. Events which at one time were looked upon as visitations of divine displeasure, can now be shown to be dependent upon natural causes ; and what is often of far greater importance to us, they are in many cases amenable to natural remedies. No longer do men rely upon fastings and prayers for the removal of national calamities (at least with the exception of some few particularly .priest- ridden countries). If, says an eminent writer—" if all the religious training the world has ever received should be concentrated upon one community, and thoroughly indoctrinated into the mind of every member of it, it would be utterly useless as a means of carrying it through an ordeal which threatened it with famine or destruction from climatic influences. Equally futile would be the prayers of the world in such an emergency. Not one of all the wonderful contrivances invented by man for extorting subsistence from nature, for destroying the enemies to man's triumphant pro¬ gress, for multiplying the objects of desire, or for neu¬ tralising the physical forces operating adversely to human life, has ever been attributed to che labors of the priesthood as such, and none of these blessings can come either directly or indirectly from that source." Religious processions, gorgeous ecclesiastical shows, have proved all unavailing as protections from the ravages of the cholera in Spain ; while in England, owing to our superior sanitary conditions, and conse¬ quent purified towns, it has been made almost, if not altogether, impossible for such a disease to gain any foot-hold.</page><page sequence="24">mm 24 LAW AND GOD. In 1853 the presbytery of Edinburgh addressed, through the Moderator, a letter to the Queen, drawing attention to the ravages of the cholera—which during that year had visited many parts of Europe, and was then making havoc among some of the badly-fed, badly-housed, and not over-cleanly people of Scotland —and asking that a day of national fast should be ap¬ pointed on royal authority. To this request Lord Palmerston wrote, suggesting " that the best course which the people of the country could pursue, to de¬ serve that the further progress of the cholera should ' be stayed, will be to employ the interval that will elapse between the present time and the beginning of next spring, in planning and executing measures by which those portions of cities which are inhabited by the poorest classes, and which, from the nature of things, must most need jrarification and improvement, may be freed from those causes and sources of con¬ tagion which, if allowed to remain, will infallibly breed pestilence and be fruitful in death, in spite of all the prayers and fastings of a united, but inactive, nation." Step by step that extended knowledge, which we call " Science," has dissipated the horrible delusions of the past—the arbitrary finger which was once sup¬ posed to guide the events of the universe, has nowhere been discovered. The more our knowledge has become extended, the more necessary has it become for us to repudiate the idea of a supernatural influence. The recognition of uniformity of relations among phe¬ nomena, which, as Spencer observes, is the recognition of law, makes such an idea altogether untenable. The rain falls and makes the grass to grow ; but, as Aristotle said in his " Physics Auscultationes " (quoted by Dar¬ win in his " Origin of Species ") : " The rain does not fall in order to make the corn grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer's corn when threshed out of doors." To the scientist, the causal chain is unbroken —every cause produces its effect, which effect, in its turn, becomes the cause of other effects ; to him nature's operations present an uninterrupted sequence. Ancient superstitions, once universal, are now surely, if slowly, dying away. Time was when every change</page><page sequence="25">LAW AND GOD. 25 in nature was attributed to the changing moods of a superintending deity, who delighted in torturing the creatures he had made, and whose anger could only be appeased by bloody sacrifices and most inhuman aus¬ terities. These ideas science is most effectually de¬ throning, while that theology which upheld them is rapidly losing its hold over the intellect of man, which it has too long held in the most cruel and servile bondage. The infinite power of nature has, by the theologian, been endowed with the petty and vulgar functions of an earthly ruler ; it has been by him re¬ presented as meddling here and interfering there, now rewarding, now punishing. Such notions are entirely out of accord with our present knowledge. "With it they do not assimilate ; they are incongruous ; their concord is gone. Everything is against them. They stand alone. There is nothing left with which they harmonise. The whole scope and tendency of modern thought forces upon our minds conceptions of regu¬ larity and of law to which they are diametrically op¬ posed. Even those who cling to them do so from the influence of tradition rather than from complete and unswerving belief. That child-like and unhesitating faith, with which the doctrine of interposition was once received, is succeeded by a cold and lifeless assent, very different from the enthusiasm of former times. Soon, too, this will vanish. Then will men cease to be terrified by phantoms which their own ignorance has reared."* That law is universal is the irresistible conclusion to which experience andresearch are gradually conducting us. Indeed, it is this habitual recognition of law which may be said to distinguish modern thought from ancient thought. The untutored savage can only think of each phenomenon, or group of phenomena, as caused by some separate personal agent. To him the storm and the sun¬ shine are sent in arbitrary succession, and it is from these fetishistic conceptions that modern theological ideas have been evolved. The days have now passed for be¬ lieving that these occurrences are due to arbitrary fiats * Buckle, Hist. Civ., Vol. HI., p. 481.</page><page sequence="26">26 LAW AND GOD. of some supernatural being. One after another those interpretations, which ascribe phenomena to a will, analogous to the human will and working by methods analogous to human methods, are being abandoned. The " creation by God" has given place to the more reliable hypothesis of evolution by law. " It is no mere theory," admits the Duke of Argyle, " but a fact as cer¬ tain as any other fact in science, that creation has had a history"—a history which we may now intelligibly read. The histories of the solar system, the world with its plants and animals, including man, with his language, writing, painting, manufactures, commerce, literature, and government, are histories which at every point conform to law—an unbroken succession of changes, carrying us from a state of simple homogeneity to the present heterogeneous state of extreme complexity. The universality of law is irresistibly driven home to us when we perceive that even the discovery of these laws has itself confirmed to law. The earliest dis¬ covered laws were those which were most common, simple and conspicuous, while those which were rare, complex and unobtrusive, were necessarily latest in their discovery. It is impossible to contemplate the various stages of scientific discovery without being forced to recognise the necessity of the processes through which those stages have been reached. The simple truth of Galileo that the world moves necessarily precedes the more complex discovery of Kepler, that it—together with other bodies—not only moves, but moves in regular order and in an elliptical orbit, while these laws them¬ selves are merely the steps by which we rise to the greater and still more complex law of Newton, that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the quantity of matter in each, and decreasing inversely as the squares of the distances. In every department of science the same truth holds good, the progress of the discovery of nature's laws has accorded with the law of all progress.* * " Progress," by W. W. C. See Progress, Nov., 1884.</page><page sequence="27">LAW AND GOD. 27 Enough has now, we think, been said to show how impossible it is to escape the conclusion that the uni¬ verse is governed by universal and immutable laws. Whether to us her operations appear cruel, or whether they appear kind, orderly or, to us, disorderly, we cannot escape the conclusion that from the minutest events which take place around us, to those operations which extend throughout the material universe, there is no gap, no interruption, no interference—an universe permeated by one glorious principle of undeviating regularity. This is the reign under which all live, there is no denying it. The world within us, the world around us, are ruled by law. Our bodies, our minds, our every thought—we may be unconscious of the causes by which our thought and our actions are deter¬ mined, but that they are determined none can deny. That the recognition of the reign of law is fatal to the current doctrines and dogmas of the theological schools will be readily perceived. With this growing recogni¬ tion ancient beliefs have one by one become extinct. Primitive anthropomorphism, which still in a modified form affects the thoughts of man, will, e'er long, become entirely of the past. In dismissing the gods of the Greeks, who, in their eternal youth and beauty, passed a joyous existence in a poetic heaven, we may experi¬ ence feelings of regret as one who leaves the land, where in the early morn the peasantry " Seated in their chariots of Homeric pattern, Like the ancient Isis on the basso-relievos of Egma," pour in from the highways from Thebes and Marathon, to return to stern, sordid duties of commercial city life. No such regrets, however, shall attend us as we dismiss the frowning, gloomy and angry Jehovah, who punished man for a sin he had previously ordained should be committed; who arranges an impossible flood to destroy the inhabitants of the earth for being what he had made them ; who gave to his chosen people laws entailing the most inhuman cruelties ; who would not be reconciled to the people whom he had made until he had saturated himself in the blood of his only son ; who rewards unthinking belief and punishes thoughtful</page><page sequence="28">28 LAW AND GOD. doubt, and who will ultimately condemn the greater portion of mankind to an eternity of damnation. The dismissal of such a God is like the dismissal of the frowning and threatening storm-cloud, leaving the earth to be suffused with the bright, clear rays of the unobscured sun. It has been urged that the belief in a God or in gods has been of the highest importance in lending a sanction to virtue and morality. This, however, is scarcely borne out by ascertainable facts. All conceptions of gods are undoubtedly productions of human fancies and perceptions, and among all peoples the gods are invariably formed after their particular individualities. Says Feuerbach : " An extraneous and superhuman God is nothing but an extraneous and supernatural self, a subjective being, placed by transgressing its limits above the objective nature of man." A knowledge of facts undoubtedly bears out this idea. The gods of the savage nations—nations who may be described as unmoral rather than immoral—always partake of the savagery and immorality characteristic of the savages themselves. What degree of perfection, what sanction to virtue or to morality, what elevating tendencies could be ascribed to the belief of the Fijians in their gods, whose characteristics are sufficiently depicted in their names—" Woman-Stealer," " Adul¬ terer," " Brain-Eater," etc. Nor is there any need to" draw our illustration from savage nations. That men are not deterred from the commission of immoral acts by theological beliefs, is proved by the record of crime in every civilised country on the face of the earth. Indeed, one may safely assert that the criminals of our own country are invariably believers in the prevailing faith. Here, at any rate, the non-believers certainly have the best of it. Usually well informed, and frequently ardent students of the sciences, there exists no more exem¬ plary class of citizens. No hope of reward allures them ; no fear of punishment affrights them. Recognising that all efforts expended in attempting to influence imaginary beings will be so much energy withdrawn from the legitimate work of ameliorating the conditions</page><page sequence="29">LAW AND GOD. 29 of mankind, they make this life and this world their care and study, the only reward looked for being the natural one of life made happier, and a world brighter, for their having lived in it. To pretend that a non-believer in theology must necessarily live an immoral life is a gratuitous and insolent assertion which in the face of facts deserves and needs no refutation. It could only proceed from those who were either absolutely ignorant or wilfully malicious, and in either case the assertion possesses neither force nor value. With truth might we urge that religion has done much to foster and preserve many of the lower and baser characteristics of mankind; for ages it made a persecuting cruelty its chief ally, while in its doctrines it possesses much to kindle and foster the same spirit. It has misrepresented human nature, and prevented man from occupying that vantage ground of happiness to which his natural experiences would have led him. It has attracted his attention from those things which might have made this world a paradise, and has sent him away in winged flights of imagina¬ tion into unsubstantial regions of airy nothingness. It has punished man for his belief, setting father against son and the son against the father. It has rent the air with the cries of murdered heretics, robbed citizens of their liberty and debarred the noblest cham¬ pions of liberty of their civil rights. Thank man its days are numbered. Falsehood, too long enthroned by stately powers, must fall before the advancing republic of Truth. Then man, relying on his own strength, shall stand erect, treading depravity, hypo¬ crisy and. superstition beneath his feet. " Tor truth, simple truth, shall flourish and prevail When all the arts of fraud and falsehood fail; And come it will, the day decreed by fates (How my heart triumphs while my tongue relates), Time when religious power must bend, Must see its fortunes fail, its glories end ; When prophet, priest and prince shall reign no more, Nor cross nor crescent reek with human gore ; But over all triumphant truth shall rise, And virtue be great reason's sacrifice."</page><page sequence="30">30 LAW AND GOD. Then shall be reared a new superstructure, wide enough to embrace the whole of mankind, and lofty enough to satisfy man's highest flights of emotion or of imagina¬ tion. All around us the empire of superstition is crumbling into dust. The new temple which man shall rear shall be founded upon the everlasting rock of truth, and against it the hosts of supernaturalism shall not prevail. Never was a truer sentence uttered than that of Erasmus, when he said that "man, in trying to penetrate into heaven, had lost sight of his own earth." During the centuries of religious su¬ premacy— centuries which may well be described as the days of man's deepest and darkest mental degradation—social and intellectual progress were at a complete stand-still; all departments of know¬ ledge suffered alike. The flame of science so grandly burning in the Museum of Alexandria before the Christian era, was now absolutely extinguished, and no new facts were, during the dismal period, added to the world's knowledge. It has taken centuries to overcome the evil engendered during those terrible years; even yet their influence is not altogether eradicated. The smouldering embers of knowledge - have, however, burnt into a flame, and in its vigorous light is seen the unreality of the ghostly shadows which the past had reared. We honor the truthseekers of the past in walking in their footsteps, and he who- fails to utter that which he thinks to be the highest truth is a traitor to his race. Let him not be afraid lest his. opinion should be in advance of the time. " Let him duly realise the fact that opinion is the agency through, which character adapts external arrangements to itself— that his opinion rightly forms part of this agency—is a unit of force, constituting, with other such units, the- general power which works out social changes ; and he will perceive that he may properly give full utterance- to his innermost conviction, leaving it to produce what effect it may. It is not for nothing that he has in him these sympathies with some principles and repugnance- to others. He, with all his capacities and aspirations and beliefs, is not an accident, but a product of the-</page><page sequence="31">LAW AND GOD. 31 time. He must remember that, while he is a descen¬ dant of the past, he is a parent of the future ; and his thoughts are as children born to him, which he may not carelessly let die.* * Spencer's " First Principles," p. 123.
