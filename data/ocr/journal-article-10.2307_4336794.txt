<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAN CLA USEN 636 11th In memory of Jean Millar 1. Ten years, one nest of seven rented rooms: what boast of loyalty and luck. I have been faithful to a house ("mere brick and mortar"); inconstant in love. Ten years coming and going, dusting the scarred wood with a housewifely rag. Sucking chips of intricate parquet into the vacuum hose. Days when the place is flesh of my disappointing flesh, all subtle corrosions mine. Ten years I've been faithful to the third floor, the musty, doggy reek of the hall carpet, imprecations in the night, a sulky fling of daughters down the front stoop, click-squeak of the iron gate, the hangnail of an aluminum window frame peeling off the crazed facade. The whoop of a car alarm, malicious iterations. Soap operas of tenancy. I know by heart the sound 6</page><page sequence="2">of impending interruption percussive on the stairs. The stretches of drab life that mutter behind locks and the vivacity of crisis. My foursquare, sad-ass lodging, hub and hive of unemployment, never empties like the brownstones. Alaric breaks the surface at 2 P.M. or so, nylon stocking for a hairnet. The mutt Apollo (dog named for a god!) clatters eager in the hall at any hour. At noon, rank baking flesh defiles my vegetable atmosphere, filtering up from a womanless apartment where my landlord tends a grandgirl who cuts school- Raymilla, wheezing, lumpish in St. Saviour uniform, sneaking cornchips on a Monday, Tuesday flaunting Camel Lights. I'm on top, my home a hammock, sleep suspended above the block where years fester and shout. Grubby, shabby, mine by sovereign right of two-year lease- a decade I've suffered that tawdry contact paper. Made do with an arthritic bathroom door too warped for latch or lock. Ten years trudging, mornings, to the corner, consoled somehow by the hairy-knuckled hand that thrusts my breakfast in my face. (A new-coined bagel signifies beginning.) The cronies, always several, squat on milk crates: once, they spoke Spanish. Now, Arabic. 7</page><page sequence="3">8 THE KENYON REVIEW The long unhappinesses; supple joys starched with grief. A daughter screams, terrified or laughing. (You must not listen; she is not your daughter.) The caged dog Sukey barks herself to death alone in the concrete yard. (Only the child heard.) In July's branching heat on the bed's stark single page we conjugate that irregular verb we make- adulterous, the eye's opposites, sundered in everybody's story, paired indelibly by touch. My neighbor's madness flares like phosphorus- "Mr. Smith," she cried, cunning, rearing from her appalling cave, when he went down in bathrobed righteousness to roust her from the hall, "I know how you knew I was here, I seen where you got the flash on the fuckin TV." After the sheriff came, de-homed, demeaned, I learned how a woman scorned can haunt a house. (She'd raised five kids in fewer rooms.) Her pretty daughter said, "I'm 18 years old. The family's going down. I've got to help myself." I thought she'd end like the others, on the train, stench a filthy shawl around her; or in our open air asylum fondly known as Prospect Park,</page><page sequence="4">JAN CLAUSEN 9 strutting, flapping, muttering; but she's back downstairs, praise be, tough seed in a rotten tooth - Tony, whose hallucinated prince was building a fancy house in Jersey, "Way out in the boonies, covered with trees, place you gotta take a bus to get to." Life goes on like this in layers, implicated, barely touching. Slouching, tacky, precious, never to be repeated. (A weird class sandwich, I used to think of it, welfare funding the bottom floor, then Mr. Smith with his Civil Service pension-"West Indian," sneers Tony, "you know they think they're white"- and above, the ofay lezzie lumpen intellectuals doing god knows what with language.) I patch and patch, unable to decide- is attachment virtue or folly? Inflamed, indignant over dirt and grease, running toilet's shoddy chorus, how endless inconveniences inhere in every crease and cranny of this blasted tenement, this vivid hulk that will outlive me (it's like a patient scorched by chemo, dying lively, soldiering on), I issue ultimatums. I say I will go. 2. Over cold noodles in the neighborhood, my friend relates a parable. A power- ful woman, incurably ill, supposedly wise, forsakes her lover for another. (It had been a lengthy marriage, no simpler than most.) She leaves a valley for a mountain, sheds one version of her story, choosing different words to tell it. And the deserted woman (had she thought of leaving, too?) in the gritty wounded city swears to cut her from her heart.</page><page sequence="5">IO THE KENYON REVIEW The faithless one wants "contact." Then "closure." Her medical situation in- creasingly desperate, sends wheedling or peremptory dispatches from treat- ment facilities. "I don't want to lose you," she writes. The second woman does not answer her. She is ailing, aging, supposedly wise, and stubborn as the first. Enraged at the false one's illness, her arrogance, her presumption (on her deathbed she'll persist in this imperious coquetry), the second woman marvels at her late discovery of the magnificent utility of silence. (I never think if I were dying. I only think if she-) I dare you. Double dare you. (Romaine and Natalie, two terrible old women, bags of dimly gendered bones, playing chicken with death.) (Delight they had known together.) 3. a split a cleft life 4. From the first, we were three. The girl grew tall somehow beneath the stunting shade of our bookish preoccupations. Two unmotherly women, we'd brew a pot of something and eat it for a week. We'd flop on the double bed preparing copy for the printer. Bawl Darling Clementine all the way to Baltimore in that lemon of a lemon-yellow car to divert a cranky daughter. Ours was a house of cats, uncontrollable presences, her narrow bedroom swamped with toxic reading matter. (Unhealthy, I'd joke, to dwell</page><page sequence="6">JAN CLAUSEN II on top of words like "irredentist.") The Two State Solution, insomniac arrangements, the talk that went on, went on through everything and will never be repeated. (Not in this life.) Closed, she was closed as a natural fisted thing, as nut or seed or shell. But when she opened, oh my darling, so open- to snap shut again. I scarcely wrote about that long time we had (you are lost and gone forever). The closeness, drudgery, how we made each other up. Then one day (dreadful sorry, Clementine) I woke unforgivably wanting my own life. 5. 06/30 A. graduated. E. moved out. I hauled everything over from Park Place on Tuesday night. Got rid of the hulking tattered aqua couch the following morn- ing-triumph! Slipped $20 to the sanitation guys, though W. claims bribery unnecessary. Carmen's sister Esther died in the Bronx-hit by a truck in the middle of the night in the middle of Hunt's Pt. Avenue. Everybody knew she wasn't going to make it (she partied, she got high, C. explains, and talks about that last time she showed up at the apartment, saying she wanted to get clean-split after three days) but it's awful for Carmen. Her mother sick (ARC), no money, so C. may have to assume the funeral expenses.</page><page sequence="7">I2 THE KENYON REVIEW Odd how the couch became symbolic of everything I couldn't get rid of all these years. The "squalor." There was faintly sadistic pleasure in watching (always, I have this anthropomorphic feeling about domestic objects) from my bedroom window as the guy pulled the lever and the whole thing went crunch-splintered like kindling. It left all sorts of dust and stuffing on the stairs - and one dried dead mouse, flat as a glove, which I didn't discover until the following day. On the ledge behind where the bookcase had stood I found two brown philodendron leaves shaped like withered hands. This seems a luxurious life: nothing to do but maintain myself. Underneath, though, I can't bear the sadness in the simplest of plots: We were together, and now we're not together. 6. the walls still standing and the books on the shelves in Brooklyn light after all these years rooms a bed evanescence 7. You appear to me when trivial things happen. A mosquito infiltrates through the torn window screen (nothing functional in this hovel) and I'm homesick for our genial midnight bickering: you'd opt to mount a tricky anti-aircraft operation, I to tough it out and get some itchy sleep. All persistent misery recalls your grumpy look clouding a room, a week, seasons.</page><page sequence="8">JAN CLAUSEN 13 When first persimmons stun the marketplace with their hot outlandish flush, bright pointy eggs or flaming breasts in careful cups of tissue paper, to me they only signify December, your birthday come again. No one else must eat that fruit; I know you'll hover, plan, and then on darkest solstice nights dive mouth first into glory. When I dump the gay newspapers, unbagged per regulation, into the green MIXED PAPER ONLY bin, I think you'd think a fem who left you for a man can afford my carelessness. We used to hide them from the neighborhood. You expected persecutions, were not always disappointed. (But the Slope's advanced, we've got Intensive Recycling and trash police to monitor our waste and graffiti in the Seventh Avenue station: WE'RE EVERYWHERE, GAYS BASH BACK.) More than anyone who listens to my life you'd appreciate the story of the sophomore baby dyke disdaining Jo Sinclair: "Why couldn't we read queer-positive novels like The Well of Loneliness?" Some days I feel embedded, on the verge of geologic- old barnacle, clamped to my rock. You turned against this city of your birth. The Bronx, the Automat, the absconded parakeet. A mother's scars sequestered under clothing. Implacable, you hauled your anger north.</page><page sequence="9">14 THE KENYON REVIEW In three years I've seen the nape of your neck twice across an auditorium, haughty, hurt, stubborn, capable of damage- whatever I imagine, your own and none other. Gone, you don't go. Distinct, intentional, a frigate standing off just over the horizon. Even in imponderable Boston, rumored to exist within secure boundaries. 8. Imperfection is the sign governing this house, the discipline and wisdom of renters like us in an age of real estate. Past the fault, I sit whole amid the shabby patient things that follow us when we change our minds and go into the exile of an unfamiliar happiness. I'm so glad I left. I write what I like. For long I thought I'd left my real life- but it's all my real life heaped in the cupboard of dreams, stirred in the cauldron of morning: the bottle pickers, metal salvagers, their furtive scrape and clink floating up to my cheap perch. That guy on the park bench,</page><page sequence="10">JAN CLAUSEN I5 deranged, quotidian, sucking air through a paper bag as though his soul depended on it. A book tumbles down, the flyleaf inscribed for Elly and Jan with respect and caring in the famed poet's hand. Old shopping lists drift out of rusty paperbacks, ingredients for stuffed cabbage on a torn envelope in her scrawl bereft and inhospitable as the scowl she wore at parties. If I tolerate reminders, maybe it's because I secretly believe in a parallel universe where our longtime conversation carries on, Barbara dropping by for pie or proofreading. Where Dorothy and Cherrie never moved to California. What would I slough away if I split for sounder quarters, shrugged off the dust of dour remembrance? The wasteful brook that haunts my toilet tank. A landlord's honest fecklessness. Certain bloodshot salutations, signifying on the stoop. Filthy, panoramic windows pouring light and freezing air (I only need to hang a line to reel the stories in, lean over to applaud the early genuflections of dog walkers in smart coats, co-op owners bowing low to simple shit).</page><page sequence="11">THE KENYON REVIEW Spring's crabbed burgeoning athwart the brown park: soon, the green conflagration, and that pathetic trailing branch, storm-ripped from ancient trunk, cut off in palest half-leaf. Tony's plaintive-angry honk, Raquel, Raquel, scouting through the urban thicket. And the residue of that bad, bad January we spent without heat. The old, boring pain. The other things that happened. I think that imperfection is what holds and humbles us, what teaches us to love beyond reckoning or blame this life we didn't make and could never have made up - motes of understanding in a hurricane of fact, some unfixable shape at the bottom of revision. So shiftlessly we dwell in polygamous memory, no wiser than our stories, what we want. Lovers, who can apprehend it all, bud and winking branch and building, acid sweet grooved engorgement between women's legs, thrilling salt blurt of semen in the mouth's estuary? (And I know the notes of dank mortality, cracked music of the house, familiar, bitter, blessed, like the scent of a lover's skin, like the breath of a lover's sleep.) Through you, I'm talking to my loneliness. You know where to find me.</page></plain_text>
