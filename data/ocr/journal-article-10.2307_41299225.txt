Born in Madrid in 1478, Oviedo became something of a soldier of fortune who arrived in the New World as Overseer of the Gold Foundries (1514). After visiting the Indies many times, he returned to Castile in 1530 as "Procurador," or agent, of the municipalities of Panama and Santo Domingo to the Spanish court. In May 1532 Oviedo was sent to the Indies as part of the imperial bureaucracy and appointed royal chronicler at a crucial moment in the debate about the legitimacy of holding dominion over the Indies.4 This essay will attempt to explore critically the grounds upon which Oviedo employed knowledge as a form of colonial domination. By placing his narrative in the context of the Antilles, which at the time were undergoing rapid change, I will bring to the foreground Oviedo's binary oppositions in describing the New World and do so with the intention of showing the representational contours in which Spanish actions took place. My reading of Oviedo's representational practices contrasts with recent assessments of the Spanish chronicler; these have overlooked the binarian characteristic of his colonial narratives which pose the beauty of nature against putatively idolatrous and savage native peoples.5 For instance, Alvaro Felix Bolanos characterizes Oviedo's ambitious and monumental project, Historia General y Natural de las Indias, Islas y Tierra Firme del Mar Oceano (1 535, 1 547, 1 557), as guided by a Spanish didactic (Madrid, 1981); Stephanie Merrim, "Un Mare Magno e Oculto : Anatomy of Fernandez de Oviedo's Historia General y Natural de las Indias ," Revista de Estudios Hispdnicos , no vol. number (1984): 101-1 1 1; Merrim, "The Apprehension of the New in Nature and Culture" in 1492-1992: Re/Discovering Colonial Writing , ed.

John Liddiard Nicholas, author of the Narrative of a Voyage to New Zealand (London, [18 1 7 ] 1 97 1 ), pointed out that "there is no part of New Zealand where the works of nature are not always powerful enough to arrest the attention of the contemplative mind" (p. 1 67). While regretting not being able to provide his readers with "any thing like an accurate idea of the countless beautiful views that are to be met in this island (Cowa-Cowa)," Nicholas described the New Zealanders as "primitive" and "inferior," and "barbarians of the most ferocious and implacable dispositions" (pp. 225-26, 29).</page><page sequence="3">Representing the New World's Nature 75 tradition dealing with ideals about behavior, whereas Angel Luis Mendez treats it as a literaiy exercise based upon an historiographic and naturalistic pattern.6 These approaches fail to investigate correlations among the political, naturalistic and artistic discourses of Oviedo's work. The Historic! 's detailed descriptions of nature are examined in isolation, as though they were of purely objective value and lacking ideological content. My intent is to investigate the ideological role that "the sheen of the exotic" played in Oviedo's vast chronicle.7 This is not to argue that metropolitan modes of representation are necessarily and inherently unidirectional, but rather that they must be understood as part of a constitutive process of the European Atlantic empires and the colonial languages that ensued.8 I Unlike other accounts, no waterlogged marshes, deserts, plains or threatening jungles mark Oviedo's Historia.9 By describing nature in positive and glowing terms to his royal patrons, Oviedo employed a literary strategy expressive of cultural assumptions that indicate how an asymmetrical relationship between Western and native societies was mentally conceptualized and historically implemented.10 6.

Regarding Hernctn Cortes's fifth letter to Charles V (1525), Beatriz Pastor has perceptively analyzed a tendentious narrative of the conquest whereby the enemy was no longer the native but the environment.

This aimed</page><page sequence="4">76 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques Following Isidorus's Etymologies, Claudio Ptolemy's Geography, and especially Pliny's Natural History as models to imitate, Oviedo undertook the first serious attempt to both classify and subordinate the new lands as a natural entity." Despite the fact that ancient philosophers had been ignorant of the basic principles of cartography and the new cosmography, much of their understanding still formed a corpus of knowledge difficult to debunk. The intellectual and political milieu at that time did not easily allow historians to move away from the accumulated wisdom of the Ancients. They provided certain cognitive structures - postulates, axioms - with which to interpret the New World according to a particular sense of "recognition." Although embedded in such epistemological soil, Oviedo's use of Pliny revealed a tension between empiricism and authoritative texts that challenged imitation as a valuable strategy for rendering a truthful, descriptive natural history.12 Unlike Pliny's Natural History, no sirens, dragons or anthropomorphic monsters played a fundamental part in Oviedo's work. Instead of plunging into the abyss of the bestiary, his narrative offered an overarching catalog of climate, flora, fauna, mountains and other features that Oviedo found in the Indies.13 primarily at deconstructing the binary oppositions - civilization versus savagery - upon which much of colonialist historiography was based. 1 1 .

See also Merrim's discussion of Oviedo's use of Pliny, "The Apprehension of the New," pp. 174-175. With the emergence of printing, the classics became more accessible, even in vernacular languages. This allowed Oviedo to gather more than one-hundred-nineteen books in Santo Domingo: Daymond Turner, "Los libros del Alcaide: la biblioteca de Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Vald£s." Reuista de Indias 125-126(1971): 143. 12. The need to respond to empirical facts expressed a semantic challenge that weakened scholastic authority. For a detailed discussion of Oviedo's dual approach to sixteenth-century theories of imitation - namely, nature and the prevailing canon - see Kathleen A. Myers, "Imitation, Authority, and Revision in Fernandez de Oviedo's Historia General y Natural de las Indias , " Romance Languages Annual 3 (1 991 ): 523. 13. As for the importance of Oviedo's work on botanical classification, see especially Alvarez L6pez, "La Historia natural en Fernandez de Oviedo," Reuista de Indias 70 (1958): 582-601 . In a similar vein, M£ndez has nuanced some of Alvarez L6pez's assertions, pointing out that "(. . .) Oviedo's post is not precisely that of a botanist, zoologist or medical botanist, but an overseer of mines. With this observation we want to make clear how clumsy his data were in relation to the disciplines of botany and zoology," (my translation) (p. 189). Notwithstanding this, according to Mendez, Oviedo became the first modem naturalist (p. 190).</page><page sequence="5">Representing the New World's Nature 77 The overall effect of Oviedo's approach was increasingly valued during the Catholic neo-Thomist revival of the sixteenth century.14 Only then did nature cease to be a danger zone of the first order, a source of anxiety and fear: it became a vehicle to God. In this context Oviedo's interest in framing historical facts within the natural environment that surrounded him favored an expositive order characterized by a heterogeneous chain of events and descriptions. Yet, on close examination, the joyful sentiment that marked Oviedo's Historia only acquired full meaning under the production of rhetorical structures, which were not only determined by aesthetic, but also specific legal, political and religious constraints.15 As a result, Oviedo provided a didactic Erasmian concept of history - the magistra vitae - that portrayed Spain as divinely chosen to carry out a hallowed mission overseas. Oviedo's strategy, which was quite calculated, did not consolidate the colonial forms of subjectivity and power by comparing Amerindian vice and intellectual feebleness with Spanish intelligence and virtue, but rather by scrutinizing in detail various aspects of natural life. The following pages will shed some light on the creative dimension of Oviedo's narrative, showing how the cult of the marvelous instituted a distant paradise to be consecrated through the inexorable spread of God's word. II Spread before Oviedo's eyes, the endless spectacle of the New World's marvels not only overwhelmed understanding, but also defied his powers of selective perception. The section in the Historia dedicated to pineapples is well known. A sort of aesthetic eroticism seizes Oviedo when describing 1 4. The cohesion of the world began to turn on a pantheist conceptualization of nature as expressed in Nova de UniversisPhilosophia, by the Neo-Platonist Francesco Patrizzi (1 529- 97). A divine spirit was held responsible for every sort of life, and hence, there were not several universes for different species but just one. Some authors, like the Stoic animist Bernardino Telesio (1508-88), followed a path far more pagan than Oviedo's. This Italian humanist, whom Francis Bacon would describe as the first of modem philosophers - novorum , hominum , primum - began to focus on a harmonic depiction of an astonishing variety of plants and animals. Starting from a Platonist principle consisting of a living universe, Telesio argued that sense experience must always lead our perception of things - De rerum natura iuxta propria principia (1586): see Maurice Bloch, La filosofia del Renaixement (Barcelona, [1977] 1982), pp. 50-51. 15.

Oviedo's pivotal respect for European Judeo-Christian and Greek-Latin parameters led him to establish a sort of botanical survey that, unlike those of other travelers, enabled him to communicate an arresting sense of uniqueness. But sometimes words were not enough to convey meaning. Thus, by roughly painting what the inadequacies of language prevented from being expressed, Oviedo managed to present a different reality to his readers in the absence of a shared point of reference.17 Invested with the authority of the traveling administrator, the author- compiler called for a "true" perspective on reality in response to, or in dialogue with, other colonial representations devoid of accuracy and depth.18 Oviedo's skepticism about secondhand sources led him to cast considerable doubt on the accuracy of the Decadi di I'orbe nuovo (Alcala, 1518; Basilea, 1 521 ; London, 1 555), by Peter Martyr. 19 Thus, by "killing" that past, as Michel de Certeau perceptively put it, Oviedo framed historical events within his own corpus of knowledge, reshaping the scriptural task according to the author's personal aspirations.20 Even though a good number of Spanish eyewitnesses had lived some time in the Indies and could faithfully authenticate his Historia as a 16.

Starting from the urgencies of the present, he attempted to approach history not only as a way of instrumentally reordering knowledge, but also as a means for establishing a new semantic field capable of producing coherence beyond any "contradiction." Oviedo expressed this as follows: I want to certify to Your Majesty that my lines will be unadorned with the abundance of artificial words, used to invite readers; but will be full of truth, and in accordance, I say that it will have no contradiction, so that your Sovereign Clemency may order for it to be shaped and polished. 21 As some scholars and critics have correctly pointed out, Oviedo never viewed history as a completed process. On the contrary, he undertook a never-ending task of correcting, expanding and revising what he had previously written. These textual revisions involved the inclusion of new sources and textual authorities, on the one side, and the addition of new information on the New World's phenomena and events, on the other. The flexible number of chapters within each book made it possible to store new information according to the genre at issue. As a result, while each book of Oviedo's Historia could to a certain degree stand as an independent unit, a sense of repetitiveness and incompleteness was always present: "the secrets are never definitely revealed."22 It operated like an encyclopedia, which acts not as a global system of universal scope, but rather, quoting Umberto Eco, as a system of "local" and transitory knowledge endlessly revised.23 Located and constructed at the chronological and geographical center of events, Oviedo's monumental work was always reluctant to borrow secondhand accounts or anecdotes from others.24 To register the reality 21.

As an illustration of this, Isaac Lemer noted an intellectual connection between Oviedo's Historia and Pero Mexias's Silva de varia lecion (Seville, 1 540). According to Lemer, both humanists shared a mutual admiration, and consequently influenced one</page><page sequence="8">80 Historical Reflections/ Reflexions Historiques perceived by the senses, an empirical routine of data collecting as a uniquely privileged method was necessary to re-present the most truthful narrative possible.25 In Oviedo's own words, "I do not write with the authority of an historian or poet, but as an eyewitness, on most of what I will treat here."26 In this manner, guided only by his own experience and learning, he resolved that cougars were lions; jaguars and ocelots, tigers; reptiles, green lizards; hippopotamuses, aquatic hogs; and finally, llamas, alpacas and vicunas, simple sheep.27 Oviedo's universe can be considered as a select repertory establishing a sort of lineal continuity between the Old and New Worlds.28 From antiquity, in contrast, the richness and marvels of the West were regarded as one of the referential signs of otherness and, as Greenblat has pointed out, it functioned not only as source of fascination but especially authentication.29 Most of Oviedo's oral and written sources were personally collected, revised and then transposed into summarizing narration that established his authority as author.30 Despite his ongoing interplay with a nature so astonishingly fulsome, no serious communication with native oral tradition determined the selection of the events or the descriptive elements for making a readable text.31 Indeed, for Oviedo native language was simply a tool, a means to extract information and render his texts more another: "La visi6n humanistica de America: Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo" in Las Indias (America) en la literatura del Siglo de Oro, ed.

Yet, Oviedo was sometimes unable to verify data.

Writing history did not consist merely of producing printed knowledge to convey the effect of the "real"; it also included validating the privileged status of Roman alphabetic writing.32 In this respect, by violently implanting the biblical notion that the written word represented reality and, therefore, truth, native versions of reality were textually appropriated.33 As a result of emphasizing the power of ocular evidence, the language itself overflowed, giving rise to a dense set of European forms and images that created a sense of duplicity.34 Indigenous words were still needed to shape new Spanish terms, which would accurately make sense of the "Indians'" cultural phenomena for the European observer.35 Besides that linguistic quirk, the work plays upon another duplicity. Enticed by the power of the senses, Oviedo's gaze turned unavoidably into the readers' eyes, so that he decided what was to be described according to culturally and historically determined criteria. In the process, he ceaselessly turned to the reader in order to justify his stylistic methods and to affirm the veracity and authenticity of his accounts ("como lo he yo escripto" ; "es verdad" ; "sin dubda"). This approach led to a literary strategy in the manipulation of language; it allowed Oviedo to fix the reality in words, to include and exclude information, to subordinate one variety of the rare, the bizarre and the exceptional to another. But that "reality" was in fact a clear induction to "see," selecting and suppressing that which was 32. Within this context of literacy and colonization, Walter Mignolo portrayed Diego de Landa's and Diego de Valades's attempts to translate picto-ideographic writing systems as illustrations of the "tyranny of the alphabet": "Literacy and Colonization: The New World Experience" in Rene Jara and Nicholas Spadaccini, eds., 1492-1992: Re /Discovering Colonial Writing (Minneapolis, 1989), pp. 51-96. 33.

Similar to Oviedo's chronicle, Columbus's texts also subordinated context-bound speech of native populations to Western literary models in order to make it visible: Beatriz Pastor, "Silence and Writing: The History of the Conquest" in Rene Jara and Nicholas Spadaccini, eds, 1492-1992: Re /Discovering Colonial Writing , p. 129. 34. As for the power of objectification of Oviedo's taxonomy, see Jose Rabasa's comments about Oviedo's entry on pineapples, pp. 141-144; see also Mendez, p. 170. 35. According to Rabasa, "the tasks of naming and describing flora, fauna, cultures, and landscapes are, however, haunted by the disfiguration of previous metaphors, which Oviedo's history attempts to rectify in order to promote marvel and a 'fresh' representation of the new phenomena" (p. 140). All the same, it is rather surprising, besides ironic, that whereas Oviedo thought of "Indians" as mere informers who ultimately disappeared as a consequence of the inexorable advance of Christendom, he, at least, pretended to preserve such a "barbarous" nomenclature for the sake of "Western" knowledge.</page><page sequence="10">82 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques necessary to make the chronicle more comprehensible or appealing to the readers.36 Ill Representation always entails a form of misinterpretation. As Paul Veyne clearly illustrated in his Writing History, historiography, like grammar, involves a degree of interpretation relative to a context of description. According to this view, more Nietzschean than hermeneutic, historical narratives always depend on their authors' subjective premises.37 For Jose Amador de los Rfos, the first editor to publish a complete edition of the Historia ( 1 85 1 -55) , some of Oviedo's stories were necessarily exaggerated since they prioritized the historical over the natural. Given that Oviedo's Historia was meant to establish a cultural hegemony over new territories, how could the events described be directly and fully grasped? Elisions, omissions and distortions inevitably contradicted Oviedo's pretension to write a complete history. Conscious mutilation of knowledge, to borrow Veyne's expression, while present, is not the most interesting issue here, but rather Oviedo's resolution to confer on himself an undisputed authority to produce his text. That is how the social nature of writing comes into play, inasmuch as both the seemingly individual act of experiencing and the more evidently social act of producing meanings takes place within historically specific discursive relations. In Oviedo's case, he relentlessly grappled with finding similarities in a context of knowledge still grounded in the language and symbols of a European mentality. As Ana Pizarro has noted, the rivers of enormous breadth that he gazed upon could not be represented without the image of the river he bore in mind. Neither could the impenetrable and tropical forests, the lush vegetation, nor the richness of foliage correspond to anything other than Oviedo's mental categories.38 36. The gaze of the observer is the front line of an encyclopedic curiosity that always returns to the required image.

His view was less concerned with unveiling a New World than with inscribing the idea of continuity with the Old.39 The principle of unity was commonplace in Renaissance geographical circles.40 For instance, in 1540 the Venetian geographer Giovanni Battista Ramusio ( 1 485- 1 55 7),secretario de la Illustrisima Senorla de Venecia, sent to Oviedo the Tabula belonging to another geographer, the Swedish Olaus Gotho, which was published in Venice in 1 539, and wherein it was proclaimed that "todo el mundo . . . es una mesma tierra e costa, sin la dividir la mar."41 Anchored in this ideal unity of all lands, the Florentine navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano strove to grasp the New World by reducing it to familiar schemas, and thus, translate it into the conceptual images of the Old.42 In essence, Oviedo's consciousness of global unity, apart from challenging medieval categories, established no cosmographic ruptures with respect to the Western World. He employed his great gifts of observation as well as outstanding descriptive techniques to shrink the distance between Europe and America. This intention also appears in the work of other Spanish chroniclers, like Francisco Lopez de Gomara, who in his Historia General de las Indias y Conquista de Mexico (Zaragoza, 1 552) pointed out that "The world is unique, and not multiple, like some [ancient gentiles] thought (. . .), and the earth, that is the center of the world, according to how equinoxes show it to be, is fixed, strong, and so vigorous and well grounded in itself that it will never weaken nor be in any way lacking. "43 While reconfirming a recurrent notion of uniformity, Oviedo nonetheless perfected a colonial discourse whereby a fragmented reality 39. Oviedo, Historia , vol. 118 (Prologue to the bk. XVII), 1959, p. 86. 40. Oviedo's intellectual curiosity appears to be rooted in the interface between the Medieval and Renaissance world views characteristic of that time - not the ambiguous Spanish Renaissance, but the Italian one. In contrast, Perez de Tudela Bueso argued that Oviedo could not escape from a closed, self-contained code of representation: "he was still a medieval man" (p. 393). According to Alvarez Lopez (1957, pp. 542-543) and Giuliano Soria (pp. 43, 141), the way in which Oviedo subordinated individual originality to experiential "objectivity" clearly justifies his Renaissance character. If the phenomenal world was thus a manifestation or reflection of objective reality, the existence of an audience to which that "reality" was addressed ultimately demonstrates a process of diffusion by no means medieval, but Renaissance in origin. 41.

Humanists frequently inferred from this that perhaps the most inexorable law in the universe was the passage of time. The succession of seasons, the fall of deciduous leaves in autumn, and the majesty of multiple forms of birds, revealed the metamorphosis of God's world as well as the order of its endless movement. Such perceptions in Oviedo's case stemmed from looking at nature as a vast, latent force. That is, as a living organism in constant regeneration, able to revive itself, wherein everything necessarily comes to an end in order to allow other new lives to burgeon, slowly, almost silently. Once again the New World was perceived in terms of forces and processes formulated in the Old. The picturesque scenery of the Indies was a constant source of surprise and a challenge to the observer's contemplative mind. To this extent, the way in which Oviedo envisaged nature corresponded to an accurate reproduction of the Garden of Eden. As a sort of new Adam and nature's prisoner, Oviedo aspired to record God's handiwork in detail and with precision, echoing a polyphonic perception of over-abundance for the benefit of his potential readers: "The works of God are marvelous, and the animated things in diverse provinces and places of the world are of very different kinds, as much in their species and forms as in their size and proportion, and their effects and particularities: and it is in this way to such an extent, that it is not possible to finish writing about the animals of the earth, nor the fish and the animals of the sea, by human diligence, nor to say everything, nor will those who are alive or even yet to come be lacking in things to note. 45 The New World was the book upon which God wrote the prodigality of nature, and to contemplate nature was the best vehicle to contemplate Him: God is the Maker, the Lord of all creation, whose imprint could be found everywhere. At first glance, this epigraph presents a contradictory 44. Vazquez Zoraida, p. 40; Soria, p. 44. 45. Oviedo, Historia, vol. 1 1 8, (Prologue to the bk. X or XIII), 1 959, p. 56.

Namely, a playful nature can no longer be detached from God's presence according to the formal canon prevailing during the sixteenth century.46 Yet, on closer inspection, Oviedo's devotional portrait introduced a secular understanding of marvel by means of philosophical speculation. With no impediment for sensitive eyes to unveil a reality so spiritual, describing geography would be, as Ptolemy put it, a mode of painting the world with words.47 (See figure 1) But Oviedo's experience was not that of an individual communion with nature. Rather, he viewed it from outside as a potent, if disturbing, symbol of innocence and power with surprisingly little concern for the economic potential offered by its prodigality.48 Instead, the undeniable beauty of nature appears analogically mapped out through exotic landscapes, an enormous variety of tangled jungles, scorching climates, tornadoes, lakes of uncertain origin, stunning mountains and an endless list of large forests. A sacral aura arose from Oviedo's observant and scrutinizing look. Antonello Gerbi properly notes how the Spanish chronicler was often shaken while staring at such splendor: "What mortal mind can comprehend . . . such variety of animals . . . such an untellable multitude of trees ... so many plants and herbs useful and beneficial to men (and) other uncountable ones unknown to them, and with such a variety of roses and flowers and sweet-smelling fragrances ... So much variety of birds of prey and of other kinds ... so many great, high and fertile mountains, and other so different and untamed ... so many plains and fields suitable for agriculture ... so many mountains more tempestuous and admirable than the Etna or the Mongibel, and the Vulcano, and the Estrongol; and all of them under your Monarchy?"49 46.

As Merrim pointed out, any allusion to gold or economic benefits, so present in Columbus's narrative, is surprisingly absent from Oviedo's Sumario (Merrim, p. 1 90). Oviedo was, in fact, in the pearl and slave trade of Panama.

The reader cannot be but overcome and enthralled by the bold scenes rich in an abundance and plenitude suggestive of the dream of the Garden of Eden. Fascination before the majesty and harmony of God's accomplishment parallels the insufficiency of language for an adequate expression of all that exists. Superlatives prove only partially useful to describe so much sensuality and visual pleasure. Oviedo's sensitivity notwithstanding, the variety of habits, animals and types of vegetation stretch beyond the possibilities of textual representation. The European reader, apart from being amused at the images of the new T errestrial Paradise, could only wonder about the origins of those new forms of animal and vegetal life. As already noted, the term Indies - from Oregon to Patagonia - implied a certain unity that reflected the admiration of all those who hitherto knew nothing about its existence. Even more important for the ideologues of the Spanish empire was the possibility that all these wonders, after being properly redefined and renamed, were under the rule of a single and universal sovereign.50 IV Unlike traditional societies from Iberia, the virgin, flawless nature of the New World turned out to be a physical space with no morality. Nature was amoral because no rules, customs or "civilized" behavior existed in that place. While Western societies were human artifacts created by imperfect beings, nature itself manifested - and this is an important element of contrast - a stainless purity as though it had been neither manipulated nor degraded by an evil agent. At this juncture, Oviedo's imagination easily recognized that God's goodness was reflected in every element of a flourishing primal nature. However, he did not "confirm" and "identify," as Columbus did, but rather "dispossessed" and "appropriated" the natural exteriority of the Indies.51 In compliance with a "logic or theology of colonization" prevalent in his mind, Oviedo judged nature in a certain manner as a tabula rasa. His version of the Indies as a vacant space was actually a metaphor that 50. Oviedo, Sumario de la Natural Historic de las Indias, (Madrid, [15261 1986), p. 82. Led by a passionate and sincere Spanish nationalism, Oviedo remarks again in his Historia that, "this will be a glorious culmination of the immortality of your perpetual and unique form."

Pastor, 1992, p. 10.</page><page sequence="16">88 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques fostered the production of ideological images from outside.52 For unlike Columbus, who did not expect to find any inferior humanity beyond the outlying limits of the Ocean Sea, Oviedo knew of the existence of "barbarian" or "savage" peoples whom he purposely set aside. The reason is quite clear. In the process of writing his chronicle, Oviedo produced a sense of distance and estrangement given the impossibility of thinking of the New World's inhabitants as historical subjects. Ultimately, however, dehumanizing others not only entailed a violent act of detachment, but also the refilling of the Indies with moral values and beliefs, such as an intelligible language and the Christian faith. Or, what amounts to the same thing, the Amerindians, were reduced to the status of sheer objects; this wiped the slate clean and thereby produced a new sense of positive history.53 From the beginning of their Atlantic expansionism, the Portuguese and Spaniards had taken formal possession of foreign soil in the name of their respective monarchs. By symbolically planting crosses, royal standards or banners, together with the reading of solemn declarations, the Indies were consecrated as part of the Old by a legal system which claimed moral superiority over non-European peoples. In this way, the sophistication of rhetorical formalism made the new lands uninhabited to better appropriate them through a series of ritualistic proceedings and dispositions that the natives had no hope of understanding.54 According to ancient Roman law and a still vibrant medieval spirit, possessio was largely based on the principle of bodily occupation whether by right of conquest or by virtue of placing one's body upon a fixed and 52 .

This strategy to displace certain aspects of reality in favor of others constituted part of an ensuing ideological dimension of English expansionism. To a great extent, this rhetorical device was by no means accidental. Nor was it new. In 1 185 Gerald of Wales ( Giraldus Cambrensis ), a loquacious Norman clerk in the service of Henry II (1 1 33-89), had already written a laborious description of Ireland in tune with the monarch's interest to colonize the island. His Topographia Hibernia [The History and Topography of Ireland] expressed a certain admiration for the secret wonders of nature joined to a profound disdain towards the "barbarous," filthy, and inhospitable Celtic-Irish peoples, who were unabashedly "wallowing in vice." Gerald Wales, The History and Topography of Ireland (London, 1982), p. 106. Justification for settlement in areas previously unconquered was found in the argument of land utility, inasmuch as it was unacceptable that Irish soil should go uncultivated. As Gerard of Wales contended (p. 102), "the wealth of the soil is lost, not through the fault of the soil, but because there are no farmers to cultivate even the best land: 'the fields demand, but there are no hands.'" 54.

Further, by the late 1 530s the indigenous population from Cuba was so drastically reduced as a consequence of epidemic disease and relentless labor demands that the system of encomienda did not guarantee any notable source of wealth.58 (See figure 2) From the beginning of the colonial period, the pursuit of easy riches and the control of labor were more important to the newcomers than ownership of land. The Dominicans and other members of the regular clergy vigorously protested the resulting inhumane treatment accorded the Indians and attempted to arouse the conscience of Spanish imperial authorities.59 For the Crown's purposes, however, the moral and economic significance of so spectacular a decline had to be properly balanced. Here power and knowledge met, thereby producing the effects of truth within colonial discourses.60 Consequently, a displacement of aggression moved 55.

Regardless of the existence of hostile natives who seemed not to appreciate material riches,61 a vision of beauty and splendor was formed by joining it with so-called peaceful activities, such as the development of sugar plantations, trade and transport.62 Now, to pacific settlers, a correspondingly plentiful nature became visible.63 V Located within a polarized narrative that entwined fear with hope, Oviedo's premises offered a potential key to explain existing conditions. A centripetal impulse to keep the beauty of nature coherent dramatically opposed a centrifugal force that sought to push the idolatrous and lascivious Amerindians aside. In showing this mode of representing the New World's nature, I have therefore attempted to dismantle Oviedo's reputation as a naturalist and the belief that his observations formed part of a seemingly neutral science. In line with Foucault's ideas which see all knowledge - and hence natural science - as a form of power, I have argued that the marvels of nature were set against their negated alterity as a way of fostering a symbolic distance between the "Indians" and Oviedo's readers. The fetishization of nature in positive terms was of prime importance in cloaking the ideological projection of Oviedo's discourse, smoothing the way for the consolidation of a hierarchical colonial society 61. Historia , vol. 117, bk. Ill, 1959, p. 67. 62 . The business of sugar was one of the most profitable granjerias for the first Spaniards who arrived to the Antilles. As Oviedo pointed out, "... this sugar affair is one of the richest forms of farming that could be possible in any province or kingdom of the world. And in this island there is a disposition to build many other inventions, and no one knows of other isles or kingdoms of this size nor of this sugar farming, amongst Christians or Infidels. And continuously vessels that have come from Spain set sail and return to it full of a very good sugar; and the honey and other things made from it, which in this island are countless and innumerable, could enrich another large province." Historia , vol. 1 1 7, bk. IV, chap. VIII, 1 959, p. 110. (my translation) 63. The reason why Spaniards did not share the English conception of American nature as a 'wilderness' waiting to be developed might lie not only in their different attitudes to wealth, as John H. Elliot seems to suggest in his "The Seizure of Overseas Territories by the European Powers" in The European Discovery of the World and its Economic Effects on Pre- Industrial Society, 1500-1800, ed. Hans Pohl (Stuttgart, 1990), p. 53, but in a distinct cosmological notion of the universe. While the English regarded God's handiwork to be instrumentally used, nature was already endowed with perfection in Spanish eyes, a perfection not needing any further modification to be completed, as the English thought, but simply glorification as God's work.</page><page sequence="20">92 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques where the native population was dying out.64 In my view, wonder over nature's fulsomeness did not stand for all that could not be fully understood, as Greenblat suggests,65 but for all that had to be concealed, or to a great extent, minimized. To represent any landscape is to employ rhetorical devices and metaphors. However, in noting the descriptions of the New World's marvels, we must pay attention to discursive formations and the 'truths' that they produce. In the mid-sixteenth century the inhabitants of remote parts of the world were not monsters, as portrayed in Pliny's Natural History. They became the bone and blood of the colonial system. In terms of political necessity, Ferdinand, and his chief counselor, bishop Juan de Fonseca, were not inclined to stop the exploitation of natives or to alienate Spanish settlers. In a parallel fashion, a new history now assumed its universality over the pagan peoples of the New World as a consequence of God's providential mandate.66 America thereby became the place to expand the gospel of the Old World. In the final balance Oviedo guaranteed not only the moral and civil justification of Spanish actions in the New World, but also that those actions would restore the covenant between the Great Redeemer and humankind at large. 64. Astonished by the effects of epidemics over the native population, Oviedo also endorsed the idea that God was protecting the Spaniards by killing off untrustworthy "Indians" who obstructed the goals of the Christians: Alberto Salas, "Fernandez de Oviedo, critico de la conquista y de los conquistadores," Cuadernos Americanos 74 (1954): 168. In contrast, Bartolome de Las Casas refused to search for any providentialist language of imperialism. For him, no historical justification legitimized the atrocities committed against the Amerindians: A Very Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies , p. 22. 65. Greenblat, 1992, pp. 21-22. 66. Apologetically speaking, Oviedo stated that "... not being satisfied, those holy sovereigns (the Catholic Kings) with their enterprise and the holy conquest . . . with which they ended the occupation of Spain by the moors, . . . proposed to look for that New World, to plant it, not to waste a minute in the service of God . . ."
