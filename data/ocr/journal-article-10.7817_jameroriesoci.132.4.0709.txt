Jo Ann Scurlock Elmhurst College A History of Ancient Egypt. By Marc Van De Mieroop. Malden, Mass.: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011.  Pp. xxiii + 400, illus. $44.95 (paper). Explaining Egypt’s long and complicated history, especially to students, requires clarity and a good  sense of what to include and what to leave out. Marc Van De Mieroop’s A History of Ancient Egypt  achieves this objective and in so doing provides a volume that will be very appealing to a wide audi- ence. Writing in an engaging style, the author makes it clear from the outset that the book reflects his  “personal selection” of the vast number of topics for which secure historical data exist. His chosen  focus is Egypt’s complex political history, as revealed by its written sources. Unlike many other vol- umes of its kind, however, Van De Mieroop’s avoids a strictly sequential approach and the simplistic  divisions of the ancient king lists in order to emphasize the often untidy nature of Egypt’s political  development. Nevertheless, each chapter opens with a Summary of Dynastic History, outlining in  chronological order the particular people and events that the author has decided to examine within each  time period; a full king list by dynasty is also provided at the end of the volume. The book is sprinkled liberally with Sources in Translation: excerpts from different types of docu- ments (royal, religious, legal, biographical, etc.) that help to tie each historical period to relevant pri- mary texts. Van De Mieroop stresses throughout the volume that there is often a range of possible  interpretations of the available evidence, from which he has chosen to present just one. Conflicting  views are highlighted in breakout boxes in which Key Debates in Egyptology (for example, the ques- tion of climate change and the First Intermediate Period, the identity of the Hyksos, and Cambyses’  treatment of the Apis bull, etc.) are discussed briefly. In addition, boxes containing Special Topics  provide in-depth information about various issues mentioned in each chapter. The volume opens by placing Egyptian history in its environmental and cultural contexts. Divided  into six parts, chapter 1, “Introductory Concerns,” delineates the chronological and geographical  boundaries that define the study of ancient Egypt before describing the country’s major environmental  features, its different forms of documentary evidence (papyri, ostraca, and monumental inscriptions),  the Egyptian concept of kingship, modern historical subdivisions, and Egypt’s prehistoric beginnings  (from the rise of agriculture to the early Naqada cultures). Thereafter the book usually devotes a single  chapter to each of the Early Dynastic, Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, Late, and Greco-Roman peri- ods, interspersed by the Intermediate periods, but due to the vast increase in written sources dating from  the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Dynasties, four chapters are assigned to the New Kingdom. In each  section, the complex interplay of internal politics, religion, and foreign relations is conveyed clearly  and succinctly. In chapter 2, “The Formation of the Egyptian State (ca. 3400–2686),” Van De Mieroop describes  how the late Naqada period until the end of the Second Dynasty saw the establishment of many of  Egypt’s fundamental cultural and political practices, from the ideals of kingship and canons of art and  architecture to—most importantly—the development of its written language. The expansion of the  country’s social, economic, and governmental structures during the Old Kingdom period is explored  in chapter 3, “The Great Pyramid Builders (ca. 2686–2345),” with emphasis on the impact of evolving  religious beliefs relating to the king. </page> <page sequence="2"> 710 Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.4 (2012) Political fragmentation is the theme for chapter 4, “The End of the Old Kingdom and the First  Intermediate Period (ca. 2345–2055),” in which the lives of elite officials and provincial overlords  are examined in light of the eventual collapse of centralized power at the end of the Sixth Dynasty.  Rather than a time of decline, for Van De Mieroop the First Intermediate Period was “when the regions  shared the wealth that the center had previously monopolized.” Chapter 5, “The Middle Kingdom (ca.  2055–1650),” outlines “a period of transformation,” which was marked by the reunification of the  country and then the royal campaigns of the Twelfth Dynasty that brought Egypt’s annexation of Nubia  and growing relationships with its neighbors to the east. A succession of weak, ephemeral kings in the  Thirteenth Dynasty, however, subsequently opened the way for foreign domination of the country’s  north, as indicated in chapter 6, “The Second Intermediate Period and the Hyksos (ca. 1700–1550).” Following a brief description of the battles that led to a reassertion of power by the Theban rulers  of the Seventeenth Dynasty, Van De Mieroop embarks on a detailed overview of the New Kingdom,  the period that “dazzles modern audiences.” Chapter 7, “The Birth of Empire: The Early 18th Dynasty  (ca. 1150–1390),” outlines the re-establishment of Egypt as a unified and robust nation, from Ahmose’s  expulsion of the Hyksos to extensive campaigns in Nubia, Syria, and Palestine by the Thutmosids.  Despite the widespread turmoil caused by Akhenaton’s radical religious reforms, described at length  in chapter 8, “The Amarna Revolution and the Late 18th Dynasty (ca. 1390–1295),” chapter 9, “The  Ramessid Empire (ca. 1295–1203),” reveals that Egypt not only ultimately regained its equilibrium,  but also enjoyed a period of sustained growth and consolidation of its power, initiated by Sety I and  Rameses II. Chapter 10, “The End of Empire (ca. 1213–1070),” completes Van De Mieroop’s treatment  of the New Kingdom, focussing on the late Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties and the ensuing chaos  of internal strife and threats from both Libya and the enigmatic “Sea Peoples.” Although sources are limited, chapter 11, “The Third Intermediate Period (ca. 1069–715),” describes  well Egypt’s decline between the Twenty-first and Twenty-fifth Dynasties to a “plaything caught in the  midst of struggling alien powers.” Libyan kings brought major changes to the country, despite their  adherence to Egyptian traditions and reliance on the cult of Amun to validate their right to rule. As  chapter 12, “Egypt in the Age of Empires (ca. 715–332),” shows, this was also the case in the Late  period, when Nubian and later Assyrian and Persian invaders “fashioned a hybrid culture” based on  Egyptian and foreign elements, which Alexander of Macedon eventually inherited. Indeed, the country  described in chapter 13, “Greek and Roman Egypt (ca. 332 b.c.–a.d. 395),” is a multicultural mix in  which foreign practices now dominated. Under the authority and influence of Ptolemaic kings and then  Roman emperors, Egypt gradually lost touch with its ancient identity after its written language was  outlawed in the late fourth century a.d. Carefully chosen drawings and photographs enrich each of the chapters. I particularly appreciated  the copious use of maps scattered throughout the volume to reflect the changing loci of importance dur- ing different eras. Line drawings and diagrams illustrate artifacts, architectural plans, and sites, such as  the Giza plateau, royal tombs at Kerma, the Atum temple at Karnak, and the city of Alexandria during  the Ptolemaic period. Many of the numerous black-and-white photographs, and all of the stunning set  of twelve color plates located in the center of the volume, illustrate faces and anthropomorphic figures,  as though to emphasize the human side of Egypt’s history. The excellent annotated Guide to Further  Reading (and associated bibliography) at the end of the book not only offers the reader a wide range  of additional reference material, but also pertinent institutional and project websites that give access to  photographic and other databases. A glossary of terms used in the book completes the helpful resources  provided. This information is also made available on a companion website, where instructors can  access full-color PowerPoint slides of all the illustrations found in the text, as well as extra web-only  images and discussion questions relating to each chapter. The balance of breadth and detail offered by A History of Ancient Egypt make it an ideal college- level textbook, but it will equally provide a thoroughly up-to-date sourcebook for anyone who wishes  to better understand and appreciate Egypt’s sweeping political saga.
