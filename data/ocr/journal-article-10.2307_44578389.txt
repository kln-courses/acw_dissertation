<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMPARATIVE METHODS IN MYTHOLOGY1 DAVID KONSTAN It is a critical commonplace that we do not have Greek myths. Rather, we have reports of myths, either embedded in works of liter- ature or abstracted from such works in the form of handbooks (like that attributed to Apollodorus) or scholia. That is why there is some- thing naughty about the proposition enunciated by Marcel Detienne: "Mythology is written." Detienne continues: "There is no mythology, in the Greek sense, except in mythographic form, in writing, through the writing that traces its boundaries, that outlines its figure. And it is through an illusion, that, since the nineteenth century, mythology has come to be the speech, the song, and the voice of origins."2 De- tienne's move toward deconstructing mythology as a discipline has radical implications for the nature of myth: "A heterogeneous figure drawn by procedures of exclusion and movements of partition, mythology designates neither a specific literary genre nor a particular type of narration." As students of mythology, our subject becomes, on this view, not myths as such, but the ways in which mythological discourse is constructed. In the present report, I shall examine several ways in which contemporary theory constructs mythological discourse. Each of these theories inaugurates its own partition, and seeks to enucleate a specifically mythic content from the record. The nature of myth, the 1 This paper is a slightly revised version of a talk presented at the 1984 meeting of the American Philological Association, in a panel on "Comparative Methodology in Classical Studies: Procedures, Profits, Perils," organized and moderated by Professor Meyer Reinhold.

What counts as myth depends upon the theory that discloses it. To a certain extent, no doubt, every theory, including those in the physical sciences, constitutes the objects of investigation within a precritically intuited domain.3 The meaning of force in modern physics has only a very special connection with the use of the word "force" in ordinary language. Mythology, however, seems an exemplary instance of this rule, for the variety of current theories calls into question the unity or coherence of the thing they explain. Interpretation rules, and the object dissolves into multiple facets, according to the various angles of vision from which it is inspected. Mythology, then, appears by its nature to be a hermeneutic dis- cipline, and to define myth is to discover principles of interpretation - without necessarily insisting on reducing such principles to a single system. One may inquire further into the reasons why mythology should be constituted as a discipline, or perhaps a collection of dis- ciplines, under particular historical circumstances. What inspires the partition of the text into mythos and logosi Detienne asserts that the new mythology of the nineteenth century arose out of a "sense of scandal:" "mythology is what is left out of the religious tradition of the Greeks after scholars in the second half of the nineteenth century, all sharing the same implicit knowledge, have removed from the tradition all elements that are compatible with their own dominant representation of the divine. Everything held to be immoral or in- decent thus immediately falls into the domain of mythology."4 De- tienne reads this process as the reflex of a similar movement of ex- clusion in Greece from the sixth to the fourth centuries B.C., marked broadly by the figure of Xenophanes at the beginning and of Thu- cydides and Plato at the end. Xenophanes was shocked at popular Greek tales about the activities of gods and heroes, and his attitude was doubtless shared, as Detienne says, by many nineteenth-century 3 See Pierre Macherey, A Theory of Literary Production , trans. Geoffrey Wall (London, 1978), ch. 2, "Domain and Object," 5-7; also Luc Brisson, Platon: Les mots et les mythes (Paris, 1982), 170-173, who discusses the constitutive role of theory in the context of a reply to Detienne's book.

But we may also recall Xenophanes' saying that the gods of the Ethiopians are snub-nosed and swarthy, while those of the Thracians have blue eyes and red hair.5 There is a theory at work here, which we may elicit as the general rule that anthropomorphic repre- sentations of the gods are reducible to projections of human attributed onto the divine. Xenophanes employed this insight to debunk anthro- pomorphism (extending it in the process to cover the kinds of repre- sentations of the gods that cattle, horses and lions would make, if they had hands). But his approach is also comparative. He discovers a principle of mythic form by abstracting from cross-cultural evidence. Never mind that Xenophanes probably knew little or nothing of the Ethiopians' religion, and simply attributed to them a practice anal- ogous to that of the Greeks. (His rule would not apply, for example, to the theriocephalic deities of the Egyptians.) The Greeks at the time of Xenophanes were aware both of variations and analogies be- tween other cultures and their own, and were eager to understand the rules behind the differences. Whatever the case may have been with Xenophanes, it is certain, at all events, that a new and urgent interest in the cultures of remote peoples was crucial to the development of mythology as a discipline in the nineteenth century, as even the men- tion of the names of Müller, Tylor, Lang and Frazer will recall. Today, certainly, the number of approaches to the interpre- tation of myth is bewildering, although it is possible to suggest some principles of classification, to which I shall return shortly. Against all such approaches may be levelled the charge of selectivity. This is not to say that selection and exclusion are vicious, for no other pro- cedure is possible. Myth, as Detienne says, is predicated on a par- tition. Or, to put it differently, the absence of the entity under in- vestigation means that the identification of myth, as opposed to the versions in which it is recorded, demands in advance an act of interpre- tation. In this the Greeks, no less than we, were constrained by the nature of the matter. Wilamowitz's project to reject concepts derived from modern anthropology in favor of "thinking in Greek" about Greek religion is mistaken in principle, if it is meant to get us closer not to what the Greeks thought about myth, but to what Greek myth really was.6 5 Xenophanes, fr. 16 Diels-Kranz; cf. also fr. 15. 6 See Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Der Glaube der Hellenen (Berlin, 1931- 32), 10.</page><page sequence="4">90 David Konstan With myth, we must interpret. But how? By what method or process of exclusion? Few, I imagine, are immune to the excitement brought to the study of Greek mythology by the approaches of Lévi- Strauss, Dumézil, Eliade, or Detienne, for instance. But on what basis does one decide that one or another is to be preferred? Many may have felt the perplexity that led me, in my course on mythology, to define Greek myths as whatever was included in a handbook of mythology, whether ancient or modern. In doing so, of course, I opted for the version rather than for myth itself, and neglected to define a proper object of theoretical inquiry. I shall not attempt to develop here criteria of usefulness or generality or complexity by which to evaluate the several approaches to myth. I shall, instead, simply examine in a very cursory way three methods: structuralism and the analysis of the Oedipus story; Dumé- zil's three functions and their relevance to Roman legend; and two contrasting Jungian interpretations of the story of Cupid and Psyche. But I shall first say a few words on the classification of mythological theories. I wish to suggest three principles that may be useful in the classification of approaches to myth. I call these: field of represen- tation, system of structural transformations, and master plot. By field of representation, I mean the subject or domain that is treated as the source or content of myth. For Xenophanes, for example, myths are about the divine. Lucretius' analysis of the Great Mother sym- bolism takes it as an allegory of physical nature. Some myths were referred to historical events, like the founding of cities. Others, or the same ones, were understood as allegories of the moral progress of the soul. Lévi-Strauss and Dumézil take social relations or ideology as the field of reference for myth. Myth may also be taken to have a purely aesthetic content.7 Structural transformation refers to the ways in which elements of myths are brought into relation with each other. For example, symbolic substitution is characteristic of Freudian theory, where a number of different images may stand for the same thing. Certain actions may also be regarded as functionally equivalent, such as finding and losing, sending and receiving. Or there may be trans- formations in the order of events according to morphological rules 7 In teaching mythology, I have found it convenient to organize my syllabus under these six headings: nature, the divine, the self, society, the past, and art.</page><page sequence="5">Comparative Methods in Mythology 91 such as those propounded by Propp for the Russian folktale. Struc- turalism has made us familiar with transformations of a higher order of complexity involving covarying pairs of categories, for example. Of course, any transformational procedure privileges just those elements which can be mapped according to its rules. I think of master plots as the homage that theory pays to the narrative power of myth. However much they may be subject to transformation, or analyzable into content or reference, certain stories seem to have a privileged status. This is especially clear, for instance, in the status of the Oedipal drama in Freudian theory, or in the story of the year-god in the vegetation theory of the Cambridge anthropologists, but it happens even with a method like that of Lévi- Strauss, which ostensibly eschews a concern with narrative order in favor of generative rules. In his analysis of the Oedipus myth, to which we shall return, Lévi-Strauss remarked that one must "read from left to right, column after column" - that is, roughly, according to the sequence of events - if one desires "to understand the myth."8 The structuralist interpretation of the Oedipus myth offered by Lévi-Strauss almost thirty years ago, largely in a heuristic spirit, has recently been defended with vigor and learning by K. R. Walters, in a paper called "Another Showdown at the Cleft Way."9 1 shall, for the sake of convenience, discuss the structuralist approach by refer- ence to Walters' article, and as I shall, naturally enough, be selecting certain problems, as I see them, in the method, I wish to make it clear I find his contribution both intelligent and stimulating, and I recom- mend it highly. Walters concedes an error in Lévi-Strauss' original interpretation: the name of Laius, Oedipus' father, cannot mean "left-sided." But he rescues the substance of the argument by deriving 8 Claude Lévi-Strauss, "The Structural Study of Myth," Journal of American Folklore 78 (1955), 428-44, reprinted in Thomas A.

In the terms I have suggested above, Walters thus keeps the field of represen- tation posited by the structuralist interpretation safe from the attack of philological criticism.10 This is ingenious. Whether it justifies the thesis that the content of the myth is the problem of sexual reproduc- tion versus autochthony is another matter. Walters cites an observation of Edmund Leach's on the ap- parent inverse relationship between the story of Oedipus and that of Phaedra and Hippolytus.11 Walters carries the suggestion further: "In fact, the two stories are merely transformations of each other, that is, they are different versions of the same myth." In the Oedipus myth, transgression moves upward a generation, while in the Phaedra story it goes down one: Oedipus sleeps with his mother and kills his father; Hippolytus' stepmother desires him and his father is respon- sible for his death. There are two further differences: Oedipus' act is unintentional, while Phaedra's is not, and Oedipus actually sleeps with his mother, while Phaedra dies innocent of Hippolytus. Walters summarizes: "By a few transformational rules, changing the roles of father and son and of mother and son in their respective interactions, alternating the success or failure of incest and the actors' knowledge about their relations, one story can be turned into the other" (p. 343). Now, the covariation of success and intentionality is a necessary one. If an action does not take place, how else are we to identify it as per- taining to the myth save that it was intended by a character? But in- cluding intentionality along with murder of kin, for example, as a variable in versions of a myth raises a special problem. Walters ex- poses the fallacy of imagining that "the characters of a myth are personalities with hopes, fears, motivations, and intentions" (p. 346). But if the Oedipus story and the myth of Phaedra are to be versions of the same myth, intention must be taken into account: without it, there is no transformation of the events in one into those of the other, since in Phaedra's case, there is no act, only intention. If failure is a version of success, can we eliminate psychology from myth? Walters has a further piece of evidence for the connection between the two stories. If the Phaedra myth is a variant of the Oedipus myth, he argues, then "one might expect" to find such a 10 See James H. Dee, "Lévi-Strauss at the Theban Gates," CW 72 (1979), 257-61. 11 Walters, 342; Edmund Leach, Claude Lévi-Strauss (New York, 1970), 80.</page><page sequence="7">Comparative Methods in Mythology 93 version in the repertoire of tales about Oedipus himself (p. 343). And so there is. Oedipus was, in one account, fortunate enough to remarry after the ugly business with Jocasta, but his new wife pretended that his children had tried to rape her; as a result, Oedipus cursed them (Pherecydes, FGrHist 3F95). "What is significant about this tradition," Walters writes, "is that Lévi-Strauss' theory of the transformationality of myths predicts its possible existence" (p. 343). I suppose that it ought also to predict a variant of the Phaedra story that exhibits the Oedipal paradigm. But I shall look rather at another mythic tale that, on a hint in Lévi-Strauss' original paper, may also be seen as a variant of the Oedipus story: I mean the myth of Perseus.12 An oracle warned that Perseus would slay his maternal grand- father (his father, being Zeus, was unavailable for murder), and he was, accordingly, set afloat in a chest along with his mother Danae. In the land where they found refuge, the king became enamored of Danae, and sought to eliminate Perseus by sending him to fetch Medusa's head. With the help of winged sandals and an invisibility cap, as well as the use of his wits, Perseus overcame the Gorgon. His wits were used in two ways: he snatched the single eye of the three Graiae (sisters of the three Gorgons), thus forcing them to reveal the way to Medusa, and he attacked Medusa by observing her reflec- tion in his shield, which took the zap out of her gaze. After slaying a serpent and rescuing Andromeda, he returned home, saved his mother from the unwelcome attentions of the king, and at last rediscovered his grandfather, whom he accidentally killed with a discus throw. He then left Argos for Tiryns, where he founded the royal line. It is easy to see what attracted Lévi-Strauss' notice here. Perseus is a fated parricide (or avicide); he slays the only mortal husband his mother might have had. Like Oedipus, Perseus must leave his native city (Argos), then his adopted city, and finally his original home a second time, and the Gorgon is roughly comparable to the sphinx. In both myths, vision is stressed, but with different signs: where Oedipus loses his eyes, Perseus effectively gains one from the Graiae. Thanks to his invisibility, he can see without being seen - again the reverse of Oedipus' situation. The motif is repeated in the battle with Medusa, where Perseus shields himself from her gaze while keeping her in view. Further, where Oedipus is lame, Perseus 12 Lévi-Strauss (above, note 8), 181.</page><page sequence="8">94 David Konstan can fly: enhancement of ankles, as opposed to mutilation of ankles. With these structural resemblances and inversions, one might almost have predicted a variant of the Oedipus story in which Oedipus was set adrift in a chest. And indeed, I have learned from Walters' article that such a version exists.13 Do we then have another story of autoch- thony here? Or shall we abandon this content for the myth and limit our description to formal patterns, such as doubling in the slaying of grandfather and mother's suitor on the one hand, and in the rescue of wife and mother on the other? More generally, we may perhaps analyze the relation of the Oedipus to the Perseus myth as a kind of condensation: Oedipus slays the monster and wins the bride and kills the opponent and returns to his original home all at the same time, and in a single place. "The service of the myths," Georges Dumézil has written, "is to define sharply, by magnification, the distinctive features of the ideological concepts and of the figures of the theology."14 The primary ideological concepts in Dumézil's system of interpretation are, as is well known, the three social functions of kingship, the warrior caste, and production - the last of which embraces both agriculture, along with crafts, and reproduction. The three functions or classes constitute the field of representation. On the whole, this ideological structure seems not to have been well preserved in Greek myths, but it does, Dumézil argued, provide the key to the interpretation of early Roman legends, which are a transcription of divine myths into the register of saga or history. Once this structural transformation is understood, one may recognize in Roman legend the ideology that informs Indo-Iranian mythology, Celtic saga, and other Indo-Euro- pean traditions. In particular, Roman tradition manifested this structure in the form of "a succession of kings, each of whom, by his character, his founding actions, his entire life, expresses and adds to the common undertaking one of the functions, or an aspect of one of the functions, necessary to the welfare of the society."15 Thus, Dumézil takes the third of the Roman kings, Tullus Hostilius, to represent the warrior function, while Ancus Marcius, the fourth king, is emblematic of the third or productive function. The reason for the lack of tally between the numerical order of king and function is that the first, or 13 Schol. Eurip. Phoen. 26, 28; Hyg. Fab. 66, cit.

I have no wish to indulge in frivolous criticism of Dumézil's rich theory.16 Anyone who has worked closely with the sources has undoubtedly conjured with other patterns to account for the royal succession, such as an alternation of violent and benign kings. Some- thing like this was proposed recently by Marshall Sahlins in his in- augural address to the anthropological section of ANZAAS entitled "The Stranger-King or Dumézil among the Fijians."17 Locating Dumézil in Polynesia is not so far-fetched as it may seem, since Dumézil himself pointed to the connection between aspects of sovereignty in Polynesia and in Rome.18 Sahlins' paper advances the theoretical proposition that the systems of categories represented in myth have a diachronic dimension. That is, the values of elements in paired op- positions, for example male and female, may change or reverse them- selves in a single myth. Sahlins attributes this variation not to an inherent ambiguity in the terms or narrative, but to a "generative development of the categories" (p. 132). I shall leave aside the details of the Fijian case; the example that Sahlins offers from Roman legend is the succession of Romulus by Numa which inaugurates an alter- nation between "magical war kings and religious peace kings," or, more abstractly, "between the opposed poles of State and Society" (p. 122). Like Aeneas before him, Romulus is an invader, a "virile young warrior and penetrator from the outside" (p. 121). The indig- enous people are, at this moment in the unfolding of the story, asso- ciated with growth and agriculture, "the side of woman," Sahlins says, apparently adopting a Fijian expression. The local people are the wife-givers. But the foreign king is domesticated, through his elevation to the status of an indigenous deity, the god Quirinus. Sahlins observes that "the original Polynesian chief is likewise his own sacrificial victim and the' lost god of his people" (p. 122). Upon 16 For a review of the problems associated with DuméziFs interpretation of early Roman legend, see Arnaldo Momigliano, "Georges Dumézil and the Trifunctional Approach to Roman Civilization," History and Theory 23 (1984), 312-30. 17 Journal of Pacific History 16 (1981), 107-32. For another attempt at theorizing a diachronic interpretation of structuralist categories, see Valerio Valeri, "The Trans- formation of a Transformation: A Structural Essay on an Aspect of Hawaiian History (1809-1819)," Social Analysis 10 (1982), 3-32. 18 See L'Héritage indo-européen à Rome (Paris, 1949), 41-42, cit Sahlins, 111.</page><page sequence="10">96 David Konstan Romulus' death, the monarchy passes to Numa, whose reforms repre- sent "the more general popular interest which he, as a member of the indigenous people, is able to incarnate." Sahlins is rather elliptical on the Roman material, and I am not sure that I understand his argument perfectly. He appears to treat the Sabines simply as the native population of the territory around Rome, analogous to the position of the Latins under Latinus upon the arrival of the Trojans. In the rape of the Sabine women, however, the Romans are represented as having captured their wives from outside their own domain. Perhaps this is one of those contradictions that can be disambiguated by analyzing the narrative into two distinct moments, in which the opposition of inner and outer shifts valences. Unfortunately, the only way of knowing whether this is right involves situating the myth in a ritual structure, and with Roman legend this is quite impossible - if indeed the myth ever did pertain to royal installation or the like. Sahlins remarks that the "duality of the sovereign authority is a condition of the 'general sociology' of all such kingdoms, Polyne- sian as much as Indo-European. The king is able to rule society, which is to say to mediate between its antithetical parts, in so far as the sovereign power itself partakes of the nature of the opposition, com- bines in itself the elementary antithesis" (p. 122). As we have seen, universalizing the dual aspect of kingship may bring the analysis of the Roman tradition into conflict with Dumézil's tri-functional decoding of the first four Roman kings. Sahlins' temporalization of myth, his argument that we must relate the values of paired opposites to their position in a ritual or social practice represented by moments of narrative evolution, calls into question any uniform attribution of symbolic values to the Greek or Roman myths, whose relation to ritual, if it ever existed, is obscure to us. The problem is inherent in abstracting myths from their recorded versions, stripping away the social or ideological practices in which the narratives as we have them were produced. For my last example of mythological analysis, I shall turn to a method in which the field of reference is personal rather than social, that is, the Jungian approach. We are fortunate to have two extensive analyses from this school of the story of Cupid and Psyche, as told by Apuleius in the Metamorphoses . Erich Neumann's book, Amor and Psyche , bears the subtitle, "The Psychic Development of the Fern-</page><page sequence="11">Comparative Methods in Mythology 97 inine," which indicates the main lines of his interpretation.19 Psyche is the archetypal feminine soul (pp. 121, 129), much the way Heracles and Perseus, according to Neumann, represent the masculine ego (p. 107). The oracle of Apollo, which condemns Psyche to a living death as the bride of a winged, serpentine monster, reflects the fact that, "from the standpoint of the matriarchal world . . . every marriage is an exposure on the mountain's summit in mortal loneliness, and a waiting for the male monster, to whom the bride is surrendered" (p. 62). Marie-Louise von Franz has preferred to interpret the story of Cupid and Psyche "from the standpoint of masculine psychology, as Lucius/ Apuleius' problem." She explains that Jung himself "be- lieved that it dealt chiefly with anima psychology," that is, with the psychology of the feminine aspect of the male psyche, but that "Neu- mann's attempt to interpret it from the feminine aspect could be accepted as well, since femininity in man is not absolutely dissimilar from the feminine in woman, although there is a different nuance."20 Von Franz explains that Venus orders Eros "to make the girl fall in love with the lowest of all human beings, but Eros going closer to his victim, prefers to be that lowest human being himself' (p. V. 11). Then the Delphic oracle intervenes: "something from the collective unconscious voices the wish that a union between Eros and Psyche, the human incarnation of Venus, should take place" (p. V. 12). Once again, I have no wish to offer facile criticism of a profound tradition. Several years ago, I had the opportunity to deliver a talk on Apuleius' Metamorphoses before the C. G. Jung Institute in Los Angeles. I ventured to suggest on that occasion that philology might find itself at war with psychology over the interpretation of the Cupid and Psyche story, because it could be shown, I believe conclusively, that the story is not an elementary myth, but rather a composite narrative whose parts were cleverly stitched together by Apuleius himself. Thus, to look no further than the beginning of the tale, Apuleius combines two different punishments for Psyche's divine beauty: first, Venus spitefully commands Cupid to make Psyche fall in love with the most wretched man on earth, and second, Psyche's beauty is so great as to discourage all suitors. As a result, her parents consult Apollo's oracle, 19 Amor and Psyche: The Psychic Development of the Feminine , trans.

The ambig- uous description of the monster in the oracle may be taken to refer either to the wretched creature mentioned by Venus, or to Eros him- self. Thus it serves as a bridge between two distinct strands in the story.21 Does such an analysis of the structure of the tale tell against the Jungian interpretation? My audience at the Jung Institute did not think so.22 Myths have several levels, individual, social, and trans- personal, which the critic must sort out and interpret. I would add that the impossibility of reducing these levels to a single method reflects the discontinuity between the private, the political, and the collective aspects of life that is the condition of our own discourse. Our understanding of myth necessarily encodes this division. The identification and analysis of the multiple levels of myth invites comparative study. Recently, I came across an Egyptian folk- tale about a man who, on the assurance of Mohammad, consents to marry his daughter to a beast. Some time later, the father discovers his daughter in a palace of one hundred rooms - ninety-nine of these she may explore, but the hundredth is forbidden. Her father incites her curiosity, but a voice - the voice of her husband, who proves to be El-Khidr, a holy figure - prevents them from unlocking the door, which contains the steed on which Muhammad will ride to heaven.23 A version of the Cupid and Psyche story? A descendant? Accidental resemblance? Surely a parallel, at all events, and one which, to my mind, at least, suggests how an elementary narrative might have been variously shaped under the constraints of two powerful and distinct 21 See Fritz Erik Hoevels, Märchen und Magie in den Metamorphosen des Apuleius von Madaura (Amsterdam, 1979), 39-43, for a suggestion concerning the background of this episode in folktale.

Such an integration of story and culture, while I shall not pursue it further here, offers a particularly promising ap- proach to comparative mythology.24 Wesleyan University 24 Elizabeth Traube of the Department of Anthropology at Wesleyan University brought the articles by Detienne, Sahlins, and Valeri to my attention, and offered valuable criticism on the entire paper in several drafts.
