<plain_text><page sequence="1">The border decoration of milanese manuscripts 1350-1420 Julian Treuherz It may seem of ¡marginal interest to ap- proach illuminated manuscripts through their border decorations. On the whole for Gothic ma- nuscripts it is the major miniature artist who gives a book its quality and standing. But it is the artist of the borders who gives the book its peculiar overall character. For example, the Très Belles Heures de Notre Dame1 has large miniatures in a number of different styles ranging over a quarter of a cen- tury in execution, but its appearance is domina- ted by a page layout and a border decoration executed in the 1380s, contemporary with the earliest of the miniatures: a decoration which is not very different from that of books made thirty years earlier. There is not always such a separation bet- ween the artist or artists of the miniatures and those of the borders, but even so, border deco- ration tended to keep to its traditional forms, independent of the miniatures. In the Belles Heu- res of the Duc de Berry2, painted by the Limibourg brothers, the border to the Annunciation minia- ture is very advanced in style. But this cannot dispel the general impression given by the more traditional borders on every other page. In other cases, the major artist might execute all the bor- ders round his own miniatures, but the borders around text pages, left to assistants, remain unin- fluenced. This happened in a book of Hours in Oxford3 whose main artist was the Master of the Brussels Initials. Sometimes the main artist did himself execute, or at least determine the forms of all borders : Jean Pucelle, and illuminators of the East Anglian school brought to their borders constant variety and individuality matching that of their miniatures. But on the whole borders were given to assistants and were liable to standardisation and repetition. The assistants were not closely direc- ted by the main artist^, and in any case, the need for a clear and constant layout of the text was paramount. Visual inventiveness and distraction was restricted to the miniatures, or, if it could not be suppressed entirely, it made itself felt only through a framework of uniformity: the system of drolleries inhabiting repeated conventionalised foliage was the most widespread result. But, whilst it would be unprofitable to classify French or English illuminated manu- scripts of the period 1350-1400 by their borders, since their forms hardly change over the half- century, in Lombardy it is both possible and interesting to do so. There was variety and in- ventiveness in abundance, and the adventurous border decorations of the Italian artists had an international importance, for in France after 1400, when new kinds of borders came into use, they were invariably derived from Italian exam- ples. Bohemian manuscript borders of the early fifteenth century also have much in common with Italian decoration. It is not true to say, however,, that there was no standardisation in Lombardy. The Italian equivalent to the French vine or ivy leaf was the acanthus leaf which, despite some variation of colour and shape, had remained the classic Ita- lian border motif since the thirteenth century and was still common in the first decades of the fifteenth in its original, simple form4.

Acanthus foliage is an antique motif and , in the particular form found in Italy , it proba- bly derives from Byzantine Illumination. See M.

Perhaps a group of manuscripts decorated purely with this traditional species of foliage, all from the Visconti library, may be taken as a starting point5. Roughly datable examples which can be assigned to Milan and Pavia are: St. Augustine, Civitas Dei (Paris, Bibl. Nat., ms. lat. 2066) with emblems of Bruzio Visconti (d. 1356) ; 1 Liber Sancii Bernardi (Paris, Bibl. Nat., ms. lat. 1142) assigned to the reign of Galeazzo II (Lord of Milan 1354-78)6; Alfodhol de Merengi, Liber Iudicorum et Consiliorum (Paris, Bibl. Nat., ms. lat. 7327) da- ting from the reign of Bernabo Visconti (Lord of Milan 1378-85). Apart from acanthus leaves, the only mo- tifs used are arms and devices, with a few nude figures and animal heads. An identical form of leaf had been used in much earlier books, such as the highly decorated Liber Pantheon of God- frey da Viterbo7. But this book contained a large amount of decoration, figures and foliage, on many of its pages. In the later group the deco- ration was restricted to a full border around the opening pages and a few half borders or sprays of foliage attatched to initials scattered through the text. Thus these are very modest productions and of no remarkable quality. The second group contains both a different type of book and a different type of acanthus foliage, but insofar as it can be dated, it seems to overlap chronologically with the first group. Hours of Bianca of Savoy (Munich,, Staats- bibl., ms. lat. 23215) executed between 1350 and 1378 and signed by the artist Giovanni da Bene- detto da Como8. Hours (Modena, Bibl. Estense, ms. a 2.31 - lat. 862) written in Milano in 1383 for an uniden- tified patron. Part of the decoration is attributed to Giovanni da Benedetto da Como. Hours and Missal (Paris, Bibl. Nat., ms. lat. 757) executed between 1380 and 1395 for an uni- dentified member of the Visconti family9. 2,6 Lucan, De Bello Civili (Paris,, Bibl. Nat., ms. lat. 8045) part of whose decoration is signed by the artist Johannes de Castano10. The first three of these mark the debut in Italy of a new kind of book which was to become the most typical vehicle of the International Go- thic style, the de luxe book of Hours with lavish personalised decoration11. (The fourth is a far more modestly decorated text with borders in the same style). In the two of these Hours where the original campaign of decoration was completed12 every page has border decoration around at least three sides, a stunning contrast to the first group where only the opening pages are so decorated. These new borders are still made of acan- thus foliage but it has changed its appearance. There are now two different kinds: a showy spe- 2 cies, fuller, more luxuriant and variously coloured in richer and subtler shades when compared to the earlier kind. The second kind is smaller, less expansive, and restricted in colour to pink and blue, but is strikingly set against a background of cusped and burnished gold. The first sort is 3 most prominent in lat. 757 where it is used for the opening pages of liturgical divisions and some other pages, whilst the second is kept for the calendar and for lesser text pages. The technique is finer - instead of a perfunctory articulation of foliage in white line, the leaves are all shaded 5 The Visconti Library contained a large number of books decorated in this way.

Nevertheless the similar decoration of all these books demonstrates the generally unadventu- rous background out of which the later decorations developed. 6 E.

The bur- nished gold is liberally used among the leaves to fill interstices, to make starry dots and cusped panels to set off the foliage and initials. New sorts of flower terminals and leaves enrich the acanthus : trumpet^, ears of corn, petalled flowers and kite shaped leaves on hairline stems13. As in 2, 3, 5, 6 earlier Italian books, nude putti and tiny birds 2,6 inhabit the foliage but they are joined by fash- ionably dressed court ladies, monkeys, dogs and wild men14. 3,5,6 Even this luxuriance hardly serves as ade- quate preparation for the lavish books of the 1390s : Hours of Gian Galeazzo Visconti (Lord of Milan 1385, Duke 1395-1402; the Hours divided between Milan, Coll. Visconti di Modrone, and Florence, Bibi. Naz., Fondo Landau-Finaly ms. 22) executed before 139515. Hours of Isabella of Castile (The Hague, Bibl. Roy., ms. 76.F.6) written for an unidentified original owner16. 8, 9 Roderici Fonsecae Lusitani, Historia Plan- tarum (Romç, Bibl. Cas., ms. 456) made for Wen- ceslas of Luxembourg, King of the Romans (de- posed 1400)17. 10,11,12 The two books of Hours have a full border around almost every page of their original deco- ration : the Historia Plantarum has decorated initials with border sprays on every page and elaborate full borders for the frequent subdivi- sions of the text. But whilst these books equal the previous group in the amount of their border decoration, they far outstrip them in variety : for every page was now made to look different from every other. Variation was no longer restricted to the grotesque and heraldic elements within a repeated decorative framework but was now ex- tended to the framework itself. For this framework acanthus itself was not superseded : it was used in some cases with -grea- ter depth and richness than ever, but now it was used as one of a large repertoire of motifs - ani- mals, birds, human figures, portraits, architecture, lettering, heraldry, leaves, flowers and purely de- corative patterns. The treatment as well as the 7,12 subjects were equally diverse : hard and soft;, flat and solid, stylised and naturalistic all coexist. Naturalistic trees are shown in a flat, hard man- 9 ner and conventional foliage is deeply modelled ; animals and birds are soft and realistic or linear 8 and fantastic ; initials are made of flat interlaced 7 line, three-dimensional spiral ribbon, solid archi- tecture, human figures or even landscapes. 10,12 For the grotesque elements within the de- corative framework of the border, traditional marginal figures were used as before - dogs, monkeys, birds, putti, wild men, court ladies wi- thin the foliage. But figures were also shown in 10 transformed settings : animals sit on grassy mounds,, birds perch on thorny branches, putti climb up tree trunks. 8»9 The total composition of the pages is also varied. Sometimes the text is neatly framed and the area around it left blank, sometimes small shapes, dots, stars, radiances or flowers are scat- tered over the page surface; sometimes the page is kept busy by an all-over network of linear de- coration or the border is made a solid mass of 7 gold and colour. Thus the border is no longer seen as an element of continuity, essential in ma- king it easy for the eye to concentrate on the text. In fact, this group sees a merging together of the different constituents of an illuminated page: the text, its illustration in the miniatures and its decoration in the border. In the previous group, firstly there were the pages with full-page miniatures, often framed with a panel-like ilki- sionistic moulding and a mock predella 'beneath. These pages illustrated the text with the subjects customary for books of Hours but were on dif- ferent pages from the text, and were surrounded by blank borders without rich decoration. Second- 4 ly,, there were the text pages, surrounded not by any related illustration but by incidental deco- ration. In the later group many text pages had 2 purely decorative borders as before. But pages 8 with full-page narrative miniatures were surroun- ded by elaborate decorative borders, and text pages marking liturgical divisions were given illu- strative as well as decorative importance by the enlarging and historiation of the initials, by ela- borating the bas-de-page scenes, and by merging 13 The kite shaped leaves and the gold cusping oc- cur also in contemporary English borders. Their ap- pearance in Italy is possibly connected with the pre- sence of Englishmen in Italy for the marriage of Violanta Visconti to Lionel , Duke of Clarence in 1368. But in view of the dullness of the English man- uscripts surviving from this time , the connection , if it is such , seems surprising. See C.

Thus text, miniatures and border decoration were no longer kept visually distinct hut were combined on the same pages18. The creation of this kind of decoration is associated with the name of Giovannino de' Gras- si19. Only the Visconti Hours is of sufficient qua- lity to be in his hand : the Hours of Isabella is by the Master of the Modena Prayerbook, though the type of decoration is unmistakably derived from de' Grassi. The Historia Plantarum is of too uneven quality to be anything but a workshop production. Two further books associated with de' Grassi are : Beroldo, Breviarium Ambrosianum et Ordi- nēs Mediolanensis Ecclesiae (Milan, Bibl. Triv., cod. 2262-A.l), text written in 1396 and decoration before 1398; artist's name documented. 13 Bible (Milan, Bibl. Braidense, ms. A.E. XIV 24-7), in four volumes, from the Certosa di Santa Maria delle Grazie near Pavia. As far as quality is concerned the whole of the Beroldo and those parts of the Bible which may be attributed to de' Grassi himself, surpass all the lesser books of the period. But these two works do not come into the same luxurious class as the elaborate books of Hours because there are four-sided borders only on the opening pages of each volume. These two books show a similar taste for variety, though on a less extensive scale. The main vehicles of this variety are small sprays attached to initials throughout the text: there is more continuity of page layout than in the books just examined. Again there are traces of acanthus foliage among the other imotifs, but in general the sprays have a different appearance from ear- lier books. The new forms have a linear emphasis which, particularly in the initials with fine leaf and flower ends, produces a dainty and light appearance unlike the fleshy aspect of the lobed acanthus leaf. This daintiness is also seen in the sprays using flamboyant architectural tracery pat- terns, and in the clusters of gold lozenges surro- unded by a haze of tiny dotted radiances. In the 10 Beroldo the initials are quite unlike the earlier acanthus type of initial and spray. For now, they are enlivened not only by delicate scenes inside them, which also occur in the Bible, but also by the tiny figures of angels with spreading wings and fluttering draperies, who perform a variety of actions in the margins beside the initials. 13 The luxurious books of the second and third groups were exceptional works for exalted patrons, but their richness and variety was re- flected in more modestly decorated books,, as mentioned above : that of the second group in the copy of Lucan and that of the third in the Bible and the Beroldo. The books illuminated by other masters working at this time in Milan and Pavia also fall into the more modest class, and show similar ideas of novelty and variety filtering down from the greater to less original and often quite mediocre artists. For instance there are several books which contain competent imitation of features introdu- ced by de' Grassi, with figures modelled in a soft sfumato which also derives from him20. These books contain dainty little flower ends, sparkling leaf and flower patterns, anthropomorphic initials. But though these individual features caught on, the context and extent of their use has not the striking impact of their original models. De' Grassi seems to have had a liberating influence in the case of the following : Gospel Lectionary (Oxford, Bod. Lib., ms. Can. lit. 376) presented by Gian Galeazzo Visconti (d. 1402) to his foundation of 1395, the Certosa at Pavia21. Epistolary (Milan, Bibl. Braidense, ms. A.D. XIV 30) pendant to the above. Hours, use of Milan (ex-Dyson Perrins Coll.)22. 14 The first two open with full borders and a number of large initials follow. The third has more full borders and smaller initials. All the decoration is of high quality. It shows a similar taste to that of de' Grassi in its fondness of ex- quisite birds and in its love of a busy surface full of small sharply pointed or cusped leaves,, which is also perhaps a development of the deco- rations on the miniature pages of lat. 757. But 4 is seems that de' Grassi had opened the way for a personal inventiveness of decorative motifs : these books have a unique individuality and is in integrating text , miniatures and border decora- tions, the Italian artists also destroyed the tension between the flat , surface-emphasising elements of the book page - script and pattern - and the spa- tial, solid elements, which miniature painters had assimilated from trecento monumental painting. This seems to have been a characteristic of the best of International Gothic illumination, and is particularly evident in the Très Riches Heures of the Limbourg brothers (Chantilly, Musée Condé) and also in the work of the Master of the Gerona Martyrology. See O. Pacht, A Bohemian Martyrology, Burlington Ma- gazine, LXXIII, 1938, p. 198, and also Pachťs essay « Die Gotik der Zeit um 1400 als gesamt europäische kunst-sprache » in Europäische Kunst um 1400 (Ca- talogue of exhibition held at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), Vienna 1962, p. 59. io For Giovannino de ' Grassi see Toesca, La pittura, p. 135-47, and also Arte Lombarda (Catalogue of Mi- lan Exhibition), p. 31-5. Giovannino seems to have directed a workshop which included his brother Porrino, his son Salomone, and at least one garzone. 20 These books include Guido delle Colonne, Storia Troiana (Milan, Bibl. Braidense, ms. del Fondo Ca- stiglione ; repr. in Toesca, La pittura, pl. 281) and Dante Alighieri, La Divina Commedia (Florence, Bibl. Naz., ms. B. R. 39). 2i Reproduction in O. Pacht and J. J. G.

This can not be said of the leaf decoration of other contemporary artists : here the norm seems to be a mixture of rather uninspired copy- ing of superficial features with a basic adherence to the earliest and simplest forms of acanthus foliage. This is borne out by the works of Anovelo da Imbonate23. Coronation Missal of Gian Galeazzo Vi- sconti (Milan, Bibi. della Basilica di Sanť Ambro- gio, ms. 6) signed and dated 1395. 15,16 Antiphonal and Graduai (Oxford, Bod. Lib., ms. lat. liturg. a 4), the text written in Milan in 1399. Missal of the church of Santa Tecla, Milan (Milan, Bibl. Cap., ms. II, D .1.2) dated 1402. Anovelo's work in the two missals is an attempt at a rich effect inspired evidently by the Visconti Hours. The borders sparkle with small, sharp lozenges, dots and stars; there is a donor portrait in one of the margins of the Santa Tecla missal; on the Coronation page of the other the 15 heraldic animals and birds at the sides and the foliage shapes at the top are very like those in the Visconti Hours. On the other hand, all the decoration on these pages does not stray far from acanthus foliage and therefore lacks the distinguishing feature of de' Grassi's books - their variety. Anovelo's foliage in the two missals resembles that of lat. 757 but is less refined, introducing 6,15,16 rather large flower terminals. His conservatism is confirmed by the vast Antiphonal, whose dis- appointingly dull and meagre decoration consists solely of acanthus foliage and a few historiated initials, enlivened by a few of the flower termi- nals. Most pages of this tome carry no decoration at all: what there is shows little development from the plain kind of acanthus with which this survey began. This basically traditional kind of foliage is also seen in the work of the Master of the Modena Prayerbook24. Besides his decoration of the de luxe Hours of Isabella of Castile, already considered, he worked on: Hours (Modena, Bibl. Estense, ms. a R.7.3- lat. 842) begun in 1387 for a Milanese owner. Hours (Parma, Bibl. Pal., ms. 56) whose patron is unknown. Psalter (Oxford, Bod. Lib., ms. Can. lit. 378) written for the Carthusian House of Carignanq, near Milan. 17 Missal (London, Victoria and Albert Mu- seum, ms. Reid 66) written for an unidentified Milanese owner. 18 Gualterus Anglicus, Romulae Fabulae (Bolo- gna, Bibl. Univ., ms. 1213) for an unknown patron. The work of this Master in the Hours of Isabella of Castile is very striking, dependent though it is on the work of de' Grassi25. His other books show traces of this influence in the fre- quent architectural and anthropomorphic initials 17 the decorated frame bands and the occasional large border figures. But despite this, the Master relies heavily on traditional acanthus foliage as his major decorative motif. This applies not only to the Missal, the Psalter and the Fabulae, which are modest books with only a few decorated pa- ges, but also to the two books of Hours, which have some sort of decoration on almost every page. Frequently his pages give an ungainly im- pression through their unbalanced compositions 18 or their clumsily elongated foliage26. It must not be forgotten that in the work of both Anovelo and the Modena Master the tra- ditional type of acanthus has indeed been slightly changed by enriching it with flower terminals: thistles, flowers with many petals, holly leaves, kite leaves and French vine leaves. Indeed these 16, 18 flowers are sometimes painted without the acan- thus foliage from which they originally bloomed. 18 But there is no resemblance to the enriched acan- thus of the lat. 757 group: here the decoration is rather ungracefully painted in the standard restricted colours, directly continuing the plainest forms seen in the first group. This continuity can be traced alongside the contrary development toward greater magni- ficence and variety. For there had always been a steady stream of less elaborate books which were unadventurous in their decoration. In addition to the oeuvres just discussed, the eighties saw a homogeneous group of books, all decorated in the same hand, which has nothing in common with its more elaborate contempora- ries. This consists of copies of the works of Lucan27 : De Bello Civili (London, Brit. Mus., ims. Harley 2532) 23 For his oeuvre , see Arte Lombarda (Catalogue of Milan Exhibition ), p. 41-3; Toesca, La pittura, p. 148; Pacht and Alexander, Bodleian Library: 2, no. 186. 24 For this artist , see Arte Lombarda (Catalogue of Milan Exhibition), p. 39-41 ; Arslan, Riflessioni, p. 34- 36; A.

Radaeli, Nuovo contributo al catalogo del Miniatore de' a R.7.3 di Modena, Giornale di Bordo , II, 2, 1968 , p. 65. 25 it is just possible that it was the Modena Master who originated the striking type of decoration and de' Grassi who imitated it. But de ' Grassi's work outside the collaboration is constantly inventive, whereas the Modena Master's is nearly all dull. This suggests that his adventurousness in this book can be attributed to the influence of de' Grassi. 26 Reproductions in Arslan, Riflessioni, plates 15, 16. 27 Pacht and Alexander, Bodleian Library: 2, p. 19, no. 193.

In a different hand,, but very similar both in forms and in scheme of decoration is De Bello Civili (Paris, Bibi. Nat., ms. lat. 8043) These are all verv similar - they are simply adorned on only a few pages with acanthus fo- liage just like that of the earliest group, but the date 1386 in one, and the presence of kite shaped leaves in several suggests a chronological near- ness to lat. 757. But unlike the latter, these books carry no enrichments, no grotesques, no unusual colours. Slightly later is an unusually richly colou- red type of acanthus border28: N. de Lyra, Postilla in Genesym (Paris, Bibl. Nat., ms. lat. 364) Boccaccio, De Genealogia Deorum (Paris, Bibl. Nat., ms. lat. 7877) with date 1388. 19 These stand apart somewhat from the rest because of their colour and the looseness of their forms, but they do employ some of the flower terminals seen in the later variants of traditional acanthus decoration. Thus in Lombardy the traditional and progressive trends continued alongside each other. In France there was a similar development in the early fifteenth century when the use of stylised vine leaf borders continued alonside the more elaborate foliage, incorporating acanthus from Italy, which had taken over for frontispiece pages29. But throughout the period a reverse mo- vement was also taking place, from France to Italy. To begin with, there is a group of manu- scripts which, though written in Italian script has decorations unmistakably French in style30: Petrarch, De Remediis Utriusque Fortunae (Paris, Bibl.

Vat., Reg. lat. 8477) The decorations in these, almost wholly of vine leaf, suggest that there were French artists working on Italian soil. It was perhaps the influence of these ar- tists, combined with the visual impact of books imported from France, which led Italian illumi- nators, some of whose work has been examined, to incorporate in their borders the traditional French vine leaf motifs. A book of Hours assi- gned to the same hand as lat. 757 (Paris, Bibl. Nat., ms. Smith-Lesoueff 22)31 has miniatures in the same style, but its borders are composed not of any form of acanthus, but of French-style vine leaves. The opening page to the Beroldo has a rather French appearance, due partly to the lay- out, with its bas-de-page scene, but also to the light trellis-like foliage32. More explicitly French is the foliage in burnished gold in an Ambrosian Missal (Milan, Bibl. Amb„ ms. E.18 inf.) illumi- nated by an associate of Anovelo. Anovelo him- self used French style diaper patterns and the 15, 16 Master of the Modena Prayerbook opened his Fabulae with a French type of border. But these are occasional instances. For a more consistent synthesis of French and Italian decoration one must turn to the well-known and charming borders of Pietro da Pavia and his school, roughly contemporary with de Grassi33.

Decorations in a similar style are also seen on certain pages of the book of Hours (ex-Dyson Perrins coll.) already mentioned22. Italian borders use the acanthus leaf mo- ving in a series of undulating curves, a solidly modelled contrast to the lines of script; French borders use a light, spiky network of vine or ivy leaf, growing out of a more simply curved linear stem and often anchored into the text by a stra- 28 There is a difficulty about these two books , for despite strong Milanese connections in both script, arms and style of miniature painting (Toesca, La pit- tura, p. 147, n. 1; Pellegrin, Supplément, p. 18, 32) the borders are similar to those in a manuscript of Dante (The Dyson Perrins Collection, part 1, Sothe- by's , London , 1958 , p. 36-8, lot. 14) which is described as of Florentine origin. 29 See for example M. Meiss, French painting in the time of Jean de Berry: the Boucicaut Master, plates 87, 98. These pages from the same manuscript have very different borders. 30 See below, note 45.

The leaves are smaller and sharper and frame the text not solidly, but like a trellis, leaving the parchment showing through the lea- ves. Such French borders are often copied direc- tly by Pietro along with other French features such as diaper patterns, grotesque heads, dra- gons, monstrous drolleries and marginal scenes. But Pietro combines the French lightness of structure with a constant variety and novelty which is comparable to that of de' Grassi., though the forms actually used are very different. Thus vine leaves and acanthus are used together, but also seen is an infinite variety of forms ranging froim long, lanceolate leaves, crescents and holly 21 leaves to dainty rose leaves, buds and flowers. Dotted among them are tiny stars, spots and lo- zenges. The forms are loosely based on natural forms - leaves, stalks, seeds, buds - but repea- ted regularly down the page and given an unna- turalistic uniformity and hardness by a sharp precision of drawing. This preserves the French spiky quality which is added to an inventiveness unknown in France. And indeed, the luxuriance and variety of decoration seen in Lombard manuscripts was unique at this period, and had perhaps only been rivalled by the earlier schools of East Anglia and of Naples. Contemporary borders in France and England are both less interesting, less varied and less bold: in these countries border artists pre- ferred to keep to traditional motifs and compo- sitions,, vine leaf in France, and in England that hard stylised development from East Anglian borders seen in the repetitive Bohun manu- scripts34. As for the later developments in Lom- bardy, the style of de' Grassi lived on in the extremely hardened and coarsened imitations of it made by the Master of the Vitae Imiperatoruim and Belbello da Pavia, but the immediately suc- ceeding style of the years around 1400, that of Michelino da Besozzo, shows a reaction in favour of economy,, delicacy and refinement35. II The style known as International Gothic was primarily a court style. The variety and luxuriance of the book decorations described above is closely linked to the Visconti court milieu of their origin. For it has already been remarked that the earliest of the books introducing greater richness were books of Hours, and that this type of book was unique to a court context: instead of a set order of service, the liturgical composition was individually tailored to the requirements and in- terests of a particular noble personage, and the decorations were correspondingly personalised to include portraits, arms, mottoes, patron saints and other special references. This treatment stem- med from a new function in that the book of Hours was as much a vehicle for courtly and fashionable display as a text to be read for pri- vate devotions36. Behind this new type of book lay a great change in conditions of life at the Visconti court37. In 1360 the foundations for a new castle at Pavia were begun and in 1365 Galeazzo II and his court took up residence there. In 1359 the realm had already been divided between Galeazzo and Ber- nabò: Bernabò kept Milan and Galeazzo ruled Pavia and already before the foundation of the castle the contrast became marked between old- fashioned elements in Milan and the new,, more graceful court life at Pavia. The castle was an early example of a new kind of building combin- ing both fortress and palace, the demands of luxurious living and formal display being as im- portant in its design as considerations of defence. Its courtyard was the scene of frequent feasts and tournaments, its park contained a collection of exotic animals, a pool and a hunting lodge38. At some stage a library was founded and the collection was housed in one of the four towers39. It is not clear exactly when either of these things occurred or why. Some books in the Visconti library were acquired by conquest, from other rulers. But once a library was consciously being formed, it might be expected that books would be prized more highly and that more at- tention would be paid to fine illumination. But already before the new castle was founded, two foreign princesses had married into the Visconti family and brought with them new cultural influences. The presence of these impor- tant high-born ladies at court meant that ties with abroad would be closer than in the case of routine diplomatic exchanges. In 1350 Galeazzo married Bianca of Sa- 34 See bibliography in F. Wormald and P. M.

She came from a court with strong cultural and political links with France and it is no accid- ent that our earliest de luxe book was made for her: for the book of Hours, of which hers is the earliest Italian example is in origin a French phenomenon, both as a liturgical type and as a fashionable court accessory41. Ten years later, in 1360, the marriage of Gian Galeazzo, son of the reigning Galeazzo II, to Isabella de Valois, daughter of Jean le Bon of France and sister to the future king and bi- bliophile Charles V, opened a direct channel for French influence42. The Visconti inventories show at least one French book directly connected with Isabella and there were certainly other French books which reached Pavia43. Relations between the courts were always frequent and were conti- nued by the marriage of Valentina, daughter of Gian Galeazzo, to Louis d'Orléans in 138944. Two years later, when Louis and a train of French nobles were received with a great feast at Pavia, precious gifts were exchanged, as no doubt they had been ever since the two courts became so personally involved. There was personal involvement too, among the artists and amateurs of art of Paris and Lom- bardy. This was especially so in connection with the building of Milan cathedral which attracted artists from all over Europe. A painter from Paris, the elusive Jacques Coene of Bruges was invited with colleagues to work in Milan45. These foreign connections explain the French influence already discussed. But other features of the decorations can also be explained by reference to the court background. Court life at this time was leisured and luxurious. At the Visconti court, as indeed throu- ghout Europe,, fashions in clothing depended on artificial exaggeration and elongation of natural proportions combined with conspicuous display of sparkling, bejewelled and richly patterned cloths46. Frequent elaborately staged ceremonial occasions encouraged a preoccupation with out- ward display and artifice47. This provided a gen- eral influence on the lavish decorations applied to the de luxe books. But there are more specific links behind some of the details. Among the rich foliage of the borders of lat. 757 there are various figures48. Birds perch on stems but birds have always been common 6 in manuscript borders. Small garlanded nude putti climb among the leaves, but they too have 5 been seen before in Italy. But in addition there are new figures: ladies in fashionable dresses with the characteristic high waist and striped head- band play with apes, dogs and wild men. There 5,6 are also a few monstrous creatures of the type popular in Northern Europe. Compared with English and French manuscripts of earlier pe- riods, these border figures are few, and the act- ions they perform are restrained,, with scarcely a hint of the multifarious Northern monstrous humour and satiric observation of common life. Both the ape and the dog seem to be portrayed as representations of tame animals, probably from the court zoological park, rather than shown 40 D. Muratore, Bianca di Savoia e le sue Nozze con Galeazzo II Visconti, Archivio Storico Lombardo , series 4 , VII , 1907 , p. 5-104. Bianca was the daughter of Ay mon the Pacific , count of Savoy 1327-43. The counts of Savoy maintained a close French connec- tion : Aymon*s two predecessors spent much time at their country house near Paris , and his successor , Bianca* s brother Amadeus VI, was to marry a French princess in 1355. H. Menabréa, Histoire de Savoie, Paris 1933 , p. 63-7. 41 Leroquais, Les Livres d'Heures, p. XII. There is little artistic evidence in Savoy of the French cul- tural predominance , but P. Litta (Le Famiglie Ce- lebri Italiane, fase. XL VI, parte IV, Milan 1840 , un- numbered plate) illustrates the tomb of Aymon and his wife , and it is very French in style. In addition , two fine books of Hours associated with Jean Pu- celle and his atelier have Savoy connections. Bian- ca* s aunt , Blanche of Burgundy , wife of count Ed- ward the Liberal of Savoy , was the original owner of a book of Hours which later entered the posses- sion of Charles V (La Librairie de Charles V, Cata- logue of Exhibition held in the Bibl. Nat., Paris 1958 , p. 100, no. 174). A Savoy princess who married into the French court, Jeanne (d. 1344) wife of John III, duke of Brittany, was the owner of an early book of Hours of Pucelle. (K. Morand, Jean Pucelle, Oxford 1952, p. 5, 47). 42 Magenta, I Visconti, p. 69. 43 Isabella gave a copy, now untraced, of « Les Voeux du Paon » to her husband (Pellegrin, La Bibliothè- que, p. 126). Bianca paid LX francs for an « Ufficio », bought in Paris in 1366 (Magenta, I Visconti, p. 113, n. 6). Later the Italian scholar and secretary to Gian Galeazzo, Pasquino de ' Capelli (d. 1389) purchased books in Paris (Pellegrin, La Bibliothèque, p. 51; Pellegrin, Supplément, p. 3, 9, 14-20). 44 Magenta, I Visconti, p. 187. The train of Louis included Philip of Burgundy and the poet Eustache Deschamps who recorded the delights of life at Pa- via in the verses quoted by E. Collas (Valentine de Milan, Duchesse ďOrléans, Paris 1911, p. 141). In addition to this connection, one of Bernabò's daugh- ters, Taddea Visconti, was the mother of Isabeau de Bavière, who married Charles VI of France in 1385.

Pacht, A Giottesque episode in English me- dieval art, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, VI, 1943, p. 54-5) seem to be a particularly Italian contribution to the genre.

These, and the images of fashionable court ladies are a reflection of court life, and these grotesques are altogether a courtly and aristocratic variant of the wilder and more earthy drolleries found els- ewhere. One of the court ladies in lat. 757 holds in either hand the emblems and the monogram of the book's patron. These motifs are conspic- 3 uously scattered throughout the book, more fre- quently towards the end, on borders, initials, backgrounds, costumes : the emblematic lady wears a dress decorated in this way, as does one of St. Ursula's companions50. The borders of the 4 related books of Hours are also invaded by her- aldic motifs51. No longer merely a single shield on the opening page, such lavish heraldic display reinforces the idea that these borders are being transformed into something peculiar to a court. For the same sort of open display of ownership and rank which formalised court life into an elaborate ceremonial performance is also found in the costumes and textiles of the period. Colour may have had symbolic as well as heraldic signi- ficance ; dresses were scattered with various motifs which were not all purely decorative since they included monograms, emblems and letters52. 4, 22, 23 artistic activities53. For Milan Cathedral he desi- gned architecture, sculpture, window tracery, and he painted architecture, sculpture, altarpieces, banners and miniatures. He visited Pavia to ad- vise on the building of the Certosa. Besides the illuminated manuscripts,, there survive architec- tural drawings, and his « sketchbook », a collec- tion of drawings, studies and patterns of animals and birds, heraldic designs, courtly figures, an anthropomorphic alphabet and decorative designs perhaps for textiles. It therefore seems that he was involved in the most important artistic cur- rents of his time, the construction of Milan ca- thedral and the adorning of the courts at Milan and Pavia. In the manuscripts of de' Grassi, fantastic architectural constructions stand in the margins, or grow improbably from foliage stems ; they are 10 distorted to form initials or curved to make 10,12 niches for figures. Initials sprout window tracery 13 and foliage of unmistakably architectural forni. These all carry a strong resemblance to the cha- racteristic forms of Milan Cathedral: its windows with flamboyant tracery, bending into flamelike patterns, its foliated crockets and finials, its picturesque skyline, a mass of tiny spires, turrets and little points54. In the case or Giovannino de Orassi it is possible to be more specific about his sources, because documents record the wide range of his There is a related similarity to contemļpo- rary goldsmith s work, for what little survives from the Visconti circle also follows architectural forms, derived from slightly earlier French work. That de' Grassi was aware of this resemblance can be seen from his decorations : some of the fanciful piling up of niches and turrets resembles Parisian reliquaries and table decorations55, and in the Beroldo an angel is carrying what is per- haps a reliquary of similar delicacy and exquisi- teness to the architectural initial. Its crockets and gables are also found on the stem of the chalice of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, the only surv- iving piece of goldsmith's work which can be securely linked to the Visconti court56. 49 Magenta, I Visconti, p. 117, 237-9. On Lombard animal portraiture see Pacht, Early Italian nature studies, p. 13-25. Animals were also painted on mu- rals at the castle of Pavia (Magenta, I Visconti, p. 87- 88). On the representation of the ape , see H. W. Jan- son, Apes and Ape Lore in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, London , 1952 , p. 149, 163-186. The wild man can hardly be painted directly from nature ; ne- vertheless the figure had become a popular disguise at court festivities. R. Bernheimer, Wild Men in the Middle Ages, Cambridge (Mass.), 1952, especially p. 67 for an account of a performance at the French court. 50 These emblems have been connected with Bernabò Visconti (see references in note 9, above) but the identification is not satisfactory. A similar figure bearing heraldic devices is painted as a frontispiece to Cicero, De Natura Deorum, Paris, Bibl. Nat., ms. lat. 6340 (Repr. in Pellegrin, Supplément, pi 98). 51 The hours of Bianca of Savoy contain arms of Visconti and Savoy. The Modena Hours has some traces of the original owner but the second campaign of decoration and later erasures have meant that it carries only a little heraldic decoration. 52 It is interesting to note that a textile almost exactly like the one in figure 4 which is scattered with crescent shapes is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (no. 831-1899). Many of the gowns and hangings in the inventory of objects taken to France in 1389 by Valentina Visconti for her mar- riage to Louis d'Orléans were described as scattered (semé) with various motifs, including Visconti em- blems. (F. M. Graves, Deux inventaires de la maison d'Orléans, Paris, 1926, p. 71-73). For reproductions of textiles, see below, note 68. French tapestries , after which foreign ones were modelled, sometimes were scattered with emblematic letters (J.J. Rorimer and M. B. Freeman, The Nine Heroes tapestries at the Cloisters, Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, VII, 1949, p. 252 and plates 250, 254) as well as with the more usual coats of arms (W. G.

The technique of enamelling gold with translucent coloured glazes was of French origin, but examples are known to have reached the Visconti court if they were not actually made there58. Around the base of the Parisian reliquary of the Saint-Esprit is seen a row of these thin, hard little flowers and similar ones are used on smaller objects such as neckla- ces and brooches59. The foreshortening of the flo- wers in the manuscript resembles the three-dim- ensional nature of this kind of jewellery. Like the jewellery, the manuscripts use coloured semi- transparent glazes over gold or silver,, and the multitude of glittering little lozenges and dots, each on a stem and each surrounded by a spar- kling finely-dotted radiance has a very similar effect to the rows of pearls on gold stems so often found on small brooches or necklaces. 10,13,24 There is a parallel with another form of metalwork. For in the borders to the Historia Plantarum are found several medallions surroun- ded by foliage, which contain busts of what appear to be classical figures, emperors or heroes. The 12 classical appearance of these is surprising in a Gothic manuscript and it is no less so when compared with the portrait busts of Gian Galeazzo appearing in his book of Hours. The portraits and medallions are in the same style - they share the set of the features - but there is all'antico and therefore has nothing in common with the medallions61. But there are several ins- tances of contemporary imitations of the genuine Roman coins excavated around this time, and these have an extremely antique appearance, far more so, it must be admitted, than the medallions in the manuscript. In 1390 at Padua, the Carrara struck antique-looking medals modelled on anti- que bronze sesterces and Venice too saw imitation coins made consciously all'antico62. There are a number of earlier instances including represen- tations of ancient coins in a Veronese manuscript of earlier in the century63. The classical busts in the Historia Planta- rum are part of the growing interest in the anti- que which is a common feature in the arts of the court centres of the International Gothic style64. However it was in these courts, as opposed to more scholarly centres, such as Padua, that ideas of the antique had the least sound archaeological or authentic stylistic basis. The busts appear in the manuscript without relevance to the text and they are surrounded by gay, courtly Gothic de- coration. Many pages of the Visconti Hours are decorated with flat, conventionalised and sym- metrical shapes such as the heart shaped motifs in the lower corners of folio 2v or the palmette shapes on the same page, seen again on folio 115 growing from the strange gold trees. These shapes are not related to the acanthus : they are found elsewhere not in illuminated manuscripts, nothing to suggest that the medallions are meant as portraits of individuals, and every effort has been made to give them an antique appearance with white toga-like robes, a wreath around the head and a profile with a Roman nose. The classical reference may have some connection with the original patron Wenceslas, King of the Romans, but the style of the deco- rations is entirely Milanese. In Northern Italy at this time, there was a growing interest in anti- que coinage and indeed this interest had reached Imperial circles60. The coin issued by Gian Galeaz- zo which bears his ¡portrait in profile is not made 57 Pacht, Early Italian nature studies, p. 30-7. 58 T. Muller and E.

(Weiss, The study of ancient numismatics, fig. 1) Petrarch was an enthusiastic collector of antique coins and it has been suggested by Weiss and others that it was the indirect influence of Petrarch which led to the strik- ing of the Carrara medals, even though he had died in 1374. Petrarch had been at Pavia university and was present at the Visconti court 1353-61 and again in 1368 for Violanta's marriage (Magenta, I Visconti, p. 108-17, 134.) but any direct connection with the bust in the manuscript is unlikely. 64 Wenceslas ' father, the Emperor Charles IV was fond of Roman Imperial sentiments and imagery (R.

Jean de Berry had portraits of Roman Emperors at Bicêtre (A. de Champeaux and P. Gauchery, Travaux d'art executés pour Jean de Berry, Paris, 1894, p. 32) and also had a taste for medals and cameos often pre- sumed to be antique even when they were not. (P.

On the other hand, he seems to have been fam- iliar with contemporary textiles since there is a large area of common ground in the varied stock of motifs drawn on by de' Grassi and those found in the silks and damasks : animal designs, espe- cially animals in an enclosure, radiances (both these were used as emblems by the Visconti), engrailed lines crowned with beads or lozenges, scattered stars and leaves or other small shapes, scrolls, fantastic architecture, pseudo-kufic ins- criptions and scalloped clouds emitting rays68. 22, 23 The pseudo-kufic inscriptions in the borders and frames are interesting because they are very common in contemporary and earlier textiles, and ubiquitous on the borders of garments de- picted in Italian trecento monumental paintings. But here they form part of what amounts to an obsession with letters. The initials to the text are varied with a playful light-heartedness of treatment as described above69, but letters are also used in the borders. Sometimes these are the letters of heraldic display70 : in lat. 757 it was the monogram of the owner but here it is a whole 6 Visconti motto « à bon droit » which is so promi- nent. Here it is enlarged and decoratively dis- torted so as to be hardly legible round the page: it is repeated inside the stroke of the large initial. But the link between letters and textiles is clear, where the text is surrounded by a pseu- do-kufic inscription as genuinely illegible and meaningless as that within the scalloped bands of the textile on fig. 22. Furthermore, the curiously shaped frame bands which are sometimes blank and sometimes filled with pseudo-kufic script, are on other pages 18 filled with genuine gothic writing. There is also frequent use of an ornament deriving from a mixture of gothic and kufic pen strokes, seen imitating radiances on and in scroll-shaped cur- ves on fig. 11. On some pages linear decoration deriving from penwork line endings attaches itself to the edge of the frame or even spreads over the whole page. Heraldic motifs and coats of arms are by their nature very common in court art. At this time they are found throughout Europe on me- talwork, jewellery, panels, tapestry and textiles as well as in manuscripts71. The pages of the Hours of Gian Galeazzo are liberally scattered with his arms and emblems - radiances, doves, leopards in enclosures, mottoes, the serpent devouring a child: the Ducal ownership is an even more important element of the border decoration than it was in the earlier books of Hours. The animals and birds portrayed in de' Grassi's borders are remarkable, and those in the Visconti Hours and the Hours of Isabella of Ca- stile are of especially high quality, for their soft- ness and naturalistic colour. A large variety of species is seen: peacocks, parrots, kingfishers, thrushes, rabbits, deer, dogs, insects as well as fantastic creatures. There is an even wider varie- 7, 8 ty, including exotic beasts, birds and reptiles, in the Historia Plantarum, but these are illustrations 10 65 L.

It is recorded that a silk textile industry was esta- blished in Milan in 1341 (Storia di Milano, V, p. 880) but it seems to have been overshadowed by other centres. Venetian silk-weavers were working at Pa- via in 1381 for the Duchess (Magenta, I Visconti, p. 215. 66 G. de' Grassi, Taccuino (facsimile), p. 30. 67 F. PoDREiDER, Storia dei tessuti d'arte in Italia, Bergamo, 1928, p. 56; J. White, Art and Architecture in Italy, Harmondsworth, 1966, p. 248. 68 Textiles are difficult to date exactly but it seems that these motifs were used in the earliest Italian textiles, and therefore the contemporary textiles are the source for the manuscript borders and not vice versa. For reproductions of textiles with these mo- tifs see A. C. Weibel, Two thousand years of textiles, Detroit, 1952, plates 197-9, 205. It is worth singling out the motif of scalloped clouds emitting rays : this is frequent in the Visconti Hours (illustrated by Arslan, Riflessioni, pl. 57) and also in textiles (Wei- bel, Two thousand years, pl. 219) though the motif is perhaps too common elsewhere for this source to be conclusive. The stars and flowers scattered across many of the pages of the Visconti Hours are paral- leled by stars woven into textiles (Weibel, Two thousand years, pl. 205) and by pearls or other jewels sewn on to dresses. (Storia di Milano, V, p. 887; Graves, Deux Inventaires, p. 72-3). See also above, note 52. 69 Page 6. The humorous anthropomorphic letters are perhaps due to the influence of Germans wor- king in Milan on the cathedral. S. Samek-Ludovici, Alfabeto di Giovannino de' Grassi, Modena, 1958, p. 4. 70 Letters and mottoes were common not only on textiles but also on jewellery and plate.

Donor portraits were relatively frequent in books of Hours, though not always in borders, as for example , lat. 757, f. 102 v. There is an interesting record of a Visconti portrait of some kind on a piece of metalwork: a 15th century inventory of the treasury of Lausanne cathedral lists several objects from Milan with arms and ' images ' of a * Bamabo * and one of his daughters. This has been connected with a voyage of Bernabo Visconti (D. Muratore, « Un viaggio di Bernabo Visconti nella Savoia e nella Svizzera », Archivio storico Lom- bardo, series 4, X, 1908, p. 446). The frequent deer seen in the Visconti Hours reflect the passion of Gian Galeazzo for hunting, and the abundance of these animals in the park at Pavia.

Compared to the borders of ]at. 757, for example, there are now more species represented and they are in more varied positions. But it cannot merely have been the presence of the menagerie at the court which was responsible for this now more persistent and perceptive inte- rest, for the zoological park was at Pavia from the beginning. It must have been a more funda- mental change in the habits of natural observa- tion, though the stage of working directly from nature for every figure and animal had not yet been reached72. De' Grassi still worked from pat- terns and placed his animals in unnatural orna- mental surroundings. Though hindsight places them in the development towards a more scien- tific observation direct from nature, de' Grassi treated them rather like the ladies of the court must have treated their tame animals, as even more exquisite and decorative objects. The close link between these decorations and the artistic life of the court which produced them looks forward first to the work of Michelino da Besozzo, who painted mock cameos with Vi- sconti portraits in one of his manuscripts73,, and further to the Master of Mary of Burgundy, whose borders include representations of jewellery, ma- jolica ware and other objects of daily court use74. But de' Grassi did not use his courtly sources so literally : the pages show a playful and inven- tive freedom which elaborated on and added to motifs suggested by the courtly arts. There is no imitation but parallel rich and glittering effects are acheived by devices of pattern and composi- tion and paint peculiar to the flat page of a manuscript. The resulting appearance seems hardly appropriate to the devotional nature of the two books of Hours to which it was most spectacu- larly applied. The values most highly prized were a hard jewel-like sparkle, a busy surface alive with all-over pattern, a combination of extreme natu- ralism with extreme stylisation, and an ostenta- tious variety, crowding together different motifs : altogether a « summa » of the arts of the Inter- national Gothic courts.
