<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time 9 Kabbalah and Rationalism  in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto  and some Kabbalists of his time Ranging from poetry to mysticism and from logic to morality, Mosheh  Ḥayyim Luzzatto’s works are so wide-ranging that finding their unifying  elements can be difficult. This diversity challenges attempts at classify- ing him historically: is Luzzatto a modern author heralding a new age in  Hebrew literature?1 Or does he represent the final manifestation of a kab- balistic sensibility on the wane in Western Europe? The history of the recep- tion of his works is equally problematic: Eastern European communities of  different orientations2 hailed him almost immediately as a master worthy  of veneration, and this fervor continues to this day in religious Israeli cir- cles, inspiring a rich variety of studies and publications.3 The Paduan au- thor’s works were recently rediscovered in Israel, where many understand  them to articulate a New Age sensibility: an authentic religious experience  expressed in modern terms. Poet and mystic, modern man and kabbalist,  Luzzatto lends himself well to this kind of research. Indeed, the persecution  he suffered at the hands of the rabbinic establishment gives him the aura of  a victim of intolerance.4  Yet, in the West, he has been forgotten for almost a century. His memory  was not helped when a few nineteenth-century Italian scholars, adhering  closely to the critical method, reread him unsympathetically, complaining  about his fascination with Kabbalah, which they considered an obscurantist  discipline. Their lack of enthusiasm for kabbalistic studies was neverthe- less tempered with admiration for his great theological and poetic talent. His  well-known descendant, Samuel David Luzzatto (Shadal), clearly took this  position: R. Moses Chajim Luzzatto [...] a great genius, but unfortunately born  in times too infelicitous and dark [...] devised a system which was all  his own and founded upon the most abstruse questions of Theology— questions which are beyond human investigation. He had a talent for  185 </page> <page sequence="2"> Chapter 9 interpreting all the mysterious doctrines of the modern kabbalistic school  according to this system, and in so doing made his own hypotheses appear  like the simple development and explanation of Kabbalah.5  According to Shadal, Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto develops personal theo- logical concepts but presents them in kabbalistic terms, ill-serving his theo- logical genius. This was also the view of Samuel David Luzzatto’s contem- porary, Yosef Almanzi, whose early—and excellent—biographical account  of the Paduan kabbalist and poet at once praised and criticized him.6 Simon Ginzburg gave a more nuanced assessment of the kabbalist in The  Life and Works of Moses Hayyim Luzzatto (Philadelphia, 1931). Despite its  Romanticism, this work constitutes the most important biographical mono- graph on the kabbalist and poet. Ginzburg understands Kabbalah as a dy- namic force, especially in periods of isolation, as was the case during the  period of the ghetto, when legalism tended to fossilize Jewish life. Ginzburg  felt that Luzzatto’s poetic talent rivaled the literary gifts of Yehudah ha-Levy,  and restored beauty to the stagnant Hebrew language. Luzzatto’s kabbalistic  works were, for Ginzburg, a product of their age, and he read them as a form  of resistance against legalism animated by a messianic spirit and argued that  they testified thus to the vitality of Jewish life.7 Ginzburg nevertheless be- moaned the fact that: a splendid combination of poetic emotion and mythological material,  which Luzzatto, like Milton, could have embodied into a national epic,  was turned into fruitless kabbalistic speculation.8 To this he added: Had Moses Hayyim Luzzatto lived at an earlier date—he would no doubt  have become a great religious leader, had he lived later—he would have  become a great poet of the modern school. But living in a transition pe- riod as he did, tragedy was knocking at his door the first day he was ush- ered into this world.9  More recent critical appraisals of Luzzatto’s works have been equally  mixed. Although there have been a few analyses of his poetic works,10 as well  as a biography based on a new examination of his correspondence,11 most  of these studies have concentrated on the messianic aspects of Luzzatto’s  186 </page> <page sequence="3"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time thought, both from a theoretical point of view (including an exploration of  the Sabbatean question) and from an experiential perspective (focusing on  the revelations which a celestial voice or maggid12 made to Luzzatto). Other  studies have concentrated on the question of the feminine dimension of the  sefyroth.13 Finally, an important monograph has examined, among other  things, the links between the Paduan author’s rhetoric and his kabbalistic  thought.14 Some of the points discussed in this last work deserve further ex- amination, in particular its exploration of the relationship of Luzzatto’s works  with both the Lurianic kabbalistic tradition and the philosophical-scientific  thought of the age in which they were written.15 Among other things, such an  investigation needs to meet the demands of Jewish intellectual historiogra- phy by contextualizing the Jewish experience. This means starting from the  premise that, in a single period and place, Jews and non-Jews must have had  analogous behaviors and perceptions of reality; different religious cultures  merely expressed similar contents differently, because the society that lived  within the walls of the Ghetto was not completely cut off from the outside  world. Indeed, Luzzatto’s own works are almost explicitly in conversation  with ideas coming from outside the ghetto.  Luzzatto wrote solely in Hebrew. His kabbalistic, logical/rhetorical,16 ethi- cal, and poetic works all fit within the Jewish tradition. A theoretician, rather  than an encyclopedic writer, Luzzatto did not often cite other works or au- thors; among his rare quotations, there are no references to any non-Jewish  texts. The sources of his brief logical/rhetorical treatises are evident, and he  never sought to dissimulate them, even if he did not mention any names and  titles. Yet, there is an even deeper consonance between his thought and the  philosophical-scientific ideas of his time. The texts that provide evidence for  this are considered to have been exclusively intended for Jews, because the  doctrine they articulate was developed within the confines of the religious  intellectual “sanctuary” of Kabbalah. This is not to say that Luzzatto alludes,  however implicitly, to this or that non-Jewish author. Instead, it is the general  tonality of some of his important kabbalistic works which makes him an au- thor of his time, even if only up to a point (we will address these reservations  later): a writer who lived at a time when one could not ignore the new demands  that rationality and scientific developments placed even on religious thought. In other words, it seems appropriate to situate Luzzatto’s works within  the framework of early eighteenth-century European religious thought, when  Cartesianism deeply influenced the way problems were approached and  187 </page> <page sequence="4"> Chapter 9 methods developed. Clearly sensitive to the concerns of his time, the Paduan  kabbalist responded to them in his own way, by attempting to offer a new  reading of a doctrinal corpus which was a priori indifferent to such modern  demands, and which constituted the shared heritage of all Jewish communi- ties, in every region of the Jewish Diaspora. There is a rationalistic slant in the  reading Luzzatto proposed, so much so that one might risk describing him as  a rational theologian. In this sense, his descendant, Samuel David, who was  struck by the power of his theological reflections, appraised him correctly. Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto may well have sought to accentuate the ration- alistic character of his thought following the well-known events that obliged  him to alter the nature of his writings from 1730 onward. From then on, he  was no longer permitted to base his works on the revelations of celestial  voices, and was ordered to stop publishing on kabbalistic material.17 Yet, the  peremptory character of his rationalistic statements, as well as their impor- tance in his eyes and the urgency of his tone, suggest a genuine exigency  rather than a literary strategy.18  Of course, the rationalistic aspects of Luzzatto’s thought do not preclude  the fact that the young Paduan was also a mystic, the recipient of celestial rev- elations and the organizer of a group which aspired to perform tiqqunym (the  restoration of the divine world). He believed in gilgulym (the reincarnation of  souls), and believed he was the reincarnation of great personalities of the past.  He was at one and the same time a mystic and a rationalist, and saw no contra- diction in this. He adhered to a mystical form of religiosity which found col- lective expression during the years of belief in Shabbetay Tzevy, and survived  discreetly in Italy at least until the beginning of the nineteenth century, if  not beyond that.19 He nevertheless also embodied the intellectual elite’s need  to confront the most dynamic aspects of European culture. In other words,  Luzzatto defended Kabbalah from the charges its rationalist critics leveled  at it, even as he at least partly accepted the criteria on which they based their  attacks. In order to situate this aspect of his work, one must retrace the history  of the criticisms Kabbalah received in Italy before the era of Luzzatto. Covert Critiques of Kabbalah In 1558, the year of the polemics surrounding the first printed edition  of the Zohar and other important kabbalistic texts, hostility to Kabbalah on  doctrinal grounds was confined to a brief, anonymous text. We deduce the  188 </page> <page sequence="5"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time existence of this critical pamphlet from the responses which it provoked  from its adversaries. Drawing on observations found in Eliyah Delmedigo’s  book, Beḥynath ha-dath (An Examination of Religion, composed in 1490  and published in 1629), the anonymous author of the anti-kabbalist pamphlet  questions the antiquity of the Zohar and voices reservations about the doc- trine of the sefyroth, which he considers potentially heretical. Additionally,  he reasons that the search for concealed and secret meanings within the di- vine commandments may potentially have an adverse impact on healthy re- ligious behavior, which should be based on the study of Talmud and on basic  obedience to the divine laws.20  In the following years, and particularly throughout the seventeenth cen- tury, Kabbalah was the cornerstone of the dominant culture of Italian Jews.  It determined the theoretical orientation of the elite, spread through the dis- semination of its ritual behaviors, and played an important role in shaping  mentalities. Any opposition to Kabbalah manifested itself in resistance to a  tendency that pervaded all aspects of Jewish life and affected the population  at all levels. Significant yet sporadic, this resistance was censored by the rab- binic authorities and in some cases was not made public: it is in large part  thanks to its censors and virulent attackers that we know about it today. It is possible to reconstruct the main criticisms leveled at Kabbalah,  particularly Lurianic Kabbalah, which associated the doctrine of Yitzḥaq  Luria—as transmitted by his disciple Ḥayyim Vital Calabrese—to the doc- trines of the Zohar and earlier kabbalists such as Nahmanides. It is also pos- sible to trace the intellectual model which the critics of Kabbalah proposed  as an alternative. The major accusation directed against the kabbalists concerned the fact  that they considered the Kabbalah to be “the true wisdom”—the ḥokhmath  ha-emeth—but had neither verified the historical authenticity of its teachings  nor produced a theoretical justification of their truthfulness. The Venecian  rabbi Yehudah Ariyeh Modena (1571—1648) stringently raises both of  these points in Ary nohem (A Lion Roars), which, significantly, remained  unedited until 1840.21 For Modena, Kabbalah is neither a true tradition nor a  true science. It is not a tradition because the great rabbis of the past—from  the Talmudic era onward—never mention it. Additionally, it seems evident  to him that the major kabbalistic texts—particularly those collected in the  Zohar, which have an aura of holiness and are attributed to the master of  the Mishnah, Shim‘on bar Yoḥai—are in reality apocryphal writings which  189 </page> <page sequence="6"> Chapter 9 were edited many centuries later. According to Modena, the kabbalists imi- tated ancient philosophers and manufactured their texts out of apocrypha in  the style of Jewish writings. It was not easy to make such assertions, and  Modena fully expected those who believed in the texts to rebut him stiffly:  “And I know that I must fortify myself with shield and armor, in order to  protect myself against their violent verbal arrows.”22  For Modena, Kabbalah is not an authentic tradition, but neither is it a sci- ence. Shifting to a theoretical argument, he presents a detailed epistemological  analysis grounded in a definition of science (ḥokhmah). The Venetian rabbi  argues that in order to be considered a science, a discipline must insist on  reaching the truth (understood as the coincidence of a mental representation  with reality) in its particular field through rational argumentation. In this sense,  physics and mathematics are clearly sciences, as they follow a line of reason- ing in order to reach rapid and authoritative conclusions. Similarly, astronomy  is a science, as are, in a certain sense, rational theology (as long as it adheres  to the proper rules of demonstration) and logic (the instrument for grasping the  truth).23 Developing this line of argument, Modena cites Nahmanides, Meyr  ibn Gabbay and Mosheh Cordovero in order to show that the kabbalists not  only refused to investigate questions pertaining to the science of truth through  rational argumentation, or sevara, but actually denounce such investigations  as irreverent. The only proofs they produce are based on authority: they quote  other quotations, and write books referencing other books. As the kabbalists  do not think it apposite to extricate themselves from this circle of self-jus- tification, their discipline is not a science. It is precisely sevara which leads  Yehudah Ariyeh Modena to castigate the esoteric doctrine and its supporters.24  The criteria which Modena invokes in his critique of Kabbalah are analo- gous to those he made in a previous work in order to criticize Catholic the- ology;25 there, his discussion of Catholicism focused both on the historical  reality of Jesus’ ideas and on the rationality of Catholic doctrine. Modena’s  evaluation of Catholicism was negative on both counts: one the one hand,  the “historical Jesus” differed significantly from the Catholic Jesus, and on  the other, Catholic theology was based on hypotheses that were unaccepta- ble to reason. However, his critique of Kabbalah is even harsher. The saying  “tiqqun ha-regel la-na‘al” (“to correct the foot to suit the shoe”) applies to  both doctrines: both forge a series of notions with no historical or theoreti- cal precedent, and are constrained to distort the biblical text as they adapt  it to them, giving it non-literal interpretations. However, whereas Catholic  190 </page> <page sequence="7"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time theology leaves a certain amount of room for rational discussion, the only  possible strategy for the kabbalists is unquestioning assent.  Modena’s positive alternative to Kabbalah is implicit in his critique: a  religion open to moderate rationalism, and in particular to the rational justi- fication of fundamental beliefs such as the unity of God, the creation of the  world, and providence. Considered as a whole, the Venetian rabbi’s complete  works define a “cultural project” which was soon destined for failure, at least  as far as mainstream Jewish thought was concerned. Modena wanted Jews to  know and appreciate the sciences, be versed in the Latin classics, and engage  with Hebrew literature, but also to engage with the most modern productions  of the Italian language and literature (he explicitly uses the term “modern”).26  He also thought they should be familiar with Christianity, without accepting  or denigrating its dogmas. He probably wished for a Jewish religion more  solidly based on the Bible than was the Judaism of his day, and trimmed of  some of the exclusive practices and beliefs that impeded its diffusion.27  Seventeenth-century kabbalists departed significantly from this model.  They turned to the East—in particular to Safed—for the light of truth.28 They  generally did not bother to justify Luria’s complex doctrines on divinity,  and when they did they invoked the notion of the ruaḥ ha-qodesh, the Holy  Spirit (a degree of prophecy) that descended upon the Master of Galilee.  Rhetorically, their writings took the form of a series of assertions, often  opening with a magisterial injunction such as “Know,” or “You must know  that...”; from a systemic point of view, their teachings did not conform to the  traditional categories of rational theology—which in Jewish thought devel- oped from the tenth-century Sa‘adiyah Gaon to the fifteenth-century Yosef  Albo—but instead followed a peculiar course inspired by Yitzḥaq Luria’s  emanationism. When, as sometimes happened, exegetical logic did prevail,  their ideas took the form of peculiar biblical commentaries. Moreover, theirs  was a theoretically and culturally exclusive doctrine: they presented the Jews  as repositories of the science of truth and protagonists for the restoration of  the divine world, and were suspicious of, or even hostile toward, anything  that was not Jewish or not expressed in Hebrew.29 A few years after Modena, Ya‘aqov Francés (1615-1667) of Mantua, who  was probably the best Hebrew poet of his generation, launched another cri- tique of Kabbalah. In a controversial poem,30 Francés denounces Kabbalah,  not on the grounds of its doctrine—which he held in high esteem—but be- cause its dissemination is detrimental to what should constitute the canonical  191 </page> <page sequence="8"> Chapter 9 knowledge of a learned Jew. Francés complains that the kabbalists of his age  neglect the study of traditional Jewish texts—such as the Talmud—let alone  philosophy and science, and thus aim to scale the peaks of divine wisdom  without proper preparation. He considers silence to be the only authentic  discourse on the divine, but instead: Today, whoever does not speak of the Creator Is not considered a creature.31 [...] The Kabbalah is talked about in the marketplaces: It is tossed about in everyone’s heads.32 In these lines, he evokes the complex and detailed account Kabbalah makes  of the divine world, contradicting the notion of absolute transcendence pro- posed by classical Jewish philosophy, in particular that of Maimonides.33 Commenting on the kabbalists’ ignorance of science and pretensions to  perfect knowledge of the celestial worlds, Francés asks: “How can a man  who is ignorant of the laws of nature (derekh ha teva‘) and the creatures of  the earth and sky (“he does not know the course of the raptor / that every eagle  discerns”34), how can he scan the face of the firmament with his speculations?” Francés also denounces the kabbalists’ methodology, which he considers  fraudulent: characteristically introduced by the term “certainly” (wadday),  the truths which they claim to utter are none other than the fruit of their imag- inations (badday); the truth cannot grow in this arid soil.35 While this denun- ciation echoes Modena’s main criticism of the kabbalists, Francés also con- demns them on moral grounds: he who practices Kabbalah is guilty, because he searches for secrets, only because they don’t have to be proven.36 Even if Francés targeted the inexpert kabbalists of his day rather than the  doctrine of Kabbalah per se, the ideal program of studies which he proposes  at the end of his poem nevertheless does not seem to leave much scope for  Kabbalah.37 The man the poet envisions will only come to know divine se- crets after a slow and lengthy process (as instructed by philosophers, from  Sa‘adiyah to Maimonides). Avoiding great leaps forward “like the marten,”  he will “call the divine Torah his sister / and philosophy his friend.”38 192 </page> <page sequence="9"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time Francés’ poem, which was published in 1660 or 1661, was censored by  the leaders of the Mantuan community, who forbade its reading and probably  ordered its destruction. Francés wrote many other poems with violent under- tones against those he considered to be his persecutors, but they remained in  manuscript form until the nineteenth century. It is possibly as a result of these  events that Ya‘aqov had to leave Mantua for Florence.39 In 1704, Francés’ text was reprinted by the rabbi of Ancona, Shimshon  Morpurgo, in the appendix of a book he published anonymously, ‘Etz ha- da‘ath (The Tree of Wisdom). This book was a commentary of Beḥynath olam  (Examination of the World) by Yeda’yiah Bedersi, who had defended philo- sophical enquiry in a famous fourteenth-century polemic.40 Needless to say,  reprinting Francés’ poem in such a context was not a neutral act. Morpurgo  does not deny endorsing a moderate rationalism, in which scientific and philo- sophical research accompany, clarify, and support religion rather than being  at odds with it. For Morpurgo, philosophy should not be condemned because  a few philosophers deviated from the straight path of religion; in fact, the  kabbalists too could lose their way, as Francés’ poetic testimony pointed out.  Morpurgo’s decision to publish his book anonymously and print a controver- sial poem condemned by the rabbis point to his desire to pursue a concealed  polemic against the hegemony of kabbalistic culture, while also suggesting  that he may have feared the reactions this new book could provoke.41 Morpurgo’s book was criticized by the kabbalist rabbi of Mantua, Avi‘ad  Sar Shalom Basilea (1680-1743) in a text entitled Emunath ḥakhamym  (Belief of the Wise).42 Basilea did not launch a direct attack against the au- thor of ‘Etz ha-da‘ath; despite having identified him, he did not call him by  name and maintained a respectful stance towards him, limiting himself to a  few observations on the contents of the book. However, the Mantuan kab- balist adopted a much more virulent stance against Francés’s poetry which  Morpurgo had reprinted. In a lengthy passage, Basilea declares Francés to be impure (mezoham)  and devoid of any rabbinic qualifications.43 Rejecting the notion that there is  a link between adhering to Kabbalah and being ignorant of the Jewish sci- ences, he seeks to disprove this idea by listing the many contemporary Italian  rabbis who were distinguished scholars in both Kabbalah and Talmud. As for  the exact sciences, his own interests in mathematics, geometry, optics, and  astronomy implicitly demonstrated that one could be both a kabbalist and a  scientist. Basilea also responds to Francés’ and Modena’s criticisms of the  193 </page> <page sequence="10"> Chapter 9 kabbalists’ diregard for the logic of rational proof by appealing to the truth- fulness of authentic tradition. In his view, the tradition of Kabbalah is even  more faithful to the revealed sources than Talmud is; moreover, he proposes  that this does not prevent it from being a true science, either in terms of its  content, which is true, or its method: just as is the case with the human sci- ences one cannot study Kabbalah without respecting its particular order and  progression (ba-seder ha-rauy we-ha-nakhon).44 In essence, then, Kabbalah  is a tradition which is true in content and scientific in method.45 Basilea seems to have oscillated between a completely anti-philosophical  stance and the acceptance of rational discussion:  I will enter into discussion [with the opponents of Kabbalah] in order to  know the truth, according to the instructions of the intellect and of our great  teachers [...] on the condition that the opponents of Kabbalah listen to me  in order to understand, not in order to object, and that they accept the con- clusions of this discussion according to the rules of philosophical debate.46 Invoking his teacher, the great kabbalist Mosheh Zacuto, Basilea asserts that  philosophy is for goyyim, as its deductions can prove erroneous. Jews have  no need for it, he argues, because they arrive at knowledge through tradition:  “One learns the ḥokhmah [the true, received science] from a teacher, while  one learns the bynah [deductive science] by oneself.”47 The polemical tone adopted by Basilea in much of his book is itself clear  evidence of infighting in the Jewish world. A close examination of the refer- ences Basilea makes to the rationalists of his time brings out these tensions:  he speaks of contemporary Jews who not only deny the secrets of the Torah  but lack respect for the Talmudic rabbis, presuming to “separate the wheat  from the chaff” in their teachings.48 Moreover, he writes, Christian authors  are comparatively less radical in their rationalist critique of the Bible than  these Jews,49 as they appeal less to Jewish religious texts than to the profane  writings of non-Jews,50 and they pay more credit to these works than non- Jewish readers.51 According to him, the mere fact that a text has non-Jewish  origins increases its prestige in their eyes. He notes that they teach the com- mentaries of the rationalist Avraham Ibn Ezra in schools, convincing their  students of the falsity of certain traditional beliefs although they are mani- festly true, for example the belief in the existence of demons.52 Basilea even  admits having to expend more effort correcting the erroneous tendencies of  194 </page> <page sequence="11"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time his coreligionists than entering into discussions with representatives of the  Christian religion.53 Indeed, quoting Pietro Galatino, he asserts that Christians  reproach the Jews for not respecting their own laws.54 Evidently, the medi- eval genre of the disputatio between different religions was in decline, and  religious apologies were progressively taking over: aimed at skeptical un- believers and rationalists of all confessions, these rallied the proponents of  different faiths to a common front. In order to address the criticisms of his contemporaries, the Mantuan  rabbi devised a strategy involving the introduction of elements pertaining  to the human sciences into his account of Kabbalah: we will examine these  elements in greater detail further along. This is the context in which Luzzatto  should be situated: between loyalty to Kabbalah and adherence to a certain  scientific model, which could evidently no longer be refuted solely on the  basis of authority. Often considered Italy’s most esoterically inclined Italian community,  Livorno was the site of additional indirect resistance to Kabbalah. Yosef  Ergas, its most prestigious representative between the late seventeenth- and  early eighteenth-centuries, recounted in the first teshuvah (legal response) of  his important collection, Divrey Yosef, that in 1710: A certain person became agitated, and began to publicly defame the sci- ence of truth [i.e. Kabbalah], and those that study it, railing in particular  against the holy Yitzḥaq Luria. Some people of no value, who thought of  themselves as wise, but who were actually worthless, rallied around this  person, and began to criticize the wise and devoted men who were better  than they and their fathers.55  Although the question at stake was relatively trivial (whether to omit two  words from the prayers said during the Days of Penitence), Ergas’ response  gives us an insight into tensions that were not manifested more directly. It  seems likely that his reference to people “who thought of themselves as  wise” alludes to the advocates of a certain type of critical-rational culture:  the same individuals that Basilea criticized. Another case of resistance to Kabbalah, which was also censored by the  authorities of the Jewish community, was recorded by a Christian source. In  his famous Bibliotheca Rabbinica (1675), Giulio Bartolocci speaks of “a vo- luminous book against Kabbalah and the sefyroth,” written by the Venetian  195 </page> <page sequence="12"> Chapter 9 rabbi Mordeḥay Corcos. Objecting to this work, however, the rabbis from  Corcos’ city appealed to the public authorities in order to halt its publication  and were apparently successful.56  Against Obscurantism: The Strategy of Dialogue The works of Yosef Ergas and Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto—the leading  early eighteenth-century theoreticians of Kabbalah—should be read in light  of these criticisms. Each of them chose to compose a dialogue between a  kabbalist and a rationalist57 in which the latter led the kabbalist to justify  Kabbalah from a historical, and above all theoretical, perspective. Although  these dialogues were not voluminous, their authors considered them fairly  important. In both dialogues, the kabbalists are seen through the eyes of the  rationalists and seem to be devout ignoramuses, whose ideas are obscure and  confused, and who do not follow the ways of reason, instead relying solely  on the principle of authority.  Shomer emunym (Guardian of Faith) is a dialogue by Yosef Ergas, pub- lished posthumously in Amsterdam in 1735 or 1736. According to the author,  it constitutes a simply written introduction to Yitzḥaq Luria’s Kabbalah, or,  more precisely, an attempt to “correctly elucidate the writings of Ha’Ary  [the acrostic of Ashkenazy Rabby Yitzḥaq, i.e. Luria].”58 Ergas begins with  a historical justification of Kabbalah, indirectly answering Leone Modena’s  criticisms, then proceeds to introduce the principal tenets of the doctrine,  giving them a philosophical explanation and, in some cases, justification:  this is evidently what Ergas meant by “elucidating” Lurianic Kabbalah. In  doing so, he seeks to circumvent two problems of Jewish religious studies:  a decreasing interest in the “science of the truth,” and—for those who still  believe in and practice it—an engagement with the Lurianic doctrine that is  excessively cursory and precludes the study of previous kabbalistic texts.59  According to Shealtiel—who is the rationalist interrogator in Ergas’s dia- logue and represents those who approach Judaism literally, ignoring its eso- teric dimension—any discussion with the kabbalists is superfluous, because:  All of their discourses are founded on their faith in their teachers [...], and  one cannot refute them with intellect (sekhel), or reason (sevara), or true  opinion, because they would not listen: the arguments would not enter  into their ears. I therefore do not see the usefulness of talking with them.  196 </page> <page sequence="13"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time The kabbalist Yehoyada‘ (whose name translates to “God knows”) con- cedes that Kabbalah is founded on traditional teachings, but reminds his in- terlocutor that it leaves space for discussion: We do not refrain from researching, investigating, and questioning the  discourses of the kabbalists and the foundations on which their premises  rest. On the contrary, it is our habit to discuss (lefalpel) their meanings,  just as we discuss the halakhah, i.e. legal matters.60 The “rationalist” agrees to converse, even if there is scant space for free  discussion: the legal pilpul operates within precise limits, which are set be- fore each debate.  Granted the last word, the kabbalist ends by warning against an a priori  refusal of kabbalistic ideas in the absence of counter-arguments, if research  proves that they are close to the literal sense of the rabbinic statements in  Talmud. In other words, although not entirely justified (let alone founded)  on rational grounds, the doctrine the kabbalist proposes at least does not run  contrary to reason. Furthermore, he implicitly reverses Modena’s argument  against Kabbalah’s distorted, non-literal interpretation of texts (“the adapta- tion of the foot to the shoe”) by defending kabbalistic exegesis for being  closest to the literal sense—at least regarding the teachings of the Talmudic  masters, if not the Bible. Throughout the successive arguments he goes on to  develop, Ergas maintains that Talmudic discussions cannot really be under- stood without reference to Kabbalah.61  Shomer emunym bears the mark of rationalism, despite a few dogmatic  and authoritarian statements, such as when it asserts that anyone who know- ingly denies the theory of the sefyroth is a heretic, or that one must believe  the rabbis even if one does not fully understand them.62 Although the kab- balist’s interlocutor objects that Kabbalah contains several abstruse (zarym)  and irrational elements which are not acceptable (mityashevym)63 to a learned  person (ḥakham), the kabbalist explains that these difficulties derive from a  methodologically flawed approach to its study. He argues that, like any other  human science, Kabbalah has a particular order (seder rauy we-nakhon): one  must respect this order in order to understand the works of the kabbalists  and grasp their correct meaning (kawwanah).64 The notion—which Basilea  also formulates—that Kabbalah is a discipline with its own particular order  places it on a par with the sciences, at least from a methodological point of  197 </page> <page sequence="14"> Chapter 9 view. However, the idea that the doctrine has to be explained in order to be- come intelligible is perhaps even more important. From Menaḥem Azariyah  to Mosheh Zacuto, the major seventeenth-century kabbalists set forth the  doctrine of Kabbalah without resorting to this second, explicative level, in- stead following the descriptive, exegetical rhetoric of Yitzḥaq Luria. In con- trast, Ergas—and with him Luzzatto—felt compelled to clarify Kabbalah,  which led them to articulate a series of ideas drawn from the sphere of rea- son. Hoping, as they explained, that this would bring Jewish scholars back to  Kabbalah, they also recognized that founding a doctrine on tradition, no mat- ter how prestigious, was no longer enough in their day and age. Naturally,  we must ask if this decision was born of genuine conviction, or if it was  merely a defensive strategy. In other words, was their determination to resort  to rational explanation the result of an a posteriori concession to making  Kabbalah comprehensible for the uninitiated, or did these important eight- eenth-century thinkers believe that kabbalistic notions should be based on  intellectual-philosophical constructions (although these in fact constituted  two separate categories for Ergas and Luzzatto, as we will see)? Whatever the case may be, what is clear is that one had to be something of  a rationalist theologian in order to be a kabbalist in the eighteenth century. In  other words, the criticisms Modena and Francés leveled at the kabbalists did  not hold completely. As Ergas’ anti-kabbalist interlocutor, Shealtiel, declares  (touching on the fundamental question of the existence of the sefyroth): I must speak the truth: I never thought that the kabbalists analyzed this  subtle material in order to explain it or make it acceptably elegant or  rational (le-ha-‘amydam w-le-yashevam be-tuv ta‘am u-sevara). I effec- tively acknowledge that everything you say would be acceptable for any  thinking person (nekhoḥym la-mevyn), and gives sufficient grounds for  declaring rationally necessary your tradition of the existence of the sefy- roth and the superior worlds.65 In a dialogue between a philosopher and a kabbalist which later editors  entitled Ḥoqer w-mequbbal (A Philosopher and a Kabbalist),66 Luzzatto also  felt compelled to enter the realm of reason in order to discuss Kabbalah.67  In a dense introduction to his dialogue, Luzzatto denounces the deca- dent state of true knowledge, the prophetic knowledge which was revealed  and transmitted to Israel alone, and which a long exile has overshadowed.  198 </page> <page sequence="15"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time Whereas non-Jews, who arrived at their sciences rationally, were not sub- jected to this profound crisis, Jews now found themselves in possession of  limited knowledge, and were reduced to simple, literal statements about  the Scriptures. This lost prophetic knowledge of the intimate meaning of  the Torah, for Luzzatto, was intellectual: a position which brings him very  close to Maimonides. The soul, which Luzzatto identifies with the intellect  (sekhel), was created in order to grasp (le-haskil) the light of divinity. Indeed,  the content of Luzzatto’s introduction is rather similar to, and possibly in- spired by, Maimonides’ well-known introduction to the Mishneh Torah.68  Even so, for Luzzatto this understanding will come from kabbalistic knowl- edge, which is exclusively the prerogative of Israel.69 Although it is true that  the teachings of Luria and his disciples reintroduced prophecy after the long  “sleep of exile,” their doctrine has in fact become obscure and difficult, and  requires much additional study; in contrast, as we will see, clarity is an im- portant part of Luzzatto’s own works.70 Luzzatto goes on to say that it is hardly surprising if the scholars of his  time consider the “true science” to be constituted of empty formulas, or even  if they judge these formulas clumsy and unacceptable, and doubt if the Zohar  may be attributed to the great teacher Shim‘on bar Yoḥay. Whereas scholars  are in search of clear (meyusheveth) and in-depth knowledge, according to  Luzzatto, in its current state, Kabbalah presents itself to them as an obscure  book (sefer ḥatum), where one definition follows upon the other—the se- fyroth and the partzufym, the various worlds and their dynamics—forming  a series of statements unsupported by the merest attempt at intelligibility  (zikhron shel ghirsa, akh belo sevara).71  The task Luzzatto assigns himself, then, is to recover the lost meaning  of the true knowledge: he seeks to clarify the obscure notions—that is, the  notions that have become obscure—of the true science, Kabbalah. In order  to accomplish this and convince those endowed with a clear intellect that  Kabbalah not only is not a nonsensical doctrine, but is the truest and most  complete of the sciences, Luzzatto deems it necessary to couch this science in  the language of rational philosophy, or, to be more precise, rational theology.  The ḥoqer—the philosopher interlocutor in Luzzatto’s dialogue—begins  by expressing his reservations. Even though persons of unquestionable piety  (ḥasydym) follow Kabbalah, their arguments appear abstruse (zarym), and  in some instances absolutely vain and empty (devarym shel mah bekhakh),  as in the case of the discourse on the sefyroth. This leads him to request  199 </page> <page sequence="16"> Chapter 9 elucidations which, if they cannot reach the level of logical necessity, will  at least not be at odds with straightforward reasoning (ha-sekhel ha-yashar).  Naturally, the philosopher is rapidly won over by the kabbalist’s disquisi- tions, and especially by his style of argumentation, which is worthy of true  science in its rigor and clarity. Thanks to the explanations of the kabba- list—Luzzatto’s alter-ego—nonsense metamorphoses into knowledge of the  highest order. The text emphasizes the purposefully “historical” character of  Luzzatto’s elucidations, demonstrating his ambition to see Kabbalah recover  its true status in his own times. The rationalist concludes: I could not stand the things I heard about this knowledge. I judged them  foolish and banal, and could not find anything in them that could be called  science. Yet, in this generation, I affirm that we are confronted with an  extraordinary science, and it is good that every intelligent person should  abandon all the other intellectual pursuits in the world in order to follow  this great and holy science. In comparison, all other intellectual pursuits  have no value.72  The idea of engaging in a rational discussion with Kabbalah’s detractors  is also present in Basilea’s text. Significantly, the Mantuan kabbalist calls  for a public debate on the crucial subject of the antiquity of the Zohar and  of Kabbalah in general, in which reason and the conclusions of indisputably  authoritative teachers will be the only decisive criteria. In fact, he warns his  (Jewish) rationalist opponents against the prejudices they might show by  rejecting evidence merely in order to deny prestige to the ancient traditions  of their own culture.73 Evidently, in the early eighteenth century, the public  space where one debated one’s opinions was just as much of a concrete real- ity as was the attraction that many Jews felt for rationalist critique.  Although Basilea did not write a dialogue between a kabbalist and a ra- tionalist, his Emunath ḥakhamym makes an interesting reference to debates  that actually took place.74 In this book, the Mantuan rabbi mentions hav- ing assiduously studied philosophical and scientific texts in his youth before  going on to read Kabbalah—as developed by Mosheh Cordovero—which he  found in no way at odds with rational inquiry: “and I showed [these ideas]  to several philosophers of our people, believers who asked me many ques- tions on difficult topics touching on the science of the secrets of the Torah.”  He then repeated this experiment at the age of forty-four, reading Lurianic  200 </page> <page sequence="17"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time Kabbalah with Shemuel Norzi. Basilea mentions proving the truth of the  notion of tzimtzum—the contraction of the Divinity—to various Jewish phi- losophers solely on the basis of philosophical proofs, before publicly repeat- ing his demonstration and only making reference to topics pertaining to the  natural sciences. Basilea thus invites his reader into a discussion guided by a single im- perative: rationality, on the grounds that “the truth will emerge only through  debate, and we will both profit.” Nevertheless, the authority of the Torah and  the Talmudic masters also carry weight as proof, because their truths are as  evident as tangible experience.75  Rational Reductions of Kabbalah In their different ways, two Italian kabbalist-philosophers who lived  four centuries apart, Yoḥanan Alemanno (1434–post-1504) and Eliyahu  Benamozegh (1823–1900), observed similarities between certain kabbalistic  notions and some aspects of the philosophical thought of their own time.  Alemanno, who lived in the Florence of Lorenzo de’ Medici and Pico della  Mirandola, identifies the sefyroth with “spiritual numbers” of Pythagorean- Platonic origin.76 Contemporary with Positivism and Post-Hegelian Idealism,  Benamozegh devotes himself to finding equivalents for various kabbalistic  concepts in the terminology used in those schools of philosophical thought.77  Rather than merely assessing the relative merits of Jewish and non-Jewish  doctrines, both Alemanno and Benamozegh focus on understanding and elu- cidating their own conceptual tradition in light of the intellectual coordinates  of the culture surrounding them.  It is difficult to ascertain whether eighteenth-century Italian kabbalists  shared the same motivations. Certainly they explicitly regarded Kabbalah as  the true doctrine; for them, it was as superior to philosophy as divine revela- tion was to human thought. However, this did not imply a coherently elabo- rated opposition between Kabbalah and philosophy. Their audience was  essentially, or exclusively, Jewish. They aimed their partially philosophical  readings at those educated “modern” Jews who had grown increasingly wary  of the “mythical” language and dogmatic tone of Lurianic Kabbalah and were  distancing themselves from it, lured away by post-Cartesian rationalism.  As the kabbalist Avi‘ad Sar Shalom Basilea is more of a scientist that  a theologian, his calling does not lead him to elaborate a logical-rational  201 </page> <page sequence="18"> Chapter 9 reduction of Kabbalah. Instead, he seeks scientific and empirical confirma- tions for various kabbalistic notions, such as the gilgul (the transmigration  of souls), the effectual value of the pronunciation of the names of God,78  and the existence of spirits. He suggests there is a striking harmony between  rabbinical affirmations and the conclusions of modern science: he maintains  that the Talmudic rabbis—who are infinitely wiser than his own contem- poraries—already declared that the Earth was spherical in form,79 and that  their astronomical observations anticipated those of contemporary scientists,  as well as his own.80 Furthermore, the configuration of the highest sefyroth  is confirmed by the science of anatomy, which has identified the tripartite  structure of the brain.81  The theoretical framework of Basilea’s magnum opus, Emunath  ḥakhamym, is especially interesting, because it attempts to justify compul- sory belief in the affirmations of the masters of the Jewish tradition, the  Talmudists and the kabbalists. According to Basilea, both philosophy and  science are founded solely on hypotheses, which are neither empirically cer- tain nor logically necessary. If these hypotheses change, so do the entire con- structions they support. Although Aristotelian physics and metaphysics had  long constituted the peak of human knowledge for philosophers—including  many Jewish thinkers, especially Maimonides—they had recently been dis- placed by Cartesianism. Notions which for centuries had been accepted as  true, and which generations of philosophers had toiled over—prima materia,  form and matter, substance and accident, the active intellect and separated  intellects, etc.—had been discarded as though suddenly irrelevant. Moreover,  if past theories could prove to have been vain, it was clear that this could  eventually happen to current theories. It was a small step that separated this  realization from the belief the only true certainty lay in tradition (Talmudic- kabbalistic).82 Basilea’s expertise in contemporary science is thus associated  with an extreme traditionalism, founded on the notion of the weakness of  the human intellect, which has produced dreams and madness and mistaken  them for the truth. The Mantuan rabbi condems medieval philosophy for not  being Jewish enough, and turns instead to the emunath ḥakhamym (faith in  the masters of the tradition), in the belief that there is no other solid ground  to stand on in that period of epistemological transition. The Jewish tradition  is just as true as sensitive perception, even though our inability to find a  true explanation means that we must sometimes content ourselves with mere  awareness, as in the case of magnetism and the tides.83  202 </page> <page sequence="19"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time As for Yosef Ergas, the Livornese rabbi admits that there are some  points of contact between philosophy and Kabbalah, particularly in ideas  of unity, incorporeity, and the immutability of God, although, quoting the  fourteenth-century Menaḥem Recanati, he specifies that the only philosophy  he takes into account predates Aristotle—which we may easily infer means  Pythagoras and Plato.84 In effect, his Shomer emunym essentially attempts to  explain the major notions of Lurianic Kabbalah according to standard philo- sophical categories. Although Ergas considers Pythagoras and Plato to be  close to Kabbalah, he nevertheless constantly (although obviously only im- plicitly) evokes neo-Platonic ideas, especially in his accounts of the emana- tions which exist between the eyn sof and the sefyroth; moreover, his account  of the cosmological system of the spheres85—which is tied to the theory of  the four physical elements86—has Aristotelian roots, as do the principle of  causality and the idea of rational necessity. In other words, Ergas’s concep- tual frame of reference is entirely medieval.  Ergas feels obliged to “explain” Lurianic Kabbalah in order to save it  from accusations of irrationality,87 but attempts this rescue operation by turn- ing to categories that were already considered irrelevant by intellectuals who  kept abreast of contemporary epistemological shifts. This included Jewish  scholars, even religious ones such as Basilea.  Nevertheless, Ergas’ explanations and clarifications are noteworthy. He  considers the existence of the sefyroth—which is central to kabbalistic doc- trine—to be a logical necessity in order to explain the transition from unity  to multiplicity, and from perfection to imperfection; that is, from God to the  world (or worlds). Implicitly alluding to Platonic ideas, Ergas describes the  sefyroth (divine emanations) as the “model” and the “ideal type” (defus) of  being.88 This relationship may also be considered from the perspective of the rela- tionship between living beings and the divinity. Intermediate entities existing  between the created worlds (the material one included) and the absolutely  transcendent eyn sof, the sefyroth justify and enable the existence of com- mandment, prayer, sacrifice, and the Torah itself, all of which reside in the  world of multiplicity but are directed toward the unreachable eminence of  God. In effect, humans cannot address themselves directly to God, who lies  beyond the reach of representation, and therefore their prayers state what they  are capable of knowing: his attributes, the actions of which correspond to  the sefyroth, another important philosophical “reduction.” Man might, for  203 </page> <page sequence="20"> Chapter 9 example, evoke the divine attribute (which is to say, the sefyrah) of greatness,  while always keeping in mind (this is kawwanah, or intention) his aspiration  to elevate himself to the eyn sof. In other words, it is through the sefyroth  that humans attempt to reach the unknowable and ineffable when they pray,  keep the commandments, perform sacrifices, study the Torah, and engage in  all acts of religious value.89 There can be no relationship between humankind  and God without the sefyroth, given the absolute transcendence of the divine:  For us, the recipients of the Torah, philosophical notions [of the unity,  incorporeity and immutability of God] are not sufficient. In order to com- prehend the Torah and its commandments we must know the secrets of  existence and of the production of intermediate causes—i.e. the sefyroth— by the eyn sof, blessed be His name. Most elements of the divine cult  depend on the knowledge of their existence, the order of their connections,  and their unification through the commandments of the Torah. No one can  serve God perfectly without knowing the characteristics of this science.90  Ergas insists on this necessity, presenting it as though it logically con- firms the existence of the sefyroth. However, he specifies that this is only an  a posteriori justification demonstrating the non-irreconcilability of Kabbalah  and Reason, because the existence of the sefyroth is a fact, decided by God,  and communicated to the Jews through the prophets: “kabbalistic notions  have no need of proof.”91  The imaginative and mysterious definitions proposed by Yitzḥaq Luria  and his disciple, Ḥayyim Vital, thus become clear and intellectually satis- fying (devarym nekhoḥym la-mevyn), even though they are the product of  revelations rather than human reasoning.92 Ergas describes the kabbalistic  notion of ziwwug (union) as the union between an emanating (mashpia‘) and  an emanated body (mushpa‘), and defines ‘ibbur (pregnancy) as the passage  from a thin and invisible existence to a thick and visible one.93 He gives an  intellectual and neo-Platonic account of the hithlabbeshuth (garment), ex- plaining it according to a system wherein intermediate entities know and  contemplate each other: The garment and the enfolding (hithkaleluth) of one sefyrah by another  have the meaning (‘inyiano) of knowledge; an entity knows another en- tity, and enfolds and clothes it with its comprehension.94  204 </page> <page sequence="21"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time In more complex passages, Ergas deploys the notions of mashal (alle- gory) and sod (esoteric interpretation, which seems to be equivalent with  mashal)95 in order to explain the more material and anthropomorphic images  of Lurianic Kabbalah: shi‘ur qomah (measurement of the dimensions of the  world of the sefyroth), and tzimtzum (contraction of the divine to permit the  creation of the worlds). In order to understand shi‘ur qomah, it is necessary  to think of an intermediate entity, or sefyrah, being enfolded by another, just  as the body clothes the soul. The compound formed by these two divine enti- ties, in which each directs a lower one according to precise and measurable  relations, may be represented by the image of man, his dimensions being the  object of measurement.  The notion of tzimtzum being more difficult to explain, Ergas is compelled  to refer at length to Mosheh Cordovero’s96 and Menaḥem ’Azariyah Fano’s  differences of opinion on the meaning of the divine will—ratzon (a notion  which is central to Luzzatto’s elaboration)—in order to conclude that tzimt- zum does refer to the Divinity so much as to divine energy. Ergas describes  tzimtzum as the image (mashal) of an act which is hard to grasp: God reducing  his own infinite energy in order to create space for the creation of the worlds.  Aware of having provided a personal explanation, Ergas develops a purely  logical reflection, based on the categories of the finite and the infinite.97 The “theological” dimension of Ergas’ work is clearer still in two other  important stances he adopts. The first is his enunciation of the principles  of faith as they appear in kabbalistic writings (particularly in the Zohar),  although he formulates them with a clarity that leaves no room for doubt, in  order to respond to his rationalist interlocutor. The second is a description of  the various types of divine providence (hashgaḥah). In both cases, Kabbalah  becomes theology, because Ergas invokes the particular terminology and  problems of this discipline.  We shall limit ourselves to listing Ergas’ principles of faith (‘iqqarey ha- emunah), although it is worth noting at the outset that this kind of treatment  had fallen out of favor two centuries earlier, after Yitzḥaq Abrabanel had  modified the principles set down by Maimonides, Ḥasday Crescas, and Yosef  Albo.98 Ergas’ ‘Iqqarym—which have not yet been studied by specialists of  Jewish dogma99—are important both because they are founded exclusively  on kabbalistic sources and because they demonstrate that in the eighteenth  century, even a kabbalist felt the need to proceed systematically. As we shall  see, Luzzatto will go on to develop a similarly systematic stance and declare  205 </page> <page sequence="22"> Chapter 9 it one of the fundamental requisites of all knowledge, and in particular of  the supreme knowledge, Kabbalah. According to Ergas, there are six kabba- listic-theological dogmas which all the Masters of Israel have received, and  which carry an obligation for all the faithful: “whoever accepts the celestial  yoke must believe in them [the principles]; he who rejects them has no share  in the God of Israel and in His Torah.”100 These principles a as follows: 1) God fills the world, there is no place  devoid of his power; 2) God supports the world, attends to it, and directs it;  3) God is alone in his world; 4) God does not receive influence or benefit  from any other being; 5) He is not a body, nor energy in a body, and does not  mix with nor associate with any body; 6) He is not knowable; the only thing  we know about him is that he exists, and that his existence is necessary.101 The other section of Ergas’ work worth mentioning here is a passage  on providence102 which responds to the same classificatory imperative as  his profession of the dogmas, and is not founded on theoretical kabbalistic  sources. In the first part of a series of ten affirmations, Ergas analyzes the  general or individual manifestations of divine providence on various earthly  beings based on his own theological deductions. In the second part, he ex- plores the causes of suffering and premature death with reference to kabba- listic beliefs, such as the reincarnation (gilgul), the defense against demoniac  accusers (mekatregym), and the evil eye (‘ayin ha-ra‘). Ergas’ theses on providence were criticized by several important Hassidic  masters for being too “philosophical,” even though they did on the whole  commend Shomer emunym.103 Although he did not acknowledge it, Ergas  based his ideas on Maimonides,104 who in turn referred back to Aristotle, in  order to argue that whereas providence applies to humans on an individual  basis, its impact on minerals, plants, and animals is only general—in other  words, collective, common to an entire species. He links whatever happens  individually to these lower beings to chance, an idea which is at odds with  the principle that every event, from the greatest to the most infinitesimal,  from “the horn of the unicorn to the eggs of lice,” is dependent on the direct  will of God. Whereas in the first part of his analysis of providence Ergas’ arguments  could be considered too rationalist-Maimonidean for a religious thinker, in  the second part the reader is reminded that Kabbalah contains practices and  beliefs that have little to do with rational theology. Ergas clearly notes that  philosophy and Kabbalah diverge on questions relating to the belief in the  206 </page> <page sequence="23"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time efficacy of amulets, the performative power of pronouncing the names of  the divine, demonology, the nature of the soul, and the punishments inflicted  upon it. There is a limit to how much Kabbalah may be rationalized, and its  practices overstep this limit.  Although something of a pre-Enlightenment wind, as the writings of  Yosef Attias testify,105 blew on the Jewish community of Leghorn, where  Ergas resided, the city also later hailed kabbalists such as Ḥayyim Yosef  David Azulay (Jerusalem 1724—Leghorn 1806), an immensely erudite man  with partially “modern” tendencies who nevertheless also supported himself  by writing amulets.106  In Padua, a city with a prestigious university, the young Moses Ḥayyim  Luzzatto displayed a propensity for rationality from his first writings, while  also receiving the celestial revelations of a maggid. Similarly, although the  passion for and competence in the sciences of Avi‘ad Sar Shalom Basilea  of Mantua is well-established,107 the following passage from his Emunath  ḥakhamym provides a fairly balanced perspective on the whole spectrum of  ideas and beliefs held by eighteenth-century Italian kabbalists: A great philosopher of our people, who lived in an earlier age than ours,  though not too long ago, completely rejected the existence of demons.  A house was shown to him in Venice, in which the noises of spirits were  heard at night, in particular from a window that faced a narrow alley, as  is common in that city. The demon would knock at night, and when the  house was opened there was no one to be found inside, nor could there  have been anyone inside. [...] Yet [that philosopher] asserted: “I see all  this, and nevertheless, I do not believe it.”108 Like Ergas, Luzzatto proposes a reduction of Kabbalah grounded in ra- tional theology, starting from Ḥoqer w-meqqubal, a dialogue illustrating sev- eral fundamental principles of Kabbalah with exemplary clarity. Indeed, clar- ity is what Luzzatto seeks to achieve in this and other works which could be  described as attempting to divulge Kabbalah. Luzzatto feels that the written  transmission of meaning imposes limits on clarity, because the transmission  will be incomplete if the reader does not strive to understand the author’s in- tentions. Yet he believes that it is just as impossible to find explanations that  will be clear and satisfying for every reader as it is to find spectacles suitable  for every eye.109  207 </page> <page sequence="24"> Chapter 9 Although Luzzatto touches on many topics in his dialogue, we will focus  on his definition of Kabbalah and its field of application, as it is obviously  central to the kabbalist’s conversation with his rationalist interlocutor, who  thinks according to different categories. Luzzatto writes that the object of  that doctrine cannot be God, who lies beyond any possible thought or discus- sion. Instead, what is at stake is the way God directs the world. Kabbalah is  nothing other than the explanation of the procedure of He whose name is blessed, the order  of the rules of direction (hanhagah) through which the Holy One, blessed  is He, directs and articulates all the events occurring in His world with  great wisdom. 110 As for the sefyroth, they make the divine will tangible, and he creates and di- rects the world through them: the world depends entirely on these entities.111  Luzzatto grounds the fields of application of Kabbalah in categories remi- niscent of traditional philosophical classifications: God, humankind, soul,  world. The parallel between these systems of classification nevertheless stops  there, as they differ radically in their content. The topic of God, as devel- oped in Kabbalah, focuses on—and is limited to—knowledge of the diffusion  (hithpashetuth) of his supreme light, the only thing that we may know of him.  As for humankind, it is not conceived on its own terms but relative to the  bonds which it has with the divine worlds and can act on: the human body is  considered to represent these worlds in operation, while the soul is conceived  of in relation to the divine service it performs, conditioning worldly events  until the final redemption. This includes the theory of the reincarnation of  souls (gilgul). Finally, the world is not studied according to philosophical  or scientific methods, which are not only superficial but erroneous; instead,  under the influence (hashpa‘ah) of the sefyroth, an esoteric reading of the  world effectively leads to knowledge of the functioning of the worlds and the  sefyroth themselves, in parallel with events in the inferior world.112 None of this is proven rationally. Instead, it is revealed by God.  Nevertheless, “the intellect may experience pleasure and may be enriched  in its natural need to know and understand.”113 All the explanations given  by the kabbalist conform to rational imperatives, even though they are not  rational in origin: Kabbalah is not portrayed as a doctrine blindly adopted by  simple intellects incapable of reflection, but as true ḥokhmah, that is to say a  208 </page> <page sequence="25"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time praiseworthy and coherent knowledge which has the merit of explaining the  totality of the created world in both its being and its becoming.  Throughout his works, Luzzatto praises straight reason (sekhel yashar),  which is one of the criteria for evaluation in Kabbalah.114 On close examina- tion, the Paduan kabbalist is reminiscent of medieval Jewish philosophers:  like the great Jewish rationalist Sa‘adiyah Gaon,115 he considers knowledge  and understanding to be religious obligations—mitzwoth. Nevertheless, for  Luzzatto, this commandment does not imply the rational comprehension of  the Torah, but concerns the precise knowledge of the entire system of the  divine guidance of the world.116 Luzzatto writes that humans were created for  the purpose of knowledge, and more precisely, “the knowledge [hassagah]  of the glory of the Creator [...] for which they were given cognizance and  abundant knowledge.”117 This closely echoes Maimonides: “true praise of  God is the comprehension [hassagah] of His greatness [...] and only human- kind praises him with words that indicate that which he has understood with  his intellect.”118 The true, life-giving light comes from cognizance and knowledge, writes  Luzzatto;119 this is not the light born of the act of comprehension in itself,  but the divine light that descends into the world as a consequence of human  understanding. Luzzatto’s brand of intellectualism fits within a kabbalistic  context, wherein each human action corresponds to a divine action (and vice  versa); again, this evokes medieval philosophers, including Maimonides,  for whom the act of comprehension unites the passive intellect with the  active—divine—intellect.120  For Luzzatto, human history is a history of intellectual decadence.  Whereas the ancients were closer to true intellectual knowledge, more recent  generations have become distracted from their true purpose, and pursue their  activities while being immersed in materialism.121 Redemption (tiqqun) will  therefore be a return to full knowledge. Once the unity of God is revealed, hu- mankind wil be able “to bask in the splendor of His holiness, and completely  and permanently understand deeper things than before, without limits.”122  A Theology That Implies Kabbalah The rational reduction of Kabbalah is particularly in evidence in Luzzatto’s  other dialogue, Da‘ath tevunoth, which may be translated as “Knowledge of  Clear Things” or “Knowledge of Comprehensible Things.”123  209 </page> <page sequence="26"> Chapter 9 This dialogue does not pit a rationalist against a kabbalist. Instead, its in- terlocutors are the soul and the intellect: it dramatizes the soul turning to the  intellect in order to understand principles of faith which it believes in, but is  unable to justify rationally—providence, reward, the Messiah, and the resur- rection of the dead. The soul’s position is clear: it requests havanah (compre- hension), yedi‘ah (knowledge), and sevara (rational thought) for principles  in which it has a simple faith.  Throughout this book, Luzzatto behaves like a rational theologian and re- fers to traditional theological categories. The questions he addresses are: the  origin of evil, and consequently original sin and free will; the necessary ex- istence of God and the contingency of beings; God’s attributes; humankind  as final cause of creation; and, finally, redemption. However, the content of  this theology is more or less obviously supported by kabbalistic notions, and  this certainly bestows a certain originality on Luzzatto’s rational construc- tion. In other words, Da‘ath tevunoth is not, like Ergas’ Shomer emunym, an  attempt at reading Kabbalah in light of philosophical categories. Instead, it  is a theological treatise constructed according to a rational model, which im- plies Kabbalah without alluding to it explicitly.124 Luzzatto’s only kabbalistic  references are to sections of the Zohar, which he conveniently calls mid- rash.125 Even a reader completely unfamiliar with kabbalistic notions would  be perfectly capable of understanding the dialogue.  It certainly seems possible to think this was part of a “strategy”: al- though he did not dissimulate his kabbalistic activities during that difficult  period, the Paduan author nevertheless tended to emphasize the absolutely  orthodox character of his thought, couching it in the language of traditional  theology without recourse to Kabbalah.Yet, a few months after complet- ing Da‘ath tevunoth, Luzzatto wrote Kelalym rishonym (First Principles):  although more or less parallel in content to Da‘ath tevunoth, this series  of propositions resorts to the terminology of Lurianic Kabbalah.126 One  might therefore suggest that the philosophical-theological tendency of  Luzzatto’s kabbalistic thought allowed him to move seamlessly between  different disciplinary languages. Indeed, one might even ask whether the  philosophical-theological character of Luzzatto’s thought in fact shaped  his understanding of kabbalistic categories from the outset, rather than in- tervening a posteriori in the form of explanation or comment. In other  words, did the categories of rational theology frame his conceptual grasp  of the Lurianic Kabbalah? 210 </page> <page sequence="27"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time In Da‘ath tevunoth, Luzzatto understands the originally kabbalistic notion  of tiqqun (repair) in terms of the traditional category of redemption, which  is absolutely central to his thought. Indeed, one might equate tiqqun with the  geulah (redemption) of which the prophets and the Talmudic masters speak:  it is the progressive and inevitable revelation of the unity of God, which  will dispel ideas of merit or guilt and therefore free will. It corresponds to  a time when there will no longer be space for guilt, and good will replace  evil. In this definitive phase of tiqqun the divine light (hearath panym) will  reveal his concealed face (hester panym), leading to perfection. The absence  of unity, the alternation of good and evil, and the material shadow prevail  during the phases that come before this culmination.  Luzzatto’s kabbalistic influences are most evident in his account of these  phases. The divine decision to make visible the various forces presiding over  the operation of the world is a case in point. As the attributes (middoth)—anal- ogous to the sefyroth, which are significantly not mentioned—of Judgment  and Kindness take turns directing the world, they produce light and darkness  in varying proportions, more or less disclosing and concealing the divinity.  This is illustrated and made visible in man through the soul and the body:  whereas the soul is the image (tziyur) of the law, or the direction (hanhagah)  of disclosure, the body represents concealment. In other words, the soul is  one, like the unified perfection that will manifest itself through the total dis- closure of divine unity, but the body is constituted of various parts, because  it represents the world in the intermediate stage of reward and punishment,  when God is concealed, not wanting to make manifest his perfection. In this  phase, just as his ways of directing are multiple, so too he has wanted the cre- ated body to have many parts and various members, in order that it may truly  correspond (maqbylym) to the laws that govern the world.This, according to  Luzzatto, is the true sense of the verse, “Let us make Man in Our image after  Our likeness.”127 Similarly, the individual parts of the human body correspond  to different aspects of divine direction: thus, the right and left sides of the  body are, respectively, images of severe and benevolent governance. Luzzatto’s approach to the same questions is radically different in his  treatise Kelalym rishonym. Written after Da‘ath tevunoth, this brief text en- gages with the same topics—creation, the existence of evil, the overcoming  of evil—but in kabbalistic terms. In keeping with the program he set him- self at the beginning of his dialogue Ḥoqer w-mequbbal (Philosopher and  Kabbalist), the Paduan kabbalist strove to elucidate the notions of Kabbalah,  211 </page> <page sequence="28"> Chapter 9 in particular Lurianic Kabbalah.128 Nevertheless, he cannot entirely help re- sorting to technical jargon, which only readers at least partly familiar with  the doctrine can understand. For example, Luzzatto compares the mixture  of good and evil typical of the phase that comes before tiqqun—or redemp- tion—to the relationship of the reshymu (the remainder of the divine light  in the world) and the qaw (the ray of divine light that crosses the created  worlds). Whereas the former is synonymous with exteriority (ḥitzoniyuth),  the latter evokes interiority (penimiyuth): in other words, the two together  conjure the concealment and disclosure of the divine face. These ideas pre- suppose the fundamental notion of shevyrath ha-kelym (rupture of the re- ceptacles or instruments), which caused the divine light formerly contained  within the receptacles to instead coalesce with those receptacles. Together  these two dimensions—good and evil, spirituality and materiality—consti- tute the hanhagah: that is, the law regulating the combination and succession  of good and evil as the worlds operate. The image of the hanhagah in its  fullness is primordial man (adam qadmon), and the individual events taking  place in the various worlds are the branches (‘anafym) of this primordial  man. At the end of the process of repair and redemption, illumination will  overwhelm the shadow of matter, disseminating knowledge throughout the  community of Israel, the ray (qaw) will reabsorb the remainder of the light  (reshymu), and the operation of the world will be characterized by unity.129 This brief treatise becomes yet more complicated when Luzzatto turns to  more specific notions, in particular the different parts of primordial man, the  roots and the individualization—i.e. the coming into existence—of events in  the various worlds, and the split between inferior and superior sefyroth in the  four worlds of the divinity. His treatment of these notions makes it clear that  Kelalym rishonym was intended for a very different audience than Da‘ath  tevunoth.  Kelalym rishonym also offers some interesting new insights into another  question, already evoked in Da‘ath tevunoth: how the human image makes  the operation of the worlds visible. Instead of merely presenting that idea,  Luzzatto now contextualizes it within the dynamics of the sefyroth. In other  words, he now explains where—and to a certain extent how—the visualiza- tion of the divine laws governing all the worlds and their concrete application  in history (hanhagah) is possible. At the same time, he deploys kabbalistic  notions in order to clarify the possibility of prophecy. According to Luzzatto,  this is all thanks to the last sefyrah, the malkhuth (kingship) of the last divine  212 </page> <page sequence="29"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time world, the world of action (‘asiyah). This sefyrah is the door, or passage,  leading from the world of divine action to the world of human visualization: Malkhuth is called “the image of God,” because it is the root of the im- ages of all created beings, which are the branches of the superior attrib- utes. The Lord, blessed be He, wanted to reproduce (leha‘atiq) the mode  of operation of His attributes, including all the details connected with  them, according to the images of the created beings. The root of these  images, according to the law of such a reproduction, is the malkhuth.  Prophets perceive the upper lights according to their reproduction in  images. Therefore, they perceive only the malkhuth, thanks to what the  upper lights understand and conceive. This is explained several times in  the Zohar and the Tiqqunym, through the esoteric meaning of the verses:  “But let him that glorieth glory in this” (Jeremiah 9:23), and “This is the  gate of the Lord” (Psalms 118:20).130 The rational reduction of Kabbalah by two nearly contemporary authors,  Ergas and Luzzatto, is no coincidence. It clearly constitutes their response to  what they perceived to be an intellectual necessity at a time when philosoph- ical-scientific rationalism was spreading through Europe.  However, the two authors probably had different intellectual frames of ref- erence. Unlike his Livornese counterpart, the Paduan kabbalist does not appeal  to medieval, Aristotelian, or Platonic categories of thought. Luzzatto cannot  do without the kabbalistic notion of hashpa‘ah (emanation), which defines  both the relation between the worlds created by the divine will—in a descend- ing order of spirituality—and the divine will’s constant direction (hanhagah)  of the worlds. In order to clarify the concept of hashpa‘ah, he turns to “the  great teacher,” Maimonides, in a rare textual reference:131 “All that is produced  and exists among beings is produced or exists insofar as it is emanated from  Him, blessed be He.”132 Yet, the reader quickly realizes that Luzzatto does not  explain what he means by “emanation.” He only speaks generically of “that  which originates from the Creator and is destined to his creatures,” which is  not otherwise definable because humans cannot know how God really oper- ates, and are limited to ascertaining the effects of his actions. In other words,  this category is left open, and represents nothing more than a simple name. Luzzatto also deploys another notion which seems to pertain to an  Aristotelian worldview: finalism. His conception of redemption is marked by  213 </page> <page sequence="30"> Chapter 9 a strong and basically optimistic finalism: good will ultimately triumph. The  final causes of Aristotelian physics are not in play here, however. Instead, what  we find is a philosophy of history which seems fairly consistent with the op- timistic conceptions of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe (includ- ing the Jewish haskalah). Spinoza’s radical critique notwithstanding, finalism  would still find fertile ground in European thought for many years to come. Whatever their formal similarities, Ergas and Luzzato’s intellectual ref- erence points differ significantly. Luzzatto departs in three important ways  from Ergas, who thinks according to the medieval categories of metaphys- ics, physics, and cosmology (the four elements of the sub-lunar sphere, the  celestial spheres).133 First, Luzzatto’s thought is more dynamic, centering as  it does on a philosophy of history that leads to the total and definitive rev- elation of divine Unity. Second, it is more systematic, as it emphasizes the  importance of conceptual coherence and distinguishing between concepts.  Third, it is less openly neo-Platonic: instead, it was inspired by a scientific,  post-Cartesian model, as we will try to show.134 Between 1736 and 1743, when Luzzatto lived in Amsterdam and was nei- ther writing nor teaching on kabbalistic matters, he devoted himself to writ- ing brief but edifying treatises on logic and religious works intended for a  larger public than the works of his Italian period. They included a treatise on  ethics, Mesyllath yesharym (The Path of the Just, published in Amsterdam in  1740), which remains his best-known work to this day, and Derekh ha-Shem  (The Way of the Lord, published in Amsterdam in 1896), which synthesized  the principles of Jewish faith and practice. Luzzatto composed these works  in order that the reader might “gather from them an intellectually correct and  sufficient representation, free from inaccuracies and confusion.”135 Derekh ha-Shem is a small manual intended for good believers and ob- servers. It is meant as a starting point for religious study and consists of  four sections on the following topics: 1) the existence of God and the cre- ated worlds; 2) providence; 3) prophecy; and 4) worship. Even then, the  Kabbalah implicitly makes its presence felt right from the first section, where  the author establishes that one of the great principles that we possess is that to each body of the infe- rior world there corresponds separate forces on high, from which inferior  beings and that which happens to them [literally: their accidents, miqrey- hem] emerge, according to a concatenation willed by divine Wisdom.  214 </page> <page sequence="31"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time The superior forces are the roots, the inferior beings are the branches  and the derivatives; and they are linked one to another, like the rings of  a chain.136  The sefyroth, which Luzzatto explains with the philosophical term mid- doth (attributes) in Da‘ath tevunoth, simply becomes koḥoth (forces) in  Derekh ha-Shem. As for providence, it is now called by its traditional name,  hashgaḥah, instead of hanhagah, the typical term of his earlier works. After  reading Kabbalah through the lens of rational theology, Luzzatto makes it the  subject of a popular catechism in Derekh ha-Shem, emphasizing the impor- tance of the devotion of the faithful and of terrestrial and celestial rewards.  Furthermore, a range of topics which he hardly, if at all, touched upon in  prior works make their appearances in this book, in particular the influence  of the stars,137 the effects of the evocation of the divine names and of magi- cal acts (kyshuf),138 and the presence of impure forces during the nighttime  hours.139 The daily prayers are explained according to the kabbalistic kaw- wanah, but in a language comprehensible to people not familiar with the  esoteric doctrine. A work of divulgation, Derekh ha-Shem nevertheless also  seeks to “translate” Kabbalah, although at a different level than the works of  Luzzatto’s Italian period. Even at this popular level, Luzzatto insists on the need for precision.  In his presentation of the Derekh ha-Shem, he asks the reader to give each  term due consideration, without forgoing exactitude, so as not to miss any  necessary argument, because his exposition follows principles of order and  progression.  Luzzatto’s reaffirmation of the centrality of intellectual knowledge ech- oes Maimonides’ aforementioned treatment of providence, which is one of  the most controversial points of the Andalusian philosopher’s intellectual- ism. Maimonides asserts in The Guide of the Perplexed that divine provi- dence follows the divine emanation (shefa‘) of intelligence. In other words,  for Maimonides “providence depends on intelligence,” and the most intel- ligent people (the prophets, in particular) enjoy special celestial attention.140  Picking up on this notion, Luzzatto applies it to the kabbalistic notion of  human action, suggesting that it attracts the emanation (hashpa‘ah): the more  elevated the action, the higher the level of emanation, or influence. Studying  the Torah according to the right criteria (higayon) thus not only means reach- ing the highest level of comprehension (haskalah), but also enjoying the  215 </page> <page sequence="32"> Chapter 9 most elevated influence (which can be parallel to Maimonidean providence),  since the two are linked. Luzzatto’s position on providence confirms his in- tellectualist orientation, even though he sets it out in the context of practical  Kabbalah, where knowledge is seen as a religious action corresponding to a  reaction in the divine world.141  The proximity between the intellectualism of the medieval philoso- phers and that of the eighteenth-century kabbalist is further demonstrated  by Luzzatto’s assertion that there are two paths to the fundamental truths  (such as the unity of God): the prophetic path and the rational path. Claiming  that he does not wish to linger on rational demonstrations, Luzzatto pre- fers to focus on prophetic notions—that is to say, kabbalistic notions, even  though he doesn’t make it explicit in this context—which demand rigorous  exposition: [God’s perfection, revealed at Sinai and transmitted by tradition] can also  be confirmed by rational study and theoretical demonstrations, when nec- essary, according to physics, geometry, astronomy, and other sciences,  from which one can draw true premises that clarify these true notions. But  we shall not dwell on this approach here; instead, we will formulate true  premises, putting things in their proper order, according to the tradition  that is ours and to ideas that are well-known throughout our Nation.142  Kabbalah as System: A Jewish “Neo-Scholasticism”? Luzzatto’s approach in one of his most ambitious texts, Qelaḥ pithḥey  ḥokhmah (One Hundred Thirty-Eight Doors to Wisdom) may surprise one  who thinks of the rhetoric of the kabbalists a century before. In this work,  the author states a principle (a “door”) and proceeds to explain it in detail  by subdividing it into two parts. This constitutes the apex of systematic for- malism in kabbalistic exposition and departs markedly from the assertive  rhetoric and narrative-exegetical form that Kabbalah assumes in the works  of important seventeenth-century authors such as Mosheh Zacuto. In some  ways, the expository style of Qelaḥ pithḥey ḥokhmah echoes contemporary  manuals of Catholic scholastic theology based on Aquinas’ Summa theolog- ica.143 Indeed, one might even speak of neo-scholasticism in relation to this  text, as with those of contemporary Catholic authors. The uniqueness of this  Jewish form of “neo-scholasticism” lies in the fact that its content derives  216 </page> <page sequence="33"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time from Lurianic Kabbalah rather than from Jewish medieval philosophers, to  continue our parallel with Catholic thought.  The attempts of eighteenth-century authors, and Luzzatto in particular,  at systematizing Kabbalah and couching it in rational terms took place at a  time when philosophical production had stalled, according to historians of  Jewish thought. Traditionally, Jewish philosophical thought is said to have  gone through a period of stasis between the end of Jewish Aristotelianism— between the late fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries (especially after Eliyah  Del Medigo’s Beḥynath ha-dath, and Ovadiyah Sforno’s Or ‘ammym)—and  the “rebirth” of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with the authors of  the Haskalah.144 It is in this “void” that Kabbalah developed, until it assumed  the formal character of a theology toward the end of this period in Italy. Spelling out the name of God in an acrostic as it lays out its first princi- ple, the beginning of Qelaḥ pithḥey ḥokhmah is explicitly inspired by Sefer  ha-mada‘, Maimonides’ philosophical introduction to Mishneh Torah. As in  Maimonides’ text, Luzzatto highlights the unity of God only to set out the  object of Kabbalah directly afterwards, the object being to develop knowl- edge of the creation and the functioning of all beings on the basis of the  direction (hanhagah) of the divine will.  The principle of faith and the foundation of knowledge is the unity of the  Highest, blessed be He; and it is therefore this that must be explained at  the beginning, because all the knowledge of the truth is nothing other than  a knowledge that demonstrates the truth of faith; so that one understands  how everything that is created or that happens in the world comes from  the will of the Highest, and how everything is directed in the world as  suits the one God, blessed be He, and how everything develops in order  to reach perfection in the end.145  The unitary direction of all wordly things is the fundamental principle of this  treatise, and Luzzatto repeates it many times. All created beings and events  are linked to one another by a unitary intention—expressing a unitary will— and Kabbalah is the revealed doctrine allowing us to know this, down to the  smallest detail.146 Reiterated several times in other works as well, Luzzatto’s  definition exhibits the totalizing ambition of the doctrine which grants us  knowledge of all of the worlds. This ambition finds an echo in science, al- though its field of application is rather different. We will see further along  217 </page> <page sequence="34"> Chapter 9 that analogies may be drawn between science and Luzzatto’s understanding  of Kabbalah.  As the object of this study is to explicate the formal aspects of Luzzatto’s  work, we shall refrain from giving a detailed account of the Paduan kabba- list’s systematic treatment of the 138 principles of Lurianic Kabbalah, which  he enumerates, explains, and fits into a general conceptual framework. This  framework is essentially optimistic in nature: all the negative aspects of crea- tion and history are seen as necessary steps toward the final revelation of  divine unity. Evil exists for the benefit of good.147 Nevertheless, this rich  exposition addresses two complex questions which deserve to be examined,  both for their “philosophical” content and for Luzzatto’s attempt to engage  with them at a conceptual level. These are 1) the relationship between the  sefyroth and the eyn sof; and 2) the relationship between infinity and finitude,  God and creation. 1) The sefyroth: these emanations from God (hem mah she-ha-elohuth  mithpashet) are not created, since they are divine. It is their revelation that  is created. As for the eyn sof, it calls for the principles of negative theology,  because there is no word that can speak of him, nor any thought that can con- ceive of him. Yet, knowledge of the sefyroth is possible. They are qualities  or aspects (middoth) of the eyn sof, forces (koḥoth) which are not separate  from him, knowable manifestations of his will; they are the ways in which  the divine will directs the world. The sefyroth and worldly beings have dif- ferent origins: whereas the creation of the sefyroth is nothing other than their  manifestation, since they are divine, and therefore eternal, the very existence  of wordly beings is created. The fact that the aspects of the eyn sof have been  made manifest and can subsequently be known implies a limitation, because  the divine in itself is not knowable: this justifies their name, sefyroth, from  the verb safar (to count, or to measure). Their created limitation allows them  to be known.  All of God’s aspects are originally infinite in themselves, and so too is  their number. However, although God’s aspects are infinite in number, only  those through which the world was created and is directed have been made  manifest. The manifestation/limitation of the sefyroth corresponds to a di- vine providential design within which humankind plays a decisive role.148 At first glance, these notions recall Spinoza’s conception of the attributes  of substance as defined in his Ethics. Luzzatto’s myddoth echo Spinoza’s  definition of “attribute”: “what the intellect perceives of substance, as  218 </page> <page sequence="35"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time constituting its essence,” and which is infinite in itself and in number.149  Similarly, Luzzatto’s account of the kabbalistic partzufym (faces) as “the  particularization of the modes of acting of each of these forces,”150 recalls  Spinoza’s definition of “mode”: “the affections of a substance, or that which  is in another through which it is also conceived.”151 In spite of such affinities,  there are many fundamental differences between the concepts Spinoza and  Luzzatto deploy. In particular, they refer to very different systems. As the  kabbalist’s account of creation and the divine direction of the world suggests,  his conceptual universe is religious. The philosopher, on the other hand,  deploys non-religious Cartesian concepts, such as thought and extension:  “Thought” and “extension” are two of “God’s infinite attributes.”152  2) The relationship between infinity and finitude: this is extremely diffi- cult to conceive, let alone describe. In order to account for the passage from  infinite divinity to finite materiality, Luzzatto turns to the Lurianic concept of  tzimtzum. Although the eyn sof possesses an infinite number of aspects—or  forces—according to him, the human intellect can only conceive of those  that played a role in the origin of the world and in directing it. As the force  which produces the world undergoes a reduction, or contraction (tzimtzum),  it renounces its infinity. This benefits humankind, because it allows humans  to play a role in perfecting (tiqqun) the world and returning it to perfection.  How was the move from infinity to finitude possible? Luzzatto asserts that  infinity already contains finitude—limits are already present within limit- lessness—and the divine will decided to make these limits manifest. It is  through the passage into existence of limits that the unknowable divine will  becomes knowable, or—in kabbalist parlance—visible. The limitation of the  divine force leading to the material world is therefore not a non-being in the  neo-Platonic sense, but rather a being (qiyum we-lo he‘der) that is already  present within the infinite. Although there is no space within the infinite, this  reduction allows the creation of a space (ḥalal) in which the root of justice  (dyn) is manifested, altering the initial perfection. Infinite light made visible  thanks to the reduction of divine force is called reshymu: that is, the impres- sion (roshem) of infinite light.153 As limits are uncovered, the worlds gradu- ally begin to come into being according to a hierarchy defined by their levels  of spirituality, and imperfection starts to manifest itself. Beyond its attempt to conceptualize the Lurianic doctrine, Luzzatto’s text  describes the transition from infinity to finitude in terms of a very optimistic  philosophy of history. The divine will sets the whole process into motion in  219 </page> <page sequence="36"> Chapter 9 order to allow humankind to recognize that even evil is the work of the will  of God, who will eventually eliminate it. On the other hand, Man is respon- sible for the final revelation of divine unity, since he can contribute to the  perfection of the world, at least at its lower levels.154 However, the divine will  complete the process by imposing perfection onto the world even if human- kind fails to contribute adequately to this apotheosis.  Although Qelaḥ pitḥey ḥokhmah gives a detailed account of the relative  roles that human and divine action will play in the advent of the future world,  this question becomes problematic in Da‘ath tevunoth. Indeed, there seems  to be an unresolved contradiction in Luzzatto’s thought: if redemption is cer- tain, what is the point of human activity? If the divine will is going to mani- fest itself “in any case,”155 why try to draw the divine closer by keeping the  mitzwoth? The “Soul” is fully conscious of these problems in this dialogue:  bewildered by the possible consequences of determinism, which could both  make human efforts futile and doom to irrelevance the notion that imperfec- tion allows Man greater merit as he strives to achieve perfection, the “Soul”  asks the “intellect” to clarify. His interlocutor’s response is simply to quote  biblical verses demonstrating beyond any shadow of a doubt that divine re- demption is independent of human behavior—a rather disappointing answer  in light of the exacting arguments presented in the dialogue.156  The Scientific Method:   The Importance of Making Distinctions Like any rigorous scholarly text, Kabbalah must be set out according to  precise criteria in order to be understood clearly. The “modern” kabbalists  never tired of repeating this. Luzzatto’s kabbalistic works all introduce meth- odological criteria designed to foster a formal association between esoteric  knowledge and science.157  The first of these criteria is a solid foundation: as the rationalist in  Luzzatto’s dialogue explains to the kabbalist, the doctrine must be built on  an unquestionable assertion:  Had I found at least one stable principle on which to build all these no- tions, perhaps their details would also have become comprehensible. But  without this principle it is useless to strain over the details, seeing as the  whole is problematic.158 220 </page> <page sequence="37"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time Supplying his interlocutor with this stable principle, the kabbalist simultane- ously defines the object of Kabbalah. As he explains that the unity of God is  this principle (yesod), and that the object (‘iniyan) of the doctrine is to ex- plain how God directs the world,159 Kabbalah ceases to be a disordered mass  of complex, obscure, and unnecessary notions.  This principle supplied, the next criterion is to establish distinctions  (havḥanah) between terms: definitions must be very precise because “com- prehension depends on distinction.”160 It is important to start by naming con- cepts161 before one can proceed in an orderly and progressive fashion. The  rationalist interlocutor is adamant that disorderly progress leaves the intel- lect dissatisfied, bewildered, and confused (navokh w-mevulbal). One must  therefore proceed step by step, examining the various parts of the construc- tion one by one.162 Incremental progression is key to knowledge: it is neces- sary to start from general premises before one can move toward a satisfying  global vision.163 Whereas disorderly progress fosters doubt by jumping from one topic  to the next, an orderly disquisition will allow for a correct understanding of  Kabbalah. Proceeding in an orderly fashion will grant rational coherence to  Kabbalah, will explain the doctrine, and will make it perfectly acceptable  to the intellect, which accepts the idea of God but is not satisfied by ob- scure formulas that do not belong to a rigorous system. Without elucidating  the meaning of each concept and the connections between them, one cannot  pretend to know Kabbalah. To omit this step is to confine oneself to stating  abstruse terms which mean nothing in and of themselves, such as “faces”  (partzufym), “situations” (matzavym), and “ascents and descents” (aliyoth  we-yeridoth). These examples taken from Lurianic Kabbalah were the most  embarassing to a rational mind,164 and it was no coincidence that Luzzatto  invoked them. In case of doubt, the criterion of order would help to justify one conclu- sion relative to another, because notions are validated by their logical con- nections. Whereas logical relationships generate knowledge, their absence  produces confusion (mevokhah).165 In other words, form can sometimes be a  criterion for evaluating content.  Proceeding logically also has pragmatic consequences, because a cor- rectly and rigorously ordered argument makes it possible to concentrate on  general principles, instead of lingering on details,166 while also sparing the  221 </page> <page sequence="38"> Chapter 9 intellect useless effort.167 Less is often more: economy is one of the guiding  principles of argumentation.168 Luzzatto’s tendency towards conceptual rigor goes beyond his kabbalistic  works. Written and published in Amsterdam in 1742—i.e., at a time when  he was not officially working on Kabbalah—Luzzatto’s study of Talmud,  Derekh tevunoth (The Way of Understanding)169 is essentially a treatise on  logic. According to him, the principles governing Talmudic discussions cor- respond to innate intellectual notions, which the Talmud simply elucidates: If one investigates correctly, one will find that all the questions (qushi- yoth) and answers (terutzym), like every part of Talmudic reasoning  (pilpul), lean on principles and notions that are innate to intellectual com- prehension, imposing themselves spontaneously and necessarily on the  human intellect without having to be learned.170  It is the scholar’s task to order these principles correctly in order to make  them operational. Studying complex arguments is made easier by reducing  them to a few brief, simple rules.171  The rules Luzzatto sets out for the study of Talmud are not based on tra- ditional rules of Talmudic hermeneutics, such as the thirteen rules of Rabbi  Ishma‘el. Instead, they are grounded in the principles of formal logic, which  draw on and develop Aristotelian logic. Thus, Luzzatto devotes a chapter  of Derekh tevunoth to the different types of argument, distinguising be- tween sensitive, conventional,172 and logical demonstrations.173 Whereas the  havḥanoth discriminate between terms and content in kabbalistic texts, in  Derekh tevunoth they become criteria of definition analogous in function to  Aristotelian categories, only more numerous (twenty-four instead of ten).  In that same year—1742—Luzzatto wrote the Sefer ha-higayon (“Treatise  on Logic”),174 which was mostly inspired by non-Jewish works.175 In this  brief text, he confirms that the correct use of the intellect depends on rigor- ous classification. He ends his first chapter by stating that “distinction is  the necessary foundation of intellectual operations in the quest for knowl- edge,”176 and declares that Jewish readers would find a treatise on logic use- ful. For Luzzatto, disseminating such a work amounts to a religious task:  just as farming perfects nature by increasing its beauty and usefulness,177 so  too does logic allow each person to achieve a correct knowledge, free from  confusion; both complete the work of God.178 222 </page> <page sequence="39"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time This short work stands out not for its originality but for its translation of  the traditional terms of logic into Hebrew. Even then, this “Hebraization”  of logic was redundant because Italian Jews likely to be interested in this  material could easily access it in Italian and Latin texts. The significance  of this attempt is essentially historical: it demonstrates that efforts to as- similate external cultural products into Jewish cultural coordinates were still  being made in the first decades of the eighteenth century. Although there  were many such endeavors in the history of Jewish culture, this was one of  the last in the history of Italian Jews, who were to confront non-Jewish works  directly in the coming decades, no longer needing to “Hebraize” them.  Luzzatto’s apologia of order and distinctions reached its apex in the intro- duction to his religious manual, Derekh ha-Shem, where he deployed the ne- oclassical metaphor of the Italian garden to describe how intelligent human  action imposed order on nature: The advantage of having knowledge of things according to their subdivi- sions and the order of their relationships, as opposed to knowledge with- out distinctions, corresponds to the vision of a garden with well main- tained hedges, and adorned with narrow paths and lines of trees, com- pared with a bush of reeds or a wood that grows in a disordered manner.  For the intellect that desires to know, the representation of multiple parts  which ignores their relationships and proper position in the construction  of the whole is a tiresome and pleasureless operation.179  Kabbalah: A Science of the Knowable For Luzzatto, however, the parallels between Kabbalah and science are  not merely methodological. Just as physical science—and the sciences con- nected to it—establishes the laws governing natural events, the object of  Kabbalah is to know the causes of these events, which constitute the divine  direction (hanhagah) when united with the totality of physical and human  events. While physics attempts to describe the laws governing events that are  merely effects, Kabbalah states the laws presiding over physical and human  causal events. Yet, even though the origins of physics are human and those  of Kabbalah divine, both disciplines nevertheless seek to give an ordered,  precise, and exhaustive account of their object. Luzzatto’s descriptions of the  divine worlds sometimes appear to borrow from the terminology of physics:  223 </page> <page sequence="40"> Chapter 9 it is not a coincidence that he refers to the sefyroth as “forces” (koḥoth).  Indeed, the kabbalistic term ḥokhmah may be understood as meaning “sci- ence”: it is the supreme science, a meta-science (or “metaphysics”) which  goes beyond what other human sciences can do by establishing the connec- tions between the superior and the inferior worlds. Yet this ḥokhmah shares  the demonstrative rigor of the human sciences as well as their mechanistic  outlook and ambition to achieve total knowledge of their object.  Kabbalah touches on the “roots” of beings and the rules governing them.  On the one hand, it seeks to know the primary source of all beings, but on  the other it ignores the natural laws inscribed in the sefyroth, which are the  concern of human science.180  Luzzatto writes in a post-Cartesian context, at a time when mechanics are  the model for all the sciences and when all that is really left of the categories  of Aristotelian physics and metaphysics are terms largely stripped of their  meaning. The world of the sefyroth is a very ordered world, which Luzzatto  describes with the metaphor of a clock: it is built like a mechanism and its  elements are connected to each other and the inferior world like a series of  gears. Luzzatto is so bent on a mechanical model that he sees Man and the  material world as proto-robots covered with skin, or a material membrane  reverberating up to the divinity through their motions before returning down  to humankind.181 Human acts are at the origin of the motion of the totality  and depend on the soul, which is located in the body.  The following account may be read as a religious transposition of  Cartesian dualism, with the soul taking the place of Cartesian thought, and  the global mechanism put at the service of God and the final proclamation  of his unity. The various worlds are regulated by precise laws of operation  (ḥuqqym) and a system governing the interaction (‘arakhym) of different  forces182 in a dynamic combination responding to a unitary principle: The totality is a fabric of many forces coming from different orders, each  of which acts solely in its designated time and manner. This is called “the  diffusion of the forces” (hithpashtuth ha-koḥoth), that is, the diffusion of  the forces in different ways and according to different well-defined and  established rules. [...] This order is not dispersed and divided into parts  that do not report to a single principle; rather, there is one general order  governing the expansion of every force in the ways which pertain to it.  Everything is calibrated with an eye to a final direction.183 224 </page> <page sequence="41"> Kabbalah and Rationalism in the Works of Mosheh Ḥayyim Luzzatto and some Kabbalists of his time If the object of Kabbalah is to explain how this dynamic works both at  the time of creation (at the origin) and over the course of time (in history)  according to a unitary principle,184 then the kabbalist should give a de- tailed account of the existence and present and future behavior of all be- ings. In other words, although Kabbalah is a science of divine origin, its  object is the functioning of the worlds (hanhagah), which Man can—and  should—understand.  Creation has come about by divine design: in his extraction of limits— and renunciation of his infinity—God wanted to perform an act of mercy.  The final tiqqun, the moment of redemption when his unity will definitively  manifest itself, will come after a lengthy period when good and evil will be  intermixed beyond the grasp of human knowledge. Tiqqun demands human  intervention in a world that Man is able to know despite his limits. Thus  God operates not according to his capacities, but according to Man’s: God  wants Man to understand his ways, however limited that knowledge will  be. Humans live in a comprehensible world because God wishes it to be so,  subordinating his infinite action to the laws of causality and temporality.185 Human understanding cannot conceive of God’s essence, since, as  Maimonides stated, the only thing we can affirm is the necessary existence of  God. His actions, too, are thus only partly conceivable. Since everything— good and evil, imperfection and perfection—is created by God, humans do  not know what anything means for the divine will, i.e., in itself. Instead, what  we know and understand corresponds to our way of knowing:  That which is inside Him is unreachable for any intelligence; we can un- derstand only that which is within us creatures.”186  In other words, humans cannot know God’s works per se, only their effects.187  Strictly speaking, central notions such as emanation (shefa‘), potential, or ac- tion lie beyond our grasp: we cannot understand them from the agent’s point  of view, only from our perspective as recipients.188  Luzzatto’s gnoseology is a theory of the limits of knowledge (rather like  the philosophy of Kant), which nevertheless is optimistic about the possibil- ity of achieving knowledge within those limits. God wants us to achieve  knowledge according to our capabilities. The content of this knowledge  constitutes the object of the science of Kabbalah, and lies within the grasp  of Man despite its divine origins. In the age of redemption, things will not  225 </page> <page sequence="42"> Chapter 9 change fundamentally: our understanding of the divine remaining within the  limits of our abilities, we will grasp “a drop compared to the ocean.”189 The entire science of truth consists of this: distinguishing between the  forces God used to create the world, their intensity, their measure, and the  relationships between forces and created beings. In effect, we are capable  of knowing these forces only after they have been limited, and chosen be- tween all the others. God created the world according to a single intention  (kawwanah), and this intention implied limiting and ordering the forces  that He wanted to introduce, and establishing their order and relationsh- isps. Man can understand this, if this knowledge is given to him, because  it is not unlimited and does not lie beyond the abilities of the human  intellect. The totality of this order constitutes this science. And therefore  we assess the measure of those forces according to a hierarchy; we un- derstand how things exist in a reciprocal relationship, and how created  beings are connected together. It is essential to understand that everything  pertaining to created beings has its root in these forces, that everything  happens according to a hierarchy and an order, that all these beings are  connected one to another and oriented toward a single aim (kawwanah).190 It is the scientific character of Kabbalah that Luzzatto posits in these lines,  by linking it formally to physics on several levels. He fosters a mechanistic  vision by evoking “forces,” speaks of the human capacity to know this total- ity, and founds the successful operations of this knowledge on a methodo- logy based on order and distinctions. Venerated to this day in Orthodox Jewish circles and rediscovered by  a generation in search of a new spirituality, the young Paduan mystic who  never wrote a word in any language other than Hebrew straddled two worlds:  the old and ever-enduring world of kabbalistic thought and devotion and the  eighteenth-century world of rationalism, marked by the scientific method  and an optimistic understanding of human destiny. 226 </page> </plain_text>
