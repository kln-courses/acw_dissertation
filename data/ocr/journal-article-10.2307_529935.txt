Drennan Luis Gonzalo Jaramillo Elizabeth Ramos Carlos Augusto S nchez University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Maria Angela Ramirez Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg, Virginia Carlos A. Uribe Universidad de los Andes Bogotai, Colombia Recent research into settlement patterns in the Valle de la Plata, sw Colombia, has pro- vided information on the regional social context of the long-famous statues and tombs of the Alto Magdalena (the "San Agustin Culture"). The region witnessed the development, soon after the time of Christ, of a series of small-scale chiefdoms, each consisting of a few thousand people and centered on the elaborate burial place of its chiefs. These burial places themselves were not used residentially, but were each at the heart of a concentration ofpopulation. The correspondence between the locations of these settlement concentrations and the distribution of agricultural resources suggests control ofprime agricultural resources as an economic force in the development of these chiefdoms, although it remains to be seen how well this sugges- tion holds up to further and more complete analysis. As for otherpopular notions of chiefdom development, neither redistribution in diverse environments nor population pressure receives much support from the Valle de la Plata data. Regional settlement pattern study also clarifies the developmental sequence of which the period of statue carving (A. c. 1-850) is a part. Similar settlement concentrations in earlier times suggest precursors to these chiefdoms, and the failure of these concentrations to break up in later times is inconsistent with popular notions of broad social decline corresponding to the cessation of statue carving. Introduction At the headwaters of the Rio Magdalena in the Andes of sw Colombia lies the region known as the Alto Mag- dalena (FIG. 1). Its lowest elevations, at 600 m above sea level, consist primarily of broad natural alluvial terraces. Between 1000 and 3000 m, there are steep slopes with occasional patches of rolling to level terrain. Above 3000 m is the piramo, a cold, rainy, treeless zone of perpetually waterlogged soils. Many of the Alto Magdalena's soils are fertile, but there is much variability. Sedentary agricultural occupation began by perhaps 1000 B.C., which marks the beginning of the Formative period in the chronological scheme for San Agustin (Duque G6mez and Cubillos 1988: 101), but these earliest sedentary inhabitants are very poorly known archaeologically. The Alto Magdalena is particularly famous for the re- markable corpus of sculpture of the "San Agustin culture" (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1972). Among the hallmarks of these statues are grinning human faces with feline fangs, and sometimes other nonhuman features (FIG. 2). The human figures represented are often larger than life-size, usually male, and sometimes hold infants (FIG. 3). Some wield large clubs; some are only heads; and birds, snakes, lizards, crocodiles, frogs, and other animals also appear. Many figures are carved fully in the round with considerable detail; others are little more than faces and arms indicated in shallow relief on stones of natural columnar shape. Precise contextual information is available for only a few of the statues, the great majority having been found by looters, or so long ago that details of context (and</page><page sequence="2">298 Regional Dynamics of Chiefdoms, Colombia/Drennan et al. often even locality) are lost. It is nevertheless clear that they were characteristically associated with stone slab tombs in earthen barrows, and, indeed, many were incor- porated into the barrows (FIG. 4; Cubillos 1980: 47-48, Lnmina VII; Duque G6mez and Cubillos 1983: 44-45). At the core of such a barrow was the principal tomb chamber, as large as about 2 m x 4 m and 1.5 m high, with walls and roof of stone slabs (Duque G6mez and Cubillos 1979: 27, 62-63; 1983: 61, 77). Offerings in the tomb chambers were quite modest compared to their architectural and sculptural elaboration. Most common were ceramic vessels, but a fairly rich tomb might have only a half-dozen vessels or fewer. Gold ornaments, com- mon in prehispanic burials in many parts of Colombia, occurred only rarely (Duque G6mez 1964: 35-214). Such special attention to the burials of certain individuals in- dicates a degree of social hierarchy that we find convenient to label a chiefdom.' Ceramic chronology, supported by radiocarbon dates, (Sotomayor and Uribe 1987: 14-16; Duque G6mez and Cubillos 1988: 106-113; Drennan et al. 1990) points to the period between about A.c. I and A.C. 600 or 700 as the time when the production of statues, tombs, and bar- rows was at its peak. This span includes the latter part of the Formative and the Regional Classic period in the San Agustin region. The most comprehensive catalog of sculp- ture for the Alto Magdalena (Sotomayor and Uribe 1987) lists over 500 pieces. These statues, however, were dis- persed widely across the region in small groups at several dozen localities. The largest number of these localities (and several of the ones with the largest number of statues) were probably within about 10 km of the modern town of San Agustin (FIG. 5). Nevertheless, sites with complexes consisting of one or more barrows and a half-dozen or so statues occur from one end of the Alto Magdalena to the other. After about A.c. 800 there was a shift in the character of funerary architecture. Tombs with very narrow vertical shafts, sometimes several meters deep, and small side chambers became quite common. Modest quantities of offerings, such as ceramic vessels, grinding stones, and celts, were included. While no known example constitutes 0 500 km EN Z U ELA Alto Magdalena e COLOMBIA ECUADORr PERU AMAZON BRAZ IL Figure 1. Map of Colombia showing the Alto Magdalena (cf. FIG. 5). such elaborate burial as the earlier barrows and statues represented, more people now were evidently distin- guished enough from the general population to merit special funerary treatment. The shaft and chamber tombs often occurred in and around residences (Duque G6mez 1964: 235, 238; Duque G6mez and Cubillos 1981; Dren- nan 1985: 127-129). The one exception to this pattern was a highly localized and distinctive pattern of funerary architecture at Tierradentro at the northern extreme of the Alto Magdalena (near Inzai in FIG. 5). Here subterranean chambers up to 8 m across and 2.5 m high, reached by spiral stairways carved in the soft bedrock, contained sec- ondary urn burials of sometimes dozens of individuals (Chaves Mendoza and Puerta Restrepo 1986). The rela- tionship between this phenomenon and developments elsewhere in the Alto Magdalena is unclear. The apparent cessation of statue carving and barrow building in this late period, however, has often been interpreted as a cultural "decline." Even the disappearance of the people who pro- duced these works during the Regional Classic has been postulated (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1965: 86). The Alto Magdalena, then, presents a sequence of social change spanning some 2500 years from the beginnings of sedentary agricultural life to the arrival of the Spanish 1. Since the word "chiefdom" means so many things to different people let us emphasize that we use it here simply as a convenient label for societies with complex hierarchical patterns of organization but with- out the bureaucratic political institutions of the state. We are willing to include in the class all manner of variety as to particular ways in which hierarchical societies may be organized, and, indeed, we see a great deal of such variety when we look at chiefdoms of different regions and periods (cf. Drennan and Uribe 1987: x-xii). By using the word, we mean to indicate nothing more than the approximate level of complexity of the societies we discuss.</page><page sequence="3">Journal ofField Archaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 299 NOW gi Rol MA o", "pr v M' A All ...... . .... .

This sequence includes the development of substantial social inequality through a period of centuries and, later, a possible waning of such complex patterns of social organization. Since 1984 the Proyecto Arqueol6- gico Valle de la Plata, a collaborative undertaking of the University of Pittsburgh and the Universidad de los Andes (Bogota), has taken one part of the Alto Magdalena as a laboratory in which to investigate more fully the nature of this sequence of social change and the reasons for it. We made systematic large-scale survey the focal point of our first stage of research since there were no previous regional settlement studies to provide a regional social context for the information already available. Our initial focus on collecting regional survey data in the Valle de la Plata was also motivated by our broader concern with contributing to a better understanding of social process in chiefdoms generally. One of the impor- tant social phenomena to be observed in chiefdoms is the development of patterns of organization that transcend the single local group and integrate the population resid- ing throughout a sometimes substantial region into a sin- gle functioning society. Chiefdoms, then, are in their es- sence regional in character (cf. Carneiro 1981; Drennan 1987; Earle 1987: 288-289, 1989: 84). Attempts to un- derstand the organization of archaeologically known chief- doms must, as a consequence, depend heavily on infor- mation that is equally regional in scope-that is, the kind of data collected through large-scale systematic regional survey. Nevertheless, only a few of the world's archaeo- logically known chiefdoms are so documented, and these are mainly the ones that occurred as relatively brief stages preceding the emergence of much larger and more com- plex societies in the famous areas of "pristine civilization." Conducting regional survey in the Alto Magdalena was thus a particularly appealing undertaking because of the general paucity of regional information for long-term se- quences of social change within the chiefdom framework. The Valle de la Plata Figure 5 shows the Valle de la Plata study area in the Alto Magdalena. It consists of the drainage of the Rio La Plata and its two principal tributaries, the Rio Loro and the Rio Aguacatal (or Bed6n). Towards the downstream end it also includes the lower course of the Rio P~ez after</page><page sequence="6">302 Regional Dynamics of Chiefdoms, Colombia/Drennan et al.

The Valle de la Plata lies between the two portions of the Alto Magdalena most noted for their funerary mon- uments, San Agustin and Tierradentro (Inzai), and it in- corporates the full range of environmental variation to be found in the Alto Magdalena. The lowest elevations (between about 600 and 1000 m amsl) include the modern towns of Itaibe, Paicol, and Tesalia (FIG. 6). This is a hot, dry zone with extensive, flat, natural river terraces that are today very productive for grazing cattle and cultivating irrigated rice. The factors that make this land productive today, however, did not apply in prehispanic times since neither the cattle, the rice, the irrigation pumps, nor the machinery necessary to cul- tivate the extremely hard soils was available. Cultivation with prehispanic technology would have been possible, but of limited potential. Even if the hard soils were la- boriously cultivated by hand, they are of relatively low fertility. Only very restricted areas on the lowest terraces closest to the river would have been attractive to prehis-</page><page sequence="7">Journal ofFieldArchaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 303 Nataga 'Itaibe Tesalia &amp; 1 Saicola L i- 100 rn ArLa Plata LAGU NA- SAN RAFAEL Rio Salado 0 aaq PURACE 1 0 PAN DE, c o Villa Lozadav SAZUCAR Rio Aguacatal alle g Santa Leti i- Merenberg C),0001e La Argentin-a K B3el~n10K (Relief data incomplete) -- E enns.

Upstream from the modern town of La Plata (FIG. 6) the valley narrows substantially. Although the soils are more fertile, easier to cultivate, and better watered, the slopes are very steep. This sharply limits the possibilities for agricultural production on a substantial scale along the upper Rio La Plata or along the lower reaches of the Rios Loro and Aguacatal (Botero, Le6n, and Moreno 1989). Between about 1500 and 2000 m amsl is a zone where available moisture is quite good for agriculture (Botero 1985; Rangel and Espejo 1989). Although there are nu- merous deep canyons and steep slopes, there are also patches with less sharp relief and locally very fertile soils. These patches provide the best opportunity in the Valle de la Plata for sustaining dense populations of farmers (Botero, Le6n, and Moreno 1989). They occur in the vicinities of the modern towns of La Argentina, El Pensil, and Belkn, and below Santa Leticia (FIG. 6). Modern populations have tended to concentrate in these pockets, where today the major cash crop is coffee, but a wide variety of food crops, such as manioc, maize, beans, and many fruits, is also grown. Agricultural possibilities again diminish above 2000 m as a consequence of increasingly cold and humid condi- tions. High precipitation and low evapotranspiration re- sult in extremely waterlogged soils (Botero, Le6n, and Moreno 1989; Rangel and Espejo 1989). Today, even cold-tolerant crops such as potatoes are not much culti- vated above 2500 m in this region. Pollen studies encompassing the entire Valle de la Plata seek to delineate the general patterns of environmental change during the 2500-year sequence of sedentary hu- man occupation that we are studying (Herrera 1989a). Six pollen profiles have been analyzed (Espejo and Rangel 1989; Herrera 1989b; Herrera and Pifieros 1989; Pifieros 1989). To summarize the conclusions of these studies very briefly, the environment of the Valle de la Plata between approximately 1000 B.c. and A.C. 1 was colder and wetter than it is today. After A.C. 1 temperature rose until by 850 the Valle de la Plata was warmer than it is now, while humidity at first declined towards modern levels (until about A.C. 550), then increased again. Finally, between</page><page sequence="8">304 Regional Dynamics of Chiefdoms, Colombia/Drennan et al. A.c. 850 and 1500 temperature and humidity both de- creased until essentially modern conditions were estab- lished (Drennan, Herrera, and Pifieros 1989). Survey Methodology Our aim in regional survey was to provide complete and systematic coverage of the region surveyed and to make the results of the survey as comparable as possible to those from similar surveys of other regions (cf., for example, Sanders, Parsons, and Santley 1979; Blanton et al. 1982; Kowalewski et al. 1989). The environmental conditions of the Valle de la Plata, however, make it im- possible to conduct regional survey exactly according to methodologies that have been developed for drier, com- pletely cleared, and extensively cultivated regions. Two factors in particular created conditions that required es- tablishment of a set of procedures unique to this region. The first of these factors was vegetation. While culti- vation is widespread in the Valle de la Plata, plowing is common only in the lower valley for large-scale rice grow- ing. Farms and cultivated fields (except in the case of coffee) are usually small, and more cleared land is devoted to cattle pasture than to any other single use. In addition, at elevations above 2000 m there are sizeable zones of uncleared forest. These conditions, of course, present a considerable obstacle to making surface collections of ar- tifacts. This obstacle was, however, not as difficult to over- come as we had initially expected. Despite the lack of plowing, cultivated fields provided excellent surface collecting conditions. This was generally true even of coffee fields, which can be almost impene- trable at times. The processes of planting and continual weeding and tending of the bushes produce enough soil disturbance to bring artifactual material continually to the surface. Even cattle pastures, which seem at first to have their entire surfaces obscured by dense grass cover, provide substantial possibilities for scattered surface collection in the form of drainage ditches, trails, corrals, eroded gullies, etc. We found that careful attention to such spots consis- tently produces artifacts if they are present at all. Thus surface collecting was a very productive survey tactic, al- though it consisted of focusing heavily on scattered, prom- ising spots, rather than of systematically sweeping back and forth across the terrain. There remained, nevertheless, some unacceptably large areas where no adequate opportunities to make surface collections presented themselves. In such areas we exca- vated shovel probes as a substitute for surface collecting. These probes were approximately 40 cm square and 40 cm deep. We recorded no stratigraphic information; we simply examined the dirt carefully for artifacts. Survey crews did not carry screens because the clayey nature and high moisture content of most soils in the Valle de la Plata make it almost impossible to force them through screens small enough to be useful. Our own initial experiments with shovel probes in sites where we also conducted stratigraphic excavations showed them to be a reliable means of identifying locations with prehispanic artifacts (Drennan 1985: 137-143). Experi- ence in five years of survey following those experiments confirmed this judgment. Approximately 1200 of the sites recorded during those five years had surface features (usu- ally small terraces for house construction, known locally as tambos) that would have caused us to identify them as archaeological sites whether we found artifacts or not. In only about a half dozen instances were we unable to find artifacts either by careful surface examination or by shovel probes. Almost all these instances occurred close together in one section of the survey area where the tambos were either in fact natural features, as artificial as they appeared to us, or their occupation was so short-term and ephemeral that resulting artifact densities were extremely low. In any event, this happened so rarely that the question of exactly why it did happen in these few instances is simply not important enough to justify the research effort that would be required to answer it. (If one knows how to win at some game 1194 times out of 1200, one's time is better spent in playing the game than in trying to figure out why one loses the other six contests.) This is not the place for extended methodological dis- cussion of shovel probes, but our experience leads us not to share Shott's (1989) reservations about them but in- stead Nance and Ball's (1989) recognition of the ways in which they can be useful. As Lightfoot (1989: 413) ob- serves, shovel probes are "the most effective method cur- rently available for discovering buried cultural remains on a regional scale," at least when vegetation precludes surface collection. The combination of surface examination and collection where possible, then, and excavation of shovel probes where necessary, proved to be a rapid and reliable way to determine the locations of prehispanic artifactual remains and to recover small samples of them from dif- ferent localities. The incorporation of shovel probes into our survey methodology made it possible to produce more complete and reliable information about settlement distri- butions over a larger area than would otherwise have been possible. The second special survey difficulty in the Valle de la Plata was topography: there are very few stretches of uninterrupted level or even rolling terrain. One is seldom more than 200 or 300 m from an extremely steep slope. This is true as well in the areas of gentler relief at middle</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 305 elevations mentioned above, because even these areas are broken into small patches along hills and ridges separated by very deeply incised streams. The result is that it is impossible for survey crews to spread themselves out and systematically sweep back and forth across a survey tract in the regular geometric patterns that are practical to em- ploy in regional survey in flatter terrain. Our survey crews of three or four persons, then, adapted their routes of travel to the topography, generally working along ridge lines and canyon bottoms and attempting to do as little climbing up and down as possible while still accomplish- ing a complete examination of the landscape. The difficulty of moving about in the Valle de la Plata's sharp relief, however, was partially compensated for by the fact that the topography governed distribution of set- tlement to some extent. Many canyon bottoms and their steeply sloping sides simply do not provide a site for constructing even a single small house. When the prehis- panic occupants of the Valle de la Plata did live on steep slopes, they, like the modern inhabitants, constructed ter- races, on which their houses were located. These tambos were built in all periods of occupation and persisted in easily recognizable form for thousands of years. They are extremely common on slopes of 100 to 15' or greater and often occur even on slopes of 5' or less. The topographical characteristics of much of the Valle de la Plata, therefore, are such that in some areas human habitation could not have occurred while in other areas its remains are rather obvious. Both of these topographic effects are advanta- geous to large-scale regional survey. In summary, then, our survey procedures consisted of systematic, complete examination of the landscape by teams of three or four members who moved back and forth across defined areas as practical in terms of topo- graphic conditions. These teams examined level and slop- ing terrain for surface artifacts, dug shovel probes wher- ever surface conditions did not permit collecting, and examined very steeply sloping terrain for evidence of tam- bos. The severe relief in most of the valley clearly indicates the most likely habitation areas and shovel probes, when they were necessary, were located in those areas. Our rule for working in areas of sharp relief was never to go more than 100 m without a clear indication of whether artifactual material was present or not, and col- lections or shovel probes were often carried out at closer intervals. In the large level areas of the lower valley, where topographic clues to the location of habitation areas were less available, the maximum interval was shortened to 50 m. All artifacts recovered from shovel probes and surface collections were returned to the laboratory. Surface col- lections were opportunistic rather than systematic because variation in surface conditions was so dramatic that any absolute differences in observed quantities of material would be meaningless. The area from which a single sur- face collection came was never more than 1 ha in size, and it was almost always substantially less. Most sites produced several separate "lots" of artifacts because they encompas- sed several surface collection or shovel probe locations. Approximate site boundaries and all shovel probes and surface collections were located on aerial photographs at a scale of approximately 1:8000. These data were later rectified and transferred to topographic maps produced by the Instituto Geogrifico Agustin Codazzi (Bogoti). Areas of prehispanic occupation were defined on the basis of classification of the sherds in the laboratory. Site bound- aries were redefined into boundaries of occupied areas for each period depending on which of the various collections pertaining to each site contained material dating to that period. Initial Results The Valle de la Plata study area totals some 2200 sq km. It is not our intention to survey this entire area. To date we have surveyed over 500 sq km, including all environmental zones up to the apparent upper altitudinal limits of prehispanic habitation. The areas surveyed are shown in Figure 7 as they were divided up for practical purposes over five years of fieldwork. The discussion that follows concerns a portion of this surveyed area for which the survey data have already been analyzed. It includes the survey tracts labeled CS, GJ, LA, 87, 84, ER, and MR in Figure 7. Four of these tracts were surveyed and analyzed as thesis projects by four of the authors of this article (Jaramillo 1985; Shinchez 1986; Ramirez 1988; and Ra- mos 1988). The seven tracts together form a single con- tiguous area totaling 187 sq km lying primarily in the middle elevations of the valley. It is this area that is shown in the settlement pattern maps (FIGS. 8-10). Some of the most promising parts of the valley for prehispanic agri- culturists are included, especially along the northern edge of this analyzed survey area. Toward the south and east are much steeper slopes and the crest of the Serranfa de las Minas at elevations up to 2400 m. This part of the zone is much less productive agriculturally and could be expected to be less attractive for prehispanic settlement. Although in what follows we make a few remarks based on the very sketchy analysis of results of other parts of the survey currently available, the bulk of what we have to say is based on this area of 187 sq km-about one third of the area we have so far surveyed. Within this area are several zones of unsurveyed forest. We chose not to survey these zones even though the methodology we employed</page><page sequence="10">306 Regional Dynamics of Chiefdoms, Colombia/Drennan et al. TS LP VK AR 87 M R M R BE RG GJ LA84 10 Km S 87 LA Figure 7. Regional survey tracts in the Valle de la Plata. makes it possible to do so. This choice was made on the basis of where our time and energy could be spent so as to have the largest return in information. To penetrate a large zone of uncut forest, excavate numerous shovel probes, and establish their locations on aerial photographs is an arduous and time-consuming task. When such zones were completely surrounded by environmentally similar zones that were easier to survey (because the forest had been cut) and contained only very sparse occupation, we decided the investment of time and energy necessary to survey the uncleared areas would simply not likely be repaid in useful information. Such zones are shown as unsurveyed forest in the survey maps. Since no chronology existed for the Valle de la Plata prior to our work, we have had to establish the temporal basis for the analysis of the survey data as we went along. The chronology with which we are currently working contains only three periods for the entire sequence of perhaps as much as 2500 years of prehispanic occupation. It is based on the excavation of stratigraphic test pits at a dozen different sites in the valley, some half-dozen radio- carbon dates, and stylistic links to described ceramics for San Agustin (Drennan 1985; Drennan et al. 1990). Stra- tigraphic excavations at four more sites and more detailed analysis of the ceramics from earlier excavations during the 1989 field season are currently making possible the subdivision of some periods so that more precise chron- ological control will be available in the future, but the results presented in this article are based on the three- period chronology. For now we are referring to these periods simply as Early, Middle, and Late, since they rep- resent only a provisional chronology. The Early Period (1000 B.C.-A.C. 1) The oldest reliable radiocarbon date among the few we have for the Valle de la Plata is 425 b.c. + 90 years (PITT- 0164, uncalibrated). Radiocarbon dates for settled occu- pants in the San Agustin region reach back as far as 800 b.c. (Duque G6mez and Cubillos 1988: 104), and the Formative period there, to which our Early period ap- proximately corresponds, has been assigned a beginning date of 1000 B.C. It is this earliest part of the sequence for which the greatest amount of further clarification is forthcoming from fieldwork conducted in 1989 and, we hope, from radiocarbon samples not yet processed. For the moment, we define the Early period as roughly the millennium before Christ and contrast it as a whole with what comes later, leaving discussion of its internal dynam- ics for the future. Regional survey in the Valle de la Plata has not pro- duced evidence of any inhabitants earlier than this period, although the survey was clearly not designed to detect ephemeral and short-term occupations of highly mobile hunter-gatherers. If there was any earlier sedentary agri- cultural occupation, however, it must have been very small indeed. Survey has confirmed that, at least by the end of the Early period, human habitation had reached all parts of the Valle de la Plata. The distribution of this Early</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 307 population, however, was far from homogeneous. In par- ticular, although some Early materials do occur in the lower elevations outside the zone for which most detailed information is currently available (toward the east in FIGS. 6, 7), their frequencies are extremely low. Even within the area illustrated in Figure 8, settlement distribution is far from homogeneous. The 187 sq km surveyed include a total of 5.94 sq km of area occupied during the Early period, or 3.2% of the total area (TABLE i). Inspection of Figure 8, however, reveals a concentra- tion of settlement in the north-central portion of the area that corresponds roughly to the survey tract labeled 84 in Figure 7. In this tract, Early occupation covers 7.1% of the total area while in the neighboring ER, MR, and 87 tracts only between 1.4 and 1.8% of the total area was occupied in the Early period. It is surely no coincidence that this settlement concentration is located in a patch of very fertile soils and relatively gentle relief between 1550 and 1800 m amsl, where conditions today are very favor- able for the application of simple agricultural technology. This would also have been an especially favorable zone during the colder and wetter conditions of the Early pe- riod. This concentration of settlement, therefore, makes good basic environmental sense in that it is situated amid some of the best agricultural resources of the Valle de la Plata. It is worth noting, however, that there are other similarly favorable patches of agricultural land that do not show settlement concentrations during the Early period. Along the sw boundary of the survey zone in Figure 8 another settlement concentration can be observed. Much of this concentration falls within survey tract CS (FIG. 7), where 8.8% of the surface area shows evidence of Early period occupation. It is clearly separated from the first concentration by areas of lower density occupation (even allowing for the fact that these areas include some tracts of unsurveyed forest). This settlement concentration, however, is not so easy to understand in simply environ- mental terms. Much of it sits astride the summit of the Serrania de las Minas, at altitudes between 2000 and 2200 m amsl, where today the climate is cold and wet enough Figure 8.

When we remember that climatic conditions were even colder and wetter during the Early period, the presence of a concentration of settlement in this zone is even less understandable environmentally. There are numerous lo- calities in the area surveyed that would seem to present much higher agricultural potential than this one but which were only sparsely occupied during the Early period. It is possible that this settlement concentration has some economic rationale not yet apparent at this early and fairly impressionistic stage of analysis or that will require sub- stantial site excavation for its identification. It may also be productive to consider political and social factors affecting such concentrations and their locations. Additional Early period occupation occurs in the more recently surveyed zone Nw of the area included in Figure 8, but analysis of it has only begun. It will be interesting to see whether this pattern of distinct concentrations extends to that area as well and, if it does, in what kind of situations the concentrations are located. The Middle Period (A.c. 1-850) The transition from the Early to the Middle period is marked in the Valle de la Plata by strong population growth in the 187 sq km area completely analyzed to date. This fact is easy to observe simply by comparing Figure 9 with Figure 8. The total area of occupation has doubled, to 12.17 sq km or 6.5% of the surveyed area, and the total quantity of Middle period materials recovered, to- gether with their higher densities in the sites where they occur (see below) suggest a population several times greater than that of the Early period. Outside the zone illustrated in Figure 9, the lower elevations of the valley (to the east in FIGS. 6, 7) continue to have very small populations, although there has also been increase here over Early period population levels. Likewise, Nw of the area in Figure 9, Middle period populations are much larger than those of the Early period, reaching densities that seem comparable to those seen in Figure 9. As was the case in the Early period, we see two clear</page><page sequence="13">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 309 LATE PERIOD SETTLEMENT Jr , .. 1, " Unsurveyed Forest + + + + C) 0 + q? + ++ +- ' ' , + d V4 + + lip". ..+ Re 0 , . ~+ + 0 + + D? + + ? .' " .. .,.,...~ ? ?+ ? ) +5 K f eC o idp ++ e 4P .I ??'' 6,r I' Figure 10. Settlement distribution in a portion of the Valle de la Plata during the Late period. population concentrations on the settlement map (FIG. 9). One is in the north-central portion of the area, in the same location as the first of the two Early period settlement concentrations, corresponding roughly to survey tract 84. As Table 1 shows, 17.2% of the total surface area of survey tract 84 shows evidence of Middle period occupation. This occupation density is some six times higher than that of the neighboring tracts ER, MR, and 87. A concentration of settlement in this location makes apparently very good environmental sense, just as it did in the Early period. The second settlement concentration of the Middle pe- riod does not correspond in location to the second Early period concentration. It is farther north, along the west- central fringes of the area mapped, in survey tract GJ, which shows more dramatic increase between Early and Middle period areas of occupation than any other tract. Middle period occupation covers 19.4% of the total sur- face in tract GJ, which, like tract 84, where settlement concentrations are observed in both Early and Middle periods, presents very favorable conditions for simple ag- ricultural technology. The elevation is between 1500 and 1800 m amsl, moisture conditions are good, soils are fertile, and there are many fields with fairly gentle relief. The second settlement concentration of the Early pe- riod, meanwhile, dissipated. Total occupied area did grow in survey tract CS, where this concentration was located, as it did in all survey tracts, but nowhere was this growth as slow as it was in tract CS. The result was that tract CS was surpassed substantially in settlement concentration by both tract 84 and tract GJ. In a general sense, the demographic increase seen for the Middle period corresponds with climatic changes oc- curring simultaneously. The warmer and drier conditions of the Middle period would certainly have expanded the most favorable agricultural zones of the valley, making possible the cultivation of a greater variety of crops up to higher elevations than before. Pollen analysis (summarized in Drennan, Herrera, and Pifieros 1989) demonstrates the presence of a number of cultivars: maize, potato, sweet potato, quinoa, beans, coca, manioc, and Anonaceae (a</page><page sequence="14">310 Regional Dynamics of Chiefdoms, Colombia/Drennan et al. family that includes a number of fruits today known as the an6n, the chirimoya, the guantbana, and others). The Middle period pollen rain also reflects considerable forest cutting, probably to open larger areas to cultivation. Nevertheless, large areas of uncut forest remained, sug- gesting that regional population levels had not reached a point that required the exploitation of the region's re- sources to their maximum limits. Despite such general complementarity between the na- ture of environmental change and the evidence of rapid regional population growth, it is impossible to explain the distribution of population within the region, and espe- cially changes in this distribution since the Early period, as a simple response to new environmental conditions. One can imagine a small initial agricultural population in the Valle de la Plata, as is evidenced for the Early period. With climatic improvement and growth in the number of inhabitants, this population would tend to disperse itself more and more to exploit an ever-broadening resource zone, including not only areas recently made more desir- able for agriculture by climatic improvements, but also less favorable zones, the farming of which had not been necessary previously to satisfy the needs of the smaller earlier population. In particular, the increased temperature and decreased precipitation of the Middle period would lead us to expect an expansion of population toward the summit of the Serrania de las Minas (between 2000 and 2400 m amsl). The regional survey, however, does not reveal a popu- lation growing and spreading itself out more and more, especially toward the higher parts of the region, but rather a population concentrating more and more densely in some of the more favorable parts of the middle elevations of the valley. Population distribution, then, is not at all what we would expect on the basis of simple environmen- tal considerations, and tends to direct our attention more toward social and political factors. In addition to the settlement distribution, Figure 9 also indicates the locations of two small groups of sites that provide evidence of a very special set of activities-activ- ities that were apparently not conducted in other parts of the region. This evidence consists of monumental sculp- ture and barrows up to 1.5 m high containing stone slab tombs. Both sites have been extensively looted, so it is not easy to reconstruct their features. Some of the statues from these sites are illustrated by Sotomayor and Uribe (1987: 220-224). They clearly belong, on both icono- graphic and stylistic grounds, to the well-known sculptural efflorescence of the Alto Magdalena described at the be- ginning of this article (FIGS. 2-4). The association between statues and elaborate stone slab tombs in barrows also fits the San Agustin pattern. Each of these two sites apparently once consisted of some four to eight principal tombs with perhaps as many as a dozen statues over 1 m high and other smaller sculptures. The exact spatial relationships between the remains of the tombs and the statues cannot be defined because the statues have been removed from the sites, but the majority of the statues in the small community museum of La Argentina, for example, come from one of these sites. Although there are also statues in the town for which no location of discovery can be identified, these two sites are the only groupings of such sculptural monuments and barrows that can be documented for the survey area illus- trated in Figure 9. These two sites are each located in the heart of one of the two settlement concentrations that formed in the Middle period. Survey results, as well as stratigraphic excavations, confirm that the sites with stat- ues and tombs also pertain to the Middle period, the time when the same sculptural manifestation was at its peak near San Agustin (Sotomayor and Uribe 1987; Duque G6mez and Cubillos 1988: 101). Artifact densities are quite low in the areas of the barrows themselves, although such sites are surrounded by areas of very high artifact density. It is clear that these sites were very special spots, almost certainly ritual areas, utilized for the burial of very important individuals, among other activities. Despite their locations in the hearts of sizeable population con- centrations, these locations were not, themselves, of resi- dential use. It seems to us that these two special sites mark the centers (in both ritual and demographic senses) of two chiefdoms (still using the word "chiefdom" in a very loose sense [see note 1]). We suppose that the principal indi- viduals once interred in the barrows were the chiefs them- selves, and that they once lived near their eventual burial places. The concentration of settlement around these cen- ters represents the regional demographic concentration that accompanied the development of these two small chiefdoms. The spatial separation of the two centers and their respective settlement concentrations suggests that these two social units were independent of each other and that a certain competition might well have existed between them. We still do not know, however, whether we should speak in terms of two contemporaneous chiefdoms or not, because the Middle period includes sufficient time for the development and decline of one to be followed by a similar cycle in the other. Preliminary indications are that similar patterns extend into the surveyed area to the Nw of that indicated in Figure 9 as well, including other centers and settlement concentrations of the Middle period, but full documen-</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 311 Table 1.

The Late Period (A.c. 850-1530) The Late period apparently represents continued demo- graphic growth in the section of the Valle de la Plata shown in Figure 10, but this growth is not nearly so dramatic as that between the Early and Middle periods. The total occupied area increased from 12.17 to 13.11 sq km (TABLE i). Until analysis is completed it will not be certain whether even this modest suggestion of growth can be extended to other parts of the area surveyed. The population of the lowest elevations (to the east in FIG. 7) may have grown substantially in some areas but seems not to have done so in others. These lower zones, in any event, apparently continued to contribute relatively little to the demographic total for the valley. In the area analyzed to date, the settlement concentra- tion in the north-central sector, present since the Early period, continued to exist, and even intensified, during the Late period (FIG. o0). Some 29% of the total area occupied in the entire analyzed section was in survey tract 84, a higher fraction than in any earlier period. There was also growth in tract MR as the settlement concentration began to spill over the boundaries of tract 84. The second concentration of the Middle period dispersed, and the total area occupied in tract GJ (where the second Middle period concentration had been located) decreased substan- tially. There are other areas where population for the Late period declined as well, most notably along the summit of the Serrania de las Minas in tract 87. Although the climate of the first part of the Late period was quite similar to that of the Middle period, after A.C. 1250 both temperature and precipitation began to decline toward present levels. Population decrease in the highest part of the zone (above, say, 2000 m amsl-precisely the pattern noted above) would make sense as a response to such environmental changes, but neither the dissolution of the settlement concentration in survey tract GJ nor the intensification of the one in tract 84 is made any more comprehensible by taking cooler and drier conditions into account. As was the case during the Middle period, there was a site of the Late period that suggests itself as a central place for the settlement concentration in the north-central part of the analyzed area. This site, Barranquilla (VP002), in- cludes among its remains a combination of sculptural and funerary monuments that recall the Middle period. These two kinds of monuments, however, are both rather dif- ferent in character from their antecedents. The tombs are not barrows with stone slab chambers but deep narrow shafts with small side chambers for burial near the bottom, like those described at the beginning of this article for other parts of the Alto Magdalena in this Late, or Recent, period. One was excavated intact as part of our program of stratigraphic testing at the site (Drennan 1985: 127- 129) and at least five others had been looted prior to our work. The sculpture from the site is also very different from Middle period sculpture. There are no statues but, instead, an area of bedrock exposed by erosion in the stream that flows past the northern edge of the site was sculpted to form a series of artificial pools and channels in the manner of the famous Fuente de Lavapatas at San Agustin (Perez de Barradas 1943; Sotomayor and Uribe 1987: 88). We cannot at present say whether this center and the corresponding settlement concentration persisted until the time of the Spanish Conquest. Early historical sources for the region do not speak persuasively either of large pop- ulation concentrations or of very powerful chiefs. One post-Conquest radiocarbon date has been reported for Recent materials in the San Agustin zone (Llanos Vargas 1988: 13) that are equivalent to Late period ones in the Valle de la Plata, but this is only one date and even the persistence of the ceramic types up to the Conquest would not necessarily indicate the continuation of this demo- graphic pattern. This is one issue that we hope further</page><page sequence="16">312 Regional Dynamics of Chiefdoms, Colombia/Drennan et al. chronological analysis currently under way may help to resolve. Demographic Issues Up to now we have implicitly taken occupied area as a proxy for population, and made remarks about population changes rather loosely. We find this a reasonable procedure to follow at this relatively early stage in the analysis of the results of several years of survey fieldwork. One of the issues around which further analysis will revolve, however, concerns more precise approaches to population figures, and we wish to make a start on such efforts here. We have been willing to assume, for present purposes, that occu- pied area (that is, the actual residential area of settlements as indicated by archaeologically recoverable distributions of residential debris) is proportional to population for a given period. It is useful to make this assumption to quickly identify some of the patterns our data suggest so that we can be more alert in further analysis to those aspects of the information that are especially relevant to confirming, correcting, or rejecting the patterns we have begun to note. Before concluding this part of the article we wish to give attention to some of those other aspects and to take some initial steps in the direction of addressing demography in absolute rather than strictly relative terms. First, we have not yet considered the density of artifac- tual materials. The fundamental assumption underlying population reconstructions based on regional survey is, of course, that certain rates of refuse deposition on the land- scape have remained relatively constant for the region and period studied. Like others discussing demography on the basis of regional survey, we are acting on this assumption with all of the advantages and consequent risks that it implies. As is customary, the most useful kind of refuse on which to focus is broken pottery, and it is really the area of distribution of sherds of a particular period that we have taken as our principal indicator of population for that period. There are several factors that can disturb the re- lationship between population and area of distribution of sherds. One that strikes us as potentially important in the Valle de la Plata (and in most regional surveys) is that a given population in a densely packed settlement is likely to leave more densely packed refuse (i.e., sherds) in a smaller area and thus appear to be a smaller population if we pay attention only to occupied areas. For this reason, it has become customary also to try to factor density of sherds into population estimates from regional survey. As noted above, variations in densities of sherds pro- duced by surface collections in the Valle de la Plata reflect primarily widely differing modern surface conditions. Our shovel probes, however, provide an excellent basis for dealing with densities of sherds in a systematic way, since they tell us exactly how many sherds of each period are obtained from a constant volume of soil in different lo- calities and thus how sherd densities vary from place to place and from period to period. This enables us to eval- uate the comparisons we have made between survey tracts and periods (TABLE 1) to see whether they are simply the results of changes in residential densities within settle- ments rather than changes in regional populations and their distributions. We do find some differences in densities of sherds be- tween survey tracts, and we intend to continue to inves- tigate these differences. None of them, however, is of such a character or magnitude as to require extensive modifi- cation of the demographic comparisons we have made here on the basis of occupied area. Densities of Middle and Late materials in shovel probes are almost identical (means of 7.5 and 7.4 sherds per shovel probe, respec- tively), so there is no density correction to be made in our previous conclusions concerning relative demography in these two periods. Shovel probes that produced Early sherds, however, yielded a mean of only 4.8 per probe. This leads us to believe that we may have overstated Early population relative to Middle and Late population (or understated Middle and Late population relative to Early population, which is the same thing). Thus the marked population growth that we noted between Early and Mid- dle times was probably even more marked than we at first thought. A second factor affecting even relative demographic conclusions is the lengths of the periods into which the chronology is divided. The greater quantity of sherds de- posited by a population during a longer period may be reflected in higher densities of sherds within sites, or in a larger areal distribution of those sherds (through the in- creased time available for shifting about of dwellings), or both. The provisional chronology in terms of which this article is framed corresponds to the broader regional chro- nology, but it does have very long periods, a subject to which we will return below. It begins with a period per- haps 1000 years in length, follows with a period of some 850 years, and ends with one of about 680 years. This progressive shortening of periods should make us empha- size even more strongly the appearance of population growth throughout the sequence, especially between the Early and Middle periods, since a sequence of progres- sively shorter periods would tend to minimize just such an appearance in either occupied area or density of sherds. The varying length of periods should not, of course, have</page><page sequence="17">Journal ofFieldArchaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 313 much direct impact on comparisons from one survey tract to another within the same period. Up to now we have couched our discussion of popu- lation entirely in relative terms, avoiding estimates of ab- solute numbers. Such estimates are clearly the least certain part of making demographic reconstructions. It is neces- sary, however, for some purposes to attempt to estimate absolute figures. Probably the most important of these purposes is to facilitate comparisons with other regions. There are as yet no ethnohistorical studies for the Valle de la Plata that would enable us to relate archaeological data to historically-derived population estimates. Likewise there is no body of data from site excavations that is large enough to make possible the detailed reconstruction of overall, internal spatial organization of settlements and relate this to survey results so as to form a basis for absolute population estimates. Both survey results and site excavations in the vicinities of San Agustin and Tierraden- tro, however, (e.g., Duque G6mez and Cubillos 1981; Llanos Vargas and Durin de G6mez 1983; Llanos Vargas 1988; Chaves Mendoza and Puerta Restrepo 1988) sug- gest relatively dispersed residences within occupied areas. The prehispanic settlements of Mesoamerica that are most similar to such a pattern have 5-10 inhabitants per oc- cupied ha (Drennan 1988), a figure that has often been used in the interpretation of results from regional survey (e.g., Sanders, Parsons, and Santley 1979: 34-40). If we apply this figure uncritically to the data from the Valle de la Plata, the 187 sq km of surveyed area analyzed and discussed here (FIG. o0) would have had a population of 6500 to 13,000 in the Late period. If the settlement concentration in the north-central portion of the area were a circle approximately 5 km in diameter, about half the population of the 187 sq km area resided in that settlement concentration, an area less than 20 sq km. Such figures are, of course, very approximate, but we consider them conservative. One of our reasons is that there are many sites less than 1 ha in size that have undoubtedly failed to make a sufficient contribution to these population guesses. This is because we have simply applied the 5-10 people/ ha figure to the total occupied area rather than attempting reasonable population reconstructions on a site-by-site ba- sis. For example, a site of0.3 ha contributes 1.5-3 persons to the total population estimate. Nevertheless such a site probably represents a single isolated household. Although we do not know what prehispanic family structure was like in the Valle de la Plata, 1.5 to 3 people is a very low estimate for a household. As noted previously, population size in the Middle pe- riod seems quite similar to that of the Late period for the 187 sq km area. Of the estimated 6000 to 12,000 inhab- itants overall, some 2000-4000 were in the north-central settlement concentration and perhaps 1000-2000 in the west-central one (although this latter concentration prob- ably continues westward outside the area in FIG. 9). Simple application of the same figure to the Early period occupied area would result in a population estimate of 3000-6000 inhabitants in the 187 sq km area. Given the lower densities of Early period sherds, however, and the longer duration of the period, it seems reasonable to re- duce this estimate to between, say, 1500 and 3000. Conclusion In concluding, we will summarize some of the social implications of the sequence we have reconstructed using the initial results from about one-third of the area of regional survey that was conducted in the Valle de la Plata. In the process we will indicate questions that this recon- struction raises for future research. An initial sedentary population, establishing itself throughout the Valle de la Plata by perhaps 1000 B.c., showed clear tendencies toward concentration of settle- ment in certain parts of the region towards the time of Christ. One of the two concentrations documented here offered its occupants prime agricultural resources, but the other seems not to have been as favorable in this respect as were a number of other more sparsely occupied portions of the valley. Very strong population growth is seen shortly after the time of Christ. The earlier settlement concentration with the better agricultural resources grew and intensified while the other dispersed. A new concentration, also in a prime agricultural zone, was formed. Both Middle period settle- ment concentrations contained an apparent central place of at least ritual character, marked archaeologically by bar- rows and statues for the burials of chiefs or other impor- tant people. It seems likely that these important people lived in the same settlement concentration near the loca- tions where they were eventually buried, although this remains to be documented. The Middle period is evidently one of increasingly com- plex and hierarchical forms of social organization. We have suggested that each of the settlement concentrations rep- resents a chiefdom consisting of a few thousand people. Their spatial separation leads us to think of them as in- dependent of each other. We have very little other infor- mation bearing on the nature of their relationships. One possibility is that they were not even entirely contempor- aneous within the Middle period. It is clear at the regional level that population was attracted toward the putative chiefly centers, but we do</page><page sequence="18">314 Regional Dynamics of Chiefdoms, Colombia/Drennan et al. not know the nature of this attraction. It is possible that some economic advantage accrued to those who chose to settle near the center, but it is also possible that some element of coercion, of forced population concentration, was involved (cf. Drennan 1987: 313-315). Although no such centers can be identified for the Early period, and although there are no indications as clear as the Middle period tombs of marked status differences in the Early period, the tendency toward settlement concentration al- ready existed. This makes us wonder whether the Middle period represents entirely new patterns of organization or intensification of preexisting patterns. Among the fundamental issues in the processes of chief- dom development are questions about the nature of the economic bases of chiefdoms and of social control by elites (cf. summary discussion by Earle 1987: 291-300). It has often been suggested that elaborate economic arrange- ments, including but not necessarily limited to redistri- bution, for exploiting a variety of resources in a diverse environment play a pivotal role in the development of complex societies (e.g., Service 1975; Sanders and Web- ster 1978; Isbell 1978). The applicability of such notions to northern South America has often been suggested, par- ticularly in the form of "vertical control" of a series of altitudinal zones (cf. CQirdenas 1988 for a recent example), and the Alto Magdalena has specifically been included under this rubric by Duque-G6mez (1967: 296) and Rei- chel-Dolmatoff (1972: 14, 1982: 70-71, 73-74). The apparently very low population densities through all pe- riods in the Valle de la Plata's higher and lower elevations (largely outside the zone discussed in detail in this article) enable us to make the preliminary suggestion, however, that spreading out through a diversity of environmental zones to exploit a wide range of resources was not an important economic dynamic in this region. The tendency for population to concentrate in prime agricultural zones, on the other hand, suggests that agri- cultural productivity was a more important environmental variable than diversity. It is possible to hypothesize, on the basis of the location of the Middle period settlement concentrations in particularly favorable agricultural set- tings, that the greater agricultural potential of certain parts of the region enabled emergent chiefs to gain some degree of social power based on true control of basic resources. Such a dynamic for chiefdom development has also been advanced (cf. Earle 1987: 294-297), and some recent discussion has focused around it (as among Drennan, Earle, Feinman, Gilman, and Steponaitis, reported by Earle [1989: 86]). It is also possible, of course, that the location of settlement concentrations on more fertile soils might simply reflect the greater ease of sustaining denser population groupings there. Clarifying this issue will cer- tainly be among the objectives of much more detailed and complete analysis of the relationship between environ- mental variables and settlement distribution in the Valle de la Plata. The pollen evidence cited above does not suggest that population levels had created any serious pressure on re- sources in the Valle de la Plata by the Middle period. Our initial results, then, do not tend to support the idea that population pressure provided an important stimulus to- ward the development of more complex patterns of or- ganization (cf. Spooner 1972 for just a few applications of this thesis). More information on this topic will also result from the further analysis of the relations between population and resource distribution. After A.C. 850 population grew only slightly. One of the Middle period settlement concentrations dispersed, while the other (the one that had been present since the Early period) intensified still further. Both apparent chiefly centers of the Middle period were abandoned. Although a new apparent center emerged in the settlement concen- tration that remained, its elite functions were expressed in a manner very different from those of the Middle period. We would like to know whether this indicates a funda- mental change in principles of organization or only a change in the way in which the same principles were expressed. The fact that regional demographic parameters changed so little from Middle to Late periods (a similar number of inhabitants was concentrated somewhat more densely into one settlement concentration), contradicts the notion of social decline in the Alto Magdalena at this time. Indeed, even slightly larger scale and more central- ized sociopolitical organization is suggested, despite the absence of the archaeologically obvious tombs and statues of earlier times. Finally, we wonder what societies of the Valle de la Plata were like at the time of the Spanish Conquest. We cannot document at present whether Late period patterns of organization persisted until 1530 or vanished before that time. If the latter, it is interesting to ask what led to the change. The conclusions we have sketched out, of course, re- main tentative because they are based on very initial and partial results. Their further testing and the additional questions they raise are the subject of the complete analysis of the survey data currently under way. This analysis in- volves not only the addition of the data from the other two-thirds of the area not represented in the maps that accompany this article but also a much more detailed study of the relationship between settlement distribution and a series of environmental variables so as to provide more</page><page sequence="19">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 18, 1991 315 concrete conclusions than the impressionistic statements we are able to make here about such relationships. The current analysis also involves the establishment of greater chronological precision, which will enable us to reconstruct more precisely the nature of changes through the sequence and answer better the questions raised by the reconstruction. We continue to insist to critics, as we have done previously, that there are interesting things to be learned from this sequence as it stands now, even based on very long periods, and we hope we have shown that in this article. It would be a mistake to defer all consid- eration of the social, political, and economic implications of our results until such time as the chronology has "suf- ficient" precision for such purposes. For one thing, with- out trying to see how far we can get with the chronological precision currently available, it is impossible to address the question of how much chronological precision is, or eventually will be, required. We also recognize that many of the questions whose answers we seek cannot be answered fully with regional survey data alone. Consequently, even as we analyze the survey results in more detail, we are making plans for a second stage of research in the Valle de la Plata that will concentrate on substantial site excavation to delineate pat- terns of organization on a scale and at a level of detail not accessible to regional survey.
