Preuss, H. Beyer and others; and one is therefore led to believe that the necklaces found along with the braziers, necklaces displaying carved ivory monkeys, were an element of priestly adornment. Certain other figures that appear on the braziers clearly represent Quetzalcoatl. Wearing the charac teristic ehecailacacozcatl (wind jewel) and necklaces with five and seven shells or precious stones (symbolic numerical groupings found also on Quezalcoatl's headdress as depicted in the códices), these images are bearded and their faces are painted half in black and half in yellow to symbolize the deity's relation to evening and dawn. Ceremonial vessels with représentations of the Plumed Serpent are further evidence of the worship of Quetzalcoatl in this zone, as also are the many dishes with designs that, in my opinion, are those of cross-sectioned conch shells, which as symbols of fertility and birth may well be related to Quetzalcoatl in his role as the creator of human life. Xolotl, the twin brother of Quetzalcoatl, was iden tified with the dog Xolo-Itzcuintli that carried the soûls of the dead across the underworld river Chicna huapan to their final resting place. Xolo-Itzcuintli was generally depicted as being endowed with Xolotl's head, and therefore it is logical to assume that the brazier lid in the form of a panting Itzcuintli, ex hausted by the difficult journey to Mictlan (Place of the Dead), is a représentation of Xolotl, who un doubtedly was also worshiped here. The top portion of another brazier, ail that remains of this particular piece, has the relief heads of Ome tecuhtli and Omecíhuatl (The Lord and Lady of Duality), who as the primal creator deities are shown with the fertility symbol of the cross-sectioned conch shell.
