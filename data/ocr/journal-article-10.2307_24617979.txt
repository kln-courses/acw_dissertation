<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Journal of Musicology 2 ■ 1993 Jânos Kârpâti (Budapest) Amaterasu and Demeter: About a Japanese - Greek Mythological Analogy Summary: Our discussion focuses on two analogous mythic personalities: the Japanese sun-goddess, Amaterasu, and the Greek corn-goddess, Demeter. Parallel examination of both myths and their related rituals reveals a process of identical structure in which different peoples realize the cycles of the solar year and agriculture. In order to influence these cycles, they create rites in which primitive magic, shamanism, and more developed human communica tion, i.e. chant, music, and dance, are superimposed upon one another. A lack of historical documentation on the music in both myths, especially the Deme ter, is addressed. Several specialists of Japanese mythology have turned our attention to the fact that some myths or mythologems have similarities with certain elements of Greek mythology.1 The most striking of these is the story of Izanagi and Izanami, the world creator brother and sister and married couple. The female deity, after having given birth to numerous deities, dies after bearing the fire deity. The male deity visits the land of the dead, then, in order to bring her back to life. This "Orphic" action fails, however, because he breaks the taboo of looking at the spouse, so he has to flee. If Japan were not separated by the sea and an entire continent from the land of Hellas, it could forthwith be accepted that the Japanese mythological tradi tion, first written down in 712 in the Japanese chronicle Kojiki, preserves ele ments in a natural way from the thinking of an earlier, highly developed society. Given the status of mythic study during the last century, scholars were extremely enthusiastic with the discovery of similarities between different mythologies. By following the methodology of comparative linguistics, they started to draw a beautiful picture about a seemingly logical system of migra tion and interaction of mythic traditions.2 Then, the ethnological and anthro pological trends of mythic study emerged and, although they neglected the 1 Nobuhiro Matsumoto, Recherches sur quelques thèmes de la mythologie japonaise.

Our discussion will focus exclusively on two analo gous mythic personalities, the Japanese goddess Amaterasu and the Greek goddess Demeter. Our primary goal is to examine and emphasize as much as possible, by means of a significant parallelism based on a particularly im portant meaning, the mythic judgement and the role of music. Amaterasu (or Ama-terasu-o-mi-kami, i.e. "Heaven-Illuminating great Dei ty")4 was born directly from her father, Izanagi, when the latter, turning back from the world of the dead and purifying himself from its pollution, washed his left eye. Let us add that at the same time "when he washed his right eye, there came into existence a deity named Tsuku-yomi-no-mikoto" (the Moon Deity) and "when he washed his nose, there came into existence a deity named Susa-noo-no-mikoto (Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Deity)".5 In the Japanese mythological tradition, Amaterasu is the sun-deity since the word terasu means shine or illuminate, and has an exceptionally important place. She is the ancestor of the imperial family, and her mission entrusted by her father, Izanagi, is to rule over The Plain of High Heaven (Takama-no-hara). At the same time, her brother Susa-noo has been entrusted to rule the ocean which is, in all probability, the reason for his jealousy and their constant quarrelling. In any case, it is an outrage committed by Susa-noo against Amaterasu that in duces the sun-goddess to hide herself in a cave. This is a key episode of the Amaterasu myth-cycle and, at the same time, of the entire Japanese mythol ogy, so it deserves to be quoted from Kojiki word-by-word. "... Amaterasu, seeing this, was afraid, and opening the heavenly rock-cave door, went in and shut herself inside. Then Takama-no-hara was completely dark, and the Central Land of the Reed Plains (Ashi-hara-no-naka-tsu-kuni) was entirely dark. Because of this, Edward Tylor, Primitive Culture.

For citing names of deities and other mythological persons, we do not use the long versions and complicated transcription of archaic Jap anese employed in the most reliable English translation of Kojiki, compiled by Donald L.

When she conceals her self in the cave, constant darkness and night reign over the world - this is equivalent to the destruction of nature, pestilence, illness, and death. By this momentum we can discover an important analogy to the Greek deity, Deme ter. Although she is not the deity of sun but of corn fields and crops, a seem ingly lower status in the pantheon, her power proves to be very strong at the moment when her brother Hades insults her by abduction of her daughter Core. "But golden-haired Demeter sat there apart from all blessed gods and stayed, wasting with yearning for her deep-bosomed daughter. Then she caused a most dreadful and cruel year for mankind over the all-nourishing earth: the ground would not make the seed sprout, for rich-crowned Demeter kept it hid. In the fields the oxen drew many a curved plough in vain, and much white barley was cast upon the land without avail. So she would have de stroyed the whole race of man with cruel famine and have robbed them who dwell on Olympus of their glorious right of gifts and sacrifices, had not Zeus perceived and marked this in his heart."7 There is no doubt that the insult and mourning of the corn field goddess has a similarly harmful effect upon the world as does the concealing of the sun goddess. The question is raised, however, regarding the identification of De meter's mourning with Amaterasu's actual disappearance, since myths use tangible objects and pictures, and do not speak in abstract categories. Yet, the mythologem of disappearance in a cave turns up even in Greek mythology, but from sources other than the Homeric Hymns. According to Pausanias, Deme ter, being informed about the abduction of her daughter, dressed in black and withdrew into a cave of Mount Elaion.8 There is, however, another aspect of this mythologem, namely that the Demeter myth is intertwined inseparably with the Core-Persephone myth, so the "cave motif" is supported by Core's abduction scene. 6 Kojiki Book One, Chapter 17:1-3, p.81. 7 Homeric Hymns II: To Demeter, translated by H.G.

According to Donald L. Philippi, who pub lished the most recent, critically supported translation of Kojiki, the seclusion of the sun-goddess might symbolize death, since in the Manyoshu, the great collection of poems compiled between the IVth and VTOth centuries, the words "shut oneself inside the rock-doors" mean "to die and be concealed within the rocky tomb".9 Thus, the same mythologem, which is personified in Japanese tradition solely in Amaterasu, is embodied in Greek tradition in two different persons - the Mother, great deity who has absolute power over the world, and the Maid, the dying and recrudescing deity, who represents the cyclic recurrence of na ture, the annual decay of winter, and the resurrection of spring. It is only at the recapitulation of these analogous myths that we arrive at the point of disappearance (death) and realization of its grave consequences. These consequences - darkness, barrenness, decline - afflict gods and human beings alike, yet the gods are those in both myths who spare no effort to solve the universal crisis. Let us first observe the Japanese version: Then the eight-hundred myriad deities assembled in a divine assembly in the river-bed of the Ame-no-yasu-no-kapa ... They gathered together the long-crying birds of Toko-yo and caused them to cry ... They sought the smith Ama-tsu-mara and commissioned Ishi kori-dome-no-mikoto to make mirror. They commissioned Tama-no-ya-no-mikoto to make long strings of myriad maga-tama beads. They summoned Ame-no-ko-yane-no-mikoto and Puto-tama-no-mikoto to remove the whole shoulder-bone of a male deer of the mountain Ame-no-kagu-yama, and take heavenly papaka wood from the mountain Ame-no-kagu-ya ma, and [with these] perform a divination. They uprooted by very roots the flourishing ma sakaki trees of the mountain Ame-no-kagu-yama; to the upper branches they affixed long strings of myriad maga-tama beads; in the middle branches they hung a large-dimensioned mirror; in the lower branches they suspended white nikite cloth and blue nikite cloth. These various objects were held in his hands by Puto-tama-no-mikoto as solemn offerings, and Ame-no-ko-yane-no-mikoto intoned a solemn liturgy. Ame-no-ta-jikara-wo stood con cealed beside the door, while Ame-no-uzume-no-mikoto bound up her sleeves with a cord of heavenly pi-kage vine, tied around her head a head-band of the heavenly ma-saki vine, bound together bundles of sasa leaves to hold her hands, and overturning a bucket before the heavenly rock-cave door, stamped resoundingly upon it. Then she became divinely possessed, exposed her breasts, and pushed her skirt-band down to her genitals. Then Takama-no-hara shook as the eight-hundred myriad deities laughed at once. Then Ama terasu-o-mi-kami, thinking this strange, opened a crack in the heavenly rock-cave door, and said from within: 'Because I have shut myself in, I thought that Takama-no-hara would be dark, and that the Central Land of the Reed Plains would be completely dark. But why is it that Ame-no-uzume sings and dances, and all the eight-hundred myriad deities laugh?' Then Ame-no-uzume said: 'We rejoice and dance because there is here a deity superior to 9 Philippi Kojiki p.81.</page><page sequence="5">International Journal of Musicology 2 ■ 1993 13 you.' While she was saying this, Ame-no-ko-yane and Puto-tama brought out the mirror and showed it to Ama-terasu. Then Ama-terasu, thinking this more and more strange, gradually came out of the door and approached [the mirror]. Then the hidden Ame-no-ta jikara-wo took her hand and pulled her out. Immediately Puto-tama extended a shiri-kume rope behind her, and said: 'You may go back no further than this!' When Ama-terasu-o-mi kami came forth, Takama-no-hara and the Central Land of the Reed Plains of themselves became light."10 Now let us quote the Greek myth, how the Homeric Hymn describes Deme ter's appeasement and Persephone's return. "First he sent golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter, lovely in form ... 'Demeter, father Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, calls you to come join the tribes of the eternal gods: come therefore, and let not the message I bring from Zeus pass unobeyed.' Thus said Iris imploring her. But Demeter's heart was not moved. Then again the father sent forth all blessed and eternal gods besides: and they came, one after the other, and kept calling her and offering many very beautiful gifts and whatever rights she might be pleased to choose among the deathless gods. Yet no one was able to persuade her mind and will, so wrath was she in her heart; but stubbornly rejected all their words: for she vowed that she would never set foot on fragrant Olympus nor let fruit spring out of the ground, until she beheld with her eyes her own fairfaced daughter."11 1 hus Zeus is compelled to ask Hades to send back the daughter to her mo ther. Hades does not resist, knowing well that Persephone has already eaten from the pomegranate of the nether world, which means that her return to life is just temporary and she must pass a third of the year with him. Looking at both myths in parallel and in their entirety, we can formulate our questions in a clearer way: 1. What does the mythologem of darkness mean? 2. In what way has the normal state of the world been restored? 3. What are the factors determining that the analogy of the two myths repre sents more than a simple coincidence? Max Mueller and his followers, the partisans of the solar mythology, have gathered much data from different world mythologies about the fight of light and darkness, and about its interpretations. Among these is the view that the Japanese Amaterasu myth represents unequivocally a solar eclipse.12 The eclipse and similar unusual phenomena obviously have great effect upon the people living in close relationship with nature, increasing their superstitious fear. In this case, however, we can state with almost absolute certainty that it 10 Philippi Kojiki Book One, Chapter 17:4-24, pp.82-85. 11 See n.7, pp.311-313. 12 Obayashi, Taryo.

The ceremony, which is worked out in meticulous detail and which, according to Kojiki, is con ducted in order to entice the sun-goddess out, does not seem to be a single or infrequent action, but is much more a practice that was known and used long before. This is proved mainly by such magical elements as making the cocks cry, an artificial reproduction of the dawn, or using the mirror for producing artificial sunshine. For the rice-growing Japanese people, who knew the agricultural cycles well, the winter solstice - the shortest day of the year - could have been that dramatic moment when there was a fear of the disappearance of the sun, when it might be imagined that the sun died or - at least - withdrew into a cave. If Amaterasu's concealment had been considered to be the death of the sun, it was understood from the very first moment that this was only a temporary death. That is why the related rite was not a funeral, but a reanimating, revital izing ceremony. There seems to be no need to emphasize the agricultural connotations of the Greek myth, since in Demeter's person and actions these are represented ex plicitly. It has to be mentioned, in turn, that the figures of mother and daughter are so closely intertwined that the daughter's death represents unequivocally the winter period of the agricultural cycle. If the mother is the goddess of the corn fields and of the entire agricultural activity, the daughter is nothing else but the seed that disappears for a while into the earth, then springs up. This is evidenced by the divine judgement according to which Core - as Persephone - must stay a third of the year in Hades. Greek agriculture counted the seasons not in four, but in three periods, so it was logical that the winter third was the period of Core's disappearance, i.e. her temporary death. The above quotations from Kojiki and the Homeric Hymn give us clear in formation on the kind of actions that have been carried out by the deities in order to restore the original status, i.e. daylight and the life-assuring harvest. This question requires more in-depth examination because the executors (persons), instruments (objects), and circumstances (environment) of the ac tion offer important lessons not only regarding the myth itself, but also its gen esis and social function. It has already been mentioned that a highly elaborate ceremony lies hidden in the Japanese myth. In the ceremony, described only in a shortened version, magic elements apparently prevail. There is a stratum in the ceremony that re fers unequivocally to another belief and practice: the so-called shamanism. When Ame-no-uzume dances and goes into a holy trance on the top of an up turned barrel, she is not simply one of the deities carrying out the magical procedure, but is endowed with spiritual, divine capacities of a higher order. In comparison with magical practices, this shamanism represents a higher</page><page sequence="7">International Journal of Musicology 2 • 1993 15 cultural level. That is, while the magic can be carried out by anyone having the suitable instruments and knowledge of the spell, the shamanistic activity requires a person with a particular capability who can arrive at the state of di vine possession. The Japanese sources, supported by exegetic and historical literature, pro vide unanimous evidence that in archaic Japanese religion (an early form of Shinto) an important role was played by shamans and, mainly, shamanesses. According to court tradition, the function of the principal priestess (an im portant person of the imperial court ceremonies) can be traced back within the Sarume clan to the figure of Ame-no-uzume. It was the divine possession, the state of trance, that made possible the invocation of spirits of defunct an cestors and, consequently, the divination. When the presence of shamanesses became inadmissible during a later development of the ritual in court, the so called miko or mikanko stepped into their place, where we find priestesses and sacred dancers at the same time. The folk tradition, however, preserved the practice of medium-type shamanesses to the present day, mainly in Okinawa island and in Northern Honshu, called Tsugaru Region.13 In Ame-no-uzume's action for enticing the sun-goddess from her hiding place, it is not only the divine possession, the kamu-gakari that plays an im portant function, but also two other elements: the exhibition and the dance. As far as the exhibition is concerned, the first famous exegets of Kojiki, Motoori Morinaga, followed a rather doubtful trace, considering it as a consequence of the trance, i.e. as if Ame-no-uzume had arrived at an obscene exhibition of her body by the cessation of self-control.14 Donald L. Philippi gives utterance to a more modern view, quoting Matsumura Takeo's words according to which such exhibition appears in religious rites of various peoples, not only to drive away undesirable influences, but also to amuse, to entertain, and impart vitali ty to the deities.15 One-and-a-half decades earlier, the great French orientalist, Charles Haguenauer, gives more than one explanation to the exhibition of Ame-no-uzume's dance. He also refers to data concerning the effects of exorcism by exhibition of the female body in various folk traditions. He supplements them, then, with his own view. He says that the exhibition is a fertility magic as well as a kind of provocation to break taboos, but it is also a means to relax tension. The latter is well proved by the boisterous laughter of deities in the quoted mythical scene.16 13 Hori Ichiro, "Shamanism in Japan", Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 1974, No.4. 14 Motoori Norinaga Zenshu, Tokyo, 1926-28. 15 Philippi Kojiki p.84. 16 Charles Haguenauer, "La danse rituelle dans la cérémonie du Chinkonsai", Journal Asiatique 1930. avril-juin.</page><page sequence="8">16 International Journal of Musicology 2 ■ 1993 We cannot accept the idea of fertility magic, however, since the second great Japanese chronicle, the Nihongi, written down only eight years after Ko jiki, also describes the same scene in such a decent form that fertility magic is absolutely out of the question. More acceptable is Haguenauer's and Matsu mura's common view about the provocative attitude. We must insist on this notion, despite the plausibility of the agricultural element. The most important stratum in Ame-no-uzume's action, however, is the dance. The dance is an organic part of the shamanic activity, to which a mon otonous percussion accompaniment belongs evidently. It is well known that the drum is an essential instrument of the Siberian shamans, and in Japan the music bow, the azusa yumi, is used in shamanistic practice together with rhythmically rattled beads called yuzu. The text of Kojiki, as a matter of fact, does not say explicitly that Ame-no uzume danced. It only says: "overturning a bucket before the heavenly rock cave door, stamped resoundingly upon it". According to one version of the Nihongi, in the same scene the goddess "took in her hand a spear wreathed with Eulalia grass, and standing before the door of the Rock-cave of Heaven, skilfully performed a mimic dance".17 More unequivocal is the next paragraph of the Kojiki, when the sun-goddess, still in the cave, asks: "why is it that Ame-no-uzume sings and dances?" Philippi remarks that at this point in the text there is an ideograph which, according to archaic Japanese, reads asobi or uta-mapi, with the meaning "singing and dancing" resp. "song and dance".18 There is yet another phrase referring to "singing", which appears in every version of the myth. The first English translation of the Kojiki, made by the famous Basil Hall Chamberlain, puts "His Augustness Heavenly-Beckoning Ancestor-Lord [Ame-no-ko-yane] reciting grand liturgies",19 while Philippi, as quoted already, "intoned a solemn liturgy". Since there is the ideograph of norito at this point in the text, it certainly does not mean "singing", but "reci ting", since it still exists in the practice of Shinto prayers. The norito of today is recited by the priest (kannushi) or by the community in a raised voice which, from a musical point of view, is simpler than an ornamented ritual cantillation (e.g. Buddhist shomyo). In any case it is at a higher level than the pure prose. To sum up, we have seen that myth gives a precise and detailed description of the preparation of a rite (the gathering and fabrication of the used objects) 17 Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from Earliest Times to A.D. 697.

In: Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan, Suppl. to vol. X, 1882.</page><page sequence="9">International Journal of Musicology 2 ■ 1993 17 and its full process. In our analysis, we have tried to show that various reli gious concepts and cultural strata are superposed on each other - from the primitive magic, through a higher-level shamanism, to a relatively developed religious practice in which words, music, and dance are used to communicate with deities. Furthermore, in the sources of the myth it is clearly expressed that in the divine society of the High Heavenly Plains the deities are not equal in rank; the sun-goddess is of a higher rank than those who carry on the rite, but even among them there are important persons and simple assistants. In this refined articulation of the anthropomorphic divine society, the human society is also reflected, and, at the same time, the relation of man and god. According to Haguenauer and Matsumura, two great authorities of Japanese mythology, the rite described in Kojiki seems almost identical to the chinkon sai ceremony of that age in which the priestesses of the Sarume clan played an important role. The ceremony of chinkon-sai was conducted to appease the spirit ready to leave the body (tama shizume), or for holding it back, and in connection with all this it was considered a rite of revitalization or assurance of longevity. No one deserved to be the object of the chinkon, however; first, it was conducted between the sixth and twenty-third day of the 11th lunar month (15-31 December), definitely in favor of reviving the weakening sun; then, it became an imperial privilege since the emperor, according to mytho logical tradition, was regarded as a direct descendent of the sun-goddess. Thus, the primitive magical agrarian-ritual was transformed into a subtle court-ceremony, changing the all-important shamanistic dance into a "holy dance" par excellence. This accounts for the fact that Japanese tradition traces back to this myth every kind of Shinto ceremony coupled with dance and mu sic, i.e. each type of kagura and, somewhat more indirectly, the Noh theatre as well. Let us examine the Greek myth similarly. In the quoted passage of the Ho meric Demeter-Hymn we became acquainted with the action initiated by Zeus for Demeter's reconciliation. This takes place obviously on a divine level, and, although the presents sent to Demeter correspond to a human type of offering, the most important moment is a bargain concluded between Zeus and Hades. In the Homeric Hymn there is, however, a passage in which Demeter herself teaches the people of Eleusis how to obtain reconciliation. "But now, let all the people build me a great temple and an altar below it and beneath the city and its sheer wall upon a rising hillock above Callichorus. And I myself will teach my rites, that hereafter you may reverently perform them and so win the favour of my heart."20 20 See n.7, p.309.</page><page sequence="10">18 International Journal of Musicology 2 • 1993 Then, later, at the end of the hymn: "Then she went, and to the kings who deal justice, Triptolemus and Diocles, the horse driver, and to doughty Eumolpus and Celeus, leader of the people, she showed the conduct of her rites and taught them all her mysteries, to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also, awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice. Happy is he among men upon earth who has seen these mysteries; but he who is uninitiate and who has no part in them, never has lot of like good things once he is dead, down in the darkness and gloom."21 The Eleusinian Mystery that is connected to Demeter's personality is one of the most important and, at the same time, discussed traditions of the antique culture. Here, we shall deal only with those elements that show a certain anal ogy with the Japanese myth and the related rite. The question of the Eleusinian Mystery has concerned the ethnologie-an thropologie trend of mythology particularly, since certain elements, still liv ing, have been discovered mainly in cultures of Balcanique, but other living peoples as well. One important moment of the secret ritual was the scene in which Demeter's ecstasy excited priestesses who, on the internal premises of the shrine, re-enacted the goddess' sexual intercourse with Iasios symbolically. An episode of the Demeter myth describes how the goddess, falling in love with Iasios, at the wedding of Kadmos and Harmonia, escaped from the house and made love with him on the ploughed field. A long series of examples has been cited by Frazer in order to prove the magical influence of fertility.22 It was Matsumura who drew the attention to a striking analogy between Ame no-uzume's exhibition (her obscene dance is mentioned earlier) and the episode of Iambe and Baubo in Demeter's myth.23 When Demeter arrived at Eleusis in search of her daughter, king Keleos and his wife Metaneira gave her a warm reception, and she offered to remain in their house as a nurse of their new born child, Demophoon. It was then that Keleos' servant-maid Iambe tried to cheer up the inconsolable guest by telling her piquant stories. In the Or phicorum Fragmenta we can find a more detailed description of how Demeter was consoled in Eleusis: in Keleos' court the goddess, arriving incognito, was welcomed by Baubo with kind hospitality, and was offered a barley drink. She refused it, because she did not want to stop her fast. Then Baubo sat down with her feet wide apart in front of her, and pulling up her skirt, exposed her deformed lower parts; and, behold, the child Iakkhos laughed out from Baubo's womb. Thereupon the goddess also laughed and accepted the drink. 21 See n.7, p.323. 22 James George Frazer, The Golden Bough. London, 1911. 23 Matsumura op.cit., n.l. above, III. pp.91-107.</page><page sequence="11">International Journal of Musicology 2 • 1993 19 Iakkhos was the name of the divine child of the Eleusinian Mysteries to whom a panegyric was sung on the sixth day with a torchlight procession in front of Demeter's temple.24 As we have seen, even Japanese scholars were extremely attentive to the motif of exhibition and obscenity which, as common traits, link distant cul tures to each other. As far as the divine boisterous laughter is concerned, the hypothetical explanation of the Japanese source can be enriched by another hypothesis on the basis of Greek mythology. The Hungarian classical philol ogist Imre Trencsényi-Waldapfel, analyzing the folkloristic connection to the "creating laughter", quotes E. Fehrle, who stated that the mythologem of the divine laughter represents the active "joy of life", which is able to break the force of death and to create new life.25 More important from our point of view is that the myth of Demeter is a typ ical agrarian myth, mainly in its structure, with dying and recrudescing deity, and with a related, precisely elaborated ritual. Myth and rite condense various religious concepts and cultural strata - as was the case of the Japanese myth - beginning from primitive magic, through a ritual drama, until communication with deities was achieved by means of music and dance. The aetiological myth of Eleusinian Mysteries, according to the Homeric Hymn, shows the priority of the rite, as was the case with Amaterasu's myth. The magical concept of its creation is implied by the fact that the rites for in creasing the fertility of the land are mixed, mainly through the figure of Iak khos, with dionysian content. Also the dramatic moment of the rite indicates a similarly magical concept in so far as Demeter's wedding and rambles are an attempt to influence the crops on the basis of imitating magic. A considerable role is given to sacrificed objects, secret spells, and to the dance and music that accompanied the entire mystery. The so-called Eleusinian Mystery was not confined exclusively to the town of Eleusis, since similar ceremonies were conducted in other towns, also with names "Eleusinia" or "Thesmophoria". Eleusis remained, however, the princi pal place of these mystic ceremonies, and the main priests were chosen from Eleusinian families. Such a ritualist was, for instance, the hierophantes, whose office was to show off the sacred objects stored in secret cases, and his duty was at the same time to direct the chanting of traditional hymns: 24 Orphicorum Fragmenta (Kern) 52.

According to Appollodoros, the Eleusi nian priest in Athen strikes the so called ekheion (gong), when Core is invoked."26 Karl Kerényi, sharing Wilamowitz's view, believes, in turn, that among the musical factors the dance was the most important: "... the dresmosyne, founded by Demeter - the first of the three constituents of the mys teries (dresmosyne or dromenon, the "action", legomenon, the "word" and deiknymenon, the "showed object") - was not a kind of play ... The mythologem of Core's abduction was known in more than one version. If anyone of them had been represented simply as a pan tomime, there would not have been anything mysterious in it. The Eleusinian secret was not then revealed when Core's abduction was narrated, but with its Eleusinian re-enacting, the dance was performed ... Perhaps, the movement of Eleusinian celebrators might have been similar to the most ancient dances of the tragedian chorus, but by no means to the tragedy itself."27 We can try, now, to answer our first question as to why this Japanese and Greek mythological analogy is more than a simple coincidence. It has to be emphasized again that we do not want to prove the existence of any kind of causal relation, but only that such an analogy, after a systematic analysis, could help effect a deeper understanding of myths and their function. Parallel examination of both myths shows a process of basically identical structure. Different peoples realize the cycles of the solar year and of agriculture. In or der to influence these cycles, they create rites in which primitive magic, sha manism, and more developed human communication, i.e. chant, music, and dance, are superimposed upon one another. The rites are incorporated into a social hierarchy, the cultivation of which becomes a privilege of specialists (priests) as part of a broader religious system. In the sacred and secret cere 26 Scholion to Theokritos, 2, 35. 27 "... Die von Demeter eingeführte dresmosyne, die erste von den drei Komponenten der Mysterien-Begehung - dromena, legomena, deiknymena, Handlung, Gesagtes und Gezeigtes - kein Bühnenspiel war. ... Das Mythologem von Koreraub war in ver schiedenen Variationen bekannt: hätte man es einfach 'pantomimisch' vorgetragen, so wäre daran gar nichts Geheimnisvolles gewesen. Das elusinische Geheimnis wurde nicht verraten, wenn man den Koreraub erzählte, sondern wenn man die eleusinische Weise der Vergegenwärtigung: die eleusinische Tanzweise profanisierte ... Darf man den eine 'mimische Darstellung' nennen? Allerdings nur eine sehr stilisierte, die vil leicht an die allerältesten Tänze des tragischen Chors erinnerte, aber keineswegs an die Tragödie."

About the dance and music of Demeter's and Core's mystery, we have only indirect information; we have no idea how it might have been in reality. In the case of Amaterasu's cult, there is quite another situation. The traditional Japa nese culture, aside from some written documents from the Heian Era (794 1185), is preserved in the living practice of Shinto court ceremonies. Some dances and songs may give approximate information on the real forms of early rites, but traces of the historical tradition are bifurcated. By following one branch, we can become familiar with a formal and defined ceremonial music at the imperial court (kume uta, kagura uta, azuma asobi), while the other branch leads to the world of a rich and multicolored popular practice which, in the masked plays of the village kagura (sato kagura), remains alive today and recreates some episodes of Japanese mythology, among them Ame-no-uzume's dance in front of the Heavenly Cave. On these bases, we may risk the state ment that this Japanese ritual drama can be considered a surviving analogy to the Eleusinian ritual.</page></plain_text>
