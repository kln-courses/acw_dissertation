<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEOPARDI AND THE CITY OF DREADFUL NIGHT By LYMAN A. COTTEN Just as certain writers on Giacomo Leopardi have named him, mistakenly, the Italian Byron, so James Thomson, the stern pessi- mist of The City of Dreadful Night, has been called, with some- what more justification, the English Leopardi. Thomson himself is responsible for making this characterizing phrase so easy to use. When he published his first volume of poetry in 1880, containing The City of Dreadful Night, he dedicated this volume "To the younger brother of Dante, Giacomo Leopardi, a spirit as lofty, a genius as intense, with a yet more tragic doom." To, make the connection even more emphatic he prefaced The City of Dreadful Night with two fragments from Leopardi's Canti. To this, one needs only to add that the Englishman and the Italian are at one in their extreme pessimism. Solid as this evidence seems to be for calling Thomson the English Leopardi, it asserts no more than that he greatly admired a foreign poet whose attitude toward existence was harmonious with his own. In analyzing Leopardi's influence on Thomson's chief poem one is thus not confronted with the necessity of demonstrating the mere existence of that influence; the task is the more difficult one of determining what The City of Dreadful Night owes to Leopardi's writings. The problem is complicated, as I will try to show later, by the very fact that the predominant mood of both men was that of despair. To what extent, one asks, is Thomson's poem a reflec- tion of Leopardi's Canti and the Operette morali rather than a parallel and often very different expression of an ancient theme? Is Leopardi the master guiding the disciple, or simply a brother in that " sad Fraternity " which Thomson addressed in the opening stanzas of his poem? The dedication and the epigraphs were at least acknowledgment of an admiration of some twenty years' standing. Thomson dis- covered Leopardi's works during the 1850's when they were still generally unknown in England, but the first indication of his acquaintance with the Italian occurs in his prose phantasy "' A Lady of Sorrow" (1862, 1864), in which he quotes four lines of Amore e Morte.' The poem The Three That Shall Be One (1863) 1 James Thomson, Essays and Phantasies (London, 1881), p. 9. 675</page><page sequence="2">676 Leopardi and " The City of Dreadful Night " seems to reflect the Canti, and the indebtedness of The Naked Goddess (1866-7) is acknowledged by an epigraph from Alla primavera. It was not, however, until 1867 that Thomson fully demon- strated his admiration for Leopardi when the National Reformer, a weekly Secularist journal, began publishing a series of his felicitous translations from Leopardi's Operette morali.2 One could search England in vain for a more unsuitable vehicle for presenting to the English public these ironic, poetic, and philosophic essays and dialogues, but Thomson found other magazines closed to his writ- ings, whether poetry or prose. In October, 1869, the National Reformer began the publication of his lengthy biographical study of the Italian poet. The eleventh installment, in the issue of February 6, 1870, which brought the story of Leopardi's life to December, 1830, ended with the announcement "to be continued"; but no further installments appeared, and the magazine's failure to continue publication of the work was never explained.3 Mean- while Thomson had begun composing The City of Dreadful Night, and between January and December, 1870, he completed fifteen of the twenty-two cantos of the poem.4 It is not unreasonable, then, to look closely at the poem for echoes of Leopardi. II In this study of influences, three different expressions of Leo- pardi's mind must be examined: first, the letters, in which he 2Eleven dialogues and essays, and twenty-six Pensieri in eighteen issues (November, 1867-Jiune, 1868). 8 Twenty-three years after Thomson's death Bertram Dobell edited all of the translations from Leopardi: James Thomson (" B. V."), Essays, Dia- logucs and Thoutghts (Operette Morali and Pensieri) of Giacomo Leopardi (New Universal Library; London, [1905]). (This will be referred to in subsequent footnotes as Leopardi.) This volume contains the complete Operette morali and Pensieri, as given in the edition Thomson used: Opere di G. Leopardi, ed. Antonio Ranieri (Firenze, 1845 [or 1865] ), 2 vols. Dobell prefaced the translations with Thomson's complete biographical study, which is made up almost exclusively of translations from the Epistolario di G. Leopardi, ed. Prospero Viani (Firenze, 1849), 2 vols. ,'Not the first fifteen in the final arrangement for publication.

Thomson knew these three intimately, the Operette morali and the Epistola.rio as only a paintaking translator can. When one considers the devoted care with which he trans- lated Heine's lyrics, one may wonder why he ignored the Canti in favor of the prose works. The answer is to be found, probably, in a footnote to his literal prose version of the Chorus of the Dead in the Laboratory of Frederic Ruysch, in which he confesses his inability " to translate it into anything like poetry." ' These three expressions of Leopardi's nature must have been experienced by Thomson with an intensity happily foreign to the better insulated average man. A prominent characteristic of his melancholia was his heightened sensibility, his acute compassion for all suffering, which was part of his intuition into the essential evil of the universe and the emotional impulse behind his intellectual pessimism. His torture and Leopardi's torture must in his mind have become one and one also with all human pain. One incident must suffice to illustrate what was probably his feeling for Leo- pardi, though the incident concerns Heine. One morning G. W. Foote, then editor of the Secularist, which published Thomson's biographical sketch of Heine in 1876, entered Thomson's room and " found him still in bed, with pain in every line of his face. We had to speak of Heine, and he said with a strange shudder, ' He has been lying beside me all night."' 6 Remembering this hyper- sensitivity, one can imagine the sympathetic understanding of the English pessimist as he translated the despairing letters of his Italian brother, particularly those disarmingly frank ones written to Giordani between 1817 and 1825. S Leopardi, p. 204. This Chorus, characterized by Thomson's note as " one of the marvels of literature," is the indispensable introduction to the " Dialogue Between Frederic Ruysch and His Mummies," one of the Operette morali. 6G.

Both men repeat again and again their sense of being crushed by the almost palpable darkness of the atmospheres in which they passed their lives. As early as 1857, when Thomson was an army schoolmaster in Ireland, far from the London of his schoolboy years, he revealed hiis obsessing state of mind in part IV of his ambitious poem, The Doom of a City. Several years later in " A Lady of Sorrow " he again describes, still more elaborately, the London of his dark imagination. The final statement of his nightmare vision was achieved in his major poem, after some eight years of pacing the midnight streets of London in recurring attacks of insomnia. Even at the age of eighteen Leo- pardi was similarly oppressed by his surroundings, as the earliest letters to Giordani show. The feeling which he attributed at first to Recanati itself he later discovered to be derived from his own nature when Rome appeared to him a mausolean wilderness.7 Beyond this general similarity of attitude in the two poets lies, I believe, a connection between the Fpistolario and The City of Dreadful Night far more specific. In a letter to Giordani, after discussingf the effect of the climate of Recanati, Leopardi says, "'I know well and have experienced, but now experience no more, that sweet melancholy inspired by beautiful things, more sweet than mirth, which if I nmay so speak is as the twilight, while this is dense and horrible night (dove questa e notte fittissima e orri- bile)." 8' "Just now," he writes to General Colletta, " I will only say that, after sixteen months of horrible night (dopo sedici mitesi di notte orribile), after a mode of existence from which God save my worst enemies, your letter has come. . . ." From Florence he writes to Antonietta Tommasini, " I have come here . . . for rea- sons that would be long to tell; I shall remain as long as my little money lasts; then the dreadful night of Recanati awaits me (poi l'orrenda notte di ]ecatnati mi aspetta)." 1 We have in these 7Letters to his sister and his brother, December 3 and 6, 1822 (Leopardi, pp. 25-28).

Cotten 679 quotations, I believe, the source of Thomson's title The City of Dreadful Night. III If the question of Thomson's indebtedness to Leopardi were primarily one of art, it would be convenient to discuss separately the Epistolario, the Operette morali, and the Canti with respect to The City of Dreadful Night, for they are widely contrasting in manner; but our primary concern must be with those qualities of mind of which the artistic form is but one expression; with those ideas and feelings, so diversely stated by Leopardi, which are all referable to his unifying outlook on existence. It is, therefore, more illuminating to trace some parallels in experience and attitude between the two poets. Both men were melancholiacs by reason of certain experiences which can best be termed mystical. In 1819, after a year of intense suffering, when he was temporarily almost blind, Leopardi felt the force of an all-embracing intuition into the nature of being, a physical and psychical experience in which sensation and emotion and intellect were totally involved in a moment of overwhelming illumination. This event, the climax of his early life, he analyzed in detail in the Zibaldone and made the basis of his philosophic " system." Thomson, ignorant of the Zibaldone, could read of its effects in the letters to Giordani in 1819 and 1820. The following are two significant passages: I am so stupefied by the nothingness surrounding me, that I know not how I have force to take up the pen. . . . I have no longer the power to con- ceive any desire, not even of death; not that I fear this at all, but I no longer see any difference between death and this my life, so that not even suffering comes any longer to console me. This is the first time that life- weariness (la noia) not only oppresses and fatigues me, but afflicts and rends me like the sharpest suffering, and I am so terrified by the vanity of all things and by the condition of mankind, dead all the passions, as they are extinguished in me, that I get beside myself, considering that my very desperation is also a nullity."' Now I am parched and withered as a dry weed, and no passion finds entrance any longer into this poor souil. . . . For this is the miserable condition of man, and the barbarous teaching of reason, that, our pleasures and pains being mere illusions, the affliction which derives from the certi- tude of the nullity of all things is evermore and solely just and real.12 I' November 19, 1819 (Leopardi, pp. 15-16). 2 March 6, 1820 (ibid., p. 18).</page><page sequence="6">680 Leopardi and " The City of Dreadful Night " To this he adds that paradox which he calls " universal truth " and which represents the summation of his mystical insight: " tutto c nulla." Thomson describes most fully his comparable experience in "A Lady of Sorrow," an imaginative sketch in the manner of DeQuincey's Suspiria de Profundis and the most noteworthy ex- pression of his pessimism before The City of Dreadful Night. In fifty pages of grandiose symbolism, some of which anticipates his major poem, he presents the stages of his development, culminating in the same cenitral conviction as that of Leopardi, " all is nothing." Despite its imaginative elaboration, this phantasy is a genuine re- flection of what he felt and was feeling. Under the aspect of a profound grief,'3 he envisioned his emotion as an exalting Angel. This transfiguration of his sorrow was the first step in his enlighten- ment, an experience in which he seemed to see the world "with catholic vision." 14 The Angel soon took on another embodiment and appeared as a Siren, inspiring in him a blend of feverish ecstasy and corroding disgust. " She laughed back the world into chaos," he says. The final embodiment, 'never more an Angel, seldom more a Siren; but now a formless Shadow," '1 aroused in him a despairing horror, which he attempts to transform, in this last section of his phantasy, into a mystical love of death. In a nightmare vision of London, he conceives blind matter as " a colossal image of black marble, the Image and the concentration of the whole blackness of Night," 16 before which all men must bow. The Shadow, Nothingness, begins the " rites of her self-worship," II and the phantasy ends with her long sermon on the justice of annihilation and the blessedness of Nirvana. In the last canto of The City of Dreadful Night Melencolia, the "City's sombre Patroness and Queen," is in the iron grasp of the same state of mind which ILeopardi described, and the summation of her insight, that " all is vanity and nothingness," 's is one with l3The death, in July, 1853, of a young girl whom he had loved duriing his first stay in Ireland. 1" Essays and Phantasies, p. 7.

It is the ultimate intuition of pes- simism, that synthesizing insight which the Preacher stated as his text twenty-five centuries before, " Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." It is ultimate because all experience leads to it, and it is synthesiz- ing because all existence is comprised within it. As the final denial of the discovery of values in the objective world to correspond with the values conceived and cherished by the mind, it is the basis of the remarkable harmony of attitude that exists between Thomson and Leopardi. IV The experience shared by the two poets is so central in their lives that parallels in their writings inevitably result from it. One of its characteristics is a condition of both body and mind which has been given many names: the medieval acedia, Ecclesiastes' "v anity and vexation of spirit," taUdium vitac, William James' anhedonia, the German WVeltschmerz, and Leopardi's noia. As is demonstrated by such a work as The Dark Night of the Soul by Saint John of the Cross, Christian mystic and atheist pessimist describe this condition in remarkably similar terms, usually in metaphors dealing with darkness and aridity. So overpowering is the feeling of impotence and futility that it absorbs every other sensation and reduces the sufferer to a sort of vacant and objectless despair. The vital springs seem to dry up; thought becomes barren; existence is conceived as a desert. If there is one central doctrine in Leopardi's life and one recur- rent theme in his writings, it is concerned with his idea of noia. His vision of " nullity " in 1819 first brought him complete realiza- tion of the truth of which previously he had had only intellectual awareness, and this realization, he believed, destroys man's capacity for living.19 Leopardi, like other melancholiacs, finds desert the inevitable term to characterize the world under the aspect of noia,'0 and Thomson, viewing life with like despair, repeats the word with almost monotonous frequency in his poetry from the early Doom of a City to the late Insomnia. Both poets agree in describing this 19 Letter to Giordani, March 6, 1820; "Dialogue Between Plotinus and Porphyry"; Pensieri Nos. 67 and 68 (Leopardi, pp. 18-19, 277-78, 365). 20 See, for example, Leopardi, pp. 17, 27, 33; It pensiero dominante, 1. 97; II risorgimento, 1. 19; La gine8tra.</page><page sequence="8">682 Leopardi and " The City of Dreadful Night " state of mind as paradoxically extreme insensitivity, whether to pleasure or to pain, and at the same time acute torture, and both would welcome positive suffering in its place. In one of the Operette morali Tasso asks his familiar spirit for a remedy against noia and receives the reply that sleep, opium, and suffering alone avail, but that suffering "is the most powerful, because he who suffers never feels tedium." 21 In Canto VI of Thomson's poem the two men by the river bank seek a similar remedy for this disease of the spirit: one of the two has journeyed to Hell, gratified to gain That positive eternity of pain, Instead of this insufferable inane.32 Later in the poem another voice cries out that his " doom has been unmitigated dearth"; 23 still later Thomson describes his life as "an everlasting conscious inanition." 24 With this world-weariness comes a lacerating sense of frustration and loss. "While I com- prehend and feel intensely day by day the vanity of human affairs," Leopardi writes, " I am yet grieved and harassed by the considera- tion of how much should be done and how little I shall be able to do. Above all since fortune benumbs and fetters this one life which nature grants me; and I see it slipping and evaporating through my hands.... 25 The one passage of desperate defiance in The City of Dreadful Night vehemently echoes the same sense of irremediable loss and the same revolt against the pitiless condi- tions of life: " In all eternity I had one chance.... ~)26 One of the interesting similarities which connect the two pessi- mists is their analysis of noia as a blend of insanity and reason, or, more accurately, as fundamental sanity in the guise of madness. Shortly after his quasi-mystical experience Leopardi writes to Giordani, " If in this moment I grew mad, I believe that my mad- ness would consist in sitting ever with the eyes astonished, the mouth open, the hands between my knees, without either laughing or weeping, or moving.... ) 27 In a letter to Giordani already quoted in part he says: 21 C'Dialogue Between Tasso and His Familiar Spirit " (Leopardi, P. 162). 22The City, VI, 22-24. 25 January 5, 1821 (Leopardi, p. 21). 28 Ibid., VIII, 10.

Cotten 683 And although if we regulated our life in accordance with the conviction of this nullity, the world would come to an end, and we should be justly called mad, it is yet formally certain that this would be a madness, rea- sonable in all regards, and that compared with it all wisdom would indeed he madness, since everything is done in our world through the simple and continual ignoring of this universal truth, that all is nothing. . . . There is no other truth than nothingness; and this thought, and the bearing it continually in mind, as reason would ordain, must necessarily and directly bring us into the disposition I lhave spoken of; which would be madness according to nature, and absolute and perfect wisdom according to reason.28 Thomson explains in a stanza which seems to reflect this passage that the dwellers of his City, those who do regulate their lives in accordance with Leopardi's conviction of nullity, are most rationial and yet insane: An outward madness not to be controlled; A perfect reason in the central brain, Which has no power, but sitteth wan and cold, And sees the madness, and foresees as plainly The ruin in its path, and trieth vainly To cheat itself refusing to behold.29 For Thomson as for Leopardi-and for most pessimists worth the name-the primal curse of man is consciousness. Leopardi conceives human reason as the fatal instrument for penetrating the illusions which alone make life possible by hiding the nothingness at the center of all being, and in this he resembles the dwellers of Thomson's C'ity, whose curse it is to " pierce life's pleasant veil of various error to reach that void of darkness." 30 If existence is suffering, human reason is responsible. As early as 1817 Leopardi could say, that "which makes me unhappy is thought," "' and a few days later he writes that "thought has ever been my execu- tioner, and will be my destroyer if I remain in its power in this solitude." 82 In 1821 he writes to Giordani, "But as one cannot live without thinking, so I lamented that, having to exist, I was not a "I March 6, 1820 (ibid., pp. 18-19).

In the Canto notturno an envy of the blessed unconsciousness of the sheep arises in the tormented mind of the shepherd, and in the conclu- sion of La ginestra, written a year before his death, the mindless submission of the broom to the forces of destruction in nature is contrasted with man's futile revolt against these forces. The men of Thomson's City are introduced as suffering under the "dreadful strain of thought and consciousness which never ceases," 4 and this theme reappears like a leitmotif throughout his poem. In Canto XVIII he gives a new and curiously Freudian twist to it in show- ing a man desperately trying to retrace his life to the " antenatal night" of the womb-when, he adds, the gate of " death is close at hand." " Finally, in the nobly severe last canto, Melencolia is the symbol of barren thought as she broods on the nothingness behind appearances. Thus the two poets can, equally, echo Eccle- siastes: " He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow." V For both Leopardi and Thomson the remedy is death. The fundamental consistency of all pessimists is nowhere more apparent than in this austere prescription, the agreement that the only re- lease from suffering is the grave. When Leopardi was twenty-two, he wrote to Giordani, " I do not wish to live; but having to live, what use to kick against necessity? This cannot be conquered save by death." 36 A few months later he writes to his friend con- cerning " the last refuge of the unhappy subdued by necessity, and despoiled not of the courage to combat it, but of the last hope of being able to vanquish it, that is the hope of (speedy) death." 8 In a passage of like import in The City of Dreadful Night Thomson echoes the last phrase of his translation of this remark: We do not claim renewed and endless life When this which is our torment here shall close, ""July 13, 1821 (ibid., p. 22). *' The City, I, 74-75. 36 Ibid., XVIII, 70, 75.

We yearn for speedy death in full fruition, Dateless oblivion and divine repose.88 The conclusion to Amore e Morte is a prayer to " bella Morte " to bring the peace of oblivion, and the quiet exaltation of the Chorus of the Dead in the Laboratory of Frederic Ruysch stems from the recognition of escape from tedium. When Malambruno, having invoked a spirit of the abyss, asks to be made "happy for an instant," the spirit replies that the request is impossible to satisfy, and the dialogue ends with the assertion that since pain is the essence of consciousness, "speaking absolutely non-existence is always better than life." Similarly the Preacher in Thomson's City tells the shadowy congregation that " this little life is all we must endure "; if life is unendurable, he concludes, " Lo, you are free to end it when you will, without the fear of waking after death." 40 This announcement of man's right to take his own life brings to mind the interest of both poets in the problem of suicide. When Thomson quoted briefly from one of the Operette morali in his essay " On Suicide," 41 he may have recalled the noteworthy dis- cussions of the subject in Leopardi's writings, all of which he knew well: the two poems Bruto minore and the Ultimo canto di Saffo, the former especially giving a detailed exposition of Leopardi's justification of suicide; and the " Dialogue Between Plotinus and Porphyry," which presents both sides of the question. The pessi- mist who proclaims the supreme value of non-existence is under the logical necessity of justifying his own continued existence. Thom- son's explanation appears in Canto XIX of his poem and resem- bles-probably fortuitously-the final speech of Plotinus in Leo- pardi's dialogue, though Thomson does not stress the central point that the instinct for life always overpowers the dictates of reason. The two pessimists arrive at their conclusions concerning man's inability to alleviate the pain of existence through their similar conceptions of a mechanistic universe, another doctrine to which 19 The City, XIII, 38-42. 9" Dialogue Between Malambruno and Farfarello" (Leopardi, pp. 128- 31). 40 The City, XIV, 49, 83-84.

In the Canti and the Operette morali the words fato, sorte, and necessita' recur frequently, just as their English equivalents often appear in Thomson's poems. The indif- ference of nature to man's desires is a fundamental source of anguish to both. Leopardi's Brutus, for example, says, " By iron compulsion (necessita) and unconquered fate death's puny slaves are ground." 42 Thomson's Preacher announces his philosophic con- clusion: " I find alone Necessity Supreme." 4 Earlier in the poem a voice in the darkness is heard to say: The world rolls round for every like a mill; It grinds out death and life and good and ill; It has no purpose, heart or mind or will.44 In one of the Operette morali an Icelander explores the would to find a solution to the problemn of man's suffering, just as Thomson's Preacher, on behalf of his congregation, has searched the highths and depths, the scope Of all our universe, with desperate hope To find some solace for your wild unrest."' Both discover the same ancient answer. Nature, the Icelander learns, is "a perpetual circle of reproduction and destruction, so interlinked that they react continually on each other," unconscious of either benefit or injury to man."6 Thomson asserts through the Preacher of his City: All substance lives and struggles evermore Through countless shopes continually at war, By countless interactions interknit. ... 42 Bruto minore, 11. 31-32; The Poems of LeopaJrdi, trans. and ed.

A. Cotten 687 I find no hint throughout the Universe Of good or ill, of blessing or of curse. As a result of these convictions Thomson was outspokenly anti- Christian in many of his writings, stating with particular insistence his horror of any anthropomorphic conception of God. In the cathedral of the City the Preacher proclaims his Good tidings of great joy for you, for all: There is no God; no Fiend with names divine Made us and tortures us; if we must pine, It is to satiate no Being's gall."8 No doubt Leopardi found it too dangerous to be similarly out- spoken in the Italy of his day, but in his fragmentary Hymn to Ahriman, not published until many years after his death, he dares a blasphemy very like Thomson's: Lord and Creator of all things, unfathomed Iniquity, consummate power and consummate Intelligence, eternal Fountain of woes, director of all motion. . Thomson never read these lines. They are quoted here to illustrate the danger of asserting too boldly the influence of the Italian pessimist on the English. VI Whatever the normally healthy-minded may think of such doc- trines of despair, Leopardi and Thomson felt that they were irre- sistibly impelled to accept them, both by the objective facts of the universe and by the dictates of their reason. After such knowl- edge, what peace? The unrest of both men showed itself in their painful impulse to look more deeply into this truth of theirs and to tell the world what they saw. "I seek nothing but the truth," ILeopardi wearily tells Giordani, "which once I so hated and de- tested.

The iron ring of Thomson's stanzas is alien to Leopardi's poetry, just as the unearthly harmony of phrase in the Canti is not echoed by Thomson's powerful rhetoric. Even the externals of Leopardi's style, his rhythms and verse forms, are never reflected in The City of Dreadful Night. The differences in style reflect certain differences in poetic mood. For all his deep- rooted classicism, Leopardi was often the romantic agonist, drowned in a luminous sea of melancholy, feeling in the moonlight a subtly assuaging despair, twinning love and death in the creation of the ultimate romanticism. In the last section of " A Lady of Sorrow " Thomson was trying to express the same mood, and hence the manner of the prose phantasy suggests the Canti as The City of Dreadful Night, harsher in its pessimism, never does. The classic calm of the Canti, even in the utterance of despair, is at the oppo- site pole from the Gothic shadows and terrors of Thomson's poem, and it is not Leopardi, but Durer, to whom he turns for his final symbol of heroic despair. The natural world of the Canto tnotturno and Alla primavera is serenely, coldly, inhumanly beautiful; the world of The City of Dreadful Night is a place of delirium anid madness, the city of Dis.

Cotten 689 poets, but the verbal resemblances seem to be largely the result of their agreement of attitude and of the general metaphorical con- sistency in imaginative expressions of pessimism from Ecclesiastes to The WVaste Land. In the use of such symbols as night and darkness, dust, the desert, the alien stars Leopardi and Thomson approach each other in phrase, though they are still remote in gen- eral style. Of all Leopardi's writings, the letters to Giordani, so frankly despairing, come closest in tone and expression to The City of Dreadful Night, those letters which Thomson used most fully in his biographical sketch of Leopardi and which he had been trans- lating during the months before he began the composition of his poem. When George Saintsbury reviewed The City of Dreadful Night in 1880, he remarked, " We cannot help wishing that Mr. Thomson had read Shakspere more and Leopardi less." " In view of their dissimilarities of style, Saintsbury must have been referring to the philosophy they held in common, and hence was strangely mis- taking a settled conviction for a literary affectation. Thomson may be called the English Leopardi if the phrase means simply that he wrote the most despairing poem in English and confessed his admiration for another pessimistic poet in its dedication; but if the phrase implies what Saintsbury suggests in his remark, then one must answer that Thomson needed no poet or philosopher-not Lucretius or Ecclesiastes or Schopenhauer or Leopardi-to teach him a dark view of life. He did not go to Leopardi to borrow ideas in the creation of a philosophic attitude or to learn a language in which to express it: what he found in Leopardi was what the wanderers of his City found in the statue of Melencolia, "renewed assurance and confirmation of the old despair." 5 University of North Carolina. 64 Acodemy, XVII (1880), 433.
