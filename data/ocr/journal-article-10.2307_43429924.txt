<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Social Insects, their Origin and Evolution. By William Morton Wheeler, Ph.D., Sc.D., LL.D. [Pp. xviii + 378, with 79 figures.] (London : Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co. ; New York : Har- court, Brace and Company, 1928. Price 215. net.) This book, as the author states in his preface, consists basically of twelve lectures delivered by Dr. Wheeler while occupying a Harvard exchange pro- fessorship in the spring of 1925 at the University of Paris. These lectures were published by Gaston Doin &amp; Co. in 1926 under the title " Les Sociétés d'Insectes, leur Origine, leur Évolution," in the Encyclopédie Scientifique , edited by Prof. M. Caullery. The original lecture form has been retained, but additional passages omitted in the French publication have been restored, a small amount of new material has been added, and various errors have been corrected. A few illustrations appear for the first time and a few are now omitted. Finally, the work has been brought up to date as far as possible. It may be pointed out that this book is not to be confused with a former book by Dr. Wheeler, entitled Social Life Among The Insects , published a few years ago by Constable &amp; Co., Ltd. Dr. Wheeler, the leading authority on social insects, starts the series of lectures with an introduction concerning the scope and meaning of the social among insects. Four general questions relating to what are social insects, whether they have had an evolution, the peculiarities of this evolution, and the cause or conditions that may be assigned to this evolution, are dealt with and partially answered. The origin of the Terebran tia and Aculeata forms the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS S45 next lecture. Then follow successive chapters or lectures on the evolution of wasps, bees, ants, and termites ; these deal in detail with those insects which have become definitely social and have passed the subsocial state reached by such insects as, for example, the Silvanidae among the beetles, and earwigs, Embiids, and Gryllotalpa among other orders. Two chapters are devoted to an excellent account of Polymorphism, and these are followed by a very lucid account and explanation of the social medium and trophallaxis or reciprocal exchange of food and other stimuli. Dr. Wheeler re-explains in some detail his conception and use of the term " tro- phallaxis, and answers his critics, especially Father Wasmann. He goes on to review the relevant facts and emphasises the fact that the usefulness of the principle may be extended to include other phenomena besides the exchange of food, for example, olfaction. In this connection he introduces the term " chemorecept " instead of the anthropomorphic terms " taste " and " smell." The evolution of the guests and parasites of the social insects occupies the two next chapters or lectures. These chapters, perhaps even more than the rest of the story of social insects, illustrate strange parallels between insect societies and human society. Chapter XII is a very able conclusion in which Dr. Wheeler briefly out- lines the probable evolution of the truly social insects. He also indulges, not without good cause, in more detailed comparisons of the social insects and man. There is a good bibliography of 37 pages containing references to writings of over 450 scientific workers. It seems strange, however, that no reference is made to Rösch's work. A full index completes the volume. Very few typographical errors still remain, for example, Ý instead of &lt;£ on p. 230. The illustrations are good. On reading the book one is struck by the ease with which the master- hand of Dr. Wheeler deals with the whole ground suggested by the title : a thorough introduction, detailed accounts of the four groups of insects and various phenomena concerned, all following each other with great clarity. Besides appealing to the entomologist, this book must attract the attention of followers of the modern trend of thought in the fields of philosophy, socio- logy, and animal behaviour. H. F.
