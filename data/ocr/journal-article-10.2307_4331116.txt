GILLESPIE Department of Historn Georgia State University Atlanta, Georgia 3030(3 Does a modern biologist's personal philosophy matter? Or is current scientific practice so conventionalized that biologists follow the same "rules" regardless of their own philosophical attitudes and values? Those sharing the "ethos of science" would argue that it is, and it is not surprising to find that several prominent biolo- gists and philosophers of science at the 1972 Serbelloni confer- ence on reductionism in biology took this position.' Furthermore, Nils Roll-Hansen has contended that two much-discussed critiques of mechanistic biology carried out in this century had very little impact on the actual work done in biology, and William Provine has found population geneticist Sewall Wright's philosophical idealism irrelevant for understanding his science.2 Repeated philo- sophical exposures of the alleged inadequacies of reductive biol- ogy have not discouraged research in the molecular realm.3 It would seem, then, that contemporary biology does have conven- 1.

GILLESPIE tional constraints that work to reduce the importance of eccentric or extraneous views. On the other hand, the actual situation in science is often less straightforward and more variable than the claims made in the name of the "ethos of science" might lead one to believe. The work of British ethologist W. H. Thorpe (1902-1986) is a counterexample of biological science that is not fully understand- able without attention to the philosophic commitment that helped to shape it. One may see in his career an interplay of personal belief and scientific convention of a type that need not be limited to those who take natural theology seriously. This paper argues that Thorpe's biological work took the form it did partly because of the imperatives provided by his religious and philosophical convictions. It is not argued here that ethological views similar to Thorpe's required his natural theology as their basis - some of them could be, and were, held by other ethologists who did not share his religion. Also, it is not asserted here that in some simple way his natural theology "caused" his ethology. What is argued is that, in Thorpe's case, there was a strong affinity between his theology and the type of ethology to which he was attracted. However, there were strong counterattractions in Thorpe's science, which, had the natural theology not been present, could easily have directed him to a conventional ethological behaviorism. As will be shown, and unlike many others who dissented from an allegedly materialistic, mechanistic reductive biology, Thorpe actu- ally practiced a predominantly mechanistic and behavioristic sci- ence and remained a Darwinian selectionist.4 These working 4. Many scholars have pointed out that a reduction/antireduction or mecha- nistic/holistic division oversimplifies both the theory and practice of twentieth- century biology. In this paper, however, I shall follow this division because Thorpe employed it and, whatever the actual case, saw biological controversy in those terms. The strategic value to him of this division will become evident. Thorpe combatted a prejudice as much as a practice, and the more "vulgar" the reduction, the better the target it made. As illustrative of this prejudice, contrast Jacques Monod's "vulgar" reductionism as quoted in John Lewis, ed., Beyond Chance and Necessity: A Critical Inquiry into Professor Monod's "Chance and Necessity" (Atlantic Highlands: Humanities, 1974), p. ix, with his considered position in Jacques Monod, Chance and Necessity, An Essay on the Natural Philosophy of Biology (New York: Knopf, 1971), p. xii.

Thorpe 3 orthodoxies helped to preserve his position within the mainstream of twentieth-century biology. A fellow of the Royal Society, recipient of other professional honors, and associated from the 1930s with biological studies at Cambridge University, Thorpe became widely known as an entomologist, an ornithologist, and an authority on animal learning and vocal communication, especially bird song. A PHILOSOPHICAL SCIENTIST W. H. Thorpe was not of equal fame as a philosopher, although his books were usually given respectful, if skeptical, reviews. His religious and philosophical thought was largely programmatic, sometimes cryptic, and not always consistent, and it bristled with begged questions. He made no claim to originality, however, and was frank in expressing his intellectual debts. His natural theology is important historically because it represents a concern that affected his science, and, equally important, because its public advocation in lectures and books played a part in continuing into the twentieth century the traditional British idea that natural theology, which binds religion and science together, is a necessary part of a Christian outlook and, not less, of an adequate scientific one. The history of this activity, as well as of other attempts by biologists in the twentieth century to popularize their speculations as proper extensions of biological science, deserves and is begin- ning to receive the attention of scholars. One cannot separate Thorpe's natural theology (which, strictly speaking, should not involve the doctrines of revealed theology but should rest on inferences drawn from nature or deduced from first principles) from his Christian belief. As is usually the case with scientists who have this interest, the two were intertwined and mutually forming. This essay will highlight those concepts which Thorpe thought could be found in nature through the medium of science, and which he thought pointed toward a theological under- standing of nature. Also, this paper will assume that Thorpe's 102; Robert Olby, "Structural and Dynamical Explanations in the World of Neglected Dimensions," in A History of Embryology, ed. T. J. Horder, J. A.

GILLESPIE holistic philosophical position was substantially unchanged over his career. The assumption is not gratuitous for he tells us that when he and C. H. Waddington were young scientists they shared an enthusiasm for the process philosophy of Alfred North White- head, but that, as time passed, Thorpe became less of a "White- headian."5 This reassessment accompanied the emergence of a dualistic outlook and Thorpe's rejection of what he tobok to be Whitehead's panpsychist monism, but the "organicism" and the stress on "process" that he found in Whitehead's thought Be never gave up and came increasingly to appreciate. Refinements and variations, of course, came with time; but his lasting sense, despite his dualism, was of the developing oneness, the wholeness, of man and nature, and of the relation of both to the divine.' Hence Thorpe sprang to defend Teilhard de Chardin and considered the French Jesuit's evolutionary vision - while not science - to be one of the most important for science and humanity in this century.7 Thorpe, a Quaker since 1945, had little to say about formal Christian doctrine, perhaps as befitted one who endorsed the irenic mission of natural theology, but it would only be accurate to call his position Christian evolutionism. While normally concilia- tory, he could be pungently critical of smug agnostics who had abandoned Christianity in adolescence (if, indeed, they had ever known it) and who used arguments "shot through with bias, wilful ignorance, double think and wishful thinking."' He firmly believed that of the world's religions only Christianity contained the theological insight into sacrifice necessary to accept the facts of biological evolution and to accept the natural creation as a part of revelation, just as it alone contained the proper elements of religious mysticism and eschatological hope needed to inspire 5.

But the religious impulse itself, on which theology had built, he insisted was a product of human evolution. The "intuitive realization of participating in, or belonging to, a system vastly greater than oneself," and the urge toward ritual expression, were emergent aspects of humanity's own biological history.' ' Biological evolution, with Homo sapiens - "a moral and spiritual as well as a physical being" - as its present high point, was, for Thorpe, a "creation in the fullest sense of the word." Here he was not merely playing on the word "creation," as when it is sometimes said that natural selection is creative. Thorpe agreed that natural selection is creative, but he argued that beyond that, the world of life was an epiphany of God's spirit wherein some- thing of his identity and grace were manifested. In this divine creation, man was "not merely a witness, but a participant and partner as well." 'I His belief in the divine creation of a real world committed Thorpe to scientific realism. He brushed aside the philosophical conundrums and scientific paradoxes surrounding the realist position by an appeal to the "common-sense conviction" of every practicing scientist "that he is dealing with a real external world." 3 3 Thorpe was equally convinced that the material world was complemented by a "spiritual world which is interpenetrating with and yet transcending" it, just as God "includes and penetrates the whole universe" but at the same time transcends it. Humans realized this complementarity of matter and mind, of the natural and the supernatural in their dual natures. "There is in Man," Thorpe believed, "a divine spirit which is over and above the physical forces of evolution - prior to them, in fact; but which is in ever increasing measure capable of assuming control of the physical process. In this sense the spirit of man may be seen as 9. Animal Nature, pp. 266, 378, 381; Science, pp. 58, 140-141; Quakers, pp. 1 3-15, 1 7n, 51.

Ultimately, then, Thorpe's dualism disappeared into a mystical holism. His concepts of holism and dualism were attempts to capture intellectually what was incommensurable with intellect.'4 Since he accepted a mental coreality along with the material world, Thorpe rejected as "mechanism and materialist metaphysics" any attempt to account for mind as merely a function of neural physiology. He found it an inescapable fact that mind was neces- sary for knowing, and this meant that "mind and body are in sone sens&amp; two things." Thorpe did not deny the function of the brain as being (following neurophysiologist Sir Charles Sherrington) "'the organ of liaison"' between the mental and material realms indeed, neurophysiology fascinated him, as it did many ethologists of his generation - but he had no clue - nor, he felt, did anyone else - as to how this liaison was carried out. Therefore, he believed that in order to "make sense of the world of nature and ourselves as part of it" we must employ dual categories.'5 Scientific monism in any form he found incomprehensible. Dualism led Thorpe to a sympathetic acceptance of some claims put forth by parapsychologists. "I believe," he wrote in 1974, "it can be said that, on straightforward grounds of scientific evidence, the existence of some forms of ESP was settled a long time back... ." Some form of parapsychology seemed "statistically beyond refutation," he argued, despite the "almost pathological" opposition of many scientists. If true, Thorpe believed, para- psychological phenomena would virtually prove the reality of a dualistic view of the world.'6 Similarly, dualism led Thorpe to take leave of Alfred North Whitehead and his biological disciples. He considered Whitehead to have been one of the few modern philosophers who understood biology and who had seen the implications of its evolutionary concepts for the entirety of science in the face of the collapse of mechanistic physics. Thorpe was attracted by Whitehead's emphasis on process, evolution, and purpose in the universe - but his panpsychist monism, as Thorpe understood it, seemed to be beyond any "conceivable scientific possibility of investigating its 14.

Such a view of nature seemed scientifically useless and even suggested to Thorpe the unpleasant possibility of a nonrealist view of science itself.'7 Worse, in the hands of followers like C. H. Waddington, Whiteheadian monism, which postulated a "mental component" in matter, could be used to avoid acknowl- edging both the emergence of genuine novelty in evolution (in this case, of mind) and the dual nature of reality.'8 Of all monisms, Thorpe found Whitehead's the most plausible, even appealing in some ways; on the highest levels of conceptualization it might have great value for biologists. But he remained a " pragmatic dualist" because he found "the discontinuities in nature so great and so obvious" that dualism was, for him, "an essential attitude of mind." '9 Thorpe's practical dualism enhanced his ability to accept a naturalistic or materialistic approach to the study of biology. Humans, he insisted, are "members of the animal kingdom" who must be understood as biological creatures. He had no doubt that humans and other animals are related along numerous continua both physical and mental; that in humans and animals alike, consciousness is a product of brain physiology.2" For Thorpe, this common material nature did not debase humans; rather, it enhanced all life and created challenges for the scientific study of other species: challenges that could not be met in terms of a mechanistic reductionism.21 Despite his naturalism, Thorpe resisted what he took to be extreme forms of sociobiology and genetic determinism, and 17.

GILLESPIE especially their popular versions, all of which he thought outran scientific evidence. While his theology of creation led him to assume that the course of evolution had some bearing on ethics, he rejected any direct equation of the two.22 Science, as currently formulated, he believed, would probably never succeed in com- pletely puzzling out man. Ethologists generally, he claimed, believed that "the psychic factors [have been] more important than any other one feature in determining the evolutionary course of the hominids," but many of these were now lost beyond recovery. Nevertheless, human culture, like the human body, had had its origins far back in the animal past.23 The emergence of human beings from that past, an emergence to be understood naturalis- tically, held for Thorpe the key to human nature, to animal nature (through the study of ethology), and to evolution itself. Because of his naturalism, Thorpe put his doctrine of "emergent evolution" into a Darwinian framework. He accepted Darwinism as the great and fruitful generalization of modern biology.24 Natural selection, he wrote, was "the driving force and filter of evolution, the creative principle which gives rise to, maintains, and shapes the mechanisms" of life. Correctly understood, it was neither "random" nor "blind" in the sense of being meaningless, but was, instead, a process of adaptive direction that helped to create true beauty and purpose in the world. Even for humans, it was one of the basic circumstances of existence: their social life, which in its beginnings could be traced "far down the vertebrate scale,"9 and their "brain and mind" also, were partly the products of natural selection. They were, even yet, under its influence. The genetic code of all living things, the instincts of animals, the earliest appearances of what could be called 'mind," were among the results of its operation. While its adaptations were not planned or foreseen, it worked in ingenious ways to make "the unpredictable inevitable."25 Not all formulations of selection theory were accept- 22.

Thorpe distinguished between "ethics," which could profit from the experi- ences of evolution, and "morals" as ultimate values, which were the province of theology: Science, p. 131. A grasp of "abstract moral law" was today a uniquely human attribute, although some degree of "gra(dual emergence of true moral insight" in evolution was not deemed impossible for other animals: Biology, pp. 44-45. 23.

Thorpe 9 able to Thorpe, however; some seemed to exclude the emergent discontinuities that he believed were centrally important for evolu- tion, or were so reductive as to make him wonder whether natural selection could account for emergents at all.26 Emergents, Thorpe wrote, were "new things that emerge at points in the phylogeny and ontogeny of living things which it is not permissible, with our present view of science, to regard as predictable." This might change, he admitted, as science devel- oped; but for now, emergents not only seemed unpredictable, they were actually anomalous in terms of existing science. Thorpe believed that, in general, emergents could only be accounted for theoretically by postulating - and here he followed Michael Polanyi - "a hierarchy in which a higher level [of being] can come into existence only by a process not manifest in the lower level." In this hierarchy, the higher levels require principles of conceptuali- zation that are inappropriate to the lower levels. Like most contemporary biologists who adopt an emergent viewpoint, Thorpe argued emphatically that the operation of these novel concepts did not require new laws of nature, nor were old laws being broken. Emergence was not vitalism. Instead, a new process was implemented directing existing substances to new ends, into new avenues.27 What emergents or discontinuities did Thorpe have in mind? Life, consciousness, self-consciousness. Why did these evolve? he asked. What were they for? Consciousness, he claimed, had appeared several times in the course of evolution in several different animal lines. Why? Why could not animals have gotten on just as well without "this apparently strange and new faculty?" He speculated, as had William James, that increasingly complex mental organization may have required consciousness as a means of better control: that, in the course of evolution, "with the development of purposive behaviour and a powerful faculty of attention, consciousness associated with expectation will become more and more vivid and precise." In any event, he was clear that 26. Science, pp. 20, 28, 59-60, 66; Animal Nature, pp. 57-58, 204. 27. Science, pp. 29, 53; W. H. Thorpe, "Vitalism and Organicism," in The Uniqueness of Man, ed.

GILLESPIE the rise of consciousness could not have been some sort of epiphenomenal evolutionary accident. It must have had significant selective value. If so, he asked, did this "not imply that conscious- ness is something other than brain action - a real emergent?" 28 Thorpe's ambivalence toward conventional mechanistic biology was sometimes striking. In the same 1966 paper whose conclusion contained the above declaration, he began by taking for grainted the conventional view that consciousness is a product of the physiological mechanisms in the brain.29 While Thorpe would certainly have denied that there was a contradiction between these two views, since emergents developed out of lower strata of being, they do suggest a tension. The same tension can be seen in his confidence in natural selection, which rested on his willingness to accept as a working proposition the conventional view that good biological science is largely mechanistic science. His philosophical commitments, however, sat in continuous judgment on that view. The result was the creation of serious problems of consistency and conceptualization. Thorpe held that mechanistic biology, which he understood to be based on the assumption that life in all of its expressions could be reduced to the present laws of physics and chemistry, was fundamentally inapplicable to the study of life, even though he had to admit its popularity and success. Furthermore, his scientific realism existed in tension with an idealist epistemol- ogy that made human perceptions rest on a priori categories of order, a Gestalt that may "be said to constitute mankind's knowl- edge of reality."30 At bottom, Thorpe worked within a holistic science - emergent, organismic, and mentalistic - that was shaped by his theology. NATURAL THEOLOGY Throughout his scientific career Thorpe was active as a writer and public lecturer in the cause of a revived natural theology. He believed that biology had displaced physics and astronomy as the major source of challenge to traditional philosophic and religious 28. "Ethology and Consciousness," pp. 250, 493-494; Science, pp. 53, 60. Emphasis in original. Thorpe suggested that a higher form of consciousness, now familiar as religious mysticism, might be the next emergent even now beginning to appear in human evolution: Science, pp. 145-147. Similarly, he looked on the unique moral evaluation of humans traditionally represented by the concept of a soul as, like mind, "a completely new and unforeseeable emergent" (Animal Nature, pp. 369-370). 29.

Thorpe I 1 belief and that it was the responsibility of biologists to deal with the larger implications of their science, a duty that they had so far been reluctant to fulfill - much more reluctant than physicists and astronomers. He believed that there had grown up in the modern world "a kind of inexorable ground-swell of modern man's aware- ness of himself and the world," a movement increasingly insistent on the "unitary foundation of all experience - scientific, artistic and religious." In response to this emerging consciousness, Thorpe saw it as his mission to dissuade his readers from following either the false path of narrow religious orthodoxy - "fundamentalism" - or the equally false and narrow path of "mechanistic material- istic science." "No scientist," he wrote, "has the evidence to be philosophically a scientific materialist." This latter view, as much as the other, was incompatible with true science. He thought it unlikely that religion, being a product of human evolution, would ever be given up. But this made it all the more important that the problems between religion and science be removed. For Thorpe, personally, reconciling the new "biological understanding of man" with Christianity was foremost among contemporary intellectual issues. Consequently, he continued the British tradition in which scientists explored natural theology and gladly took up the task of public education that it involved. A scientist who was serious about the world he lived in could do no less.3' The natural theology of William Paley with its emphasis on adaptive design would no longer do, of course: it was "clearly inapplicable to our thought today."32 Unfortunately, the retire- ment of Paley's argument in the face of Darwinian criticisms had left Christians at a disadvantage. Following theologian J. S. Bezzant, Thorpe argued that it was largely owing to the loss of any acceptable natural theology that there were no convincing answers to the intellectual objections to Christianity. A created nature that could tell nothing about its creator was a circumstance so anomalous that it undermined the likelihood of any revelation, in scripture or elsewhere. According to Bezzant, if there are no signs of God in nature, there is little basis for finding him in a collection of mythological and historically dubious texts. Christianity, then, required a natural theology.33 Given the need, Thorpe believed that, as Bezzant had put it, 31.

GILLESPIE "'the only possible basis for a reasonably grounded natural theology is what we call scientific."' Science can and should tell us something, he thought, about the "enduring reality underlying the transient natural world." Indeed, he considered science "the great revelation of God to this day and age." It seemed very likely to him that Christianity and science could, through a true metaphysics, meet in the realm of natural theology. The difficulty was that science, as a body of doctrine, was diverse and inconsistent; metaphysics was scorned by most moderns; and Christians had almost uniformly turned their backs on natural theology.34 These were impediments that could be, and perhaps were being, re- moved. But what, in general terms, could science provide on which a convincing natural theology could be established? Cautiously, Thorpe suggested that certain areas of science independently contained clues to the "enduring reality' that existed behind the "transient natural world." Foremost among these was the inter- related harmony in diversity found in living nature; this suggested a moral principle that could be extended to human society. Secondly, there was the progress to be seen in the trends of increasing complexity and efficiency of organic adaptation as guided by natural selection: "degrees of perfection," he called it. There was the qualitative emergence of mind and purpose in the evolution of animals and human beings. And, while he expected the creation of life to occur someday in the laboratory, the beginning of life itself was an event so unlikely as to be almost a miracle.35 Strengthened and encouraged by these hints of divinity in natural things, Thorpe thought it possible to attempt a revival of the ancient design argument. From the standpoint of natural theology, Thorpe argued that the most significant thing about the universe was its orderliness. He believed that, in contrast to the increasing entropy of the nonliving world, the world of life was a world of increasing order. Evolution represented "a stupendous increase of order - that is to say, a stupendous increase of information." Thorpe thought it unlikely that this information-order had preexisted in the original cosmic nebulae or that it could have been present in the original DNA programs of living things; it must have accumulated over time, but where it had come from cotuld not be explained by current science and, he suspected, would not be explained until 34.

That the universe "is peculiarly fit for life," and had apparently been so from the first instances of its existence, he found to be persuasive evidence that such a plan existed. The conventional processes of evolution could not explain this striking preadaptation of the nonliving universe for life, just as they could not account for the various primary emergents that had appeared in the course of evolution - rather, they presupposed it. Thorpe believed that the genuine creative power of natural selection was great, but that natural selection could not have created the original properties with which it subsequently worked. If "we have even the dimmest evidence for a plan," he wrote, "then the hypothesis of a creator begins to appear plausible. And if we think we see a basic design or series of designs, then I believe the creator concept becomes hard to avoid."37 Hard to avoid, perhaps - but it was not inevitable. Thorpe did not go so far as to claim that the data of science required a theistic interpretation. He only argued that the purposiveness seen in the world that science described permitted such an interpretation, and that if one saw that purposiveness as designed, then he personally could not see how theism could be evaded. Technically, Thorpe's position on design begged the same question that was begged in the classic statements: In order to see design in the end product, one must assume it in the antecedent. If human beings now "fit" the universe, and this is to be seen as designed, then the beginning 36. W. H. Thorpe, "Ethology and the Coding Problem in Germ Cell and Brain," Z.

Pantin for elements of this argument and was indebted, through Pantin, to L. J. Henderson's Fitness of the Environment (New York: Macmillan, 1913). See C. F. A. Pantin, "Organic Design," Brit. Ass.

GILLESPIE of the universe must be assumed to have been designed to "fit" human beings - that is, intentionally to evolve them. But what basis was there for this assumption in Thorpe's science? The beginnings of the universe were what they were from causes ultimately unknown. Organisms evolved by natural selection to 'fit" the prescription of the universe because in order to exist they must do so, and not from any demonstrable intention anywhere in the process. Thorpe was quite right that natural selection could not explain design. Selectionist ways of thinking could not even formu- late the problem: the argument from design was unintelligible. But Thorpe seems to have thought that a successful design argument was one that "explained" some circumstance in nature, in the sense of giving a plausible theological or philosophical account of it that was seemingly compatible with science, but which admittedly went beyond science. Possibly it never occurred to him that a successful argument would be one that overcame the logical objections raised against the classic presentations. In fact, there is no indication in his natural theological writings that he was aware of a logical problem. Rather, he attempted to shift the burden of proof from the theist to the scientist to "show that a creator is an unnecessary hypothesis." Thorpe asked, "And is it conceivable that he can do this?""8 He thought not. Thorpe, of course, nowhere invoked a creator as part of a purely scientific argument. His commilment to naturalism as a convention of scientific practice was too firm for that. But he believed with equal firmness that science ultimately could be adequately done only "by consciously or subconsciously adopting an attitude to the sum of things which is essentially a religious attitude; essentially - even at a very long remove - a search for the unified reality underlying all experience." This belief was what made science possible and worthwhile. It was our only guarantee of a real external world.39 This holistic assumption was the constraint that natural theology exercised on Thorpe's science. In his ethological writings he was constantly pulled between reduc- tionism and holism.40 He often acknowledged that reductive inter- pretations were possible; he sometimes employed them. But as a description of the world and as an adequate expression of science he found them incredible. THE PARADOXES OF MECHANISM But if they were incredible, why were reductive mechanistic or 38.

Thorpe 1 5 behavioral explanations so popular in science? Why did Thorpe himself use them? This was one of the major difficulties that Thorpe faced in his attempts to achieve a science that comple- mented natural theology. Philosophically, mechanism seemed irra- tional. By making all knowledge illusory as being merely the fruit of a predetermined material order, Thorpe believed, mechanism undercut the scientist's own purposive actions - unless he incon- sistently made an ad hoc exception for himself and his activities.4' Moreover, Thorpe urged that mechanism was dangerous. If we believe that only reductionist science is valid, and that its view of human beings as merely the products of "vast machine-like evolu- tionary forces" is true, then we are led to "a hopeless loss of faith" in the worth of human life and in a purpose in existence. Worse, some people actually welcomed such teaching in the belief that it was scientific.42 Fortunately, he argued, the rationality of science and its advance depend in no way on mechanism. Contemporary physicists had demonstrated that "nature is fundamentally non- mechanical"; this had been widely accepted, even though some physicists yet clung to the hope that "reductionist determinism" might be saved. Nor was mechanism anymore suitable as a basis for biology, despite the enthusiasm of molecular biologists for it. Thorpe claimed that, in reality, many biologists shared his dualism, and that there was a growing reassessment of the place of mechanistic thinking in biology.43 And yet, much of the work done by Thorpe and other biologists was mechanistic. This was, he acknowledged, because mechanism was undeniably useful and, up to a point, true. "We must never forget," he wrote, "that mechanism rules in its proper sphere and that the mechanistic world-picture remains (in spite of its inherent philosophical confusions) highly attractive to most scientists as a world view and still, even now, provides a formidable opposition to any other." For many, it was seen "as the sole biological orthodoxy."44 Partly this was because biologists tended to select problems for research that would yield to mechanistic approaches; the rewards of this practice for modern biology had been great. But work based on mechanism pointed beyond itself to areas of biology that would require "more sophisticated and elaborate 41.

There would always be something in reality that would escape natural science, and especially reductive natural science.45 Nevertheless, this limitation did not diminish mecha- nism's widely recognized cognitive utility. Thorpe may have been disconcerted but was surely not surprised when, at the Pontifical Academy's 1964 conference on consciousness and the brain, his fellow dualist and neurophysiological mentor, Sir John Eccles, replied to his question of whether there were any brain functions that consciousness aided, by saying ". . . as neurophysiologists we simply have no use for consciousness in our attempts to explain how the nervous system works....46 Thorpe admitted, then, that mechanism owed its place among scientists to its performance. But that was not the entire story: the inertia of mental habit, prejudice, and intellectual indifference also played a part. Biologists clung to a mechanistic view of life as an act of faith and from simple lack of philosophical insight. Mecha- nism might seem "more economical, more tidy, more amenable to practical experimental study" - but, at bottom, it rested on faith.47 This circumstance seemed to put biologists in the position of using a theory that could not give them the knowledge they wanted. Thorpe recognized that the data of ethology could and often did imply a predominance of mechanistic behavior in animals. But consciousness existed. In many species, he wrote, "one gets the impression of real foresight." How then was this to be studied? True, even apparently conscious behavior could be described without any appeal to consciousness, but could it be understood without it? Thorpe was doubtful.48 He was sure that the limits of mechanism, and of reductive science generally, were becoming more evident as special problems resisted its solutions and as sciences such as ethology matured. The "person" of human beings could never be grasped by mechanism, and it was becoming 45. Animal Nature, pp. xvii-xviii, 18; "Reductionism," pp. 114, 117; Purpose, pp. 25-26. 46.

Eccles did acknowledge that the lack of any use for consciousness was a "problem" and that consciousness was "the primary reality"; nor did all of the neurophysiologists present agree with his estimate of the utility of consciousness.

Computing machines could never be truly analogous to minds. Mechanistic theories about the origin of life and of the cell could be expected to go the way of the concept of the reflex arc in psychology, which had earlier shown itself incompetent to account for instinctive behavior in animals. "Anyone," Thorpe wrote harshly, who stated "as a matter of conviction that the reductionist approach is the proved key to the understanding of any of these biological riddles justly exposes [himself] to being branded as a charlatan."149 Less harshly, he charged that reductive psychological behaviorism - especially in the United States, where B. F. Skinner's theories were dominant - had impeded the proper development of ethology by propagating a purely descriptive science and taking "a defeatist attitude towards epistemological problems and 'true' causal analysis and [so being] in many respects both anti-physiological and anti- psychological." 5" All reductive sciences, in Thorpe's judgment, whether mechanis- tic in a formal sense or not, shared a common fallacy that ran throughout the biological sciences - namely, the methodological abuse of the famous maxim of parsimonious theory formation known as Lloyd Morgan's canon. In its own day, early in the century, Lloyd Morgan's principle - "that one should never adopt a complex theory or formulation for a given behaviour when a 'simpler' (usually a more 'mechanical' or more physiological) one would suffice," as Thorpe put it - had done good work in promoting objectivity and reducing reliance on the anthropomor- phic anecdotal method in animal behavior studies. Since then, however, it had become a source of distraction that served to obscure new areas of inquiry. It had "come to be a real hindrance and stumbling-block to biologists in the later twentieth century." In his day, Thorpe found that "the study of perceptual synthesis, of memory, of ideation, of insightful problem-solving, and of the complexities of motivation in animals, has reached a point at which the exact opposite of Morgan's strategy often seems more promising." Thorpe charged that the canon leads scientists to deny "mental factors" in animal behavior, and to contrive the most "extraordinary circumlocutions" to avoid recognizing them. It promotes the acceptance of "clearly definable physiological inter- pretations" when, in fact, no conclusive evidence exists to justify 49.

GILLESPIE such exclusive interpretations." Parsimony, like mechanism, had its uses in science, Thorpe agreed, but the abuse of the principle, coupled with a lack of philosophical sophistication, threatened to close the door on important advancements in biology. Parsimony would be best realized by a utilization of consciousness on analogy with humans, rather than by using the complex postulations of behavioristic reduction. A NEW BIOLOGY The link between sound philosophy and fruitful work in biology was clear to Thorpe. The desire to increase biologists' awareness of the implications and assumptions of their work led him to support the widespread critique of reductionist science that had been undertaken by philosophers Karl Popper, Michael Polanyi, and others. It was a critique that Thorpe was certain could only undermine the thoughtless mechanism of so many of his fellow scientists. From Popper, Thorpe drew the insight that (in Popper's words) "we live . .. in a world of emergent evolution; of problems whose solutions, if they are solved, beget new and deeper prob- lems, ... in a universe of emergent novelty; of a novelty which, as a rule, is not completely reducible to any of the preceding stages." From Popper, too, he obtained much of the ammunition for his vigorous and tireless criticism of physical reductionism and psychological behaviorism; and, lastly, he was encouraged by Popper's "dualism": an affirmation of the reality of mind as well as of physical nature.2 Despite what Thorpe thought to be Polanyi's unwise verge toward vitalism, he took hiim to be one of the chief architects of the idea of a hierarchy of laws, some of which operate at higher levels without nullifying those lower down. It was Polanyi, Thorpe felt, as much as anyone, who had demonstrated the bankruptcy of mechanism and laid bare its dependence on nonmechanistic assumptions. It was Polanyi who had convinced Thorpe that "human knowing can only be achieved by the commit- ment of a personal will and judgement," that this was "the culmina- tion of a trend clearly evident in the course of evolution."53 51.

Thorpe 19 Heartened by the large number of philosophers and scientists whom he considered sympathetic to his point of view, Thorpe gave little attention to defenses of reductionism, dismissed such prestigious biological imperialisms as sociobiology (the triumph of which would be "a considerable disaster for biology") and molecu- larism, and argued instead for the critical importance of radically new outlooks.54 The old and sterile debate between mechanism and vitalism was completely dead. But, for Thorpe, its ghost still influenced current discussion, and prejudices stirred up by it threatened to befog important new ideas in biology: it was too easy to brush aside emergence, organicism, and other nonmechanistic concepts as "'vitalism" without considering their merits or the problems that gave rise to them. And yet facts compel us, he argued, to "believe in something like vitalism."55 In saying this, Thorpe was not suggesting the introduction into science of elements that were in principle beyond scientific analysis; instead, he claimed that science itself must grow to encompass these elements. Biology, he thought, must be developed to include the ideas of "mind," of "consciousness," and of "purposiveness" - and these must not be limited to human beings.56 The consequences of this would be revolutionary. In the new biology, "the biology of all organisms except the highest will ultimately be fully explained by physics and chemis- try," but it would not be the physics and chemistry of today - and 54. For references to thinkers to whom Thorpe was attracted, see Animal Nature, pp. 348-349, and Purpose, p. 80, among others. Thorpe thought Erwin Schrodinger's What is Life? (1944) to have been seminal in the development of new thinking in biology: see "Frontiers," pp. 2, 4. The introduction to D'Arcy W. Thompson's On Growth and Form (1917) was a text to be "read and re-read" by biologists and philosophers: Learning, p. 7.

GILLESPIE certainly not the physics and chemistry of fifty years ago, which was what most reductionists worked with. By the physics and chemistry of fifty years ago, Thorpe meant "the physics of matter en masse, the chemistry of small molecules." This would be replaced in time by a physics and chenmistry that would deal with "ordered aggregates far larger than molecules." Recent advances, he was confident, pointed toward a biochemistry and biophysics that would concentrate on emergent properties; but not even the future physics and chemistry would be capable of describing all of living nature. The new biology necessarily would be dualistic: it would acknowledge the interaction of body and mind (today a complete mystery) and extend this dualism to the higher animals. It would be structured on principles of hierarchy and emergence. Conceptually, it would be open: it would promote "creative intuition" while retaining the strength of logic and experiment. It would unite, as D'Arcy W. Thompson had required long before, "'mechanism and teleology ... interwoven together, ... their union ... rooted in the very nature of totality."' Such a holistic biology would be better able to attack the problems of the origin of life, of heredity, and of mental functioning. It would produce a more adequate epistemology, which would further undercut a mistaken total reliance on empiricism. Thorpe believed that most biologists were willing to hear about the philosophical meaning of their work even though they were not much given to philoso- phizing. But they had to be shown the practical value of a new orientation that turned away from mechanism. To these scientists Thorpe offered his own science, ethology, as a window on the biology of the future.57 ETHOLOGY As the paradigmatic and unifying science, a holistic biology would of necessity be interdisciplinary. Accordingly, Thorpe promoted interdisciplinary efforts in science as being best suited to develop avenues into that biology. Currently, the most promising fields for such cooperation he found to be "human and animal behaviour, sensory and neurophysiology, psychology and cyber- netics, communication and information theory." Already, he thought, certain human sciences - paleoanthropology and psy- 57. Biology, pp. 41-42; "Vitalism," pp. 73-74, 79-83, 96-98; "Reduc- tionism," pp. 110-1 14, 135; Learning, pp. 416-417.

Thorpe 21 chology - had sometimes gotten off track by ignoring the findings of ethology, which offered suggestive parallels between human and animal behavior. The same was true of comparative psychology, in which much pointless experimentation had been done and other work misconstrued through ignorance of the meaning of animal behavior. As this implies, Thorpe saw ethology as the model interdisciplinary science uniting into one all those approaches that were needed to understand the animal as a whole. "Ethology," he wrote, ". . . is an integrative science, in many respects essential for the full and satisfactory development of all other disciplines which are concerned with the whole animal." 58 Thorpe was particularly interested to reconcile the traditionally separate and even hostile areas of field natural history and experi- mental laboratory work, as well as the somewhat rival disciplines of psychology and neurophysiology. It was after reading the work of Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz in 1942, during the decade in which ethology first began to attract the notice of British scien- tists, that he had realized that field work and laboratory experi- ments might be combined: the former allowing scientists to observe the full range of animal behavior under natural circum- stances, the latter providing more controlled conditions for closer analysis.59 Thorpe was no less certain of the mutual dependence and intelligibility of psychology's "mental" phenomena and the "material" entities studied in neurophysiology. "It seems that what we call 'mind,'" he wrote, "has a working contact with 'matter' more intimate than one form of energy upon another."'6" Neuro- physiology, as long as it was nonreductive, was not opposed to "mind"; rather, it provided mental studies with the physical basis 58.

GILLESPIE that pure psychology often lacked. Thorpe was particularly drawn to the work of neurophysiologists such as Roger Sperry who made a functional place for consciousness in their science.6' Although it did appear, as Eccles's remark on the uselessness of consciousness to neurophysiology, taken by itself, suggested, that neurological activity was a one-way street - "from neurological states to conscious experience" - this cculd not be so. It must be a two-way street: "for if it were not so, no human being could ever develop." Thorpe agreed with Eccles that while neurological activity was a necessary condition for mental experience, it was not a sufficient one: "for even the most complex dynamic patterns played out in the neuronal machinery of the cerebral cortex are in the matter-energy world, whereas transcending this level, and in emergent relationship from it, is the world of conscious experi- ence." On a less exalted level neurophysiology had also enabled ethologists to locate complex instinctive behavioral patterns in the central nervous systems of animals, thus refuting extreme environ- mentalist and behaviorist views. Ethology, for its part, had saved neurophysiologists from the reductive belief that because birds have no brain structure corresponding to the mammalian cerebral cortex, they are virtually incapable of learning.62 Believing that learning ability in any animal species was closely tied to the devel- opment of the sense organs, the nervous system, and locomotor capacity,63 Thorpe believed that ethology was the logical synthesis of field and laboratory, of psychological learning theory and neurophysiology. It was from the hands of ethologists, then, that the final defeat of mechanism could be expected to come. In his attempt to reform biology through ethology Thorpe was not able to break completely free of behaviorism, just as he was not able totally to reject mechanism. His effort might best be thought of, then, as a quest for behavioral realism. Just as the unexpected complexity of the physical life of animals had defeated early attempts to reduce that life to simple theories based on the laws of contemporary physics and chemistry,64 so Thorpe expected 61.

Thorpe 23 the complexity of animal behavior to defeat similar attempts in that realm. A true science of animal behavior would go beyond mere description attended by reductive models of explanation. It would be a mental as well as a somatic science. Drawing on the thought of Whitehead, C. F. A. Pantin, W. E. Agar, and Ludwig von Bertalanffy, as well as on his own extensive experience, Thorpe insisted that the concept of "purposiveness" was an essential element in understanding animal behavior. He defined "purpose" as "a striving after a future goal retained as some kind of an image or idea," and (despite a somewhat con- fusing tendency occasionally to use the terms interchangeably) contrasted it with "directiveness." Most biologists saw animal behavior as directive, in the sense that natural selection had shaped it to accomplish goals that enhanced the odds for the individual's survival and reproduction. Machines were also direc- tive since they were designed to respond in certain ways when operating. But purposiveness, Thorpe felt, was a property solely of animals. No machine, however sophisticated, could have a pur- pose, even though it had a directed end.65 Purposiveness, in turn, had its origin in perception - which Thorpe, again relying on Whitehead, insisted was not merely a response to sensory stimulation, but rather was "an active organis- ing process, itself possibly including an element of purpose, tending all the time to build up the primary perceptions into more and more complete and unitary systems." As this suggests, Thorpe did not believe that all animals were purposive even though they all perceived. The detection of purposive behavior was ethology's chief task; perception, on the other hand, was universal. Percep- tion was accomplished in time and involved three elements: conation or striving, memory or comparison, and anticipation. For Thorpe, as for the Whiteheadian Agar, "a living organism is essentially something which perceives. Therefore some element of anticipation and memory, in other words some essential ability to deal with events in time as in space is, by definition, to be expected throughout the world of living things."66 There was a gradation of purposiveness in the animal kingdom. Thorpe cautioned against "assuming memory and anticipation of a far greater degree than can, in fact, possibly be occurring in the lower animals." Whitehead's philosophy did not justify such non- sense, nor did Thorpe's dualistic emphasis on mind in nature. 64. Rise of Ethology, p. 38. 65. Purpose, pp. 1 1-I 2; Learning, p. 3.

Animal communication was a case in point: Thorpe acknowledged that with many animals it was hard to tell whether deliberate communication was intended, but who could work with a chimpanzee like the famous Washoe, or even with dogs and some other higher animals, and reasonably doubt it? No "experienced and open-minded observer," he thought, could do so.67 The idea that purposive behavior existed at least in the higher animals led Thorpe to the associated belief that such purposive- ness was centralized in the nervous system but operated apart from instinctive behavior patterns. This neurally grounded, cen- tralized purposiveness, organized as a general drive, gave the animal its wholeness, its unity, and gave its learning point and direction. Hence Thorpe favored Gestalt psychology, with its emphasis on the active integration of perceptions by the animal, over the less integrative notions of simple stimulus-response and conditioned-reflex concepts associated with some behaviorists and mechanists. Gestalt psychology was more realistic in that it gave us an animal "always actively up and doing," anticipating, exploring, learning, rather than one passively being stimulated and then mechanically responding to that stimulus.68 The concept of pur- posiveness enabled Thorpe to think of animals as interacting with their environment rather than simply retacting to it. And this inter- action underscored the importance of emergent animal conscious- ness and its role in animal evolution. Mental events that were both purposive and conscious were the main challenge to biological mechanism. Because of the important role such events played in animal life, Thorpe believed that the power of mechanism to explain animal evolution was limited to those aspects which were undeniably mechanical - and con- 67.

The "principle of expectancy," in which animals seem to "expect" some appropriate action or event in a behavioral sequence, but are ignorant of the biological goal of the sequence, Thorpe identified far down the scale of life; "latent learning" - the "association of indifferent stimuli or situations without patent reward," a form of learning lacking both "normal reinforcement" and "normal motivation," he found as far down on the scale as "the higher Arthropoda": ibid., pp. 104-107.</page><page sequence="25">Natural Theology and the Ethology of W.

EVOLUTION AND CONSCIOUSNESS Thorpe saw no point in arguing the fact that the higher animals are conscious. "I ... find it essential," he wrote, "to assume something very similar to consciousness and conscious choice in many of the highest animals." Making sense of the data of ethology required such an assumption. "Only a lunatic," he thought, "could suppose that an ape is a completely unconscious machine." Given his experience, Thorpe easily extended the hypothesis of con- sciousness to other mammals and to birds.70 One of the chief evidences of animal consciousness was insight learning. This capacity varied from species to species, and even from individual to individual. (Many experiments failed because they were carried out with "dumb" subjects.) Insight learning required "a real solution of a problem, distinguishing means and ends," and one that was clearly not related either to instinct or to the slower "trial- and-error" method of learning. The manipulation of a string puzzle by wild Great Tits in Thorpe's Cambridge garden was a model of insight. Other experiments, by Thorpe and others, showed that higher animals "must possess greater powers of conceptualization than hitherto seemed credible." 71 Additional evidences of animal awareness or consciousness were ideation (which Thorpe defined as "the occurrence of per- ceptions, in the absence of the corresponding external stimulation, in the form of images which are in some degree abstract or generalized and which can be the subject of further comparison 69.

See also "Vitalism," pp. 92-93. Griffin, Animal Awareness (above, n. 51), pp. 101-102, says that most ethologists continue to hold to "an essentially behavioristic position with regard to animal behavior." So, while Thorpe was not an isolated figure in advocating animal consciousness, he was not merely following the conventions of his science. 71. W. H.

GILLESPIE and reorganisation by learning processes" 72), as well as a number sense, genuine imitation, animal "realism," and the use of language. There were numerous experimental proofs of animal ideation, despite the inherent difficulty of testing for it. Animals that "learned to learn" and proceeded in their tasks by what Thorpe called "intelligent hypothesis" provided examples that could "rea- sonably be regarded ... as involving ideation." The work of Otto Koehler showing "beyond question" the existence of a "pre- linguistic" counting ability or number sense in some birds espe- cially impressed Thorpe because of its experimental rigor. He found delayed-response or memory tests also convincing.73 As with ideation, imitation was hard to evaluate as showing consciousness because there were other possible explanations of this type of behavior: "social facilitation" in birds, or "contagious behavior," which was a sort of chain reaction based on instinct. Thorpe defined genuine imitation as "the copying of a novel or otherwise improbable act or utterance, or some act for which there is clearly no instinctive tendency." True imitation he thought revealed both self-consciousness (the ability to distinguish self from the other) and the intention to profit by the experience of another. There was no question that it occurred in apes; possibly also in cats, which seemed to be better able to learn to perform an act by watching other cats learn it. Imitative activities such as were sometimes seen in animal play also suggested self-awareness.74 Thorpe believed that mammals and birds, like people, develop a realist view of the external world "pari passu with the ability to solve new problems by conscious insight." Mentally comparing and selecting from their experience, they, like human beings, put together a perceived "real" world - that is, a world that is "coherent" and other than themselves. Some animals also show evidence of being able to tell illusion from reality, as with dogs that look behind the first mirror they ever see to find the other dog, but never thereafter show any interest in mirror images.75 For nonethologists the most familiar evidence of consciousness or mind was language. Thorpe recognized the passion with which some - his mentors Eccles and Theodosius Dobzhansky among them - defended at some point the qualitative separation of human beings from animals, and especially the tradition of regard- ing language as a uniquely human attribute. This last barrier, he 72. Learning, p. 11 8n. 73. Ibid., pp. 118-119. 74. Ibid., pp. 120-123, 411-412; W. H.

Thorpe 27 felt, was "far less defensible than heretofore" and often rested on tautology: a definition of language that necessarily confined it to humans. "Personally," he told the scientists and scholars assembled at Serbelloni in 1972, "I believe it safe to conclude that if chimpanzees had the necessary equipment in the larynx and pharynx they could learn to talk at least as well as can children of three years of age, and perhaps older."76 Looking on the ability to use language as "indubitable evidence of mentality," Thorpe believed that the recent work with chimpanzees proved the emergence of mind during the prehuman evolutionary past. But could animals other than apes use language? Did animals have languages of their own making? Thorpe argued that they did. It was true, he acknowledged, that no animal, as far as he knew, could express in language "complete general abstractions," and no animal language was "propositional, syntactic, and at the same time clearly expressive of intention," but these elements, which characterized human language, could be located individually in animal language to some extent. Such animal languages, like bird song, went beyond merely "a system of instinctive vocal signals," however short of human utterance they might fall." As he frankly admitted, Thorpe's belief in animal consciousness rested on empathy - but this, he thought, strengthened rather than weakened his position. The fatal weakness in all merely objective approaches to animal behavior was their rejection of the 76. Animal Nature, p. 301; "Reductionism," p. 129. See also "Lower Verte- brates," pp. 173-174. Thorpe had no doubt that "ape language" was genuine language and that critics of it had been satisfactorily answered: see his "Science and Man's Need for Meaning" (above, n. 19), pp. 300-301. Although both were willing to grant low-grade consciousness in some non- human animals, Eccles considered self-awareness a uniquely human attribute: see his Human Mystery (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 115-117, 121, 143-144. So did Dobzhansky: see his "From Potentiality to Realization in Evolution" in Cobb and Griffin, Mind (above, n. 17), pp. 19-24, and idem, "Two Contrasting World Views," in Lewis, Beyond Chance (above, n. 4), p. 136. At the Alpbach meeting, Thorpe told of an "argument" that he had with Eccles in which "I found him very much against any tendency to concede that animals may possess an 'experiencing self' ": see Koestler and Smythies, Beyond Reductionism, p. 256.

"A biology which succeeds in being purely objective," he insisted, ".... must fail to provide a full biological philosophy - just as a purely subjective biology would be unthink- able." Indeed, "subjective concepts derived from introspection are among the essential tools for the study of life." An adequate biology must combine these two ingredients in proper amounts and with due, mutual checks.78 Thorpe believed that some degree of subjective identification with the animal helped in understanding its behavior. Objective study was important as a first step, but after one knows "about the animal's sensory equipment and, in short, its 'world,' then a 'subjective' attitude can be of great value in designing better subsequent experiments and in knowing how to evaluate the animal's behavior." It always pays to imagine ourselves in the animal's situation "and consider what we should do in similar circumstances."79 While perhaps lacking in conventional scientific rigor, Thorpe's "if I were a horse" approach to behavioral study was not naive anthropomorphism: it was an intentional and con- sistent consequence of his belief in the emergence of conscious- ness in the course of animal evolution. It is not surprising, then, to find animal consciousness playing a major part in his explorations of emergence and biological hierarchy, and in his endorsement of the Baldwin effect (see below) in evolution theory. Thorpe's understanding of consciousness - and of self-con- sciousness, for he tended to merge the two in a continuum - was drawn from his own experience and the presumed general experi- ence of humanity. As he saw it, consciousness was "an inward awareness or sensibility"; "an awareness of self: of one's own existence"; and a sense of "unity," of 'fusion ... into a single whole." The question was how far down the animal scale these perceptions could be extended.8" The rise and development of consciousness was the heart of Thorpe's doctrine of emergent evolution. Among the higher verte- brates, consciousness had attended the increased efficiency with which biological information had been processed and transmitted from generation to generation. With the appearance of birds and, especially, mammals, animals had begun to break free of domina- tion by instinct and had acquired attributes that eventually had led 78. Learning, p. 7. 79.

H. Thorpe 29 to "the mental and spiritual life of man himself."81 Lower organ- isms seemed to be "only in a very loose and elementary sense" psychically integrated; "mind" seemed in them to be unfocused and multiple. As one came up the scale of life, this changed. In the progressiveness of evolution one could see in organisms a growing independence of the environment and, then, a growing control over it. The development of consciousness was central to this progress. A brain, Thorpe believed, is better "if it is accompanied by some form of conscious choice and conscious will."82 Human beings had much in common with other higher vertebrates. They shared with some birds, for example, number sense, the ability to mimic sounds, aesthetic sensitivity and perhaps a feeling for artistic creation, and form-sense, which was a "tendency towards an 'ideal," "a tendency to flesh out an 'imperfect form.'83 But a common animality did not mask human uniqueness. Just as conscious vertebrates represented emergence from earlier stages of evolution, so humans with their unique mental development had emerged into what was presently the highest stage of evolution. "In perception, in concept formation and in curiosity and exploration," Thorpe wrote, "the human mind seems to be essentially similar to, and to be the direct outcome of, the animal mind; and all these features have, in the animal mind, a vital part to play for the survival and evolution of the stock." Nonetheless, in consciousness, as in other emergent disjunctions in evolution, there was a true qualitative advance. A "difference of degree brings into operation new laws and requires new concepts which were previously inconceivable." Humans are different. Hard as it was to draw a definite line of demarcation, humans alone seemed to have a true moral sense, "a highly articulate and elaborate mental life," "a sense of the infinite." They were the analogue by which the lower animals could be understood, but they were only an analogy. More is different. Once again, Thorpe drew on Whitehead: "'the distinction between man and animals is in one sense only a difference of degree. But the extent of the degree makes all the difference. The Rubicon has been crossed."'84 It was this hierarchical aspect of emergence that, in the last analysis, made biological reduction impossible.85 Belief in the efficacy of consciousness led Thorpe to reject any 81.

GILLESPIE suggestion that evolution could be explained solely by activity on the molecular level. He abandoned an idea that he had once held, that DNA contained all the marching orders for ontological devel- opment, for one that stressed the importance of the individual organism's active participation in its own development and in the evolution of its group - or, at the very least, of the interaction of these two factors. Behavior, he urged, in birds and higher mammals has always been "a jump ahead of structure." Successful adaptation must have been both "mental and physical." The importance of innovative behavior, free from the constraints of instinct, could not be ignored.86 Accordingly, Thorpe helped to revive interest in the so-called Baldwin effect wherein animal choices, innovations, or preferences may precede the genetic establishment by natural selection of certain specific habits and characteristics. Thorpe acknowledged that natural selection had given a direction to animal adaptation that sometimes appeared to humans to be the product of purpose, and agreed that to see such as purpose was certainly an illusion. But, as ethology showed, there was also true purposefulness in the animal world - and that was the emergent element in evolution that biologists had neg- lected. Consciousness and purpose arose together.87 Despite his enthusiasm for animal consciousness in evolution as well as in ethology, Thorpe at times showed a noticeable reluc- tance to press the concept very far. This sprang from his con- tinuing commitment to a mechanistic approach to science and from his ambivalence toward reductionism itself. 86.

For further discussion of the Baldwin effect in the light of ethology, see Learning, pp. 256- 258. Selectionists have tended to dismiss the Baldwin effect as either wrong or insignificant (see, for example, G. G. Simpson, "The Baldwin Effect," Evolution, 7 11 9531, 110-117, and Ernst Mayr, Population, Species, and Evolution [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 19701, pp. 364-365) while, nonetheless, retaining considerable interest in the relationship between behavior and evolutionary development; see, for example, Ernst Mayr, "Behavior Pro- grams and Evolutionary Strategies," Amer. Sci., 62 (1974), 650-659, among others. There have been attempts, however, to defend the Baldwin effect with modifications: C. H. Waddington's Strategy of the Genes (London: Allen and Unwin, 1957), pp. 77-78, 104-108, 162-187, and Alister C.

Thorpe 31 In his scientific writings, even more than in his popular natural theology and other philosophical works, Thorpe faced the diffi- culty of reconciling two different discourses and achieved only an uncertain integration of holism and reductionism. He sometimes defended consciousness in animals other than humans, not as something that one clearly must accept on the evidence, but as a reasonable hypothesis. He acknowledged that it was not possible to prove within the confines of a mechanistic physiology "that a given piece of behaviour, however elaborate it appears and however much it suggests the presence of consciousness," was not "the unconscious result of a physiological mechanism....' Despite the "highly impressive" evidence in its favor, animal consciousness necessarily eluded a "final proof" that would be acceptable to holist and reductionist alike.88 Based Instructive Evolution of Macromolecules and Organs and Structures," J.

These references show that while Thorpe was willing as late as 1937 to entertain the remote possibility that acquired characters (behavior) might be inherited, by 1938 he had given it up, and that by 1945, if not earlier, his understanding of the Baldwin effect was Darwinian. Thorpe's work on olfactory conditioning in insects was cited by Julian Huxley as supporting the Baldwin effect with Darwinian mechanisms in his Evolution: The Modern Synthesis, new ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1964), pp. 303-304. What Thorpe objected to in orthodox Darwinism was the alleged passiveness of the animal under selection; hence, on occasion, he referred to his interpretation of evolution as "neo-Lamarckian" even though he recognized that "the pure Lamarekian conception has never been vindicated": Science, p. 15. That those who, like Thorpe, see orthodox natural selection as solely a case of the environment acting on a passive organism misunderstand it, is suggested by Jacques Monod, Chance (above, n. 4), pp. 125-126; but for a critique of orthodox selection theory similar to Thorpe's, see R.

GILLESPIE As a biologist, Thorpe found himself using the language and thought patterns of mechanism whether he accepted its larger implications or not. Even while defending genuine purposiveness in animals, he wrote that "in using words such as 'anticipation' and 'purpose' we need not, as biologists, consider ourselves as coming to any definite conclusion as to the relation between mechanism and mental events." Furthermore, "we are entitled to claim that when the words purpose, expectancy and anticipation are used, we are, as biologists, for the time being speaking of a mechanism which acts in given circumstances as if it were purposive, expectant or anticipatory, as the case may be, and reserving judgment on more fundamental issues."89 Hence he seemed to sanction a pragmatic abandonment of both holism and realism for a phenomenalistic methodological reductionism. In his textbook, in which he made a special point in his hortative conclusion of linking ethology to the values of his natural theology, Thorpe acknowledged that "a very large part of learning in animals is to be considered as the process of adjusting more or less fixed automatisms or patterns of behaviour and more or less rigid releasing mechanisms to the changes and chances of life...." He gave trial-and-error learning a part to play that was seemingly incompatible with an emphasis on conscious choice: "there is no instance of adaptive modification of actions, however 'insightful' and 'intelligent' it may appear, that does not comprise trial-and- error learning in at least some degree." He continued, "for trial- and-error learning ... one must have appetitive motivation ... often appearing as if governed by 'curiosity' relating to the external world." Similarly, the "impression of purposiveness or foresight," he warned, may be "subjective." He cautioned against exaggerating the significance of voice mimicry or number sense in birds. He warned against assuming that because one reductive physiological explanation failed, another "based on newer theories and the better understanding of nervous mechanisms is thereby impos- sible." He admitted the great difficulty in deciding whether a change in animal behavior was the result of learning, or biological motivation, or some sort of physiological response.90 No less striking than these apparently reductive positions was his use of Lloyd Morgan's canon, which he frequently invoked in the same way. In discussing migratory orientation in birds, he stressed the desirability of an explanation insofar as possible "in terms of known senses and sense organs" and played down the 89.

He pressed trial-and-error learning as far as it would go in bird behavior, finding it necessary "at present" to use other concepts only when trial-and-error seemed to fail. He was very cautious in interpreting imitative behavior in birds, preferring some lower category of explanation to that of true imitation. In discussing insect behavior, he wrote: "this . .. will be enough to show how very far-reaching the effects of even the simplest type of learning may be and how much one must be on one's guard against bringing in unnecessarily complex interpretations." 91 Thorpe acknowledged the growing importance of instinct and other behavioral automatisms as more was learned about animal behavior. He was inclined to believe that the recognition of individual humans by fish was only "ordinary conditioning." He concluded that an improvement in skills such as flying in birds was the result of "the growth of the nervous system" and not learning. Much mammalian behavior was, "'in fact, more rigid than many zoologists and psychologists have until recently been prepared to admit." "The effect of hormones on behaviour is well attested and profound," Thorpe wrote, even if they could not explain every- thing. Even tool-using, which once had been thought sound evidence of intelligence, was no longer to be considered so - not even in apes.92 What is one to make of this seemingly reductionist tendency in Thorpe's own work, a tendency so contrary to the spirit and the letter of his more philosophical writings? To some extent, of course, it strengthened his position regarding emergence and animal consciousness by showing him to be a competent scientist who understood the merits of methodological reduction and careful experimentalism. Thorpe did not go flying to consciousness when some lesser conception would do. But it also shows how strong the pull of scientific convention was on Thorpe's practice. While calling for a new biology, he was still very much immersed in the old. Only from the standpoint of a normative reductionism or mechanism, however, does Thorpe's overall position appear to be flatly contradictory. There were obvious tensions between the different orientations in his thought, but he could see the need for both, and the folly of seeking a single "language" for describing the 91.

GILLESPIE world.93 To a great extent, the strain in Thorpe's work came from the fact that at the same time that he was searching for evidence of emerging animal consciousness, and in so doing was descending the scale of life with one method, he was also advocating the new importance of nonlearning behavioral mechanisms such as imprint- ing, and other physico-psychological inechanisms, that required ascending the scale of life with another.94 The paradox was deepened by his belief that the emergents of life, consciousness, and self-consciousness, which were now apparently disclosed by science, might be found to be beyond the explanatory power of science as it was presently constituted and practiced.95 To what extent were these emergents as emergents really mandated by the data of science? Here Thorpe was ambivalent. Thorpe was struck by the eroding distinction between living and nonliving things. This continuum could be read either as reductive continuity or as emergent discontinuity. He had to acknowledge that many animal mechanisms seemed to be completely explicable in physicochemical terms and that "on the face of it the distinction between the non-directiveness of chemical systems and the direc- tiveness of mechanisms may not always be meaningful." He admitted that some day science might create life itself through an improved chemistry, and with it "whatever mental qualities are appropriate to its degree of organisation." He grew hesitant when faced with "the difficulty of distinguishing between 'directive' and 'purposive,' and the fact that physical systems can so readily be found and devised which simulate the behaviour and learning processes of living organisms... .."96 And yet, even if all this were granted, Thorpe still suspected that consciousness, like life itself, was sui generis. A scientist studying sentient creatures was like "a man watching a game of chess. He knows the rules of the game, and sees that they are not transgressed; but he cannot understand the game because he does not know what is in the minds of the players." Scientists may be able to explain, and even to duplicate from insentient substances, many of the mechanisms involved in mental activity, but "still as biologists we have no idea what ... 93.

As he acknowledged, one could do science, even ethology, in reductionistic terms98 - he refused to do it that way, but, save for his natural theology, it is not difficult to imagine him so doing it. Instead, the world of animal experience that he encountered from a holistic perspective was a world of mind, of spirit, of real evolutionary progress. It was a world guided by a teleological principle that imposed significant constraints on Thorpe's scien- tific practice and was, for him, the basis of many of its distinctive features, as well as supporting the criticisms that he made of mechanistic practices. Chief among the flaws that Thorpe found in the mechanistic tradition was the artificiality of laboratory experiments in animal learning. These often-misguided attempts at scientific control pro- duced animal subjects that were not "'normal,' either ethologically or neurophysiologically." Such an animal was deprived of any chance to respond in ways that would show what it could do. "To confine a highly organized animal may result in creating a moron," he complained. Only in the wild, under natural conditions, can animals demonstrate their full "behavioral repertoire." Puzzle boxes, which are designed by humans (and implicitly for humans), he said, never really make sense to a bird and are suitable only for trial-and-error testing. This did not mean that he thought labora- tory procedures useless. Quite the contrary, they could be very important when directed toward such things as Koehler's dis- covery of number sense in birds, or the degree of insightful tool- use, as in some of Thorpe's own experiments. But the animal tested out of its natural context was nearly always less than real: properly, the animal was part of a whole, a whole comprised of itself and its environment. Taking seriously the subjective experi- ence of the animal, postulating the existence of its "mind," led Thorpe to criticize reductionist models of animal learning, just as it led him to protest the abuse of Lloyd Morgan's canon. He was also led to attempt various theoretical statements that stressed the 97. Science, p. 59. See also Animal Nature, pp. 326-329. 98. "Progress," p. 318.</page><page sequence="36">36 NEAL C. GILLESPIE perceptual unity of the animal, such as the concepts of "drive" and "expectancy" in which the animal was seen as participant.99 Thorpe's fondness for formulations of the Baldwin effect neces- sarily involved critiques of reductive interpretations of natural selection, the theoretical merits of which he thought, while undeni- able, had been exaggerated or abused, and the limitations of which were generally unrecognized. Accepting of naturar selection though he was, Thorpe seemed almost pleased when he thought he had detected some difficulty with it, especially if the- problem involved its reductive form: the belief that random mutation plus natural selection explained all evolution. At Alpbach, Austria, where Thorpe chaired in 1968 an antireductionist symposium attended by some of natural selection's most outspoken critics, he did not defend the synthetic theory of evolution, even though his remarks in discussion often presupposed it. Rather, his ever- present doubts were allowed to surface, just as they did in his writings from time to time. Nature, he thought, was filled with anomalies that natural selection alone could not explain. They ranged from the origin of life, of the gene, of the cell, and of the human brain, to the long-term stability of specific characters, the behavioral complexity of bower birds, the beauty of birds of paradise, the purity of bird song, and those attributes, such as number sense in birds, which seemed to have no use in the wild. Although Thorpe seems to have become more receptive to selec- tion theory during the seventies, perhaps under the influence of Dobzhansky and Waddington, basic puzzles of this kind remained. 10( CONCLUSION It should be clear by now the extent to which many features of Thorpe's interpretation of animal behavior and of the animal mind rested, at bottom, not simply on conventional scientific proofs but on interpretive inferences, which in turn rested on a willingness to make extensions of human experience to animals.

Thorpe 37 rested on his view of evolution and his view of reality. And these were governed by his natural theology, which was the fundamental stratum of his intellectual experience. Contrary to the scientific ethos, which restricts theory choice to scientific issues alone, Thorpe's career suggests that the actual reasons for theory choice among scientists often are not limited to science, but are multiple and may sometimes be difficult to discover. It is largely because Thorpe took a public part in the natural theology enterprise that we can know something about his religious beliefs and so can see their probable influence on his scientific decisions. Similar beliefs of other scientists are some- times harder to get at. Most may be practically beyond discovery, for the ethos of science has discouraged public professions of personal belief in relation to scientific work."" Yet does it seem plausible that, for example, the restriction of self-consciousness to humans by some scientists is a purely scientific decision? 102 Surely not, any more than that the strong influence of natural theology on Thorpe's thought means that he was not a good scientist. His natural theology may have led him into incautious enthusiasms regarding the animal mind - such as the potential if unrealizable linguistic ability of chimpanzees - through a bias in favor of the continuity of emergents in a progressive evolutionary system, just as it led him to advocate animal consciousness long before the recent upsurge of interest, but the scientific integrity of his work overall is unimpeachable. And yet, that work is not comprehen- sible historically as science alone. Personal philosophy must not be discounted in writing the history of recent science. This somewhat obvious conclusion (obvious to historians of science) needs emphasis, for we are still prone to think that the sciences of our own time provide their own internal dynamic that is in itself sufficient to account for their content and development. 101. Difficulties in the reconstruction of theory choice are discussed in Michael Mulkay and G.

The issue of nonhuman animal consciousness, and especially of animal self-consciousness, may develop into a scientific controversy" involving not only questions of theory and method but - because of ties with concerns such as animal rights, animal experimentation, and ecological issues - questions of religion, philosophy, and social elements as well.
