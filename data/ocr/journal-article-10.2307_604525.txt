<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LIMITS OF SKEPTICISM* WILLIAM W. HALLO YALE UNIVERSITY Faced with limited evidence, students of the ancient Near East must choose between two alternatives: to limit the inferences they draw from it, or to treat it as a precious resource to be critically sifted as they reconstruct a total picture of antiquity. The paper attempts to weigh these alternatives dispassionately in light of specific examples. IN 1978, THE CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE convened a meeting in Paris on the subject of the archaeology of Iraq from the beginning of the neolithic period to 333 B.C.' It was subtitled "perspectives and limits of the anthropological inter- pretation of documents," and the principal Assyrio- logical contribution to the subject was made by Miguel Civil of Chicago. His paper was entitled, appropriately enough, "Les Limites de l'information textuelle" (The limits or limitations of textual in- formation).2 The paper was published in 1980, and the following year I received a copy from the author on the occasion of a visit to Chicago, with the cautionary note that I would probably find it provocative. Thus forewarned, I quickly turned to the paper on my flight home and found there only a mild critique of one of my own efforts a critique, moreover, that could be fairly easily countered.3 But what was more important, and thought-provoking rather than provocative, was Civil's insistence on the inadequacy of the cuneiform record for the task of reconstructing ancient Near Eastern history, institutions, and society. As the disciple of another Chicagoan, I. J. Gelb, I had long taken an opposite point of view: that the abundant textual documentation from Mesopotamia and its environs provides a precious resource for tracing the origins and evolution of countless facets of civilization unrivalled anywhere else on the globe for so early a period and therefore potentially valid beyond the borders of Mesopotamia, perhaps even beyond the Near East. In the perennial tug-of-war between credulity and skepsis, between maximalism and minimalism, all of us would no doubt like to stake out a place on the middle-ground of sweet reasonableness. But there is a notable lack of even-handedness on this high ground in the presumed middle. We hear, more often than not, of "healthy skepticism" or "honest doubt," of "suspension of judgment" as in the "sacramental word of skepticism" 'iT[oi' Far more rarely do we hear of a "suspension of disbelief." Belief or credulity is little more than a euphemism for gullibility; it hardly lacks for critics, while the defenders of skepti- cism are legion, from Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, who said, "A skeptic is not one who doubts, but one who examines"5 which is true enough etymologi- cally6 via Bertrand Russell's Skeptical Essays' to Richard Popkin, who has given us a whole history of skepticism.8 And yet if the textual documentation of antiquity has its epistemological limits, surely there are also * Presidential address, delivered 14 March 1989, at the Society's 199th annual meeting in New Orleans, augmented here by the remarks between notes 124 and 156. 1 L'Archeologie de l'Iraq du debut de lepoque nfolithique a 333 avant notre ere: Perspectives et limites de l'inter- pretation anthropologique des documents, Colloques Inter- nationaux du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, no. 580 (Paris: Editions du CNRS, 1980).

Before deplaning, I decided, then and there, to address this question in the context of my own research and to share my conclusions with a wider public if ever the occasion presented itself. Only you will be able to judge whether my decision was a wise one. Among Assyriologists of recent memory, the leading skeptic almost, one might say, their standard-bearer was another of my Chicago teachers, the late Leo Oppenheim. He crowned a lifetime of Assyriological contributions with his influential synthesis of ancient Mesopotamia subtitled "portrait of a dead civiliza- tion."9 But in the pages of this very book, and elsewhere, he was forever cautioning against the dan- gers of synthesizing from partial (or partisan) evi- dence,10 forever repeating the warning "we do not know. " " But if he was saying, in effect, caveat lector, "let the reader beware," he was basing himself on the implied premise of ignoramus, "we do not know"-when the truth is more subtle. Perhaps we do not know yet, but future discovery will reveal; or perhaps we do not know, but the ancient sources did, and will let us in on their knowledge if we choose to read between the lines; or again, we may not know but possibly we can frame a working hypothesis that approximates ac- curate knowledge. Surely these and other optimistic qualifications of our supposed ignorance have inspired the great lexico- graphic projects in Assyriology, including the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, which is Oppenheim's greatest legacy to the field. Why should they not apply equally to other syntheses of knowledge, based on the texts and therefore indebted to modern lexicography and only slightly less fundamental to our understanding? Let me turn, then, to one of these other areas, namely that of history, and let me begin more particularly with political history, arguably the framework on which all other exploitation and integration of the textual data ultimately rest. Oppenheim himself stoutly resisted the temptation to avail himself, as he put it, of "the traditional prerogative of the Assyriologist to write a history" of Mesopotamia."2 He regarded Assyriology and histori- ography as two distinct crafts, each requiring its own expertise, and presumably difficult if not impossible to combine in one person. Perhaps he had in mind a collaboration between Assyriologist and historian on the analogy of the eminently successful collaboration with legal history exemplified by Landsberger and Koschaker, or with the history of science as illustrated by "the spectacular successes in the interpretation of cuneiform texts dealing with mathematics and as- tronomy."13 Or perhaps he hoped for an Eduard Meyer, who truly combined historical and philological expertise in consummate measure. Neither of these alternatives has, however, ma- terialized. Instead, we have today the new edition of the Cambridge Ancient History a congeries of au- thoritative but disparate chapters essentially devoid of any unifying, overarching interpretation of the historic continuum, unless it be that they all (more or less) adhere to the same (middle) chronology a chron- ology, however, already under some challenge today.'4 We have, of course, also more unitary monographic treatments, for example by Georges Roux"5 and by H. W. F. Saggs." My own effort, now nearly twenty years old, was inspired by the brashness of youth and the doubtful merit of an undergraduate major in history." It did, however, presume to chart a new path in at least one direction: to correlate the grand divisions of Mesopo- tamian political and cultural history with those of the ancient Near East and, indeed, of the whole ancient world generally, and to do so, however subtly, by appeal to the archaeological chronology and termi- nology that had previously been the only serious 9 A.

"Without our knowing who delivered and who received, [etc.], administrative texts yield only a meager harvest" (p. 25).

In using the concepts of the successive stages of the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages not only for the prehistoric but also for the fully historic periods of the ancient Near East, I opted at the same time for a somewhat more literal understanding of these terms, while leaving it to the historians of metallurgy to furnish their archaeological and documentary underpinnings. This was done most systematically by James Muhly. In his Yale thesis, published in 1973, he assembled the data without explicitly drawing my specific conclusions from it;'8 in subsequent publications, he has both moved closer to them and modified them significantly.'9 Another limitation that skepticism has tended to impose on the reconstruction of ancient Near Eastern history relates to the utilization of purely literary sources. In an article entitled "Egyptology and histori- cal method," Gun Bjorkman argued the negative of this proposition forcefully.20 In my remarks on "Su- merian historiography," I attempted, on the contrary, "to test the validity of the proposition that literary sources may be used, with due caution, in historio- graphical reconstructions."2 And the idea to which my monographic history aspired was similar. As pro- claimed in the preface, it was to treat the ancient sources critically but without condescension; to write, in effect, "not only a history but a commentary on ancient history and historiography."22 In subsequent publications, I have continued to pursue this ideal, along with its corollary: we should not expect to know more than the ancient sources knew, but we can hope to know more than they chose to tell.23 In pursuit of these goals, I have carefully identified and separated the categories and genres of the sources, but combined them again to form the best available reconstruction of the past. The older or simpler judgment that contemporaneous sources are almost invariably preferable to later, literary ones, has yielded to a finer discrimination: a critical sifting of the contemporaneous evidence, especially the royal monu- ments, in order to penetrate behind their propagan- distic tendencies, on the one hand, and on the other hand a new respect for the authentic core contained in the "historical tradition." Granted that this puts me at odds with Erica Reiner, Jerrold Cooper24 and other leading authorities, nevertheless in a forthcoming paper on the death of kings, I have reexamined elements of that tradition and salvaged at least some of them for history.25 To cite just one example, the chronicle text accord- ing to which King Erra-imitti died from eating scald- * 26 ing soup may certainly be questioned, as well as that his successor Enlil-bani2' represented a "substitute" who took his place during an eclipse or other ominous period-but the tradition may be telling us (indirectly) that he represented a new dynasty at Isin. If so, it allows us to correct the impression of unbroken dynastic continuity conveyed and intended to be conveyed by the royal inscriptions28 and to clarify 18 Copper and Tin, Transactions 43 (New Haven: Connecti- cut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1973), 155-535.

If canonical literary sources thus play a major part in the reconstruction of political history, it is only fair that the compliment be returned when dealing with literature. The reconstruction of cuneiform literature is still very much in progress, but like the reconstruc- tion of Mesopotamian history it must go hand in hand with the application of critical techniques. We cannot wait for the recovery of all the Sumerian or Akkadian, Hittite or Ugaritic canon before applying to its emerging components some of the insights of literary criticism generally. In Assyriology, this has happened only very slowly. Bendt Alster has subjected some Sumerian compositions to structural analysis;31 Henri Limet32 and Piotr Michalowski33 have touched on the possibilities of Sumerian poetics, each from a different perspective, and Erica Reiner has done the same for Akkadian poetry.34 But who has tackled the larger issue of the history of cuneiform literature? Is that really premature? It is, if we are again to believe Oppenheim. "The literary history of Mesopotamia," he argues, "cannot be more than outlined, and it is open to serious doubt--and I am inclined here to side with the skeptics-whether enough material is available to embark on the venture of writing such a history."35 Undaunted by such counsels of despair, I have ventured, nevertheless, to make some programmatic efforts in this direction. I adopted W. G. Lambert's concept of canonicity, but not all the limitations he imposed on the possible parallel provided by "the canonizing of Jewish and Christian Scriptures. " 36 Granted that the process of canonizing cuneiform literature involved none of the overtones of theological authority, of divine inspiration, or of sanctity attached to sacred scripture,37 I could not follow Lambert in rejecting, as well, any "suggestion of a systematic selection of literary works, nor of a conscious attempt to produce authoritative editions of works which were passed on."38 Rather, I developed the notion of a canon that was approximately the equivalent of the official curriculum of the scribal schools at any given time. I have delineated four successive canons in the Sumero-Akkadian tradition and attempted to cor- relate them with the general chronology of political and cultural history.39 A much more restrictive notion of canonicity is defended, chiefly on the basis of the later astrological tradition, by Francesca Rochberg- Halton,40 but I stand by mine and in another recent 4 1 paper have defended it anew. And one more analogy between literary criticism and historiography. Just as it is necessary to classify and separate the categories and genres of documenta- tion before recombining them to complete the histori- cal data-base, so the erection of a historical framework no. 10: The Last Years of the Kings of Isin," JNES 18 (1959): 57 and n. 36. 29 The King List ceases to indicate filiation beginning with Erra-imitti. 30 YOS 14:321 i 16f.; cf. ibid, 21 and "The Death of Kings," (above n. 25), n. 108. 31 E.g., Dumuzi's Dream: Aspects of Oral Poetry in a Sumerian Myth, Mesopotamia 1 (Copenhagen: Akademisk Forlag, 1972), ch. 3. 32 "Essai de poetique sumerienne," in Kramer Anniversary Volume, ed.

In the literary criticism currently in fashion, such inter- dependence generally goes by the name of inter- textuality, but this concept has barely (need I say it) found its way into Assyriology-H. J. Vanstiphout and, again, Reiner and Michalowski excepted. Pro- verbs particularly lend themselves to such study, since they are largely independent of chronological or geo- graphic boundaries, even of writing itself. Thus I was able to trace a Sumerian proverb, "In the city of the lame, the halt is courier," via Rabbinic and classical intermediaries to its modern equivalent, "In the coun- try of the blind the one-eyed man is king." William Moran and others have done likewise with the Ak- kadian proverb, "The bitch in her haste gave birth to blind puppies," and it is pertinent to cite Bendt Alster in this connection, who said, "To deny the possibility that the similarity between the Akkadian and Greek proverbs under discussion may be more than inci- dental, would be to drive skepticism too far."42 In a paper first delivered to this Society, I systematically studied the question of proverbs quoted in epic within the neo-Sumerian canon;43 since then I have extended the search to other genres and other periods. Take for example the famous dictum by which Hammurapi justified the promulgation of his laws: dannum ensam ana la habalim, "so that the strong might not oppress the weak." This can be traced back to the Sumerian rulers Uruinimgina and Shulgi of the third millennium, and forward to Sargon II, Assurbanipal and Darius I in the first millennium in a manner that suggests true literary interdependence." The millennial interconnections between the various cuneiform canons uncovered by literary history are only a special case of a more general phenomenon namely that Mesopotamia, and the Asiatic Near East generally, is a veritable hotbed of bilingualism or multilingualism. The very name Mesopotamia from Akkadian birit ndrim, although originally referring to "that territory surrounded on three sides by the great bend of the Euphrates,"45 ultimately came to be interpreted as the land between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, and as a metaphor for the two cultural and more specifically linguistic traditions that domi- nated its early history.46 So we turn briefly to linguistic history, or at least one of its recurrent debates: when did Akkadian replace Sumerian as the spoken lan- guage of (lower) Mesopotamia? Here the skeptics are led by F. R. Kraus47 and, again, Cooper.48 They want incontrovertible proof for the survival of Sumerian beyond the third millennium, or even its third quarter. Such proof can, in fact, be offered from a whole variety of indications, such as the use of Sumerian in non-formulaic contexts like court depositions, "per- sonal" correspondence, and "descriptive rituals." Marvin Powell has recently added an argument from silence in this case "the absence of (such) textbooks in the Akkad and Ur III periods [which] points to the living character of the Sumerian language and the vitality of Sumerian oral tradition in the schools."49 But the real question here is one of methodology. Is there really a foolproof verification of the character of an ancient speech situation? How shall we proceed to prove that the Romans spoke Latin, or the Israelites Hebrew? Or how are we to date the change to Italian, or to Aramaic? Without a general methodology, it is hardly right to put the whole burden of proof on one side of the question or the other. Having invoked the name of Kraus, we may move on to the area of social, legal, and economic history where Kraus is an acknowledged master. But once more, while in practice he has given us some of the most insightful syntheses in these areas, he preaches a kind of scholarly abstinence or at least reticence. His reviews deal harshly with all who would cross the sacred line between the self-evident and the inferential (Moortgat, Szlechter, Ellis, Sigrist),50 and his own 4 W. W.

Skepticism may have scaled its zenith when he declared, "With the best will in the world, it is impossible for the conscientious Assyriologist, where ancient Mesopotamia is concerned, to do justice to the theme of this conference in a manner that would remotely begin to satisfy the most modest of prerequi- sites of current economic history." This is the opening sentence of his contribution to a conference on State and Temple Economy in the Ancient Near East held in Louvain in 1978.51 Yet his own presentation to that conference, and many of the other contributions, belied his pessimism. If my estimate is correct that cuneiform texts provide the most abundant archival documentation before the European Middle Ages, when or where on earth are we to go to reconstruct the society, the law, or the economy of a given culture if we cannot do it for the ancient Asiatic Near East? As Gelb was fond of saying, "We will never know what was the nectar and ambrosia of the gods until we have figured out the rations of the common man." One need not share Gelb's disdain for the study of canonical texts what he liked to put down as "edub- bology" and "Kuyunjikology" to appreciate his flair for what, in his own presidential address to this Society, he called "onionology" the opportunity to extrapolate from the simple onion archives or "laun- dry lists" in cuneiform to the whole socio-economic structure of pre-classical antiquity.52 In the same address, devoted to "approaches to the study of ancient society," he particularly championed "the archi- val approach,"53 and I trust he was pleased when, only two years later, I reviewed ten Yale (and HUC) theses in the area of "temple, state and private enter- prises"54 to the delight also of colleagues such as Robert M. Adams. Adams has often argued that- with all due respect for Assyriology and Assyriolo- gists-we lavish too much time and attention on the textual documentation that has happened to survive by whatevei accidents, instead of looking for evidence that may not be in documentary form, or asking why it isn't. But before my survey, he had been unaware of what might almost be called the Yale school of archival studies, and subsequently he made grateful use of a number of that "school's" writings.55 I may note here particularly the work of Norman Yoffee, since it has been both attacked and defended" in the Journal of the Society, and since it turns precisely on the issue of waiting for all the evidence before formu- lating models. Meantime, the number of theses employing the archival approach has almost doubled, with significant dissertations published by Nemet-Nejat58 and van de Mieroop,59 others completed but not yet published, and still others well begun. While this kind of activity is going on in the major collections of cuneiform archives, excavations in the field continue to expand the corpus, with the most notable augmentation coming currently from Syria, the home of ancient Marl, Ebla, Terqa, Emar, Shubat-Enlil and other sites just beginning to yield up their secrets. Must we wait until all the evidence is in before we construct hypotheses? Or can we not rather base such hypotheses on the data already in hand and analyzed and then modify the hypotheses in light of subsequent discoveries? I would argue that we not only can, we must! In my graduate student days at Chicago, I formulated my theory of a monthly system of obligatory contributions to the national shrine at Nippur by the central provinces of the Ur III Empire, on the basis of 100 out of the 550 months between 2068 and 2026 B.C. for which such contributions were altbabylonische Buchhaltung aus einem Amtsarchiv in Nip- pur," BiOr 42 (1985): 526-41. 5' Kraus, "Der 'Palast', Produzent und Unternehmer im Konigreiche Babylon nach Hammurabi (ca. 1750-1600 v.

We are thus led subtly but inexorably into the treacherous area of the cult and of religion generally. Once more it was Oppenheim who explained "[w]hy a 'Mesopotamian Religion' should not be written."63 Earlier, Henri Frankfort had expressed similar doubts, if more gingerly, about the possibility of writing a history of ancient Egyptian religion. In his view, "It may one day be possible to write a history of Egyptian religion describing the changes which it underwent in the course of time. At present we are still endeavoring to recognize what was the subject of those changes. Before tracing the history we should establish the identity of Egyptian religion. "64 For Egypt, the effort has since been made by Siegfried Morenz65 among others. For Mesopotamia, the methodological limitations for reconstructing the history of religion were clearly delineated by B. Hruska,66 but Oppenheim's challenge was nonetheless taken up, most vigorously by Thorkild Jacobsen, who subtitled his Treasures of Darkness "a history of Mesopotamian religion."67 Baruch Levine and I found valuable data in genres ignored by Oppenheim such as the so-called "descriptive ritu- als."68 But here I again prefer to draw my illustration from the historical dimension. The millennial docu- mentation of Mesopotamia in this case artifactual as well as textual allows us to reconstruct not only the structure of the cult but its evolution over time. As Agnes Spycket has shown, the practice of worshipping the deity in the guise of a life-size, anthropomorphic statue was an innovation of the late third millennium in Mesopotamia.69 After considering the implications of this insight for the comparable Israelite situation, I have more recently inquired into the possible reasons for the innovation itself and seen it as a reaction to the emergence of the cult of the deified king in high Sargonic times.70 If this correlation proves correct, it will provide the religious dimension with the same kind of link to the framework of political history that was previously argued for the literary one." Having followed me thus far, you will permit me, finally, a glance at one of the most controversial of all the battlegrounds between maximalists and mini- malists, that of Biblical history. Here we must tread warily, lest respect for the Biblical record be equated with belief in Biblical teachings, or skepticism with disbelief.72 Surely such need not, should not, and most often in fact will not be the case. The Biblical record must be, for this purpose, scrutinized like other historiographical traditions of the ancient Near East, neither exempted from the standards demanded of those other traditions, nor subjected to severer ones than they are. On this basis, I have plunged into the 60 "The Ensi's of the Ur III Dynasty" (M. A. thesis, University of Chicago, 1953), 90f.; "A Sumerian Amphi- ctyony," JCS 14 (1960): 88-114. 61See especially M.

Alberto Soggin, to that of the United Monarchy.73 There is clearly a case to be made for assigning the major subdivisions of Genesis respectively to the realms of prehistory (the primeval history), proto- history (the patriarchal narratives) and late (perhaps seventh century) novella (the "romance of Joseph"). But one cannot deal likewise with Exodus and the rest of the "Triteuch" (Leviticus and Numbers) or their multiple echoes in the balance of Scripture. Unless one rearranges the Biblical evidence completely, like Sean Warner,74 or utilizes it eclectically as Norman K. Gottwald has essentially done with his reinterpreta- tion,75 one can hardly deny the reality of a conquest from abroad, implying a previous period of wander- ings, a dramatic escape from the prior place of residence and an oppression there that prompted the escape. The existence of a collective entity known as Israel is attested before the end of the thirteenth century by the stele of Merneptah and this text, though long known, is now better understood in light of newly identified parallels.76 At the same time, the name of the pharaoh, long recognized in Biblical toponymy,77 has now been identified in Biblical meta- phor at least if the hornet (fircd) that paved the way for the Israelite conquest can be equated, following Oded Borowski, with Merneptah's Egypt (misrdyim).78 I therefore hold to my position in spite of Soggin's pained rebuttal79 and am gratified to see it noted among models for Israelite historiography by Jack Sasson80 and Abraham Malamat.8' It is time to sum up. But once again I prefer specific illustration to vague ratiocination. And what better illustration than the Deluge, that well-nigh universal literary topos or folkloristic motif, as Alan Dundes has conveniently if somewhat unevenly shown in his new compendium.s Here, surely, is a theme that separates the believers from the doubters. The be- lievers, who can here perhaps justifiably be labelled literalists, consider the Flood in the various cuneiform sources as an authentic historic event and argue only about what kind of flood these sources may be describing fluvial, pluvial, alluvial, aeolian or other- wise. They look to the archaeologists for "the physical evidence of Noah's flood,"84 and find it conveniently at Shuruppak and Kish, the seats of kingship immediately before and immediately after the flood, respectively, in the historiographic sources. The skeptics, by contrast, ignore the Flood altogether, justifying this ignoring by ignorance i.e., not know- ing what to make of diluvian allusions in the sources.8' Beyond this, the Flood is an apt illustration to sum up our discussion because it touches on all, or nearly all, the areas we have traversed. From the point of view of the political history of Mesopotamia, the great Flood is the watershed between proto-history and history, between antediluvian and postdiluvian times or, in native terms, between lam abiibi and arki abuibi.86 We can even correlate it with archaeological 7 Hallo, "Biblical History in its Near Eastern Setting," in Scripture in Context: Essays on the Comparative Method, ed.

But it evolves into a prescription, on Anne Kilmer's interpretation94 (followed by Elizabeth Carter95), for population control. In its ultimate form, it becomes a simple, albeit dramatic, paradigm for divine caprice, for retribution unmotivated by any particular human delict. Finally, in terms of Biblical history, the Flood is a paramount example of a Mesopotamian motif appro- priated into the primeval history-given the fact that flooding is a common occurrence in the Mesopo- tamian plain, but unheard of in the Canaanite setting. But appropriation here and elsewhere is not misappro- priation, as I have argued previously,96 even when the Biblical author uses not only the concept but virtually the Akkadian terminology, as in Psalm 29:10 where God is described, in my reading, as "enthroned before (the) flood" (lammabbil ydaab).97 The linguistic approach may also be the clue to a proper understanding of the Mesopotamian concept. That concept, like the related one of the storm, is frequently employed in a purely metaphoric sense. Flood and storm alike are expressions of divine displeasure. But that displeasure, though expressed in natural terms, may be carried out by human agency. Examples abound. "Sumerian literature often com- pares the invasion of Semitic nomads to a storm," said J. J. M. Roberts in reference to the deity Amurru,98 citing D. 0. Edzard.99 As for the flood, the familiar phrase, "after the flood had swept (there)over," occurs, with reference to the Deluge, not only at the beginning of the Sumerian King List,'00 and of its 87 ANEH (above note 17): 34-7.

Ac- cording to Thorkild Jacobsen, the Ishme-Dagan pas- sage refers to the fall of Ur'06 and, according to Jan van Dijk, the allusion in Ur-Ninurta's hymn is to catastrophes immediately preceding his accession.' But when a flood is alluded to in other terms than this topos, it seems clearly to be a metaphor for cataclysms in subsequent history. Already Eannatum of Lagash in the middle of the third millennium (ca. 2454-2425 B.c.) refers to his own actions'08 or perhaps those of his nearest and dearest enemy, the city-state of Umma,'09 as a flood in his famous Stele of Vultures. The fall of Ur at the end of the millennium was anticipated by its contemporaries employing the flood metaphor in the usually prosaic medium of the date formula. The antepenultimate date of its last king reads, in Edmond Sollberger's translation, "Year &lt;in which&gt; Ibbi-Sin, the king of Ur, (when) a flood (a- ma-ru) decreed by the gods had blurred the boundaries of heaven and earth, caused Ur to weather out the storm.""0 Later generations expanded on the theme. In the Lamentation over Sumer and Ur, the fall of Ur is described thus (in Kramer's translation): "On that day, Enlil brought down the Guti from the mountain- land, whose coming is the Flood of Enlil, that none can withstand."' ' ' l The topos could be pursued into Akkadian"2 and even into Hebrew literature,"3 but I forebear to do so, and hope that you are ready to grant the metaphoric interpretation of the great Flood, if only on the ground that it is better to be symbolic than diabolic, to throw things together than to throw them apart, if we may speak etymologically with Eugene Rochberg- Halton.1 14 How then are we to resolve the metaphor? Which specific human agency is symbolized by the Flood? Elizabeth Carter has suggested that it is the destruction or breakdown of the irrigation system,"5 but I doubt 101 E.

As with the hornet of the Israelite conquest,"' here, too, the linguistic approach comes to our help. The Sumerian term for flood is pronounced uru or maru or amaru or even amarru"17 and is thus a near homophone for the Sumerian ethnicon marru or mardru,"8 Akkadian amurru,"' the designation of the semi-nomadic Semitic-speaking elements who des- cended on the urban centers of Mesopotamia from a presumed home in the Syrian desert in successive waves starting at the beginning of the third mil- lennium. Because their route of access into the valley was along the courses of Euphrates and Tigris, it could very well have been symbolized in the Sumerian imagination by the metaphor of a fluvial flood, bring- ing destruction downstream along the otherwise life- giving rivers. With this new twist, the connection first made 65 years ago by W. F. Albright"O between the Sumerian terms for flood and Amorites receives new credibility, and the metaphoric interpretation of the Sumerian flood advocated by Adam Falkenstein,"2' van Dijk"' and others can be defended against the doubts expressed at their most pungent by Cooper: "In view of the universality of the flood motif, one must be highly skeptical of the attempt to interpret that motif in Mesopotamia as a metaphor for hordes of invading Semites."'23 That later and other cultures chose to understand the concept literally is simply another illustration of the dangers of a static interpre- tation of the evidence or, if you prefer, of the impor- tance of the historical dimension in assessing it.124 More specifically, we must cease to regard Meso- potamian ideology as monolithic, and to speak of "the Mesopotamian view" of this or that matter. Meso- potamian unity was an ideal that was translated into reality only relatively rarely and briefly on the political level,'25 at least before the fifteenth century.'26 The "intermediate periods" of petty-statism tended to be longer than the sporadic experiments in imperialism that they "interrupted." 127 In literature too, local loyalties and competing traditions can be detected beneath the veneer of imperial ideology propagated by the royal chanceries' and by the scribal school founded under royal auspices at the national religious capital of Nippur.'29 Certainly Nippur (and Ur) pro- vided the dominant ideology as reflected, for example, in the royal hymns'30 and royal correspondence"' of Ur. In Old Babylonian times, Isin perpetuated this ideology through these genres and others.

And while the Nippur scribes either suppressed the Lagash traditions or reshaped them to their own predilections, '33 the scribes of the royal chancery at Old Babylonian Larsa strove to maintain them and to use them as models for celebrating their own royal patrons.'34 In respect to the Deluge, they were at first content to follow the Nippur tradition, treating it as a starting point of history and as a metaphor and prelude for the dramatic entrance of their presumed ancestors on the stage of history, if the "Lagash King List" can be attributed to the scribes of Larsa. (They thus provide another analogy to Biblical historiography, whose starting point, as we have seen, was arguably the watery metaphor of the Exodus.)'35 A later (?) Larsa tradition went so far as to insert a spurious dynasty of Larsa into the roster of ante- diluvian kings immediately after an initial dynasty of HA. A. KI. 36 But a third tradition eventually replaced those of Isin and Larsa, and it rejected their metaphoric view of the Flood. This is the tradition of Eridu, maintained after the Isin-Larsa period by the third major dynasty of Old Babylonian times, that of Babylon itself. In this tradition-not surprisingly-Eridu played a cen- tral role. The starting-point of history was moved back by at least eight "generations" and countless millennia to the founding of Eridu, the first city-a tradition also echoed in the Hebrew Bible.'37 Its chief deity, Enki, became the father of Marduk of Baby- lon'38 and challenged the supremacy of the "chief executive" of the Sumerian pantheon,'39 Enlil of Nippur.'40 The flood was transformed from metaphor to reality in the Sumerian Flood Story, more properly designated, with Jacobsen, as "The Eridu Genesis."' An antediluvian section was prefixed to the Sumerian King List, which now not only began with Eridu, but in some recensions even included Babylon and Larsa as eternal cities of antediluvian vintage, however improbable the claims.'42 The motivation for these transformations are ob- scure, but a guess may already be hazarded. The royal houses of Isin, Larsa and Babylon were all alike of Amorite descent. But Isin chose to insist on its Sumerian or Sumero-Akkadian character as supposed heir to the Sumerian traditions preserved from the beginnings of history (or of kingship and urbanism, which amounted to the same thing) to the fall of Ur."43 And although the earlier members of the Larsa dynasty may have functioned under such ambiguous 132 Hallo, "Beginning and End of the Sumerian King List in the Nippur Recension," JCS 17 (1963): 52-57; cf.

And Amorites were recognized as an official constituent of the realm on a par with its Akkadian population by the Edict of Ammi-saduqa and its duplicate or parallel.'52 Given such official recognition of their Amorite origins and subjects, the kings of Babylon, and their scribes, may have felt that it was time to abandon the not altogether flattering equation of Amorites and the Flood. The equation was, after all, no more than a metaphor based on an, at best, approximate assonance in Sumerian. The assonance, or play on words, could not survive in Akkadian, where new metaphoric mean- ings were assigned to the flood.'53 The Amorite kings of Babylon became patrons of a whole new corpus of literature in Akkadian. 154 They could thus readily have ordained a new and literal interpretation of the flood, beginning with the Atar-hasis epic, aptly de- scribed as "the Babylonian story of the flood" by Lambert and Millard.'55 This composition, in turn, may have inspired the Sumerian story of the flood, if we are to believe Civil that the latter was written, and perhaps composed, no earlier than the Late Old Babylon period.'56 To return, then, to that other premise of Civil with which we began: yes, the textual documentation is limited. But the conclusion we draw from this premise is very different from his. We are not to limit the inferences we extract form the evidence, but to treat the evidence, precisely because it is limited, as a precious resource-none of it to be ignored, or squan- dered, but every fragmentary bit of it critically sifted, so that it fits into our reconstruction of the history of antiquity-much as the archaeologist must use every surviving potsherd to reconstruct and restore a frag- mentary vessel. The history so reconstructed-be it political or literary, linguistic or socio-economic, reli- gious or Biblical-will then be true to its textual documentation. However limited that documentation may be, the only limits it imposes on us are to set reasonable limits to our own skepticism. sar Era and Other Epochs in Mesopotamian Chronology and Chronography" (above, note 91), 175-90, esp. pp. 178-83. 144 rabian Amurri; cf.
