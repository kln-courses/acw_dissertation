<plain_text><page sequence="1">Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse Ingrid Piller English Language and Culture, Hamburg Abstract This article investigates the use of extended metaphor in automobile fan discourse. It starts out with a definition of extended metaphor as literary, consciously sustained metaphor, and goes on to redefine it as consciously sustained but not ex- clusively literary; extended metaphor can also be found in consumer discourse. The article proceeds to describe the body of automobile fan discourse, its text types and communicative functions. Next, the article gives an overview of the most frequently used metaphorical concepts by which cars are represented. Particular attention is paid to those concepts that humanize or animate the car. Against this background, a text from the magazine Car &amp;Driver that lobbies against safety legislation for sport utility vehicles is then analyzed. It is shown that the author skillfully employs two extended metaphors to argue his cause: CARS ARE CREATURES, THESE CREATURES ARE MALTREATED, and CONSUMER RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE MALTREATERS OF CARS. These con- cepts are sustained throughout the text through both lexical choices and grammati- cal patterns. It is shown that the metaphorical concept THE CAR IS HUMAN/ANIMATE is a powerful tool of the ideology of automobilism that is consciously drawn upon and reinforced in a specific text. Since the 1980 publication of George Lakoff and MarkJohnson's Metaphors We Live By, metaphor has mainly been studied as a cognitive phenome- non, and everyday language has been concentrated upon.' Literary and I would like to thank Monika Fludernik, Donald Freeman, Meir Sternberg, and an anony- mous reader for Poetics Today for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article. 1. The articles in Goossens et al. 1995 and the ordinary-language metaphors studied there provide some recent examples of this focus. Poetics Today 20:3 (Fall 1999) Copyright ? 1999 by the Porter Institute for Poetics and Semiotics.</page><page sequence="2">484 Poetics Today 20:3 ordinary-language metaphors have basically been regarded as one and the same phenomenon (see, e.g., Lakoff and Turner 1989). In this view, meta- phor is "a mapping of a source conceptual schema ... onto a target con- ceptual schema" (Turner 1991: 52). Paul Werth (1994), however, recently argued that there is a difference not only in degree but in kind between lit- erary and ordinary-language metaphors. While the basic machinery and constraints of metaphor are the same for both types, he argues that there are two important differences: 1. Literary metaphor is characterized by "the occurrence of sustained metaphor through a single text" (Werth 1994: 84; italics in the origi- nal). 2. The producer of ordinary-language metaphor often has no other choice because there is no nonmetaphorical language to express cer- tain abstract facts. The producer of literary metaphor, on the other hand, consciously employs metaphors to embellish the text and to add further meaning, "where using a metaphor allows the topic to be viewed simultaneously from more than a single perspective" (Werth 1994: 84). "Extended metaphor" can thus be defined as literary (as opposed to ordinary-language) metaphors that are consciously (as opposed to out of ne- cessity) sustained throughout a text or discourse (as opposed to isolated use). Werth (1994: 84) contends that this type of metaphor is an exclusive prop- erty of literary texts. He also has a footnote that draws attention to the use of sustained metaphor in advertising. That advertising should make use of sustained metaphor, too, does not come as a surprise, as the similarity between literature and modern consumer advertising has frequently been noted. Guy Cook (1992: 228), for instance, observes similarity along two dimensions: just like literature, many ads "represent fictional situations and scenes, and demand the same technical skills as other arts." In the following, I will argue two points: first, extended metaphor is in- deed different from ordinary-language metaphor and may be employed to serve rhetorical purposes; second, the use of extended metaphor is not restricted to literature but can also be found in other genres whose communicative aim is persuasive. The genre I will concentrate upon is- like advertising-a phenomenon of modern consumer society: popular- ized expert-to-non-expert communication, specifically automobile fan dis- course. The following example shows that extended metaphor can be found in automobile fan discourse: Mustang adopts modern V8 ... Mondeo demand soars Trad American V8 under threat</page><page sequence="3">Piller * Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse 485 Detroit streets are growing quieter as the era of rumbling pushrod engines comes to a close. Big capacity pushrod V8s and V6s are being superseded by a new generation of overhead cam units. According to a new survey, the pushrod share of the engine market is forecast to decline to 41 per cent by 2000, a drop of 20 per cent over 1994. Even pick-up trucks, the strongest bastion of pushrod engines, are switching over. Only GM is bucking the trend, arguing that pushrod engines are significantly cheaper to produce, and most customers either do not know or care about the difference. Ford is gambling that buyers do care and is equipping its Mustang with a brand-new 32-valve 4.6-litre dohc V8. In contrast GM's rival muscle car, the Pontiac Trans-Am, soldiers on with a pushrod 16-valve 5.7-litre V8 that dates from the '6os. However, both kick out a healthy 305bhp. (McCormick 1995: 9)2 The text's overall metaphors-CARS ARE CREATURES, PUSHROD ENGINES ARE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES-are never overtly expressed, but the indi- vidual surface metaphors reveal this "underground metaphor" (Werth 1994: 85): an animal designation is used as the name of the car, Mustang. The image of the car as horse is further reinforced by the use of the verb to buck (although it is not used for the car itself here). The car name, Mustang, is beyond the control of the writer but was actively chosen by Ford's mar- keting experts. In this particular instance of automobile fan discourse, the writer is drawing on the metaphorical name AMustang, which automobile discourse--in the sense of an institutional body of knowledge and prac- tices- has on offer. Unlike a machine, the car is able to act in a way typical of animals or humans: it obviously has free will as it can adopt one en- gine or switch over to another, rival another car, soldier on, and kick out brake horsepower. The car is characterized by attributes typical of creatures and is subjected to influences on nature: it has muscles instead of parts and may therefore be healthy. Being subject to the natural life cycle of reproduction, it is superseded by a new generation. All these metaphors, even the dead ones in overhead, to buck the trend and muscle car, which is a technical term, contrib- ute to the picture of environmental concern: a creature is under threat. That it is a traditional American "animal" may be cause for even deeper concern. The text shows how extended metaphor is skillfully used in automobile fan discourse to present new engines as an environmental concern. The text shows how automobile fan discourse appropriates the ideology (see Fairclough 1989: 2) of the environmental movement. With the automo- bile as one of the greatest environmental problems, this propaganda feat is an enormous achievement that would be impossible without metaphor. With Paul Ricoeur (1977: 7), I regard metaphor as "the rhetorical process by which discourse unleashes the power that certain fictions have to re- describe reality." While I do not wish to endorse the redefinition of the 2. Here and elsewhere: if not stated otherwise, the emphasis in the quotes is mine.</page><page sequence="4">486 Poetics Today 20:3 machine car as part of nature myself, this redefinition certainly works in automobile fan discourse. In this article, I will show that extended metaphor is not only a property of literary texts but also a common feature of consumer discourse-here, the discourse of automobile enthusiasts. In particular, I will show that ex- tended metaphor serves the purpose of furthering the ideological concerns of what in the United States are called "car buffs." I will first describe the corpus of automobile fan discourse, list the most commonly occurring metaphors for automobiles, and conclude with a detailed analysis of a text on rollover accidents that uses extended metaphor particularly skillfully. Automobile Fan Discourse Automobile fan discourse can be loosely defined as any text produced for car aficionados or any people interested in automobiles. It is produced in all kinds of media: television documentaries, usually aired on the various sports channels; radio shows such as the Boston-based Car Talk on National Public Radio; books, which are sufficiently numerous in many bookstores to warrant a separate automobile section; Internet sites; magazines; and automobile sections in newspapers. Most of these can be divided into those produced by a certain manufacturer and thus supportive of a particular brand (e.g., www.toyota.com, www.ford.com/global, www.chrysler.com, or magazines like FordMagazin or subaru drive magazin in Germany, or Mus- tang &amp; Fords in the United States) and those produced by a more general publisher and supportive of automobiles in general (e.g., Car &amp; Driver in the United States, Autocar in Britain, auto, motor und sport in Germany, Auto- Moto in France, or Automotor in Portugal). Within these publications the following text types occur: 1. Product information, which may take the form of anything from brief charts with items such as vehicle type, price, engine, accessories, di- mensions and capacities, acceleration, handling, and fuel economy, to features on particular cars, to elaborate narratives about road tests. 2. Maintenance information, which is often also product information, not about the cars themselves but rather about spare parts, cleaners, or after-market additions. Maintenance information furthermore in- cludes do-it-yourself repair instructions. 3. Information about automobile racing. These may take the form of news or background features. 4. Background reports on automotive history, celebrities in the field like engineers, race drivers, or collectors, and events of particular inter- est to automobile fans.</page><page sequence="5">Piller * Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse 487 5. Opinion pages that include columns by well-known automotive writ- ers like Brock Yates, the editor's pages, and letters to the editor. Opinions may be expressed on any car-related topic but most often denounce environmental protection efforts that might impact on automobile production and use. 6. Advertisements: the vast majority of ads in these publications will be for certain car brands or models and for automotive equipment products such as tires, stereos, or lubricants. Advertisements for other products are rare and clearly focused on a male target audience: beer, cigarettes, tobacco, recruiting ads for the Navy, Marines, and Air Force. Apart from producers' ads there are often also sections for the ads of retailers and a classified ads section. Obviously, not all of these text types occur in all of the media outlets. Car Talk, for instance, consists almost exclusively of maintenance informa- tion. Books typically consist of one text type exclusively: either product or maintenance information, or background reports. The dominant communicative function of automobile fan discourse is informative. Experts convey information to nonexperts. Rosemarie Glaser (1995: 150) distinguishes three genres of expert-to-non-expert communi- cation: didactic (e.g., schoolbooks, correspondence text of the Open Uni- versity in Great Britain); popularized (e.g., popularized article, review, nonfiction book); and behavior-regulating text forms (e.g., directions for use, cooking instruction, contract, agreement, treaty, highway code). Most automobile fan discourse belongs to the popularized text genre. Behavior- regulating texts occur but their language use tends to be less sophisticated and therefore only few metaphors occur. The dominant communicative function of automobile fan discourse is supplemented by a persuasive one. Extended metaphors are consciously employed to propagandize for auto- mobiles, an activity that regards cars as a part of nature and therefore describes them in zoomorphic or anthropomorphic terms. Unlike users of ordinary-language metaphor, producers of automobile fan discourse do have another verbal choice than metaphor. They could describe a machine as a machine. However, in many cases they consciously choose not to do so in order to attain their communicative goals. The meta- phors convey information because they make technical details more easily accessible to the nonexpert and they advertise because they answer certain emotional needs in the consumer by depicting the car as something that it is not. Generally, any machine can be personified through metaphor, and they often are (see, e.g., Jakob 1991). The metaphorical representation of cars, however, is more interesting than that of most other machines be- cause of the car's ubiquity and impact on modern life (economy, architec-</page><page sequence="6">488 Poetics Today 20:3 ture, environment, social structure, culture, etc.; see Piller 1996: 45-59). I will now discuss the metaphoric representation of cars in automobile fan discourse in general before focusing on the use of extended metaphor in a particular instance of automobile fan discourse. Metaphors for Automobiles In a corpus of 634 metaphorical automobile names out of a larger corpus of 2,241 American automobile names, which also includes metonymic and iconic names, the following five metaphorical concepts3 occur (see Piller 1996: 200-247). They are listed in order of frequency of occurrence. 1. The car is a human being (294 names; 46.4 percent): e.g., Ambassador, Apache, Baron, Chieftain, Dictator, Explorer, Mariner, Marshal, Matador, Monarch, Nomad, Pirate, Powermaster, President, Rebel, Scotsman, Vagabond, Warrior. 2. The car is an animal (123 names; 19.4 percent): e.g., Barracuda, Blackhawk, Bronco, Cobra, Colt, Cougar, Eagle, Falcon, Hornet, Impala, Lark, Lynx, Mustang, Panda, Pony, Stallion, Superbird, Thoroughbred, Viper, Vixen, Wasp. 3. The car is a man-made object other than a car (99 names; 15.6 per- cent): e.g., Arrow, Buckboard, Coronet, Corvette, Crown, Cruiser, Cutlass, Dart, Excalibur, Gyron, Firearrow, Javelin, Lance, Prizm, Probe, Rocket, Satellite, Sceptre, Torpedo, Trident. 4. The car is an element or phenomenon of inanimate nature (94 names; 14.8 percent): e.g., Bolide, Comet, Cyclone, Diamond, Galaxie, Horizon, Laser, Meteor, Neon, Quicksilver, Shadow, Silver, Skyline, Star, Storm, Sun, Tempest, Thun- derbolt, Topaz, Typhoon. 5. The car is a supernatural being (24 names; 3.8 percent): e.g., Apollo, Banshee, Centaur, Demon, Diablo, Dragon, Fury, Golden Spirit, Gran Fury, Gremlin, Imp, Phantom, Phoenix, Spirit, Sport Fury, Thunder- bird, Valkyrie. Three of the above concepts, the first two and the last one, are based on animist transfers--i.e., the machine car is metaphorically turned into a human being, an animal, or a supernatural being. Sometimes it is dif- ficult to distinguish among the three as there may be intentional overlap 3. With Lakoff andJohnson (1980: 3-6), I use the term "metaphorical concept" for a cluster of metaphors such as ARGUMENT IS WAR, while an instance of such a concept (e.g., I demolished his argument) is termed "metaphor."</page><page sequence="7">Piller * Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse 489 between metaphors making the car a human being and metaphors making it an animal. A Jaguar ad, for instance, connects the figure of a leaping jaguar with the lines: "We haven't sacrificed its beauty. We haven't cor- rupted its soul. We haven't crushed its spirit" (Jaguar 1994). While the picture accompanying this text identifies the car as an animal, the text depicts the car as having a soul that may be corrupted and a spirit that may be crushed. In total, 441, or 69.6 percent, of the metaphorical car names in my corpus are based on a personification, an animal metaphor, or a designation for a supernatural being. The following examples will show how these meta- phors are drawn upon in various text types. The concept of the (mechanical) car as human being is certainly one of the most well-established concepts in our culture. Indeed, cars can be re- ferred to by means of the feminine personal pronoun instead of the neutral one, as in "Take the wheel of a new De Soto. Pilot her out through traf- fic toward the open road" (1957 De Soto ad in Stern and Stern 1978: 92). In the Stephen King (1983) novel Christine, a young man falls in love with a car named Christine, who becomes his substitute for a girlfriend: "This is the story of a lover's triangle, . . . Arnie Cunningham, Leigh Cabot, and, of course, Christine. But I want you to understand that Christine was there first. She was Arnie'sfirst love, and ... she was his only true love .... Arnie saw Christine for the first time and fell in love with her .... what Arnie saw in her that day I'll never know. The left side of her windshield was a snarled spiderweb of cracks" (King 1983: 1, 3, 7). The automobile may be understood as a lover, friend, or relative. Vari- ous kinds of relationship terms occur; those for children, especially baby, and for partners seem to be the most frequent ones. Chrysler advertised its cars for some time as friend[s] of thefamily (Flammang 1989: 158). That ads like these have successfully disseminated a sense of the car as creature in the general public is nicely demonstrated by the following text, which is not part of automobile fan discourse: "Like yours perhaps, my life is marked out by marriage and jobs, by births of children and grandchil- dren, by the deaths of dear ones, by dogs loved and lost. Yes, and also by cars owned and (mostly) treasured. I remember them all" (Welch 1993: 16). Normally, we are not friends with machines; we do not typically think of machines in terms of forgiveness and loyalty. But because cars are perceived as human beings, all of these feelings apply: "A deep breath taken before clutch out, alreadyfriends, alreadyforgiving the beautifulAlfa for what must be lacking. Like a witty and warm but dangerously drunken friend. That kind of loyalty" (Con- way 1995: 33). The "relationships" between cars can also be understood in terms of human families as shown by a Saab 900 advertisement in which the car is placed at the bottom of a family tree with pictures of historic</page><page sequence="8">490 Poetics Today 20:3 Saabs and a jet plane as "ancestors." According to the accompanying text, the new Saab 900 has a wild uncle, a great-grandmother, and a father; it is said to have a Type-A personality since its birth, and even the company that pro- duces the Saab 900 is personified, because it is said to have bloodlines (Saab 1994). An ad for the Oldsmobile Aurora similarly states, "Its father was a cruise missile. Its mother a concert hall" (Oldsmobile 1995). One for the Jaguar XK8 trumpets, "A new breed of Jaguar is born. Its soul was inherited. Everything else is a product of advanced genetic engineering. The legacy of a 6o-year bloodline pumps through its 32-valve heart" (Jaguar 1996). Equally well-established is the concept of the car as an animal. Pony cars and spiders denote certain car types: a pony car is a small car with a power- ful engine that, like the prototypical Ford Mustang, is mainly favored by young adult consumers, while a spider is a sportive roadster. A new car may be announced as "another horse for our boss stable .... Passat wagons are better proportioned than their sedan stablemates" (Markus 1993: 134). A car that goes out of production may be advertised as the "last of a magnifi- cent breed" (Stern and Stern 1978: 126-27). This slogan headed a picture in which a 1976 Cadillac Eldorado convertible was depicted in a pasture among a number of fine horses. Cars are not only described as horses and draft animals but also as "Wolfim Schafspelz" (wolf in sheep's clothing) (Reil 1993: 3) or "bat out of hell . . . mustang of metal" (1942 Jeep ad in Stern and Stern 1978: 50). The nomenclature of automobiles also partakes frequently of the super- natural. The most famous car with a name based metaphorically on a designation for a supernatural being is probably the Lamborghini Diablo. The writer of a road test article plays on the notion of the car as devil: "As entertaining as it is, the sound that accompanies the Lamborghini's fury cannot be ignored; the Diablo's 98 dBA ist-gearfuror makes it the loudest car we've tested in some time .... Fast, furious and now all-wheel drive, the Lamborghini Diablo VT is devilishly stunning .... the car's otherworldly performance . . . The road ahead is never enough for the Diablo's fire- breathing 5.7-liter 48-valve V-12" (Miller 1994: 126, 127, 128). Cars are not only represented as the devil but also as a god-for instance, as in the fol- lowing article on the Alfa GTV, designated by the author as best car for 1995: "I'll preach, you drive. You'll see it, you'll feel it, you'llfind God in the details" (Conway 1995: 33). In many cases, cars are represented as creatures but it is impossible to decide whether these are human or animal. Parts of the car are quite often compared with parts of the human body, or the body of an animal, or clothing. Body, bonnet, head, hood, taifin, wing, and wishbone are examples of such usage, as is muscle in muscle car. Because the car is interpreted as a</page><page sequence="9">Piller * Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse 491 creature, the change from a V-8 to a V-6 engine can be described as a heart transplant. With this change completed the car is more muscular, the new en- gine needs more room, and the manufacturer therefore has to extend the nose so that it has a longer schnoz (examples from Schroeder 1994: 77-78). The engine is not only compared to the heart but also to the soul, as in "We'll begin with the engine. After all, that is where the soul of the Turbo Z lurks" (Nissan 1993: 84), and to the lungs, as in this description of the twin turbochargers on the Porsche 911 Turbo: "With the added set of lungs, the flat six's output vaults to a dizzying 430 horsepower" (Car &amp; Driver 1994a: 42). Furthermore, the engine is said to be the muscle of the car: "The GTD R42 runs on midship-mounted American muscle from the 4.6-liter V8 used in the Lincoln Continental" (Popular Science 1995: 17). There may be flanks, as in the following quotation: "People approach, glance around, gingerly stroke the flanks" (Conway 1995: 33); and to specify technical details of a car one may offer a look "under the skin of the new Range Rover" (Land- Rover 1995 Calendar: page following December). Cars not only have body parts themselves, they may actually become a part of a real human's body when they are regarded as the male sexual organ. Yates (1994: 29) calls a Bugatti EBllo a "mega-super-hyper-rapido-all- wheel-penis-extender" (italics in the original). Because they are metaphorized as creatures, cars can act like creatures, and may be subjected to natural processes. They guzzle gas, eat their owners (see Phillips 1995: 52, full quote below), or "swallow small bumps nearly imperceptibly" (Schroeder 1994: 78). They may notfeel well, fall ill, die, and there may even be life after death for them: We bought the car three days before we got married because our other cars were dying and we needed to move from California to Texas to go to grad school. We are both very emotionally attached to the car, despite the fact that it is charisma- impaired.... but for the next couple of years we think we can keep it going with regular oil changes and talk therapy. We have only had one real problem with the Lone Ranger .... Let our mechanic use it as a shop vehicle so he could be there when it died, which of course it never did. Finally, it died and didn't start and we found it needed a new wire from the starter to the fuel pump and paid $20 to get it replaced. Whenever the car isn'tfeeling well, the way it tells us is to refuse to start or to die while it's running.... We used to believe that the car had a soul, but then we realized that we would have to give it up someday and that was too painful. Now we think it has a soul-but that it will be reincarnated in our next car. (comment on the Ford Ranger at www.cartalk.com/Survey/Results/Ranger.html) Not only are cars described as if they behaved like creatures, but people also behave toward them as if they were creatures, as is seen in the fore- going declaration of love.</page><page sequence="10">492 Poetics Today 20:3 Cars may be described with the help of attributes that only apply to creatures, such as "the finest, fastest, sexiest new cars" (Car &amp;Driver 1994b). Attributes of vigor abound: the DeTomaso Pantera is "alive and kicking" (Goodfellow 1995: 65), or about the Alfa GTV: "You know that it is beau- tiful, brave" (Conway 1995: 33). Sports cars can be introduced as "five predatory athletes from five countries, all with carnivorous appetites. They'll eat your lunch, your wallet, possibly you, too" (Phillips 1995: 52). Also employed frequently is the metaphor of good breeding: "Ameri- can sports-luxury sedans challenge . . . blue-blooded European benchmarks" (McCosh 1995: 76) or "Ferrari . . .has produced a thoroughbred car for drivers ... its race-bred brakes and suspension" (Cropley 1995: 37). Textual Analysis Having examined the frequently occurring metaphorical concept THE CAR IS A CREATURE in some detail in examples drawn from a wide range of texts, I will now examine more closely the role played by extended metaphor in one particular text. The following text is from the opinion pages of the magazine Car &amp; Driver. The author, Patrick Bedard, has a regular one-page column there. The example text deals with rollover accidents: Bedard investigates the question of whether certain body types such as sport-utility vehicles are more prone to such accidents than others. He argues that rollover acci- dents are rarely fatal, that the tests conducted at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in order to distinguish between safe and un- safe cars are bogus, and that only drivers are to blame if rollover accidents happen. It is the aim of the column to lobby against safety legislation for "sport utes," as these vehicles are called. To reach this goal, Bedard employs two extended metaphors: one about the cars and one about consumer rights activists. The first one is CARS ARE CREATURES, THESE CREATURES ARE MAL- TREATED. The second is CONSUMER RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE MALTREATERS OF CARS. THEY MALTREAT CARS OUT OF BASE MOTIVES. The following text is the beginning of his column. It shows how he employs extended metaphor to prepare the ground for his argument. 1 When Cars Go Belly Up, Who Is to Blame? 2 The Clarence Ditlow Chorus is gonna take this one to the wailing wall. That 3 was my first reaction to Toyota's high-boy RAV4. Its roofline comes up to my 4 nose; a bowling ball could roll under its high-clearance belly without a tink. 5 I can hear the keening and the yawping already, even before the first one</page><page sequence="11">Piller * Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse 493 6 gets a license plate. "Rollover!" they'll cry. "Murderer!" they'll snivel. "Class 7 action!" they'll drool. Remember the TV news tapes adding whoop-whoop to 8 the charges against the Suzuki Samurai? There was the cringing defendant, up 9 on two wheels as Consumer Reports flogged it through some handling maneuver lo never seen outside the dressage ring. This rollover histrionics is prime time stuff. 11 When the show trials were over, though, the Samurai was acquitted. The ac- 12 cusers then turned to Bronco II; they bawled longer and louder against that 13 one, probably because Ford has deeper pockets. Again, no guilty verdict. But 14 like the anti-smoking beagles, yapping after big companies is what the Ditlows 15 do for a living. And in the business of threat theater, rollovers are a lot scarier 16 than secondhand smoke. So there will be allegations against the RAV4 and 17 Suzuki's X9o. We might just as well start the investigation now. 18 (Bedard 1995: 33; italics in the original) In this text, the car is metaphorically turned into a creature because desig- nations typically used for people are applied to it: high-boy (line 3), murderer (6), defendant (8). One of the cars in question is furthermore personified through its name (over which the author has no choice; see above): a samu- rai (8) is a professional warrior.4 Cars in the text have a human body part, the belly (i), and, most impor- tant in this text, they are subjected to actions and processes that only crea- tures can be subjected to: they suffer from the unjust charges against [them] (8) as demonstrated by their cringing (8), and presumably also from being flogged (9). Typically, draft animals are subjected to flogging, and therefore it is not surprising that the cars should be put into the dressage ring (lo) like horses. Typically, political prisoners in a dictatorship are subjected to show trials (11), so this should not happen in a democracy-but to really get ag- gravated by the injustice, readers need to perceive cars as human beings who can feel the injustice. Only human beings can be acquitted (11), as only human beings are brought to trial in the first place. The same holds true of the actions of accusers (11-12): only a human being with a moral sense can be accused, only a human being can be guilty (13) or not. If you thought of a machine as a machine, you could not accuse it of any ill effects it might create, only the designers or users could be guilty of anything. As it is, the car is humanized through being subject to accusations. The metaphor of the trial that personifies the car is further called up with the phrases allega- 4. To my mind, RAV4 (line 3) is also a personification. It is pronounced /'reIv3(r)/, and in British English a raver is "a person who leads an exciting life of social and sexual free- dom" (Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, 2d ed.). The 1995 CD-ROM edition of the American Heritage Dictionary does not have an entry for raver, however. This international brand name may nevertheless be perceived as a personification by Americans because of its word formation pattern. The vast majority of English deverbal nouns ending in -er, such as teach-er, sing-er, or work-er, refer to people.</page><page sequence="12">494 Poetics Today 20:3 tions against (16) and investigation (17). It is the ideological significance of this extended metaphor that "the rights and concerns of the car" are repre- sented as the concerns of any decent person with a moral sense of right and wrong. A car can only be represented as having rights and concerns if it is animated or humanized first. Not only is the car humanized in this text because it is presented as the victim of a show trial, the case is aggravated by the fact that the accusers are presented as not acting in good faith. They stage histrionics (lo) because that's what [they] dofor a living (14-15), it's their business, the business of threat theater (15)-in other words, they have pecuniary motives. For subjecting "the poor cars" to this indignity the consumer rights activists are de- humanized as beagles (14) and particularly through their repugnant actions expressed through the verbs applied to them: they wail (2) like the furies; they keen (5) like old women or witches; they yawp (5) like an animal;5 they cry (6) like someone overcome by emotion and no longer capable of rational action; they snivel (6) like persons who have no control over fluid emitted from their body, and are thus represented as unable to exert their will; they drool (7) like a fool; they add whoop-whoop (7) like hunters preying on their game or police sirens near disturbances of the public peace; they turn (12) instinctively from one victim to the next like a pack of dogs; they bawl (12) like animals or contemptuous persons; and theyyap (14) like dogs or stupid and noisy persons. These verbal choices imply two different aspects of the representation of consumer rights activists: on the one hand, they are metaphorically turned into hunters who mercilessly hunt down their innocent prey. Spe- cifically, they are represented as animal hunters, as subhuman, as a pack of dogs on the trail of their victim. The ideological significance of the hunt metaphor is that lobbyists for safety legislation are represented as an unthinking "pack" after an innocent victim. The writer implies that-be- cause the victim's cause is good and true-it has stood firm so far, and will ultimately prevail ("We might just as well start the investigation now" [17]). As sport utility vehicles are represented as humans fighting the good cause, their height becomes a matter of public interest. What is at issue here is whether a car's height is just an individual property or makes it more likely to roll over. 5. Yawp is not listed in any of the dictionaries I consulted. I am indebted to Donald Free- man for drawing my attention to Walt Whitman's use of the word, in Song of MyseGlf "The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering. / I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable, / I sound my barbaric yawp over the roof of the world" (Whitman 1995 [1855] 11. 1330-32). Whitman uses yawp as an onomatopoeia for the hawk's cry.</page><page sequence="13">Piller ? Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse 495 On the other hand, however, lexical items like keen, snivel, and drool do not necessarily strip the consumer rights activist of their humanity; rather, they represent them as women6 or weaklings without control over their bodily functions. Consumer rights activists are made out to act emotion- ally, lacking the capability to judge rationally or forgoing rational judg- ment out of base motives. The significance of the representation of lobby- ists for consumer rights as weaklings out of control is that they can be judged as not worth listening to, while Bedard himself purports to ratio- nally weigh the pros and cons of the "sport utes'" proneness to rollover accidents. The effect of these lexical choices is reinforced by the grammatical choices made in the text. With the exception of sentences in which the author refers to himself, designations for consumer rights activists occupy the subject position of active constructions throughout. The designations for sport utility vehicles, on the other hand, occupy the object position in those of these constructions that are transitive. In all these cases the sub- ject's role is that of agent, while the object's role is that of affected partici- pant. The typical structure of a transitive sentence in the text is as follows: the agent (consumer rights activists) engages in some type of despicable or negatively evaluated action. The constituent affected by that action des- ignates the "sport-utes." The impact on the image of the consumer rights activists is negative, while the image of the cars receives a boost.7 Examples of this type of structure are "Consumer reports [subject as agent] flogged [de- spicable action] it [object as affected]" (9); "the accusers [subject as agent] then turned [negatively evaluated action] to Bronco II [object as affected]" (11-12); or "they [subject as agent] bawled longer and louder [negatively evaluated action] against that one [object as affected]" (12-13). If a desig- nation for a car ever occupies the subject position, it heads a passive clause as in "the Samurai [subject as affected] was acquitted" (11). These grammatical patterns reinforce the lexical choices that represent consumer rights activists as merciless hunters and sport utility vehicles as innocent prey. The former act, while the latter suffer the impact of that action. 6. Bear in mind that automobile fan discourse is male-dominated and male-oriented, and celebrates the image of the "tough guy." 7. I take the criterion "impact on image" from the discussion in Kitis and Milapides 1997 of the metaphorical structure of a newspaper text about the relationship between Greece and Macedonia.</page><page sequence="14">496 Poetics Today 20:3 Conclusion Automobile fan discourse is represented by a substantial body of publica- tions. It serves the purposes of information and advertisement and thus takes a rhetorical approach to language. This article focuses on one rhe- torical figure, extended metaphor. I start out with a definition of extended metaphor as literary, consciously sustained metaphor (see Werth 1994: 84), and go on to demonstrate that consciously sustained metaphor is not only a literary phenomenon but can also be found in consumer discourse, specifi- cally the popularized expert-to-non-expert communication of automobile fan discourse. It is shown that cars are conceptualized in a limited num- ber of ways only, and one of these metaphors, THE CAR IS A CREATURE, is discussed in some detail and exemplified from a wide range of texts. Then, one particular text from an automobile magazine is chosen and its use of extended metaphor is analyzed. In this text, the author skillfully employs two extended metaphors: CARS ARE CREATURES, THESE CREATURES ARE MAL- TREATED, and CONSUMER RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE MALTREATERS OF CARS, THEY MALTREAT CARS OUT OF BASE MOTIVES. Both are "underground metaphors" because they are never explicitly stated. Both chains of metaphors serve the communicative goal of the author, which is to denounce safety legisla- tion by the government. Readers are well-prepared for the first metaphor8 because it is so pervasive in automobile fan discourse. Its ubiquity makes it a powerful tool of ideology that can be exploited for specific goals. If writers want their readers to buy a car, they will create positive "person- alities" carrying overtones of strength, aggressiveness, adventurousness, masculinity, or prestige. If they want to enlist readers in an effort to pro- tect cars from environmental or safety measures, they will appeal to their compassion as in the above text. It is the very pervasiveness of the meta- phorical concept THE CAR IS A CREATURE that allows these manipulations. As with any ideology (see Fairclough 1989: 33), writers on car-related issues may, on occasion, find it difficult not to draw upon the metaphor THE CAR IS A CREATURE. In an article on the dangers of off-road wagons in an urban environment, which is clearly not fan discourse, the author also draws on the metaphors of automobile fan discourse when he lists "the massive off-roaders' city sins," deplores "the growth of big, clumsy 4WVDs," or denounces their "aggressive nature" (McKay 1998: 61). 8. The second metaphor occurs frequently, too, but could not be further exemplified in this article.</page><page sequence="15">Piller * Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse 497 References Bedard, Patrick 1995 "When Cars Go Belly Up, Who Is to Blame?"
