<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Generative Phantasy: Robbe-Grillet's "La chambre secrete" RONALD L. BOGUE R OBBE-GRILLET'S INSTANTANES,1 a collection of six short prose pieces written between 1954 and 1962, has been virtually ignored by critics.2 The few who have examined these brief texts have generally treated them as illustrative examples of Robbe-Gril- let's theories of fiction outlined in Pour un nouveau roman (1963), particularly of the doctrine of chosisme -the belief, first enunciated by Roland Barthes and then taken up by Robbe-Grillet, that fiction should restore to the world its presignificative Dasein, its non- human otheress, through a neutral description of objects and events which thwarts man's desire to impose an anthropomorphic and teleological shape on reality.3 At least one of the texts of Instantanes, however, does not fit the chosiste mold: the sadoerotic phantasy "La chambre secrete," written in 1962. In subject matter and technique it belongs not with Robbe-Grillet's novels of the 1950's but with his later fiction-La maison de rendez-vous (1965), Projet pour une revolution a New York (1970), Topologie d'une cite fantome (1975), and Souvenirs du triangle d'or (1978). Although one can find sadoeroticism early in Robbe-Grillet's works in Le voyeur (1955), only in his later novels does it become a dominant subject; "La chambre secrete" is Robbe-Grillet's first detailed and explicit depiction of sadoeroticism and may thus be said to mark the accession of this obsession to prominence in his work. But more important than similarities in subject between "La chambre secrete" and the later novels are similarities in technique. In his later fiction, Robbe-Grillet is interested less in the neutral description of objects than in the creation of formally intricate texts that display their artifice and record the process of their produc-</page><page sequence="2">Ronald L. Bogue tion. He speaks of fictional "generators" when discussing his recent novels-images, concepts, or phonemes that generate plots and themes and that the text identifies as generators.4 In Projet pour une revolution d New York, for instance, "rouge" generates the themes of rape, murder, arson, Communism ("reds") and revolu- tion, and this relationship is explicitly stated in the text when a radical, discoursing on the color "rouge," asserts that rape, murder and arson are the most revolutionary of actions. Robbe-Grillet's later techniques are not totally divorced from his earlier practices, for one can see as proto-generators the patterns of figure-eights, Y's and V's which organize objects in the early novels, and one can find the emplotment of the narrative's own creation in Dans le labyrinthe (1959). But in none of the chosiste novels does Robbe- Grillet invite the reader to retrace the process of the construction of the work as he does in the later novels-and as he does in "La chambre secrete." Only when viewed as an early example of Robbe-Grillet's generative technique does "La chambre secrete" become fully coherent, and only then does it assume its proper position in the general development of Robbe-Grillet's fiction. "La chambre secrete" is a description of a painting of a prostrate, nude young woman, chained to the floor and columns of a prison or temple, who has been stabbed in the left breast. Behind her rises a curved staircase on which may be discerned the silhouette of her departing murderer. The story is dedicated to the fin-de-siecle painter Gustave Moreau, and although the story's imaginary paint- ing resembles no single Moreau canvas, its details represent well Moreau's decadent exoticism: the elongated female body, the gory wound, the shadowy colonnades receding into undifferentiated darkness, the thick cushions, tapestries and Oriental carpets, the curling incense smoke. Yet certain peculiarities in the description of this fictional painting suggest that the story is more than a tribute to a minor French painter. The persona's powers of discern- ment vary widely in the text. At first he can make out only the most general formal characteristics of the wounded woman; the pano- ramic view of the scene which he subsequently offers suggests that he is witnessing the scene from a great distance. Later, he can minutely detail the girl's features, the posture of her hand and the indentation in her flesh made by the chains surrounding her ankles. But most surprising is his ability to describe what he says he cannot see: the expression of violent exaltation on the hidden face of the murderer, the pattern of the trails of blood on the girl's body which a shadowy form blocks from his view. 2</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review The painting also changes as it is described. The girl remains chained in the same position throughout, but the murderer, near the top of the stairs after committing the crime at the beginning of the story, is closer to the body each time he is described, until he is depicted as leaning on one knee over the corpse. At this point the corpse is miraculously brought to life and made whole. The woman is then stabbed and convulsively dies. At the end of the story the murderer is seen leaving the room at the top of the stairs, the body once again bloody, immobile and lifeless. These violations of spatial and temporal logic all make sense if the story is viewed as the record of the birth, development and fulfillment of the persona's phantasy, the murderer functioning as the persona's double. The phantasy's interest, however, lies less in its pathogenic content than in the process of its elaboration, for that process is analogous to the process of literary creation. (I am not speaking of the actual process whereby Robbe-Grillet wrote the story, but the representation of a hypothetical creative process.) One cannot discern logical necessity-that is, predictability-in the story's unfolding, but one can trace in it a series of choices which generate a particular vocabulary, a group of images, a setting and finally a tableau, which then instigates an action and brings the story to a close. I wish to follow the process of the story's develop- ment from its inception to conclusion, initially in great detail, gradually accelerating the pace of analysis as the text's generative techniques become more evident. In doing so, I hope to elucidate the story's structure and meaning and to demonstrate in a shorter and more manageable text the techniques Robbe-Grillet employs in his longer works. The story's title establishes the locus of creation, an interior space set apart (Latin secretus, separate, isolated, solitary, from secernere, to set apart), secrete in all senses of the word: intimate, hidden, hermetic, interior, mysterious, invisible, even dissembling (as in "une femme secrete"). The dedication to Gustave Moreau reinforces the connotations of ritual, mystery and phantasy in the title and establishes the connection between writing and painting that the text explores. Robbe-Grillet also alludes in his title to the camera obscura, a darkened room with a small opening or lens in one wall, by means of which an image of external bright objects is formed on a screen at the opposite end of the room. The forerun- ner of the photographic camera, the camera obscura has been used by artists for centuries to project the subject of a prospective painting onto a sheet of paper so that its outline could be traced 3</page><page sequence="4">Ronald L. Bogue and natural perspective could thus be imitated accurately. Robbe- Grillet, however, makes ironic allusion to the camera obscura, for despite the flat, "unliterary" quality of his prose, he seeks no naturalistic representation of reality. "La chambre secrete," like a Moreau painting, is not a projection of the outside world on the wall of the mind's black box, but emanations of the imagination's camera obscura, images solicited by the darkness that enfolds some hidden, seductive secret, that calls forth phantasy and creation. Yet the title serves a dual purpose, both as inception of the text and as label of the finished production; it delimits an area of possiblities, a secret room, which the text then furnishes with particular details until that area is filled up and the secret room- the text which the title names-is completed. The title, then, is less the beginning of creation than the demarcation of the site of its inception; thus the story opens virtually at ground zero: "C'est d'abord une tache rouge, d'un rouge vif, brillant, mais sombre, aux ombres presque noires" (p. 97). "C'est d' abord": unspecified demonstrative pronoun, copula, marker of the inception of a temporal series-this is the most primitive of beginnings, a blank sign of the story's commencement. First there is "une tache," a stain (possibly an impurity or sin) or spot, a blot of ink or paint, a mark of difference (Petit Robert Dictionnaire [henceforth abbre- viated as PR]: "petit espace de couleur differente dans un ensem- ble de couleur uniforme"), in short, a sign (tache, from Gothic taikns, "sign, mark, wonder"). The "tache" might also be an allusion to the "tache assez imprecise" of the "ombre du mannequin" (p. 13) in the first story of Instantanes, "Le mannequin." This would suggest that the two stories frame the collection, the spot of an artificial body at one end, the spot on a dead body at the other, and that the final story is not generated from "reality" but from other texts. From the mark of difference, the text proceeds by qualification: it is "une tache rouge, d'un rouge vif, brillant, mais sombre." Here the playfulness of writing first emerges. "Vif" of course means not only bright, or intense, but also alive, an ironic characteristic of the lifeblood of a dead woman. The "rouge" is both "brillant" (a synonym of "vif") and "sombre" (an antonym of "brillant"). The oxymoron brillant- sombre signals a mysterious world where opposites are conjoined, but also writing's arbitrary power and its artifice, its ability to create the impossible through the manipulation of signs. "Sombre" also characterizes the scene which will be created-sinister, fune- real, fatal, disturbing, tragic-and generates by rime and etymol- ogy an element of the setting: the "ombres presque noires." 4</page><page sequence="5">South Atlantic Review The second phase of the elaboration of the "tache" is the determination of its shape: "Elle forme une rosace irr6guliere, aux contours nets, qui s'etend de plusieurs c6t6s en larges coulees de longueurs inegales, se divisant et s'amenuisant ensuite jusqu'a devenir de simples filets sinueux" (p. 97). Its basic form, "une rosace" (generated by "rouge"), is that of a decoration (a rosette), an aesthetic and perhaps painterly creation with vaguely religious overtones (rosace, rose window, a generator of "cath6drale" in the next sentence) which represents by synecdoche the woman herself (rose as traditional symbol of vulnerable female beauty). An oxy- moron is latent in the phrase "une rosace irreguliere," since a rosace is a symmetrical and hence regular form, but any suggestion in "irr6guliere" of disorder or lack of art is countered by the designa- tion of the form's contours as "nets": clear, distinct and precise (also "clean," an ironic adjective to be associated with "une tache"). The irregular, it would seem, does not distort the aesthetic in this text but serves as one of its artfully contrived elements. Textual development of "rosace" takes place through an exten- sion of the form, made possible by a determination of the "tache" as liquid. The spreading of the spot is an apt metaphor for a basic expository technique, designated partitio in classical rhetoric: ex- pansion ("qui s'etend") through division ("se divisant") and con- sequent narrowing ("s'amenuisant") of materials into their simple components ("simples filets sinueux"). Generative patterns in the subordinate clause are clearly marked: "de plusieurs c6t6s" qualifies "s'6tend," "larges" generates "lon- gueurs" (width and length supplying the most rudimentary di- mensions of any space), "irr6guliere" begets "in6gales," and "coulees" leads to "filets." Besides rivulets, "filets" can mean nets, a connotation picked up later when the trickles of blood are said to form "un reseau . . . hasardeux" (p. 107); the haphazard pattern of blood does indeed function as a hazardous net, a snare which gradually enmeshes the persona in his phantasies. (In the follow- ing paragraph he discerns "l'amorce d'un vaste escalier," the beginning but also, in the older sense of the word, the lure, of a vast stairway.) The adjective "sinueux" complements "irreguliere" and introduces the most important generator in the text: the shape of the curve, which generates arcs, waves, circles, cylinders, spheres, spirals and all terms denoting circular movement (tourner, re- tourner, contourne, r'volution, rotation, s'enrouler, entourer, tour, renverse). The final phase of the description of the "tache" is a characteriza- tion of the uniform field in which this mark of difference emerges: 5</page><page sequence="6">Ronald L. Bogue "L'ensemble se detache sur la paleur d'une surface lisse, arrondie, mate et comme nacr6e A la fois, un demi-globe raccorde par des courbes douces a une etendue de meme teinte pale-blancheur att6nu6e par l'ombre du lieu: cachot, salle basse, ou cath6drale- resplendissant d'un 6clat diffus dans la p6nombre" (pp. 97-98). The "tache," whose differentiated elements are reconsolidated in "L'ensemble," "se d6tache sur la paleur," a clever pun which creates a bit of grim etymological humor, detacher deriving from the Old French tach, hook, nail or stake, an appropriate root for describing blood on a stabbed breast. (The breast joined [raccorde] to the body creates similarly macabre etymological wit, raccorder coming from late Latin accordare, from ad + cor, "to the heart.") The body's forms are abstract ("une surface . . . arrondie," "un demi-globe," "courbes douces," "une etendue") and their organi- zation is analogous to that of the "tache": "une rosace ... qui s'etend," and "un demi-globe raccorde ... A une 6tendue." The characterization of the body's surface parallels that of the "tache," the whiteness of the one "resplendissant" but "attenu&amp;e par l'ombre," the redness of the other "brillant" but "sombre, aux ombres presque noires." The "tache" is also the body's antithesis, since the corpse's "teinte" is "pale" (antonyms: "rouge, sanguin, brillant, vif" [PR]). The oxymoronic motif begun in the initial description of the "tache" is found not only in the opposition of "resplendissant" and "6clat" to "ombres" and "pale," but also in the opposition of "mate" to "nacree" and "lisse" (both "smooth" and "polished"). The muted glow of the body also echoes features of the "tache": the "blancheur" is "attenu6e," literally "made thinner" (from Latin attenuare, to make thin), as are the "coul6es . . . se divisant et s'amenuisant," and the "eclat" is "diffus" (PR: "r6pandu dans toutes les directions"), as is the "rosace . . qui s'6tend de plu- sieurs c6tes." The reappearance of "ombre" in the text incites brief speculation about the nature of the "chambre secrete," whether it be some nondescript "salle basse," a "cathedrale" (generated by "rosace") or prison (generated no doubt by the series chambre secrete-chambre cachee-cachot). The final cognate of "ombre" to appear in the paragraph, "penombre," synthesizes brightness and darkness in its shadowy light, its clair-obscur or chiaroscuro. In the second paragraph (p.98) the persona describes the setting in which the body is found, his field of interest thus expanding from the spot to the body to the room. The paragraph's opening words, "Au-delA, l'espace est occupY," call attention to the per- 6</page><page sequence="7">South Atlantic Review sona's creative activity: his duty is to fill the emptiness of the room, to occupy space, which he does by introducing cylindrical columns and a curved stairway. The columns and stairway appear because they are curved forms and perhaps because a "cath6drale" might have columns and a "salle basse" stairs, but they also signal incipient eroticism, the column being a common Freudian symbol of the phallus, and the stairway of orgasm-to which may be added the room as a symbol of woman and the vagina.5 The stairway may be as well an intertextual reference to the story preceding "La chambre secrete," "Dans les couloirs du m6tropoli- tain" (pp. 77-93), which describes passengers ascending an "esca- lier m6canique" in its first section and descending an "escalier" in its final section. The description of the columns and stairway echoes that of the spot and body in the first paragraph. As the spot "s'6tend . . ., se divisant et s'amenuisant," so the columns "se multiplient et s'es- tompent progressivement, vers des profondeurs." (I assume that columns blurred in the distance grow thinner, "s'amenuisent.") The spot "se de'tache sur la pdleur," and "vers des profondeurs ... se distingue l'amorce d'un vaste escalier" (italics mine). The "cou- lees" narrow as they spread, and the stairway grows "de plus en plus 6troit a mesure qu'il s'eleve." But while the spot and body have a limited extension, the room expands indefinitely, the colon- nade fading into the distance, the stairway disappearing "vers les hautes voutes" (another curved form, from Latin voluta, past participle of volvere, to turn; also generated by "chambre," from Latin camera, vault). The persona returns to the body in the third paragraph (pp. 98-99) after noting the absence of any other personages: "Tout ce decor est vide, escaliers et colonnades." ("Tout ce d6cor" functions as "L'ensemble" does in the first paragraph, as a recon- solidation of enumerated elements of an entity.) The body is now so labeled, "le corps etendu" instead of "une etendue." The body "luit faiblement" (which corresponds to the "blancheur... re- splendissant d'un eclat diffus") and on it "s'etale [instead of "s'etend"] la tache rouge." The light's weakness seems to provoke speculation about the weakness of the woman's flesh, speculation which reveals the persona's nascent libidinal interests: "la matiere" of the body, he says, is "pleine" (a relatively innocent characterization, generated antonymously by "decor ... vide"), "souple" (only slightly sus- pect, though its Latin root, supplex [submissive, beseeching] does 7</page><page sequence="8">Ronald L. Bogue offer the word a role in a sadistic phantasy), "fragile sans doute" (there can be no doubt if the body is broken, as he has indicated), "vulnerable" (again, hardly matter for speculation, unless the persona is contemplating a future use of the flesh, capable of being wounded [late Latin vulnerabilis, from vulnerare, to wound]). This brief expression of desire is followed by a partial resurrec- tion of the flesh, a description of the wounded breast's double (obviously anatomically necessary, but also part of the story's thematics of repetition and representation), "une autre rondeur identique, intacte celle-la." (The persona introduces the story's culminating phantasy with the phrase, "Voila, maintenant la chair est encore intacte" [p. 107].) Instead of the "tache rouge" of the first breast, the persona notes on the second "la pointe areolee qui le couronne," a nipple surrounded by an areola which suggest a corona ("couronne") or "aureole," a sacred halo for a future sacrificial victim. After describing the untouched breast, the persona in the fourth paragraph (p. 99) contradicts his observation that the "decor est vide" by noticing the murderer "vers le haut de l'escalier." The instigation of desire and the reparation of the body, it would seem, call into existence the "silhouette noire" (generated by "ombres noires," suggesting further that this man is a projection of the persona, a silhouette in a "theatre d'ombres"). Since desire is only beginning, the "silhouette" is near the top of the stairs and it is only briefly characterized, as "un homme envelopp6 d'un long manteau flottant." The paragraph concludes with a description of a smoking incense burner and the woman's body lying beside it. The smoke is another curved form: like the "escalier de pierre, qui monte en tournant," the "fumee legere monte en volutes contournees" ("volutes" being a cognate of "vofutes" and one of the principal features of Ionic and Corinthian columns, "contour- nees" being a cognate of "contours" in paragraph one). The "fumee" is also conceptually linked to "ombres," both being obfuscating and ephemeral entities. The "brule-parfum" from which the smoke rises is generated etymologically, "parfum" deriving from Italian perfumare, from Latin per-, intensive + fumare, to smoke. At the end of the story, the incense smoke serves as a metaphor for the text, but here the smoke functions as a metaphor for the relationship between the murderer and his victim. (The smoke is the spatial mediator between the killer above and the corpse below and also the middle term in the sequence of images in the fourth paragraph: Man-smoke-woman.) The woman is the 8</page><page sequence="9">South Atlantic Review "parfum" which is "brul^," the murderer a rising phantom and byproduct of the woman's sacrifice. (That the "brule-parfum" is near ["Tout pr6s"] the "corps laiteux" strengthens the identifica- tion of the woman with the "parfum" and suggests the word play parfum/par femme as a possible generator of "parfum.") At this point all the elements of the phantasy are present: killer, victim, setting and desire. Henceforth the phantasy will proceed by an alternating elaboration of the first three elements in which the presence of desire will become increasingly prominent. The return to the woman in paragraph four initiates further depiction of her body in paragraph five (pp. 99-100), particularly of her "formes pleines" (rather than the general "matiere pleine" of paragraph three). Particularization of the body advances by a process which may be designated corporal partitio, a caressing enumeration of its parts which functions as a ritual evocation of the object of desire. From "le dos" and "le buste," the persona's gaze moves to "la taille," "le cou," and the features of "la tete": "la bouche entrouverte, les grands yeux ouverts," and "la masse des cheveux longs, noirs." Most of the adjectives modifying the body parts come from the previously generated vocabulary: the waist "etroite," the neck "courbe de c6tW," the eyes "brillant d'un eclat fixe." The persona's libido has been displaced upwards (momen- tarily delaying the culmination of the phantasy), the open mouth and eyes representing the open wound and open sex (which the persona describes later), the hair spilled out in the form of the irregular, sinuous blood stain, "repandus en ondulations au desordre tres compose." Three new details of the setting arise during the description of the body in paragraph five: the cushions, carpets and velvet cloth on which the corpse rests. The "6pais coussins" clearly generate the "tapis aux dessins orientaux" and the "etoffe aux plis lourds," the "coussins" themselves generated by "des seins" (echoed in "dessins orientaux"), both metaphorically and phonically. (The body is couch6e sur le dos, le buste [les seins] a demi soulev6 par d'epais coussins." The appearance in the next sentence of "le cou" suggests that the couche-seins are also cou-seins.) The persona in paragraph six (p. 100) is drawn away from the body to a contemplation of the color of the cushions, the carpets, and eventually the room as a whole, via a complicated generative sequence: the body "sans lourdeur" leads to "une etoffe aux plis lourds," which generates by rime "un velours," which begets by alliteration "violet sombre" (also generated by "rouge sombre" and 9</page><page sequence="10">Ronald L. Bogue the pun "viole"). The persona finds the color "violet" (as well as brown and blue) in fabrics, then in the columns, vaults and stairways, and finally in "les surfaces plus incertaines oiu se per- dent les limites de la salle." The movement from the body to the limits of the room (a repetition of the movement in the first two paragraphs) prompts the persona to consider the "surfaces plus incertaines" as signs that the "chambre secrete" expands indefinitely "vers d'autres sofas, tapis 6pais, amoncellements de coussins et d'etoffes, d'autres corps supplicis, d'autres brule-parfum" (paragraph seven, pp. 100-101). This reflection represents not only a deflection of the persona's desire but also the thematic kernel of the text. The persona's occasional indications that he is describing a painting ("s'estompent" [p. 98], "premier plan" [p. 98], the brace- let and chain "dessines avec une nettete parfaite dans leurs moindres details" [p. 105], the foot and chain "qui sont repr6sentes avec le plus de precision" [p. 105], the foot "modele avec finesse" [p. 105], "la toile" [p. 109]) force the reader to recognize both that the text is artificial and that it is a re-presentation, a symbolic repetition, and hence mastery, of reality. The room represented in the painting is itself a locus of representation, a temple or theater. (The stairs in the room appear to lead to some "edifice [from Latin aedes, shrine, temple], temple ou theatre" [p. 102].) Here the ritual of "la jeune femme sacrifice" (p. 100) is repeated, here the scene of cruelty is given its rehearsals (repetitions) and performances (repre- sentations). The drama is a phantasy, which, as Laplanche and Pontalis point out, is always a scenario "capable of dramatisation- usually in a visual form," whose primary function is "the mise-en- scene of desire."6 The convergence of phantasy, ritual and art in a scene of violence suggests that Robbe-Grillet supports Bataille's thesis, presented in his influential L'Erotisme, that the erotic and the sacred are grounded in violence, and that Robbe-Grillet ex- tends the influence of violence to art as well.7 As the site of a formalized, ritual phantasy, art comes under the sway of violence, but in a more basic sense the mimetic impulse is itself violent, an urge to violate and expropriate the world for the satisfaction of desire.8 Thus the story's mimetic content-the representation of the genesis and fulfillment of the persona's phantasy-functions not only as an analogy for the development of writing but also as a critique of writing as the field of representation, violence and desire. 10</page><page sequence="11">South Atlantic Review The persona returns to the body from his speculations on the room's dimensions by pondering the source of light in the room (paragraph eight, p. 101). He concludes that it is "le corps laiteux lui-meme qui semble eclairer la scene" (an unnaturalistic detail of obvious thematic significance: the body is the source of all light, the sole instigator of creation and phantasy). The return to the body initiates an enumeration of its parts that concludes in a second expression of desire: "la gorge aux seins gonfl6s, la courbe des hanches, le ventre, les cuisses pleines, les jambes etendues, largement ouvertes, et la toison noire du sexe expose, provocant, offert, desormais inutile." Once again desire invokes the phantom: in the next sentence the persona begins a three-paragraph description of the murderer (paragraphs nine through eleven, pp. 101-03), now only a few steps from the body. After adding details to his description of the stairway, a wide helix which curves less than "une demi-r6volu- tion" and is "sans garde-fou," the persona presents the killer in the process of walking away from the victim, his left foot on the second step, his right on the third, his head turned "pour contempler une derniere fois le spectacle," his cape floating in the air, its corner forming "un S assez lache," which "laisse voir la doublure de soie rouge." (One might say that the persona himself is the murderer's "doublure de soi," the understudy of himself.) The murderer's posture represents the indeterminate status of the persona's phantasy at this point, closer to the body, contem- plating it, yet still moving away from it. The man is returning for a final look at the victim, but he also seems to be anticipating some "evenement soudain," as if he were uncertain of his position in time, whether witnessing his past deed or considering a future act. His right hand is extended "vers un point de l'espace ou devrait se trouver la rampe si cet escalier en comportait une, geste inter- rompu, a peu pr6s incomprehensible, a moins qu'il ne s'agisse 1a que d'une ebauche instinctive pour se retenir a l'appui absent." This incomprehensible gesture bespeaks the persona's imbalance in the acceleration of his desire as he reaches for the absent support of the "garde-fou," his restraint against madness. (The man's gesture might also represent the reader's incomprehension and desire for "l'appui absent" of conventional temporality in the text.) The direction of the murderer's gaze leads the persona back to the body of the victim "qui git sur les coussins, ouverte, les membres 6tendus en croix, le buste un peu souleve, la tete rejetee 11</page><page sequence="12">Ronald L. Bogue en arri6re." In the next four paragraphs (paragraphs twelve through fifteen, pp. 104-06), corporal partitio, confined primarily to the extremities, is accompanied by a meticulous depiction of the prison paraphernalia binding the victim: circular iron bracelets and chains with "maillons . . . de forme ovale" which encircle columns or are fixed by a ring to "un piton massif." The persona's eyes move from "la main droite" to "l'autre extremite du bras, une epaule ronde, . . . le cou, la gorge et l'autre epaule, l'aisselle avec son duvet, le bras gauche" and then to the feet. When he comes to the last foot, elements of his phantasy become more marked-de- sire to break the flesh ("La chaine par endroit a 6cras6 la chair") and a desire to subdue a struggling animal (the chain holding her foot is fixed to a ring which "ressemble a ceux qui servent a attacher les chevaux"). He notes a fold in the carpet under the corpse, "provoque sans doute par les mouvements convulsifs," the first thought the persona has given to the possible movement of the provocative body. When the persona returns to the murderer in the next paragraph (paragraph sixteen, p. 106) the phantasy is nearly engaged: the killer is only a meter away from the woman, whose mouth is wide open "comme si elle 6tait en train de hurler." The mechanism of projection becomes clearly evident as the persona notes that "La position de l'homme ne laisse voir de sa propre figure qu'un profil perdu," and then adds, "mais que l'on devine en proie a une exaltation violente." (The verb "se deviner" also introduces the persona's observation that the body's "matiere" is "pleine et souple, fragile sans doute, vulnerable.") When in the next para- graph (paragraph seventeen, p. 107) he traces the patterns of blood on "la chaire nue" which "Cette silhouette massive [the man now associated with the "piton massif"] masque en grande partie," the reader must conclude that the killer represents the persona, that the final contemplation of the naked body proceeds from the murderer's point of view. The description of the blood patterns is a recapitulation of the story's opening depiction of the "tache rouge" and of the corporal partitio in paragraph eight (p. 101) which concludes with "la toison noire du sexe expose." The "tache rouge ... coule en longs filets qui se ramifient en s'amenuisant" (whereas in the first paragraph it "s'6tend ... en larges coulees de longueurs inegales, se divisant et s'amenuisant ensuite jusqu'a devenir de simples filets sinueux"), touching various parts of the body ("l'aisselle," "bras," "la taille," "ventre, la hanche, le haut de la cuisse," "creux de l'aine") until it 12</page><page sequence="13">South Atlantic Review forms "un trait sinueux, qui rejoint la pointe du V form6 par les jambes ouvertes, et se perd dans la toison noire." The disappearance of the blood into the "toison noire" not only brings together the motifs of the blood and the enumeration of the body's parts but also completes the identification of violence and sexuality in the phantasy. The movement of expansion to "les surfaces plus incertaines ou se perdent les limites de la salle" (p. 100) is here countered by a movement of maximal contraction as the blood "se perd" in the open center of the body. The "chambre" and the "femme" are one: open sites of disappearance, one engen- dering, by expansion, infinite repetition of violence, the other, by contraction, the act of violence itself. The scene of the repetition of the woman's murder (paragraph eighteen, pp. 107-08), the culmination of the phantasy, is intro- duced with an almost insolent nonchalance: "Voila, maintenant la chair est encore intacte." The "seins nacr6s," no longer "souleve par d'epais coussins" (p. 99), "se soulevent au gr6 d'une respira- tion rapide." The killer is now bent on one knee over the woman. Yet when the murder finally occurs, the agent is not described; all details relate to the woman alone, as if the persona himself were in the position of the killer: "enfin la bouche de la fille s'ouvre et se tord, tandis que la chair cede, le sang jaillit sur la peau tendre, tendue, les yeux noirs au fard savant s'agrandissent de fagon demesur6e, la bouche s'ouvre encore plus, la tete va de droite et de gauche, avec violence, une demiere fois, puis plus doucement, pour a la fin retomber en arri&amp;re et s'immobiliser, dans la masse des cheveux noirs repandus sur le velours." The eyes, mouth, head and hair attain here their fullest erotic import as signs of terror and struggle. The movement from vio- lence to douceur to immobility, besides outlining the phases of sadoeroticism (violent pain leading to submissive pleasure and then to quiescence), is also a metaphor for representation's strug- gle to tame and fix reality. The absence of an agent and the obviously sexual nature of the gushing blood suggest finally that the persona is a voyeuristic witness of autoeroticism, of the body's insemination by its own blood-an apt metaphor for the self- engendered text, born of the mutilation of its own representationa- lity. In the story's closing paragraphs (pp. 108-09) the scene is gradually restored to its original state: first the murderer is seen at the top of the stairs (his silhouette "se d6tache" against the yellow light, as the "tache" "se detache sur la pfleur" of the body), then 13</page><page sequence="14">Ronald L. Bogue "tout le d6cor est vide" (as in paragraph four, where "Tout ce decor est vide"), the bloody body stretched out beside the "brQle- parfum." The text concludes with a detailed description of the "volutes compliqu6es" of the incense smoke, which form first "une torsade" (a twisted form, but also the name for cable mould- ing on a column) and then "une sinusoide" (cognate with "sin- ueux" and "sein," from Latin sinus, curve), whose oscillating movement away from and back to an axis of origin plots the curve of the narration, from the body to the room or the murderer and back to the body again, until the phantasy, "de plus en plus amortie," dissipates "vers le haut de la toile," or in this case, towards the bottom of the page. As a representation of the unfolding of writing, "La chambre secrete" is a complex and successful achievement, although its sadoerotic subject might lead one to add, with Bruce Morrissette, that it "is a remarkable, if questionable, performance."9 The choice of a violent sexual phantasy as the locus of writing's unfolding, however, is not gratuitous, for the text provides a commentary on writing-specifically, on the inextricability of representation, vio- lence and desire-as well as a demonstration of the process of writing. Yet one must ask, if writing is the emplotment of desire, what desire does Robbe-Grillet voice in "La chambre secrete"? Is the persona's phantasy also the author's? The answer would seem to be no, for the self-conscious thematization of writing's complic- ity with violence and desire distances the author from the persona and makes the text a statement about desire instead of an expres- sion of it. The text is a representation of a phantasy, but a representation that points to its own artifice, to its strictly linguistic genesis. Thus it is a representation that perpetually undermines itself. Yet one can also argue that self-consciousness does not necessarily undo phantasy, that one can read "La chambre se- crete" as a self-generating verbal structure and as a representation of a phantasy without the one cancelling the other (as I have attempted to do throughout this essay). Perhaps, then, self- consciousness protects phantasy by allowing its expression while denying its efficacy (a process akin to the mechanism which Freud calls Verleugnung, "disavowal" [see Laplanche and Pontalis, The Language of Psycho-analysis, "Disavowal (Denial)," pp. 118-21]). Robbe-Grillet's persistent use of sadoeroticism in his later works certainly invites such speculation, but any final determination of the status of sadoerotic phantasies in Robbe-Grillet's psychic life 14</page><page sequence="15">South Atlantic Review must be made by him-or by his analyst.

Robbe-Grillet dissociates himself from phonological generation in "Sur le choix des g6nerateurs," but patterns of phonological generation are much in evidence in texts such as Topologie d'une cite fant6me, as Thomas O'Donnell shows in "Robbe-Grillet's Meta- phoricite Fant6me," Studies in Twentieth-Century Literature, 2, No. 1 (1979), 55-68, and I believe that they are clearly present in "La chambre secrete." 5See Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams, ed. and tr. James Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, V (London: Hogarth, 1953), 352-55. I am proposing the possibility of a self-conscious manipula- tion of Freudian symbols by Robbe-Grillet, not an unconscious revelation of the author's desires. 6J. Laplanche and J.-B.

Bogue 7Georges Bataille, L'Erotisme (Paris: tditions de Minuit, 1957). 'Violence and representation are explicity allied in Topologie d'une cite fantome (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1975): in the "cellule generatrice" of the phantom city, a prison cell and also the generative cell of the fictional organism, three parallel tableaus are presented, one of four women playing cards, another of two women watching a third paint a portrait, and a third scene of two women watching another woman preparing to perform some undisclosed violence against a fourth woman who is naked and tied to a table; later Robbe-Grillet says that in the generative cell "se poursuit toujours le ceremonial immobile de la violence et de la representation" (p. 43). 9Bruce Morrissette, Alain Robbe-Grillet (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1965), p. 12. "?Robbe-Grillet has responded to criticism of the presence of sadism in his works, arguing generally that sadistic images are social stereotypes which he utilizes as materials for his fiction, but with which he does not personally identify. (See, for example, an interview with Germaine Bree, "What Interests Me Is Eroticism," in Homosexualities and French Literature: Cultural Contexts, Critical Texts, ed. George Stambolian and Elaine Marks [Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1979], p. 93.) His interest is not in any particular sexual theme, but in eroticism, "that is, sexuality to the extent to which it is filtered through the imagination; that is, to which it is an activity not of the sexual organs, but of the brain" ("What Interests Me Is Eroti- cism," p. 99). But if eroticism in general is his preoccupation, one may still ask why sadism is the dominant form of eroticism in much of his fiction. My point is not that Robbe-Grillet is a sadist, but that the consistent choice of one social stereotype over others indicates the possibility of a personal relationship toward sadistic images- whether as objects of desire, phobias, obsessions, or whatever. The self-conscious, analytic presentation of sadism no more precludes authorial involvement with sadism than does the argument that sadism is society's creation rather than the author's; instead, both may be seen as elaborate and effective means of avoiding questions that readers have a right to raise, if not to answer definitively. Susan Suleiman expresses an unease similar to my own over Robbe-Grillet's defense of his sadistic imagery in "Reading Robbe-Grillet: Sadism and Text in Projet pour une revolution d New York," Romanic Review, 68 (1977), 43-62. 16</page></plain_text>
