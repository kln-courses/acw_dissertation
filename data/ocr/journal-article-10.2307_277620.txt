<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EARLY MAN The following report on the Los Angeles symposium on early man has been supplied by Homer Aschmann, University of California at Riverside. Bibliographic citations are to be credited to him. During the first week of January, 1954, the Assistant Editor for Early Man, accompanied by E. H. Sellards, Director of the Texas Memorial Museum, made a short trip to Southern California and was able to examine the collections mentioned by Aschmann (except Arnold's), and also to see some of the San Diego localities through the cotlrtesy of George Carter. A distinct impression was formed that the term "artifact" is probably quite justified in some of these cases, where chipping scars are of such regtularity that they can hardly be explained as acci- dental; but in other cases, "artifact" appears to be applied loosely to fractured rock where human agency is not at all necessary to account for the simple fracturing. Aschmann has not attempted to distinguish between valid and invalid applications of the term in his statement, which appears to be a very fair summary of the present status of this important problem. It is the opinion of the Assistant Editor that the presence of man in very remote times requires supporting evi- dence in the form of a concentration of the "artifacts" in definite camping areas, hearths or charcoal, remains of animals hunted or other food consumed, and the like, where tools were necessarily of the simplest nature. SYMPOSIUM ON EARLY MAN IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA The advocates of a liberal time allotment for human occupation of the New World dominated the floor at a symposium on Early Man in Western North America which featured the fall meeting of the Southwestern Anthropological Association. The meeting was held at Los Angeles State College on November 21, 1953. The speakers were: Thomas Clements, Department of Geology, University of Southern California; Ruth D. Simpson, Southwest Museum; Brigham A. Arnold, De- partment of Geography, University of California at Berkeley; and George F. Carter, Johns Hopkins Uni- versity, Baltimore. Clements spoke on a locality in Death Valley where abundant heavily patinated artifacts lie embedded in the "desert pavement" on the Manly Terrace. Projectile points have not been found. The artifacts are believed to be more or less contemporary with the Manly Terrace, which is correlated with the Tioga (Mankato) ice advance of the late Pleistocene, or an earlier stage, but not later. Data on this discovery have been pub- lished (Clements and Clements, 1953). Miss Simpson, on the basis of her examination and re-examination of numerous sites in the dry lake basins from the Mohave Desert to western Wyoming, concludes that there are two distinct phases to the early lithic record for the region: one includes projectile points and grinding tools, and the other, which on the basis of geologic associations is earlier, possesses only very simple tools and neither projectile points nor grinding implements. Reports on some of these sites have been published (Harrington, 1934; Renaud, 1938, 1940; Simp- son, 1952; Clements and Clements, 1953). The pre- projectile point phase, because of the crudeness of the artifacts and the lack of well-defined campsites, has been generally neglected, but Miss Simpson feels that stlch a lithic pattern extended through many millennia and over a vast area. The almost invariable use of locally available rocks as raw material indicates that the typological uniformity is not to be explained by extensive trade. Arnold dealt with a sequence of at least three distinct lithic traditions in the basin of Laguna Seca de Chapala in central Baja California. Each of these traditions occupied the area at a time when the climatic and topographic character of the basin differed from the present in major fashion. The artifacts from the oldest phase do not include projectile points and resemble those collected by Simpson and Clements; they are found only in the outer eastern margin of the basin, suggesting a time of much more humid climate when lakes virtually filled the basin area. Today, with an average annual rainfall of less than five inches, the two playas in this basin contain water only ephemerally. The artifacts of the middle phase include projectile points, and subsequent to it a sustained rise in the lakes flooded many of the sites. Arnold considers the repeated rise and fall of lake levels, with associated human occupa- tions, to represent stadia of Wisconsin time, and feels he has evidence of mid- or early-Wisconsin occupation of the area. Carter's work in the coastal areas of San Diego County is a continuation of his attempts to date occupation sites by a correlation of the valley terraces in and on which they are found with eustatic changes in sea level during the Pleistocene, and by the length of time required for the formation of existing soil horizons over the sites. A major premise of his work is that this part of San Diego County constitutes a stable portion of the earth's crust on which eustatic and pedologic processes can leave almost indelible marks. His belief that he has definite evidence of interglacial human occutpation of the area has already been reported (Carter, 1952, and earlier papers cited therein). His current investi- gations, presented at the symposium, suggest second as well as third interglacial remains. An opportunity was afforded for the display of arti- facts. Simpson, Arnold, and Carter brought samples from their collections. While few of those present would accept all the rocks as definitely modified by human action, most if not all of them would accept some. Arnold's specimens were generally accepted. A part of the questioning of some specimens displayed by Simpson and Carter was due to their having deliberately selected their more dubious examples. If there is a culture of Pleistocene age in the New World, characterized by an absence of both stone projectile 417</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY points and grinding implements, such comparative examination of specimens must be carried on extensively to establish a useful typology for these utterly crude implements. Photographs of such crude tools are normally inadequate for analysis or even for acceptance as artifacts. Naturally, conclusions as radical as those presented at the symposium did not go unchallenged from the floor, and as might be expected Carter's claims bore the brunt of the attack. George W. Brainerd and Clement W. Meighan of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of California at Los Angeles, were particularly active in this discussion. A major question was whether Carter's figures for the time required for formation of particular soil horizons were minimal or maximal. A novel aspect was the fact that a discussion of mid-Wisconsin and even interglacial man in North America was receiving a hearing from such an interested audience. Another change in our ideas of the antiquity of man in America may be developing. The existence of man in the New World as far back as interglacial times will never be demonstrated by a symposium on the subject. The demonstration which will satisfy a majority of students will be the discovery and analysis of one or more sites in terms of evidence of occupation correlated with unequivocal geologic and other evidences of age. This must be accompanied by field examination of the sites by several qualified observers. It is also essential that a maximum number of students be made aware of the possibilities of such correlations; and this can be done by symposia. It is improbable that one or even a few investigators will find those fortunate sites where human remains are associated with unmistakable evidence of great age; the chances increase as greater numbers of investigators have their eyes open to the possibilities. In the current enthusiasm for radiocarbon dating, our time perspectives should not be artificially limited to that one tool. ARCTIC Jorgen Meldgaard of the Danish National Museum is spending a year in the United States and Canada under a grant from the Arctic Institute of North America in cooperation with the University of Copen- hagen. He is studying Arctic collections in connection with his Eskimo and Old Norse excavations in Green- land, and he plans to spend some weeks in the eastern Arctic during the open season. Another visitor from Denmark is Count Eigil Knuth, leader of several large expeditions to Greenland. He is lecturing in North America and making comparative studies concerning his archaeological findings in Peary- land. The combined archaeological project headed by Frederica de Laguna during the past few years will be continued this season under grants from the Penrose Fund of the American Philosophical Society and the Social Science Research Council. De Laguna, together with her mother Grace A. de Laguna, and Mary Jane Downs a fellow in Anthropology at Bryn Mawr College, left in February for Yakutat where they will be joined in June by Catharine McClellan. Incomplete reports of two promising discoveries have reached this writer. From William Irving he learned that his father Dr. Laurence Irving, has discovered a rather extensive site in Howard Pass of the Brooks Range in northern Alaska. The site contains microblades, diagonally flaked implements, a burin, and other in- teresting artifacts, and appears to represent a camping place which has been occupied at several different periods. The second report comes indirectly from Otto W. Geist, paleontologist at the University of Alaska. It seems that he has discovered a huge cave in the rugged country at the head of Porcupine River across the Alaskan boundary in the Yukon Territory of Canada. The cave has three chambers extending 600 feet into the mountain and, according to the news report, the remains of mammoths and other extinct animals are "strewn all over the area" in which the cave is located. Geist has hopes of finding human remains as well as those of extinct mammals in the cave. PLAINS The 11th Plains Conference for Archaeology was held November 26-28, 1953, in the quarters of the Depart- ment of Anthropology, University of Nebraska, and in the new Nebraska State Historical Society Museum at Lincoln. E. Mott Davis served as Chairman. William Mulloy was elected Chairman for the 12th Plains Con- ference. Field reports, formal papers, symposia, and round table discussions comprised the program. Fifty- eight persons registered for the conference. Fewer field reports were on the program this year because of the severe curtailment of salvage archaeology resulting from cuts in the Federal budget. Robert L. Stephenson reported on the limited excavations carried on at the site of Tuttle Creek Dam in Kansas by Robert Cumming, the intensive survey of Fort Randall Reservoir by Harold Huscher, and a similar survey of Oahe Reservoir by Richard Wheeler. Reports of investi- gations of institutions working under cooperative agree- ments with the National Park Service in Oahe, Fort Randall, Garrison, and Medicine Creek reservoirs were given by Wesley R. Hurt, Carlyle S. Smith, Alan Wool- worth, and E. Mott Davis. Davis reported on additional work at the Red Smoke site where it was established that the Frontier complex is earlier than Plainview. Other reports ranged geographically from Saskatchewan to New Mexico and temporally from early man to historic trading posts and military forts. Major items on the conference agenda were a dis- cussion of pottery typing, led by Jesse D. Jennings, and a symposium on current anthropological problems in the Great Plains, led by Wm. Duncan Strong. The most significant contribution of the conference was the establishment of a taxonomic scheme covering 418 [ 4, 1954</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS the principal culture complexes of the subareas known as the Central Plains and the Middle Missouri. The presentation was based upon discussions held informally in April 1953 among most of the individuals who have been concerned with recent work in the two regions. The scheme as originally constituted was modified through group discussion at a session led by Albert C. Spaulding. The Upper Republican and Nebraska aspects were grouped together as a long series of foci under the new Aksarben aspect. The Arzberger site and component D at the Talking Crow site were considered as manifestations of as yet unnamed foci of the Aksarben aspect and to represent a northward spread of a basically Central Plains culture. The Lower Loup and Hill foci, protohistoric and historic Pawnee manifestations, were grouped with the Fort Thompson focus to form the Pahuk aspect. The Stanley, Snake Butte, and other as yet unnamed foci, representing the protohistoric and historic Arikara, were grouped under the Sanish aspect. The La Roche and Bennett foci were assigned to the Chouteau aspect, a culture complex in existence just before the earliest trade with whites, antedating, at least in part, the Pahuk and Sanish aspects, and later than the Aksarben penetration. The term, Chamberlain aspect, was proposed to include the Over, Anderson, and Monroe foci which appear to antedate the Aksarben occupation in the Middle Mis- souri subarea. No modifications were proposed for other manifestations in the area such as the various Woodland complexes. The terms used in the taxonomic framework change the tentative classification suggested by Smith at the 8th Plains Conference. Sanish aspect takes the place of "Grand River aspect"; Chouteau aspect takes the place of "La Roche aspect"; Chamberlain aspect takes the place of "Mill Creek aspect" (See Notes and News, AMERICAN ANTIQUITY, Vol. 16, No. 4, pp. 363-4). Copies of the taxonomic table and chronological chart may be obtained from Robert L. Stephenson, Missouri Basin Project, Burnett Hall, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. Plans of the Smithsonian Institution for the 1954 field season depend entirely on the amount of money made available for salvage archaeology in next Federal budget. Under cooperative agreements with the National Park Service the University of South Dakota will have a field party in Oahe Reservoir, in charge of Hurt, and the State Historical Society of North Dakota in Garrison Reservoir, under Woolworth. NORTHEAST Excavation of the Sheguiandah site on Manitoulin Island was continued during July and August, 1953 by a National Museum of Canada party. Thomas E. Lee, who directed the excavations, reports the four cultural levels recognized last year have been more firmly established and a fifth, and older, level is now indicated. Numerous small charcoal samples were ob- tained. While trenching a small swamp hole on the hilltop, several artifacts were found in a clay layer under 18 inches of dense brown and black peat. Further digging here, it is hoped, will produce animal bones preserved by the peat. The top level, thought to be a habitation area, is very thinly represented. To date no pottery has been recovered, but the site is believed to be Point Peninsula in age. The second layer has yielded several thousand artifacts which are most like Greenman's George Lake I materials in terms of sizes, shapes and chipping tech- niques. Below this, a thin layer yielded many types of projectile points, nearly all of which have very heavy basal and/or lateral smoothing. The fourth level produced finely chipped blades. The material from the fifth, and oldest, level may represent unfinished projectile forms. One of the major problems of the site is the deter- mination of the means whereby the artifacts of the fourth and fifth levels arrived in their present position. They are in a matrix of what appears to be fairly typicaf glacial till, resting upon deposits of lake bottom clays and gravels. Since they are on the rather small top of a quartzite outcrop and contain numerous boulders ranging up to hundreds of pounds in weight, such explanations as stream action and slippage seem inapplicable. The artifacts and matrix appear to have been tumbled into place. One geologist studying the site has expressed the opinion that this condition resulted from a local re-advance, or advances, of ice. Elsewhere in Ontario, survey operations included the finding of some small Laurentian sites in the Ottawa Valley and burial mounds in Prince Edward County. Some minor excavations were carried out in the Bruce Peninsula where two burials were removed, both heavily sprinkled with red ocher. Several sites were found in Quebec Province, par- ticularly in the Tadoussac area. The concluding project of the 1953 field research of the New York State Science Service was an excavation at Jamesport, on eastern Long Island, in October. Here a party consisting of William A. Ritchie, assisted by Irving Rouse of Yale Peabody Museum and Peter P. Pratt, University of Toronto, opened an undisturbed section of a large mortuary pit pertaining to the Orient focus of the early Woodland period. Two deposits of offerings were found, comprising "killed" steatite pots, projectile points, a gorget, grooved bannerstone, and other articles. One cache was imbedded in red ocher, the other was associated with a hearth which yielded a charcoal sample which it is hoped will provide the first date for the Orient culture. Obviously the Orient shared a number of the basic traits of mortuary ceremonialism with the older Point Peninsula and other early Woodland manifestations. In Western Long Island, Edward Patterson has been investigating an Archaic period site on Garvey's Point near Glen Cove, Nassau County. 419</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY MINNESOTA. Excavation in two sites in Dakota County has been reported by Elden Johnson of The Science Museum, Saint Paul, Minnesota. Both sites were im- mediately adjacent to the Mississippi River. One find at the first site consisted of a partial vessel approximately eighteen inches in height, with a conoidal base and slightly constricted neck, which does not fit into any of the established Minnesota materials to date but may have affinities with the Effigy Mound materials of eastern Iowa. A rockshelter in the high limestone bluffs adjacent to the first dig was also excavated. This shelter yielded both shell tempered Oneota ware of the Orr focus and a variety of Woodland type wares, together with bone refuse and a good sample of worked lithic material. The site is nearly a duplicate of the Tudahl Rock Shelter dug by Wilford some years ago. The 1953 field trip of the University of Minnesota, under the direction of Lloyd A. Wilford, was largely devoted to digging two burial sites, one at Yucatan, Minnesota, in the Root River Valley in the southeastern corner of the state, and one at Browns Valley, which is on the South Dakota border between Big Stone Lake and Lake Traverse. The Yucatan burials were typical Oneota burials of the Orr focus--22 extended primary burials, often with rock slabs outlining the shallow pits or placed over the bodies, or both. Beads and copper ornaments accompanied some of the burials, and two small mortuary pots were found. Although Wilford has not yet had the material analyzed, he believes that some of the beads are of glass. If so, he feels the site can be dated as immediately prior to the year 1700. The Browns Valley burials were in 25 pits in a gravel deposit. Burials were both secondary and primary. The principal grave goods were shell ornaments, though two small conoidal-based mortuary vessels were present. Some pits contained primary burials, one or more to a pit, but the skulls and arm bones were usually missing. The other pits contained multiple secondary burials, represented by skulls and arm bones and seldom any other bones. The artifacts were with the secondary burials, The manifestation is ascribed to the Red River aspect of the Woodland, though these are the first burials of the aspect not found under mounds. At Browns Valley, a habitation site three miles north of the burial site was studied. The pottery was Wood- land, but laboratory analysis has not yet been made. Also three habitation sites on Jensen's Island in Lake Traverse were tested. Two proved to be of 19th century Sioux provenience, the third yielded Woodland pottery types. The island is being eroded away since the construction of dams at both ends of the lake, and a group of skeletons was washed out last spring. A study of the portions of skeletons still remaining proved them to be 19th century Sioux. MISsoURI. Carl H. Chapman of the University of Missouri, reports that salvage operations at Graham cave conducted in conjunction with the Missouri Archaeological Society continued during the past fall. Plans are now being developed to form a state park of the cave and about 200 acres of surrounding land. The University has just completed the negotiation of another contract with Region Three of the National Park Service for a cooperative archaeological salvage project in the Table Rock Reservoir area for next year. Surveys will be conducted in the area this next spring and the University Summer Field Session in Mid-Western Archaeology will be held in the area from June to August next summer. OHIO. Raymond S. Baby of the Ohio State Museum reports that during the month of November, 1953, salvage excavations were carried on in a large Adena type mound in Columbus. Salvage explorations were also made early in December on a site in northern Ohio being destroyed by construction of the Ohio Turnpike. WISCONSIN. A radiocarbon date for the Old Copper culture of Wisconsin has been announced as the result of the analysis of a charcoal specimen by the Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of Chicago. The date, 5,600 years ago plus or minus 400 years, is for the Oconto site described by Robert E. Ritzenthaler and Warren L. Wittry in Vol. 33, No. 4 of The Wisconsin Archeologist. SOUTHEAST GEORGIA. During the fall of 1953, Lewis H. Larson, working for the Georgia Historical Commission, con- tinued exploration of shell midden areas at Pine Harbor site, near Darien, McIntosh County, Georgia. This work will continue into the winter months. Larson is excavating a village midden of a protohistoric horizon of "coastal Lamar," ceramically and chronologically representative of the pre-contact levels just before the advent of the 16th century Spanish missions. He is finding good assemblages with a surprising occurrence of pottery effigy forms and symbolic decorations pertain- ing to a late peripheral survival of the "Southern cult," including a localized variant of the Eagle Warrior. Sheila K. Caldwell has completed excavations at the Darien bluff site, tentatively identified as Santo Domingo de Talaxi, and is engaged in writing a report for the Georgia Historical Commission. At the University of Georgia W. H. Sears is complet- ing his final report on four seasons of exploration at Kolomoki Mounds. A. R. Kelly is working on Georgia mid-coastal Archaic, the Mulberry Plantation site at Camden, South Carolina, and the historic horizon in the Flint-Chattahoochee "forks" area. C. H. Fairbanks, National Park Service, dug at the 9HL64 site in Hall County, Buford Reservoir, previously reported by Caldwell, Thompson, and Caldwell. The site proved to be a natural levee inhabited by Indians during deposition and later eroded to leave a mound- like remnant. The analysis of the collections is going on. The pottery seems to be check-stamped with some simple-stamped at the top. Points are rather small 420 [ 4, 1954</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS triangular affairs. One straight line of postholes may indicate rectangular houses on the check-stamped level. FLORIDA. Two University of Florida field projects were carried out during the summer. Paul Hahn, now a graduate student at Yale University, supervised the third season of excavation at the Fountain of Youth Park. Extensive structural evidences were found and a new area of historic burials was opened up near those now on exhibit. Early in the summer an archaeological survey of western Charlotte and adjacent Sarasota County was initiated under the sponsorship of Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Vanderbilt. This work under the over-all supervision of John M. Goggin began in June. Later during the summer it was continued by William Plowden and other University of Florida students. The survey, carried out by jeep, boat, and airplane, revealed 71 archaeological sites. This fall the first excavations in this program were made by Goggin and students at Angers Boat Basin at Englewood. Here in a 41/2 foot deep shell mound an excellent stratigraphic picture was obtained with fibre-tempered pottery (below tide level) underlying deposits characterized by Glades Plain. This is the most southerly site with fibre-tempered pottery that has been excavated. ALABAMA. Archaeological activities will be resumed in this state with the recent appointment of David L. deJarnette as archaeologist-in-charge of Moundville State Monument. He has a contract with the Alabama Museum of Natural History, University, Alabama, to operate Mound State Monument on a long-term lease. He will have charge of the archaeological and recrea- tional features of the Park, including the Museum, and will also furnish curatorial services for the collections and supervise excavations. It is hoped that time will permit preparation of short studies and papers on the Moundville site. All of the material from the Alabama Museum's extensive excavations in Alabama, including the Tennessee Valley, is now stored in the Monument's archaeological laboratory. Laboratory space and limited quarters can be furnished students who are interested in making studies of this material. TENNESSEE. T. M. N. Lewis and Madeline Kneberg, University of Tennessee, spent a large part of the sum- mer serving as consultants for the Cherokee Historical Association at Cherokee, North Carolina in connection with two of the Association's projects, the Museum of the Cherokee Indian, and Oconaluftee Village, a recon- struction of a 19th Century Cherokee town. Also, seven weeks of lectures on Cherokee ethnology were given for reservation personnel and others, under the sponsorship of the Cherokee Historical Association. These activities are part of the Association's program to perpetuate the history and traditions of the Cherokee Indians and to improve the general economic and social conditions on the reservation. An interesting part of the work was the reviving of almost forgotten crafts in pottery, bone, stone, etc. KENTUCKY. Raymond H. Thompson, under the auspices of the University of Kentucky Research Fund Committee, has begun a technological study of pottery collections from the Ohio Valley area. The first phase of this project will emphasize petrographic techniques and the use of the binocular microscope. PACIFIC COAST William J. Wallace and a group of students from the University of Southern California continued their archae- ological survey of Death Valley National Monument during the Thanksgiving holiday. An additional 50 sites were located and mapped. Forty-seven were campsites of the recent Indians, the others were rock alignments. The campsites, located in an area not visited by relic- hunters, were rich in artifacts. Included in the surface collections were several nearly complete pots and a large wooden mortar. Wallace also reports preliminary excavations at a large village site in Vermilion Valley, Fresno County. Donald W. Lathrop and Jack Nicoll partially excavated a large house pit, recovering nearly 300 artifacts. Complete excavation of the site is planned for early June. At the University of Utah, the Department of Anthropology is continuing its current research projects. Jesse D. Jennings is reworking the materials from Danger cave, Wendover, Utah, in order to include new ma- terials recovered during the 1953 excavations. The new material appears to validate previous interpretations. Jack R Rudy has completed a short report on the excavation of an overhang site west of Enterprise, Utah. The overhang had been occupied by both Puebloid groups and southern Paiute. The southern Paiute ma- terials were found stratigraphically above: the Puebloid materials. Rudy is now working on a report of the Beef Basin (southeastern Utah) excavations carried out last summer. Luther Cressman of the University of Oregon is continuing work on the analysis of the collection obtained last summer at site 35WS8 in The Dalles Reservoir area. Approximately 3,800 artifacts were re- covered from this significant site. Two students from the University of Oregon spent the Christmas vacation at the site, continuing the excavations into an artifact- bearing stratum of hardpan. A contract between the National Park Service and the University of Oregon will make possible continued excavations in The Dalles Reservoir area in the summer of 1954. Materials from the large rockshelter near Vantage on the Columbia River, excavated by a University of Washington crew under the field direction of Earl Swanson, are in process of analysis. Quantities of perishable artifacts were recovered from the deeply stratified deposits. Plans have been made to return to the area to expand the range of the work, and to follow up preliminary testing of an early midden site. Warren Caldwell, graduate student at the University of Washington, is planning to continue excavations at 421</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the Wakemap mound in The Dalles Reservoir area during the summer of 1954. This work is being carried on under a contract between the National Park Service and the University of Washington. Charles E. Borden of the University of British Colum- bia indicates that plans for the coming summer call for surveys of the Vanderhoof area in central British Columbia and in the Koptenay district in the southeast corner of the province. He also intends to start excava- tions in the oldest habitation area in the Musqueam Reserve, Vancouver, B.C. Borden reports that surface finds from the old area suggest strong affinities with the Marpole complex, and contrast sharply with ma- terial excavated from recent village deposits on the reserve. Richard D. Daugherty of the State College of Wash- ington has received a radiocarbon date for the cultural materials from the Lind Coulee site in central Wash- ington. Tests on burned bison bone found in direct association with artifacts give the following dates: 9400+940, 8516+460, for a weighted average of 8700 + 400 years. The tests were run by W. F. Libby, and the material bears his sample number 827. M. R. Harrington of the Southwest Museum reports that Ruth D. Simpson, Assistant Curator, recently com- pleted a survey trip involving visits to a number of early man sites in the western United States. Harrington has been devoting considerable time to working on his report of the excavations near Little Lake, Inyo County, California, which he expects to complete in 1954. SOUTHWEST ARIZONA. Walter W. Taylor, Santa Fe, New Mexico, made a brief reconnaissance of the Colorado River from Lees Ferry to Pierce Ferry (Lake Mead) by boat through Marble Canyon, Grand Canyon, and the Granite Gorges. Occupational evidence was scarce. Terah L. Smiley of the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research reports that approximately 5,000 specimens have been received from archaeological excavations and survey work of the last summer in the Southwest. A tree-ring exhibit for the Heard Museum, Phoenix, Arizona, is in preparation. A bulletin on all the tree-ring dates to April 1, 1953, for the Northern Rio Grande area, is in press. H. Thomas Cain, Heard Museum, Phoenix, has been rearranging the Southwest archaeological exhibits. Three rooms have been reinstalled, Hohokam Prehistory, Anasazi, and modern Pueblo culture. The Museum is sponsoring a weekly TV program, "Mystery of Man" (KPHO:5). Odd Halseth, Pueblo Grande, Phoenix, Arizona, reports that Donald H. Hiser has joined the staff. Additional excavations will be started at Pueblo Grande. The Hohokam site of La Cuidad has been leveled during excavations for a new hospital. Charlie Di Peso, Amerind Foundation, Dragoon, has begun work on a site (Paloparado) 14 miles north of Nogales. It is hoped that the sites worked can be coordinated to bring together knowledge of the various historic Indian groups of southeastern Arizona and help to link the historic and the prehistoric periods. Barton Wright is field assistant. John C. McGregor, University of Illinois, excavated a site on the Pollock Ranch (NA 4317) 40 miles south- east of Flagstaff during the summer. Seven rooms of a pueblo were excavated, four partially excavated, and a trench was dug in the trash. A total of 26,000 sherds were studied and classified. Only a small percentage were decorated. The Pollock site is late Pueblo III and early Pueblo IV. Except for Kinnikinnick, it is the latest Sinagua site dug. Three burials with offerings were found in the trash. One room excavated showed a number of features which indicate possible use as a kiva. It is the first such room found in a Sinagua ruin. Harold S. Colton, Museum of Northern Arizona, is continuing work on the Ceramic Series of the Museum publications. The new 12,000-square foot Research Center of the Museum of Northern Arizona was com- pleted in October, 1953, and collections will be moved from the present storage areas to the new building. Fred Wendorf and Franklin Fenanga have been sur- veying for the El Paso Natural Gas Company on a parallel pipeline on the right-of-way across Arizona. A number of pit houses were excavated during October, one just east of Flagstaff. Other work on the pipeline right-of-way is being done in New Mexi.cq. Jesse L. Nusbaum, National Park Service, has been in charge of arrangements for this work. NEW MEXICO. Erik K. Reed reports National Park Service projects as including excavation of a circular structure of the Mesa Verde period at Aztec Ruins, New Mexico. There was a kiva surrounded by two concentric rows of encircling rooms. This work was done by T. B. Onstott. A third and final season's work was devoted to Kin Kletso (Yellow House) in Chaco Canyon by R. Gordon Vivian. A. H. Schroeder, National Park Service, has been working on a special study of Yavapai history for the Justice Department. The staff of the Austin, Texas, office of the River Basin Surveys have made a few preliminary surveys of proposed reservoir areas in Texas and Kansas and have continued laboratory work and the preparation of reports. No other field work or new research is planned by the Park Service for the winter or spring of 1954 because of cuts in appropriations. Stanley Stubbs, Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, assisted by Gary Vescelius, conducted archaeological excavations in the Tesuque Valley just east of Cuya- mungue, north of Santa Fe. The site consisted of 12 to 15 small house units, each of ten to 20 rooms and associated kivas. Kivas were both circular and rectangu- lar. A great kiva 52' in diameter was partly excavated. In part the floor was almost 9' below the present surface. The general pattern is PI-PII of northwest New Mexico. Tentative dating based on field examination of the pottery is in the 1000's, perhaps as late as 1150 in part. This may be revised on further study of artifacts and tree-ring material. This site provided many new data 422 [ 4, 1954</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS on upper Rio Grande archaeology and changes some ideas on the concepts of cultural development in the area and the time of introduction of certain traits. COLORADO. Joe Ben Wheat, University of Colorado Museum, Boulder, reports that H. W. Dick excavated a stratified Cody Complex site near Yuma, Washington County, eastern Colorado. Hugo G. Rodeck is preparing an extensive report on Mimbres pottery with zoomorphic designs. Robert H. Lister was on a reconnaissance in northwestern Chihuahua and eastern Sonora from June 22 to July 8, and from July 23 to August 25 he con- ducted a field school in Mesa Verde. A small pueblo site in the Far View group on Chapin Mesa was exca- vated. Two deep circular kivas, a tower, and 12 surface rooms were excavated. The two kivas and the tower were connected by a tunnel. Eight human burials and several dog burials were found. The pueblo ceramically dates in the late 1100's or early 1200's. Gordon W. Hewes, of the University of Colorado, and Fred Rosen- tiel, Columbia University, conducted a surface survey of sites in the Pine River Valley, La Plata County, Colorado. H. W. Dick joined the faculty of Trinidad Junior College, Trinidad, Colorado, and is in charge of the museum. Carroll L. Riley is taking Robert Lister's place at the University of Colorado while Lister is on leave in Mex- ico under a Ford fellowship. SOUTH AMERICA BRAZIL. Helen C. Palmatary spent some ten weeks in August-October, 1953, studying museum collections in Brazil as part of a project of research on the antiq- uities of the Tapaj6s and Trombetas rivers (lower Amazon). This work is a continuation of her classic study of Tapaj6 pottery published in 1939. She reports abundant materials at Belem, Santarem, Belterra, Recife, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Stone objects are numer- ous in the area studied as contrasted with Maraj6 at the mouth of the Amazon and there is considerable local variation in the pottery. At Belem, the Goeldi Collection contains few but choice specimens from Santarem and the upper Tapaj6s, including some anthropomorphic vessels different from anything found in other collections. There is also some interesting miniature pottery. Frederico Barata has a large collection including very fine Tapaj6 style pieces, miniature pots, pipes, amulets, and several unusual figurines. At Santarem, Carlos Liebold has a fine Tapaj6 col- lection including two unusual zoomorphic bottles. At Belterra, C. H. Townsend, Jr., has important material from Santarem, the plateau of Belterra, and the upper Tapaj6s. His collection includes non-Tapaj6 style pieces, but some of them are clearly related to classic Tapaj6. At Recife, Miss Palmatary found a fine onca jar in the Oliveira Collection at the Museu do Estado and studied muirikitas (nephrite amulets) in the collection of the late Carlos Estevio de Oliveira, who had one of the most valuable collections of these objects in Brazil. At Rio de Janeiro, the Museu Nacional has a small Tapaj6 collection and one from the Trombetas, the latter all sherd material and containing a high propor- tion of Tapaj6 style pieces, probably trade items. The Fundacao Brasil Central has the important Brown Col- lection of Tapaj6 material. At Sao Paulo, the Museu Paulista has recently acquired a substantial Tapaj6 col- lection including interesting figurines. Miss Palmatary also reports that Peter Paul Hilbert of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi at Belem has prepared a report on his archaeological work in 41 mounds on the Trombetas River, which is to be pub- lished by the Sociedade de Antropologia do Para. He plans to continue his researches in lower Amazon arch- aeology.
