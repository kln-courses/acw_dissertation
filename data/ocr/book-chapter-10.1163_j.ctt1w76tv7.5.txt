<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CHAPTER ONE WORSHIP, RELIGIOUS EPISTEMOLOGY   AND THEOLOGICAL JURISPRUDENCE Ibn Taymiyya as a Theological Jurist There has been no comprehensive study of Ibn Taymiyya’s theological meth- odology, and his attitude toward reason in theological matters has not been  well understood. The (Hanbalī legal school to which Ibn Taymiyya belonged  was of two minds in preceding generations concerning rational argument in  theology. On one side were the likes of al-Barbahārī (d. 329/941) and Ibn  Qudāma (d. 620/1223) who completely opposed discussion of theological  matters and permitted no more than repeating what was said about God in  the data of revelation.1 On the other side were Abū Ya≠lā (d. 458/1066) and  his disciple Ibn ≠Aqīl (d. 513/1119) who produced writings dealing with the  principles of religion (u$sūl al-dīn), which were in content and structure not  unlike Kalām works of the Ash≠arīs and Mu≠tazilīs.2 Even though Ibn ≠Aqīl  was forced to recant for Mu≠tazilī sympathies, many of his theological views  were adopted later by Ibn al-Jawzī (597/1201).3 Ibn Taymiyya is well known both for strict reliance on the Qur±an and  the Sunna and for extensive polemic against Kalām theology, Aristotelian  logic, Avicennan philosophy and the rationalizing mysticism of Ibn ≠Arabī.  Thus, he may well appear to belong to the first (Hanbalī current, having no  theological position of his own except unreflective adherence to the texts.

In the course of describing Ibn  Taymiyya’s polemical agenda, Ignaz Goldziher notes that the shaykh “relied  on the sunna and on the sunna alone.”4 More forcefully, Majid Fakhry uses  the terms “slavish traditionalism,” “antirationalist polemics” and “misology”  in describing Ibn Taymiyya’s place in the history of Islamic philosophy.5 This interpretation of Ibn Taymiyya is no longer sustainable. It is true  that the shaykh vigorously maintains that all principles of religion have  been revealed in the Qur±an and the Sunna.6 But an ardently anti-rational- ist portrayal of Ibn Taymiyya fails to make sense of three other aspects of  his writings. First, he frequently claims that knowledge derived from clear  reason (al-≠aql al- $sarī!h or al-$sarī!h al-ma≠qūl) agrees and corresponds with  revealed tradition (naql or sam≠), the message of the prophets and the way  of the Salaf.7 Further on below, I examine the roles that Ibn Taymiyya gives  reason and its dynamic equivalent the natural constitution ( fit$ ra) in acquiring  knowledge of ethical value, God’s existence and God’s attributes. This will  show clearly that his religious epistemology gives a more prominent role to  reason than his reputation would suggest.8 Second, Ibn Taymiyya explicitly permits rational theological argument  in Khaw $d, a fatwa written while in Egypt (705–712/1306–1313) whose  importance is underlined by its later inclusion near the beginning of Dar ±.9  4 Ignaz Goldziher, Introduction to Islamic Theology and Law, trans.

References to Khaw#d hereafter will be made only to Dar ±. At the point where he  begins copying Khaw#d into Dar ±, Ibn Taymiyya notes that he wrote this fatwa in Egypt. In  its intention to permit rational argument in theology, Ibn Taymiyya’s Khaw#d compares to  al-Ash≠arī’s Risāla fī isti !hsān al-khaw #d fī ≠ilm al-kalām found in Richard J. McCarthy, The  Theology of al-Ash≠arī (Beirut: Imprimerie Catholique, 1953), 85–97 (Arabic) and 117–134  </page> <page sequence="3">  theological jurisprudence 21 This text argues that it is not disliked (makrūh) to address people in their own  terms as long as the proper meanings of words are ascertained. Hadith reports  and the Qur±an may even be translated into other languages if necessary. In  order to achieve clear communication one needs to know both the meanings  of words used by the group addressed and the meanings of the terms used  in the Qur±an and the Sunna. Also, Ibn Taymiyya explains, the Salaf did  not reject Kalām terminology and argumentation as such. They were aware  that God Himself had propounded rational arguments, and they were open  to non-quranic terminology so long as it carried meanings congruent with  revelation. What the Salaf reproached in Kalām theology was using terms  in the wrong senses and misconstruing the role of rational arguments.10 In  other words Kalām theology went astray not in using reason as such but in  holding erroneous doctrines and using reason incorrectly. Third, some of my own previous research has made apparent that the  shaykh attacks Kalām theology and Avicennan philosophy not because he  opposes reason but because he articulates and defends a fundamentally differ- ent vision of God. In two earlier studies, one on the shaykh’s ≠Imrān, a hadith  commentary on the creation of the world, and the other on Ikhtiyāriyya, a  treatise on God’s voluntary attributes, I provide evidence that Ibn Taymiyya  views God in His perfection and very essence as active, creative, willing  and speaking from eternity. Whereas both the Kalām theologians and the  philosophers locate the perfection of God’s essence in timeless eternity, Ibn  Taymiyya locates it in personal and perpetual dynamism.11 Chapter Two  (trans.). However, al-Ash≠arī does not draw Ibn Taymiyya’s distinction between analogical  and a fortiori reasoning that will be explained below. Al-Ash≠arī implicitly accepts the former  in theology, whereas Ibn Taymiyya does not. 10 Dar ±, 1:28, 43–6.

Michel, A Muslim Theologian’s Response to  Christianity: Ibn Taymiyya’s Al-Jawab Al-Sahih (Delmar, NY: Caravan, 1984), 40–3. Bell and  Michel both appear to be drawing on Khaw#d. However, I could not verify this because the  printed editions they used were not available to me. Ibn Taymiyya also discusses translation  of the Qur±an for the sake of non-Arabic speakers in Man$tiq, MF 4:117, explaining that it  may be necessary to give similitudes (amthāl) to convey the meaning and that this is in fact  part of translation. In Bughya, 25, Ibn Taymiyya comments that one need only understand  the technical terms of the philosophers to grasp their intentions. He adds that this is not  only permissible but also good and sometimes obligatory. 11 Jon Hoover, “Perpetual Creativity in the Perfection of God: Ibn Taymiyya’s Hadith  Commentary on God’s Creation of this World,” Journal of Islamic Studies 15:3 (Sept. 2004):  287–329, which translates ≠Imrān, MF 18:210–243; and Jon Hoover, “God Acts by His Will  and Power: Ibn Taymiyya’s Theology of a Personal God in his Treatise on the Voluntary Attri- butes,” forthcoming in Ibn Taymiyya and His Times, ed.

If Ibn Taymiyya is not an anti-rationalist polemist and unreflective lit- eralist, what sort of theologian is he? Much work remains to be done on  the shaykh’s writings before this question may be answered adequately, but  there are important preliminary indications. In a study on a portion of Dar ±  which treats Ibn Sīnā’s interpretation of prophetic imaginal discourse as a  kind of pious fraud intended to motivate the intellectually inferior masses for  their own benefit, Yahya Michot characterizes Ibn Taymiyya’s hermeneutics  as “literalist rationalism”.12 Michot elaborates that Ibn Taymiyya rejects the  hermeneutics of both the philosophers and the Kalām theologians in order  to uphold “the self-sufficiency of the religious rationality manifested in scrip- tural literality and common faith, and its validity for all, the elite and the  crowd.”13 The nature of this egalitarian “literalist rationalism” becomes clearer  in an article by Shahab Ahmed on God’s protection (≠isma) of the Prophets  in Ibn Taymiyya’s writings. Ahmed observes that the shaykh systematizes and  reconstructs out of amorphous statements in the early authoritative sources  what the Salaf apparently taught on the issue in question and explains “the  rationale behind what they said, even if they did not say so themselves.”14 My  studies on ≠Imrān and Ikhtiyāriyya identify a similar dynamic. I note that in  ≠Imrān Ibn Taymiyya “seeks to elucidate the rationality underlying the data  on creation found in the Qur±ān and the Hadith” such that his theology may  be described as philosophical.15 In my analysis of Ikhtiyāriyya, I call him an  “apologist” seeking to elucidate and defend an “ordinary language” reading  of the theological data of revealed tradition as rational and coherent.16 The present study of Ibn Taymiyya’s theodicean writings provides further  evidence confirming such characterizations of his intention. However, calling  the shaykh an apologist or a philosophical theologian does not quite get to  the root of what he is doing. Henri Laoust in his Essai suggests a different  point of departure. Laoust explains that Ibn Taymiyya’s theology is more of  a moral theology than a theology devoted to knowing God in Himself (the  traditional intention of Christian theology): “The doctrine of Ibn Taymiyya  12 Yahya J. Michot, “A Mamlūk Theologian’s Commentary on Avicenna’s Risāla Ad# h! awiyya:  Being a Translation of a Part of the Dar ± al-Ta≠āru#d of Ibn Taymiyya, With Introduction,  Annotation, and Appendices” [Trans. of Dar ± 5:10–87], Journal of Islamic Studies 14 (2003):  149–203 (Part I) and 309–363 (Part II). 13 Michot, “A Mamlūk Theologian’s Commentary,” 171. 14 Ahmed, “Ibn Taymiyyah and the Satanic verses,” 112. 15 Hoover, “Perpetual Creativity,” 295. 16 Hoover, “God Acts by His Will and Power,” last paragraph of the article. </page> <page sequence="5">  theological jurisprudence 23 comes in fact to an ethic. Despite the importance that he grants to theol- ogy, it is not the problem of knowledge of God which preoccupies him in  the highest degree.”17 Instead, Laoust explains, at the core of Ibn Taymiyya’s  thought is service (≠ibāda) to God, which is grounded in quranic verses  such as, “I did not create the jinn and humankind except that they might  serve ( ya≠būd) Me” (Q. 51:56), and “There is no god but I; so serve Me”  (Q. 20:14). The goal of the whole ethical, juridical and political life is to  deepen this service to God. For Laoust, “It thus appears that Ibn Taymiyya’s  entire theology tends toward one sole aim: that of giving a foundation to his  ethics, and consequently, to all his juridical and social philosophy.”18 While I will translate ≠ibāda as “worship,” Laoust reminds us with the  translation “service” that the term in Ibn Taymiyya’s discourse encompasses  not only ritual practice but also matters ethical, juridical, social and political.  The worship of ≠ibāda draws together all domains of life under the rubric  of religious practice devoted solely to God. Laoust also insightfully links  Ibn Taymiyya’s theology to his ethics, but the idea that his theology aims  to give a foundation to ethics or religious practice is open to more than one  interpretation. It could mean no more than that theology constitutes the  necessary ground for ethics insofar as theology speaks of the Creator God  without whom creatures and their moral lives would cease to exist. Laoust  seems to intend more, however, especially when he writes, “Ibn Taymiyya,  who is a moralist and jurist more than a theologian, judges doctrines by their  function and their value for action.”19 In this light Ibn Taymiyya’s theology  becomes an instrumental and pragmatic effort to portray God in way that  motivates worship and obedience to God. There is some truth in what Laoust asserts. Ibn Taymiyya often con- cerns himself with the ethical implications of theological doctrines. This is  especially apparent when he traces the sources of antinomian practices to  extreme Ash≠arī views on God’s determination (qadar) and to Sufi notions  of annihilation ( fanā±) and the oneness of existence (wah! dat al-wujūd). Yet,  it is not entirely clear that Ibn Taymiyya’s interest in theology is strictly a  function of its usefulness for inspiring human action. For example, ≠Imrān, the  shaykh’s hadith commentary on the creation of the world mentioned above, is  remarkably free of instrumentalized theology. Rather, Ibn Taymiyya’s single- minded concern throughout is showing what reason and God’s messengers  17 Laoust, Essai, 177–8, 469–473 (quote on 469). 18 Laoust, Essai, 177. 19 Laoust, Essai, 158. </page> <page sequence="6"> 24 chapter one indicate on the question of whether the world is eternal or created. The  text defends and explains God’s perpetual creation of things in this world,  but it shows very little concern for ethical repercussions of this doctrine.20  A similar phenomenon is observable in Ikhtiyāriyya, the tract noted above  that explicates the voluntary and perpetually active character of many of  God’s attributes. Ibn Taymiyya does introduce the ethical imperative to call  on God and seek help from Him alone toward the end of this text, but this  is incidental to, and not a logical inference from, the central argument of  the treatise.21 Even with respect to texts like Ikhtiyariyya and ≠Imrān, there remains an  argument in Laoust’s defense: Ibn Taymiyya crafts a vision of God as active,  personal and much more intimately involved in temporal and human affairs  than the God of Kalām theology and Avicennan philosophy in order to  prompt more ready obedience to God’s law. There is little doubt that part  of the reason that Ibn Taymiyya took up his pen was to achieve such a goal.  Nevertheless, without negating Laoust’s thesis or the presence of pragmatic  and instrumental elements in Ibn Taymiyya’s theology, I propose that some- thing more fundamental is driving his theological work. That is, the shaykh’s  theology is not subservient to its functionality in achieving ethical or political  aims in the first instance. Rather, getting theological doctrine correct is an  ethical and practical concern in its own right. A passage translated by Fazlur Rahman and re-translated in part below  provides the cue for this interpretation. Here Ibn Taymiyya draws into ques- tion the commonplace division in medieval Islamic thought between the  principles (u$sūl) which deal with creedal matters and the branches ( furū≠)  which cover practical obligations and prohibitions. He prefers instead to  set theological questions and matters of action firmly on the same level  and regard both sets of issues as practical (≠amalī). From this perspective,  knowledge of God’s attributes is no different from knowledge of the practical  duties of Islam such as the Five Pillars. Likewise, denying the practical duties  is just as much unbelief as denying the theological doctrines. Issues of [theological] information (al-masā±il al-khabariyya) may be equivalent  to practical issues (al-masā±il al-≠amaliyya) even though the former are called  issues of the principles (u $sūl ) and the latter issues of the branches ( furū≠).  20 Perhaps a minor exception may be seen in Ibn Taymiyya’s explanation that God set  aside one day each week for gathered worship as a sign pointing to the first week in which  God created the world (≠Imrān, MF 18:230–231). 21 Ibn Taymiyya begins treating this ethical issue at Ikhtiyāriyya, MF 6:258. See Hoover,  “God Acts by His Will and Power,” for further discussion. </page> <page sequence="7">  theological jurisprudence 25 This designation [u $sūl and furū≠] is made up; a group of jurists and Kalām  theologians came up with this division. . . . The truth of the matter is that what  is of great importance in each of the two types [informational and practical]  are the issues of the principles and that the fine points are the issues of the  branches. So, knowing the obligatory quality of obligations such as the five  pillars of Islam and the forbidden nature of things forbidden manifestly and  by abundant transmission is like knowing that God has power over everything  and knows everything, that He is all-hearing and all-seeing, that the Qur±an  is the speech of God, and such like from among manifest and abundantly  transmitted propositions. Therefore, one who denies those practical rulings  about which there is consensus disbelieves in the same way as one who denies  these [theological doctrines] disbelieves.22 With the basic equivalence of doctrinal and practical questions in mind,  worship (≠ibāda) may now be seen to include not only ritual practice, ethics,  jurisprudence and politics but also speaking correctly about God, which, as  we will see by the end of this chapter, means speaking in a way that ascribes  to God the highest perfection and praise. From this vantage point, Ibn  Taymiyya’s theological discourse is not most fundamentally an ideological  instrument to motivate action or an attempt to know God in Himself but  a practical search to find the most praiseworthy way to depict God. Put dif- ferently, thinking and speaking well of God is part of the law (sharī ≠a), and  the shaykh’s theology is an attempt to spell out that aspect of the law. As  such, it is an exercise in jurisprudence ( fiqh), and, even though I have not  found Ibn Taymiyya speaking in precisely such terms, his theology is perhaps  more appropriately called theological fiqh. Ibn Taymiyya may thus be seen as  a theological jurist responding to inquiries and challenges concerning what  should rightly be said about God. The apologetic and philosophical quality  of this fiqh arises inasmuch as he deems it permissible, constructive or even  necessary to take up rational reflection and argumentation in theological  matters. This chapter examines the methodology of Ibn Taymiyya’s theological  fiqh in greater detail, as well as key elements of his ethics and theology that  will prove helpful for making sense of his theodicy. After first elaborating  the role that Ibn Taymiyya gives to worship in his religious vision, this chap- ter turns to epistemological foundations for knowing that God exists and  that He alone should be worshipped. It then examines how Ibn Taymiyya  22 MF 6:56–7; translated in Rahman, Revival and Reform in Islam, 143.

The Centrality of Worshipping God Alone An incident related by Ibn Taymiyya’s biographer Ibn ≠Abd al-Hādī (d.  744/1343) points to the centrality of worship (≠ibāda) in his vision of Islam.  In the year 707/1307, on Friday, 30 Rabī≠ al-Awwal, Ibn Taymiyya went to  a mosque in Cairo for the noon prayer. Some people asked him to teach,  but he said nothing. He only smiled and looked around. Then someone  quoted the quranic verse, “God made a covenant with those who were given  the Scripture that you make it clear to the people and not conceal it” (Q.  3:187). At that, Ibn Taymiyya got up, quoted the first sura of the Qur±an,  the Fātih! a, and proceeded to speak on its fifth verse, “You alone we worship;  You alone we ask for help,” and the meaning of worship and asking for help  (isti ≠āna) until the mid-afternoon (≠a$sr) prayer call, a period of perhaps two  or three hours.23 Since Ibn ≠Abd al-Hādī does not provide further details of  Ibn Taymiyya’s long discourse, we can only imagine what he might have said.  However, there is ample material in his oeuvre to elucidate his thought on  worship.24 The discussion here is limited to writings on the Fāti!ha itself. For Ibn Taymiyya, the Fāti!ha holds a privileged place in the quranic rev- elation because God made its recitation a duty during what he considers the  best of deeds, the ritual prayer ($salāh). Furthermore, he sees the fifth verse  “You alone we worship; You alone we ask for help” as both the summary  of the Fāti !ha and the pivot between its two halves. “You alone we worship”  ends the first half of the sura, which is worship dedicated to God. “You  alone we ask for help” begins the half of the Fāti!ha, which is dedicated to  the worshipper himself and in which he asks for the help that God will  provide. In this fashion, the fifth verse captures the two elements of worship  23 Ibn ≠Abd al-Hādī, Al-≠Uqūd al-durriyya, 255. 24 In addition to the sources from which the following discussion is drawn, see especially  ≠Ubūdiyya, MF 10:149–236; Qudra, MF 8:39–57; Tawh! īd, MF 1:20–36; Shirk, MF 1:88–94;  and the many selections pertaining to Ibn Taymiyya’s spirituality in the two series of transla- tions by Yahya M. Michot, “Textes Spirituels d’Ibn Taymiyya,” Le Musulman (Paris), 11–29  (1990–8), and “Pages spirituelles d’Ibn Taymiyya,” Action (Mauritius), 1999–2002.

Here Ibn Taymiyya quotes  a saying attributed to (Hasan al-Ba$srī to the effect that God summarized all  the scriptures in the Qur±an; then, He summarized the Qur±an in the Mother  of the Book, the Fāti!ha; and finally He summarized the Fāti!ha in its two  phrases, “You alone we serve, You alone we ask for help.”25 Ibn Taymiyya also finds the senses of worship and asking for help grouped  together elsewhere in the Qur±an and the Hadith just as they are in the Fātih! a.  He cites for example, “Worship Him, and trust completely in Him” (Q.  11:123), “In Him I have completely trusted, and to Him I turn” (Q. 11:88),  and, “In Him I have completely trusted, and to Him is my repentance” (Q.  13:30). Turning to God (ināba) and going to God in repentance (tawba)  are aspects of worship, and complete trust (tawakkul) is related to asking for  help. In the hadith, “O Lord, this is from You and for You,”26 Ibn Taymiyya  interprets “for You (laka)” as worship and “from You (minka)” as complete  trust and asking for help in the midst of whatever comes from God.27 In God’s relationship with humanity, worship is linked to God’s divinity  (ulūhiyya or ilāhiyya) and asking for help to God’s lordship (rubūbiyya or  rabbāniyya).28 Ibn Taymiyya observes that these respective senses of divinity  and lordship are found in the locutions of prayer. The name God (Allāh),  which has the same Arabic root (±-l-h) as ulūhiyya, is associated with wor- ship, as in “God is greater (Allāhu akbar)” and “Praise be to God (al-!hamdu  li-llāh),” while the name Lord (Rabb), which has the same root (r-b-b) as  rubūbiyya, is linked with seeking help, as in “Our Lord, forgive us our sins”  (Q. 3:147) and “Lord, forgive and be merciful; You are the best of the merci- ful” (Q. 23:118).29 Thus, as illustrated in the following quotation, worship  flows out of God’s divinity, and asking for help springs from His lordship. [“You alone we worship; You alone we ask for help” (Q. 1:5)] is the elaboration  of His saying, “Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds” (Q 1:2). This indicates  that there is no object of worship except God and that no one other than Him  has the right to be worshipped. His statement, “You alone we worship,” points  to worship of Him by means of the love, fear, hope, command and prohibition  25 Manbijī, MF 2:455–6; Talbīs, 2:454; and Fāti!ha, MF 14:7. 26 Dārimī, 1864, Al-A#dā!hī, Al-Sunna fī al-a#d!hiyya. 27 Manbijī, MF 2:456; and Fāti!ha, MF 14:9. 28 Paralleling divinity and lordship in Ibn Taymiyya’s writings is a wide range of cognate  terms including God’s command and creation and God’s legislative will and ontological will,  respectively, which will be discussed in detail in Chapter Three. 29 Manbijī, MF 2:456; and Fāti!ha, MF 14:12–3. </page> <page sequence="10"> 28 chapter one that His divinity requires, and, “You alone we ask for help,” points to the  complete trust, commitment, and submission that His lordship requires.30 For Ibn Taymiyya, asking for help signifies absolute human dependence on  the God who is the Lord of the worlds. Lordship indicates God’s creative  and determining activity, and this lordship is exclusive. Creatures have  absolutely no existence apart from God, and they may ask for help only  from the source of their existence and trust in Him alone. The confession  that God is the sole Creator and Lord of the universe is called taw !hīd al- rubūbiyya or tawh! īd al-rabbāniyya. In like manner, worship indicates human  devotion to God—turning to Him, loving Him, obeying Him, hoping in  Him and fearing Him—and this is linked to God’s divinity (ulūhiyya). The  divine is that which is loved and served as a god, and God’s divinity denotes  His essential right to worship. Taw !hīd al-ulūhiyya or taw!hīd al-ilāhiyya is  recognizing God as the only one with the right to divinity and turning to  worship Him alone. This, as Ibn Taymiyya explains, is the meaning of the  Islamic confession, “There is no god but God.” Unifying all one’s energies in  worship to God excludes any kind of shirk or associating partners with God  and withholding from God the devotion that only He deserves.31 Ibn Taymiyya clarifies the ultimate priority of God’s divinity over God’s  lordship—and thus worship over asking for help—with the aid of Ibn Sīnā’s  notions of final and efficient causality. Ibn Sīnā regards the final cause or telos  (al-≠illa al-ghā±iyya) as the end for which something comes into existence,  while the efficient cause (al-≠illa al-fā≠iliyya) is that which brings the thing  into existence. Furthermore, the final cause is an efficient cause in that it  activates the operation of the efficient cause. Conversely, the final cause is also  the effect (ma≠lūl) of the efficient cause when it is realized in existence.32 Ibn  Taymiyya applies this analysis to “You alone we worship; You alone we ask  for help” by linking worship and divinity to final causality on the one hand  and asking for help and lordship to efficient causality on the other: The God (al-ilāh) is the one worshipped (al-ma≠būd) and asking for help is  linked to His lordship. The Lord of the servants is He who lords over them.  This entails that He is Creator of everything that is in them and from them. The  divinity is the final cause, and lordship is the efficient cause. The final [cause]  is that which is aimed at, and it is the efficient cause of the efficient cause.  Therefore, He made “You alone we worship” precede “You alone we ask for  help.” Confessing the exclusiveness of the divinity (tawh! īd al-ilāhiyya) includes  30 Shirk, MF 1:89. 31 Taw !hīd, MF 1:22–3; and Manbijī, MF 2:456–9.

Included in  worshipping only God is not confessing the lordship of any other.33 This text subordinates lordship to divinity such that divinity is both the  final cause, that is, the ultimate object of worship, and the efficient cause of  confessing God’s lordship, which in turn is the efficient cause bringing all  things into existence. Exclusive worship of God includes confessing God as  the sole Creator. In a different text, and as in the passage quoted above, Ibn  Taymiyya observes that the Fāti !ha in “You alone we worship; You alone we  ask for help” (Q. 1:5) puts the final cause of worship before the efficient  cause of asking for help because the final cause should be the efficient cause  of this efficient cause. Ideally speaking, worship activates and is the efficient  cause of asking for help. Yet, Ibn Taymiyya observes, humans, out of their  sense of profound neediness, typically confess God’s lordship and ask for  His help much more than they worship Him. Thus, God raised up mes- sengers to focus on calling humanity to worship God alone. Then, when  humans worship God, it will follow that they also confess His lordship and  ask Him for help.34 Putting it differently, God should be worshipped, loved,  and praised primarily for Himself in His divinity and only secondarily for  what He does in His lordship. With the priority of worship in Ibn Taymiyya’s thought firmly in view, we  turn now to the epistemological foundations by which human beings know  that God exists and should be their sole object of worship. Ibn Taymiyya  bases his thought on quranic revelation, even if interpreting it philosophi- cally, but he also makes the apologetic claim that independent reason agrees  with revelation in providing the same information. The Correspondence of Reason and Revelation Ibn Taymiyya devotes his major work Dar ±, eleven volumes in the critical edi- tion, to refutation of the rule established by Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī and others  that rational arguments must be given precedence over traditional proofs in  case of contradiction.35 Instead, the shaykh contends, there is no contradiction  between reason and tradition. Two studies by Binyamin Abrahamov illustrate  that it is not immediately obvious what Ibn Taymiyya means by this. In a  33 Talbīs, 2:454.

Reason does not disagree with revelation because it  has no status apart from revelation.37 Later, Abrahamov explicitly rejects his former conclusion. In a 1998  general study of reason and revelation in Islamic theology, he briefly argues  that for Ibn Taymiyya there are rational arguments arising from the human  intellect independently of revelation, which are valid so long as they do not  contradict revelation. Reason is thus an independent source for knowledge  of God. Abrahamov does not present his case in detail, and he does not  investigate the nature of the rational proofs in question, but what follows  here supports his latter conclusion.38 Yahya Michot, in the introduction to his French translation of Ibn  Taymiyya’s letter to the Syrian prince Abū al-Fidā± (d. 732/1331), conceives  the matter somewhat differently. Drawing upon Dar ± and the letter to Abū  al-Fidā±, Michot explains that for Ibn Taymiyya the Qur±an and the Sunna  are the summit and peak where the two paths of reason and tradition come  together and from where they depart. Whatever contradicts the Qur±an and  the Sunna lies outside the pale of rationality. Thus, the proofs of reason,  rightly exercised, lead to the same end as do the proofs of tradition, and  they derive from the same source.39 A passage from Ibn Taymiyya’s letter  36 In an earlier article in Arabic, ≠Abd al-Majīd al-!Saghīr elaborates similarities between  Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Rushd, “Mawāqif rushdiyya li-Taqī al-Dīn Ibn Taymiyya?

[The Salaf and their followers] knew that both revelational and rational proofs  were true and that they entailed one another. Whoever gave rational and certain  proofs (al-adilla al-≠aqliyya al-yaqīniyya) the complete inquiry due them knew  that they agreed with what the messengers informed about and that they proved  to them the necessity of believing the messengers in what they informed about.  Whoever gave revelational proofs (al-adilla al-sam≠iyya) the understanding  due them knew that God guided His servants in His Book to certain rational  proofs by which are known the existence of the Creator, the subsistence of  His attributes of perfection and His exoneration from imperfections and from  anything being like Him in the attributes of perfection, and which prove His  uniqueness, the uniqueness of His lordship, the uniqueness of His divinity,  His power, His knowledge, His wisdom, His mercy, the truthfulness of His  messengers, the obligation to obey them in what they obligate and command,  and believing them in what they teach and inform about.40 According to this text, revelation reiterates the correct rational proofs per- tinent to religion. As Ibn Taymiyya explains elsewhere, revelation contains  both information (khabar) and rational proofs. The rational proofs are both  revelational (shar≠ī) by virtue of being brought by God and His messengers  and rational (≠aqlī) since they are judged true by reason. The shaykh also notes  in the letter to Abū al-Fidā± and elsewhere that Kalām theologians, as well  as philosophers—by whom he usually means the Aristotelian Neoplatonists  al-Farābī (d. 339/950) and Ibn Sīnā—err when they confine revelation to  the domain of information.41 To put the matter in another way, revelation  embodies true rationality. Once one has access to revelation, one identifies  it immediately as identical to whatever truth one knew previously through  reason. In this vein, Ibn Taymiyya observes that the truthfulness of the  between revelation and reason should exist.

Wael B. Hallaq, Ibn Taymiyya against the Greek Logi- cians (Oxford, UK: Clarendon Press, 1993), 4 n. 1, rightly explains that the terms falāsifa  and mutafalsifa are in fact synonymous in referring to the wider philosophical tradition. The  term mutafalsifa is not limited to the Ishrāqīs. </page> <page sequence="14"> 32 chapter one prophets can be known only through reason.42 Conversely, the revelation  immediately exposes irrational ideas for what they are.43 Ibn Taymiyya sets limits to what reason can know in theology and ethics.  Revelation is required to know “the details of what [the prophets] informed  concerning theological matters (al-umūr al-ilāhiyya), the angels, the Throne,  Paradise, the Fire and the details of what is commanded and prohibited.”44  However, rational proofs, the best of which are found in the Qur±an, estab- lish God’s existence, God’s attributes, and the obligation to believe and obey  what God brings through His messengers. On Knowing that God Exists and that He Alone should be Worshipped Reason and the Law Ibn Taymiyya reports that reason (≠aql ) has two meanings in the Islamic  tradition. For A !hmad b. (Hanbal it is a potency (quwwa) and an instinct  (gharīza) by which one reasons. For others, including Kalām theologians,  reason is a body of necessary knowledge (#darb min al-≠ulūm al-#darūriyya).  Ibn Taymiyya says that both are true, and he compares ≠aql to the word bas$ ar,  which in Arabic may refer both to the faculty of sight and to the perception  of seeing with this faculty.45 The shaykh explains that reason knows the foundational rules of thought:  that like things are alike, that different things are different, and that two  things cannot exist in the same place at the same time. For example, it is  neither rational nor possible to combine black and white in one place at one  time, and something cannot be simultaneously existent and nonexistent.46  Without acknowledging the sources of his ideas, Ibn Taymiyya also affirms  that reason knows metaphysical notions relating to efficient causality that  42 Abū al-Fidā±, 160. 43 Michel, A Muslim Theologian’s Response to Christianity, 129, makes much the same obser- vation in discussing the epistemology of Ibn Taymiyya’s refutation of Christianity in Jawāb  al-!Sa!hī!h: “[Ibn Taymiyya holds that] truth is unitary. Whatever has been truly revealed can  never be contradicted by what is known through reason and sense perception, but can only  be confirmed by such information. Similarly whatever is correctly known from intellectual  knowledge or from accurate sense perception must be confirmed by revelation.” As Michel  notes, the shaykh also holds sense perception to be a valid source of knowledge. 44 Furqān, MF 13:138. 45 Istiqāma, 2:161–2; and Bughya, 31–40, which gives a very detailed discussion of the  meaning of ≠aql. 46 Qudra, MF 8:9; and Jawāb, 4:391, 396–7. </page> <page sequence="15">  theological jurisprudence 33 are basic to Kalām theology and the philosophy of Ibn Sīnā. With Kalām  theology, it is known by clear reason that an existent is either originated  (mu!hdath) or eternal, either created or uncreated, and with Ibn Sīnā, it is  known by clear reason that an existent is either necessary in itself (wājib  bi-nafsihi) or not necessary by itself, either sufficient apart from another  (ghanī ≠ammā siwāhu) or in need of another.47 With these metaphysical oppositions in place, the shaykh sets forth simple  and direct cosmological arguments for God’s existence. The existence of the  Creator is known necessarily by reason from the fact of created existence. It  is commonsense that everything needs a cause and that all things must have  an originator that is ultimately eternal and self-sufficient: “The originated  being itself knows through clear reason that it has an originator.”48 Every  creature is by its very existence a sign necessarily entailing the essence, unity  and attributes of the Creator, and it is the way of the prophets to point to  God by mentioning these signs.49 The existence of the Self-Sufficient and  the Eternal Existent which is Necessary in Itself is known by “the necessity  of reason ( #darūrat al-≠aql )” and from the need of every originated event  for an originator (mu!hdith), as well as from the need of something possible  (mumkin) for something else to give it existence (mūjid).50 Ibn Taymiyya contrasts his straight-forward proofs for God’s existence  from ≠aql with the Kalām method of rational inference (naz) ar) which proves  the existence of the Creator by indirect cosmological arguments appealing to  the origination of accidents and the composition of bodies from atoms.51 He  criticizes especially the Mu≠tazilīs and some Ash≠arī and H( anbalī theologians  for making naz) ar the initial human obligation.52 He argues that this method,  whose origins he traces to Jahm b. !Safwān (d. 128/745), is not a necessary  basis for knowledge of God’s existence.

Reason knows that  the Creator must be the sole object of worship and that nothing may be  associated with Him.56 Reason also knows which human actions are good  (!hasan) and which are bad (qabī#h). This is because good and bad reduce to  the difference between suitability, pleasure, profit and benefit for the agent  on one hand and unsuitability, incompatibility, pain, harm and detriment on  the other.57 In this regard, the shaykh notes the view of Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī  that reason knows whether an act is an attribute of perfection (kamāl) or of  imperfection (naq$s).58 Ibn Taymiyya rightly remarks that only later Kalām  theologians use such terms and that al-Rāzī got this from the philosophers.  Be that as it may, the shaykh reduces perfection and imperfection also to  pleasure and pain and the suitable and incompatible: The perfection that occurs to the human being through some acts goes back to  agreement and opposition, which is pleasure and pain. The soul takes pleasure  in what is a perfection for it, and it suffers pain in the imperfection. So, perfec- tion and imperfection go back to the suitable and the incompatible.59 Similarly, Ibn Taymiyya relates other value terms to suitability and pleasure:  “It is known that knowledge, justice, truthfulness and beneficence are suitable  for humans and that they take pleasure in these. Moreover, their pleasure in  these is greater than in anything else. This is what it means for an act to be  good.”60 In like manner, the terms good deed (h! asana) and evil deed (sayyi±a)  53 Nubuwwāt, 59–63ff., and Dar ±, 7:141–10:318, which gives an extensive treatment of  the Kalām theologians’ and philosophers’ means of knowing God’s existence. 54 Dar ±, 10:317. 55 Nubuwwāt, 71–2, 74. 56 Tawba, MF 11:682. 57 I!htijāj, MF 8:308–9; Man$tiqiyyīn, 422; Ta!hsīn al-≠aql, MF 8:434–5; and Nubuwwāt,  139.

Generally speaking, value terms in Ibn Taymiyya’s discourse reduce  to considerations of benefit and detriment. It is a special quality of human  reason to know and seek profit and to know and repel harm.63 The shaykh contrasts his theory of ethical value with the theories of  the Mu≠tazilīs and the Ash≠arīs. What George Hourani calls the “rational  objectivism” of the Mu≠tazilīs locates good and bad in objective qualities of  acts themselves. An act is good or bad on account of an attribute essential  to the act and necessarily concomitant with it. Thus, the value of this act is  known by reason, and the function of God’s command and prohibition is  not to assign values to acts but to unveil them. Moreover, a bad act deserves  chastisement in the hereafter even without the warning of a messenger. At the  other end of the spectrum is Ash≠arī divine voluntarism or “theistic subjectiv- ism” (Hourani) in which good and bad depend solely on God’s will. Acts are  good or bad only because God commands or prohibits them. There are no  attributes in acts making them good or bad. Their value can be known only  by revelation. Ibn Taymiyya claims polemically that the Ash≠arīs make God’s  command wholly arbitrary and devoid of regard for human benefit.64 As is already apparent, Ibn Taymiyya adopts a third view, a teleological or  consequentialist ethic in which acts depend on their final benefit for their  value. An act does not have an essential attribute ($sifa dhātiyya) that makes  it good or bad. Rather, something may be good, loved and profitable in some  circumstances and bad, hated and harmful in others.65 Acts have attributes by  61 I!htijāj, MF 8:309. 62 Irāda, MF 8:93–4; and (Hasana, MF 14:268–9.

The bad is that which procures what is hated and  loathed.”67 Some things like eating meat that has not been ritually slaughtered  may be bad in some circumstances and good in others.68 Ibn Taymiyya claims wide consensus for the proposition that good and  bad defined in this teleological and benefit-oriented manner are known  rationally.69 This is in fact the case, especially among the philosophizing  Ash≠arī Kalām theologians that dominate the later medieval period. With  beginnings in al-Juwaynī (d. 478/1085) and clear formulation in al-Ghazālī  (d. 505/1111), later Ash≠arīs interpret the Mu≠tazilī objectivist notions of  good and bad in terms of profit and harm, pleasure and pain, and suitability  and unsuitability. Additionally, they hold that these effects are known by  reason. However, later Ash≠arīs maintain that reason cannot know whether  an act is praiseworthy or blameworthy and rewarded or punished. This can  be known only through the Law.70 Ibn Taymiyya is not sympathetic to this  Ash≠arī qualification, and he unsuccessfully tries to reduce it also to a matter  of profit and harm. He argues, “In reality this controversy comes back to  the suitable and the unsuitable, the profitable and the harmful. Blame and  punishment are among the things that harm the servant and are unsuit- able for him.”71 While it is intuitive that blame and punishment cause pain  and harm, this does not address the question of whether one knows about  blame and punishment—especially in the hereafter—through reason. In a  different text, Ibn Taymiyya does say that the ultimate ends of acts can be  known only through the revealed Law: “Knowledge of the end which is the  consequence of acts, that is, happiness and unhappiness in the hereafter, is  known only by the Law.”72 66 Minhāj, 3:178/2:34. 67 Minhāj, 3:29/1:270. 68 Minhāj, 3:29/1:270. 69 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:115; Irāda, MF 8:90; I!htijāj, MF 8:309; and Man$tiqiyyīn, 422–3. 70 Al-Julaynad, Qad# iyyat al-khayr wa al-sharr, 252–8; Gardet, Dieu et la destinée de l’homme,  82–3; Sherman A.

Ibn Taymiyya asserts that God’s command is directed  toward the wise purpose (!hikma) and mercy of promoting human benefit.73  He writes, “[God] commanded and prohibited according to His knowledge  of the benefits and detriments to servants in the command, the prohibition,  the thing commanded and the thing forbidden.”74 Likewise, God raised up  messengers to bring benefits and reduce detriments.75 Beyond this, the shaykh identifies three types of divine command.76 In  the first, God’s command and prohibition confirm that humans should do  and not do what their reason already knows is good and bad, respectively.77  One example of this is the quranic verse, “[God] commanded them to the  right and prohibited them from the wrong, and He made agreeable things  lawful for them and forbade disgusting things for them” (Q. 7:157). Ibn  Taymiyya says that this indicates that these things are right or wrong, agree- able or disgusting, apart from God’s command. Otherwise, the verse becomes  tautologous: “He commanded them what He commanded them . . .”78 Ibn Taymiyya clarifies that, in this first type, God does not punish acts  known to be bad until He sends a messenger. He bases this on quranic texts  such as “We do not chastise until We raise up a messenger” (Q. 17:15) and  “Your Lord never destroyed the towns until He raised up a messenger in their  leading town reciting Our verses to them. We never destroyed the towns  unless their people were unjust” (Q. 28:59).79 God first sent messengers to  condemn what was already known to be bad. This was followed by prohi- bition and warning of chastisement.80 The shaykh observes that this differs  from the Ash≠arīs for whom bad acts prior to revelation were as indifferent  as eating and drinking and that it also opposes the Mu≠tazilīs for whom bad  acts are punished even apart from the warning of a messenger.81 In dealing with an objection that there is no meaning to a bad act that  is not punished, Ibn Taymiyya draws a distinction between two kinds of  73 Man$tiqiyyīn, 237. 74 Ta!hsīn al-≠aql, MF 8:434. 75 Minhāj, 3:84. 76 This three-fold typology occurs in Ta !hsīn al-≠aql, MF 8:434–6; and Thulth, MF  17:201–3. 77 Ta!hsīn al-≠aql, MF 8:434–5. 78 Minhāj, 3:178–9/2:34. 79 Ta!hsīn al-≠aql, MF 8:435. 80 Tawba, MF 11:677–682. 81 Ta !hsīn al-≠aql, MF 8:435; Tawba, MF 11:680–1; MF 19:215; and Nubuwwāt, 240.  Despite Ibn Taymiyya’s polemic, the later Mu≠tazilī Qur±an commentator al-Zamakhsharī  holds an identical position. See al-Julaynad, Qa#diyyat al-khayr wa al-sharr, 247. </page> <page sequence="20"> 38 chapter one ‘bad’ and two kinds of ‘punishment’ (≠iqāb). First, bad means that the act  is a cause of punishment of the kind that God deals out after a messenger’s  warning. Second, bad means blameworthy, imperfect and defective. Bad acts  in this sense entail a “punishment of deprivation of good ( !hirmān khayr),”  which results from not doing what is better. Thus, those who commit bad  acts before the arrival of messengers suffer the punishment of imperfection,  but they do not suffer direct punishment from God. In this connection  the shaykh also mentions that there are traditions reporting that those who  have never received a messenger will have one sent to them on the Day of  Resurrection.82 In the second kind of divine command and prohibition, an act becomes  good or bad by the pronouncement of God, but it still entails benefit and  detriment. Ibn Taymiyya notes that God may specify places like the Ka≠ba  and times like the month of Ramad# ān in which to dispense greater quantities  of His mercy, beneficence and blessing. As examples of this second kind of  command, he also cites the prohibition against drinking wine. In response  to the objection that the forbidding of wine was arbitrary, the shaykh says  that God prohibited it at the time dictated by His wise purpose. Something  may be profitable at one time and harmful at another, or something that  is harmful may not be prohibited if its prohibition might result in greater  detriment. In the case of wine, God did not prohibit it completely until the  early Muslims had adequate faith to withstand its prohibition.83 The third type of divine command is the trial. The primary example Ibn  Taymiyya mentions is God’s command to Abraham to sacrifice his son. The  shaykh explains that such a sacrifice would have brought no benefit. Rather,  God tried Abraham to see whether his love for Him was greater than his love  for his son. God’s intention was to remove anything that might have come  between them and to perfect Abraham’s friendship with Himself.84 To sum up, Ibn Taymiyya believes that reason provides knowledge of God’s  existence, His right to exclusive worship, and the broad foundations of ethics.  82 Tawba, MF 11:686–7. 83 Thulth, MF 17:201–2; and Ta!hsīn al-≠aql, MF 8:435–6. 84 Thulth, MF 17:203. Cf. Minhāj, 3:20/1:267. In another example, Ibn Taymiyya, Tah! sīn  al-≠aql, MF 8:436, and Thulth, MF 17:203, cites a hadith about a leper, a bald-headed man  and a blind man in the collection of Bukhārī, 3205, A!hādīth al-anbiyā±, (Hadīth abra$s wa  a≠mā wa aqra≠ fī Banī Isrā±īl. In this hadith, God sent an angel to restore the skin, hair and  sight of each of these men, respectively, and to grant them wealth. Then the angel appeared  to them each as a needy traveler in their previous respective forms asking for help. Only the  blind man responded. Then the angel told the blind man to keep his property because it  was only a trial. </page> <page sequence="21">  theological jurisprudence 39 The Law brings a higher level of accountability and some information about  God’s command and recompense that cannot be known otherwise, but the  Law confirms and is fully compatible with what is known independently  by reason. Although Ibn Taymiyya’s teleological ethic sets him at odds with  both poles in the traditional Ash≠arī and Mu≠tazilī debate over the rational  discernment of good and bad, he is nonetheless firmly within the mainstream  of later philosophizing Kalām views on ethical value. As we will see in later  chapters, this position offers him a vantage point from which to polemicize  against both the Mu≠tazilī and Ash≠arī positions on God’s justice and on  the relation of God’s creation to God’s command. The shaykh’s teleological  outlook also appears in the following treatment of another source of religious  knowledge, the natural constitution. The Natural Constitution (fi$tra) and its Perfection through Prophecy The natural constitution ( fi$tra) in Ibn Taymiyya’s thought is an innate fac- ulty or knowledge that is closely linked to reason (≠aql), but it is difficult  to pinpoint the exact relationship.85 The shaykh occasionally uses ≠aql and  fit$ ra or their derivatives in parallel.86 In other places, the natural constitution  appears to be the basis for reason. For example, the shaykh speaks of “the  rational methods (al- $turuq al-≠aqliyya) that people endowed with reason  know by their natural constitutions,”87 and he writes, “What is intended by  the term object of reason (ma≠qūl) is the clear object of reason that people  know by their natural constitutions upon which they have been naturally  constituted.”88 However, the following statement could be cited to sup- port the opposite thesis—that reason is the basis of the natural constitu- tion—“Rational propositions (al-qa #dāyā al-≠aqliyya) are the foundations  85 Nurcholish Madjid, “Ibn Taymiyya on Kalām and Falsafa: A problem of Reason and  Revelation in Islam,” (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1985), 85–7, argues that ≠aql and  fi $tra are synonymous in Ibn Taymiyya’s thought, but he gives relatively little evidence for  this. For an overview of fi$tra in various domains of Islamic thought, see Geneviève Gobillot,  La fi $tra: la conception originelle: ses interprétations et fonctions chez les penseurs musulmans  (Cairo: Institut français d’archéologie orientale, 2000).

These include the basic rules of  thought. God has placed knowledge of likeness and difference in the natural  constitution.90 It is known by the natural constitution that a body or person  cannot be in two places at once. The shaykh adds that if in fact it appears  that a person is in two places simultaneously, then one of the appearances  is actually that of a jinn who has adopted the form of the person.91 As with  reason, the shaykh also frequently claims that the existence of the Creator  is known by the natural constitution through direct cosmological proofs.  All human beings in their natural constitutions know necessarily that the  creature needs a creator, maker and governor (mudabbir) and that an origi- nated event needs an originator. Something possible needs a preponderator  (murajji!h) to tip the scales in favor of its existence over its nonexistence.  This fundamental affirmation of external determinative causality, or what  may be called the ‘principle of preponderance’, corresponds to humanity’s  fundamental felt need for and dependence upon God.92 Even the insane are  aware of their need for a creator.93 Wael Hallaq, in an article on Ibn Taymiyya’s proofs for God’s existence,  points out that the shaykh’s views of the natural constitution appear inconsis- tent.94 Ibn Taymiyya sometimes presents the natural constitution as a means  or faculty for knowing necessarily from created things that they must have  a creator. Created things are signs pointing immediately to God. At other  times, however, he regards the natural constitution as an inborn knowledge  of God requiring no evidence whatsoever. In this vein, he argues that natural  constitutions must know the Creator without signs: “If [the natural con- stitutions] had not known Him apart from the signs, they would not have  89 MF 12:229. 90 Jahd, 9:242/Man$tiqiyyīn, 382. 91 Jawāb, 4:397. 92 Furqān, MF 13:151; Fī Wujūb, MF 1:45,47; Irāda, MF 8:136; Dar ±, 8:348; and Fi$tra,  MRK 2:341, 344–5, 348. 93 Fi$tra, MRK 2:337. Ibn Taymiyya also claims in (Hamawiyya, MF 5:15, that it is known  by the natural constitution that God is above the sky. 94 Wael B. Hallaq, “Ibn Taymiyya on the Existence of God,” Acta Orientalia 52 (1991):  49–69, argues that Ibn Taymiyya reserves the term ≠aql for the faculty conducting inferential  operations (55). In view of the presentation of ≠aql above, I do not believe that this is sustain- able because ≠aql, like fi$tra, includes innately held principles and beliefs. </page> <page sequence="23">  theological jurisprudence 41 known that these signs [pointed] to Him.”95 Hallaq observes that the latter  argument is circular and that it contradicts the former. Further investigation shows that Ibn Taymiyya probed the matter more  deeply, especially in the direction of the natural constitution being a faculty,  yet one that necessarily entails knowledge of the Creator without signs. To  examine this, it is helpful to begin with the textual basis for the doctrine of  the natural constitution, a hadith found in the collections of Bukhārī and  Muslim: Every newborn is born with the natural constitution. Then, his parents make  him a Jew, Christian or Zoroastrian. This is like an animal that bears another  that is perfect of limb. Do you sense any mutilation in it? Then Abū Hurayra  said: If you wish, recite, “The natural constitution ( fi$tra) of God according to  which He has constituted ( fa$tara) humanity” (Q. 30:30).96 The shaykh interprets the natural constitution in this hadith to be the religion  of Islam, and he connects this to the covenant God made with all humanity  in primordial time, “[The Lord said], ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said, ‘Yes,  indeed’” (Q. 7:172). However, he explains that this Islam does not exist in  actuality (bi-l-fi ≠l) at birth because the newborn does not have knowledge of  anything. Yet, as his innate potency (quwwa) of knowledge and will become  active, the knowledge of God that the natural constitution entails arises as  well so long as there are no impediments.97 In a part of Dar ± not accessible to Hallaq, Ibn Taymiyya observes that  teaching is not a sufficient condition for imparting knowledge.98 Teaching  animals and inanimate objects does not yield the same results as teaching  human beings. There must be a potency entailing knowledge and will that is  receptive to what is taught, and this potency is created so as to preponderate  the true religion over any other. It is possible that inner voices (khawā $tir)  in the soul alert it to the true religion without external teaching, and, apart  from corrupting influences, this will indeed happen. To deal with the prob- lem of circularity, the shaykh still has resort to external determinative causes.  He says that these inner voices arise through the inspiration of an angel or  95 Fī Wujūb, MF 1:48; and Hallaq, “Ibn Taymiyya on the Existence of God,” 65. 96 Bukhārī, 1270, Al-Janā±iz, Idhā aslama al- $sabī fa-māta; Bukhārī 1296, Al-Janā±iz, Mā  qīla fī awlād al-mushrikīn; Muslim, 4803–7. 97 Dar ±, 8:460–1; and MF 4:245–9.

Yet, he insists that they do not arise  from human teaching and calling. Guidance through human intermediaries  is not a necessary condition for knowing the true religion. Ibn Taymiyya  compares the natural constitution to an infant’s instinct for his mother’s  milk. If nothing impedes the infant, such as illness in himself or his mother,  he will necessarily drink. The shaykh adds that the natural constitution to  believe in God is even stronger than the infant’s instinct.99 In Ibn Taymiyya’s view, the natural constitution also dictates what is good  for humans to do and love. God has constituted humans to will naturally what  is profitable for them and repel what is harmful: “The [human being] has  been naturally constituted to will what he must inevitably have and to hate  what harms him and injures him.”100 This corresponds to loving what is good  and right and hating what is bad and wrong. Justice (≠adl) is good because it  is beloved to the natural constitution and yields pleasure, joy and profit to  oneself and others. Injustice ( )zulm) is bad because the natural constitution  knows that it is hateful and causes pain, trouble and torment. Humans have  been naturally constituted to love and find pleasure in justice, truthfulness,  beneficence and knowledge just as they have been naturally constituted to  find pleasure in food and drink.101 Moreover, God has naturally constituted  human beings to love and worship Him alone. To be a willing being is an  essential concomitant of the natural constitution. A willing being necessarily  has a god toward which it directs its love and which it loves for itself. Apart  from corrupting influences, this ultimate object of the natural constitution’s  will and love will be God. Thus, a child left on his own will necessarily come  to know, praise, love and worship his Lord.102 In Dar ±, Ibn Taymiyya sums  up the religion of the natural constitution in terms of exclusive worship of  God as the end for which creatures are created and the “lawfulness of good  things” as the means toward this end: The foundation of the religion upon which God naturally constituted His  servants—as He said, “I have created My servants original believers ( !hunafā±).   99 Dar ±, MF 8:461–4. In Ma !habba, 9 and 23, Ibn Taymiyya gives angels the role of  bringing forth all the motion in the universe that lies outside the capability of humans, jinn  and animals. 100 ≠Abd al-Qādir, MF 10:481.

The first of them is worship of  God alone without associate. He is worshipped only through what He loves  and has commanded. This is the objective for which God created creatures.  Contrary to this is associationism and innovation. Second is the lawfulness of  agreeable things ($tayyibāt) in which help is sought toward the objective. This  is the means (wasīla). Contrary to this is forbidding the lawful.104 Despite Ibn Taymiyya’s optimistic view of the natural constitution’s ability to  know God and the purpose of worship for which it was created, the above  quotation also indicates that it may become corrupted by satans (shayā$tīn).  In scattered references, the shaykh cites many things that may corrupt the  natural constitution. In addition to satans from among humans and jinn,  ignorance and heedlessness play a detrimental role.105 As noted in the hadith  on the natural constitution, parents may make a child a Jew, Christian or  Zoroastrian.106 Also, vain doctrines may corrupt the natural constitution  “like a veil blocking the eyesight from seeing the sun.”107 Pride, ill purposes,  and divided love for God all exert their corrupting influences.108 In view of corrupted natural constitutions, Ibn Taymiyya notes that one  of the best ways to reach necessary knowledge is through purifying the soul  and spiritual disciplines.109 Inferential methods may also be needed and even  obligatory to discern the existence of the Creator.110 However, Ibn Taymiyya  distinguishes between the invalid rational inquiry (naz) ar) of Kalām theology  on the one hand and the valid na)zar of examining the guidance brought by  the Messenger and inferring the Creator from the existence of the human  being on the other.111 It is in fact part of the role of messengers, the Qur±an  and the Sunna to make the correct rational proofs obvious to those whose  natural constitutions have become corrupt.112 In addition to revealing details  of the Law that cannot be known by the natural constitution, messengers  have been sent to those who have suffered corruption in order to set the  103 Muslim, 5109, Al-Janna wa $sifāt na≠īmihā, Al- !Sifāt allatī yu≠raf bihā fī al-dunyā ahl  al-janna. . . . 104 Dar ±, 8:455. 105 (Hasana, MF 14:296–7. 106 Amrā#d, MF 10:135. 107 MF 4:247. 108 Minhāj, 5:403/3:101. 109 Fi$tra, MRK 2:341. 110 Fi$tra, MRK 2:341, 345.  111 Nubuwwāt, 62–73; and Ma≠ārij, MF 19:172. 112 Jahd, 9:242/Man$tiqiyyīn, 382. </page> <page sequence="26"> 44 chapter one natural constitution back on the right path and complete and perfect it.113  The following passage from Ibn Taymiyya’s Nubuwwāt elaborates this: The Prophet, he and the rest of the believers inform only of the truth. They  command only justice. They command the right and they prohibit the wrong. . . .  They were raised up to perfect the natural constitution and firmly establish it,  not to replace it and change it. They command only what agrees with what is  right to rational minds which pure hearts accept with receptivity. So too, they  themselves did not differ, and they did not contradict one another. Rather,  their religion and their faith were one even if the laws were of diverse kinds.  They also agree with the obligation of the natural constitution according to  which God constituted His servants. [They] agree with rational proofs and  do not contradict them at all. . . . The prophets perfected the natural constitu- tion and made humankind see. As has been said concerning the description  of Mu !hammad—God bless him and give him peace—that through him God  opens the eyes of the blind, the ears of the deaf and hearts that are closed. Their  opponents corrupt sense perception and reason just as they have corrupted the  proofs of revelation.114 A similar passage in another work points to the role of messengers in perfect- ing the natural constitution for the sake of blessing in Paradise. God—Exalted is He—raised up the messengers to perfect the natural consti- tution. They indicated to human beings that by which they obtain blessing  in the hereafter and are saved from the chastisement of the hereafter. The  difference between what is commanded and what is forbidden is like the dif- ference between Paradise and the Fire, pleasure and pain, and blessing and  chastisement.115 The role then of prophets and messengers for Ibn Taymiyya is purifying  humans of corrupting influences and perfecting the natural constitution  in which they were created, which is to love God alone and dedicate their  religion solely to Him.116 This involves pointing to what is known to be just  and right in reason and guiding them on the path to Paradise. Prophecy and  revelation are fully congruent with and the perfection of what all human  beings have naturally constituted within them. 113 Minhāj, 1:300–1/1:82; Man$tiq, MF 4:45; Jahd, MF 9:242–3/Man$tiqiyyīn, 382; and  ≠Abd al-Qādir, MF 10:466. 114 Nubuwwāt, 430–1. Ma!habba, 62, makes a similar affirmation. 115 I!htijāj, MF 8:312. 116 Amrā#d, MF 10:135. </page> <page sequence="27">  theological jurisprudence 45 Connections to Ibn Taymiyya’s Theodicean Writings The previous two subsections show that reason and the natural constitution  constitute two functionally equivalent sources in Ibn Taymiyya’s thought  for attaining knowledge of God’s existence and the ends to which human  beings should devote themselves. Apart from prophetic revelation, human  beings, by virtue of their very createdness, know that God exists, that the  fundamental human telos is to gain benefit and repel detriment, and that  this may be achieved most fully in worshipping and loving God. Prophecy  and revelation of God’s command restore and perfect these basic human  intuitions. Certain rational difficulties arise from Ibn Taymiyya’s ethical vision. His  view of the powers of the natural constitution to recognize and follow truth  is very optimistic, and it does not appear to take into account the problem  of inveterate unbelievers for whom prophecy and spiritual discipline do  not avail. It is insufficient to pass the blame off on satans because this only  pushes the question back one step to how even the natural constitutions of  the satans were corrupted. From whence then does evil ultimately come? A  similar problem exists with respect to reason. If humans know by reason what  will profit and harm them, why do they go astray, and if it is a matter of God  creating disbelief and disobedience in them—as Ibn Taymiyya asserts—then  how is God just to create that, much less punish it? The shaykh attends to  these problems in several places, but most fully in (Hasana, which will be  examined in Chapter Five. Beyond this, two key principles underlying the material above will reappear  in subsequent chapters. First, Ibn Taymiyya’s cosmological proof for God’s  existence is rooted in the metaphysical presupposition that every possible  and originated existent requires an external cause preponderating and deter- mining its existence. As will become apparent in Chapter Two below, the  shaykh usually upholds this principle of preponderance with an extraordinary  rigor that extends even into God’s will. Second, as already noted above, the  shaykh rejects Mu≠tazilī rational objectivism and Ash≠arī voluntarism in favor  of a teleological theory of ethical value. At first glance, this appears to apply  not only to the human plane but to God as well, especially as Ibn Taymiyya  underlines the causal character of the wise purposes in God’s creative acts  (Chapter Two). An important question then is whether the shaykh applies  the two principles of preponderance and teleology to God univocally or in  some other fashion. What follows on the character of theological discern- ment of God’s attributes begins to suggest how the shaykh might answer  this question. </page> <page sequence="28"> 46 chapter one The Methodology of Theological Jurisprudence To Ibn Taymiyya’s mind, both reason and the natural constitution on the one  hand and Law and prophecy on the other affirm that God exists and that  God should be loved and worshipped. Beyond this, the revealed tradition also  ascribes various qualities and acts to God that resemble those of creatures.  But what is reason to make of these? More pointedly, what should be the  response to God’s messengers who bring information about God—such as  God’s sitting (istiwā±) on the Throne (Q. 57:4)—that apparently conflicts  with rational proofs demonstrating God’s incomparability with creatures?  Ibn ≠Arabī in Al-Futū!hāt al-makkiyya provides a typology of responses to  this question that will help situate Ibn Taymiyya’s approach.117 The first of six groups outlined by Ibn ≠Arabī responds by doubting the  truthfulness of the messenger and turning away from the faith when informed  that God has attributes that are normally ascribed to originated things. This  is simply unbelief. The second group does not waver in its faith and retains  its rational proofs, but it takes the messenger’s report to be a wise adapta- tion to the weak who do not have access to the proofs of reason. Ibn ≠Arabī  does not link names to any of the groups, but this second group represents  the basic position of Muslim philosophers like al-Farābī, Ibn Sīnā and Ibn  Rushd.118 The third group believes that the report of God’s self-description  contradicts its proofs negating all ascriptions of creaturely attributes to God,  but it accepts the truthfulness of the report-giver nonetheless and submits  to his greater knowledge since there is no harm in this. Still, the relation  of this description to God Himself is not known since God’s essence is  not known. Here Ibn ≠Arabī may have in mind traditionalists who affirm  God’s description of Himself in revelation but refuse to interpret its mean- ing, especially in the way practiced by the next group. Yet, there is little to  distinguish this position from his own which he affirms and elaborates at  the end of the typology. 117 Ibn ≠Arabī al-(Hātimī al-+Tā±ī, Al-Futū!hāt al-Makkiyya, 4 vols.

Taylor (Cambridge, UK:  Cambridge University Press, 2005), 182–9. On Ibn Taymiyya’s rejection of the philosophers’  perspective, see Michot, “A Mamlūk Theologian’s Commentary.” </page> <page sequence="29">  theological jurisprudence 47 The fourth group, clearly the Kalām theologians, accepts the truthfulness  of the report-giver but re-interprets (ta±wīl) the apparent ( )zāhir) sense of  some reports to accord with its rational proofs, which, this group observes,  are congruent with God’s statement about Himself, “There is nothing like  Him” (Q. 42:11). The fifth group has no appreciation for rational proofs of  God’s incomparability and does not grasp the meaning of “There is nothing  like Him.” Rather, it takes the revealed descriptions of God in their apparent  sense without drawing a distinction between themselves and God. This is  the anthropomorphism and corporealism that the Islamic heresiographical  tradition often ascribes to Hadith scholars under the pejorative label (Hash- wiyya. It is also what many of Ibn Taymiyya’s opponents from his own day  onward understand him to teach.119 Ibn ≠Arabī’s sixth and last group, the one approved as attaining salvation,  “has faith in what came from God as God means it and knows it, while  negating assimilation (tashbīh) [of God to creatures] with ‘There is nothing  like Him’ (Q. 42:11).”120 Ibn ≠Arabī continues with a long list of creaturely  attributes which revelation has ascribed to God—including inter alia a  hand, hearing, sight, good pleasure, hesitation (taraddud), joy, laughter and  descent—many of which the Kalām theologians seek to reinterpret. Given Ibn Taymiyya’s notoriety for polemic against Ibn ≠Arabī, it may  seem odd to resort to a typology from the latter to enlighten the views of  the former. Yet, from the following exposition of Ibn Taymiyya’s view, it will  become apparent that the two agree on one thing. With the sixth group  above, both affirm allegedly anthropomorphic expressions about God on  a par with other divine attributes found in revelation while simultaneously  confessing that God is equally incomparable to creatures in all of His names  and attributes. Neither follows the philosophers for whom revelation is an  expedient for the masses who cannot bear pure intellectual truth. Nor does  either adopt the hermeneutical strategy of Kalām theology, which argues that  revelation must give way to reason through the practice of re-interpretation  (ta±wīl).

Ibn Taymiyya does not follow the Sufi theorist  in privileging mystical experience or revelation over reason. Rather, reason  and revelation are on the same level and provide much of the same informa- tion about God. As we will see below, reason rightly exercised knows even  many of God’s allegedly anthropomorphic attributes found in revelation. The two great figures also do not agree on the ontological referents of  God’s attributes and acts. Ibn ≠Arabī does not always distinguish God’s acts  from created things, and from a certain illumined perspective, God’s acts are  the created things themselves. God’s attributes and names then indicate the  diverse relationships between God’s many acts and God’s one unknowable  essence, but these relationships (i.e. the attributes) do not exist in reality.121  Ibn Taymiyya, unlike Ibn ≠Arabī whom he charges with conflating God and  the world, maintains that God’s attributes are real and that not only God’s  essence but also God’s attributes and acts are always ontologically distinct  from creatures: “There is nothing like (mithl) [God], neither in His essence,  nor in His attributes, nor in His acts.”122 Nevertheless, Ibn Taymiyya acknowledges that the unseen world, which  includes both God and the hereafter, can be discussed only through the  medium of what is known in the visible world: “Things that are concealed  from sight and feeling are only known, loved and hated via a kind of likening  (tamthīl) and analogy (qiyās).”123 The question then is how to speak correctly  of the God who is wholly other. Ibn Taymiyya answers this question from  the tradition and with rational arguments concerning what human concep- tion of God’s perfection should entail. Affirming God’s Attributes in the Revealed Tradition without Modality Contributing perhaps to his anti-rationalist reputation, Ibn Taymiyya often  calls for acceptance of God’s attributes found in the authoritative textual  sources of Islam without making a parallel appeal to reason, asserting that  God must be spoken of strictly as He has revealed Himself to be and as the  121 For explanation of Ibn ≠Arabī’s theology, see Chittick, The Sufi Path of Knowledge,  8–12 and 33–46. 122 I$sfahāniyya, 9; Tadmuriyya, MF 3:25; Wa$siyya kubrā, MF 3:374; MF 5:195; Nuzūl,  5:330; Jawāb, 2:164, 4:428; and Minhāj, 3:151/2:27.

This approach rests on the quranic verse, “There  is nothing like Him, and He is all-Hearing, all-Seeing” (Q. 42:11), which  the shaykh understands to entail both a negation of God’s likeness to any  creature and an affirmation that God has attributes called hearing and see- ing. By extension, all other attributes that appear in the authoritative texts  must be affirmed as they are, but always with the qualification that they are  wholly unlike those of creatures. A typical statement of this position occurs  in Ibn Taymiyya’s Tadmuriyya creed: God is qualified by that with which He has qualified Himself and by that with  which His messengers have qualified Him, negatively and positively. What  God establishes for Himself is established and what He negates for Himself is  negated. It is known that the way of the Salaf of the Community and its Imāms  is establishment of the attributes ($sifāt) that He establishes without [giving  them] modality (takyīf ) or likening [them to something else] (tamthīl) and  without distorting [them] (ta!hrīf ) or stripping [them] away (ta≠$tīl). Likewise,  they negate of Him what He negates of Himself. . . .  Their way involves establishing His names and attributes, as well as nega- tion of His likeness with creatures—establishing without assimilating [Him  to creatures] (tashbīh), declaring [Him] incomparable (tanzīh) without strip- ping away [His attributes]. As He—Exalted is He—said, “There is nothing  like Him, and He is all-Hearing, all-Seeing” (Q. 42:11). In His statement,  “There is nothing like Him,” is a rejection of assimilation and likening, and  His statement, “He is all-Hearing, all-Seeing,” is a rejection of heresy (il!hād)  and stripping away.124 Adhering to these guidelines, God must be mentioned only in the theologi- cal language of the Qur±an and the Sunna. The admonitions against takyīf,  tamthīl, tashbīh, tah! rīf and ta≠t$ īl protect this language from interpretation that  ties God to creatures in some fashion. Ibn Taymiyya supports his rejection  of assimilation (tashbīh) and likening (tamthīl) with several quranic verses  indicating that God has no son, associate or equal (Q. 2:22, 2:165, 16:74,  19:65, 25:2, 112:3–4, etc.). He also provides numerous verses establishing  that God has various names and attributes and that God is the Creator of  created things. For example, God is Self-Subsistent (al-Qayyūm) and Living  (Q. 2:255), all-Knowing and all-Wise (Q. 4:26). He created the heavens and  the earth and then sat upon the Throne (Q. 57:4). He loves (Q. 5:54) and  124 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:3–4.

He spoke to Moses (Q. 4:164). He is Creator, and to  Him belong the most Beautiful Names (Q. 59:24).125 Ibn Taymiyya further explains that attempts by philosophers and Kalām  theologians to understand the detail of the revealed language about God  begin from alien conceptual frameworks and lead to error. Those who make  God analogous to creatures or liken God to them violate His incompara- bility and end up worshipping an idol. A philosophical via negativa strips  away God’s positive attributes (ta≠$tīl) and leads to worship of a nonexistent.  Moreover, those who negate God’s attributes only do so because they have  first likened these attributes to those of creatures and found them unfit for  God. In this way, even the strippers are likeners. In sum, the language about  God presented in the revealed sources must be accepted as it is without it  implying any likeness of God to creatures whatsoever.126 The shaykh’s agnosticism as to the modality of God’s attributes becomes  especially apparent when he argues that they remain unique to God even if  He has identified Himself with names and attributes that are also employed  with respect to creatures. The shaykh elaborates this with a philosophical  nominalism that denies the existence of extramental universals. Wael Hallaq  comments that Ibn Taymiyya holds individuals in the extramental world to  be “so distinct and different from one another that they cannot allow for  the formation of an external universal under which they are assumed.”127  The shaykh explains that God calls Himself Living, Knowing, Merciful,  125 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:4–7; and Jawāb, 4:405–8. A full list of quranic verses that negate  God’s likeness to creatures and affirm His many names and attributes is found in Wāsi$tiyya,  MF 3:130–143. 126 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:7ff.; Jawāb, 4:405–6; and (Hamawiyya, MF 5:27, 59.

Hallaq’s reference for this point  leads to Dar ±, 1:116, where Ibn Taymiyya argues for the complete unlikeness of all individual  entities, including all human beings, from each other. The shaykh quotes the verse, “If you turn  away, He will exchange you for some other people, and they will not be your likes (amthāl)”  (Q. 47:38). From this, he denies that humans bear a likeness (mumāthala) one to another  even though they may share in having bodies, moving, laughing and so forth. By denying all  likeness even between creatures, Ibn Taymiyya applies the same agnosticism that he holds  with respect to the modality of God’s attributes to the modality of human attributes. </page> <page sequence="33">  theological jurisprudence 51 Hearing, Seeing and so on and that in the Qur±an He has used these names  for creatures as well. However, God and creatures share nothing in common  but these names. Ibn Taymiyya does observe that the mind recognizes shared qualities and  connotations when these names are abstracted from their particular and  concrete manifestations. This is as when we recognize that both snow and  ivory share something in common with each other that we call whiteness  even though the whiteness of snow is much more intense than the white- ness of ivory. Yet, despite observed similarities, the shaykh asserts that the  abstract universal of whiteness or any other name has no existence outside  the mind. Applying this nominalism in the realm of theological language,  there is no longer any similarity between the referents of identical names  when they are particularized in the Creator and the creature apart from the  very names themselves. The shaykh suggests that this is obvious, for example,  in the attribute of knowledge. The knowledge of creatures is accidental,  originated, and acquired whereas that of the Creator is none of these. The  modalities of the concrete realities to which the names of the unseen God  refer are unknowable because they are completely unlike referents given the  same names in the created world.128 This rigorously agnostic and nominalistic approach permits affirming all  the revealed names and attributes of God without fear of anthropomorphism  because all of them are equally unlike their counterparts in the created world.  A sample of Ibn Taymiyya’s dialectic against the Kalām theologians from  Tadmuriyya illustrates how this works. He takes particular issue with the  Kalām theologians interpreting God’s love, good pleasure, anger and hate as  metaphors for either God’s will or God’s blessing and punishment of human  beings. He explains, for example, that if the Kalām theologians understand  God’s will to be like that of creatures, then there should be no offense in  making God like creatures in other attributes as well, such as in love and  anger. Conversely, they might take God to have a will uniquely befitting  Him just as creatures have wills uniquely befitting them and different from  God’s. In this case, however, there should be no reason not to affirm love  128 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:10–16; Jawāb, 4:421–8; Minhāj, 2:112–120/1:174–7; Jahd, MF  9:145/Man$tiqiyyīn, 154–5; and Munā)zara, 3:191. My discussion avoids the highly technical  vocabulary Ibn Taymiyya uses because the main point is otherwise clear: the link between  God’s attributes and those of creatures is confined to the level of abstract universals in the mind.  For discussion of the technical terms involved—tawā$tu±, tashkīk and ishtirāk—see Jackson,  “Ibn Taymiyyah on Trial,” 54–5; Hallaq, Ibn Taymiyya against the Greek Logicians, 74–5;  and especially Mohamed M. Yunis Ali, Medieval Islamic Pragmatics: Sunni Theorists’ Models  of Textual Communication (Richmond, Surrey, UK: Curzon Press, 2000), 114–125. </page> <page sequence="34"> 52 chapter one and anger of God in a sense uniquely befitting Him as well. Moreover, if the  Kalām theologians take anger to be “the boiling of the blood of the heart  from seeking vengeance” and then say that this cannot be applied to God,  it can be countered that will means “the inclination of the soul to obtain  profit or repel harm” which also cannot be applied to God. Anger and will  in the anthropomorphic senses of these definitions are equally inapplicable  to God because neither God’s anger nor God’s will bears any relationship  to the human senses of anger or will. Rather, Ibn Taymiyya argues, God has  an anger and a will that uniquely befit Him.129 The shaykh also notes that the Kalām theologians establish some of God’s  attributes by rational proofs and imply that those attributes not proven  rationally must be reinterpreted. For example, the theologians argue that a  temporally originated act proves that God has power, will and knowledge.  These attributes necessarily imply life, and that which is living must be hear- ing, seeing and speaking. Then, other attributes like love and anger, which  are not proven rationally, may not be predicated of God except as metaphors  for the rationally proven attributes. Ibn Taymiyya retorts that absence of  proof does not necessarily imply that something does not exist. Furthermore,  rational proofs of a similar kind could be marshaled in support of God’s other  attributes. For example, God’s beneficence to humans proves His mercy; His  punishment of unbelievers points to His hate; and so on.130 Ibn Taymiyya’s hermeneutic presupposition throughout these arguments  is an absolute application of “There is nothing like Him” (Q. 42:11), which  he complements with a rigorous nominalism that denies the existence of  extramental universals. On the basis of God’s complete unlikeness, the shaykh  portrays the Kalām theologians as inconsistent in their attempt to set apart  some of God’s attributes as metaphorical and in need of reinterpretation  (ta±wīl) while taking other attributes in senses common to creatures. Ibn  Taymiyya understands God’s names and attributes neither literally nor meta- phorically. What is literal or absolute is that the names and attributes refer to  realities wholly beyond human comprehension. While God’s attributes may  connote certain things in the human mind, these thoughts do not correspond  to anything in the modality of the attributes of God Himself. 129 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:17–8. Bell, Love Theory, 64–5, recounts similar arguments from  Iklīl, MF 13:298–300. 130 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:18–9. </page> <page sequence="35">  theological jurisprudence 53 Giving Meaning to the Revealed Attributes in Human Language Absolute unlikeness between God and creatures may present difficulties  for the religious life insofar as the language about God does not connect  to anything concrete in human experience.131 Sherman Jackson argues that  Ibn Taymiyya’s view of God’s names and attributes does, however, represent  an advance over the earlier (Hanbalī Ibn Qudāma. Ibn Qudāma sets out his  position as follows: We have no need to know the meaning of what God—Exalted is He—intended  by His attributes—He is Great and Almighty. No deed is intended by them.  No obligation is linked to them except belief in them. Belief in them is possible  without knowing their meaning. Indeed, belief with ignorance is correct.132 Whereas Ibn Qudāma rejects any attempt to link God’s attributes to the  referential world of ordinary human language, Ibn Taymiyya acknowledges  that God’s attributes do connote certain qualities in the mind although not  in the external world. In the following quote, Jackson suggests that these  mental associations give more tangibility to religious language than does  the full agnosticism of Ibn Qudāma. On this approach, a !hadīth such as the one asserting God’s descent to the  lower heavens to offer forgiveness to repentent [sic] sinners is transformed  from an abstract mystery into a concrete promise of immanent grace. For,  what is understood by ‘descent’ is now informed by its meaning in the case of  created entities, without this entailing, meanwhile, the belief that God actually  descends like anything created.133 While the associations that God’s attributes and acts evoke in the mind may  bring blessing and comfort of a kind, it seems doubtful that what Jackson  calls a “concrete promise of immanent grace” is in fact concrete because it  does not correspond to anything humans experience in concrete reality.  Nonetheless, Ibn Taymiyya does differ from Ibn Qudāma in taking these  connotations very seriously and giving considerable attention to the meanings  of the words that are used for God’s attributes. He delineates these meanings  131 For a sociological analysis of this outlook not only in Ibn Taymiyya but among the  (Hanbalīs in general, see Aziz Al-Azmeh, “Orthodoxy and (Hanbalite Fideism,” Arabica 35  (1988): 253–266, who observes that doctrinal language in this view is equivalent to a technical  language that is “not native to the human understanding” (257). He argues further that this  position was sustained through the rigorous transmission of texts claiming to preserve the  original revelation and through the structures of H( anbalī authority that included charismatic  preaching and miraculous signs. 132 Ibn Qudāma, Ta!hrīm al-na)zar, 51–2. 133 Jackson, “Ibn Taymiyyah on Trial,” 56. </page> <page sequence="36"> 54 chapter one by reference to the authoritative tradition of the Qur±an, the Hadith, the  Salaf, the early Qur±an exegetes and the conventions of the Arabic language,  as well as by rational considerations. Ibn Taymiyya’s discussion of God’s attribute of sitting on the Throne (cf.  Q. 20:5, 25:59), especially as it appears in his (Hamawiyya creed, provides  an example of how this works. Basic to the argument are the distinctions  Ibn Taymiyya draws between three types of ta±wīl.134 First is the ta±wīl of the  Kalām theologians and others who turn away from the probable meaning  and adopt the less probable meaning on account of some proof for this. In  the case of God’s sitting, the shaykh in (Hamawiyya castigates the Mu≠tazilīs  for reinterpreting God’s sitting (istawā) as possessing (istawlā) in order to  reconcile it with the quranic affirmation, “[God] is with you wherever you  are” (Q. 57:4).135 The shaykh also criticizes Kalām theologians for applying  the verse, “No one knows its ta±wīl except God” (Q. 3:7), to God’s descend- ing, sitting and so forth. He says that this makes the prophets and the Salaf  out not to have known what they were talking about when they mentioned  these attributes. The second meaning of ta±wīl is the linguistic inquiry or tafsīr  (interpretation or explanation) of early Qur±an exegetes such as Ibn ≠Abbās  (d. 68/687), Mujāhid (d. ca. 100–4/718–722) and al-+Tabarī (d. 310/923).  This is the ta±wīl of the Salaf and “those firmly grounded in knowledge”  (Q. 3:7). The third meaning of ta±wīl is the very reality of the thing referred  to, as for example the existence of the various realities in Paradise. This is the  ta±wīl that only God knows (Q. 3:7). Ibn Taymiyya puts God’s attributes in  this third category since only God knows their reality. In H( amawiyya, the shaykh also cites the well-known statement of Mālik b.  Anas on God’s sitting: “The sitting is known, and the modality is unknown,”  and then interprets this as referring to his latter two types of ta±wīl: The sitting is known (ma≠lūm). Its meaning (ma≠nā) is known; it is interpreted  ( yufassar), and it is translated into another language. This is part of the ta±wīl  that those firmly grounded in knowledge know. As for the modality (kayfiyya)  of this sitting, this is the ta±wīl that only God—Exalted is He—knows.136 134 The following discussion is based on Tadmuriyya, MF 3:55–8; H( amawiyya, MF 5:35–7;  Iklīl, MF 13:288ff.; Abū al-Fidā±, 161; and Dar ±, 1:12–6 (also found in trans. in Michot, Ibn  Taymiyya: Lettre à Abû l-Fidâ±, 25–7). See also Ali, Medieval Islamic Pragmatics, 125–135;  and al-Julaynad, Al-Imām Ibn Taymiyya, 149–185, for further treatment of Ibn Taymiyya’s  approach to ta±wīl. 135 Hamawiyya, MF 5:20, 96–7. 136 (Hamawiyya, MF 5:36–7.

In  (Hamawiyya, Ibn Taymiyya’s insistence that God’s sitting means sitting, and  not possessing as the Mu≠tazilīs would have it, leads him to reflect on the  apparent contradiction between God’s sitting on the Throne and His omni- presence found in “He is with you wherever you are” (Q. 57:4). The shaykh  affirms that, just as God is with His creatures in reality (h! aqīqatan), He is on  His Throne in reality, and, in an analysis based on the authority of Arabic  semantic conventions, he explains that God’s ‘withness’ (ma≠iyya) consists in  watching over His creatures and knowing them. He suggests that this might  be as when someone says that the moon or stars are with him when travel- ing. Similarly, a father sitting on a roof may say to a son crying below, “Do  not be afraid! I am with you.” The father-son and moon-star images that  Ibn Taymiyya provides are simply suggestions as to what Q. 57:4 may mean  linguistically. However, interpretive maneuvers such as these were not well  understood by Ibn Taymiyya’s contemporaries and earned him the charge of  anthropomorphism that led to his Damascene trials in 705/1306.137 In (Hamawiyya, Ibn Taymiyya also attempts to reconcile God’s sitting on  the Throne with the hadith, “If one of you stands to pray, God is in front of  his face. So, let him not spit in front of his face.”138 Ibn Taymiyya explains  that this is as when someone talks to the sky, sun or moon: they are over him  and also, simultaneously, in front of his face. In this case, the shaykh finds  precedent for his interpretive images in another hadith. He writes, The Prophet—God bless him and give him peace—propounded the similitude  in this. “To God is the highest similitude (al-mathal al-a≠lā)” (Q. 16:60).  However, what is meant by drawing a similitude (tamthīl) is explanation of  the permissibility ( jawāz) of this and its possibility (imkān), not assimilation  (tashbīh) of the Creator to the creature. The Prophet—God bless him and give  him peace—said, “There is not among you one but that he will see his Lord  alone.” Abū Razīn al-≠Uqaylī said to him, “How is this, O Messenger of God,  when He is only one and we are all together?” The Prophet—God bless him  and give him peace—said, “I will inform you of the like (mithl) of this in the  favors of God. This moon, each of you sees it alone, and this is a sign among  the signs of God. God is greater,” or as the Prophet—God bless him and give  Taymiyya: X. «Je ne suis dans cette affaire qu’un musulman parmi d’autres . . .»,” Le Musul- man (Paris) 23 (1994): 27–32 (at 28 n. 9). 137 H( amawiyya, MF 5:103–4; and Munāz) ara, 3:177–8 (trans. in Jackson, “Ibn Taymiyyah  on Trial,” 71–2). 138 Abū Dāwūd, 410, Al-S! alāt, Fī karāhiyyat al-buzāq fī al-masjid.

When the believers see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection and talk to Him,  each one will see Him over him in front of his face just as he sees the sun and  the moon. There is no incompatibility fundamentally.141 On guard against anthropomorphism, Ibn Taymiyya prefaces his remarks  in this quotation by noting that the hadith supplies a similitude that does  not assimilate God to creatures. It only indicates what is permissible and  possible with respect to God but not what exists necessarily in reality. The  shaykh provides similar similitudes or interpretative images in his theodicean  writings, especially in Minhāj, and these will be noted in Chapter Three. In  methodological discussions examined next, Ibn Taymiyya links the verse,  “To God is the highest similitude” (Q. 16:60), to a rational criterion for  delineating the meanings of God’s attributes and for deriving many of the  attributes themselves. Giving God the Highest Similitude with the a fortiori Argument Up to this point, we have seen Ibn Taymiyya defend and explain an agnos- tic realism with respect to God’s attributes on the authority of traditional  sources. The attributes are real and meaningful, but their modality cannot  be known, and this we know from tradition. However, he also believes that  much of the same information concerning God’s attributes is known by  reason independently of revelation. The shaykh’s rational proofs for God’s  complete unlikeness will be given toward the end of the following subsection;  here it is sufficient to note that they are founded on his rigorous denial of  extramental universals. The present subsection surveys his explanation and  justification of the a fortiori argument as a rational tool for deriving and  interpreting God’s attributes of perfection. The following subsection then  examines the shaykh’s proofs for God’s perfection from both revelation and  reason, and it details several divine perfections. 139 Ibn Taymiyya’s reporting of this hadith indeed appears to be very loose since I could  not locate anything that closely resembles it. However, similar affirmations of the vision of  God are found in Bukhārī, 521, Mawāqīt al- $salāt, Fa #dl $salāt al-≠a $sr; in Ibn Māja, 176, Al- Muqaddima, Fīmā ankarat al-Jahmiyya; and elsewhere. 140 The closest to what Ibn Taymiyya reports—but without mention of the sun—are al- Tirmidhī, 2477, !Sifāt al-janna ≠an rasūl Allāh, Minhu; and A!hmad, 18394. 141 (Hamawiyya, MF 5:107. </page> <page sequence="39">  theological jurisprudence 57 When discussing the methodology of theological argument, Ibn Taymiyya  condemns the use of both analogy and categorical syllogism, and he explains  that discussion of God’s attributes and acts must occur in a fortiori mode.  The shaykh is not adverse to analogy in legal matters. He traces the usage  of legal analogy back to the Salaf and criticizes the %Zāhirīs for rejecting it.142  The juristic analogy is invalid, however, if it contradicts what God has clearly  legislated: “Wherever we know that the explicit text opposes an analogy,  we know absolutely that it is an invalid analogy.”143 In matters of theologi- cal doctrine, Ibn Taymiyya argues that the juristic analogy is always invalid  because it brings God and creatures into a relationship of direct comparison.  Even if God and an idol both happen to be objects of worship, and even  if God and creatures share the fact of existence, these coincidences do not  imply that God may be equated with created things in any other respect.  Rather, God may not be made analogous to any created thing because of  His incomparability. Drawing an analogy from a creature to God sets the  two on the same level and is tantamount to idolatry.144 Turning now to the categorical syllogism, Ibn Taymiyya is well known for  his polemic against Aristotelian logic, especially as it is found in his major  work Kitāb al-radd ≠alā al-man $tiqiyyīn [Man $tiqiyyīn]. Wael Hallaq has  provided a translation of Jahd, an abridged version of Man$tiqiyyīn, and, in  his introduction, Hallaq shows that the shaykh’s critique of the Aristotelian  theory of definition and the categorical syllogism is extensive and incisive.145  For our purposes, however, it is important to note only two points. First,  Ibn Taymiyya accepts the formal validity of the categorical syllogism (qiyās  al-shumūl). However, he rejects the power of this syllogism to give certain  knowledge, and he denies that the premises that philosophers, Kalām theo- logians and theosophical Sufis introduce into it are real universals. Universals  for Ibn Taymiyya exist only in the mind. Thus, he believes, the elaborate  metaphysical structures built up by Ibn Sīnā, Ibn ≠Arabī, Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī  and many others exist only in the mind and not in external reality.146 Second,  142 I$sfahāniyya, 79. 143 Qiyās, MF 20:505. 144 Qiyās, MF 20:541–2. 145 Hallaq, Ibn Taymiyya against the Greek Logicians.

The abridgement was carried out by Jalāl al-Dīn al-Suyū $tī  (d. 911/1505). 146 Hallaq, Ibn Taymiyya against the Greek Logicians, xiv–xxxii. Hallaq notes that qiyās  al-shumūl is a rare expression for the categorical syllogism and may have been coined by  Ibn Taymiyya himself (xiv, n. 17). He also explains that logic is simply superfluous for Ibn  Taymiyya. Whatever knowledge it might provide can be obtained through simpler means  including the natural constitution (xl; cf. Jahd, MF 9:187/Man $tiqiyyīn, 199–200; Jahd,  </page> <page sequence="40"> 58 chapter one in Jahd and elsewhere, the shaykh does not permit the use of the syllogism  with respect to God because, as with the juristic analogy, it places God and  creatures as different syllogistic terms on the same level.147 Although Ibn Taymiyya does not permit the univocal use of analogy and  the categorical syllogism with respect to God, he does permit their use in a  fortiori mode. Like analogy, the a fortiori argument plays an important role  in Islamic jurisprudence. A common example of this argument concludes  from the quranic injunction, “Do not say to [parents] ‘Fie!’” (Q. 17:23), that  hitting parents is a fortiori (i.e. all the more) prohibited because the disrespect  shown to parents in hitting is all the worthier of being prohibited than the  disrespect shown in saying “Fie!”148 When applied to God, this argument,  in Ibn Taymiyya’s view, maintains the necessary unlikeness between God  and creatures and, moreover, asserts that God is all the worthier (awlā) of  whatever judgment of perfection is applied to creatures than are the creatures  themselves. He explains this as follows: Sometimes, the common degree (qadr mushtarak) in a rational argument is con- sidered without consideration of priority (awwaliyya), and sometimes priority  is considered in it. The a fortiori argument (qiyās al-awlā) is composed in this  [latter] way. This [obtains] if it has been made a kind of categorical syllogism  or analogy having a particular [characteristic] by which it is distinguished  from all [other] kinds, which is that the desired judgment be worthier of being  established than is the case mentioned in the proof proving it. This type is what the Salaf and the Imāms—like Imām A !hmad and others  among the Salaf—followed with respect to rational proof in the matter of  217–8/Man$tiqiyyīn, 293–8). In this regard, according to Hallaq, Ibn Taymiyya argues that  the categorical syllogism differs only in form from the juristic analogy. The two are in fact  interchangeable because the middle term of the syllogism is equivalent to the cause and shared  attribute of the analogy. For example date wine (nabīdh) has been prohibited by analogy to  grape wine (khamr) whose assessment or rule (!hukm) of prohibition has been set down in  the authoritative sources of the Qur±an and the Sunna. Through a process of induction,  the jurists determine that the cause (≠illa) of this rule is intoxication even though it is not  given in the texts. Now, since intoxication is a common attribute (wa$sf mushtarak) between  grape wine and date wine, the rule of prohibition also applies to date wine. The prohibition  of date wine may also be set out syllogistically as follows. All intoxicants are prohibited  (major premise). Date wine is intoxicating (minor premise). Therefore, date wine is prohibited  (conclusion). In this case, the middle term ‘intoxicants’ is equivalent to the cause and com- mon attribute in the analogy. The rule of prohibition that attaches to intoxicants establishes  both the major premise of the syllogism and the analogical transfer of the ruling from grape  wine to all other intoxicants (xxxv–xxxix; cf. Nubuwwāt, 270–3; Kaylāniyya, MF 12:345–7;  I$sfahāniyya, 48; and Jahd, MF 9:197–206/Man$tiqiyyīn, 209–246). 147 Jahd, MF 9:141–2/Man$tiqiyyīn, 150; Tadmuriyya, MF 3:30; Kaylāniyya, MF 12:347;  and I$sfahāniyya, 49. 148 Wael B.

This is because it is not  admissible that God—Exalted is He—and another be included in a categori- cal syllogism whose terms are on the same level or in an analogy in which the  judgment of the original case and that of the assimilated case are on the same  level. Indeed, God—Exalted is He—there is nothing like Him neither in His  essence (nafs) which is mentioned through His names, nor in His attributes,  nor in His acts. However, the a fortiori argument is followed with respect to  Him. As He said, “And to God is the highest similitude (al-mathal al-a≠lā)”  (Q. 16:60). [Concerning] every perfection and attribute praiseworthy in itself and  devoid of imperfection that belongs to some created, originated existents, it is  known that the Lord, Creator, Self-Subsistent (S! amad), Everlasting (Qayyūm),  Eternal and Necessary Existent in Himself is all the worthier of it. And [con- cerning] every imperfection and defect from which some originated, possible  creatures must be exonerated, the Lord, Creator, Holy, Peace, Eternal, Necessary  of Existence in Himself is all the worthier of being exonerated from it.149 Analogies and categorical syllogisms may not be employed univocally for  God. Rather, the a fortiori argument which maintains God’s unlikeness should  be used, and, following the quranic verse, “For God is the highest similitude”  (Q. 16:60), God should be given the highest similitude or likeness (mathal).  This entails attributing all creaturely perfections to God and freeing Him  from every creaturely imperfection because He is a fortiori worthy of being so  qualified. Ibn Taymiyya asserts furthermore that the a fortiori argument has a  venerable tradition in the Qur±an and among the Salaf and other important  leaders of the Islamic community such as Ibn (Hanbal. I have not found the shaykh showing how the Salaf and Ibn (Hanbal use  the a fortiori argument.150 In Dar ± however he does furnish some examples  149 I $sfahāniyya, 49. For the same arguments, see also Dar ±, 1:29–30, Tadmuriyya, MF  3:30; and Kaylāniyya, MF 12:347. 150 Ibn H( anbal uses the highest similitude argument in a passage in Al-Radd ≠alā zanādiqa  wa al-Jahmiyya, ed. Muh! ammad H( asan Rāshid (Cairo: al-Mat$ ba≠a al-salafiyya, 1393/1973–4),  37, which Ibn Taymiyya quotes in Minhāj, 2:484–5/1:234, for other purposes. In response  to the Jahmī charge that the traditionalists deny God’s unity by affirming His attributes, Ibn  (Hanbal compares God to a palm tree. The palm tree has a stump, leaves and so forth, but yet  it is considered one in name. “So, likewise, God—for Him is the highest similitude—with all  His attributes is one God.” Immediately following this, Ibn (Hanbal gives a second example,  this time from the Qur±an: “Leave Me [to deal] with him whom I have created one (wa!hīd)”  (Q. 74:11). Ibn (Hanbal takes the one created to be al-Walīd b. al-Mughīra al-Makhzūmī  who despite being called “one” still had ears, eyes and other body members. From this Ibn  (Hanbal concludes, “So, likewise, God—for Him is the highest similitude—He, with all His  attributes, is one God.” I have not here followed the unclear translation of Ibn H( anbal’s Radd  found in Morris S. Seale, Muslim Theology: A Study of Origins with Reference to the Church  Fathers (London: Luzac, 1964), 96–125 (specifically 116–7). Wesley Williams, “Aspects of  the Creed of Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: A Study of Anthropomorphism in Early Islamic  </page> <page sequence="42"> 60 chapter one of the a fortiori argument in the Qur±an. He gives two sets of arguments,  first providing proofs for the resurrection at the Last Day and second giving  proofs for God’s exoneration from having associates.151 Concerning the resurrection, Ibn Taymiyya begins by explaining that we  know the possibility of something existing in the extramental world either  by its actual existence, by the existence of something equivalent to it, or by  the existence of something greater. In the latter case, “The existence of some- thing is a proof that something below it is a fortiori possible.”152 Moreover,  the existence of any possibility is contingent upon the Lord having power to  make it occur. Ibn Taymiyya then cites quranic verses pointing to the original  creation of the heavens and the earth, as well as of humans, to demonstrate  a fortiori God’s power to raise humankind again. These include, “It is He  who begins the creation, and then brings it back again, and this is easier for  Him. To Him is the highest similitude in the heavens and the earth” (Q.  30:27), and, “Do they not see that God Who created the heavens and the  earth is powerful to create the like of them” (Q. 17:99). However, the shaykh  devotes the most attention to several verses in Sūrat Yā Sīn: He set forth a similitude and forgot His creation. He said, “Who will give life  to these bones when they are decayed?” Say, “He will give life to them Who  brought them forth the first time! He is All-Knowing about every creation. He  who makes fire for you out of the green tree. Behold, from it you kindle.” Is not  He Who created the heavens and the earth powerful to create the like of them?  Yes, indeed! He is the Supreme Creator, the All-Knowing (Q. 36:78–81). The shaykh points out that the question, “Who will give life to these bones  when they are decayed?” is rhetorical, inviting the response that no one can  give life to decayed bones. However, the Qur±an then underlines that this  is indeed possible for God by pointing to His original creation of life from  dust: “He will give life to them Who brought them forth the first time.”  Then with the statement, “He who makes fire for you out of the green  tree,” the Qur±an shows that God produces hot dry fire from what is cold  and moist, something even more difficult than bringing life out of decayed  Discourse,” International Journal of Middle East Studies 34 (2002): 441–463, confirms that  Ibn (Hanbal engages in more interpretation and rational theological argument than is com- monly acknowledged. Williams also shows that Ibn (Hanbal is fully an anthropomorphist  (mushabbih) who makes no effort to deny that the modality (kayf ) of God’s attributes can  be known. In this respect, Ibn Taymiyya does not follow Ibn (Hanbal. 151 Dar ±, 1:31–7. I$sfahāniyya, 86, includes a much briefer demonstration of the a fortiori  argument in the Qur±an, citing only Q. 16:58–62 and 30:28, which will figure also in the  following discussion. 152 Dar ±, 1:32. </page> <page sequence="43">  theological jurisprudence 61 bones. Thus, the formation of living beings from decayed bones is a fortiori  possible, and the God who can create fire from a green tree is a fortiori able  to create life from dust.153 The second set of a fortiori arguments Ibn Taymiyya cites from the Qur±an  in Dar ± show God’s freedom from associates. These arguments are of two  kinds. In the first, the belief of pre-Islamic idolaters that God had daughters  while they themselves disliked having daughters is shown to be absurd. If  having daughters is judged to be an imperfection in the human sphere, God is  all the worthier of being exonerated from this imperfection. Following is one  of the quranic passages that the shaykh uses to illustrate this argument: And they assign daughters to God—Glory be to Him—and to themselves what  they desire. When one of them is given the news of a girl, his face becomes dark,  and he chokes inwardly. He hides himself from the people because of the evil  of the news that has been given him. Shall he keep her with dishonor or bury  her in the earth? Certainly, evil is their decision. For those who do not believe  in the hereafter is a similitude of evil, and for God is the highest similitude.  And He is All-Mighty, All Wise . . . They assign to God what they hate, and  their tongues assert the lie that better things will be theirs. Without doubt,  theirs will be the Fire, and they will be hastened into [it] (Q. 16:57–62). Ibn Taymiyya concludes from this passage and two others (Q. 43:16–9 and  53:19–23) that God has made it obvious that He is far worthier of being  exonerated of imperfections than humans. It is not permissible for humans  to attribute to God what they hate to attribute to themselves.154 This is  apparently so even when the value system sustaining the argument—dis- like of daughters and female infanticide—is denounced in the process of  argumentation. The same point lies behind a second kind of quranic argument showing  God’s a fortiori freedom from associates. Ibn Taymiyya cites the verse, “He  set forth a similitude for you from yourselves. Do you have, among what  your right hands own, associates in what we have provided for you so that  you are equal with regard to it, you fearing them as you fear each other?”  (Q. 30:28). According to the shaykh, God is here explaining that humans  do not permit what they own, that is, their slaves, to be associates with them  in their property such that they would fear their slaves as they fear their  peers. Then, God is asking humans how they could make His slaves and  His creatures associates with Him. The implication is that God is a fortiori  153 Dar ±, 1:31–5. 154 Dar ±, 1:35–7. </page> <page sequence="44"> 62 chapter one worthy of being exonerated of associates that humans do not permit even  for themselves.155 With the above examples, Ibn Taymiyya shows that the type of theologi- cal argumentation found in the Qur±an is a fortiori and that this establishes  the permissibility of arguing in this mode in theological matters. In the  shaykh’s view, the a fortiori argument preserves the unlikeness between God  and creatures which univocal use of analogy and syllogism fails to respect.  Moreover, the last two arguments cited above—God’s a fortiori right not  to have daughters and associates—illustrate the principle that God must be  given the highest similitude. That is, the Qur±an stipulates that God has an  a fortiori right to be ascribed with perfections found in creatures and exoner- ated of all creaturely imperfections. This style of reasoning guarantees that  God is spoken well of and in praiseworthy fashion without making Him  like creatures. Affirming God’s Attributes of Perfection and Praiseworthiness Ibn Taymiyya maintains that God’s perfection (kamāl) is known by reason  and the natural constitution on the one hand and revealed tradition on the  other.156 He combines arguments from both streams in his lengthy fatwa  Akmaliyya, which also provides a fairly complete overview of God’s attributes  of perfection. Much, but not all, of what follows here comes from this fatwa.  Although the philosophical term ‘perfection’ is not used with reference to  God’s attributes in the Qur±an, Ibn Taymiyya claims that the Qur±an indi- cates its meaning in mentioning God’s praiseworthiness, in giving God “the  highest similitude” (Q. 16:60), and in establishing God’s names. The shaykh  also reports that the Qur±an exegete Ibn ≠Abbās interpreted the divine name  Self-Subsistent (al-!Samad) found in Surat al-Ikhlā $s (Q. 112) to mean that  God has the right to perfection.157 Some of the shaykh’s quranic support for God’s perfection has already  been cited above as examples of the a fortiori argument (Q. 16:57–62 and Q.  30:28). A few more examples follow here. The verse, “Is then He who creates  as one who does not create? Do you not remember?” (Q. 16:17), shows that  creating is an attribute of perfection and that the Creator is better than the  creature. Another verse illustrates that being an impotent slave is an attribute  155 Dar ±, 1:37. 156 Akmaliyya, MF 6:71–3; and Jawāb, 3:220. 157 Akmaliyya, MF 6:71–3. Cf. Nuzūl, 5:229. On the name al-!Samad see also Ikhlā$s, MF  17:214–221; and Irāda, MF 8:149–150. </page> <page sequence="45">  theological jurisprudence 63 of imperfection while power, sovereignty and beneficence are attributes of  perfection: “God propounded a similitude: a servant owned by another who  has no power to do anything and one to whom We have provided a good  provision from Us and who spends from it secretly and openly. Are they  equal? Praise belongs to God, but most of them know not” (Q. 16:75). Ibn  Taymiyya also cites Abraham’s question to his father, “O my father! Why  do you worship that which does not hear, does not see and cannot avail you  anything?” (Q. 19:42), to show that hearing, seeing and availing are attributes  of perfection and to illustrate that the Qur±an often describes idols as devoid  of perfections such as speech, life, action and so forth.158 In addition to the Qur±an, Ibn Taymiyya bases the attributes of perfec- tion in reason and the natural constitution. He says that it is known by the  natural constitution necessarily that God is more perfect than anything else  just as it is known that He is the Creator.159 Similarly, the shaykh argues  that God’s right to perfections that are completely devoid of imperfection,  as well as His right to freedom from all imperfection, is known by reason  necessarily and “in the bases of intellects ( fī bidāyat al-≠uqūl).” He grounds  this in two separate but related principles. First is causal priority. A cause is  known necessarily to be more perfect than the effect; the Creator is more  perfect than the creature; the Eternal is more perfect than the temporal;  and the Necessary Existent is more perfect than the possible that is suscep- tible to nonexistence. Second, God is the source of all perfections found in  creatures. God is the Creator of every existent belonging to the creature,  and creatures derive (istafāda) all of their perfections from their Lord and  Creator. An imperfect creature cannot create a perfect existent, and so all  perfection must ultimately depend upon God. On both grounds, God is a  fortiori worthy of all perfections found in creatures. The Creator is all the  worthier of any perfection found in the creature because He is more perfect  than the creature and because He is the very source of the creature’s perfec- tion. As Ibn Taymiyya sees it, creatures are worthier of the imperfections of  nonexistence, possibility and origination.160 Ibn Taymiyya makes extensive use of the disjunctive reasoning indigenous  to Kalām theology to establish the various attributes of perfection rationally.  Accordingly, diverse attributes must be ascribed to God because the contrar- ies would render Him imperfect. For example, the shaykh says that reason  158 Akmaliyya, MF 6:72–3, 79–82. 159 Akmaliyya, MF 6:72–3; and I$sfahāniyya, 87–8. 160 Dar ±, 1:29–30; I$sfahāniyya, 85–6; Akmaliyya, MF 6:75–7; and Jawāb, 3:215–6. </page> <page sequence="46"> 64 chapter one knows necessarily that hearing and sight are attributes of perfection because  a living being who can see and hear is more perfect than one who cannot.  Similarly, one who is living and knowing is more perfect than one who is not.  Moreover, God must be qualified as hearing and seeing lest He be imperfect  and dependent upon another. If God were not qualified with hearing and  seeing, hearing and seeing creatures would be more perfect than He is, and  He would not be worthy of worship.161 In another example the same logic  applies to God’s life. If God were not qualified with life, an attribute to which  He has an essential right, he would be dead, and living creatures would be  more perfect than He would be.162 The following text provides a reasonably  comprehensive sample of such disjunctive reasoning: If [God] were not living, knowing, hearing, seeing and speaking, it would  necessarily follow that He is dead, ignorant, deaf, blind and mute. He must be  exonerated of these imperfections. Indeed, He—Glory be to Him—has created  whoever is living, hearing, seeing, speaking, knowing, powerful and moving  (mutah! arrik). So, He is all the worthier to be like that. Indeed, every perfection  in a caused, created thing is from the perfection of the Creator.163 While Kalām theologians often prove God’s attributes in like fashion, they  would not include movement as we find in this text. They would typically  reinterpret this and other alleged anthropomorphisms such as God’s descend- ing and coming that appear in the Qur±an and the Sunna. Ibn Taymiyya  however argues that if God could not move He would be inferior even to  inanimate objects. Such objects are at least subject to being moved by another.  Moreover, if God could move but did not, then He would be inferior to  objects that do move on their own initiative. Rather, a living being is mov- ing and active by itself.164 Ibn Taymiyya also provides arguments to prove and explain the perfection  of God’s other seemingly anthropomorphic attributes. For example, God is  qualified with laughter to exclude crying and with joy to exclude sadness.  Crying and sadness entail weakness and impotence that are not fitting for  God.165 Joy also appears in another argument. One who loves, rejoices and is  well pleased with attributes of perfection and who hates imperfection such  as injustice and ignorance is more perfect than one who does not differenti- ate between perfection and imperfection. Thus, love, joy, good pleasure and  161 I$sfahāniyya, 85, 87–8. 162 Jawāb, 3:208–9, 211. 163 Qudra, MF 8:21.

One who has power to act  by his hands is more perfect than one who does not because the former can  choose to act with his hands or through some other means whereas the latter  does not have the option of using his hands. By implication, God’s hands  are among His attributes of perfection.166 Exonerating God of certain imperfections poses slightly more difficulty for  Ibn Taymiyya. He admits that it is true that living beings that eat and drink  are more perfect than those that are sick and do not eat and drink. This is  because their sustenance depends upon eating and drinking. Nonetheless,  the creaturely perfections of eating and drinking are not completely free of  imperfection because they imply need, that is, need for food and drink. Now,  one who does not need to take anything into himself and is not dependent  on something outside himself is more perfect than one whose perfection  consists in eating and drinking. Thus, eating and drinking are not among  God’s attributes of perfection.167 Ibn Taymiyya argues that even the angels  do not eat and drink. Thus, God a fortiori does not eat and drink since God  is all the worthier of whatever perfections are found in creatures, in this  case the angels. Moreover, the shaykh adds, God’s not eating and drinking  is confirmed by the revealed tradition through God’s name Self-Subsistent  (al-!Samad).168 Ibn Taymiyya also asserts that the perfection of God’s attributes entails  their unlikeness to created things: “[God] is qualified by every attribute of  perfection such that no one bears any likeness to Him in it.”169 Paradoxi- cally, this means that God must be qualified with the highest conceivable  perfection and that the perfection of that perfection is to be completely  unlike any created thing. In his Tadmuriyya creed, the shaykh supports the  unlikeness of God’s attributes with a number of a fortiori arguments rooted  in his thoroughgoing nominalism and rejection of real universals. In one of these arguments, Ibn Taymiyya observes that the revealed sources  describe numerous things in Paradise such as foods, clothes, dwellings, mar- riage and so on. To this he adds a saying of Ibn ≠Abbās, “There is nothing in  this world that is in Paradise except the names.”170 Ibn Taymiyya then argues  that, if there is such a great distinction between the realities of Paradise and  166 Akmaliyya, MF 6:92–3. 167 Akmaliyya, MF 6:87. 168 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:86. 169 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:74. 170 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:28. </page> <page sequence="48"> 66 chapter one the realities of this world such that they share only the names given them,  the distinction between God and created things must be even greater.171 In a second argument, Ibn Taymiyya outlines the difficulty of pinning  down what it means for the human spirit (rū !h) to be powerful, hearing,  ascending at death and so on. Although we qualify the spirit with such  attributes, we cannot investigate its modality because we cannot see it. Thus,  the shaykh concludes, “If the spirit is qualified with these attributes, but  without their likeness to what is seen of created things, then the Creator is  all the worthier of His distinction from His creatures while being qualified  with His names and attributes that He deserves.”172 In a third argument from Tadmuriyya, Ibn Taymiyya states, “If the creature  is exonerated of likeness to [another] creature despite concordance in name,  then the Creator is all the worthier of being exonerated from likeness to a  creature even if there is concordance in name.”173 It may appear gratuitous  to presuppose that creatures bear no likeness (mumāthala) one to another  except in name. This is not explained in its context in Tadmuriyya, but it  fits with Ibn Taymiyya’s thoroughgoing rejection of the extramental status  of universals.174 Although Ibn Taymiyya maintains that the modalities of God’s attributes  are completely unlike those of creatures except for the names, he occasionally  ascribes a certain religious function to God’s attributes and acts by claiming  that a God without this or that attribute or act is not worthy of worship  (≠ibāda) or praise (h! amd). As noted in passing above, for example, Ibn Taymi- yya maintains that a God who cannot see and hear is not worthy of worship.  Similarly, he writes, “It is firmly established in natural constitutions that that  which does not hear, see or speak is not a lord who is worshipped. Similarly,  that which does not avail anything, does not guide and does not possess any  harm or benefit is not a lord who is worshipped.”175 Elsewhere, the shaykh  argues that a God who does not love has no right to be worshipped, and in  the theodicean text H( asana he states that a God who does not act with mercy  and wise purpose is not worthy of praise.176 Such assertions may suggest that  God should be praised and worshipped on account of His attributes and  acts. To draw this conclusion however would be misleading. 171 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:28. Cf. Ikhlā$s, MF 17:325–6 and (Hamawiyya, MF 5:115. 172 Tadmuriyya, MF 3:33. Cf.

He observes that God’s attributes of perfection are not  mentioned in the Qur±an merely to counter those who strip them away (ahl  al-ta≠$tīl). It also enumerates them to show God’s right to worship, especially  against the associationists (mushrikūn): “God—Glory be to Him—did not  mention these texts only to confirm the attributes of perfection for Him.  Rather, He mentioned them to make evident (li-bayān) that He has the right  to worship apart from any other.”177 The shaykh further notes that there are  two kinds of praise (!hamd) due to God: Praise is of two kinds: [1] praise for His beneficence to His servants, which  belongs to giving thanks; and [2] praise for that to which He has a right in  Himself (bi-nafsihi) with respect to the attributes of His perfection. This praise  is only for what He in Himself has a right to praise. Only one who is ascribed  with attributes of perfection, which are existing things (umūr wujūdiyya), has  a right to that. There is no praise, good or perfection in purely nonexisting  things.178 With this, it becomes clear that God is praised not only for what He does  but also for who He is in His very self (nafs), and, as indicated in the text,  Ibn Taymiyya links God’s attributes very intimately to God’s self or essence  (dhāt). He explains later in Akmaliyya that a perfect essence without attri- butes of perfection is impossible and that it is known necessarily that an  essence ascribed with such attributes is more perfect than one without. These  attributes are necessary concomitants (lawāzim) of God’s essence, without  which the essence would not exist. Thus, mentioning God’s attributes of  perfection is tantamount to mentioning His essence.179 In Akmaliyya, Ibn  Taymiyya is not as clear as he could be that worship and praise of God for  His essence and the concomitant attributes of perfection takes priority over  praise of God for His acts, but as we have seen earlier in this chapter, God’s  divinity—God’s right to worship in Himself—takes precedence over God’s  lordship and acts. God should be worshipped first for who He is and only  secondarily for what He does, and the role of God’s attributes of perfection  is to make evident God’s essential right to praise and worship. This religious  function of God’s attributes increases the gravity of Ibn Taymiyya’s juridical  search for the best way to speak about God. 177 Akmaliyya, MF 6:83. 178 Akmaliyya, MF 6:84. 179 Akmaliyya, MF 6:95–7.

For the shaykh, both reason and revelation yield knowledge of God’s  existence and basic human ethical ends, especially that God alone should be  worshipped. One aspect of worship is speaking correctly about God, and  the task of Ibn Taymiyya’s theological jurisprudence is to ascertain how to  do this. The shaykh explains that both reason and revelation specify that  God is ascribed with attributes of perfection and praiseworthiness. As for  revelation, the Qur±an and the Hadith indicate God’s attributes; the views  of early Qur±an exegetes and the conventions of the Arabic language delin- eate the linguistic meanings of these attributes; and similitudes are used to  suggest possible resolution of rational difficulties that may arise. Moreover,  God’s attributes are ontologically real, but on the basis of “There is nothing  like Him” (Q. 42:11) their modalities are entirely unknown. As for reason,  Ibn Taymiyya employs a fortiori argumentation to build a kind of natural  theology that takes human perfection as its point of departure for defining  God’s perfection while exonerating God of neediness and creaturely modali- ties. As the shaykh sees it, this is likewise the kind of theological reasoning  found in the Qur±an, finding specific support in the verse, “To God is the  highest similitude (al-mathal al-a≠lā)” (Q. 16:60). Although Ibn Taymiyya claims that independent reason or the natural  constitution, exercised without corrupting influences, will arrive at correct  theological doctrine, it is perhaps going too far, as I do above, to speak of  the shaykh building a natural theology. Rather, it seems clear enough that  he is devising his rational arguments so as to arrive safely at theological doc- trines held a priori on the basis of the authoritative tradition. With this in  mind, the methodology of Ibn Taymiyya’s theological jurisprudence may be  characterized more analytically as a two step process. The first step is more  properly theological. The shaykh seeks to determine what should be said  about God from the Qur±an and the Hadith, and he employs philosophical  concepts or models—similitudes—to elucidate the sense and coherence of  his ordinary language reading of these sources. The resulting theological  vision is that of a dynamic God who is far more engaged in the vicissitudes  of human life and the historical process than the God of the philosophers  and the Kalām theologians but who is in no way conflated with the created  world as the shaykh understands the God of Ibn ≠Arabī to be. This unique  concept of God provides the theological framework from within which Ibn  Taymiyya compares and critiques rival theologies. </page> <page sequence="51">  theological jurisprudence 69 The second step is apologetic. Ibn Taymiyya makes and seeks to dem- onstrate the claim that his theological vision is that of both tradition and  reason, which agree and confirm each other. He attempts to show that his  reading of the Qur±an and the Hadith follows the intentions of the Salaf,  accords with the conventions of the Arabic language and ascribes to God  the highest praise and perfection. Likewise, he asserts that this doctrine is  known by independent reason properly exercised and that such reasoning  is the kind found within revelation. With this, the shaykh seeks to claim  the rational high ground over against the Kalām theologians and Muslim  philosophers on behalf of his tradition-based theological vision. He resists  intellectual currents that each in their own way drift toward elitism and  esotericism, either elevating reason over revelation on the one hand (Kalām  theologians and especially philosophers) or subordinating reason to mysti- cal experience on the other (Ibn ≠Arabī). Thus, Ibn Taymiyya commends  his theological vision as both faithful to the revealed tradition and publicly  available to all right thinking people. In short Ibn Taymiyya’s juridical work on how to speak of God is theo- logical in both the sense that it has to do with God and in the sense that it  seeks to explore the rationality and coherence of theological doctrine derived  from revelation. It is apologetic in that it makes a claim not only on those  who accept revelation fideistically but on all persons of sound intellect, even  those without access to revelation. Thus, Ibn Taymiyya’s methodology may  be characterized most precisely, albeit awkwardly, as apologetic theological  jurisprudence. The remainder of this study examines how Ibn Taymiyya interprets Islamic  doctrine concerning the metaphysical and moral relationship between God  and His creatures and how he faces rational difficulties that arise concern- ing purposeful creation and God’s self-sufficiency, human responsibility and  God’s determination, and evil and God’s justice. Ibn Taymiyya could take  these diverse conundrums as keys to esoteric knowledge; or he could protest  that God’s ways with humankind appear unjust and irrational; or he could  abandon obedient worship of God altogether. But he does none of these. At  a number of points along the way, it becomes evident that his understanding  of God’s essential right to perfection and his apologetic aims impede giving  voice to paradox, protest or skepticism. In this light, Ibn Taymiyya’s theodicy  comes into view as a valiant juristic effort to find the best way to give God  the highest praise in the face of seemingly intractable rational dilemmas. </page> </plain_text>
