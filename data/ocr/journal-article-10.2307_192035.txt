<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLATO ETC.: THE PROBLEMS OFPHILOSOPHYAND THEIR RESOLU- TION by Roy Bhaskar. London and New York: Verso, 1994. 267 + xii pp. What is the relation between metaphilosophical questions of ontology and concrete questions of politics, between grand issues in epistemology and everyday questions of morality? What, if any, are the moral and political implications of one's stance on abstract and seemingly arid debates about reference and scientific explanation? Is it even necessary for us to take a stand on such issues? If it is, how do such stands shape, enable, constrain, and direct</page><page sequence="2">254 POLITICAL THEORY / April 1998 various research strategies in the social sciences? These are the questions that Roy Bhaskar's most recent book asks, and ambitiously seeks to answer. Although read only in discreet quarters of American political theory, in the past two decades Bhaskar has established himself in England as the chief proponent of a "realist" or "critical realist" conception of social science. This conception, which brings questions of ontology to the very center of norma- tive and scientific debates in the social sciences, has gained wide purchase among philosophers of natural science, and has recently attracted the atten- tion of social and political theorists such as Ian Shapiro, Jeffrey Isaac, and Peter Manicas. What these writers find appealing about realism generally and Bhaskar's work in particular is its claim to stake out a viable alternative to the foundationalist and conventionalist/postmodernist epistemologies that have so dominated recent debates in social theory and science. Finding the former dogmatic and unconvincing and the latter deeply relativistic if not nihilistic, realists advocate an approach to social science methodology that incorporates key elements of conventionalist critiques of foundationalism, yet remains committed to both causal analysis and the idea that science aims to, and sometimes does, produce true statements about the world. Bhaskar's earlier work-The Possibility of Naturalism ([1979] 1989) and Scientific Realism and Human Emancipation (1986)-was concerned with how, in a postmodern or at least postpositivist age, one might speak intelli- gibly and convincingly about such endangered concepts as rational explana- tion, ideology critique, human emancipation, freedom, and the good life. In his recent writings-especially the sprawling tome, Dialectic (1993)-these concerns remain, but are increasingly entangled with technical philo- sophical disputes about truth, reference, absence, negativity, and so on. The present work, which forms with Dialectic the first half of a projected quartet of books, conjoins his earlier and later concerns, exploring how philosophy today impedes, rather than advances, the quest for human free- dom and emancipation. As one might surmise from his title, Bhaskar guides the reader through the contested and multidimensional panorama of what are commonly called "the problems of philosophy"; that is, the "fundamental" and "perennial" questions regarding the nature of knowledge, truth, ethics, politics, language, and reality. These questions, Bhaskar notes, are typically thought to be perennial precisely because they are unresolvable. Indeed, as understood by Bertrand Russell-whose book with a similar title is cited at the outset of Bhaskar's study and might be considered the philosophical position against which Bhaskar's work is written-philosophy is defined by reflection on ultimate questions that defy demonstrable resolution. Thus philosophy's value lies not in its ability to generate definite answers to its questions but in</page><page sequence="3">BOOKS IN REVIEW 255 its capacity to liberate our minds from the prejudices and tyrannies of custom, to enlarge our sense of what is possible. When seemingly basic questions are answered, they cease thereby to be philosophical questions, and are instead exported to the provinces of particular sciences. This view, Bhaskar avers, is deeply mistaken. Philosophical problems appear unresolvable not because they necessarily defy solution but because philosophy itself is afflicted by pathologies that blind its practitioners to those solutions. Contemporary philosophy, he insists, "is on the wrong track" (p. x). Instead of probing the world and radically questioning basic ideological commitments, it mostly "only reflects the superficial sheen of reality" (p. x). Instead of offering "diagnostic clues to the nature of social, political, eco- nomic, cultural, ethical and scientific reality or realities" (p. x), it produces only surface paradox and stupefying dualism. Instead of proposing cures, it normalizes. In one way, Bhaskar's claims are hardly original. Discontent with "the tradition" of Western philosophy has been commonplace since the nineteenth century, and contemporary philosophers such as Richard Bernstein, Jurgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, and Jacques Derrida have sought to expose the reigning assumptions, analogies, metaphors, and missteps that have put philosophy on its present course. What makes Bhaskar's study interesting and distinctive is his diagnosis of philosophy's ills, and his prescriptions for renewal. He argues that the current maladies of philosophy are located not so much in the influence of logical positivism, pragmatism, analytical philoso- phy, the philosophy of consciousness, or "postmodernism" but more funda- mentally in the hegemony of "philosophical irrealism" (or nonrealism), a view derived from Parmenides and appropriated today by figures like Richard Rorty, W. V. Quine, Donald Davidson, and Hilary Putnam. Bhaskar defines irrealism as the denial of the existence of some contested "entity" or thing, be it God, causal laws, centaurs, or social structures. Irrealists about social structures, for instance, repudiate belief in the existence and causal efficacy of such structures, whereas irrealists about God deny the existence of a deity. Conceived in this manner, it is unclear why philosophical irrealism in general should agitate Bhaskar, since all persons are irrealists about some entities, and realists about others. What Bhaskar finds politically and philosophically troubling about irrealism, however, are the specifically reductionistic forms it takes in much mainstream philosophy and social theory. These are (1) actualism (reducing the necessary and the possible to the actual; for example, locating reality solely in events or states of affairs, thereby denying in principle the existence of underlying structures and generative mechanisms as possible causes and explanations of them), (2) monovalence (reducing reality to a purely positive account of it, thereby</page><page sequence="4">256 POLITICAL THEORY / April 1998 obscuring the fact that reality is partly constituted by and even parasitic upon absence or nonbeing), (3) anthropism (a combination of anthropocentrism, namely, viewing man as the locus or telos of the cosmos; and projective anthropomorphism, that is, describing or interpreting the cosmos as a reflec- tion of man), (4) extensionalism (dividing "a totality into discrete, separable, externally related parts" [p. 254], thereby divorcing, for example, morality from reality or values from facts), (5) moral irrealism (denying "that there is a moral truth" [p. 238]), and (6) deagentification (erasing of individual or collective agency through dualistic disembodiment, alienation, enervation, fragmentation, "empty selves," and various modes of identification). If this catalog of reductionisms strikes one as simultaneously grandiose and abstract, it is. And unfortunately, Bhaskar's book is filled with catalogs, inventories, and lists of this sort. Although these features may give his work scope, they also produce a narrative whose thin and strangely disembodied quality undercuts Bhaskar's purpose of convincing us that "philosophy matters" (p. 16). To cite one example of the limits of this strategy, Bhaskar attacks variants of ontological monovalence ranging from Parmenides's embrace of a singular and unified One Being (thus rendering impossible statements about nonbeing) to Karl Popper's well-known animadversions against nonexistential proofs in science. Against these views, he sketches a transcendental deduction designed to show that the concept of absence (nonbeing) is a precondition of science. Scientific texts and research reports, he maintains, are parasitic on data that they do not contain, as well as on preunderstandings of their context. Likewise, scientific experiments aimed at locating generative mechanisms succeed only through the elimination of extraneous causes or background noise. Even scientific modeling, insofar as it relies on metaphors and analogies derived from the past or appropriated from other disciplines, presupposes absence. While I believe that the above points, as well as Bhaskar's more general claim that "absence is constitutively necessary for presence" (p. 57), are correct, they are also widely recognized by philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science today. There is, for example, a substantial literature on the contextual features of scientific and especially laboratory practice; on the replication of observations and experiments across diverse contexts; on how local scientific practice draws on metaphors and analogies circulating through the larger culture; and on how backgrounds are carved away so that signals can shine through. All of this work assumes concepts of absence identical to Bhaskar's, and shows their relevance and function in a more precise and contextually bound manner. Unlike Bhaskar's own highly varied employment of the term, which is often so general and diffuse that it threatens to become trivially true and therefore analytically empty, current students of</page><page sequence="5">BOOKS IN REVIEW 257 science demonstrate in vivid detail how these processes work and what is at stake in them. On the other hand, Bhaskar is more instructive when showing how the absence of an adequate social or scientific ontology generates insuperable theoretical, practical, and moral problems. Ontological monovalence, he argues, is logically irreconcilable with ontologies that view the world as structured, stratified, and ambiguous. It is thus found in standard forms of empiricism and behavioralism that restrict scientific standing to explanations grounded in or deducible from experience or observable data. More interest- ing (and less obvious), it is also recognizable in some variants of discourse theory and poststructuralism. Indeed, Bhaskar implies that however unlikely the couplings of Carnap and Rorty, Hempel and Baudrillard, or Popper and Derrida may seem, there is in fact a discernible path that leads from classical positivism to contemporary forms of conventionalism, pragmatism, and "poststructuralist super-idealism." He intimates, moreover, that what links these seemingly incongruous pairs is a profound aversion to a "vertical or depth realism" of the sort that authorizes the reality of underlying powers and mechanisms that may not be directly observed or experienced, but neverthe- less cause observable and experiential phenomena. For classical empiricists, the cost of this ontological stance includes an emaciated, Humean construal of causality that cannot distinguish between necessary and accidental sequences of events; an unintelligible account of scientific practice and explanation; a conflation of the real with the empirical, and a consequent rationalization of the present as the real; and a reifying dichotomy between facts and values that substitutes emotivism and decision- ism for principled moral and political action. For various species of discourse theory and poststructuralism, the costs are surprisingly similar. Divested of any well-developed conception of ontological depth, they too lack the re- sources for distinguishing between constant conjunctions and underlying powers, structures, and mechanisms. Viewing discourses as self-referential systems of signs governed by autonomous and often incommensurable rules, or language as an unconstrained free play of circulating signifiers, they also undermine "judgmental rationality" and encourage complacent and politi- cally problematic claims such as Baudrillard's assertion that the 1991 Persian Gulf War was "a media event" (p. 39)-a half-truth that disguises at least as much as it reveals. Neglecting examination of the material and cultural structures in which texts are embedded, writers like Derrida are unable to account for how those texts gain meaning in the first place (p. 200). Taken together, these arguments constitute what is potentially the most important contribution of Bhaskar's book. They suggest that all discourse of a normative and scientific nature presupposes an implicit ontology, and one's</page><page sequence="6">258 POLITICAL THEORY / April 1998 stance on such ontological issues constrains in turn the kinds of evidence and arguments that one can adduce in defense of various normative and scientific claims. In this sense, all efforts to circumvent or supplant questions of ontology-whether they are made in the name of positivism, pragmatism, neo-Kantianism, nominalism, or postmodemism-are self-deceptive and futile. Building on this often neglected insight, Bhaskar articulates in the final chapters a robust defense of ontological realism, which he labels "dialectical critical realism," and links this stance with accounts of social agency, dialec- tics, ethics, freedom, emancipation, and the history of philosophy. Rejecting foundationalism and conventionalism alike, he proffers a naturalistic version of moral realism, argues for the derivability of values from facts, attacks the related norm of value neutrality in social scientific discourse, sketches a multilevel account of rationality that transcends narrow instrumentalism, and endorses participatory democracy as a necessary precondition of autonomy. As is beginning to be clear, the scope of this work is breathtaking, moving from analyses of pre-Socratic and Platonic philosophy to technical arguments about reference, truth, and causality to highly charged controversies about scientific explanation and finally to perplexing questions of moral judgment, dialectics, and social and political theory. Moreover, although much of this material will be familiar to readers of Bhaskar's previous writings, Plato etc. contains some interesting new wrinkles; for example, the author's effort to extend his critical engagement with postempiricist philosophers like Paul Feyerabend, Peter Winch, and Rorty into a full-blown analysis and critique of all varieties of philosophical irrealism, both ancient and modern. Unfor- tunately, these ambitions and achievements are mitigated by two significant defects. First, much of the work manifests what Bhaskar himself would call a "performative contradiction," or theory/practice inconsistency. That is, Bhaskar's ontology of human existence is grounded in the idea that human thought and activity are irremediably historical and hermeneutical in charac- ter. Our ideas, he maintains, are not the products of a mental version of spontaneous combustion, nor do they float like clouds across the expansive plains of history and material life. Rather, they emerge in response to and are shaped by the contexts and webs of meaning that embed them. This implies, however, that the contextualization of ideas and practices is not simply a pleasant adornment-something that adds an attractive patina to narratives but is epistemically irrelevant to them-but is instead an indispensable precondition for any adequate interpretation of those ideas and practices. Yet Bhaskar's narrative and philosophical practice contain almost no contextu- alization of this sort. Indeed, his discussions of philosophical ideas and disputes are often radically unhistorical, an especially peculiar fact for</page><page sequence="7">BOOKS IN REVIEW 259 someone so critical of contemporary philosophical practice. Instead of chal- lenging the tendency to view philosophy as a vast and unsituated conversation across the ages, he succumbs to it. So, for instance, the final chapter, "Philosophy and the Dialectic of Emancipation," attempts to trace "the genealogy of the fall of actually existing socialism from Hume" (p. 202). But this "genealogy" is entirely conceptual, and thin. It is without any of the rich and allusive detail characteristic of Foucault's genealogies, or even the more modest degree of thick description found in the work of social philosophers like Alasdair MacIntyre, Martha Nussbaum, or Charles Taylor. Moreover, among the unfortunate consequences attending this philosophical practice is a tendency on Bhaskar's part to rehearse official interpretations of particular philosophers rather than engage directly with their problematic and some- times surprisingly resistant texts. Heidegger, for instance, is often treated as an exemplary idealist, yet this interpretation, although common enough, is highly contestable.' There is a second, and even more serious, defect: the willful desire of the author to write in a prose style that inevitably excludes, rather then invites, readers. At times the language is almost tortuously difficult to penetrate, not only because of Bhaskar's obvious affection for neologisms, symbols, for- malization, and foreign words (especially of the Greek and German variety), but also because he uses freely almost every technical vocabulary found in philosophy and social theory. This includes the vocabularies of analytical and linguistic philosophy, the philosophy of science and social science, Kantian- ism, Hegelianism, Marxism, and several varieties of poststructuralism. Mix- ing these disparate vocabularies with his own neologisms and symbolic codes, Bhaskar achieves a curious and inelegant pastiche, one that often reads like a modern-day Swiftian satire of insular and inflated academic discourse. One sentence, for example, reads as follows: Thus one could start from Heraclitian dialectical contradiction, move through Socratic- Platonic-Aristotelian dialectical argument with its characteristic figure of the dialectical distinction (dd'), or thematize specifically Platonic dialectical reason (dr') or Aristotelian dialectical propaedeutics, move through Platonism to Schillerian dialectical process (dp') or Kantian dialectical limit (dl'), which has a modem equivalent in the Derridian inversion, chiasmus and erasure of the traditional hierarchies of philosophy, viz. the (anti-)dialectical remark (drk), to Hegelian dialectical totality (dt') and sublation (ds'), which progresses by the continual reiterated application of U-D-R schemata, in which an immanent meta-critical dialectical comment (dc') on the preceding phase isolates a theory/practice inconsistency in it, through to Marxian dialectical explanatory argument, in which the ontological necessity of false orpartial categories of forms are demonstrated (da') in terms of their dialectically contradictory causal grounds (dg') to the 4D notion of dialectical praxis (do), as the coherence of theory and practice in practice (absolute</page><page sequence="8">260 POLITICAL THEORY / April 1998 reason [dra']), or the dialectic of freedom, the roots of which can be traced back to Plato but begins its recognizably modem form with Hegel, which I will discuss in Chapter 7. (p. 132-33) Even those who have carefully read their way through Plato etc. will likely find such passages not just daunting but barbarous and obscurantist. They will also conclude that there is something deeply misleading about the claims, found on the back cover, that this is Bhaskar's "most accessible book to date," and that "the book serves ... as an introduction to philosophy." Not surprisingly, Bhaskar is alert to this and other potential charges. Anticipating them, he argues in the Preface that "a new abstract terminology, with a multiplicity of points of entry into it, is often a prerequisite for intellectual progress. Pre-Socratic philosophy and late scholastic science are two examples of what can happen in its absence" (p. xi). This, of course, is undeniably true, and no doubt many of us have had the experience of plodding confusedly through an alien vocabulary, only to find unanticipated intellec- tual treasures awaiting as we finally begin to grasp those initially mysterious terms, meanings, and modes of thought. It is, one might add, also undeniably true that one of the most venerable and effective rhetorical strategies for dismissing competing ideas is simply to announce that the language in which those ideas are couched is incoherent or unintelligible. Nevertheless, Bhaskar's prose fails to satisfy even his own prescribed standards. Far from offering "a multiplicity of points of entry" into his work, his prose style yields a narrative that more closely resembles several layers of steel belts. Whatever manages to pass through the outer layers is almost certain to be halted at some point along the way. Quite simply, nothing is gained by designating as power, and power2 conceptions of power that have long been parsed by the phrases "power to" and "power over." Nor is the reader's insight sharpened by Bhaskar's use of Umwelt or eudaemonistic, when adequate and much more accessible English cognates exist. Indeed, Bhaskar continually violates the Aristotelian injunction not to seek a degree of exactness that the subject itself will not admit. This form of modern scholasticism is especially disturbing when coming from someone of Bhaskar's political sensibility. As I have indicated, his stated political commitments are neither elitist nor technocratic (in which case his self-referential prose style might plausibly be defended), but are instead radically democratic and egalitarian. Even his conception of philoso- phy is aggressively transformative, aspiring to nothing less than "an anti-Par- menidean revolution, reversing 2,500 years of philosophical thought" (p. xi). These aims, I would argue, carry with them a logical and moral obligation to speak in a voice that invites conversation and response from a wide and</page><page sequence="9">BOOKS IN REVIEW 261 diverse range of audiences. This, of course, does not mean that one must speak solely in a monosyllabic register, or eschew all language that cannot be found in the latest edition of Newsweek. Indeed, writers from Carol Gilligan to Jeffrey Isaac are proof that it is possible to articulate complex and challenging ideas in a voice that is simultaneously rigorous, engaged, and accessible. It does, however, mean that there is a profound difference between the schol- arship of professional physicists and engineers, whose work is typically directed only to a small group of highly trained specialists, and the work of democratic social philosophers, whose constituency includes specialists but by definition cannot be limited to them. Put simply, it is inconsistent for one to espouse a politics that is explicitly inclusive and egalitarian while articu- lating those political commitments in a language that is exclusive and inaccessible to all but the initiated. In short, this is an intriguing but quite perplexing book. It aims to reinvigorate philosophy, yet seems destined to alienate precisely those con- stituencies that the author purportedly wants to address. It is animated by deep moral and political concerns, but articulates those concerns in a lan- guage and argumentative strategy that often renders them more, rather than less, abstract. Given these features, one almost longs for the relative clarity of his earlier writings. In those works, Bhaskar contributed significantly both to the revival of interest in ontological realism among contemporary philoso- phers and social theorists, and to discussions regarding alternatives to the prevailing orthodoxies in the philosophy of social science. It is therefore particularly unfortunate that the ambitions, insights, and virtues of this book are marred by the problems cited above. NOTE 1.
