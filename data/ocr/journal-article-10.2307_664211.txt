<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Science of Culture: A Study of Man and Civilization. LESLIE A. WHITE. (xx, 444 pp., $6.00. Farrar, Straus and Company, New York, 1949.) This volume comprises a collection of essays, most of which have been published previously, dealing with problems in the philosophy of science and the theory of cul- ture. In bringing these essays together, Dr. White has made available a series of sig- nificant and challenging studies which merit serious consideration, not only for their positive, constructive contribution, but also and primarily, for the stimulus which his polemical arguments are bound to provide in provoking a re-evaluation of contempo- rary thought on these basic issues. Dr. White's main theme is that the science of culture, "Culturology," represents a distinct, newly emerging discipline whose data and laws are independent of those of psychology and sociology. Culturology is said to represent a closed system wherein given cultural phenomena are to be explained solely in terms of other cultural phenom- ena. The "Copernican Revolution" brought about by culturology consists, according to White, in the notion that culture is to be conceived as an objective, autonomous reality sui generis, which not only can be, but "must be" (p. 86) explained "as if" it were independent of man, taken both individually and collectively. Man is indeed necessary as a carrier or vehicle of culture, since it is admitted that culture per se does not act, but all causal efficacy must be attributed to culture as the ultimate, self-in- telligible, "dynamic system that behaves and grows in terms of its own principles and laws" (pp. 166-167). The notion that man is even partially a free agent capable of self- determination is dismissed as a prescientific notion reminiscent of primitive animism and anthropomorphism, and involving the delusion of the "omnipotence" of human thought and effort. With reference to his philosophy of science, White states that "the general picture of the development of the sciences as seen by Comte is essentially the same as ours" (p. 58). He accepts Comte's theory of the three stages of the development of thought, namely, the theological or animistic, the metaphysical and the scientific, but differs from the latter as regards the interdependence of the sciences. As against Comte's thesis of "the necessary connection of the sciences" White maintains that "The scientist must always abstract a certain segment of reality, a certain class of phenomena, from all others, and deal with them as if it existed by itself, independent of the rest" (p. 61). In his philosophy of culture history, however, White's position is most akin to the historical materialism of Karl Marx, since, like the latter, he postulates that eco- nomic-technological conditions are the primary, determining factors in cultural de- velopment. Thus he states: "We may view a cultural system as a series of three hori-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 519 zontal strata: the technological layer on the bottom, the philosophical on the top, the sociological stratum in between. These positions express their respective roles in the culture process. The technological system is basic and primary" (p. 366). Cultural progress is evaluated in terms of "the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year." White's position differs from the orthodox Marxist position in that it allows no scope for revolutionary activity in transforming or accelerating the direction of cultural de- velopment, since to do so would be tantamount to admitting a subjective, human factor as a source of cultural change. By way of commenting on White's theses, I should say, first of all, that I find no intrinsic objection to the use of the term "culturology" to connote a science of cul- ture. What I do find objectionable is his dogmatic and simplistic insistence that cul- turology is to be understood only in terms of his Neo-Comtean philosophy of science and his Marxian, materialistic, deterministic philosophy of culture history. Furthermore, while objecting to metaphysical thought as prescientific, White him- self postulates that culture is, or must be treated "as if" it actually were, a reality sui generis-which is a metaphysical proposition if ever there was one. What he does, in effect, is to set up Culture as a new metaphysical entity, as a new God to replace the God of classical Western theology, thereby emulating indirectly Comte's religion of humanity and Durkheim's theory of Society as the supreme reality underlying the ele- mentary forms of religious experience. It is rather ironical to contemplate that White, who cannot tolerate the mere mention of the concept of God in an ethnological paper, has himself deified Culture and thereby effectively reduced culturology to a new theol- ogy-all in the name of Science. White seems to think that the alternatives are either a complete cultural deter- minism or an omnipotent human freedom and therefore chooses the former as the only alternative compatible with a science of culturology. What he fails to see is that those anthropologists and sociologists who acknowledge human freedom subscribe to neither of these extreme positions. They admit the fact of cultural determinism (as well as cosmic, geographic determinism) as one element in the human situation, and yet recog- nize that there is some scope for human self-determination insofar as human effort is guided by intelligence. Otherwise the facts of cultural diversity and cultural selection become unintelligible. According to White, however, "it is the individual who is ex- plained in terms of his culture, not the other way around" (p. 168). I know of no better example of how a "scientific" theory may lead a man to deny the facts of his common humanity and common sense for the sake of his theory. In brief, White's Science of Cul- ture is a reduction to absurdity of the notion of a superorganic, superpsychic theory of culture.
