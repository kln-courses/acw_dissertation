It shows that the functional-configurational and onto- logical-contaminationist frameworks often coexisted, competed, or alter- nated with each other, offering not only different ways of looking at the  world, but authorizing different action in it. Examination of Northern Song  (959-1126) campaigns to stop the practice, identified with “southerners,” of  avoiding contact with and thereby neglecting the sick, and of Southern  Song (1127-1279) controversies over contagion, reveals ideological bases for  literati-officials’ preference and support for functional over ontological  theories.  Twenty-five years ago, Paul Unschuld argued that then-current scholarly  and popular understandings of Chinese medicine had been shaped by the  selection, out of the heterogeneous breadth of traditional Chinese health  care modalities, of those conceptual systems that suited the “cognitive                                                             1 This article is drawn in part from TJ Hinrichs, Chapter 6, “Epidemics and  Contagion: Resources for Response and Debate,” in Hinrichs (2003), PhD Diss., pp.  130-202.

This was a “functional” modality that, rather  than eradicating diseases or pathogens from the body, diagnosed individu- ally specific patterns of systemic disorder, and focused on the maintenance  and restoration of vitality. Neglected by westerners were China’s rich  repertoires of “ontological” approaches that treated an ailment as a “‘being’  of itself, or ... a definable pathological agent,” and which tended to localize  disease to particular parts of the body.3 Unschuld pointed out that the three  epistemological approaches were also, historically (and ironically), proper- ties of European medicine. Humoral and constitutional approaches, for  example, operated by functional principles, and germ theory by ontological  ones. He emphasized that   despite occasional explicit antagonisms—in China as in  Europe, the empirical, the individualistic-functional, and  the localistic-ontological approaches have rarely been  clearly separated; these three ‘strategies’ have often  supplemented and mutually penetrated each other, and  to a significant degree, it is only our epistemological  analysis that cuts them apart.4                                                             2 Unschuld (1987), p. 1023.  3 Unschuld (1987), p. 1025.    Unschuld also identified a third modality, “pragmatic,” but this essay focuses  on “functional” and “ontological” theories.   Where possible, this article translates bing 病 as “disease” to convey the sense of  an ontologically distinct entity; as “disorder” to convey the sense of a state of  dysfunction; and as “illness” or a similar term when to convey the sense of a  phenomenological experience.  The functional-ontological dichotomy is similar to Owsei Temkin’s distinction  between physiological and ontological models, which has been influential among  western medical historians. See Temkin (1977), especially chapter “The Scientific  Approach to Disease: Specific Entity and Individual Sickness,” pp. 441-455.  One of the anonymous readers to this article pointed out that the term  “ontology” is a peculiar one for distinguishing epistemologies based on discrete  entities: the qi and the physiological systems of functional medicine also, onto- logically speaking, are taken to exist. “Agential” would capture the sense that is the  primary interest of this article: diseases caused by distinct sentient entities.  Ontological approaches in medicine, though, also target diseases, themselves  treated as distinct entities, as the objects of analysis and therapy. See Unschuld  (1987), p. 1025.  4 Unschuld (1987), p. 1026.  </page> <page sequence="3"> TJ HINRICHS: THE CATCHY EPIDEMIC                                                          21    Unschuld went on to argue that the proclivity for making such episte- mological distinctions comes from a western tendency to distinguish  conceptual systems exclusively of each other, which he relates in part to the  influence of the Catholic church’s theological activities, whereas in China  intellectuals preferred to reconcile disagreement in terms of shared  common ground.5  Today, after extensive critique of such generalized contrasts between  China and the west for, among other sins, essentializing cultures, historians  tend to avoid them. The comparative approach, though, can generate new  and useful perspectives. The differentiation of “functional” and “onto- logical” modalities turns out to help elucidate not only modern westerners’  partiality, but the stakes behind past Chinese medical writers’ preferences  for certain explanations. Unschuld’s short article also brings attention to  the institutional contexts that encourage the clarification and rejection of  difference as opposed to its elision and incorporation—both of which  strategies, on closer examination, we find in historical writings on Chinese  medicine. This essay explores functional and ontological etiological  distinctions and the social and political stakes behind them through the  case of writings on Warmth disorders/diseases and Warmth epidemics  (wenbing 溫病, wenyi 溫/瘟疫) in the period from the Han to the Song  dynasties.6  As a type of epidemic, Warmth was often singled out for its virulence,  something that historians have related to its identification with diseases of  the hot south, devastating to immuno-naive troops and settlers from the                                                             5 Unschuld, (1987), p. 1027.  6 Technical medical names of disease/disorder categories like Warmth, and of  medical physiological terms like Liver (for functional Liver system) will be  capitalized.   Some scholars translate “Warmth” as “Warm,” or vary between the two  depending on whether the term is used as an adjective or noun; I translate it as  “Warmth” throughout. Although the translation of “Warmth disorders” for wenbing  implies that wenbing are caused by Warmth, in some cases the cause is actually  Cold; in some cases wenbing is, as we will see, caused by non-climatic factors; and in  some the etiologies are ambiguous or contradictory.  “Warmth” in these cases,  could derive from the climatic quality of the season (spring) or region (south) in  which the ailment appears, or to the symptom of fever; the sources are ambiguous.  When referring explicitly to the symptom of fever, though, early medical texts  usually use re 熱.    In the last decade and a half, Warmth Disorders and Warmth Epidemics have  had some prominence both in scholarly literature on Chinese medical and religious  history and in writings on Chinese medicine. See, for example, Hanson (2011);  Hanson (1998); Hanson (1997); Benedict (1996), pp. 101-121; Lee (1995); Katz (1995);  Lee (1993a).      </page> <page sequence="4"> 22                                                                                                  EASTM 41 (2015)    north. 7  The disease category became curiously marginalized and even  controversial in the Song period (960-1279 AD), a time when epidemics  became a prominent object of state medical relief and medical theorization,  and southern healing customs became targets of social reform policies.8  Warmth in fact had long posed special problems for epidemiological  theorization, and the ways in which those became conspicuous in the Song  is revealing of the social and political considerations that shaped  physicians’ and literati’s epistemological choices.   Warmth in Functional-Configurational Models   of Epidemics  Early Chinese theories of epidemics extrapolated from functional and  ontological logics, producing what we can, following Charles Rosenberg,  label configurational and contamination models. In configurational views,  “[a]n epidemic was the consequence of a unique configuration of circum- stances, a disturbance in a “normal”—health-maintaining and health- constituting—arrangement of climate, environment, and communal life.”9  Contamination, in contrast, involved “the transmission of some morbid  material,” usually from one individual to another.10 Ontological-contamina- tion models, to be discussed at greater length below, posited the movement  of discrete pathological agents from person to person.   Configurational models viewed epidemics as products of climatic  irregularities. As in functional medicine, the dominant metaphors were  resonance and flow: Individual health was a state in which qi 氣 harmo- nized with the appropriate phases of the macrocosm, moving through the  body in regular circuits; population health was fostered when climates and  seasons followed cosmically-patterned cycles. Illness was a state in which  qi was out of phase, was stagnant or flowed too fast or in the wrong                                                             7 Lee (1993a), pp. 423 ff; Lin (1995a).  8  On state policies toward and medical theorization of epidemics, see  Goldschmidt (2009).  On Song campaigns to “transform” southern healing customs, see Hinrichs  (2003).  9 Where configurational theories are tied to canonical medicine-based functional  physiology, I use the compound term “functional-configurational.” To bring  attention to the tight connection between ontological etiologies and theories of  contagion, I use the compound term “ontological-contaminationist.”   10 See “Explaining Epidemics,” in Rosenberg (1992), pp. 293-295.

Generally, qi was healthy and “regular” (“upright,”  “correct,” “orthopathic”—zheng 正), or was “noxious” (“askew,” “oblique,”  “deviant,” “heteropathic”—xie 邪), not in and of itself but in contingent  relation to its function or dysfunction in the microcosm of the person.11 In  contrast to western humoral concerns with plethora and excess, functional- configurational Chinese medicine was critically concerned with invasion of  the body through the pores and orifices, whether by specified climatic  influences such as Wind or Cold, or more generalized noxious (xie) qi.12  In accord with its emphasis on function and physiology, and despite its  attention to external climatic factors, there was no direct discussion of  epidemics as such in those portions of the Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor  considered to survive from before Wang Bing 王冰 (c. 710-805) edited it in  the eighth century.13 Yi 疫 and minbing 民病 (“disease of the populace/  commoners”), generic terms for epidemics, do not appear at all. Li 癘,  which in later periods usually referred to more virulent epidemics,  appeared three times in the Inner Canon to identify diseases with Wind  etiologies and some symptoms similar to leprosy (also known as “Grand  Wind” (dafeng 大風)).14 Nüe 瘧, whose most prominent symptoms included  alternating chills and fevers, thus often translated as “Intermittent Fevers,”  was also linked to the etiology of Wind.15 The Inner Canon also laid out the  disease-producing climatic conditions that, while not then explicitly  marked as epidemic, suggested themselves as such for later writers:  When there is damage by Cold in winter, in spring there  will necessarily be warmth [febrile] disorders (wenbing).  When there is damage by Wind in spring, in summer it                                                             11 For discussions of the etymologies and technical meanings of zheng and xie,  see Lo and Schroer (2005); Porkert (1973), pp. 52-54, 172.   For accounts of the emergence of functional medicine in the Han period, see, for  example, Hsu (2010); Lo (2001); Hsu (2001); Li (2000); Harper (1998), pp. 3-109; Sivin  (1995); Unschuld (1985), pp. 51-100.  12 For this contrast humoral and Chinese medicine, see Kuriyama (1999). On the  etiology of Wind in Chinese medicine, see Hsu (2007); Kuriyama (1999), pp. 233- 270; Kuriyama (1994).  13 Sections 66-71 and 74 of Huangdi neijing suwen, which are widely considered  to be at the earliest Tang additions to the text, discuss epidemics in relation to the  system of Five Circulatory Phases and Six Climatic Influences (wuyun liuqi 五運六  氣). See below.   14 Li appears only three times in the Huangdi neijing suwen yishi, sections 35-36.  15 Huangdi neijing suwen yishi, sections 35-36.      </page> <page sequence="6"> 24                                                                                                  EASTM 41 (2015)    will generate diarrhea. In summer when there is damage  by Summer-Heat, in autumn there will necessarily be  intermittent fevers; in Autumn when there is damage by  Damp, in winter it will generate coughs.16  In later works of this tradition, damage by cold, the first item in this list,  rose in salience as the disease category Cold Damage, and became the  primary focus of epidemiological interest in functional-configurational  medicine.17    Zhang Zhongjing 張仲景 (142-220) said that he wrote Shanghan lun 傷寒 論 (Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders) to help people avoid high death rates  due to epidemics such as those of the first decade of the Jian’an Period  (196-220 AD). During that time two-thirds of his relatives, numbering over  200, succumbed to disease, seven tenths from epidemic fevers. Except for  this account in his preface, just as in the Inner Canon, the text as it comes  down to us eschewed mention of epidemics, and rarely mentioned external  factors except as they might exacerbate a condition, for example in the case  of Wind.18 Rather, it concentrated on analyzing myriad variations in Cold  Damage pathologies according to the Three Yin and Three Yang physio- logical modalities, and making fine distinctions among manifestations in                                                             16 Huangdi neijing suwen yishi, 5.35. “Damage” (shang 傷) is sometimes translated  as “injury.”   17 Wenbing came to designate a sub-category of Cold Injury, “Warmth Disor- ders,” as here a spring manifestation of winter damage by cold. Given the  symmetry of this Inner Canon passage, wenbing should be read as analogous to  “diarrhea,” “intermittent fevers,” and “coughs”—as referring to characteristic  symptoms. Thus, wenbing here might best be read as an alternate term for febrile  disorders (rebing 熱病), identified with Cold Damage (shanghan 傷寒) later in the  work. Huangdi neijing suwen yishi, sections 31-33. Section 31 opens with the general  statement, “The Yellow Emperor asked, ‘Now, as for Febrile Disorders, all are of the  Cold Damage category.’” Huangdi neijing suwen yishi, 190.   In contrast to this passage, in which differences between symptoms are as  obvious as differences between seasonal etiology, later works in the tradition  distinguished seasonal disorders from each other not by gross symptoms, which  they shared—mainly fever, chills, sweating, and aches—but by their climatic  etiologies.  18 Between this text’s first appearance at the end of the Han and the Song, its  transmission was obscure. The text that we have now was reorganized by Wang  Shuhe in the third century and reconstructed again in the eleventh century. See  Goldschmidt (2009), pp. 95-99.  </page> <page sequence="7"> TJ HINRICHS: THE CATCHY EPIDEMIC                                                          25    pulse; in the intensity, quality and location of aches; and in the timing of  fever, chills, and sweating.19   While the Inner Canon made broad generalizations about the symptoms  characteristic of each seasonal disorder and Zhang Zhongjing guided the  physician’s subtle differentiation of individual cases, later works did not  distinguish between seasonal epidemics by symptom—all shared fever and  aches. For lay people, seasonal epidemics were fundamentally a single  disease.20 Not surprisingly, though, given the centrality of yearly cycles to  the cosmologies that underlay classical medical theory as well as political  ideology and religious ritual, post-Han medical theorists, especially those  with close ties to imperial courts or ruling elites, gave close attention to  seasonal climatic factors in their analyses of febrile epidemics.  For example, Zhubing yuanhou lun 諸病源侯論 (Comprehensive Treatise on  the Origins and Symptoms of Diseases), the nosological work that Medical  Erudite (taiyi boshi 太醫博士) Chao Yuanfang 巢元方 presented to the Sui  dynasty throne in 610 AD, greatly elaborated on and systematized the  climatic etiologies of seasonal disorders.21 Chao devoted chapters seven  through eleven to disorders due to Seasonal Qi and epidemics.22 Chao also  gave theoretical justification to the primacy of the Cold Damage category:  while the qi of each season, including spring Warmth, could injure, Cold  Damage stood as the primary and defining type, as was apparent in the  organization of this portion of the book: 1) Cold Damage began the section;  2) it had two whole chapters devoted to it instead of one or a section of one,  as for other categories; 3) it retained a distinctive terminology, the  disorders of other seasons being simply “disorders” or “diseases” (bing 病),                                                             19 These are Greater Yin (taiyin 太陰), Lesser Yin (shaoyin 少陰), Reverting Yin  (jueyin 厥陰), Greater Yang (taiyang 太陽), Yang Brightness (yangming 陽明), and  Lesser Yang (shaoyang 少陽), and correspond to various Channels. The six Yin-Yang  modalities are laid out in Huangdi neijing suwen yishi, section 6.    20 See, for example, Ge Hong’s comments quoted below.  21  It is the first known work to attempt a comprehensive categorization of  diseases along with discussions of their origins and symptoms. Its definitions have  served as the starting points for medical works from the 992 AD Taiping shenghui  fang 太平聖惠方 (Taiping Era Formulae of Sagely Grace) to modern “Traditional  Chinese Medicine” dictionaries and textbooks.  22 Chapters seven and eight are on Cold Damage Disorders, chapter nine on  Seasonal Qi (shiqi 時氣) Disorders and Heat (or Febrile) (re) Disorders, chapter ten  on Warmth (wen) Disorders and Epidemics (yili 疫癘), and chapter eleven on  Intermittent Fevers (nüe). I include Intermittent Fevers here among Seasonal Qi  because of Chao’s description of them as an autumnal disorder resulting from  injury by Summer-Heat in the summer.    </page> <page sequence="8"> 26                                                                                                  EASTM 41 (2015)    not “damage” (shang 傷).23 The text also gave this primacy explicit theoreti- cal justification:  The Classic says that Spring qi is warm (wen) and mild.24  Summer qi is hot. Autumn qi is clear and cool. Winter qi is  cold. This then is the progression of the correct qi (zhengqi)  of the four seasons. In the winter season it is severely cold  and the myriad types of things store deeply. The Noble  Man (junzi 君子 ) keeps himself firmly closed in, and  therefore is not injured by cold. Those who contact [the  cold] then become injured by it. Injury by the qi of the  four seasons in all cases can become disease. Yet Cold  Damage can become toxic because it is the most deadly  and violent (shali 殺厲) qi.25 In those that immediately  become sick, it becomes Cold Damage. In those who do  not immediately become sick, the Cold toxin is stored  inside the flesh and bones. When spring comes, it changes  into Warmth Disorder (wenbing). In the summer, it  changes into Summer-Heat Disorder (shubing 暑病). ... In  all cases it is brought about by having contacted (chumao  觸冒) [Cold] in the winter season.26    Unlike the qi of other seasons, then, Cold Qi was particularly virulent and  could develop into a toxin that remained dormant, emerging later in the  year. While in the Inner Canon passage seasonal factors acted symmetri- cally, in Chao’s work it was only Cold that laid dormant.27                                                               23 Zhubing yuanhou lun jiaozhu, pp. 216-357.  24 I did not find this passage in extant recensions of Inner Canon texts. This  passage does appear in the fifth century text Xiaopin fang 小品方, which comes  down to us only as excerpted in other works. As quoted in the Waitai miyao fang 外 臺祕要方, 752, it cites the “Great treatise on Yin and Yang,” which could correspond  to section 5 of the Suwen. However, this passage is not there. Xiaopin fang xinji 小品 方新輯 (1993), 60. The passage also opens the second chapter of the Shanghan lun  zhujie 傷寒論注解 (1983-1986), 2.1. While it appears to have been in an edition of the  Shanghan lun consulted by Cheng, it is not in the 1066 Bureau for Editing Medical  Treatises edition of the Treatise, and is not in Zhang Zhongjing’s Jingui yaolüe 金匱要 略.   25 The annotators suggest that it is “deadly and violent” because of the extreme  Yin nature of Cold. See Zhubing yuanhou lun jiaozhu, 230, fn. 4.  26 Zhubing yuanhou lun jiaozhu, 7.217-218.    27 Zhubing yuanhou lun jiaozhu, 7-11 passim. This is even true of Intermittent  Fevers (juan 11).    </page> <page sequence="9"> TJ HINRICHS: THE CATCHY EPIDEMIC                                                          27    Chao Yuanfang also distinguished Cold Damage from “Seasonally  Spread” (shixing 時行) disorders both in severity and in kind:  [Cold Damage disorders that change into Warmth or  Summer-Heat Disorders] are not the qi of Seasonally  Spread [disorders]. As for Seasonally Spread [disorders],  these [happen when] in the spring season it should be  warm yet to the contrary it is cold; in the summer season  it should be hot but to the contrary it is cold; in the  autumn season it should be cool but to the contrary it is  hot; in the winter season it should be cold but to the  contrary it is warm. It is not the season for it, yet there is  that qi. Because of this, within one year, many illnesses  resemble each other without regard to youth or age. This,  then, is Seasonally Spread qi.28    In contrast to the Cold Damage pattern, then, in which the qi normal to a  given season caused sickness, in Seasonally Spread disorders qualities of qi  appeared when they should not. The Suwen 素問 (Plain Questions) passage  and Chao’s Cold Damage suggested dangers built into the correct pattern  of seasons: Cold, Wind, Damp, and Summer Heat from which people  should protect themselves in turn. Seasonally Spread qi was the product of  climate gone awry, suggesting a category more akin to disasters such as  flood and drought. In Han political theory, this potentially pointed to  imperial caprice or negligence. It continued to do so in the Song, although  theoretical innovations suggested that these irregularities, too, were built  into cosmological patterns, not necessarily departures from them; and  hence they might be predictable—and something for which you could  prepare if you could get the calculations right.    Thus, where Zhang Zhongjing carefully analyzed the varied pathologi- cal courses of Cold Damage disorders, Chao Yuanfang gave primacy to  external etiologies, and focused on distinctions among different varieties of  seasonal disorder. 29  Tang and Song formularies (fangshu 方書 ) rarely  matched Zhang’s and Chao’s works in making fine categorical distinctions,  and in some ways gave even more prominence to Cold Damage. In his Beiji  qianjin yaofang 備急千金要方  (Priceless and Essential Formulae for                                                             28 Zhubing yuanhou lun jiaozhu, 279-280. Nearly the same passage also appears on  218.   29 Chao made less subtle distinctions among manifestations of seasonal illnesses.  He focused on the strength, location, and timing of fevers, chills, sweating, and  aches, and related them more broadly to the movement of the diseases from surface  to interior, and from top to bottom of the body.

Zhang Zhongjing’s work on Cold Damage received limited attention  before the Song. 31  In 1066 the Bureau for Editing Medical Treatises  (jiaozheng yishuju 校正醫書局 , established in 1057), issued a sparingly  annotated edition, fueling—and perhaps sparking—a resurgence of interest  in the text and its approach to treatment.32 This was reinforced by a vogue  for analyzing epidemics and Cold Damage disorders according to the  theory of Five Circulatory Phases and Six Climatic Qi (wuyun liuqi 五運六氣 , hereafter “Five Phases and Six Qi”).33 This cosmological system was based  on calculating correlations between the ten celestial stems and twelve  terrestrial branches calendar, the Five Phases, the Six Climatic Influences,  and was distinctive from other divinatory and calendrical systems for its  further correlation with the Three Yin and Three Yang modalities of  Chinese medicine, those by which Zhang Zhongjing had organized his  treatments of Cold Damage.34 It had many applications, including weather  prediction and geomancy, but its primary employment and development  was in the field of medicine.35 Here, it provided an elaboration of configu- rational disease etiology as applied in particular to seasonal epidemics,  often treated under the “Cold Damage” rubric. While the Inner Canon and  Chao Yuanfang had been concerned with general theories of etiology, Five                                                             30 All of the discussions of these chapters were dominated by configurational  climatic qi etiologies, functional descriptions of pathology, and therapies of  sweating, purging, and needling. Beiji qianjin yaofang, 9.173-175.  31  It was rarely mentioned, and apparently hard to come by.

Despeux argues that in  the Song period this approach came to overshadow an alternative canonical tradi- tion that organizes pathology around the functional Visceral systems.

Although some have dated Five Phases and Six Qi theory as early as the  Han, Catherine Despeux finds scant evidence for its development in  medical theory before the eleventh century.36 Besides the reputed successes  of its practitioners, interest in cosmology in literati circles may have  contributed to the system’s ultimate acceptance.37 For example, the physi- cian Pang Anshi 龐安時 (fl. 1080-1100), famous in part for his associations  with the widely celebrated literati Su Shi (1037-1101 蘇軾) and Huang  Tingjian (1045-1105 黃庭堅 ), incorporated it into his treatise on Cold  Damage disorders.38 Scholar-official Shen Gua 沈括 (1031-1095) also touted  its accuracy and advocated its use in medicine.39    The system achieved official prominence in 1099 when the Director of  Studies in the Imperial Medical Service Liu Wenshu 劉溫舒 presented to  the court his Suwen rushi yunqi lun’ao 素問入式運氣論奧  (Seasonal  Influences as Formalized in the Plain Questions).40 In the Chongning period  (1102-1107) it became an imperial medical examination topic.41 The system  is laid out with diagrams in the first two of the 200 chapters of the                                                             36 Its earliest possible appearance is in the Huangdi neijing suwen, chapters 66-71  and 74. Based on their absence in seventh century editions, and textual differences  with the rest of the work, the Bureau for Editing Medical Treatises editing team  thought these chapters might have been inserted by Wang Bing (c. 710-805) in his  762 edition. A tenth century text develops the system and applies the system to  calendrics, divination, and pharmacotherapy. The theory is absent from tenth- century medical collections in which we would expect to see it if it were current,  and the first texts really developing it as medical theory date to the eleventh  century. Catherine Despeux therefore finds it “prudent to date its development in  the field of medicine to no earlier than the eleventh century.” Despeux (2001), pp.  128-131.    37 Despeux makes this link to the “cosmological speculations of figures such as  Zhou Dunyi (1017-73) and Shao Yong.” Despeux (2001), p. 134. There was also  scepticism of the divinatory or over-deterministic uses of this system among both  literati and physicians. See Despeux (2001), pp. 138-143. On interest in the Song  period in cosmology and divination, and scepticism of the latter, see Smith (1990).  38  For accounts of these and other practitioners of Five Phases and Six Qi  medicine, see Despeux (2001), pp. 135-138.  39 On Shen Gua’s advocacy for this system in medicine, see Despeux (2001), pp.  138-141.

Despeux dates its adoption in the examinations to 1076,  when the Imperial Medical Service was expanded. A treatise on it by Hao Yun was  reported to have been presented to court. However, this Songshi passage dates this  particular examination topic to the Chongning Period.

During the Song, Five Phases and Six Qi  theories, which shared through the Six Qi modalities a strong conceptual  link to Zhang Zhongjing’s seminal work, became the dominant focus of  medical theorization, often under the rubric of Cold Damage. What  motivated so much attention to Cold Damage and related frameworks? As  Asaf Goldschmidt has pointed out, epidemics were a major concern of the  expanding medical relief bureaucracy, and Cold Damage and Five Phases  and Six Qi theories offered canonically-authorized, sophisticated ap- proaches to medicine that would have appealed to scholar-officials and to  physicians such as Liu Wansu who were eager to demonstrate their  erudition.44  Impetus also came from a series of campaigns, undertaken from the  early decades of the Song, to eradicate what officials deemed to be perni- cious southern healing customs, including avoidance of the sick for fear of  contagion and shamanic healing. 45  “Shamans” (wu 巫 ), despite being  granted roles in the official ritual system as late as the Tang, appearing as  romantic or bucolic figures in literature, and continuing to receive  patronage from all levels of society, had also long been anathematized by  advocates of stricter religious or medical orthopraxy. Buddhist and Daoist  proselytizers condemned shamans for their “bloody” animal sacrifices and  for worshipping malevolent spirits. 46  In 225 Emperor Wen of the Wei  kingdom in the north defined shamans as officiants of cults that had not                                                             42 Shengji zonglu, vol. 1, 1-169.  43 Despeux (2001), pp. 143 ff.  44 Goldschmidt (2009), pp. 69-102.  45 The Northern Song especially was notable for a political culture of activism  that drove the expansion of state programs in social reform and in medical relief,  education, and publishing. The two arenas were not unrelated, and they converged  in efforts to culturally integrate the south, then still considered semi-“barbaric,”  through the promotion of medicine. To an important extent, it was not only official  interest in medicine that generated concern over southern customs, but concern  over unifying customs that generated official interest in medicine. For fuller  development of these arguments, see Hinrichs (2003).  46 Stein, (1979); Lin Fu-shih (1994), pp. 29-30, 240-278.  </page> <page sequence="13"> TJ HINRICHS: THE CATCHY EPIDEMIC                                                          31    been included in the official registers.47 In such contexts, “shamans” came  to stand not necessarily for particular types of religious specialists, but for  the antitheses of officials, priests, and physicians. With Song policies to  reform southern healing customs, for the first time official policy treated  shamans as illicit not in their general ritual capacities but in their specific  therapeutic ones.48    Around 1070, on the heels of the Bureau for Editing Medical Treatises’  1066 publication of Zhang Zhongjing’s Shanghan lun, Cold Damage came to  the fore as an officially approved alternative to shamanic healing. Luo Shi  羅適  (1029-1101), the District Defender of Tongcheng in Huainan, found  himself faced with a populace who in their “common customs were  deluded by shamans and did not trust in medicines. 49  He summoned  physicians to consult and collate formularies,” producing Shanghan jiusu  fang 傷寒救俗方 (Formulae on Cold Damage to rescue customs). This he  “engraved on stone in order to rescue misguided customs.”50 Around the  same time, again specifically invoking Cold Damage, Qianzhou (in modern  Jiangxi) Prefect Liu Yi (1015-1091) responded to the problems of local  customs by commissioning the similarly titled Zhengsu fang 正俗方  (Formulae to Correct Customs):  Because [Qian’s] land was near the lower Ling Mountains  and inclines toward the southeast, it has an abundance of  Yang qi, its seasons and weather are unbalanced, and the  people get a lot of epidemic diseases. The folk customs  are ignorant. Because they trust in shamans (wu) and  worship demons, [Liu Yi] gathered together physicians  and made the Zhengsu fang, solely discussing Cold  Damage disorders. He registered all of the shamans  under his jurisdiction, getting over 3,700 people [one  shaman for every 26.5 households].51 He restrained (le 勒)                                                             47 Sanguo zhi, 2.84.  48 For a fuller treatment, see Hinrichs (forthcoming), Shamans, Witchcraft, and  Quarantine, Chapter Four.  49 This would have occurred between Luo Shi’s receipt of the jinshi degree in  1065, and his advancement from district magistrate to higher office in 1075. Luo Shi  was from Ninghai, Tai Prefecture, Liangzhe Circuit, and was also known for his  handling of water works. Chang Bide 昌彼得, et al. (eds.)

Besides commissioning and  distributing medical texts, local officials and the court issued exhortations  to use medicine rather than neglecting ill relatives, banned shamanic  healing, and rounded up shamans and destroyed their shrines. By 1070,  those campaigns were either winding down or had become too common- place to merit a place in official histories.53 Luo Shi’s and Liu Yi’s Cold  Damage-focused interventions stood out, and perhaps therefore merited  recording, for their specific deployment of Cold Damage medicine.  The nature of Cold Damage’s oppositional utility against southern  healing customs was left unexplained, perhaps because, for historians, it  was too obvious. A century later, though under the Southern Song (1127- 1279), the medical issues became the focus of analysis and debate. It was a  time when officials were intervening less in local lives, and in the arena of  social reform elites were turning their energies increasingly to sub-official  local efforts. Concerns over southern customs continued, but as an object of  literati debate and gentry activism. Cheng Jiong 程迥  (jinshi 1163) 54  produced an entire treatise, Yijing zhengben shu 醫經正本書 (Book on the  Correct Foundations of the Medical Canons, 1176), whose central concern  was with the “rustic customs of Jiangnan” where “they trust in shamans  and do not trust in physicians. Relatives abandon [the sick for fear of  demonic contagion], and many die.”55 He contrasted this situation with the  north (for Cheng a nostalgic maneuver; the north then being ruled by the                                                             52 Duxing zazhi, 3.23-24.

Zhu Xi, who  also corresponded with Cheng regarding interpretations of the Yijing, rejected  Cheng’s arguments against contagion. Rather, Zhu reasoned that if you want  people to change their customs, if you deny contagion, which clearly does exist, no  one will listen to you. Rather, you should acknowledge contagion, but persuade  people to behave morally (care for their sick relatives) despite it. Huian wenji,  71.16b-17.

Human life is of the utmost value. How is it that people  disrespect it to the point that they put the whole world in  error, injure mores, corrupt customs, and sever people’s  allotted life spans? And yet physicians hang their heads  and comply, none daring to point out where people are  wrong, as when relatives are critically ill and people  wildly call it contagion (chuanran 傳染), then abandon  each other and sever ties. The ancients did not have this.  The medical canons do not speak of it.57  Most of the text consisted of arguments against contagion, pitting against it  the view that epidemics were best understood in the framework of Five  Phases and Six Qi, and were caused by injury from Cold or from unsea- sonal qi.58    For Cheng Jiong, and presumably for Luo Shi and Liu Yi, functional- configurational medicine was a powerful alternative to shamanic healing,  to demonic etiology, and to contagion. What made it so?—By locating the  source of epidemics in climatic conditions, it denied the agency of demons,  the utility of shamans, and the danger of sick bodies. From the perspective  of the imperial bureaucratic state and the ideologies that tied literati elites  to it, configurational views of epidemics were furthermore useful for rising  above the particularities of local spirits, healers, and diseases, offering a  larger cosmological framework that conceptually integrated the empire.  Nevertheless, as Cheng would find to his chagrin, if contagion was  absent from ancient medical canons, it was not from more recent medical  writings, specifically  those sections on avoiding Warmth which speak of  people avoiding contagion (ran 染) from Warmth disor- ders. It is only that they do not make contact with the  [epidemic’s] deviant qi.

Why would Warmth represent such a radically different view of epi- demics, an ontologically distinct disease to be avoided and one that  spreads by contamination? How did Warmth become disconnected from  climatic Warmth Qi?   Ontological Factors  From early times, the very language of epidemics (when not subsumed  under seasonal disorders) contained associations with demonic agency.  The Shiming (Explanation of Names, c. 200 AD) interpreted the etymology  of the character for epidemic (yi 疫) as deriving from the character for  soldiers (yi 役 ), “referring to there being demons spreading (xing 行 )  epidemics (yi).60 Another term for epidemics was li 癘, often compounded  with yi as in yili 疫癘 or liyi 癘疫. The graph written with a cliff radical 厲  instead of disease radical meant “violent,” “fierce,” or “harsh,” and was  used to identify “violent demons” (ligui 厲鬼) who spread epidemics in  order to coerce the living into caring for them with sacrifices. They were  often the ghosts of those who died in epidemics and they inflicted the same  until they were appeased.61 Chao Yuanfang explicitly linked pestilence to  such demons, writing, “In diseases that [strike] both adults and children at  similar rates, if there is the qi of demonic violence (guili 鬼厲 ), it is  accordingly called pestilential (yili 疫癘) disease.”62  A term commonly used since the Han to describe the spread of epi- demics was “flowing and moving” (liuxing 流行). “Moving” or “spreading”  (xing) often had an intransitive and neutral sense, but could also function  transitively, as in the Shiming account of “epidemic” (yi), and was used  specifically to refer to demons carrying out celestial mandates to spread  epidemics. 63  The term appeared in discussions of “Seasonally Spread”  (shixing) and “Heaven Spread” (tianxing 天行) disorders in a naturalistic,                                                             59 Yijing zhengben shu, 11-12.  60 Lee (1993a), p. 419; Lin Fushih (1988), p. 116.  61 Katz (1995), p. 58. Katz translates ligui as “vengeful demons.”  62 Zhubing yuanhou lun, 10.334.  63 Lee (1993a), p. 421; Lee (1995), p. 374.  </page> <page sequence="17"> TJ HINRICHS: THE CATCHY EPIDEMIC                                                          35    non-anthropomorphic sense.64 In Daoist texts, though, Heaven Spread was  the more common usage, and clearly referred to epidemics spread by  demons carrying out a Heavenly mandate. 65  Despite its literate Daoist  credentials, though, by the twelfth or thirteenth century the term “Heaven  Spread” was also ascribed to shamans, as by Chen Fu (1076-after 1149) who  complained about popular employment of shamans to pray in times of  epidemics, “vulgarly called Heaven-Spread.”66   Medical writings, as we have seen, attributed epidemics to external  climatic qi, but they also ascribed them to ontologically distinct things that  entered the body and caused disease. As in configurational accounts, the  agents that caused disease were often described as “noxious” (xie), and  both climatic noxious qi and noxious entities damaged the body by enter- ing it, but when contagion was at issue, it was in an ontological framework  of disease, not a functional one. In medical texts, where the ways in which  demons act on the body were described, these tended to come in four  major forms: 1) striking or attacking (zhong 中), as in Strikes by Malignant  Agencies (zhonge 中惡); 2) lodging or violation (ke 客), as in Lodging by  Recalcitrant Agencies (kewu 客忤); 3) Infestation (zhu 注, 疰) by demons  which could take form as worms and gnaw the viscera; and 4) encounters  with demons in dreams, which happened when the Yang soul wandered,67  including sexual relations with spirits that lead to the exhaustion of the qi.68                                                               64 The two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Some versions of the  Xiaopin fang give “Seasonally Spread,” others “Heaven Spread.” It gives a social  explanation for differences in usage: “Cold Damage is the term of refined gentle- men; Heaven Spread and Warmth Epidemics are the way it is called in the fields  and in homes. They do not speak of the differences and similarities in these dis- orders.” Xiaopin fang xinji, 60. Sun Simiao likewise alternates between the two in his  quote of Formulae with short articles with regard to Cold Damage disorders. Beiji  qianjin yaofang, 9. 171. The Waitai miyao version of this passage has “Heaven- Spread” in place of “Seasonally Spread.” See Xiaopin fang xinji, 60. Although the  annotator Zhu Xinnian found “Seasonal” and not “Heaven” in Beiji qianjin yaofang,  the Song-edition based text published by Renmin weisheng gives “Heaven-Spread”  at a different point.    65 See examples in Lee (1993a); Lee (1995).

Demons and  ghosts (gui 鬼) could be inherently noxious and Yin, or only contingently so  in relation to spirits and deities (shen 神 ) who were properly ritually  situated and Yang. Chong was a category that could be used to refer to  animals generally, but more commonly included arthropods, reptiles,  amphibians, and mollusks.69 As used in medical contexts, scholars often  translate chong as “worms,” although depictions take on a wide range of  forms, including worms, insects, mammals, anthropomorphs, and mon- strous hybrids.70 Foul effluvia could arise from the bodies of the sick, from  corpses, from filth, from blocked waterways, or from certain landscapes. In  contrast to cosmologically rationalized climatic or generic noxious qi, texts  did not recommend responding to these dangerous things by harmonizing  them, but by avoiding, expelling, or destroying them. For practical pur- poses, demons, worms, and effluvia were treated as things, noxious in and  of themselves.    What were disease-causing demons? Like the correctness or noxious- ness of qi in functional medicine, this could be contingent on circumstances.  A dead person could be a spirit (shen 神) to their family and a ghost/  demon (gui 鬼) to people outside the family. People who were not success- fully installed on their ancestral shrines, for example who died violent  deaths or away from home, could become dangerous “vengeful ghosts.”  Behaving much like criminals in human society, such demonic former  people could wreak havoc on human communities. As a means to neutral- izing these destructive beings, especially when they could not be controlled  by exorcism, they could also be transformed: enshrined, deified, and  enlisted in the protection of their worshippers. 71  Many demon-quelling  deities began as demons before their own conversion. 72 In many cases,                                                             69 Harper (1998), p. 74; Fèvre (1993); Sterckx (2002), pp. 31, 90.    70 Another translation is “vermin,” which traces to Latin vermis “worm,” like  chong has a somewhat indefinite range of animal referents, and connotes creatures  that are destructive, injurious, or loathsome. Maspero uses “vermin” to render the  nine “common intestinal worms” (jiuchong 九蟲) and uses alternately “Worms” and  “Corpses” for the internal demonic spirits that other scholars of Daoism usually  translate as the “Three Corpse Worms” (sanshi, sanshichong, sanchong 三屍,三屍  蟲,三蟲). See Maspero (1981), pp. 331-338.  71 Lin Fu-shih (1994), pp. 127-132.  72 This is the case, for example, for the plague-suppressing god Marshal Wen.  See Katz (1995), pp. 77-116.

Some demons operated as part of the Celestial order and administered  epidemics as retribution for misdeeds which must be atoned. Medieval  Daoist priests would respond by petitioning the appropriate celestial  authorities for remission.73 On the other hand, some demons did appear to  be irremediably demonic, and required more violent approaches. Some of  them were not former people and were depicted as bestial entities. 74  Restoring them to the side of order and human society was often a matter  of subjugating them.  Some categories of bestial demons, however, were so  far beyond the possibility of social control that expelling and destroying  were the only options.   While the spirit realm was ordinarily understood as lying outside  normal human perception, the distinctions between material creatures and  immaterial demons was not always clear. One characteristic of demonic or  spiritual potency was the capacity for transforming, manifesting, or  moving between realms.75 Fox and raccoon spirits were known for their  ability to transform between animal and human form. Some demons could  also take form as worms,76 or could be smelled and even seen as foul- smelling effluvia. Demons, worms, and stench populated not only the  outer landscape, but the inner (bodily) landscape as well. To the danger of  human hosts, they could communicate and move between the two.  The slippage among these categories of being, among demons, crea- tures, and airs, suggests how they might, theoretically, be reconciled with  functional cosmologies.77 In the practical exigencies of affliction, however,  they were treated as inherently noxious and discrete entities. They were  not patterns to be harmonized or regulated, or depleted functional systems  or qi to be replenished. They were things to be avoided, guarded against,  and expelled. They were also things that could be imagined as transmitting  not only from place to person, but from person to person.

When diseases were contagious, they were envisioned and experienced not  as functional irregularities in qi resonating between people, but as ontologi- cally discrete entities—demons, worms, or effluvia—passing from body to  body. In some cases, there was even a clear sense of the transmitted thing  being quantifiable:78 Infestation, produced by demons and demonic worms,  was more virulent when it was received from a dead person than from a  living person, because in the former case the demonic migration was more  complete.79 Noxious disease fumes passed among cattle until those fumes  were “used up and after that it stops.”80 Leprosy passed out of one person  into another.81    Warmth  While Warmth appeared in functional-configurational frameworks as a  feature of climate, some medical works also granted it demonic agency and  the potential for contagion. As we saw above, Chao Yuanfang worked  mainly in a functional-configurational tradition of understanding epide- mics. Despite this, the very last item in his sections on Cold Damage,  Seasonal Qi, and Warmth Disorders each concerns “making it not transmit  to others” (ling buxiang ranyi 令不相染易).82  The inclusion of contagion  suggests that Chao accepted that epidemics could in some cases be conta- gious, its marginality suggests that he saw it as the less important or even  an embarrassment to his functional configurational accounts.  In the case of Cold Damage disorders, Chao included a section on  contagion only to clarify that they were not contagious.                                                              78 For more on these other contagious categories, see Hinrichs (2003), Chapter 6.  79 Wushang xuanyuan santian yutang dafa, 23.6.    80 Nongshu, 2.5b.  81 Guixin zashi, 81.  82  In each of these three sections, two or three items before this last is a  discussion of transmission during sexual intercourse.

If,  because the seasons are inharmonious, with warmth and  coolness losing their regularity, people are affected (gan  感) by perverse (guaili 乖戾) qi and become ill, this then  will often contaminate others. Thus one should take  medicine in advance and take measures to prevent it.83  Cold Damage disorders were contracted when Cold occurred when it is  supposed to, in winter, and were not contagious. It was when climatic qi  was out of phase with the normative progression of the seasons, as was  characteristic of Seasonally Spread or Seasonal Qi disorders, that contagion  was possible. Even here, Chao did not describe the qi by which people were  affected in these cases as irregular (buzheng 不正) or noxious (xie 邪), the  more common antipodes to correct (zheng 正 ) qi in the language of  functional medicine, but with the sharper qualifier “perverse” (guaili乖戾).   If Cold Damage stood out for its non-contagion, Warmth stood out for  its exceptional contagiousness—not when it appeared as a manifestation of  dormant Cold Damage, its defining feature in Chao’s nosology, but when it  emerged from the “perverse” (guaili) Seasonal Qi pattern of seasonal  irregularity.  [As for Warmth Disorders], these are all due to dishar- mony in the seasons, and warmth and coolness losing  their regularity.  People are affected (gan 感) by perverse  (guaili) qi and become ill. Then the disease qi transmits to  and contaminates others (zhuanxiang ranyi 染易), culmi- nating in the destruction of the family (miemen 滅門) and  extending to outsiders. Thus one should take medicine in  advance and take measures to prevent it.84  Thus, while Chao pointedly refused to accommodate the idea of contagion  in the case of Cold Damage, he seemed to feel compelled to make room for  Warmth Disorder’s potential for contagion, but at the same time preserving  some distinction between configurational and contamination modalities by  producing an alternate etiological explanation.   In a clearer gesture toward ontological-contamination frameworks, by  making “destruction of the family line” (miemen) one of the characteristics                                                             83 Zhubing yuanhou lun jiaozhu, 8.277.

Cold Damage, Seasonally Spread, and Warmth Epidemics  (wenyi) are three names for one type [of disorder].  Fundamentally, they are [only] slightly different. Those  cases in which there is injury by Cold in the winter  months, sometimes spreading rapidly and acting strongly;  breaking out in sweat and getting Wind-Cold; and  breaking out [in illness] when summer comes—these are  called Cold Damage. Those cases in which in the winter  months it is not very cold, and there is a lot of Warmth qi  to the extent that the four winds make people’s bones and  joints become slack and get ill; and when spring comes it  breaks out—these are called Seasonally Spread. In those  cases in which during the year there is pestilential (li) qi  that combines with demon-toxin and Infestation—these  are called Warmth diseases. If it is any of these, on  examination the symptoms [of different patients] resem- ble each other. In the refined speech of the eminent and  powerful, they are sweepingly called Cold Damage. It is  the popular custom to call them Seasonally Spread. The  exorcistic talismans of Daoist techniques speak of the Five  Warmth-[Demons].86                                                              85 The term “destruction of the family line” (miemen) derived from a category of  legal punishment (criminal responsibility in some cases extended to relatives). The  punishment was adapted in Daoist juridical frameworks, and was sometimes  envisioned as being carried out by demons. On the Qin-Han legal principle of  destruction of the lineage on which miemen is thought to have been based, see  Lewis (1990), pp. 91-94. On the extension of punishment to the family in sepulchral  plaints in early medieval Daoism, see Strickmann, pp. 10-23; Bokenkamp, pp. 56-58,  111-118, 130-138; Katz (2009), pp. 34-35.

While Chao  hints at a link with demonic Infestation through the language “destruction  of family,” Ge made this link explicit. Finally, Ge went further than this. He  reported that these terms, which might be distinguished technically, were  used generically by different social groups for epidemics, in which “on  examination the symptoms [of different patients] resemble each other.”87  Warmth as used in Daoist exorcistic talismans is not Warmth Qi or a  manifestation of Cold Qi injury, but ontologically noxious, pestilential (li),  demonic, and infestatious. This is born out in Daoist texts, where we find  the epidemic-spreading “Five Warmth Demons.”88   Where medical texts treat Warmth as demonic and ontological rather  than as a variety of Seasonal Qi, they continue to show evidence of  derivation from Daoist traditions. Chao Yuanfang, who had taken such  care to place Warmth in a functional framework, when admitting its  potential for contagion, linked it to demonic epidemics. He followed his  section on Warmth with one on “Pestilence” (yili), in which he distin- guished the various seasonal disorders that were often epidemic among the  people from pestilential diseases caused by demons. Here he quoted a  nurturing life (yangsheng 養生) text’s method for extending years that will  allow one to “avoid noxious demons,” “avoid and eliminate the masses of  noxious [agents] and the hundred demons,” make it so that the “hundred  noxious [agents] dare not invade you, and you can thereby go into the  midst of a Warmth Epidemic”—presumably without catching it.89  Chao Yuanfang seems to have taken a commonly recognized type of  epidemic, generally understood to be caused by demons, and partially  fitted it into a functional-configurational framework. He did not entirely  omit, though, traces of Daoist and demonic understandings, producing  discrepancies with the switch from Cold Damage to Seasonal Qi etiology,  the introduction of language usually associated with Infestation, and the  link between Warmth Epidemics and demonic pestilence. Chao’s work was  a starting point for many later authors’ definitions of disease, and they did                                                                                                                                         were originally annotations by Tao Hongjing (456-536). Which belong to Ge Hong’s  original text and which were added by Tao Hongjing is often no longer clear.  87 A similar social distinction is also reported by Xiaopin fang, some versions of  which give “Seasonally Spread,” others “Heaven Spread:” “Cold Damage is the  term of refined gentlemen; Heavenly Spread and Warmth Epidemics are the way it  is called in the fields and in homes. They do not speak of the differences and  similarities in these disorders.” Xiaopin fang xinji, 60.

Despite minor inconsistencies, we find a strong authorial voice and  overall theoretical consistency in Chao’s Zhubing yuanhou lun. Sun Simiao  on the other hand seems to have been more interested in including multi- ple perspectives and approaches to treatment. He quoted widely from  other sources, and did not bother to reconcile theoretical differences, which  were particularly marked in the completely different styles of medicine he  brought to bear in therapies for Cold Damage and Warmth disorders.  Sun followed his general functional-configurational theoretical intro- duction to Cold Damage disorders with a subsection devoted to formulae  for “Avoiding Warmth.” In the introduction, he quoted Xiaopin fang, which  attributed Warmth Disorders to injury by Cold in winter. While from this  we might anticipate that “avoiding Warmth” would entail “keeping oneself  firmly closed in” in the winter,90 the Avoiding Warmth section consisted  predominantly of methods for “avoiding epidemic qi,” “avoiding Warmth  Diseases,” killing demons, and breaking the line of transmission and  contamination of Warmth Epidemics, which otherwise then “culminate in  the destruction of the family line (miemen) and extend to outsiders.” The  term “avoid” (bi 辟,避) itself was traditionally used to refer to methods  for warding off demons.91 Accordingly, the formulae in this section were  concerned with avoiding Warmth, Epidemic Qi, and demons.92    Besides the descriptive language of “avoiding” and “demons,” many of  the formulas themselves were clearly apotropaic. There were several cases  of protection against or expulsion of noxious entities or qi from bodies,  homes, and wells. Bags of medicines were hung in or on doorways,  windows, walls, or bodies or were dropped into wells; medicines were  used to fumigate homes and courtyards as well as ingested; and noses and  ears were smeared with medicines. The formulas contained numerous  ritual or magical elements, such as facing east at dawn and reciting  incantations, and measuring the circumference of the house with a rope  and then cutting it.  Some specified performance on New Year’s morning, a  significant time in the ritual calendar for cleansing away and exorcising the  previous year’s demons.93 The medicine itself was sometimes described as                                                             90 Xiaopin fang xinji, 60; Beiji qianjin yaofang, 9.173.  91 Lin Fu-shih (1988), pp. 131-132.  92 Beiji qianjin yaofang, juan 9-10, passim.   93  See translation in Appendix 5, “Prescriptions for Avoiding Warmth and  Contagion From Sun Simiao’s Beiji qianjin yaofang and Pang Anshi’s Shanghan  zongbing lun,” in Hinrichs (2003), pp. 283-301.  </page> <page sequence="25"> TJ HINRICHS: THE CATCHY EPIDEMIC                                                          43    possessing a type of anti-demonic power, as in Sun’s introduction to  “Formula for Realgar Pills:”   In the 2nd Year of the Jianning period in the Han (169 AD),  Jupiter was in the you 酉 position. Epidemic qi spread,  and multitudes of people died. There was a young adult  student, Li Hui 李迴, who was coming from Qingcheng  Mountain in Shu (Sichuan). To the east he passed through  Nanyang [in Henan], entering from the West Market Gate.  He saw that there were rather many people suffering  from pestilence (yili), and thereupon took some medicine  from out of his bag.  He bestowed on each one pill. When  its efficacious numinosity (ling 靈) wet their lips, there  was no illness that was not cured.  When the epidemic demons (yigui) in the marketplace,  numbering in the hundreds and thousands, saw the  student distributing medicines, they all became fright- ened and ran away. There was a Demon King who saw  the student, and said that he must have the Law (or Rites)  of the Dao (daofa 道法)94 [since] when he distributed the  medicine it both affected (gan) the populace and the  demons fled the way they did. Thereupon he made a visit  to the student seeking to receive his Law of the Dao. The  student said, “I have no Law of the Dao, but only the  medicine in my bag.” He presented this to the Demon  King, but when the Demon King looked at the medicine  he kowtowed in alarm, begged for his life, and ran away.  Wear this medicine, and when you go into the  mountains, you will be able to avoid tigers, wolves,  insects, and snakes. When you go into the water you will  be able to repel water monsters, jiao-dragons (蛟), and  shen sea creatures (蜃).95  The medicines prescribed also featured drugs regularly used against  demons and worms but not Cold Damage disorders.  Realgar (xionghuang  雄黃), featured in the formula above, appeared in seven of Sun’s Avoiding  Warmth formulas. 96  At least as early as the first century it had been                                                             94 Also referring to Daoist ritual.  95 Beiji qianjin yaofang, 9.176.  96  See Appendix 5: “Prescription for Grand Unity Molten Metal Powder,”  “Prescription for Realgar Powder,” “Prescription for Roasted Medicines” “Prescrip- tion for Tiger’s Head Demon-Killing Pills,” “Avoiding Warmth and Killing Demon    </page> <page sequence="26"> 44                                                                                                  EASTM 41 (2015)    recommended for killing sprites (jingwu 精物), malevolent demons (egui 惡 鬼), and noxious qi. In the fifth century it appeared in a text for Demonic  Infestation (guizhu 鬼注). It was also recommended for use in amulets to  “put dangerous animals to flight and to destroy the venom of poisonous  snakes.”97 In his Qianjin yifang 千金翼方, where he lists drugs and their  properties, Sun Simiao wrote that realgar “resolved ... Strikes by Malignant  Agencies (zhonge), ... and demonic possession; and killing spirits,  malevolent demons, noxious qi, and the toxins of the hundred gu (baigudu  百蠱毒).”98 During the Dragon Boat Festival in modern Taiwan, realgar  liquor has been both sprinkled around the outside of homes and ingested  to ward off noxious creatures.99   One of the first major Song treatises on Cold Damage Disorders, Pang  Anshi’s 龐安時 Shanghan zongbing lun 傷寒總病論 (Comprehensive Treatise  on Cold Damage Disorders, before 1100), while elaborating functional- configurational frameworks, followed Sun’s lead by inserting a subsection  of remedies for “Avoiding Warmth,” much of it copied from Sun’s Qianjin  fang, and like Sun without any attempt to reconcile it theoretically with the  climatic explanations that preceded it.100 Pang also employed realgar as an  apotropaic, and showed evidence of links to Daoist traditions, as in the  following remedy:  Grind high quality realgar (xionghuang 雄黃) with water.  Use a writing brush to dip up a thick dollop [of realgar]  and smear it inside the nostrils. Then epidemic qi will be  unable to enter, and [even if] you share a bed with a sick  person it will still not transmit (xiangran 相染). At the                                                                                                                                         Pills,” “Prescription for Realgar Pills,” “Prescription for breaking off transmission  and contamination by Warmth Epidemics.” These also appear in Taiping shenghui  fang, Shanghan zongbing lun, and Shengji zonglu.  97 Obringer (2001), pp. 194-195, 202-203; Obringer (1997), pp. 77-80.  98 Qianjin yifang, 3.16. To take just one other example, Cinnabar also appears  frequently. Among its applications, Sun lists “killing sprites (jingmei 精魅) and  noxious and malignant demons (xieegui 邪惡鬼), and expelling (chu 除) stomach  aches from strikes by malignant agencies.” As we expect given its association with  cultivating vitality and transcendence, Sun lists constructive uses as well, such as  cultivating the seminal essence and spirit (jingshen 精神), calming the Yang and Yin  souls, and increasing the qi.

In general, the  homes of those stricken with Warmth Epidemics of  themselves generate noisome and foul (chouhui 臭穢) qi.  When people smell this qi [they should] immediately use  a strip of paper to probe the inside of their nose. If they  sneeze it [out] it is good.  Otherwise the noxious qi will  enter the “Higher Origin Palace” (shangyuangong 上元宮)  and form this disease. If you use realgar to daub it, then  because you do not smell this qi, you will additionally  avoid the various malignant agencies and monstrous  dreams [i.e., demons].102  The “Higher Origin Palace” corresponds to the brain and upper Cinnabar  Field, which have a central role in Daoist physiology and self-cultivation  but none (ordinarily) in functional medicine.103    Besides continuing to appear in “Avoiding Warmth” sections of medical  works, in the Song the ideograph for Warmth, wen 溫, came to appear more  often with its water radical swapped for a disease radical 瘟, referring more  generally to virulent epidemics, or plagues. 104  The “Plague Gods” that                                                             101 Around 4 a.m.  102  Shanghan zongbing lun, 5.123-124. This passage came under particular  criticism from Cheng Jiong in his arguments against contagion. Ironically, Chen  Yan, who also quoted this remedy (Sanyin fang, 6.6b), provided a postface to Cheng  Jiong’s Yijing zhengben shu.  103 Liu Wenshu, famous for his successful promotion of Five Phases and Six Qi  theory to the court in 1099, described a similar mechanism for contagion, toxic qi  entering through the nose into the brain. Although he did not identify this specifi- cally with Warmth or with demons, he did give instructions such as the following:  [Quoting from a “lost chapter” of the Suwen, considered apocryphal]: “If you want  to enter the chamber [of someone sick with] an epidemic, beforehand imagine green  qi coming out of the Liver and moving leftwards to the East and transforming (hua)  and making (zuo) trees.” “Lost Tract,” Suwen rushi yunqi lun’ao, 29-31. The text  continues with instructions for subsequently imagining the other Phase-associated  colors issuing from the Phase-correlated Viscera, moving in the Phase-matched  directions and transforming into Phase-fitting things. Catherine Despeux argues  that Five Phases Six Qi theory was developed in a Daoist milieu, and such  visualization techniques and an emphasis on the role of the Brain do suggest such a  connection.  104  Lee (1993a), pp. 423-425. Current recensions of Ge Hong’s work also  distinguish the graphs in this way.  Plague here is to be taken in the sense of a general, pestilential affliction, often  implying something infectious. It is not to imply any association with the specific  disease of bubonic plague, often referred to as The Plague.      </page> <page sequence="28"> 46                                                                                                  EASTM 41 (2015)    began to spread in the Song period were written with the latter graph.105  The two usages appeared in conjunction, making clear their references to  different understandings of etiology, in the Southern Song physician Chen  Yan’s “Brief overview of the various epidemics and their patterns and  treatments.” Here, Warmth 溫 was one epidemic configuration:   In general, before the vernal equinox and after the  autumnal equinox, the qi of Heaven accords with Clear  and Cool [weather]. If suddenly you have Warmth qi  breaking in, then the people will be ill with Warmth  Epidemics (wenyi 溫疫). After the vernal equinox and  before the autumnal equinox, the qi of heaven accords  with Heat. If suddenly you have Clear and Cool qi  breaking in, then the people will be ill with Cold  Epidemics. ...   Following this, Chen detailed a rich variety of plague 瘟 types which he  associated with specific places, fitting a demonic and more generally  ontological view of etiology:  That which establishes an epidemic (yi), might be ditches  not flowing, accumulating their filth, and this fuming up  and forming [epidemic qi]. It might be that the land has a  lot of death-qi, which is blocked and then erupts and  forms [epidemic qi]. It might be that the officials and  clerks are corrupt and oppressive, making grievances and  slander which forms [epidemic qi]. Today these are called  Prison Plague (yuwen 獄瘟), Injury Plague (shangwen 傷 瘟), Grave Plague (muwen 墓瘟), Temple Plague (miaowen  廟瘟 ), Shrine Plague (shewen 社瘟 ), Mountain Plague  (shanwen 山瘟), Sea Plague (haiwen 海瘟), Home Plague  (jiawen 家瘟), Stove Plague (zaowen 竈瘟), Harvest Plague  (suiwen 歲瘟), Heaven Plague (tianwen 天瘟), Earth Plague  (diwen 地瘟), and so forth. You must not fail to investigate  [their origins].106  These varieties were associated with places prone to the particular dangers  of blockage or demonic attack: sacred precincts; remote areas; domestic                                                                                                                                         For more on various plague god cults and their spread in southern China from  at least the Song period, see Katz (1995).  105 On the spread of cults to the Five Plague Gods, see Lee (1995), pp. 391 ff; Katz  (1995).  106 (Chen Wuze) Sanyinfang, 6.4b-5a.  </page> <page sequence="29"> TJ HINRICHS: THE CATCHY EPIDEMIC                                                          47    spaces; stagnating filth producing noxious fumes; and the moral  obstruction of governmental injustice accumulating airs of grievance  around prisons.107   Theoretical Rigor and its Limits  As the naturalistic Yin-Yang and Five Phase cosmologies that underlay and  powerfully integrated imperial ideology, medical theory, and religious  practice gradually spread from the Han period on, the contradictions  between functional-configurational and ontological-contaminationist  frameworks became evident but were often ignored. Sometimes, as in the  case of Ge Hong and Chen Fu, the different frameworks were tied to social  class.  Cao Zhi 曹植 (192-232)108 attributed demonic views of epidemics in  general to the benighted poor.  In 217 pestilential qi was spreading, and every family  suffered [the proliferation of their relatives’] stiff corpses.  In every room there was the sorrow of wailing tears.  Some closed their doors and died. Some clans were  mourned for their annihilation. Some [people] took it to  be epidemics carried out by demons and spirits.    Now, of those so stricken, all are sons who dress  coarsely and eat rough food, people who live in thorn  huts and mugwort-woven shacks. It is rare among those  families who live in palaces and eat from ding-vessels,  and households with piles of sable and layers of bed-mats.  When Yin and Yang losing their positions, when Cold  and Summer-Heat cross the seasons—it is for this reason  that epidemics arise. But the deluded people hang  talismans and perform exorcisms. It is ridiculous.109  The class distinction is born out in the decline between the Han and the  Song of customs such as the exorcistic nuo 儺 festival and the employment  of shamans for healing at court and among elites.110  Despite occasional derision and the posing of functional-configurational  models as alternatives, though, disease-spreading demons remained prom- inent objects of fear across the social spectrum. From early times we find                                                             107 For analyses of demonic dangers associated with particular places, see Liao  Hsien-huei (2007); Li Jianmin (1994).  108  Famous poet and younger brother of Cao Pei, Cao Cao’s successor and  founder of the Wei Dynasty.  109 Caoji quanping 曹集詮評, 9.66-67.  110 Bodde (1975), pp. 75-138; Nakamura (1992), p. 85.    </page> <page sequence="30"> 48                                                                                                  EASTM 41 (2015)    records, not only at the popular level but in elite society, of epidemics  treated and prevented by wearing or imbibing protective talismans or  demon-expelling medicines, exorcisms and exorcistic festivals, and the  shunning of people or areas stricken with epidemics. Shamans and plague  god festivals remained vital and prevalent at the local level through the rest  of the imperial period and even today.111  During the Song period, when officials were deploying Cold Damage  texts to combat shamanic healing, Daoist exorcists were also popular  among elites, talismanic treatments retained a department in the imperial  medical curriculum, and prominent medical writers and government  bureaus included treatments for demonic ailments in their formularies.112  The imperially compiled Comprehensive record of Sagely beneficence (1118)  advised:  For methods of treatment [of Demonic Intermittent  Fevers (guinüe 鬼 瘧 )] it is appropriate to perform  exorcistic sacrifices to expel [the demonic noxious agents  (guixie 鬼邪)], and together with that take decoctions for                                                             111 In a very few records, we find policies or policy proposals that reflect a  recognition of contagion as a real danger, and quarantine as a judicious response.  State-run hospitals were, in at least one policy document, ordered to set aside  quarantine wards specifically to prevent contagion. During epidemics in 1181 and  in 1187 official travel bans were ordered for the Southern Song capital of Lin’an  (modern Hangzhou), presumably in this case to keep the disease from spreading  through interpersonal transmission. On quarantine wards, see Song huiyao jigao 宋 會要輯稿, discussed in Goldschmidt (2009), p. 64. For records of the two travel bans,  which were gleaned from local gazetteers, see Imura Kōzen (1936), p. 271.   Contagion among cattle may have provoked less controversy. Although “filial”  behavior among cows was used in the Song as evidence that Filial Devotion was a  universal Coherent Principle (li 理), for literati cattle quarantine does not seem to  have triggered the intense moral reaction that it did among humans. On contagion  among cattle, see Nongshu. On bans on cattle trading during disease outbreaks, see  Shiba Yoshinobu (1970), p. 98.  On apotropaic and exorcistic treatments and festivals, see, for example, Harper  (1998); Bodde (1975), pp. 302-316, 387-395; Lin (1988), pp. 115-118; Lee (1993a), pp.  420-421; Katz (1995); Benedict (1996), pp. 100-130; Szonyi (1997); Johnson (1989).  While some of these works mention the continuation of these practices in the  twentieth century, the following focus on it: Lin Fu-shih (1995b); Guo Jing 郭凈  (1993); Lee (1993b); Gould-Martin (1975).  112 See, for example, Davis (2001), p. 17; the talismans in Shengji zonglu (1118),  juan 195-197.

It is appropriate  to use apotropaic and exorcistic methods (jinbi yanrang zhi  fa 禁避厭禳之法).114  We are not looking, then, at official or elite consensus.  The impression that medical works sometimes appeared to uphold  Cheng Jiong’s ideals and advocate a rigorous functional-configurational  approach, may have been an artifact of context. The Song did see an  outpouring of treatises on Cold Damage that eschewed mention of  contagion and “Avoiding Warmth”—books that took Zhang Zhongjing’s  contagion-free Shanghan lun and Five Phases and Six Qi theory—not Chao  Yuanfang’s comprehensive nosology, not Sun Simiao’s eclectic therapies,  and not state pharmacopeias’ encyclopedic ambitions, as their starting  points. If contagion and Warmth did not fit the narrower theoretical  enterprise, this does not mean that they were neglected medically even by  the same authors. We have already discussed the appearance of Avoiding  Warmth in the theoretical works of Pang Anshi and Chen Yan. Liu  Wenshu, famous for successfully promoting Five Phases and Six Qi at  court, did not discuss contagion in his theoretical writings, but did in his  comments to an appended apocryphal “lost tract” from the Suwen.115 The  literatus medical writer Xu Shuwei 許叔微  (1080-1160) 116  developed  functional-configurational theories in his works on Cold Damage, where he  did not mention contagion, but gave accounts of and treatments for  “Various Worm, Flying Corpse, and Demonic Infestation” diseases and  demonic or ghostly visitations in his formulary, Puji benshi fang 普濟本事方                                                             113 Shengji zonglu, vol.

Medicine is, after all, a practical discipline, and does not lend itself to  theoretical reductionism.   That said, medical writers and Song officials, if they did not go so far as  Cheng Jiong in calling for rigorous confinement to canon-based Cold  Damage models, did give that approach to medicine priority and promi- nence over demonic Warmth and contagion. Luo Shi and Liu Yi did pit  “Cold Damage” against shamanic healing. What provoked the growing  antagonism between functional-configurational and ontological-contami- nationist medicine? What made their polarity more obvious, and commit- ments to the former stronger?  The eleventh century saw the conjunction of the new availability of the  hitherto obscure Shanghan lun of Zhang Zhongjing, the appearance of a  new system for calculating and predicting the climatic configurations that  engendered epidemics and guided their treatment, and the coincidence of  the dominance of the Three Yin and Three Yang modalities in both the  classical text and the new cosmology. The Song’s expansions of its bureau- cracies for editing and publishing medical texts, as well as for medical  education and medical relief, provided venues for the circulation of these  texts and thereby opportunities for building on them in theory and in  practice.118 Campaigns against southern shamans and quarantine, begun as  early as the 960s, clearly brought attention to the contradictions between  functional-configurational and ontological-contaminationist medicine, and  motivated officials and literati to promote the former against the latter. Put  another way, functional-configurational approaches provided a resource  for those who would reform southern customs, or would dispute conta- gion, or would seek non-apotropaic non-exorcistic non-sick-avoiding  means for treating epidemics.  Functional-configurational medicine also spoke to a view of the cosmos,  of the person, and of disease that would have been congenial to officials  and to elites with predilections for a holistic organic universe, and for  minimizing the heterogeneity of the empire. Configurational theories  reduced diverse disease manifestations to factors of climatic variation in  temperature and dampness, to a numerical cosmology; ontological factors  such as Warmth and Plague demons came in a profusion of local peculiari- ties and individual personalities. Five Phases and Six Qi theory also                                                             117  Puji benshi fang, 6.89, 7.94-103, 8.112-113; Xu Shuwei Shanghan lun zhu  sanzhong, passim.    118 See Hinrichs (2011), pp. 217-238.  </page> <page sequence="33"> TJ HINRICHS: THE CATCHY EPIDEMIC                                                          51    appealed to literati and officials who were interested in cosmology,  something Cheng Jiong evinced in his work on the Yijing (Classic of  Change), and surely contributed to making contagion, which does not fit  well in cosmological systems, anathema.   Implications  The theoretical potential of demons, worms, and effluvia to be treated in  functional, processual, or relational terms was never fully translated into  practice. Daoist talismans did not attempt to convert demons; they  exorcised them. Medical therapies did not prescribe means of harmonizing  with demons and worms; they avoided and expelled them. Foul qi was not  measured on axes of temperature and moisture; it stank. The compelling  cosmology that provided the basis for functional medicine, while influen- tial, sometimes overlay and more often coexisted, competed, or alternated  with other ways of looking at the world, experiencing the body, and  healing. These frameworks not only offered different ways of looking at the  world, they authorized different action in it.  They were strategic resources.    It is not inconsequential that functional-configurational medicine  offered an elegant cosmology of disease and epidemics that shared a  common idiom with dominant models of imperial-bureaucratic power.  This medical modality’s diagnostic and therapeutic approaches demanded  subtle artistry and erudite sensitivity, not unlike that of the ideal ruler or  official. It identified not enemies to be attacked or defended against, but  irregularities to be regulated, imbalances to be balanced, insufficiencies to  be replenished, excesses to be curbed, contrary flows to be re-channeled. It  eschewed martial approaches for civil ones congenial to cultured literati,  gentry, and the growing number of physicians who aspired to elite  distinction.119 It reduced the human, environmental, climatic, and epide- miological ecologies of far-flung Lingnan, Sichuan, Jiangnan, and the  northern “central” plains to fractal variants of common principles, or even  Coherent Principle (li 理 ), thus producing an ideologically resonant  formulation that integrated the diverse peoples and lands of the empire.  Ontological-contaminationist medicine did not. Instead it offered a  vibrantly diverse and capricious world of violent bestial demons, gnawing  verminous creatures, and vile fetid vapors. It located these in the rooms  and effects of the sick and the dead and in exotic, frightening lands. These  were not patterns to be harmonized, but things to be fled, warded off,                                                             119 On the growing number of Song physicians who were seeking and achieving  something closer to literati status, see Hymes (1987); Chen (1997); Chu (2006).    </page> <page sequence="34"> 52                                                                                                  EASTM 41 (2015)    cleansed, and destroyed. Ontological modalities were not alien to elite  culture and ruling practice, but neither did they suit civil-bureaucratic and  Confucian ideals—ideals grounded in oppositions between governance  through transformative instruction of commoners and barbarians on the  one side, and punishment and military conquest on the other. In the Song,  officials and literati exhibited totalizing preoccupations, campaigning  aggressively to integrate elite-commoner and center-periphery customs  and mores.120 As we have seen, this ethos permeated far beyond policy and  philosophy, contributing to the rationalization of theories of epidemics,  and to the marginalization of contagious Warmth diseases and the divisive  world views and behaviors they supported.                                                               120 This ethos tended to be acted on more through central state policy in the  Northern Song, and more through local activism and self-cultivation in the  Southern Song.
