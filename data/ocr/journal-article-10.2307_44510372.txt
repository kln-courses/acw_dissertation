<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text JOHN D. NILES Riddle 74 is one of a handful of Old English riddles of the Exeter Book that have stubbornly resisted a solution.1 As Bruce Mitchell and Fred C. Robinson remark, 'scholars have suggested answers . . . but none satisfies all the conditions set forth in the poem'.2 Peter Clemoes finds the attributes that are ascribed to this particular riddle-subject to be 'so paradoxical that it seems impossible to name their possessor at all'.3 Riddles normally do have answers, however, and this one is no exception. My first aim in this article is to offer an answer to Riddle 74 that will put debate to rest as to its intended solution. Ascertaining the answer to the riddle is not my only purpose, however. Like almost any short specimen of Old English verse, Riddle 74 can be used as a lever by which large objects may be moved. A second aim of this essay is to assess the criteria for validity in interpretation, both in regard to the literary riddle (as opposed to social riddling) and as a general problem in human understanding. The question of how to determine linguistic meaning in general, I shall claim, can be clarified using Riddle 74 as a test case. A third aim of the paper is to examine the ludic qualities of the Exeter Book riddles and, by extension, of poetry of other kinds. I will suggest that there is reason to regard poetry in general, not just in the Anglo-Saxon context, as a species of play, a special type of extended riddling. Finally, approaching Riddle 74 as a microcosm, I will suggest that the corpus of Old English riddles provides a useful vantage point for examining the worldview of the Anglo-Saxons. Through their bold use of metaphor, the riddles play with conceptual categories and habits of thought that were taken for granted in the culture of their time. Although my subject is only five lines of verse, it therefore involves questions of some magnitude. 1 The riddle is no. 74 in The Exeter Book, ed. G. P. Krapp and E. V. K. Dobbie (New York, 1936), ASPR 3 (henceforth cited as K-D), and I shall follow common practice in referring to it by that number. It is no. 72 in The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book, ed. C. Williamson (Chapel Hill, NC, 1977), henceforth W in short citations.

Niles TEXT, TRANSLATIONS AND IMAGINED SOLUTIONS The manuscript context of Riddle 74 is well known and need not detain us long, though it has a bearing on my arguments. In modern editions the riddle consists of five printed lines of verse. In its unique manuscript source it appears as three lines of writing at the foot of 126v of the Exeter Book.4 It is one of ninety- five riddles, according to the usual count,5 that are written out in two main sets. The first set, nos. 1-59 (101r-115r), is preceded by a large and miscellaneous group of poems, the last of which are Deor (fol. 100) and Wulf and Eadwacer (lOOv-lOlr). The second set, nos. 61-95, occupies 124v-130v and concludes the Exeter Book. Between the two sets, a dozen other poems are written out in the same hand: The Wife's Lament (fol. 115), seven devotional poems (115v-122v), another version of Riddle 30 (122v), Riddle 60 (122v-123r), The Husband's Message (fol. 123) and The Ruin (123v-124v). No tides are given for any of these texts and there are no sectional divisions in the manuscript, so that the poems succeed one another without special distinctions other than capitaliza- tion of their first word on a new line and the marking of their last word with full- stop punctuation. There has naturally been some debate as to which of these poems belong to the riddle genre and which do not.6 While the versified version of the Lord's Prayer (1 22r) is clearly not a riddle, some readers have thought that The Husband's Message , for example, is. Speaking of the group of items that extends from Riddles 30b and 60 through the three capitalized sections of The Husband's Message to the Ruin , Anne Klinck suggests that 'the compiler seems to have thought that all six were riddle-like.'7 Certainly there is reason to conclude that the compiler of the manuscript (or its archetype) was a 'creative antholo- 4 A facsimile has been published as The Exeter Book of Old English Poetry , with introductory chap- ters by R.

(Exeter, 1994). 5 There are ninety-one riddles according to the Williamson count. The reason that this count varies from the K-D count is disagreement as to whether K-D riddles 1-3, 75-6 and 79-80 constitute separate poems or are parts of single poems. Williamson favours the latter conclu- sion and numbers these as riddles 1, 73 and 76, respectively, with the rest of his numeration adjusted accordingly. 6 See the more extended discussion of genre on pp. 198-9 below.

Riddle 74 is a good test case for larger arguments because it is short and com- plete, there are no disputes about its genre, and it presents almost no textual difficulties.9 In line 5 the manuscript reading/öriT 'forth', a nonsensical reading, is emended by almost universal agreement to ferÖ 'spirit, soul', yielding a verse that is grammatical, that makes sense in this context, and that is paralleled twice else- where in the riddles.10 The text thus emended reads as follows, as punctuated by its most recent editor: Ic waes faemne geong, feaxhar cwene, ond aenlic rinc on ane tid; fleah mid fuglum ond on flode sworn, deaf under y]?e dead mid fiscum, ond on foldan stop - haefde ferÖ cwicu.11 In essence, the art of riddling is the art of deceptive speech. Here, as in over half of the riddles of the Exeter Book, the thing or object whose name is to be guessed speaks in its own voice.12 The speaker-subject tries to disguise its iden- tity13 not through the usual human strategems of silence or lies, but rather through the artful use of metaphor and other forms of deliberate ambiguity. 8 The Exeter Book, ed. Muir II, 624. 9 Since the manuscript text is unpunctuated apart from capitalization of Ic (line 1) and the inclu- sion of a full stop after cwicu (last line), there are various possible ways of punctuating the text in modern editions. These options have caused no more than minor debate, however, and I will pass over the question of punctuation now before returning to it after offering my proposed solution. 10 Cf. Riddle 10 (W8), verse 6a: Hafde feorh cwico , 'I had a living spirit'; Riddle 13 (Wll), verse 3a: hafdon feorg civico, 'they had living spirits'. To judge from these parallels,/^ functions as a variant of feorh or feorg, 'life, soul'. Williamson, following An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, ed. J. Bosworth and T. N. Toller (Oxford, 1898), with Supplement, ed. T. N. Toller (1921) and Revised and Enlarged Addenda by A. Campbell (1972) (henceforth cited as B-Tļ, lists ferÖ separately from feorh in his glossary and glosses it 'mind, spirit, life', but the two words seem to be used interchangeably. 11 The Exeter Anthology, ed. Muir I, 369; text identical with W, p. 109. What follows is a hyperliteral word-for-word translation: 'I was (a) woman/girl young, (a) hair-gray woman/queen, and (a) peerless warrior/man in/at one time/season/hour; (I) flew among birds and in/on (the) sea swam, dived under (the) wave dead among fish/fishes, and stepped/walked on land - (I) had/held (a) spirit/soul (or souls) living.' 12 Riddles of the Exeter Book, ed. Tupper, p. lxxxix, lists fifty riddles in this category. 13 I shall try to avoid referring to the speaker by any third-person-singular pronoun, as by its grammatical gender the wording 'he', 'she' or 'it' can prejudice a solution. Where the resulting awkwardness becomes intolerable I shall use 'it', with the justification that the neuter pronoun is the least likely to mislead, seeing that most of the Exeter Book riddles have an inanimate solution. 171</page><page sequence="4">John D ' Niles The speaker must be identified in defiance of four paradoxes. It was female but also male; it was a young maiden but also a mature woman; it moved about not just in one medium but on land, in and on the sea, and in the air; and at one time or another it was both quick and dead. Before I review proposed answers to this riddle, a glance at its published trans- lations may be in order, for translations can easily predispose a reader in the direc- tion of one or another solution. As has often been remarked, any act of translation (even the hyperliteral translation I have given above, n. 11) is at the same time an act of interpretation. Every translator of a work puts a different spin on the text, and these different spins, even if slight, can be instructive.14 Moreover, verse is difficult to translate compared with prose, and Old English alliterative verse is notoriously difficult to render transparently. With no intent either to blame or praise this work as poetry in its own right, I will reproduce three transla- tions of Riddle 74 that are likely to be well known. One is by Michael Alexander, the second by Kevin Crossley-Holland, and the third by Craig Williamson.15 Alexander translates the riddle as follows: I was in one hour an ashen crone a fair-faced man, a fresh girl, floated on foam, flew with birds, under the wave dived, dead among fish, and walked upon land a living soul. Here, noticeably, the first three main substantives come in a different order from what we see in the Exeter Book. Alexander has the speaker change from crone to man to girl^ whereas in the original text the speaker changes from maiden to mature woman to man. The negative connotation of Alexander's ťcrone' is absent from the OE noun avene , or at least is very muted there.16 Alexander's 14 For discussion of this aspect of translation theory with examples drawn from Beowulf, see my 'Rewriting Beowulf, the Task of Translation', College Eng. 55 (1993), 858-78. 15 The following examples are taken, respectively, from The Earliest English Poems , trans. M. J. Alexander (Harmondsworth, 1966), p. 101, repr. with no change in his Old English Riddles from the Exeter Book (London, 1980), p. 73; The Exeter Riddle Book, trans. K. Crossley-Holland (London, 1978), p. 91, repr. with no change in his The Exeter Book Riddles (Harmondsworth, 1979), p. 90; and A Feast of Creatures : Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs, trans. C. Williamson (Philadelphia, PA, 1982), p. 134. Other translations of Riddle 74 that I have consulted are by Thorpe, Codex Exoniensis, p. 487; Anglo-Saxon Riddles of the Exeter Book, trans. P. F. Baum (Durham, NC, 1963), pp. 51-2; The Riddles of the Exeter Book, trans. H. H. Abbott (Cambridge, 1968), p. 41; Old English Riddles, ed. Whitman, p. 213; and Die altenglischen Rätsel, ed.

The word normally means 'woman' or 'wife'; specialized senses are 'queen, empress', 'princess' or 'concubine' (in reference to a priest's consort, or perhaps common-law wife). The word is used of the Virgin Mary as well as of historical queens of good repute. 172</page><page sequence="5">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text 'crone' has an ashen complexion rather than ash-grey hair,17 while his man is 'fair-faced', a rather free rendering of OE cenlic , which literally means 'peerless' or by extension 'excellent, beautiful, elegant'.18 The four verbs of motion, too, come in a different sequence. Alexander's speaker first floated , then flew, then dived , then walked, whereas the speaker of the original riddle first flew, then swam, then dived, and then stepped on land. From the practical standpoint of riddle-solving, these small departures from the Exeter Book text could be mis- leading, for through them a code is scrambled that might be suggestive of a solution. In Alexander's poem, also, the speaker 'walked upon land a living soul', whereas it is not clear that the original speaker had a living soul at the same time as it stepped on land. It might have had life at some prior stage of its existence; the OE past tense hcefde encompasses pluperfect usages. Crossley-Holland's version reads as follows: I was once a young woman, a glorious warrior, a grey-haired queen. I soared with birds, stepped on the earth, swam in the sea - dived under waves, dead amongst fishes. I had a living spirit. Although this translation is more literal than the preceding one, again the order of the first three main substantives is altered. Crossley-Holland's speaker changes homy oung woman to warńorto queen (far from a crone!) instead of from a young woman to a mature one to a warrior. The adjective 'glorious' is another loose rendering of cenlic, a word that need not imply fame. The speaker's move- ment progresses from airto earth to sea, not from air to sea to land. Again, these departures from the Exeter Book text could interfere with a solution. Craig Williamson faithfully reproduces the speaker's movement from air to sea to land. Like Alexander, however, he avoids rendering hœfde ferxf cwicu with a syn- tactically equivalent phrase and so his speaker is unambiguously alive at the same time as it moved about. In a more dramatic departure from the original wording, he reduces the number of substantives in the first series from three to two: I was a gray girl, ash-haired, elegant, And a singular warrior at the same time. I flew with the birds and swam in the sea, Dove under waves, dead among fish, And stood on the shore - locking in a living spirit. 17 OE feax denotes 'hair', as in ch. 33 of the Laws of iEthelberht, where feaxfang "pulling someone's hair' is a legal offence subject to compensation of fifty sceattas , or the same amount that was exacted for rape of a slave of the second class (ch. 16): The Laws of the Earliest English Kings y ed. and trans.

From the stand- point of riddle-solving, this is an unfortunate loss. The noun fiemne , despite its etymological descent from Latin femina , normally denotes 'maiden' rather than 'woman',19 and when qualified by the adjective geong it must have that meaning. The noun cwene , however, denotes a mature woman. Despite the enduring appeal of the 'warrior-maiden' motif in both fiction and life,20 something poten- tially important having to do with age and maturity is absent from this transla- tion. Two other points relating to the translation of Riddle 74 deserve notice. (1) The second line of the OE poem ends with the phrase on ane tid. Taken literally this phrase would seem to mean 'at the same time', as it does for example in an anonymous twelfth-century homily printed by Belfour,21 and that is how Williamson translates it. Alexander translates the phrase 'in one hour', a varia- tion on the same sense. Crossley-Holland prefers to translate it as 'once', as in 'once upon a time'. As I shall argue, this latter choice happens to be an attractive one. Although I will not yet try to resolve the meaning of on ane tid, I wish to make note of the translators' different ways of handling it; for that difference, I believe, results from the calculated ambiguity of the Exeter Book text, which leads us down a false track at every turn. (2) The noun ferö in line 5 (the product of reasonable emendation), though almost always taken as grammatically singu- lar since the verb that governs it is singular, could also be grammatically plural. As a neuter a-stem monosyllabic noun with a long syllable, it takes no plural inflection. The -u inflection of the accompanying adjective avicu does not help us here, for though one might expect it to indicate plurality, the same inflectional vowel (in the variant spelling - o ) appears elsewhere with avic in the riddles in a phrase that can only be taken in the singular.22 'I had a living spirit' is thus the usual translation of the last verse, though 'I had living spirits' or 'I held living spirits' or even 'he, she or it held living spirits' remain possible alternatives. 19 B-T, s.v. fœmne. 20 For a discussion of this theme in British popular literature, see D. M. Dugaw, Warrior Women and Popular Balladry, 1650-1850 (Cambridge, 1989). Although the theme has been exploited by writers from the time of HervararSaga to that of Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior (New York, 1976), its relevance to this riddle cannot be assumed. 21 'Uton nu bihealden )?a wunderlice swiftnesse J?are sawlae.

This particular example is relevant to the solution to Riddle 74 that is pro- posed by Erhart-Siebolt (see below pp. 176-7). 22 For the plural, see verse 3a of Riddle 13 (W1 1); for the singular, verse 6a of Riddle 10 (W8), as cited above, p. 171, n. 10. 174</page><page sequence="7">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text If Riddle 74 remains unsolved, this is not because of a failure of will on the part of would-be solvers. Over the century and a half since the Exeter Book was first published, at least nine different solutions have been proposed.23 It will be useful to review these briefly. The first solution, 'cuttlefish', was offered by Franz Dietrich in 1859.24 Dietrich retracted his suggestion six years later for lack of evidence,25 but John Walz then took up the cause.26 Aldhelm's Enigma 16, 'Luligo', whose tide is translated by Pitman as 'flying-fish' but that literally denotes 'cuttlefish' (Latin lolligò ), bears some resemblance to Riddle 74.27 According to Pliny the cutdefish could fly out of water.28 But since no authority claims that the cutdefish is her- maphroditic; since Aldhelm's riddle says nothing about either a sex change or life-in-death; and since the change from famne to avene remains unexplained, a connection here is unlikely. Moritz Trautmann's 'water in its various forms' (1894, 1905, 1915) is ingeni- ously argued.29 The fcemne geongis a fresh spring (OE burne , a feminine noun); the feaxhar avene is an ice floe;30 and the rinc is snow (OE s naw, a masculine noun). Snow flies through the air; ice floats in the sea, and ice also melts into the sea when it 'dies', or dissipates; and water flows on land in the forms of streams or, as waves, rolls over the shore. The objection has been made that water is not alive, that it has no ferii avicu. In his note of 1915 Trautmann evades this difficulty by suggesting that that phase, taken in the plural, refers to fish and other aquatic creatures, who are 'held' by the water of seas, pools and rivers. If no better 23 For a list of solutions to Exeter Book riddles proposed through the 1970s, see D. K. Fry, 'Exeter Book Riddle Solutions', OE7V15.1 (1981), 22-33, at 25 for Riddle 74. 24 F.

Aldhelm's riddle describes a creature with scales that swims with fish and flies with birds, but that cannot breathe air. There was evidendy some confusion in the Anglo-Latin tradition: the cuttlefish, a cephalopod mollusc related to the octopus, does not have scales. 28 Pliny, Historia naturalis , vol. III (bks 8-11), ed. and trans. H. Rackham (London, 1940), ix. 45 (pp. 218-19). 29 Trautmann offered this solution without any supporting argument in 'Die Auflösungen der altenglischen Rätsel', Beiblatt %ur Anglia 5 (1894), 46-51. He argued his case fully in 'Alte und neue Antworten auf altenglischen Rätsel', Bonner Beiträge %ur Anglistik 19 (1905), 201-3, and confirmed and nuanced it in his edition of 1915, Die altenglischen Rätsel , p. 128. The feaxhar civene could also be frost, I might add. Frost might seem long-haired and is clearly greyish; cf. 'hoar-frost', though the earliest use of this word is c. 1290, according to the Oxford English Dictionary , 2nd ed., vol. VII (Oxford, 1989), henceforth OED. This connection is sup- ported by Riddle 93 (W89), lines 13-14, where the adjective har and the noun feax appear in conjunction with frost: hwilum hara scoc / forst of feaxe , 'sometimes grey frost shook from his hair' (according to one possible translation of this grammatically difficult clause). 175</page><page sequence="8">John D. Niles solution were available I would be tempted to opt for Trautmann's, with some uncertainty as to why the iceberg is a feminine personification as well as with some doubt as to whether ice, when it melts away into its matrix and alter ego of water, can legitimately be called 'dead'.31 Frederick Tupper argued vigorously for the solution 'siren' (1903, 1906, 1910). 32 His proposal has attracted intermittent support despite the very periph- eral place of the siren in Anglo-Saxon lore; but can we seriously imagine the speaker to be a transsexual birdlike siren that has dived among fish and has died by being turned to stone? Here is one instance where Tupper's classical learning has led him into the realm of fancy. Ferdinand Holthausen's proposal 'swan' (1925), on the other hand, seems more literal than one might wish.33 The cygnet, in his view, is the fœmnegeong. The adult female, with a few grey feathers still attached, is the cwene^ while (with some special pleading) the female is also the rincy since OE swan 'swan' is a grammatically masculine noun. A swan does indeed fly, swim, dive, and step on land. But if a swan is meant, it would have to be a dead swan unless we accept Holthausen's suggested emendation of dead 'dead' to dreag 'moved'. Given the neat antithesis of the quick and the dead in lines 4-5, no other editor or translator has adopted this course. Recendy Peter Kitson has pro- posed an ingenious variation on the 'swan' solution that sidesteps the problem of the speaker's 'death' by postulating that allusion is being made to the former belief that rather than migrating, certain waterbirds lie hidden for long periods of the year like fishes beneath the surface of the sea. He there- fore takes the bird in question to be the jlfetu 'whooper swan', a winter migrant to the British Isles from circumpolar regions.34 Since OE jlfetu is a feminine noun, the female personification of the speaker in line 1 is explained. Kitson does not attempt to explain why the same creature is described as a masculine rìnc in line 2, but leaving this point aside, his solution is the most persuasive among the non-metaphorical ones that have been offered to date. Erhardt-Siebold's solution of 'soul' (1946, 1952) is based on a parallel between Riddle 74 and a fragment from the writings of the pre-Socradc 31 P. Baum, Anglo-Saxon Riddles , suggests that if 'water' is the solution, then a more specific answer would be 'rain': he sees here a 'gende shower, a heavy downpour, in the sea its natural form (its life) is lost; a litde imagination can see it as hail walking on the ground' (p. 51). But this proposal makes litde sense of feaxhar cwene and fer3 avicu. 32 F. Tupper, 'Originals and Analogues of the Exeter Book Riddles', Mod. Lang.

This proposed solution lacks either contextual or textual likeli- hood. There is no other evidence for knowledge of the Empédocles fragment in Anglo-Saxon England, while neither the feaxhar cwene of the OE riddle nor the phrase dead mid fiscum is explained. One thing we do know about the soul, whether in its Empedoclean or its Christian form, is that it does not die. E H. Whitman offers the answer 'writing', or 'quill pen used for writing' (1968, 1982).36 The solution works well for Riddle 51 (W49, 'Pen and Fingers'), so why not here as well? Feathers (or the birds who once wore them) do fly through the air and swim in the sea, while in Riddle 51a quill pen does dip into an inkwell (the 'sea of ink', as it were) and leaves 'tracks' on a manuscript page (the land on which the riddle-creature steps). Important details of Riddle 74 remain unexplained, however. Whitman can perhaps be permitted to collapse the fœmnegeong and the feaxhar cwene of line 1 into a single thing, the quill pen, but what of the œnlicrincoî lines 1-2 and the fishes of line 4?37 Another solution proposed recendy is Kiernan's 'sea-eagle' (1974). 38 Like Holthausen's swan, the sea-eagle is at home in the air, in or on the sea, and on the shore. Kiernan must face the same objection as Holthausen, however: what to do with dead mid fiscum ? Rejecting the route of textual emendation, Kiernan appeals to medieval exegesis. The medieval Latin Physiologus recounts a legend to the effect that the eagle - not, however, specifically the sea-eagle - 'when he grows old, seeks a well, and by diving into it renews himself' (p. 520). As for the sex-change of lines 1-2, the riddle describes parthenogenesis, which Kiernan relates to both the Virgin Mary and vultures, in a tradition going back to Ambrose. He then has the task of relating vultures to the eagle, and specifically to the sea-eagle, which however is not grey but white. The exegetical route, when superimposed on a literalist base, becomes so complex as to seem unwieldy and leaves us with a dead (but now resurrected) parthenogenic bird freshly emerged from the baptismal font. 35 E. von Erhardt-Siebold, The Anglo-Saxon Riddle 74 and Empedokles' Fragment 117', MM 1 5 (1946), 48-54, and 'Note on Anglo-Saxon Riddle 74', ibid. 21 (1952), 36-7. 36 F.

The figurehead is dead, but it is made of what was once living wood. The figurehead can be called a rinc , in Williamson's view, because it charges the waves like a beautiful warrior. There is a historical/contextual problem with this solu- tion, however. Despite Williamson's suggestion to the contrary, neither archae- ology nor art history provides evidence that shipwrights of this period fashioned figureheads in the shape of young women. Although zoomorphic or draconic figureheads are known from the Anglo-Saxon and Viking periods, nowhere do we find carvings in the shape of a girl.40 The solution is subject to doubt whether or not Williamson's reading of the metaphors is accepted. It therefore seems that over the century and a half since Riddle 74 was first published, scholars have hunted through both physical nature and material culture without finding a viable solution.41 They have scoured the myths and texts of the ancient classical world for clues and have come up with empty hands. They have thumbed through Pliny's natural history and the medieval Physiologus , they have applied the art of medieval exegesis, and they have stretched their personal powers of imagination to the utmost without evident success. No convincing parallel has been cited either from the medieval Latin tradition or from elsewhere in the Exeter Book. Critics remain as baffled as ever by the paradoxes of female in male, of young in old, of life in death, of a crea- ture that seems to know no physical limits to its powers of motion. THE LITERARY RIDDLE AND THE FOLK RIDDLE How do we proceed, then, in this impasse? If we were dealing with social or 'folk' riddling, there would be no problem. Spoken riddles 'presuppose at least two parties, the poser and the solver, and constitute a dialogue between the 39 The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book, pp. 349-52. 40 See R. Bruce-Mitford, 'Ships' Figure-Heads of the Migration Period', in his Aspects of Anglo- Saxon Archaeology (London, 1974), pp. 175-87. 41 Other solutions to Riddle 74 have been proposed, but only the ones I have discussed call for serious consideration. E. Müller opted for 'sun', during the boom years of solar mythology: Die Rätsel des Exeterhuchs (Cö then, 1861), p. 19. L. Bragg, The Lyric Speakers of Old English Poetry (Rutherford, NJ, 1991), posits a human speaker and takes that speaker's words literally, despite the difficulty one might have imagining what person could have satisfied the claims made in these five lines. In its blithe self-referentiality, Bragg's reading of the riddle is a concise expres- sion of the school of thought that a poem means what it feels like: 'This solution may not be the one intended by its author, but it is the one that brings this riddle to life for me, and that causes me to think most deeply about my own experiences' (p. 52). 178</page><page sequence="11">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text two'.42 In the human contexts that are studied by anthropologists and folklorists who have set up camp in the field, the 'correct' answer to a riddle is whatever the poser says is right. According to the rules of the game, the poser alone has the authority to declare a solution. What is black and white and red all over? The newspaper, you say? No: it is a blushing zebra. A blushing zebra, you say? No, it is a sunburned zebra, or a skunk with diaper rash, or a chocolate sundae with ketchup on it, or a squashed nun, or a penguin that cut himself shaving.43 There is no escaping either the poser's authority or his wit. The riddler is the magister ludi , whose decision is final. In the Anglo-Saxon context, however, we have no riddle performers, only riddle texts. The artful and uncompromising textuality of the Exeter Book riddles is in part what makes them so interesting from a literary perspective, for some of them pose as brisk a challenge to the intelligence and imagination of their readers as is offered by any other poetry of this time. Let us therefore con- sider what light can be cast on the art of the Exeter Book riddles by considera- tion of a literary riddle of more recent date. A poem written by the American poet Emily Dickinson (1830-86) will serve well for our purposes. It is headed T463' in the author's unique holograph collection, a neady handwritten set of fascicles that was discovered after her death and that has come to be regarded as one of the greatest achievements of American poetry. Like the poems of the Exeter Book, this poem stands alone in its manuscript context without tide or explanatory notes. It reads as follows in Thomas Johnson's edition, which is a semi-diplomatic one:44 A Route of Evanescence With a revolving Wheel - A Resonance of Emerald - A Rush of Cochineal - And every Blossom on the Bush Adjusts it's tumbled Head - The mail from Tunis, probably, An easy Morning's Ride - Some creature or thing is being described in oblique, metaphorical terms. How can we tell what it is? As many answers might be proposed for this riddle as have been proposed for 42 N. E Barley, 'Structural Aspects of the Anglo-Saxon Riddle', Semiotica 10 (1974), 143-75, at 143-4. 43 Most of these solutions are drawn from D. Ben- Amos, 'Solutions to Riddles', Jnl of Amer. Folklore 89 (1976), 249-54. This issue of that journal (no. 352), ed. E. Köngäs Maranda, is devoted to the riddle. 44 The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson , ed. T. H. Johnson, 3 vols.

Niles Exeter Book Riddle 74 if it existed only in Dickinson's manuscript fascicles, but only one answer would be right. Dickinson herself named the solution no fewer than five times in personal letters when she sent this poem to friends.45 The object to be guessed is a hummingbird, the bird that James Audubon described as a 'glittering garment of the rainbow'.46 The revolving wheel of line 2 is the blur of the hummingbird's wings, which (scientists tell us) beat at the rate of 80 beats per second in ordinary forward flight and, reportedly, up to 200 beats per second during courtship. The emerald and cochineal are features of the irides- cent coloration of the particular North American hummingbird that Dickinson had in mind: probably the male ruby-throated hummingbird ( Archilochus colu- bns), which has a range from Central America to Canada and which frequents summer gardens in that part of Massachusetts where the Dickinson family made their home. The phrase 'Route of Evanescence' neatly evokes the hum- mingbird's unique 'now-you-see-it, now-you-don't' manner of flying: the hum- mingbird can hover virtually motionless, then accelerate almost instantaneously to a speed of 50-60 km/hour in forward flight. The blossoms on the bush are shaking slightly, somewhat dishevelled after their quasi-sexual encounter with the bird. Tunis represents any exotic location, and yet the hummingbird, like any otherworldly messenger, seems to flit effortlessly between the land of iridescent imaginings and any person's back garden. While poem '1463' is obviously a literary riddle, and while Dickinson wrote other poems in the same genre, neither this one example nor her riddle poems as a group demand analysis separate from her verse taken as a whole. Rhetorically, 'A Route of Evanescence' functions very nearly like any of her other 1,775 lyric poems. It offers comparable challenges and pleasures. In one after another of her poems can be traced the same oblique approach to a subject, the same bold use of metaphor, and the same fondness for personification as is evident here, whether her subject is the death-watch, a train in motion over the hills, a mood of intense despair, or delight in one of the creatures of nature. Furthermore, the process of reading 'A Route of Evanescence' - the process of unriddling this text - is the same process that is at work when we read any of Dickinson's poems. With any of them she plays similar games with the reader. We feel the same initial bafflement at the aggressive alterity of the text. We are challenged to draw on all the resources of our imagination to resolve the problem posed by this alterity so as to enter into the thought-world of the speaker. Then, if all goes well, comes the sudden pleasure of guessing the right answer - or, in other words, understanding the literal subject of the poem. 45 Ibid. pp. 1011-12. 40 Quoted by P. A.

Just as Old English Riddle 74 is to the whole Exeter Book anthology, then, so Dickinson's poem ť1463' is to her body of poetry as a whole. Whether we are speaking of formalist poetics or of reader-response theory, the art of a riddle is a quintessence of the art of the more lyrical type of poetry. This is a point to which I will return. One troublesome question needs posing here, however. Suppose we had no confirmation from Dickinson's private correspondence that 'hummingbird' is the subject of poem T463'. By what standards could we still conclude that this is the right answer and that all other possible answers are wrong? To return to the Anglo-Saxon context: how can one judge if any one solution to Riddle 74 is so superior to others that it can be declared 'the' solution? What makes for validity in interpretation, anyway? I mean this to be a practical question, not an abstract one. There are prag- matic principles of criticism that we employ all the time and that still beg for clarification. Let us then take a moment to consider their basis. WHAT MAKES FOR VALIDITY IN INTERPRETATION? Thirty years ago, E. D. Hirsch's classic study Validity in Interpretation staked out one position in a debate that subsequently has taken many forms.47 In brief, according to Hirsch, a work means what its author claims it means, or what readers can rea- sonably deduce to have been the author's intent based on signs that are evident in the text. The ascription of intentionality to the figure of the author-as-God is no clear-cut matter, however, as has often been pointed out. The author may be dead and may have left no statement as to his or her intentions. Even if still alive, the author may be lying, or drunk, or otherwise untrustworthy as a witness. Or it could be that by happenstance, the author has hit upon some combination of words whose import, though meaningful to some readers, was never consciously intended. In the Old English period, very few authors can be visualized in conjunc- tion with the texts that have come down to us. Almost all the poetry is of anony- mous origin, and the concept of authorship during this period of formulaic composition, massive debts to prior sources and frequent scribal rewriting has rightly become one of the most contested points of literary criticism.48 The argu- ment from intention should not be dismissed - someone, somewhere must have meant something by the texts that we read today! - but it is fraught with difficulties. 47 E. D. Hirsch, Jr, Validity in Interpretation (New Haven, CT, 1967). 48 C. B. Pasternack, The Textuality of Old English Poetry, CS ASE 13 (Cambridge, 1996), 12-21, reviews the problematics of authorship and audience in the Anglo-Saxon context without exhausting this potentially explosive subject. 181</page><page sequence="14">John D. Niles Running counter to all arguments based on intentionality is a vein of thought, prominent in critical studies postmarked in Paris in recent years, to the effect that no one can possibly make meaningful statements in a medium as slippery as lan- guage, and that if someone does try to make meaningful statements, then no one else can possibly construe them. Writing pardy to shun the nihilistic abyss that has been opened up by deconstruction, pardy to provoke old-school positivists, Stanley Fish has marked out a hermeneutical position that allows for the identification of meaning in a text, yet from a standpoint opposite to that of Hirsch.49 Meaning is not to be ascertained by trying to enter into an author's consciousness, nor is it inscribed immutably in the text, as some New Critics used to imagine. Rather, it occurs within the individual reader as that person responds to the stimulus of the text. For obvious practical reasons, few critics are willing to embrace the pure relativism that this view entails in its ťharď form. Fish suggests two possible ways of mitigating the drawbacks of pure relativism: authority and convention. The meaning that a competent or authoritative person ascribes to a text is preferable to a meaning that is declared by anyone else; or, alternatively, acceptable meanings are distinguished from unacceptable ones by judgement of an interpretative community of competent members. In other words (to caricature this argument somewhat cruelly), meaning is what Stanley Fish says it is, or it is what a group of Stanley Fish's friends says it is. ťSofť rela- tivism of this kind, too, can have only slight appeal to medievalists, few of whom are likely to grant any one scholar or circle of scholars the authority to declare solutions to literary problems. When we try to solve Riddle 74, we have no access to the interpretative community of the Anglo-Saxons themselves, and modern- day specialists in Old English (the best available substitute for that community) have arrived at no consensus of opinion. We still need to know how to proceed. Paul Armstrong's thoughtful study Conflicting Readings: Varìety and Validity in Interpretation reviews such debates from a philosophical perspective and makes a case for a middle ground that allows for limited pluralism within a phenomenological framework.50 Mistrusting the double absolutisms of author- ial intention and radical relativism,51 Armstrong offers three tests for validity in interpretation: inclusiveness , intersuhjectivity and efficacy. In brief, what he means by these terms is that first of all, an interpretation, to be valid, should be complete and should involve 'consistency-building' among various elements. Second, it should prove acceptable to the members of an interpretative community. Third, it should lead to new insights and continued comprehension of the subject. 49 S. Fish, Is There A Text in This Class? The Authority of Interpretive Communities (Cambridge, MA, 1980). 50 P. B. Armstrong, Conflicting Readings: Variety and Validity in Interpretation (Chapel Hill, NC, 1990). 51 Paradoxically, 'hard' relativism can be called an absolutist position, for it categorically denies a locus for validity in interpretation outside the mind of the individual interpreter. 182</page><page sequence="15">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text Although there is nothing unreasonable about Armstrong's approach, we might note that it more accurately helps us locate what has been regarded as a valid interpretation in the past than it tells us how to discover merit in a proposed new reading. Armstrong's criterion of 'efficacy', for example, looks forward toward the possible consequences of a hermeneutical discovery; but before we can be aware of such consequences, we sometimes need to have achieved histor- ical distance from the problem in question. As for Armstrong's appeal to 'inter- subjectivity', this is essentially a nuanced version of Fish's argument for the authority of the interpretative community, and it is subject to similar objections. In any historical era or among any group of interpreters, consensus may harden into dogma regarding the truth-value of particular claims: Marxist claims among Marxists, for example, or exegetical claims among medieval theologians, or Freudian claims among mid-twentieth-century psychoanalysts who are not in the Jungian camp. Interpretations that are accepted by consensus of one group, and that are even thought to yield brilliant insights, may be unacceptable to another equally vocal, well-credentialled group. Moreover, consensus positions die hard, for they are rarely shaken by solutions that proceed from initial assumptions that fall outside the parameters accepted by the group. Michel Foucault responded as follows to the charge that by failing to affiliate himself with any consensus group, he forfeited the right to represent anyone or any values: [One critic has pointed out] that in these analyses I do not appeal to any Ve' - to any of those 'WeV whose consensus, whose values, whose traditions constitute the framework for a thought and define the conditions in which it can be validated. But the problem is, precisely, to decide if it is actually suitable to place oneself within a ťwe' in order to assert the principles one recognizes and the values one accepts; or if it is not, rather, necessary to make the future formation of a Ve' possible . . ,52 If we accept Foucault's defence, then what is sometimes needed is an inter- pretative judgement or question that is both new and so powerful that it can create a new consensus; but this process of acceptance may take time, and it does not necessarily happen at all. Whether the arguments that I have summarized in the preceding paragraphs are found appealing or appalling, some of us may remain impatient about the need for reasonable ways to test solutions for a poem like Riddle 74. The one book written by an Anglo-Saxonist that direcdy addresses the question of valid- ity in interpretation, Stanley B. Greenfield's The Interpretation of Old English Poems , now seems somewhat dated, however well reasoned it is.53 Greenfield offers no 52 The Foucault Reader, ed. P. Rabinów (Harmondsworth, 1 986), p. 385. 53 S. B. Greenfield, The Interpretation of Old English Poems (London, 1972), esp. ch. 1: 'Towards a Critical Framework' (pp. 1-29). 183</page><page sequence="16">John D ' Niles system for testing validity. Instead, working against the grain of the 'historical' (that is, exegetical) mode of criticism that was especially popular during the 1950s and 1960s, he argues in favour of interpretations that engage closely with the language of the text, working out from there to the historical context. Greenfield seems to hope that in specific instances, his readers will accept as valid his nuanced ad hoc resolutions of one critical problem or another. Finding available no master key to the door labelled 'interpretation', I there- fore have drawn up a working list of criteria that ought to be satisfied if a riddle solution is to be found valid.54 The principles are four in number. Each can be expressed in both a positive and a negative form. First, a valid solution must be philologically exacts to the extent that any of us is capable of judging and practising good philology, which itself is a contestable enterprise that has to be positioned within a hermeneutical system. To speak in negative terms, the solution contains no howlers, or at least not any howlers that are crucial to the point being made. Nothing in the interpretation does violence to the specific language of the text, according to all reasonable standards of lex- icography and textual criticism. No word or phrase is forced to mean anything other than what it can reasonably be expected to mean, given the linguistic conventions of the era in question - conventions that do, of course, encompass implicit rules for acceptable metaphors, kennings, puns, irony and other sorts of double meanings. Second, a valid solution is comprehensive. As with Armstrong's criterion of inclusiveness, no potentially important aspect or detail of the text is left out; nothing is left unexplained. The solution is not just declared; it is developed step by step on the basis of a reasonable and sufficient body of evidence. As we have seen, for example, the cuttlefish and quill-pen solutions to Riddle 74 founder on the unexplained male/female paradox, and so neither of these readings is attractive. Moreover, the solution does not contradict itself. It functions smoothly within whatever system of belief or analysis is activated by this solu- tion. To take an example from riddle-solving: the Empedoclean soul, through metempsychosis, can change its shape and age and sex, but it cannot be both living and dead. Erhard t-Sieboldt's solution to Riddle 74 must therefore be rejected. Third, the solution makes for a good histońcal/ contextual fit. It is not anachronistic. It does not stand in intolerable opposition to whatever else is 54 Barley, 'Structural Aspects of the Anglo-Saxon Riddle', raises the issue of validity, but only in the course of a short paragraph (p. 152). More helpfully, he then works through the process by which specific riddles can be disambiguated. Heeding Ben-Amos, 'Solutions to Riddles', we should not forget that in a social context, riddling is a deliberate and sometimes even tyrannical manipulation of truth. A riddle has multiple solutions, any of which can be considered valid by its solver, even though only one is accepted by the person posing the riddle at a given moment. 184</page><page sequence="17">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text known about the historical period during which the work in question was composed, the author who composed it (if that disputed category 'authorship' is invoked), the genre (or the nexus of genres) that is at stake, the intellectual tradition to which the work appears to pertain, and the sources and analogues of the work (if sources and analogues to it are known, or can be located). The solution is therefore in alignment with the possible expectations of an original audience. This is not to say that any of these factors will determine the meaning of the work in question. Any author who writes a work that is worth being read is capable of pushing generic expectations to their limit, so that interpretation must be prepared to go beyond genre at times. Certain inter- pretations of certain works, still, can be ruled out as historically impossible, while others may appear so implausible as to impede belief. To return to Emily Dickinson's hummingbird riddle, for example, if one were to propose the solu- tion 'a rainbow-coloured helicopter just arrived from North Africa', every detail of the poem would be accounted for consistently, but the answer is still a cultural absurdity. Finally, the proposed solution not only satisfies all the first three criteria I have named. It also has an aesthetic appeal to it, deriving from its relative simplicity, that can be summed up under the name elegance . The solution has an 'inner click', to use an expression favoured by Leo Spitzer.55 It is not clumsy. It is no more involved or ingenious than it needs to be. There are no transsexual dead birds lurking about. A correct riddle solution engenders a minor rapture that is akin to what a mathematician experiences when, after years of labour, he or she discovers an elegant solution to a complex problem. Trautmann's 'water in its various forms' is a solution to Riddle 74 that has some elegance about it, for example, whether or not one accepts it, for through one leap of the imagina- tion it transforms what had seemed an exotic creature into something utterly familiar. If these four intertwining principles of validity do indeed constitute a practi- cal basis for determining correctness in riddling - always in the absence of a flesh-and-blood riddler who will set us straight, of course - then what must also be granted, I believe, is that what we are developing is a system of practical crit- icism that can come to grips with the problem of validity in interpretation in general. What holds true for the special genre that we call the literary riddle should also hold true for poetry in general, or indeed for any kind of inter- pretative activity that is done by remote control rather than in face- to- face per- sonal encounters. If what we want is a pragmatic basis for arriving at relative probabilities among many competing possibilities of meaning, then this four- point programme provides a reasonable point of departure. 55 L. Spitzer, Linguistics and Literary History (Princeton, NJ, 1 948), pp. 7 and 1 9. 185</page><page sequence="18">John D. Niles UNRIDDLING RIDDLE 74 Some while ago, I promised that I would offer a solution - the uniquely accept- able solution, as I like to think - to Exeter Book Riddle 74. 1 will now do so. We can then see whether this new solution satisfies reasonable criteria for validity any better than other proposed solutions do. The best heuristic strategy in this instance is to start at the end of the riddle and work step by step backwards. Hcefde ferõ civicu^ the speaker concludes: ťI had a living spirit', if we give these words their face value. This last verse may give us a crucial hint. The speaker of this poem seems to have changed from a 'quick' state to a 'dead' one. Let us then take as our initial act-of-faith assumption that the speaker is an artefact that has been made from some formerly living thing. It is then an object akin to the war-horn and drinking-horn of Riddle 14 (W12), which used to be the horn of an ox, or the leather of Riddles 12, 38 and 72 (W10, W36 and W70), which used to be the hide of a living ox; or the inkhorns of Riddles 88 and 93 (W84 and W89), which used to be anders on the head of a stag; or the battering ram or other wooden object of Riddle 53 (W51), which used to be a tree; or, for that matter, it must be like the cross in the poem known as The Dream of the Rood^ which tells its own life story from the time that it grew up as a tree in the forest. Other examples could easily be cited. The Exeter Book includes a goodly number of 'transformation' riddles that attempt to mystify the reader by juxtaposing two stages of life in a manner that highlights the continu- ity of material substance through profound changes of form and function.56 What kind of an artefact speaks here, then? The middle of the poem tells us. It is something mobile. It is something that - speaking metaphorically, we may assume - 'flies', 'swims', 'dives', and yet also 'steps on land'. A tentative answer to the riddle can now be proposed: it is a ship. But let us be sure to visualize this ship correcdy, for it is not a modern ship, of course, but rather a ship of the kind that would have been familiar to English-speaking people during roughly the eighth to tenth centuries AD, the apparent period when the poems of the Exeter Book were being written and compiled. Let us pursue this hypothesis. Ships, especially those with sails, metaphorically fly like birds. This is what Beowulf's ship does, for example, when it is speeding on its way from the hero's homeland to the coast of Denmark: Gewat pa ofer waegholm winde gefysed flota famiheals fugle gelicost . . ,57 56 P. Sorrell, 'Oaks, Ships, Riddles and the Old English Rune Poem' ASE 19 (1990), 103-16, at 109, n. 26, lists as other examples of 'trans formation, riddles nos. 26, 28, 73 and 83, with reference also to 9, 12, 27 and 77. 57 Beowulf, ed. E Klaeber, 3rd ed. (Boston, MA, 1950), p. 9 (lines 217-18): Then the foamy-necked floater [the ship] departed over the ocean, impelled by the wind, most like a bird . . .' 186</page><page sequence="19">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text Ships obviously swim on the sea, metaphorically speaking. When travelling in high seas, they also metaphorically dive beneath the waves, as any sailor knows who has seen waves cascading over the prow. And what do ships do at the end of their journeys - Viking-style ships, that is? They are not normally anchored offshore. They are beached, and thus metaphorically they step onto the land, as Beowulf's same ship does on its return voyage from Denmark to the land of the Geats: Ceol up geprang lyftgeswenced, on lande stod.58 So the speaker-subject of Riddle 74 could be a ship or boat. We may now be halfway to a solution, but only halfway, for lines 1-2 must still be interpreted. Their use of metaphor is not impenetrable, however. What is a ship or boat made of? Wood. While the cenlic rìnc of line 2 could be the ship itself - ocean- faring ships of the Viking Age were indeed singularly beautiful objects - the feminine item or items evoked in line 1 must be something different. Let me suggest that what is designated is the wood of the ship when it was a living tree.59 If we pursue this possibility, then the fcemne geong of line 1 is the tree in the form of a sapling, while the feaxhar cwene must be the mature tree from which timber is cut. Although the compound adjective feaxhar is unique to this poem and is therefore a small riddle in itself, its two components are commonplace and the simplex har , 'grey' or 'old and grey', occurs many times with reference to trees. One famous example is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry for the year 1066. Here a har apple tree is said to mark the site near Hastings where King Harold Godwinson fought to the death against Duke William of Normandy: J?is wearÖ pa Harolde cynge gecydd, 7 he gaderade pa micelne here, 7 com him togenes act paere haran apuldran.60 A scanning of the charters of the Anglo-Saxon period will turn up no fewer than thirty-six references to har trees that served as boundary markers in a local landscape. Nine of these instances refer to thorn trees (OE porn , denoting one or another type of hawthorn), seven of them to willows (OE ividiģ), no fewer than nineteen to apple trees (OE apeltreo , with many variant spellings), and there 58 Ibid. p. 71 (lines 1912b - 1913): The ship sped ashore, it came to rest on land/ 59 This suggestion is in accord with the system of Old English poetic diction, for ship-kennings in Old English can take a word for 'wood' as their base; examples are bńmwudu, flodwudu, sawudu , sundwudu 'sea- wood' and wœgbord, wœgpel 'wave plank' (B- T). Similarly, the simplex nouns beam 'beam' and bord 'board' can metaphorically designate 'ship'; see B-T, beam sense IV, bord sense III; DOE, bord sense 2. 60 The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle MS D, ed. G. P. Cubbin, The AS Chronicle: a Collaborative Edition 6 (Cambridge, 1996), p. 80: 'This news was then brought to King Harold, and he then mustered a great army and came against him [Duke William] at the old grey apple-tree.' 187</page><page sequence="20">John D. Niles is one solitary hazel (OE hasel ).61 Haris an adjective that is especially appropri- ate to old, well-established trees because of their tendency to host a robust collection of lichens, which often take the form of crusty patches or bushy growths on trunks and limbs.62 The feaxhar cwene must be an old tree covered with lichens. If this line of reasoning is correct, is there a way of deciding what particular kind of hoar-headed tree the tiddler had in mind? I think there is. Old oak trees are often conspicuous for their abundant growths of lichens. They also host mistletoe, an epiphyte that is specific to oak and that might contribute to its hoary aspect. The knight-errant Sir Gawain, in Sir Gaivain and the Green Knight, for example, passes through woods consisting of bore okeņjul hoge a hundreth togeder ,63 and we may assume that full-grown oak trees of the Anglo-Saxon period were no less hoary in appearance than their later medieval or modern counterparts. More importantly, oak wood is specific to the shipwright's trade. Although various woods are known to have been used in early boat construction,64 oak was the favoured timber for sturdy sea-going vessels in northwest Europe during the Anglo-Saxon period, just as it has been in more recent times. Material evidence from all over the North Sea culture zone confirms this observation. The Nydam boat from Schleswig, which can be dated to the period 350-400 AD, is built entirely of oak, with planks eighty-two feet long by twenty inches broad. According to one authority, 'it must have been in ships of the Nydam type that the Anglo-Saxons reached Britain'.65 The Sutton Hoo ship, of the early seventh century, is likely to have been of oak, according to the best authorities.66 The ship from Kvalsund, western Norway, roughly contemporary with the 61 A Microfiche Concordance to Old English , ed.

The elusive speaking object is an ac, or oak-tree, which has been cut down and made into a hat, or boat. One wonders why this solution has caused so much difficulty, for it is very much in keeping with riddling strategies used elsewhere in the Exeter Book. Riddle 73 (W71), for example, direcdy preceding the ac/hat riddle, has the answer œsc/gar, or (in modern English) ťash wood/spear'. Although the text of Riddle 73 is marred by a large burn-hole that adds to its enigmatic character - evidendy the mark of someone's red hot poker set down to cool for a while - the speaker tells of how it grew up on a patch of open ground, where the earth and the clouds of heaven nourished it (it too was then civic, ťalive', line 4), until such time as unidentified enemies killed it, hauled it away, and shaped it to their own design {on honan ivillan, cto the killer's [or killers'] will', verse 7a). Riddle 30 (W28), which also uses first-person address, describes a tree or log (perhaps OE beam) that is variously considered as a living thing and as firewood, a cup and a cross. Riddle 92 (W88), yet again using first-person address, is thought to yield the solution 'beech tree (OE hoc), from which a book is made'. These riddling strate- gies are not unique.70 How does this solution resolve the sex-change paradox of lines 1-2? The answer is simple, though it may seem a nasty trick. It depends on our declaring the answer to the riddle in the language of the tiddler, not in modern English. OE ac is a feminine noun. OE bat is masculine. There is grammatical play here, as was possible since grammatical gender was emphatically tied to male and female categories in nature. As Ati fric writes in his Grammar. 67 Christensen, 'Scandinavian Ships'. 68 A. W. Brogger and H. Shetelig, The Viking Ships: their Ancestry and Evolution, trans. K.

Williamson also observes that the author of the Rune Poem plays on this double meaning of 'ash tree' and 'spear' in those lines (81-3) that accompany the asctunz. 189</page><page sequence="22">John D ' Niles ^Efter gecynde syndon twa cyn on namum, masculinum and femininum' paet is, werlic and wiflic. Werlic cyn byÖ hic vir 'pes wer', wiflic hcecfemina 'pis wif ' ķas twa cyn synd gecyn- delice on mannum and on nytenum.71 Trautmann was of the opinion that play upon grammatical gender was basic to the art of personification in the riddles. 'The Old English riddles, when they personify X, respect the gender very carefully', he claims: 'a thing whose name is masculine, they always represent as a man, feminine, as a woman'.72 Although Trautmann exaggerates - the solution to some riddles is an idea, not a specific word, and hence a 'right' answer can be expressed by synonyms of one or another gender73 - his claim holds true at least some of the time, and that is sufficient to show plausibility here. Tupper, in his discussion of grammatical gender as a clue to riddling, cites at least fifteen possible instances where grammatical gender is 'invoked to the reader's aid'.74 One example is Riddle 73(W71), whose solution 'spear' is concealed in the masculine inflection of frodne in line 3, for bother 'spear' and asc 'ash wood', the material source of the spear, are masculine in gender. Another example is Riddle 21 (W19), whose precise solution sylh 'plough' (a feminine noun) is coded in the feminine inflections of me. . . gongendre (9a) and me . . . hindemardre (14b- 15a). The play in Riddle 74 between the feminine oak tree and the masculine boat is consistent with gender biases that were firmly entrenched in Anglo-Saxon society and that have not lost all their power in subsequent eras. Trees are rooted to one spot, just as women are traditionally associated with hearth and home. Ships - those of the Viking age, in particular - are daring rovers, as men have been known to be. It is not surprising that systems of poetic diction that were in use among the skalds are based on these same metaphors. Just as trees can have feminine qualities, women can be called by the names of trees, as Snorri Sturluson notes in ch. 31 of his Skaldskaparmál 7s Ships, in a poetic context, are 71 Aelfrics Grammatik und Glossar, ed.

To judge from a book on Viking ships that was published in the 1950s, this heroic resonance still plays a strong part in the aesthetics of seafaring: A ship is built to swim the sea, to run through the water and shed it again; it should be strong to withstand the wind and the waves, and there should be room on board for people and goods. We all know how a ship labours in a storm, wrestling with the sea, rising and heeling over till all its timbers creak and groan. Then we see that a ship is alive, that it has a personal will of its own to take on a fight with the elements and see it through . . .77 The strongly masculine ethos that permeates to the language of this description scarcely needs pointing out. As evoked by this expert in shipbuilding and sailing, the ship is no inert object. Rather it is a living thing that swims, runs , sheds water , is large and strong, labours , wrestles and groans aloud . It has the unyielding moral charac- ter of a warrior who is keen to take on a fight and see it through to the end. So we may be right: the young maiden of line 1 is a slender oak sapling; the feaxhar cwene is a hoary old oak tree, able to provide timbers of the size and tensile strength required for the planks, ribs and other parts of a ship; and the rinc or warrior is the strong, beautiful ship itself, battling the waves as it courses forward. There remains one thorn in Riddle 74 still to be removed, however: the phrase on ane tid (line 2). The usual sense of this phrase, as previously noted, is 'at one time'. How can the speaker have been a sapling, a mature oak tree and a ship at the same time? It was not, of course. There are two quite different ways by which a tiddler could declare this question to have no force. First, the riddle need not be punctuated as modern editors and translators have done. The problem of on ane tid disappears if we group the poem's phrases as follows, in modern translation: 'I have been a young maiden , a hoar-headed woman , and a peerless warrior. At a single time I flew among birds and swam in the sea; I dived under the wave, dead among fish, and stepped close discussion of one example, see A. G. Brodeur, The Art of Beowulf { Berkeley, CA, 1959), p. 249. Male tree-kennings are also commonplace, of course; that fact does not negate the evidence cited here. /0 R. Meissner, Die Kenningar der Skalden (Bonn, 1921), notes in his section 85, on ship-kennings, that Old Norse court poets used words for tree or wood to designate the keel or mast of a ship, hence the ship itself: 'Es ist der lebende Baum, der sein Dasein als Schiff weiterführt, wobei vor allem an Kiel oder Mast gedacht wird' (p. 208). This usage is consistent with what we find in Latin exegetical tradition, where the image of the ship as a figure of Ecclesia rests upon the association of the lignum 'wood' of the Cross with the wood of which the ship is made, so that lignum alone can serve as a synecdoche for 'ship': see P. and U. Dronke, Growth of Literature: the Sea and the God of the Sea , H. M.

I had a living spirit! 78 It is the ship's motion that is single and undi- vided, not the speaker's identity as maiden, matron and man. Perhaps everyone since Thorpe has been punctuating Riddle 74 the wrong way; a clever syntactic strategem has worked. Even if one rejects this choice and retains the riddle's conventional modern punctuation (which has nothing but convention to recommend it), all the demands of sense are satisfied if one looks hard at the wording of the phrase in question, ltd is a vague term in the Anglo-Saxon temporal vocabulary. A tid, or a space of time, can be as short as one hour. It can be as long as the twelve doleful years - twelf wintra tid - during which Grendel ravaged the deserted hall Heorot {Beowulf verse 147a). For ALlfric, tid often denotes a particular festival time like Eastertide. iElfric also uses the word with reference to the whole period of thirty-three years during which Christ dwelled on earth in human form.79 In his Grammar and Glossary iElfric glosses post multum tempus as after mycelre tide , 'after a long tid*, so a single tid can clearly be of long duration.80 The whole history of the world, iElfric declares in his first homily for Pentecost, can be divided into three tida , three ages: J?reo tida sind on pissere worulde: an is seo pe waes butan ae; oÖer is seo Öe waes under ae; seo pridde is nu aefter Cristes tocyme.81 It is nothing magical, then, for a sapling to become a tree and a tree to be turned into a ship in a single tid. The reader may have been tricked into thinking that these different modes of being were simultaneous, when what the poet said is no more than that they existed on ane tid. 78 My translations of icwces as 'I have been' (in the perfect tense) and hcefde as 'I had* (in a pluperfect sense) deserve comment. In the Old English text, all six verbs are in the simple past tense. As Bruce Mitchell points out in 'Linguistic Facts and the Interpretation of Old English Poetry', 4 (1975), 17-24, and in Old English Syntax, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1985), §§ 633-44, the Old English past tense is sometimes to be translated in Modern English by a perfect or pluperfect construction. Normally either semantic context or the presence of a limiting adverb, however, clarifies the tem- poral meaning of a verb if something other than the simple past is meant. Although critics and translators of poetry have sometimes opted for pluperfect translations in a clause where nothing marks the verb as something other than the simple past, Mitchell argues that the burden of proof is on those who claim that the pluperfect is meant {Old English Syntax , § 644). In a riddle, however, are overt markers for perfect or pluperfect constructions necessarily to be expected, when the whole art of the riddle is to deceive? No linguistic 'facts' determine the answer to this question. We have a choice of interpretative options, and our choice determines a semantic context wherein the action of the verb is to be understood.

Wentersdorf, The Situation of the Narrator in the Old English Wife's Lamenť, Speculum 56 (1981), 492-516, repr. in Old English Shorter Poems: Basic Readings, ed. K.

The answer is philologically exact. No word has been twisted from its literal meaning or used in a special sense, apart from appropriate metaphorical extension. The answer is complete and self -consistent. Every word of the riddle, every image, has been accounted for in a manner that is free of contradiction. I hope that the answer is elegant , but of that the reader has to judge. What of its contextual fit ? Is the proposed solution anachronistic, genetically scandalous, or otherwise mon- strous on contextual grounds? Absolutely not. None of the conventions of the riddle genre is violated by this solution, and some are aptly fulfilled. The solver's first task was to reject overly literal interpretations and thereby to crack into the tiddler's system of metaphor and personification. The next task was to think historically: what relevant class of object was made from a living thing during the Anglo-Saxon period? The answer fairly leapt forth when we looked at the riddle's exact wording, with its sundry verbs of motion and its 'hoar-headed woman'. A bizarre bundle of contradictions soon resolved into a familiar object. Although I suspect that ocean-going ships were as special and unusual to most Anglo-Saxon villagers as bullet trains are to most English farmers today, they were well known. As for the oak, it was literally one of the building-blocks of the Anglo-Saxons' world. It was as natural to their surroundings as humming- birds were to Emily Dickinson's garden. And the idea of a tree being cut down and transformed into an object of some kind is clearly one that poets of this time delighted in. As a way of clinching this argument, let me add two final pieces of evidence that will confirm the ťoak/ ship' solution through the comparative method that was championed long ago by Tupper82 and that remains a keystone of the riddle- solver's art. The first exhibit pertains to runology - another kind of riddling, as we have seen. The transformation of oak tree into ship that is the subject of Riddle 74 is not unique to that poem. It also serves as the organizing principle of stanza 25 of the Rune Poem. The author's strategy in that poem is first to give the symbol for each rune in the futhorc, then to provide a short verse passage that begins with that rune-name and that tells us something more about the item that is named. Here is the passage on the ac rune:83 82 Tupper begins his learned discussion of the Exeter Book riddles with a section on The Comparative Study of Riddles' (pp. xi-xxvi), berating prior scholars for neglecting this aspect of their subject. 83 The Old English Rune Poem: a Critical Edition , ed. M. Halsall (Toronto, 1981), p. 92: The oak is food for flesh [i.e. yields acorns to feed swine] for the children of men; often it travels over the ganneťs bath [the ocean]; the open sea tests whether the oak keeps good faith.' In her com- mentary on this stanza (p. 153), Halsall notes that 'the oak becomes a kind of amphibian', for it both stands on eorpan (on earth) and moves ofer gañotes bap (upon the sea). She also notes that seafaring is traditionally described in 'somewhat heroic terminology'. 193</page><page sequence="26">John D. Niles tT (ac) by)? on eorpan elda bearnum flaesces fodor; fere]? gelome ofer gañotes bxp; - garsecg fanda]? hwaeper ac haebbe xpeìc treowe. We see the oak tree in two moments of its existence: first in the woods, where it provides food for pigs,84 and then turned into the timber of a ship that traverses the high seas, just as in Riddle 74. By synecdoche, the ac ťoak wood' is the ship itself. The second exhibit relates direcdy to this same stanza. As Paul Sorrell has pointed out,85 stanza 25 of the Rune Poem is not only riddle-like in its structure. It is the next thing to a true riddle, for it represents an Anglo-Saxon analogue to an international riddle-type that is discussed as number 828 in Archer Taylor's standard collection English Riddles from Oral Tradition .86 This riddle-type has been recorded from Lithuania to Jamaica. Sorrell traces it as far back in time as a seventh-century Latin collection from Bobbio, northern Italy. Since Aldhelm is believed to have known this collection,87 it is possible to suppose a direct line of influence from the Bobbio text to the Rune Poem and the Exeter Book, although nothing in my argument depends on the ascription of either of these Old English texts to a specific source. What is important is that the folk riddle that underlies stanza 25 of the Rune Poem and that is worked into complex literary form in Exeter Book Riddle 74 has long been common currency in the West. Folk riddles of Taylor type 828 are usually put into the voice of an imagined speaker, who declares one or another variation on the theme "When I was alive, I fattened the living. Dead, I carried the living.'88 A Latvian version omits the feeding motif and dispenses with the first-person singular mode of address but still draws attention to the towering tree that is the material source of the ship: 'Living, it bears a green crown. Dead, it bears the living.'89 Riddle-type 828 has many variant forms, but its regular answer is 'ship' or 'boat', a vessel that is made of dead wood and transports living people. The popularity of this international riddle type indicates a measure of 'folk' consent to the paradoxical wisdom that Anne Michaels ascribes to the character named Athos in her novel Fugitive Pieces*. 'The great mystery of wood is not that it burns, but that it floats'.90 84 This subject is frequently represented in medieval manuscript illustrations of the labours of the months; for Anglo-Saxon examples, see J. C. Webster, The Labors of the Month in Antique and Medieval Art (Evanston, IL, 1938), pp. 53-5, with pl. 33b, item 3 (showing September from London, BL, Cotton Julius A. vi) and pl. 34b, item 3 (showing September from London, BL, Cotton Tiberius B. v). 85 Sorrell, 'Oaks, Ships, Riddles'. 86 A.Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley, CA, 1951), pp. 309-1 1: 'The Dead Bears the Living: A Ship'. 87 Sorrell, 'Oaks, Ships, Riddles', p. 104 and n. 8. 88 A Lithuanian example, from Taylor, English Riddles , p. 309. 89 Ibid. p. 310. 90 A. Michaels, Fugitive Pieces (London, 1998), p. 28. 194</page><page sequence="27">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text This connection between Exeter Book Riddle 74 and Taylor riddle-type 828 is instructive from the hermeneutical perspective that was adopted earlier in this paper, for it neatly illustrates the point that the process of reading riddles - which is essentially the same process as problem-solving in general, if that prior argument is accepted - is an intellectual adventure that oscillates between a per- ceived problem, a set of critical assumptions, an imagined solution to that problem, and a set of tests, with each element in this web of relationships remaining subject to modification in a process of feedback. Under the name ťthe hermeneutical circle', this process of oscillating between assumptions and tentative conclusions is sometimes condemned as if it were a cycle to be escaped, when what it amounts to is the essential means by which human beings gain experiential knowledge in the world. As Paul Ricoeur has emphasized, the process of textual interpretation is never mechanical; rather it is a complex pro- visional enterprise that is grounded and humanized in moments of personal commitment:91 Understanding is entirely mediated by the whole of explanatory procedures that precede it and accompany it . . . We are not allowed to exclude the final act of personal commitment from the whole of objective and explanatory procedures that mediate it . . . The 'hermeneutical circle' . . . remains an insuperable structure of knowledge when it is applied to human things, but this qualification prevents it from being a vicious circle. To keep to Riddle 74 as an example of this hermeneutical process: once one accepts 'ship' as a possible solution to the riddle, then one is in a position to per- ceive it as a special example of a large class of similar riddles; and once this taxonomical triumph is achieved, then new insight follows that affects the con- tours of the problem itself. Line 5 of the Old English text can now be read in a different light, with the noun ferö taken in the plural and the verb hcefde read in a pluperfect sense. The phrase hcefde ferö cwicu can now be read as 'I contained living spirits.'92 This meaning is undoubtedly the 'right' one from a comparative perspective, for in Taylor riddle type 828 the 'dead' carries the 'quick', that is, the ship carries people. If no editor or translator of Riddle 74 (except for Trautmann, in his own way) has opted for such a translation of hcefde ferö cwicu, that fact is not surprising, for no one yet either has entertained 'ship' as a solu- tion or has noted the parallel with riddle type 828. In other words, here is an instance where Ricoeur's philosophy of interpretation is confirmed and where 91 P. Ricoeur, The Model of the Text: Meaningful Action Considered as a Texť, in his From Text to Action: Essays in Hermeneutics, //, trans. K. Blarney and J. B. Thompson (London, 1991), pp. 144-69, at 169. 92 For this observation I am indebted to my former student Mary Bucholtz, who arrived at this insight before I had become aware of international riddle-type 828. 195</page><page sequence="28">John D. Niles the comparative method in riddle analysis can offer a hint, and possibly even a correction, to textual philology.93 I have no wish to push this plural reading of line 5 to the exclusion of the equally valid singular reading CI had a living spirit'. As we have seen, the latter reading encodes an important clue to the speaker's identity as an artefact made from what was once a living thing. What I do mean to suggest is that artful ambiguity is present in the grammar of line 5, just as artful ambiguity concern- ing gender is found in lines 1-2. A plurality of possible answers concerning the number of ferd in question is consistent with the riddler's mission of tripping readers up while teasing them with wisps and fragments of a solution, thus forcing only half-hearted acts of interpretative commitment on the part of a reader who remains perplexed. RIDDLING OUT IMPLICATIONS Before concluding this essay I wish to develop two points of interest that have been raised only glancingly thus far. First, through their teasing rhetorical strat- egies, how do Riddle 74 and the other riddles of the Exeter Book illustrate the ludic vein in poetry in general? And second, through their commonplace sub- jects and their arresting use of metaphorical imagery, how do the riddles serve as a microcosm of the Anglo-Saxon thoughtworld? In the early medieval context, the distinction between literary riddles and 'folk' riddling is actually more problematic than I have made it appear. On one hand, the Exeter Book riddles come down to us only as written texts. The voices of their posers, assuming there once were posers, cannot now be heard. On the other hand, Old English poetry in general was meant to be voiced aloud. It was a social medium to its core. Poets maintained the trope of bodily presence and physical voice long after Old English verse had devel- oped from its oral roots and had become a supple medium for writers. Very often, Anglo-Saxon poets use the rhetoric of an oral/aural mode of address when there can be no question of speakers being present.94 Poetry, like rid- dling, thus presents itself rhetorically as a public and interactive form of communication even when we encounter it on the manuscript page. From a sociological perspective, Old English poetry uses the language of metaphor 93 Since the comparative method as used here depends on the work of folklorists, my results give reason to question the claim that the relevance of late medieval, renaissance, or early modern English folklore to Old English riddles is 'doubtful at besť (Williamson, Old English Riddles , p. 22). 94 W. Parks comments on this oxymoron of 'speaking books' in his fine article 'The Traditional Narrator and the "I Heard" Formulas in Old English Poetry', ASE 16 (1987), 45-66; cf. J. M.

They are artful in their use of alliteration and other aural effects, as Andy Orchard has shown with reference to Riddle 74.98 They use the conven- tional figures of rhetoric (or at least the figures of rhetoric can be traced in them, whether or not consciously deployed).99 More than half the riddles use direct first-person address, as poetry in the lyric mode traditionally does.100 Above all, the riddles are flamboyant in their display of figurative language. Their soul is metaphor. They thrive on personification and paradox. Some of them have an extraordinary exuberance, as do the storm riddles (nos. 1- 3 = Wl), which Charles W. Kennedy praises extravagandy as examples of the poet's 95 R. Abrahams, 'The Literary Study of the Riddle', Texas Stud, in Ut. and Uing. 14 (1972), 1 77-97, argues strongly that social riddling is a group enterprise, a test of wits that is open to all members of a community, as opposed to its being a test of knowledge that is directed to an elite, as some have claimed. 96 Arguments along this line have been opened up by J. F. Adams, The Anglo-Saxon Riddle as Lyric Mode', Criticism 7 (1965), 335-48, and M. Marino, The Literariness of the Exeter Book Riddles', NM79 (1978), 258-65. 97 Williamson (pp. 25-6), following earlier editors and commentators, distinguishes two main kinds of Old English riddle: one that begins with the conventional opening Iceom or Ic was and one that begins typically with Ic seah or Icgefragn or Wiht is. Needless to say, these markers are not sufficient to identify a riddle as such. Some riddles lack them, while the same phrases occur in poems that are not riddles. All scholars agree that riddles either state or imply a question, but that does not take us far toward a definition. 98 A.

Niles art.101 F. H. Whitman writes with similar enthusiasm about Riddle 5 (W3), which has the answer 'shield'. In his view, this riddle 'seems to have become more than itself, in its emotional life more a poem, with the riddling properties delegated to a position of secondary importance'.102 The fact that Whitman can speak of this riddle as having an 'emotional life' tells us much about the unusual degree of poetic animation to be found in this genre. The Exeter Book riddles are not just versified social riddles; they push the language of Old English poetry to its very limits. Given this similarity between the art of the riddles and the art of Old English poetry in general, questions have naturally arisen concerning the genre of the poems that are inscribed in the later parts of the Exeter Book. Some scholars have wondered which riddles are really riddles, since some of them seem to give their answers away. Other poems in this section of the manuscript are riddle-like and yet lack the specific turns of phrase (such as saga hweet ic hatte 'say what I am called*) that mark out a riddle as such. Riddle 60 (W58), for example, which begins Ic wees he sonde scewealle neah ('I stood on the sand close by the sea-wall'), has sometimes been classed as a lyric monologue (or part of a lyric monologue) as opposed to a riddle. The poetic monologue that immediately follows it, The Husbanďs Message , has sometimes been classed as a riddle or a cluster of riddles.103 Various readers have regarded Wulf and Eadwacer as a riddle. Anne Klinck likens it to the riddles on the basis of 'its brevity, its cryptic style, and its use of animals'.104 Arnold E. Davidson has suggested that, though not techni- cally a riddle, Wulf and Eadwaceris meant to be deciphered on the basis of hints and allusions: 'the very fact that the poem can be read in so many different ways suggests that it might be ambiguous and perhaps deliberately so'.105 Interpretations of Deor ; too, 'tend to view the poem as a puzzle to be solved'.106 The riddling qualities of The Ruin are familiar to its readers: the 'answer' to that poem has been thought to be the ruins of Bath, but that specific place-name is nowhere mentioned and may be deliberately suppressed. The Wife's Lament , too, 101 'Nowhere else in Old English verse do we find a treatment of natural phenomena comparable in length, realism, or descriptive skill': C. W.

Wentersdorf still advocates reading that poem as if it were a riddle: 'Today's reader seems compelled ... to select one of a number of possible versions of the story line if there is to be a coherent evaluation of the poem as a work of art', he writes.108 In other words, first you read The Wife's Lament and opt for one of its possible plots, then you experiment with the implications of your choice and evaluate how coherent they are. This is the method of riddle-solving - and, as we have seen, of interpretation in general109 - with the difference that with the riddles, one posits a single item-as-answer rather than a life story. Many of the speakers of the riddles, however, tell their own life-story in brief, so that this distinction can break down. Not just poems in the immediate manuscript context of the riddles flaunt an enigmatic quality. Poems from earlier parts of the Exeter Book partake of it as well. Benjamin Thorpe, the book's first modern editor, lamented that a number of these poems rely on, yet withhold, special knowledge that would render their meaning accessible. He found Widsith 'eminently calculated to excite, without gratifying, curiosity', while The Wandererht found 'isolated, apart from every his- toric or legendary notice' that might explain it.110 The Seafarer , too, is notoriously enigmatic for its use of a system of paranomasia whereby words such as dryhten 'lord' and dreamas 'joys' are first used in a secular context and then in a spiritual one, where their sense is transformed. Guessing the literal subject of The Seafarer is much like guessing the answer to a riddle. The inclusion of a series of such texts in the Exeter Book suggests, though it cannot prove, that the compiler of that anthology had a fondness for poetry that offered a challenge to the reader and that in some way had to be 'solved'. Certainly it is an interesting fact that the riddles of the Exeter Book are untitled, and hence offer a genuine experience of mystification, whereas their Latin analogues are titled and thus hand their 107 F.

He accepts that different interpreters may opt for different initial stances, so that all that is available to them in the end is consistency within a system, not absolute truth. By arguing that one's initial choice of assumptions is an ethical act that may have political consequences, he aligns himself with Hirsch (and, with lesser emphasis, Ricoeur) as opposed to Fish. One could regard Armstrong's book as an effort to rationalize and humanize what could otherwise be a distaste- fully narcissistic relativism. 110 B. Thorpe, Codex Exoniensis, p. viii. More recently R. North, discussing the genre of The Wanderer , has concluded that 'riddle' seems 'a good term for this poem of a notably veiled allu- sive style': see his 'Boethius and the Mercenary in The Wanderet* , Pagans and Christians-, the Interplay between Christian Latin and Traditional Germanic Cultures in Early Medieval Europe , ed.

If the compiler of the Exeter Book did have a taste for the enig- matic, then that person probably shared a set of aesthetic assumptions that were held widely in Anglo-Saxon times. The Dream of the Rood (from the Vercelli Book) and the Rune Poem (from a manuscript destroyed in 1731) are only two examples, among many that could be cited, of poems from other manuscript sources that pose a deliberate challenge to the reader, withholding basic information that has to be guessed.111 Only certain Old English poems are true riddles, but any number challenge readers to use their wits and make use of their prior knowledge in extraordinary ways. The experience of reading and solving the Exeter Book riddles is thus very much like that of reading practically any Old English poem. Not just from a rhetorical perspective but also from a phenomenological one, riddles are a dis- tillation of the poetic art. This is not to deny their special generic characteristics. Riddles require a single answer that can be declared either ťrighť or 'wrong', for example, while other poems ask for more complex or nuanced responses. Still, guessing the answer to a riddle is not the end of things; it is rather more like their start. After the riddles have been solved', as has been noted more than once, 'they become most interesting'.112 Once you find what seems to be the answer, you go back through the text, testing your answer against every detail and exam- ining both that text and your own ordinary conceptual categories according to the insights that are provoked by your answer. This is essentially what we do when reading any demanding text. The result of this process of mental explora- tion is a revised knowledge of the world and of one's place in it. J. R. Hall has described this process well, speaking of the enigmatic art of the Old English 111 Both of these poems have been linked with the riddles. M. Irvine examines The Dream of the Rood as a riddle-like text in 'Anglo-Saxon Literary Theory Exemplified in Old English Poems: Interpreting the Cross in The Dream of the Road and Elene' Old English Shorter Poems, ed. O'Brien O'Keeffe, pp. 31-63, at 35-8. M. Halsall, in her edition of The Old English Rune Poem , pp. 25-6 and 85, concludes that the lost original of that poem did not include the names of the runes. If this reasonable surmise is correct, then a member of the original audience could not have read the poem correcdy without a prior knowledge of runes. The poem would thus have been an exercise in cryptography, on top of its other challenges. 112 E. T. Hansen, The Solomon Complex: Reading Wisdom in Old English Poetry (Toronto, 1988), p. 127, paraphrasing M. Marino, 'The Literariness of the Exeter Book Riddles', p. 259. Throughout ch. 5 of her book (pp. 1 26-52), Hansen discusses the art of the Exeter Book riddles not with an eye to their solutions, but rather as poems with conventional features and as an ostensible speech situa- tion. She likens them to the charms, in particular, as well as to the wisdom debate or monologue, and she discusses these genres within the general context of 'wisdom literature', a class of writ- ings that she sees as challenging the normal categories through which people construct reality. Similarly, W. Tigges, 'Snakes and Ladders: Ambiguity and Coherence in the Exeter Book Riddles and Maxims', Companion to Old English Poetry , ed. Aertsen and Bremmer, pp. 95-118, compares riddles and maxims as two entries to a single body of knowledge and set of perceptions. It may be asked to what extent the qualities that Hansen and others associate with 'wisdom literature' are confined to that class of writings or are characteristic of poetry in general. 200</page><page sequence="33">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text Rune Poem : ťLike a riddle-master, the rune-poet uses wordplay, antithesis, and ambiguity to challenge the reader to enlarge his perspective and deepen his sensitivity to the world in which he lives and moves and has his being/113 The power that Hall ascribes to the rune-poet or that other writers have ascribed to the riddle-master, I suggest, is no different from what is deployed by the poets of the Exeter Book in general.114 When we first approach a poem like Wulf and Eadwacer or The Seafarer or The Dream of the Rood , we are likely to be baffled by the way it plunges us into the midst of an unknown scene. Then at some point in our reading, if all goes well, we realize what scene is invoked, what plot is unfolding, what imagined subject is being addressed. Armed with this knowledge (or, more cautiously, furnished with this hypothesis), we then go back to the beginning of the poem and read through it again, now under- standing it with pleasure if our proposed 'answer' works out, perhaps still enjoy- ing a stringent hermeneutical challenge if it does not. What I am suggesting is that there is much to be gained from considering Old English poetry in general as a form of play. Again and again, at every level of this poetry from the kenning to the story line, one can see the workings of the 'double task of revealing and concealing'115 that is the special mode of the riddles. To speak of poetry as play is not a new departure, of course. Johan Huizinga described poetry in terms of game theory nearly fifty years ago in his classic study Homo Ludens , which called attention to the origins of culture itself in play.116 More recendy Wolfgang Iser has mounted a similar argument from a contemporary phenomenological perspective. In his view, 'authors play games with readers, and the text is the playground'.117 The formalized structures of poetry - the special diction, syntax and rhetoric that are characteristic of all poetic languages - serve to open up the play space. Conventional formulas, such as ic was, icseah , icgehyrde or we gefrugnon in the Old English context, announce the start of the game. The disfigurement of language that is such an overt and pleasurable part of much archaic and medieval poetry, alienating verse from the language of everyday life, alerts readers that a ritualized ludic activity has begun. The process of reading a literary text of any kind is thus an activity akin to what 113 J. R. Hall, 'Perspective and Wordplay in the Old English Rune Poerrì , Neophilologus 61 (1977), 453-60, at 458. 1 14 The Rune Poem is riddle-like but is not part of the Exeter Book. On the other hand, some of the poems included in the Exeter Book are not particularly enigmatic. My generalization therefore applies not to this one poetic codex, but rather to a type of poetry that is commonly practised there and that is sometimes practised elsewhere. 115 Nelson, The Rhetoric of the Exeter Book Riddles', p. 424. 116 J.

On pp. 1 56-8 Huizinga discusses riddles and poetry as two closely related forms of expression. 117 W. Iser, Prospecting.

Niles children or any of us do in rule-governed games, where the object is not simply to win or lose but rather to extend ourselves, through imaginative role-playing, into new configurations of reality. conclusion: poetry as evidence for worldview My argument thus far can be summarized as follows. Although social riddling is sometimes dismissed as a mere pastime, the Anglo-Saxon literary riddle can be regarded as a kind of 'pure' poetry that depends for its effect less on its readers getting the right answer than on their engagement with the poetics of riddle production. Paradoxically, through phrases like saga hwcet ic hatte ťsay what my name is' - as if a flesh-and-blood person were in a position to hear this command and respond to it - the literary riddles of the Exeter Book make strong gestures toward face-to-face communication. In this regard the riddles are no different from Old English poetry in general, which regularly 'speaks' to its 'audience' as if it were being voiced aloud in a social situation. In its brevity, its use of the first-person voice, and its reliance on metaphor, personification and paradox, Riddle 74 is a distillation of the Anglo-Saxon poetic art - an art that thrives on the fiction that it is a gift of words, an act of verbal exchange. Since written literature has never wholly shed this underlying fiction of orality,118 the process of reading the Exeter Book riddles thus typifies the process of reading poetry in general. No matter if we are reading Riddle 74 or The Dream of the Rood , Dickinson's poem '1463' or any of a number of other modern lyrics. Whatever poem we turn to, to the extent that the author addresses an imagined audience and conceals as he or she reveals, we are invited to take part in a play of the text that stretches our intellectual faculties beyond their usual limits. It is only to be expected that the criteria by which we can rea- sonably judge correctness in riddling are no different from the criteria by which interpretations of any kind can be tested. Riddles are not unique. In their compactness, they provide an entry to the most basic hermeneutical issues. The last point that I wish to make, even if briefly, is that study of the riddles has much to contribute to our understanding of the worldview of the Anglo- Saxons. Since 'worldview' is not a term in common parlance among medieval- ists, the sense in which I am using it should be explained. Anthropologists and folklorists have long been accustomed to analysing what is special about a people's 'oudook on life,' cWeltanschauun¿ , or 'vision of the world'. As is now recognized, study of a people's 'oudook on life' also includes 118 We still routinely speak of an author's 'audience', for example, as if readers were listening to speech rather than deciphering visual glyphs. Some modern authors (like Henry Fielding in Tom Jones) address the reader familiarly, as if in personal conversation, thus adapting a 'listener- response' rhetoric that has long been conventional in sermons, as in the prologues and epi- logues of plays. 202</page><page sequence="35">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text how they themselves are implicated in the world that they perceive and that they partially construct through their imaginings. The present concept of 'world- view' thus encompasses a people's strategies of selfhood as well as their concept of all that constitutes external reality. It is widely assumed that worldview is pat- terned, not random, and that all the elements of a culture that are open to schol- arly analysis, including 'kinship data, grammar, child-rearing details, agricultural techniques, or any one of a thousand bits and pieces of culture' (to quote Alan Dundes),119 are potentially subsumed in this patterning, though the place of every detail in this scheme may not be equally clear. Worldview is largely invis- ible to those who share it, for people do not normally have an anthropologist's vantage point on their own culture and cannot easily stand outside their own mind in order to observe it. For scholars of cultures that are remote from us either spatially (for example, the Fiji Islands) or temporally (for example, Anglo- Saxon England), the value of studying worldview is twofold. First, it may promote insight into those bedrock structures of thought and feeling that form the basis of private identity and that justify the institutions of social power in any given time and place. Second, it may enhance understanding of any one element of culture - this hoe, this festival, or this text - by showing how that detail is expressive of a much larger system. Pardy because of their utterly mundane literal content, pardy because of their flamboyant use of figures of speech, the Exeter Book riddles provide an illuminating entry to the worldview of the Anglo-Saxons. More than any other documents from their dme, they play with the bric-à-brac of daily life. They give life to things that are so often seen that they are no longer seen. As has long been recognized, the riddles 'stand forth as the most important con- temporary contributions to our knowledge of the everyday life of their time'.120 They evoke image after image that has no place in the loftier world of heroic poetry or scriptural narrative: the four teats of the milch-cow, for example, or the pedlar's pack of wares. Wim Tigges claims that in their 1,630 lines of verse - five per cent of the extant Old English poetic corpus - riddles constitute ' the environment of images par excellence ' of the earliest English 119 A.

Other influential studies of world- view include R. Redfield, 'Primitive World View and Civilization', in his The Primitive World and its Transformations (Ithaca, NY, 1953), pp. 84-1 10, and C.

Tupper, p. lxxxvi. 203</page><page sequence="36">John D, Niles poetry.121 It is thus to the riddles that one naturally turns if one wishes to dis- cover how the Anglo-Saxons thought and felt about the basic elements of their lifeworld. The riddles remind us that no object is merely an object. When singled out by a poet's or artist's attention, an ordinary thing becomes luminous with spirit. Very often it takes on a human face and form. This is what happens in the riddles, where ťdeaď objects speak about their lot in terms that living people will under- stand. By endowing with soulful sentience a single reed growing by the shore, for example, a poet not only imparts information about the natural world but also communicates human feelings of loneliness. Sometimes the emotions that are lodged in the riddles can only be recognized if one has competence in the power relations that shaped the Anglo-Saxon social world. The riddles stress lordship, obedience, fear. They dwell on the service of man to master.122 Whitman sees in them a 'preoccupation with valor and suffering' that matches their concern with 'the spirit of comitatus'.123 As Tigges has remarked, the riddles thus have a social function, for they 'confirm the social relationships of their day by metaphorically applying these to randomly presented phenomena or objects'.124 Edward B. Irving, Jr, agrees that useful information can be extracted from study of the riddles.125 By 'useful information' he is not only speaking of ornithology, leather-working, the technology of script and coundess other aspects of the Anglo-Saxons' material world. He also means information with a bearing on the history of human sensibility, particularly among people of ordi- nary status. If we take the anthropomorphic figures of the riddles as surrogates for real people, then the riddles have much to say about downtrodden members of society. There is the battered shield who is beaten down without heroic recourse in Riddle 5 (W3), for example; or there is the female fox or badger of Riddle 15 (W13), who runs and hides and fights desperately to defend its young; or there is the sword of Riddle 20 (W18), who is a peerless warrior and yet also, in Irving's view, 'a vain and swaggering murderer, shielded by the protection of an indulgent patron' (p. 205). These poems give shelter to elements that find no place in the Anglo-Saxon heroic world. Irving sees in the riddles a robust cyn- icism that complements the effulgent surfaces of war and weaponry that are held up for admiration in such poems as Beowulf and Waldere. 121 Bigges, 'Snakes and Ladders', p. 95, with reference to a phrase, 'environment of images', that A.

Virtually everything that they name has a function. What the riddles prize above all is the way things turn to the welfare of humankind. Rarely is the 'raw' stuff of nature introduced (a deer's anders, an ox's hide) without its being brought into relation to the 'cooked' elements of culture (a pair of inkwells, a set of leather goods). The riddles thus domesticate the wild and the natural and turn it to human use. As anthropologists have stressed, it is in part through posing and solving riddles that people test the conceptual boundaries of their world, rendering abstract relations concrete and endowing common things with sentience. Through such games, people construct the world of thought and feeling that they inhabit.126 By composing and interpreting poetry in general, people do much the same thing. The Anglo-Saxons were no different from ourselves in that regard. Their riddles - and their poetic texts in general - not only mirror a world; they constitute a mental world as well. Riddle 74 can serve as an example of this cosmoplastic tendency. Basic fea- tures of the Anglo-Saxon worldview are on display here in a mere five lines of verse. A speaker celebrates its free movement in the open air, on the sea, and on the earth. What if the speaker is a ship? Cannot a ship, like a person, delight in the power of motion? A ship is not only mobile, however; it is also cenlic. It is a singularly beautiful (and expensive) product of craftsmanship. As such, it shouts out its owner's wealth and social status. The ship is not solely admired as artefact and symbol, however. It is also seen in relation to the stuff out of which it was made: the living oak tree out of which it was hewn by the woodsman's effort and the carpenter's skill. That oak tree too is presented in anthropomorphic terms. She is a woman who has grown from slender, vir- ginal youth to grey-headed old age. The epithet feaxhar with which the speaker's life as a mature tree is evoked reveals the poet's eye for an aged oak as an observable thing in nature, variegated in appearance. Nature, material culture and human spirit here cohabit a single body. Moreover, delight in the physical world is consistent with an appreciation of mutability. Through its paradoxes, the riddle neatly expresses the impending presence of death in life, the lingering traces of life in death, the constant inconstancy of earthly things. Equally typically, Riddle 74 is self-conscious about its own use of lan- guage. It plays with grammatical duplicity as well as with metaphor. Riddle 74 thus explores the ways in which, in sites opened up by its inevitable ambigu- 126 See M. D. Lieber, 'Riddles, Cultural Categories, and World View ']nl of Amer. Folklore 89 (1976), 255-65. Barley, 'Structural Aspects of the Anglo-Saxon Riddle', writes about riddles from an anthropological perspective with attention to their world-building capabilities, as does I. Hamnett, 'Ambiguity, Classification and Change: the Function of Riddles', Man ns 2 (1967), 379-92. 205</page><page sequence="38">John D, Niles ities, speech enables the language-user to flirt with the actions and things that words denote. In sum, even the five lines of Riddle 74 point unerringly to how the Anglo- Saxons conceived of a human being as a creature who delights in physical move- ment and dreads confinement, who uses the divine gift of language to speak the world into both 'real' and contrary- to- fact configurations, who identifies aes- thetic beauty with the craftsmanship that shapes the things of nature into new forms, who sees the whole of nature as a field for human use , who seeks to control both the external world and other human beings through exercise of the art/wealth/power nexus, and who freely acknowledges, for good and for ill, both the mutability of existence and the liberating potential in things whereby the future is latent in the present, like the idea of a spear or a plank embedded in a tree, while the past continues to reside in the present, as happens on every occa- sion when the poet or seer breaks into speech or the author lifts his pen. These conceptions (and others like them) were not unique to the Anglo-Saxons, of course. To some degree, though not to the extent that we may naively think, they are perhaps 'simply human'. Still the strong effort of scholarship should always be to historicize such conceptions as 'reality', 'the world', or 'human nature' so as to expose them as aspects of worldview - that is, as period-specific creations of language that become accepted so widely that they achieve the status simply of truth. Whether or not there is merit in the argument that poetry itself is a form of riddling play, whether or not anyone will sign up for my four-step programme for validity in interpretation, and whether or not the claim is persuasive that even one very short poem can encode essential elements of the Anglo-Saxon world- view, I hope that readers have profited from the exercise of close reading that has been undertaken here. Among the pleasures of reading the poetry of any period is that provided by close scrutiny of a single text. Sometimes, as with poets of the stature of Dickinson, the pleasures of reading increase in proportion to the chal- lenge a text provides. Since the Exeter Book riddles are not only artful but, taken collectively, have been called 'certainly the most difficult text in the field of Anglo-Saxon',127 their pleasures for some readers must be substantial. Even if, for reasons that I cannot anticipate, my proposed 'oak-boat' solution to Riddle 74 is rejected, I hope that the process of playing with that text may still have been rewarding, with its byways among grammar and semantics, birds and boats, metaphors and metamorphoses. Some readers who delight in open-end- edness may even be content to leave Riddle 74 unsolved, for opting for one interpretation naturally means opting out of others. As Iser remarks, any deci- sion about the meaning of a text 'will eclipse coundess aspects brought to view 127 Riddles of the Exeter Book, ed. Tupper, p. vii. 206</page><page sequence="39">Exeter Book Riddle 74 and the play of the text by the constantly shifting, constantly interacting and hence kaleidoscopically iterating positions of the game, so that the game itself runs counter to its being brought to an end'.128 In other words, the process of playing the Exeter Book game may be more fun than winning it. If the solution that I have offered gains enough converts to pass Armstrong's 'intersubjectivity' test, however, then a degree of closure will have been brought to a mental contest that has baffled some very learned and thoughtful people over the past 150 years. We will have unriddled the quick and the dead; and that, I think, is enough for one article. 128 Iser, Prospecting , p. 252. Addendum . I regret that D. Donoghue's study 'An Anser for Exeter Book Riddle 74', Words and Works ; Studies in Medieval Language and Literature in Honour of Fred C Robinson , ed. P. S. Baker and N. Howe (Toronto, 1998), pp. 45-58, appeared in print too late for discussion here. 207</page></plain_text>
