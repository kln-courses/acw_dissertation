<plain_text><page sequence="1">Principium Sapientiae : The Origins of Greek Philo- sophical Thought. By F. M. CORNFORD. Pp. viii + 271. Cambridge: University Press, 1951. 25s. This is a posthumous work of its lamented author, prepared for the press and given a brief summary at the end by Mr. W. K. C. Guthrie. It fortunately is nearly enough complete for its main contentions at all events to be adequately set forth and the evidence for them presented, though doubtless not so fully as Cornford would have done had he lived to complete his book. Its central thesis is that behind the different, often even hostile figures of philosopher, diviner, and poet there lies one figure, the prehistoric sage, who by virtue of his inspiration claimed to know past, present, and future, therefore to be able to tell, in the imaginative and poetical form which was his inevitable medium, of the origins of the world, of all history, and of what was to come. Not till later-the cleavage of poet and seer is complete by Homer's day--do we find his functions divided between the philosopher, or his forerunner the thinker of Hesiodic type, with his physical speculations, the epic poet with his narrative, and the professional diviner to whom the speculations of the philosopher are often hateful. The book is divided into two sections, of which the first, Empiricism versus Inspiration, contrasts the attitude of the Ionian physicists and their successors with that of the medical writers. The former seem to have made no use of experiment whatever, the alleged examples of experiment proving on inspection to be mere illustrations drawn from well-known phenomena of every- day experience, not from manipulations like those of a modern laboratory. The latter were gradually building up an applied science, the only one in antiquity (p. 43), and perforce experi- mented in their attempts to cure disease, thus developing a really scientific technique. The philosophical attitude finds its fullest development in Platonism, with its emphasis on the non-material as the only true object of knowledge, while the empirical theory developed by medical research was founded on the data of sense (pp. 62-3). All this is interestingly de- veloped in the first five chapters, which lead up to the proposi- tion (p. 87) that not only Plato but so different a thinker as Demokritos stand in the succession of the single figure who was at once poet, prophet, and sage. What he was like is discussed in Chapter VI, which briefly sketches shamanism. The next three chapters show the philosopher replacing the seer-poet (Herakleitos, Parmenides, and Empedokles furnish illustra- tions), the conflict between seer and philosopher and that between philosopher and poet. Part II deals with the question of what these early prophet- poets taught, i.e. what mythical conceptions lie behind the earliest attempts at a philosophical cosmology. The latter is illustrated (Chapter X) by the theories of Anaximandros; Chapter XI proceeds 'to distinguish those elements in it [sc., Anaximandros' system] which could be derived from immediate observation and those which must have been inherited from tradition ' (p. 187). The author then naturally goes to Hesiod for further guidance, with a side-glance at other mythical cosmogonies, such as that parodied by Aristophanes in the Birds, and develops at some length the parallels between the Hesiodic story and the tacit assumptions of the Ionians. Then he passes (Chapter XII) to what he not ineptly calls Hesiod's hymn to Zeus, meaning the story of the god's birth, growth, and attainment of sovranty as told in several passages of the Theogony. Now comes the really thorny question of the relation of all this, and of the wild tale of the mutilation of Uranos which precedes it, to the cosmogonic myths of other peoples, including, of course, the famous Maori parallel long ago drawn attention to by Andrew Lang. The conclusion, arrived at in the following chapters, is that the general outlines of the myth come from a widespread source, not, as Frazer once suggested in passing (p. 226), the creation of low savagery, but of comparatively advanced cultures, especially those of the Near East. These in turn (Chapter XIV) are closely connected with ritual, the annual or other periodical re-enactment of the creative process. Much of this is both true and worth setting forth in the per- suasive manner characteristic of the author. Hesiod in all probability had hold of a very old and foreign tale, to be paralleled especially in Babylonian tradition but also in other Oriental cultures, of how Heaven and Earth were separated, much as the Ionians supposed the elements which make up the universe to have been separated out from an undifferentiated primal substance like Anaximandros' &amp;reapov, and how the universe took form in the gulf formed between them, with the accompanying struggles between the newer powers, the gods familiar to the tellers of the story and practitioners of the rites, and formidable adversaries of some kind, Tiamat in Babylon, Typhoeus in Greece, and so forth. Many details, however, are doubtful. For instance, I am not convinced that there is any connexion between the castration of Uranos and that of the Galli (p. 2o8). The former I think to have no connexion with ritual, but rather to be the result of an early, and probably non- Hellenic, attempt to account for Uranos always staying where he is and never trying to renew his relations with his ancient consort the Earth. More serious is the false idea which Mr. Guthrie in his summary (p. 257) finds in Cornford's work (presumably in the rough notes, too imperfect to be worked up into chapters of the book, which he left behind), that anthropo- morphism is to be accounted for, principally if not always, by the figure of the divine king, or priest-king, who takes the part of the chief god in ritual. This is surely put out of court by the common occurrence of anthropomorphic gods among peoples who have no one at all resembling either a king or a chief priest. But these are subordinate matters; the positive value of the book is considerable, and many details which I have no space to examine here are well worthy of attention, since they are full of suggestions for a better understanding of the complex problems arising from the little-known relations between the various cultures of antiquity.
