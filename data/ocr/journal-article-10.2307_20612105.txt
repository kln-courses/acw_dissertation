<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mythology of the Indians in the Pacific Northwest* ELLA E. CLARK it T IS GOOD to tell myths in the winter time," the Indians of the Pacific Northwest used to say. "There are long nights 5 in the winter time." What was the subject matter of the tales which Indian child ren and Indian adults listened to so eagerly round the winter fires? Were they more than entertainment in the long winter evenings of the northern latitude? Did their stories, like the ancient Greek and Norse myths, reveal the life and thought, the social customs and religious concepts of the people who created them and who transmitted them from generation to generation? Not all of the many tribes that once lived in Old Oregon have been studied, and only a small proportion of the stories told by any one tribe have been published. But enough traditional tales have been preserved to indicate that certain mythological themes known the world over were used frequently by the native story tellers of this region. The creation of the world and of the tribe, the origin of fire, the Great Deluge that almost destroyed the ancient world-these familiar themes are frequent in the myths of the Pacific Northwest Indians. Creation myths are of great variety. In each, the "Creator" began with something already in existence. The Modoc of southern Oregon accounted for their origin in the same story in which the great Sky Spirit formed Mount Shasta by pushing snow and ice down through a hole in the sky. He planted the forests and made the streams on its slopes; he createdthe ocean seen from its summit. Through his daughter, who married the son of the Grizzly Bears, the Sky Spirit became the ancestor of all the Indians. This creation myth was recorded by Joaquin Miller. According to one collected by Jeremiah Curtin, Old Man of the Ancients made the Shasta, the Pitt River Indians, the Klamath, and his chosen people, the Modoc, from the bones of *This is the second of two articles.</page><page sequence="2">164 ELLA E. CLARK September the spirits which he brought up in a big basket from the under ground world of the spirits. The Okanogan Indians, according to a myth recorded by Alexander Ross more than a century ago, are the descendants of a giant couple who paddled to the mainland from a floating island, in the beginning of the world when the sun was young and no bigger than a star. In an Okanogan myth collected by the ethnographer James Teit, Old-One made the animals, birds, fishes, and ancient Indians from balls of mud. "The earth is our mother," for Old-One had made earth out of a woman. But most of the peoples living east of the Cascade Range, along the Columbia River and its tributaries, told a long and complicated tale about the creation of the first Indians from the body of a monster that Coyote slew because it was a menace to the ancients. A monster in Lake Cle Elum in the northern Cas cades, a monster along the Clearwater River in northern Idaho,' a giant beaver near the junction of the Palouse River and the Snake2-each of these, according to tales of several groups, was killed by Coyote. Then he cut up its body and from the appro priate parts made the different tribes and assigned to them their characteristic traits. Always the tribe telling the story was "the bravest and the smartest" of them all; always the waste material was hurled eastward over the mountains, to be turned into the Snake River Indians, "people of blood and violence." In one variant, the channels of the Yakima and Columbia rivers were formed during the struggle between Coyote and the monster, and the vast lake east of the Cascades was drained into the rivers. In a variant related by a man with mixed Chelan, Okanogan, and Moses-Columbia ancestry, the Creator made and named the ancient animal people: Grizzly Bear, Coyote, Wolf, Beaver, and the others. Long afterwards, in accordance with the prophecy of the Creator, the youngest of the four Wolf brothers killed the big Beaver that lived along the middle Columbia. From its body twelve tribes were made: the Methow from its heart, the Nez Perce from its liver, the Blackfeet from its blood, and so on. 1.

The origin of fire, another universal theme, is incidental in the best-known of the Bridge of the Gods legends; the only fire in the world was guarded on the bridge and was at last shared with the cold and hungry people. Several tribes along the northern shores of Puget Sound and in the adjacent areas told how Raven stole the fire and made it available to man, but the Lummi in the same region have a myth in which the Changer showed the people how to make fire by twirling certain kinds of sticks. The majority of fire myths follow one of two patterns: (1) Coyote and his followers, in a relay race away from the guardians of the sacred fire, brought some of it from the top of a high mountain or from the land of the Fire People;4 (2) the mythological people of the ancient world made an arrow ladder from sky to earth, climbed up to the sky world, and by trickery got some hot coals. By means of arrow ladders or ropes of arrows, the mythological people obtained also daylight, the sun, and the moon, and then regulated the heavenly bodies to their own satisfaction. There is infinite variety within the two patterns. Like the Hebrews, Babylonians, Greeks, Norsemen, and other peoples of the Old World, many Indian tribes of both North and South America had traditions of the Great Deluge. "When the earliest missionaries came among the Spokanes, Nez Perces, and Cayuses," wrote the Reverend Myron Eells in 1878, "they found that those Indians had their tradition of a flood, and that one man and his wife were saved on a raft. Each of those three tribes also, together with the Flathead tribes, had their separate Ararat in connection with this event." In the traditions of several tribes, he said, the flood was sent because the people were wicked.5 The Nez Perces who were saved had fled to a hollow bowl in the summit of a peak east of Kamiah, Idaho, according to one version; according to another, they took refuge on a mountain near Moscow, Idaho.

CLARK September implements have been found in both places, the Indians say, as well as horn spoons and other kinds of relics.6 In a tradition of the Flatheads of western Montana, the chief tried to stop the flood by shooting arrows from the lone peak where a few Indians had found refuge; the first two arrows floated away, but the third quivered in the earth at the edge of the waters. The flood immediately began to recede; some water remained where Flat head Lake is today.7 In a Puyallup flood myth, an old man and his family, on a raft, first touched land on top of a mountain; from there he sent out a crow, and he rejoiced when it brought back a leaf.8 On Mount Baker and on Mount Jefferson rested giant canoes in which a few people were saved from the flood waters; evidences of the canoes, some Indians say, can still be seen near the summits of these two peaks in the Cascade Range. In a Shasta myth, Mount Shasta was the Ararat for Coyote and his followers, who fled to its top. Mount Rainier is the Ararat in a flood myth which may have been altered somewhat after the Skokomish learned the Genesis story: a good man and his family, with all the good animals, were saved because of the warning and the aid of the "Great Spirit," who was angered by the wickedness of the people. Family and animals climbed to the top of Rainier on a ladder of arrows which the good man shot from the earth to a cloud. By breaking the ladder, he kept the bad animals from following him. That is why there are no snakes on Mount Rainier today! Thunderbird sent the flood once when he was very angry at the people, say the Hoh and Quileute of the Washington coast. To certain peaks in the Olympic Mountains, still pointed to by Indians, canoes filled with people were tied during the great flood. Set loose by ropes breaking or by rocks falling apart, some canoes drifted away and when the waters subsided, the people settled elsewhere. This accident is said to explain the similarities between the languages spoken by the Klallam and the Duwamish, by the Quileute and Chemakum, by the Skokomish and other Salish tribes.

Such tales are a small proportion of those published by anthropologists, but they predominate in those recorded by laymen. What proportion they form of the total body of Northwest mythology we can probably never know. Forty years ago, when Lucullus McWhorter, an honorary member of the Yakima tribe, was collecting myths about places along the Columbia, he sometimes received this reply: "No one living now knows all of that story. It isn't told any more. I will tell you all I can remember." Fortunately, army officers and surveyors in the Oregon Country, reservation doctors, a young soldier at Fort Klamath in 1865, some pioneer ranchers and housewives and editors, early teachers of history at Pacific University and at the University of Washing ton-these persons appreciated the imagination of a people without a written language and so recorded myths and legends the Indians told them about the mountains, lakes, rivers, rocks, and waterfalls seen on their travels or near their homes. Occasionally a white person was trusted with a sacred tradition, such as the myth of the origin of Crater Lake and the legend of Multnomah Falls. When steeped in the classical traditions, these pioneer writers often pointed out parallels between the oral literature of the Old World and that of the New World. II From these stories recorded by the pioneers and from those collected more recently by ethnographers we can learn a great deal about the native Indian mind. So today the myths have value, not only as entertainment, but as a help in understanding the cultural background of about 23,500 people who live among us in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Though we speak of "the Indian mind," we should remember that the natives of the Pacific Northwest spoke several languages and many dialects, and that there were differences in spiritual culture as well in material culture, especially between the Coast tribes on the one hand and the Plateau tribes between the Cascades and the Rockies on the other. But from a study of hundreds of the folk tales of many tribes of the Pacific Northwest, certain generalizations can be made. In almost every myth one of these concepts is evident: a belief in the spirits of nature, and a belief in the "animal people" of long ago or in other primal beings. Two additional ones are closely</page><page sequence="6">168 ELLA E. CLARK September linked with these: the concept of the Changer or Transformer and the concept of the guardian spirit. One major belief, animism, is immediately clear to anyone familiar with the mythology of the ancient Greek. "Every power of nature he presumes to be a spiritual being, imper sonating the sky as Zeus, the earth as Demeter, the sea as Poseidon," explained Dickinson, in his study of Greek religion. "Nature has become a company of spirits; every cave and fountain is haunted by a nymph; in the ocean dwells the Nereids, in the mountain the Oread, the Dryad in the wood, . . . so that everywhere man is confronted no longer with blind and unin telligible force, but with spiritual being moved by passions like himself."9 Only a little less anthropomorphic than the ancient Greek's was the Northwest Indian's concept of nature spirits. "To the Indian in his native state," said Martin Sampson of a Puget Sound tribe, "everything had life or spirit; the earth, rocks, trees, ferns, as well as birds and animals-even the hail which fell from the sky-had a spirit and a language and song of its own and might be an inspiration to a warrior."10 "They believed that everything had its own spirit-the wind, the water, the thunder, the lightning, the trees,-all, according to their notion, had a spirit that governed them, as the spirit which occupies a man's body controls his actions," wrote General James Strong, who knew Chinook and the Yakima Indians in the 1850s. "They could not understand how anything which has life or motion, as a tree that grows, water or wind that moves, or thunder that roars, can fail of having some inner life, or spirit, to cause the activities which they daily saw and heard. They also believed that great immovable objects, such as mountains, caves, etc., were possessed of a presiding genius."l General Strong described a wedding ceremony in which there were ritualistic chants to the Great Spirit, the Evil Spirit, the Spirit of the Woods (to furnish the couple with game), the Spirit of the Water (to 9.

Ed ward Goodbird, a Sioux, repeats a similar explanation from his father: "All things in this world have souls or spirits. The sky has a spirit; the clouds have spirits; the sun and moon have spirits; so have animals, trees, grass, water, stones, everything. These spirits are our gods; and we pray to them and give them offerings, that they may help us in our need." In Cry of the Thunderbird, Chas. Hamilton, ed.

The voice of the invisible spirit of the swamps and thickets sometimes caused people to become lost. Seatco, the demon of the dark forest, wandered forth at night to break canoes, rob traps, harm anyone traveling alone, and steal disobedient children.'3 "Al-la-lim-yah, the Mountain Spirit, or Spirit of the Wind," reported a missionary among the Nez Perces, "was in the form of a person, a tall, old man, taller than any tree, walking to and fro continually, never resting, never eating-wailing and weeping. Tears of blood were constantly dropping, not only from his eyes, but from the great staff which he carried in his hands. Many of the people a long time ago tried to touch his person, but found nothing in their hands but air."'14 The spirit of the storm, most of the Indians of the Pacific Northwest pictured as a huge and powerful bird. The flapping of his wings caused the thunder; the pieces of flint which he threw or the flash of his eyes was the lightning. He lived in a cloud above Mount Adams15 or other high mountain, or in a cave in the Olympic Mountains-a place always to be shunned. Indians near the coast believed that Thunderbird went to the Pacific Ocean for the whales which were his food, that rain clouds and thunder storms often followed him home. As is evident in several stories, the Indians feared Thunderbird and tried not to arouse his anger. Spirits lived in most of the lakes of the Pacific Northwest, and demons lurked in dark recesses along rivers. Crater Lake was formed as the result of a terrific battle between the Chief of the Below-World spirits standing on top of an ancient mountain and 12. Strong, op cit., 137. 13.

At the end of the struggle, in which all the spirits of earth and sky participated, the Chief of the Below-World spirits was driven back to his lodge in the middle of the moun tain-that-used-to-be, and the top of the mountain fell in upon him. After many years of torrential rains, a lake developed in the big hole left after the collapse of the ancient mountain top. The Klamath Indians always shunned the lake; to look upon it meant sorrow and death.16 Only the shamans, according to another legend, were permitted to see it; they climbed up to it from time to time to hold council with the Spirit Chief whose lodge was a small peak in the lake, a peak now called Wizard Island. Lost Lake, at the base of Mount Hood, was the dwelling place of the spirits of many animals that had been killed. Spirit Lake, at the base of Mount St. Helens, was inhabited by so many evil spirits that Paul Kane, an artist wandering in the region in 1847, could not hire any Indian to take him to it. Evil spirits in the rapids of the lower Columbia and among the rocks below them sometimes destroyed canoes and all the people in them, Indians warned the Reverend Samuel Parker and his companions in 1835.17 But spirits were not always malevolent. Spirits of the earth and rocks and trees assisted a brave young warrior in getting rid of an evil giant that once roamed and roared through the land, frightening the people. They lured the demon into a river, where the friendly spirits of the water helped the young man bind his arms and legs, and then carried the captive out into the sea. The demon still roars along the shore, but he has never 16. This legend was related in 1865 by a peace chief of the Klamath Indians, who was then past eighty years old. An unlucky accident prevented our knowing the lore of this venerable chief, whose memory went back to the eighteenth century. William Colvig, who spent almost all of his ninety years in southern Oregon, was a young soldier at Fort Klamath at the close of the Civil War. Having had Indians as his neighbors for eleven years, he made friends with Old Chief Lalek and from him learned much about Klamath lore and legends. Thinking that the material might be of value some day (an unusual realization for a nineteen-year-old) and having plenty of time, he wrote down what the old man told him. But before he reached home with his manuscript, a raft or scow on which he was crossing a river capsized and he lost all his possessions. Only the Crater Lake legend, which he later heard from several other Klamaths, and an Umpqua legend which his family knew well are among his papers. 17.

To propitiate them, the Chinook Indians gave them a simple offering at the beginning of the salmon season: the first salmon caught were placed in the river with their heads pointing upstream, and a certain kind of berry was placed in the mouth of each. Early traders, accordingly, gave the fruit its common name-salmon berry.19 Rituals of several Plateau tribes reveal that a good and powerful spirit was responsible for the crops of roots and berries. His name meant "the Great Mystery," "Great Chief Above," or "He who lives on high," and his abode was in the sky or in the highest mountain near the worshippers.20 Near the tops of some of the Cascade peaks lived powerful spirits that must not be angered, lest storms or avalanches be hurled upon the offending people. "There is a lake of fire on top of the mountain," warned Sluiskin, the guide of the two men who climbed Mount Rainier in 1870. The Indian took them only to the snow line and begged them to go no further. "In the lake lives a mighty demon. If you should reach the top, the demon will seize you and throw you into the fire." When he saw the climbers, Hazard Stevens and P. B. Van Trump, returning two days later, Sluiskin stared open-mouthed, sure that they were ghosts.21 The legendary miser who, long before, had climbed Mount Rainier in search of hiaqua (shell money) had a strange adven ture with thirteen otters in a lake at the top. Failing to leave a gift for the spirits, he made them angry and thus brought on a terrifying storm that did not abate until he had thrown away every string of hiaqua. The Spirit of Mount Hood and the Spirit of Mount St. Helens, according to a tradition heard a century ago, used to cross the Columbia River by a natural bridge, to visit each other; but one day the spirit of Mount St. Helens became very angry and shook 18.

Thus the Cascades of the Columbia originated. In another version of the legend, the "Great Spirit" made a bridge across the river as a symbol of peace, and later destroyed it because of the quarreling of the river spirits and the mountain spirits.22 In at least four of the myths explaining the origin of the Cascades of the Columbia, and in a few other stories recorded by pioneers or told by Indians today, the Great Spirit is an import ant personage. The question is often asked: Did the Indians, before the white man came, conceive of an all-powerful spirit, a supreme being, a "Great Spirit?" There is disagreement on the matter, both among the missionaries and teachers who knew and wrote about the Indians of the Pacific Northwest in early days, and also among anthropologists and mythologists who have studied Indian myths and rituals in more recent years. Indians who have made intelligent study of their own culture likewise have contradictory opinions. Obviously much depends upon the inquirer's concept of a Supreme Being.23 From two of the earliest students of the Indians of Washington we find conflicting statements on the subject. James Swan, teacher of the Makah in the northwest corner of the Olympic Peninsula, reported to the Smithsonian Institution in 1869: The Makah believe in a Supreme Being, who is termed by them Cha-batt-a Ha-tartstle, or Ha-tartstle Cha-batt-a, the Great Chief who resides above. The name of this Great Chief, or Divine Being, is never given, although they have a name; but they must not speak it to any except those who have been initiated into their secret rites and ceremonies. They have no outward forms of religion, but each one 22. For a summary of the many Bridge of the Gods legends, see the author's article in OHQ, LIII (September, 1952), 29-38. 23. Cf. a statement by Hartley Burr Alexander, one-time professor of philosophy at the University of Nebraska: "The only truth in the assertion that the Indian's idea of a Great Spirit is derived from white missionaries is that the Indian conception is less anthropomorphic than that commonly entertained by an unphilosophic white (though it is one that would have been readily comprehended by the Stoics of antiquity, and would not have seemed remote to the thought of Plato or Aristotle) .... No one can follow the detail of Indian ritual without being profoundly impressed by his intense reverence for the Master of Life and his firm conviction in his goodness." It is natural, Alexander continued, that the Indian often ad dresses his prayer or makes his offerings to "the intermediaries between him self and the ruler of the high heaven."

Intermediate spirits ... are supposed to guard the destinies of individuals, and to manifest themselves at certain times by visions, signs and dreams. They are called in the [Chinook] jargon Tamanawas . . . The Sun is the repre sentative of the Great Spirit. To him they make their secret prayer.24 Swan regretted that he could not persuade the Makah that their Great Chief was the same the Christian concept of God.25 The Reverend Myron Eells, in his Ten Years of Missionary Work among the Indians of Skokomish, Washington Territory, 1874-1884, wrote: They believe in the existence of a Supreme Being, though very different from that of the whites . . .; in a Deity called Dokibatl by the Twanas [Skokomish] and Nukimatl by the Clallams, who became incarnate and did many wonderful things. . . . The Clallams believed that the Sun was the Supreme Being, or that he resided in the sun.26 But in this report Eells seems to have contradicted his earlier statement about a Supreme Being: I do not believe that these Indians ever had any idea of the Great Spirit before the coming of the whites. They have, however, a plain idea of a great being, perhaps mythological, who had much to do with the world as it is now, and who is called in Twana and Nisqually Dokibatt and in Klallam Mikimatt.

"The Indian Sunday is not one day, like your Sunday," a Makah chief explained to Swan, "but it is many days. When we want to talk with the Great Chief, we wait till the moon is full, and then go into the mountains, and rub our bodies with cedar twigs, after having first washed them clean. The cedar makes us smell sweet, and that the Great Chief likes. We watch for the sun, and when he first makes his appearance, we ask him to let us live long, to be strong to defend ourselves or attack our enemies, to be suc cessful in our fisheries, or in the pursuit of game; and to give us everything we want. Every night we wash and rub ourselves with cedar, and every morning talk to the Great Chief, or his representative, the sun. . . .

When he was here, he was supreme, and they think he may have a second coming at any time.27 In some myths recorded before specialists were in the field, the term "Great Spirit" (or Sahale Tyee, "the Above Chief" in the Chi nook jargon) obviously refers to this "great being," told about by many tribes, whose name means "the Changer;" Doquebuth, Dohkwibuhch, Xelas, Kwatee, Dababethw are some of the simp lest variants among the Puget Sound and Pacific Coast tribes. "Great Spirit" may have been used because the names of the Changer are difficult for non-Indians to pronounce and hence to represent with our alphabet. This great being changed the world of the ancients into the world of the Indian; he was Creator or Transformer, but apparently he was not worshipped. In other stories, it is not clear whether the Great Spirit was the chief of the sky spirits, some other powerful spirit, or some aboriginal concept of a Supreme Being. An eighty-year-old Chehalis Indian, Silas Heck, who is well acquainted with the lore of his people, is firmly convinced that the Changer and the Supreme Being were not the same: the Changer, Nookoomis, was a man; "the Highest High and the Greatest Great" was a spirit (I could not pronounce his gutterals and hence could not transliterate the Chehalis name for the Supreme Being.) Mr. Heck thinks that the ritualistic prayer of thanksgiving for the first roots and first berries was addressed to this spirit long before white people came to the country. The concept of a Supreme Being probably belongs to religion rather than to mythology, in almost any culture; some peoples have the feeling that to talk about Him is to profane Him. The powerful spirit Amotken, to whom several Plateau tribes once gave reverence, does not appear in anthropologists' collections of tales from those tribes. But according to the ethnographer James Teit, the Indians thanked Him in prayer, singing, and ceremonial dancing; the first fruits dug and the first berries picked were offered to Him in a bowl held up toward His dwelling place.28 27.

In the summer of 1952, Jobe Charley, a Wasco about eighty-six years of age, related a Yakima tradition which he had first heard in childhood, a story about Mount Adams, one of the five wives of the Sun. Near the end of the myth, the mountain learned that she was the daughter of the Great Spirit; and the story closed with these rhythmic words of the interpreter, approved by the nodding head of the narrator: "From that time on to this day, it is really true, in your belief, in my belief, that the Great Spirit is the Father." III This belief in spirits in all aspects of nature appears in many traditions, not only in myths and in the first-fruits ceremonies, but also in the Chinook wind dance (when snow lingered long) and in the guardian spirit concept, to be discussed later. In the tales recorded in recent years and related today, however, animism is less evident than a belief in the "animal people," who lived on the earth "long ago when the world was very young." Peter Noyes, a Colville in northeastern Washington, stated this belief as he began to tell some tales known since childhood. "Long, long ago, I don't know how long, the animals were the people of this country. They talked to one another the same as we do, and they married too. This went on for years and years; and then the world changed." A Stillaguamish Indian, west of the Cascades, expressed the same concept: "This time, long time ago, animal just like man. He talk, everybody understand. Fur and skin he put on and take off just like coat. Same way everybody-animals, birds, fish."29 This tradition-that before the Indians were created, their world was inhabited by a race of giant First People, who were reasoning creatures with the names of animals-is wide-spread among the natives of the North American continent. G. B. Kuykendall, government physician on the Yakima Reservation in the 1870s, able to converse in the Chinook jargon and in most of the dialects of the fourteen tribes on the reservation at that time, wrote that the words for these giant creatures meant "the 29.

CLARK September ancients" or "the ones that came before."30 Today's storytellers refer to them simply as "the People." Apparently these ancient "People" fished, hunted, gathered berries and roots, held councils and feasts and dances, and in other ways lived as did the Indians who later created the tales about them. According to a Quileute myth, for example, the potlatch (gift-giving ceremony) origi nated in the home of Golden Eagle, who had a slave named Bluejay. In a Puget Sound myth related to Arthur Ballard of Auburn, Washington, Raven was the slave of North Wind. According to several myths of interior tribes, Coyote, Raccoon, Eagle, and other "animal people" followed some of the marriage customs and the mourning customs of the Plateau Indians. The giant beings among these ancients were sometimes animals in form, sometimes human, even in the same story. Moreover, they were frequently super-animal and super-human. They had many supernatural powers, including the ability to transform themselves into anything they chose. The ability of some of them to shoot an arrow to the sky and to join to it a ladder or rope of arrows has been mentioned in connection with the fire myths. The first arrows were usually shot by some little fellow-Snail or Chickadee or Boy Sapsucker. By means of the arrow ladder, some of the animal beings visited the Sky People; a few of them stayed up there in the Sky World and became the stars. At various times Coyote transformed himself into a pine needle, an alder branch, a wooden bowl, a handsome young man, a baby on a cradle board floating down the Columbia River and crying pitifully. When he died, as he did again and again, he was brought back to life by Fox's stepping over him three times. In several variants, Beaver was trapped and partly skinned when he went up to the sky to steal the first fire; but because his hide was not pulled away from his mouth, he still lived and was able to put it back on "as smooth as ever." In a Wasco myth similar to the familiar Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, Coyote and Eagle went to the Land of the Spirits and tried to bring the dead back with them. Among the tribes of the interior of Washington and Oregon, -and among other Plateau Indians, Coyote, Eagle and Beaver figure most prominently in the mythology. Greatest of them all 30.

In a myth of the Okanogan people of what is now north central Washington and adjacent British Columbia, the ancients were so selfish, ignorant, and troublesome that Old-One sent Coyote to kill all the evil beings and to teach the others the best ways to do things. In some stories of the interior tribes Coyote is clearly an animal, for his tail or his snout is mentioned. In others, he is a man-sometimes old and ugly, sometimes young and handsome. In a Sanpoil tale, he is described as being tall and strong, perhaps "a chief of some kind." He wore his hair in long braids; "his forelocks were care fully combed back and . . . the few strands of hair in front of his ears were covered with beads."31 According to the stories of several tribes, Coyote arranged the seasons, conquered Ice and Blizzard, brought the first fire to the People, introduced salmon to those living along the upper Columbia and its tributaries, taught the People how to make fishing equipment and bows and arrows, how to catch and cook salmon, how to cure meat and to dress skins. He laid down laws for celebrating the coming of the first salmon each year and established taboos concerning its preparation and use. Again and again he said that he was getting the world ready for "the new people" who were to come. The Shoshoni, according to their myths, were descended from Coyote. Many of the Columbia River tribes and their neighbors, from the Chinooks near the mouth of the Columbia to the Flatheads and Blackfeet beyond the Rockies, were said to have been created by Coyote from the bodies of troublesome monsters he had slain. Hundreds of stories center around Coyote, and nothing was beyond his powers. He dug a tunnel through the Cascade Mountains so that the salmon could come up from the ocean; the big lake east of the mountains drained through it and thus the Columbia River was formed. He changed three young warriors into Mount Chopaka and two other peaks in the Okanogan Highlands; and the Kalispel maiden they fought over, he turned into the Wishing Stone or "Hee-Hee Stone" near the Canadian border. Beacon Rock, Rooster Rock, Horsetail Falls, Mist Falls, and Latourell Falls along the lower Columbia are all the work of Coyote, transformed by him from animal beings. 31. Verne F. Ray, The Sanpoil and Nespelem, University of Washington Publications in Anthropology (1932), V. p. 72.</page><page sequence="16">178 ELLA E. CLARK September Seven child-eating giants he changed into the Seven Devils Mountains, and below them, as a second protection for his people, he gouged out Hells Canyon of the Snake River. Because of his disappointments in love, he turned trees into rocks in what is now known as the Ginkgo Petrified Forest of central Washington, and built waterfalls in several rivers, so that salmon could not reach the people (sometimes the ancients, sometimes Indians) that refused him the beautiful girls he desired. Rejected by the Otter girls along the middle Columbia, he altered the course of the river, leaving behind Dry Falls and the Grand Coulee of the old river. He even predicted, "Some day there will be a smart man who will run the river through here again. Years from now, there will be one man who will make the water run this way again." The narrator of this tale, a seventy year-old Sanpoil, who learned it from her great-uncle, thinks that the prediction is not a recent insertion; she interprets the "smart man" to be Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the irrigation project to be the fulfillment of Coyote's prophecy. But Coyote is not always the mighty magician, the beneficent "culture hero," Creator and Transformer. In some stories he is a trickster and a shrewd deceiver; in others, he is a numbskull who does stupid things for the amusement of young and old listeners. In a large number of tales collected and published for anthropological purposes, he is ready, deceitful, cruel, erotic, often guilty of incest.32 It is difficult to give, or to obtain, a clear conception of Coyote, for he is one of the most contradictory and inconsistent of folklore characters. At the end of the mythical period of the ancient beings, "the world changed," "the world turned over," "the world turned inside out." According to an unpublished story of the Colville Indians, the change came very suddenly. The animal beings from the Big Bend country traveled up north to make war on the creatures around Kettle Falls, in the upper Columbia. During the night the world changed, and the warring people were transformed to greasewood, the only greasewood in that part of the country. Another unique account of the change from the mythical age I heard from a woman whose Colville grandmother was eager 32.

Several of her stories were about the Great White Spirit, who had fair skin and blue eyes. (These descriptive details, of course, may be a recent insertion.) When he came, he had a following of the animal people, and Coyote's jealousy was aroused. Coyote objected to the fact that the followers of the Great White Spirit were walking on two legs. The two powerful beings soon had a power contest at the mouth of Nespelem Creek, near a small island in the Columbia River. Coyote commanded the island to move; the Great White Spirit commanded it to stay. It stayed. Because Coyote was defeated in the contest, his followers remained animal beings and became the ancestors of the present animals. The Great White Spirit transformed his own followers into people; their guardian spirits he said, would be in the form of animals, and after the death of a person, his individual guardian spirit would live to guide and protect some other person. A curious mingling of the grotesque and the spiri'tual appears in a story the Lake Indians of northeastern Washington tell about a power contest between Coyote and "God," at the end of which Coyote was banished to an island in the Pacific; there he can still be seen, but no one can get to him. He will come back, perhaps when the world changes again in the year 2000. Seventy-eight-year-old Eneas, who told me the myth, apparently believes it, but to most Indians today the Coyote stories are "just fairy tales told to children" or stories to provoke laughs. Coyote was the chief figure in the tales of most of the Indians of the western half of North America; but in the tribal myths of the Indians west of the Cascade Range, Raven, Mink, Bluejay, Fox, and Eagle were more important than Coyote. Raven was the culture hero, the Creator and Transformer, in many of the myths of the peoples along the shores of northern Puget Sound and adjacent waters; a little farther south Raven was the helper of the Man-Who-Changed-Things. Among some of the Puget Sound tribes, Fox furnished the comedy provided by Coyote in the tales of the Plateau Indians. Bluejay was the chief character of many myths of the Chehalis and Chinook tribes. All these Puget Sound and Coast tribes handed down stories about the Changer who transformed the ancient world and its creatures into the world of the Indians.</page><page sequence="18">180 ELLA E. CLARK September IV Coyote was the benefactor of mankind and the transformer, as well as trickster, in the tribal myths of the Plateau Indians. Raven had similar roles in myths of Northwest Coast tribes. But most of the peoples on the Olympic Peninsula and along Puget Sound held a different concept of the Changer or Transformer, who remains a vague and confusing figure, both in spite of and because of the many stories about him. Some people conceived of him as an invisible being, according to Jerry Meeker, an intelligent Puyallup ninety years old in 1952. But most tribes evidently thought of him as a man-like being with whom the first people talked; "his foot prints can still be seen" along Hood Canal and along Chuckanut Bay near Bellingham. Some Puget Sound Indians, however, referred to the avalanche lily (Ery thronium) as the eye of Dokwibalth, says Arthur Ballard; and the Skagits cautioned their children, "Dokwibalth always sees you." The origin of the Changer is uncertain in the traditions of some tribes. In a myth handed down by several others, he was the son of an earth maiden and a star; stolen in infancy from his grandmother, Blind Toad, he was rescued in manhood by Blue Jay; then he brought with him from the Sky World all the arts and crafts of the Indians. In a Skagit myth of creation, there were two Changers: Old Creator, before the flood, and Dokwi balth, the Young Changer and Creator, the son of one of the five survivors of the flood; Dokwibalth received his spirit power from Old Creator. In the traditions of the Skokomish along Hood Canal, the Changer "came once to create, a second time to change, and will come again to make the world over when it becomes old."33 When the Skokomish and other Indians of the area first heard of Christ, the Reverend Myron Eells reported in 1887, "they associated him at once with the changer, whom they said they believed to be the great Creator. When I have been teaching them about the coming of the Savior," he wrote, "they have said they always knew of this, and have repeated some of their legends about the Changer." In the Chinook jargon, Eells continued, the name of the Changer and the name for God are the same: Saghalie Tyhee, meaning the "Above Chief."34 33. Eells, "The Twana, Chemakum, and Klallam," 681. 34. Ibid., 679.</page><page sequence="19">1953 MYTHOLOGY OF THE INDIANS 181 In the summer of 1950, two Quinault Indians of the Washington coast, thinking that they should explain to me the nature of the Changer, Kwatee, the hero of the stories they were going to relate, said very simply and sincerely, "Well, Kwatee was just like Jesus. He went about doing good." But in stories told in the same area, not all the deeds of the Changer were Christ like; even while creating and transforming, he was sometimes, from our point of view, deceitful and brutal. Judged by the standards of a scientific age, the folktales of any people reveal inconsistencies and incongruities. Certain myths of the Makah near Neah Bay, of the Quinault, the Quileute, and the Skokomish clearly indicate a belief in primeval beings who were human. In traditions of the Makah recorded by James Swan, two Changers worked together. The two-men-who-changed-things (Hohoeapbess, the brothers of the sun and the moon) transformed some of these primeval human beings into animals as punishment for their misconduct (a thieving fisherman, for instance, was changed into a kingfisher); they transformed others into trees, shrubs, and herbs for the use of the Indians to be created.35 Kwatee, said my Quinault informants, changed one of these first people (who was sharpen ing a knife with which to kill the Transformer) into a deer, another into a beaver, others into Indians. The Quileute, north of the Quinault, and the Chehalis, south of them, tell essentially the same story. In a similar tale which Myron Eells reported from the Skokomish along Hood Canal, the Changer (Dokibatt) made rocks, deer, beaver, and several different birds from the first people. These transformations came about when the Changer was in the world the second time.36 In the Puyallup myth, the Changer brought roots and berries of many kinds from the land beyond the edge of the world "the world" always being the area of the tribe telling the story. Up to the time of his coming, stones had life; bees, flies, mosquitoes, and other insects had been giants. The Changer removed life from stones and made the insects small and less harmful. To some tribes he brought the sun, moon, stars, and daylight. On both sides of Puget Sound he taught the new people how to make fire; how to make and use the bow and arrow, the canoe and fish-traps; how to make baskets and 35. Swan, op. cit., 64-65. 36. Eells, "The Twana, Chemakum, and Klallam," 680-681.</page><page sequence="20">182 ELLA E. CLARK September moccasins; how to prepare and use certain herbs for medicine. It was he who gave the tribes their languages. On his travels, one Changer (Kwatee) formed the Coast rivers and rocks from Neah Bay south to the Columbia. Doquebuth, the Changer of the Puyallup, transformed five sisters into the five major Cascade peaks; Takkobad (Mount Rainier) was one of them. Three sisters farther north were changed, after the flood, into Sisters Peak, near Mount Baker. Mount Rainier, according to myths told by the Duwamish, Skokomish, Puyallup, and Nisqually peoples, was once the wife of a warrior among the Hohadhun, now the Olympic Mountains. She became so big and so crowded on the peninsula, or was so annoyed by the jealousy of another wife, that she moved across Puget Sound. When the Changer came through the world to make everything different, he turned all the characters in the story into mountains. In a Skagit myth, Thunder and Rain were man and wife; Lightning and Hail were their children. Old Creator put Thunder up high to control the weather and made lightning his spirit power. But in most of the folktales collected from the Indians west of the Cascades, the primeval beings are "animal people." In a sacred myth of the Skagit Indians, Raven, Mink, and Coyote "planned everything with the Transformer, were in on all the arguments:" they decided that there should be male and female in everything on the earth, that people should not live forever, that at death the body should go to the earth and the spirit to the spirit world. According to traditions of both the Quinault on the seacoast and the Snohomish on the eastern shore of Puget Sound, Raven won in an argument with Eagle, to decide that rivers should flow but one way and that people who died should never come to life again. In hundreds of stories, somewhat humanized animals and birds reason and talk and originate the customs of the later Indians. These two concepts of "First People," appearing side by side occasionally in the myths of a single tribe, are probably due to a fusion of the mythology of tribes who were isolated in pre historic times but who had intermingled and intermarried for decades before collectors came among them. Or it may be that the two concepts and the stories originated in different stages of mythological thought. In the mythological age, according to tribal tales of both the Coast and the Plateau Indians, even insentient and inanimate</page><page sequence="21">1953 MYTHOLOGY OF THE INDIANS 183 objects had human abilities to move, to talk, to reason, to beget children. In a Nez Perce fire myth, Pines held a council and later, with Cedar, ran in pursuit of Beaver, who had reasoned out how to steal the fire. In a Sanpoil fire myth, Flint Rock and Hard Rock understood what Woodpecker said to them and so fought each other-the result Woodpecker wanted, for he needed arrow heads.37 In a Quinault myth, Clouds and Rain were the sons and daughters of Ocean because they were mistreated in the dry country, Ocean made the Cascade Mountains. In a Makah myth, Destruction Island and Tatoosh Island were a quarreling man and wife; their children were the rocks now at the Point of Arches. In some myths, either the mountains or the mountain spirits were humanized, particularly the peaks of the Cascade Range. Mount Baker and Mount Rainier were man and wife, in a myth of the Lummi Indians; when Rainier (Duh-hwahk) packed her seeds and roots and moved south, she left behind not only her husband (Komo Kulshan) but also their three children, three lesser peaks near Mount Baker. "Mount Rainier (Tacobud) and Mount St. Helens were female mountains," Silas Heck told me. "Mount Adams was a male mountain. Rainier and St. Helens were jealous and used to throw fire at each other." "Long ago, Mount Hood and Mount Adams were alive and moved about at will," Indians explained to Elizabeth Lord's father when relating a Bridge of the Gods legend.38 Mount Hood and Mount St. Helens were man and wife, Indians informed George Gibbs in 1854; Mount Hood was afraid, for St. Helens had won in a quarrel and was still smoking.39 But in the very same year, 1854, an old Yakima told James Strong that the spirits of Mount Hood and of Mount St. Helens used to cross the river to visit each other.40 V The guardian spirit concept, the most important aspect of native Indian religion, is revealed somewhat in the myths. Obviously a part of the belief in a spiritual counterpart of every phenomenon of nature, it seems also, at least among the Plateau tribes, to be interwoven with the belief in the wonderful animal 37.

For an individual's guardian spirit, his guide and protector through life, was usually, though not always, the spirit of an animal or a bird. A creation myth of the Sanpoil Indians of the middle Columbia indicates the close relationship between the spirits and the animal people in this concept-a relationship apparent even if not expressed directly in the myth ology of many tribes. After Chief had created and had named all the animals and all the birds, said the Sanpoil, he gave this instruction to each of them: "In times to come, when people have been created, they will send their children out, during the day or during the night, and you will talk to them and will tell them what they will be able to do when they grow up .. ."41 A creation myth of the Modoc suggests the training of the shamans. After Kumush, Old Man of the Ancients, had created the tribes from the bones of the spirits, he said to them, "You must send certain men to the mountains. There they must ask to be made brave or to be made wise. There, if they ask for it, they will be given the power to help themselves and to help you." Kuykendall, although he did not discuss animism or the guardian spirit concept, did indicate a close connection between spirits and the giant animal beings. Writing about the end of the period of the ancient animal people, whom he sometimes refers to as gods, Kuykendall stated: "There seems to be an idea that though these gods still live in the form of the present race of animals, the god-like part, the magic power, the great intelli gence, exists somewhere else as a spirit; and this spirit is reverenced as a god and is appealed to for help."42 Most Indians on the North American continent, probably all of them, believed that the world is permeated with a strange, mystical force and that through fasting and solitary vigil a person might attain some of this spiritual power.43 It was usually attained before puberty, but sometimes in adulthood. Almost every Indian child, in days gone by, spent nights alone, in search of his guardian spirit. Details differed from tribe to tribe, but in 41. Ray, op. cit., 176. 42. Kuykendall, 64. 43. Detailed studies of the guardian spirit concept and related religious ideas of the Indians of the region are found in Spier, op. cit., 133-176; Ray, op. cit., 182-211; Marian Smith, op. cit., 56-137; Hermann Haeberlin and Erna G?nther, The Indians of Puget Sound, University of Washington Pub lications in Anthropology (1930), IV, 67-81. Only facts connected with the myths or obtained first-hand by the present author will be presented here.</page><page sequence="23">1953 MYTHOLOGY OF THE INDIANS 185 general if a child followed the directions of his elders, if he fasted and was in the proper frame of mind, he might have a dream or a vision. In the vision the child would see a spirit, usually in the form of a human being, and would hear a voice telling him what special power he would have in manhood-for example, power in hunting or fishing or gambling or rain making, immunity to certain dangers, ability to cure illness. Before leaving him, the spirit would give the child a special song, his "power song," to be used later in the winter ceremonial dances and in times of individual crises. Departing, the spirit changed to his true form, and the child awoke with his "power song" in his mind. Among the Nez Perces, "a feather of the species of bird or a tail of the kind of animal that talked to him [the child] was to be kept and worn throughout life as a symbol of his attending spirit. He was invulnerable while he kept it and trusted it."144 Besides giving a person his individual power and his special song, the guardian spirit would promise to guide him through life and to come to his protection in times of trouble-if he would think about his spirit when he was in need. In the tales, a character is said to "make his powers" or to "sing his power song." Usually a boy or girl had to go on the power quest several times before he was successful. Even after one successful experience, he might continue the quest, for the more guardian spirits a man had, the more powers he possessed and the higher his place in the tribe. As might be expected, shamans, popularly called "medicine men," had more guardian spirits than the average man or woman. If a person failed to obey the instructions of his guardian spirit, sickness would result. In a legend of the Hood River area and of Lost Lake, a young man disobeyed his guardian spirit, an elk, who had commanded him never to kill more game than he needed for food. The elk cast him out from his protection, and the young man soon died. Though a guardian spirit might come to a person anywhere, many tribes considered certain places more propitious than others for the power quest. Spirit Mountain, southwest of Portland, was a favored spot for the vigil of Santiam youth; and vigil on Mount Jefferson, said John Hudson of Grand Ronde, brought guardian spirits with very strong powers. On White 44. McBeth, op. cit., 260.</page><page sequence="24">186 ELLA E. CLARK September Mountain in northeastern Washington, numerous piles of stones are reminders of many power quests in days gone by. Boys between the ages of five and twelve, says Peter Noyes, a Colville, stayed on the mountain alone for five or six days, without food, waiting for the voice of some spirit; each boy made a pile of stones as proof that he had remained where his father or his uncle had left him. When one thinks of the myths about the powerful spirits that lived in the mountains, it is not surprising that the high places were highly regarded for the power quest. But in some areas children dived or swam when seeking their guardian spirits. Rose Purdy, who spent her childhood along Hood Canal, told about a boy of her tribe who was directed to dive for his power. He bathed until he thought he was clean-cleanliness was an important part of the quest in all tribes-but when he dived, the stone he was grasping in his fist would not let him go down. Thinking he was not clean, he bathed again, scrubbing himself with a brush of leaves. Four times he came up from the water to bathe again, almost rubbing his nails away with pebbles, in his effort to get them scrupulously clean. When he dived the fifth time, the stone in his hand allowed him to go down. "No spirit would come to you unless you were clean," added Mrs. Purdy. "What ever you would hear and see when you were so clean would be your Tahmahnawis [spirit]. You would hear its song; you would wake up and see it. Whenever you were in danger later, you would sing your Tahmahnawis song, and it would come and help you." Her Tahmahnawis once kept her from being struck by an automobile; it comforts her-"lifts her up," she says-when she is worried about her children. In northeastern Washington, a boy was directed to dive into Twin Lake for his guiding spirit, recalled Eneas Seymore. Twice the boy tried to dive, but instead he came back to a rock over hanging the water. Directed to dive a third time, he went to the bottom of the lake, where he saw a tepee with many people in it. The head man said to the boy, "You will have power to catch fish in a trap. These people you see are fish. I give you power to catch fish." Several "animal people" who are important characters in the tales were thought, by certain tribes, to give especially strong power and hence were very desirable as guardian spirits; among them were Eagle, Raven, Blue Jay, Owl, Grizzly Bear. In some</page><page sequence="25">1953 MYTHOLOGY OF THE INDIANS 187 groups Coyote was not wanted as an attending spirit, but among the Okanogan he was wanted because he gave power for killing deer and for gambling. Both skills were admired in Indian cul ture, and in the folk tales Coyote was a shrewd gambler. Not all guardian spirits were the spirits of animals or birds. Thunder and Lightning were two of the strongest powers; in fact, according to a Nisqually myth, the Changer transformed two brothers into Thunder and Lightning because they had obtained dangerously strong spirit power. Thunder spirit gave power for fighting (Okanogan); the person possessing this spirit could make it thunder at any time he wished (Snohomish). The spirit of a hazelnut, in a Yakima legend, was responsible for the prowess of a certain warrior. Rocks, wind, fog, rain, the rainbow, sticks, and tools have been named as powers; that is, each "had a spirit and a language and song of its own" and has given spirit power to someone. Many guardian spirits of the Snohomish and the Snoqualmie were formless or abstract beings, most of whom traveled "around the earth in an anticlockwise direction, com pleting the circuit once each year." They came back in time for the spirit dances, elaborate ceremonials of the winter months.45 Sometimes dozens of power quests were made before a guar dian was obtained, and an occasional child was never successful. "My uncle sent me out hundreds of times when I was between eight and fifteen," a Sanpoil great-grandmother informed me. "But I never heard the song of any bird or animal or ground hog. I wasn't lucky enough to hear a song from anyone." If a woman had acquired a guardian spirit, she was accepted on a par with men in some tribes; if she had not, she could live a satisfactory life. But a boy could expect very little from life if he became a man without having been successful on a power quest.46 The guardian spirit concept was a sacred one; in the words of Martin Sampson, "It was believed that when a man told what his guiding spirit was, whether it was a bear, a fish, a tree, or a bird, as soon as it was told his power was weakened."47 Because of this and similar beliefs, the concept is less important in the mythology of the Pacific Northwest Indians than in their re ligion. 45.

CLARK September The ritual of seeking a guardian spirit and the custom of re lating the tribal tales to the family group round the lodge fires seem to have died out in the childhood or early adolescence of Indians now in their seventies. Kate McBeth, who came as a mis sionary among the Nez Perces in 1879, mentions several times in her book the difficulty of persuading the converts to throw away "that feather or tail," symbols of the attending spirit. A Klallam grandfather, among others, told me that when he started to school he was advised to forget such nonsense as the tribal traditions he had heard round the family fireside; he could recall only the Klallam story of the Deluge, and pointed to the peak in the Olympics to which the canoes filled with people were tied during the great flood. Undoubtedly many traditions and tales had been forgotten before ethnographers began their studies. Almost the only stories that can be recalled now are those which once amused young children and the "pool-hall type of story" which men amuse each other with in the longhouse. Ex cept for a few tales beginning "Long ago when the mountains were people"-related to me by Puyallup, Chehalis, Yakima, and Warm Springs Indians-stories about the humanized animals seem to be the only ones that Indians today know. Although I specifically asked on both sides of the Cascade Range, I could locate none of the picturesque old stories about the activities of the mountain and water spirits. An old Colville Indian and a Warm Springs couple mentioned the legendary Bridge of the Gods in myths they related to me, but they seemed not to know about the angry mountain spirits that once were thought to have caused the destruction of that bridge. The Colville said an earthquake caused it to fall; the others, that Coyote wished it to fall, and it fell. It is of course very possible that an occasional elderly Indian still treasures some old traditions and has had his lips sealed by the ridicule of white people in the past. "These things, the very deep," says the present friend of an aged re ligious man of the Wanapam, "are not treated lightly by the Indian." A white woman who has lived on the Colville Reservation for twenty-five years, on friendly terms with Indian neighbors, had never heard of the native belief in nature spirits except in con nection with the guardian spirit quest. And Verne F. Ray, in his monograph on the Sanpoil and Nespelem based on studies in 1928-1930, makes this statement: "It should be said in this con</page><page sequence="27">1953 MYTHOLOGY OF THE INDIANS 189 nection that spirits were only considered by the native in their function as guardians. It was granted that every animal and thing potentially possessed a spirit. But of those spirits that never be came patrons of human beings, nothing was known, nothing was said. They were never seen and never caused any of the happen ings in the universe."48 Like the second-generation immigrant in the United States, the American Indian became scornful of his cultural back ground; and white man's interest was aroused so late that much of the oral literature has been lost. But from the tales that have been preserved, whether they originated in the region or in some other area from which the ancestors of the Pacific Northwest In dians may have come, we can reconstruct much of the life and thought of the natives of the three states. Their principal foods, their methods of gathering and preparing them, their tools and weapons and household equipment, their moving to different places for the foods of the season, their social customs-polyandry, mating, mourning, dancing and singing and feasting, gift-giving, slavery (in some tribes) -, the qualities of character the Indians admired, the sweat lodge and its uses, the religious concepts and ceremonies already mentioned-all these and others are reflected in the myths and legends of the region. Myths are primarily literature; the word itself means "stories" or "fables." And yet mythology is a part of ancient history and of anthropology, of philosophy and of religion. Some myths are science in an embryonic stage. As we may study the Iliad and the Odyssey, the Beowulf and the Norse Eddas in order to know the background of our European culture, so we may study the myths of the Indians of the Pacific Northwest in order to know the culture of the early Americans, so close to us in time and in area. Or we may read all folk literature for entertainment, as aesthetic creations of the imagination. 48. Ray, op. cit., 173.</page></plain_text>
