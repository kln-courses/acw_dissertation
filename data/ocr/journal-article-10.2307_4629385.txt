<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAURYA FIGURAL SCULPTURE RECONSIDERED BY FREDERICK ASHER AND WALTER SPINK THE DIDARGANJ CHOWRIE-BEARER IS PERHAPS THE MOST controversial of all Indian sculptures, with solidly respectable scholars disputing its date by as much as a half millennium.' A number of recent impor- tant studies have reaffirmed its traditional Mau- rya date;2 others have dated it as much as four hundred years later.3 If it is removed from the Maurya period, and if with it go the two Patna male chowrie-bearers now in the Indian Museum,4 the Lohanipur torso now in the Patna Museum, and the few other works carved from polished buff-colored sandstone that generally are seen as contemporary, then this critically important early period is left with no monumental stone images whatsoever, other than the "Asokan" pillars. What brings the Didarganj figure under scrutiny once more is the discovery of a double-sided vrkshadevata of polished buff-colored sandstone (Figs. 1-3) that bears clear similarity to the well- known chowrie-bearer. The impressive piece, measuring 1.16 by .38 meters, was discovered at Rajendranagar, a site adjacent to Lohanipur, within the metropolitan area of Patna. The fig- ure on one side of the relief (Fig. 1) leans to her right against a tree that twines upward over the right thigh and around the lowered right arm; the figure's raised left hand grasps the tree, which branches out and blossoms above her head. The figure on the other side (Fig. 2), in which the dis- position of the limbs is reversed, mirrors the same pose with an unexpected but surely intentional ac- curacy. The figure on each side is shown as if nude but for a long scarf that runs across the shoulders, down along the side of the body, and across the hips. The jewelry of each figure is nearly iden- tical: an untypically plain girdle (mekhald) lacking any definition of the expected beads; a simple two- strand necklace, again with no defined beads; a bracelet at the wrist; and an equally plain circlet just below the elbow on each arm. Quite possibly these two armlets should be read as the thicker outer borders of a continuous, and conventional, series of close-set bangles (see Fig. 3), which, like the surprisingly simplified girdle and necklace, are left undefined in order to make polishing the areas easier. Only the massive earrings of each figure are different, though both they and the distinctive circular hair-buns just above the forehead have striking counterparts in numerous Kushana sculp- tures, just as they do in the Didarganj chowrie- bearer. This Rajendranagar sculpture is not the only such double-sided vrkshadevata from Patna. An- other (Figs. 4-5) remains near the find-spot of that piece, at Nayatola village, which is adjacent to the excavated site of Kumrahar.5 Although the Naya- tola piece is remarkably similar to the Rajendrana- gar image-the form of the face, the stance, and the way in which the tree trunk crosses the body, for example, are much the same, and both are made of a buff sandstone rather than the mottled red Sikri stone of Mathura-this sculpture shows much greater detail throughout and has no trace of polish. Because of the greater detailing, the jewelry of the Nayatola figures appears considerably more opulent than that of the Rajendranagar figures. We might at least suggest, however, that such details as the "missing" beads and bangles on the Rajendranagar images were originally defined with the brush rather than the chisel, for it is reasonable to assume that the sculpture was painted. How else does one explain the unwonted simplicity of these standard costume elements or of the more unusual plain (non-pleated) areas on the scarves of the Rajendranagar figures, which are best understood as still-undecorated counterparts of the apparently related but fully decorated motif that appears just beyond the proper right cheek of the Nayatola figure (Fig. 4)? Even the broadly defined series of small spher- ical forms adjacent to the broken hair-bun of the more damaged Rajendranagar figure (Fig. 2) seems to reflect the head ornament of the Naya- tola figure and of a number of others dating to the Kushana period,6 and it is worth noting that the Didarganj figure has a head ornament that is at least somewhat related to this type, too. Despite the fact that the Nayatola sculpture (like the Rajendranagar one) is carved from buff sand- stone rather than the mottled red "Sikri" sand- stone that is more commonly used for Kushana sculptures, the dating to the Kushapa period need not be questioned either on the basis of style or that of function, for it resembles many of the double-sided images from Mathura that likely served as brackets for a torana. The critical ques- tion, then, must be: Are the similarities between</page><page sequence="2">2 FREDERICK ASHER AND WALTER SPINK this sculpture and the newly found one from Ra- jendranagar sufficient to allow us to assign the lat- ter, too, to the Kushana period? If that is the case, as seems apparent, then there are clear implica- tions for the date of the Didarganj figure, which is remarkably similar to it in many ways, and for the use of polished buff-colored sandstone well be- yond the Maurya period. The chowrie-bearer (Figs. 6-9) found at Didar- ganj, on the eastern outskirts of Patna, is carved fully in the round. Though not a relief like the Rajendranagar sculpture, it, too, is fashioned from brilliantly polished buff-colored sandstone and shares with the Rajendranagar figure similar exaggerated proportions. Even such details as the tubular earrings worn by the female on one side of the Rajendranagar relief (Fig. 3) also adorn the Didarjanj figure, and the curious coiffure (with a bun just above the forehead) common to so many well-known Kushana examples is found on both. There are, however, differences between them as well-most notably the heavy clothing covering the lower portion of the Didarganj image in con- trast to the apparent (though certainly not actual) nudity of the females on the Rajendranagar re- lief, the treatment of the latter being rather like that of the bracket female on the east gateway of Sanchi's Great Stuipa or of later figures, such as the Bhutesar pillar figures of Kushana times.7 Furthermore, on the Didarganj image, as on the females of the double-sided relief from Nayatola, far greater attention has been paid to detail: the beads on the necklace, the many bangles on the arm, the strands of hair on the chowrie, the folds on the cloth of the shawl, and the billowing cloth suspended from the beaded girdle are well de- fined. Lastly, the treatment of the faces is dif- ferent, that of the Didarganj figure being longer and somewhat heavier in appearance than that of the Rajendranagar figure, which is more rounded and almost smiling in expression. Despite differences among the three sculptures, we see overriding similarities. That is, we have suggested that the Rajendranagar relief figure has much in common with the double-sided relief from Nayatola datable to the Kushana period. Furthermore, we have suggested that these two bear considerable similarity to the famous Didarganj chowrie-bearer, which many would assign to the Maurya period on the basis of its polish and the relative naturalism of some details, both features of capitals atop pillars that can be dated to the mid-third century B.C. because they bear Asoka's edicts. Since the discovery of the Didarganj figure, many have argued for a post- Maurya date, some relating it to Andhra figures from Sanchi and some to works dating as late as the Kushana period.8 But which work might serve as an anchor for determining the date of the others? We believe that it is the Rajendranagar figure, datable to the first or second century, and that the links to the Didarganj figure indicate that it, too, should be assigned to about that time. Thus those who have proposed a Kushana-period date for it are not far from the mark. Figures as apparently nude as the females of the Rajendranagar relief generally do not appear until at least the late first century B.C. The lower torso of earlier female figures, such as those at Bharhut and Bodhgaya, are covered with cloth, diaphanous in the case of the Bharhut figures but still revealing lines of folds where it crosses the legs, and consistently thick in the case of the Bodhgaya figures. On the Rajendrangar figures, however, the garment (for surely one was intended, even if the intention was not to show it) reveals the entire body, as is the case perhaps first on a female figure carved in relief against a pillar from Mathura now in the Mathura Museum and subsequently on the bracket vrksadevata of the Sanchi Stuipa's east gateway.9 By the Kushana period, virtually every female figure from Mathura conforms to this revealing convention and appears essentially nude. While we have already noted another double- sided relief-that is, a relief with front views of virtually identical figures on each side-from Patna, it is at Mathura that such images are found in greater numbers. Such reliefs may have been stimulated by bracket figures, which could be viewed from both sides. Two pre-Kushaina examples from the Kafikali Tila conform to the mode of the Sanchi bracket figures, showing not the double-sided form as we are using the term here but both front and rear views of a female.'0 In the Kushan.a period, however, the double-sided form is exploited for bracket figures, for example, one from the Dig Darvaza at Mathura (Fig. 10), a second from the Kakali Tila,i " and another of unknown provenance in Mathura now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (Fig. 1 1). 12 Other Kushana works that were intended to be seen from both sides also conform to the pattern, illustrating almost identical figures on each side, for example, a pillar capital from the Chamunda Tila at Mathura, whose principal image on each side is a pot-bellied figure seated above a palm flanked by lions.'3 The function of a double-</page><page sequence="3">MAURYA FIGURAL SCULPTURE RECONSIDERED 3 sided dwarf from the Vinayak Tila is not as clear,'4 nor is that of a somewhat later sculpture, probably dating early in the Gupta period, an Uma-Mahesvara image depicted on each side of a large relief.'5 A railing pillar such as the one upon which the Rajendranagar reliefs is carved would be viewed from both sides. At Mathura, however, railing pillars are generally treated differently, that is, not with what we here are calling the double-sided form. The famous Bhiitesar pillars, for example, all show a female on one side (Fig. 12) and a series of panels illustrating a single episode from the Buddha's life or a jataka on the opposite side.'6 And on earlier railings such as those at Bodhgaya and Bharhut, the double-sided form is not applied. Beside the fact that the Rajendranagar sculpture is double-sided and the females of each side appear to be nude, other indications suggest a date no earlier than the first century, and probably one as late as the Kushana period. Among these features are the great tubular earrings worn by the figure on one side, which are identical to those that adorn several of the Bhuitesar females (Fig. 13) and a railing figure from Mathura now in Bharat Kala Bhavan.17 Also, the great loop of cloth along each figure's right hip and thigh is seen for the first time on some of the figures of the Great Stutpa at Sanchil8 and then commonly on Kushana-period female figures, including several of the Bhu-tesar females and the famous bowl-bearing woman from Faizabad.'9 And the coiffure is a feature that cannot be associated with figures any earlier than Kushana times. In particular, the frontal bun decorated with an ornament that is found on the better preserved side of the Rajendranagar relief is again seen on many Kushana images, the Bh-utesar figures as well as the bracket figure in the Victoria and Albert Museum among them, but not on earlier works. Lastly, the stance of the figure shows none of the rigid frontality commonly displayed by the pillar reliefs of Bharhut and Bodhgaya. Rather, the vrksadevata of each side stands so that the right shoulder and hip appear to move forward toward the viewer, the opposite sides of her body receding into the pillar, though with somewhat greater subtlety of movement than the Bh-utesar females show. All these features, then, suggest a date in the Kushaana period, probably early in the time of that dynasty. If the Rajendranagar double-sided vrksadevata relief, like the similar sculpture from nearby Nayatola, may be assigned to the Kushana period, then we must ask about the date of the Didarganj chowrie-bearer. We have already noted that this free-standing sculpture has many features in common with the two double-sided reliefs, so many that it is hard to believe that any significant amount of time separates them, certainly not four hundred years, as would be the case were this a Maurya work. Might the similarities result from their common Pataliputra origin-in fact, the three were found within ten kilometers of one another-rather than chronological proximity? Probably not, for the comparisons above should indicate that they share more in common with sculptures of Kushana date from Mathura than with those of any earlier time. One feature of the Didarganj and Rajendrana- gar sculptures, however, must be explained as a Pataliputra technique rather than a chronologi- cally limited one. That is the brilliantly polished buff-colored sandstone,20 a feature long thought to indicate with certainty a sculpture's Maurya date. Its association with the Maurya period is based largely on the pillars bearing Asoka's in- scriptions and thus surely no later in date than the time of his reign. Of these pillars, all those with lion capitals except the one at Vaisali are similarly polished, although those crowned with other ani- mals are not.2' But one must not assume that be- cause the technique was applied to works of one date, it was exclusive to that time. If the Didarganj chowrie-bearer is not accepted as a Maurya work, then what about the few other figural sculptures often ascribed to that time? The colossal male figure from Parkham, thought by some to be a Maurya work, is much less naturalistic and more relief-like in conception and is in many ways related to such works of undoubted Suniga date as the Bharhut railing reliefs. That leaves the two Patna male chowrie-bearers (Fig. 18) now in the Indian Museum and the Lohanipur torso (Fig. 15) now in the Patna Museum among the only remaining figural sculptures that are candidates for a Maurya date. Yet they, too, we believe, must be contenders for later ascriptions. The two Patna male figures, commonly identified as yakshas, are frequently seen as prototypes of the bodhisattva figures developed at Mathura during Kushana times. Their erect stance, full fleshy belly and naturalistically rendered drapery links them closely with Kushana works. True, the abdomen of the Patna figures is fuller, without the subtle variations of Kushana figures from Mathura, possibly an indicator of their status as yakshas; and the form of the garment is different, rather like a luwgi in the case of the Patna figures</page><page sequence="4">4 FREDERICK ASHER AND WALTER SPINK as opposed to the monastic garment worn by the Kushana Mathura bodhisattvas. Moreover, the treatment of the cloth, in addition to its fashion, may be distinguished: it is thick and marked with diagonal pairs of parallel striations in the case of the Patna figures but thin in the case of the Kushana Mathura bodhisattvas, almost diaphanous, and unmarked with lines where it passes over the legs or across the torso. These distinctions all have been taken as chronological indicators, yet if the Didarganj female figure is reassigned to Kushana times, then the two Patna male figures also must be dated to that time. Not only do they wear a garment similar in form and treatment to that of the Didarganj image, but even the treatment of the sash that runs diagonally across the Didarganj figure's back is essentially identical to that worn across the torso of the Patna images. Thus much more than the polished sandstone links them. Instead of being seen as prototypes of the Kushana bodhisattvas, they should be recognized as contemporary products. The Lohanipur torso (Fig. 15), however, is more difficult to analyze; because it is nude, comparisons of cloth form and accoutrements are not possible. Moreover, the front of the torso lacks the subtle fleshy forms of the Patna figures, although its rear side is modelled in a manner similar to those. Likely, however, its date is not significantly different from that of the Patna figures. The three, we would suggest, date to Kushana times. The two Patna figures are closely related to bodhisattva images from Mathura, and also to Kushana terracottas, as we show below. The Lohanipur torso is related to a significant number of nude tirthafikara figures of Kushana date from Chausa (Figs. 16 and 17).22 If our proposed date for these sculptures is ac- cepted, this leaves us with the total absence of fig- ural imagery at the time when the animal capitals were carved. But this is hardly surprising, since in any case only a mere handful of stone figures in human form, perhaps only four of them, have ever vied for a date contemporary with the mag- nificent and rather widely distributed stone pillars. The conclusion that emerges after taking them away-namely, that anthropomorphic representa- tions were not made in stone in Maurya times- seems to us more compelling than the old one, which saw this small and quite disparate group of figures as unique. Traditionally, two notions have suggested assign- ing these sculptures to Maurya times, one more analytical, the other more romantic. The analyti- cal reason, a comparison with the pillar capitals of Asoka's time, already has been noted. Like these Maurya capitals, the figural sculptures are carved from brilliantly polished buff-colored sandstone. That, however, as the Rajendranagar relief shows, is not restricted to the Maurya period. It was used consistently in Pataliputra though Kushana times. Beside the works discussed, others as well were carved from polished buff sandstone, for exam- ple, a mithuna from Patna City (Fig. 14) dated by the Patna Museum to Sufiga times though likely carved in the Kushana period.23 Parts of this im- age are brightly polished, and in details of the coiffure, earrings, and lower arm encased in ban- gles, the female of the couple shares much in com- mon with the Didarganj image. Without polish, the buff stone continued to be used at Pataliputra through the Gupta period,24 after which the dark grey stone widely used as the medium of sculpture in Magadha replaced it. The more romantic reason for assigning these works to the Maurya period is the assumption of Maurya royal patronage. How could a dynasty as powerful and cultured as this fail to provide figural imagery, the argument seems to run. These figures are, after all, from the Maurya capital, Pataliputra. The assumption of royal patronage, moreover, helps explain a difference that many see between relatively naturalistic works (the royal ones) and more abstract figures (considered popular ones) such as the colossal Parkham male figure or the Bharhut sculptures of Sunga times.25 The assumption of this argument is that royalty, especially royalty in touch with Hellenistic Greece, must favor naturalism, while the people-the native hoi polloi, one can imagine the unspoken argument going-must favor abstractions, even monstrous perversions of nature. This is an argument based on no evidence at all and more than a touch of Orientalism. Once we have taken the Didarganj chowrie- bearer, the Patna chowrie-bearers, and the Lo- hanipur torso out of the Maurya period, the gap that they leave turns out to be no gap at all. The development of style in the representation of the human figure in stone sculpture is far more con- sistent and understandable if we are able to start with the diffident carvings at Sanchi Stiupa num- ber 2 and Bharhut, and move gradually toward a greater realization of perceptual goals, than if we must start with works of "astonishing maturity"26 only to find that the next stage in the evolution is one of diffident youthfulness. But this is exactly what happens if we move from the Patna figures to-</page><page sequence="5">MAURYA FIGURAL SCULPTURE RECONSIDERED 5 ward the Sanchi Stuipa number 2 and the Bharhut railings, rather than see them as impressive repre- sentatives of a style that was developing in the late first and second centuries A.D. Furthermore, once we admit that polish per se by no means guarantees a Maurya date and then move these figures from the Maurya to the Kushana period, we resolve a further problem: we no longer have to explain why this very small group of highly accomplished representations of the human form has no comparable contempo- raries, antecedents, or immediate descendents. It is hard to believe that four such monumental sculptures whose subtle and confident modelling so strongly suggests that they belong to an already well-established tradition ever existed in such sur- prising isolation. Admittedly, related pieces may have been lost, although the loss of great numbers would be easier to believe if they had been made of metal, which could have been melted down for other uses. Life-size stone sculptures would hardly have disappeared so thoroughly if, as the products of a developed tradition, they had once existed in abundance. However, the fact that never has any counterpart turned up in Mauryan contexts per- haps suggests nothing more mysterious than that we have been looking in the wrong place. What we are arguing here is that when we adjust our focus and look within Kushana contexts, we do indeed find their missing counterparts-stylistic, iconographic, and now even technical. Moving the Lohanipur torso up into this same later period brings an even greater sense of clar- ification. For how can we believe that this large hieratic nude figure could have been intended as anything other than a tirthafkara? And if it is a divine image, how could we explain its singular isolation perhaps as much as three hundred fer- tile years before sculptures in any way compara- ble to it (either in style or function) finally make their appearance? Of course if the torso is that of a jina (as it apparently is) and if it were of Mau- ryan date (as apparently it is not), it would suggest an early origin for the Buddha image, too, since early sectarian traditions in India are so linked in their evolution. But the present evidence does not argue this; the nude torso, like the other figures, fits comfortably into a later context. It would have been assigned to a later date long ago were its dat- ing not confused by its presumed "Maurya" polish, for its sensitively fleshy modelling bears some com- parison with that of the bronze tirthafkaras from the same general region (Figs. 16 and 17). Once we remove these figures from the Maurya context, the monumental Maurya pillars with their crowning sculptures quite literally stand alone, depending in their uniqueness upon their imperial patronage, and looking even more than before toward Western Asia for their prototypes, both stylistic and technical. Indeed, even the vaunted naturalism of some of the animal capitals is better explained as reflecting Hellenistic influence than as the herald of an Indian sense of the "natural," which then goes mysteriously underground until about the time of the Sanchi gates; for such "naturalism" is not found either at Bharhut or on the railings of Sanchi Stiipa number 2, despite all of the conceptual charm of those sculptures. Nor is it evident in the terracotta animals of the Maurya period. It is well worth studying the abundant terracotta record, because if the large stone sculptures un- der consideration were indeed of Maurya date, we should expect to find comparable images in clay, just as we do when comparing monumental figures with terracottas in other periods. Terra- cotta figurines of females datable to Maurya times do, of course, abound, but the standard type is highly stylized, folkish, and generally overladen with heavily applied and/or stamped ornaments.27 Such naively forceful figures have little in com- mon with the painstakingly studied and modelled Didarganj female or her male counterparts. Nor do the more subtly modelled terracottas from Bu- landibagh, in which some scholars see Hellenistic influences reflected,28 show a convincing connec- tion with the large stone figures under discussion. Their costuming in particular is totally different; however, instead of expressing concern that "at present such discrepancies cannot be explained,"29 as those who would compare such figures with the Didarganj chowrie-bearer are forced to admit, we would argue that the dilemma disappears as soon as we put two or three hundred years between these disparate works. Significantly, when we do find closely compara- ble terracottas, they are far from the Maurya pe- riod in date, belonging instead to precisely the pe- riod to which we have assigned the polished stone figures on the basis of their many connections with Kushan. a stone sculptures. A consideration of two terracottas illustrated in the catalogue of the exhi- bition From Indian Earth will underline these con- nections. Both, in contrast to all terracotta fig- urines of Maurya date, are monumental in scale, reflecting a general interest in large freestanding sculptures in Kushana times. The first of these ter-</page><page sequence="6">6 FREDERICK ASHER AND WALTER SPINK racottas, a seated image of Hariti (Fig. 20) from KausambT, assigned to the "first century A.D. or later,"30 instead of denying connections with the Didarganj figure, asserts them, albeit without the refinements seen in the latter. The general stance and expression communicate a similar assertive- ness and assurance, but the more precise connec- tions are in the type and disposition of some of the ornaments, notably the very similarly designed armlets and anklets. The heavy necklace falls in the same way between the swollen breasts, while the coiffure in each case is characterized by a large "bun" in front, with the hair combed to either side and finally gathered in a central knot (placed much higher in the terracotta), before descend- ing to shoulder level-a hairstyle that appears to be specifically, and frequently, associated with fe- male imagery of the Kushana period. Admittedly, the Didarganj chowrie-bearer's ornate girdle is ab- sent in the terracotta Hariti, and, too, the latter's garment is treated much more simply, but here again we can find striking counterparts in numer- ous Kushana sculptures from the Mathura region as well as in roughly contemporary ivories found at Begram. A significant number of connections can also be found in certain Gandhara images of the same general period (Fig. 21). The rather deep incisions made to suggest pleats or folds in both this and the second terracotta discussed below may be the more humble pot- ter's way of expediently mimicking the distinc- tive "double-line" pleats seen in both the Di- darganj chowrie-bearer and the Patna chowrie- bearers. Such carefully wrought "double-line" pleats, though understandably absent from the more expediently produced terracottas, are com- monly found in stone carvings from Jaggayyapeta and from the earlier contexts at Amaravati, as well as in many of the Begram ivories-all works that can hardly date before the first century A.D. and more probably should be assigned to the second century." As Philippe Stern perceptively argued years ago, this is but one further feature that links the Patna stone figures to works of a relatively late date rather than to anything from Maurya, or even Sunga, times.32 They might even be seen as conventionalizations or "misunderstandings" of the somewhat more "realistic" plaits formed in various Gandhara sculptures, such as the Hariti mentioned above (Fig. 21). The second terracotta, a headless, standing male (Fig. 19) also from Kausambi and probably from the same workshop as the seated Hariti just discussed, has much of the same authoritative fullness as the Patna chowrie-bearers (Fig. 18) and shows the same confidence in the arrangement of the garment, which falls easily and naturally over the fleshy body.33 Although differences in both medium and func- tion disallow too direct a comparison between such terracottas and the stone pieces under discussion, the connections one can make between them take on a particular significance now that the discov- ery of the highly polished Kushana vrksadevata from Rajendranagar has once again opened up the question of the dating of these important figures. If we are going to understand the development of early Indian sculpture correctly, the proper dat- ing of the Didarganj chowrie-bearer, the Patna chowrie-bearers, and the Lohanipur torso is obvi- ously an issue that has to be resolved and warrants the consideration of all these related works. Our conclusions, we acknowledge, will require the adjustment of a number of long-held assump- tions on the part of those who have accepted the construction of a history of Maurya art that includes these figures. It seems to us that the new evidence demands that we omit all large anthropomorphic representations in stone from the dwindling Maurya repertory. Further, by re- assigning those figures to the Kushana period, Mathura's position during that age as the pre- mier, indeed almost exclusive, center for figural sculpture in all north India is brought into ques- tion. That works were produced elsewhere, even in Pataliputra, during the Kushana period long has been recognized.34 Now, however, we pro- pose that the number of works produced there was greater during Kushana times than was pre- viously recognized. Indeed, among these works were some of the best known in the history of In- dian art.</page><page sequence="7">MAURYA FIGURAL SCULPTURE RECONSIDERED 7 Notes 1. Though commonly identified as a yakshi, there is little conclusive evidence that this should be so but for the popularity of yakshi figures in early Indian art, for example at Bharhut, where the sculptures bear identifying labels. There, however, the chowrie is not an identifying attribute of a yakshi. 2. See, for example, Pramod Chandra, The Sculpture of India, 3000 B.C.-1300 A.D., Cambridge, MA, 1985, pp. 48- 49; and Susan L. Huntington, The Art of Ancient India, New York, 1985.

James C. Harle, The Art and Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent, Harmondsworth, England, 1986, recently suggested a first century date, the time to which he assigns the Great Stiipa at Sanchi, but without arguing the case. The case for that date is meticulously argued by Herbert Plaeschke, "Zur Datierung der 'Cauri-Tragerin' von Didarganj," Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrfif der Martin-Luther- Universitat, Halle-Wittenberg, v. 12, nos. 3-4, pp. 319-30, whose references provide an essentially comprehensive bibliography for the sculpture. A few earlier writers have dated the figure even later. 4. While these figures are commonly identified as yakshas, we are hesitant to identify them so specifically for the same reasons we are reluctant to identify the Didarganj figure as a yakshi. 5.

See Stern, "Les ivoires et os decouvert a Begram," pp. 19-54. 33. A large seated Kubera in the Cleveland Museum of Art may come from the same workshop. See Czuma, Kushan Sculptures, catalogue no. 54, pp. 126-27. The dating of this whole group is disputed, being variously placed between the first and fourth centuries A.D.; we would suggest the second, or even first, century as most likely. 34. See, for example, the bodhisattva from Kumrahar, Patna, now in the Patna Museum (accession no. 3981). The figure is illustrated in Asher, The Art of Eastern India, pl. 2.</page><page sequence="9">MAURYA FIGURAL SCULPTURE RECONSIDERED 9 _z_ _ . $isS tv ' *, i. aw ! 9ipd ,,., , .^, . ft *{ 08^+ . .}&gt;2 \ s lt _ l ;t11 t' . . w801' ' foi _ _ i _ 4 :. &gt;. , , tX8rtrw *s s* * _-- - l | .
