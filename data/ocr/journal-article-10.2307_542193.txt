B. McMINN FROM the title of this essay one recog- nizes immediately that an exhaus- tive study of the fusion of the gods is not intended here. Such a venture would involve the writing of books. It is necessary, therefore, to add certain re- strictive qualifications in order to validate this inquiry and to set forth in perspective the limits and the approach to the problem. This study concerns itself with the sig- nificant religious elements which con- verge in the syncretic culture of Asia Minor during the Roman ascendancy of the Hellenistic period and with the nature of their syncretistic proclivity. In brief, the writer wishes to show that the inter- penetration of the East and the West in Anatolia is evidenced in the syncretistic blend of Hellenistic and Oriental religious ideas and that in this current of culture diffusion an underlying astrological motif is observed. The hypothesis upon which the structure rests primarily is that as- trology is not only concomitant with but also contributory to the syncretic religious tendency and expresses itself particularly in an astral worship embellished with sidereal mythology and with a propensity for magic and mysticism. Thus the focal point of this paper lies in a descriptive analysis of the salient syncretistic features of the native gods in Asia Minor, features which display the astrological presuppo- sition stated above and demonstrate the interpenetration of Eastern and Western culture. First, however, a brief construc- tive summary of astrological influence observed in Greek philosophy and in Oriental religion may be reviewed as a preface apropos to the study. PROLEGOMENA Before the conquests of Alexander the Great and the ensuing reciprocal permea- tion of Greece and the Orient, reflections of Chaldean astrological influence appear in Greek philosophy, viz. in the philoso- phers assigning a place of honor to the heavenly bodies.' This reverence seems to 1 Vide infra for references to Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle. Cf. statements in tragedians: Aeschylus, Agamemnon, et al.

Following Pytha- goras, Plato considers the stars as "visible gods,"' the planets as divine and living bodies.6 These bodies, the supreme Being animates with his own life. Aristotle also propounds the dogma of the divinity of the stars. In them he sees eternal sub- stances and principles of movement, in- dicating their divinity.' Thus the new sidereal theology, attempting to overcome the Olympian bankruptcy,8 has the ap- pearance of a compromise between popu- lar beliefs and monotheism. Although the elements of this theology may be attribut- ed to the logical development of the phi- losophers' own thoughts, it seems likely that in their attempts at the reformation of religion the philosophers were inspired by Oriental astrology and astral worship.' Following the conquests of Alexander the Great, an atmosphere of religious syn- cretism settles throughout the Hellenistic world, particularly in Asia Minor; and an influx of Oriental religious ideas sweeps into the Occident, introducing a variety of religious cults and ceremonial forms. Al- though these various religious types never actually coalesce into one inclusive reli- gious movement, they indicate a tendency toward eclecticism and syncreticism.10 Philosophy and religion become almost indistinct. For as Angus states, "Philoso- phy becomes less Greek and more cosmo- politan, less philosophy and more reli- gion."" Because of the rise of cosmopoli- tanism and the growing awareness of the brotherhood of man, religion transcends national and tribal boundaries and be- comes universal.12 The modulating ele- 2 Gilbert Murray, "Hellenistic Philosophy," The Hibbert Journal, IX (October, 1910), 16-19.

Aristotle compares the spectacle of the vast and ordered movements of the heavenly bodies with the marching forth of Homer's armies before Troy. He felt that behind such various order and strength there must be a conscious mind. It is, therefore, only a step from this to regarding the sun, moon, and stars as themselves divine; and it is a step which both Plato and Aristotle, following Pythagoras and followed by the Stoics, take with assurance.

Under the influence of this Chaldean divination, religious and social institutions in Asia Minor are marked with new meanings. If a dim reflection of astrological influ- ence is observed in the early Greek phi- losophers, a vast light is now apparent in the later Stoics.14 As Murray observes, "Astrology fell upon the Hellenistic mind as a new disease falls upon some remote island people."'5 This "science," through its baneful fatalism, modifies greatly Stoic cosmology. Finding its basis in the Stoic concept of the solidarity and sympathy of the universe,' this sidereal determinism issues in the belief in destiny (dEuappivq),17 the idea of an unavoidable fate which directs the happenings of this world and is tied to the movement of the "stellared heaven." To the twelve constellations and their thirty-six Counselors,"8 to the seven planets as cosmocratories'9 and as chrono- cratories20 is attributed the most potent influence in the determination of man's destiny. Thus arising from the Stoic adap- tation of astrological fatalism is a leaning towards astral mysticism, a spiritual in- tuition based upon the contemplation of the stars.2' The ceaseless harmony of the movements of the cosmos proves the existence of a guiding Providence (7rp6- ota),,22 and in the stars particularly is evidenced the purest manifestation of this divine Reason.2 Contemplation of the starry vault results in a "cosmic emo- tion""24 which unites microcosm and macrocosm. Cumont describes this ecstat- ic communion impressively: As men possessed, or as the corybantes in the delirium of their orgies, he gives himself up to ecstasy, which frees him from the trammels of his flesh and lifts him, far above the mists of our atmosphere, into the serene regions' where move the everlasting stars. Borne on the wings of enthusiasm, he projects himself into the midst of this sacred choir and follows its harmonious movements. Then he partakes in the life of these luminous gods, which from below he sees twinkling in the radiance of the ether; before the appointed hour of death he participates in their divinity, and receives their revelations in a stream of light, which by its brilliance dazzles even the eye of reason.2' To Posidonius, the celebrated Stoic-Peri- patetic of Apamea, is attributed the intro- duction of this reverent contemplation of the heavens into the Stoa.26 Thus he be- comes a great intermediary and mediator 13 Vide Cumont, op. cit., pp. 73-100. 14 For an extensive review vide J.

As in Stoic philosophy also in Oriental religion,28 astrology plays a leading role in determining a world-view. Through the astrological influence fatalism pushes its theory of despair upon man to the crush- ing point.29 Impelled by blind forces, which also cause the celestial spheres to move, man feels himself mastered and helplessly overpowered. He tries to escape from the pressure of this cosmic deter- minism, to free himself from the bondage of Ananke and the caprice of Tyche, but the ceremonies and rituals of the ancient cults are not able to deliver him from this austere dominion. New means of placation and propitiation must be devised to ap- pease the wrath of the astral powers; new methods for exorcising Heimarmene must be discerned.30 Thus each Oriental religion and cultus furnishes its own various pre- scriptions for escaping the powers of an inexorable fate by magic and sorcery, by myths and mysteries, or by gnosis and apotheosis,31 and each of these remedies takes on various astrological accouter- ments. This syncretistic tendency, inextricably linked with an underlying astrological motif, shows itself more clearly in the religions of the heterogeneous culture of Asia Minor. Here the gods of each cult merge with one another, blending diverse elements so as to present a configuration of Greek and Oriental religious ideas. In this syncretic structure the interpenetra- tion of East and West becomes most ex- plicit. Because of the complex fusion of the gods, however, an analysis of the study is difficult. But to facilitate the problem and to restrict its vast implica- tions, one may observe this culture inter- penetration in the syncretic blendings of foreign and local religious elements in the native cults of Asia Minor. The analysis follows the historical method, i.e., a devel- opment of general principles by the con- sideration of the historical facts. No at- tempt is made, however, to set the analy- sis in a chronological framework. NATIVE ANATOLIAN CULTS The character of the Anatolian religion lies in the adoration of the life of nature- that life which is subject to death, but never dies, always reproducing itself in new forms, diverse and yet the same. This perpetual self-identification under various forms, this extinction of death through self-reproduction, is the goal of an enthusiastic worship. It is marked by an utter self-abandonment and absorption in the divine, by a hodgepodge of obscene symbolism and sublime truths, by a repu- diation of moral distinctions and familial bonds which are evidenced in a more de- veloped society but are not found in the free life of nature.32 Although many trap- pings and embellishments as a result of fusion tend to obscure this native Ana- tolian expression, the primitive character evinces itself as the ground or substratum on which the syncretic modifications are 27 Bevan, op. cit., p. 116; Cumont, op. cit., p. 84. 28 Cf.

The blend of these foreign accretions upon this native religious conception is observed most clearly in three native cults of Asia Minor: Men, Cybele and Attis, and Saba- zius. Because the beliefs and rituals of these cults remain exceedingly dim,33 it seems advisable to emphasize the explicit syncretistic character of the gods in each cult, touching upon the cult-ritual when sufficient evidence warrants it. I. MEN Men, an old barbarian Phrygian divini- ty, worshiped throughout Anatolia, but chiefly in Antioch, Pisidia,34 presents a character highly synthetic and complex. The nature of his myth and cult-ritual, both primitive and developed, is un- known. But from scattered evidence per- tailing to the god's various attributes, it seems evident that the cult follows the process of transformation suggested in this essay: That the cult-ritual first is a form of nature-worship stemming from an agrarian myth, then through a process of syncretic fusion, characterized by an as- trological design, it becomes a worship of celestial, cosmic powers. This unique de- velopment is shown in the gods' mixed association with domestic animals and astral motifs, appearing particularly on steles and early Anatolian coins.35 An excellent illustration of this syn- cretism is found on a coin from Antioch. Men is pictured standing, a fully draped figure wearing the Phrygian high-pointed cap and having the horns of the crescent moon above and behind his shoulders.36 (Occasionally, the crescent alone repre- sents him.)"' He rests his left arm on a column to bear the weight of a Victory which he holds in his left hand; in his right hand he holds a long scepter. He raises his left knee to place his left foot on a bull's head lying on the ground. Beside his right foot a cock stands."3 A propensity for magic is probably in- dicated here in the appearance of the cock and the bull's head, for such symbols are widely employed to avert evil.39 Though the representation is not completely clear, it shows, as Ramsay suggests, "the effort of Hellenic anthropomorphic art to indi- cate a complex Divine idea."40 To be sure, it portrays the god's lunar association, in- dicating an underlying astrological motif in the unique syncretism. Although there is some disagreement on this point, the god, by virtue of his name, suggests his astral affinity. It seems certain that the native Phrygian form of the god's name was Man(n)es or Man and that under Greek influence it received the grecized form Mip.4' Through this con- fusion Oriental astrology leaves its im- pression, and Men becomes the moon-god, 88 Kennedy, op. cit., p. 87.

In his Asianic Elements in Greek Civilisation, p. 280, Ramsay writes: "Yet I believe he Men was originally the Hittite of Anatolian Masnes, whose name be- came Mannes, Manes, and in Greek Men; and that originally wings stood out from his shoulders, not the horns of the crescent moon."</page><page sequence="6">206 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES latinized as Lunus.42 Assuredly Men is equated with Salene in Philodemus ;43 and in the Orphic Hymn praising Selene, the goddess, in this case, is called "Men of the bull-horned,""44 an appropriate epithet of the crescent moon. The astrological fea- ture is also recognized in the familiar epi- thet Menotyrannus.46 Under this name the Anatolian tribes from Caria to the far- thest mountains of Pontus worship a lunar god who rules not only the heavens, but also Hades. To his celestial influence are ascribed the growth of planets and the increase of cattle and poultry; under his protection are placed the burial grounds, the farms, and the districts.46 A curious inscription from Lydia indicates that Men was raised to the rank of supreme god: Es 0obs v obpavos, Meyas M vY obpivo6, /Ey4X67 , t 6vales 70ro &amp;Gaarov &amp;oi.47 Other epithets are applied to Men; and a variety of Greek names are associated with him, marking his complex and syn- cretistic nature. The epithet Askaenos, frequently applied to Men in Antioch, Pisidia, indicates an origin from a Phry- gian hero of the dim past. Ramsay sug- gests48 that Aschanaz, who was the eldest son of Gomer, according to the genealogy of mankind in Genesis and I Chronicles,49 is the Askanios who, according to Ho- mer,50 led the Phrygians and Maeonians to aid Priam in the Trojan war. Aschanaz, therefore, as eponymous hero of the land and people, represents the Anatolians. Jeremiah's calling upon Aschanaz (the people of Anatolia) to render judgment against Babylon61 corroborates this iden- tification. The title Men Askaenos, thus, reflects an origin similar to that of the Olympian gods and implies astral apoth- eosis.52 The native epithet Karou (perhaps Carian or Laodicean) bears a complex connection with an old Phrygian deity who became under Greek influences Zeus Laodicenos;53 and in connection with the healing art, Men Karou becomes inex- tricably associated with the physician and savior-god Asclepius,54 who punishes the transgressor with maladies and heals the diseases of the penitent.55 All three gods, Men Karou, Zeus, and Asclepius, are rep- resented frequently as carrying a staff wreathed with a serpent,"6 which repre- sentation often identifies Men with the native god Sabazius. At Maeonia in Lydia Men is brought into connection with Zeus in another light; the two gods are paired as moon-god with sun-god.57 42 Cf. Cicero, De Deorum Natura (Diels, "Doxo- graphi Graeci"), p. 546), 1, who uses the feminine form luna. 4 Philodemus, De Pietas (Diels, "Doxographi Graeci"), p. 546, 15-16.

Further evidence of this fusion is observed on coins, where Men, either ris- ing from a crescent or riding on horseback, may be called by the grecized forms Di- onysus, Apollo, or Hecate,"8 or paired with Demeter and Artemis.59 In all these multifarious identifications demonstrating the syncretic character of this native deity, one factor seems to underlie the Hellenic-Anatolian synthesis, viz. the god's lunar association, which vests him with celestial and chthonic power and raises him from an elemental, ag- rarian deity to the supreme, cosmic god. II. CYBELE AND ATTIS The characteristic complexity and syn- cretism in the Anatolian cults are evi- denced further in the worship of a mother goddess, Magna Mater, known especially as Cybele,"0 and her youthful male con- sort, Attis.61 These two deities in coalition indicate an encounter between a matriar- chal and a patriarchal social system, the former being represented by the Lydians and Central Anatolians and the latter by the Phrygians, the Carians, and of course the Greeks."2 Although the patriarchal displaces the matriarchal system as a higher type of society develops, the primi- tive social system remains as a religious institution, and the male deity is a com- panion of inferior rank to the mother goddess.83 Embodiments of the fertility prin- ciples, these two deities appear frequently under a variety of local and foreign differ- entiating names, epithets, and forms. Ac- cording to Diodorus64 the mother goddess receives the name Cybele from Mt. Cy- belum, where stood one of her earliest sanctuaries. Similarly, Herodotus"5 refers to her as Cybeba, a Lydian goddess, whose temple is at Sardis; and he knows her also as Dindymene, named from Mt. Dindy- mum." Pausanias67 calls her Agdistis, a name derived from a mountain near Pes- sinus. Other local names, apparently de- rived from names of mountains, attribut- ed to Cybele are Idaea,"8 Sipylene,"8 Lo- brine,70 and Pessinuntis.71 As observed, 58 Ramsay, op. cit., pp. 104-5, n. 2, citing Roscher's Lexikon der Griechischen und Romanischen Mythologie.

In his Asianic Element, p. 9, he indicates that in the ancient theocracies religion dictated and directed social forms, that all social organization proceeded from the goddess, who through the god as priest taught the people the rules of right living, good agriculture, the care of domestic animals, and other civilities of life. 64 Diodorus Siculus ("LCL"), III, 58.

From these same areas innumer- able epithets, indicating various aspects of the goddess' character and form, appear in inscriptions and early literature.72 The most common of these epithets, according to Herodotus,73 is Ahr"p OcEv, a term which suggests the highly syncretistic nature of the goddess. Because of his inferior rank in this basically matriarchal religion, Attis does not receive as many names and epithets as Cybele throughout the Anatolian provinces. His significance in the cult lies in the myth which serves as the basis of the cult-ritual.74 Consequently, his nature remains fairly stable. He receives, how- ever, as Frazer75 notes, a few local epi- thets: god of vegetation; tree-spirit; "very fruitful"; "reaped green (or yellow) ear of corn." Foreign influence expands the content of the cult; and, like Men, Cybele and Attis become identified with alien deities. From the Orient Semitic impressions ap- pear in the sensual rites, the presence of the hermaphroditic element, the empha- sis upon mountain temples, and the serv- ice of eunuch priests.'7 Cybele is identified with the Cappadocian Ma77 and the Syri- an goddess Atargatis (Astarte).78 Under Jewish influence in particular, both she and Attis are united with Theos Hypsis- tos, the god of Israel;79 and as a divine duad they are compared with the Phoe- nician Astronoe and her lover, also with the Phoenician-Cyprian Aphrodite and Adonis.80 A Graeco-Persian-Anatolian fu- sion occurs in Lydia in the assimilation of Anahita, the Persian goddess of fertilizing waters,si to Cybele and to Artemis Ephe- sia.82 From this blending Cybele is known as Meter Anahita, Artemis Anahita, or the Persian Artemis.83 Through the conception of Cybele as the lurqp Oe&amp;wv, Greek religion fuses with the cult readily. Her universal mother- hood unites her with Rhea,84 frequently being called the Mother of Zeus.85 Simi- larly, she is considered the great parent of all nature with dominion over the seas and winds and universal power over the natu- ral kingdom.86 Her identity blends with Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Dionysus, and Hecate;87 and she and Attis are compared with Selene and Endymion, as well as with Aphrodite and Adonis.ss Under the im- press of these Greek deities, Cybele re- ceives new attributes; she becomes god- 72 Vide Showerman, op. cit., p. 233. 7 Herodotus ("LCL"), II, IV, 76. 74 Pausanias, The Description of Greece ("LCL"), VII, 9-12; Diodorus Siculus ("LCL"), III, 58-59. 75 Frazer, op. cit., pp. 352-53.

Orien- tal astrology."' Under this stellar influence Cybele's syncretistic associations move from the realm of nature-worship, which deifies the principle of fertility in vegeta- tion, to that of astral mysticism, which is- sues in the doctrine of sidereal immortali- ty.92 Ramsay93 observes the blending of these two divergent aspects on an ancient coin from Lystra, where the goddess of the city is shown wearing the crescent moon upon her head and carrying ears of corn in her hand. The astrological element, however, be- comes more apparent in the syncretism which transforms Attis' character and ele- vates the cult-ritual. In the most popular of the early romantic bucolic myths, Attis is portrayed as a virgin-born shepherd lad who, in penitence for his unfaithfulness to the goddess Cybele, emasculates himself beneath the pine tree and dies. After mourning his death, Cybele restores him to an undying life, and he becomes her consort.94 This myth serves as the rubric for the orgiastic cult-ritual, which in its earliest form signifies the death of vegeta- tion in the winter and its revival in the spring. Participants, incited to ecstatic dances through the flute, cymbals, casta- nets, and tympanun,95 enact this drama as a means of communing with deity and, like Attis, of obtaining new life.96 In this orgiastic worship Attis seems to fuse with Dionysus97 and to bear a close relation- ship to Zeus Sabazius.98 Through his assimilation to Zeus Saba- zius, Attis is identified with the Phrygian Zeus"9 and receives the epithet HTIiras,o00 a common appellation for the Zeus of Phrygia. This interrelationship is evi- denced more clearly in the use of bulls and rams as favorite victims in the mystic rites of each cult.1"' The sacrifice of these animals in the cult of Cybele and Attis issues in the taurobolium and criobolium,o02 i.e. the bathing of the neophyte in the blood of a bull or a ram. Although this rite signifies at first the transfusion of the strength of the beast into the body of the devotee, it receives later, under the influ- ence of Mazdaism, an elevated meaning: the blood, as the principle of life, effects an eternal rebirth of the soul.1'3 In this syn- cretistic development Attis attains greater significance; he becomes a savior-god of celestial import.1'4 His astral aspect is re- flected in the cognomen Menotyrannus, ascribed to him either as "the lord of the 89 Cf.

Attis, the Anatolian god of vegeta- tion, becomes a celestial deity who offers his initiates a new hope of immortality: that their souls will return after death to their celestial source. Cybele, the goddess of fertility, becomes also a celestial, cos- mic power, particularly the moon-goddess. Thus under the influence of Chaldean divination, the "new" sidereal myth dis- places the primitive agrarian myth; and Cybele and Attis become cosmic powers who overcome the fatal law imposed on mankind by extending astral immortality to the initiated. III. SABAZIUS One other Anatolian deity deserves consideration in this discussion: the Thra- co-Phrygian god Sabazius. Like the other native deities, Sabazius' original nature has become somewhat obscure because of syncretistic tendencies. Enough evidence remains, however, to demonstrate the ele- vation of the cult in the fusion motivated by interpenetrating cultures which have a predilection for astrological motifs. Greek influence on the cult of Sabazius is evidenced in the Sabazius-myth'08 and in the names of Olympian gods associated with the Thraco-Phrygian deity. Clement of Alexandria,'o9 delineating the barest de- tails of the myth, equates Sabazius with Dionysus, the Phrygian Zeus. This Zeus Sabazius, under the form of a bull, con- sorts with Demeter his mother, who gives birth to Persephone. Demeter learns of the deception and demands as a shame penal- ty Zeus' emasculation. To fullfil this obli- gation, Zeus pretends to emasculate him- self, but instead he takes the severed or- gans of a ram and throws them into Demeter's lap as proof of his repentance. Later, however, under the form of a ser- pent, he ravishes Persephone, who in turn gives birth to a child in form of a bull. Hence the mythological poet writes: The bull is father of a snake, and the snake the father of a bull.n10 In some way this myth symbolizes the life of nature dying and reviving every year;"' and the devotee, enacting this drama in a wild orgiastic fashion, participates in the life-giving nature of the god. Thus as a god of nature and vegetation under the sym- bols of a ram, bull, and snake, Zeus Saba- zius is identified with Attis, Adonis, and Dionysus,112 and is frequently paired with Cybele instead of Demeter."3 Under the influence of Oriental astrolo- gy Sabazius acquires new attributes as well as new names and epithets. He be- comes identified as the solar deity with 105 Cumont, Les Religions Orientales dans le Paganisme Romain, pp. 58; 227, n. 53, cites Corpus Inscriptiorum Latinorum, VI, 499. 106 Julian, Orations ("LCL"), V. 168 D: Mithra is the symbol of the sun; cf.

It seems fairly certain that the syncretism has its source in astral associations. A quarter-shekel found at Gaza and struck about 350 B.C.116 shows the Hebrew god- head as a solar Zeus.117 The bearded divin- ity sits enthroned wearing a long garment, which covers his right arm and extends to his ankles. His throne is a winged and wheeled seat; the wing is connected to the axle of a six-spoke wheel and rises high behind his back. In his outstretched left hand, the god holds an eagle or a hawk. An ugly bearded head is set before him in the lower right-hand corner, and above him are inscribed the Phoenician letters YHW, the triliteral form of the divine name Yahweh. Zeus, in the form of a bearded god enthroned with an eagle on his hand, frequently appears in art as the sky-god;11 and, as Cook points out, the winged wheel is solar in origin."11 This con- nection between Zeus and Yahweh is heightened perhaps as a result of the Hel- lenistic reforms of Antioch Epiphanes,120 who in 168 B.C. transformed the temple at Jerusalem into a temple of Zeus Olympius and the temple at Mt. Gerizim into a temple of Zeus Xenius.121 It is to be ob- served also that the solar nature of Yah- weh is confirmed by the fact that lao, a variant of Yahweh, occurs frequently in magical papyri as an equivalent to Zeus and Helios.122 The essential union of Zeus Sabazius as the sun-god with Yahweh of the Old Tes- tament may be the result of a bizarre ety- mology. For example, the title lao Sabaoth, found on an onyx amulet, is at- tributed to a youthful, beardless Zeus en- throned with a scepter, eagle, and thun- derbolt ;123 and it is commonly known also as the significant appellation for Yahweh, marking him as the celestial deity of the Old Testament, the "Lord of Hosts." The etymological affinity is seen more clearly in the Septuagint translation of the title as KbpLOS aGpcO1'24 with the cult-title KbptLO Zaa6Los.125 From these names arise two descriptive epithets "Hypsistos" and "Megistos,"126 both indicating astral attributes. The god of this Sabazius-union is worshiped as the supreme lord, "the god of heaven." Purifications are practiced in order to remove hereditary impurities and to blot out original sin.127 Like the Jews of strict Judaism, the initiates of the Sabazi- us-cult believe that before death their good angels will conduct them to the banquet of the blessed, where a liturgical meal foreshadows the eternal joys.128 The assimilation of Babylonian astrolo- gy in the syncretic fusion of Sabazius and Sabaoth indicates again an elevating ef- fect. Lake, noting this truth, writes: 114 Inscription 95 found by W. M.

EPILEGOMENA Without a recapitulation of evidence already presented, two general observa- tions may be drawn in conclusion as a synthesis to the study. First, it is clear that the complex character of the native Anatolian deities indicates a fusion of Greek, Anatolian, and Oriental religious ideas, marking the interpenetration of the East and the West in the primitive cults of Asia Minor. The contributions of each cultural force to this amalgam is reflected in the descriptive analyses. The Anatolian contribution, almost obscured in the ele- vating syncretism, is evidenced in nature- worship and in evanescent matriarchy. Rooted in a cult-ritual stemming from an agrarian myth, the adoration of nature serves as a substratum on which antitheti- cal elements of the East and West con- verge and permeate each other. In con- junction with this primitive worship there remains a vestige of the old matriarchal system; the earth, source of all life and productivity, is hypostatized and wor- shiped in the form of the goddess Cybele, the Great Mother. Her devotees antici- pate immortality at death in their return to the earth. The Greek contribution is observed in the appropriation of Greek names for the native gods and in the modification of vile barbaric characteristics of primitive cult- ritual. Evidence on coins, steles, inscrip- tions, papyri, and in Greek literature indi- cates the predominating influence of the Greek language throughout the Anatolian provinces. This phenomenon, Ramsay notes,180 is a result of the broad sweep of Greek education and of native readiness to adopt Hellenic culture. On these coins, steles, etc., the names of the native deities are grecized, and the deities themselves are usually identified with various Hel- lenic divinities. Along with this modifica- tion the rational spirit of the Greek genius adds elevation and ideality to the cult- rituals, simulating barbaric sacrifices and offensive emasculations. Yet, as Walton asserts,'31 the cults of Asia Minor are basically Oriental and native; Hellenic education and custom import a certain superficial alteration to them without depositing any really Greek character. The Oriental contribution, ostensibly the most significant in the fusion of the gods, is evidenced in the identification of the native deities with various Oriental divinities and in the introduction of as- trological motifs. The mixed association of deities corresponds to the Hellenic in- fluence mentioned above, but the astro- logical innovation is a unique phenomenon which becomes the chief characteristic of the elevating syncretistic tendency. Under the impress of Chaldean astrology the Oriental polytheistic system is marked by a trend toward monotheism, a trend which finds its highest expression in solar henotheism. This expression demon- strates by astral apotheosis the transfor- mation of native deities from elemental nature-gods to cosmic celestial powers. The result of this divine celestial ascent issues in the timely doctrine of sidereal immortality, which is the reward of every votary at death. 12, K. Lake, "Proselytes and God-Fearers," The Beginnings of Christianity, V, 94. 130 Ramsay, The Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, p. 131. 131 Walton, "Anatolian Deities," The Oxford Classical Dictionary, p. 48.</page><page sequence="13">FUSION OF THE GODS 213 Thus it is clear that the complex charac- ter of the native Anatolian deities reveals an underlying astrological motif which is not only concomitant with but also con- tributory to the elevating religious syn- cretism, and that this motif blends Diony- sian and Apollo'nian elements in an astral worship embellished with sidereal mythol- ogy, magic, and mysticism. As indicated in the Prolegomena, Orientalism in the form of this Chaldean divination revital- izes the cult-mysteries to provide man's escape from a cosmic determinism. "New" sidereal myths displace the primitive agrarian myths, and the native nature- gods become supreme celestial powers who overcome the law of an inexorable fate imposed upon mankind by extending as- tral immortality to the initiated. Here the restraint of reason, characteristic of Hel- lenic genius, yields to Oriental mysticism, and the East in the form of religion be- comes an integral part of the West.
