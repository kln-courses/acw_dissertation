<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Anson Laytner, Arguing With God: A Jewish Tradition (Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aronson, 1990). xxii + 314 pages. This is a book that needed to be written. Anson Laytner, who is Director of the Jewish Federation Community Relations Council of Greater Seattle and a Reform Rabbi, has brought together familiar and unfamiliar material and analyzed it historically and theologically. The sources that Laytner has assembled have a power and a relevance that leap out from the page. In the Introduction and Overview, Laytner identifies the basic form he will discuss, the law-court pattern of address to God, in which complaints and charges against God are allowable. He, then, sets the importance of his research in the post-holocaust theological context, maintaining that arguing with God is a form of post-holocaust Jewish theology. Laytner begins with the evidence from the Bible (Chapter One): Abraham and Sodom [Genesis 18] and Moses' spirited defense of the people [Exodus 5 and 32; Numbers 14], showing the emergence, in these earliest strata of the tradition, of the basic themes: questioning of God over the issue of justice; the appeal to God to act for the merit of the ancestors, the covenant, and sake of His' Name; and confession of guilt (7-12). Laytner, then, moves to Jeremiah and Psalms where he shows the national and the personal lament as a form. The text of Psalm 44 is always a shock to read. In various classes, I ask students to read this psalm out loud, with full voice and full expression of the anger, indeed the rage, that permeates this psalm. Laytner presents it and, together with passages from Jeremiah, points out several new elements: the command tense used to address God when demanding justice, the presentation of God as defendant as well as judge, the appeal to past historical redemptive deeds, and the cry for vengeance against the enemy (26-9). Finally, Laytner analyzes the Book of Job, the apex of the law-court form, with its oaths, its fierce accusations, and its "answer" which is really not an answer but in which "God ... is expressing approval of Job's vociferous insistence of his innocence and of his right for justice" (34). Extending the Job text from the personal to the national, Laytner concludes that the message was not 'It is my practice to use inclusive language, even in reference to God. However Laytner, following his sources, does not and I shall respect his convention. 105</page><page sequence="2">Modern Judaism to despair but to hope for ultimate redemption and justification (36- 7). Laytner, then, deals with the evidence from the rabbinic sources: interpretations of the biblical passages and motifs (Chapters Two and Three); special prayers (Chapters Four and Five); and the statutory liturgy and poetry (Chapters Six and Seven). Laytner's analysis of these rabbinic materials leads him to seven important conclusions. First, the rabbis made the protest argument more explicit than it is in the biblical text. For example: God can be said to commit an act of desecration of His Name; Moses can be said to be God's advisor and God learns from him; Moses seizes God by His garment when addressing Him; and Moses acts as the master lawyer in formally dissolving God's vow to destroy the people (46-56). Second, the rabbis emphasized the anthropopathism of the biblical sources, making it more explicit, indeed deeper. Thus, God is pre- sented as both wrathful and as grief-stricken; God punishes but He feels the people's pain and suffers with them. The clearest text for this is Lamentations Rabbah where the heroes and heroines of Jewish history speak out on behalf of the people (70-85). I agree, and regret only that Laytner did not note that the late Max Kadushin had already pointed out this emphatic trend in rabbinic thinking. Third, the rabbis recognized the tradition of the protest prayer based on individual merit. For example, the audacious oath of Honi, the circledrawer, "I swear by Your great name that I shall not move from here until You show mercy to Your children" (89) and similar traditions (89-92). However, the rabbis also recognized the danger in this type of prayer (indeed, in any appeal to the supernatural) because such appeals constituted a threat to the rational legal authority of the rabbinic system. Hence, protest prayer was discouraged and highly restricted to times of communal emergency, to be used only after all other methods were exhausted, and then to be performed only by the most righteous rabbis (94-101; 116-7). Fourth, protest was suppressed in the statutory liturgy, though it was permitted in midrash. For example, there is a text which forbids a Jew to pray, "Your mercies extend to a bird's nest" (103). Laytner understands this passage, together with the Jerusalem Talmud, as one which is intended to contest God's justice (109) and sets it within the broader issue of theodicy texts (106-7). As a protest midrash, the bird's nest text expressed the people's doubt, perhaps even their despair. But, as a protest prayer, the same text had the effect of trying to force a revelatory or redemptive action from God. This latter was unacceptable to the rabbis who realized that they needed to sustain the people on a daily basis which could not be done in an atmosphere of impending messianism. The very length of the exile moved the 106</page><page sequence="3">rabbis to suppress the protest-prayer as a form of address to God, though they allowed the motif to find its place in the midrash (85, 108-10). (See also the suppression of the recitation of Psalm 44 [Tal- mud, Sotah 48a]). Fifth, the submissive-penitent form of prayer was adopted as the liturgical stance under the leadership of Akiba (116). Laytner details the strategies which were permitted in the statutory liturgy: one could quote God's words back to Him, e.g., "redeem us according to Your word," "remember the covenant with the ancestors," and the recitation of the "thirteen attributes" with the midrashic understanding of the origin of that text; one could appeal to past precedents, especially those rooted in the intervention of the main figures of Jewish holy history (see the Aneinu prayer cited on 162-3); and, to be sure, one could confess the sins of the people (117-26). Sixth, the tension between protest prayer and submissive prayer could not be fully repressed. Thus, the medieval prayerbook "jux- tapose[d] the liturgy of faith with the poetry of protest" (157). For example: the poem, based on a biblical verse cited in the liturgy "There is no God besides You," which plays on the Hebrew text and reads, "There is none like You among the dumb"-a stunning protest writ- ten just after the second crusade (135-7); and the poem, based on the imagery of the Akeda, which describes the actual sacrifice of chil- dren-again, written after a crusade (145, 157). These poems have as their form: a submissive introduction in accordance with rabbinic ideology, a strong protest, and a closing petition (147). They develop the theme of vindictiveness and give voice to a new argument-the merit of the martyrs (149-51) though this theme is an extension of the merit of the ancestors argument. The presence of this protest poetry returned wholeness to Jewish prayer (139) by giving expression to the darker thoughts Jews had about God (176). Laytner suggests to the Reform movement that these poems be revived and integrated into contemporary liturgy (176). For myself, I have always found these poems to be too "artistic"; they appear to me to lack the raw power of the psalms of protest, even though they do restore a measure of unpleasant truth to the formal liturgy which had, indeed, suppressed the angry protest motif. Seventh, the rabbinic argumentation was developed to counter Gnostic and Christian beliefs (63-9; 100). I find Laytner's evidence on this unpersuasive. It seems to me that the inner logic of injustice, especially in the post-destruction period, surely generated enough tension to create these rabbinic developments. The high point of this book may be in Chapter Eight. In it, Laytner deals with the modern materials. He begins with the hasidic traditions, concluding with the protest-threat of the Kotzker Rebbe: "Send us Reviews 107</page><page sequence="4">our Messiah, for we have no more strength to suffer. Show me a sign, O God. Otherwise I rebel against You. If You do not keep Your covenant, then neither will I keep the promise, and it is all over: we are through with being Your Chosen People, Your unique treasure" (189). Although echoed in the early rabbinic materials, this statement (and there are others like it) is still audacious to the point of being almost heretical. Following this, Laytner, with Roskies and Mintz, moves to the popular and secular literature of protest, including Bialik's poem in which God calls us to rebel against Him (192-3). Moving into the holocaust and post-holocaust literature, Laytner cites from Glatstein, Greenberg, Zeitlin, Segal, Moldowsky, Katze- nelson and others. This material is very bitter. "You watched... There is no God in you, false, empty heavens" (203); "We shall re- member, Lord God, that in these years, You settled with Your eternal people every old score" (206); "O God of Mercy/For the time being/ Choose another people./We are tired of death, tired of corpses,/We have no more prayers.... /Grant us one more blessing-/Take back the gift of our separateness" (207-8); and the din Torah tradition which grew up in the camps: "Creator of the worlds, You are mighty and terrible beyond all doubt. But from the circle of true lovers of Israel, we Galicians, forever shut You out" (206, with note 50 for other incidents). Laytner identifies five characteristics of the modern protest forms: [1] the "for our sins" mentality is rejected; [2] the material is created by poets and authors and not by rabbis, with the result that there is a transition from liturgy to folk forms; [3] the texts are addressed to the people, though God is often present in the background; [4] the forms embrace many differing attitudes and experiences, foreground- ing none in particular; and [5] the law-court pattern in conspicuously absent, except in the din Torah form (196-7). Finally, Laytner makes two constructive theological moves. First, beginning with two poems by Glatstein-"I love my sad God, my brother refugee... The God of my unbelief is magnificent, how I love my unhappy God, now that he's human and unjust" (209) and, "Begin once more! Be a small God of a small people!" (210)-Laytner comments (210): Glatstein has undertaken a remarkable odyssey, from doubt to despair, from anguish to anger, and on to reconciliation of a sort and rebirth. His intensely anthropomorphic God is far from the gods of modern philosophy and theology, but very true to classical Jewish religious thought. Perhaps his vision of a broken, anthropopathetic God, a God who is being rejuvenated as the Jewish people is reju- venated, a God with whom one can argue, will speak to the many 108 Modern Judaism</page><page sequence="5">Jews still struggling for some sort of relationship with God after the Holocaust. Second, moving through a poem by Shimoni in which God weeps so much that the poet has pity on Him, Laytner arrives at Elie Wiesel and engages in an extended analysis of the theology implicit in Wiesel's writings (214-27). Laytner begins with Night, moves to Ani Maamin which he correctly identifies as a midrash on Lamentations Rabbah, and then turns to The Trial of God. This, it seems to me and I think Laytner would agree, is the central work of Wiesel's oeuvre for, in it, the form of argument and protest is returned to its full stature. The "hero," Berish the innkeeper, defies and protests all the way through the play with increasing vigor: "I lived as a Jew, and it is as a Jew that I die- and it is as a Jew that, with my last breath, I shall shout my protest to God! And because the end is near, I shall shout louder! Because the end is near, I'll tell Him that He's more guilty than ever" (219). Similarly, the "counter-hero," Sam/Samael/Satan is the only being ready to "defend" God, slowly seducing all but Berish into his rea- soning, until the explosive ending. This ending is not, as Laytner points out, inconclusive (220); on the contrary, it is exactly what Wiesel wants-an ending that affirms unadulterated protest in the light of injustice. In the course of this analysis of Wiesel, Laytner sets forth two principles which characterize Wiesel's position and which serve as the basis for Laytner's second constructive move. First, there is Wiesel's "faithful defiance," embodied in Berish's position and, second, there is his "defiant activism," rooted in the words of a character from another Wiesel work: "Maybe God is dead, but man is alive... Suf- fering is given to the living ... it is man's duty to make it cease" (221- 5). In his last chapter, Personal Afterword (231-48), Laytner iden- tifies his own positions: he is a liberal, and non-halakhic; he is an "agnostic mystic"; he does not believe in petitionary prayer most of the time; suffering is simply unjust, not a test or a discipline; belief in God in the modern world is more rooted in doubt than in faith; one must, therefore, keep the wounds of faith open and not allow them to scar over; the rabbi too often becomes the defense attorney for God, not the prosecutor for the people; the covenant is the bond to the past and should be preserved as such; and knowledge of the protest tradition, in all its variety and depth, should enable us to use the vocabulary of protest and to develop the theology implied therein-a theology of interdependence. In reflecting on this rich book, I realize that I was familiar with Reviews 109</page><page sequence="6">most of these texts before reading the book. However, seeing them displayed together and reading them in the context of a rabbinic expansion of the biblical motif and a secular expansion of the rabbinic motif was very enlightening. As a constructive theologian, I want to affirm Laytner's revival of the law-court pattern of address to God as a form of Jewish theology, together with his adoption of Wiesel's positions of faithful defiance and defiant activism. It seems to me that it is our responsibility as theologians to bring the word to the Word, to defend the victim even if we have to accuse God. Laytner is right; there is ample precedent for this and we need to do it-for ourselves, for the victims, and indeed for God. I want to affirm, too, Laytner's inclination to understand God in anthropopathic language. As Hes- chel has shown, this was the main language of the tradition until the dominance of philosophy. However, I am less sanguine about a "bro- ken, anthropopathetic God . .. who is being rejuvenated as the Jewish people is rejuvenated." Such an image seems to me to relieve God of God's responsibility. If God is creator and parent, then God is re- sponsible. We may, indeed we must, argue; but we must not, in love or in fear, deny either God's power or ours, either God's responsibility or ours. Dialogue-argument must be between parties with real claims, between parties who will not back down from the justice and com- passion which motivates them. Arguing With God is a powerful book-in its material and in the argument which it provokes on this eternal theme. DAVID R. BLUMENTHAL Emory University 110 Modern Judaism</page></plain_text>
