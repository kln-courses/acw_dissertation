Marco Sgarbi Rcccivcd: 10 August 2013 /Acccpted: 13 August 2013 / Published online: 4 September 2013 © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013 David Roochnik's book aims to re-evaluate the role and significance of Aristotle and Aristotelian philosophy in contemporary philosophical discussions. It fits into a well established line of research developed over the last three decades which has rediscovered Aristotle's thought and the way in which he posed and solved problems. Signs of a revival of Aristotelian philosophy were particularly evident in the philo sophical debate of the first half of the twentieth century. With the 'rebirth of practical philosophy' (Rehabilitierung der praktischen Philosophie) in the works of authors such as Leo Strauss, Eric Voegelin and Hannan Arendt at first, and then with Alasdair Maclntyre and Martha C. Nussbaum, Aristotle has been on the agenda of philoso phers, in particular those involved in ethics and politics. But the 'Aristotle revival' really exploded only when the importance of Aristotelian philosophy was reassessed by scientists and philosophers of mind. Consider, for instance, Wolfgang Kullmann's chapter on 'The Relevance of Aristotelian Biology for Embryology and Genetics', in his Aristoteles und die moderne Wissenschaft ( 1998), in which he already emphasized that the discovery of the DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953 was based on the Aristotelian intuition of the concept of form in biology, or Hilary Putnam, who devoted two essays in his Words and Life (1994) to 'The Return of Aristotle' and 'Aristotle after Wittgenstein', or to the heated debate triggered by Miles Burnyeat's paper 'Is an Aristotelian Philosophy of Mind Still Credible?' It is from here that Roochnik begins his account, and his investigation is a welcome addition to this pivotal topic. In general, his approach is almost entirely theoretical, scarcely touching on contemporary reflections on the re-use of Aristotle; but this may make his ideas more attractive to a wider readership. Roochnik makes the explicit claim that Aristotle's thought can save us in this time of crisis because his philosophy is capable of responding to the most important challenges of the twentieth-first century. Indeed, he seems to present Aristotle more as a pop-star than M.

The rehabilitation of Aristotle is possible, for Roochnik, only by reasserting anthropocentrism: the view that human beings are the centre of the cosmos, not just one part of it among many others. Roochnik's perspective is anthropocentric only in the sense that his idea of philosophy is first and foremost centred on human beings. He is careful to distinguish his position from other forms of anthropocentrism such as the view that everything has a value only in relation to human beings or relativism, both of which were attacked by Aristotle in one way or another. Roochnik regrets the stripping away of all anthropomorphic vestiges of Aristotelian philosophy by modem science and shows how, from the human standpoint, Aristotle's thought is not merely consistent and credible, but also necessary 'to save the world' (p. 16). He declares that, personally, he prefers Aristotle's cosmos to the scientific universe; and his book aims to explain why Aristotle's science, metaphysics, politics and ethics are still indispensable for understanding everyday life. His stance is clearly polemical, in that he is arguing for a revision of the status quo by attempting to save our ordinary experience of the world, which is immediate and evident and orients us in knowing and acting, contrary to the counterintuitive explanations of modem science. For this reason, Roochnik starts from a reconsideration of the role of Aristotelian endoxa, reputable or entrusted opinions, in shaping ordinary experience. In the first chapter, he analyses Aristotle's conception of universe and offers a defence of his arguments, showing how it is natural for us to believe that there are only three dimensions or that elements naturally move to their natural place. More interesting, perhaps, is the second chapter on teleology. In contrast to scientists working in contem porary laboratories exclusively on efficient cause, Roochnik emphasizes the importance of the final cause and of the finalism of nature, but not, of course, in the naive sense that everything has an end or that all nature is directed towards an end. Rather, the purposiveness of nature is a heuristic strategy to understand the world and its phenom ena: it explains how nature works according to our common experience of it. Aristotelian teleology is the perfect middle way between the Intelligent Design theory and evolutionary biology because it affirms the purposiveness of nature 'without succumbing to the temptation of a Grand Designer' (p. 57). Roochnik then goes on to examine some intuitive Aristotelian theses such as the notion that some beings are natural while other are not or that nature is hierarchical. In particular, however, he praises the fact that even when successful, Aristotelian science is purposeless, in that it does not aim to transform nature or to control natural forces: it is not technologically oriented. The goal of Aristotelian science is, instead, to look at and to understand nature as it is. Chapter three is about Aristotle's multifaceted concept of being and his metaphysics. For Roochnik, Aristotle's naïve realism, rooted in the collaborative working of perception (iaisthesis) and understanding (nous), provides us with direct awareness of the external world, which is more functional in describing substances and opposes some forms of idealism which assert that no world exists apart from mind, and some forms of scepticism according to which we cannot trust our senses. He maintains, as well, that this ontological interpretation of Aristotle's metaphysics leads directly to the philoso pher's theological conclusion that there is one perfect substance on which all other substances depend in various ways. He calls Aristotle's metaphysics 'ecologist' because the world is a cosmos, that is, an ordered whole in which all beings have their place, •Ö Springer</page><page sequence="3">158 M. Sgarbi whether in the natural or the political sphere. In rehabilitating teleology and Aristotle's ecologist metaphysics, we stand firmly on the side of life, against the culture of death in which, according to Roochnik, modern science has thrown us. It allows us not only to rethink our standing in the world, but also to have a deeper insight into controversial ethical issues such as abortion, stem-cell research, human cloning and euthanasia. For Roochnik, Aristotle is 'pro-life' (p. 109), but not in every sense, since he endorses the limited use of abortion and euthanasia. What interests Roochnik, however, is not the particular position defended by Aristotle on these topics, but rather his way of reasoning, which is not based on the trivial scientific distinction between the living and the inanimate. The fourth chapter is mainly on Aristotle's psychology. Roochnik stresses the intimate connection between the various faculties of the soul - nourishing, perceiving and thinking - which is grounded in a threefold scheme constituted by object, subject and what the subject receives and transforms from the object, which is not necessarily the object itself. This general scheme underlies each process of the soul and is defined as a kind of'phenomenology' which makes possible the mind's encounter with the world. This encounter itself is, for Roochnik, a kind of 'truthing' of the world, that is, in Heideggerian terms, a disclosure of the human being, a mode of human life in the world (p. 147). The fifth chapter continues the argument of the previous one by claiming that what Aristotle says about the separate, immortal, divine and eternal mind has nothing supernatural in it, being 'steadfastly worldly', since divinity and eternity are seldom available to us during our lives. This 'immortality' is possible when we pursue our goal, as human beings, of devoting ourselves to the theoretical life. The theoretical life must not, however, be confused with contemplation; it is, instead, the activity at which a human being excels, that is, a realization of inner potentialities. In some cases, theorizing could be practical wisdom (p. 181). In both this and the final chapter, Roochnik deals with ethical and political issues, focusing on the problem of ethical virtues, habits, happiness and the constitution of the city for the best possible human life. He discusses and criticizes Aristotle's justification of slavery and of woman's place in society. In conclusion, this book may stimulate non-philosophers to read philosophy, especially Greek philosophy, but it will be of little interest to historians of classical philosophy. Nonetheless, it has the merit of making Aristotle's arguments significant for contemporary philosophical discussions of broad, general topics - 'In any case, back to Aristotle' (p. 15). &lt;0 Springer</page></plain_text>
