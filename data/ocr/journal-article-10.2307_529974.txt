Hallo "Every so often, a field of study is revolutionized by a single discovery or a unique hypothesis. Before Writing promises to play such a role in our understanding of the emergence of civilization." -FROM THE FOREWORD BY WILLIAM W. HALLO In her revolutionary study, Schmandt-Besserat uses archaeological and epigraphic information to offer convincing evidence that writing was not a sudden and spontaneous invention, but rather the outgrowth of thousands of years' worth of experience at manipulating symbols.
