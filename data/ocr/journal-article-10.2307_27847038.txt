<plain_text><page sequence="1">G. E. Hutchinson Marginalia Man Talking or Thinking Two new books on animal communication suggest fundamental questions about human speech and thought?and how the two are related And Julian Huxley we leave an ant, a bee An axolotl and Aldous; item to Bert rand Russell we l?ave belief in God (D.V.) Auden and MacNeice, "Their Last Will and Testament" (1) The late C. H. Ogden, co-author with L A. Richards of The Meaning of Meaning and the begetter and promulgator of Basic English as an international language, was at one time much interested in the ways in which nonhuman animals commun icate with each other. He produced an English translation of ForePs classic Le Monde social des fourmis (2). It is also related that when upset by the apparent lack of inter est in the whole subject he once said to his secretary, later to become a very distinguished clinical psychol ogist (3), "You are the Society for the Study of Animal Communica tion, of which I am president. I will now dictate to you the annual presi dential address." This he certainly intended to publish as delivered to the society. It may well have ap peared in the Cambridge Magazine; I have not been able to consult a complete file of that journal. Since this incident occurred, there has been a steady increase in inter est in the subject. We now have im portant books by two of the most perceptive students of the area, in which a vast amount of information on animal communication is used to G. E. Hutchinson, Sterling Professor of Zoology Emeritus, Yale University, is well known to American Scientist readers for his occasional articles on a wide diversity of topics. Address: Osborn Memorial Laborato ry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520. 22 American Scientist, Volume 64 explore certain more general mat ters. These books are E. 0. Wilson's Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (4) and W. H. Thorpe's Animal Na ture and Human Nature (5). The author of the first is American, a professor at Harvard University, and the greatest living myrmecolo gist. The author of the second is British, a professor emeritus at Cambridge University, and the leading investigator of bird song now working, though with a back ground in insect physiology. Philo sophically Wilson seems to lean a little toward Camus, who appears on page 4 at the beginning and on page 575 at the end of the text; but his work is also prefaced by a quo tation from the Bhagavad-Gita. Ex plicit metaphysical considerations are however intentionally not ad mitted to his work, though here and there some small ones may slip under the barrier. Thorpe, a mem ber of the Society of Friends, whose book is the published version of the Gifford Lectures given at St. An drews University, 1969-71, writes in the Christian tradition; he has con siderable sympathy with the type of philosophic pluralism developed by Sir Karl Popper. Both authors are male. All these facts have some bearing on what we learn from the books but no relation to the very high quality of the science con tained in both of them. As conflict of interest statements seem to be increasingly required in all sorts of activity, I would add that I am very proud to have both authors as friends. Language and the social life of animals E. 0. Wilson's Sociobiology: The New Synthesis is exactly what its title proclaims?a learned, lively, and beautifully illustrated account of all the phenomena of social life in animals, with a glance at slime molds and colonial myxobacteria. Like Wilson's earlier work The In sect Societies, it belongs in the tra dition of Forel and W. M. Wheeler, a tradition here expanded to cover the whole animal kingdom. Wheeler was Wilson's intellectual grandfath er, though they never knew each other. Their work has the common character of welding vast masses of minute detail, often of the taxo nomic kind that irks many modern investigators, into syntheses of great importance and general inter est. This kind of extensive approach is the method of much biology: the method of Darwin and Freud, it is as legitimate as the intensive meth od of Newton and Einstein, though it is sometimes scorned by people who want at all costs to make their science "scientific." Wheeler might have carped at some of the termi nology?such as "allopreening"? that has crept into the field since his time, and the present writer, being, in Wheeler's terminology, fundamentally a high-church sherry and port man, would tend to agree. Wilson is very moderate in his in troduction of new terms, and in spite of "sociology" and its inevita ble derivative "sociobiology," he avoids miscegenation on the few oc casions when he finds a really new word necessary. Sociobiology, like other books, is di vided into three parts. The first part deals with social evolution and is largely a preliminary exposition of animal demography and of those aspects of population genetics treating kin selection and the prob lems of the origin of what in an evo</page><page sequence="2">lutionary sense are called altruism, selfishness, and spite. Here W. D. Hamilton's (6) concept of inclusive fitness, or the sum of an individu al's genetic fitness and of all the dif ference that it makes to the homol ogous parts of the fitnesses of the individual's relatives, is of para mount importance. An evolutionary altruistic act is defined as one that, while lowering the fitness of the actor, raises the inclusive fitness to a value higher than it would have had without the altruism. Wilson's presentation is very telling, even if some reservations may be felt about the terminology. The chapters of the first part of Sociobiology pro vide a splendid source of a great deal of information that one ought to have known but didn't. In view of the deserved but remarkable suc cess of the book, perhaps we shall be able to note a welcome increase in general literacy in these matters hitherto largely neglected by the educated public. The second part is a survey of social mechanisms, which by definition involve directly or indirectly some element of communication. Al though this part covers a very wide range of phenomena, the scientific treatment of communication is par amount throughout the discussion. Much of the most impressive work on chemical communication is of course due to Wilson himself. To anyone who taught animal ecology a quarter of a century ago, the most striking features of the growth of the subject since that time have been the development of enough ge netic theory to show in detail the mechanisms of what can happen in the evolution of societies and in deed any sorts of ecological com munities, and the enormous in crease in knowledge about the methods by which animal societies are integrated. A third important area of development has been the introduction of an energetic point of view, ultimately largely derived from R. L. Lindeman's (7) famous paper on the trophic-dynamic as pects of ecology. Wilson in his ergo nomie theory of the caste structure of insect societies has made a fun damental contribution to this area which is admirably explained in the book. The third part of Sociobiology is a systematic presentation, of what we know about the social biology of al most all the various groups of ani mals in which social organization has developed. Here a very peculiar phenomenon is apparent, Wilson considers, and the view can hardly be contested, that there are four pinnacles of social evolution. These are exhibited by the colonial coelen terates, such as Siphonophora, by the social insects, by certain verte brates mainly mammals, and by man himself, in whom social struc ture relative to other vertebrates is carried "to a level of complexity so high as to constitute a distinct fourth pinnacle of social evolution." Most though not all the discussion relates to these four pinnacles. Ordinarily we think of ourselves as superior and would expect to find that the three other types of some what less complex integration would lead up to our own complexi ty. Actually this is not the case. An elaborate siphonophore functions as a social structure more smoothly than an insect society, which in its turn tends to have far less strife and casual maladjustment than a highly developed nonhuman mammalian society. The siphonophores were in fact used as object lessons by soci alist zoologists in the mid nine teenth century. "As in a communist state, there are here no poor by the side of the rich, no hunger beside surfeit, but also no lazy next to the industrious. Each one contributes his part to the existence and welfare of the whole, each according to his powers" (Rudolf Leuckart, tr. Mary P. Winsor, 8). Unfortunately we have learned dur ing the past half-century that to produce even the smooth efficiency of an insect society in a human community requires the gagging, imprisonment, or murder of a sig nificant part of the population. To regard the insect or siphonophoran societies as ideal from our point of view is to commit what Thiene mann (9), one of the founders of modern ecology, boldly writing in Germany in 1939, called the Termi tenwahr or termite error. If we are to go any further, it must be by a different path. The fourth pinnacle of sociobiology, so full of fascinating detail and yet at present so incomplete, is bound to stimulate speculation. Wilson has been almost impeccably cau tious, but one cannot always hold the mind in leash on this field. Three matters particularly need comment. The first is that the de velopment of considerable skill in learning preadapts a population, at whatever stage of evolution, to the influence of innovators. Imo the Sweet Potato Washer showed how this can happen in Macaca fuscata, the Japanese macaque. Later she invented a method of separating wheat seed from sand by flotation. It is amusing to find that in Wil son's index she is rewarded by being given a place among the chim panzees. The activities of chim panzees as artists and of seals as musicians provide comparable ex amples of preadaptation of captive animals to innovation from outside. All of these cases pale into insignifi cance beside Washoe, Sarah, and the other chimpanzees and at least one gorilla who have learned the rudiments of syntactical languages employing manual, gestural, or me chanical rather than vocal modes of communic?tion. The whole history of the rise of human culture must depend on preadaptation to such innovations. Wilson is worried by the ease with which man is indoctri nated; although the process certain ly can be dangerous, initially it may well have been essential. Cyril Stanley Smith (10) has point ed out that the first uses of practi cally all metals were decorative and not utilitarian. Anything requiring a great deal of experimentation and acquisition of new skills is most un likely to be invented in the urgent stress of a situation of life-and death importance. This can only happen, as it did with tank warfare in 1914-18 and with the Manhattan Project in World War II, in enor mous societies where the ratio of the perimeter that must be defend ed to the inhabited area is quite low. In primitive times, invention even of things that could be later fashioned into weapons must have been a leisurely occupation taking place only when society was enjoy ing a period of stability. Wilson favors a society rather like the one proposed by Tiger and Fox (11) as that in which human evolu tion occurred: the general moral cli mate was that of a baboon troop, with marked male dominance sex 1976 January-February 23</page><page sequence="3">ually and socially. Our nearest allies who stayed in the forests were less baboonlike?the gorilla apparently as near anerotic as is consistent with survival, the chimpanzee pro miscuous in spite of marked male dominance. Most authors who adopt this model for man see in it the origin of a good deal of our characteristic behavior, good or bad. Obviously, however, it is at most only half the story. Any selection in favor of genetically determined intelligence presumably affects both sexes unless the genes involved are on the Y-chromosome or are inactive in a female soma. These conditions are not likely to be very generally met. While the men were sharpening their wits?if they indeed were?while hunting, what were the women?whose wits in any generation have been shar pened almost to the same extent as the men's?doing? Presumably gathering, looking after the chil dren, and talking. There is likely to have been a functional sexual dif ference here, as conversation is much less likely to scare roots, edi ble seeds, and fruits than an ante lope. This would surely be the place to look for the origin of all compli cated linguistic practices, if only we had some way of looking. It is known that in some modern so cieties quite deep differences be tween men's and women's cultures exist, but in every case, the children must pass through the women's cul ture and get their language from it, even though the boys are excluded from it as they mature. What hap pens when learning the language happens for life. Women gossiping may have provided linguistic rich ness that both sexes then could use. Valor may be regarded as a basic male virtue: on it the persistence of the culture may depend. It can, however, degenerate into what we only recognize in other people and therefore call machismo, which seems untranslatable by a single word. In contrast to this, women are supposed to possess glamor, a very interesting word, as it is a Scots var iant of, grammar, from yp?(j&gt;eiv, to write; it implies the casting of writ ten spells. Likewise the enchanting woman also casts spells which must involve words, but she sings rather than writes them. No one knows for sure whether women have not 24 American Scientist, Volume 64 painted the very best pictures or composed the very best music be cause they have not been allowed to do so, as Women's Lib would insist, or because they are unable to do so, as male chauvinism would suggest. It is, however, certain that whether allowed to or not, they have, from Sappho to Jane Austen or beyond, produced occasionally some of the best literature. The word is perhaps continually made flesh of a woman. This feminine verbal preoccupation may be very important in human evolution. White magic may degenerate into black. The bullying male has as his female counterpart the malign witch, the black strega rather than the white maga. There may just possibly be a very odd corollary to this. One of the most peculiar facts about the evolution of our species is the development of menstruation as a striking periodic event, much more significant, as Wilson notes, than in the great apes or such other primates as show the phenomenon. It is well known that in many primi tive societies there is a fear of men struating women, and the most elaborate precautions are taken to keep the resulting ritual, as opposed to merely sanitary, uncleanness from damaging society (12). It is not quite inconceivable that at times such magical uncleanness could give women a threatening power, and if this power was used in some way to protect their children against male savagery, any genes encouraging conspicuous menstrual bleeding would tend to be fixed. All arguments about language in ev olution seem to run into insupera ble difficulties, as we have no fossil words above a few millennia old. Recently, however, a very inter esting anatomical argument has been developing. In a series of pa pers (13), Lieberman as a linguist and Crelin as an anatomist have pointed out that the structures of the chimpanzee and of the newborn human infant prohibit the full use of the mouth and pharyngeal tract as a sound generator. This seems eminently reasonable. The same argument is, according to them, ap plicable to Neanderthal man. Since at least some Neanderthal popula tions practiced ritual burial of the dead in fairly elaborate ways (14), clearly they must have had religious beliefs and presumably some mythology. It is inconceivable that these characteristics could have de veloped without a communication system of the same general sort of efficiency as the one that we use. The anatomy looks convincing, but its message seems incredible. This is just the sort of situation that leads to advances in science. The further detailed study of all possi ble skeletal material bearing on the matter is obviously a task of the greatest importance. The very old so-called Homo habilis skulls cry out, if they do not argue, for such investigation. In spite of these anatomical results, it seems to me extremely probable that the intellectual powers of man grew with his increasing use of lan guage. Though I suspect that the limits of Washoe's language are not the limits of her world?and I know this is true of myself when I imagine fairly elaborate colored imagery?it seems probable that Wittgenstein's dictum (15) became more and more true, though still happily partly false, as we developed an elaborate communication system. It still (16) seems to me likely that the selective force responsible for intellectual growth operated mainly on varia^ tion in exploratory and imitative behavior in childhood, so that the quick and complete learners of the communication system were fa vored. Intellectual processes after childhood may thus be to a large ex tent uninfluenced by natural selec tion, and so can lead to all sorts of autotelic activity. Variation in adult intelligence, the development of which is evidently very easily inhib ited environmentally, would on this view be variation in the intactness of the surviving infantile mecha nism. Thorpe and the mind body problem If Wilson's book shows us a proces sion of social life passing by a re viewing stand, Thorpe's gives a pic ture of the same procession, end on from the street looking over the heads of all the other animals to the culminating human figure in the distance (17). Moreover, not only is the literal but also the figurative point of view quite different, Wil son writes as if he accepts implicitly what Thorpe calls the double-as</page><page sequence="4">pect solution of the problem of the relation of mind to body. His initial quotation from the Bhagavad-Gita seems to imply a sort of illusionary dualism, but the text is monistic throughout. When Thorpe looks at man in terms of his animal ancestors, he is partic ularly prone to wonder about the origins of beauty in living nature and of the aesthetic reaction to such beauty. Ethics crop up every now and then in Wilson, aesthetics much more frequently in Thorpe. Seeing much of nature, at least for the purposes of his book, as prefi guring man, Thorpe can easily look back from man into nature, trying to find there what we know in our selves. This anthropomorphic pro cedure horrifies respectable biolo gists, though it has appealed, when kept carefully under control, to a minority of ethologists,, notably Sir Julian Huxley in his early writings (18). Its validity can be judged by one very important example given by Thorpe. In the European blackbird Turdus merula, the song of the male, which develops during the early spring, fi nally can involve different combina tions of as many as 26 phrases. There is evidence of musical organi zation which resembles the work of human composers. This may merely mean that the latter have copied birds, who presumably have been singing much longer than our species. More remarkably, there ap pears to be some evidence that, in the purely utilitarian context of the defense of a territory, the black bird's song is less rich than at times when no other male individual is a potential threat. This strongly suggests that some of the richness is autotelic?included for its own sake and not in a nonmusical functional context. This matter clearly needs a great deal of further study (19). It provides a case where experience of our own emotions can suggest what to look for in the behavior of the blackbird, which is cerebrally much simpler than ourselves. Thorpe, unlike Wilson, is unabash edly pluralistic, though the nature of the pluralism is very tentative. As has been indicated, this for the most part has no effect on the science in either book. Thorpe's is intellectually the more dangerous path, but it does suggest ideas that might easily be suppressed in a monistic scheme. It is, therefore, desirable to look into the matter a little further. In chapter 9, Thorpe begins the most philosophical part of his book by an elementary exposition of the mind-body problem, though he has considered some of its aspects ear lier in his discussion. He concedes four possibilities. The first is dual ism in any of its forms, including here pluralism. In this possibility it is admitted that both the class of events that we call mind and the class that we call matter, though in teracting, can be independent and are both capable of autonomous ex istence. Thorpe distinguishes a strong form of dualism in which mind and matter can influence each other and a weak form in which the influence can only go one way. It is clear, however, that if mind means anything, it can be influenced by and can influence matter, or I could not be writing this or expecting anyone to understand what I am writing. Only the strong form need be considered. The second possibility acknowl edges only mental events as real, as in Bishop Berkeley's philosophy. This view has the advantage of lim iting our discourse to what we expe rience directly, but it is most unat tractive to anyone who wants to op erate in any sort of external world. The position may well be unfalsifia ble, but most people would dismiss it as silly; solipsism is a strong form of this alternative and is still sillier. The third possibility acknowledges material events as real but mental events as "at best a convenient ab straction." What an abstraction is in a system in which only material events are real is not clear to me. Since this possibility excludes all directly known experience as unreal it is not very attractive. It has often been the practice of materialists to regard events in consciousness as epiphenomenal. Why sitting on top of a phenomenon gets such events out of the way is not clear. The fourth alternative is the identi ty or double-aspect theory, mental and physical events being two as pects of the same reality. This type of theory has a long and very re spectable ancestry and is presum ably the implicit metaphysics of most biologists. Like the other possibilities, it raises formidable difficulties. The matter can be illu minated by a simple if somewhat science-fictional thought experi ment. Thorpe employs the same sort of experiment in discussing the Popper-McKay (20) treatment of determinism and free will. We suppose that a series of techni cal advances has realized the dream of the physiological psychologist, so that it is possible to record, to any degree of detail, what is happening in the central nervous system of a human being perceiving, feeling emotion, forming images, acting, and reporting his experience in a particular context, without having any injurious effect on the subject. The records from such a set of ob servations would be enormous but would consist of indications of. po tential changes, migrations of ions, variations in the rates of enzymatic synthesis and decomposition of a vast variety of compounds, and the like. From part of the record it would be possible to pick out a subrecord, which by the timing of the events recorded could be corre lated with the subject's reported states of mind. This part of the record would bear the same sort of relation to the sub jective experience of the subject, as he reports it, as a musical score does to the sounds produced by an or chestra. It would be possible from a series of such records to make a sort of dictionary indicating that classes of events in the record correspond with specific classes of subjective events as reported. We know that even the most unmusical individual, given a score and unlimited pa tience over numerous performances, can pick out the equivalence of black marks on a set of horizontal lines, beginning with the sign Tymp., with the sound and sight of someone beating a drum. Everyday experience shows that the same sort of equivalence occurs be tween subjective red and light of 700 nm projected on a white screen. We have here in fact learned to call subjective red by the word red with out having any guarantee that other people see red as we do. If, however, we ask ourselves what is the connec 1976 January-February 25</page><page sequence="5">tion between the quality of the ex perience (not the word) and the physical changes so elaborately traced in the record, we get no an swer. Some philosophers may tell us that the question is meaningless; most biologists imply that it is irrel evant. It is, however, quite reason able to suppose that the question is valid but unanswerable. Thorpe clearly rejects the double aspect theory and inclines to Pop per's belief in three "worlds" (1) of physical objects and states, (2) of states of consciousness, and (3) of objective knowledge. This type of pluralism could itself be unified by a triple-aspect theory. The autono my of mind, however, becomes a real possibility if we accept the evi dence of parapsychology, with all its bewildering difficulties?as indeed Thorpe does. The development of parapsychology in the past thirty years has been as full of triumphs and frustrations as in the preceding thirty, and there still seems to be no fully acceptable body of knowledge. For the moment, experimental evi dence of some kind of dualism cer tainly seems to exist, but it is un comfortable to find that curious im plications of fraud can be found in some of the seemingly most respect able experiments (21). At times it appears as if the whole subject is in evitably vitiated by a curious kind of uncertainty principle. Whether we accept a monistic double-aspect theory or some sort of dualism, the difficulty of the nature of the trans lation from the subjective experi ence to the physical explanatory de scription remains. It is not unreasonable to suspect that unanswerable questions may from time to time arise in science. There are two very well known problems in mathematics that look extremely elementary but have de fied all attempts at solution: the four-color problem to obtain a proof that four colors are sufficient and necessary to distinguish the countries on any map on a sphere, and Goldbach's conjecture that every even number is the sum of two primes. The four-color problem is particularly interesting because its solution, which if achieved would obviously be very deep, would pro vide the theory of what is empirical ly a piece of kindergarten physics (22). 26 American Scientist, Volume 64 It is also well known to readers of this journal that Godei showed that any axiomatic system rich enough to provide a basis for the arithmetic part of mathematics generates un decidable questions. Thorpe quotes Popper as suggesting that, since all attempts at reduction of the ob served world to a monistic physics involve arithmetical procedures, such scientific explanation is by na ture incomplete. Neither our inabil ity after two and a half millennia to provide a satisfying account of the relationship of experienced mental events to the physical world, nor the analogies with some refractory mathematical problems, nor the knowledge that reductionist science may by nature be incomplete, prove that the mind-body problem is by nature insoluble within the system as we know it?but at least they suggest that there is nothing unrea sonable in such an idea. Thorpe in essence clearly accepts this point of view, and the latter part of his book can be regarded as a tentative attempt to get outside the system that generates the unde cidability. To him "religion means the belief that interpenetrating the natural environment perceived by our senses, there extends beyond it a larger environment without which the visible environment cannot be fully comprehended." This is a strictly intellectual proposition. .But he adds "and to which men must re late themselves," which is an ethical statement?almost the only one in the book. These statements are but tressed by enumeration of the views of a number of other biologists and philosophers of eminence. Personal ly I find the unornamented state ment adequate?nothing in what is added really takes one any further. Wittgenstein (23) put the problem in his celebrated aphorism, "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Thorpe very seriously raises the question, in what is ultimately a legitimate sci entific context, as to whether we are not shown intuitively a wider sys tem in which Wittgenstein's prohi bition is not binding.

Neither paper claims quite as much as Thorpe does in his text, but Thorpe does mention a number of other observers who have come to a similar conclusion. 20. Thorpe has a discussion of this very im portant but technically rather difficult work which is much less well known than it should be. His account (pp. 330-35) is a convenient introduction to the subject. 21. Thorpe, as I also had done {Am. Sci. 36: 291 [1948]) much earlier, accepts the Soal-Goldney experiments, which ap peared to give strong evidence of precog nitive telepathy. There seems however now to be enough doubt about them to exclude their being used as significant evidence; see C. Scott and P.

There are however experiments reported in S. G. Soal and F. Bateman, 1954, Modern Ex periments in Telepathy (New Haven: Yale Univ.
