<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an: The Interpretive Strategies Used by al-QadT al-Nucman (d. 363/974) in His DacaJim al-Islam Husain K.B. Qutbuddin Academy of Advanced Studies in South-Asian Islam and Arabic This paper will present a survey of the interpretive strategies used in explaining Qur'anic ayas by al-Qadl al-Nucman b. Muhammad, a Fatimid2 ddci ('missionary') and qadi ('judge') of the highest status, in his juristic magnum opus, the two-volume Dacd?im al-Islam,3 and ascertain the role played by these strategies in the Fatimid system of belief. Unlike the case in Sunni jurisprudence, where interpretive strategies evolved into a formalised system of usul al-fiqh ('principles of jurisprudence') to act as the chief legitimisers of interpretation, the Fatimid tradition, I will observe, experienced no such development, and the DacaJim, as the survey will show, uses no usul terminology. The reasons for this will be explored primarily by examining al-Nucman's Ikhtilafusul al-madhahib,4 in which he argued that interpretive strategies could not, on their own, legitimise interpretation because they only put forward possibilities, and thus could not determine meaning unequivocally. It was the living Imam, believed to be the designated heir of the Prophet physically and knowledge wise, and therefore the definitive source of interpretation, who was, according to him, the absolute legitimiser. An analysis of the function of the DacaJim's interpretive strategies will follow by studying the Fatimid epistemological and educational system, in which students were first to be taught the rituals and rules of the Sharica, and then, in higher grades, the comprehensive rationales behind these 'physical' requirements. The article is divided into five sections. The first will emphasise the centrality of al-Nucman and his texts in the Fatimid legal tradition, in order to explain my choice of the DacdHm as a vehicle for studying Fatimid legal interpretation of the Qur'an. The second will illustrate the interpretive strategies used therein for Qur'anic exegesis. Journal of Qur'anic Studies 12 (2010): 109-146 Edinburgh University Press DOI: 10.3366/E1465359110000987 ?

The fourth will ascertain the purpose of interpretive strategies in the Dacd?im in light of the Fatimid epistemological and educational system. Finally, the fifth will present my conclusions. The Importance of al-Qadl al-Nucman and his DacdHm There have been several studies on various aspects of Fatimid law and fiqh texts,5 but none that have examined usage of the Qur'an, including the ways in which it is quoted, the frequency and placement of quotations, the interpretations offered, the authorities cited in exegesis, and - the focus of this paper - the interpretive strategies used.6 The Dacd?im is an appropriate text for such an exercise because of al-Nu?man's overall prominence and influence on contemporary and subsequent Fatimid thought, and especially because the DacdJim became, from its inception, the central text of Fatimid law. Observations regarding the DacdJim therefore bear significance for the Fatimid view in general. Al-Nucman entered the service of al-Mahdi (d. 322/934), the first Fatimid caliph-Imam, in 313/925. He attained favour with the caliph-Imams, especially the third and fourth, al-Mansur (d. 341/953) and al-Mucizz (d. 365/975).7 He was appointed keeper of the palace library and entrusted with the collection, preservation and copying of books. At the time of al-Mansur, he served as qadi of Tripoli and then as supreme qadi of the capital, al-Mansuriyya, in charge of appointing qadis in al-Mansuriyya, al-Mahdiyya and Qayrawan. In al-Mucizz's time, his jurisdiction spanned the whole of the Fatimid Empire.8 Al-Nucman was a prolific author in several subjects, chief amongst them jurisprudence, exhortation, history, taDwll ('esoteric interpretations') and philosophy. According to the cUyun al-akhbdr, al-Mucizz continuously endorsed and attested to al-Nucman's scholarly excellence and also charged him with conducting the majdlis al-hikma ('sessions of wisdom' - the regular meetings in which du cdt imparted Fatimid teachings to their followers) in the Fatimid palace.9 The contemporary historian, Ibn Zulaq (d. 386/996) says, in his Akhbdr quddt Misr, that al-Nucman:10 ... was a man of the highest abilities, deeply versed in the Qur'an, fully acquainted with the meaning of the expressions contained in that book, skilled in the systems of jurisprudence, well-informed in the conflicting opinions entertained by the legists, learned in Arabic philology, in poetry of the higher class, in the history of the battle-days of the people (the Ancient Arabs), and distinguished for intelligence</page><page sequence="3">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 111 and equity. He composed for the ahl al-bayt (the Fatimids) some volumes containing thousands of leaves; they were drawn up with the best of composition and in a style remarkable for the beauty of its cadences and rhymes. The cUyun al-akhbdr lists 44 works by al-Nucman in total, eighteen of which are fully preserved today, four are partially preserved and 22 are believed to be lost.11 Several of these are mentioned by later Fatimid and TayyibI ducat as constituting important rungs in their system of learning.12 Amongst his fiqh works are al-Iddh,13 al-Ikhbdr fi'l-fiqh, al-Iqtisdr, Mukhtasar al-athar, al-Muntakhaba and, of course, the Da'd'im.14 Daca?im al-Isldm was composed circa 347/95715 and comprises, as Bayard Dodge confirms, 'like other great codes of Jurisprudence ... a complete manual for religious and secular behaviour'.16 Dacd?im I consists of seven sections ('kutub'), each explicating one of the seven pillars of Fatimid Islam: waldya ('faith, devotion and obedience'), tahdra ('ritual purity'), salat ('prayer', under which kitdb al-jandJiz ('the section on funerals') is subsumed), zakdt ('alms'), sawm ('fasting'), hajj ('pilgrimage'), and jihad ('fighting in the path of God'). Each kitdb in turn is divided into many 'chapters' (sing, dhikr), each of which covers a certain aspect of the subject of the kitdb. Dacd3im I covers the cibdddt, the duties of a Muslim towards God, whereas Daca?im II covers the mucamalat, the mles and guidelines governing the behaviour of a Muslim towards others. Daca3im II includes kutub such as buyuc ('commerce'), nikdh ('marriage'), talaq ('divorce'), wasdya ('bequests'), fara?id ('inheritance'), hudud ('legal punishments'), shahdddt ('testimonies') and dddb al qudd ('essential guidelines for judges').17 Under each of the 'chapters' in the DacaJim, al-Nucman lists the relevant ay as as well as the series of traditions pertinent to the topic at hand. These consist of ahadith ascribed to the Prophet, and sayings attributed to cAli b. Abi Talib (d. 40/661) and the ShTcI Imams, usually up to and including Jacfar al-Sadiq (d. 148/765). Frequently, the traditions also encompass quotations of ayas. Al-Nucman comments that his motivation for writing the DacaJim is to present a mukhtasar, an abridgement of other lengthier texts by him, most notably al-Iddh. The Dacd?im, he maintains, includes exclusively the authentic traditions, and is purposefully presented, for ease of reading, without lengthy asdnid except for the names of the Prophet and the Imams.18 According to the cUyun al-akhbdr, al-Mu?izz commissioned the writing of the DacaJim and subsequently went over the whole of it, made revisions and additions where necessary, and stamped it with his authority. Out of the mass of available traditions, al-Mucizz affirmed the authentic ones for al-Nucman, and omitted the false.19 Coming forth from the personal initiative of the caliph-Imam, the Dacd3im came to occupy a cardinal position in Fatimid law and pedagogy almost immediately</page><page sequence="4">112 Journal of Qur'anic Studies after its composition. It was used as the reference text for qadis, being widely propagated throughout the empire,20 and became a fundamental text to be taught to Fatimid initiates.21 Al-Nu?man also held public teaching sessions of the Dacd3im in the mosque after every Friday prayer, first in Qayrawan and then in al-Mansuriyya.22 Furthermore, al-Mucizz is reported by al-Nucman to have encouraged the reading, copying and studying of the DacdDim?3 The Dacd3im continued to be taught and applied after al-Nucman's death. His sons and grandsons, the chief qadis of the Fatimids, continued to publicly lecture from it, as well as from other texts by him.24 A letter from the caliph-Imam al-Hakim (d. 411/ 1021) in 391/1001, preserved in the cUyun al-akhbdr, enjoins the addressed ddci to strictly follow the DacdJim in his dispensation of law.25 In 416/1025, the caliph-Imam al-Zahir (d. 427/1036) is reported to have promised a monetary reward for whosoever memorised the Dacd0im?6 References to the Dacd?im in texts by eminent du?dt such as Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani27 and al-Mu3ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi28 also indicate that it remained an integral part of Fatimid programs of education. The Dacd3im has acted as a basic template for most of the subsequent fiqh texts in post-Fatimid works, especially in the Tayyibi corpus. The most notable of these is al Hawdshi ('The Marginal Notes'), which is generally attributed to the prolific Tayyibi jurist Aminji b. Jalal (d. 1010/1602).29 Tayyibi ducat have continued to stress the centrality of the DacdJim, and have deemed it a basic text to be learnt by all initiates in the community.30 DacdJim al-Islam can therefore be viewed as a representative text in the genre of Fatimid and post-Fatimid fiqh. It is an apt vehicle through which to study the strategies employed in Fatimid legal interpretation of the Qur'an, and the observations regarding it, in large part, may apply to other participating texts. A Survey of Interpretive Strategies Used in Daca?im al-Islam Dacd3im al-Isldm contains about 1,200 quotations of Qur'anic ayas.31 Many ayas are quoted multiple times. The number of distinct ayas - each aya counted only once - is about 630. The number of ayas that are quoted to put forward legal precepts is about 470,32 close to the total of 500 legal verses (ayat al-ahkdm) in the Qur'an as estimated by several medieval, as well as modern, scholars.33 A survey of the strategies that al Nucman employs in interpreting the legal verses now follows, with two aims. First, it will provide a categorisation of these strategies, a task that has not been undertaken in scholarship prior to this study. The categorisation will be useful in the latter half of the essay for comparing al-Nucman's strategies with those found in the genre of Sunni usul al-fiqh. Second, the survey and the excerpts from the Dacd3im that are presented therein will serve to provide the reader with a feel for the text, especially the manner in which it conveys exegesis. This will be essential in discerning the role of interpretive strategies in the Fatimid epistemological system.34</page><page sequence="5">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 113 For about half the number of quotations, al-Nucman lists the aya but does not provide any explicit assignment of meaning. This usually happens when the meaning seems to be uncontroversial and to follow straightforwardly from the context. Consider the following example: Translation [In the introduction to the 'Chapter on the Favourable Reasons for Giving Obligatory and Voluntary Alms'] God says: ... and those who give the obligatory alms. Referring to: Q. 23:4 Excerpt 5j?jll jjjllj ... :Ja.j j&amp; M JIS ['AiJx-alij Remarks: None of the words in the quotation are explicitly expounded; the context of the quotation - falling under the 'Chapter on the Favourable Reasons for Giving Obligatory and Voluntary Alms', which is in Kitdb al-zakdt in the Daca?im - seems to be enough to indicate the relevant meanings without needing explicit explanation. Table 1: Quotation without explicit assignment of meaning35 In most cases where there is some explicit assignment, al-Nucman simply states that Word x means y, without providing more justification. An explanation is usually put forward only for interpretations that are uncommon, difficult, or seem to be contentious vis-a-vis competing interpretations by other non-Fatimid schools of law. For example: Translation [In the 'Chapter on the Enjoinment of Prayer'] God says: verily, the prayer is upon the believers a duty that is mawqutan. It was related to us, on the authority of Jacfar b. Muhammad, regarding God's word mawqutan. he said [that it means] 'made obligatory'. Referring to: Q. 4.103 Excerpt yl &gt; M JIS ['SjL^ll U^J J] J Jta 4i! (o?) ^? jj ja*^. jc Lbjjj Remarks: Observe that mawqutan is said to mean 'made obligatory' without any further explanation. This is probably because the assignment is not expected to be contentious or contested by other non-Fatimid schools. Table 2: Assignment of meaning without justification</page><page sequence="6">114 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Where justification is provided, al-Nucman tends to use one or a combination of the following strategies:37 first, he often performs semantic and - to a lesser degree - syntactic analyses to justify his interpretations.38 Consider these examples: Translation [Analyses the meaning of afa3 in the ayas that refer to the spoils of war] that which God returned (aja3) to His Prophet from the people of the towns: and that which God returned (afa3) to His Prophet from them. So al-fay3 is the return of a thing to its [original] place and people, and from this it is said fa3 al-fay3 when the shadow [of an object] returns ...39 Referring to: Q. 59:6-7 Excerpt ^211 CjUVI ^ Jail J^la Jbu] ... Jtll li! ^1 Remarks: Al-Nucman puts forward the lexical meaning of al-fay3 and an example of its common usage. Table 3: Semantic analysis40 Translation [When relating the rule of wiping the feet in ablution, he brings in part of Q. 5:6] ... and wipe your heads (ru3usikum) and feet (arjulikum) to the ankles, according to the reading of those who read arjulikum. with a kasra [under the lam]. So He made that [i.e. the rule of wiping the feet] to [symmetrically] follow [that of] wiping the head ... Referring to: Q. 5:6 Excerpt ^jolo liuu lilli J*^ cLiaaa* &gt;f^?l^.jlj" ... (J-ljll Remarks: Al-Nucman argues for the requirement of wiping (rather than washing) the feet in ablution-a feature common to both the Twelver and the Fatimid traditions - by indicating that arjulikum follows ru3usikum syntactically as required by sentence structure; therefore, as the head is to be wiped, so too are the feet. Table 4: Syntactic analysis'</page><page sequence="7">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an Second, word order sometimes plays an important role: 115 Translation Excerpt [He says that shaving the head is better than trimming it in Hajj and cumra, bringing in this aya] ... you will enter the Sacred Mosque ... with shaved heads and trimmed. So He mentioned shaving first and it is better. Referring to: Q. 48:27 Remarks: Notice that the justification provided for shaving being better than trimming is that the former is mentioned before the latter in the aya. Table 5: The significance of word order .42 Third, variant readings in a few instances direct a particular interpretation: Translation On the authority of Jacfar b. Muhammad, regarding the Word of God: if a man or a woman is inherited by neither parents nor offspring and he has a brother or sister (akhun aw ukhtun) - from [only] a common mother (min ummin) - then each of them gets a sixth ...,43 he said: this is how [God] revealed it: a brother or sister from [only] a common mother [bold added to indicate the variant] Referring to: Q. 4:12 Excerpt sija\ jl djjjj (J^j ub :(? ?) Remarks: Al-Nucman advocates reading mm ummin after afc/iim aw ukhtun in order to limit the rule of the aya, viz. a specific share in the inheritance of a person who has neither parents nor offspring, to exclusively uterine siblings. This reading is generally reported as shadhdha ('isolated') in Sunn! sources, and not included in any of the canonical readings. Table 6: Variant readings'</page><page sequence="8">116 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Fourth, one or more ayas are frequently brought in to support the interpretation of the verses in focus: Translation [On the authority of CAH, regarding the exegesis of Q. 5:4: it is permissible to eat that which is caught byl those you have taught from the jawdrih ... He said: they [i.e. al-jawarih] are the dogs, and al-jarih [means] an acquirer; and from this follows the word of God and He knows that which you have jarahtum during the day. meaning 'acquired'.

The connection is that al-jarih (sing.) means 'an acquirer', and dogs are acquirers in the scenario of catching prey. To support the interpretation of al-jarih, he cites the other aya. Table 7: Supporting an interpretation by using another aya45 Al-Nucman often lists ayas and phrases that are adjacent or non-adjacent in the Qur'an together to convey, sometimes explicitly, inter-relationships such as causality, continuity, co-occurrence of revelation, deductive premises, explanation and elaboration, parallelism, qualification, similarity of subject, and revision 46 I present examples for some of these inter-relationships: Translation Excerpt [In the 'Chapter on Encouragements to Pray'] have.patience and pray, for God is wjthJho se_who_ have j^atience^ Referring to: Q. 2:153 Remarks: This modified quotation of wa'stacinu bVl-sabri wayl-salati inna'llaha macail-sdbirin adds the particle fa- ('because') before inna, thereby making explicit the causal relationship that exists between the two parts of this aya: the first part enjoining patience and prayer is to be performed because God is with those who have patience.

Table 12: Revision51 Fifth, reasoning that can appeal to common sense is extensively employed to put forward particular interpretations: Translation [On the authority of al-Sadiq regarding the explanation of 'capability of finding a way to the Kacba' in Q. 3:97] and for God [as a duty] upon the people is pilgrimage to the House, for whosoever is capable of finding a way to it .... the people say regarding this ....

Table 13: Reasoning that can appeal to common sense"</page><page sequence="12">120 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Al-Nucman also frequently applies reasoning to derive particular implications from ayas: Translation God says: test the orphans till they attain the age of marriage: then, if you perceive in them maturity, handover to them their possessions. the aya .... So that shows that one in whom maturity is not perceived should be kept away from his possessions, even though he may have reached the age of marriage, because God did not permit that [i.e. the handing over of possessions] except with [the fulfillment of] two conditions: with attaining the age of marriage, and maturity.

Table 14: Reasoning used to derive particular implications53 Al-Nucman also uses reasoning when arguing against non-Fatimid interpretations. Such argumentation only occurs in the DacdJim, an abridged text,54 for the relatively few aspects that are strikingly different from Sunn! law,55 such as the acceptance of the Imams as a source of law,56 and the inheritance of the daughter, determined by the interpretation of the respective ayas in Q. 4.57 Al-Nucman wrote works dedicated to polemics, some of which are non-extant, such as those in refutation of Abu Hanifa (d. 150/767), Malik, al-Shafici and Ibn Surayj (d. 306/918), and one presenting 'legitimate' Qur'anic interpretations which were allegedly unacceptable to Sunnls,58 and some of which are preserved, such as Ikhtildf usul al-madhahib, which argues against Sunn! usul al-fiqh,59 and al-Urjuza al-mukhtdra, which contends with the Sunnls, the Muctazila, the Kharijls, the Zaydls, and other Shfi groups.60 I illustrate here an argument that al-Nucman puts forward against washing the feet in ablution. This builds upon his syntactic justification presented</page><page sequence="13">in table 4: Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 121 Translation Excerpt Abu Jacfar Muhammad b. cAli [al Baqir] said, when he was asked about wiping the feet: the Qur'an has spoken about it.

He reasons here based on an assumption of symmetry between ablution with water and tayammum: the face and hands are to be washed in ablution with water but are relegated to being wiped in tayammum. The head and feet, on the other hand, are altogether omitted from the tayammum, and since the head is to be wiped in ablution with water, symmetry entails that its 'partner' in being omitted is also to be wiped - not washed - in ablution with water. 61 Table 15: Reasoning used in argumentation against non-Fatimid interpretations' Sixth, al-Nucman, on several occasions, explicitly refers to the Qur'anic context to ascertain the meaning of the ay a in focus: Translation Excerpt [In explanation of this ay a]: permission [to fight I has been given to those who have been fought against because they have been wronged, and God is most able to [give them] help .... It was revealed regarding the muhajirun who were expelled from their homes in Mecca; [this must be so] because God's word subsequent to this [aya] is: those who were expelled from their homes without right except that they said 'Our Lord is God1. qa ^A jtp qa \ ja&gt;jaJ jjpll jjJ2kl^ll I^j IjI&amp; &lt;J vi 3* t*J&amp; i&gt; 4^1</page><page sequence="14">122 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Referring to: Q. 22:39^0 Remarks: Here, the determination of the time, place and referents of the aya in focus is undertaken by examining the aya that is subsequent to it in the Qur'an. A definite assumption of coherence - at least between the ayas cited - exists in such cases. Table 16: Explicitly referring to the Qur'anic context To ascertain the context of an aya, al-Nucman also many a time brings in asbdb al nuzul ('occasions of revelation'): Translation [He says that God has referred to the ritual prayer (saldt) as faith (imdn)]. And that is, when God turned the face of His Prophet from prayer towards Jerusalem and enjoined him to pray towards the Kacba, the Muslims asked the Prophet: 'What do you consider about these prayers that we were praying facing Jerusalem? What is their status [of validity] and our position regarding them?' So God sent down regarding this: God will not waste your faith ... so He referred to prayer as faith.

It is possible that the oral explanation given by al-Nucman in teaching his text would have resolved the mystery. It is not uncommon to find cryptic language in esoteric Fatimid texts, but one rarely comes across such usage in more basic texts such as the DacdDim. Table 18: More explanation and justification desirable64 In some of these difficult instances, examining other relevant texts by al-Nucman alleviates the confusion. Ta3wil al-DacdJim and Mukhtasar al-dthdr are particularly important in this regard 65 The Ambiguity of Interpretive Strategies One observes that the strategies put forward by al-Nucman are uncomplicated and informal explanations of meaning relying generally upon common interpretive principles such as linguistic analysis and deduction. In this, they are more or less similar to what one finds in early Sunni texts of positive law, that is texts which came to be known as containing the furuc ('branches') of law 66 Notably however, there is virtually no use in Daca?im al-Isldm or any other Fatimid fiqh work of formalised categories of interpretation comparable to those that were taking shape, or had become fairly concretised, in the by then vibrant Sunni tradition of usul al-fiqh, such as khdssl camm ('specific7'general' scope), muhkam/mutashdbih ('clear'/'ambiguous' verses), ndsikhlmansukh ('abrogating'/'abrogated' verses), qafllzanni ('assured'/ 'presumptive' interpretation), haml al-mutlaq cald'l-muqayyad ('extending the qualification of a word in one place to its unqualified occurrence in another'), ishdrat al-nass ('implicit meaning'), iqtidd3 al-nass ('common ellipses'), and mafhum al-muwdfaqalmafhum al-mukhdlafa ('extending/not extending a judgement to similar circumstances')67 Al-Nucman's explanations do put forward meanings which in many cases can be assigned ex post facto to some of these categories; for example, he interprets certain nouns as being general and others as being more particular in scope, and these can be classified under khdss and cdmm respectively;68 he says that certain ayas revised the edicts of previously revealed ayas,69 and these can be seen as a use of ndsikhlmansukh. The point that is made here, however, is that there is no explicit and sustained application of such formalisations by him, even though he was well aware of the usul tradition.70 Furthermore, there is no effort to develop such formalisations by him or any other Fatimid dd?i. As a result, there is no comparable usul genre in Fatimid works. I contend that this absence is precisely because the function in large part that such formalised categories and institutionalised strategies served in the Sunni arena - that</page><page sequence="16">124 Journal of Qur'anic Studies of being the chief defenders and legitimises of interpretations that were ascribed to the Qur'an and Sunna in the furuc texts71 - was not accepted by the Fatimid system. In his Ikhtildf usul al-madhdhib, a text written near the time of the Dacd3im,72 al Nucman advocates this position mainly by examining the overarching points of Sunn! usul, and asserting that they are inadequate for univocally determining interpretations. For concepts such as ijmdc ('consensus'),73 ijtihdd ('the exercise of deriving a rule'), istihsan ('juristic preference') and qiyds ('analogical reasoning'),74 al-Nucman painstakingly puts forward scriptural and rational rebuttals, disputes their proponents' substantiations, and argues that these terms are ambiguous in both their definitions as well as their outcomes. For example, in the case of ijmdc, he examines differences of opinion over issues such as the number of people who should be in agreement for it to be valid (all groups, or only the 'righteous' group, or all people of Medina, etc.), the source of the potential rule (based on the Qur'an and Sunna, or qiyds, or personal opinion, etc.), and the amount of time after which it is affirmed (only after the people involved die, or immediately after agreement is expressed, etc.). He debates against each position, and states that since there is ikhtildf ('divergence of opinion') over the very definition of ijmdc, there can never be ijmdc. The term, he concludes, is unable to univocally determine legal precepts, and is therefore unhelpful as a legitimiser of law. Paradoxically (at least at first glance), al-Nucman maintains that he would like Muslims to be a jamdca ('united group'), but adds that such ambiguous principles serve to divide, rather than unite.75 In the section that discusses the practice of inferring evidence from the Qur'an and Sunna, known as istidldl, al-Nucman argues that the exercise is flawed because it is indeterminate.76 The proof, he claims, is in the fact that any and every Islamic ideology - even ones that promote tandsukh ('transmigration of souls'), anthropomorphism, mufa marriage, or alcohol consumption - is able to draw support from some part of the Qur'an and some part of the Sunna for its usul as well as its furuc. As a result, he asserts, the same sacred sources are cited to declare one and the same thing as being haldl ('permissible') according to God's law by one group, and being hardm ('forbidden') by another group.77 The cmx of his arguments seems to be his daring statement: the Qur'an is incorrectly believed to be on its own a dalll and hddi ('guide'). He asserts that the Book of God is filled with hudd ('guidance'), daldla ('direction'), cilm and macrifa ('knowledge'), burhdn ('proof), baydn ('explication') and nadhdra ('warning'), but maintains that it cannot on its own convey this information. Usul strategies aimed at finding this guidance are inevitably ambiguous and indeterminate, and therefore personal opinions and dispositions unavoidably creep in to complete the interpretive act. The interpretations offered are thus inescapably zanni ('speculative') and plagued by frequently changed opinions, thereby leading to ikhtildf in what is considered haldl</page><page sequence="17">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 125 and hardm, and legal and illegal. This is unacceptable, he indicates, especially when an individual may be judged in the same lawsuit by one party's law as being legally entitled to a thing - for example, a person in matrimony, a payment in damages, or a death penalty - and as not so by another party's law. Such a state of affairs, he says, is much maligned in ay as such as Q. 5:49, and judge between them with what God has sent down, and do not follow their dispositions, and Q. 42:13, establish religion and do not be divided therein.78 So what or rather who is the dalil and hadf! Al-Nucman reasons that the Prophet in his time recited the Book of God and used it to guide, give knowledge, establish proofs, explicate and warn. He brought the risdla ('message'), and he was the rasul ('messenger'); he brought the hudd, and he was the had!. If the Qur'an could perform these actions on its own, he asserts, even the Prophet as a hddi and explicator would not have been required. To continue this mission, to definitively and unequivocally convey the information which God has deposited in the Qur'an for each period, the Qur'an needs, al-Nucman argues, an accompanying living interpreter, a person who is designated and taught by the Prophet. This person would know the interpretation of the Qur'an and Sunna, and would not need to take recourse to indeterminate formalised techniques to estimate their meaning. This interpreter is, al-Nucman concludes, none other than the Prophet's cousin and legatee (wast), CA1I, and after him, the successive line of designated Imams in their progeny, each of whom is the dalil and hddi for his time. They are the indispensable partners of the Qur'an, confirmed in his view by the hadith T leave amongst you two weighty things: the Book of God and my progeny, my ahl bayt. They will not part [from each other] until they come to me [together] at the hawd ('the basin of kawthaf) ...'79 Al-Nucman does not accept justifications of ikhtildfthat were put forward in the Sunni tradition. These include statements such as 'every mujtahid ('one who performs ijtihdd') is correct', as well as interpretations of ay as and ahddith. For example, he argues against the contention that the hadith 'if a judge passes judgement after performing ijtihdd and he is correct, then he attains two rewards; and if he passes judgement after performing ijtihdd and he is incorrect, then he has one reward'80 validates ijtihdd and allows for ikhtildf. 'Ijtihdd' in the hadith, says al-Nucman, refers not to the Sunni definition of deriving previously unknown rules, but to the effort that the judge should exert in finding the appropriate rule from the law that has been related by the living Imam from the Qur'an and Sunna.81 If a judge cannot find an appropriate rule, he states, or if two judges differ amongst themselves on a judgement, the case should go to the Imam.82 An incorrect judgement is worthy of censure, al Nucman asserts, and not of reward; the case in the hadith where the judge receives a reward even though the judgement is incorrect is when the mistake occurs not due to his incompetence or corruption, but because of factors outside of his control, such as the dishonesty of witnesses and the unavailability of crucial evidence.83</page><page sequence="18">126 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Al-Nucman's arguments clearly regarded interpretive strategies as insufficient to bestow legitimacy to interpretations, and sought to emphasise a pragmatic basis for the existence of a living interpreter and the rightfulness of the Fatimid caliph-Imam. There was no formaiisation of interpretive strategies into a system of usul equivalent to that which took place in the Sunn! arena, not by al-Nucman, nor by any other Fatimid dd% and one does not find any such usage in the DacdJim.S4 Observe that al Nucman's living interpreter - in theory at least - is not 'just another authority' that is cited in addition to other previous authorities. He is seen as the 'filter' who interprets previous authorities and the living source of instmction. He therefore pre-empts interpretive strategies aimed at discovering meaning. Abu Yacqub al-Sijistam (d. after 386/996), an influential ddcl and contemporary of al-Nucman, asserts that it is the function of the living Imam to interpret the Qur'an and previous authoritative traditions, and that this function cannot be performed by texts, because a text that contains interpretation itself needs to be interpreted.85 These comments, as well as the general stress in Fatimid works on oral instmction, strongly indicate that texts written in this tradition were generally considered not as repositories of knowledge but as aids to oral pedagogy, the source of which was seen as the living Imam.86 The Role of al-Nucman's Interpretive Strategies If the Imam is the absolute legitimiser of interpretation, what is the purpose of the interpretive strategies employed by al-Nucman in DacdJim al-Islaml Is al-Nucman going against his declared principles by using them? Or does the answer lie in the possibility that he was catering for a sceptical audience, perhaps a non-Fatimid one as well, and thus needed to argue his points with more than the Imam's stamp of authority? In light of the fact that the DacdJim was taught by al-Nucman to a general audience of Muslims in addition to the relative minority of Fatimid followers, it is possible that it was composed with such listeners in mind. However, similar interpretive strategies are used - often with greater frequency - in compilations such as Asds al-taJwil and TaJwil al-Dacd3im, which were taught exclusively to the followers.87 Moreover, interpretive strategies are a common feature in legal and other interpretations that occur in texts of Fatimid ducdt in general. I therefore believe that the answer lies more at the heart of Fatimid epistemology, which asserts that the Prophet's knowledge as related by his legatee, the previous Imams and the living Imam - which these texts professed to convey - is essentially expected to include rational argumentation. Here, I broadly and succinctly examine its defining points, which are common amongst all prominent ducdt, including al-Nucman.88 According to them, religion, including all of its laws and rituals, is fully based on caql ('intellect/rationality'), the defining characteristic of the human being. The Prophet is seen as the most rational and knowledgeable being, the most pure of soul, because of which he is able to receive wahy ('prophetic inspiration'), containing abstract tmths</page><page sequence="19">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 127 and comprehensive guidance needed by human beings to realise the rationality in creation. These truths and guidance include information about the organisation of the dacwat al-haqq ('the mission of truth'; the name the Fatimids used for their belief system), knowledge of past and future events, the true nature of reward and punishment, the realities of the hereafter and the 'upper' world, and the intricacies of tawhid. Most of this information needs to be related gradually to human beings, who are disparate in their intelligence and knowledge, and in a way that would help them comprehend. The Prophet thus conveys it in physical terms - in symbolic form - in the language of the Qur'an, and institutes the ritual and moral requirements of the Sharfa, which are of crucial benefit to human society, but are also - at the same time - physical representations and enactments of these truths. This knowledge is disseminated to the followers in a graded system by the Imam, and under his authority, by a hierarchy of helpers - known as the hudud (the ducdt were part of the hudud) - who have reached the higher grades.89 The Fatimids implemented such a system for their followers in and outside the empire. The students were first taught the zahir ('exoteric') sciences, such as the plain-sense meanings of the Qur'an and the law. DacaJim al-lsldm - a book of law - was taught at this initial stage. Then, ascending through the grades of knowledge, the adherents were given the ta3wili sciences, which included the symbolic meanings of the Qur'an and the legal commandments. In this manner, they would gradually come to realise, it was claimed, the inherent rationality in religion and creation (refer to fig. I).90 For example, at the initial stage, they would be taught how to perform the ritual prayers, including the specific actions and recitations that are part of it. In higher grades, it would be explained that these physical performances enact the intellectual program of the dacwat al-haqq that leads one to realise the logic in creation, and consequently attain salvation. This program consists of the highest teacher and source of knowledge, viz. the Imam, the teachers operating under him, viz. the hudud, the students, and the regulations and requirements governing their interaction in the process of imparting and acquiring knowledge and ascending in the grades. By performing prayer, one worships God physically, and by following the program, one is able to worship God intellectually.91 Extensively in his Asas al-taJwll and Ta?ml al-Daca3im, texts which were taught in higher grades after the Daca?im, al-Nucman conveys - on the authority of the living Imam - the symbolic intellectual meaning in ayas and in the rituals and rules of the Sharica that were put forth in the DacaJim. He explains why there are, for example, specifically five compulsory prayers, a precise and different number of rakacat in each prayer, seven circumambulations around the Kacba, and so forth. Without the existence of such symbolic meaning as rational precursors and determiners of such specific rituals, the Prophet, al-Nucman argues, could be accused of enjoining illogical and arbitrary duties 92 The various facets of Fatimid epistemology - including the</page><page sequence="20">128 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Rational Truths 2 symboHcally point to shan'a rituals &amp; rules (beneficial to society) &lt;profket (most rational A knowledgeable being) QJegatee chnam i ! !

On their own, they are indeterminate since they present several possible alternatives; the alternative that is taken as correct is seen as depending primarily upon the 'rational' principles that are considered the chief determinants of law. 'True' interpretations and laws would symbolically point towards rationally acceptable statements, whereas 'false' ones would not. The arguments for what is rationally acceptable continue in each grade, and as this happens, al-Nucman claims, doubts gradually decrease.94 The following quotation from Asds al-ttfwil explicates: Translation The ta3wil ... shines in the hearts and intellects, and by it the argument is established against one who denies the precepts of the Sharica .... It is that which testifies for the zdhir [i.e. the plain-sense interpretation of the Qur'an and the law]; it proves its validity to one who denies and doubts it because of his ignorance with regard to its Excerpt i^'A\ jA ...

Doubts are expected to remain, probably due to interpretations offered by competing strategies and ideologies, and to decrease gradually as the student progresses in the grades, and is taught the taJwil. Al-Nucman states that the student should ask the teacher about matters that he/she finds unconvincing, doubtful or unclear. The teacher, on the other hand, should not hold back in giving the knowledge that is appropriate for each grade. The interaction should be in a manner that there is no coercion (ikrah) in the acceptance of this knowledge because the knowledge would then not benefit.96 The Fatimids maintained that the ascent through the grades of rational religious instruction, which gradually increases the intellect and knowledge of the student, parallels the 'physical' upbringing of a baby from birth to adulthood. The student, at the start of the program, having given the oath of allegiance to the Imam97 and received permission to learn, is seen as newly born into dacwat al-haqq: just as the newborn does not know much about the physical world, so the 'newborn' in religion does not know much about the intellectual religious world; just as the baby's body is tended to and groomed at the beginning, so the student's zahir - his/her exoteric beliefs and actions - is, during the first grades, rectified and brought in line with the true zahir of the Qur'an and the Snarl0a. Only after this stage can there be progress to</page><page sequence="22">130 Journal of Qur'anic Studies the next; just as the mother provides her baby with milk, so the 'mother' in religion, the daci who has taken the student's oath, teaches him/her the initial grade of ta3wlU sometimes referred to as rada3 ('suckling'). As the infant develops into a child, is able to ingest more and more complex foods, and under the tarbiya ('upbringing') of its parents eventually reaches maturity, so the student progresses in intellect and rational knowledge, and is able to comprehend, under the pedagogy of his/her parents in religion, the higher more complex grades of taJwil, to eventually reach the level of bulugh ('adulthood'), and the ranks of hudud. In the religious world, the world that is believed to persist in the hereafter, the Imam and his hudud are the 'adults', and the followers who are imparted this knowledge are the 'children' who 'grow' and 'become mature' as they ascend through the grades.98 In light of this parallelism, what al-Nucman and the Fatimids seem to suggest particularly vis-a-vis interpretive strategies may be approximated by a hypothetical elementary example: imagine a child who does not yet know the significance of shaking hands, and that in many countries it represents friendship and a willingness to communicate amicably. Imagine that the father says to the child, 'Shake hands when you meet other children in your playgroup' and leaves, and then the mother takes the child to the playgroup. When the child meets the other children, he is confused regarding the meaning of 'shake hands;' he knows from his current vocabulary that it can stand for clasping hands with another person, or for swaying one's hands back and forth. The child has no way to judge what his father intended, and his knowledge of semantics does not produce a determinate interpretation of his father's words. The mother then clarifies that it is the clasping of hands rendition that is intended, perhaps by showing the child that other people do it as well when they meet each other. It is only when the child grows older, and his intellect and knowledge increase, that the parents are able to gradually explain in richer terms why clasping of hands is significant, the implications it has regarding the conveyance of amicability to the opposite person, its importance in building human relationships, and the vitalness of such relationships in life. As the child slowly comes to realise the significance of shaking hands, he realises why his father could only have intended clasping of hands and not swaying them from one side to the other. Coming back to the Daca3im and its interpretive strategies, let us, for example, compare Q. 48:27 (table 5) and Q. 22:30-1 (table 10). In Q. 48:27, 'shaved heads' is taken as better than 'trimmed heads' because the former is mentioned before the latter, whereas in Q. 22:30-1, false testimony is taken via parallelism to be as grave as shirk. The reasons for why word order is seen as significant in Q. 48:27 but not in Q. 22:30-1, and parallelism is seen as applicable in Q. 22:30-1 but not in Q. 48:27, would only become fully apparent as the student (the 'child') realises the 'rational' determiners of the rules and rituals that result from the choice of strategy. This can only happen as he/she gradually progresses to the higher grades, and acquires, under</page><page sequence="23">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 131 the pedagogy of the Imam and his hudud (the 'adults'), the requisite intellect and knowledge to be able to comprehend the reasoning. Conclusion The survey of the various categories of strategies employed by al-Nucman in interpreting ayas in Daca?im al-Isldm reveals that he relies upon common interpretive principles, and does not use formahsations comparable to those found in the SunnI usul al-fiqh tradition. Furthermore, no equivalent system of usul is developed in the Fatimid tradition by al-Nucman or any other dacl. I argued that the Fatimids, in contradiction to the Sunni case, do not accept that usul principles could act as the chief legitimisers of interpretation. Al-Nucman, as I demonstrated, reasons that interpretive strategies are indeterminate in both their definitions and outcomes and are thus unable to determine and justify God's law, a law that, according to him, needs to be definite and devoid of ikhtildf. He emphasises the Fatimid system wherein the living Imam, believed to be the inheritor of the Prophet physically and knowledge-wise, and trusted as the most rational and knowledgeable being after the Prophet, occupies the role of the absolute legitimiser. To ascertain the role of the interpretive strategies used by al-Nucman in the DacdJim, I examined the framework of Fatimid epistemology and education. In a system where students are taught the plain-sense meanings of the Qur'an and the law in the initial grades, and as they progress to higher grades the 'rational truths' that are seen as symbolically pointed to by the Qur'an and the law, interpretive strategies seem to serve the purpose of initially convincing the student of an interpretation. Doubts are expected to remain and to be gradually eliminated as the student ascends in the grades and hears the further 'rational' arguments. In light of this framework, one can state that the Fatimid equivalent of Sunni usul, in terms of its function of legitimising the law, is the living Imam, precisely because of his alleged capacity as possessor of the comprehensive rationales behind law and creation. More accurately, the Imam in conjunction with the rationales that are put forward in Fatimid texts of higher grades, and of which he is seen as the source, acts as the legitimiser.

I have used this methodology to examine the Daca7im for this study. 32 Quotations in Kitab al-waldya in Daca'im I are not included in this count on account of it not being strictly about legal precepts; rather, it explains the sources of law, viz. the Qur'an, the Sunna, and the sayings of the Imams. 33 See, for example, Muqatil b.

Coulson, A History of Islamic Law (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1964), p. 12; Wael Hallaq, art. 'Law and the Qur'an' in Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an. Al-Nucman's choice of legal verses seems to be close to those considered as legal by other sources; for example, Coulson, A History of Islamic Law, p. 14, purports that marriage and divorce laws are the most commonly dealt with subjects in the Qur'an, and this is borne out by the percentage of ay as on these subjects that are quoted by al Nucman.

Implicit strategies, such as placement in a particular context, will not</page><page sequence="27">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 135 be examined in much detail. Furthermore, I have relegated the analysis of the authorities that are cited in interpretation to a future study. Authoritative traditions are an important aspect of legitimisation but these traditions need to be interpreted themselves using strategies. 35 DacaJim I, p. 240; for more examples, see also p. 202 (Q. 2:60); Daca'im II, p. 189 (Q. 30:21). For this and subsequent examples, the excerpt is pasted unaltered from the respective published text, the punctuations of which unfortunately are not always consistent, but are helpful nonetheless. The only alterations from the original are the solid underlining of verbatim Qur'anic quotations, the dashed underlining of modified ones, as well as the removal of diacritical marks, which are given quite inconsistently. The context in which the excerpt occurs in the text is, where required, summarised in square brackets at the beginning of the excerpt. The translation provided is my own and, to avoid wordiness, omits laudatory formulas that occur in the original. The translations of ayas that occur in the excerpt are also my own, and aim to relate the meaning that the author seems to have intended by embedding the quotation in its respective context in the text. The translations of ayas are underlined, solidly for verbatim quotations, and dashed underlining for modified ones. The verse numbering follows the Egyptian edition.

Ta'wll al-DacdJim III, pp. 255f. For another example, see Dacd?im I, p. 108f. (Q. 5:6). 43 Poonawala pointedly - but to me inexplicably - uses an alternative reading of Q. 4:12, suggested by David S. Powers, Studies in Qur'an and Hadith: The Formation of the Islamic Law of Inheritance (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986), pp. 23ff.; 'if a man designates a daughter-in-law or wife as heir ...' in his translation of this passage (al-Nucman, The Pillars of Islam, vol. 2, p. 369). It is clear from al-Nucman's explanation of this aya in Dacd*im II, p. 375, and kalala specifically in p. 372, and his stance against designation of inheritors in pp. 358f., that he would not subscribe to Powers' reading. Poonawala's laboured</page><page sequence="28">136 Journal of Qur'anic Studies translation of the relevant passage at p. 372 (al-Nucman, The Pillars of Islam, vol. 2, p. 367) also suffers from putting Powers' views into al-Nucman's mouth. 44 Daca7im II, p. 375.

The status of these ayas as constituting naskh is disputed (see, for example, al-Nahhas (or Ibn al-Nahhas), Abu Jacfar Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Ismacil al-Muradi (d. 338/950), al-Nasikh wa'l-mansukh, ed. Muhammad cAbd al-Salam Muhammad (Kuwait: Maktabat al-Falah, 1408 AH), p. 390, pp. 432ff., p. 696; Ibn al-JawzI, AbU'l-Faraj cAbd al-Rahman (d. 597/1200), Nawasikh al-Qur"an (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-cIlmiyya, 1405 AH), p. 160; Ibn al-JawzI, Abu'l-Faraj cAbd al-Rahman, al-Musaffa bi-akuff ahl al-rusukh min cilm al-ndsikh wa'l-mansukh, ed.

Cf. Ta'wll al-DacaJim III, pp. 143ff. For another example, see Daca?im II, pp. 358f. (Q. 2:180). 53 DacaJim I, p. 65. For another example, see DacaJim I, pp. 257f. (Q. 9:103). 54 In Daca 7im I, p. 103, al-Nucman mentions his general policy of not arguing in the Daca?im against non-Fatimid interpretations. 55 Fyzee, 'Aspects of Fatimid Law', pp. 83ff, gives an overview of some of these aspects. A majority of the rulings in the DacaDim are similar to at least one of the Sunn! madhahib. 56 Azim Nanji, 'An IsmacIli Theory of Waldyah in the DacaJim al-Islam of Qadi al-Nucman' in Donald P. Little (ed.), Essays on Islamic Civilization: Presented to Niyazi Berkes (Leiden: Brill, 1976), pp. 260-73, at pp. 263ff, has summarised the essential arguments presented in Kitab al-waldya regarding the imama and its Sunni conception.</page><page sequence="29">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 137 57 In Daca?im II, p. 368, for example, al-Nucman argues that the Sunni interpretation of walad ('child') for inheritance purposes in Q. 4:176 and Q. 4:12 is inconsistent. For a study of Sunni, Twelver and Fatimid interpretations of walad, see Agostino Cilardo, 'Some Peculiarities of the Law of Inheritance: The Formation of Imam! and Isma'ili Law', Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies 3 (2000), pp. 127-37. 58 See al-Majalis wa'l-musayarat, p. 135; Poonawala, 'Al-Qadi al-Nu'man's Works and the Sources', pp. 11 If.; Poonawala, 'Al-Qadi al-Nu'man and Isma'ili Jurisprudence', p. 139, n. 45. 59 See below for a presentation of some of the contents of this text. 60 Al-Qadi al-Nucman, al-Urjuza al-mukhtara, ed. Ismail K. Poonawala (Montreal: McGill University, 1970). Farhad Daftary, Ismaili Literature: A Bibliography of Sources and Studies (London: LB. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2004), p. 146, comments 'with 2375 verses, this work is one of the longest arajiz [sic] in the history of Arabic literature'. 61 Dacd?im I, p. 108. Cf. TaJwll al-DacaJim I, pp. 121ff. For another example, see Daca?im I, pp. 257f. (Q. 9:103). 62 Daca"im I, p. 375. For another example, see pp. 69f. (Q. 42:22-3). Note that 'Qur'anic context' is not an independent objective parameter; what is deemed as the Qur'anic context of an ay a will depend on the specific meanings that one assigns neighbouring ay as. Even if one restricts such meanings to only those that emanate from a plain-sense reading of the ayas, in most - if not all - cases, the set of possible contexts, taking into consideration the subtleties and nuances of meaning, will not be fully determinable. There are a few instances where coherence is explicitly denied; for example, Daca'im I, pp. 24f. states that Q. 25:73 was revealed regarding all believers whereas the subsequent aya was only for the Prophet and his progeny. 63 Daca'im I, p. 8. Cf. Ta?wll al-Daca?im I, p. 75. For another example, see Daca3im II, p. 329 (Q. 2:267). At first glance, this interpretation may be construed as a synecdochical metonymy: salat is a part of Iman, and so God uses Iman to mean salat because of this connection. Upon a closer look, however, one realises that al-Nucman's argument in the 'Chapter on Faith', in which this quotation occurs, is to establish that each particular duty is manifestly lman\ salat is therefore Iman, and thus there is no metonymy. There are cases of regular metaphoric and metonymic renditions in the Daca*lm, such as interpreting qarya ('village') as ahl al-qarya ('the people of the village') in Q. 16:112 (DacaJim II, p. 114), but none that are uncommon and pragmatically unwarranted. For examples of the latter in Qur'anic interpretation, see Adrian Gully, 'Tadmln, "Implication of Meaning", in Medieval Arabic', Journal of the American Oriental Society 117:3 (1997), pp. 466-80; CAH Sallum, Balaghat al-cArab: Nash'atuha - tatawwuruha - culumuha (Beirut: Dar al-Mawasim, 2002), pp. 160f. 64 Daca3im I, p. 282. For another example, see DacaJim II, p. 18 (Q. 4:29). For example, in Kitab ta'wil al-sharica, MS 3 (Mumbai: Private Collection, n.d.), p. 7, a text that presents al-Mucizz's legal and other pronouncements, and was probably compiled by al-Nucman, it is asserted that the esoteric knowledge is filled with 'allusions and symbolisms without explication'. 65 For example, the significance of while they are bowing in Q. 5:55 in DacaJim I, p. 21, is not clear until one reads its explanation in Ta3wll al-DacaJim I, p. 61. The referents of the people of rebellion in Q. 49:9 are much more particularised in al-Qadi al-Nucman, Mukhtasar al-athar, ed. CAH Asghar Dhu3ayb (2 vols, Surat: al-Jamica al-Sayfiyya, 1425 AH), vol. 1, pp. 368f., than in DacaJim I, p. 388. 66 See, for example, Malik b. Anas, al-Muwatta\ ed.

For Malik's use of the Qur'an, see Dutton, The Origins of Islamic Law.</page><page sequence="30">138 Journal of Qur'anic Studies This similarity may exist in some part because many of the traditions in which a subset of these interpretive strategies occurs are related on the authority of the Imams al-Baqir and al-Sadiq, drawn from sources that date back as early as the first half of the second/eighth century; for an analysis of al-Nucman's sources, some of which are listed in the extant portion of al-Idah, see Madelung, 'The Sources of Isma'ili Law'. These Imams are also reported to have had a significant role in the development of Islamic law in general; see Arzina Lalani, Early ShVl Thought: The Teachings of Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (London: LB.

Lowry, Early Islamic Legal Theory: The Risala of Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi% Studies in Islamic Law and Society, 30 (Leiden: Brill, 2007); and Bernard G. Weiss, The Spirit of Islamic Law (Athens: The University of Georgia Press, 1998). Devin Stewart, 'Muhammad b. Da3ud al-Zahiri's Manual of Jurisprudence, al-Wusul ila macrifat al-usuT in Bernard G. Weiss (ed.), Studies in Islamic Legal Theory, Studies in Islamic Law and Society, 15 (Boston: Brill, 2002), pp. 99-158, argues that the usul al-fiqh genre was well-established earlier than the late ninth century AD. 68 See, for example, table 11. Cf. The discussion on 'equivocal words' in Hallaq, art. 'Law and the Qur'an'. 69 See, for example, table 12. 70 Al-Nucman was well acquainted with the usul tradition, as can be judged from his works (see notes 58-60), especially his Ikhtilaf. In DacaJim I, pp. 84ff. and Daca?im II, pp. 535f, he argues against several principal points of usul. Also, in DacaJim I, pp. 68f, he refutes those who say that Q. 42:23 was abrogated (nusikhat) by Q. 34:47, using the technical details of Sunni naskh theory (for detailed analyses of Sunni naskh, see John Burton, The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1990); Kamali, Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence, pp. 202ff; Christopher Melchert, 'Qur'anic Abrogation Across the Ninth Century: Shafi'i, Abu 'Ubayd, MuhasibT, and Ibn Qutaybah' in Bernard G. Weiss (ed.), Studies in Islamic Legal Theory, Studies in Islamic Law and Society, 15 (Leiden: Brill, 2002), pp. 75-98). My study of Qur'anic abrogation in Fatimid texts - which I hope to publish soon - suggests that even though it was accepted that certain ayas revised others, the theory was strikingly different from its Sunni definitions. Furthermore, it was generally not referred to as 'naskh', possibly to avoid confusion. Note that here I am not referring to the concept of a natiq ('major' prophet) abrogating the law of a previous one; this is referred to as 'naskh1 and advocated by al-Nucman and the Fatimids; see Asas al-ta"wll, p. 76, p. 199 and TaJwll al-Daca3im III, p. 211. The Fatimid interpretations of muhkamatlmutashabihat in Q. 3:7 are also different from those one encounters in non-Fatimid texts, and require more study. Some of the above-mentioned categories of usul are referred to once without explanation in Daca 'im I, p. 36, where al-Sadiq is reported to have said that the Imam has knowledge of them vis-a-vis the Qur'an. Also, at pp. 75f, a tradition mentions that cibddl ('my servants') in Q. 39:53 is khass for the Shica, and not camm regarding all Muslims. In the absence of any sustained usage of such categories in Fatimid fiqh, these one-off reports can be seen only as temporary borrowings, perhaps for polemical purposes. 71 Burton, The Sources of Islamic Law, pp. 12ff; Norman Calder, Studies in Early Muslim Jurisprudence (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993); Wael B.

Da'ud al-Zahiri's Manual of Jurisprudence', p. 116, n. 55, demonstrates that Ikhtilaf was composed between 343/954 and 363/974, and probably before 359/969. See also the discussion in note 79 in this article. 73 Al-Nucman mentions ijmac a few times in the DacaJim: one instance which seemingly accepts its validity, perhaps in the spirit of granting the opponent's premise, is to argue for the excellence of the progeny of Muhammad (Da^^im I, p. 32); at other times, it is mentioned to indicate that there is agreement between the Imams and other Muslims on a particular point (DacaJim I, p. 39; Daca'im II, pp. 97f., p. 393). 74 The translations provided here are general. For more precise definitions, see the references provided in note 67. 75 Ikhtilaf, pp. 8Iff., pp. 105ff.

See also Dodge, 'The Fatimid Legal Code', p. 36. 76 Istidlal was put forward particularly by the Zahiris as a method more reliable than practices such as ijtihad, istihsan and qlyas. Al-Nucman maintains that istidlal is not exclusive to the Zahiris; all Islamic sects perform istidlal in drawing support from the Qur'an and Sunna, even though they may not explicitly use the term. 77 Ikhtilaf, pp. 193ff. 78 Ikhtilaf p. 29, p. 38, pp. 66ff., pp. 193ff., pp. 206ff. and pp. 217f.

For the occurrence of this hadlth in Sunni and Twelver collections, such as the Sahlhayn of Muslim (d. 261/875) and al-Tirmidhi (d. 279/892), and al-Kafi of al-Kulaynl (d. 328-9/939-41), see al-Nucman, The Pillars of Islam, vol. 1, p. 37, n. 84. Another version that is reported has 'my sunna' instead of 'my progeny, my ahl bayf. Al-Nucman lists the former but does not reject it, and argues on its basis against taqlld (following someone else's ijtihad). He then says that the thabit ('certain') one is the latter; Ikhtilaf, p. 58. The contention that the Qur'an on its own could not convey stable meaning and that it would always be what the various interpreters wanted it to be seems to be out of step with the prevailing notion at the time of texts more or less straightforwardly conveying the intentions of its authors; see Bernard G. Weiss, 'Exotericism and Objectivity in Islamic Jurisprudence' in Nicholas Heer (ed.), Islamic Law and Jurisprudence (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1990), pp. 53-71, at pp. 58ff.; Weiss, The Spirit of Islamic Law, pp. 52ff. Poonawala, 'Al-Qadi al-Nu'man and Isma'ili Jurisprudence', pp. 124f., p. 139, n. 48, observes that in the 'Chapter on the Essential Guidelines for Judges' in al-Nucman's Mukhtasar al-athar, ed. Mucizz Fadli-Husayn (2 vols, Surat: al-Jami?a al-Sayfiyya, 1425 AH), vol. 2, p. 383, and his Kitab al-lqtisar, ed. Murtada Ismacil Madarwala (2 vols, Surat: al-Jamica al-Sayfiyya, 1425 AH), vol. 2, p. 85 (Poonawala uses different editions of these texts; for Mukhtasar, he cites an MS in the Mulla Qurban Husayn Godhrawala Collection; for al-lqtisar, he cites the edition by M.W. Mirza (Damascus, 1957)), al-Nucman says that qadls should refer to the Qur'an, the Sunna, the sayings of the Imams, and the living Imam for matters of law. However, in the respective location in DacaJim II, p. 535, the enjoinment to refer to the living Imam is cut away. Instead, al-Nucman reports a tradition in which al-Sadiq advises the qadi to look only at the Qur'an and Sunna. When asked about what the qadi should do if he does not find what he is</page><page sequence="32">140 Journal of Qur'anic Studies looking for in the Qur'an and Sunna, al-Sadiq retorts that everything that is to do with religion is in the Qur'an and Sunna. From this, Poonawala concludes, '[t]hus, it is clear that the authority of the ruling Imam is dropped from the Da (a 'im. This development in Nu'man's thought clearly indicates that the Da 'a 'im was composed later than the Ikhtilaf. It also suggests that gradually the Fatimid caliphs, in theory at least, gave up interfering in legal matters, hence the legal authorities were confined to al-Sadiq and his predecessors, who were accepted both by the Sunnis and Shi'is'. Poonawala's analysis seems hasty, when one considers the following points: a) This tradition in the Daca?im does not include an enjoinment to refer to the earlier Imams; rather only to the Qur'an and Sunna, which do not exclude 'any issue concerning religion'. Poonawala, however, does not conclude from this that the authority of all Imams, including al-Sadiq and his predecessors, is also dropped. b) The tradition in the DacaJim ends with al-Sadiq elaborating on his statement regarding all relevant information being in the Qur'an and Sunna, 'God helps and guides towards it whom He wishes from His creation, and it is not how you [plural] think'. This - at first glance puzzling - statement can be understood in light of the tradition related in DacaJlm I, pp. 92ff., on the authority of one of the followers of al-Sadiq. He argues with a qadi who says that for that which one does not find in the Qur'an and Sunna, one should apply one's own ra'y ('opinion'). The follower says that ayas such as Q. 16:89, We have sent the Book down upon you as an explanation of all things, indicate that the Qur'an has everything. Alleviating the reported confusion of his hearer, he elaborates that the knowledge of these things is with CAH and his sons, the Imams. Following from this, the tradition quoted by Poonawala does not necessarily pre-empt the earlier Imams or the living Imam. Cf. Ikhtilaf pp. 39ff. and p. 164; al-Majalis wa'l-musayarat, p. 75. c) Time and again, al-Nucman emphasises in the DacaJim that taca ('obedience') to the living Imam is indispensible, and that the deeds of one who does not follow the living Imam will not be looked upon favourably; see, for example, Dacd?lm I, p. 4, p. 13, p. 43, pp. 45f. and pp. 52f. d) In Daca?im I, p. 182, al-Nucman relates a tradition which says that legal judgement and punishment cannot be validly achieved without an Imam. At p. 360, in the long tradition he relates on the authority of CAH, it is said that if two qadis differ amongst themselves regarding a judgement, they should ask the Imam. e) In many of his legal texts (see, for example, DacaJim I, p. 103; al-Qadi al-Nucman, al-Ikhbar fi'l-fiqh, ed. cAziz Sayf al-DIn (Surat: al-Jamica al-Sayfiyya, 1425 AH), pp. Iff.; al-Nucman, Kitab al-lqtisar, vol. 1, pp. 12ff), al-Nucman explains that his motive has been to accumulate all that has been related by the ruwat ('narrators') regarding law on the authority of the ahl al-bayt and the Imams. The traditions generally go down to al-Sadiq only; from al-Sadiq to the appearance of al-Mahdi, the Imams are believed to have been hidden (except Ismacfl, who is believed to have died during al-Sadiq's lifetime). Al-Nucman says that the function vis-a-vis law performed by the Fatimid Imams, under whom he wrote his texts, including al-Mucizz, under whom he wrote the DacaJim, was primarily that of sifting the authentic narrations from the inauthentic ones, and thereby confirming the law that was seen as coming from the Prophet and related by the earlier Imams, showing the correct interpretation by applying it, and providing direction where there was obscurity regarding particular precepts. This role is referred to in Daca7im I, p. 103, in texts that were written before the Da^'lm (al-Qadi al-Nucman, al-Muntakhaba fl'l-fiqh, ed. cAbd al Husayn Najml (2 vols, Surat: al-Jamica al-Sayfiyya, 1425-6 AH), vol. 1, pp. 3-5; vol. 2, p. 60 and p. 180), in those that were written after it (al-Majalis wa'l-musayarat, pp. 305f.; Ta'wll al-Daca Jim I, p. 48 and p. 156), and in those for which the dating in relation to it is not definite (Ikhtilaf, pp. 34f., pp. 51f. and pp. 163f.; al-Nucman, Mukhtasar al-athar, vol. 1, pp. 6f). TaJwll al-sharica also contains legal and other pronouncements by al-Mucizz.</page><page sequence="33">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 141 The mention of the Qur'an, Sunna, the Imams, and the living Imam as the sources to which the qadi should turn occurs in Mukhtasar al-dthdr and al-Iqtisdr in lengthy passages that also discuss other attributes of the qadi; the respective passages are in al-Nucman's voice, as opposed to being embedded in a tradition. A similar passage in al-Nucman's voice is altogether missing in the Dacd?im, and why this is so remains to be seen. In light of the above-listed evidence, however, one cannot agree with Poonawala's assessment that the authority of the living Imam is cut away from the Dacd3im, and that therefore Ikhtilaf was necessarily written before the Dacd3im, and the legal role occupied by the Fatimid Imams on a theoretical level diminished. 80 The hadith in Arabic is: Hdhd hakama al-hdkim fa-ijtahada thumma asdba fa-lahu ajrdn wa-idhd hakama wa-ijtahada thumma akhta 'a fa-lahu ajr\ 81 Only the Imam can pronounce and affirm law in the Fatimid legal system codified by al-Nucman. It can be applied by qualified judges that are appointed by him. On the theoretical level, this is attested to by several chapters in al-Nucman's texts that explain the essential guidelines for judges (see DacdJim II, pp. 527ff.; Mukhtasar al-dthdr, vol. 2, p. 376ff; Kitdh al-iqtisar, vol. 2, p. 83ff), and on the practical level by the Fatimid judicial system (see Haji, 'Institutions of Justice'; Wilferd Madelung, 'The Religious Policy of the Fatimids toward their Sunni Subjects in the Maghrib' in Marianne Barrucand (ed.), L'Egypte Fatimide: Son Art et Son Histoire (Paris: Presses de l'Universite de Paris-Sorbonne, 1999), pp. 97-104). 82 Instances of such occurrences from in and outside the capital city are reported by historians such as al-Maqrizi, Ibn Hajar (d. 852/1449) and cImad al-DIn; for references, see Fyzee, 'Qadi an-Nu'man', pp. 22f.; Gottheil, 'A Distinguished Family of Fatimide Cadis', pp. 245ff.; Samuel M. Stern, 'Isma'ili Propaganda and Fatimid Rule in Sind' in his Studies in Early Isma'llism (Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, 1983), pp. 177-88, at p. 181. See also Daftary, The Ismd'llls, 1st edn p. 184. It is also likely that the Fatimid caliph-Imams may have delegated some part of these functions to senior judges. Further research is required to provide a fuller picture regarding the interaction between the caliph-Imams, and the senior and ordinary judges regarding such matters. 83 Ikhtilaf p. 53, pp. 203ff. and pp. 209ff.; DacdJim I, p. 360. Interestingly, al-Nucman does not mention the expression, sometimes reported as a hadith, 'ikhtilaf amongst the culama3 ('the learned') is [God's] mercy' or its variants, even though it seems to have been drawn upon by his time for justification. For examples of justifications of ikhtilaf, see al-Jassas, Ahkdm al-Qur3an, vol. 2, p. 314, p. 331; vol. 4, pp. 196f; vol. 5, p. 28, p. 55, p. 317; Ibn cAtiyya al-AndalusT, Abu Muhammad cAbd al-Haqq b.

Weiss, The Spirit of Islamic Law, pp. 95ff., pp. 11 If. and pp. 116ff., explains some of the justificatory ideas, such as the requirement that the mujtahid should have spent all possible effort, and that uncertainty in law posed no hindrance. Coulson, A History of Islamic Law, pp. 86ff, discusses the development of mutual tolerance and acceptance between the Sunni madhahib.</page><page sequence="34">142 Journal of Qur'anic Studies 84 An interesting parallel can be drawn with the Twelver case. Devin J. Stewart, Islamic Legal Orthodoxy: Twelver Shllte Responses to the Sunni Legal System (Salt Lake City: The University of Utah Press, 1998), observes that after the 'greater occupation' of the Twelfth Imam in 329/ 941, and in the absence of a living authority, there began a gradual development process of a SunnMike system of usul, albeit with some important differences. For Twelver usul works, see Stewart, Islamic Legal Orthodoxy; and Hossein Modarressi Tabataba'i, An Introduction to ShVl Law: A Bibliographical Study (London: Ithaca Press, 1984). A comparable system of usul was not developed in the post-Fatimid period by the major sects that trace their beliefs to the Fatimids. For the Nizaris, an 'unconcealed' living Imam was present throughout most of their history (as he is today), and also, during several spans of time, the SharTa was not to be physically practiced; see Daftary, The Ismd'llls, 1st edn, pp. 30Iff. For the Tayyibis, the 'concealment' of their Imam in 526/1132 did not mean an absence of a singular living authority; a successive line of daclmutlaqs were believed to represent the hidden line of Imams; importantly, each da% in his time, was believed to hold the authority of the Imam (as he is today). The development and application of Fatimid law by the Tayyibis is yet to be studied in depth. Qutbuddin, 'The Principles of Finance in Fatimi Tayyibi Law' has made a start by examining the interpretation of Fatimid financial principles by several daci mutlaqs, including, in the modern period, by the fifty-first ddci mutlaq of the Tayyibi Da?udl branch, Sayyidna Tahir Sayf al-DIn (d. 1965). 85 Cited by Paul E. Walker, Early Philosophical Shiism: The Ismaili Neoplatonism of Abu Ya'qiib al-Sijistanl (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 127. Other Fatimid ducat have also listed various arguments, including pragmatic ones, to argue for the need for a living interpreter; see, for example, al-Kirmanl, Ahmad Hamid al-DIn, Master of the Age: An Islamic Treatise on the Necessity of the Imamate, A Critical Edition of the Arabic Text and English Translation of Hamid al-Din Ahmad b. Abd Allah al-Kirmanl's al-Masablh ft ithbat al-imama, ed. and tr. Paul E. Walker (London: LB.

The practical role of the Fatimid caliph Imams in the development and application of the law as well as other sciences is yet to be studied in depth. It is generally observed that most texts were written by the ducat, who almost without exception attributed their knowledge to their living Imam (see, for example, Ta'wll al Daca1lm I, pp. 48f., 132; Ta'wll al-Dacd3im III, p. 233; al-Mu3ayyad, al-Ml'a al-thaniya min al-majalls al-Mu'ayyadlyya, p. 182; Walker, Hamid al-Dln al-Kirmanl, pp. 56, 60f). Texts which relate the ducafs communications with their Imams and the latter's specific contributions, such as al-Majalis wa'l-musayarat; al-Nucman, al-Muntakhaba jt'l-fiqh, vol. 1, p. 3; al-Kirmanl, Master of the Age, p. AT; Macadd al-Mustansir bi'llah, al-Sljillat al Mustansiriyya, ed. cAbd al-Muncim Majid (Dar al-Fikr al-cArabi, 1954), will be invaluable in this exercise (also see the references provided in point 'e' in note 79). For reports of the Imams' involvement in imparting legal pronouncements, see the references provided in note 82; Haji, 'Institutions of Justice', pp. 205ff. Note that al-Nucman's arguments from Ikhtilaf, which have been related in brief here, draw support from both scriptural as well as rational and pragmatic musings. On several occasions, they are explicitly borrowed from non-Fatimid scholars. They provide a valuable insight into not only the contemporary status of Sunni usul, but also on a more general level, into the debate and discussion between prominent personalities and groups in the struggle for representing Islamic orthodoxy. For a presentation of some of the contents of Ikhtilaf, its intertextual relationships with Sunni usul texts (especially al-Wusul lid macrifat al-usul of Muhammad b. Da3ud al-Zahiri (d. 296/908-9 or 297/909-10)), and its implications regarding the development</page><page sequence="35">Fatimid Legal Exegesis of the Qur'an 143 of Sunni usul, see Stewart, 'Muhammad b.

They remained in touch with the Imam via letters but, essentially, were awarded independent charge of their group. This decentralised, almost paradoxical, form of government is often partially attributed to (as expressed by Wladimir Ivanow, 'The Organization of the Fatimid Propaganda', Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society 15 (1939), pp. 1-35, at pp. 4ff.), 'the indubitable historical fact of his [the dacVs\ extraordinary successes, almost bordering upon the miraculous ... from the Atlantic to innermost Asia'; also see Ivanow, 'The Organization', p. 20, p. 26; Walker, Hamid al-Dln al-Kirmanl, pp. 47f. 90 Asas al-taJwil, pp. 23ff., pp. 190f.; Ta'wll al-DacaJim I, p. 58, p. 92, pp. 15If; Ta'wll al-DacaJim II, p. 48, p. 111. This Fatimid conception of ?aql views reason not as being superior to revelation or vice versa; rather, it professes that revelation is the supreme manifestation of reason, and that caql is dependent on revelation to achieve its full potential. Emphasising the unity of religion and reason, it argues against movements which, according to the Fatimids, emphasised one at the expense of the other. The intellectual history of this conception in pre Fatimid IsmacIlism is difficult to determine as a result of the lack of textual evidence. Paul E. Walker, 'The Isma'llls' in Peter Adamson and Richard C. Taylor (eds.), The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 72-91, examines the respective cosmological doctrines put forward by the ducat, and briefly describes how they relate to this conception of caql, the Qur'an and Sharica.

The entire Asas al-ta?wll is dedicated to showing, by symbolically interpreting passages from the Qur'an, that this intellectual program of the dacwat al-haqq has persisted throughout human history. 92 Ta?wll al-DacaJim I, pp. 132, pp. 320f.; Ta'wll al-Daca7im III, pp. 152f., p. 221, p. 233. Note that Ta'wll al-DacaJim I-III only cover the symbolic meaning of the cibadat, comprising the first volume of the Daca?im. At several occasions in TaJwll al-DacaJim I (p. 94, p. 107, p. 112, p. 116, p. 135, p. 144, p. 168) and TaJwll al-Da^^im III (p. 133), he promises to explain the symbolic meaning of the mucamalat, comprising the second volume of the Daca?im, but no such text is extant, perhaps because it was lost or because al-Nucman died before he could compose it. 93 Studies on 'Ismacill ta 'wlV have mostly been synoptic overviews; see, for example, Anton M.

Henry Corbin, Swedenborg and Esoteric Islam, tr. Leonard Fox (West Chester: Swedenborg Foundation, 1999); al-Fiql, al-Ta'wll ususuhu wa-macanlhi; and Shah, 'Al-Qadi al-Nu'man and the Concept of Batin', present and analyse some content from Asas al-ta'wll and to a lesser extent Ta'wil al-Daca'im. Meir M. Bar-Asher, 'Outlines of Early Isma'IlI-Fatimid Qur'an Exegesis', Journal Asiatique 296:2 (2008), pp. 257-95, presents overviews of, amongst some other texts, Asas al-ta'wll, but surprisingly comments on p. 267, '[i]t is clear from al-Nu'man's words that Asas al-Ta'wll represents the highest level in the believer's path towards knowledge of esoteric interpretation'. Asas al-ta'wll is presented as a basic text of ta'wil by al-Nucman (Asas al-ta'wll, pp. 25ff); Ta'wil al-Daca'im is presented as the next higher text (Ta'wil al-Dacd'im I, pp. 48f); the non extant philosophical texts by al-Nucman would have probably been classified as much higher than these, judging from the classification of, for example, the highly philosophical Rabat al-caql of al-Kirmani vis-a-vis other Fatimid texts (Walker, Hamid al-Dln al-Kirmanl, pp. 56f.). 94 Ta'wil al-Daca'im I, p. 92; Ta'wil al-Daca'im II, p. Ill; Ta'wil al-Daca'im III, p. 186; al-Qadi al-Nucman, Mafdtlh al-nicma, MS #S. M. 7A. 035 HAQ (Mumbai: Private Collection, n.d.), pp. 37f. 95 Asas al-ta'wll, pp. 229f. 96 Al-Majalis wa'l-musayardt, pp. 116f, pp. 514ff; Ta'wil al-Daca'im I, p. 59, p. 147, p. 151; Ta'wil al-Daca'im III, p. 192. Ta'wil al-Dacd'im I, p. 59, also states that no one should be forced to believe in the Imam; this idea occurs in writings of most Fatimid ducat, and seems to follow from their stress on rationality in religion. The ideal Fatimid believer was seen as someone who was convinced of the need for a God-given interpreter and a designated heir of the Prophet, and who then, believing in the Fatimid Imam's possession of true knowledge, strived to verify this for him/her self by progressing through the grades. The contribution of these principles of Fatimid belief to how their education system worked in practice, as well as to their real-world policies of tolerance and non-coercion, notwithstanding the political circumstances, is yet to be extensively studied. 97 For the Fatimid oath of allegiance, see Halm, 'The Isma'ili Oath of Allegiance'. 98 Asas al-ta'wll, pp. 23ff., pp. 190f., pp. 315f.; Ta'wil al-Daca'im I, pp. 48f, p. 77, p. 151. In Asas al-ta'wll, p. 276, al-Nucman says that the hudud hear the concise statements of the Imams and expand them into lengthy explanations for the followers commensurate to their own grade of knowledge. In other words, it is when one becomes an 'adult' in religion and becomes one of the hudud, that one is able to compose, albeit always under the oversight of the Imam (also see Ta'wil al-Dacd'im II, p. 91). In Ikhtilaf, pp. 137ff., al-Nucman urges his opponents to ask the Imam and learn from him to understand that which God has permitted and forbade, and argues against those who, he says, assert that if one does not find a rule in the Qur'an or Sunna, one is allowed to derive it based on one's own opinion and caqL Debating against the argument that without such an allowance, the culama' ('learned persons') would not enjoy any fadl ('excellence') over others, he says that excellence comes from being able to haml ('bear') this knowledge. One who formulates law without knowledge and based on his opinion is not an cdlim, al-Nucman asserts, but a mubtadi0 ('innovator'). Al-Nu?man's statements may indicate that a polemic of not allowing room for caql and opinion may have existed against the Fatimids at the time. Later, al-Ghazall (d. 505/1 111) accuses them of invalidating the exercise of caql and opinion by believing in the absolute authority of the Imam; for this, see Farouk Mitha, Al-Ghazall and the Ismailis: A Debate on Reason and Authority in Medieval Islam (London: I.B.
