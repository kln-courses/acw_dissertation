<plain_text><page sequence="1">'TWENTY DIRHAMS' IN THE KITAB OF SIBAWAIHI By M. G. CARTER Sibawaihi has occasionally been criticized for his obscurity and incon- sistency. The former may be conceded, since it pertains only to his style and presentation, which undoubtedly make heavy demands on the reader, but the second criticism is an attack on Sibawaihi's linguistic reasoning and needs to be refuted. In the following pages we shall examine the background and use of the phrase 'ishriina dirhaman ' 20 dirhams' as a locus probans in more than a score of grammatical arguments in the Kitdb, to which must be added a dozen or so other cases involving the use of similar expressions and grammatical principles. Two results should emerge: first we should gain the impression that the Kitdb is a work of the utmost coherence and consistency (with due allowance for the date of its composition), and second we shall uncover certain features of Sibawaihi's grammatical theory which appear to have been ignored by later grammarians. Some five chapters of the Kitabl are devoted to the problems arising from the contamination of two originally distinct constructions: the first is conven- tionally known as 'improper' annexation ('i1dJfa ghayr haqiqlya, though Sibawaihi neither uses this terminology nor, indeed, makes any terminological distinction between 'true' and ' improper' annexation), e.g. hasanu 1-wajhi 'beautiful of face ', and the second consists of the undefined active participle followed by its direct object, e.g. .dribun Zaydan 'striking Zaid'. Here, too, Sibawaihi has no explicit term for the construction, but neither have any of the later grammarians. In view of its peculiar importance in Sibawaihi's gram- matical system I shall call it, for reasons which will become obvious, the tanwin-nasb construction. The first part of Sibawaihi's argument simply sets out and explores the possible combinations of these two constructions which are observed in Arabic. That there has been analogical extension in both directions is clear from the evidence: the active participle (or, to give it its Arabic name, ism al-fd'il 'the agent noun ') is seen to function not only as a verb in dadribun Zaydan 'striking Zaid' but also as a noun in the 'improper' annexation construction, viz. daribu Zaydin, lit. 'striker of Zaid'. It is the analogical extension in the other direction, however, which interests Sibawaihi, i.e. the substitution of the ' im- proper' annexation construction (e.g. hasanu 1-wajhi 'beautiful of face ') by the tanwin-nasb construction, e.g. al-hasanu wajhan, lit. 'the beautiful, in respect of face '. In the tanwin-nasb construction the adjective seems to have acquired the verbal function of the active participle, and this is recognized by Sibawaihi by giving it the name of 'the adjective which resembles the agent 1 They are chapters 37-41 (Bfiliq ed., I, 82-108, Derenbourg ed., I, 70-88). Ch. 40 is not con- sidered here, however, as it deals only with the similarities in behaviour between the agent noun and the verbal noun (masdar).</page><page sequence="2">486 M. G. CARTER noun in its grammatical effect '.2 The mutual resemblances may best be ap- preciated by setting out in the form of parallel tables all the variations on the two constructions which appear in Sibawaihi's argument, starting with the original verb and noun phrases from which they are derived (the numbers in brackets refer to the pages in vol. I of the Bfliq and Derenbourg editions respectively): (1) yaqribu Zaydan (82/70) hasanun wajhuhu (101/82) (2) .dribun Zaydan (82/70) 'ishriina dirhaman (104/85) (3) .dribu Zaydin (86/72) hasanu 1-wajhi (100/82) (4) al-ddribu Zaydan (93/77) al-hasanu wajhan (103/83) (5) al-.dribu 1-rajula 93/77) al-hasanu 1-wajha (103/84) (6) al-d4ribu 1-rajuli (93/77) al-hasanu 1-wajhi (103/83) (7) al-dIribiina 1-rajula (94/78) al-tayyibana 1-'akhbara (103/84) (8) al-diribfl Zaydin (94/78) al-tayyibfi 'akjhbrin (104/84) The examples are clearly not arranged in a random order: as well as exhibiting almost the same sequence in both groups they also culminate somewhat ob- scurely in the phrase 'ishrfina dirhaman, which is markedly out of sequence with the rest of the argument. There are two reasons for this; in the first place, while there are many expressions in Arabic structurally identical with 'ishrlna dirhaman, we do not find among them the' adjective which resembles the agent noun ', hence Sibawaihi cannot achieve the ultimate symmetry of having *hasanun wajhan, corresponding to ddribun Zaydan, in the above table.3 The second reason, which is confirmed by the importance of 'ishrina dirhaman in the rest of the Kitab, is that Sibawaihi regarded this particular phrase as an important proof of several grammatical principles concerning the function of tanwin, the effect of one part of an utterance upon another, and the relationship between identity and concordance. But before he can apply 'ishrilna dirhaman to these problems Sibawaihi must first prove that it does, in fact, belong in its place in the above table. In other words he must show that 'ishrilna dirhaman is structurally equivalent to the hypothetical *hasanun wajhan as well as formally identical with daribun Zaydan. There are difficulties in reproducing Sibawaihi's case here; while the fairly literal translation of Jahn adequately conveys the contents of Sibawaihi's argument, the process is extremely difficult to follow because so many different threads of reasoning are intertwined. While this is characteristic of Sibawaihi's style, there is no need for the modern reader to adopt the same (superficially!) confused methodology, and it seems best to extract the main themes of Siba- waihi's argument and deal with them separately. 2 al-sifatu l-mu8habbahatu bi-l-fd'ili ftmi 'amilat fthi; the full extent of the resemblance is easily discernible in the table below, and those familiar with the methods of the Arab grammarians will recognize the excellent specimen of qiyts (analogical reasoning) provided by these chapters. 3 Notwithstanding that later grammarians do detect examples of the pattern *hasanun wajhan, e.g. Zamakhshari, Mufassal, ed. J. P. Broch, 1879, 101.</page><page sequence="3">'TWENTY DIRHAMS' IN THE KITAB OF SiBAWAIHI 487 (1) Words have the power (quwwa) to affect other words.4 This is a funda- mental premise of all Sibawaihi's grammar, much of which is concerned with analysing the ' effect ' ('amal) of one word (the ' operator ', 'dmil) upon another (al-ma'mfldfihi).5 In the present instance he has already shown that the agent noun can exercise the same syntactical powers as a verb, cf. yadribu Zaydan and .dribun Zaydan in the above table. In the same table it is also apparent that the 'adjective which resembles the agent noun in its grammatical effect' can also function in the same way, e.g. al-hasanu wajhan, with the qualification that its verbal powers are restricted-hence no *hasanun wajhan. Finally there are other classes of words which exhibit the same powers to an even more restricted extent, i.e. the elative adjectives and the numerals from 11 to 99. These lack the power of the quasi-participial adjective for two reasons: because they are always undefined, and because they have been attached to the class of nouns rather than of verbs. Since they lack the power even of the quasi- participial adjective they suffer two further syntactic restraints: (i) being them- selves undefined, they may affect (or operate on) only undefined words; (ii) they are confined to one word order, inversion being excluded by their limited power. Sibawaihi gives, amongst others, an example of a type of verb which is also subject to these last two restrictions, viz. imtala'tu mn'an, tafaqqa'tu shahman. (2) The tanwin interrupts grammatical effect. This principle, which is invoked many times in the Kitib, is easily discernible in items (2) and (7) in the above table compared with items (3), (6), and (8). Separation (fasl) pre- vents annexation, which is the only form of subordination between nouns and non-verbal particles, and the alternative construction must be used, i.e. the subordinate element takes dependent (nasb) form,6 as in huwa 'ahsanu minka wajhan, huwa khayrun minka 'aban. It follows that words which end perma- nently in tanwin, such as 'ishrilna, can never be annexed to an adjacent word in the oblique (jarr, khafd) form. Two important conclusions are drawn from this: firstly, that the tanwin is the formal boundary marker of the complete morpheme or sequence of morphemes, secondly, that elements thus marked as complete can affect other elements in the utterance in such a way that the latter will assume dependent form. Both of these notions are illustrated in the phrase 'ishrana dirhaman and will be examined in due course; at this point it 4 In the Kitib this is purely an anthropomorphic metaphor, but it is interesting to observe that similar notions are emerging in modern linguistics, e.g. 'dependency grammar' (cf. W. O. Droescher in R. Ellis (ed.), Australasian Universities Language and Literature Association. Proceedings and papers of the thirteenth congress, held at Monash University, 12-18 August 1970, Melbourne, 1970, 326-9). 5 The ghost has long since been laid that these terms have anything to do with the Latin idea of governance or r6gime in grammar: v. J. Weiss, 'Die arabische Nationalgrammatik und die Lateiner ', ZDMG, LXrV, 1910, 349 f. 6 It no longer seems desirable to use the old Latin case names nominative, accusative, and genitive. They are replaced in this paper by ' independent ', ' dependent ', and ' oblique' re- spectively, names which at least have some correspondence with the syntactic functions they denote.</page><page sequence="4">488 M. G. CARTER is perhaps worth drawing attention to one basic misunderstanding of Siba- waihi's intention which seems to be fairly wide-spread, namely, the belief that every instance of the dependent form must be ascribed to some explicit or implicit verb. The whole purpose of Sibawaihi's argument is to prove not that, for example, the particle 'inna is followed by dependent forms because it con- tains a verbal idea, but that several classes of word have the ' power' to bring about the dependent form in the words on which they operate, and that this power is the same (but not so great) as that of the verbs. (3) There is a connexion (sabab) in meaning between the element bearing tanwin and the dependent element of a tanwin-nasb construction. This rare excursion of Sibawaihi's into the field of semantics, as well as demonstrating his reluctance to stray far from structural linguistics, also yields a general principle of Arabic syntax, viz. that between elements that are identical with each other (i.e. noun-adjective, subject-predicate) there will be concordance, while elements which are not identical can only combine in the tanw7n-nasb construction. Though the non-identity principle is not invoked in the present argument it is elsewhere explicitly associated with 'ishri~na dirhaman; but for the present Sibawaihi confines himself to pointing out that 'ishriina and dirhaman are bound by a sabab. Clearly this term sabab has a much wider application for Sibawaihi than when it is used by later grammarians exclusively in the context of the bi-aspectual (dhdt wajhayn) sentence, e.g. marartu bi-rajulin hasanatin 'ummuhu. In the Kitdb there is said to be a sabab between verbs and their direct objects, agent nouns and their direct objects (whether in 'im- proper' annexation or tanwin-nasb), and between the quasi-participial adjec- tives and what follows them either in 'improper' annexation or tanwin- nasb.7 Moreover, the presence or absence of a sabab is used in the Kitdb to distinguish between correct utterances such as m- Zaydun karzman wa-l1 'Jqilan 'abihu and incorrect ones such as *md Zaydun dhahiban wa-la 'dqilan 'Amrun. It will readily be appreciated that the sabab and the non-identity principle can be used to distinguish between the 'true' and 'improper' annexation construction: in 'improper' annexation the two elements are not identical with each other but are bound by a sabab, while in ' true ' annexation, as we are told in other parts of the Kitdb,8 one element is either included in or identical with the other. (4) In 'improper' annexation definition is neutralized. It is well known that in ' true' annexation the first element is defined by position and does not therefore take the definite article, and equally well known that the first element I It is thus possible to conclude that sabab is the semantic bond between all elements that are syntactically connected but are neither included in nor identical with each other. It follows that a correct utterance cannot contain elements that are unconnected with each other both seman- tically and structurally, which is precisely what Sibawaihi means when he describes such dis- located utterances as muh.dl' wrong ', ' when the end of your utterance contradicts the beginning ' (v. ch. 6, Bfl. ed., I, 8; Der. ed., I, 7). 8 e.g. BMl., I, 295; Der., I, 254.</page><page sequence="5">'TWENTY DIRHAMS' IN THE KITAB OF SIBAWAIHI 489 of an 'improper' annexation construction is not defined unless the definite article is prefixed. It is evident from dadribun Zaydan and al-.ddribu Zaydan that the first element of a tanwin-nasb construction likewise is not defined by position, but unfortunately there is no undefined *hasanun wajhan correspond- ing to the defined al-hasanu wajhan. Instead we find such constructions as 'ishrina dirhaman and khayrun (minka) 'aban, and the presumption is that these permanently undefined elements fill the slot which should be occupied by *hasanun wajhan. Not only is definition of the first element in ' improper ' annexation neutral- ized, but the same can be shown to be sometimes true of the second element. Sibawaihi adduces such synonymous doublets as 'awwalu rajulin/'awwalu 1-rijdli, kullu rajulin/kullu 1-rijali and then (somewhat casuistically, it must be admitted) claims that the undefined singular dirhaman after 'ishrina is only the preferred alternative to the more clumsy 'ishrdna min al-dardhimi, and the loss of definition in dardhimu does not affect 'ishrilna in any way. (5) In 'improper' annexation number is also neutralized. The same evidence for the neutralization of definition can be used to show that the second element of 'improper' annexation (and, by implication, of the tanwin-nasb construction) may be either singular or plural indifferently, which is reinforced by the evidence of 'afrahu 'abdin and 'afrahu l-'abidi (though Sibawaihi is careful to point out that 'afrahu is defined by al-'abidi9 while 'awwalu and kullu are not defined by al-rij li). Without going into the syntax of the elatives, which by this stage has become the main concern of Sibawaihi's argument, we can now see that, as a consequence of the above reasoning, 'ishrina dirhamran is explained as structurally identical with the comparative 'ahsanu minhu wajhan and the superlative 'ashja'u 1-nasi rajulan, for minhu and al-ndsi both exercise the same separative function as the tanwin of 'ishrilna. Since the superlative construction allows the choice between what might loosely be termed an explanatory annexation, e.g. khayru thnayni fi l-ndsi, and a dis- tributive annexation followed by a dependent element (' tamyTz ' to the later grammarians but never so named by Sibawaihi), e.g. khayru 1-nisi thnayni, it can properly be claimed that annexation and tanwin-nasb are structurally equivalent. This is not only necessary to justify the inclusion of 'ishrtna dirhaman among the alternants of' improper' annexation, but is also required as a means to harmonize the varied syntax of the numerals. The remainder of this part of the Kitdb proceeds, in fact, to discuss the numerals on the assumption that they occur in three variants of what has been proved to be basically the same construction."' It may appear that 'ishrfna dirhaman has been forgotten among the details 9 This would seem to contradict Wehr, who regards it as 'most unlikely ' that 'afdalu is felt to be undefined in 'afdalu rajulin (H. Wehr, Der arabische Elativ, Wiesbaden, 1953, 582). Bill. I, 105; Der., I, 85. 10 Thus the constructions of the numbers 3-10 and 100 upwards are ' improper ' annexations and the explanations for 'ishriina apply equally to them.</page><page sequence="6">490 M. G. CARTER of the argument, but we shall now briefly look at the use Sibawaihi makes of this phrase and others like it in the Kitab as a whole, after which there should no longer be any doubt that he always intended 'ishrina dirhaman to be the stock illustration of the various grammatical features it embodies. Reference is made to the volume and then the page of the Bfillq edition followed by that of the Derenbourg edition. (1) i, 20/16. The notion of separation (expressed punningly as 'inter- vention', h.ila bayna) is used to account for the dependent form of circum- stantial qualifiers (hal), which are said to be separated from their verbs by agents and objects in the same way that dirhaman is separated from 'ishrina by -na 'which prevents what follows from being in the oblique form'. Need- less to say, it is typical of Sibawaihi to use 'ishriina dirhaman before he has proved its validity or even discussed the issues involved." (2) I, 49/38. It is not correct to co-ordinate two sentences to one 'inna, e.g. *'inna fihi Zaydan wa-'Amran 'adkhaltuhu,12 because 'inna is not a verb (where this would be permitted), 'but only resembles a verb.., .and has the status of a verb, just as 'ishrina dirhaman and thaldthuina rajulan have the status of diribun 'Abdallahi without being verbs or agent nouns'. Here Siba- waihi is at pains to point out that those words which exercise verbal effect, such as 'inna, 'ishrlna etc., are in no way dependent on an elided verb or verbal meaning for their grammatical effect ('amal). (3) I, 104/85. Only at this stage is 'ishrilna dirhaman finally proved and established as a locus probans, as set out above. (4) I, 184/154. The dependent form of the maf'il lahu is explained on the grounds that 'it is neither an adjective to, nor included in its antecedent, and so it takes dependent form as does dirhaman in 'ishrilna dirhaman '. The issue here is non-identity, which results in non-concordance (which will be dealt with more fully below, cf. nos. (7) and (11)). It is worth mentioning that 'ishrfna dirhaman is so abruptly cited in this passage that its relevance would be impossible to recognize if Sibawaihi had not meant us to take account of the arguments behind it. (5) I, 201/170. The dependent form of the zurfif is accounted for by the effect ('amal) of the preceding part of the utterance, cf. 'anta 1-rajulu 'ilman and 'ishrfina dirhaman 'where 'ishrfina affects dirhaman '. The implication, which is developed by Sibawaihi elsewhere (cf. below, no. (7)), is that the zurif are affected by already complete utterances, and that 'ishrlna is a symbol of the complete utterance with tanwin as its marker. (6) I, 202/171. On the same subject, the dependent form of the zurfif is further explained as due to the fact that the zurfif are not identical with what precedes them, so that the antecedent 'acquires the status of a word with 11 But by anticipating himself Sibawaihi surely shows that he regarded the Kitib as a coherent whole, and did not merely stumble aimlessly from topic to topic. 12 It is, of course, possible to say 'inna ffhi Zaydan wa-'Amran 'adkhaltuhu if 'Amran is intended as the preposed object of 'adkhaltu, but that does not concern Sibawaihi here.</page><page sequence="7">'TWENTY DIRHAMS' IN THE KITIB OF SIBAWAIHI 491 tanwin which affects what follows just as 'ishrlna affects dirhaman '. A point to note is that Sibawaihi never attributes the dependent form of the zurff to any verbal operator. (7) I, 207/176. In dai khalfa ddrika farsak.han the dependent form of farsakhan is explained as follows: the sentence is already complete, although somewhat vague before farsakhan is added; farsak.han is then affected by what precedes it in the same way as dirhaman by 'ishrina, ' as if the utterance were something with tanwin affecting something that is not part of it nor identical with it, similar in status to 'afdaluhum rajulan '. With deceptive concision Sibawaihi has invoked two fundamental principles of his grammatical theory: 'ishrina is here the explicit symbol of the self-sufficient (mustagh.ni) utterance, marked by tanwin, and dirhaman is the symbol of the extraneous element (called fa4la by the later grammarians only) which is neither identical with, nor included in its antecedent, and which, therefore, must take the dependent form. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of these two notions. Apart from accounting for all occurrences of dependent forms which cannot be ascribed to a verbal operator, it is also possible for the tanwin (and any feature which is regarded as equivalent to it)13 to be recognized as the mark of syntactic completeness from the level of the individual word to that of the whole utterance. In addition the concept of non-identity/non-concordance is applied by Sibawaihi in its converse, i.e. the concordance of adjectives and the inseparability of the 'true' annexation construction are explained as being due to the identity of the components or the inclusion of one in the other.'4 (8) I, 212/180. As one proof that mithla followed by an oblique element in annexation forms an undefined compound, Sibawaihi observes that mithlahu can be substituted for dirhaman after 'ishrilna. Furthermore, even though mithla must always occur in annexation to some following word, it is equivalent to an hypothetical tanwin-nasb construction, e.g. *mithlun Zaydan, and is intended to be undefined in meaning. (9) I, 260/222. This is an explanation of the .hdl and zurflf in nominal sentences (cf. no. (6) above), e.g. fihqa Zaydun qd'iman: the utterance is already complete in fihd Zaydun and qd'iman takes the dependent form 'just as dirhaman does after 'ishrfna because it is not an adjective to it nor correlated syntactically with its antecedent '.'1 An interesting feature of this case is that Sibawaihi introduces the verb istaqarra, paraphrasing fiha Zaydun as ista- qarra fhJ Zaydun. Clearly this was not done to supply a verbal operator for the dependent form qd'iman, but was simply a device to ensure that f/ha5 in fi~h Zaydun would be construed as a full predicate and not as a zarf to 13 For example, the second element of the 'true' annexation construction is said by Khalil to be equivalent to tanwin (Bill., I, 323; Der., I, 281), also the feminine suffix and the second element of compound words such as hacramawtu (Bill., II, 12; Der., II, 12) and some other phenomena which would benefit from a more detailed study. 14 See p.488, n. 8. 15 The phrase 'correlated syntactically' is an attempt to render mahmmilan 'ali mi humila 'alayhi, which is easier to grasp than to express in English.</page><page sequence="8">492 M. G. CARTER *qd'imun if that were to be taken as predicate. The presence of a verb, Sibawaihi makes sure to point out here, is not necessary to put qd'iman into the dependent form-its relationship to the rest of the sentence is sufficient to do that. (10) I, 272/232. As part of a larger discussion of the cases where a h.l is found after an undefined antecedent, Sibawaihi argues that fdrisin in 'awwalu farisin is undefined in the same way that dirhaman is in 'ishrina dirhaman because both are really partitive expressions, viz. min al-fawSarisi and min al-dardhimi respectively. This argument is, of course, circular when compared with Sibawaihi's original use of 'awwalu rajulin/'awwalu 1-rijali to prove that 'ishrfina can be followed by undefined singular terms. (11) I, 274/235. The title of the chapter may best be left to speak for itself: ' Concerning that which takes dependent form because it is not part of the noun preceding it nor identical with it '. Here huwa jari bayta bayta, etc., are equated with 'anta 1-rajulu 'ilman (cf. above, no. (5)) and 'ishriina dirhaman. (12) I, 279/241. With something less than his usual plausibility Sibawaihi applies 'ishriina dirhaman to the occurrence of the dependent form after the 'five particles' 'inna, 'anna, l5kinna, layta, and la'alla. A whole series of similarities is found between 'inna, etc., and 'ishrfina along the lines of their partial resemblances to the verbs and the non-identity of the dependent terms which follow them. Almost the only point of substance here is the analysis of 'ishraina dirhaman into two units of which only 'ishriina is syntactically related to the rest of its context, while dirhaman merely serves as 'a single entity in explanation of the numeral': this is then applied, perhaps less successfully, to 'inna, etc. (13) I, 291/250. The interrogative kam is explained by a double analogy with 'ishriina: first kam is followed by dependent forms because they are not adjectives to kam nor syntactically correlated with it, second kam is only used to ask questions about number, hence it must be followed by the form appro- priate for numerals. This will be the dependent form (and not, for example, the oblique which occurs after other numerals) because kam is often separated from the term it affects, e.g. kam laka dirhaman?, to which the answer might be 'ishrina dirhaman. (14) I, 296/255. The other, predicative function of kam is also explained by reference to 'ishrina dirhaman but the analogy is only partial: this kam, like 'ishraina, is followed by undefined singular terms which explain or specify, and which are not syntactically correlated with their antecedents (i.e. in kam 'abdin laka id 'abdun wa-ld 'abddni ! the two nouns la 'abdun wa-ld 'abddni are co-ordinated with kam in its function of subject, not with 'abdin, which de- pends on kam). (15) i, 298/257. Expressions of degree, quantity, etc. (tamyiz), e.g. li mithluhu 'abdan, are compared with 'ishrina dirhaman in two respects: first the dependent term is explained as a lightened form of the partitive phrase with min, e.g. min al-'abidi, min al-dardhimi, and second the dependent term is neither an adjective to, nor part of its antecedent. Interestingly, Khalil</page><page sequence="9">'TWENTY DIRHAMS' IN THE KITAB OF SIBAWAIHI 493 offers the explanation that these dependent terms indicate 'what sort' ('ayyu naw'in) is meant by the antecedent, and also states that in mithluhu, etc., the second element of the annexation (al-mud f 'ilayhi) is equivalent to tanwin, thus preventing annexation and imposing the tanwin-nasb construction. We shall return to Khalil's contribution below, v. no. (22). (16) I, 303/261. The emphatic words 'ahadun, karrdbun, 'aramun, kati'un, etc., occur only after negation, when they are technically in apposition to their antecedent, e.g. md f7 1-ndsi mithluhu 'ahadun, md marartu bi-mithlika 'ahadin, etc. This time Sibawaihi points out the contrast with the syntax of 'ishrina dirhaman, for these emphatic words do not stand in the specifying relationship of dirhaman to 'ishrilna and, unlike dirhaman, they are syntactically correlated with their antecedent. (17) I, 307/266. Sibawaihi observes a difference between ' true ' annexation in vocative phrases such as yd dha, dha 1-jummati (the second dhd is the de- pendent form of dhii), and 'improper' annexation such as yd dha, 1-hasanu 1-wajhi (where al-hasanu is in the independent form). The reason is that the second term in an 'improper' annexation is merely something connected to the first in meaning (sabab) and in a specifying relationship to it, just like dirhaman and 'ishrlna, and can therefore be omitted, e.g. yd hddhd 1-hasanu, which is impossible in 'true' annexation. (18) I, 350/306. Probably because of the large part played by Khalil in this case, the function of tanwin is here interpreted radically differently from the way it is elsewhere in the Kitdb. Instead of treating it as a sign of morpho- logical completeness Khalil explains it as a sign of the incompleteness of iddriban in yd ddariban rajulan and of khlayran in ld khayran minhu laka, etc. Clearly it was felt that the connexion in meaning (sabab) between the two parts of a tanwin- nasb construction was here too strong to allow the second element to be omitted, and so Khalil theorizes that the tanwin in these instances serves to indicate that the phrase is not yet complete. It may well be that Sibawaihi himself was not certain whether these cases were covered by the arguments for 'ishrilna dirhaman for, although he volunteers the information that ld khayran minhu laka is equivalent to k 'ishiirna dirhaman laka, he seems to have felt like adding nothing more to Khalil's interpretation. (19) I, 360/315. After 'illd preceded by a positive verb (e.g. qdma l-qawmu 'illd Zaydan) the noun has dependent form because 'it is excluded from what the antecedent is included in, and the previous part of the utterance affects it in the same way that 'ishrana affects dirhaman '. (20) I, 363/318. The slightly unusual md marartu bi-'ahadin 'illa Zaydan (where we would expect Zaydin) is explained in much the same terms as above, viz. that Zaydan has been affected by the previous part of the utterance just as dirhaman is by 'ishrilna. le Sibawaihi has slipped here: he ought perhaps to have mentioned that it is only the gram- matical effect of 'ishriina upon dirhaman which is relevant, since the non-identity principle cannot possibly apply to Zaydan, who is the same as 'ahadin, cf. the next item.</page><page sequence="10">494 M. G. CARTER (21) I, 363/318. The Hij zi usage ma fihz 'ahadun 'illa himaran receives the same explanation as the previous case, with the added remark that the H.IijazIs are reluctant to say himarun, in apposition with 'ahadun, lest the two should appear to be ' of the same species ',17 a reservation evidently not shared by the less refined Tamimis. (22) I, 369/322. Once again the dependent form after 'illa is explained as in no. (19) above. This time Sibawaihi attributes the whole explanation to Khalil, which obliges us to consider how much of Sibawaihi's grammatical theory is original. Pending a full study of Khalil in the Kitib l8 it can at least be said with certainty that the master and the pupil reveal two equally profound but fundamentally different approaches to language. Taking the modern arrangement of linguistic analysis into phonology, morphology, and syntax as our guide, we might risk the generalization that Khalil was mainly interested in phonology and morphology, while Sibawaihi was overwhelmingly concerned with morphology and syntax. The evidence suggests that with Khalil the emphasis was largely on the composition of words and the establishment of word boundaries, especially such larger units as the annexation construction, which Khalil correctly identifies as functionally equivalent to a single word and structurally equivalent to the noun plus tanwin.19 Sibawaihi, on the other hand, was principally interested in words as components of sentences, as members (to reproduce his own metaphor) of a society in which the effects of their be- haviour could be judged by standards which in their original ethical context denoted good and bad (hasan, qabih) and right and wrong (mustaqim, muh.ul) and were adapted by Sibawaihi for the purely linguistic criteria of structural correctness and intelligibility. On this evidence it will be tentatively assumed that, irrespective of the borrowings and acknowledgments made by Sibawaihi, his must be the credit for conceiving and expounding the unified system of grammar of which we have been examining one particular manifestation.20 There remain a few items which were not dealt with above, which will show the extent to which Sibawaihi applied the principles embodied in 'ishrilna dirhaman without always invoking that specific phrase. For example, 'ishriina rajulan occurs as a locus probans twice (I, 302/261, 313/271) and once dirhaman alone (I, 297/256); the phrase ladun ghudwatan21 is found several times (I, 17 It would be unfortunate if readers of C. Rabin's Ancient Wemt-Arabian, London, 1951, 181, were to connect his expression 'logical category' with Sibawaihi's term naw' in this passage, as there is not the slightest reason to believe that Sibawaihi made use of logical categories in the Kitab or, indeed, knew of their existence. 1s The work of W. Reuschel, Al-Halll ibn-Ahmad, der Lehrer Sibawaihs, als Grammatiker, Berlin, Akademie-Verlag, 1959, if anything, makes it more difficult to separate the master from the pupil. 19 cf. p. 491, n. 13. 20 It is significant that Khalil plays almost no part in the argument around 'ig8hr.na dirhaman, being cited only twice in all five chapters (Bill., I, 84, 99; Der., I, 71, 81), and then only in a marginal capacity. 21 The structure of this phrase is unique, but it is clearly convenient to attach it to 'ishrfna dirhaman (which is what Sibawaihi does after discussing the numerals, Bill., I, 107; Der., I, 87).</page><page sequence="11">'TWENTY DIRHAMS' IN THE KITAB OF SIBAWAIHI 495 24/19, 28/22, 49/38, 79/68, 107/87, 389/341, 461/409 and 11, 145/147), occa- sionally in conjunction with 'ishrfina dirhaman but also in connexion with points of grammar unrelated to 'ishrana dirhaman, where it serves to justify a unique feature by its own uniqueness. Sometimes the principles exemplified by 'ishriina dirhaman are discussed without reference to that phrase: the non- identity principle (especially in ch. 129, I, 275/236 f., also I, 295/254), the ability of tanwin to prevent annexation (e.g. I, 295/254, 347/302), the notion of the tanwin as the mark of a complete utterance (e.g. I, 303/262). By now it should be apparent that Sibawaihi was a much more systematic and coherent thinker than his critics have hitherto allowed. The topic of 'ishrina dirhaman is a particularly good illustration because it is argued like a Euclidean theorem and then applied to a wide range of grammatical problems, so that it gives us at once an insight into Sibawaihi's techniques and a proof of their soundness. Regrettably the emphasis in Arabic grammar shifted very quickly from the speculative to the merely pedagogical,22 and in the reduction of Sibawaihi's theories to a canon of rules much was lost. The separative func- tion of tanwin, for example, which is so clearly brought out in the arguments for 'ishrina dirhaman, is never mentioned in discussions of tanwin by later gram- marians, who were certainly unaware that, for Sibawaihi at least, the tanwin- nasb construction was as much an identifiable type of syntactical unit as the more familiar ' true' annexation and subject-predicate constructions of Arabic. The non-identity principle, too, seems to have been passed over in favour of the notion of fadla (formal redundancy) 23 and the syntax of the numerals is sometimes treated as a variety of tamyiz, thus obscuring the general applicability of 'ishrina dirhaman to all tanwin-nasb situations. Western scholars have been known to misinterpret Sibawaihi through failing to take account of the significance of 'ish.r?na dirhaman: Jahn, for instance, would never have said of the sentence huwa ndrun humratan that 'narun must be taken in the meaning of a verb here, otherwise there could be no tamy~iz' if he had understood the purpose of 'ishriina dirhaman.24 It is also likely that Rabin, if he had taken notice of the principle of non-identity, would not have accused Sibawaihi of operating ' with logical categories which seem to have little bearing on the syntactical distinctions' between the dependent form of 'ilman in 'amma 'ilman fa-'dlimun and the independent form of al- 'abidu in 'amma l-'ab-ddufa-dhii 'ab;din.25 Sibawaihi makes the difference quite 22 With the outstanding exception of Ibn Jinni. 23 Along with the concept of fi'ida ' informativeness' and jumla (with its prescriptive con- notation of 'sentence '), fa4la is one of several terms generally regarded as typical of Arabic grammar which are not found anywhere in the Kitib: what interested Sibawaihi was 'good' (basan) and ' right' (mustaqfm) speech (kaldm). 24 N. 8 to ch. 110 in Jahn's Sibawaihi's Buch aiber die Grammatik, Berlin, 1895-1900, referring to Bill., I, 230; Der., I, 262. 25 Rabin, op. cit., 183-4, referring to Bill., I, 192-5; Der., I, 161-5. The same non-identity principle enables Sibawaihi to observe that 'in lahu sawtun sawtu bimarin you know very well that the voice of the donkey is not the same as the previous voice, but sawtu is allowed to be independent in form by latitude of speech (sa'atu 1-kaldm) ' (Bill., I, 182; Der., I, 152).</page><page sequence="12">496 'TWENTY DIRHAMS' IN THE KITAB OF SIBAWAIHI clear by taking a case in which either form is possible, viz. 'amma 1-'ilmu (or 1-'ilma) fa-'dlimun bi-l-'ilmi: the dependent form shows that ' you do not make the second term the same as the first' and is thus paraphrased as 'ammi 1-'ilma fa-'Ylimun bi-l-'ashyd'i, while the independent form shows that 'you make the first term the same as the last' and is therefore paraphrased as 'amm 1l-'ilmufa-'dlimun bihi. But these and similar oversights are merely the result of the critical preju- dice against Sibawaihi which stems either from an undue reliance on later Arab grammarians or from the lofty presumptions of the Hellenist. Our aim has been to allow Sibawaihi to plead his own cause in his own words. While no attempt has been made to conceal any naivetes or defects of his linguistic reasoning, it must also be emphasized that the above presentation scarcely does justice to the methods and achievements of Sibawaihi.26 26 Another attempt has been made by the present writer, and, it is hoped, will appear shortly under the title ' An Arab grammarian of the eighth century A.D.'.</page></plain_text>
