<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cognitive Science, Deco nst ruction, and (Post)Humanist (Non)Humans Cary Wolfe I want to begin with a story - a dog story, in fact. Its a story about a recent experiment in canine signifying abilities that appeared on 11 June, 2004 in my hometown newspaper, The Houston Chronicle , which was a reprint of an article that appeared that same day in The Washington Post , which in turn was about the lead article in the magazine Science for that same date. The Post story carried the title 'Common Collie or Uberpooch: German Pets Vocabulary Stuns Scientists'. But I prefer my hometown headline, 'Dogs May Be As Smart As Owners Think They Are, because it unwittingly directs us toward a question that I will insist is essential to addressing these kinds of issues, a question that definitively separates cognitive science (represented here by Daniel Dennett) and deconstruction (in the person, here, of Jacques Derrida): what language is and how it is related to questions of subjectivity, consciousness, intentions, emotions, and the ethical consequences that flow from all of these.1 And the question of language, in turn, cannot be addressed without pressuring our assumptions about what knowledge is - the kinds of knowledge we can have not just of ourselves but also of others: in this case, non-human others (represented here by the taxonomy canis fami liar iš) . It is tempting to call the question that divides cognitive science and deconstruction simply 'Theory', but in the current, supposedly post- theoretical' climate, this would only serve as a strategy of containment' (to borrow Fredric Jameson's handy phrase) which would render 'Theory' as a specialized set of epistemological obsessions carried out in a second-order, cosmetic operation, after the real work of cultural studies and historicism (whether New or Old) and the sociology of knowledge is over with, and we have nothing better to do than sit around and ask, 'what do we really mean when we say "dog" '? So let me be more specific: the issue that separates cognitive science and deconstruction is, as we shall see, one that goes all the way down,</page><page sequence="2">104 Oxford Literary Review both epistemologically and ethically: whether or not knowledge - including knowledge of our own subjectivity and that of others - can be representational and, following hard on the heels of that question, how we may construe the relationship between epistemological and ontological questions. Part of what I will be trying to bring out in what follows is that this apparently epistemological quibble is far from purely epistemological; indeed, I want to suggest that understanding its full implications is crucial to our ability to think about non-human subjects in a rigorous and clear-headed way - a contention whose irony will emerge here in due course, I trust, because cognitive science typically reserves for itself the mantel, precisely, of rigor and clear-headedness (as 'scientific' discourses are wont to do), while the charge of paradoxical incoherence and/or conceptual static is typically laid at the feet of deconstruction (with John Searles response to Derridas critique of J.L. Austin in 'Signature Event Context' being only the most well-known example). To put it telegraphically, then, I will be arguing that, paradoxically, the only way to represent non-human subjectivity (or ¿7/^ subjectivity) is to be anti-representational, and (a corollary) the only way to address the ontology of non-human beings (or any beings) is to be post-ontological. It is precisely with these concerns in mind that I have chosen to discuss the work of Daniel Dennett, because it is often regarded as a more philosophically attuned version of the 'functionalism' that is a central feature of cognitive science generally, and that is therefore taken to be resolutely post-ontological and post-representational in precisely this way. Dennett's work thus presents itself as a less reductive and more nuanced version of what Terrence Deacon, in The Symbolic Species , characterizes as materialistic reductionism', which offers in theories of mind and consciousness 'the dominant alternative to the Cartesian perspective'. It is exemplified,' he writes, 'by the theoretical claim that the mind is like the sort of "computation" that takes place in electronic computers. In simpler terms, minds are software (programs) run on the hardware (neural circuits) of the brain'. The 'strong' version of this claim (or the weakest, depending on your point of view) is called 'eliminative materialism', which holds that 'notions such as mind, intention, belief, thought, representation, and so on will eventually be eliminated in discussions of cognitive processes in favor or more mechanistic synonyms that refer to chemical-electrical signaling</page><page sequence="3">Cary Wolfe 105 processes of the brain. Mentalistic terms, it is suggested, are merely glosses for more complex brain processes that we at present do not understand'.2 With those contexts in mind, let us return to the story of Rico the Uberpooch (if indeed he is one). According to the various reports, this nine year old Border Collie living in Germany with his human companions has recently been shown in a series of careful studies' carried out by Julia Fischer, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, to have a stunningly large vocabulary of about 200 words' that correspond to a collection of toys, balls, and the like, a range comparable to that of great apes, dolphins, and parrots who have undergone extensive training in language experiments.3 In these experiments, Rico and his owner were placed in one room, while ten of the dog's toys were placed in another. The dog was then instructed by his owner to retrieve two randomly selected objects named by the owner, while the owner remained secluded in the separate room to avoid any chance of Clever Hans activity. In forty tests, Rico was accurate thirty-seven times. Even more impressively, in the next phase of the study, the researchers put seven of his toys in the room along with one he had never seen before. The owner then called out the unfamiliar name of the new toy, and Rico was correct in seven out of ten tries. Finally, in the last phase, researchers tested Rico a month later, and he still remembered the name of the new toy three out of six times without having seen it since the first test - a rate of success equivalent to that of a human three-year old.4 The key finding of the study, we are told, is that Rico is apparently capable of a process called 'fast mapping' - an ability to instantly assign a meaning to a new word, a strategy human toddlers use to learn language at a prodigious rate, and a skill thought to be exclusively the province of humans. Rico apparently can do something scientists thought only humans could do: figure out by process of elimination that a sound he has never heard before must be the name of a toy he has never seen before'.5 According to the authors of the study, all of this suggests 'that mammals developed abilities to understand sounds before humans learned to speak',6 and Rico's remarkable learning abilities may indicate that some parts of speech comprehension developed separately from human speech'.7 'You don't have to be able to talk to understand',</page><page sequence="4">106 Oxford Literary Review Dr. Fischer observes. And Sue Savage-Rumbaugh - whose language acquisition work at Georgia State University with the Bonobo Kanzi is well-known - goes even further in a commentary published in the same issue of Science , suggesting that 'If Rico had a human vocal tract, one would presume that he should be able to say the names of the items as well, or at least try to do so'.8 Of course, we might well add to this appendix of scientific commentary that appears alongside the publication of the study in Science the remarks of Dennett himself (Director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University), whose books Consciousness Explained and Kinds of Minds: Toward an Understanding of Consciousness would seem to shed light not only on what we have discovered here about the cognitive abilities and mental life of our Uberpooch, but also on the ethical implications thereof. Indeed, from Dennetts point of view, it is hard to overstate how much it matters, in ethical terms, that we are able to be as specific as possible about the cognition and consciousness of particular beings. 'What makes a mind powerful', he writes, 'indeed, what makes a mind conscious - is not what it is made of, or how big it is, but what it can do. Can it concentrate? Can it be distracted? Can it recall earlier events? . . . When such questions as these are answered, we will know everything we need to know about those minds in order to answer the morally important questions.9 As Dennett puts it, 'Membership in the class of things that have minds provides an all-important guarantee: the guarantee of a certain sort of moral standing. Only mind-havers can care; only mind- havers can mind what happens.10 As I have already suggested, Dennetts functionalist approach to questions such as what is a mind-haver?' - not what is it?' but what can it do?' - is perhaps what he is best known for, but what I want to argue now is that Dennett's apparent functionalism and materialism are unable to escape the spell of the very philosophical tradition (whose most extreme expression is Cartesian idealism) that he supposedly rejects. In Kinds of Minds and, indeed, throughout his work, Dennett rightly rejects the idea that some central Agent or Boss or Audience'11 - what he also sometimes calls a 'Cartesian puppeteer'12 - takes in and ' appreciates the information produced by the neural networks and uses it to 'steer the ship' of subjectivity.13 In what he debunks as 'the Myth of Double Transduction', the nervous system</page><page sequence="5">Cary Wolfe 107 first transduces input from its environment (light, sound, temperature, etc.) into neural signals, and then, in a second moment, 'in some special central place, it transduces these trains of impulses into some other medium, the medium of consciousness!'14 'The idea that the network itself could assume the role of the inner Boss and thus harbor consciousness seems preposterous', he continues, but that is exactly what happens, he argues, in the distributed networks in both brain and body from which consciousness arises.15 To ask for something more - to assume that what you are is something else&gt; some Cartesian res cogitans in addition to all this brain-and-body activity' - is to 'betray a deep confusion because what you are 'just is this organization of all the competitive activity between a host of competences that your body has developed'.16 To ask for more' is to remain captive to what he calls 'the Cartesian theater', the specter of a disembodied, free-floating central knower' or self' who stands aside from and above these processes, at once the product and appreciator of them. Dennett's apparently robust, materialist account of embodied consciousness and mentation, buttressed by an impressive under- standing of neural networks, evolutionary processes, perceptual mech- anisms and the like, would seem to find an apt accompaniment in an understanding of language within the context of a larger prosthetics of signifying systems in all their technicity and exteriority, one that would seem quite consonant with contemporary theorists in the humanities and social sciences from Derrida and Kittler to Bateson and Luh- mann.17 The source of our greater intelligence when compared to our mammalian relatives, he argues, is not the size of our brains but rather our habit of off-loading as much as possible of our cognitive tasks into the environment itself - extruding our minds (that is, our mental projects and activities) into the surrounding world, where a host of peripheral devices we construct can store, process, and re-present our meanings, streamlining, enhancing, and protecting the processes of transformation that are our thinking' - a process that 'releases us from the limitations of our animal brains'.18 And 'thanks to our prosthetically enhanced imaginations', he continues, 'we can formulate otherwise imponderable, unnoticeable metaphysical possibilities'.19 But the problem with Dennett's formulation is that it is not at all clear how such prosthetic processes and devices can be said to constitute - to 'store, process, and re-presenť (in Dennett's words) - 'our'</page><page sequence="6">108 Oxford Literary Review thinking. After all, if we pay attention to the material, social, technical, and cultural complexities of such devices, in what sense can the internal psychic states Dennett calls our thinking be said to be 're-presented' by such devices? This would seem to be obviously the case not just for archival and storage devices of all types (from books to systems using binary coding) and the institutional and disciplinary contexts in which they are embedded, but also, more importantly, for that very first and most fundamental prosthesis of all: language itself. Language cannot be said to 're-present' our thinking for at least two reasons. First, as Niklas Luhmann has put it (with characteristic astringency), language, like all forms of communication, operates with an unspecific reference to the participating state of mind; it is especially unspecific as to perception. It cannot copy states of mind, cannot imitate them, cannot represent them.'20 And second, there can be no 're-presentation of 'our thinking in language because the meaning of an utterance, in addition to being diacritically produced, is always subject to differential interpretation, which itself takes place within multiply embedded protocols, traditions, conventions, and so on. (If this weren't the case, then it would be a private language, and we couldn't use it to communicate 'our' thinking at all, which in turn underlines an important paradox: 'our' thinking can be ours only if it isn't 'ours'.) All of which - as David Wills has reminded us in multiple registers (in his wonderful book Prosthesis, and elsewhere) - is built in to the very logic of the prosthetic itself.21 As Wills puts it, we are dealing here with technologies 'of the exteriorization of memory of which writing is a, if not the, fundamental historically identifiable form'. And this has serious consequences for how we think about 'subjectivity', because 'technology, in these terms, is the extemporization, the movement out of self-presence that permits and defines memory', a 'prosthetization of the animate or the human' that not only makes it difficult to rigorously 'distinguish the human from its inanimate other', but also makes us 'forever removed from ourselves' as the very condition of what it means to be human.22 But the primary problem with Dennett, as we are about to see, is not just that he overlooks how the prosthetic nature of the human permanently destabilizes the boundaries between 'our' thinking and anyone - or more radically, any thing - else's. It is that he also, in a subsidiary move, relies upon a fundamentally representationalist</page><page sequence="7">Cary Wolfe 109 concept of language that reinstalls the disembodied Cartesian subject at the very heart of his supposedly embodied, materialist functionalism. And it is on this basis, in turn, that the ontologically unique status of 'the human - and all the ethical consequences that flow from it - is established in Dennetts work. Few would argue with Dennetts observation that 'there is no step more uplifting, more explosive, more momentous in the history of mind design that the invention of language', through which Homo sapiens stepped into a slingshot that has launched it far beyond all other earthly species in the power to look ahead and reflect'.23 But we begin to glimpse the problem with Dennett's theory in passages like the following: 'The free- floating rationales that explain rudimentary higher-order intentionality of birds and hares - and even chimpanzees - are honored', he writes, 'in the designs of their nervous systems, but we are looking for something more: we are looking for rationales that are represented in those nervous systems'.24 The problem here is not - as he argues in an essay contemporaneous with Kinds of Minds , entitled 'Animal Consciousness: What Matters and Why - Dennett's insistence that we should be 'analyzing patterns of behavior (external and internal - but not "private"), and attempting to interpret them in the light of evolutionary hypotheses regarding their past or current functions'.25 The problem is rather that this 'something more' turns out to be another version of the very 'user-illusion' that Dennett wants to reject - a 'user-illusion' provided by Dennett's misunderstanding of language as something that can 'represent rationales in a nervous system', as he puts it. I want to pause for a moment here to emphasize, however briefly, that this theoretical deficit about language (and the resultant blindness toward the consequences that flow from it) is not just Dennetts problem; indeed, it is a common feature of work in and around cognitive science, and I find it even in work that I otherwise admire. Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, for example, offer an extremely valuable account of the evolutionary emergence of language proper from the broader context of 'linguistic domains' - an account that reaches back to Gregory Bateson's important work on 'meta- communicative frames' in mammalian communication (especially in forms of 'play'), and forward to the very latest investigations in these areas by Noam Chomsky, Marc Hauser, and others that I will be</page><page sequence="8">110 Oxford Literary Review referencing in a moment.26 Maturana and Varela rightly conclude, on the basis of experimental evidence, that some non-human animals are capable of interacting with us in rich and even recursive linguistic domains', and they affirm that the bulk of research suggests that language remains a permanent biologic possibility in the natural drift of living beings . 27 But even though it is certainly useful (to combine their language now with Batesons) to distinguish participation in a meta-communicative frame ('linguistic domains ) from the meta-meta- communicative frame that is language proper - the ability to make a linguistic distinction of a linguistic distinction, as they put it28 - it is extremely problematic, indeed (strictly speaking) theoretically untenable, to make the ontological category of subjectivity depend solely on this last attribute. For to declare, as Maturana and Varela do, that self-consciousness, awareness, mind - these are phenomena that take place in language'29, is to make a statement that, if it is true, is self-refuting (since, as Luhmann would put it, only language takes place in language - which is to say, in a domain external to the self' of self-consciousness') . Similarly, Gerald Edelman's work on these questions is both sophisticated and, at crucial junctures, underdeveloped. On the one hand, he argues that concepts, in our view, precede language, which develops by epigenetic means to further enhance our conceptual and emotional exchanges'.30 And this means that even in an animal without language, once its nervous system can carry out perceptual categorization and develop conceptual memory, a huge set of possible actions open up .... The dynamic, temporally ongoing, bootstrap between a value-category memory and perceptual categorization reflects an individual history, one illuminated at each moment by a remembered present - what Edelman calls primary consciousness, mental life l'.31 On the other hand, 'With the emergence of higher order consciousness through language, there is a consciously explicit coupling of feelings and value, yielding emotions with cognitive components that are experienced by a person - a self .... A true subjectivity emerges with narrative and metaphorical powers and concepts of self and of past</page><page sequence="9">Cary Wolfe 111 and future.32 So while a nonlinguistic animal can have a mental life', Edelman concludes, 'that life is necessarily a restricted one because the animal lacks a self concept. Although such an animal has a unique mental history, it is not a subject - a self who is able to be conscious of being conscious - what Edleman calls mental life 2'. 33 But this last distinction depends directly on the representationalist view of language we have already touched on. In Edelmans words, such an animal has biological individuality but has no true self, a self aware of itself. Although it has a "remembered present" ... it has no concept of the past or future. These concepts emerged only when semantic capabilities - the ability to express feelings and refer to objects and events by symbolic means - appeared in the course of evolution (194), in which speech allowed reference to inner states and objects or events by means of symbols.34 We find a similar formulation in Dennett. He argues that cthe sort of informational unification that is the most important prerequisite for our kind of consciousness is not anything we are born with, not part of our innate "hard- wiring," but in surprisingly large measure is an artifact of our immersion in human culture.' So far, so good. But then his argument takes a bizarre turn indeed: What that early education produces in us is a sort of benign user-illusion - I call it the Cartesian Theater: the illusion that there is a place in our brains where the show goes on, towards which all perceptual 'input' streams, whence flow all conscious intentions to act and speak. I claim that other species-and human beings when they are newborn - simply are not beset by the illusion of the Cartesian Theater. Until the organization is formed, there is simply no user in there to be fooled.35 But how, one might ask, is this really any different from the Cartesianism Dennett rejects, particularly when we remember his insistence above on the difference between 'the free-floating rationales that explain rudimentary higher-order intentionality of birds and hares' that are merely a product of ťthe designs of their nervous systems' and the 'something more' of human intentionality and consciousness, 'rationales that are represented in those nervous systems'?</page><page sequence="10">112 Oxford Literary Review Consider, for example, the tortured trajectory of the following argument: 'Many animals hide but don't think they are hiding. Many animals flock but don't think they are flocking';36 they have 'know- how', Dennett argues, but not 'represented knowledge'. Eventually, some creatures began off-loading problems into the world, and just into other parts of their brains. They began making and using representations, but they didn't know they were doing so. They didn't need to know. Should we call this sort of unwitting use of representations 'thinking'? If so, then we would have to say that these creatures were thinking, but didn't know they were thinking! Unconscious thinking - those with a taste for 'paradoxical' formulations might favor this way of speaking, but we could less misleadingly say that this was intelligent but unthinking behavior, because it was not just not reflective but also not reflectable-upon.37 (154). But the problem here is that 'reflectable-upon' behavior and 'represented knowledge' in Dennett's scheme are dependent upon the assumption that language can provide, by means of a grammatical fiction, the very 'user-illusion' that Dennett has just disavowed. And doubly problematic is that this phenomenological restabilization of the subject by means of language constitutes not just an 'illusion,' but immediately turns into the very invention of the subject, forming the ontological specificity of the human itself, one that is no different in principle or function from the Cartesianism Dennett rejects. Only here, 'language' is doing the work previously carried out by the Cartesian 'cogito'. As an example of such 'intelligent but unthinking' behavior, Dennett offers the 'distraction display' among some species of low-nesting birds, who, when predators approach their nest, put on an ostentatious show of feigned injury, captivating the predator's attention and promising an easy kill that the predator, now drawn away from the vulnerable eggs, is never quite able to make.38 Such behaviors among non-human animals are quite abundant and well-known, but none of them, Dennett argues,</page><page sequence="11">Cary Wolfe 113 manifests what he calls the workings of a 'third-order intentional system': An important step toward becoming a person was the step up from a first-order intentional system to a second- order intentional system. A first-order intentional system has beliefs and desires about many things, but not about beliefs and desires. A second-order intentional system has beliefs and desires about beliefs and desires, its own or those of others. A third-order intentional system would be capable of such feats as wanting you to believe that it wanted something.39 If this has a familiar ring to it, it should, because it is exactly the strategy that Jacques Lacan famously uses - in his essay of 1960, 'The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious' - to juridically separate the human from the animal as that being, alone among the living, who can lie by telling the truths The animal, in Lacan's terms, can pretend, but not pretend to pretend- only the human, as 'subject of the signifier', can do that. As Derrida summarizes Lacan's argument - and here the distance between Dennett's discourse and Lacan's will become absolutely minimal - There is, according to Lacan, a clear distinction between what the animal is capable of, namely, strategic pretense . . . and what it is incapable of and incapable of witnessing to, namely, the deception of speech [la tromperie de la parole[ within the order of the signifier and of Truth. The deception of speech . . . involves lying to the extent that, in promising what is true, it includes the supplementary possibility of telling the truth in order to lead the other astray, on order to have him believe something other than what is true (we know the Jewish story recounted by Freud and so often quoted by Lacan: 'Why do you tell me that you are going to X in order to have me believe you are going to Y whereas you are indeed going to X?'). According to Lacan, the animal would be incapable of this type of lie, of this deceit, of this pretense in the second degree, whereas the 'subject of the</page><page sequence="12">114 Oxford Literary Review signifier , within the human order, would possess such a power and, better still, would emerge as subject, instituting itself and coming to itself as subject by virtue of this powery a second-degree reflexive power, a power that is conscious of being able to deceive by pretending to pretend.41 As I have already suggested, one of the ironies of Dennetts discourse is that even as it promises a rigorous, clear-headed view of these complexities - 'Don't confuse ontological questions (about what exists) with epistemological questions (about how we know about it)!' we are admonished in the opening pages of Kinds of Minds*1 - it reproduces in detail the Cartesian position it claims to move beyond. And it does so, moreover, precisely because it is unwilling or unable to pursue the full implications of the paradoxical formulations' (such as 'intelligent but unthinking behavior') that it refuses to fully think through. As Derrida's later work makes clear, that Cartesianism rests on two fundamental points: l)the assertion that animals, however sophisticated they may be, can only 'react' but not 'respond' to what goes on around them. And this is so because 2)the capacity to 'respond' depends upon the ability to wield concepts or representations, which is in turn possible only on the basis of language - and this, exactly in the sense voiced by Dennett when he writes, 'No matter how close a dog's "concept" of cat is to yours extensionally (you and the dog discriminate the same sets of entities as cats and noncats), it differs radically in one way: the dog cannot consider its concept .... [N]o languageless mammal can have a concept of snow in the way we can, because a languageless mammal has no way of considering snow "in general" or "in itself" '43 Two points need to be registered here - one experimental or scientific, if you like, and one philosophical. First, as Donna Haraway points out in When Species Meet, the entire picture of language and non-human mental life has become considerably more complicated than this during the past several years. Indeed, even Noam Chomsky (of all people) has recently argued, in a paper co-authored with two Harvard researchers, that 'the available data suggests a much stronger continuity between animals and humans with respect to speech that previously believed.' Chomsky and his colleagues argue 'that the continuity hypothesis thus deserves the status of a null</page><page sequence="13">Cary Wolfe 115 hypothesis, which much be rejected by comparative work before any claims of uniqueness can be validated. For now,' they conclude, this null hypothesis of no truly novel traits in the speech domain appears to stand.'44 This conclusion is based in no small part on the their contention that even if we distinguish between language in the broad sense (along the lines of Maturana and Varelas 'linguistic domains' which involve various sensori-motor and cognitive subsystems with their own evolutionary histories, purposes, and outcomes) and language in a more narrow sense (the recursive ability to 'generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements', as Chomsky and his colleagues write), the uniqueness of human linguistic abilities must be a testable hypothesis, not an assumption rooted in premises of human exceptionalism' (as Haraway puts it).45 In fact, most of the recent experimental data does not suggest an unquestioned exceptionalism. And this is not surprising when we realize that key capacities in language ability (in the narrow sense) such as the ability to generate 'discrete infinity' very likely evolved, as Haraway puts it, 'in domains other than communication (such as territory mapping, spatial navigation, and foraging)', and only later become 'hijacked for communication in ways uncoupled from tight constraints of function'.46 And this realization, of course, has profound implications for the ontological - and eventually, ethical - status of non-human beings, for it leads us to separate the problem of language ability in the limited sense from the phenomenological question of subjectivity, rather than assimilate the latter to the former, as Dennett has done. As Haraway puts it (drawing on the work of Marc Hauser, one of Chomsky's co-authors in the study just cited) this most recent work suggests that 'organisms possess heterogeneous sets of mental tools, complexly and dynamically put together from genetic, developmental, and learning interactions throughout their lives, not unitary interiors that one either has or does not have'.47 And this, in turn, leads me to my second point, the philosophical one: that Dennett's supposedly hard-nosed, materialist account of embodied consciousness falls in line not just with the philosophical idealism of Descartes but also of Heidegger, whose characterization of the animal as that which 'has a world in the mode of not- having' depends, as Derrida argues in Of Spirit^ on the inability of the animal to 'have access to entities as such and in their Being'</page><page sequence="14">116 Oxford Literary Review because of a lack of language which is not primarily or simply linguistic', but rather, as Derrida puts it, 'derives from the properly phenomenological impossibility of speaking the phenomenon.48 In light of Derridas critique, then, Dennetts discourse takes its place in a long line of philosophers from Aristotle to Lacan, Kant, Heidegger, and Lévinas, all of whom, as he puts it, say the same thing: the animal is without language. Or more precisely unable to respond, to respond with a response that could be precisely and rigorously distinguished from a reaction.49 'Even those who, from Descartes to Lacan, have conceded to the said animal some aptitude for signs and for communication , Derrida continues, 'have always denied it the power to respond - to pretend, to lie, to cover its tracks or erase its own traces' - hence the fallback position we find here in Dennett and Lacan, when more explicitly metaphysical versions of humanism are no longer available: the difference between communication and metacommunication , signifying and signifying about signifying, thinking and knowing you're thinking, and so on.50 But the problem with this position, as Derrida points out, is that 'it seems difficult in the first place to identify or determine a limit, that is to say an indivisible threshold between pretense and pretense of pretense'. 'How could one distinguish', he continues, for example in the most elementary sexual parade or mating game, between a feint and a feint of a feint? If it is impossible to provide the criterion for such a distinction, one can conclude that every pretense of pretense remains a simple pretense (animal or imaginary, in Lacan's terms), or else, on the contrary, and just as likely, the every pretense, however simple it may be, gets repeated and reposited undecidably, in its possibility, as pretense of pretense (human or symbolic in Lacan's terms) .... Pretense presupposes taking the other into account; it therefore supposes, simultaneously, the pretense of pretense - a simple supplementary move by the other within the strategy of the game. That supplementarity is at work from the moment of the first pretense.51 And the distinction between the inscription of the trace and its erasure as the means by which to juridically separate the human from</page><page sequence="15">Cary Wolfe 117 animal fares no better. As Derrida argues in that same essay - "and this is why so long ago I substituted the concept of trace for that of signifier', he begins by saying - the structure of the trace presupposes that to trace amounts to erasing a trace as much as to imprinting it ... . How can it be denied that the simple substitution of one trace for another, the marking of their diacritical difference in the most elementary inscription - which capacity Lacan concedes to the animal - involves erasure as much as it involves the imprint? It is as difficult to assign a frontier between pretense and pretense of pretense, to have an indivisible line pass through the middle of a feigned feint, as it is to assign one between inscription and erasure of the trace.52 The point here, Derrida argues - and this is the properly post-humanist heart of the matter - is '1 ess a matter of asking whether one has the right to refuse the animal such and such a power . . . than of asking whether what calls itself human has the right to rigorously attribute to man . . . what he refuses the animal, and whether he can ever possess the pure^ rigorous , indivisible concept, as such, of that attribution. Thus, were we even to suppose - something I am not ready to concede - that the animal' were incapable of covering its tracks, by what right could one concede that power to the human, to the "subject of the signifier"?'53 What Derrida helps us to see - and we can only see it if we have the 'taste for "paradoxical" formulations' that Dennett suggests we abjure - is that just because a particular discourse operates within parameters and conventions that we think of as scientific' (or, in a somewhat more familiar register, presents itself as a materialist rendering of the problem of consciousness as an embodied phenomenon) that does not mean that such a discourse is not metaphysical. For such a discourse, language appears as a rather unimportant, second-order phenomenon whose job is to be as transparent as possible to the concepts (and beyond that, the objects) they represent (which is why the eventual goal for materialistic reductionism' can be to eliminate it all together). At the same time, oddly enough, this apparently insubstantial thing called language constitutes the phenomenological and indeed ontological and ethical</page><page sequence="16">118 Oxford Literary Review divide between human and non-human subjectivity; paradoxically, it constitutes the phenomenological specificity of the very being who then, in an idealist move if ever there was one, rises above it to deploy it literally at will - or, in Dennetts terms, by 'intention. From this vantage point, what Derrida writes about J. L. Austin and speech act theory in 'Signature Event Context' applies even more pointedly to the recovery and maintenance of a very familiar form of humanism in Dennett, of the subject as what Derrida calls a free consciousness present to the totality of the operation, and of absolutely meaningful speech 'vouloir-dire | master of itself: the teleological jurisdiction of an entire field whose organizing center remains intention - an intention that expresses itself, for instance, in the difference between pretending and pretending to pretend, thinking and knowing you're thinking, and so on.54 And this, as I've already suggested, has far-reaching consequences for the 'rigor' and objectivity' of the knowledge that we think we can have of ourselves and of other, non-human beings, a rigor and objectivity that analytical philosophy and cognitive science have typically reserved for themselves over and against the merely epistemological' quandaries of continental philosophy in general and post-structuralist thought in particular. For as Derrida points out, 'it is not certain that what we call language or speech acts can ever be exhaustively determined by an objective science or theory'; indeed, 'it is more "scientific" to take this limit . . . into account and to treat it as a point of departure for rethinking this or that received concept of "science" and of "objectivity" '55 Now all of this might be viewed as 'merely theoretical', if you like, were it not for the fact that Dennett himself insists that the ethical stakes of determining which creatures have minds - a determination that depends, in turn, on a quite specific relation to language - are dire indeed. On the one hand, Dennett argues that 'the ethical course is to err on the side overattribution, just to be safe' when considering the possibility of non-human minds, because the ethical consequences of being overly cautious and then later being found wrong could be grave.56 At the same time, however, he writes: "'It may not be able to talk, but surely it thinks!" - one of the main aims of this book has been to shake your confidence in this familiar reaction'.57 But because a deeply flawed theory of 'talking' is central to a representationalist notion of 'thinking' in Dennett s work, and because only things that</page><page sequence="17">Cary Wolfe 119 think (that is to say, both think and know they are thinking) have minds, and because only things that have minds (and, we might add, know they have minds!) warrant ethical consideration, Dennett is forced to embrace ethical implications that, despite his generous gestures to the contrary, would seem to run directly counter to the supposed point of his entire project, which is, of course, to take seriously the status - epistemologically and ethically - of different 'kinds of minds. Take, for example, Dennetts rendering of the difference between pain and suffering, which unwittingly reproduces the very Cartesianism that Dennett has time and again declared the enemy. He writes that we might well think that the capacity for suffering counts for more, in any moral calculations, than the capacity for abstruse and sophisticated reasoning.58 But on this point, Dennett follows Descartes almost to the letter. Descartes - who is often misunderstood on this point - insisted not that animals do not feel those sensations we call pain, but only that they do not experience them as suffering because there is no one home', no subject of the cogito to do the experiencing; and thus, the pain is not morally relevant.59 Similarly, Dennett argues that 'for such states to matter - whether or not we call them pains, or conscious states, or experiences - there must be an enduring subject to whom they matter because they are a source of suffering'.60 My point here, of course, is not that human and non-human animals all experience the same kinds or levels of suffering; even the most ardent animal rights philosophers, such as Peter Singer, agree that they do not. My point is that the difference between pain and suffering' in Dennett turns out to be not just a difference in degree but a difference in kind, an ontological difference, and one that simply reproduces on another level the difference between thinking and knowing you're thinking, having thoughts and having represented thoughts, and so on. The problem, in other words, is with the unwitting Cartesianism of Dennett's enduring subject', which in turn leads him (not surprisingly) to embrace ethical conclusions that should, I think, give us pause. For example, when Dennett attempts to draw out the consequences of his contention that 'human consciousness. . . is a necessary condition for serious suffering', he ends up suggesting that a dissociated child does not suffer as much as a non-dissociated child'.61 And just as different forms of being human in the world are rewritten, as they are here,</page><page sequence="18">120 Oxford Literary Review in terms of a homogeneous Cartesian ideal, /z¿?/z-human beings, in all their diversity, are now rendered not as fully complete forms of life that are radically irreducible to a thin, idealized account of what counts as subjectivity', but rather as diminished versions of that fantasy figure called 'the human, of the Cartesian cogito now rewritten as the 'user- illusion qua enduring subject'. Non-human animals are now seen as creatures that are naturally dissociated - that never achieve, or even attempt to achieve, the sort of complex internal organization that is standard in a normal child and disrupted in a dissociated child'.62 The problem here is not the ethical foregrounding of pain and suffering (though this surely does not exhaust, and may even distract us from, the breadth of ethical issues attending our obligations to non-human animals).63 The problem is that Dennetts ontological distinction between pain and suffering is based upon a set of phantom abilities, themselves anchored by a certain representationalist understanding of language, that no subject, either non-human or human, possesses in truth. We can get an even sharper sense of this by reference to Derridas very different approach to the question of non-human suffering, which sets out, oddly enough, from utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham (it is odd not least because Bentham is central to the animal rights philosophy of Peter Singer). The relevant question here, Bentham asserts, is not can they talk', or can they reason', but can they suffer ?' For Derrida, putting the question in this way changes everything', because 'from Aristotle to Descartes, from Descartes, especially, to Heidegger, Lévinas and Lacan - and, we might add, to Dennett - posing the question of the animal in terms of either the capacity for thought or language 'determines so many others concerning power or capability 'pouvoirs' , and attributes [avoirs]: being able, having the power to give, to die, to bury ones dead, to dress, to work, to invent a technique'.64 What makes Bentham's reframing of the problem so powerful is that now, 'The question is disturbed by a certain passivity ... a not-being-able'. 'What of the vulnerability felt on the basis of this inability?' he continues; 'what is this non-power at the heart of power? . . . What right should be accorded it? To what extent does it concern us?' It concerns us very directly, in fact, for 'mortality resides there, as the most radical means of thinking the finitude that we share with animals, the mortality that belongs to the very finitude of</page><page sequence="19">Cary Wolfe 121 life, to the experience of compassion, to the possibility of sharing the possibility of this non-power.65 From this vantage - to return now to the story with which we began - we can derive from the exploits of Rico the Uberpooch an unexpected lesson whose ethical as well as epistemological resonance we are now in a position to appreciate: that even though thinking about the consciousness, intelligence, and emotional and mental lives of non- human animals in terms of their linguistic abilities has historically been a crucial means for getting such questions on the table at ak I66 it may not be the best way, and it is certainly not the only way, of approaching these questions. From this vantage, Rico s prodigious signifying abilities may be only one sign among many others - and only the one most readily legible to us, as language-dependent creatures - of a thinking (if that's what we want to call it) that we ought to be interested in not because it is a diminished or dim approximation of ours, but because it is part of a very different way of being in the world that calls upon us to rethink, ever anew and vigilantly so, what we mean by person , mind', consciousness' - that entire cluster of terms and the implications that flow from them. In this light, as Derrida suggests, 'It would not be a matter of "giving speech back" to animals, but perhaps of acceding to a thinking, however fabulous and chimerical it might be, that thinks the absence of the name and of the word otherwise, as something other than a privation.67 What I am suggesting here, then, is that your theory of language matters, and it matters not just epistemologically or theoretically because all sorts of consequences, both ontological and ethical, flow from it. But I am also suggesting that there is an interdisciplinary imperative we need to undertake when addressing such complex questions. For if it is true that cognitive science has an enormous amount to contribute to the area of philosophy that we used to call phenomenology - if it has even, in a way, taken it over - then it is also true that the textually-oriented (post)humanities have much to teach cognitive science about what language is (and isn't), and how that, in turn, bears upon any possible philosophy of the subject (human or animal). This is simply to say that it will take all hands on deck, I think, to fully comprehend what amounts to a new reality: that the (post) human occupies a new place in the universe, a universe</page><page sequence="20">122 Oxford Literary Review now populated by what I am prepared to call non-human subjects. And this is why posthumanism means, to me, not the triumphant surpassing of the encumbrances and overdeterminations of our bodies, our technologies, and our prosthetic dependencies - the biological and technological facts of our multiply configured existence - but rather an increase in the vigilance, responsibility, and humility and accompanies living in a world so newly, and differently, inhabited.

Though I cannot make the argument within the confines of this essay, I would suggest that Deacons work is, if anything, more Cartesian than Dennetts. This become clear in the final chapter of the text which, even as it attempts to argue for a substantial continuity between the mental lives and human and non-human animals, reinstates, via the terms 'representation' and 'experience', the quintessentially Cartesian distinction upon which we will see Dennett run aground in a moment - namely, the distinction between sensations and the experience of sensations (which is possible only for beings who operate with symbolic representations) that anchors Descartes infamous position on the ethical irrelevance of pain in non-human animals. See in particular Deacon, pp. 448-450, where we find such question-begging formulations as the following: 'We live most of our concrete lives in the subjective realm that is also shared with other species, but our experience of this world is embedded in the vastly more extensive symbolic world' (p. 450).
