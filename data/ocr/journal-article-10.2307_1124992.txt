<plain_text><page sequence="1">rke Criticism Of reek rraedy By WILLIAM ARROWSMITH MY purpose here is to do a little superstitious rapping in the hope of persuading into existence something a little different in the kind of criticism we normally bring to bear upon Greek tragedy. If this seems pretentious, blame the subject in part: Greek tragedy requires, I think, a formidable apparition by way of an adequate criticism and certainly a larger one than I can summon up, though also a larger one than presently attends the scene. What I want to do is to outline the nature of the job to be done, as I see it, and to discuss what seems to me inadequate in both the tradi- tional and contemporary ways of writing about Greek tragedy. I think I see-though vaguely-the kind of criticism to which Greek tragedy points, though I recognize that this may turn out to be merely a mirage made up to answer imaginary needs, or an old familiar ghost in a new murk, or even something that con- cerns no one but students of Greek tragedy. Whatever the results, I am convinced that the need is real; that we have reached some kind of impasse in the study of Greek tragedy in which neither the older nor the newer criticism, nor any compromise between them, is really adequate; and further, that the need is general. Impasse is perhaps a strong word, and certainly an easy one. Yet the diagnosis should surprise no one. The inadequacies of the older historical and philological criticism are by now notorious, and we can dispense with a parade of slogans that have more than ac- complished their purpose. At the moment, the New Criticism en- joys high academic repute; it has, for the most part, been thorough- ly institutionalized; it continues to do striking work in the hands of competent critics, and wherever it has allied itself with true scholarship, it has been an instrument of subtlety and depth. But as a method it is liable to the same distortion as any method; and it has everything to fear from the literalness of its zealots. No one who reads much recent criticism can be unaware of the carking restiveness among the pioneers of the New Critics as they see their methods turned into formulae and the crucial tact of the good critic expelled by the needs of schematic order. "I want," says R. P. Blackmur in The Lion and the Honeycomb, "to protect the methods [of the New Criticism] from its methodologies." I have the same hope here, and it is a hope which I want as much as possible to put in positive terms. But because the field I have in mind is Greek tragedy and classical studies generally, and because the situation of the New Criticism is different in respect to a dead language than what it is to a modern one, these matters deserve a context. 31</page><page sequence="2">32 The Tulane Drama Review Roughly since the end of the war the traditional methods of classical scholarship as they affected literary criticism have been under attack in our graduate schools by the advocates of the New Criticism. As compared with studies in modern literatures, the attack on the classical front came late, delayed both by the addic- tion to cultural lag which is almost a point of pride among classi- cists, and by the extreme penetration of classical studies by the austere and quasi-scientific methodologies of the German gymna- sium. Unlike scholars of English who never really wholly re- nounced criticism, classicists in America came to regard criticism as the perverse imp of the subjective in a field they fondly imagined was objective. This suspicion of criticism, it should be noted, was a peculiarly American thing, just as the reaction against it has been, for the most part, American also. If the stimulus to this dislike of criticism derived from Germany, it is also true that the formidable influence of such great scholars as Wilamowitz countered the cur- rent there, while elsewhere in Europe the long tradition of humane scholarship kept the activities of critic and scholar in more or less vital relation. One can point with pride, it is true, to American achievements in classical scholarship in the twentieth century, but the achievements occur in just those fields where the refine- ment of method, and especially scientific method, is crucial: archae- ology, epigraphy, papyrology, numismatics, palaeography. Worse yet, all of these dubious sciences were devoted with an appalling single-mindedness to one end, the discovery of fact, in which fact was arbitrarily and with killing literalness reduced to historical or philological fact. Criticism itself was clearly confounded with the journalism of values and pushed to the fringes where it petered out either in limp impressionistic essays on the value of the classics or in the mellow obiter dicta of dying scholars. In short, American classical scholarship for forty years effectively renounced literary criticism as an honorable and rational habit of mind, and the re- sults are apparent in the dreary waste of literary studies during those years; at least I can think of no first-rate, nor even second- rate, critical work on Greek tragedy by an American scholar from 1900 to 1940, though there is God's good plenty of works on the stage, conventions, Attic society, resolved senarii and the like. But certainly one finds nothing comparable to the real criticism of such European scholars as Sheppard, Wilamowitz or even the much- maligned Gilbert Murray. When the attack finally came, it came with the energy that at- tends any deep habit of mind that has for a long time been rigor- ously suppressed. It was slowed, not merely by the entrenchment of the Germanic spirit, but by a factor of considerable but neglect- ed importance: unlike English, both Greek and Latin are dead languages, poorly preserved and poorly documented, lacking pre-</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 33 cisely that richness of information about language which is every- where the essential condition of the newer criticism. But in the enthusiasm for a method that had the advantage of being at least literary, that honored the work for itself and not for its historical or informational uses, this crucial limitation was brushed aside. Real excesses, however, were prevented by the salutary insistence of the older generation that the fundamental responsibilities of the scholar be observed. This insistence, because defensive, was both surly and grumpy, but it had its effect: at least no classical critic, to my knowledge, has yet proclaimed that the Oresteia is a "hier- archy of epiphanies." Moreover, from the first, the impulse to the restoration of criticism to scholarship in America came as much from the humane tradition of European scholarship as from critics like Empson, Brooks, Ransom and Blackmur. Indeed, it was on the whole European scholars who first appreciated the refinement of verbal techniques offered by the New Criticism. Besides, no critic worth his salt, however belligerent, could honestly deny that the extreme poverty of fact which attends classical studies had long ago forced scholars to adopt in desperation something very like the New Criticism: one thinks of Jebb's monumental close-reading of Sophocles, with its susceptibility to shade and texture; Wila- mowitz' great edition of the Heracles, and now of Fraenkel's Aga- memnon; on still another level, verging toward the perverse or crankish, are the strange works of Verrall and Norwood on Euripides and such non-classical oddities as Samuel Butler's The Authoress of the Odyssey. But in the last ten years it is abundantly clear that criticism has returned to classical scholarship; if the New Criticism as such is not yet, in classics, the heavy industry it has become in English studies, its pressure is clearly visible and especially among the younger generation. The direct influence of the critics themselves upon classical studies has mostly been oblique, and, more often than not, unfortunate: Francis Fergusson's able but unconvincing piece on the Oedipus Rex is some kind of exception, extraordinary in its perceptivity, but crippled in its too great reliance upon theories of the ritual origins of tragedy. And neither Kenneth Burke's strange essay on the Oresteia nor Edmund Wilson's perversion of the Antigone provides reliable models. But the New Criticism is writ large in Goheen's study of the imagery of the Antigone, dif- fused throughout Kitto's Greek Tragedy and Lattimore's superb introduction to his translation of the Oresteia, or Owen's fine com- mentary on the Iliad, and everywhere visible in the spate of dis- sertations which study single plays or single metaphors or the master-tropes of tragedy, and in the insistent emphasis upon the key terms of the New Critics: irony, ambiguity, symbol, tone, im- age, texture, formal structure and myth. And finally, even the</page><page sequence="4">34 The Tulane Drama Review classical journals and the professional societies have shown in the last few years a grudging willingness to admit the newer critics as at least junior partners in the firm. From the point of view of the past, these are encouraging signs, and all the more so since critical activity has here been accom- panied by extraordinary energy in the field of translation-the new translations of Homer, tragedy, Vergil, Ovid, Hesiod, Pindar and Greek lyric. Good translation is, of course, exemplary and creative criticism: to have an Iliad or an Oresteia as substantial and moving as we have in Lattimore's translations is to have a guarantee of the fresh and right response of feeling without which criticism is an empty exercise. In this sense translations and criti- cism work hand in hand, each sponsoring the other's vitality: just as criticism is crippled if it neglects scholarship, so the translator's task is vitiated without the act of criticism. In this connection the difference between Lattimore's Oresteia and Pound's Trachiniae is illuminating; for what makes Pound's translation incomparably the poorer of the two is the way in which, the scholarship suspended almost altogether, the critical sense is so impaired that it can no longer supervise the adjustment of language to the moral and emotional facts of the play. Talent here, tethered to nothing except Pound's extraordinary sense of music, has gone rogue and wild. By which I do not mean, of course, that Lattimore's scholarship makes him an acceptably tame poet; on the contrary, there is an immense turbulence in his translation, but it is a true and Aeschy- lean turbulence, not an imposed wildness. Good poetry guarantees good turbulence; the work of critic and scholar are required to make that turbulence Aeschylean and true. Up to now the most conspicuous failure of both the traditional and the new critics in respect to Greek tragedy has been the failure to realize turbulence: turbulence of experience, turbulence of morality in the process of getting made, and the turbulence of ideas under dramatic test. If any one charge can be brought against the older criticism, it would be, I think, that it has seemed to ask too little of Greek tragedy, and asking so little, has rarely discover- ed much. Its crucial failure has come at the point where all criti- cism is finally tested: the ability to transfer complex experience from one period or language to another, and to get the substance of that experience-its turbulence as well as its final order-into language. This is, of course, in the end, impossible, but it is the ideal by which we measure the adequacy of any interpretative criticism. Where the older criticism failed was in the deeper skills of the very humanity it professed, the point where passion is used to make the experience from which any great image of humanity, like the Greek one, is made. Intensely obsessed with history and</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM ARROWSVITH 35 politics, the traditional criticism failed to show how history and politics got into tragedy and what they did there in relation to the humanity of the heroes; concerned with man and his destiny, it could never quite conjure up the complex reality of experience and suffering that in the Greek plays gives human passion its meaning; committed to the task of clarity, it failed on the whole to remove that dense patina of stiffness and strangeness and auster- ity that makes Greek tragedy so formidable to our first impres- sions, or translated it into sentimental commonplaces and limp passions. Who, after all, is really stirred by the standard interpretations of the Antigone-that tidy passion of a perfect heroine caught up on the gods' errand and hindered by a brutal Creon, a conforming Ismene, and a dunderheaded chorus with an inexplicable gift of tongues? And who believes the fashionable reverse, with its stub- born and presumptuous Antigone, its tragic Creon and its mis- understood Ismene? These interpretations are, to my mind, not credible because they so clearly violate the emotional experience of the play or reduce its difficulties to the vanishing-point. What has not gotten into them is the play's real turbulence and complex- ity and what they express is rather the superficial order the play throws up as its terms or its field, not its subject or solution. What is missing is what, to my mind, the play insists upon in both action and character: the way in which Antigone, trying to uphold a principle beyond her own, or human, power to uphold, gradually empties that principle in action, and then, cut off from her human- ity by her dreadful heroism, rediscovers herself and love in the loneliness of her death; not the opposition between Antigone and Creon, but the family resemblance which joins them in a common doom; not great heroism justified by great principles, but conduct in the fateful grip of principles, making out of courage and love a deeper principle altogether. And if you look to the Oedipus Rex or the Agamemnon or the Bacchae, it seems to me you find the same impoverishment: what is real or turbulent in the life of those plays is for the most part expelled, either because the critic has let his own principles of order usurp the play, or because his own ex- perience is unequal to it, or because he refuses the act of criticism once it gets near the difficult edge of experience. How many inter- pretations of the Oedipus Rex, for instance, have come to grief on the fruitless quest for a tragic flaw that will justify the hero's suffering simply in order that Aristotle be justified. How com- monly the cry of botching is raised against Euripides because his plays refuse to conform to the critic's expectations of proper or- ganic structure. And how little of the full turbulence of the Orestes or Bacchae-those great pitiless mirrors of the terrible political and social desperation of late fifth-century Hellas---does our criti-</page><page sequence="6">36 The Tulane Drama Review cism get, largely because we ask so much less of tragedy than it requires. Thanks to the New Criticism, we can hope to see the turbulence of language and rhetoric restored to tragedy, for the New Critics are nothing if not keen-nosed where verbal subtlety and density are concerned. And we have, I think, everything to hope for from the thorough examination of the rhetorical habits of Greek tragedy. But I sometimes wonder whether a keen nose for metaphor, irony or ambiguity is much to the point when the spoor is as old and crossed as that of Greek tragedy. It is, for instance, extremely dif- ficult in fifth-century literature to distinguish between metaphor that is genuinely fresh and metaphor that has hardened into idiom or cliche; we simply do not possess the linguistic evidence that might allow us to tell them apart. How fresh, for instance, are those yoke and ship images which run like master-tropes through all three tragedians? Or are these simply the metaphorical idiom of an agricultural and seafaring people? The answer, of course, lies in a desperately difficult tact, but that tact comes far harder in Greek and Latin than it does in a living literature like English where we understand stress and tone as we never can in Greek. And the chances are high, of course, that tact will disappear before the critic's drive for conceptual consistency: I know of at least one treatment of the symbolism of the Oresteia where the interpreta- tion derived more from the itch for conceptual rigor in the imagery than from the emotional experience of the play. And this risk seems to me particularly high for the New Criticism in its academic setting, where the old insistence upon methodology and the stu- dent's necessary economies with complexity combine to harden method into mere formula. I would not, of course, like the consciousness of risk to damage the enterprise: we badly need in Greek tragedy just that refine- ment of rhetoric which has been the success of the New Criticism. We need to know, for instance, just how those sententiae with which Greek tragedy is so lavish and which so embarrass modern producers of Greek plays, arise from the action; the structure of stichomythia, that brisk staccato exchange of single lines for up to a hundred lines at a time, is badly in need of work; I suspect that the relation between metaphor and dance-figures is crucially im- portant; we know very little about irony in tragedy, so little that the tone of whole scenes and even whole plays is in question; the language itself, with its curious alternation between stiff archaism and colloquial speech, its habits of rhetorical movement, from the big jaw-breaking, piled-up compounds of Aeschylus to the decep- tive simpleness of Euripides, is still terra incognita; and I suspect that we have barely started to do the work required by the choral lyrics. Beyond these jobs, it is my personal conviction that the</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 37 study of tragedy would enormously benefit from a shift in perspec- tive; we need to question, that is, our tacit assumption that Greek tragedy is staged in a religious context or represents a kind of collective worship, for the assumption vitally affects interpretation. And it seems to me that nothing but chaos can come from the fashionable notion that because Greek tragedy begins in ritual, its structure is therefore ritual dramatized, its hero a ritual scapegoat, and its action a shadow play of the death of the Eniautos-daimon or god of the year. The more I read of Greek tragedy, that is, the more I am impressed with its very distance from its ritual origins and its stubborn refusal to behave as honest ritual should. And there is something violently improbable about an image of the Greek theatre which does the kind of damage done by Gilbert Murray's recanted theory of its ritual elements and more recently by Francis Fergusson in his study of the Oedipus. If we require an idea of the Greek tragic theatre at all, it seems to me that the clue might best be taken from the very charge of rhetoric so persistently brought against tragedy, and against Euripides in particular ever since the time of Schlegel. Over and over again, that is, the late fifth-century tragedy seems to suggest as its informing image a theatre shaped more by the law-court than by the altar. In this theatre, the agon is viewed essentially as a trial, and the characters, with all the tricks of sophistic rhetoric, put their cases in opposed speeches--often of identical length, as though timed by the waterclock of the Athenian dikastery. The audience in this theatre sits as jurors, not merely a panel of five hundred jurors, but the full Heliaea, the sovereign judicial assem- bly (ekklesia). No appeal, no matter how emotional, is debarred, and each character in his plea speaks with the formal passion of a man whose life and fortunes hang upon his words. But it is a formal and rhetorical passion, below which we can glimpse, as the jury must, the personal passion and the real motives glozed by the rhetoric and often exposed in action. Such a theatre, of course, is most appropriate to Euripides, but in some degree, I think, to Sophocles also, especially in the later plays. I find tentative con- firmation of this not merely in the number of Greek tragedies which openly stage formal trial scenes, but in the very structure of Euripidean drama: its persistent avoidance of the single hero in favor of the agon of two chief characters-Pentheus vs. Dionysus, Phaedra vs. Hippolytus, Orestes vs. Menelaus, Ion vs. Creusa-and the corresponding division of so many plays into two almost dis- parate actions; the flat assertion of the intention to make a formal plea; and, most important, the constant impression of the plays as problem plays in which the judgment is never asserted, but left, as it were, to the audience of jurors. If they understand the play, they make the right decision, or better, understand that no moral</page><page sequence="8">38 The Tulane Drama Review decision is relevant because the problems are beyond the reach of moral judgment, i.e. are both tragic and true. If this is correct, it is understandable why the constant imposition upon Euri- pides of Aristotelian structure and the notion of a religious theatre so regularly distort him. I throw this suggestion out, not as a de- veloped thesis, but merely as a hint. For it seems to me that in the study of tragedy, as in almost any other human study, the dis- coveries come in that slight shift of perspective which we get when we examine those prejudices and assumptions which are so close to habit that we are almost unaware of them. And both our almost unconscious Aristotelianism and our deep assumption that Greek tragedy is finally religious tragedy are habits which I think need severe scrutiny by any serious critic of Greek drama. The last charge which I should like to bring against the New Criticism is related to just this refusal to examine one's oldest habits. It is finally full interpretation of the plays and the trage- dians that we want, and I find it puzzling that the newer criticism of Greek tragedy so seldom undertakes the full job. This may be modesty, but I suspect it is the old illusion of objectivity in fancy dress; and between Quellenforschungen and metaphor-snooping, both uprooted from the values they are intended to discover or reinforce, I can see very little difference. It is not merely that the New Criticis have failed to take up the job of full interpretation, however, that I find distressing, but the fact that their analyses proceed more from the habit of old interpretation than the fresh act. I am not by this proposing that the New Critics should make their fortunes by systematically inverting all traditional criticism, but that analysis, wherever possible, should free itself from the immense authority of the standard interpretations. A book I ad- mire, Goheen's analysis of the imagery of the Antigone, originally written as a dissertation and suffering the handicaps of that im- possible genre, ably illustrates just how much the New Critics have to offer in enriching our criticism of tragedy. But unless I am mistaken, Goheen's close analysis is subtly hindered by the authority of the nineteenth-century Antigone, whose shape guides the analysis where it needs to go, but not where it might have gone were its destination a little less certain. This is not slyness, of course, but the necessarily blinkered gaze of good conviction: you look where you are going, not askance. But the one metaphor Mr. Goheen overlooks-the metaphor of alienation, Antigone as metic or peregrine-a casual sport so far as his theory is concerned, seems to me the one metaphor that most illuminates the key word of the play--philia or love. Habit is hard to shed, of course, but in the case of Greek tragedy where critical habit has hardened into cultural habit, I think it is crucial to any hope of a fresh and exact- ing criticism.</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 39 In this connection one point deserves mention. Greek tragedy is, par excellence, a sacred cow, even more sacred, I suspect, than Shakespeare, since it is seldom produced or else produced via the atrocious medium of Mr. Robinson Jeffers and Broadway; and most students get introduced to it.in the killing atmosphere of reveren- tial hush that attends the reading of any classic in our general humanities courses. Worse, fewer and fewer literary men read Greek nowadays or read it with sufficient security to challenge the scholars on their own ground, as Goethe challenged Schlegel and Matthew Arnold challenged Newman with enormously fruitful results. And in scholarship, as I suggested earlier, unconscious timidity in the face of the accumulated judgments of dead scholars is a deep critical habit. In evidence of this attitude of blind defer- ence to Greek tragedy, let me cite the production not so long ago on Broadway of two Greek plays by a modern Greek repertory troupe: night after night, audiences and dramatic critics, unable to understand a word of the productions, but deeply impressed with the performance of their cultural duties, willfully applauded on the curious assumption that Greek tragedy is mostly gesture any- way, and that a modern Greek company, by virtue of being Greek, somehow must possess the secrets of ancient Greek tragedy. Against adulation like this, it may be beyond the power of critcism to help, and the critic himself may be insensibly drawn into the work of justification rather than criticism. But it needs to be pointed out that we are in real danger of taking over almost intact the canon of Greek tragedy which the nineteenth century established. Who, after all, except classical scholars, now reads any Aeschylus except the Oresteia and Prometheus, any Sophocles except the Theban plays, and what Euripides besides the Alcestis, Medea, Hippolytus and Bacchae? I am not, of course, suggesting that these are not great plays, but that the canonizing of them into a cultural monu- ment damages the chosen eleven as much as the excluded tragedies. Worse, the difficulty is not merely that we have adopted an old taste, but the habits that accompany that taste as well, and espe- cially the nineteenth century habit of making Sophocles the norm, if not the ideal, of tragedy-a habit which has done great damage to Aeschylus and almost irreparable damage to Euripides. It is no accident, for instance, that the favored plays of Euripides are pre- cisely those which appear to meet the standards of so-called Aristotelian structure, that is, the "organic structure" which critics think they find in Sophocles. Against this tendency, I can only argue that it botches Sophocles as badly as Euripides, and that it cuts off our access to a power in Euripides that meant very little to the nineteenth-century but everything to the twentieth-I mean that part of Euripides that is concerned with political desperation, the corruption of power, and the corrosion of the civilized virtues</page><page sequence="10">40 The Tulane Drama Review into a set of specious slogans for demagogic consumption. We need not only the Bacchae, but the Hecuba, the Heracles, the Orestes, Electra, Supplices and Trojan Women-all plays in which we should sense the full turbulence of one of the very greatest of dramatists in a context that very easily becomes our own. But this means production as well as criticism, since nothing hinders the critic's right perception of a play more than the perpetual unavail- ability of his material in living form. At the moment, I can think of no greater service to Greek tragedy than the regular production of those plays that lie outside the canon and are so commonly re- garded as undramatic, and particularly the plays of Euripides whose structure is censured by critics who have never seen them performed. But such a service needs to be regular, a continuous repertory production, and not merely those sporadic productions which derive from a duty to the classics; but it is a service I hope some lively academic theatre may be encouraged to perform, since Broadway offers even less to Greek tragedy than it does to the modern playwright. What, in the meantime, should criticism do? I spoke earlier of the turbulence traditional criticism missed, and, at its most gen- eral, the charge I have preferred against the criticism of tragedy is its incompleteness. What was incomplete in the older criticism was that it over-generalized experience and missed whatever was complex and particular in human passion; it took the particular turbulence for granted, that is, and thereby leached its own gen- eralizations of what should have given them life. What the newer criticism missed was meant to be implied by what it got-turbu- lence of language; but the implications, trapped by the New Criti- cism's notorious penchant for the autonomy of the work and its deep embarrassment in the face of value, only rarely succeeded; ex- perience got swamped in the generalizing drive of the symbolism or the technique of the dramatist's work. What I want to restore to the criticism of tragedy is a sense, a feel, a look of significantly lived experience, particular before being general, the turbulence of the actual disorder of experience as it moves on to make the drama- tist's order. To restore depth and passion to the terms of experi- ence-the notion of a personal fate, responsibility, purpose, the emotions before and after their moralizing, illusion, necessity and reality; to show how values burgeon out of structure and plot; to know again why the plot is the "soul of the play", not its skeleton; to see that any character in a play who lives and uses his passion is prior to anything he may stand for; to refresh the simplicity of reason through the complexity of passion, not the other way around: this is a part of what I mean by turbulence, the turbulence to which both the critic and the producer are responsible. Unless the criticism of tragedy can make itself big enough to talk about</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 41 experience at the level it proposes, it is doomed to even greater inadequacy than even criticism must normally expect. To talk about literature at the level of experience implies a criticism large enough to contain what is chaotic in experience as well as what is orderly. And it is my conviction that criticism of Greek tragedy, too heavily committed to the criteria of orderly reason and the rhetoric of intelligence, has dehumanized its heroes by cutting them off from the condition in relation to which they win their meaning. The hero, cut off by an inadequate criticism from the actual power and anguish of the condition he can never quite escape without destroying himself, loses the terrible tension and redeeming dignity of his equivocal status. Nothing comes easier than to ask criticism to become more com- plete and humane, and nothing is harder to do. Nor can we pre- scribe methods for doing it without sooner or later ramming our plays into categories which violate them. What we need at this point seems to me not more method, but a refreshment of per- spective: and particularly we want perspectives which under- cut our old methods as they harden into habit and prevent us from seeing more than they allow. It is by such refreshment of perspec- tive that we are apt to enlarge our criticism. At least this is my hope in the following remarks. II I suggested earlier that one refreshment of perspective might be found in a shift in our traditional idea of the Greek theatre, at least as that idea affects Euripides. And I should like to suggest further that we need much more precision in dealing with the hero and a different purchase on that central and elusive concept. What is most urgently needed is some sense of flexibility and variety in the ways heroism is manifested, and more attention to the dramatic use of the hero. The difficulty is not merely that we fail to distinguish between generic kinds of heroism or between the heroism of one dramatist and another, but that discussion begs almost all of the questions that affect the dramatic status of the hero in relation to his own humanity and also skirts whatever experience is relevant to the earning of heroism. Attempts to meet this problem with a unitary concept, as in Whitman's recent book on Sophocles, have been Procrustean in result: it is, of course, a pleasure to be rid of the view that Sophocles was an enlightened bishop and his heroes Anglicans in trouble, but a Nietzschean Sophocles with a Zarathustrian Antigone hardly helps us much. But most commonly heroism is treated in drastically abrogated moral terms, or made to satisfy the Aristotelian theory of the hero's tragic flaw, or reduced to the protagonist, or hypostatized and used as a critical deus ex machina. The crucial questions relevant to</page><page sequence="12">42 The Tulane Drama Review heroism, however, seem to me to be the following. First, how is heroism asserted in tragedy and how is it sustained, both morally and dramatically? What skills of experience or reality distinguish the hero from the other characters and from his former self? What is the relation between the achieved dramatic reality of the hero and his symbolic dignity? What is the cost of heroism to the hero in contrast to the values of what his heroism asserts? How does the hero's mortality affect his morality? What are the legitimate limits of the hero's responsibility for his nature or his acts? What is the relation between necessity and illusion in the hero's ability to rise to, and even surpass, the meaning of his own experience? All of these questions are uprooted from the plays that propose them, but they are proposed by the plays at that level where criti- cism cannot refuse them without really refusing everything. As they affect the Antigone, for instance, they seem to me to illumin- ate the whole moral and experiential fabric of the play. Here if ever, for instance, the tension between the cost of heroism and the values of its assertion is both vivid and crucial. Half of the dynamic horror of Antigone's tragedy is precisely her equivocal status: torn between the cold heroism of her assertion of principle and her humanity, she almost loses her humanity in the fateful grip of her principle. What distinguishes her from Creon? Principle, of course, but look again, and the distinction is replaced by the family re- semblance, a stubborn intractable loyalty to principle, and even a resemblance in principle, for both claim to act on behalf of love, philia. This principle, it is true, may be translated to another level and replaced by a struggle between family gods and state gods, but both protagonists claim at bottom to be agents of love: Antigone asserts that she was born to love (sumphilein) while Creon, in words that have been very strangely neglected, clearly states that he acts on behalf of the state because philia, love, can only exist within the context of a stable and orderly society. And this same philia is, of course, Ismene's principle too, without Antigone's courage, but philia for all that; and when Antigone refuses Ismene the right to die with her, she refuses her sister, her phile, both her own principle and the dignity of a personal fate. If, then, Antigone is the heroine of philia, we have to see, in action, what it means to act for philia in a conflict of philiai; how fate is here set against fate; how the family resemblance between Creon and Antigone is carried out in action up to the moment of heroism, and only then are they separated in a common doom. If we see these things, I think we cannot help seeing and reporting the turbulence also: the real disorder (but also the tragic symmetry) of a world where the living of love involves the denial of love elsewhere; where morality unmakes itself in conflict and is refreshed by significant passion; where heroism in the end means not surpassing one's humanity but</page><page sequence="13">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 43 discovering and incarnating its dignity at the moment of agony, and where the hero, finding weakness he never suspected, finds also his greatest strength. The hero, says Plato in one of his wonderfully crazy etymologies, "is born of love [that is, eros]"; or, to put it in other terms, the hero is reduced, but also raised, to the human con- dition. So, at least, it seems to me with Antigone. What she first accepts as a fate, the principle of love that dooms her to death, is hardened by her desperate plight and her desperate courage and loneliness; and this in turn hardens her-"Great suf- fering makes a stone of the heart," as Yeats puts it-making her refuse Ismene the same dignity of fate she claims. As she hardens, so does Creon on behalf of the same principle, denying Haemon in order to hurt Antigone, just as Antigone dishonors Ismene in order to honor Polyneices. Still hardened, but increasingly tormented by a loss she does not understand and yet the fate she chose, Antigone is condemned to her symbolic death, walled alive in a tomb, and thus cut off alike from both the living and the dead, the human be- ing still alive, like Niobe, beneath the cold rock of her heroism. And suddenly, as the chorus compares her to a goddess, she knows what has happened, and cries, "I am mocked, I am mocked!" and the rock falls away, leaving that final warm confusion that makes her so human and so lovely. In all this Creon is left far behind, though he suffers perhaps even worse; he never had Antigone's human skills to begin with; he knows only the horror, Antigone knows the horror and the glory. And that knowledge, or better, merely being that knowledge, the final knowledge of tragedy, is Antigone's heroism. Until you come to that point, however, the experience is troubled, criss-crossed with paradox, turbulent with lonely passion and isolated meaning; if simplicity supervenes with heroism, that simplicity owes all of its power to the turbulence it tries to resolve. Alternatively, in dealing with Euripides, we need to observe how the whole context of heroism has altered; that we are dealing with a world where the senselessness of circumstance may deprive the hero of responsibility, or strike at a point where responsibility is no longer relevant, as in the Hecuba or Heracles. With such an alteration, the nature of heroism is also altered, since its neces- sities change. Thus in the Heracles, the hero declares his triumph over the amoral powers which afflict him by the simple act of en- during in a world which tells him to die. For Euripides preserves the disorder of actual experience, measuring its horror against the unrequited illusion of order which sustains human beings, and the final dignity of Heracles is that he asserts the human cry for order and meaning almost in the very teeth of his own experience of hideous disorder. And the whole motive of the play is to bring the hero to the point where he shares, for the first time, common</page><page sequence="14">44 The Tulane Drama Review ground with the other characters. He discovers, that is, his con- dition and its anguish, an anguish from which his great strength has hitherto exempted him; in the discovery of anguish comes the discovery of community and love in weakness before necessity. Love is the hope which finally permits Heracles to endure a hideous necessity he never made, and from his discovery of love and help- lessness flow acceptance and courage, the courage which asserts the human demand for order in a world which annuls all hope of a moral order. So much may be immediately obvious, but the point I should like to make is precisely the profound relationship between the hero's progress and the structure of the play, the way in which the created or assumed reality of each part of the play exactly defines, as challenge and disorder, the growth of heroism and order, forcing Heracles steadily back upon his humanity in order to refresh his heroism. Yet the Heracles has been savagely censured for its dislocation of plot, its apparent division into two discrete actions bound together by nothing more than sequence. But unless I am mistaken, everything that seems strange about the play's structure can be explained in terms of its intent, the con- version of heroism via the conversion of reality and necessity. At least it seems to me that, far from being botched, the Heracles is one of the most wonderfully constructed plays of Greek tragedy, if we mean by good construction a plot exactly designed to force meaning into action. What hinders us here, however, is the deeply Aristotelian bias of our critical habits and especially the habit of imposing the example of the Oedipus Rex upon all other Greek plays. We expect unity to be of one kind, and missing it, we mis- read or condemn the play in order to salvage our own bad habits. Heroism is, of course, more difficult to comprehend in those plays -far more common than we like to believe-where we have no central dominating hero in the manner of the Oedipus Rex and the Heracles. Indeed, in the case of Euripides, the single hero is a com- parative rarity. We have, for instance, a group of plays on the order of the Hippolytus or the Phoenissae, in which heroism is dif- fused over several characters or the whole human cast, and others, like the Orestes, the Hecuba and-I believe--the Bacchae, where there are protagonists but no heroes, and no heroism either. What you get in the Orestes is really like what you get in Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida: an image of heroism seen as botched, dis- figured and sick, carried along by the slogans and machinery of heroic tragedy and then exposed in action. This is neither a satire of tragedy, however, nor a melodramatic perversion, but tragedy of total turbulence, without a principle of order in sight except that order implied in the observation that heroism has been botched and all order omitted. Consider the Bacchae in this respect. Attempts to make heroes out of Pentheus and even Dionysus have not suc-</page><page sequence="15">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 45 ceeded for obvious reasons: at least I find it hard to see the stuff of heroism in Pentheus' irritable voyeurism and Dionysus has all the heroism of an earthquake. What we have, of course, is not heroic tragedy but a tragic contest between parties who all claim to act on behalf of the same principle-sophia, badly translated as "wisdom"-and who all alike deprave their principle in action. What alone can order the play and judge that depravity to which sophia is subjected is an understanding of right sophia; but it is im- portant to see that the play omits by merely implying the only order appropriate to its instances of heroism failed. My point, then, is the simple one that heroism is too complex a term to be handled loosely, and that, if mishandled, it generates trouble in other directions. We need a tact with our terms which can distinguish when a particular concept is demanded and when it is superfluous; so far as heroism is concerned, we particularly need precision when we attempt to relate it to dramatic movement, plot, genre, and a particular dramatist. Where our definitions tend to be static rather than dynamic, or uprooted from a single type, or ab- stracted from one dramatist and imposed upon others, we im- poverish tragedy in the critical act. Likewise, in reading Aeschylus, we need to observe how a shift- ing or evolving cosmology fundamentally conditions the nature and possibilities of heroism. For surely we cannot alter the basic laws of the world in which men live and suffer without thereby deeply affecting the moral quality of their conduct and the judg- ments relevant to it. And the Oresteia is, of course, just such an evolving cosmology: a dramatic image of the gradual evolution, according to the masterplan of Zeus, of the institution of civilized justice. The progress itself hardly needs documentation. No one can read or see the trilogy and miss those wonderful transfigura- tions that chart the progress of justice from primitive blood- vengeance to civilized trial by jury: the blood-red tapestries on which Agamemnon goes to his death, suddenly revealed as the holy red robes of the transfigured Furies, or the metamorphosis of Persuasion (Peitho) from the sinister abstraction that seduces Helen, to Clytemnestra's coiling rhetoric as she lures Agamemnon to his doom, and finally that patient, crucial argument by which Athena persuades the Furies to accept an honored place in the new dispensation of Zeus. We are witnessing nothing less than the conversion of a world and, as the Chorus tells us, the reconciliation of Zeus and the Fates. Throughout the trilogy, from murder to murder to murder, we have been promised a fulfillment, a dawn, a delivery out of this intolerable net of contradictory evils, and finally, after so many false dawns and illusory solutions, we are shown the manifest pattern of Zeus the Fulfiller, the silver strand in the tapestry of blood.</page><page sequence="16">46 The Tulane Drama Review A parable, then, of tragic scope, a passion of men and gods strug- gling from darkness into the light: so much is obvious. But if no one misunderstands the nature of the light, what do we make of the darkness there in the Agamemnon where everything is chaos and contradiction, where men are apparently whirled helplessly from evil to worse evil, with no end in sight ever? What, in other words, is the relation of Zeus of the Eumenides to the darker Zeus of the Agamemnon? Is he an inscrutable god, secretly at work be- hind all the apparent contradictions, slowly forcing the whole action toward an inevitable conclusion? A kind of Greek Jehovah, that is, tempting men, out of his enormous bewildering mystery, to cramp him in the small boxes of their own petty theodicies? Or is he like the Zeus of the Prometheus-trilogy, an undeveloped god who once again undergoes a progress from callous indifference to a final moral wisdom tempered by compassion? Or is he a grad- ualist, a reforming Fabian demiurge, hampered by a whole host of discordant powers, the still potent heirs of an older dispensation, and by quarrels on Olympus too? As I see it, the world of the Agamemnon is clearly one in which the possibility of moral action is obscured and prevented by a deep discord in the nature of things. We have a prospect of insuperable moral difficulty, a nightmare of justice in which the assertion of any right involves a further wrong, in which fate is set against fate in an intolerable, necessary sequence of violence. There is Zeus, of course, and Zeus is strong; but if the Chorus, in a famous ode, praises Zeus' power and wisdom, we are meant to read'that prayer, I think, not as a factual description of a known Zeus, but as a last desperate act of faith, cried in the very teeth of experience: sor- row, sorrow, but may good win out in the end. In other words, the Agamemnon presents us with a world which is at all points essen- tially Homeric; nothing, in fact, in the entire Agamemnon, includ- ing the choral ode on Zeus, is incompatible with the cosmology of Homer. The life of men on earth, torn this way and that by con- flict and irresponsibility in heaven, is a tragic hell; and if men and gods jointly share the responsibility for human actions, the choices are irreparably clouded by inconsistency and discord among the gods. In the Iliad and the Odyssey there is a double standard: divine adultery, for instance, is comic, but human adultery is ter- ribly punished. So too the Agamemnon shows us, in conscious juxtaposition, the same double standard: Agamemnon himself is the fatally chosen instrument of Zeus to punish the adultery of Paris, but Apollo callously and with impunity seduces Cassandra and leads her to her death at Clytemnestra's hands. The contrast could hardly be more glaring. And though in the Eumenides Apollo may very well incarnate the ruthlessness of the male in a contest with the female Furies, it is an intentional anomaly in the Aga-</page><page sequence="17">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 47 memnon that the same ruthlessness should be visited on a helpless human victim. And what are we to make of the fact that Artemis, "angered at the flying hounds of her father," should openly flout the will of Zeus and demand the sacrifice of Iphigeneia before allowing the Greeks to proceed on the Zeus-enjoined conquest of Troy? The only possible conclusion is surely that there is discord in heaven, just as in the Iliad we see god set against god in a perpetual attempt to slow or cross the will of Zeus. Anomaly, contradiction, moral irresponsibility on earth and in heaven: this is the world of the Agamemnon, and it is, I think, precisely what we should ex- pect. How else, dramatically speaking, could Aeschylus have shown us his gradual progress toward the light? For the light requires a darkness to dispel, and the darkness of the Agamemnon is a de- liberately constructed one, not the result of the dramatist's con- fusion or inconsistency. A related problem: does Agamemnon enjoy freedom of action or was he compelled to sacrifice Iphigeneia? Once again the answer, I think, is the Homeric one, which is to say that Agamemnon free- ly chose but he was also compelled to choose. So in the Iliad we see Agamemnon freely confiscate Achilles' prize and so bring on the fatal wrath; later, however, he declares that it was not he who did it but Zeus and Ate, which is simply Homer's way of sustaining the crucial doubleness of all his action: Agamemnon chose an act which Zeus also chose him to do. To modern ears this may seem an evasion of difficulty by way of paradox, but the notion, I believe, is firmly classical and also commonsensical: we all think we act with freedom though upon reflection it frequently seems that we could not possibly have acted otherwise than we did. So in the Agamemnon we find the Chorus declaring that Agamemnon put on the yoke of necessity, but before that it asks: "What coursp without evils?" Which, at least to my ears, suggests choice, how- ever small in fact that choice may have been. In short, Agamemnon chooses his necessity, but equally Zeus' necessity chose him; being the kind of man he is, he chooses as he does. Consider in this con- nection the famous Aeschylean fragment: "when Zeus wishes to destroy a man's house utterly, he puts an aitia [i.e. a cause or re- sponsibility] in the man." What does this mean except that a man acts from the necessity of his nature and as god compels him? Similarly we later find Agamemnon asserting that he and the gods are jointly responsible [metaitioi] for the destruction of Troy, and Clytemnestra likewise declares to Orestes that she and Destiny are jointly responsible accomplices [paraitioi] in the murder of Aga- memnon. And surely it is just this joint responsibility that the action everywhere exhibits and requires. Thus in the famous cen- tral scene of the red tapestries, we see Agamemnon, reluctant and wary but also deeply tempted and guilty, finally lured into Clytem-</page><page sequence="18">48 The Tulane Drama Review nestra's net as his fatal vanity once drove him, with the connivance and foreknowledge of heaven, to sacrifice his daughter. So too we can detect in Clytemnestra's action itself both the deep sources of her own motivation and the hand of heaven. She too chooses her revenge, but she is also the instrument chosen of heaven to cut down Agamemnon. Consider also the deliberate parallel with Orestes. At the open- ing of the Choephoroe we find Orestes suffering under almost the same necessity as Agamemnon earlier: just as Artemis ordered Agamemnon to kill his daughter, so Orestes is commanded by Apollo to murder his mother. Hideous punishment is threatened if he disobeys, and yet Orestes, I think, can be said to choose here because he so clearly acts for motives that are properly his own: vengeance for his father and the recovery of his patrimony. He too chooses, that is, the act he is also constrained to commit. But there is this time a crucial difference: the comparative purity of the motive. Unlike Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, Orestes under- takes his murder with the reluctance and misgiving of an innocent heart and also with the determination of justice. Even Electra ex- plicitly questions the wisdom of a god who could command that a mother be murdered by her son. For the first time, that is, in the history of the house of Atreus, a murder is being undertaken in something like purity of heart, for Orestes' act is clouded neither by his father's fatal vanity nor by his mother's jealousy and guilty hatred. It is revenge pure and simple, reluctant and unhappy and uncertain, but the nearest thing to the spirit of true justice that an age of vendetta-justice can offer. For we must be careful to judge the hero by the standards of the age in which he lives, and this is a world whose only justice as yet is the simple and brutal lex talionis. Great consequences flow from this, I think, for innocence in this play is crucial. Not only does it signify to Zeus that the moment is at last ripe for the institution of civilized justice, but it is because Orestes' heart was pure and his action productive of conscience and remorse that he can, without divine inconsistency, be purged and finally acquitted. But there is more to it than that: precisely because Orestes' innocence is deeply his own, the native reaction of his own heart to the callous command of a god who told him to cut down his father's murderers "in their own fashion, to turn to the bull's fury in the loss of his estates," mankind becomes, through Orestes, partner and accessory [metaitios] with Zeus in the great act of justice that closes the trilogy. Orestes' act releases Zeus, but because the act was undertaken in free innocence, men share with Zeus the glory of the new justice which we now see has been Zeus' intent from the beginning. But wisdom on earth must pre- cede Zeus' revelation: the condition of justice is the free and rightly</page><page sequence="19">WILLIAlM ARROWSMIIITH 49 motivated collaboration of men, and this could only come about when men discovered both innocence and compassion before neces- sity. Orestes kills but first he hesitates, and the whole world and the fate of mankind hang in that act of hesitation. For the play is about nothing less than the discovery of wisdom [sophia] under the yoke of awful necessity. To us, the heirs of Orestes' act, it may seem a small wisdom that a man who must kill should, for pity's sake, hesitate, but this is the wisdom appropriate to the necessity in question. And it marks, I think, in Aeschylus' eyes, a great moment in the fortunes of mankind, since it is the indispensable pre- requisite of civilized justice itself. God sends necessity upon man that he may learn, and learning, become the partner of god in the great drama of the making of a civilized world. Look back now at the Agamemnon from this vantage-point. If I am right, what we see is a world of terrible disorder, fate set against fate, god against god, man against man and god, all en- tangled in the great net of a justiceless, impossible justice. For this confusion, man and god are jointly responsible, but even the mind of Zeus is hampered and restricted by the still potent necessities of an older and more barbaric world-order. In this world, tragedy can only work itself out through time and suffering, and Zeus him- self is powerless to act until the heart of man happens on the be- ginnings of a truer justice. For justice without the wisdom to sus- tain it would have been a meaningless gift, and wisdom, as the Chorus tells us, is learned in suffering. And so we see Clytemnestra and Agamemnon caught in a necessity which their own natures as well as the conflicting purposes of heaven have made. But we should not judge them too harshly; true, they do what they do and suffer what they suffer because they are what they are, but unless I am mistaken, we can almost hear Aeschylus saying between the lines, how can we expect men to be better than gods? If Agamem- non has murdered Iphigeneia, how much more brutal is the conduct of Apollo towards Cassandra. We must judge, that is, by the standards appropriate to Agamemnon's world, and if we judge him rightly we shall be in a position to understand the true stature of Orestes' heroism, surpassing in moral skills the god who com- manded him to kill. Agamemnon, however proud, however guilty of hybris, is a man torn between the necessity of his own nature and the necessities imposed upon him by a world of moral disorder. He is not, I think, a true tragic hero--for Orestes is the hero of the Oresteia-but the self-involved tragic victim of a world which is as flawed as he is. He is therefore a candidate for compassion as much as judgment, and so are Clytemnestra and her victim, Cas- sandra. Only a mind unreceptive to the meaning of Athena's justice can refuse to give these casualties of a great cosmology in the mak- ing the human justice of pity and compassion. This, it seems to me,</page><page sequence="20">50 The Tulane Drama Review is an essential part of the real complexity and enormous moral tur- bulence of the Oresteia. III Unless I am mistaken, tragedy is also in deep need of some new perspectives in the matter of its operative moral terms as well as in structure and plot. And particularly, I think, we need to ques- tion again the relevance of Aristotle on at least two points-the so- called tragic flaw and the putative Aristotelian theory of tragic structure, the structure that draws its sanction from the Oedipus Rex and is reinforced by our modern preference for the organic. Aristotle is, I know, a rough customer: he has of necessity immense authority, and one is never quite sure whether one is talking about Aristotle or about something that has borrowed the authority of his name. But I have never been able to satisfy myself that the Poetics is the purely inductive treatise that scholars claim it is: again and again, that is, what is inductive in the Poetics seems to me to be directed by what is not, the pervasive notion of a purposive and rational universe and all that such a notion implies for tragedy and for the structure of tragedy. Thus for Aristotle a tragic fall is grounded in a consistent and harmonious sense of a man's responsi- bility for his nature and his actions: when the hero falls, he falls for his own failure, and behind the rightness of his fall, working both pity and terror by the precise and relentless nature of its operations, stands the order which society and a god-informed world impose upon the individual. What the law requires, the world requires too, and so the Aristotelian play portrays, like an image of human life, the individual torn and suffering between his nature and an objective world-order. The tragic fall is, of course, in the common reading of Aristotle, based upon the hero's possession of a tragic flaw; and whether as doctrine or habit, the attempt to find a tragic flaw in Greek plays seems to me a persistent stumbling-block. If you really look at the Oedipus, for instance, it is immediately clear that Oedipus' tragic flaw is hard to discover: one wants to know-if you begin with the Aristotelian habit-just what in the hero's nature or his acts makes him suffer as hideously as he does, and the obvious answers-his anger, his treatment of Creon and Teiresias, his attempt to avoid his fate-are all unsatisfactory, or if satisfactory, indict the gods that could afflict a man so grievously for such offense. One recent critic of the play, an Aristotelian by conviction as well as habit, recognized his dilemma immediately and proceeded to solve it by the suggestion that Sophocles in this play has generalized hamartia into something like original sin: Oedipus has no particular flaws but suffers in the very flaw of his humanity. I suspect that very few classicists, whatever their religious color, will be happy with this</page><page sequence="21">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 51 theory, and I hope that even Aristotelians might object. But I use it to illustrate the kind of trouble that the expectation of a tragic flaw can create even in the treatment of a play which Aristotle re- garded as the paradigm of his theories. I cannot myself pretend to understand that mysterious play, but I wonder if we are perhaps not the better off for proceeding from the play rather than from Aristotle. Freed from, our own a prioris, the experience of the play may at least propose itself in different terms. Thus it has always seemed to me that the single most per- tinent fact of the Oedipus was not the hero's flaw, but his refusal to accept a ready-made fate: he wants his own fate, not the gods', and though his personal fate may be cut short by his doom, Oedipus at the close of the play insists upon distinguishing his own responsi- bility by blinding himself. It is the magnificence of his own dec- laration of responsibility that makes him so heroic: his fate is his and no one else's. His anger is anger, neither more nor less; it is not the source of his doom, but the irritant that he exhibits on the road to doom; and if he has a hamartia, it is not sin or flaw but the ungovernable tragic ignorance of all men: we do not know who we are nor who fathered us but go, blinded by life and hope, toward a wisdom bitter as the gates of hell. The cost of action is suffering, and heroism is the anguished acceptance of our own identities and natures, forged in action and pain in a world we never made. Whatever the final merits of this suggestion, it at least, I think, preserves the dignity of human passion in the play without violating in the name of a crude automatic justice the mysterious destiny that rules the play. But crude or vulgar Aristotelianism' has hurt all three drama- tists, and Euripides in particular, and one of the most urgent tasks for the criticism of tragedy is the thorough re-examination of Euripidean structure; once we get Euripides straight, we may be in a position to see just where we have subtly distorted Aeschylus and Sophocles in the name of a misunderstood Aristotle. But here again, I think, criticism might best begin from the obvious--the long insistence of critics that Euripidean plays lack unity, fall into disparate actions or are merely episodes strung together. We start, that is, from the fact of dislocation and attempt to see whether dislocation might not be deliberate method rather than the hit-or- miss ad hoc work of a genius who consistently botched. What is immediately apparent if we start from this point is the real co- herence of the plays so far as structure is concerned; what is most obvious in the Heracles or Hecuba is true also of the Bacchae, Hip- polytus and Medea: all lack the kind of unity which the organic theory requires, all exhibit dislocation. If we ask why this is so, I think we find it mirrored by a curious doubleness in the action or in the given and created realities of the plays. Thus the Heracles</page><page sequence="22">52 The Tulane Drama Review shows two successive plateaus, the first a reality appropriate to legend and old convention, i.e. a world of mythical illusion, the second the full created tragic reality out of which heroism is born. If we look, say, at the Orestes, we discover a play which freely in- vents its own reality and then confronts the action so created with an epiphany of Apollo in which the whole motion of the play up to that point is flatly contradicted. We get a head-on collision, that is, between the action of the play and the traditionalizing impos- sible deus ex machina, and no attempt is made to modulate or ex- plain these incompatible sequences. The same is true of the Iphigeneia at Aulis, and also, I think, of the Medea and Electra: their conclusions are simply at variance, as real events, from the whole tenor of the action. In the Hippolytus and Bacchae this doubleness is used in a different and less violent way: both plays dramatize the full incredibility of a traditional account of Olym- pian anthropomorphism-it is incredible that gods, real gods, should act as Dionysus and Aphrodite do. But once the familiar reality has been exposed and displaced, both plays proceed, in a symbolic manner, to hint at a deeper meaning and a different real- ity for these displaced gods. What I am trying to suggest is that again and again in Euripides, what makes the plays dislocated in structure is a deliberate juxtaposition of antithetical realities-the reality of the material which the play takes from legend and myth, and the new reality which the dramatist forces, as action, from his old material. We get the same kind of jar, that is, that our lives receive when they proceed upon inadequate conviction and are suddenly confronted with difficulty too great for the old conviction. But to my mind our understanding of Euripidean structure rests firmly upon our ability to understand the dramatic experience that bridges the two or even three plateaus of reality that most Euri- pidean plays exhibit. In the Heracles, for instance, we get between the two actions no propter hoc connection of the kind Aristotelians insist upon, and yet the connection seems to me, if not quite neces- sitous, at least valid with whatever validity the conversion of human experience possesses. If heroism happens to arise from a fortuitous and accidental eruption of the irrational in the nature of things-as in the Heracles or the Hippolytus-the very fact that it is in the nature of things makes the eruption necessary or probable: we tend to disbar it only because our Aristotelian habits predispose us to a dramatic world like that of Sophocles, where the apparent irrationalities of ex- perience are explained by a divine order we cannot comprehend. But as applied to Euripides, these habits and their corollary in a crude notion of the tragic flaw can only complicate chaos further. We need rather a theory of Euripidean structure which starts from</page><page sequence="23">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 53 dislocation and attempts to show the relation of this form to a world of moral disorder. Unless I am mistaken, such examination must also show the irrelevance of propter hoc structure to Euripi- des, whose sense of necessity in drama derives more from the motion of the human mind under stress and the patterns which men's convictions make when confronted by adventitious realities. A man's character may be his destiny, but for Euripides destiny is often dependent upon and defined by circumstances the hero never made, nor the gods either. Unless we can restore an under- standing of the importance of the dramatist's assumed world for his form, Euripides must stand perpetually condemned or be ex- plained with all the willful improbability of Verrall. At least the latest book on Euripidean structure-Gilbert Norwood's Essays on Euripidean Drama-makes the implicit claim that these disloca- tions of plot and internal inconsistencies in the plays are best ex- plained as the work of fourth century redactors. This seems both unfortunate and unnecessary. One final point. Nothing, I think, more effectively hinders our understanding of the experience of Greek tragedy than the inade- quacy and crudity of meaning which critics and translators assign to the operative moral terms of Greek tragedy-sophia, hybris, anankee, sophrosunj, aristeia, time, authadia and the like. For in much criticism of tragedy these terms are used as though they pos- sessed simple English equivalents, without, I think, adequate ref- erence to the experience with which they were meant to cope. Al- ternatively, they are exposed to static definition without regard to the transformations which tragedy may force upon them as the hero moves from a situation of conventional morality and reality to an ordeal for which the traditional wisdom of the Chorus may be utterly inadequate. In such situations it is my conviction that the old moral terms are employed with a meaning so turbulent with fresh or restored experience that they are no longer the same terms, nor the hero to whom they apply the same man. Time, for instance, is normally translated as honor, but its root meaning is price, or valuation, and in most tragedies where the concept is im- portant-the Antigone, for instance-the word operates very much like the deep sense of our word "respect." Thus when Ismene claims that Antigone has not shown time to her, and that Creon has not shown time to Haemon, she means, not that she and Haemon have been dishonored, or insulted, but that they have not been respected: they have been disallowed the dignity of a fate and their dignity as individuals. They have, as it were, been priced all wrong, and this charge is, of course, central to the play, since Antigone claims to act for philia because she wishes to give time to Polyneices. What, the play seems to suggest, is the assertion</page><page sequence="24">54 The Tulane Drama Review of philia worth without time too? And what is a philia which, in order to respect one person, shows disrespect to another, both equally claiming the rights of philia? Or consider the word sophia, which we badly translate as "wis- dom," as it gets into the Bacchae. Among other things, sophia means a knowledge and acceptance of one's nature and therefore of one's place in the scheme of things. It presupposes, that is, self-knowl- edge, an acceptance of those necessities that compose the limits of human fate. It also means the consequent refinement of feelings by which a man recognizes and respects the sufferings of others before necessity: it issues in compassion.2 Sophia is further con- trasted with its opposite, amathia, a deep, brutal, unteachable, un- governable self-ignorance which breaks out in violence and cruelty. If the sophos is by definition susceptible to the feelings of civilized humanity, a compassion learned in fellow-suffering, the amathes is callous and merciless, a barbarian by nature. But it is these meanings which crowd into the Bacchae and everywhere provide, through dramatic action and testing, the play's missing principle of order. For in the course of the action, through the very brutality which they use to support their claims to sophia, both Pentheus and Dionysus utterly expose their own amathia. But more than the self-indictment of Pentheus or Dionysus is involved here. For Euripides has taken elaborate pains to show in Pentheus something more than the man who does not know the deep Dionysiac necessity of his own nature: he is also the proud iconoclastic innovator, the rebel at war with tradition, standing outside of the community's nomos [custom as law] and as theo- machos, disdainful of any power above man. Ranged against him are Cadmus, Teiresias and the chorus, who all alike appeal to the massive tyranny of tradition and folk-belief, and constantly in- voke as the sanction of society against the rebellious or anti-tradi- tional man the words sophrosune and dike. Thus in flat opposition to Pentheus' lonely arrogance of the "exceptional" (perissos) man, defying the community's nomos in the name of his own self-will, is set the chorus' tyrannous tradition: "Beyond the old beliefs, no thought, no act shall go (891-2)." We have, that is, a head-on collision between the forces which represent a brutally depraved conservative tradition and the arrogant exemplar of the ruthlessly anti-traditional mind. Both positions are alike in the cruel and bigoted violence with which they meet opposition, and the sophia and sophrosune and dike which they both claim mock their pre- tensions and condemn their conduct. If the conduct of the chorus and Dionysus outrage our sympathies and finally enlist them on Pentheus' behalf, it is because, in the nature of things, the amathia of a man is less heinous than that of a god. But both are amatheis,</page><page sequence="25">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 55 Pentheus no less than the chorus, and the play as a whole em- ploys them and their struggle as a bitter image of both Athens and Hellas terribly divided between the forces that, in Euripides' mind, more than anything else destroyed them: on the one side, the con- servative and aristocratic tradition in its extreme corruption, dis- guising avarice for wealth and power with the fair professions of the traditional aretai, meeting all attempts at change or modera- tion with the tyranny of popular piety, and disclosing in its actions the callousness and refined cruelty of civilized barbarism; on the other side, the exceptional individual, selfish and egotistical, im- patient of public welfare and tradition alike, opportunistic, dema- gogic and equally brutal in action. In saying this, I do not intend to dispute the obvious religious concerns of the Bacchae, but to stress what, to my knowledge, has not been emphasized, that the play is, like the Heracles, the Electra and the Orestes, a composite of discrete conversions, social and political as well as religious. And all of these concerns meet in the term sophia and its opposite, amathia, which at their widest enclose most of what we mean by "civilized" and "uncivilized," both morally and politically. Thus when Euripides has his chorus assert that to sophon is not the same as sophia, he means that the pretensions and conventions and habits of civilization are by no means equivalent to civilized practices. But in my opinion the same widening and deepening of the operative moral terms of Greek culture is to be found everywhere in tragedy-philia in Antigone, sophrosunj in Hippolytus, eugeneia in Heracles, aristeia in Orestes, etc.-and it would be surprising if it were not so. But upon our sense of the play off the traditional or lazy meanings of these words and the definitions which the tragic action makes lies, I think, much of the turbulence now missing from the criticism of tragedy. Let me close with a brief note on necessity, for necessity seems to me the crucial center of Greek tragedy, just as Greek tragedy seems to me unique in the firmness and sharpness with which it follows necessity into human action. In its basic aspect, necessity (ananke) is that set of unalterable, irreducible, unmanageable facts which we call the human condition. Call it destiny, call it fate, call it the gods, it hardly matters. Necessity is, first of all, death; but it is also old age, sleep, the reversal of fortune and the dance of life; it is thereby the fact of suffering as well as pleasure, for if we must dance and sleep, we also suffer, age and die. It is also sex, the great figure of amoral Aphrodite who moves in the sea, land and air and as an undeniable power in the bodies of men, compel- ling and destroying those who, like Hippolytus, refuse to accept her. Or it is Dionysus, the terrible ambiguous force of the Bacchae, "the force that through the green fuse drives the flower," and who</page><page sequence="26">56 The Tulane Drama Review destroys Pentheus who lacks the sophia that accepts him. It is the great god-sprung trap of the Oedipus and also the nature of Oedi- pus himself, that stubborn human courage of pride that drives him relentlessly into the trap. It is the necessity of political power which, in corruption, destroys Hecuba and Iphigeneia and Cassan- dra and Polyxena. It is the inherent hostility of blind chance, the incalculable daemonic malice which in the Euripidean Heracles calls out to the hero to die and tells him that there is no hope and no moral order in the world at all. Suspend necessity in the form of the play, and you get such charming, romantic plays as Iphi- geneia at Tauris and the Helen. Romantic, that is, because not tragic; and not tragic because necessity, the mainspring of tragedy, has been, for fun, for entertainment and experiment, removed. Where men are freed from the yoke of necessity, their lives cease to be tragic, and with the loss of suffering comes also the loss of dignity and sophia. For it is in the struggle with necessity that heroism is born, and even the hero, if he is to retain his humanity, must accept neces- sity. Ripeness is all. And so we see Orestes discover purity and compassion in the face of a necessity that threatens to deform him as it has already deformed his father and mother and as it inevit- ably deforms the weak, the flawed, the average human nature. So too Antigone accepts her necessity, the consequence of her own act, humanity pushed to the extreme, and thereby comes again upon her humanity in the very act of acceptance and recognition of loss. So Oedipus by asserting his total utter responsibility for his own fate, wins the victory over a necessity that would have destroyed a lesser man. And so Heracles claims a moral dignity forever out of reach of the amoral powers that persecute him. There is a mag- nificence here in the power to rise, in the anguished acceptance that must always, in Greek tragedy, precede the winning of dignity. For it is here before necessity that old morality is unmade and then remade into a new thing. Thus Orestes, having discovered at least that compassion that made him hesitate, enables justice to be born. And so too at the close of the Hippolytus and Bacchae we see the suffering human survivors of the play discover, under the awful yoke of an intolerable necessity, the love and compassion, the shared suffering that makes men endure with love in a world which shrieks at them to die. Learn wisdom through suffering, says Aeschylus, and if we are loyal to the turbulence of Greek tragedy, we can see what he means. For, stripped to the bone, the essential action of the greatest of the Greek tragedies is an enact- ment of lives lived out under the double yoke of man's own nature and a world he did not make; the weaker fail or are deformed; the strong survive, and by surviving and enduring, liberate the</page><page sequence="27">WILLIAM ARROWSMITH 57 dignity of significant suffering which gives man the crucial victory over his own fate. NOTES 1Much of contemporary dogmatizing about what Aristotle did or did not mean seems to me to rest squarely upon uninformed or unimaginative interpretation of what Aristotle actually said. I am encouraged in this opinion by Professor Gerald F. Else's magis- terial Aristotle's Poetics: The Argument (Harvard University Press, 1957), surely the most important book on Aristotelian criti- cism in the twentieth century and one which will inevitably shape and alter the whole tenor of modern explication of Aristotle. At my request, Professor Else has provided me with a brief statement of his views of what Aristotle actually said, and I quote him verbatim in the conviction of complete agreement. He writes: "There is no doubt that the root and center of Aristotle's theory of tragedy, indeed of all poetry, is the idea of an action (N.B. "an action," not simply "action"). It should be easy to say what he means by an action, since he talks about it so much; but there are obscurities and ambiguities. Perhaps the key is that an action is a transaction, the living out of a decisive turn of events by a signi- ficant human being. Aristotle seems to say that neither people nor situations-suffering, hopelessness, demoniacal possession, or what- ever-are tragic in themselves. Involvement in action is the sign- manual of our human condition and our passport to happiness; it is also the warrant of our possible ruin. Without action a man can be, but he can neither win nor lose; and the winning or losing (not having-lost or being-about-to-lose, or even being-such-as-to-lose) is the tragedy. What is tragic is neither the potentiality nor the actuality of suffering, but its actualization. Tragedy cannot be dis- played, but only enacted. It would seem to follow that the tragic action, though involved with universals-character (type), char- acteristic acts, pattern of events-is irreducibly a particular. Whether or not Oedipus is a type, the hell into which he enters is his individually, for only he has entered it through this action. But it is not clear whether Aristotle is aware of this further corollary. What he does do, beyond any ambiguity, is to insist on the primacy of the action." 2 Cf. Electra, 11. 294-5, where Orestes states that pity (to oiktos) is never to be found among the amatheis but only among the sophoi i.e. compassion is a true component of "wisdom".</page></plain_text>
