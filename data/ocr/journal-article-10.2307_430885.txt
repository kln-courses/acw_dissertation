<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews is too often a timeless and even antiseptic analysis, yet one which comes to us in a rhetori- cal cloak of fire, as if in "deconstructing" Rous- seau one had divested all the elements of the superstructure of their ideological mystification. Where the absence of political analysis led a decadent New Criticism (although not Blackmur, or for that matter Empson) into little more than a search for "paradox," it is, I think, a similar absence which leads much recent criticism into an equally sterile game of finding evidence of "textuality" everywhere. Beginnings is the most trenchant reminder in recent theory of this cost which is exacted by any analysis which does not consider how it is that literary works become literary works, even if the argument must be carried out with the constant reminder that no given context can assume the power of a unique myth of expla- nation. On the one hand, then, Said is relent- lessly suspicious of determinate methodologies which, in Cartesian fashion, divide a complex subject into its separate and discrete compon ents in order to recombine them into a hier- archy of importance derived from a single source or origin. Yet on the other, he is equally reluctant to value only the moment of discover- ing an absence, a gap, a "freeplay" of significa- tion which dissolves a central and originating authority. For "beginnings" do intend meaning, even if provisional, representative, and haunted by discontinuity. The difficulty is to approxi- mate modes of thought which, in Vico's maxim which Said employs for maximum effectiveness, "take their beginning from that of the matters which they treat," that is, which respect both the intention to mean and the discontinuity of its development, the "presence" of meaning and the "absence" of its fulfillment. "Beginnings," I think deliberately, is there- fore a "weak" word, neither a neologism in- vented for the occasion nor an obviously tech- nical term which invites the creation of elab- orate methodological engines of analysis. Said provides no new techniques of criticism, so that we could all begin talking about "beginnings" and "affiliative relationships" rather than tex- tuality and difJerance. Instead of an argument which seems to exist only for the sake of its own method, Said is old-fashioned enough to evidence his concern for the subject matter which he treats. Thus, for example, he at- tempts to demonstrate in detail the relation- ships which exist between the novel as a genre and the structure of bourgeois society, between the work of individual novelists such as Con- rad, Hardy, Mann, and others and the textual form of the novel, between "beginning inten- tions" of specific works and their realizations, between the way a novelist like Conrad at- tempts to speak and the way he listens critically to the gaps in that speaking as Nostronzo de- velops. Thus for me, and despite the absence of a deliberate and hectoring rhetoric of crisis, Beginnings remains a far more powerful cri- tique than any form of "deconstruction" of which I am aware. Yet my formulation suggests some obscure intellectual competition to determine who can salvage most successfully the terms of Western culture, and one of the virtues of Said's book is that he refuses to play. Thus my own conclu- sion is that this refusal, along with the impos- sibility of deriving a self-regulatory method of criticism from "beginnings," is all to the good, well worth the difficulty and the occasional con- fusion of reading Beginnings. The more serious problem with the book is the often too casual way in which thinkers such as Vico and Fou- cault, Marx and Freud, are used to buttress the more obscure turns of the argument, casual because lacking a significant pressure to turn to one rather than the other, and thus likewise to respect the enormous differences among these authors. Vico's own work sets a kind of historical precedent here, if I can sustain the comparison without at the same time quite claiming for Beginnings the almost miraculous force of revolutionary awareness inhlerent in The New Science. Like Vico, Said I think finds himself living in a complex activity of under- standing where in fact there often seems little help from others to be had at this point. The good news is that as Beginnings itself has begun to make its way in critical debates, and as Said has perhaps found in the work of a more re- cent Italian, Antonio Gramsci, the kind of complexity of cultural analysis necessary to sus- tain Beginnings, the importance of his argument will continue to be clarified. EVAN WATKINS Michigan State University ROY, JEAN-PIERRE. Bachelard: Ou le concept contre I'image. Les Presses De L'Universite de Montreal, 1977, 220 pp. Jean-Pierre Roy's study of Bachelard is a struc- turalist evaluation of a poetics which is "phe- nomenological," one which emphasizes the im- mediacy of the image, the subjective appre- hension of it, and the radical discreteness of each image. Since each of these notions op- 101</page><page sequence="2">102 poses a structuralist principle-the emphasis onl images rather than signs, subjectivity rather than objectivity, and discreteness rather than coherent structures-we should not be surprised to find Roy taking issue with Bachelard's basic approach. Roy analyzes Bachelard's later work in terms of the four functions which communi- cations theory isolates-emitter, code, message, and receiver-and finds that the production of the image and its placement in a syntactical structure are not seriously discussed by Bache- lard, while he valorizes the paradigmatical code and the reception of the image by the reader's consciousness. More important, however, is that Roy finds a fundamental problem in Bache- lard's poetics at each of these levels. Bache- lard's discussion of the production of images leads him into a vicious circle in which he "iden- tifie la litterature a la poesie, la poesie a l'imagi- nation et l'imagination a la litterature" (p. 208). On the paradigmatic level, Bachelard arranges his taxonomies of images in various ways, ac- cording to archetypal patterns, the four ele- ments, etc., but he provides no systematic rules for his categories, fails to supply us with a justi- fication of his codes. On the syntactic level, Bachelard ignores the structure of a work of art and fails to consider "l'image en son inscription syntagmatique . . ." (p. 209). Finally, because Bachelard's reader always approaches texts sub- jectively, he cannot resolve the problem of the communicability of the images he finds in texts. These flaws in Bachelard's work, however, are not merely random oversights; instead, they all relate to the fundamental problem of his po- etics as a whole, its dualism. They testify to the "non-scientificite' of the work which stems from the "dualism of methods which poses in principle that literary images do not depend on an objective and verifiable knowledge, on a rational and demonstrable knowledge, that images must not be studied but lived, that con- cepts finally must be studied by concepts, by reason, while images must be studied by images, by the imagination" (p. 209). Bachelard's re- fusal of commerce between concepts and images deprives his poetics of a coherent, rational, communicable framework. Of course, this dualism in Bachelard is most obvious in the two "halves" of his life-work, the first half principally devoted to philosophy of science, the second half to poetics. Roy argues, with some justification, that the work in philos- ophy of science is much more important than the poetics, that the poetics suffers precisely because Bachelard fails to consider the impact REVIEWS of his work in philosophy of science on his poetics. In the scientific work, we are told, Bachelard's position is that "the very principles of knowledge are determined by its functioning, and one cannot determine the validity of knowl- edge outside of its application" (p. 24). Insofar as function determines the validity of scientific knowledge, we get a structural epistemology, one which argues that knowledge is "con- structed," not "given," one in which the overall coherence of the system of concepts generates the validity, denying that a single concept can make any sense outside of the structure of which it is a part. This structural epistemology is combined with Bachelard's view that it is the object of scientific knowledge to purify itself of sub- jectivity, to separate the production of concepts from the subjective ideology of "representa- tions" which have a "pratico-sociale" function (p. 27). On the scientific side, then, we have objectivity, concept, structure, transformation, and on the ideological side we have subjectivity, representation, and repetition (p. 27). Roy ap- plauds the scientific attitude as Bachelard ex- presses it and believes he should have extended the same approach to his poetics. In separating the scientific activity from the poetic or imaginative, Bachelard moves away from his work in philosophy of science. Most fundamentally, perhaps, his poetics has a naive view of language; he saw the "creative," con- structive aspects of the concept, yet he does not seriously apply the same view to poetic lan- guage. As such, he is really a disguised her- meneutician, disguised because he does not consider the interpretive, creative roles the reader and language play in the construction of images. For Roy, this is simply another re- flection of Bachelard's disguised ideology, the "ideologie humaniste de la litterature" (p. 208), a humanism which "consists in being directly 'given' to man; there is there the idea of a 'totalized given' entirely opposed to the episte- mology of construction" (p. 213). It is precisely this "anthropomorphism" (p. 211) that Bache- lard wants to eliminate in his philosophy of science, and it is this anthropomorphism that Roy wants to eliminate from poetics. Bachelard's "false dualism," then, leads him to a humanistic poetics with all of its ideological implications. For this reason, Roy believes that the poetics does not wear well: "If one con- siders 'scientificity' as the cultural-historical axis of the 20th century, it appears that Bache- lard's poetics belongs to a period scientifically</page><page sequence="3">Reviews anterior to that of his epistemology" (p. 220). Given that premise, Roy is surely correct, and his book is a thorough account of Bachelard's deviation from "scientificity." Bachelard, how- ever, as one of the chief exponents of the scien- tific attitude in his early and middle work, was obviously aware of his deviation from that norm, and while the flaws that Roy sees in his work are definitely present and need to be dealt with, it may be that the most important insight of Bachelard, the archetypal scientific mentality, is that the scientific attitude is not adequate in itself, even in the century of scientificity. Though this issue falls outside of the domain of Roy's otherwise thorough work, one does wish that he had, at least at some point, ques- tioned his own scientific ideology. JAMES S. HANS Washington University BENJAMIN, WALTER. The Origin of German Tragic Drama, trans. by John Osborne, intro. by George Steiner. London: NLB, 1977, 260 pp., $16.00. This book is primarily for a student of Ger- man literary history, its philosophical preten- sions notwithstanding. Nonetheless, that per- spective can be instructive for a reader inter- ested in literary theory and, in particular, tragedy, inasmuch as one sees in history as care- fully painted as it is here how a genre is in- evitably colored by its historical context. More- over, there is a bit here to be learned con- cerning Nietzsche's and Schopenhauer's views of tragedy, if one has the patience to press through a prose which raises some sympathy for Cornelis, the "local aesthetician," who, ac- cording to Steiner, found Benjamin's treatise to be "an incomprehensible morass" (p. 11). Steiner's introduction is a special aid to pene- trating Der Ursprung des deutschen Trauer- spiels. In it we learn that Ursprung was an expanded doctoral thesis completed in 1925 and submitted to fulfill a requirement for secur- ing a position in either the German or Aes- thetics faculty of the University of Frankfurt (pp. 8-9). It predates Benjamin's turn toward Marxism and was born at a time which invites some comparison in style with the dark aphor- isms of Wittgenstein's Tractatus as well as other cultural products of European Judaism in the 1920s (pp. 14-15). Steiner suggests that this intellectual atmosphere may help to explain the density of the work, if not excuse the author for a somewhat pedantic fascination with the arcane. The term "arcane" seems appropriate to a reader in the 1970s who is asked to probe a text that deals principally with German ba- roque drama. Scenes from the plays of Opitz, Gryphius, and Lohenstein do not quickly- or even slowly-come to the mind of such a reader. But for Benjamin, these dramas provide the phenomenal key to a Platonic reminiscence of the Idea of tragedy (Tragodie) in distinction from the Idea of the mourning play (Trauer- spiel). In Benjamin's view, these "metapercep- tual" ideas work rather like Leibnizian monads, each mirroring in itself the world conceived historically and consequently the other (pp. 45- 48). The Platonic-Leibnizian machinery adopt- ed here, however naively, is not utterly gratui- tous, for Benjamin is responding to a very real problem. How can a Socratic inductive defini- tion hope to tell us what tragedy is when the sampling itself predetermines what our answer will be? His central thesis is that just such inductive procedures obscured the distinctions which set German baroque drama, the Trauer- spiel in particular, apart from antique tragedy on the one hand and the neoclassic ideal on the other (pp. 38-39). Also contributing to this obfuscation is the fact that major literary his- torians of the baroque like Stachel looked to baroque literary theory, essentially Aristotelian in nature, more than to the plays themselves to construct their story. Consequently, the Trauerspiel appears as an "incompetent renais- sance of tragedy" tracing an ill-shaped figure of the classic pattern (pp. 49-50). The differences which Benjamin draws be- tween Trauerspiel and tragedy are many, but central and illuminating the others is that be- tween the classic hero and the protagonist of the mourning play. The latter is one of two types, often appearing in one man. He is either a prince who is martyred by faithless friends or enemies, victimized by political in- trigues of one sort or another, or a tyrant whose actions are of greatest consequence, and for that reason of high importance, though lacking in the moral grandeur required for true heroic quality (pp. 69-72). The martyr is unlike the hero in that his sufferings glorify God rather than himself, and as he is portrayed in the Trauerspiel our attention is not drawn so much to his deeds as to the dimensions of his physical suffering (p. 72). Like Socrates, the martyr goes to his death without defiance. He 103</page></plain_text>
