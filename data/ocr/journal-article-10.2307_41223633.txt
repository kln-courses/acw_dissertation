<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sabir culture and coastal Yemen during the second millennium ВС - the present state of discussion Burkhard Vogt and Alexander Sedov Compared to other regions of south-west Arabia, the knowledge of the archaeology of Yemen's coastal plains was for long scant indeed and the history of its research was largely dependent on the political developments of the then two Yemens. Ignoring the discovery and cleaning of the famous, allegedly pre- Islamic tanks in Aden during the mid nineteenth century, it was only in 1923 that Forbes mentioned in her mainly ethnographic account on the Idrisi territory several megalithic stelae sighted near Midi (Forbes 1923). Since the early 1940's Yemen's western coastal stretch of the Gulf of Aden was intermittently surveyed by the British. Hamilton's 1943 presentation of the archaeological sites of the then Western Aden Protectorates offered important archaeological observations in the Aden-Lahj Area including a first description of the site of Sabir (Subr). Harding (1964) and Doe (1960-61; 1965; 1971) surveyed the Aden hinterland and the Abyan oasis while Cambridge (1966) was the first to report a couple of shell middens from the Aden area. In 1970 Bernadelli and Pannello published a first report on Hajar al-Ghaymah, an impressive henge site near Hais. This was later supplemented by another short study carried out at the same site by de Bayle des Hermens (1976) including the first publication of a couple of Early Bronze Age (or earlier?) potsherds. The Red Sea Tihama archaeology was then intensified during the 1980's when the Canadians (Ciuk &amp; Keall 1995) started their mostly Islamic surveys and excavations in Zabid and its vicinity. Until the early 1980's scholarly interest in Tihama archaeology was rather peripheral and sporadic. This changed abruptly when the south-western province of Saudi Arabia (including the Saudi Tihama) was studied in some detail and Zarins and others (Zarins, Murad &amp; Al-Yaish 1981; Zarins &amp; Zahráni 1985; Zarins &amp; Al-Badr 1986) published the results of their soundings carried out in the extensive shell midden site of Sihi near Jizan north of the Saudi- Yemeni border. Soon, an Italian Mission started archaeological and palaeo-environmental studies focusing on the al-Hodaydah-Lohayah area (Tosi 1985; 1986; Marcolongo &amp; Palmieri 1992) while an American expedition surveyed the Palaeolithic occupation of the Bab al-Mandab region (most recently Whalen &amp; Schatte 1997). A major obstacle for the plotting and understanding of the ancient site distribution proved to be the ongoing change in the geomorphology of the area and the coastlines in particular (compare Marcolongo 1992; Tosi 1985; 1986). For example, this played an important role in the yet uncertain identification of ancient port sites as mentioned by the classical authors. At present three larger archaeological projects are devoted to the study of the Tihama: the joint German-Russian excavations in Sabir since 1994, the British mission to al-Hamid and most recently the soundings of the Canadian Expedition in the al- Fazzah Area.

A vast scatter of surface pottery was discovered in 1932 but the site has received little attention by archaeologists. Doe reportedly carried out a small rather unrewarding sounding and published a first collection of Sabir pottery (Doe 1960-61). A mid- first millennium ВС date with Palestinian parallels was suggested by some archaeologists such as Albright and Van Beek, but the site remained untouched until 1994 mainly because of the alleged lack of architectural remains and the presumed late date of the surface material. Sabir is located in the delta of the Wadi Tuban some 4 km south of the present oasis of al-Hawta / Lahj and some 25 km north of the city of Aden. Its location provides easy access through the Wadi Tuban and the nearby Wadi Bana to the Yemen highlands (Taizz / Ibb Area) and to the north-east. Sabir's surrounding is nowadays characterized by a number of oases surrounded by the gravel fan of the Wadi Tuban, overlain by extensive fields of sand dunes and several cultivation areas which benefit from the say/-related accumulation of fertile sediments. A similar landscape can be suggested also for the pre-Islamic period. The site, a rather flat area with about a dozen low elevations of barely more than 3 m height, is said to expand for more than 6 km (Hamilton 1943) - an observation that has not yet be verified.2 In fact, we can confirm only an extent of about 2 km by more than 1 km. The contours of the site are veiled by accumulated sediments, sand dunes and modern constructions and plantations. Two attempts at geomagnetic surveys have failed miserably due to the high content of magnetite that was probably emitted long ago from the volcano at Aden. Our different test soundings and large-scale excavations within the area have, however, started to show that the site is in fact a veritable tell with cultural deposits of at least 4 to 5 m. We have discovered that these deposits must once have reached an even more substantial volume. Towards the end of the occupation human activities developed on thick layers of sand which were successively deflated leaving behind a very dense carpet of broken pottery and other artefacts. Now this process has come to an end sealing and thus stabilizing the surfaces. Three deep soundings (Sabir 8A, Sabir 8C and Sabir 2B) plus the excavation of septic tanks dug by the villagers provide evidence for a horizontal stratification. In particular, the lower sections show a sequence of pottery layers, followed by beds of washed-in gravel and superimposed blown or washed-in sand and fertile silts. Brunner (pers. comm.) has therefore suggested that ancient Sabir was exposed again and again to heavy floods and that after such events parts of the site were temporarily abandoned. All our deep soundings have failed so far to produce any evidence for permanent dwellings in the lower parts of the sequence. At present, durable architecture seems to be confined to the top layers. Our excavations also provide first results about the horizontal organization of the town. Certain areas - perhaps representing the periphery of the site - were occupied by simple hut constructions made of perishable materials such as palm ribs, leaves or wood. Trench Sabir 14A is a good example: layer after layer, patterns of post-holes were unearthed as evidence of oval or round ground plans. Between these, fireplaces, querns and grinding stones and many bone tools were found as well as a large number of cooking and huge storage vessels, the latter sometimes in groups of almost thirty specimens (Sabir 14B). Large mud-coated woven palm rib constructions have been excavated also in Sabir 1 and Sabir 2A. What we consider the core area of the ancient town is marked in its upper layers by extensive, sometimes even monumental mudbrick architecture. Here we find, for example, dwellings consisting of small rooms around one or several inner courtyards (Sabir 25). Although often quite well preserved, their walls consist of a single line of mudbricks of usually uniform size. Small houses with only a few rooms can be found in many sectors of the ancient town such as in Sabir 12 or Sabir 7. A spatial organization similar to Sabir 25 can be assumed for the industrial area of Sabir 2. Occasionally, we may find a residential area, for 262</page><page sequence="3">THE SABIR CULTURE AND COASTAL YEMEN DURING THE SECOND MILLENNIUM ВС FIGURE 1. Schematic plan of complex Sabir 5 example 2 A, (i.e. an inner court surrounded by smaller rooms), which later was overlaid by a kiln site for the mass production of pottery. A second industrial area probably with workshops for metal- smiths is signaled by a strong concentration of ashes and bronze crumbs on mound Sabir 6 at the northeastern periphery of the site. A major focus of our excavation is the area of Sabir 5 where segments of a vast monumental complex of minimum 55 m by 40 m have been exposed (fig. 1). Slightly raised on earlier deposits and with at least one side furnished with a kind of mudbrick glacis, • the complex indicates some basic planning: Laid around several courts and enclosed by a common external wall are three independently accessible buildings. These units are characterized by mudbrick and timber constructions with walls of double thickness. The buildings are organized as halls of two or three naves sometimes adjacent to a small internal courtyard. One of the buildings, the heavily Burnt Building 5C, consists of a laterally built hall and a forecourt with two galleries and a central platform accessible on the southwest by a set of stairs. With its symmetry, proportions and layout of the main units the building anticipates to some extent the basic plan of South Arabian temples. Finds The number of finds from Sabir is simply overwhelming. Foremost among these is pottery; the majority is of local production and was found in all states of preservation throughout the stratigraphie sequences (Figs 2-3). The Burnt Building 5C offered some very interesting insights into the use of pottery. Here, three large ceramic deposits were discovered: the first was a spacious store containing about 150 263</page><page sequence="4">BURKHARD VOGT AND ALEXANDER SEDOV vessels of which some were empty and stacked in piles upside down, while larger vessels just next to them contained botanic remains. Two large nearby pits held many complete and empty vessels which, however, differ in shape and function from those in the storeroom. The pottery is made of a buff to red or brown fabric with a high amount of sand and mica temper. Straw temper is occasionally present but is almost as rare as the steatite-tempered paste. In general, the pots are very large but with surprisingly thin walls. Many appear to have been manufactured using a composite technique that combined hand-made bodies and wheel-turned rims and ring bases. Except for large-footed bowls, incense burners and small funnel-shaped beakers, all the vessels have a rounded base (Fig. 2). For the latter, high cylindrical stands were produced. Alternatively, the vessels were found sunk into the floors, wedged at the base with larger stones, or placed upside down. The spectrum of shapes is very large including mainly closed vessels such as globular jars, large bottles, giant pithoi etc. (see Vogt &amp; Sedov 1997). Unrestricted shapes are less frequent but include different kinds of beakers, bowls, plates, lids, the round-bottomed Sabir jars and fruit-stand-like vessels which are assumed to be incense burners (Fig. 3:9). The repertoire displays an unlimited variability of functional and decorative applications: spouts, ledges, lugs, handles, feet, perforations and fenestrations. In most cases the surfaces are well finished. Slips and washes are rare. The major decorative techniques are pattern burnishing both on the interior and exterior, incisions, impressed and appliqué designs. Painted geometric designs in white and red also occur but are rare. The next largest category of finds are terracotta figurines of which about 120 fragments have been discovered from all sections of the site. They include geometric objects (weights or gamestones?), a phallus, animals (mainly goats, sheep and cattle) and anthropomorphic figures. The majority of these anthrop- omorphic figurines are naked and obese women in a seated position with three folds of fat on the belly and tattoos on the thighs. Tools are usually made from obsidian or bone; metal is very rare but finds include a dagger, an axe and a couple of bolt-like projectiles. The faunal and FIGURE 2. representative collection of pottery vessels from Sabir 264</page><page sequence="5">THE SABIR CULTURE AND COASTAL YEMEN DURING THE SECOND MILLENNIUM ВС botanic remains collected from the Sabir excavations are presently under study but the very high quantity of shells and fishbones are quite significant. They suggest that the town's subsistence was not based just on irrigation (?) agriculture and animal husbandry but also on fishing. This is corroborated by several net-weights excavated. Trade and the industrial production of pottery were also important economic factors. Our material evidence from Sabir is dated by twenty-five radiocarbon samples to the period between the fourteenth and the early ninth century ВС (calibrated). However, these dates apply only to the top layers of the site. We have at least another 3 m of cultural deposits underneath.3 There is ample evidence that Sabir's end was violent. There are clear traces of destruction over almost all of the site - in particular there is evidence of a very heavy conflagration. Sabir's destruction in the early ninth century ВС can - for obvious chronological reasons - not be connected to the military campaigns of the Sabaean mukarrib Karibil Watar. He is supposed to have conquered and destroyed the kingdom of Awsan by approximately 700 ВС. Не is also said to have campaigned to Tubanaw which is mentioned as being to the south of Awsan and which can perhaps be identified with a yet unknown site in the Wadi Tuban, in an area where Sabir is also situated. We propose that Sabir was destroyed earlier than this date, perhaps by one of the rising South Arabian kingdoms which expanded to the south. The emergence of a culture Sabir is not the only site with the material assemblage described. Doe (1960-61; 1965; 1971), Harding (1964) and Cambridge (1966) published identical material from other sites in the Lahj Governorate, the Abyan oasis and from Little Aden. Our knowledge about this then limited local culture was suddenly expanded with Zarins1 1980 surveys and later soundings in the Saudi Tihama which led to the discovery of Sabir-related pottery from altogether 5 sites (Zarins, Murad &amp; al-Yaish 1981). The early 1980's also witnessed -although largely unnoticed - the discovery by an Italian mission of further sites indicating the same cultural horizon from Lohayah along the coast to Khawkha. Their surface finds were compared by Tosi (1985; 1986) with those from Sabir and from the Saudi Tihama and dated to the second half of the second millennium ВС. We are not reluctant to speak of a proper culture which - according to our present knowledge - extends as the crow flies for at least 600 km from the Abyan oasis to the west and then to the north along the shores of the Red Sea (Fig. 5). Lacking textual evidence of a name, we dubbed this culture the 'Sabir Culture' because the site of Sabir was the first to be reported. It is also the most extensively excavated, and largest, site of this culture. Sabir seems to combine several criteria which otherwise only characterize individual sites. What is shared by all these sites is not only the same distinctive material inventory (almost exclusively pottery and a few metal artefacts) but also a clear coastal orientation. We may distinguish between two major types of sites, camp and shell middens versus those with a clear agricultural background. Shell middens with Sabir pottery can be found along the Red Sea coast sometimes far inland or directly on the coast such as in the Aden vicinity. The best known shell midden FIGURE 3. representative collection of pottery vessels from Sabir, top layers. 265</page><page sequence="6">BURKHARD VOGT AND ALEXANDER SEDOV FIGURE 4. Early Sabir surface pottery from Miqhala Dar al-Haytham. site is Sihi in the northerly catchment of the Sabir Culture. The cultural deposits on top of a long sand dune measure only 60 cm in depth. They contained a large number of potsherds and complete ceramic vessels that were comparable to the surface finds from Sabir. A range of five radiocarbon dates was published which provided readings for a period from the late third to the mid-second millennium ВС (Zarins, Murad &amp; al-Yaish 1981; Zarins, &amp; Zahráni 1985; Zarins &amp; al-Badr 1986). In later papers Zarins lowered the dating of Sihi to the second half of the second millennium ВС although he did not produce any corroborating evidence. There is indeed a striking resemblance between the pottery types from Sihi and those from Sabir. This does not apply, however, to a very distinctive group of incised and impresso decorated pots which have no parallels in Sabir. These types were compared by the excavators to the so-called Kerma- and C-Group pottery found in Sudanese Nubia.4 The publication of the Sihi soundings stimulated a discussion which was first debated by Fattovich who drew comparisons with the pre-Axumite contexts in Ethiopia and Eritrea (Fattovich 1990).5 Although of little chronological value - the term "pre-AxumiteM is all but explicit - we tend to give a higher priority to stylistic comparisons with this latter area: Particularly the early (pre-Sabaean?) contexts in Yeha and Metara provide some convincing comparative evidence. The archaic layers of the port site of Adulis (Paribeni 1907: 145) and perhaps also sites of the Eritrean highland Ona Culture (Tringali 1973-77) yielded a very characteristic incised and impresso grey ware pottery that matches much better with comparable finds from Sihi.6 Altogether we have a stronger affiliation of Sabir pottery types with certain northeast African cultures than with any other area and that is surprisingly also true for comparisons with the rest of Yemen. Only two isolated fragments of Sabir pottery have, to our knowledge, turned up outside the coastal plains: they originate from the German Institute's excavations in the Awwam cemetery in Marib (surface) and from inside a temple building in Hagr 266</page><page sequence="7">THE SABIR CULTURE AND COASTAL YEMEN DURING THE SECOND MILLENNIUM ВС Yahir in the Wadi Marha (unpublished). These specimens are, however, significant: Together with the occurrence of a single sherd of Early Raybun painted pottery at Sabir they indicate an exchange system of unknown intensity with the northeast and the east but the evidence is admittedly very poor. The key for a more adequate assessment of the Sabir Culture and its roots certainly lies in the Yemen highlands. Thanks to the Italian excavations in the Hawlan and the Dhamar area the Bronze Age is sufficiently well established. The major monuments in the highlands of this period are settlements, sometimes of considerable size, and the above-ground turret tombs. This material horizon is dated through radiocarbon analysis to the third and early second millennium ВС. In terms of absolute chronology, the second and third quarter of the second millennium ВС is represented here only by the recently tested site of al- Sibal in the Dhamar Region (DS 66).1 Al-Sibal is in fact the second millennium ВС site that is closest to the Sabir cultural catchment. According to the body of excavated potsherds we can now state that there is no typologically significant relationship between these two areas (compare Wilkinson, Edens &amp; Gibson 1997: 119, fig. 13). At present we therefore suggest that the Sabir Culture is indeed an assemblage entirely confined to the coast. It is perhaps an African-inspired culture on Yemeni soil rather than one that has developed from the Bronze Age background of the highlands. Elsewhere the Hawlan Bronze Age seems to have been followed by a gap of several hundred years or, at least, by an almost complete lack of material evidence that ends around the mid second millennium ВС with the appearance of Semitic- speaking tribes migrating into Yemen perhaps from the northwest of the Arabian peninsula. They settled along the easterly desert fringes and successively in the Yemen highlands. Their material heritage soon manifests itself as a folly developed proto-South Arabian substratum that is well attested in Hajar Ibn Humayd, Yala and further to the east in Shabwa and Raybun. Descending from the highlands the Sabaeans entered - as the British excavations at al- Hamid demonstrate - the Tihama at the beginning of the first millennium ВС. We suggest that the Semitic-speaking groups could have coexisted for some time with the indigenous coastal Sabir population which was eventually absorbed or perhaps even expelled during the expansion of the South Arabian kingdoms in the early first millennium ВС. The origin of the Sabir culture in a highland Bronze Age tradition can at present be ruled out. Along the Red Sea Tihama and in the greater Aden Area no significant Early Bronze Age occupation has been detected so far so it is difficult to suggest that it was a local development. Too little is known about the Neolithic shell midden occupation studied by the Italians in the Lohayah / al-Hodaydah area to draw any conclusions. As to the emergence of the Sabir culture or its earlier phases, let us briefly return to our current fieldwork in the Aden hinterland. Two of our deep soundings at Sabir (Sabir 8A, Sabir 2B) produced a first and very provisional ceramic sequence which was studied by our team member V. Buffa. Both trenches provide first indications for a typological development. The upper part of the two trenches produced pottery that is already known from our large-scale trenches for example in the large public building of Sabir 5 (figs 2-3). There is, however, a marked change in the lower sections of the trenches. Four major stratigraphie, chronological, markers for the pottery of the earlier periods are: - a dense burnishing or even polishing on the outer and inner body - the appearance of what we call fake spouts -i.e. spouts without a hole - obliquely flattened inner rims and finally - the appearance of elaborate appliqué decoration. Our recent surveys in the neighbourhood of Sabir located on the route to the Aden coast three more large, and hitherto unknown, tells (Mishghafa, Ma'aleiba, Miqhala Dar al-Haytham). Their surfaces show the same deflation pavements of late Sabir pottery plus an increasing number of the chronological markers (fig. 4) as known only from the deepest layers of our Sabir test soundings. Furthermore we recorded a higher percentage of early pottery types as the distance from the sea decreased. This may indicate that the Sabir occupation in the area radiated successively inland from sites that were located closer to the littoral and thus more sea-oriented. The largely unstudied base of the Sabir settlement 267</page><page sequence="8">BURKHARD VOGT AND ALEXANDER SEDOV FIGURE 5. map with the maior Sabir-r elated sites. 268</page><page sequence="9">THE SABIR CULTURE AND COASTAL YEMEN DURING THE SECOND MILLENNIUM ВС and the new discoveries nearby may associate the beginnings of the Sabir Culture with the early second millennium or even with the third millennium ВС. Future fieldwork is therefore necessary to tackle the question if - despite its late end during the 9th century ВС - the Sabir Culture is truly rooted in a local and coastal Bronze Age tradition. Notes First preliminary results have been published in Vogt 1995, 1996, 1997 and in press; Vogt and Sedov 1997. Objects from Sabir (pottery, terracotta figurines and different tools) were shown in the exhibition 'Yemen - au pays de la reine de Saba1 in the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris. This is mainly due to anti-tank mines planted during the 1994 civil war. 3 Local villagers at Sabir have reported the discovery of potsherds found in their septic tanks at a depth of more than 20 m. This, however, is not necessarily a reliable source of information. Only a single fragment with incised, impressed and white encrusted geometric design has turned up in Sabir so far. It seems a better match with Pan Grave-related productions from Nubia. 5 Drawings of our Sabir pottery have in the meantime been shown to Fattovich who suggests some parallels with his third and early second millennium ВС Kassala sequence in eastern Sudan (pers. comm.). Other colleagues working in Sudan prefer to draw comparisons with pottery of the Pan Grave Culture or the Napatan Period. 6 A complete, imported impresso grey ware vessel and fragments of several others have also been discovered in Sabir. 7 Wilkinson, Edens &amp; Gibson 1997: Table 1: The authors published two 2 a corrected radiocarbon dates based on radiocarbon samples which read 3600 ± 80 BP (2145-1735 ВС) and 3100 ± 120 BP (1620-1005 ВС).
