<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Moment before God. By MARTIN HEI- NECKEN. Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press, 1956. 386 pages. $5.95. Few books written by contemporary theo- logians combine the acuity and enthusiasm that this one does. Its author, Martin Heinecken, is professor of systematic theology at Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. His book is written out of a pervading conviction that Soren Kierkegaard's understanding can be used to clarify and to instrumentalize the theologi- an's responsibility to describe what Christianity really is. The volume is Heinecken's theological position and simultaneously an interpretation of Kierkegaard's authorship. Certainly on both counts it is important. As a theological position it is, among other things, a restatement of a Lutheran view. But there are differences between this Lutheran po- sition and most others. The author is philo- sophically adept. He knows the strictures sug- gested by analysis of the limits of knowing, of logicality, of the functions of language, etc. Therefore, his book uses many of the technical strengths of Kierkegaard and tightly articulated rules of inference, with which many theologians are impatient, to discuss theological issues. The most striking difference between this volume and many Lutheran documents is this patent analytic and categorical grasp. Here is theology that is closely reasoned and, within limits, co- gently argued. A similarity to Lutheran tradi- tion that might seem restrictive to many readers is the omission of many of the social, political, ontological, and even psychological considera- tions that enliven so much of recent theological writing. But this restriction of the field again, whether characteristically Lutheran or not, en- ables Heinecken to do excellently by both the New Testament and the requirements of cogen- cy. I, for one, find theology in such terms less dashing but more efficacious, both religiously and intellectually. This is not to say that this is a perfect book -by no means-but there are few, if any, glit- tering generalities about the classical view of man, the Renaissance, communism, the cosmos, or the tendency for good in the universe. It is altogether pleasant and fitting that even theo- logians should not be intellectual pontiffs but rather journeymen, exemplifying that kind of integrity and care which befits a limited aim. Heinecken has been well taught and remem- bers always what he knows and what he does</page><page sequence="2">130 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION not know. Hence neither his own religiosity nor the person Jesus Christ is the occasion for wispy thought. Heinecken's interpretation of Kierkegaard is more difficult to assess. Surely he is one of the few authors who realize how radical, how fun- damental, Kierkegaard really was. Instead of using Kierkegaard as a brillant commentator and exotic source material, Heinecken agrees that, if he was right in what he said, all kinds of views are wrong. For this reason, if for no other, The Moment before God is an able piece of schol- arly interpretation. But one difficulty, perhaps an omission or maybe a mistake, pervades the entire treatment of Kierkegaard. Little atten- tion is paid the fact that Kierkegaard recog- nized two dialectics, two describable ways in which oppositions juxtaposed themselves before human beings and demanded high-level atten- tion. All that Heinecken says about paradoxi- cality and the absence of implicative transitions which might lead to God is deceptive because these two kinds of dialectic are not always clearly distinguished and/or utilized in the exposition. Kierkegaard's point in that logical compe- tence can be practiced only disinterestedly. This latter word is important. Logical rules hold only between "essences," i.e., things as they are when defined, when known, when detached by an ab- stractive act from the locus of existence. The re- lations between essences must be non-contra- dictory and necessary, etc. But to be a person means also having interests and passions and concerns. It is Kierkegaard's merit as a thinker to have seen the difference between the con- frontation of interests, one with another-this he called the "existential dialectic"-and logical opposition, that described by "cognitive dialec- tic." What Heinecken neglects, especially in chapters ii and iii, is Kierkegaard's subtlety in describing Jesus Christ as the absolute paradox. For Jesus is paradoxical precisely because he is the object of interest and passion, faith or of- fense, and also an object who can be disinterest- edly described. The point is that both kinds of language, that of passion and that of dispassion- ateness, must be used to describe him. Though I have no mission to save Kierke- gaard from his friends, it does seem to me im- portant to remember, too, that Kierkegaard be- lieved that some interests were universal in bearing and that the anthropomorphic posture described by the ethical stage in his literature is precisely what is offended by Jesus Christ. Hence the universality of the offense does not inhere solely or strictly in illogicality or in vio- lation of universal rules governing discourse ex- cept in so far as even discourse reflects the com- mon human interests. Heinecken seems to me to simplify this issue overly much, and thus his book does not quite do justice to Kierkegaard's intellectual exactitude, on the one side, or to the richness and complexity of his psychological insight, on the other. For one thing, to say this is not to say that paradoxicality is only a recog- nition of the contrariety to received opinion. Kierkegaard did not believe ethicality was only opinion-this is the point made by his doctrine of the stages-and to root the contrariety as he does denies neither the universality of the pro- test nor the involvement with the logical and reflective capacities of people. This may seem a trivial point. But to read Heinecken and Kierkegaard is to realize all over again how essential it is to keep paradoxicality handy; for to omit the paradoxical is to lose the Savior. But simply because it is so important, especially in our day when so many alien ener- gies in a society can be turned to the manipula- tion of Christian enthusiasm, it might be wise to take a rather long look at this question. If the theological renaissance of our day is to be evan- gelical and directive toward Jesus Christ and him crucified, it seems appropriate to suggest that this fundamental question-for it is the is- sue of faith and reason all over again-be given maximal attention. Heinecken's book is good enough to argue with, and perhaps little more need be said. PAUL L. HOLMER University of Minnesota</page></plain_text>
