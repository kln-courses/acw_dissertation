<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philadelphia Museum of Art Sir Edwin Landseer Sir Edwin Landseer (1803-1873) invigorated British animal painting by means of epic drama, social commentary, guessing-games, solemn allegory, wit and anthropomorphism. His paintings epitomise Victorian sensibility, and the recent exhibition of 158 works at the Philadelphia Museum of Art provides the first opportunity to assess his oeuvre in depth since the Royal Academy's memorial exhibition of 1874; at the Tate Gallery 10th February to 12th April. The smaller Landseer exhibitions of 1961 (London, Royal Academy of Arts) and 1972 (Sheffield, Mappin Art Gallery), and Campbell Lennie's bio- graphy of the painter (1976) suggested only some of the range and issues of his art. Landseer never learned to link his backgrounds spatially to his foregrounds, and his paint is sometimes dry and grey. But in Philadelphia, Landseer never- theless emerges as a brilliant master. He could rival Turner in the depiction of brute natural force (Deer and Deerhounds in a Mountain Torrent, 1833, no.38), and create universal icons of life and death that equal and prefigure those of G. F. Watts (A Random Shot, 1848, no.123). Works such as the white-on-white Ptarmigan (1833, no.37) display a rarefied command of colour, and images such as The Last Run of the Season (Fig.54; 1851, no.98), in which the viewer stares down at a cornered fox, are as psychologically intense and harrowing as anything in English art. Troubling for the modern public, however, is the fact that the beasts are as human as ourselves. Dying saints are somehow more compelling than dying Saint Bernards. The tradi- tional hierarchy of subject-matter, or the recollection of infantile animated car- toons, or the desire to uphold the distinc- tions of our own species encourages resis- tance. But if these biases are overcome (perhaps by recalling the horse and bull of Guernica and Franz Marc's Fate of the Animals), the exhibition becomes a grip- ping revelation of a serious painter. A few of Landseer's major works are absent (e.g., Stag at Bay, 1846, and Dialogue at Waterloo, 1850), and the 1850s are sparsely represented, yet Landseer's development, variety, peaks and depths are still brought forth with clarity. The cool anatomical studies of his youth, the dashing narratives of the 1820s in the vein of Sir Walter Scott, the classically stable compositions of the 1830s, the polished and colourful Royal commis- sions of the 1840s, and the majestic allegories of Landseer's later years are all substantially present. The chronological hanging of the paintings is relieved at points to form enlightening groups linked by genre, theme or patronage. The exhib- ition catalogue contains an excellent biography by Richard Ormond, in which the stress and artificiality of the artist's incessant intercourse with the aristocracy are portrayed. Landseer's recurrent fits of depression (the first appeared in 1840) are not fully explained, but the complex- 57</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT AND FORTHCOMING EXHIBITIONS ity and contradictions of his personality and social life are examined. A man who could joyfully disembowel deer every autumn and also paint the mournful vision of a dying stag called The Sanctuary (Fig.55; 1842, no.121) is not a simple character. Conflicting emotions on the same theme are apparent in The Death of the Wild Bull (Fig.53; 1833-36, no.78): Lord Ossulston stands as conqueror, with one foot on the dead beast, but the facial expressions and figural arrange- ment suggest a Lamentation. Landseer's influence on Gericault, Delacroix, Courbet and Bonheur, and his dependence upon Rubens, Snyders, de Vos and Teniers are briefly analysed by Joseph Richel in another catalogue essay. His suggestion that the seventeenth- century Dutch painter Abraham Hon- dius, rather than C. D. Friedrich, may have inspired Landseer's visionary arctic landscapes (e.g., Man Proposes, God Dis- poses, 1863-64, no.151) is convincing, but Landseer's sources and proper interna- tional and domestic contexts have yet to be completely defined. Earlier British and Continental sporting painters dif- fered fundamentally from Landseer. George Stubbs, Sawrey Gilpin and James Ward may have endowed animals with passion and the dignity of history painting, but Landseer portrayed ani- mals in human r6les, with human personalities (and sometimes human clothes), and not just as symbols of savage power. Landseer's origins lie in Hogarth's Self-portrait of 1745, where Trump the pug assumed the character of the artist, and in the first two plates of The Stages of Cruelty (1750), where Hogarth expressed deep sympathy for animal suffering. The blurred line be- tween man and beast had advantages. Unlike other artists Landseer could freely treat the tense issues surrounding the Reform Parliament. A Jack in Office 1833, no.62), which depicts an arrogant mutt's defense of his gnaster's meat cart against the snarls and pleadings of half- starved dogs, presents a view of society's inequality that in more human guise might have been unacceptable. And if one doubts that Landseer was seriously concerned with social ills, one need only study his scenes of Highland poverty and hopelessness (e.g., The Stonebreaker, 1830, no.33) to be convinced. Not all of Landseer's paintings are grim and woeful. Alexander and Diogenes (1848, no.144), painted at a period when classicism was at low ebb, wittily trans- lates an anecdote from Plutarch into dog language, and Suspense (1834, no.63) plays with open-ended narrative in a manner that looks forward to Yeames's 'problem pictures' of the 1880s. Despite the dry sophistication of such works, a cloud of pathetic sentimentality hangs over the exhibition. The Old Shepherd's Chief Mourner (1837, no.66) is not to be forgotten. Yet even those tear-jerkers should be seen anew and in context. They were meant to break down hard- heartedness, to make one feel the pain of others, and innumerable Victorian ser- mons advocated such cathartic experi- ences, for the Christian soul was reborn in tears of pity and sympathy. The sob story was the nineteenth-century Protes- tant's substitute for the Andachtsbild. The religious underpinnings of Landseer's art become evident in the late works, most notably The Baptismal Font (1872, no.158), in which a shining pyramid of sheep and doves symbolizes salvation. The catalogue entries by Richard Ormond and Robin Hamlyn provide not only new documentary material which significantly augments the early Land- seer studies by F. G. Stephens [1874], A. Graves [1876] and C. Monkhouse [1879], but also illuminating discussions of such subjects as the influence of Wilkie, sadis- tic imagery, the political references of The Swannery Invaded by Eagles (1869, no.156), and the Romantic conception of Scot- land. A major artist at the very heart of nineteenth-century culture has been viv- idly brought to light. KENNETH BENDINER</page><page sequence="3">. . . . . . . . ...... Mail ..Jw. 'Am AA I *12WO X:X. A.
