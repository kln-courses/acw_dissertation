<plain_text><page sequence="1">HSIANG-KUO-SSU AN IMPERIAL TEMPLE OF NORTHERN SUNG ATLEXANDER C. SOPER So LONG as its vitality remained high, Chinese Buddhism blossomed in every age into great temples whose magnificence was the wonder of half Asia. For more than a thousand years the process of creation continued at an amazing level, with a superabundance of energy which seemed to find a stimulus in the very impermanence of its achieve- ments. The life of the most splendid monument might be tragically brief, and destruction by war or imperial reaction an inevitable part of the his- torical pattern; from that very loss a succeeding generation derived the priceless opportunity to recreate beauty and majesty in its own terms. The records of every famous ancient monastery are an alternation of good fortune and disaster, a literal application of the phrase hsing-fei J) by which the Chinese epitomize history. Burned and pillaged in the chaos at the end of one dynasty, it would be revived with the new stability of the next, often on an even grander scale. The great monasteries of the capital cities, owing their size and wealth and artistic value to direct imperial patronage, were almost as intimately associated with the pres- tige of the throne as was the palace itself; their reestablishment by a new regime, and their main- tenance at the proper imperial level of sumptuous- ness, were dynastic responsibilities. If many great names disappeared with the passage of time, if a shift of capital deflated the properity of an ancient metropolitan region, other establishments grew up elsewhere, to set new standards of devotion to the faith. The process was so much a cultural con- stant, and was effective over so long a period, that it must have come to seem a part of the eternal order, destined to continue forever. Long after the curve of Buddhist progress had begun to turn downward, the actual decline in quantity and quality of national effort was doubtless perceptible to only a few Chinese, so brilliant were the levels still maintained. Study of the foremost city monastery of the Northern Sung period, Hsiang-kuo-ssiu lTBH in the capital, Pien if (modern K'ai-feng-fu RjJ , Honan), demonstrates both the extra- ordinarily high standard of achievement still pos- sible in its time, and an early stage in this long decline. As an establishment of considerable age and sanctity, built up during successive dynasties and blessed in Northern Sung by the personal interest and generosity of several devout emperors, Hsiang-kuo-ssui had of course an imperial size and magnificence. Its buildings were famous in an age of great architecture. Their equipment of icons, altar furniture, and decorations must have ex- hibited in extreme degree the material and imagi- native richness of the period. Above all, for an age of aesthetic sophistication, the monastery was of first importance because of its wall paintings, executed by the most celebrated religious artists available to imperial summons, painstakingly pre- served, and celebrated even beyond the Chinese frontier. At the same time, evidence clearly indi- cates in all this a recession from the T'ang crest. The number of major Buddhist monasteries in eleventh century Pien was well below that of Ch'ang-an in the eighth, doubtless reflecting the shrinkage in surplus resources between the pan- Asiatic empire of T'ang and the clipped and harassed Sung state.l The supreme effort of the Sung Painting Academy in Buddhist art was channeled into a single monastery, where the T'ang with midsummer prodigality had scattered Wu Tao-tzui frescoes everywhere. The quality of the precious Hsiang-kuo-ssii paintings, finally, must have been recognized by thoughtful critics of the time as a stage of ebb-tide. The best balanced and most comprehensive contemporary historian of Sung painting, Kuo Jo-hsii t;:[r, admits in his T'u Hua Chien Wen Chih IJJt that the great age of religious art was past; that "Wu Tao-tzui's work had become the standard for all time," and that the later men who studied him 1A detailed inventory of frescoes in the Buddhist and Taoist establishments of Ch'ang-an and Lo-yang is fur- nished in the standard history of early Chinese painting, Li Tai Ming Hua Chi Ift I I (III; hereafter referred to as LTMHC) by the mid 9th century scholar Chang Yen-yuan qAjA ,. 19</page><page sequence="2">SOPER: Hsiang-kuo-ssi, an Imperial Temple of Northern Sung and the other T'ang masters could never equal their accomplishments.2 In all departments of orthodox Buddhist art and architecture the period of great advances lay in the past; the Sung effort, there as in Buddhist doctrine in general, was one of continuation, minor variation, and enrichment. The autumnal character of accomplishment at Hsiang-kuo-ssui is not too pronounced, however, to detract from its interest as a historic monument. The data available today to describe the state of the monastery in the eleventh century are fairly copious, though insufficient to form a completely detailed picture. From their analysis emerge a number of facts of importance in the development of Buddhist architecture and iconography in China, covering a period to which very little notice has been paid by scholars in any language. It is my intention to present here such evidence as I have been able to accumulate; first to lay out a historical background for the Sung establishment, then to illustrate the physical form of the monastery and discuss its position in Chinese architectural his- tory; and finally to describe the Sung sculpture and frescoes with their iconographic implications. A convenient collection of contemporary refer- ences to Hsiang-kuo-ssui is provided in the standard historical and geographical guide to ancient K'ai- feng compiled by the sixteenth century antiquarian Li Lien e :, the Pien Ching I Chi Chih t;.jr^Se . *His account of the monastery opens with a resume of its history, as follows: 3 "Originally known as Chien-kuo-ssii |[ when it was founded in (555) under the Northern Ch'i; later abandoned. In T'ang (the site) was the residence and garden of Cheng Shen Hlnm] . At the outset of the Ching-yiin era (710-12) under Jui Tsung, a wandering monk named Hui-yiin saw in the rear garden pool a reflection of a Buddhist monastery.

It so happened that just at that time the enthronement of Jui Tsung had taken place; and since the latter had previously held the fief of Prince of Hsiang IB (in H:onan), he gave the monastery the title of Hsiang-kuo-ssui, 'the monastery of the realm of Hsiang.' In (745) Hsiian Tsung erected the Tzui- sheng Pavilion i_ , the East Pagoda called P'u-man -S: , and the West Pagoda called Kuang-yiian gI . . .' 4 4The most detailed account of the foundation of Hsiang-kuo-ssui appears in the biography of Hui-yiin contained in the Sung Kao Seng Chuan ~*A- , a collection of late T'ang and Five Dynasties monks' lives completed by priest Tsan-ning _t in 988 (available in the Japanese Tripitaka, Taiz6kyo, 50, no. 2061). Here it is told (XXVI, p. 874) that Hui-yiin happened to be spending a night outside K'ai-feng in 701, and saw a strange radiant phenomenon in the sky along the north bank of the river. He entered the city to seek an ex- planation; and as he was wandering along the bank, looked down into the garden of the magistrate of She- chou (At~J (Anhui), and saw reflected in the pond a Buddhist monastery in all its architectural and icon- ographic details. Vowing to answer the happy omen, he took up residence in the local monastery of An- nieh-ssiu ~ j~, and set to work to mould and cast an image of Maitreya (choosing that Buddha probably because the vision seemed to him like the palaces of the Tusita Heavens). In 710 he enshrined the icon tempo- rarily in a corner of An-nieh-ssu, and purchased a site for its permanent home on the north side of another existing establishment, Fu-hui-ssu gf . Excavation there uncovered an old stele with the name of the Northern Ch'i emperor, which proved that the area had belonged to the vanished Chien-kuo-ssui; the old name was therefore adopted, and work was pressed with redoubled enthusiasm. In 712 the project was faced with disaster by an imperial order that all monasteries not registered and imperially named should be destroyed and their metal icons turned in. Facing the prospect of imminent action by the President of the Board of Punish- ments, Wang Chih-yin 3Ef'Lf::, as Imperial Inquisitor, Hui-yiin prayed in tears before his image, beseeching Him to vouchsafe a sign. Thereupon a golden radiance streamed from the Buddha's head, illuminating Heaven and Earth. The whole city flocked to the altar to see, and there miracles occurred; the blind were made to see and the dumb to speak. These portents were reported to the throne by the inquisitor; the emperor himself was visited by a miraculous dream, and in consequence adopted the temple, giving it a name associated with himself . . . The "great Cloud-sweeping Pavilion" was erected in 745, and the East Pagoda under Su Tsung in the late 750's; construction was finished only in 775 by 20</page><page sequence="3">SOPER: Hsiang-kcuo-sSil, an Imperial Temple of Northern Sung I interrupt Li Lien's historical summary to inject a text which gives some idea of the degree of prominence already attained by the monastery under the T'ang emperors; i. e. a list of the pos- sessions of which it then boasted. The source is Kuo Jo-hsii's painting history again; a section in his chapter V describing the "ten perfect things " t+ belonging to Hsiang-kuo-ssui, and quoted from a temple stele of unspecified date which by connotation was certainly T'ang and probably eighth century. The first of these was "the sacred visage of Mi-lo, whose radiance illuminates Heaven and Earth, cast by the monk Hui-yiin at An-nieh-ssui Tai Tsung. The biography concludes: "All existing buildings date after the fire of the Ta-shun era (890-92). T'ai Tsf of Sung restored it; the wall paintings from the brush of the Han-lin Edict Compiler Kao I t were in their day considered marvels of draftsmanship and ink- handling." A note on the late T'ang fire and subsequent rebuilding is contained in the biography of priest Chen- chiin Jr t (847-924) in the same work (XVI, p. 810). "In (891) there was a general conflagration at Hsiang- kuo-ssfi; the multi-storeyed ._i? Triple Gate, the Seven Treasures Bnddha Hall, the Cloud-sweeping Treasure Pavilion, the Manju?ri Hall, and the interior corridors, about 400 bays rg. in all, were reduced to ashes." The disheartened brotherhood begged Chen-chiin to return as their abbot; and under his leadership succeeded after several years in "rebuilding corridors, aisles, and halls in added beauty." Also see note 5 below. I have been unable to identify the Cheng Sh8n named in Li Lien's account as proprietor of the temple site prior to its acquisition by Hui-yiin. An individual of the same name, known for his artistic proclivities, is mentioned in LTMHC X and in the biography of the Imperial Prince Fan e in T'ang Shu XCV; but the dates given in the latter for his official career fall in the 760's, two generations too late. Another version of the name, equally unidentifiable, is Ch8ng Ching -A; this appears in an account of the temple's foundation given in the early Sung account of Five Dynasties painting, Wu Tai Ming Hua Pu I _ftj{[tjj by Liu Tao- ch'un 1l]J4 [, referred to in note 5 below. The inquisi- tor Wang Chih-yin is well known to history, with biographies in T'ang Shu C and Hsin T'ang Shu CXXVIII. He was popularly known as "the black eagle," for he looked at men as a bird of prey will watch a swallow or sparrow. As might be expected, neither version of his life mentions any connection with Hsiang- kuo-ssfi, nor even any disciplinary action against Bud- dhist establishments in general. The attempted repres- sion was apparently too brief and limited in scope for mention in the histories; as Weiger notes, however (Textes Historiques, Hsien-hsien, 1923, p. 1394), the famous Nestorian inscription in Hsi-an-fu also records a persecution in 712. g?|j|^ in the reign of Chung Tsung of T'ang (705-10)." The second was a name tablet in- scribed by Jui Tsung himself with the characters Ta-hsiang-kuo-ssiu. The third, the work of the master craftsman Wang Wen EjL, was the laying on of gold dust and flesh color over the sacred visage, and also the pair of benevolent deities inside the Triple Gate.5 The fourth was a painting by Wu Tao-tzu of the figures of Wen-shu (Manjusri) and Wei-mo-chieh (Vimalakirti) inside the Buddha Hall.6 The fifth was a donation of nine bays of 5 Probably statues of the pair of protecting demi-gods called Jbn-wang _ i, shown as wrestlers nude to the waist. An 8th century version survives under the Middle Gate of Horyuji aJ~.9- in Japan (fig. 3). A paragraph on Wang Wen is included in a (chronologically extra- neous) supplement on famous sculptors in Wu Tai Ming Hua Pu I (quoted by Chou Ch'eng with title reference only to the anthology Wang Shih Hua Yilan m KHt-J in which it is published). He was "good at orna- mentation and coloring RVI,1, so exquisite in his accomplishments and so wondrously skilful that his has been the master hand of all time." The paragraph includes further details relative to the foundation of the monastery: notably that Hui-yiin went to Yang- ch'eng-ssu in P'u (Hupei? R Jg A ) and obtained a model ; of an auspicious Mi-lo image, 18 feet in height, which he brought back to An-nieh-ssui and had cast-the name of the caster having been forgotten; and that the minions of the Imperial Inquisitor attempted to pull down the statue, but were unable to budge it in the slightest degree. Finally Wang Wen's share in the work is praised. "Anyone who regards the coloring of this golden image (will see) a holy visage perfectly imbued with every sort of great compassion and great sympathy. Its gravity of countenance and its utter sincerity are perfectly suited to the appearance (of the Buddha) in His coming terrestrial incarnation, and to the idea of salvation. Again, when one looks at the usn.sa and the hair, where the only color is that of glass, or at the body's aureole with its thousand myriad million precious jewels, displaying their majestic beauty, it is impossible to deny the success of Wen's achievement. Connoisseurs say that ornamentation gives wings to a statue; such is truly the case here." 6 One of the earliest subjects of Chinese Buddhist art, based on the popular Vimalakirti-satra (translated seven times between the 2nd and 7th centuries). Illustrations of its central incident, the visit of the Bodhisattva of Wisdom with his celestial throng to the aged philosopher, are numerous among early Buddhist steles, and among Tun-huang frescoes from late T'ang to Sung.

The sixth was the cloud-sweeping Treasure Pavilion, as rebuilt by the master crafts- man Pien Ssii-shun 410i by command of Ming Huang in (745). The seventh was a painting by Shih Pao ;f 7 of a realm-protecting, calamity- dispelling cycle 8 inside the pavilion along its west end. . . . The eighth was the painting of a Heavenly King in the Western Storehouse, exe- cuted by Che Tao-cheng :iZj9 by imperial command in (725) at the time when the feng sacrifice was performed on Mt. T'ai; this being done after an iconographic cartoon J of P'i-sha- men (Vaisravana), Heavenly King of the North, which had previously been secured (by the artist) on a journey to Khotan made by command of Ming Huang.10 The ninth was the work of Hsiang Shih jiF 7 in painting the figures of Fan-t'ien Tonkoga no Kenkya (A Study of the Tun-huang Paint- ings), Toky6, 1937, pp. 143 ff. The biography of Hui-yiin quoted in note 4 says that Wu executed these figures as statues |t . 7 Not otherwise known in painting history. 8 The most likely source of this fresco is the uvarnam- prabhasa-sutra, Chin Kuang Ming Ching *&amp; P; ), influential in China since the mid Six Dynasties period (successive translations in Taiz6kyo 16, nos. 663, 664, 665). The crucial chapter, entitled "The Four Heavenly Kings," retails the promise of those divinities to lead a countless host of lesser spirits to the aid of any monarch who rules in accordance with the True Law and reverently and whole-heartedly accepts the sutra; acting always as unseen guardians to dispel calamities and to defend the realm against foreign assaults. The protagonist before the Buddha is the Heavenly King of the North; the latter's celebrity at Hsiang-kuo-ssf makes it likely that he and his cohorts were selected as protectors, rather than the divine forces advertised in other similar sutras. LTMHC III records that a cycle of the Chin Kuang Ming was painted by Wu's pupil Master Li for a Pure Land Precinct in Ch'ang-an. T'ien-kung-ssiu ^ jf in Lo-yang had a "calamity-dispelling cycle" by Wu himself which may have been based on the same source (and which may have been the prototype for the Hsiang-kuo-ssf fresco). Briefly cited in LTMHC X, in company with Kao Chiang jlI as fellow portraitists; Ch6 being "good also at Buddhist subject matter, with a clear, simple draftsmanship and a vigorous brush." 10Ming Huang probably stopped at K'ai-f6ng on his way down river from Lo-yang; T'ang Shu VIII, 13th year of K'ai-yiian, merely gives terminal dates for the journey, and describes events at Mt. T'ai. The Khotanese Lokapala type imitated was probably distinguished first by its long, close-fitting armor, derived from Iranian coats of mail. See von Lecoq, A., Bilderatlas zur Kunst und Kulturgeschichte Mittelasiens, Berlin, 1925, figs. (Brahma) and Ti-shih (Indra) inside the gate- way,1l as well as a votive cycle of the twenty-eight chapters of the Lotus Sutra 12 on the inner side of the partition of the east cloister corridor. The tenth was the work of the monk Chih-yen Tt 7 in painting the ' Steps toward Salvation by the Three Ways' =*[S 3 jAMft{ 13 on the north wall of the Western Storehouse." To continue with Li Lien's historical summary: "In (1001) Chen Tsung of Sung added on wing corridors Aii and the 'tower' I; in front of the Triple Gate. The bronze images of the Five Hundred Lo-han were obtained from Ying-ch'uan- chiin HJli||J (Honan) and were placed in an upper storey of the pavilion.

Iconographic evidence for the type has been care- fully studied by Matsumoto Bunsaburo [f '_J. in his recent Bukkyo-shi-zakk6 {fJtjk (Tokyo, 1944), under the heading " Tibatsu-bishamon" 9t^AJ ir ~ : the name by which the type is distinguished in Japanese source material. The 9th century cave frescoes at the oasis of An-hsi jtg near Tun-huang contrast this Central Asian version with a Chinese Heavenly King; see Warner, L., Buddhist Wall Paintings, Cam- bridge, 1938, pls. xii, xiii (terminal date of 901 given by a visitor's inscription). 11 Several times painted in gateways of the capital temples by more famous artists; see LTMHC III, for An-kuo-ssui i4f f and Shng-kuang-ssui Wj| . 12 Of the many subjects available for illustration in the Lotus Sutra, the most famous is the scene in its 4th chapter in which fakyamuni materializes a jewelled stipa; which on opening reveals His own figure seated beside that of an identical Buddha of the past, Pra- bhftaratna, on "lion thrones." Others, derived from the chapter on Avalokitesvara, retail his promise to rescue believers from every sort of danger, or describe his 32 miraculous transformations. The chapter on the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra shows him in glory with his celestial host. The first two in particular were favorite subjects with the Tun-huang ateliers. These and other sources of pictorial cycles are discussed by Ono, G., ~,l,j;rjI in his Bukky no Bijutsu to Rekishi fAft0 $if I Tokyo 1937, pp. 48ff. See also Matsumoto, E., op. cit., pp. 110 ff. 13The "Three Vehicles," or three ways of seeking salvation, are those (in ascending order) of the gravaka, or obedient disciple; the Pratyeka Buddha, or Arhat, who has won perfect enlightenment for his own sake; and the Bodhisattva, whose hard-won perfection is devoted to the rescue of all creation. Chih-yen's fresco was probably a series of narrative episodes illustrating these three typical careers.

At the present time the Hall of the Sacred Visage, uniquely perfect in its construction, is a building (inherited from) ancient times." The brevity of Li Lien's outline is doubtless explained at least in part by the complete absence at Hsiang-kuo-ssu in his day of a type of historic evidence elsewhere of great value. He explains that although he had read in his youth of a great number of memorial steles as still standing before the Great Hall, when he finally visited the mon- astery he found only two or three left, and those so damaged as to be indecipherable. The text of one other Hsiang-kuo-ssii stele has been preserved in later sources, however, a so-called " Restoration of Hsiang-kuo-ssu " by the Sung scholar Sung Po T. .14 This is to be found in both Ch'ing dynasty local histories dealing with the old capital region, the K'ai-feng-fu Chih i ff]3 ji of 1695 (XIX, under the then current name Ch'ung-fa-ssu iN. - ), and the Hsiang-fu-hsien Chih -jjJg$,= (XIII). Presumably it had been removed from the temple before Li Lien's visit, perhaps by some enthusiastic antiquarian official, and was later re-discovered. The following extract from the text deals with the physical form of the monastery in early Sung. "T'ai Tsui changed Feng-ch'an-(ssu) jfit- to K'ai-pao-(ssu) I]TH ; T'ai Tsung granted Lung-hsing-(ssu) qj# the name T'ai-p'ing i+Z:, and also founded the Buddhist monastery of Ch'i-sheng :], and so made the Upper 14 Graduated as chin-shih in the Chien-lung era (960- 63); in the Yung-hsi era (984-88) was employed with other noted scholars in the compilation of an imperial anthology of literature.

Capital a truly splendid sight.15 At Hsiang-kuo- ssu, however, the imperial command merely erected the Triple Gate and granted a title inscription in the imperial handwriting; the rest was not yet fully completed. The undertaking was therefore carried on privately by officials of the palace, who secured an architect and craftsmen of every sort and piled up a mountain of materials. (By this means), the Main Hall was set up, with its wings spreading out 3 ]; also the long corridors, the (building on) the left for the bell termed a 'tower I and that on the right for the sitras called a 'treasury ' J, the multi-storeyed pavilion at the rear, and a minor gateway f~p3 pushed through to the north.

The picture of the fully developed Hsiang-kuo- ssu of later generations is most broadly drawn in two complementary eye-witness accounts.

Hiei and had risen to be abbot of a suburban Kyoto temple, Daiunji *3cS . Crossing to south China in 1072, he visited the mountain head- quarters of his sect on the mainland, as well as many other major monasteries lying along his route. At the Sung capital he was well received by the emperor, loaded with gifts, and lodged in the imperially founded T'ai-p'ing-hsing-kuo-ssii ~ZtCpf~j+gl, an establishment whose special func- tion of translating newly acquired Buddhist litera- ture into Chinese made it an appropriate meeting ground for monks of many nationalities. In 1073 Jojin was granted the signal privilege of praying for rain in the palace at a time of great drought.17 His success in this trial brought him further honors, and although his companions returned to Japan he himself remained in China until his death. His record of the state of China in the eleventh century, necessarily abbreviated, has still the typical Japanese observer's virtues of keen observation and meticulously accumulated detail. Of his first visit to Hsiang-kuo-ssui in the autumn of 1072 he mentions the following:18 "Left the precinct (i. e. the Ch'i-sheng-ch'an- yiian PfgR ? in the suburbs of K'ai-feng), and made our way to Ta-hsiang-kuo-ssu; a distance of about eight li to its Great Gate, a four-storeyed pavilion 1f. Went in through a side entrance PF9, being served tea in the gate building. First wor- shipped at the Great Hall of Mi-lo, where there is a sixty foot 19 Buddha (flanked) on the west by Mi-t'o (Amitabha) and on the east by the thousand hundred myriads (form of) Shih-chia (Sakya- muni); 20 the splendor of the ornaments most 16 Accessible in the modern anthology Dainihon-bukkyo- zensho f ~ *{$-p~~ , section on pilgrimages Yuahden-s6sho Etfjq&amp;&amp;, III, Tokyo, 1932. 17 Ibid., pp. 450 ff. 8 Ibid., pp. 394-95. 19 Probably a transposition of characters; sixteen feet was the canonical height for non-colossal statues. 20 A reference to the historic Buddha in non-historic, Mahayana terms. The type understood is the Buddha after His enlightenment, expounding the Law under a bodhi tree. According to the " Sftra of Brahma's Net," Fan Wang Ching Jt*#g II, the Adi-buddha Vairocana sits on a lotus throne with 1000 petals; on each petal are a hundred myriad realms, each with its own Buddha wonderful. Next worshipped at the Great Hall of Lu-she-na (Vairocana), The connecting corri- dors ~iJ on left and right are each five bays long, and have great stones seven feet or so high standing (along them), incised with (the text of) the Hua Yen (Ching), (Avatams'aka-sutra) MA04A}* ; *.21 The four-sided corridors are each about 200 bays (long).22 Next we ascended the Great Hall's high pavilion :* CJNi~IJ , and worshipped the Five Hundred Lo-han, life-sized figures colored gold, with a central, life-sized icon of Shih-chia (Sakyamuni) and so on. Burned incense. In the 'tower' to the west there is a Wen-shu (Manjusri) treasure shrine Vi(f, com- plete with lion, attendants, etc. In the 'tower' to the east there is a P'u-hsien (Samantabhadra) treasure shrine, complete with white elephant and attendants. "Next we worshipped at the Hall of the Buddha's Tooth, an imperial emissary opening the imperial seal (placed thereon). This is called ' The Precinct of the Flower of the Dharma,' Fa- hua-chih-yiian - 1jJt ; it lies to the west out- side the courtyard quadrangle. In the center is a Hall of the Seven Treasures t-B J. Within this building is a high altar. Upon the altar is a treasure shrine WtR of pure gold, two feet high and two and one-half feet wide. Inside this is a treasure pavilion ~f of pure gold, two and eight-tenths feet high and two and three-tenths feet wide. Inside this there is a coffer &amp; of pure gold, one foot wide and one high. Inside this there is a reliquary Mr-F of pure gold, with adorn- ments like those of (the precinct previously mentioned, the) Ch'i-sheng-(ch'an)-yuan, (where there was another Buddha's tooth). Dimensions of the tooth are the same also, as are the ceremonies under a bodhi tree. Such ideas were clearly the source of the iconographic type preserved in the colossal Dai- butsu *f{ of Todaiji in Nara, Japan. 21 Jojin also writes ft for the conventional f in the title of the Buddha's Tooth Precinct. These slabs were probably those referred to in the biography of the Hsiang- kuo-ssfi abbot Tsun-hui *t3, Sung Kao Seng Chuan XXVIII, p. 884. A great revival of interest in the Avatamsaka began there in 937 with the arrival from Wu-t'ai of a specialist in its exposition, the "Great Master" Chi-yung |jg. The whole establishment set to work and engraved a section of the sutra on stone, running around three sides of the Lecture Hall (prob- ably the rear pavilion). 22 See below p. 31. 24</page><page sequence="7">SOPER: Hsiang-kcuo-ssii, an Imperial Temple of Northern Sung performed. The reliquary has two imperial seals 23 23 References to this relic are scattered through an abbreviated history of the Chinese Buddhist church, the Shih Shih Chi Ku Liieh *V]tgj~b by Ts'ui 1n- ch'Sng j?J@ p of Lo-yang, dated 1355 (Taizokyo 49, no. 2037). Its first Chinese possessor was the T'ang dynasty Vinaya master (Tao-)hsiian Ff. A notice in the year of his death in 667 (IV, p. 818) states that one night he suddenly found his solitary devotions being guarded by a youth in full armor. When questioned, the latter identified himself as a son of the Heavenly King Virupaksa; proved his supernatural nature by answering seriatim all questions about the Buddha's life and Nirvana; and presented the tooth to Tao-hsiian as a reward for his career of teaching monastic discipline. A later notice for 983 (p. 861) is entitled "the Imperially Eulogized Relic." Here it is said that Sung T'ai Tsui obtained the tooth from Lo-yang and installed it in the Ordination Precinct of Hsiang-kuo-ssu. His successor T'ai Tsung, doubting, tested it by fire; and finding it still clear, hard, and radiant thereafter, com- posed a eulogy, and increased the honors paid it by rebuilding the pavilion in which it was enshrined. At the same time the title of the precinct was changed to that recorded by Jojin; presumably the worship of the tooth was made its sole function, and the previously used Altar of Ordination was moved elsewhere. Other notices, for 998 (p. 862) and 1043 (p. 866), refer to eulogies composed by Chen Tsung and Jen Tsung respectively. A longer church history, the Fo Ts4i T'ung Chi tf4Tf by priest Chih-p'an d:&gt; in 1269 (Taiz6kyo 49, no. 2035) states that Ying Tsung ordered a stele set up in Hsiang-kuo-ssfi, to serve as a permanent record of these three eulogies (XLV, pp. 413, 414; LIII, p. 460). The same source unfortunately complicates research by recording elsewhere that the Vinaya master Tao-hsiian's tooth was one of the treasured possessions of another monastery, a Ch'an establishment variously referred to as K'ai-sheng-ch'an-ssiu $Jjig and Ch'i- sh6ng-ch'an-yuian. As between the two claims, I should suppose that the latter is in error. The logical reposi- tory of a relic associated with the name of the greatest Chinese teacher of Vinaya would have been the capital monastery which possessed an Altar of Ordination-a prime instrument of monastic discipline-rather than a center of Dhyana practise; in addition, although none of the imperial eulogies at Hsiang-kuo-ssu mentioned Tao-hsiian by name, the T'ai Tsung text contains a literary reference to the "Southern Mountain," Nan- shan [j 1 (Shensi) which is certainly an allusion to the area of his chief religious activity and to his hon- orific title of Great Master of Nan-shan. The further confusion between K'ai-sheng-ch'an-ssui and Ch'i-sheng-ch'an-yiian merits a digression. The former title appears twice in the Fo Tsu T'ung Chi (pp. 398, 464) with similar wording to the effect that an imperial order was issued to erect K'ai-sheng-ch'an- ssu (in 980) to enshrine the auspicious Indian sandal- wood image of King Udayana, the tooth of the Buddha Sakyamuni, and the true body of Chih-kung of the Liang dynasty (see below, p. 41 and note 94). Another cita- tion in the same text (LIII, p. 460) runs: " T'ai Tsung built Ch'i-sheng-ch'an-yiian for the holy auspicious Udayana image and the tooth of the Buddha Saky- amuni." It seems probable that these two were the same establishment, and that the original title was altered in favor of a more auspicious initial character. It is under the latter name that Jojin mentions seeing a rival Buddha tooth under imperial seal, while he never mentions a K'ai-sh8ng-ch'an-ssii among the monasteries of the capital. The Ch'i-sheng-ch'an Precinct is again named in the Japanese account of the history of the Udayana image which "explains" its eventual transfer to Sh6ryoji MfiM* outside of Kyoto, the Muromachi period Shakado-engi f*j4H3_ (available in the anthology Zokugunshoruiju i j ffi 27/1, 789, pp. 388 ff.; also in resum.e in Mochizuki, p. 2118; illustra- tions attributed to Kano Motonobu Heeffi ). Here the familiar story is retold that Sakyamuni visited the Trayastrimsas Heaven to convert His mother Maya; that His earthly followers fell into deep distress at His absence; and that the attempt of King Udayana to have His appearance transferred to sandalwood was made miraculously successful by a god in the guise of a master sculptor. The "history" continues with (1) transfer of the image to the Central Asian realm of Kucha in 316 A. D. to escape an anti-Buddhist persecution; (2) its seizure there by the Chinese expeditionary force under Lii Kuang Mi in 384, and its transfer to Ch'ang-an, with the kidnapped Indian sage Kumarajiva; (3) its seizure by the raiding troops of the southern dynasty of Eastern Chin in 417, and transfer to Kiangnan; (4) its appropriation by Sui Yang Ti, and installation in the Yang-chou temple Ch'ang-lo-ssiu A-f (later K'ai- yiian-ssii |Ii7 ); (5) its appropriation by the first Southern T'ang prince in 939, and installation in his capital Chin-ling |g; (6) its seizure by the Sung forces in 975, and transfer to Pien; to be installed first at K'ai-pao-ssi, then in the imperial palace, and finally in Ch'i-sheng-ch'an-yiian, newly turned from an imperial villa to Buddhist use; (7) arrival of the Japanese pilgrim Chonen ])] in 983, fired with the project of securing a copy of the image to take back to Japan; (8) second intervention of the craftsman god, first to make the copy identical, and then to effect a transposal of the two statues so that the original might go back to Japan; (9) subsequent history in Japan. J6jin in his record of Ch'i-sheng-ch'an-yiian mentions only that he "worshipped at the Eastern Great Hall, burning incense before the image of Sakyamuni" (p. 394). If the legend that Japan had acquired the original Udayana statue was already current in his time, he may have tactfully avoided a more precise wording which would have posed the problem, since his diary was both intended for Japanese readers and always liable to Chinese censorship. It should be remembered that the extravagant local claims about the Udayana image were categorically denied by the great mid 7th century Chinese pilgrim Hsiian-tsang j, who saw the "original" in India and stated that all others were copies; see translation by Beal, S., Buddhist Records of the Western World, London 1906, I, p. 235, II, pp. 322 ff. 25</page><page sequence="8">SOPER: Hsiang-kuo-ssi, an Imperial Temple of Northern Sung . . .

"The 'tower' gate at Hsiang-kuo-ssui is a building of the T'ang period. At the outset of this dynasty, the architect Yii Hao ~ re- marked, 'They were certainly capable enough (in those days); the only thing is, they didn't under- stand how to curve up their eaves :~ (toward the corners).' 32 Whenever he went to the foot 28 See below, p. 42. 29 See below, p. 42. so Kuei-tzfi-mu, or Hariti, was an anthropophagous she-demon, who was converted by the Buddha and turned her powers thereafter to the defense of the faith.

Hence worshipped as a guardian deity; and incidentally also, because of her vast number of sons, as a helper in childbirth. 31 Brief biographical notice in CK Jen Ming TTT, p. 1083. 32 The question of the development of eaves curvature in China is a complex one, still largely unsolved. Visible evidence for T'ang wooden architecture on the conti- nent-e. g. the Tun-huang frescoes, or the 8th century (of the building), he would look up and stare at it.

The late thirteenth century Kuei-hsin Tsa Shih ^ t* ` by Chou Mi ),J 33 remarks: "The towers and pavilions of Pien city were extremely lofty. Those who had seen them praised (in particular) the Tzui-sheng Pavilion of Hsiang-kuo- ssu, the pavilion of the Chao-yiian Palace _t3 , and the Soaring Clouds 'Tower' 7 %t. The Tzui-sheng Pavilion had an elegant beauty, with five eaves to drip water. It was there (that they housed) the bronze Five Hundred Lo-han from lintel drawing from the Ta-yen Pagoda *#KSf in old Ch'ang-an (Soper, figs. 75, 50)-show eaves of an un- compromising straightness. Early remains in Japan which cannot be suspected of alterations during re- building-the miniature 7th century Tamamushi shrine and 8th century Kairyuoji gE- pagoda (ibid., figs. 61, 62)-possess a clear, though restrained curva- ture. Perhaps the distinction was a regional one. Chinese evidence is exclusively from the north, where curvature has always been relatively timid. Japan's first strong cultural lessons from China came through the Korean kingdom of Pekche out of the southern dynasties of Liang and Ch'en; i.e. from a region in which the presently visible tradition, stretching back for many centuries, has been one of bold curvature. It is quite possible that a southern practise was carried north at the beginning of Sung by the renowned Hang-chou architect Yii Hao himself. The 11th century scholar Ou-yang Hsiu EWilkF remarks in his Kuei-t'ien-lu BlI i that "the dynasty has so far produced one unique architect, Yii Tu-liao jiV (i. e. Hao), who has laid down the law to all the others. His 'Canon of Carpentry' *k in three chapters is current at the present day."

The last-named individual was a general whose distinguished services extended over the reigns of three emperors, from the last ruler of Posterior Chou to T'ai Tsung. His biography in the Sung History, CCLX, states that he participated in the southern campaign in which T'ai Tsui "pacified" the Kiangnan regime; and at that time " obtained five hundred iron Lo-han from Tung-lin-ssui j ;If, 34 on Mt.

I have been unable to trace the history of these Lo-han prior to their removal, except for the following. The late Northern Sung scholar Yeh Meng-t'e ~~ (chin-shih in the Shao-sheng era (1094-98), Han-lin appointee under Hui Tsung; official biography in Sung Shih, CCCCXLV) amplifies the story of the removal in his Shih Lin Shih Hua tk -Sj. - He begins by telling a well-known story of his own generation: that in the midst of a great summer drought in 1077 Shen Tsung dreamed of a monk riding through the air, spitting clouds and vapor; that it rained copiously on the morrow; and that when the emperor in wondering gratitude had an image of the miracle-worker made after his description, it turned out to be the portrait of none other than the 13th of the 500 Lo-han in the Hsiang-kuo-ssfi gate building. Yeh continues: "These Hsiang-kuo-ssfi Lo-han originally were products 4f of the Li regime in Kiangnan (i. e. the Southern T'ang principality, 939-75), having been at Tung-ling-ssfi on Mt. Lu. Ts'ao Han (after his) defeat of Kiangnan did his utmost to carry off the gold, silks, and precious articles in the city. He had a hundred or more vessels joined together and surreptitiously loaded for his return, to avoid public talk. He also made off with the Lo-han, each boat holding ten or so images. These he presented to the throne, (whereupon) it was decreed that they be granted to Hsiang-kuo-ssu. At the time they were known as the' trussed-up {E4p Lo-han '." The confusion as to which set of 500, the gate's or the pavilion's, came from Tung-lin-ssfi was a natural product of human forgetfulness. Buddhist History." 35 The existing major buildings are apparently all of the eighteenth century, and neither in character nor in disposition recall the Sung layout. The one apparent iconographic link, a Hall of the Five Hundred Lo-han, is now octagonal and low-sprawling. According to the dictionary Tzi Hai Sit the monastery was finally secularized and made a permanent public market in 1927. ANALYSIS OF ARCHITECTURE If visible remains yield no further clues to the appearance of Hsiang-kuo-ssui at its time of greatest glory, much of the architectural form can be reconstructed from an analysis of texts alone. Following a virtually inflexible rule of Chinese monumental planning, the monastery faced south; and like almost every formal group on level terrain at any date, was laid out symmetrically about a north-and-south axis. Along this median line of approach stood four major buildings: two gateways, a Main Hall enshrining a Buddha triad, and the Tzui-sheng Pavilion. Both gateways had triple openings, and so were at least five bays wide.36 The outer, corresponding to the element called the Great South Gate A*[pq in T'ang monasteries, doubtless was the "'tower' erected in front of the Triple Gate" by Chen Tsung in 1001. As an imperial monument in the capital city, it should properly have been more imposing in scale than the other gate building, which as a survivor from the ninth century 4 had been erected when K'ai-feng was merely a pro- vincial city. The Sung age seems to have carried to a climax a passion for verticality long growing in the Chinese aesthetic sense; for the period involved, there is nothing exceptional in Jojin's note that the Great Gate was four-storeyed, and provided a breath-taking view from its top. I know of no such great multi-roofed gate structures surviving in China today. Something of the effect may be imagined from secondary evidence available in Japan.

The grandeur of the idea remains even in the simplified two- storeyed form. A sketchy record of the four- storeyed type of building in general is visible in the pictorial notes made of thirteenth century Ch'an architecture by the Japanese pilgrim Gikai 1Jr (fig. 2).37 The inner gate, corresponding to the T'ang Middle Gate 4tfq, apparently dated from a period of general rebuilding in the 890's, after Hsiang- kuo-ssui's first great fire. Its eighth century pre- decessor had been "multi-storeyed" Ot, with perhaps three floors; 4 the late T'ang building, put up without imperial assistance, may well have been two-storeyed like the form introduced to Japan in the seventh century and there standardized (fig. 3). Meng Yuan-lao's description mentions two "bottle-(shaped) glazed pagodas" flanking the outer gateway. These were probably miniatures at either side of the gate staircase, standing some- what like the pair of tenth century date at Ling- yin-ssiu t -, Hang-chou.38 For protection they were probably on the court side. Their form was apparently a version of the type called Pao-t'a fI, frequently represented in the panoramic frescoes of Tun-huang.

In the latter, copied from an eighth century Chinese prototype, the body is a cylinder rounded off at the top (fig. 4). The common ancestor is clearly the late Guptan stifpa, as seen frequently at Ajanta.40 By the outer Triple Gate the visitor must have passed through the exterior wall of Hsiang-kuo-ssii, and have entered the first court. No text mentions any feature of this area, which in later Chinese monasteries was to contain small, isolated" towers" for the bell and drum. Doubtless it was closed on east and west by the walls of subordinate pre- cincts. On the north its limit was the colonnaded corridor surrounding the main quadrangle, and the inner Triple Gate. Within the second court stood the two principal halls of worship. First on axis was the Maitreya Hall. In all probability this conformed to a monu- mental main-building type long used in Chinese architectural tradition, irrespective of whether its purpose has been to serve as a throne hall in the imperial palace or as a center of Buddhist, Con- fucian, or Taoist ceremonies.41 The proportions of the hall emphasize a massive horizontality, though the interior may rise to a high ceiling. There is only one storey, but the enormous bulk of the main tiled roof is usually supplemented by a narrow, skirting roof which runs around the outer aisle. Several very large buildings remain from the Sung age to give a general idea of the type. Most of these are Chin dynasty erections in the far North, put up by Chinese craftsmen inherited with the territory seized by the Tartars.41 The middle Chinese imperial style of K'ai-feng may be ima- gined as a compromise between them and a south Chinese survivor, the Taoist Main Hall of the Yiian-miao-kuan [ 1frJ# in Su-chou, which has retained the essentials of its erection in 1179 through many restorations (fig. 5).42 The "wing corridors" noted for the Main Hall published.

The second hall, northernmost of the major elements along the central axis, had the radically different proportions implied in the character kco ]j, which I have translated "pavilion" for want of a more precise word. A ko is a multi-storeyed building which is at the same time a relatively large oblong in ground plan. The latter charac- teristic distinguishes it from both its multi-roofed cousins; clearly from the pagoda, t'a i, with a square plan drastically shrunken to gain over- powering verticality; and, by a less obvious demar- cation, from the " tower," lou 4, which falls between these extremes and may overlap each. The Tzii-sheng Pavilion had five roofs, and as one of the great landmarks of the capital must have dominated even the towering South Gate. Jojin's phraseology in referring to the "Great Hall of Lu-she-na " might be misleading, if it could not be checked by other descriptions; these make it certain that Buddha was worshipped in the spa- cious ground floor of the pavilion, while the better known group of Lo-han were installed in an upper storey. As to the number of floors, there may have been actually five; on the other hand a design current in Sung might have faced each upper storey with a balcony sheltered by its own narrow roof under the eaves of the larger, and with this scheme the storeys might have been only three (fig. 6). Jojin's description of the pavilion contains details which raise an interesting problem. In connection with the Lo-han statues in an upper storey, he goes on to mention two groups of icons centering on the Bodhisattvas Manjusri and Samantabhadra which were located in western and eastern "towers" respectively. His habit of meticulously recording stairs ascended makes it obvious that these were not isolated constructions; in addition no such separate buildings are men- tioned by any other writer. The probable explana- tion is furnished by a dilapidated but still im- pressive monastery of Northern Sung date, Lung- hsing-ssu flji at Cheng-ting-hsien JE,K between K'ai-feng and Peking.43 Two symmetri- 43 Discussed in Chinese by Liang Ssui-ch'eng MJ1fi in CK Ying Tsao HSHK IV/2, Sept. 1933, " The Ancient cally placed elements in this design show the two- storeyed pavilion in pure Sung form (fig. 6). The building at the rear, in a lamentably ruinous condition and surfaced with Ch'ing details, still suggests its original function as an even loftier pavilion, designed to house an (extant) bronze colossus of Avalokitesvara. It is three storeys high, with main and balcony roofs making a total of five, and boasts the poetic title "Buddha-per- fume Pavilion " (~ ;. At each end it is linked to a lesser building, oblong in plan, narrower, and rising only two storeys to its own crowning roof (fig. 7). That on the west is called the Chi-ch'ing Pavilion |Jk " of Thronging Blessings," while the eastern twin is an "Imperial Library" gl]kh. Both are Ch'ing in their present state, but there is no reason to object to the supposition that they existed as well in Sung times. The same basic design of symmetrical wings, called "ear halls" Uf( in modern Chinese, is standard in the Liao and Chin Main Halls still extant further north.44 There they are naturally scaled to the relatively low, single-storeyed proportions of a Buddha Hall; the two at Lung-hsing-ssu must have been pushed up into the air to suit the ver- ticality of a pavilion. Each has its largely independent structure, and is at the same time dependent on the central building, with which it must communicate by the balconies.45 I suggest that such a triple pavilion stood at Hsiang-kuo-ssui, and was there used (probably on the second floor level) to present an elaborate iconographic scheme Architecture of Cheng-ting Hsien "; also by Tokiwa and Sekino IV, pp. 173 ff. 44 Examples in CK Ying Tsao HSHK IV/3, June 1934, "Report on the Ancient Architecture of Ta-t'ung." 45 A monastery plan of T'ang date, cited as that of the original Jetavana in India, is given in a treatise on the proper method of setting up an altar of ordination by the 8th century Ch'ang-an priest Tao-hsiian ^I, the Kuan C6hung Ch'uang Li Chieh T'an T'u Ching q34 il AJ/ {. r (Taizoky6 45, no. 1892, pp. 807 ff.). Here both the Buddha Hall and the Lecture Hall behind it are flanked by isolated " towers," three and five- storeyed respectively. The Hsiang-kuo-ssti scheme seems to have been developed as a fusion of these terminal units (the T'ang monastery had an independent Man- jusri Hall; note 4) with the attached "ear halls." In the Ch'ing dynasty Lama Temple in Peking, isolated "towers " are joined to the high rear pavilion by aerial bridges. Any such unusual design at Hsiang-kuo-ssu would certainly have attracted Jojin's notice and would have provoked a record. 30</page><page sequence="13">SOPER: Hsiang-kuo-ssui, an Imperial Temple of Northern Sung combining Sakyamuni and the Arhats in the central block, and his two associated Bodhisattvas in the wings. Jojin's phrase which I have translated "con- necting corridors," watadono SiVJ, is a Heian Japanese term which in this case must refer to the same sort of east-and-west colonnades that were furnished to the Maitreya Hall as a sheltered means of approach. I confess myself unable to reconcile the five bays of corridor on each side which he mentions, with a total cloister dimension of two hundred bays on a side. The latter figure seems fantastically large. The supreme Japanese attempt to rival Chinese standards produced at Todaiji a cloister which is only about thirty bays across, exclusive of the central gateway. Either Jojin's first thought of his figure of two hundred as a circumference, and recorded it otherwise through carelessness, or the number has been mis- transcribed in later copying from his manuscript. North of the pavilion there was a rear court- probably quite shallow-with a minor gate for exist at the center. The Hsiang-kuo-ssii elements not present on the main axis are more difficult to settle in place. The pagoda precincts inherited from the original T'ang plan must have occupied their then orthodox position, in front of the Middle Gate and balancing each other with a distance between greater than the width of the cloisters (fig. 8).46 Perhaps they were entered directly from the outer court. The Buddha's Tooth Precinct on the west, with its own cloisters and high pavilion, was probably a major interruption in the symmetry practised else- where, and had no counterpart on the other side of the axis. More puzzling is the problem of certain minor elements normally tied closely to the central monu- mental group. Sung Po's stele, describing the monastery at the beginning of the eleventh century, speaks of a Bell Tower and a Satra Storehouse as standing on left (east) and right (west) respec- tively; and by the order of his presentation implies that they occupied symmetrical positions in the cloister court between the two main halls. This had been the relative position of the same elements in the T'ang style.47 Jojin in 1073, speaks of an 4' See Soper, pp. 49 ff., 64 iff. 47 Ibid., pp. 24, 50, 134, and note 231, figs. 7, 10, 11-15, 76. The mid 9th century "Record of Monasteries and Eastern Sutra Storehouse Precinct; 48 while a con- temporary history of early Sung painting, Sheng Chao Ming Hua P'ing iaR ?S, records that the priest Yiian-ai ;cS, a court portraitist under T'ai Tsung (r. 976-98), painted in the Western Sutra Storehouse Precinct.49 Possibly the original bell and sutra buildings were smallish two-storey constructions on the lines of the north-and-south corridors (as they came to be in a tenth century re- building at Horyfiji J.q&amp; in Japan; fig. 9).50 Since the formal equation of the two elements in the general plan was a contradiction of their actual spatial needs, the sutra library may have extended into buildings on the outer, west side of the clois- ters, justifying the name "precinct," yian jF, from the start. Presumably the rapid multiplica- tion of Buddhist literature, through new transla- tion and especially by exploitation of the new printing process, made it necessary later to provide a second library complex, which the Chinese love of parallelism set on the east outside of the central court. In the earlier Chinese monastery designs adopted in Japan in the seventh and eighth century, the formal group may be continued behind the second hall of worship (at that time a Lecture Hall), to provide a refectory on axis and a symmetrical rear dormitory complex.51 On this point the Hsiang-kuo-ssui evidence is completely negative. The layout of Hsiang-kuo-ssii, in its historic implications, is a clear case of the survival of a T'ang ground plan. The most striking indication of this is the presence of twin, balanced pagoda precincts; an idea foreign to Indian Buddhism, without doctrinal justification, and economically practicable as a monumental gesture only in an age of boundless wealth. The fashion seems to have been created at the T'ang capitals, and was trans- planted to contemporary Japan, where it won grandiose embodiment in the great Nara monastery of Todaiji (fig. 8).

The provision for two main halls of worship, both on the central axis, seems to have been one of several schemes tried out in the eighth century. It appears in a Japanese copy at Saidaiji *ik:#, a (now-vanished) Nara monastery completed around 780.53 What was probably a tentative version of the contrast at Hsiang-kuo-ssui between the pro- portions of the two, was at Saidaiji the difference between a single-storeyed Yakushi (Bhaishajya- guru) Hall in front, and a two-storeyed Miroku (Maitreya) Hall behind. The mid eighth century Tziu-sheng Pavilion, described as " cloud-sweeping," may well have been even higher. Possibly it was of the same type as the great main building seen by the Japanese pilgrim Ennin fNt: in 840 at the "Gold Pavilion Monastery," Chin-ko-ssui S~tjN , on Mt. Wu-t'ai; which was nine bays wide, and rose through its three storeys to a height of more than a hundred feet.54 The Sung age represents in Chinese architec- tural history a phase of completion comparable to the High Gothic, as the T'ang has many of the simpler, sturdier characteristics of the Transition. The eleventh century architects, though they respected the inherited general plan of Hsiang- kuo-ssui, erected buildings on the old bases in their own style, doubtless in the rich repertory of struc- tural and ornamental forms codified in the official North Sung architectural encyclopedia Ying Tsao Fa Shih *J2t5.32 Outside of a general increase in decorative emphasis and the innovation (at least in north China) of eaves curvature,32 the principal advance of this code over that of the T'ang was in its treatment of eaves bracketing. Specific changes were: first, a recognition of the principle that the bracketing complex, which 52 Ibid., pp. 48, 64-66. 63 Ibid., pp. 59, 60. 4 Recorded in his travel diary Nitt6-guho-junrei-gy6ki ,AH:J~Jjfit; available in Ythloden-s6sho I, p. 239. previously had been used only at the top of the column, might be repeated in the inter-columnar space where it was supported by a beam only (fig. 6). Later centuries were to multiply these intermediate units until the effect, in Ming and Ch'ing, became that of a continuous plastic cornice (fig. 7). The second modification was a more efficient handling of the slanting bracket arm, ang , which now became a true lever in its balancing of interior and exterior weights; might be doubled, for greater strength and visual effectiveness; and was usually visible on the exterior as well, as a dynamic design element.55 A general aesthetic impulse of the Sung age is evident in its exaggeration of gateway and pavilion heights. Little concrete evidence remains to show the effect of this stress on verticality, since it was never imitated in Japan, and later Chinese genera- tions lapsed to a less strenuous level. Its best demonstration is probably the group of pavilions at the rear of Lung-hsing-ssiu, already cited (figs. 6, 7). ANALYSIS OF PAINTING AND SCULPTURE: Of the two prime sources of information re- garding the celebrated Hsiang-kuo-ssu frescoes, the earlier Shzeng Chao Ming Hua P'ing provides fuller detail for the first generation of Sung activity, while the T'u Hua Chien Wen Chih of the 1070's covers a wider period. I shall quote either below where its account is more valuable than the others. The paintings noted fall roughly into the following chronological subdivisions, by artists: 1.

The four-character phrase fr*ri l?f which termi- nates Kao I's reply to the emperor has the compact terseness which is the bane of translators. Light is thrown on its approximate meaning by comparison with other texts in which the first two characters appear in more readily definable use; describing a period of planning and organization of ideas which should precede the physical act of painting. This is particularly clear in the quotation cited under ming i in the dictionary Tza Hai, as follows: the Hua Chi la, a continuation of the THCWC by the mid 12th century T8ng Ch'un S5, says of the painter Sung Fu-ku l,T-ft (i.e. Sung Ti fl ) that "among his 'eight views' (of Hsiao and Hsiang Aj ), his 'Twilight Bell from a Smoke-(veiled) Monastery' and his 'Night Rain on Hsiao and Hsiang' are themes practically impossible to present . . .

The Central Asian(?) Ts'ao, active in China around 575, was the classic practitioner of the "Indian" style, favoring clinging, transparent fabrics with close-set drapery folds. Wu Tao-tzi, the ideal purely Chinese figure artist, drew his garments with a dynamic freedom of line that made them seem to billow in the breeze. 63 THCWC III: another emigre from Ssfi-ch'uan, whose specialties included secular figure painting and build- ings-and-trees, as well as religious art.

"The sub-precinct on the north side of the Pure Land Precinct . .. has a painting by Tuan on its east wall, with interesting effects of mists and cloud ranges (SCMHP)." Fourth Phase: " In (1065) Hsiang-kuo-ssu suffered severely from the rains. The Pien River was so swollen that drains and gutters could no longer operate effectively. The four corridors of the monastery court were all flooded, (resulting in) an almost complete collapse of the walls painted by Kao Wen- chin etc. Only the connecting corridors (running out) to east and west from the Great Hall, and their corresponding gate buildings escaped damage. On the south side of the east gate, Wang Tao-chen had painted the story of the merit acquired by the purchase of the Jetavana garden by the elder Anathapindada; while on the north side were the episodes of the 'Contest of Raudraksa with the Holy (Sariputra) 'by Li Yung-chi and Li Hsiang- k'un. On the south side of the west gate, Wang Tao-chen had done the figure of Chih-kung trans- forming himself into the Twelve-headed Kuan-yin; while on the north side was Kao Wen-chin's cycle of the 'Defeat of Mara.' The remaining four frescoed corridor walls were all repaired; after which the famous masters of our own time, Li Yiian-chi 65 and the like, were called together and executed copies based on small-scale cartoons which had been kept in the palace storehouse.

Shen Tsung, the very emperor who welcomed Jojin's Tantric rain magic in 1073, nine years later commanded a reorganization of Hsiang-kuo-ssui which gave a large share of its power to the meditative sect. Two " giant sub-monasteries " ]1ilJ with the titles IHui-lin and Chih-hai were created on east and west by this regrouping of precincts, and two noted Ch'an masters were invited by the emperor to take up residence as their abbots.68 The Buddhism which gave the monastery its Northern Sung form, however, seems to have been a type of orthodox Mahayana; roughly comparable to the contem- porary Tendai in Japan, and designed in the same way to include creeds and rituals ranging from simple popular faith in the Western Paradise to the most esoteric mysteries. Much of its initial impetus, after the chaos of the Five Dynasties, had come from the deeply rooted faith of the south China coast, centering around Jojin's parent headquarters of T'ien-t'ai-shan; and so from a church which had been preserved and fostered by the princes of Southern T'ang and Wu-yiieh while the northern monasteries were being starved out or destroyed. The famous southern clerics who flocked to K'ai-feng, almost as missionaries, after the reestablishment of the empire, had the prestige and experience to play a preponderant role in creating an imperial religion.69 To their trans- mission of inherited knowledge was added, decade after decade, an accumulation of new material brought to the Sung court by western monks from Turkestan and India. Much of this newly trans- lated literature was strongly Tantric, and must have acted as a powerful stimulus to the esoteric and magical side of Northern Sung Buddhism. Outside influences, as well, undoubtedly took an important, if less obvious, share in the develop- ment. Throughout the century Taoism was an energetic and unscrupulous rival; while the Con- fucian school had at last evolved a philosophical capacity which was more permanently dangerous than its old armament of atheism and race preju- 68 Noted in Fo Ts?

In a general atmosphere of tolerance, the opposing beliefs won ground by quiet infiltration. Syncretic ideas flourished, and the " Three Foun- ders "--Skyamuni, Lao-tzui, and Confucius-were worshipped in one hall in Buddhist monasteries. Beneath all this was a slow, steady cultural pres- sure, working through Buddhists and unbelievers alike to make over the alien religion into forms more congenial to Chinese taste. The artists transformed the Bodhisattva type from a swart, half-naked Indian to a more decently clad divinity with a properly light complexion; the faithful gave special honor to the figures in the pantheon who claimed personal connection with China. Popular imagination, beginning to express itself in Buddhist terms, created a wholly new category of demi-gods, the Lo-han, linked by name to the Arhats of India but more nearly kin to the pic- turesque Hsien {l, the mountain-dwelling, cloud- riding immortals of Taoism. Ch'an itself was in many respects a resurgence of Chinese philoso- phical initiative, masked by Indian terminology. Deepest of all, finally, in the composition of Sung Buddhism was the fatigue of age; the slackening momentum of a faith which for all its wealth and majesty survived more as a great tradition than as a true spiritual force. Jojin's report of the chief icons of Hsiang-kuo- ssu contains no surprises. The two principals were impeccably correct as products of orthodox systematization. Vairocana, or Lu-she-na, the Adi-buddha personifying the primal unity behind all appearances, took by right the innermost great altar, to the rear of His lesser manifestations. In its Maitreya, or Mi-lo, the Sung monastery had inherited a divinity very popular in early Chinese Buddhism, though somewhat less commanding in the eleventh century. As a savior deity, waiting reincarnation as the next Buddha, He was directly associated with humanity; and His acceptance of general worship was rightly the central point in the temple's activities. Maitreya's associates in the Main Hall formed with him a triad which- in one sense unconventional-seems to have been by no means rare. By strict interpretation of the canon, Maitreya, Amitabha, and Sakyamuni, emi- nently respectable in other combinations, do not belong together. They form neither a proper theological " vertical," mounting from Bodhisattva through human Buddha to Dhyani-buddha (e. g. Avalokitesvara, Sakyamuni, Amitabha); nor a proper " horizontal" of like deities, the five Dhyani-buddhas or the cosmological four Buddhas of the four quarters of the universe; nor a proper "triangle," a Buddha and his two attendant Bodhisattvas (e. g. Sakyamuni, Manjusri, Saman- tabhadra). They seem instead to have been com- bined in a triad for purely devotional reasons, as the three Buddhas most intimately associated with human longing for salvation; :Skyamuni and Maitreya as individual saviors of the not too dis- tant past and future, Amitabha as the timeless ruler of a Paradise open to all believers. Inter- relationship between the three doubtless varied according to time, place, and circumstance. At Hsiang-kuo-ssui it was Maitreya who was first worshipped, and who took in consequence the central throne. The other two may have been added relatively late; Amitabha was perhaps enshrined earlier in the Pure Land Precinct named in our first mention of Hsiang-kuo-ssui in the tenth century. The presence of Sakyamuni may repre- sent a concession to an already powerful Ch'an element in the monastery (though the multiple title for Him given by Jojin is pure Mahayana). It is interesting to note that the Japanese pilgrim found the same three throned in the Main Hall of Lung-hua-pao-cheng-ssiu * V*-:f at Hang- chou, and elsewhere met them in another com- bination with 'Skyamuni at the center.70 The Five Hundred Lo-han, so highly regarded at Hsiang-kuo-ssui that they were installed in two separate sets, at the top of the loftiest buildings in the temple, represented in Northern Sung a relatively new religious concept. The thorough study by De Visser has shown the semi-mythical Indian source of the idea, its appearance in south China in the tenth century, and its rapid spread 70 See Santendai, pp. 327; 332, 335 (Kuo-ch'ing-ssui 3g jtf and Ta-tz'ui-ssiu - j on T'ien-t'ai: gak- yamuni center, Amitabha and Maitreya left and right); 375 (P'u-chao-wang-ssUl: the same); 412 (Chen-jung- yiian A,gn on Wu-t'ai: the same).

T'ien-t'ai, and so were the original property of the sect centering there. They were soon inherited and exploited by Ch'an, which eventually sent them on to Japan with the rest of its paraphernalia in the thirteenth century. De Visser's account lacks only the statistical richness which Jojin's diary would have added. The Japanese saw "Rakanin," with groups of the Five Hundred (and sometimes also of the Sixteen as a separate group) in every great monastery which he visited in south China, and in virtually every one at K'ai-feng. Only Wu- t'ai-shan, far away in the northwest and perhaps jealous of southern initiative, was an exception to their general amazing popularity.72 His record suggests that no fixed rule was applied to the position of such a building, nor to the installation of the images within it. It might have been felt at Hsiang-kuo-ssui that the Lo-han should be housed at the top of high buildings because of their predilection for mountains; yet at P'u-chao- wang-ssui -* ,EsE on the Huai River they occu- pied the ground floor of a great four-storeyed pavilion (behind the Buddha Hall), and a white- robed Kuan-yin was above them.73 Being by tradition disciples of the historic Buddha, the Hsiang-kuo-ssu Lo-han in the Tzui- sheng Pavilion were grouped about His image "and so on"; perhaps an abbreviated reference to the immediate attendants Ananda and Kasyapa, or the ten personal disciples. The iconographic design seems to have been strikingly enlarged by the addition of divine complexes in the flanking "tower" rooms, Manjusri with his attendants on the west and Samantabhadra with a balancing group on the east. Since both were housed in architectural shrines, they were probably limited in size, as well as symmetrical in iconographic character. The tumble-down Northern Sung "Buddha-perfume Pavilion" at Lung-hsing-ssii 71 De Visser, M.

When his ship was endangered by a great storm at sea, Jojin prayed to Manjusri and the myriad Bodhisattvas of Mt. Wu-t'ai and to the Five Hundred Lo-han of the Rock Bridge on T'ien-t'ai; p. 322. 78 Ibid., p. 376. has preserved two astonishing walls as testimony to the importance of these two Bodhisattvas, on which the pair are represented with their followers and concomitant celestial phenomena in high relief plaster, at the scale of huge panoramic fescoes.74 Here the groups were probably those frequently painted and sometimes set up in sculptural com- binations at Tun-huang: Manjusri on his lion and Samantabhadra on his six-tusked white ele- phant as Jojin describes them, with a blackamoor leading each steed, and a varying number of lesser Bodhisattva figures surrounding each principal (fig. 10).75 The prominence given to Manjusri and Saman- tabhadra by the design of the Tzui-sheng Pavilion, and by their representation in pictorial form beside the rear gateway just beyond, probably reflected more than their traditional association with ~ak- yamuni and their importance in great Mahayana suitras. For centuries popular belief had been transforming the two from exotic aliens into at least half-naturalized figures, through their asso- ciation with great holy mountains in western China. Samantabhadra, P'u-hsien, was thought to inhabit Mount O-mei jf i1 in Ssui-ch'uan; while Manjusri, Wen-shu, had not only been seen on Wu-t'ai in Shansi, but was assigned thereto by scriptural authority.7 During the period of rapid restoration of Buddhist prestige under the first Sung emperors, particular attention was paid to 74 Tokiwa and Sekino IV, pls. 135-38. 7 Jojin's mention of " dependent " figures only makes it highly probable that the attendants in both groups were the nameless Bodhisattva types found at Tun-huang in early Sung, rather than the more complex, individual companions imported from Southern Sung to Kamakura Japan. See Soper, "Four Columns from a Chinese Temple," Honolulu Academy of Arts, Special Studies, I (1947), p. 11 and notes 10-12. 7 The "old" Avatamsaka-sitra, Hua Yen Ching VjaI , XXIX (chapter on the dwelling-places of the Bodhisattvas) states that to the northeast (of India) there is a Bodhisattva dwelling-place called Mt. Ch'ing- ling (it j (the name of one of the Wu-t'ai monas- teries). "Various Bodhisattvas have lived there in the past. At present there is a Bodhisattva there named Manjusri, with a host of subordinate Bodhisattvas, to whom he continually expounds the Law." The Tantric Manjusri siltra Wensh-shu-sih-li Fa Pao Tsang T'o-lo-ni Ching 1 ffii jt [:t g i (Taizokyo 20, no. 1185, translated in 710) is more precise, naming the realm as Ta Chen-na ] g~ , and the mountain as the "Five Peaks" : Ij. 37</page><page sequence="20">SoPE : Hsiang-kuo-ssu, an Imperial Temple of Northern Sung these two great national shrines.77 T'ai Tsung in 980 began a lavish rebuilding of the ten mon- asteries on Wu-t'ai, which in the course of three generations was to produce the "indescribable " magnificence seen by Jojin. Concentration on the rival mountain in the Southwest was stimulated by reports that P'u-hsien was once more vouch- safing appearances. In the same year of 980 the emperor commanded that a twenty-foot gold-bronze image of the Bodhisattva be cast in the provincial capital, Ch'eng-tu, and that a great pavilion be erected at Pai-shui-ssui 3;Cj on O-mei to enshrine it. Thereafter grants for temple construc- tion and adornment were continued by succeeding emperors, to the accompaniment of gratifying supernatural manifestations. The two Bodhisattva "towers " at Hsiang-kuo-ssui were probably ima- gined as a means of imperial laison with the distant mountain sanctuaries. The iconographic or historical connotations of the Hsiang-kuo-ssui frescoes will be discussed here- after in the general order of their mention above. Of the three subjects cited under Wang Jen- shou, one is of interest chiefly as a reminder that the same mixture of popular and esoteric Buddh- ism existed in tenth century China as in contem- porary Japan. The Pure Land Precinct probably drew public support from the simple faith in O-mi-to-fu and His Western Paradise. The Eight Bodhisattvas, however, were associated as a group with that Buddha only through Tantric doctrine. The texts describe them in a ma.ndala layout, with the icons of Kuan-shih-yin, Mi-lo, Hsii-k'ung- ts'ang )ijj, P'u-hsien, Chin-kang-shou NlIJ], Miao-chi-hsiang @i , Ch'u-kai-chang g |, and Ti-ts'ang i{3 surrounding the central Buddha. In exoteric rendering they were prob- ably ranged in line, like the groups found at Tun-huang. "Mi-lo's human incarnation" must have illus- trated the sutra of that name, Mi-lo Hsia Sheng Ching SfTfl.78 In it the historic Buddha describes the circumstances under which His suc- cessor will come to save the world, amid the peaceful beauties of a new Earthly Paradise. Several large-scale representations of the theme, dating from the ninth and tenth centuries, have 77 References in Fo Tsd T'ung Chi XLIII, pp. 395, 398, 400; XLIV, p. 404. 78Taiz6ky6 14, nos. 453, 454 (different translations). been preserved among the frescoes of Tun-huang and the nearby oasis of An-hsi # .79 Their elaborate compositions vary in details, but follow the same basic illustrative pattern, which may well have been that of the Hsiang-kuo-ssiu version also. The major design element is a complex, sym- metrical figure group, closely similar to those found in the Paradise scenes of other Buddhas. Maitreya too expounds the Law to a host of Bodhisattvas and lesser divine beings, at one of the three great terrestrial assemblies in which He is to convert millions. In token of its earthly setting, the group lacks the rich background of celestial architecture found in the true Paradises. Numerous small- scale illustrations follows out the text of the sutra. A distant walled city, spreading across the top of the panel, represents the capital, Ketumati, of the realm into which Maitreya will be born. In the foreground, in balanced groups, its great person- ages-King Sankha, his beloved consort, his heir, a Brahman youth-receive the tonsure as the first act in the drama of conversion.80 At the center below the divine assembly is a curious episode teaching the impermanence of beauty; the destruc- tion by greedy Brahmans of a precious work of craftsmanship (in some versions a jewelled throne, in others a fountain-like "standard " ti, in one a pagoda). Other identifying details are the Seven Types of Treasure to be possessed by King Sankha (a picturesque Indian series, white elephant, war- horse, lovely woman, etc.); the riches which will well up out of the earth, guarded by Naga kings; and lesser illustrations showing in various other ways the idyllic state of man in that day to come. Wang Jen-shou's companion " Pure Land " was probably Sukhavati, the Western Paradise of Ami- tabha; a less well known setting would have been qualified by the Buddha's name. Here again his version may well have followed a tradition formu- lated in T'ang, and often represented at Tun- 79 Discussed by Matsumoto, pp. 91 if. and pls. 30-32. Also Warner, pp. 21-27, pls.

In the Mi-lo fresco at the Toronto Museum, of Yuan date, the two are said to be the Emperor Wu of Liang and Empress Hu of North Wei. See White, W.

Supplementary illustrations in this case were usually relegated to framed-off side panels. The two great panoramas may well have balanced each other on opposite sides of a hall, as they do in a ninth century cave at An-hsi. The conventionality of Wang Jen-shou's con- tributions seems appropriate to a period of slack ambition, in the dispiriting atmosphere of the Five Dynasties. The famous frescoes which followed with the renascence of north Chinese Buddhism under T'ai Tsung, show a new vigorous interest even in their titles. The Sung masters may have painted formal Paradises under dictation; their names were remembered in association with very different themes, primarily narratives with strong dramatic interest. King Asoka, the first imperial patron of Bud- dhism in India, has been an extremely rare subject in Chinese art history. T'ai Tsung's choice of a cycle based on his career, to be executed by the foremost court painter for public display in the first monastery of the capital, was thus an unique event, which demands an equally particular ex- planation. The likely reason is obvious. The one generally accepted link between Chinese Buddhism and the Indian monarch was a monastery on the Chekiang coast near Ming-chou, bearing his name, A-yii-wang-ssiu i 3E. This establishment owed its origin in the Six Dynasties and its continued fame to the possession of a small reliquary in stapa form; miraculously acquired, and claimed to be one of the 84,000 stupas in which Asoka had distributed the relics of the historic Buddha.82 Now it is recorded that in 978 T'ai Tsung sent an envoy south to Ming-chou, who brought back the King Asoka stupa to the capital, where it was worshipped in the palace. In order to give it a fitting metropolitan shrine, the emperor ordered the erection of the gigantic pagoda of K'ai-pao-ssui; completed after eight years in 989, and (in the 81 Matsumoto, pp. 1 ff., pls. 1-22.

The scheme can only be guessed at, as a series of large narrative panels. One must have been the partitioning of the relics, and their dispatch by demon messengers in small stfpa reliquaries over all the earth. The scene recorded by the texts was probably drawn from the other end of the series, in Asoka's pre- Buddhist phase of non-edifying conduct. Both scriptural sources for his life, his sutra and his biography, describe with gusto an armed encounter which followed his accession to the throne.84 His elder brother Susima was so infuriated at being passed over that he marched on Asoka's capital in great force. The latter disposed his best men out- side the four gates of his city, to meet the attack, 83 The prime source for the history of the reliquary during this period is a temple stele composed by the scholar Sung Lien $S , dated 1378 (available in the anthology Sung Hsiieh-shih Wen Chi ~S_ ; XLIII, (Ssu-pu Ts'ung K'an edit.). The author records several occasions on which it was removed for palace worship by the great of the land, notably by a prince of Wu-yiieh in 916, by Hsiao Tsung of Southern Sung in 1175, and by Kubilai Khan in 1276; in each case being careful to describe its return to the monastery. Nothing is there said about a removal by T'ai Tsung in 978. Sources for the latter fact are: Fo Tsi T'ung Chi XLV, p. 397, and LIII, p. 461; Shih Shih Chi Ku Liek IV, p. 860; also Li Lien's section on K'ai-pao-ssu (where it is said that the reliquary came from Hang-chou). The great K'ai-pao-ssui pagoda burned down in 1037; the Fo Tsi etc. XLV, p. 410 and Sung Shih CCCXX, biog. of Yii Tuan 48, say that a palace official was com- manded at that time to secure the reliquary stapa enshrined in the pagoda basement 4 and bring it into the palace for worship. In 1072 Jojin saw a rebuilt, somewhat smaller pagoda there, but mentions no reli- quary. (Santendai, p. 396) My article referred to in note 82 stresses the dubious historicity of the relic and the strong likelihood that priestly invention was called in more than once to remedy historical accidents. It seems not unlikely that in this instance either (a) T'ai Tsung was given a substitute, through well-grounded mistrust of his generosity; or (b) that the real reliquary, if not burned in the K'ai-pao-ssi fire, was never returned and was lost in the Tartar sack of the city; as a result of which the A-yii-wang-ssfi priests fabricated a sub- stitute for themselves, and deleted all mention of the removal from their own records. 84 A-yil-wang-chuan Hp W i Ef{ (Taizokyo 50, no. 2042), translated in Western Chin; and A-yii-wang-ching (; (ibid., no. 2043) translated in Liang.

On that same side his chief minister had set a cunning trap, digging a series of well-camouflaged pits filled with fire and manufacturing dummy figures of Asoka and his warriors out of wood, to serve as decoys. Susima and his army rushed against the gate on hearing that Asoka was there; fell into the fire- pits; and so perished. Kao Wen-chin's gate frescoes of the appearances of Wen-shu and P'u-hsien in their mountain retreats, doubtless used material of the sort recorded in the mid-thirteenth century history of the Chinese Buddhist church, Fo Tsii T'ung Chi ;JtfIi.i23 A typical miracle was that granted an old man who had " ventured up into O-mei to seek medicinal herbs. As he looked up toward the peaks, he saw a five-colored cloud from which white rays of light were streaming. Then a deer appeared, and led him to a cliff-top, where he saw the true form of the great P'u-hsien." Like the sculptural groups in the pavilion "towers," these paintings seem to have had a local and topical importance, as proof of imperial interest in main- taining worship at the famous mountain temples. With a vast difference in skill and some adjustment of scale, their form may conceivably have resembled that of the tenth century panorama of Wu-t'ai, at Tun-huang.85 The " Defeat of Mara " was a traditional theme, perhaps chosen merely as a large scale "contest" design to balance the Raudraksa and Sariputra picture on the opposite side of the hall. At the hands of a first-class Sung painter the treatment of such a subject, with all its possibilities of dra- matic excitement and grotesque fancy, must have been at an opposite pole from the feeble, stereo- typed late Mara scenes at Tun-huang.86 The scene of Anathapindada buying the Jet- avana site for use as the first Buddhist monastery, is one which had been popular in early Indian illustration but was rare in the Far East. Pre- sumably its Hinayana naivete was made more worthy of representation by the symbolic link be- tween the rich donor and the deity in whose hall he was figured. According to the Ekottaragama, has Asoka make a dummy white elephant, with his own figure painted on it, as a decoy. s5 Pelliot, pls. CCXXI ff. 86 E. g., ibid., pl. XLIII. XLIX,87 Anathapindada's generosity is to be rewarded by the great good fortune of re-birth in the time when Maitreya will appear as saviour. For the riches he lavished on the Buddhist order, in paying for the monastery site by covering its surface with gold, he will be treasurer of the super- naturally abundant wealth which will emerge from the earth in that day, guarded by four Naga kings; and his felicity will terminate, like Maitreya's own, in Nirvana. The companion fresco on the other side of the east door, the " Contest of Raudraksa and ~ari- putra," formed a nice pendant both in narrative continuity and in artistic variety. The Anatha- pindada episode, as painted by a specialist in archi- tecture and secular figures, must have had the decorous elegance of a scene in a palace garden, embellished by flowering trees and gay robes. Against its dignified familiarity, the other picture was exotic and exciting. The story involved is told in several sutras which embellish the Jetavana theme with entertaining details; a number of late Tun-huang compositions give some idea of illus- trative possibilities (fig. 12).88 It is said that the project of installing a Buddhist monastery in the city of gravasti was strongly opposed by a group of resident "heretics." These carried their protest to the king, and persuaded him to make his approval contingent on the outcome of a contest in supernatural power between the two sects. On the day appointed, tremendous crowds streamed from the city to watch the two champions on their high thrones, the "heretic" sorcerer Raudraksa and the Buddha's sage disciple Sariputra. As an opening challenge, the former materialized a giant tree, which shot up to majestic luxuriance before the spectators. Sariputra's answer was to uproot and pulverize it by a violent whirlwind. This is the moment chosen for chief emphasis by the Tun- huang ateliers, and its humor and sweep of move- ment-the " heretic " party scramble up ladders to hold, down the wildly tossing canopy of Rau- draksa's throne-are strong even in their relatively mechanical execution.

Chih-kung, or Pao-chih |j, was a famous figure of early Chinese Buddhism, frequently (though incorrectly) honored as the third patriarch of the church. His career covered the better part of a century, until his death in 514. During that time he won fame as a holy man and magician, came into contact with two emperors, and con- verted the second, Wu Ti of Liang, into his most fervent disciple. The myth-making process credited him fairly early with an ability to trans- form himself into the likeness of a Bodhisattva. The specific exploit here referred to was probably a late elaboration, and a local product as well. It is, so far as I know, first told in the late Southern Sung Fo Tsui T'ung Chi.90 The Twelve- headed Kuan-yin is an iconographic "sport," authorized by no known Far Eastern texts. I have found only one other instance, an iconographic cartoon in Kyoto copied from a devotional print issued by the last Five Dynasties prince of Wu- 89 Succeeding miracles: (2) creation of a treasure pond, full of flowers etc.; drunk dry by a six-tusked giant elephant; (3) creation of a great mountain, with forests, streams, etc.; destruction by a Vajrasattva spirit who clubbed it to bits; (4) creation of a ten-headed storm dragon, accompanied by thunder, lightning, and earthquakes; destruction by a giant Garuda bird; (5) creation of a giant ox; torn apart and eaten by a lion. 9Popular stories retold by Werner, E.

The tale is told in connection with two emperors: Kao Ti of Ch'i, who was displeased by what he considered an attempt to bamboozle the populace (his successor Wu Ti is said to have jailed the monk for the same reason the following year, 483); and Wu Ti of Liang, who was thereby pre- vented from having Pao-chih's portrait painted.

Among the thirteenth century paintings of the Five Hundred Lo-han which have been preserved at Daitokuji in Kyoto,39 one kakemono illustrates one of the versions of the miracle related in the Fo Tsi T'ung Chi); that in which the painter Chang Seng-yu by imperial command of Liang Wu Ti attempts to do a portrait of Pao- chih, but is baffled by his transformations (fig. 13).92 As in the case of the Asoka cycle, the choice of this subject for Hsiang-kuo-ssui seems to have been the result of a factor more potent than artistic effectiveness or doctrinal fitness. The Fo Tsiu T'ung Chi records that a K'ai-feng temple erected by T'ai Tsung in 980, the K'ai-sheng-ch'an-ssii fgi3i* , possessed among its holiest treasures the true body, silver staff, etc. of Chih-kung.93 Presumably this relic was appropriated under imperial orders, like the sandalwood image of iSkyamuni in the same temple,23 the Five Hundred Lo-han from Mt. Lu, and the Asoka reliquary, to enhance and protect the Buddhist splendors of the new capital; while its acquisition was similarly commemorated by a painting at Hsiang-kuo-ssiu. A related act of recog- nition was the imperial promotion of the master in 980 to the title of "Bodhisattva of True Pre- ception from Tao-lin." 94 91 Discussed by Ono, pp. 679 ff.

A rather childish late copy in the collection of the Musee Guimet may serve the imagination in reconstructing both vanished originals (fig. 14).95 Several sutras give the story. Hariti, mother of a multitude of fierce demon sons, fed them by preying on other children. Outraged parents complained to the Buddha, who resolved to show her the error of her ways by kidnapping her smallest, dearest child Piyaiikara. Distracted by her loss, the she-demon eventually appealed in turn to Buddha's infinite wisdom, and was shown the child safe inside a transparent vessel. Though she summoned all the infernal powers to her aid, no strength was sufficient to lift the container and liberate Piyafikara. Finally the humbled Hariti realized that she and all her fellows were powerless against the Buddha, and surrendered. Her baby was returned, in exchange for a promise to forsake her evil ways; and since that conversion she has been a staunch guardian of the church. The Tejaprabha frescoes open up a subject of iconographic complexity which can only be drawn in the broadest outlines here. Tejaprabha was a relatively late arrival in the Buddhist pantheon, without individuality save for His association with the heavenly bodies. In the Tantric sutras which by stating that on a certain day "the great master Pao-chih descended and showed himself in the Forbidden Palace.

Presumably it was only in less esoteric imaginations and in art that He was given bodily form. His prime func- tion was to serve as a magical control against natural aberrations and catastrophes of celestial origin; a relationship which public art simplified into one of ceremonial dominance over the heavenly bodies, shown in anthropomorphic guise.96 As for the Luminaries themselves, the Chinese had counted sun, moon, and five planets at least from late Chou. In the eighth century, new and more accurate astronomical knowledge was brought to the T'ang court by Indian missionaries like Gotamsida.97 Among the astrological elements so acquired was the theory of the two " dark stars," Ketu f-]P and Rahu *W, who are normally invisible but have the power of eclipsing sun and moon. A buddhist treatise by the Chinese scholar- monk I-hsing -..f (683-727), Fan T'ien Huo Lo Chiu Yao ;ti9k A l0 codifies this informa- tion from the standpoints of astrology and religious worship.

The Tejaprabha rite was brought to Japan by the mid 9th century Tendai pilgrim Ennin []_. ; see Mochizuki, pp. 1846 ff.

A common ancestry thus explains the obvious kinship between these Far Eastern offshoots in Indian of Chinese dress, and the mediaeval planet figures of the Islamic West.99 Mercury is always a scribe; Venus is always a female musician, and by a second accident of cultural transfer even plays the same "balloon guitar "-borrowed by Han China as the p'i-p'a ]iH--in the Near and Far East. Red Mars is always a figure of armed violence, Saturn a swarthy Indian ascetic. Courtly Jupiter may hold flowers in both Islamic and Chinese iconographies. Behind such similarities, of course, is the almost absolute persistence of astrological belief, nearly indepen- dent of time or space, by which Mars is always hostile, Jupiter benignant, and so on. The two " dark stars " (so far as I know exclusively Indian and Chinese) are naturally ominous, demon-like figures. Frequent portrayal of these celestial symbols in Buddhist art, as distinguished from their ritual representations, seems to have lagged a century or more behind the generations in which the informa- tion about them was made available. The great T'ang painters handled the Five or the Seven; 100 the specifically Tantric combination with Teja- prabha appears in remaining evidence only at the end of the ninth century. The earliest dated monument is a Tun-huang banner of 897.101 Its basic iconographic idea is one which was to be repeated later in more elaborate versions: the conception of the group as a sort of triumphal procession, with the radiant Buddha throned in an ox-cart and the Luminaries-there only the planets-surrounding Him like defeated monarchs. Most Japanese survivors show the symbols spotted against the magic circle or checkerboard patterns 9 See Saxl, F., "Beitrige zur einer geschichte der Planeten darstellungen im Orient und im Okzident," Der Islam III, pp. 151 ff. 100 See the catalogue of Hui Tsung's early 12th century collection of paintings, Hsiian-ho Hua Pu e-A11: al under Yen Li-te (I, 7), Yen Li-pen (I, 9) Wu Tao-tzfi (II, 3). The collection contained a fantastic number of Wu attributions, not all of which are likely to have been genuine; so that normally later subjects like Teja- prabha are somewhat suspect. 101 Illustrated in Stein, Sir M.

Chang Su-ch'ing $]P of late T'ang painted the Nine Luminaries as a Taoist subject.104 Yang Yiian-chen ~}Gt of the Five Dynasties did the Nine with Tejaprabha for two temples of the Shu capital.'05 In 1073 Jojin found the Nine painted in an elaborate Tantric group in a chapel of the imperial palace, together with a Buddha Triad, Bodhisattvas, the Sixteen Arhats, the Ten Bright Kings fJl3E, and other stellar symbols who were perhaps the representatives of the Big Dipper.106 l02 Discussed by Yoshinaga, M., =tL:f , " Hokuto Mandara ni tsuite" (On the North Star Mandala) Houn Vf% XVII, August 1936, pp. 73 ff. 103 Discussed by Ono, pp. 665 if. The unusual icon- ographic element is explained by the title, " Malndala of Mt. Chung-nan ~j ." The Buddhist miscellany Kaku- zenshd jg#e CIII (by the Japanese priest Kakuzen, 1143-1217; available in the anthology Dainihon-bukkyo- zensho 50, pp. 63 ff.) tells the story: a purported visit made by the T'ang emperor to Mt. Chung-nan in Shensi in 839, during which he met and conversed with a star goddess. Kamakura, H., ~jft s:*I in Houn III, pp. 44-45, devotes a brief note to the discrepancy between the date of 1148 inscribed on the copy, and the known life-dates (1146-1205) of the copyist there named, the Ajari Genjo ]J. Ono points out the specifically Chinese, even Taoist character of the story as a reason for the free design of the picture, so different from the crystalline symmetry of the Indian mandala. The inscription says literally that it was copied from a T'ang original *f ; unfortunately the character for T'ang was so frequently used in Japan as a mere geographical synonym for China, that it lost its chronological meaning. 104 THCWC II. 105 Cited in the history of 10th century painting in the Shu state, I Chou Ming Hua Lu x :H:lt,, by the Sung scholar Huang Hsiu-fu tfCl. 106 Santendai, p. 456.

He ventures 43</page><page sequence="30">SOPER: Hsiang-kuo-ssu, an Imperial Temple of Northern Sung At some indeterminate date, perhaps as late as early Sung, two more stellar deities moved into the iconographic foreground, the "luminaries" Tzu-ch'i %, (or ) and Yieh-po Hq . With the existing group they formed a new complex of Eleven Luminaries; to be painted in the third quarter of the eleventh century by Ts'ui Po at Hsiang-kuo-ssui, and at Ch'ang-sha (without the Buddha, so perhaps in Taoist adaptation) by Wu Tung-ch'ing N3 i.107 Occasionally they replaced sun and moon in the Nine, as in a Japanese iconographic cartoon of 1164 from the Kanchiin fla of Tqji t in Kyoto.106. The latter must have been copied from some Heian period predecessor, which in turn-to judge by the vigor- ous design and draftsmanship of the survivor- followed a Sung original. Yiieh-po in this series is an energetic male figure with leonine hair, half martial and half courtly, holding a sword in his right hand and a platter of offerings in his left; his long, Chinese sleeves are knotted to facilitate action. Tzii-ch'i is a typical Chinese courtier, grasping his jade tablet of office. Rahu and Ketu, on the other hand, are no less typically Indian, sharing their character of armed demons with Mars. The contrast reinforces the probability that the two newcomers were Chinese in origin, and as much Taoist as Buddhist. In the full Eleven they form part of an elaborate Chinese astrological system of later centuries.108 The summary description of Meng Yuan-lao, "with demon figures playing a hundred tricks," suggests an amplification of the basic "triumph" iconography of fig. 16, with Mars, Rahu, and Ketu the hypothesis that an iconographic cartoon of the group was sent back to Japan with J6jin's companions, and formed the basis for the Japanese copy in the Kanchiin of T6ji, Kyoto (which obviously derives from some lost Chinese original).

Ts'ui Po's treatment of the group as " seated divinities" was probably an individual innovation, and was (so far as I know) without issue. The repeated painting of the subject at Hsiang-kuo-ssui obviously reflects the same temporary religious and magical importance that led to its presence in a chapel of the imperial palace in 1073. Mention of landscape paintings, finally, points to the steady advance of that branch of art, which was to bring it to dominance over the figure tradition even in Buddhist monasteries in Southern Sung. Two citations will show something of the regard in which the Hsiang-kuo-ssui frescoes were held by their contemporaries, as well as the academic severity of the critical standards by which they were judged. The eleventh century scholar Shen Kua it4f remarks among the miscellaneous com- ments of his Meng Ch'i Pi T'an X: :109 "The ancient wall paintings at Hsiang-kuo-ssui are from the brush of Kao I. On one wall there is a scene with a group of musicians which has a great deal of underlying thought -. People usually regard as a fault the fact that the person holding the p'i-p'a guitar is strumming his lower strings, while all the woodwinds are playing the ssi-tzii St:. (Their point is that) the ssi-tzu on the guitar is played on the upper strings, so that it is a mistake to have the plectrum down on the lower. To me this is no error. Woodwinds produce their notes when the fingers are raised, while the guitar produces its notes when the plec- trum is swept across. In this case the plectrum is over the lower strings, (to be sure), but the upper strings are (already) resonant. This sort of effect was characteristic of (Kao) I, and reveals the way he worked things out in his mind." The final chapter of Kuo Jo-hsii's painting history contains a section on the contemporary kingdom for Koli 'j in Korea.110 After com- plimenting the Koreans for their cultural progress and for the degree of sinicization which made them unique among foreign nations, Kuo speaks with approval of the Korean paintings he has seen. He 109 Quoted by both Li Lien and Chou Ch'eng under Hsiang-kuo-ssfi.

For these he asked permission to make traced copies of the wall paintings of Hsiang-kuo- ssu, to take back to his own country. The request was approved" (and the work was scrupulously carried out, the painters being highly trained experts). Even the most ambitious modern imagination would hardly venture to reconstruct the lost frescoes of the Northern Sung capital in detail, so pitifully meagre is the remaining evidence of com- parable quality, and so dishearteningly mediocre the rest. We can be sure of striking designs and magnificent draftsmanship, carried out in the predominantly linear, lightly colored tradition associated with the memory of Wu Tao-tziu. Like Wu himself, the great Sung masters chose subjects which offered the best opportunity to display their creative ability and technical virtuosity, and hence were least confined by iconographic rules. In this respect they offer the utmost contrast to the con- temporary monk-painters of Japan, whose highest ambition was to reproduce the attributes and symbols of divinity with the painful accuracy of a magic rite. At the same time it must be recog- nized that the subject matter of the Hsiang-kuo-ssui cycles represented by its very virtues a compara- tively late and declining phase of religious art. Almost every great scene was a contest of some sort, with its dramatic excitement heightened by the grotesquerie of demons or magic. The cultural parallel is with the omnipresent martyrdoms and ecstasies of the Catholic Baroque, or the unrelieved melodrama of Jacobean tragedy, or the sensation- alism of Hellenistic art. For China also, the future could promise only a decline in skill, imagi- nation, and taste. What life persisted in the great figure-painting tradition was narrowed and con- centrated into the highly personal improvisations of Ch'an; while in succeeding centuries the official fresco style was to run on with ever-slackening momentum at the level of handicraft. REFORMS IN THE LANGUAGE AND ORTHOGRAPHY OF NEWSPAPERS IN JAPAN JOSEPH K. YAMAGIWA UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 1. 1. Recent information from Japan tells us of four major reforms that have to do with the written form of the native language. These reforms look forward to: (1) the colloquialization of the documentary style, (2) a reduction in the total number of different kanzi or Chinese characters that may be used, (3) greater approximation to phonetic norms of spellings in the kana or syllabic characters, and (4) the increased use of romanization. No doubt the attempt in the end will be to reduce the complicated system of charactery to romaniza- tion, but for the present a limited number of characters is retained in order to assure the possi- bility of written communication between the older and younger generations. The younger generation will learn to use the letters of the alphabet, but it will also learn a limited number of characters. I should like to confine this paper to a series of ob- servations on the first three of these reforms, as evidenced in newspapers printed in kanzi and 7cana. The fourth reform lies outside the scope of this paper since this paper has to do with materials printed in kanzi and kana and not in letters of the Latin alphabet. The discussions which must have preceded the promulgation of these reforms, and the directives and regulations governing each of them, are not completely known to me. The docu- mentary evidence of the effect of the reforms is, however, found in every newspaper now published in Japan. 45</page></plain_text>
