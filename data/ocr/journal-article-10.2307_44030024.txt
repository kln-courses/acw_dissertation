<plain_text><page sequence="1">This essay explores the portrait, not as memory of the disappeared, but as both a record and an appeal, both recognition and validation, of subjects who are themselves traumatized. It confronts figurative portraits with works that retain the trace as basis of meaningfulness.

Such is demonstrated by the rich and varied pro- gram of the Photograph Conference, out of which this special issue emerged, an event that literally acted out the meaning of the word conference by bringing together people whose intellect has been sharpened by the experience of neither ignoring nor taking for granted the delimitations of what of the "humanities" has historically construed as its "fields." For example, at the Photograph Conference, and as exemplifying "after" (post-) or "beyond" (meta-) disciplinarity, several papers converged on a single author, W.G. Sebald, whose "novels" single-handedly raise multifarious issues involved in the cultural analysis of photography. This convergence led to a conference session entirely devoted to Sebalds work, a narrowing down that is at the same time an opening up. I see in the coming- or bringing-together ("con-ference") of this session an emblem of what the Photograph Conference attempted to do: Mosaic 37/4 0027-1276-04/001020$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">2 Mosaic 37/4 (December 2004 ) • consider the photograph as a form of writing, etymologically speaking " with light"; • hence, treat it as "beyond," as I have formerly phrased it, or "about," as in the promising prefix "meta-," the word-image opposition as it has been classically construed; • consider the photograph as aesthetically ambiguous, both as belonging to the media of recording technologies and as shuttling back and forth between "art" and "found objects," household goods and different utilitarian uses; • and, given Sebalds position in history as well as his historical preoccupations in his books, consider what such a conception of the photograph can mean for the his- torical moment in which the Photograph Conference took place: an era I will call, but not without the qualms I will turn to in a moment, a "post-traumatic" age. I will now ask how these transitional features, so urgent in the contemporary cultural climate, can modify and then incorporate more conventional considerations. For I find it important to recall that the prefix "post-" cannot be taken in any simple sense to mean a "beyond" that disavows its complicity with what it rejects. Many have made arguments about this ongoing complicity in postmodernism (McHale), in postcolo- niality (Spivak's effective reminder that "there is a good deal of neocolonialism in postcoloniality"), and in poststructuralism, where, as Jonathan Culler demonstrates, only a "deep knowledge" of structuralism can make the "post-" position powerful and effective. As Isabel Hoving explains in her study of Caribbean literature, "post-" does not point only to a temporal posteriority but also to the ongoing or renewed presence of the anterior it leaves behind, as well as carries along. Instead of disavowing our ambivalent situatedness in what we consider obsolete, it thus seems imperative to take into consideration the "going through" or even "working through" of our past. In this respect, I must point out that, as we all know, the photograph - whether written in a discourse that recomposes narratives out of descriptions or presented graphically in frames, books, and shows - has traditionally been discussed in terms of four related issues that we can neither ignore nor uncritically endorse: • its indelible connection to reality (Barthes's index); • its affective potential and the responsibility this potential entails for the photogra- pher, but also for the "expository agent" who calls on photographs, and allows them to waver between (indexical) evidence and (pornographic, or traumatizing) affect; • its pervasive presence, in urban street culture, in the intimacy and alleged privacy of the home, and in art; in school text books and junk mail, to name but two</page><page sequence="3">Mieke Bal 3 of the ploys that rupture any private-public distinction we might still wish to maintain; • its memorial power: this aspect has been studied particularly in relation to Holocaust remembrance, an area in which scholars such as Marianne Hirsch have contributed to the development of a sensitivity both to that catastrophe's uniqueness and to the necessity to look at other areas of the world and other moments of history, not least of which is the present. These issues are, of course, also deeply imbricated among themselves. In this essay, I suggest how these two sets of issues can be brought to bear on portraiture, a genre that is the most classically photographic one, yet that might elude us in the contemporary world. The background of this inquiry is a concern about the tendency to rest the case for trauma almost entirely on the Holocaust, and on the emphasis on portraiture in commemorations of that more recent traumatic moment, the attacks of 11 September 2001. Let analysis me first of unpack photography. some issues That that heart constitute, involves for the me, photograph's the heart of simultaneous the cultural analysis of photography. That heart involves the photograph's simultaneous investment in the preciously private and the vulgarly public domains; hence, the way it deconstructs the flawed, illusionary, opposition, or even distinction, between those two. Here lies the photograph's power, and here lies its power to lie, deceive, seduce, and manipulate: its political, militant, even military agency. When I studied photography some ten years ago, I developed an allergic reaction to moralizing accounts of it. Not that I did not share the political mistrust of repre- sentation and the violence its objectifying thrust does to subjects, especially to those subjects who are vulnerable to an unwanted disclosure and unable to return the gaze; more than that, I was often disturbed by the moralizing tone of allegedly progressive analyses of photographic exploitation in the face of the unrestrained reproduction of offensive material alleged to illustrate the critical point. I came to the conclusion that such moralizing inherently risks pernicious forms of complicity. In Double Exposures I vented my unease with word-and-image combinations, pointing out how the com- pulsion to illustrate entails one of three acts of complicity, increasingly problematic: • a repetition of problematic displays; • a collusion in such acts of display; • a revelling and, indeed, carrying further of what the discourse of criticism overtly indicts.</page><page sequence="4">4 Mosaic 37/4 (December 2004) These dangers became especially apparent in coffee table books such as Malek Aloula's The Colonial Harem ; in richly illustrated publications such as Sander Gilman's; and in photographic exhibitions devoted to the relatively recent past: of lynchings, in the New York Historical Society, for example; or of colonial environments of various sorts. At the end of my argument in Double Exposures, I suggested that such a visual hermeneutic of suspicion need not cast a taboo against visual material, and emphat- ically need not lead to a renewed censorship of photographic testimonies of past atrocities. Instead, I argued, strategies could be deployed that are shrewd and intellec- tually, as well as affectively, effective; strategies which would establish a less easily appropriating, condoning, and exploitative - and more critical - visual engagement with such photographs. The question I was trying to address concerned the responsi- bility of intellectuals to analyze what they consider to be objectionable in visual culture, including taking into account not only the analytical and semantic but also the prag- matic and affective aspects of the cultural artifacts under scrutiny. Although I still feel strongly about this, I have also come to realize the damage done in a puritanical culture by any attempt to advocate a visually alert cultural responsiveness to the real dangers of unwanted display. The primary reason for this damage is the persistent neglect of self-reflexivity on the affective dimension of our situatedness and activities within culture. In other words, whatever alertness intellec- tuals may want to promote, a culture in flux will not, will never, simply endorse such guidelines, but instead will recuperate them into its own priorities: priorities which, if I may anticipate my conclusion, comprise a ferocious but disingenuous and, indeed, dangerous, individualism, one which this painting of the uses and abuses of identity surveillance beautifully sums up (see Plate 1 in the colour section). In a recent review of the exhibition of Diane Arbus's photographs, Judith Butler questions the moralizing taboo against inappropriate fascination with human distor- tions, playing on spectacle, pandering to the unseemly desire to gawk at what might seem aberrant; to peer, to invade. This taboo is too facile and unproductive, while it makes invisible things that might matter. Why do they matter, and what are these things? Butler writes: "So we witness the visual trace of her solicitation in the smiling or tortured figure who is photographed, and that solicitation works on the viewer as well" (119). Over a time-gap that nothing can bridge, there is still a form of contact requested and granted. Butler continues:</page><page sequence="5">Mieke Bal 5 Although we never get behind any of these surfaces (and this may well be a reason to exon- erate Arbus from the charge of "capturing" her subjects), we do see in this constellation of photographs how the surface is achieved, interiority refused, but not because of some exis- tential generalization about all subjects [...] [they] all emerge against the background of a lost world of touch and motion, one that nevertheless, surprisingly, continues to make its appearance. (119) For me, this portrait of an unknown woman did precisely that. Rather than rejecting what Kaja Silverman has most profoundly theorized as an "ethics of vision," then, Butler rejects the moral simplifications and the neglect of images that come with a moralizing appropriation of such considerations. Portraiture, I contend, is the genre in photography where the need of reflection is most acute and where the issues involved are most clearly visible. This becomes immediately evident when we look at standard discourse on portraiture. As a sample of discourse on portraiture in general, I take Richard Brilliant's book on the subject, Portraiture^ simply because it is well known, widely read, and although much criticized, it keeps popping up in publications on the subject. And as a sample of the photo- graphic portrait, I refer you to the well-known Puerto Rican Woman With a Beauty Mark, New York City ; 1965y by Diane Arbus, the first photograph to accompany Butler's article. Brilliant endorses Gadamer 's emphasis on the intention of the documentary value of portraiture, which the latter termed "occasionality" (see van Alphen). Brilliant defines portraits as "art works, intentionally made of living or once liv- ing people by artists, in a variety of media, and for an audience" (8). This definition is generously vague. It posits the circular argument of intentionality as what defines the object. Brilliants provisional definition is vague in that it does not stipulate, for exam- ple, that the portrait requires depiction of the face: not because this is not a criterion but, on the contrary, because it goes without saying. This primacy of the face appears to be a given in all publications on the subject I have consulted. For the face, as the say- ing has it, is the mirror of the soul, holding the visibility of interiority. A bit later, Brilliant largely makes up for that omission when he explains the genre with reference to babies: "The dynamic nature of portraits and the 'occasionality' that anchors their imagery in life seem ultimately to depend on the primary experience of the infant in arms. The child, gazing up at its mother, imprints her vitally important image so firmly on its mind that soon enough she can be recognized almost instantaneously and with- out conscious thought" (9). We all know that entirely new disciplines can be grounded in speculations about what babies see, do, and desire, but if a theory of the psyche can get away with assuming that a human feature is a feature of all humans, theory of a</page><page sequence="6">6 Mosaic 37/4 (December 2004) historically and culturally specific genre cannot. What interests me here is the anthro- pological, functionalist argument that seeks to explain the appeal of portraiture in the culture of Western individualism through an appeal to human universais. This rea- soning is fundamentally humanistic in its very circularity: it exalts human nature through an artistic tradition that exalts human nature. I am also struck by the self-evident importance attributed to documentary realism, a second unquestioned value in Western humanist culture. The point of the portrait is the belief in the real existence of the person depicted, the "vital relationship between the portrait and its object of representation" (Brilliant 8). A third assumption of Brilliant's argument concerns the nature of identity as a basis for communication. This again is based on the baby, so that the ontogenetic perspective is constantly mapped on the phy- logenetic one, in which development is the matrix, and old equals primitive (see Torgovnick for this as a well-known and criticized feature of Freud's thinking that has huge consequences for the bond between humanism and primitivism). A little later on the same page, Brilliant writes, "Here [in the mother-infant visual interaction] are the essential constituents of a person's identity: a recognized or recog- nizable appearance; a given name that refers to no one else; a social, interactive func- tion that can be defined; in context, a pertinent characterization; and a consciousness of the distinction between one's own person and another's, and of the possible rela- tionship between them" (9). This identity emerges not only out of appearance and naming but also out of distinction. Moreover, the recognition of appearance triggers interaction and expression. The two are practically the same: "Visual communication between mother and child is effected face-to-face and, when those faces are smiling, everybody is happy, or appears to be. For most of us, the human face is not only the most important key to identification based on appearance, it is also the primary field of expressive action" (10; emphasis mine). The link, or lack of it, between these two sentences posits the equality of communication with identification. This equation is grounded in the double sense of identification - as and with - that, I contend, under- lies the problem of portraiture. That individualism, realism, and expressionism constitute the safety net for the culture from within which Brilliant seems to be writing becomes clear in his summary statement concerning the values that portraiture promotes: "Portraits make value judg- ments not just about the specific individuals portrayed but about the general worth of individuals as a category" (14). Without transition he goes on to enumerate the kinds of value judgments portraits make, of which personal wealth, arrogant vanity, and fashion are on a par with the worth of human life (14). These values have in common the implied emphasis on self-promotion or self-love, visual boasting or narcissism. The</page><page sequence="7">Mieke Bal 7 ease with which these transitions are made is symptomatic of a kind of humanism I find inappropriate in our time. I call this the discourse of the face. "Face," here, stands as a supremely self-evident synecdoche of the human individual, a mise en abyme of what it means to be human. In this respect, it is comparable to the discourse of the "hand" (of the artist, in authen- tication discourse) or of the "voice" (of the narrator, in narrative analysis). The analy- sis of this discourse of the face thus far demonstrates that the alleged genre is not so much defined - if such a definition is possible at all - but mobilized. Portraiture serves a purpose, and the less this purpose is stated, the more profoundly it is encrusted in what we take to be the genre s "nature." This mobilization of portraiture as a soldier for individualism constitutes its bond with what has turned out to be the trap of iden- tity politics. Identity exploitations politics, are then, reframed is ushered in discussions in in trauma of historical studies, meaning, and issues as tense of display and sense. and exploitations are reframed in discussions of historical meaning, as tense and sense. Trauma studies is heavily invested in photography in general - snapshots, capturings of places and states, moments and pastness, not just in portraiture. This development has been crucial for the cultural analysis of photography. In an intelligent and sensi- tive recent book, Ulrich Baer takes up a useful distinction proposed by Vilém Flusser between two conceptions of time that are at play here, and at odds. He refers the cul- tural compulsion to keep authenticating thoughts as essentially Western, back to its origins in classical antiquity - in Heraclitus and Democritus respectively. Though the cultural conception of photography has been dominated by the one, Baer proposes to take up the other, doing an excellent job of it. The dominant stream sees time as a flow, or river, and refers to photography as a cut from that flow: a frozen moment, or suspension of that hostile, elusive flow. The alternative vision, that Baer develops to theorize trauma rather than the frozen moment, the conceptual metaphor through which to think the photograph, considers time not as continuous but as explosive, and bases the photograph on serendipity or catastrophe, as the case may be. Photo- graphy criticism based on the frozen moment tends to be melancholic, focused on com- memoration and nostalgic in mood; that based on catastrophe, focusing on trauma, is mournful, or even desperate in mood. Baer 's, or Flusser 's, distinction is a useful reminder of how easily we become addicted to a particular conception that seems so "natural" that everything that coun- ters it tends to become deviant. But the conception remains so profoundly binary that, I think, as a distinction (not as an analytical tool to switch gears) it begs the ques- tion of those photographs that remain mute in front of such grand schemes; not to</page><page sequence="8">8 Mosaic 37/4 (December 2004) speak of the addictive power of binary opposition as a thought structure. It does not seem useful to bring such massive generalizations to bear on photography. To just give one recalcitrant example, is the light-mooded picture from street culture (see Plate 2 in the colour section) best seen as snapshot, hence, as a "frozen moment," or as the result of serendipity, that happy version of catastrophe? Other than having a contemporary feel to it, which makes the historicizing move difficult, the animal head and the human feet constitute together a figuration of the impossibility to know that both conceptions appear to underestimate. The incongruity of this snapshot opens the division between two conceptions of photography and time to a wavering between earnest and ironic, mild and fierce, criticism that has no use either for self-involved nostalgia or heavy-handed trauma. In spite of its manifest relevance for the work Baer sets out to do, the division between the two conceptions does not in itself get us out of some of the particularly tenacious clusters of thought around photography that remain blind to, or keep repressing, historical change, hence, the present tense of viewing. If I propose to con- sider the photograph by way of what is probably its primary genre, the portrait, it is, perhaps paradoxically in view of Benjamin's comment on it, because that present tense of criticism is for me the key to a "post-traumatic" historical awareness. And it is such an awareness that I consider indispensable to overcome the moralism as well as the subsequent cynicism that preceded our present moment that I call, with full emphasis on the complexities of the prefix, post-traumatic. In his over-cited article on "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduc- tion," Benjamin wrote: "It is no accident that the portrait was the focal point of early photography. The cult of remembrance of loved ones absent or dead offers a last refuge for the cult value of the picture. For the last time the aura emanates from the early pho- tographs in the fleeting expression of a human face. This is what constitutes their melancholy, incomparable beauty" (225-6). In Baer 's terms, the comment is clearly made with reference to the frozen moment of conception. But in the face of Arbus's photograph Puerto Rican Woman With a Beauty Marky New York City. ; 1965y this link between portraiture and remembrance seems utterly beside the point. The photo is a portrait, but not of anyone we know and whose passing we remember in a melancholic mood. Yet, the photograph is clearly dated; no one will imagine seeing this woman today. But yes, we do, right now. The issue of identity is inflected from individualism to ethnicity, and yet remains tenaciously undisclosed. While Arbus's Puerto Rican woman keeps staring us in the face, let us recall who made the unsettlingly intense close-up portrait, Self-Portrait (1945). I will for now have to pass over the two decades that separate Arbus's Self-Portait from that of the Puerto</page><page sequence="9">Mieke Bal 9 Rican woman, decades during which the woman who took her own portrait as a visual letter to her husband, far away on the front in Burma, developed into the artist war- ranting a mono-exhibition that is currently travelling from one great museum to another. If I allege the self-portrait, this is, obviously, to remind us all of the profound subjectivity that is inevitably involved in photography - a subjectivity that is easily overlooked due to an over-emphasis on the index, the repetition, and the imprint. Yet, if the self-portrait does not establish a short circuit, a closed dyad between maker and portrayed stranger, nor does it disclose intention, it is because in both cases the equal- ly crucial subjectivity of the viewer breaks this dyad open. What we see here are two portraits, equally mysteriously subjectivized, although by no means in the same way. Although she is facing us with extreme insistence, the Puerto Rican woman does not quite look us in the face. This slight averting or, perhaps, rather interiorizing, quality of her gaze clashes with the form of the close-up and confronts us with our immodesty - an instance of the surface bouncing back our unreflective gaze and compelling us to self-reflect. The lipstick applied without mirror, rather than the beauty-mark mentioned in the title, may constitute a punctum for former insecure girls who have learned in adolescence to look at themselves with the gaze of a stranger. Ethnicity-hunters will be disarmed - again, in spite of the title - while any attempt to conduct a stylistic analysis will, in Butler's view, flounder on the surface so full of incongruities, where a woman we don't know tells us we never will. The thinking two thinkers about the or cultural photograph, philosophers Walter Benjamin most tenaciously and Roland present Barthes, in our were current both thinking about the photograph, Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes, were both devoted Proustians. At the risk of reiterating what is only too well-known - but then, also wishing to estrange us from what we think we know too well - I invoke at this point, as I have done before: Prousťs "taking" of the portrait of his grandmother. I say "taking" because, unlike Arbus according to Butler, he emphatically takes this photo, inevitably objectifying her who does not see him, and who is powerless to avoid it. Description, in narrative, is an act of making the diegetic world, in the literal sense. But, if the author makes that world, the diegetic narrator, the observer or witness, only "takes it" - takes it in: mécaniquement. Prousťs choice for a narrative where the nar- rator is and is not the same individual as the author was that stroke of genius that enabled him to question everything we have ever thought about subjectivity. Here, the narrative questions standard assumptions, not yet articulated at Prousťs moment of writing, about the "deep meaning" of the photograph. The photograph questions the mastery of the subject in the same sweep as it questions the subjection of the object. I offer the two parts of the description as companion pieces to Arbus s paired</page><page sequence="10">10 Mosaic 37/4 (December 2004) self-portrait and "allo-portrait." Here, the narrator in his role of visual agent is deprived of his perceptual and affective routine: De moi - par ce privilege qui ne dure pas et où nous avons, pendant le court instant du retour, la faculté d'assister brusquement à notre propre absence - il n'y avait là que le témoin, l'observateur, en chapeau et manteau de voyage, l'étranger qui n'est pas de la mai- son, le photographe qui vient prendre un cliché des lieux qu'on ne reverra plus. Ce qui, mécaniquement , se fit à ce moment dans mes yeux quand j'aperçus ma grand-mère, ce fut bien une photographie. (Proust 11:140) [Of myself - thanks to that privilege which does not last but which gives one, during the brief moment of return, the faculty of being suddenly the spectator of one's own absence - there was present only the witness, the observer, in travelling coat and hat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photographer who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again. The process that mechanically happened in my eyes when I caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph. (2:141; translation modified)] If this passage harbours a definition of the photograph, the definition is this: "the process that mechanically happened in my eyes." I modified the translation on two counts. "Happened" renders more emphatically the serendipity of the photo that, in the French reflexive verb form, "se fit" implies that the narrator figure had nothing to do with it. With Benjamin, I translate mécaniquement literally as "mechanically." The photograph embodies the object of visual perception detached from the relationship that inflects perception - its subjectivity. This ruptured subjectivity inscribes sense in tense: the punctual passé presents the photograph not only as a (frozen) moment but also as irremediably past. This turbing. famous It develops passage results toward in a more a defective and more act of hostile, vision, almost a result violent, that is language utterly dis- at turbing. It develops toward a more and more hostile, almost violent, language at the end of this unsettling degradation, a description of that mental photograph that is always "with" or "in" the narrator: j'aperçus sur le canapé, sous la lampe, rouge, lourde et vulgaire, malade, rêvassant, prom- enant au-dessus d'un livre des yeux un peu fous, une vieille femme accablée que je ne con- naissais pas. (11:140-1/11:439-40) [I saw, sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp, red-faced, heavy and vulgar, sick, vacant, letting her slightly crazed eyes wander over a book, a dejected old woman whom I did not know. (2:143)] Proust is here doing what we can call "imaging theorizing." He theorizes through visual imaginative discourse what subjectivity means in relation to perception, both in the</page><page sequence="11">Mieke Bal 1 1 reality of his created universe and, by extension, in his writing about that world. One of his tools is rhythm. The almost stammering sentence composed of qualifiers delays the nominative clause until the last possible moment. The distance between subject and object is not only radical, but also it affects the subject just as much, if not more, than the object. This distance is not geographical but ontological, a distance normally erased in the routine of perception when it is embedded in affection. There, affection is what frames perception, in the Derridean sense of parergon. This frame is diffused, but it is an indispensable supplement without which we cannot live. The body, whose integrity and totality are bracketed by this amazement, just as much as the identity we attach to it, needs such extensions. We are all cognitively and affectively handicapped. Mostly, we are quick to make up for the wound of severance from routine affec- tive perception. Either we idealize our affective relationship with the object portrayed, and commemoration is an effective tool to do so, as Benjamin indicates; or, when such an idealization is problematic, we blame the photograph for "appropriating the other," as in the kind of moralizing criticism Butler rejects in her review of Arbus. Clearly, the photograph of the Puerto Rican woman lends itself to neither strategy. We neither know or remember her, nor can we put her at the ethnographic distance of othering, if only because Arbus's strategy of the close-up prevents that. Proust's narrator demonstrates how profoundly the subject as viewer can be dis- empowered, at a loss, when the moment, frozen for eternity, is replaced with a split second of pure discrepancy. The split of that split second isolates him not only from his beloved grandmother whom he eagerly came to visit, but also it separates him from himself. The "moi" is reduced to his absence. Instead of the "first-person" speaker, the figure has been turned into a "third person," an Other, stranger to himself. This estrangement is conveyed in the description of the "stranger who does not belong to the house" as a traveller, dressed for the outdoors, excluded from the warmth of the home. In this sense he, not the object of the photograph, is the other (ethno-) and the writer (-grapher) at the same time, but not in harmony. One severance entails another. From subjects, this dis- ease extends to time and space. The word that summarizes this poignant state of non-participation is "observer." He who sees, observes, and witnesses can fulfill that function because he will never return to the place he captures in that instant of observation that the French word for "snapshot" renders so aptly: "instantanée." The act of observation severs self from other-turned-object, and as a consequence the moment is cut off from continuity. This idea makes the binary between time as flow and time as catastrophic moment; photography as frozen moment stolen from the merciless flow of time, or as moment</page><page sequence="12">1 2 Mosaic 3 7 /4 ( December 2004) blasted out of time, dysfunctional. Proust, rather than choosing sides, explores the consequences of both conceptions. The affection is severed from the routine of the eye that knows what it sees. Observation, when "purified" from what the observer already knows, produces the kind of emptiness described here. This emptiness is not only temporal - the split second before affection can reassert its reign - but also spa- tial, the distance that might well be the repressed underside of the very reason for the historical privileging of sight over the other senses. Proust's fragment represents the unexpected spatial element in what we ordinarily refer to in anthropomorphic terms as the "subject" of the artwork. Symmetrical to Arbus's close-up of a woman we do not know, Proust establishes the distance of alterity between himself and the woman he knows and loves. It is his subjectivity as a viewer, just as we analyze ours as view- ers of the photographs, that is at stake. In the analysis of representational literary and visual artifacts, this word "subject" is bizarrely ambiguous. It refers to the "maker" or what we construe the maker to be, as well as to the represented object. That ambiguity harbours a truth about our rela- tionship to the objects of analysis that warrants further scrutiny. It suggests that sub- ject and object are conflated whenever we place ourselves, as observers, in the position of the maker. In the quoted passage Proust describes the radical opposite of this con- flation as the property of observation: the severance of subject from object. Although the object observed here is the grandmother, the metaphor speaks of places, not of a garden but a house, unknown and never visited again. The house that is not a home to the observer. All these chilling metaphors announce the death of rela- tionship, the death of the object, switching from one term of Baer s pair to the other. The estranged, aging, slightly crazed woman who emanates from his observing gaze is, indeed, about to die. The link suggests causality. Although in the fabula she is simply sick, the narrative grammar implies that grandmother is sick and dying because she is being observed, and thereby severed from the affection that sustained both characters involved in this act of observation. Her death is inscribed in that split second between observation and the affective contact that follows it. This interval is neither frozen nor explosive but slowed down and disclosive. The Proustian split second creates for the reader that discrepancy that makes trauma such a relevant metaphor for photography. Baer quotes a statement by war journalist Meyer Levin, quoted by his son Mikael whose photobook War Story from 1997 constitutes Baer 's primary object of analysis: "today I somehow knew that I had to find and experience this without anyone having told me what it would be like" (Levin 127). With a keen sense for the literary sophistication of Levin senior's writing, Baer writes: "The 'today' [. . .] splits tense from sense" (91).</page><page sequence="13">Mieke Bal 13 This clearly traumatic moment in Proust does support one side of Baer's divi- sion, however. For the death descriptively announced, visually caused, is also what infuses the picture with the temporal distance that death initiates. In this sense, the photograph is already posthumous, and the observer's estrangement, post-traumatic. Lest we remain enclosed in the temporality of photography, the Proustian narra- tor establishes a similar distance in an explicit reference to the frozen moment or instantanée. Here, he acknowledges the unknowability of the other on a lighter tone. Indeed, in La prisonnière , Albertine consists of nothing but a series of snapshots: "A person, scattered in space and time, is no longer a woman but a series of events on which we can throw no light, a series of insoluble problems" (3:99/111:612). This dis- solution into a flat, visual series only gets worse, becoming eventually the base on which the images of jealousy will fix themselves: "For I possessed in my memory only a series of Albertines, separate from one another, incomplete, a collection of profiles or snapshots, and so my jealousy was restricted to a discontinuous expression, at once fleeting and fixed" (3:145/111:655). The last words, "at once fleeting and fixed," define very precisely the nature of the photograph: at once ungraspable, impossible to appro- priate, and yet subject to appropriation for the sake of memory. It is clear, then, why the snapshot's vocation is to become the mise en abyme of that aspect of Prousťs novel that can be defined as photographic. The narrator composes "an album of Albertines" in the vain hope of fixing this inaccessible being. I am interested in the multiplicity of attempts as well as in the visual effect of the grid that such multiplicities can entail when projected on an exhibition wall. This reflection is anchored in its time, be it time conceived as a still-current aesthetic modernism or as colonial appropriation. The "flatness" of the photograph, however, has an additional quality that frus- trates the narrator's attempt at fixating: it invites pretence, masks, and play-acting. It only fixes - being a frozen moment - the external aspect, thereby hiding all the better the inner being, which, in the case of Albertine, we are justified in saying does not actu- ally exist, as the immemorial experience of trauma that remains outside of memory. While the series of snapshots provides the subject with an epistemological way-out, the performativity the portrayed subject retains means that the photograph also affects the object: "And before she pulled herself together and spoke to me, there was an instant during which Albertine did not move, smiled into the empty air, with the same feigned spontaneity and secret pleasure as if she were posing for somebody to take her photo- graph, or even seeking to assume before the camera a more dashing pose" (3:146/ 111:656). As with the "old woman whom [he] did not know," Proust acknowledges again the unknowability of the other, giving her, here, the power to withhold the moment of portraiture. Baer speaks of the same epistemological crisis when he says, in</page><page sequence="14">14 Mosaic 37/4 (December 2004) tone with Proust's description of Albertine performing her portrait: "What we see in a photographic image might be something we don't know or recognize, for the camera can capture the play of light and appearance of things that escape our perception" (87). This is what Benjamin called an "optical unconscious": that Freudian phrase might erroneously suggest that this invisibility is the object of repression, lodged in the past, and bound to the individual psyche. If repression there is, it is on the level of collectivity and presentness of what we call "culture" that it plays itself out, however. It is not possible to understand these photographs outside of the circuit of which our subjectivity today is an indelible element. Might it be fair to say that Arbus, precisely by means of the close-up that teases us to believe the gap can be bridged, posits for the Puerto Rican woman an unknowa- bility that gives her, in spite of the proximity of our gaze, a space to remain who she is and hold her own? As we see her, she lived in the past. But she looks at us in the present; not from a frozen moment but from within a live one, here, now. Whether she has suffered trauma is impossible to say, and if she has, we are surely not privy to it. All cautionary statements about vicarious traumatization, and its counterpart, vicarious witnessing, hold firm (Hartman; Zeitlin; Hirsch, "Surviving"; LaCapra). Here lies my annoyance with the emphasis on portraiture in public commemo- rations of recent catastrophe. I emphatically do not mean to suggest that of those thousands of lives lost, we should not realize the total tragedy of each single one. But it takes me aback that two of my favorite fellow scholars, the great feminist critic Nancy K. Miller and the equally great anthroplogist/drama theorist Barbara Kirschenblatt-Gimblett, appear to unwittingly (I hope) fall for a use of photography in the service of control and the promotion of individualism: a selective individual- ism, of course, that is used to send individuals on a mediaeval crusade to "wipe out" and "smoke out of their caves" (to cite some Bush lingo), an enemy whose individu- ality is systematically and forcefully erased. Relevant to this essay for many reasons, Miller wrote a close analysis of the jour- nalistic "Portraits of Grief," published first as a New York Times lecture between 25 September and 31 December 2001, then as a book in summer 2002. I am especially interested in the notion that these short (200 word) pieces are referred to as portraits. She analyzes the written commemorative portrait as a genre that came into being in the wake of the event (112). Using anecdotes and descriptions, these short pieces seek to capture "that click where you can see the person" (116) so that "by giving formal dimensions to suffering, [the portraits] create a coherent public persona to fit the event, and one that also serves to protect both the victim and the mourners from the display of excessive or unsuitable emotions" (117). Negotiating the tension between public and private seems to be one of the primary goals of portraiture.</page><page sequence="15">Mieke Bal 15 As an afterthought or "detail," Miller mentions in her last endnote - at the end, and in a note! - how someone else, Christie McDonald, drew attention, after the inva- sion of Iraq had begun, to a logical problem of these portraits. McDonald saw similar- ities in the coverage of soldiers who had been killed in that [episode of the ongoing] war. But because these individuals belonged to the military [on a crusade to punish the perpetrators of the 2001 trauma], their deaths "could not be described with the same underlying sense of injustice (without making the soldiers seem unpatriotic)" (Miller, "Portraits" 134). And only at the end of that lengthy last endnote do we get: "Finally, no comparable attention to lives lost in Afghanistan (and later Iraq) made it possible to imagine the individuality of those killed by Americans" (134). The rhetoric of the placement of this reminder demonstrates that individualism is a dangerous weapon. It works that way, especially when deployed where people are most vulnerable to it, which is when their individuality has been made subordinate to a greater interest, and in the process, traumatically wiped out. That is a moment when individuality - the indelible value of each and every life lost - cannot be questioned. But the undeniable fact that there is a logic to the bond between portraiture and a militant, yes, military individualism - here, a logic of narrative syntax - deserves some thought. Like Lot in Genesis, it makes me want to ask for that administrative version of individuality - numbers - before even asking for portraits of all those who died, if only in Iraq, if only after the "war" was "over," if only of civilians, if only of children. Numbers, and then portraits. The numbers remain the tenacious symptom of the double standard inherent in individualism, hence, also in portraiture. (The Canadian daily newspaper Globe and Mail of 6 March 2004 lists the following cate- gories of what is so perversely called "casualties": Coalition forces 651. These are spec- ified according to nationalities, then for the US soldiers by state. Of these, 457 died through "hostile fire," whereas 194 are "non-combat related." I must assume this large proportion includes primarily what is, again perversely, called "friendly fire." The only figure for the other side mentions 8,305-10,149 Iraqis, and the paper adds: "based on estimates, including soldiers killed in the war." The categories are as staggering as the figures themselves.) Similarly, Kirshenblatt-Gimblett shows that she is aware of the problem, in her long, mainly descriptive essay on small and greater acts of commemoration in New York City. But while she mentions only in passing the special commemorative events of Arabic- American victims, as well as experiences of threat and xenophobia, the spe- cial significance for Jewish Americans is meted out at much greater length. Well aware of the delicacy of such rhetoric, both Miller and Kirshenblatt-Gimblett ambivalently bring up the comparison between the Holocaust and "September 1 1," acknowledging</page><page sequence="16">1. Photographer unknown, my mother and her nanny, Gorontalo, Sulawesi, Ca, 1920.</page><page sequence="17">Mieke Bal 1 7 that there is something immoderately inappropriate about that, yet, not quite dealing with that problem, neither analytically nor politically. I cannot refrain from thinking that all those who have been concerned about abusive and exploitative citations of the Holocaust should be up in arms to protest the comparison between the catastrophic aggression against a people without guilt, and the horrific to be sure, but still, respond- ing violence against a country guilty of prior aggression. For, the Arabic-American violent antagonism that can be justifiably called an ongoing war surely did not begin on 11 September 2001. As long as we accept the rhetoric of the US's innocence (not those who died but the country that was attacked) only more can be expected. And no collusion is entirely free of responsibility. Against nanny," the which individualism I see as addressing of portraiture, the saturation I offer this portrait of our post-traumatic (?), "my mother age and with her nanny," which I see as addressing the saturation of our post-traumatic age with photography's gestures of individualism (Illus. 1). Between the stern unsmiling woman who looks us in the face, and the playful toddler she is there to protect from falling off the chair, there is a poignant separation. The physical rift between the toddler and her nanny is not just a representation of the indelible mark of severance that still today opposes two worlds. By begging the question of who is the subject of the photo- graph - a question we can answer, as the caption in the album did: "little Suzie with babu," this photo remains, for me, an expression of the impossibility of portraiture.
