<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ORIENTAL SOLAR MOTIF AND ITS WESTERN EXTENSION BERNARD GOLDMAN HERE is ever-increasing evidence that the relationship between the ancient Orient and the West was fairly continuous, marked by periods of height- ened contacts. The latter part of the eighth century and early seventh century B.c. witnessed one of the more intense oriental- izing phases in the Mediterranean, a oriental tradition.2 The 8iren and Assur clamps that decorated these vessels- winged and tailed humans fastened to the cauldrons with rivets and supplied with rings to take a bail handle-are clearly Eastern in origin, but they are only part of an ancient oriental tradition in vessel fastenings that permeated East and West.

At the juncture of the collar and body of the vessel are two miniature loop handles whose diminutive size makes them imprac- tical on the large vessel (Fig. 1). Directly beneath these vestigial handles are the equally decorative remains of the clamps to which the prototypes of the handles were affixed: a raised linear motif consist- ing of joined triangles and a double spiral. The pithos is made of dark grey, polished fabric, perhaps in imitation of metalwork.3 The motifs can be best read as the schematic resolution of the bird-form in display position; the spirals are the wings, the triangles are the tail and body, and, as later examples illustrate, the loop handle is the neck and turned-back head of the bird.4 Early stylized ibex heads depicted en face have their large curling horns depicted in a similar position, but the ibex horns come together at the base whereas the pithos motif has the intervening triangular element.5 A more descriptive example of a bird under a handle is found on a pitcher, clearly based on a metal pattern, from Tepe Sialk (Iran).6 But it is in Assyrian art that we find the bird attachment as the standard form of bail handle clamp on the small buckets carried by priest and genius.7 These cremonial buckets are at least as ancient as the bird clamps whose early existence is hypothecated on the basis of the Geoy Tepe pithos motif. The earliest buckets are not preserved, but stone replicas of very early date do exist; they are probably ceremonial simulacra of the actual containers.8 One of these stone buckets, in the Museum of Tehran, has as its central decoration an eagle in the OO co A A A FIG. 2.-Ceremonial black stone bucket from Azerbaijan.

The clamp has the familiar bird shape with the loop on the back; a highly stylized bull head with short, straight horns would have faced in, over the lip of the cauldron. This would be an unique example of the bull clamp from Luristan, although the modeling of the piece does not help to identify it. 17 J. D.

Ptous, Dodona, Olym- pia, Etruria, etc. Some come from the shops of oriental smiths,29 while others are hellenic imitations. There are minor differences in interpretation as, for ex- ample, on the cauldron from the Tomb of the Lebeti (Vetulonia) with its Janus- headed clamp (Fig. 10), a design repeated in ceramic at Sparta.30 The Janus-headed deity is not a Western idea; it has ante- cedents in Babylonian and Hittite art and myth.31 The bearded Assur figures are outnumbered by the beardless sirens. It is very possible that these Near Eastern winged deities are behind the appearance of the harpy or siren in later Greek and Etruscan art. A winged goddess with taloned feet occurs in the Near East,32 and she appears later on the hellenized clamps in the west.33 An oriental sun-goddess is not lacking as precedence for the siren clamps; from Ras Shamra there comes a female "luminary of the gods,"34 Shapash in a winged disk, having the form "... of the well-known bronze Henkelattaschen figures from the rims of cauldrons .. ."35 At least two variations of the simple bird clamp are found at Olympia; one has the bird's head turned in, looking over the rim of the vessel, while the other has the FIG. 11.-Clamp on Roman situla from Pales- tine (photo: Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeol- ogy, No. 910.93.4) head reversed in protome fashion.36 A relief from the palace of Ashurnasirpal (British Museum No. 124564) shows the origin of this long-necked bird on the clamp: the bail handle of one of the ceremonial buckets is tied around the bird's neck.

The single, en face head developed from it, and then returned to the east (Fig. 11) as a hellenic motif. The bird clamp proliferated into highly imaginative compositions of animals and demi-gods in the workshops of the west.40 But the completely abstract derivation, such as found on the Luristan bucket, also moved into Italy and Europe.41 Even the European bail handle attachments made simply of looped wire take cognizance of the bird and solar clamps. The evidence comes in the form of a fragmentary rim with the wire looping still attached; fastened over the looping with three rivets is a sketchy but none-the-less identifiable descendant of the winged solar deity (Fig. 12).42 The T-shaped clamp in its several forms had its most ancient roots in the Near East where, on the basis of the Assyrian evidence, we can assume its association with ritual vessels. It took on, if indeed it did not always have, a specific solar symbolism: the disk, the Assur figure, the bull. Even its abstract forms still must have been charged with a solar energy. There is no reason to assume that the motif lost its solar significance during its western migrations; the Greek and Etrus- can cauldrons which the clamps decorated -;- Ir IL &lt;I rr FIG. 12.-Wire clamp and siren from bucket of Hallstatt period (after: Praehistorische Zeit- schrift, XXXIV-XXXV [1949-50], fig. 1) are iconographically solar vessels.43 The farther the clamps were removed from the source of inspiration, the more abstract they became; and so in Europe the tradi- tion is almost completely lost with the T-shaped strap handle as the vestigial remains, but the fragment illustrated in Fig. 12 is evidence of the strength of the motif. The fact that the winged disk version of the clamp does not appear in the Mediter- ranean indicates that the Assyrian clamps are at least once removed from the western models. The intermediate step is the Assyrianized bronzework of the northern, Urartian lands.

The Assyrian cauldrons stand on ornate floral-designed bases but are them- selves undecorated, leading one to suspect that the idea of adapting bucket attach- ments for use on large cauldrons was con- ceived in the Lake Van district and went out from there, not only to Phrygia (viz. Gordion) but also to the sea. When did this happen ? The clamps from Urartu (Karmir- Blur, Altin Tepe, Toprak Kale) belong to the late eighth and early seventh cen- turies B.C.; some of the Phrygian examples go back to the late eighth century B.C. also; a clamp recovered at Hama is pre- 720 B.C.44 Those found in Greece are dated in the Geometric Period and well into the seventh century B.C. On the other hand, the Assyrian winged-disk clamp (which does not appear in the west) goes back into the ninth century B.C. Hence, the migration of the motif westward may best be placed just prior to 700 B.c. This date is confirmed by related material. Jantzen's study of the griffin protomes, which appear on some of the cauldrons with the clamps, dates them to ca. 700 B.C.45 A decorated sherd in the Greek orientalizing style and a seventh century B.C. chased bronze from Olympia have griffin cauldrons with conical stands repre- sented on them,46 but we can only guess whether the clamp was equally common then. The distribution of the protome caul- drons in the Mediterranean suggests that oriental traders were bringing their goods to the Syrian and Phoenician coast, perhaps for trans-shipping out of a port such as Al Mina on the north Syrian coast.47 A northern route through the Black Sea, utilizing port cities on the coast of Trebizond (Trapezus), has the advantage of bringing the sea-going freighters closer to the smithies of the northern metalworkers and avoiding the Phoenician monopoly in the south.48 But the griffin cauldrons with their strong solar implications are connected to Egyp- tian-Phoenician symbolism, their remains are scattered along the Mediterranean island chains between Syria and Etruria, and the griffins themselves do not appear on the Asiatic cauldrons.49 Hence, a southern route seems indicated. The high esteem in which these clamp motifs were held in the west is indicated by their number as well as the imitations made by local artisans. By about 700 B.C. the highly skilled products of the northern oriental smiths were already keenly prized as far west as Etruria where the cauldrons to which they were appended were care- fully placed in aristocratic tombs. But the motif also is further evidence that ele- ments of the sun cult were of some importance in Etruscan religion at this early date. WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY DETROIT 2, MICHIGAN 44 H.
