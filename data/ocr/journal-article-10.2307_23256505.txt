Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011. ix + 234 pp. $27.95. In Being Numerous: Poetry and the Ground of Social Life, Oren Izenberg sets out nothing less than a definition and defense of poetry. The complete book shows why essay-length por __ tions have roused such excitement among scholars of the "new lyric studies" and of twentieth-century literature; this urgent, considered study is essential to both. Izenberg is inter ested in the nature of a genre pressed to its essence by the neces sities of recent history. He would shift attention away from the fact of the twentieth-century poem—whether taken as a specific instance of situated speech or as an ideal expression of transcen dent self-reflection—and toward the operation of twentieth century poetry. Poetry can be a potential, he argues, rather than a product or effect; it is something we are rather than something we do. It allows one to recognize the presence of others and thus provides one with the foundation for social feeling. Writers of this art are not seeking "a kind of object" so much as "a knowledge or capacity" that is "constitutive of what it is to be a person," and they do not hope to create a work of art so much as to "reveal, exemplify, or make manifest" that establishing "power" (17). Poetry's unique function, then, is a humanism more basic than any justification, embellishment, or even expression of human life. Poetry proves that life in the first place. In a useful passage of his introduction to Being Numerous, Izenberg compares poetry Contemporary Literature 53, 1 0010-7484; E-ISSN 1548-9949/12/0001-0188 © 2012 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">PHILLIPS • 189 to the "indication sign" of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology, something that "motivates our confidence in the existence of an intending mind" without communicating, necessarily, any par ticular intention or aspect of the mentality (30). To further define the nature of indication would be to draw limits, forbidding some group or aspect human recognition, and it is just such exclusions that Izenberg's poetic capacity would subvert. Poetry, he explains, allows "an account of personhood" that is "mini mal," "universal," and "real," and therefore one that is open and evident to all—manifesting alterity without specifying what it could or should be (4). "[T]he persons intended by the poetic principle are defined by their possession of value," Izenberg writes, and that value inheres before any taxonomic detail (23). This description means, paradoxically and interrelatedly, that poets can serve poetry by refusing to make poems, and that poetry can serve politics by refusing to engage politically. Since any accomplishment in verse threatens to circumscribe its essen tial universality, the writers Izenberg hails in Being Numerous take suspicion of their craft to be in service of its aim. Silence may be the most poetic act of all. Conscientious reticence, fur thermore, bears real consequence: as Izenberg explains, "[t]he attempt to make the person appear anew as a value-bearing fact—as the necessary ground of social life—is a conceptual pre cursor to any effective politics, to any subsequent account of jus tice" (35). The effects and accounts that follow from this "precursor" may take wildly different forms, from fascism to socialism to an anti-statist collectivity, even as poetry remains politically and judicially "radical" in the etymological sense of the term. Poetry displays a personhood that requires other per sons' recognition. This type of poetic legislation is deeply Shelleyan, as Izenberg points out. Like Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Defense of Poetry," Being Numerous forwards a justification of aesthetic activity that supersedes aesthetics as a goal. But its worth is most germane, Izenberg argues, to a twentieth-century world in which "a set of civilizational crises" have made the threat to personhood omni present and imperative (2). These crises include theoretical tur moil, which Izenberg describes as a post-Enlightenment "terror</page><page sequence="3">190 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE of skepticism about persons" (33) in a "philosophical culture that emphasizes the contingency of human value" (34), and historical devastation—a combination of "decolonization and nation for mation, the levelings of consumer culture, 'the end of history/ and above all, genocide and the specter of total annihilation" (2). As person-valuing poetry redresses these conditions, it suggests a reorientation in descriptions of twentieth-century verse culture, which is still generally divided into two competing strands. No longer, Izenberg writes, should we decide between "post Romantic and postmodern; symbolist and constructivist; tradi tionalist and avant-garde" (1). Izenberg's canon is a collection rather than a genealogy, united by philosophical presumptions rather than formal commitments. It compares otherwise dispa rate poets through a shared discovery of and commitment to a poetically realized sociality. The meat of Being Numerous considers this commitment in the work of W. B. Yeats, George Oppen, Frank O'Hara, and the Lan guage poets, and Izenberg's detailed, concise readings forward scholarship of each writer as well as of twentieth-century poetry as a whole. Each chapter manages to shift the terms of debate while recognizing the central issues. The book's discussion of Yeats, for example, revives the hoary question of his Shelleyan debt as it dismantles more recent presumptions about his nation alist, eugenicist, or fascist politics. Yeats's ideal poetry, Izenberg argues, would "create the community it imagines," articulating an essential, "transcendental supplement to empirical identity" that is not linked to religious, civic, or racial affiliation (44). This account allows Izenberg to consider Yeats's occultism seriously and precisely, showing how it treats symbols as a psychological heritage and universal truth, as well as to explain Yeats's strangely fervent interest in an Irish coinage and a national museum. Izenberg links these preoccupations to a broader and fundamentally poetic commitment. Izenberg's analysis of Oppen, subsequently, describes a poet much less confident of how to put such commitments into prac tice, since Yeats's voluble poetic enthusiasms seem to contrast with Oppen's twenty-five-year poetic silence. Izenberg shows how the hiatus represents a deepening rather than a cessation of</page><page sequence="4">PHILLIPS • 191 Oppen's art, an art which would scrutinize "what forms of atten tion toward others might be adequate" (85). Drawing on Ludwig Wittgenstein's "private language argument" as well as on Saul Kripke's explanation of that theory (92), Izenberg describes Oppen's recognition of an ineradicable silence between minds; since "all responses [are] sufficiently unlike our own to cast rad ical doubt that we are faced with ... a potentially recognizable fellow person" (94), it "will be all too easy to make mistakes about persons ... to fail to perceive their presence or credit their existence" (95). Oppen's poetry encourages our notice of just that existence, urging "the greatest possible opening of the self to the possibility that a morally salient thing could be present" (106). What Oppen does through scrupulous abstention, O'Hara does through enthusiastic involvement, Izenberg next sug gests—reinterpreting the centrality of taste in O'Hara's work by arguing that O'Hara aims to universalize the very capacity of preference. Not one's choice, but one's act of choosing is the essential thing for this poet, so that all "things that one values . . . are valued in the same way" (128). Critics have variously described O'Hara's blithe appraisals of different proper names— from Herman Melville to Larry Rivers to Bunny to James Dean— as a camp leveling of high and low divisions and/or a coterie limitation of here-and-now insiders. Izenberg, however, shows that O'Hara's habits of citation would overcome segregation among his objects of regard only in order to overcome segrega tion among his fellow regarders. To make everything a matter of taste, Izenberg explains, "is to imagine the replacement of socially divisive distinctions by a universally sharable affect or enthusiasm—a libidinal blush that reconciles the difference between any local colors" (129). O'Hara's "love" thus aims at a redemptive generality as it pursues a relentless locality, presum ing an infinitely capacious context of valued existences—a field coterminous, in Izenberg's description, with O'Hara's vision of poetry itself. Izenberg thus provides a nondismissive reason for why O'Hara's work, more so than others', must be seen whole. So must the work of Language writers, Izenberg goes on to argue. In fact, "indifference" to individual Language works might not be hostile to the movement's aims, since these writers</page><page sequence="5">192 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE "treat their poems neither as semantic tokens nor as aesthetic objects but as experiments or examples" (142). These poems would collectively prove the "collective life" that language manifests (138). This claim, which makes Language writers into paladins of "personhood," seems the most counterintuitive proposition in Being Numerous, given their general hostility to the idea of subjectivity; yet it is also the most useful, clarifying Izenberg's overall project through a surprising application. Lan guage poems, he writes, are "epiphenomenal evidence of a con stitutively human capacity for free and creative agency that is the real object of [the writers'] interest" (142). This interpretation answers the salient question of why a poetry so politically moti vated can produce works so linguistically obscure. It revises the obvious answer to that inquiry: disjunction, in Izenberg's view, is not intended to unsettle assumptions about signification so much as to make us aware of signifying itself. Izenberg therefore links Language theories to a Chomskyan idea of universal gram mar, arguing that grammaticality affirms community through a contemporary and "empiricist updating of Shelley's idealist defense of poetry" (161). Language poets thereby describe an extremity of verse in theory as well as of twentieth-century verse in practice, and Izenberg's analysis of them offers a retrospective trajectory for Being Numerous as a whole. The discussion of Language poets also goes some way toward anticipating objections to Izenberg's study, the welcome ambi tion of which invites questions about limits and presumptions. Izenberg's emphasis on grammaticality suggests why the "capacity" that he isolates is realized in poetry, for example, rather than in other linguistic forms; free from obligations to nar rative sequence and dramatic presentation, poetry has long been the genre to test linguistic meaning-making. Yet even so, Izen berg's grammaticality raises the more basic question of how far language is necessary to the humanly constitutive capacity he describes, especially given Yeats's and O'Hara's alliances with fine art or the Language poets' collaborations with musicians. If a person-valuing function must be noninstrumental in order to achieve the necessary minimalism and universality, there are modes other than poetic language that fit this description—</page><page sequence="6">PHILLIPS • 193 modes other than art, even. It would be valuable to know if, in Izenberg's view, the manifestation of personhood requires semantic constructions and if poetry is the only—or just the best—way to pursue this manifestation. It would also be valu able to know how this poetic pursuit changes our assessment of poets other than Yeats, Oppen, O'Hara, and the Language poets. Being Numerous rightly aims to explain only "a portion of the history of twentieth-century poetry" (31) and acknowledges that there are "poets of the poem" who fall beyond its analysis (34). But the nature of Izenberg's claims makes partiality in both senses more of a problem than usual. Izenberg's accounts of rec ognition seem too specific to encompass what we wish to claim for poetry—twentieth-century or otherwise—even as his project of person-recognition seems too important to be limited to verse. I raise these problems of scope even as I welcome Izenberg's refutation of the "micro-historicism" in new lyric studies: to pro mote "generic variation and difference as prima facie evidence of methodological rigor," he argues, is to neglect "a tradition of poetic thinking in which the insistence upon difference ... is the very problem in need of a solution" (34). Virginia Jackson is the target here, along with a Jackson-indebted tendency for any sal utary suspicion of New Critical abstractions to become an equally suspicious overemphasis on context.1 Izenberg reminds us, in a smart formulation, that "[the] history of poetry's self idealizations is not necessarily itself idealist" (33). I remain unsure, however, whether Izenberg intends his study to be, or begin, such a history, just as I am not sure what sort of "tradi tion," temporal and philosophical, he wishes to claim. His anal yses remain relatively chary about the particular salience of personhood to twentieth-century conditions—how Oppen's socialist disappointment in 1934, for example, differed from the Romantics' political disillusionments more than a century earlier, or how O'Hara's coterie-driven reaction to mid-century America diverges from the artistic constructions of Elizabethan England. Izenberg's study would be strengthened, especially for scholars 1.

I would be interested to know how Izenberg relates his claims to other, frankly transhis torical, definitions of poetry—Mutlu Konuk Biasing's account of a "foundational genre" defined by an individuating, nondiscur sive linguistic system, perhaps, or Susan Stewart's description of "an anthropomorphic project" fostering "individuation under intersubjective terms."2 This clarification might help to answer the biggest uncertainty that Izenberg's study raises, in my reading: how essential is the relation of personhood and sociality that predicates the work? In Izenberg's analysis, being a person means being recognized as a person. But what of those styles and articulations of indi viduation that eschew such recognition? Poetry's linguistic free dom—as a genre not necessarily dialogic, sequential, or performative—might particularly allow for a subjectivity that is designedly ignorant of its appearance to others. Next to the soci ality of a Shelleyan imagination, one could pose the naturalism of a Wordsworthian power, a poetry that discovers personhood through its imbrication in the existent world, or the sensualism of a Keatsian capability, a poetry that discovers personhood through its affirmation of bodily feeling.3 These alternatives mat ter as more than thought-experiments, since Izenberg's connec tion of individuation and intersubjectivity empowers the philosophical—and thus the political—consequence of his anal ysis. A poetry of recognition is "both descriptive and norma tive," he asserts, providing "an ontological claim with moral significance" (17). When Izenberg's introduction slides directly from the idea of "the person" to a description of "the most basic unit of social life" and then "the most fundamental object of moral regard" (1-2), he not only presumes that the status of an "I" comes from the "idea of a 'we'" (4) but also suggests that the 2.

But are these logical moves a historical necessity in a pos tskeptical, hypersecular age, or are they one possibility, among others, for the valuing and value of verse? These are questions more than objections, aspiring to the spirit of Izenberg's own. Just as one can measure the import of Being Numerous in the type of reflections it prompts, one can appreciate the sensitivity of Izenberg's methods in the strain of uncertainty it accommodates. Indeed, the last chapter recalls an attempt at coordinated reading that discovers, precisely in an "experience of its failure," the "most acute" conviction of one's "capacity for collective intentionality" (187). This narrative courts a critical sentimentality, perhaps, in its description of intersubjectivity lost, but it does so in order to alienate our intellectual presup positions, to recognize their affective force, and to specify their philosophical implications. Izenberg's conclusive meditation on known and unknown readers, then, seems to open and invite the readings that this book will generate, as it powerfully, scrupu lously recalls us to the responsibilities inherent in any literary response.
