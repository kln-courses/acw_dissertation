ADJALALA BUILDING, PALACE OF GLELE, MUSEE HISTORIQUE, ABOMEY "Hornbill, it is to you that Se [Segbo-Lisa, destiny, god of heavenly light] gave a burden to carry. If Se gave it to just any bird, it would not be able to hold it. But when Se put it on the head of the horn- bill, this bird supported the weight" (Nondichao 85:10:232).1 Just as the lion, another of Glele's animal symbols (see Part 1), is ruler of the animal realm, so the hornbill, as "the largest bird of all," is identified as king of the birds (Herskovits &amp; Herskovits 1958:205). The hornbill's specific "burden" to which the Abla-Lete sign refers is the horn-like extension at the top of its beak. Comparing himself to this bird, Glele purportedly said: "I am called the horn- bill. The baggage of life does not stay on the head of just anyone. The baggage of the whole country is on my head" (Bokpe 86:6:237).2 Because of its promi- nence in Abla-Lete and its dose identity with Glele's "burdens," the horbill be- came a frequent subject of the arts of Glele's reign. Two sculptures of such a bird sheathed in brass are in the Musee Historique in Abomey (Fig. 1). Another is incorporated into the roof finial of Glele's djeho ("spirit house," literally, "house of beads"), where his soul is be- lieved to reside. Still other depictions of hornbills appear in jewelry, palace bas- reliefs (Fig. 2), doors (Fig. 21), and makpo (royal staffs) associated with Glele's reign. In these works, three features dominate. First is the prominent horn- like protrusion at the top of the beak. Second is the frequent placement of a grain in the bird's beak. This latter detail makes reference to another unique fea- ture identified with the hornbill in Danhome, its ability to eat raffia seeds. In this feature, too, the bird is seen to be an appropriate metaphor for Glele, a king able to crush difficult seeds that other persons are not able to handle.3 A third feature of these hornbill im- ages is the emphasis given to the size and power of the beak itself. As one of his "strong names" Glele chose "All the birds have beaks; that of my man is big- ger" (Agbidinukun 86:7:1623). So too, he purportedly said after a decisive military victory over the Yoruba: "All the birds have their beaks, but that of my man has immeasurable length" (Adande 1962: 51-52).4 Waterlot described this bird this way (1926:pl.17): "Alantan Gbobo, god or famous genie which has the ability to ruin everything. The fabulous bird has a beak which is the strongest and biggest and can seize no matter what. King Glele bragged to be similar to this animal in the same way that he bragged to resem- ble the lion and buffalo." What exactly was the heavy burden that Glele had to bear? First, the burden was economic, grounded in a need to transform the kingdom's economy from one dependent on the slave trade to one based on surplus export, primarily of palm oil. As J. A. Skertchly noted (1874: 67), this was not a period of great wealth on the Danhome coast. To counter this, Glele not only promoted the planting of oil palm farms but also oversaw massive building projects, creating more than a dozen subsidiary "palaces" that were used for the preparation of palm oil. Making the shift to surplus agriculture clearly was not an easy task. Another burden was that of maintaining the in- dependence that his uncle (King Adandozan) and father (King Guezo) had achieved from the Oyo Yoruba. Constant vigilance was encouraged dur- ing Glele's reign against the threat of new attacks. Still another burden that the young king faced was a political one. This was to prove every bit as trying as his eco- nomic and military difficulties. His fa- ther, Guezo, came to power in a coup d'etat. The situation was especially problematic because the ruler Guezo overthrew, King Adandozan, not only was still living, but also seems to have remained in the palace out of public view during much of Guezo's reign. By the time Glele became king, Adandozan, by then quite old, posed little threat to the nation or to Glele himself, but Adandozan's suporters did present many problems. At the end of Guezo's reign they set the palace treasure houses on fire to protest Glele's coming to the throne. Following this deed, the name Adandozan was removed from the offi- cial list of Danhome kings, and his chil- dren were forced into exile. Nonetheless, a number of Adandozan's supporters remained in the capital, some apparent- ly questioning Glele's right to rule. Glele, once secure on the throne, took it upon himself to "replace" many of the artworks that had been lost in the fire.5 Many of the new works covertly refer to Adandozan's rule and eventual over- throw. The hornbill thus represents for Glele both an acknowledgment of the burdens he would have to bear and a sign that in the end he would carry such burdens successfully. In Abla-Lete, the hornbill is associat- ed with another bird, the vulture. In the account published by Melville and Frances Herskovits (1958:206), we read not only about how the hornbill became king of the birds, but also how this bird chose the vulture (carrion crow) to serve as subchief. Based apparently on Abla- Lete, Glele selected as one of his strong names "The animal cannot surpass the king of vultures" (akunto, "father of the sword")(Agbidinukun 86:7:829).6 Im- ages of vultures appear with some fre- quency in the corpus of Glele's art. One such image in silver was among the sculptures he commissioned for his tomb (see below). Vultures were the subjects of other works by various court sculptors and applique artists (Fig. 3). Skertchly observed several representa- tions of vultures in the course of his visit 3. 'THE GUN CUSTOM" (FROM SKERTCHLY 1874:421).

In one parade he noted (1874:204-5) ...a splendid umbrella of green velvet, edged with yellow and crimson. Upon each lappet was a white vulture, with a scarlet and blue eye and violet claws, that was tearing out the entrails of a sky-blue man, with a white waist- cloth and scarlet legs, the man being half the size of the bird. On the summit of the umbrella was a rude carving of a vulture, and the flat top was covered with a row of vultures of similar colours to those of the valence, but having their wings "displayed." On yet another occasion, King Glele was observed by Skertchly "beneath a crim- son and gold umbrella, with blue velvet birds sewn on the lappets" (1874:168). Still another image of a vulture, this one a large sculpture of wood, was paraded in the annual hwetanu ("customs") cere- monies (Skertchly 1874:266). The prevalence of vulture images in the arts of Glele's reign appears also to underscore the important identification of these birds with war and sacrifice. As carrion eaters, vultures were a frequent sight in battle and at religious cere- monies when offerings were made. With respect to the latter, they were identified as messengers to the gods, carrying of- ferings in their beaks up to the heavens (Skertchly 1874:9, 25). Vultures in this way reaffirmed the need for kings (and others) to make appropriate sacrifices. This idea is also reinforced in Abla-Lete (Gankan 86:6:962), for one of the related Fa phrases asserts: "If a harm should beset you, make an offering [vo] and you will escape." Interestingly, Glele is said to have completed more offerings and ceremonies than had previous kings (Adjaho 86:7:1705). A Man of Calm Character: It Is in a Cool Place That the Frog Rests Elizabeth Glele recalls others saying of her grandfather, King Glele, that he was very good to people, "more often mild 4. FROG (FROM THOMPSON 1983:PL. 112). 1858-89? WOOD, SILVER. ARTIST: HUNTONDJI, ALLODE? PRIVATE COLLECTION, PARIS; FORMER COLLECTION CHARLES RATTON, PARIS. mannered than severe" (85:12:147).7 A phrase in Abla-Lete also makes reference to this aspect of his character: "It is there in a cool place that the frog rests."8 Several sculptures of frogs commis- sioned during Glele's reign allude to this quality of calmness identified with the ruler through his divination sign. These include a silver sculpture of a frog (once in the Charles Ratton collection)(Fig. 4)9 as well as several asen (ceremonial staffs). One asen dominated by a brass frog was observed by Skertchly, who dis- cusses its meaning (1874:429): The cresset is a pond about which there are numerous frogs. When- ever there is water in a pond, the frogs in it are a proof of its sweet- ness, therefore a pond without frogs is not fit to drink. Dahomey is a pond, and Glele is the frog in it, without which the water would spoil. Another of Glele's asen (in the Musee Historique, 45-8-154) shows a frog on a TOP: 5.

Still another asen displays this creature on a river bordered by trees (Musee Historique, 45-8-12). The asen was dedicated by King Agoli Agbo to his father, Glele, and refers to a phrase said to have been spoken by Glele: "The frog turns its back to the river and the house is fresh" (Mercier 1952:27). A clay bas-relief in the form of a frog can be seen at Glele's princely palace in Abomey's Djegbe quarter (Fig. 5). This image similarly ap- pears on carved doors (Fig. 21) commis- sioned during his reign. In their close 46</page><page sequence="4">identification with Glele and his divina- tion sign, frogs reinforce essential values of coolness and well-being associated with his period of rule. The crocodile is another animal close- ly linked with Glele that is also identified with coolness and rulership priorities. Like the lion and hornbill, the crocodile appears in the Abla-Lete account of how certain very dangerous animals came to rule others (Herskovits &amp; Herskovits 1958). A series of eight asen in the Musee Historique incorporates images of crocodiles. These works, according to Paul Mercier (1952:39), "evoke a sentence of Glele...: when the crocodile is in the river, then the river does not dry up...." Another sentence about a crocodile at- tributed to Glele (Savary 1967:77) is drawn from other, more aggressive char- acteristics of these reptiles. This phrase notes simply that "the crocodile is not bothered by fish bones."10 In the same way that the lion and hornbill are connected through Abla- Lete with various subchiefs, so the crocodile is said to have an assistant. According to the above Abla-Lete ac- 7. "SPIRIT HOUSES" (DJEHO) WITH ROOSTER FINIALS, FOR KINGS DAKO DONU, HUEGBADJA, AND AKABA (FROM SKERTCHLY 1874:392). count, the crocodile's subchief is a fish called sosogloe (Herskovits &amp; Herskovits 1958:206). This fish too appears in sev- eral of Glele's arts, most importantly on one of his bas-reliefs (Pt. l:fig. 14) and on a door surmounting his tomb house. According to G. Waterlot (1926:pl. 18), the bas-relief image portrays the "recade of Glele" and represents this king under the aspect of "a small fish called sosogloe which is covered with scales, whose very sharpness rips into its aggressors' mouths. These scales remain in the throat of the crocodile, who for this rea- son does not eat this fish."1l Sagbadju, Atinwulise notes that one of Glele's canes terminates in a fish and is called nunonkpoke, "cane to stick the thing" (86:6:1001). According to him: "Both when King Glele went to war and when he returned, he rested on this cane. Afterwards he used the cane to dance on the head of the king defeated by his troops in this war. The cane is also used in the annual ceremonies." Clearly, like the hyena and leopard (the subchiefs of the lion) and the vulture (the hornbill's subchief), the sosogloe fish presents an image of considerable aggression, thus one appropriate to a ruler who was strongly identified with war.

PHOTO: REUNION DES MUSEES NATIONAUX</page><page sequence="5">It may be significant in this regard that many of the art and architectural works commissioned by Glele are mas- sive in scale. One of his thrones is nearly the size of a man. He commissioned a se- ries of gigantic iron weapons (Pt. l:figs. 11-13). Many of the sculptures (wood and iron especially) created during his reign are life size or bigger. Skertchly de- scribed one carving that served as a finial on Glele's large tokpon umbrella structure as "a fetiche figure, about six feet high, leptesenting a woman carrying a powder keg" (1874:353). The asen that Glele com- missioned likewise are said to have been larger than their predecessors, many standing approximately 1.5 meters in height. Glele's auxiliary palaces often were built on an enormous scale. As the court minister Adjaho, Humase explains (86:7:942), "When Glele did things, they became beautiful and big. Before him what was there was not very big."14 Glele is identified with grandiosity through a second phrase in his Abla-Lete sign as well. It notes that "the height does not reach the universe and there will be room left over." Said ultimately to refer to the rainbow serpent, Ayido Hwedo, it suggests that like the rain- bow's, Glele's height is enormous (Sag- badju 86:7:335-36). According to Ag- bidinukun, Kplankun (86:5:322), in this phrase "one is saying that ' am able to maintain a country which extends over the whole of the world....' It means I am capable of surpassing all the people who are in this world." Interestingly, Glele is 10. BAS-RELIEF SHOWING CHAMELEON WITH GUBASA SWORD. 1882-89. CLAY. ARTIST: ASSOGBAKPE, SODJEKAKE.

A Man of Grand Vision: Elephant Said, "There Where I Put My Feet, One Will See My Sign" Grandiosity also is associated with Glele through his divination sign. According to the Abla-Lete phrase that refers to this feature of his character most closely: "The elephant said, 'If I put my feet somewhere, one will see my sign. There where the elephant passes in the forest, one knows' " (Sag- badju 86:7:334).12 Another phrasing of the above observes, "The animal steps on the ground, but elephants step on it with strength" (Ahanhanzo 86:8:327). Or, in yet another variant, identified as a phrase spoken by Glele, "The animal places its paws imperceptibly while the elephant poses his majestically and the earth resounds gueoun gueoun" (Glele 1974:71).13 Not surprisingly the ele- phant appears on several bas-reliefs and arts associated with Glele's reign (Fig. 6). Although this same animal also is identified closely with Glele's father, Guezo, it appears to have be- come for Glele an important referent both to his beloved father and to the grandiosity associated with his own sign and reign. 48 x 0 8 40 z z m 0 8</page><page sequence="6">said to have had an enormous rainbow buried in his palace (Agbanon 86:1:458; Adjaho 86:7:942). References to it ap- pear in the various palace plans (see Waterlot 1926). This rainbow became a focus of rites terminating the annual hwetanu ceremonies.15 In sculptural form, images of rain- bows often take the form of undulating serpents or serpents biting their tails. As such they appear on several of Glele's asen and makpo. Of one of the latter, now in the Musee de l'Homme (89-101-101), Alexandre Adande notes that it is a "styl- ization of Ayido Hwedo-to which Glele compared himself" (1962:44). The image of a rainbow in the form of a serpent bit- ing its tail also appears on the doors to Glele's tomb house (Fig. 20). Portrayals of rainbows, it should be noted, frequent- ly are identified both with Glele's father, Guezo (Mercier 1952:52), and with King Akaba (Adande 1962:75). Still others as- sociate this motif with Agoli Agbo. The Radiant King: When the Sun Comes Out, Everyone Will See It Radiance is another characteristic associ- ated with Glele in conjunction with his divination sign. Especially significant is the parallel drawn between holders of Abla-Lete and Lisa (also called Se and Segbo [great Se]-Lisa), the powerful deity who controls heavenly light (espe- cially the sun), destiny (se), and each in- dividual's spirit identity (also called se). Comparisons between Glele and Lisa appear in several court songs (86:2:425), including the following: We have come to sing your name Glele, the one who cannot be taken You who are the king of the universe We your children We sing your name'6 The Abla-Lete phrase that refers to this association between Glele and Lisa states: "Segbo-Lisa said he is the King and great one of the universe. Thus at daybreak, everyone will see him" (Sag- badju 86:7:335-36). Or, as explained in the context of a brief story from Abla- Lete (Sagbadju 86:7:100): Wind said it would be king....The buffalo said it would be king. The sun said it would be king, if I am not king, I will take my red cos- tume and wear it, and everyone will suffer. [Thus sun became king since] when he wears his red cos- tume, everyone begins to cry. Several of Glele's "strong names" also make reference to his close identity with Lisa (Segbo-Lisa, Se).17 One states, "Se gave the earth to the owner of the earth" (Se nan ayi no)(Adjaho 86:8:283). 13.

Another announces, "One's identity comes from Se" (Se non gni no). Agbi- dinukun explains the latter name as fol- lows (86:7:1818): "When night falls, his representative is here on earth, thus even at night one will see." Glele chose a name related to the link between Lisa and heavenly light: "Life removed the cloth [shade] of the sun, and the uni- verse went to cover it."18 Yet another of his names states, "The eyes that are angry do not look at the brilliant sun" (Agbidinukun 86:7:1825). A number of artworks associated with King Glele make reference to his identifi- cation with Lisa. Pendants that refer to this god are incorporated in many asen from Glele's reign (or in asen dedicated to this ruler). Several of these pendants take the form of a square pierced with a circle or an elliptically sided square (see the pendants dangling from the asen in Pt. l:fig. 5)(Mercier 1952:17).19 0 K&gt; According to an Abomey source cited by Maupoil (1981:546-47), "The circle...rep- resents the domain of the unknowable, or the sky.

Sagbata, we recall, also is identi- fied closely with Glele through his divination sign. Adjaho reaffirms this connection (86:8:171). Of an asen pendant that takes the form of a square within a square, he notes, "One is saying that this is a person who is chief of this entire world (weke)." A square with a circle in the center, on the other hand, he identi- fies with the sun: "The king is like the sun who is the chief of all the country." A large number of asen in the Musee His- torique also incorporate pendants in the form of a flower or fruit from the lise (false cashew) tree (Pt. 1:fig. 5)(see Mercier 1952). These pendants too, I would argue, are closely associated with Glele, the king with whom the majority of the asen in the Musee Historique are identified. Further evidence of this link comes from Skertchly (1874:380), who documents one occasion on which a basket of lise fruit was brought out and displayed while Glele presented a new asen incorporating the image of four red lise fruits. In the se- 49 r</page><page sequence="7">14. ROYAL STAFF (MAKPO) WITH GLASS BLADE (DETAIL). 1858-89. WOOD, GLASS, IRON; ENTIRE STAFF 31.4cm. ARTIST UNKNOWN. MUSEE HISTORIQUE, ABOMEY, 45-2-24. lection of this motif by Glele we can see the use of Danhome verbal-visual image play, for the words flower (se) and fruit (sen) are closely identified with Lisa (also called Se). A second example of visual punning is found in this work as well: the name of the tree, lise, approximates this deity's name, Lisa. Because of the im- portant link between lise trees and Lisa, these trees are planted at the front (east- ern end) of royal palaces, so that each day the first rays of the sun strike their branches before entering the palace itself. Glele's identification with Lisa as the bearer of heavenly light is underscored by his frequent association with images of roosters.20 As Adjaho explains (86: 7:183), "The rooster is identified with Glele [because] It is the rooster that sings first of all in the morning." One of Glele's strong names notes, "Djantadjanta [fero- cious one], it is I who sings in this coun- try" (Agbanon 86:5:666). Silver sculptures of roosters were observed by Skertchly (1874:392) on the roofs of several djeho ("spirit houses") during Glele's reign (Fig. 7).21 Silver boxes surmounted by im- ages of roosters and chameleons also seem to be identified with this king (Fig. 8), as do iron swords whose blades are pierced with the same figures. Chameleons, the animal symbol of Lisa, appear in many of Glele's arts. One such work is an asen in the Musee Historique (Fig. 9). According to Bernard Maupoil (in Mercier 1952:49), this chameleon originally held a solar disk; it was dedicated "to the memory of Glele, illustrating the phrase: Segbo- Lisa (the chameleon) in giving birth to the sun did not need to teach it to walk. In the same way, my father did not need to explain to me how to make war." Appropriately the pendants on this asen consist of stars, another source of heavenly light. Adande similarly links chameleon images that appear in makpo with Glele (1962:52,61)-in one case alluding to Glele's conquest of Doume and a sentence spoken by him on this occasion: "Lisa throws its lance and everything becomes quiet."22 Both Adande (1962:61) and Mercier (1952:49) note, however, that this reptile is also frequently identified with King Akaba. Another image of a chameleon-this one holding a gubasa sword-appears in one of the bas-reliefs on Glele's palace (Fig. 10).23 Still other chameleons appear on a pair of doors commis- sioned by Glele for his tomb house (Fig. 20). The latter portrayals show a chameleon in profile; from beneath its body emerge two ropes that terminate in a crescent moon and a solar disk.24 PHOTO: SUZANNE PRESTON BLIER According to Agbidinukun (86:7:1823), in these works "Lisa [the chameleon] opens the door, and the sun goes out by the cord." Another sculpture commissioned by Glele links him with the sun. It is a fig- ure sometimes identified as daguesu, which holds a sun and moon in its hands (Yemadje 84:6:65; Sagbadju 86:7:346). This work appears in several of the appliques illustrating the history of Glele's reign (Fig. 11). As described by Adande (1976-77:153), the object represents ...a one-legged divinity in anthro- pomorphic form wearing both a skirt like that of a vodun devotee and the attributes of Abomey sol- diers: bullet pouches and sandals. This divinity holds in its hands, perches which are surmounted by a round object and a convex form. The round form is the sun, the convex form is the moon. These are the two principles on which creation depended. The sun is the source of life and light, life which it transmits everywhere. The moon, after having received the light of the sun, reflects it, and its rays have well known effects on the elements of nature and on man. The hair of this divinity is a bit reminiscent of the feathers of a bird. This anthropomorphic divin- ity is called Daghessou...the fe- male Daghessou. Like many of Glele's life-size sculp- tures, this work is believed to have served as a bo (power object) in war. According to Adande, "When the King went to war, he asked this divinity about the most propitious moment to leave. If the night was the best moment, Daghessou raised the moon, and if day was better, it was the sun" (1976-77: 153). Nondichao, Basharu explains the functioning of this object along similar lines (85:10:113-14): This figure of a woman holds both the sun and lunar crescent. If the enemy is attacking the army of our king, the figure raises the moon and it will become black and the enemies will not be able to see well. However if our army is defeating the enemy, the figure will raise the sun and it will be light enough for our army to push on. Glele in this way was able to draw on his identity with Lisa, the god of heav- enly light, in order to alter key atmo- spheric qualities for his own benefit and that of his warriors. His special divina- tion-derived powers in this regard are given further validation through the sculptures he commissioned showing related imagery. A sculpture that was once part of the Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan Collection of African art (Fig. 12; also published in Kerchache et al. 1988:fig. 903) may rep- resent the original version of this fig- ure, which once was credited with the power to manipulate heavenly light for the king's benefit. It portrays a figure whose legs have been carved in the form of a single reptilian-like extremity. The arms (today with missing hands) are raised, and three flat metal pen- dants, similar in shape to those por- 50</page><page sequence="8">trayed in the appliqu6 images of this sculpture, are fastened to the waist. Around the upper arms there appear to be indentations where small calabash containers containing bo (power object) powders could have been attached with cords. These too appear in the ap- plique representations of this figure. Nails protruding from the head suggest that originally additional materials (perhaps the feathers depicted in the applique examples) were attached to the crown. The most unusual feature of this work is its figure-8-shaped mouth. This detail, rather unusual in African art, may allude to the source of Lisa's power. Extending from the mouths of many of the applique versions of these daguesu figures is a multi-part el- ement said to represent the bo's power (Yemadje 84:6:65). Two other figures in the Musee Historique also are identified with this important deity, Lisa, and perhaps ulti- mately with King Glele-the king who took it upon himself to rebuild the royal art corpus after the devastating palace fire set by Adandozan's sons at the end of Guezo's rule. The first of these works is of a figure of a woman who displays a crescent moon in her hand (Fig. 13). At one time she appar- ently held a solar disk. Earlier scholars have tended to associate this carving with Mawu (a deity who is comple- mentary to Lisa and who is generally identified as female and in control of the moon)(Mercier 1954:219).25 Venance Quenum instead asserts that the work represents "Segbo-Lisa. Great god. She carries in her hands a lunar crescent and solar disk" (1984:n.p.). An anony- mous manuscript titled "The Fetishist Religion" (probably written by a mis- sionary, who deposited it in an archive in Nigeria)26 suggests a similar identity for the work: The antique and sacreligious human figure in Glele's palace is a representation of...Lissa, dressed as one of her women fetishers, holding...the sun, in one hand, and Gou, the moon in the other. At least that is how she originally was but when the statue was exposed to the vulgar gaze, the symbol of [the sun] was removed; partly be- cause the sun was of solid gold but chiefly to [illegible] idolatry. Yet another sculpture in the Musee Historique represents a chameleon painted in a bright blue pigment. Today the work is identified with King Akaba (an early ruler associated with great age and hence the slow walk of chameleons), but originally, according to Nondichao (84:10:120-21), it was closely identified with Lisa.27 Thus, like so many other sculptures in the Abomey collection, these figures seem to be at least in part identified with King Glele through his divination sign. Eyes similarly are associated with both Glele and Lisa through the above- discussed phrase of his divination sign: "Segbo-Lisa said he is the king and great one of the universe. Thus at daybreak, everyone will see him." Eyes, like the sun, are closely linked with the idea of visibility.28 One of Glele's "strong names" notes: "It is what the eyes see that they will look at" (kple mon kplekpon). In other words, as Agbidinukun explains for Glele, "As the country already saw me, they should look at me. The eyes of the people should gather to see me" (86:7: 1827). A kpaligan song created for Glele explains this feature of his identity in an- other way (Nondichao 85:11:462): Something that is visible One does not look for it One cannot look for something that is in front of the eyes King Glele is truly free And he is in front of the eyes of everyone This image of Glele as the all-visible, all- seeing, all-seen "eyes" is conveyed in several palace arts. Most important, a pair of eyes appears on two of his doors (Fig. 21). Also related to this idea is Glele's close identification with mirrors and with associated ideas of reflection. The entry into Glele's main palace was called huehonji, "Entry of Mirrors," and appropriately, it was covered with mir- rored glass (Agbidinukun 86:5:99).29 It is referred to in one of Glele's court songs (Agbidinukun 86:7:736): I would like to sing a song here today To do the ceremonies for you at huehonji One should come here to see Agbidinukun explains (86:7:1758): "Glele said in making this entry he was giving an example for the Danhome people. He said that it is King Glele who is the mirror and all should look here to see Danhome clearly." Glele's kpaligan gong and ceremonial ato structure simi- larly are said to have had mirrors on them. Again court songs reaffirm the importance of mirrors in Glele's art cor- pus (Agbidinukun 86:7:1757-58): He said, "I planted a mirrored ato for you As I planted the ato for you in this way At the place called Goho Even if war arrives there I will do this thing before going to battle" One of Glele's strong names also identi- fies him with reflections (ye). This name states, "The reflection does not get lost in the water" (Ye man no bu do sin men). Explaining this name, Agbidinukun notes (86:7:181): "If you look in the water, you will see yourself. Glele is the ye. When one looks, one will see him al- ways." One of the most beautiful and un- usual works identified with Glele and PHOTO: SUZANNE PRESTON BLER 16.

Because the words for "glass" and "mirror" in Fongbe are the same (hue), as is the word for "sun," in this work we see the artistic linking of Glele, Lisa, heavenly light, clear vision, and reflection, as a result of his divina- tion sign. Prosperity and Numerical Increase: The Country Will Be Numerous Like the Leaves of the Yam Plant Glele's reign, his divination sign sug- gests, would be associated with in- crease. According to Agbidinukun (86:7:1757), "Glele did more ceremonies than all others, went to more wars than all others, and built more palaces. His Fa sign said he would have houses in all the lands. He would give birth to chil- dren in every universe." This feature of Glele's reign is expressed in the Abla- Lete phrase "The country will be nu- merous like the leaves of the yam plant" (Dewui 86:6:937).30 Several asen in the Musee Historique collection (Fig. 15) suggest this divination phrase through the depiction of a profusion of yam fo- liage. Explaining the meaning of one of these asen (no. 45-8-163), Bokpe, Tan- manbu asserts that it was "Glele who said Danhome will grow like a yam plant" (86:5:832). Clearly influenced by this feature of his divination sign, Glele also stressed numerical increase in many of the arts associated with his reign. The number of asen made to commemorate family members purportedly increased signifi- cantly in the course of Glele's rule. "In the past there were not many [asen]. They were not numerous or large. One made an asen for the King and for one's father. [But with Glele] things became numerous and one said, 'I will make an asen for my father, my uncle, and my father's cousin' " (Adjaho 86:8:174). The number of bo (power objects) com- missioned by Glele also are said to have increased considerably (Agbid- inukun 86:7:730-31). Likewise, Glele is credited with increasing the number of ato platforms built during the annual hwetanu rites (Adjaho 86:7:1705). One of his asen (Fig. 16) portrays an ato for this reason.31 The importance to Glele of his ato structures also is suggested in one of his court songs (Agbidinukun 86:7:1789): The ato which one planted One went to stand on that ato And the persons who should do the ceremony One brought them all up onto the ato One put the asen on the ato One put a cow on the ato One put all the drums on the ato One went to do the ceremony on the ato Glele was blessed with numerous children, a fact that also coincides with his sign. Over 200 of his sons survived to adulthood. Today, according to one estimate (Glele, Et. 86:5:943), there are over 6,000 of his descendants.32 They clearly have helped to promote both Glele's memory and the knowledge of his reign. One of the ceremonial songs sung by Glele's descendants recounts (86:2:425): When one has children One's name is never lost King, we are your children We don't want money We don't want cloth If you have children The day of your death They will raise up your name This feature of Glele's posthumous iden- tity also appears in his divination sign. One related phrase observes that "the gblangbe grasses will never be lost in the forest" (Gankan 86:6:962). In other words, gblangbe grasses, like other weeds, always grow back, no matter how carefully one clears a forest. Be- TOP: 17. WANKON PALACE, CANA. 1858-89.

Remembering Glele: The Anvil Remains Forever Another divination phrase from Abla- Lete referring to associated features of Glele's future identity does so through the image of the indestructibility of the blacksmith's anvil: "One does not sharp- en the knife on the anvil and then strike the anvil with it" (Agbidinukun 86: 5:644). In other words, if you hit an anvil with a knife, even a sharpened one, only the knife will be harmed by this act.33 Glele selected this phrase in turn as the source for one of his strong names: "Nature placed the anvil in the forge and it stayed there for eternity" (GIele 1974:71). As Nondichao observed in ref- erence to this name (85:10:233): "The anvil will stay there always. The forge it- self may disappear, the room may be de- stroyed, but the anvil will be there forever. Glele is the anvil; his rame will be there for all time." An anvil (in the characteristic form of a hard rock) for this reason appears on one of the makpo asso- ciated with Glele, now in the Musee de l'Homme in Paris (no. 23.1.91)(Adande 1962:63).34 Anvils are also frequently identified with architecture and shrines associated with Glele. The adandjeho ("courageous house of beads")-built by Glele to house both the sculptures of the iron warrior and the immense knives dis- cussed in Part 1 of this article contains two large stones that once served as anvils.35 According to Nondichao (85: 10:223-24): Glele put two stone anvils in here saying, "I am the king in this land. I can die one day, but the kingdom is a richness, and will not die." Glele baptized these stones with the name anvil, and he became immortal. The smith who hits the anvil with a hot iron will die, but his sons will come to work at the forge stone in his place. The build- ing that protects these stones also will be demolished, but the stones always will remain. Hard stones like those described above became for Glele one of his most impor- tant forms of bo. Such bo stones were placed in various palace shrines, as well as at the entrances to ancillary palace structures-often buried in the ground (Adjaho 86:8:283). One such anvil bo PHOTO: SUZANNE PRESTON BLIER called kaka yi, "until the end [of the earth]," is said to be buried in front of the door of Glele's main huehonji palace entry. Another is buried in front of Glele's palace at Djegbe. Still another is said to be found in front of Glele's palace at Cana. This latter palace (Fig. 17) also draws on the image of an anvil in its name. It is called Wankon, literally, "next to the anvil."36 An additional palace identified through its name with an anvil was built by Glele at Agunli.37 Glele named this palace Zagnanado, which means in Fongbe, "Night will fall first." According to Agbidinukun (86:5:667) this strong name comes from an Abla- Lete phrase: "Thirty piles of wood can- not serve to cook a hard stone [anvil] so that this stone will be cooked. Night will fall first." In other words, no amount of cooking will soften an anvil. Although Glele's name and reputa- tion were to remain intact long after his death, the demise of the kingdom (mere- ly five years after he died) is said to have been foreshadowed in his Fa sign. Several phrases from Abla-Lete are seen to refer to this eventuality. One of the most frequently cited asserts, "The round house has no back" (Ayido 86:5:262; Dewui 86:6:937). If "back" is understood in a temporal context to mean "behind," this phrase suggests that a circular building has no future (we re- call that to, the word for circle, also means country). In explanation, Dewui, Donatien observes of someone with the Abla-Lete sign, "After he dies, his family will be ruined" (86:6:938). Maupoil notes similarly for this Abla-Lete phrase that "The house of Glele, his belongings, and even his acts, all would be annulled by his death" (1981:321).38 To try to mitigate this problem, Glele's djeho (Fig. 18) is dif- ferent from all other royal djeho in that it is square rather than round. Still another Abla-Lete phrase that makes reference to problems after Glele's death does so through the image of the horse. This phrase notes that "the horse's life will be easy, it will have lots of water, but still it will stop to drink in the hole of the antelope." Dewui explains this div- ination phrase as it relates to Glele: "In the end, he will lose everything" (86:6:938). Horses appear frequently in the context of Glele's arts. Their appear- ance, however, is mostly linked to mili- tary scenes. As Agbanon, Ayidonubokun Kunglo notes (86:1:459), "The horse is the animal for Glele." One of this king's asen shows a horse beside a basket-ac- cording to Maupoil (in Mercier 1952:32) a reference to Glele (Fig. 19). Together the images of the horse and basket al- lude to the demise of a family, since sosu (horse-basket) forms part of the word so- sumasede (meaning "Tomorrow I should again hear something"), the name of a rat whose bite is said to be fatal. Horses, it should be noted, also are identified closely with Guezo, Glele's father (Mercier 1952:32). The demise of the state after Glele's death is suggested in Abla-Lete in yet an- other way. According to one phrase, "The coconut is pretty but the water it encloses is bad" (Dewui 86:6:937). In other words, Dewui explains, "The person is good, but will give birth to spoiled children."39 An equally poignant Abla-Lete verse asserts: "Forty-one sticks hit the child of the chief Abla. His oldest child will always be hard of hearing." No matter what one tells one's children, it was explained, they will never hear it (Dewui 86:6:937). Suggested here is the belief that Glele was a monarch of great power and majesty, yet in the end the achievements of his reign would be lost because those who followed his rule were not blessed with equally fortuitous lives. Destiny and Dynastic Reflection: Glele's Mortuary Arts As we have seen, critical features of Glele's identity and art derive from his divination sign. These works comprise a range of genres: figures in various 53 k -- - - ,</page><page sequence="11">PHOTOS: MUSEE DE L'HOMME media, bas-reliefs, asen (memorial staffs), makpo (staffs of office), jewelry, appliques, buildings, and shrine objects, among others. The fact that Glele select- ed his royal name from the Abla-Lete phrase "The cultivated field is difficult to move" and then was identified with several artworks representing this theme underscores the quality of inter- nal strength that he wished others to as- sociate with him. This feature of di- vinely sanctioned individual strength served him well both in maintaining power within the state and in dealing TOP. 20.

Certain characteristics of danger linked to Glele through his divination identity with lions, leopards, hyenas, crocodiles, and vultures as well as the great stress on weaponry and battle scenes in his reign and arts signaled that he was a ruler who had to be treated with great care. This emphasis also helped to promote obeisance within the state and success for Glele's troops in battle. Like the elephant and sky-spanning rainbow of Abla-Lete, enormous scale also came to be identified with Glele's reign and arts. And, as with Lisa, the chameleon-like deity of heavenly light who appears in Abla-Lete, Glele was as- sociated with great visibility and lumi- nosity. Artworks commissioned during his reign show a concern with cha- meleon imagery, solar disks, lunar cres- cents, eyes, and mirrors. So too, the importance of the hornbill in Glele's various arts helps us to understand not only the difficult burdens that Glele saw himself as having to carry, but also his divinely acquired abilities to succeed in related endeavors. The identification of Glele with a calm ("cool") and bountiful reign, which was likewise foreshadowed in his divination sign, finds multiple ref- erences in the images of frogs and yam leaves within his courtly arts. The artworks commissioned by Glele for his own tomb also draw their im- agery primarily from his divination sign. These works include a pair of doors (one of them is illustrated in Fig. 20), now in the Musee de l'Homme, that appear to have been originally located on Glele's tomb house (adoho).40 Their range of mo- tifs at first glance belies easy interpreta- tion. Each door is divided by its frame into two scalloped-edged rectangles. The associated motifs have been separately carved, painted, and then attached with nails. The imagery on both doors is simi- lar. The upper panels incorporate a chameleon positioned on a bar from which two cords extend. A solar disk is attached to one of these cords and a cres- cent moon to the other. Underneath the chameleon is a gubasa sword. Elsewhere on the door panels are various makpo. One door has three (the first surmounted by a ram's head, the second by a bird, the third by a fish); on the door shown in Figure 20 only a single makpo appears (its crooked form identified variously with Glele and Guezo). Images of shells, iden- tified with both Lisa and with Glele, are carved in the lower right and left corners of the top of this door.41 The bottom sections of these two doors also share key features, most im- portantly the image of a serpent biting its tail. (On the door not illustrated here, the serpent is missing, but its original shape can be detected in the contrasting paint tones.) Also presented in the lower panels are carvings of two rifles and a large flat-bladed sword (denkpe). An ad- ditional curved sword (akpolo) appears on the door in Figure 20; on the other, the pigment suggests a missing makpo. In the same way, while the image of a lion is found on only one door, there is a space on the other (Fig. 20) where such an image might have been placed. The upper right and left corners of these lower panels display carvings of shells. As is evident from the above, the im- agery on these doors has its primary source in Glele's divination sign. The chameleon refers to Glele's visibility, lu- minosity, and ties to Segbo-Lisa; the lion alludes to his ferocity; the rainbow ser- pent is linked to themes of grandeur. The guns and gubasa swords for their part suggest Glele's courage, military prowess, and links to the war and iron god Gu. Together these signs suggest key ways in which Glele wished to have his life remembered. A third and fourth door (Fig. 21), while similar in form to the other two, incorporate different motifs. Within the top section of both we see an elephant, a horse, a hornbill, a round-headed sword (aligonuhwi), a knife, and four frogs. The lower part of these doors contains an an- telope as well as a dog, a pair of eyes (with a nose), a rifle, a smith's hammer, a makpo, and four frogs. These doors thus include references to Glele's spon- soring ancestor, Agbanlikoce (the ante- lope and the dog), difficult burden (the hornbill), visibility (the eyes)(see Pt. 1),42 and military strength (the sword and knife). The general well-being or cool- ness identified with Glele's reign also is alluded to here (the frogs). Included in this work as well is a reference to Glele's father, Guezo (the smith's hammer). The elephant and horse likewise may at once refer to Glele (the former to his grandeur, the latter to the problems that would follow his reign) and to Guezo. These doors, which are slightly larger than the previous pair, may have been commissioned by Glele for the tomb of his father or the "bush king" (see note 44). Taken together, the two sets of doors suggest striking ways in which Glele's divination sign made an impact on arts commissioned in his reign. An additional corpus of mortuary works identified with Glele comprises a group of sculptures commissioned by this king to surmount his own tomb. The works in question were observed by 54</page><page sequence="12">Skertchly (1874:256) in his visit to Glele's court in 1871. They include ...[a] tall silver candelabrum in the form of a tree, about five feet high, with candles of silver, a six foot sil- ver stork, a crow, an immense sil- ver skull, and a smaller silver tree about four feet high, all the work- manship of the royal silver- smith....These are the fetiche allegorical ornaments that will sur- mount the grave of the present king. The candelabrum will show that he was the light of the nation; the stork that he was a wise man; the crow that he was valiant; the skull that he conquered many ene- mies and took their skulls; and the tree that, like a flourishing tree his kingdom prospered under his reign. Glele was clearly proud of these objects and displayed them in the parade that constituted a central part of the annual ceremonies (Skertchly 1874:355). Like the two sets of doors, these tomb sculptures seem to have important grounding in Glele's divination sign. In these works we are presented with the image of a king who wished to be remembered as the light and beacon of his nation. For this reason he commissioned a tall can- delabrum, a foreign lighting device that recalls in key respects Glele's divination ties to Lisa, the god of heavenly light. At the same time Glele's identity as a ruler of great wisdom is underscored through the commissioning of a sculpture of a "stork" (long-necked bird, adohe). This bird appears here because of its connec- tion with yet another Abla-Lete phrase, "Water suffices to kill the [long-necked bird] while it is bent over drinking" (Gleason 1973:261). At the same time this bird is important to Glele as a reference to the brother whom he outwitted in pursuing his divinely sanctioned path to become king (Adjaho 86:7:182; Agbi- dinukun 86:7:711-12)43 as well as to Glele's sponsoring ancestor, Agban- likoce, a man identified as a tohosu ("King of the Water"). The principal symbol of tohosu worship is a long- necked water bird. Other sculptures of long-necked birds were commissioned by Glele in the course of his reign (Fig. 22). Skertchly described one such work as a "large silver stork on the top of a sil- ver tree, the whole mounted on a four wheeled truck" (1874:260). The vulture (carrion crow), identified in Abla-Lete as both the subchief of the hornbill and the bird that carries offerings 22. LONG-NECKED BIRD. 1858-89? WOOD, IRON, BRASS, PIGMENT; 135cm.

The inclusion of a gigantic skull among these tomb arts in turn underscores Glele's role as a power- ful military leader and slayer of state ene- mies. Skertchly notes that similar skulls of silver hung from girdles worn by the state executioner, Migan (1874:248). Finally, in this corpus of tomb works, we see an image that identifies Glele as a ruler who, like the "hunter's tree" (gbetin-gbe meaning both "hunter" and "life"), served to symbolize prosperity (the gath- ering together of many individuals).44 Another important mortuary art form identified with King Glele consists of the hotagatin (literally, "iron tree on the head of the house"), which was created during the reign of Agoli Agbo to serve as a finial for Glele's djeho or adoho.45 In this sculpture, a roaring lion is shown inside a building whose roof supports two gubasa swords and a hornbill (Fig. 23). Of this imagery Nondichao explains (86:6: 58), "The kingdom is like a house, the army is the lion, the armaments protect the land, and the hornbill is like the king who is informed about all that happens inside and outside the realm." Herein is presented an image of Glele as someone MUSEE DES ARTS AFRICAINS ET OCEANIENS, PARIS, AF 68DN5905. FORMER COLLECTION GENERAL DODDS. SUZANNE PRESTON BLIER PHOTO: SUZANNE PRESTON BLIER at once dangerous (the lion), blessed with iron-like strength (the gubasa swords), and committed to shouldering the vari- ous burdens of the state (the hornbill). The building portrayed in this work is said to represent the shrine that contains the gbetinsa sculpture (Adjaho 86:7:580; see Pt. l:fig. 19), where many of the pro- pitiatory ceremonies for war were under- taken (Fig. 18). The important identi- fication of the gbetinsa temple with the life-giving properties of the fon tree in turn alludes to the idea that Glele's mem- ory would never be forgotten.46 As in Glele's tomb doors, and many of the other arts I have discussed here, the larger corpus of mortuary sculptures commissioned by (and for) Glele reveals the variant ways in which this king's life and identity are seen to merge with his divination sign. Taken as a group, these arts present us with a strikingly power- ful portrait of a Danhome king who died just over a century ago and who still today is spoken of with great awe (and even fear). In these arts, important ideas emerge about dynasty, destiny, represen- tation, and royal prerogative in the kingdom of Danhome. Rather than de- limiting those features which distinguish Glele's physical appearance, demeanor, psychological state, or regal attire, these arts reveal a portrait of a man whose ac- complishments, desires, and identity were defined first and foremost through his divination sign. Emphasizing divina- tion attributes that are divinely sanc- tioned, these arts offer us a unique view of how rulership and state arts were framed in Danhome with respect both to the larger context of royal destiny and to critical features of state religion, cosmolo- gy, politics, and history. C Notes, page 101 55</page><page sequence="13">torians working in Cote d'Ivoire during the 1970s report having purchased slingshots from the local markets. 16. Ladislas Segy, a prominent dealer in African art, illus- trates the collector's negative attitude toward Western influ- ence when he writes, "...when actual European penetration undermined the ideological background for carving the art- work [of Africa] degenerated" (1958:23). And, in a similar vein, art critics Paul Guillaume and Thomas Munro once wrote: "...the coming of the white man has meant the pass- ing of the negro artist; behind remains only an occasional uninspired craftsman dully imitating the art of his ancestors, chipping wood or ivory into a stiff, characterless image for the foreign trade" (1926:13). 17. In a sample of about 500 slingshots, which I saw over the course of one year in the stock of several traders, over half were painted with bright enamel colors. 18. Potassium permanganate is used extensively by traders both to stain wood and darken brass. It is purchased in phar- macies in the form of a dark-purple crystalline compound, which is then mixed with water and applied with a tooth- brush. The stain imitates the effect of natural indigenous dyes used by African carvers. 19. Objects are often damaged or broken during their trans- portation along the trade routes that move objects from rural to urban areas. Traders are skilled at repairing cracks and fractures with scraps of wood and a mixture of sawdust and commercial white glue. In the Plateau marketplace in Abidjan, two carvers made their living by repairing broken objects for art traders. 20. Shifting demand, diminishing supply, and the associated transformation of "gift" into "commodity" is, of course, not unique to the African art market. Commenting on the vicissi- tudes of commercial fishing in New England, for instance, a Boston fisherman clearly echoes the remarks made by the Wolof trader from Bouake: "Who can say what fish is worth. It's not like we have any control over what we bring in. I've had trips when everything went right. All we had to do was drop the nets and the nicest-looking fish you ever saw jumped in. Other times we go out, work our butts off, and still come back with stuff we used to give away" (quoted in Smith 1989:26, emphasis added). 21. It is not merely a coincidence that the market for African colonial figures should be expanding at the same moment as the market for American folk art (see C. Vogel 1988). Many colonial figures and folk sculptures, I would argue, bear a number of formal aesthetic similarities (rigid posture, elabo- rate detail of garments, crisply creased pant legs, etc.). Furthermore, both have comparable surface wear and paint erosion, and both are usually carved on their own stands (see examples of American folk art in Miele 1988). 22. In 1974, Daniel Crowley reported on similar "treatment" of painted Guro masks: "[Although] the enameled masks have actually been used in Guro rituals, and hence are 'traditional art,' [this] does little to improve their popularity with foreign- ers, so the wise traders often cover the shiny polychrome with dull paint before putting them on the market" (1974:57). 23. Because there is no sharp distinction between the market- ing of old and new objects (i.e., both types of objects are sold in the same places and often by the same merchants), one must combine under the same analytic canopy the market for antique colonial statues and the one for contemporary figures manufactured for external trade.

BLIER: Notes, from page 55 I am grateful to the following funding sources that provided the financial support necessary to carry out the research and writing of this article on Danhome: John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship; the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton; Fulbright Senior Research Fellowship; and the Social Science Research Council Fellowship. To the many individuals in the Republic of Benin who helped in this project, I also owe my deepest gratitude not only for granting research permission and for allowing me to photograph objects in the Musee Historique in Abomey, but also for enriching me as to the meanings and histories of these works. All the French trans- lations in the text are my own. For other studies on Danhome (Fon) art see especially Adams (1980), A. Adande (1962), C. E. Adande (1976-77), Bay (1985), Blier (1988a, b), Crowley (1986), Herskovits (1938), Mercier (1952), Savary (1967, 1975), and Waterlot (1926). 1. In this article, field-note journal citations appear in the fol- lowing way: the first two digits refer to the year of research (for example, 85 equals 1985); the second one or two digits, to the month (for example, 10 equals October); the third in this series of digits to the page(s) of that month's journals. 2. Glele also is said to have uttered: "Se will put a burden on my head and I will support it" (Sagbadju 86:7:334). 3. Glele is credited with saying: " 'It is not a simple bird that swallows the raffia seed. A simple bird will eat it and will die.' That which Glele does, a simple man cannot do" (Bokpe 86:6:237). Although Alexandre Adande concurs that the hornbill is identified with Glele, a makpo portraying a horn- bill with a raffia grain in its mouth (Musee de l'Homme, 89-101-45) is attributed by him (1962:40) to King Kpengla. 4. Mercier and Lombard note (1959:30): "The hornbill 'alan- tan gbogbo' is the symbol of Glele. At the same time it is the bird whose beak is the strongest, thus it can seize all his ene- mies." It should be mentioned that several birds with large beaks but without the characteristic horn-like protrusion of the hornbill are also identified as representing alantan gbogbo. 5. In part for this reason, the vast majority of artworks in the Musee Historique in Abomey are associated with the reign of Glele or his successors. 6. Another Fongbe word for vulture is aklansu. 7. A phrase from a song presented in the annual ceremonies makes reference to this part of Glele's character: "Rancor is not good for King Glele" (Agbidinukun 86:2:27). 8. Still another Abla-Lete phrase asserts: "Let me alone so I can rest" (Sagbadju 86:7:334-35). The latter saying is said to underscore the fact that Glele did not like people approach- ing him with problems. 9. Robert Farris Thompson, who published this work (1983:175), suggests that the frog's presence "correlates with water's coolness, hence with peace imposed by statecraft that is strong and just" (1983:176). 10. The crocodile also is identified with kings Agaja, Kpengla, and Guezo (Savary 1967:77; Forbes 1851:78). 11. One of Glele's strong names observes: "The fish of the river began to fight and the net went to separate them" (Agbi- dinukun 86:7:1826). In other words, Agbidinukun explains, "I am the king of Danhome and I will calm all the bad things." For this reason one of Glele's roof finials (hotagatin) displays a fish and a hook (Bokpe 86:5:821). Regarding the meaning of this work, Bokpe notes that "when the hook takes the fish in the river, it is ready to come to shore" (86:5:834). 12. This phrase was selected by Glele as the source of one of his strong names (Agbidinukun 86:7:406 and 86:7:1827). References to Glele as an elephant also appear in court songs: "As you left to break Ketu/The fury that you manifested there suits you well/All animals have ears/But the ears of the elephant are larger than all other ears" (Agbidinukun 86:7:1768). Mercier and Lombard note (1959:31), "The ele- phant symbolizes...Glele, whose power is compared to this animal since he beat his traditional enemy at Ketu." 13. According to E. Dunglas (1957:133), after taking Ketu, Glele created the following song: "Anago of Ketu/Your words do not go with your courage/All animals have ears/The elephant has the biggest." Images of elephants also appear on calabashes referring to proverbs intended to express one's love or affection. One such image of an ele- phant is described by Savary as signifying: "When elephant passes, all animals hear the noise of its steps [meaning in the context of the calabashes]. I fear no one and all the world will hear me"(1967:88). 14. This concern with large scale also coincided with interests in monumentality in public and religious art in Europe at this 101</page><page sequence="14">time. Glele surely saw the large plaster images of saints brought to Abomey in 1856 and displayed at the palace (Repin 1860:87). Repin and various other European travelers who came to the court also informed him of prevailing inter- ests in European palace architecture and city plans. 15. Another "rainbow" is said to have been buried in the Atakinbaya palace in Abomey before Glele's reign. The rain- bow in Glele's palace, however, is believed to have been much larger (Adjaho 86:7:942). Appropriately the name of Glele's rainbow is jisoke (ji=sky; so=takes; ke=world, uni- verse), a word referred to in Able Lete. A temple for this rainbow also is found near Glele's palace in Djegbe quarter. 16. Another song also makes reference to Glele and Segbo- Lisa: "Se counted 40 things and one of surplus/It is Lisa who is Glele" (Agbidinukun 86:7:1762-63). 17. Interestingly, se also means destiny. 18. M. A. G1ele annunciates this "strong name" as follows (1974:71): "Nature deployed the cloth of the sun and the uni- verse dressed in it; which means the sun shines for all the world. I am the great king, whose reign will be beneficial for everyone without exception." Another of Glele's "strong names" notes: Kliji klibibi; "It is a great cloth that only the king wears" (Adjaho 86:8:286). Still another of his strong names asserts: De de hli dagba bo zun so xia; "It is slowly that the earth became grand" (illuminated-i.e., day lightens slowly) (Agbidinukun 86:7:1818). Yet another Glele strong name suggests: "The king without spots, it is life that created the sun without spots" (Agbidinukun 86:7:1818). 19. Although Mercier identified these pendants with Agoli Agbo because they are called flaflen gbendodo, and gbendo is the quarter in Abomey where Agoli Agbo's palace is found, the term gbendoto also means "creator of the world." 20. It appears that the reason why someone identified with the Abla-Lete sign cannot wear akoko cloth is because in Fongbe one of the meanings of the word ako is "cry of the rooster." (The phoneme ke is the verb "to crow." ) Likewise such persons cannot eat the kokolo yam. The word for rooster in Fongbe is koklo. 21. These roosters are described as surmounting the "tombs" of kings Wegbadja (Aho), Dako Donu (Daho), and Akaba. Savary also identifies the images of a rooster and chameleon with King Agaja (1967:81). 22. A. Adande links Glele with chameleons in the context of another phrase as well: "Dahomey should imitate the walk of the chameleon, it should not run" (i.e., nothing should be done with haste) (1962:52). 23. A pendant on a royal asen that portrays a chameleon with a gubasa sword (Musee Historique, 45-8-149) is identified by Mercier with the gods Lisa and Gu (1952:65). These deities, it should be noted, are closely associated with Glele. Other pendants on this asen include a pair of eyes, a nose, and four guns. These symbols also are identified closely with Glele. Mercier observes (1954:223): "Gu is specially linked with Lisa, strength and the sun....Lisa comes down to earth hold- ing Gu in his hand in the form of a gubasa." 24. Of an asen with a crescent moon, Mercier notes (1952:31): "This pendant alludes to Glele: 'the light of the moon lights up, that of the son of Guezo throws its light all over.' " Mercier associates a pendant from another asen, in the form of a solar disk, with Glele's father, Guezo, in that it "evokes the grandeur (light) of Guezo" (1952:38). In view of the important connection between Glele and the sun, however, this image could also be identified with Glele. 25. I disagree with the common practice among Danhome scholars of conjoining the deities Mawu and Lisa by refer- ring to them as a single power, Mawu-Lisa. While they are correlated in certain respects (as are a number of other Danhome deities), each of these gods has its own identity, temples, devotees, and ceremonies. 26. This manuscript was later copied by the Musee Historique guide Nondichao, Basharu, who unfortunately failed to document the locale of the text. Dating this manuscript is difficult, but most probably it was written in the early part of this century A reference to the world of W. Seabrook on page 6 indicates that it postdates the latter source. Most of the text deals with Danhome religion. 27. Chameleons also appear in Danhome proverbs; see Herskovits 1938:346-47. 28. One of Glele's strong names observes: "Ahostu lsunda man no zo n nukun ("The king, the eyelids don't stay at a dis- tance for the eyes")(Agbidinukun 86:7:1830). One of the Abla-Lete sayings asserts similarly: "Segbo-Lisa said he is the King and great one of the universe. Thus at daybreak, everyone will see him." Images of eyes also appear in cal- abash carvings, which are used to communicate feelings between lovers. According to Savary (1967:87), the pair of eyes that appears on one such calabash refers to the proverb "My eyes are fixed on you"; in other words, "I am thinking about you and watching over you." 29. As Agbidinukun explains (86:5:653-55): "The mirrors were on the walls and doors. He did that to be beautiful and distinct." Mercier and Lombard suggest instead that it was the adjalala palace building that was called huehonme, "palace of mirrors" (1959:18). Quenum, however, supports the iden- tification of Glele's entry with this name (1986[2]). He calls this structure ouehondji. 30. Abla-Lete references to plenty also can be seen in the name Glele chose to call his princely palace. This name, Djegbe, derives from the following Abla-Lete phrase: "If a woman wants to prepare a good sauce she must be on the 'road of salt"' (Djegbe: salt [dje]; road [gbe]) (Ayido 86:5:264). According to Agbanon (86:3:903): "We say, 'The tongue does not refuse the words of salt."' Stated another way, the phrase asserts: "To know the savor of salt one has to put the tongue to it" (Glele, Et. 86:5:941). Like the yam leaf, plenty (here, salt) is closely identified with Glele's reign. 31. Today this asen is also sometimes identified with King Agaja (1708-40), the first king to employ such structures in the annual ceremonies. 32. Another of the Abla-Lete phrases notes that while many of his children would live, many also would die: "Kokolo (a yam) made wealth, but that which is found in the earth sur- passes that which is outside" (Dewui 86:6:937). 33. Glele also drew on these phrases of his Abla-Lete sign for several of his strong names. One of these is pronounced tun tun man gba wan, or "Forging does not break the anvil" (Agbidinukun 86:7:1820). Another notes: Se ji wan b'e jijon kaka yi, or "Se [destiny] gave birth to the anvil and it lived a long time" (Agbidinukun 86:7:1819). Mercier and Lombard note that the anvil is also identified with Guezo (1959:16). 34. This work is said by A. Adande to make reference to a phrase associated with Glele: "To scratch a hard rock with one's nails is done in vain; no one can cause it harm in this way" (A. Adande 1962:63). A related Abla-Lete saying asserts: "One does not scratch the stone with one's finger- nail" (Agbidinukun 86:5:644; 7:395; Gankan 86:6:964). One of Glele's kpaligan songs similarly states: "Something that is metal one cannot scratch with the fingerail. If one does, the nail will be ruined" (Nondichao 85:11:462). 35. Mercier and Lombard note (1959:18): "Against the wall [of the adandjeho] are three large stones which rest against the plat- form of beaten earth. Two stones represent anvils and symbol- ize the saying that Fa (divinity of destiny) gave to Glele: God placed the anvil in the forge and it will be there always." 36. Wankon is situated to the east of Cana, it was explained, because it was in this place that "Glele had made offerings to Fa" (Agbidinukun 86:5:644). 37. This palace, like Wankon, was built along the military route leading to the Yoruba. 38. Ayido translates this another way (86:5:264): "If you die, the things that were good in your time will be spoiled in back of you." 39. For more information on Glele's identification with coconuts see Mercier (1952:53). 40. The form of these doors (excluding imagery) is very similar to that of doors currently located in the tomb building (adoho) of Glele in the Musee Historique in Abomey The fact that the Musee de 1'Homme doors were made in pairs is consistent with this attribution, for on each of the royal tomb houses are also two doors. The doors located within Glele's tomb building today measure 136 cm x 80 cm in one example and 138 cm x 80 cm in the other. The Musee de l'Homme doors are slightly larger. One pair (MH 93.45.6 and MH 93.45.7) measures 156 cm x 90 cm and 165 cm x 95 cm respectively. The other set of doors (MH 93.45.4 and MH 93.45.5) measures 174 cm x 95 cm and 173 cm x 105 cm. The slight inconsistency with respect to the earlier and later doors is not particularly troubling since with earthen architecture the frames of the doors can be easily replaced and probably were adjusted to fit the size of the replacement doors. The Musee de 1'Homme doors, it should be noted, are too small for any of the palace entrances or adjalala buildings. Palace djeho, for their part, do not have doors. These doors appear to have been carved by Sosa Adede, Likohin Kankanhu, the famous court artist who created the life-size lion and shark figures now in the Musee de l'Homme. 41. This mollusk is identified with Glele because following an encounter with the King of Seke he purportedly said: "As courageous as it is, the snail only leaves its shell when it is exposed to fire" (A. Adande 1962:66). The image of a snail also appears on a makpo dedicated to Glele (Musee de 1'Homme, 30-21-72). 42. Savary suggests that this image is identified instead with Tegbessu (1975:75). 43. Adjaho notes that the bird with the long neck repesents a child born to Guezo the same day as Glele (to a different mother)(86:7:182). Glele took the name "Your bird is coura- geous in the beak [but did not trap anything]" (he ton gla be) to insult this brother who had later opposed his coming to the throne. Another name assumed by Glele in response to his brother, was "The fool who greets his father does so incorrectly saying, 'Whele ye whele ye.' " 44. A tree, this one incorporating birds and antelopes, had been commissioned by Guezo as a finial for his djeho, "spirit house" (Skertchly 1874:424). Glele also commissioned a sil- ver skull and a sculpture of a monkey climbing a tree for the tomb of his "bush king," Addokpon. Skertchly notes that "the skull shows that he too conquered many enemies, and the monkey and tree that the bush, i.e. Dahomey, was so much liked that foreigners came to settle there, that, like the monkey they might possess some of its riches" (1874:256). As Edna Bay has pointed out (1979:10-13), the bush king is a veiled allusion to King Adandozan, the ruler Glele's father removed from power; Adandozan is purported to have lived through much of Glele's reign. 45. A photograph in the photo archives of the Musee de 1'Homme appears to show this sculpture on top of a tokpon applique identified as covering the royal tomb in Abomey. Imagery on this applique-including the prominent figure of daguesu-identifies it with Glele. The photo would appear to date from this century. 46. Other works also incorporate a multiplicity of divination signs. One of these is a makpo in the Musee Historique (45-2-78) that incorporates a cross, a chameleon, and a horn- bill. Adande identifies this imagery with three different kings (1962:103)-the cross with Agaja, the hornbill with Glele, and the chameleon with Akaba. Quite possibly, how- ever, these three motifs refer to different phrases and fea- tures of Glele's life sign-the cross to his identification with Segbo-Lisa (the cross is an important symbol of this god), the chameleon to Glele's identification with this same god, the horbill to his burdens. Another work with multiple divination imagery is the brass warrior sculpture formerly in the Ratton collection (Pt. :fig. 1; Thompson 1983:pl. 108): As Thompson notes (1983:169): "When this image arrived in Paris, near the end of the nine- teenth century, it was still dressed in its complement of ritual garments...a brass hat for Age (the Dahomean god of hunt), a cloak in Dahomean-made raffia cloth, a brass pendant and sil- ver charm, and a loincloth of the kind Dahomeans...associate with forest cultivators, hence suggestive of brute forest ener- gies." As I have already noted, the brass figure and associated gubasa swords allude to the Abla-Lete phrase "The coura- geous sword gave birth to Gu and vengeance continues." However, both the brass pendant (in actuality the togodo neck- lace; Pt. 1:fig. 8) and the figure's loincloth are drawn from another divination phrase: "The cultivated earth [country] is difficult to move." The brass hat, in its identification with the hunting and forest god, Age, in turn may refer to Glele's ancestral sponsor (the hunter Agbanlikoce). Alternatively this hat may suggest Lisa (and this god's importance in Abla- Lete), since Lisa, Gu, and Age share the same temple complex in Abomey and nearly always appear together.

Discussions with John Hill, Executor, were very informative and always a pleasure. My research at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, was facilitated by several people. In particular Eloise Ricciardelli, Registrar, graciously permitted me access to exhibition archives. Sara McNear, Photography Department; Richard Tooke, Rights and Reproductions; Mikki Carpenter, Photograph Archives; Rona Roob; and Frances Keech were also most helpful. I am especially grate- ful to Dorothy Miller for discussing her experience working with Walker Evans. My thanks also go to James J. Ross for bringing the Modern Gallery brochure to my attention. At the Metropolitan Museum, Douglas Newton and Kate Ezra graciously offered many helpful suggestions. 1. The opening date of this exhibition has been published by Naumann as January 26, 1918 (1980:125). The date on the brochure, however, is January 21. 2. The Sheeler portfolio carries two titles. The outside cover (and the brochure announcing it) both read African Negro Wood Sculpture, while the actual title page reads African Negro Sculpture. 3. One fact about the Sheeler portfolio has yet to be resolved. On the title page it states that an edition of twenty-two was produced in 1918. Because all twenty-two portfolios have not yet been located, it has been suggested that only eight or so were actually produced (Stebbins &amp; Keyes 1988:5). However, the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, owns edition number ten, and because it is known that Sheeler considered the portfolio a financial success, it seems probable that the entire edition was produced. 4. An exhibition of thirty images from the portfolio, and the facts concerning its production, was presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, February 9-July 1, 1989. The photographs had not been exhibited since 1936. 5. The first exhibition of African art at a New York museum was held at the Brooklyn Museum in 1923; called "Primitive Negro Art," it was organized by Stewart Culin, who wrote the accompanying catalogue. 6. Some of the objects shown in "African Negro Art" were seen again in the Museum of Modern Art's "Primitivism" exhibition and catalogue. 7. Alfred H. Barr, letter to David H. Stevens, Director of Humanities, The Rockefeller Foundation, February 18, 1935, and a letter written by Thomas Mabry, Executive Director, the Museum of Modern Art, dated April 9,1935, including a detailed budget (exhibition files, Registrar's Office, The Museum of Modern Art, New York). 8. Alfred H. Barr, letter to John Marshall, The Rockefeller Foundation, April 10, 1935 (exhibition files, Registrar's Office, The Museum of Modern Art, New York). 9. Alfred H. Barr, letter to John Marshall, The Rockefeller Foundation, April 10, 1935 (exhibition files, Registrar's Office, The Museum of Modern Art, New York). 10. Photographs that Evans made for the portfolio were later used in two publications, thus I believe causing confusion. See Radin &amp; Sweeney 1952 and 1964. This book also contains photographs by Eliot Elisofon. 11. Interview with Dorothy Miller, January 24, 1989, New York. See also Thompson 1982:112. 12. He photographed an exhibition of paintings by Dorothy Eisner. The photographs and some of her work are now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Eisner's husband, John McDonald, worked as a writer with Evans at Fortune magazine. 13. Interview with Dorothy Miller, January 24,1989, New York. 14. For a complete discussion of Evans work in relationship to the 8" x 10" format, the lenses he used, and its effect on his later work, see Thompson 1982:10-11. 15. A similar approach was used by Evans in his portraits of farm workers in the American South. 16. When a selection of these photographs was displayed at the Metropolitan Museum in 1989, the public comments reflected this idea so strongly that a sign had to be installed stating that the photographs had not been cropped in any manner. Also see Thompson 1982:14. 17. This information was graciously supplied by John Hill. 18. Interview with Dorothy Miller, January 24, 1989, New York. 19. John Hill, pers. com. 20. In August 1989 two sample prints from the Metropolitan Museum's portfolio were sent for analysis to Grant Romer, Conservator, at Eastman House, Rochester, New York. Mr. Romer suggested these types of contact printing paper after comparing that used by Evans to sample books from the 1930s. My sincere thanks go to Mr. Romer for his time and expertise. 21. These people were listed as studio assistants in the final Financial Report for the project, sent to the General Education Board by Thomas Mabry, April 30, 1936 (exhibi- tion files, Registrar's Office, The Museum of Modern Art, New York). John Hill also confirmed this information. c o n t r i b u t o r s articles SUZANNE PRESTON BLIER, Associate Professor of Art History at Columbia University in New York, is currently a Senior Scholar at the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities in Santa Monica, California.

Her interest in contemporary bead- work developed out of research on informal money-making opportunities for black South African women. Her other publications in this area focus on the develop- ment of tourist art and the analysis of the use of "ethnic" motifs in tourist settings. CHRISTOPHER B.

Seven completed sets were given free of charge to the fol- lowing institutions: Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia; Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee; Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia; Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama; Howard University, Washington, D.C.; Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana; and the New York Public Library, 135th Street. The remaining sets were sold (for $50 each) to: New York University, New York; Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London; Musee d'Ethnographie, Palais du Trocadero, Paris [Musee de l'Homme]; University of Chicago Library, Chicago, Illinois; and Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire. Sweeney, Pleasants, and Goldwater also purchased sets. The list of receiving institutions was taken from the final financial report submitted to the General Education Board by Thomas Mabry, April 30, 1936 (exhibi- tion files, Registrar's Office, The Museum of Modern Art, New York). Most of the portfolios can now be completely or partially accounted for. Many have changed hands. For example Goldwater gave his set to the Museum of Primitive Art, which is now at the Metropolitan Museum. 23. Evans might have taken photographs of traditional European(?) stone figure sculptures. The Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art has several prints of sculpted male torsos in an unknown museum set- ting. They lack documentation, but were presented along with existing enlargements from the traveling exhibition of Evans photographs. I could not determine if these were taken by Evans. 103</page></plain_text>
