This posthumously published volume of essays comprises all of Paul de Man's writings on Romanticism except "The Rhetoric of Temporality." Of the ten essays, seven have previously appeared in various journals and collections be tween i960 and 1979. The three new pieces are a lengthy excerpt, "Image and Emblem in Yeats/' from de Man's Ph.D. dissertation, a discussion of Bau delaire's "Correspondances" under the title "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," and "Aesthetic Formalization: Kleist's ?ber das Marienetten theaterT Like all such collections, The Rhetoric of Romanticism inevitably poses the question as to its unity as a volume. De Man himself raises the issue in his brief preface when he expresses his regret that the "apparent coherence within each essay is not matched by a corresponding coherence between them" (p. viii; italics are his). While there may not, strictly speaking, be "coherence," there is certainly a cohesion that stems not so much from the subject matter itself as from the approach and the implicit vision. If the generously conceived notion of Romanticism acts primarily as an umbrella under which to bring together considerations of a variety of poets within a recognizable tradition, the more telling wholeness springs from de Man's distinctive perception of the problem. Eschewing general and historical matters, he concentrates his inquiries on theoretical points as contained in figurai language which is subject to his par ticular kind of deconstructive rhetorical analysis. His early and well-known essay, "Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image," therefore forms an ap propriate opening piece insofar as it can be seen in retrospect as an an nouncement of de Man's special interests and methodology. Its focus on "the fundamental ambiguity that characterizes the poetics of romanticism" as manifest in "an abundant imagery coinciding with an equally abundant quan tity of natural objects, the theme of imagination linked to the theme of nature" (p. 2) represents a pr?figuration of the central concerns of the entire volume. It is precisely the ambiguities, the difficulties, the obstacles that are the favored subjects of de Man's scrutiny. The dilemmas of reading form the point of departure for his attempts not so much to overcome the inherent problems as to identify and confront them with a ratiocination so exigent and a logic so meticulous as to uncover ever more ambivalences, dissonances, and discongruities. As a critic de Man seems driven himself to re-enact that Post Romantic predicament that was the topic of his dissertation. His comment on Mallarm? can, mutatis mutandis, be applied to him: "Mallarm? may well be the nineteenth century poet who went further than any other in sacrificing the stability of the object to the demands of a lucid poetic awareness" (p. 8). Sub stitute twentieth for nineteenth century, and "critic" and "critical" for "poet" and "poetical," and you have a cogent characterization of the thrust of de Man's endeavor. Within this overarching framework the essays in The Rhetoric of Romanticism are laid out diachronically in a roughly chronological sequence: Rousseau, H?lderlin, Wordsworth, Shelley, Yeats, Baudelaire, and Kleist. Quite apart from the strange displacement of Kleist, who was a contemporary of H?lder lin, this historicizing arrangement is not the most felicitous format, particu larly in view of de Man's own resistance to such schematizations. It would</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 91 surely have been preferable to disregard the outer in favor of the inner chro nology of the dates of composition of the respective pieces. This would more readily have revealed the line of de Man's development as a critic, and would also have spared the reader the kind of jolt we experience in moving from the three opening essays, which date from the early to mid-1960's, to the astrin gent fourth, "Autobiography as De-Facement," which appeared in 1979, and back again to the previous gentler mode. Granted that essays 3, 4, and 5 are all about Wordsworth, and granted too that de Man was not averse to ?pater le bourgeois, nonetheless an organic arrangement would have done greater jus tice to the evolution of his thought, and would have served as a better memo rial to his stature as a critic. Certain elements remain as constants throughout the twenty-five years spanned by this volume: the boldness of de Man's ideas; the clarity with which he conceived the problems he was addressing; the breadth of his horizon and of his range of reference; his acute awareness of the wider implications of the issues in each individual text, and the ease with which he moves from the macrocosm to the microcosm and vice versa; the suppleness and energy of his prose (which makes it all the more regrettable that he was none too well served by his translators, notably from the German). Yet there are palpable changes too in both manner and outlook. The probing mode of the earlier pieces yields to an increasingly assertive and authoritative style. Simultane ously the basis for the rhetorical analysis shifts from a phenomenological ex ploration of consciousness indebted to Gaston Bachelard to a deconstruction ist will to mastery of the text, in which reading is envisaged as "a battle of wits in which both parties are fighting over the reality or fictionality of their dis course, over the ability to decide whether the text is a fiction or an (autobiog raphy, narrative or history, playful or serious" (p. 282). This shift entails a progressive darkening of de Man's vision. While the spectres of "failure and sterility" and of "threatening paralysis" stalk through the earlier essays al ready, by the later ones their presence has become depressingly insistent. The most disturbing reading is that of Shelley's The Triumph of Life ("Shelley Dis figured," 1979 [pp. 93-123]) in which de Man claims that "figuration (as question) performs the erasure of the positing power of language" (p. 118), and concludes that "the process is endless, since the knowledge of the lan guage's performative power is itself a figure in its own right and, as such, bound to repeat the disfiguration of metaphor" so that ultimately "The Tri umph of Life can be said to reduce all of Shelley's previous work to nought" (p. 120). This is a deconstruction that is in grim and deadly earnest, in con trast to the playful virtuosity of a Barbara Johnson or a Shoshana Felman. What makes "Shelley Disfigured" even more horrible is the ironic parallel between de Man's invocation of Shelley's disfigured body ( "This defaced body is present in the margin of the last manuscript page and has become an in separable part of the poem" [p. 120]) and our own awareness as readers of this volume of the lingering presence of de Man's own ravaged body. Its quintessential negativity is the major objection that can be levelled against The Rhetoric of Romanticism. One may also feel uneasy about some of de Man's procedures, such as his habit of exploiting a single text analyzed in great detail to illustrate a general point enunciated at the beginning. The outcome of this method is to make poems appear curiously disembodied, as if they were merely a play of figures and an enactment of metaphysical quand</page><page sequence="3">92 Smith aries. But despite such reservations the reader is carried along by the force fulness of de Man's presentation. His readings are fresh, challenging, and highly suggestive; they urge us to go back to the texts and to re-read.
