<plain_text><page sequence="1">First Intermediate Period tombs at Beni Hassan: Problems and Priorities (including BH no. 420 and the unpublished box coffin fragment BH3Liv) Martin Bommas (Taf. 3-4) Abstract Through a new approach to address the history and social stratigraphy of the so-called lower necropolis of Beni Hassan, focus is laid on tombs of the First Intermediate Period that had almost escaped attention since their excavation at the beginning of the 20th Century. By presenting tomb BH no. 420 and its funerary equipment as a show case, this article aims at demonstrating new ways of identifying tombs that closely belong to each other at sites that were poorly excavated or looted. In an attempt to also address sources wrongly considered as incon- spicuous, an hitherto unpublished coffin fragment from BH no. 420 showing traces of an offering liturgy is published here for the first time. Reassessments of archaeological sites in ancient Egypt are undoubtedly as important as re- editions of texts. Major driving forces in both fields over the past 25 years have been the introduction of computer aided research and the steep knowledge gain due to detailed stud- ies in various related fields. Only a few research projects - among them predominantly archaeological ventures - continue over several decades with little to no interruption. Con- stant work at a site guarantees continuous assessment of earlier results whereas editions of singular texts are usually the tasks of individual scholars less committed to long term inves- tigations. Different from research of written sources, archaeological work has a destructive side, the control of which was of imperative importance already to some 19th C excavators. But since care and diligence was mainly exercised in relation to the objects found, the sale of which often helped to fund field work, less attention was called upon adequate documenta- tion of immobile finds such as superstructures of tombs or walls of houses. Understandably, it is mostly the lack of appropriate documentation that evokes the need for reassessment. It comes as no surprise that during the past 30 years nearly all major cemeteries of the Late Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom underwent re-investigations in the field with several specific research aims in mind: Apart from conservation, a better understanding of regions and their historical importance, sociological and chronological questions, study of ancient landscapes and the occupancy of cemeteries are key research questions which often cannot be answered sufficiently by consulting older excavation reports only. One site that has escaped controlled archaeological field work for the past 100 years is the Middle Kingdom necropolis of Beni Hassan, famous for its grand rock cut tomb chapels lined up at the Upper Terrace. Here, recent studies amplify the great demand for up-to-date documentation including a re-investigation of specific areas and finds which allow for ad- dressing the above mentioned research aims. The following article aims at presenting an overview of the history of research and addressing aims of future studies interested in the development of the Lower Necropolis of Beni Hassan. By addressing tomb BH no. 420 as a showcase, new methods will be discussed which can instigate future investigations of the site as a whole.</page><page sequence="2">44 M. Bommas SAK 41 1 The Old and Middle Kingdom cemeteries of Beni Hassan The Middle Kingdom necropolis of Beni Hassan is deservedly famous for its 39 rock cut tombs of high ranking officials of the 1 6th Upper Egyptian nome, buried within the upper cliff of the east bank of the Nile1. From a long row of tombs running along a north-southern axis they overlooked not only the countryside they governed during their lifetime but also the tombs of subordinate officials buried at 'their feet'. As against the upper rank, the lower terrace of Beni Hassan where a large quantity of shaft and chamber tombs has survived attracted comparatively little interest2. It is probably fair to say that the importance of the tombs within the lower terrace was overshadowed by their historically more relevant and famously decorated sister tombs at the upper terrace. At present, six archaeological groups of Old and Middle Kingdom cemeteries can be identified at Beni Hassan which were hewn out of two separate layers of rock - while the upper layer is 10 to 30 m thick, the lower lay- er is much thinner3: 1) The Upper Necropolis of Beni Hassan. The thirty-nine rock cut tombs belonging to high ranking officials of the Middle Kingdom, mostly referred to as nomarchs. These tombs are exclusively located at the upper cliff. The chronology of these chapels is still not agreed on and several models have been suggested4. The undoubtedly latest chapel is the one of Khnumhotep II (BH III) from the reigns of Amenemhat II and Senwosret II. In subsequent times, members of the ruling family where drawn to the capital5 as is shown by the mastaba of Khnumhotep III, probably one of the sons of Khnumhotep II, excavated at Saqqara in the 1 P.

The earliest history of the upper necropolis is still debated: its first occupancy is very likely to have taken place during the First Intermediate Period7 down to the middle of the 1 1th Dynasty8 when Beni Hassan be- came the necropolis for nomarchs of the 16th Upper Egyptian nome9. Only twelve10 of these tombs of the nobility are decorated and have repeatedly attracted scholarly attention11 due to their unique iconography, important historical inscriptions and vivid scenes of daily life displayed on their walls. However, the suggestion of Newberry12 and Garstang13 that all these tombs belonged to governors cannot be sustained: a large number of smaller tombs are mixed with those of superior officials though apart from BH XIII they lack inscrip- tions14. Its owner, Amenhotep, bore mostly religious titles15 which leads to suggest that apart from high ranking politicians the upper rank of Beni Hassan stood also open to those who had key functions in the temple administration but were less likely to have their tombs inscribed. The southern tombs of the Upper Terrace mark the northern limit of quarries of Beni Hassan, ending south of the estuary of the Speos Artemidos. 2) The necropolis of Nuweirat, north of the great necropolis of Beni Hassan (l)16, con- tains small rock-cut tombs with square-shaped cult chambers, one or two short shafts and short burial chambers for contracted burials. These tombs are typically arranged in two 6 D. Arnold, Middle Kingdom Mastabas at Dahshur, in: EA 21, 2002, 38-40; D. Arnold/A.

Spanel, Beni Hasan in the Herakleopolitan Period, Toronto, 1984, 145-148 the se- quence of tombs during the First Intermediate Period can be reconstructed as follows: Dyn. 9 (BH XXIX, XXXIII and XXVII), Dyn. 10 (BH XV and XVII), representing a view which, however, has not found much support. Also problematic is the gap between First Intermediate Period tombs and those that can be dated to the 12th Dynasty containing kings' names. 8 L.

The sloping hill in front of it contains pot-burials with circular superstructures of lime stone boulders. Garstang took this cemetery for the prototype of the great tombs of Beni Hassan and dated the site to the 3rd-4th Dyn.17, others suggested a date into late Old King- dom18. No excavation report is available and the funerary equipment of these tombs is un- known. 3) A series of tombs to the south at the entrance of the wadi which leads to the Speos Artemidos19, close to modern Beni Hassan. According to the finds, especially box coffins with yellow eye symbols, ka-statuettes and fragments of models, a date into the First Inter- mediate Period onwards is most likely while Garstang thought of these tombs as belonging to the 5th Dyn.20. 4) At the Lower Necropolis of Beni Hassan21, several groups of tombs dating to the Old Kingdom22 and the First Intermediate Period. At present, the exact location of these tombs and how intensively the site was used as a burial place are impossible to assess23. 5) Also at the lower terrace of Beni Hassan, a group of Middle Kingdom burials. Some of the tombs of the 1 1 th and 1 2th Dynasties reused earlier structures. Several attempts have been made to achieve clarity about the development of the Middle Kingdom burial sites within the lower terrace but conclusions seem to be contradictory, see below. 6) Traces of at least one unfinished tomb-shaft above the upper cliff24. No conclusive suggestion of how these cemeteries are linked with each other can currently be established, however, cemeteries 1 and 4-5 define the latest development in this area25. Nevertheless, the direct link between dead individuals buried in the upper terrace (1) and those buried below (4-5), which has often been suggested, cannot be proven on a large scale. Therefore, chronology and social distribution remain key issues for future work at the site of Beni Hassan, however difficult these aspects are to assess. One reason is the fact that functions of persons carried out during their lifetime defy representation in mortuary rituals. While it is sometimes possible to vaguely determine a dead individual's social level, his individual sphere or connection with other members of his community is very often impos- sible to isolate. 2 History of Research of the lower terrace between 1890 and 1907 During two winter seasons between 1 890 and 1 892, Percy E. Newberry cleared and record- ed the upper rank of tombs of Beni Hassan for the Archaeological Survey of Egypt26 but showed little to no interest in the lower range of tombs. He referred to them as 'mummy- 17 Garstang, Burial Customs, 27. See also M.

Although he dismissed the majority of these tombs as plundered, in the second volume Beni Hasan II George W. Fraser reports on his own exca- vation of one shaft tomb at the southern end of the lower rank28 which he found undis- turbed. Although Fraser does not state his reason why he chose this - nowadays unidentifi- able - tomb, it seems obvious that he wanted to compare the shafts of the upper cliff with a shaft tomb from a lower rank29. He described the tomb as intact, belonging to the 12th Dyn. and its owner as being a member of the middle class but gave no evidence for his interpre- tations. Probably having been encouraged by Newberry's work and most likely after consultation with Newberry himself30, John Garstang started his excavation of the lower terrace which he described as the "Great Necropolis of the Middle Kingdom"31 only one decade after Newberry had left the site, from 1902 to 1904. During a period of nine months only, he unearthed a massive necropolis on the sloping terrace of Beni Hassan, just a few metres below the upper terrace. In short sequences Garstang excavated 888 shaft tombs32 at an average of three tombs per day. Only 20 tombs were found intact and only a cross section of the tombs found is discussed in his main report33. Unfortunately, Garstang not only failed to describe or discuss the architecture or craftsmanship of individual tombs, but also did not publish tomb inventories. His lists of finds are incomplete and the descriptions of artefacts suffer largely from a lack of detail. If the numbering of tombs reflects the chronology of Garstang's work, he arguably started in the very south of the necropolis, probably not too far away from where Fraser has carried out his test-dig. If this assumption is correct, he would have turned to other loca- tions already during his first days at the site and soon after he had started work on tombs 1 - 534. Starting with tomb 6 further to the north, his team zigzagged its way through the lower necropolis going back and forth without any identifiable pattern. Obviously, ground inspec- tion and excavations were concurrent operations. Already in the first season from Decem- ber 1902 until May 1903, Garstang and his team covered already the complete extent of the site. The sheer haste might have been responsible for some inconsistencies35. Patchy photo- graphic documentation36 rather than drawings or measurements37 is all that is left of 27 Newberry, Beni Hasan I, 3. His excavation plan of the site consequently shows only 181 structures that give the impression of shaft tombs of various sizes. 28 G. W.

The documentation includes descriptions of and distribution lists of finds, some field notes, photographs and other correspondence including with the</page><page sequence="6">48 M. Bommas SAK 41 Garstang's field notes. At a time when photographic documentation was in its fledgling stage, Garstang left a remarkable proof of the use of the new technology38. Needless to say, however, this documentation does not meet the requirements of modern archaeology39. To sum up, his lengthy narrative of his work at the site, published in 190740 is little recompense for the shortcomings of his partial documentation. Designed as a textbook about Middle Kingdom burials in general, his central publication reveals little to nothing about social status or chronological development of the site. Not only are there exact locations of tombs missing, the apparent inconsistencies explain sufficient enough that the tombs of the lower necropolis are currently lost. Their inventories, crucial for the evaluation of chronological development as it is, cannot be allocated within the tombs which makes it hard to rate the levels of usurpation. As things stand, the majority of finds are either lost or de- contextualised. Due to the fact that Garstang produced no field notes, drawings or meas- urements of the site and did not present dating criteria or inscriptions, the lower terrace of Beni Hassan must be regarded as in large parts undocumented. Garstang's very liberal find distribution policy41 only added to these severe shortcomings which constrain the search for artefacts from Beni Hassan42. 3 Studies on the lower terrace of Beni Hassan over the past 20 years Whether Garstang's report is consistent enough to reconstruct the history of occupancy of the necropolis of Beni Hassan, is debatable. Garstang himself suggested that the "history of Beni Hassan seems to have moved on continuously and swiftly from the time of Pepy, late in the 6th Dynasty, until the establishments of the 11th Dynasty" without any "break in the archaeological sequence" 43. Recent observations, however, rightly challenged Garstang's simplistic view44. Excavation Committee and accounts. A note book, Excavation a Beni Hasan, contains a few excavation notes but is mainly devoted to notes about the native labourers. There is also a Visitors to Beni Hasan (1 902-03 )-book and a similar visitors book for the end (http://209.85. 1 29. 132/search?q=cache:qvQmY85HaSYJ: www.liv.ac. uk/sace/garstang-museum/museumarchives/egypt-nubia.htm+garstang+beni+ archive&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=de&amp;ct= clnk&amp;gl=uk). 37 The only excavation notes that have survived and remain in the archives of the School of Archaeology and Oriental Studies at the University of Liverpool are nine pages, reporting of seven tombs only (excluding BH 420), s. Orel, Chronology, 16. 38 Garstang produced a total of 1100 photographs of which 731 glass negatives are preserved in the ar- chives of the School of Archaeology and Oriental Studies at the University of Liverpool. 39 On the use of early photography in Egyptology and its aims see S. Quirke, Petrie at Aby dos in 1900: Margaret Murray's album, in: EA 36, 2010, 7. Photography was introduced to archaeology at a relatively late stage; as a medium for documentation it was introduced to warfare as early as 1854-56 during the Crimean War, s. P.

Because Garstang was overwhelmed by the quantity of objects unearthed and after having satisfied his financial supporters, he published a letter in The Times from 18 February 1904 in which he offered sets of Egyptian pottery to museums in the United Kingdom and the Colonies. His letter which was reprinted in newspapers across the United Kingdom and the Common- wealth attracted applications from all over the world. For a slightly incomplete list of collections that own ob- jects from Beni Hassan s.

Seidlmayer, Gräberfelder, 217.</page><page sequence="7">2012 First Intermediate Period tombs at Beni Hassan 49 In 1988, Willems who based himself on his studies of wooden box coffins has argued that the necropolis of Beni Hassan developed from south to north45, thus supporting Garstang's view that the geographical placement of burials in the lower terrace was related to the final resting places of the nomarchs buried at the upper terrace46. Although found in high numbers, studies on the coffins of Beni Hassan have been hampered largely by the fact that little to no documentation exists and as a result no site related dating criteria can be established47. Nevertheless, Willems indicated that the northern part of the necropolis de- veloped only in the reigns of Senwosret I, Amenemhat II, and Senwosret II. This develop- ment, however, did not come into full swing until Beni Hassan was already starting to be abandoned as a burial site: only 36 tombs (which constitute 4% of the tombs found by Garstang) are north of BH no. 1 87 (below BH VII) and only three of these tombs contained pottery. While *BH 32448 contained one vessel (Garstang, type 6) dating to the later First Intermediate Period down to the beginning of the 12th Dyn.49, BH no. 140 contained pottery from the 1 1th Dyn. down to the early Second Intermediate Period50, thus representing more than one usurpation. Early tombs were above all often reused51 and even new shafts were added52. Prominent tombs such as BH no. 81 which probably possessed the largest super- structure at site and functioned as a landmark were especially prone to reuse. Having been built during the late Old Kingdom, this tomb showed pottery from the complete timespan of the use of the necropolis53 and four fragments of coffins from the early to mid- 1 2th Dyn.54, thus making it difficult to assess the tomb's position within the chronology of the necropo- lis. This is by no means an isolated case: many of the later box coffins from Beni Hassan are found in the southern part of the site, below the upper terrace burials and south of BH XIV55. As a matter of fact, massive usurpation of tombs together with incomplete excava- tion records are key problems that distort an understanding of the site. Also, the evidence Willems had to base his assessment of the site on is to a large extent hampered by the insuf- ficiency of the documentation provided by Garstang. Instead of an inventory of all finds found within the tombs excavated, Garstang published a list of selected finds56 which ex- cluded fragments of objects, the majority of which is still inaccessible today. 45 Willems, Chests, 64 Garstang, Burial Customs, 17.

Bommas SAK 41 In addition to that, chronologically sensitive and characteristic finds such as pottery were again reduced to 77 sketches of standardised shapes57 and apart from a generalising terminology ("dish, "bowl" etc.), his inventory contains little detailed information. Alt- hough it is obvious that the only group of objects that was found in quantities large enough to allow for a detailed analysis of the inner structure and chronology of the main necropolis of Beni Hassan is pottery58, even this comparatively well described group of objects does not lead to explicit results, it seems. Garstang himself59, but later also Do. Arnold60 and Kemp/Merrilles61 have observed a mixture of forms of the First Intermediate Period, 11th Dyn. and Middle Kingdom, thus coming to the conclusion that Beni Hassan represents a place where two different styles of pottery were mixed in a period of transition. Seidlmayer, undeterred by Garstang's poor presentation of ceramics rightly stated that "the site is too important to content oneself too quickly with a negative result"62. Although he admits it is impossible to differentiate between earlier and later groups of forms, he nev- ertheless uses three independent approaches to establish the chronology of the site as a "valid result"63. According to his studies, morphological forms of the First Intermediate Period and 1 1th Dyn. seem to be restricted to the southern half of the necropolis, including parts of the centre while the other half, displaying quantitatively more restricted groups, stretches to the northern part and defines the "formation of classical Middle Kingdom"64 down to the reigns of Amenemhet II and Senwosret II. This supports Willems' view based on his research on box coffins. Whether Seidlmayer's suggestion is acceptable, however, depends on one hand on how willing one is positively to assess Garstang's excavation methods. Main shortcomings in Garstang's documentation which hamper the feasibility of Seidlmayer's threefold approach are, first, the limited amount of different morphological shapes which only allow for restricted differentiation; secondly, pottery is mentioned for only 259 tombs out of 888, or in other words, only every 3.4th tomb contained ceramics documented by Garstang; third, 15 tombs on Garstang's map of the necropolis are men- tioned at least twice65 which limits the appliance of any dating criteria. While Seidlmayer's approach allows for a (partly) reconstruction of the occupancy of the necropolis, this result is nevertheless limited due to the fact that funerary goods do not determine the date at 57 Garstang, Burial Customs, PI. XII-XVI. The fact that in his publication Garstang renamed morphological groups of ceramics adds further to this problem: excavation charts that are kept at the University of Liverpool show a different numbering system which hampers comparison. Garstang distinguished 77 types (Burial Customs, PL XII-XVI, incl. pottery dating to the 18th Dyn.), for occurrences of types see B.J. Kemp and R.S.

With regard to the frequent re-use of early tombs as outlined above, de-contextualised ceramics are hardly any dating criterion if used exclusively66. When Sara E. Orel studied the history of occupancy of the lower necropolis of Beni Hassan in her PhD thesis, she made little or no use of Seidlmayer's research. Through de- tailed recovery and analysis of both pottery and coffins67 re-ascribed to their probable orig- inal locations, she attempted to link the occupancy of the lower terrace with the tombs at the upper cliff, although the lower terrace both pre- and postdate the upper rank68. First, what was de-contextualised by Garstang's excavation report is meticulously drawn together in a way that in a number of instances allows for viewing the original tomb contents regard- less of their whereabouts in public and private collections69 . Secondly, Orel suggested pot- tery based dates for the contents of each tomb70, including an overall pottery-based chro- nology71 and allowing for identification of continuously used tombs72. A chronology of inscriptions (the dating criteria of which are not clearly set out) shows a clear attempt into the right direction but the work is uneven in its coverage (see below) and will need verifica- tion. Orel paid special attention to the identification of a "minimum level of rank differenti- ation operating in a given society" and resumes that "any further claim for the measure cannot be accepted"73 which is deeply unsatisfying given all the data that she collected. Sadly, Orel fails to describe the history of occupancy of Beni Hassan in relation to the ge- ography of the site74, an issue which would have been imperative to consider in view of the preceding studies of Willems and Seidlmayer who both had less data to hand when inter- preting the evidence. 4 The First Intermediate Period at Beni Hassan The least known or even rationalised period attested at the lower terrace of Beni Hassan is certainly the First Intermediate Period, controversially discussed between 1988 and 1993 with no conclusion achieved so far. Out of 888 tombs excavated by Garstang, 256 tombs contained pottery that was produced during the First Intermediate Period75. Twenty-three tombs contained nothing but First Intermediate Period Pottery76. This is reason enough to suggest that the lower terrace was occupied before the unification by Mentuhotep Nebhetepre took place. 66 It goes without saying that especially the assessment of potential re-usage of a tomb is dependent on cof- fins and the number of artefacts that usually appear singularly, such as models of granaries, beer and bread making models etc. 67 Orel, Chronology, 38-42 painstakingly recovered 400 out of originally 4000 vessels in British and North American museums and collections plus 35 coffins (Orel, Chronology, 299). 68 Orel, Chronology, 439. 69 Orel, Chronology, 524-578. 70 Orel, Chronology, 590-598.

Orel attributed coffin BH1 1 from tomb BH 1 to a date as early as the 8th Dynasty and the early 1 1th Dyn.78 which means that Willem's type I coffins most probably predate the Middle Kingdom. Seidlmayer rejects Garstang's view that Beni Hassan showed "no gap between the date of these tombs [ie Old Kingdom burials] and the earlier portion of the main necropolis"79. He firmly asserts the existence of the break in the archaeological sequence on the basis of lacking evidence80 earlier than the second half of the 1 1th Dynasty81, thus excluding tombs dating to the First Intermediate Period such as BH no. 51982. By dismissing the First Inter- mediate Period as non-existent within the archaeological material, he suggests an 'abrupt occurrence' of tombs at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom alongside the beginning of the ceramic sequence which he links with the establishment of regional administrative units during the early Middle Kingdom under Mentuhotep Nebhetepre83. So far, only Orel, on the basis of a combined study of pottery and coffins suggested the existence of First Intermedi- ate burials84. Although Willems is right in arguing that tombs with early 11th Dynasty in- scriptions are located south of BH XI, later coffins from Beni Hassan come from the south- ern half of the site, too. But first, early 1 1th Dynasty pottery was found north of this point, beyond tomb BH VIII, and secondly, these southern tombs were being reused85 thus mak- ing a south-north development of the lower necropolis of Beni Hassan as suggested by Wil- lems and Seidlmayer unlikely. 5 Unsolved problems in recent studies on the lower terrace of Beni Hassan The oldest tombs at the lower terrace are BH nos. 481 and 482. Both date to the Old King- dom while the latest tombs date to the 18th Dyn., such as BH no. 68486. Of major im- portance is the question whether there is no break of the archaeological sequence leading to a permanent occupancy of the necropolis from the OK down to the New Kingdom as sug- gested by Garstang, or whether such a break can indeed be identified as suggested by Seid- lmayer87. According to his research, the main phase of the necropolis started as a conse- quence of establishing an administrative centre in the region during the reign of Men- 77 Willems, Chests, 65. His group A dates to the end of the 1 1th Dynasty and the reign of Amenemhat I, see also H. Willems, The Nomarchs of the Hare Nome and Early Middle Kingdom History, in: JEOL 28, 1983-84, 91-93. Lapp, Typologie, 56 identified coffin BH1 (lpi, tomb BH 707; J. Garstang, Excavations 1902-1903- 1904, 223; Willems, Chests, 5, 271) as an early box coffin as it shows none of the features of the coffins dating to the 1 1th Dynasty and later. This view is rejected by Orel, Chronology, 333. She takes type II as a parallel development from type I coffins, see Orel, Chronology, 334. 78 Orel, Chronology, 314. 79 Garstang, Burial Customs, 44.

Especially the earliest tombs appear to have been reused in later times. Gräberfelder, 217.</page><page sequence="11">2012 First Intermediate Period tombs at Beni Hassan 53 tuhotep II88. However, given Orel's overall assessment of the pottery, a different picture emerges: First, Beni Hassan was indeed occupied as a necropolis prior to the Middle King- dom89, although smaller in size. Secondly no break of sequence can be established. This conclusion goes hand in hand with the less prominent role the 16th Upper Egyptian nome obviously played during the First Intermediate Period90 and before the re-unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. In order to fully analyse the phase of transition from the later 1 1th Dyn. down to the reign of Amenemhat II/Senwosret II, focus has to be laid on the pre- Middle Kingdom occupation of the site: the location of tombs, the quality of funerary equipment and the establishment of archaeological sequences of homogeneously composed tomb inventories. 6 Social stratigraphy at Beni Hassan during the First Intermediate Period Although the majority of tombs of the Lower Terrace at Beni Hassan date to the First In- termediate Period through to the reign of Senwosret III and precise dating is impossible to achieve at the moment due to the problems outlined above, scholars have suggested two different directions of development: according to Willems, the lower necropolis developed from south to north91 while Seidlmayer suggests that the necropolis expanded and contract- ed at the same time to the north and south92. However, as long as the problems caused by the re-use of some of the earlier tombs and incomplete documentation are not solved it will be unwise, if not almost impossible to suggest one line of development only. Late coffins found in the southern part of the necropolis point to the fact that especially during the Mid- dle Kingdom the availability of a reusable tomb had priority over the wish to be ideally buried to the "feet of one's lord" as an official, interred below the tomb of the governor Akha-nakht at Deir-el Berscheh put it. In fact, only the tomb owners of BH no. 500 and BH no. 75 can be linked with normarchs buried within the upper cliff. BH no. 360 whose owner is generally thought to have been the son of Khnumhotep II buried in the upper rank (BH III) is located in the area of the slope between tombs BH XXII and XXIII. On closer in- 88 In a later article Seidlmayer repeated this view (Seidlmayer, People, 352) but seemed to speak of the up- per range of tombs only. Although his suggestion to link the building of the tombs (of the upper range) with an initiative by Mentuhotep II supposedly in order to strengthen the region cannot be verified, it seems neverthe- less likely. Even though R. Bussmann in his work Die Provinztempel Ägyptens von der 0. bis zur 1 1 . Dynastie, PdÄ 30, Leiden/Boston 2010 does not mention any temple between Badari and Herakleopolis Magna (ie from the 10th to the 20th Upper Egyptian nome) due to the lack of archaeological data from Dynasties 0 to 11, this does not mean that this area was not a thriving religious and economical region. In fact, numerous temples are attested in this region, main deities having been Hathor, Horus, Chnum, see Gomaà, Ägypten, 114, F. Gomaà, Die Besiedlung Ägyptens während des Mittleren Reiches I: Oberägypten und das Fayyüm, Beih. zum Tübinger Atlas d. Vorderen Orients B.66/1, Wiesbaden 1986, 307-329. 89 Chronology, 215. Like at the cemeteries of Sedment and el-Harageh, the most common types belong to the First Intermediate Period to early Middle Kingdom. It has to be noted, though, that the morphology of ves- sels did not change dramatically by the beginning of the Middle Kingdom and new forms emerged only slowly. 90 Alongside the Upper Egyptian nomes 13-15, the 16th nome, too, appears as a loyal tributary of the Hera- kleopolitan king Kheti III, s.

Bommas SAK 41 spection, however, this assignment is not free from uncertainty93, thus reducing the number of tombs which can be linked to governors to only two examples. Any attempt to draw con- crete conclusions from these two obviously isolated cases with the aim of establishing rela- tions between social ranks or even dependencies is thus hampered if not completely un- founded. Geographical reasons such as the quality of the rock or the concentration of tombs in the middle or southern parts of the necropolis certainly played an important role and probably added to the preparedness to re-use existing tombs rather than building new ones in areas not entirely suitable. Where, however, in intensively populated areas tombs were contracted, patterns were likely to emerge that can be isolated and addressed. In cemeteries like the one discussed here with similar deplorable excavation records, it can be beneficial not to look at the cemetery as a whole but first isolate secure ground from which hard facts can be obtained. In a second step, a broader understanding can be gained by looking into increasingly larger units. This approach has the advantage of assessing the complete inventory of a burial rather than groups of objects such as coffins or pottery which - if addressed in isolation - can bias and distort the occupation history of tombs if not of complete sites. In order to do so, undisturbed tombs displaying significant funerary equipment are ob- viously first choice to establish a formal point from which the surrounding archaeological evidence can be accessed, compared and separated from contexts outside these nuclei. This approach can lead to a reconstruction of communities and their micro cemeteries within larger units and - under ideal circumstances - to patterns of social stratification within First Intermediate Period burials grounds. Rather than looking for (multi-)axial developments of cemeteries as has been done in the past, this method favours the identification of clusters of burials on the basis of which communities and their funerary cult can be identified. This approach takes into account the differences of First Intermediate Period burials to pyramid cemeteries but also to burial customs of the New Kingdom which - as can be seen from the cemeteries of the Theban necropolis - prefer individual burials over clusters. In the follow- ing, an alternative approach will be favoured which challenges the linear development of tomb building suggested for the site of Beni Hassan in the past. 7 Tomb BH no. 420, a case study Tomb BH no. 420, of which no detailed excavation report is available94, lies at the base of the limestone cliff95, half way between the desert edge and the upper terrace of Beni Hassan where the nobility of the 16th Upper Egyptian was buried during the Middle Kingdom and earlier96. Of the 888 shaft tombs excavated by Garstang, BH no. 420 is supposedly one of 93 Garstang, Burial Customs, 187-188; Newberry, Beni Hasan I, 43, 44; Newberry, Beni Hasan II, 12, 14; Kemp and Merrilles, Minoan Pottery, 128; Orel, Chronology, 442. Seidlmayer, Gräberfelder, 232 refuses to accept the link between Nhr.y-ir.y n Tî.t and Khnumhotep II because of the unclear archaeological context.

It never seems to have been reused according to its content97 which reveals a complete picture of a burial of the time. In his list of finds, Garstang mentioned eleven objects belonging to this tomb98. To judge from this list, the tomb was found intact and held no intrusive finds belonging to later periods. According to Garstang's notes, the following eleven objects were found in BH no. 420, some of them revealing useful infor- mation about the owner and date of this tomb: Entry 1 ("string doll with long hair and bead pendants") is said to have been made part of the collection of Frederick George Hilton Price (1842-1909). Garstang published a pho- tograph and a description99 that show an elaborated doll made of organic material. Beads and strings were attached to the doll's long hair, symbolising jewellery while her head is of semi-circle shape lacking any facial features. Her hair is long enough to reach the ground allowing it to be dressed by a child. To judge by Garstang's photograph the doll showed only limited wear and tear. The whereabouts of this item are unknown today. Entry 2 ("string doll with bead clustered hair"), published together with item 1 (see above), became part of the MacGregor Collection, Tamworth (Taf. 3). Being only 6 cm tall, this figure is nevertheless fashioned in the highest quality with great attention to detail. Her body is formed from flax while her curls are made of faience beads attached to her hairdo. The size of the figure and the quality of work obviously carried out by tiny fingers suggests that the maker of this delightful figure might have been a child. Garstang suggested that this artefact might have been part of a child's burial100, and indeed, the doll found within the same tomb seems to support his suggestion at first glance101. However, on closer examina- tion of the other finds of this tomb no other artefact seems to point into this direction102. After the MacGregor Collection was assigned, Percy E. Newberry bought this item and donated it to Eton College (ECM 1843). Since then it has been frequently published103. Entry 3 ("wooden headrest"), current location unknown. Entry 4 ("Part of a brewery scene") 97 At the neighbouring necropolis of Deir el-Bersheh, burials of the First Intermediate Period were interred in older tombs as suggested in the restoration text of Djehuti-nakht, son of Teti (for a construction that makes use of all five known copies s.

The model displays several operations from the preparation of grain in a mill to the mashing in mash tubs104 and the recording of work process. Four of these figures are brewing; one of the male workers is shown pressing dough through a sieve which is the initial step of the production of beer105. A scribe is shown seated with his scribal palette on his knees while making notes with a pen in his right hand. To his left a woman is standing, possibly making report of the brewing process' outcome. While the hard labour such as the blending of the grain is clearly carried out by women, the actual production of beer seems to have been in the hands of men.

Entry 7 ("remains of boat"), location unknown. These items are lost, no documentation exists. Entry 8 ("pottery stopper, Ch. 440"), lost. Entry 9 ("fragments of coffin with text"). This entry refers to one surviving fragment of a box coffin, BH3Liv (Liverpool Muse- ums LM 55.82.88;) which is the only object from tomb 420 that carries inscriptions106 (Taf. 4.2). It shows traces of stucco at the edges and peg holes. On one side are seven vertical columns of hieroglyphs written in black ink. The other side has a much smoother surface on which most probably a frieze d'objets can be observed107. The object that shows traces of blue pigment within black outlines cannot be identified with certainty. Most probably this side is the coffin's inside. Of particular interest is the outside which contains an inscription in roughly written hi- eroglyphs which can be described as an early form of Totenbuchkursive. According to the inscription's chronologically most sensitive sign, the book roll108, BH3Liv was likely to be produced before the 12th Dyn.109. Only a small number of hieroglyphic signs are preserved 104 For processes involved see W. Helck, Das Bier im Alten Ägypten, Berlin 1971, 26-37; D.

Orel, Chronology, 3 1 3 has tentatively attached this coffin fragment to the type I group but "not discussed (...) because all that is preserved is a fragment of the eye on the exterior and fragmentary interior text". 107 Lapp, Typologie, 70 argues that all box coffins of Beni Hassan belong to a type which is characterised by object friezes. A.H. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar, Oxford 1983, Signlist Yl. 109 Schenkel, Studien, 27-28. According to Schenkel, Studien, 81 the writing of the book roll sign is a rele- vant dating criterion at Beni Hassan. However, in recent years his approach was rightly criticised for being dependant on conventionalised forms of signs (Brovarksi, Hare and Oryx Nomes, 53 referring to Spanel, Beni Hassan). Since writings of the book roll with two ties were found attested in the Late Old Kingdom already (Tomb Al ofNy-ankh-Pepy-Kem at Meir), this dating criterion has lost much of its significance.</page><page sequence="15">2012 First Intermediate Period tombs at Beni Hassan 57 running from the left to the right. What becomes evident from the design of the text is a clear division between columns 4 and 5, thus suggesting that col. 5 contains the beginning of another spell. On closer examination it becomes obvious that BH3Liv preserved parts of two Pyramid Texts, namely PT 32 and PT 25. Both form a classical combination of spells broaching the issues of libation and the burning of incense. The palaeography points to the later First Intermediate Period in the broadest sense while the inscription most probably makes part of the process of revision during the 1 1th Dyn. This date is confirmed by entry 10. PT spell 32 No more than seven hieroglyphs are preserved of what once made part of the clas- sical libation spell PT 32. In the version of BH3Liv, this spell reads as follows: Pyr. §22a x+5qbh=k [pn wsjr ] [qbh=k' x+6pnh[iNN] [pr.w h' x+7r sì[=k] [pr.w hr Hr.w §22b jw.n&lt;=j&gt; jn.n&lt;-j&gt; n=k jr. t Hr.w qb jb-k hr-s jn.n&lt;=j&gt; n-k s hr-k tbw.t.y=k §23a m-n-k rdw pr.w jm-k n wrd jb-k hr=s ] This your cool water, Osiris this your cool water, oh NN110, has come forth from your son, has come forth from Horus.

PT spell 25 While the text on the right side of the panel is the beginning of PT 32, on the left side the end of PT 25 can be identified, a classical spell that was recited during the offering ritual: § 1 7a [s s hrf kì-f s Hr.w hrf kì-f s Stš hrf kì-f § 1 7b s Dhwtj hrf kì-f s ntrlDwn-cn.wj hrf kì-f s ws] x+ljr]U h'rf kì=f 1 7c s Hn.t.y-jr.t.y hrf kì=f s.tj dd=k hrf ki-k § 1 8a hi NN r.w.y ki=k] x+2m bih=k He who comes comes with his ka; Horus comes with his ka, Seth comes with his ka, Thot comes with his ka, a god/Dewenanwj comes with his ka, Osiris comes with his ka.

BH3LÍV x+1 x+5 T if í Ä IL T i š i '&lt;¡&gt;' &lt;=» ra ^ lf! pj u ^ ^ The twin spell PT 32+25 Pyramid Text spell 32 is a long lived spell which was incorporated into the Middle King- dom mortuary liturgy Ij-Thb-wr , "The great Teheb comes"112. Its modernised version, CT 64, is attested all over Egypt: sources come from Saqqara (Sq3C, Nfr-...n.t ), Deir-el- Bersheh (B10C, the hi.t.y-c Amenemhat) and Thebes (T2C, the treasurer of the king of Lower Egypt, Dag; TIC, the šms.w, Hr-htp). However, the preserved passage is too frag- mentary to decide whether the libation spell preserved on BH3Liv is based on PT 32 or in fact on CT 64. The libation is equated with the efflux of Osiris which is returned to the dead individual by a priest who plays the role of Horus113. The Sitz im Leben of PT 32 obviously is the embalming chamber where not only the deceased is mummified but also his enemies are fought back. The verse "I brought it to you under you, your sandals" refers to these enemies subdued underneath the feet of the deceased. 112 J. Assmann, Totenliturgien in den Sargtexten des Mittleren Reiches.

The junction of both spells is well attested especially in Beni Hassan on coffins BH1C, BH3C and BH10xa: all agree that PT 25 followed PT 32114 but not vice versa. The new arrangement of PT 32+25 is - apart from BH3Liv - for the first time attested in the early 18th Dynasty. In the tomb of Rekhmire (TT 100) as well as in the still unpublished Papyrus BM EA 10819, this spell makes its earliest appearance within the offering ritual"5 as a double spell, the first part of which deals with libation, followed by the burning of incense. The evidence presented on BH3Liv points to the fact that this com- bination of spells is in fact at least 500 years older1 16 and was already well established when it made its appearance during the New Kingdom. Also the arrangement of this twin spell from left to right needs to be addressed briefly. PT 25 preceding PT 32 as the inscription shows is hardly in line with the performative re- quirements of the whole spell if the alignment according to the version in the tomb of Rekhmire is to be accepted. This apparent discrepancy can be explained if the inscriptions of BH3Liv were accepted to be a copy of a liturgical papyrus that was performed in favour of the deceased. In this case, the hieroglyphs still urged a reading from left to right but the papyrus as a whole had to be read from right to left. When reading from the original papy- rus roll, the lector priest simultaneously had to reel and roll up the two ends of the papyrus to allow for an overview of each spell under recitation. This view is supported first by the clearly visible division of the two elements of the spell before col. x+5 which in any case facilitated orientation. Secondly, other performative handbooks like pRamesseum E follow exactly the same mode"7. Both manuscripts, pRam E as well as the master copy for BH3Liv, are clearly texts that were performed by priests during a funerary procession and the offering ritual respectively. While pRam E contains a screen play that enabled its reader to conduct a funeral in its correct scenic progression, the text that found its way on BH3Liv was destined to be recited in the presence of the deceased individual. The twin spell NR 1.2 contains a speech act performed by an individual who acts in the divine role of Horus for the benefit of the dead person. As the versions of the New Kingdom show, the Sitz im Leb- en of this twin spell was the Offering Ritual. It seems most probable that this offering ritual was performed during the interment when the deceased was equipped with funerary goods which - as far as tomb no. 420 is concerned - are represented by the artefacts that John 114 J.

This glorification spell has recently been discussed as NR 1.2, in Assmann, Altägyptische Totenlitur- gien 2, 87-96.

Beni Hassan might not have played an exclusive role here, as the coffin of Dag (T2C, CG 28024, late 1 1th Dyn.) shows which has a variant of PT 25, see Pries, Stundenwachen, 68. 117 When A.H. Gardiner first edited the Ramesseum papyri, he was confused by the seemingly incompre- hensible arrangements of text columns, see A.H. Gardiner, A unique funerary liturgy, in: JEA 41, 1955, 9-17. The ms. became coherent only when W. Helck identified certain sections as separate performative entities and suggested a completely different alignment due to headings and other section markers (W.

At the entrance of a shaft tomb a priest is shown pouring a libation and burning incense. Since he is surrounded by mourning women, this scene refers to the closing rite at the tomb shaft. At the bottom of the tomb, the de- ceased person is shown lying on a bier. At the deceased's right side a lector-priest is shown, wearing an Anubis-mask and holding a papyrus roll in his hand. Although oManchester 5883 is of later date due to the anthropomorphic coffin depicted, the situation shown must have differed only little from the burial rites within tomb BH no. 420 at Beni Hassan. Although the palaeography points to the First Intermediate Period, the classical combi- nation of the libation spell PT 32 and the spell accompanying the burning of incense PT 25 might have developed already during the Old Kingdom. In this arrangement, the twin spell PT 32+25 has survived at least until Ptolemaic Times119. Entry 10 ("pottery, types 13, two"), the record of one of these is kept at Liverpool (SAOS E43 1 4). However, the excavation chart only gives one drawing and no other pottery or fragments thereof are mentioned. Given Garstang's method of documentation this does not mean that more objects did not exist. These might only have escaped documentation. The 'type 13' pot that was drawn is referred to as a "plummet shaped vase, flaring neck. Pot class B.l" on the record chart120, "B" referring to Garstang's class B ("tapering base")121. It dates to "Dyn. XI to unification"122. No other pottery that would allow to challenge this date was recorded and as far other identifyable objects are concerned, all support this view. Entry 1 1 ("a dish"), location unknown. This item is lost, no documentation exists. 9 Interpretation According to the records available, Garstang must have found tomb BH no. 420 undis- turbed and not re-used. The fragmentary state of most objects might most likely be due to a termite infestation that also occurred in other tombs from this site. The majority of objects can be described as usual equipment, probably apart from the two dolls (entry 1 and 2) which shed some light on the personal sphere of the tomb owner123. As indicated above, BH no. 420 was not an isolated tomb but most likely formed part of a cluster of tombs. Alt- hough probably not entirely reliable, the relative position of tombs can nevertheless be as- 118 A.H.

In order to do so, two major aspects have to be analysed: first, the relation of groups of tomb according to nom- archs' tombs at the upper terrace125. In order to see whether such links can indeed be estab- lished, the assessment of excavation plans of mainly horizontally laid out cemeteries and the identification of patterns, directions, sizes of tomb shafts etc. must be a priority. Follow- ing on from there, groups of neighbouring tombs are to be investigated to identify internal connections within clusters. Where respective inscriptions are missing126, the most im- portant factor to prove whether any group pattern is likely or not to have emerged is through the dating of tombs and their equipment127. Taking into account that due to geolog- ical formations or surface buildings like ka-chapels, irregular patterns are more likely to show than not, the identification of relative locations of tombs alone cannot reveal any evi- dence by itself without further proof. According to Garstang's necropolis plan, the group of tombs revolving around BH no. 420 is built within the elongation of axis from tomb BH XXI128 (fig. 1). This is an im- portant observation since Garstang assumed that the "entourage" of the "feudal chieftains" had their tombs near to theirs129. Tomb XXI belonged to Nakht who held the titles hr.y-tp ri n Mì-hd, hì.t.y-r , im.y-rì hìs.w.t iìb.t.y.w , hì.t.y-c m nw.t Mnc.t-Hwfw and hr.y-hb. Khnum- hotep II states that Senwosret (I) appointed the eldest son of his grandfather Khnumhotep I130, Nakht131, to his inheritance of Menat-Khufu132 which is confirmed by Nakht's titles as shown above. Nakht, therefore, held the post of head of Menat-Khufu between the admin- istrations of Khnumhotep I and Khnumhotep II133. If his son Khnumhotep II took over the administration from his father upon his death, Nakht would have died in regnal year 19 of Amenemhat II134, around c. 1892 BC. Built c. 150 years after the end of the First Intermedi- ate Period, no social connection between BH XXI and the cluster of tombs under discussion can therefore be established, nor is there a clear indication evident of social stratification of Upper and Lower Terrace burials during the First Intermediate Period135. In fact, when BH no. 420 was built, nomarchs were not yet buried at Beni Hassan136. 124 Garstang, Burial Customs, Pl. IV. 125 Alternatively, tombs were built in the vicinity of existing causeways to let tomb owners fully benefit from regular funerary rites of important predecessors. This aspect currently undergoes further research by C. Graves as part of his PhD dissertation at the University of Birmingham. 126 This is most commonly the case, in ancient Egypt tomb owners do not refer to each other in their tomb inscription. 127 Obviously, the assessment of tomb equipment is hindered in those cases which reveal usurpation or de- struction by tomb robbers.

Of these, only 20 tombs included finds while 10 have been found with enough datable funeray goods140 although in various stages of decay141. According to the excavators, only BH no. 275 was 'found undisturbed' but this can hardly be the case with no vessel being recorded142. Of these 10 tombs, (parts of) the contents of only 7 tombs are identifiable in collections today143. As a result, only these 7 out of 39 tombs of this cluster qualify for further investigation into chronology. Among these, the most common pottery types of vessels that occur in the majority of these tombs are types 25/26144, 15145 and 32146, with the largest agreement on forms being found among sets of data belonging BH nos. 269 and 761. Both tombs are located at the far ends of this cluster of tombs and assumingly define its boarders. The date of this cluster can therefore be estab- lished as follows: while the inner circle does not allow for precise dating, the outer circle's date ranges from the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the 12th Dyn.147: Tomb Types Orel Types Date Garstang 26 8 25/26B 25 Dyn. 11-12 269 34 1,4,6,9, 15, First Intermediate Period- 24, 26, 32, Dyn. 1 1 37, 39,41 271 ? 15,26 First Intermediate Period- early Dyn. 12 275 "Globular, short necked jar" - 420 13 13 First Intermediate Period 761 25/26 15,26,32,40 First Intermediate Period- early Dyn. 12 137 The following tombs constitute the outer and most probably later circle (starting from BH 420, clock- wise): BH 420, 268, 426, 265, 267, 264, 263, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 607, 608, 619, 751, 753, 766, 761, 760, 754, 755, 750, 752, 618, 616, 614 and 612. 138 The inner circle consists of (from East to West): 765, 759, 756, 606, 605, 422, 275 and 276. 139 These are 263, 264, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 275, 276, 420, 422, 605, 606, 607, 608, 751, 755 and 761. 140 The presence of pottery serves as an indicator of an undisturbed burial. 141 These are BH 263, 264, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 275, 420, 605 and 761. 142 Also BH 270 was seemingly found without pottery. 143 These are BH 268, 269, 270, 271, 275, 420 and 761, according to Orel, Chronology. 144 According to Orel, Chronology, 102, this type of vessels showing forms with wide necks and ovoid bodies date to the transition from Dynasties 1 1 to 12 before the reign of Senwosret II. This type of vessel occurs in 108 out of 888 tombs of the Lower Necropolis. 145 Orel, Chronology, 85: "F.I. P. -post reunification Dyn. XI or early Dyn. 12". 146 Orel, Chronology, 1 12: "F.I.P." 147 If this cluster of tombs was indeed organised in concentric circles, the outer circle had to be of later date. However, since the tombs of the inner circle defy proper analysis today, this possibility cannot be verified.</page><page sequence="22">64 M. Bommas SAK 41 No connection - social or professional - can be established between any of these tomb owners who used this site as a burial place over a period of ca. 70 years, however, two of those buried here bore the same name, Tjai: BH nos. 269 and 275. According to Garstang's plan these tombs lie in a distance of only 5 metres away from each other. This cluster was frequently used with more than two burials per year until it went out of use. However, at the beginning of the 12th Dyn., this cluster was still relatively recent and its occupants perhaps still known to the community which is why signs of usurpation do not exist. 10 Priorities for future work at the lower terrace of Beni Hassan Needless to say that similar investigations are advisable for each cluster of tombs within the Lower Terraces and neighbouring tombs of later dates before the results presented here can be assigned or rejected with regard to all 888 tombs known to John Garstang. As far as burials of the First Intermediate Period at Beni Hassan are concerned, the research present- ed here allows for the following conclusions which differ from previous studies of the site: First, no evidence for social stratification can be ascertained: when BH no. 420 was built, the upper rank was not yet in use and no nomarchs buried there. The distribution pattern identified here and different from burial customs of the Old and Middle Kingdoms, might have to do with the fact that during the First Intermediate Period no high ranking officials or political leaders were available in whose presence would have one wished to be buried. Instead of vertical social stratification, a less hierarchical way of living and dying was fa- voured by the elite who could afford the burials under discussion. Secondly, unaffected from hierarchical structures, independent clusters of tombs were created within the greater necropolis which offered burial places for connected social groups with shared identities. Third, as the pottery and other funerary equipment show, the lower necropolis of Beni Has- san was in constant use and no break of occupancy can be identified. Fourthly, no axial development of tomb building activity can be identified, nor contractions of tombs to the south and north of the site but clusters that were spread over the entire necropolis, allowing the living to bury dead individuals according to their social context. In order to prove these results on a larger level, future research on the burial practice of the First Intermediate Peri- od and the transition to the Middle Kingdom should ideally include several methodological approaches where insufficient working methods of early excavators currently hinder the assessment of burial sites: 1) Where up-to-date maps are missing and accuracy is crucial, survey grade differen- tial Global Positioning System (GPS) across an entire area can provide three-dimensional positional information. This can result in a contour plan at centimetre accuracy including any archaeological features visible on the surface. 2) Where no detailed plans of the shaft tombs excavated are available to assess architecture and measurements, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) can be used to obtain this information. Data recorded in transects across sites and landscapes can be interrogated to identify shaft tombs and other buried remains. In addition, transects can be surveyed across</page><page sequence="23">2012 First Intermediate Period tombs at Beni Hassan 65 the whole landscape systematically to identify other buried remains which might have es- caped earlier excavators' attention148. 3) In order to investigate the relation between the tombs of the lower terrace towards the rock cut tombs of the upper terrace high-definition laser scanning can be applied. This technique uses laser technology to capture literally millions of three-dimensional positions across a site, buildings or landscape. Laser scanning of a landscape such as Beni Hassan will provide a highly detailed three-dimensional model of the landscape and topography in relation to the archaeology of both the lower and upper terraces. Where possible, remains of superstructures of tombs can be added to reveal a close-to-reality view of the site under investigation. 4) Wherever possible, complete contents of tombs excavated will have to be taken into account to understand the sociality of funerary artefacts. Unless all artefacts once available are (re-)collected in archives and museum collections, no statement is possible about dates of occupancy of a necropolis, development and social status of its inhabitants. 5) The establishment of dates of start of construction must come over a tomb's occu- pancy as suggested by its funerary equipment or inscriptions. First, some tombs were not built on demand but ahead for future buyers, secondly, many older tombs were re-used during the Middle Kingdom. Funerary equipment allow for assessments of occupancy, not for the reconstruction of the building history or development of a necropolis. 148 The three-dimensional modelling of these data also has the potential of 3D mapping of galleries beneath the ground.</page><page sequence="24">2012 M.
