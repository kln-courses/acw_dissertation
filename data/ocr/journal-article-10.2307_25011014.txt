<plain_text><page sequence="1">C. M. C. GREEN "The Necessary Murder": Myth, Ritual, and Civil War in Lucan, Book 3 LUCAN CREATED the relationship between Pompey and Caesar, it has been argued, on the pattern of the relationship of Agamemnon and Achilles.1 Thus it is through an acknowledgment of his Greek literary ancestry that Lucan constructs the opening of his epic. The rivalry between the great leader and the young warrior provides the explosive, psychological beginnings (hae ducibus causae ... 1.158) of the action of the Bellum Civile, shaping the conflict as one which, while between individuals, remains even less personal than that between Agamem non and Achilles. Yet, though Achilles threatens, he does not in the end take his men home and abandon Agamemnon. Their personal quarrel is resolved, and thus subordinated to their obligations in the greater battle against the Tro jans. Caesar, enraged with Pompey's arrogance, does take his troops home; the Iliadic pattern is violated, so that the Greek epic pattern will no longer serve the Roman epic poet. We must now consider what paradigm Lucan sets in its place. The battles, purges, and proscriptions of the Civil Wars had left lasting scars on the Roman people. Those Roman writers-historians and poets alike-who survived the end of the Republic knew too well the wounds that lay beneath the polished surface of Augustan peace. In their attempts to reconcile who the Romans were with what they had done, several authors-Horace and Livy especially-had I would like to thank the anonymous readers for their many helpful comments, and the editors, in particular Professor Thomas Habinek, for their thoughtful and percipient editorial advice, from which I have benefited greatly. 1. Lucan's imitation of Homer and his employment of Homeric themes in Book 1 has been most recently discussed in C. M. C. Green, "StimulosDeditAemula Virtus: Lucan and Homer Reconsidered," Phoenix 45 (1992) 234-49; cf. also M. von Albrecht, "Der Dichter Lucan und die epische Tradition," in M.

When Lucan in turn, not quite a century later, had to confront Caesar's armies on the march toward Rome, he could thus accept and adapt for his epic an already fully developed mythic connection. He extended the mythic significance yet further, however, by exploiting the religious paradigm of combat and murder for kingship that had once been practiced by Latin communities, a paradigm exemplified by the rex nemorensis, the king of the wood. The rex and his cult were still extant in Lucan's time, and were not the only source for such a kingship ritual. It is the purpose of the present article to set out the evidence for Lucan's use of such a paradigm, and then, using this as a guide, to reassess Book 3 of the Bellum Civile in the terms that it dictates.2 The choice of Book 3 is logical: it is here that the themes of sacred place, sacred combat, and the necessary murder are most clearly presented. It is my further purpose to demonstrate that seeming inconsistencies in the nature of the gods in Lucan's epic can be at least partially resolved if we understand that the gods must remain aloof, outside the action, while the ritual takes place, even though they themselves have instituted the ritual of kingship murder, and will, when it is completed, receive the murderer as their ritually validated priest-king. I will conclude by suggesting ways 2. Lucan scholarship has been much advanced by the recent publication of V. J. C. Hunink, M. Annaeus Lucanus: Bellum Civile Book III, A Commentary (Amsterdam, 1992). Hunink provides not only a useful line-by-line commentary with citations of the most important scholarship, but also a larger overview of Lucan's poetic purposes and the relationship of Book 3 to the rest of the epic. We have no Servius or Donatus to help us understand Lucan. We have, rather, a grammarian-Quintilian who (Inst. 10.90) placed Lucan among the rhetoricians rather than among the epic poets, and two later Latin writers-Martial (14.194) and Fronto (2.105)-who seem to agree with Petronius (118.6) that the subject matter of a civil war in itself was unsuitable for epic (non enim res gestae versibus comprehendendae sunt). Even though modem scholarship has tried to rescue Lucan as a poet, for too long it remained in thrall to the epic as defined by Virgil and explained by Servius, a juxtaposition that damns him at virtually every turn (cf. J. D. Duff, Lucan: The Civil War [London, 1928, repr. 1988] xii). Hunink, happily, shares the approach taken more recently by important scholars, e.g. M. P. O. Morford, The PoetLucan (Oxford, 1967), F. Ahl, Lucan: An Introduction (Ithaca, 1976), W. R. Johnson, Momentary Monsters (Ithaca, 1987), and E. Fantham, De Bello Civile, Book II (Cambridge, 1992), in taking Lucan seriously on his own-rather than Virgil's-terms. Still, the traditional view of Lucan has by no means been discarded (cf. Philip Hardie, The Epic Successors of Virgil [Cambridge, 1993]-an elegant demonstration that modem critical theory can be used to create variations on, rather than challenges to, accepted criteria). I do not by any means undervalue the very important place emulation and imitation have in Lucan's poetry, nor the significance for it of rhetoric, Stoicism ("zwei Grundkrafte antiker Kultur" G. Luck, Lukan: DerBirgerkrieg [Berlin, 1985] 37), or indeed of romantic Republicanism (cf. N. F Deratani, "Der Kampf fur Freiheit und Patriotismus," in W. Rutz, ed., Lucan [Darmstadt, 1970] 133-48)-all of which have, nevertheless, been equally unconvincing in explaining the nature of Lucan's epic. By such standards, whether set by Virgil, patriotism, or Stoicism, and however sympathetically applied, Lucan fails as an epic poet. This, it seems to me, is an indication of the inappropriateness of the standards rather than an insight into the reason for his failure. Thus Hunink's approach-"The basic assumption I have constantly made is that even a problematic or strange element in Lucan's text must make some sort of sense, and should not be too easily explained as a corruption of the text, a technical or moral failure of the author, or a needless repetition or filler ..." (xix)-is especially welcome. I sometimes disagree with Hunink's conclusions-availing myself of his generous encouragement in the introduction (xxi) to do just that-but not with his method.</page><page sequence="3">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 205 in which this paradigm, if accepted, begins to clarify various puzzling choices Lucan has made elsewhere in the epic, as regards his narrative of events, his development of character, and the recurrent images of lightning, tree, and blood sacrifice owed to the gods. I The need to find not just an explanation for the Civil Wars, but an explanation of the Roman people, is given anguished voice in one of Horace's epodes: Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? aut cur dexteris aptantur enses conditi? parumne campis atque Neptuno super fusum est Latini sanguinis? Horace, Epode 7.1-4 Where, villains, where are you rushing? Why are once-sheathed swords at the ready in your right hands? Has not enough Latin blood been shed on land and sea?3 He demands an answer-responsum date! (7.14)-and the response given is one that has been shaped to this very purpose by two centuries of Republican writers: sic est: acerba fata Romanos agunt scelusque fraternae necis, ut immerentis fluxit in terram Remi sacer nepotibus cruor. Ibid., 7.17-20 So it is: harsh fates and the crime of a brother's murder drive the Romans on, just as when the blood of undeserving Remus flowed onto the earth, a curse upon his descendants. Fratricide and civil war were the private and public faces of the same crime; they had come to be seen as the inescapable legacy of Romulus's murder of Remus to protect his regnum over Rome. This is not just a poet's figurative language. For Livy, Romulus and Remus present the same lesson: Intervenit deinde his cogitationibus avitum malum, regni cupido, atque inde foedum certamen coortum a satis miti principio. Livy 1.6.4 These plans [for the foundation of Rome] were interrupted by the wicked ness that had marked their grandfather, greed for kingship (regni cupido), 3. The translations are my own throughout, and are designed to emphasize the meaning rather than the poetry of the passages.</page><page sequence="4">206 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 and thence, from a peaceful enough beginning, a loathsome competition grew. That the murder of Remus was the direct and fated result of the conflict between the brothers over regnum formed an essential part of the Republican tradition. It can be traced back to Ennius's account of Romulus and Remus-curantes magna cum cura tur cupientes / regni dant operam simul auspicio augurioque ("Having a great concern, indeed, a greed for kingship, they gave their attention at once to the auspices and the augury," Ennius,Ann. 1.47.1-2 Skutsch) and sic expectabatpopulus atque ore timebat / rebus utri magni victoria sit data regni ("Thus their followers were waiting, with fear in their faces for the state, to see to which of the two men would victory of the great kingship be given," Ann. 1.47.12-13 Skutsch). Lucretius, DRN 3.68-72, links civil war and fratricide. "Romulus' victory was only secured by a crime and that crime of fratricide continued to reassert itself throughout Roman history. The evils of the Civil Wars were seen as a legacy of Romulus' acts ... ."4 It is hardly surprising that Lucan is, in turn, as powerfully affected by this view as were his predecessors. His sententia defining the cause of the Civil War as the competition between two men for the regnum of Rome-nulla fides regni sociis, omnisque potestas / impatiens consortis erit ("kingship has no loyalty to its allies, and every power / will be intolerant of a colleague,"1.92-93)5-is completed by the paradigm of that first murder:6 ... nec gentibus ullis credite, nec longe fatorum exempla petantur: fraterno primi maduerunt sanguine muri.7 1.93-95 ... You need look to no foreign peoples, nor seek examples of these fates far away: the first walls were soaked in a brother's blood. The first walls of Rome, then, were stained with human blood in a fight for regnum. In nulla fides regni sociis ("kingship has no loyalty to its allies"), Lucan is very 4. R. M. Ogilvie, Commentary on Livy, Books 1-5 (Oxford, 1965) on 1.6.3 (the Romulus story). 5. In my rendering of the passages from Lucan, I am much indebted to Duff (supra, n. 2). Here, however, the commonly accepted translation which renders regni as a descriptive genitive dependent upon sociis (e.g., Duff, ad loc., "so long will loyalty be impossible between sharers in tyranny") neglects an important aspect of Lucan's meaning. The genitive regni may equally well be understood as a possessive dependent upon nulla fides. Kingship itself precludes the loyalty and trust (fides) upon which alliances are built. The first half of the sententia is therefore rooted in the historical distinction between the sole power of the kings (or the Caesars) and the shared power of the republican magistracies. The second half reflects the human truth that all kinds of power breed rivalry, even in those republican magistracies, particularly the consulate, which had been formulated to protect the state against the power that automatically accrued to an individual who held power alone. 6. Tibullus too viewed the foundation myth in this bleak light (Tib. 2.5.24). 7. Throughout I follow the text of D. R. Shackleton Bailey, M. Annaei Lucani: De Bello Civili, Libri X (Stuttgart, 1988).</page><page sequence="5">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 207 particularly naming the same type of rule as the one over which the fides of Pompey and Caesar-allies in the first Triumvirate-will fail. The point of this sententia is lost if we understand regnum here to mean no more than "tyranny" (as Duff has it), a Greek-derived andpolis-based concept, rather than "kingship,"8 which both reflects the sense of the Latin root and maintains crucial historical associations, including Lucan's reminder that kingship preceded and was a step toward the creation of Rome as a civitas.9 Not the abstract concept of "tyrannical power," not even the political reality of the "first Triumvirate," but rather kingship itself is unmistakably Lucan's meaning.'? This is further emphasized by his conscious echo of Ennius's line, nulla sancta societas / nec fides regni est ("There is no sacred alliance, no loyalty in kingship"),l1 a line we know precisely because Cicero (de Off. 1.8.26) used it to illustrate the nature of Caesar's regnum. The belief (or fear) that Caesar actually wanted to make himself king in Rome was one of the principal justifications for his assassination.'2 Caesar and Pompey, then (not brothers, but father- and son-in-law), are striv ing for the same prize that Romulus and Remus sought. The whole structure of Lucan's epic emphasizes this, for everywhere the military conflict is subordinate to, and a violent reflection of, the personal struggle between two men. Murderous conflict, whether manifested in civil war or assassination, is an inseparable part of the kind of power for which Pompey and Caesar compete.'3 This power is inseparable from place. Regnum, for Caesar and Pompey, is not sovereignty as an abstract notion, but kingship in Rome. Lucan concludes the paradigm of the conflict between Romulus and Remus with a comparison of Rome, the victor's prize, now and then: 8. E.g., sic pulso Tarquinio nomen regis audire non poterat (Cic. de Rep. 2.30.52). "When Cicero uses terms such as rex in an unfavorable sense in his letters ... the subject he is discussing is almost always Caesar," A. Erskine, "Hellenistic Monarchy and Roman Political Invective," CQ 41 (1991) 119. 9. Cf. Lucretius's description of the evolution of human society, where kings show humans the way to civilization, and begin to build cities, citadels and refuges: condere coeperunt urbis arcemque locare / praesidium reges ipsi sibi perfugiumque (DRN 5.1108-1109), cf. Polyb. 6.5.4-8, and Livy, Book 1. 10. Indeed, Lucan's view of the first Triumvirate was that it delayed the madness, as he says in the very next lines: nam sola futuri / Crassus erat belli medius mora (1.99-100). This has no historical justification, but rather alerts us to the fact that in Lucan's poetical view the conflict of the Civil War arises when only two men remain in power. A third defuses the conflict. This is an implicit argument for Senatorial oligarchy. 11. Ennius, fr. 402-403 exfabulis incertis, E. H. Warmington, Remains ofOldLatin I (Cambridge, Mass., 1935). 12. Cic. Phil. 2.34.85; Suet. Div. Iul. 79. 13. Rome was founded by Romulus vi et armis, according to Livy (1.19.1). Caesar made himself, by his own propaganda, Romulus's heir; but, Livy continues, Numa founded the city anew: iure earn legibusque ac moribus de integro condereparat, (Livy 1.19.1); and again: ita duo deinceps reges, alius alia via, ille [Romulus] bello, hic [Numa] pace, civitatem auxerunt (Livy 1.21.6). Small wonder that Augustus's propaganda presented him in Numa's role, directing Rome's legal (re)founding (Sen. Apoc. 10.2).</page><page sequence="6">208 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 nec pretium tanti tellus pontusque furoris tunc erat: exiguum dominos commisit asylum. 1.96-97 ... and at that time, land and sea were not the prize for such a great frenzy: a robbers' hideout brought the leaders to battle. This comparison serves to re-emphasize the parallel between Romulus's act and Caesar's, and to remind us that the pathology is the same, whether Rome is the capital of a great empire or a small clearing on the Capitol. Lucan chose the asylum to symbolize the earliest, and smallest, physical entity of Rome, and this reminds us that the asylum on the Capitoline hill14 was originally the haven of escaped slaves, criminals, and others excluded from, or hostile to, political order.'5 Rome was not only founded by a murderer, but her first citizens were exiles, fugitive slaves, murderers, and every other kind of violator of civil and religious law: men like Romulus, and Caesar, and their followers. In her end is her beginning. II The asylum at Rome was not unique. Other Latin communities had similar sacred areas of refuge for exiles or escaped slaves.16 The most famous, partly because it was the longest lasting, and partly because Virgil's use of one element of the ritual associated with it guaranteed it a place in Servius's commentary on the Aeneid, was the grove of Diana above Aricia, the site of the cult of the rex nemorensis.17 While the cult of the king of the wood may have been peculiar to 14. Virg. Aen. 8.342; Livy 1.9.5; Dio Cass. 47.19.3. 15. Dio Cass. 47.19.3; Dion. Hal. 2.15.3-4; Plut. Rom. 9. The tradition of the asylum was strong, though not entirely clear. It is very interesting, in this regard, that the temple to Divus Iulius also became an asylum; Julius Caesar was the only god so honored since the first asylum of Romulus (Dio Cass. 47.19.3). This can hardly have been a deliberate decision by Augustus. It must, rather, have been a popular belief, with potentially explosive consequences. Augustus had the temple fenced off. Asylum remained, but was henceforth inaccessible. See C. Renaud's analysis of the exile theme in theAeneid (Studies in the Eighth Book of theAeneid: The Importance of Place [Diss. Univ. of Texas at Austin, 1990] 117-34). As Renaud observes, the asylum was important to Virgil as a symbol of the inclusiveness of Rome, her function from the mythical arrival of Saturn, through whom Virgil creates an aition for Latium as a hiding place (8.322-23). Virgil's meliorist vision compelled him, however, to exclude any mention of the various unpleasantnesses on account of which Saturn (for the eating of his children) and Evander (because of some hostility from the gods-non meriti poenam pateris, sed numinis iram, Ovid, Fast. 1.483) became exiles. Lucan, of course, has every reason to be deeply concerned with the tradition of crime, exile, and asylum as integral parts of Rome's greatness. 16. Cf. the Lucus Feroniae near Mount Soracte. At Anxur the goddess Feronia had a temple where slaves could take refuge (Servius ad Aen. 8.564, H. H. Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic [Ithaca, 1981] 197-98). 17. The worship of Diana at Aricia must be very old. The temple remains that have been excavated do not antedate the fourth century, but Diana's character as a woodland deity, the sacred grove which was part of her sanctuary, the extraordinary rite of the rex nemorensis, and its similarity to Celtic woodland cults, also without temples or religious architecture, all argue for a cult that long</page><page sequence="7">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 209 Aricia, there is evidence that a similar kind of rite was-at least for a time-practiced at Rome. More importantly for our present purposes, there is evidence that the cult of the rex nemorensis was thought, in Lucan's time, to be directly associated with rites that affected the succession to the imperial throne. Let us review, first, the cult itself, then the relationship of this cult to the Roman kings in the sixth century B.C., and, finally, the evidence for Lucan's knowledge of it and its significance for his narrative. In the mountains above the city of Aricia there was a grove, sacred to Diana and ruled over by a priest-king. He was an escaped slave who had won his exalted position by slaying his predecessor. The priest-king's life was dedicated to protecting the goddess's sacred tree, and he had to be ready, night and day, to fend off challengers with his sword.18 We do not have a full description of the rite, but from Servius's account we know that any challenger to the reigning priest-king had also to be a fugitive, and to declare his challenge by cutting off the golden bough. If the challenger succeeded in this first test, there was then (though surely not immediately) a mortal combat fought between the two. One of them must die, and the survivor became the next priest-king. Thus the sacred grove is a refuge for fugitives, of whom the priest-king has been one. As priest he is the goddess's servant, and perhaps her husband.19 As king, he serves as her protector, and the protector of the sacred tree. His successor must challenge him by cutting off the golden bough which grows on her sacred tree.20 The cut bough requires the priest to meet the challenger in sacred, mortal combat. The victor is the new priest-king. To clarify Lucan's use of the rite, it is particularly important to emphasize several aspects of the ritual that may otherwise escape our notice. The assault on predated, and would have been irrelevant to, formal temple buildings. Cf. A. E. Gordon, "The Cults of Aricia," UCPA II (1934) 1-20; and S. Piggott, The Druids (New York, 1968, repr. 1991) 19 (on the similarity of the rituals at Nemi to Celtic sacrifices) and 48-51 (on the absence of temples in Celtic sanctuaries). A. Alf6ldi, "Diana Nemorensis," AJA 64 (1960) 137-44, demonstrates, in a discussion arising from the interpretation of numismatic evidence, the pervasive importance of Diana's cult at Nemi in Roman culture. 18. OvidArsAm. 1.258-62; Str. 5.3.12; Suet. Cal. 35; Paus. 2.27.4; Serv. adAen. 2.116, 6.136. 19. In very early times (Peter HRF Cato fr. 71) the rite had acquired Orestes and Iphigenia transported from Scythia to Aricia-and was understood to commemorate Orestes' status as a fugitive: the fugitive slave who became priest was the Orestes/king figure and the priestess was the Iphi genia/queen/Diana figure (Servius ad Aen. 2.116, 6.136; Ovid Met. 15.489). As we will see, the contemporary evidence for Lucan suggests strongly that the rite involved an "incestuous" marriage between the Orestes-priest and the Iphigenia-priestess (which may or may not have been physically consummated by the human incumbents of the parts). 20. Servius (adAen. 2.116 and 6.136) offers the most complete evidence, but both Strabo (5.3.12) and Pausanias (2.27.4) mention the priest-king forever on guard. Suetonius (Cal. 35) records Caligula's irritation with the long reign of the current king, and his solution of the problem. Virgil (e.g.,Aen. 2.116, 6.139, 7.515, 7.761-82) and Ovid (e.g., Ars Am. 1.258ff., Fasti 3.261ff.) both made use of various aspects of the cult at Aricia. J. G. Frazer's monumental work, The Golden Bough3 I-XII (London, 1911-1915) of course originated in his study of this rite. Vols. I and II, The MagicArt, still provide the most complete and informative discussion of the ancient evidence, though the many theories Frazer derived from the cult are no longer widely accepted.</page><page sequence="8">210 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 the tree is a sacrilege committed against the goddess herself, and both the reigning king and the challenger must have committed this crime. The defeated one is the sacrificial victim, the victor is the anointed priest, and the combat is a test of the goddess's will, which can only be ascertained by the outcome of the combat. Most important of all, the entire ritual is instituted by the goddess herself-that is, the sacrilege, the murder, and the victor's ascension to priesthood are all equally part of the ritual and are all therefore equally sacred. Possession of Diana's grove made Aricia enormously wealthy, a condition that prevailed without doubt well into the first century B.c.,21 and quite possibly on into Lucan's own day. Indeed, in the time of the kings at Rome, Aricia was a greater power than Rome, and an equal to the most important cities in central Italy. She shared control with Alba Longa of the source of the Ferentine river (caput aquae ferentinae), the gathering place for the leaders (proceres) of the Latin tribes, where Turnus confronted Tarquinius (Livy 1.50; Dion. Hal. 4.50), who, by his behavior to the rest of the Latin leaders, earned his sobriquet Superbus. During the fifth century B.C., Aricia, like the other Latin cities, was defeated by the Romans several times, in fact22-but preparations for her permanent eclipse by Rome had been made, almost a century earlier, by Servius Tullius, who held the last legitimate Roman kingship,23 and who appropriated Aricia's cult of Diana as an assertion of Rome's claim to political, as well as religious, leadership of the Latin people: Saepe iterando eadem perpulit tandem, ut Romae fanum Dianae populi Latini cum populo Romano facerent. Ea erat confessio caput rerum Romam esse, de quo totiens armis certatum fuerat. Livy 1.45.2-324 Through constant effort, he (Servius) finally got his way, with the result that the Latins and the Romans together created a shrine to Diana at Rome. This was an admission that Rome was their common capital (caput rerum), a question over which they had so many times gone to war. Livy concludes his account with the story of a magnificent heifer, a prodigy. Imperial power would belong to the state whose citizens sacrificed this heifer to Diana, 21. As demonstrated by the fact that Octavian looted the sanctuary during the civil war (Appian B.C. 5.3.24). 22. She was eventually compelled to acknowledge Rome's hegemony, through the foedus Cas sianum, dated (probably) to the early years of the Republic. 23. ... cum illo simul iusta ac legitima regna occiderunt (Livy 1.49.8). 24. Cf. Dion. Hal. 4.1.2-3. Rome at some time absorbed (or imitated) in similar fashion the cult of Jupiter Latiaris from Alba Longa (cf. G. Wissowa, Religion und Kultus derRomer [Minchen, 1912] 24; K. Latte, R6mische Religionsgeschichte [Miinchen, 1960] 144-47; Scullard [supra, n. 16] 111-13). The tradition was that certain games of combat and races were established by Romulus in honor of Jupiter Feretrius, Schol. Bern. ad Virg. Georg. 2.384, and Servius adAen. 3.384. Later, when under Tarquinius Priscus the temple on the Capitoline was built, they became the Ludi Capitolini. Consider the similar principles of evocatio (cf. Livy 5.21 [on "calling out" Juno from Veii]; Pliny H.N. 28.18; Macrobius, Sat. 3.9.7-8 [the religious formula for the "calling out" of a deity]).</page><page sequence="9">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 211 according to the soothsayers (ibi fore imperium, Livy 1.45.5). Among the gods, while Jupiter certainly represents Rome's will to imperium, Diana, clearly, is the divinity who has the power to guarantee it. No wonder Servius was anxious to establish her cult in Rome. Servius's sanctuary of Dianaz on the Aventine (there well may not have been a temple at first) imitated several important aspects of the cult at Aricia. First, the festal day was the same as that at Aricia-August 13.6 Slaves celebrated a holiday on this day: they could participate in the rite (not a common practice), and the cult was particularly sacred to them. Indeed, according to Festus, the temple was a sanctuary for escaped slaves.7 Moreover, the success of Servius's appropriation of the cult was as important as the move itself, for it testified to divine authorization for Rome's expanding power, a very forceful confirmation in the early period when belief was strong and rationalism and syncretism had not yet drained divinity of its present numen. Though in Republican times the Aventine cult did not include the "ghastly priest," the priest may indeed have been part of Servius's foundation. There is evidence that Servius Tullius, as king, was himself Diana's priest. According to a tradition that could not be denied-despite the openly expressed dismay of historians such as Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus-Servius Tullius was born a slave.8 He succeeded Tarquinius Priscus upon that king's violent death, and accomplished this through the intercession of Tarquinius's queen (Livy 1.40-41).29 As an old 25. It is interesting, in view of Lucan's choice of the Massiliotes as a focus for the action of Book 3, that the cult statue of Diana on the Aventine was traditionally a copy of the cult statue of Artemis at Massilia (Strabo 4.1.5). 26. See Wissowa (supra, n. 24) 34; Latte (supra, n. 24) 172; Scullard (supra, n. 16) 173-74; Alfdldi (supra, n. 17) 144. 27. Servorum dies festus vulgo existimatur Idus Aug. [the same date as the festival of Diana at Aricia], quod eo die Ser. Tullius, natus servus, aedem Dianae dedicaverit in Aventino, cuius tutelae sint cervi; a quo celeritatefugitivos vocent cervos (Festus 460 Lindsay). 28. Servius Tullius primus iniussu populi regnavisse traditur quem ferunt ex serva Tarquiniense natum (Cic. de Rep. 2.37). Dion. Hal. 4.1.2-3 accepted the tradition but made Servius the son of an Etruscan queen captured by Tarquinius Priscus and born during her period of captivity. Thus he could be the son of a slave and yet a king of royal blood. Dionysius also inserted a chapter explaining that in early Rome slaves were captured warriors, and could easily therefore be both slaves and of royal blood (4.24). Livy tells the same story, but cannot even allow Servius's mother to suffer a momentary stain of slavery: Hic quacumque de causa tantus illi honos habitus credere prohibet serva natum eum parvumque ipsum servisse (1.39.5). Clearly, for Livy, .. .ut in eadem civitate post centesimum fere annum quam Romulus deo prognatus deus ipse tenuerit regnum done in terris fuerit, id servus serva natus possideat (1.40.3). Cf. R.

The innate power of the tradition is attested by the fact that, even though Livy in particular is only too happy to adapt the pattern of a familiar Greek tale (cf. Ogilvie [supra, n. 4] 184-86 [adaptations from tragedy] and 359-61 [adaptations from Herodotus]), he does not observe here the remarkable similarity of Servius's accession to Herodotus's tale of Gyges (1.8-15).</page><page sequence="10">212 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 man, Servius was himself physically attacked and removed from the throne by his son-in-law, Tarquinius Superbus. There is a curious, and for this discussion revealing, chronological problem here. Tarquinius was supposed to be the son of Tarquinius Priscus (Livy 1.42.1),30 and was also young and vigorous enough to throw the elderly Servius downstairs (Livy 1.48.3), even though he had to be at least forty-four (the number of years Servius reigned, according to Livy, 1.48.8) and-if he was married to Tullia when Servius became king-was probably a good deal older than that.31 The important fact-that a young successor made a physical attack on the aging king-confounds the chronology, and reminds us that not Tarquinius's claim to the throne, but the physical attack, was what was crucial to the story. After the attack, Servius, the story goes, was murdered by Tarquinius's agents. The event is described in vivid and telling detail by Livy. Tullia, who is both sister and wife to Tarquinius, summons her husband out of the Curia and is the first to call him "king." Then she goes to the top of the Cyprian Way, where there was a shrine to Diana, and directs her carriage to turn right onto the Urbian Way.32 Servius is lying, dead, across the road. She orders the driver to drive over the body, spattering herself with the blood of her father, a crime so terrible that it has given the name to the street-the "Accursed Street." This horrible story is concluded by Livy thus: ceterum id quoque ad gloriam accessit quod cum illo simul iusta ac legitima regna occiderunt ("this, too, accrued to his glory, that with him just and lawful kingship disappeared," Livy 1.48.8).33 If we ignore the anachronistic color of contemporary politics that Livy and Dionysius apply to make sense of this, we see that it is remarkably like a ritual such as the one practiced by the rex nemorensis. Indeed, the oddest "facts," which, however much they are explained, are never explained away-Servius the slave; Tullia the daughter, sister, wife; the mysterious shrine to Diana on the Esquiline; Servius's blood on Tullia; the tradition that Tarquinius Superbus was not only "the son" but was also "the young, vigorous man" capable of heaving another man down steps, despite the chronological impossibility; the strange vanishing of any helpers 30. Livy (1.42.1) has the younger Tarquinius old enough to be married to Tullia immediately after Servius ascends the throne. 31. Dionysius confronts the problem directly (4.6-7) in a lengthy discussion. Dionysius's conclusion is based on the reasoning that Tarquinius had to be young enough to throw Servius down the steps, and therefore he makes him the grandson, not the son, of Tarquinius Priscus. It was easier to meddle with the chronology and relationships than to dispute the violent attack on Servius. 32. Frazer (supra, n. 20) I 321, n. 1, addresses the textual problem at in Urbium clivum ("the 'Urbian Way' "). Some late manuscripts give virbium, earlier manuscripts read urbium. The Clivus Virbius is, of course, the famous ramp approach to the sanctuary of Diana above Aricia (Pers. 6.55-56). Frazer prefers Virbium both as the lectio difficilior, and as the more appropriate name for the approach to the Dianium. Ogilvie (supra, n. 4, ad loc. 1.48.6) reads Urbium, on the authority of Varro, arguing that it is a good Etruscan word and that Virbius would have been a later connection, made because of the Dianium. 33.

It is enough that the tradition existed, was associated with a Roman king, Servius Tullius, and could be thus interpreted in Lucan's time.35 There is, fortunately, evidence suggesting that the rites of Diana were of more than a little interest to those around Lucan. Crispus Passienus, step-father to Nero, orator, Stoic, and friend of Seneca, was much concerned with Diana's cult.36 Pliny reports that Passienus formed an attachment to a certain exceptional tree in a grove near Tusculum, a grove which "by the ancient religious practices from Latium was sacred to Diana." Passienus would embrace and kiss the tree, sleep under it, and pour wine over it (NH 16.242). But of far greater importance for Lucan's understanding of the rites of Diana, as they relate to the history of Rome, is Claudius's curious use of the rites at a significant point in the chronic crisis of imperial succession. Tacitus records that Claudius ordered "expiatory rites (piacula) to be celebrated by the priests in the grove 34. This was first suggested by A. B. Cook, "The Golden Bough and the Rex Nemorensis" (review of The Golden Bough, vols 1-3), CR 16 (1902) 380, n. 3. Ogilvie (supra, n. 4) 184-87 thinks Livy is adapting an annalistic tradition in the light of (particularly Euripidean) tragedy, or Roman adaptations thereof. This is very probable. It does not, however, prevent us from seeing the older, non-Greek mythic tradition behind the tragic adaptations. The Oresteia is the tragedy to which he turns-not surprisingly, given Orestes and Iphigenia's intimate and long-standing connection to Aricia and the founding of the rite of the rex nemorensis. The unadapted Greek tragedy makes a rather awkward fit, however, with the story of Servius; as Ogilvie observes, Servius ought to be cast as Aegisthus, whereas Livy has meticulously avoided doing so by authenticating Servius's kingship with prodigies and refusing even to consider an illicit relationship between Tanaquil and the one-time slave. On the other hand, the rite instituted by Orestes and Iphigenia at Aricia does fit the story perfectly. While the psychology is indeed tragic, as Ogilvie argues, it is there to provide a Hellenizing gloss for the highly peculiar details which were not Hellenic, but could not be removed: a mortal battle between king and challenger, attended by a daughter/wife priestess, and concluded by some ritual at the Dianium involving the blood of the defeated king. The great advantage of the Oresteia, both at Aricia and at Rome, was that it gave that civilizing finish to what was otherwise a piece of unrefined ritual barbarism. Stripped of its Greek tragic personality, the bare bones of the story is thus: a king (Agamemnon) is murdered by his wife (Clytemnestra), who is in turn murdered by their son (Orestes) who must spend time as a fugitive before he eventually gains (another) kingdom in company with his sister (Iphigenia). Together they become the new king and queen. That is, surely, how the story of these mythic founders of the rite at Aricia must have been told. 35. Cf. Ogilvie (supra, n. 4) 185. Servius was for Polybius and others of his stamp a part of the natural development from monarchy (Romulus) to kingship (Servius) to tyranny (Tarquinius). However, the Sullan party used Servius as a justification for the Sullan constitution (App. B.C. 1.59.4), and Livy (in Ogilvie's judgment) hovers between the two versions. Certainly, as Ogilvie also argues, Servius represents the (temporary) intrusion of Latin kings and Latin rule into the period of Etruscan domination. Cf. Thomsen (supra, n. 28) 112-13, for a contrary view. Lucan would have had Ennius to use, as well as Polybius and Livy's other sources, and all the propaganda from the years of the Civil Wars. 36. Cf.

Such a priesthood attests Lucan's interest in, and access to, the religious traditions of the Romans, Etruscans, and-surely-the Latins. Thus, the rite of Diana (and this purification of incest-if that is what it was must relate to the part of the rite in which the Iphigenia-priestess "married" her "brother") has reappeared in precisely the context that supports our reading of Lucan's reference, and assures us that while the allusion may have been arcane, it did not require information unavailable to the audience for whom Lucan wrote. Tacitus's account of Claudius's efforts, at once learned and inept, to protect himself from a palace coup provides a connection that links Servius Tullius, the rite of Diana at Aricia, a purification ceremony conducted publicly at the grove (lucum Dianae), and the imperial household during Lucan's lifetime. III Now, when we turn to Book 3 of Lucan's epic, we can see, with much greater understanding, the metaphorical landscape Lucan paints for Caesar as he approaches Rome (3.84-97), foreseeing his destiny as Rome's master and, eventually, as a Roman deity. Caesar, descendant of Venus and King Iulus, looks down from Alba Longa, the seat of the first kings of Rome, his ancestors. He has crossed over high Anxur and marsh-ridden Pometia39-cities whose defeat had increased the power of 37. Tac.Ann. 12.8. 38. This all suggests that the purification was not for incest as such, but rather for the kind of actions that suggested Silanus was plotting to take the throne; that is, the "incest" was part, or appeared to be part, of a ritual preparation for a usurpation of the kingship-or, more likely, some event was interpreted by those hostile to Silanus as preparation for such an attack on Claudius. Incest was an easy accusation to make against someone who was an annoyance, but if that was all there was to this charge, the purification as such makes no sense. The emperor took the threat of "pollution" seriously and personally, but as Octavia was not yet married to Silanus, it is hard to see how he thought he (or the state) was affected by it. Claudius clearly judged the need for purification to outweigh the predictable public reaction in the context of his imminent marriage to Agrippina-which in his view only required the approval of the Senate, and a new law. Claudius's antiquarianism (cf. Suet. Claud. 22 and 42) may have made him liable to perceive others' actions in the light of his peculiar knowledge, and to suspect that they were using ancient Latin rites, like magical formulae, to improve the legitimacy of their supposed claims to the throne. Silanus was the great-great-grandson of Augustus, and therefore, prima facie, an eligible candidate. His two brothers also paid the price for this consanguinity. Cf. Tac.Ann. 12.3, 4, 8; Suet. Claud. 24, 29; Dio Cass. 60.5.31. 39. He crosses Anxur, the Pontine marshes (which in the regal period were rich agricultural territories held by Pometia, so wealthy a foundation that the Tarquins funded the temple to Jupiter Capitolinus out of the booty they got from its destruction), Aricia, and Alba Longa. One suspects</page><page sequence="13">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 215 Rome in Latium, and the power of Capitoline Jupiter. He has also passed the grove of Diana and the sacred regna of her cult. He has traveled up the Via Triumphalis to the sanctuary of Jupiter Latiaris, the second most powerful Jupiter in Latium: ... miratusque suae sic fatur moenia Romae: "tene, deum sedes, non ullo Marte coacti deseruere viri? pro qua pugnabitur urbe? di melius, quod non Latias Eous in oras nunc furor incubuit nec iuncto Sarmata velox Pannonio Dacisque Getes admixtus: habenti tam pavidum tibi, Roma, ducem Fortuna pepercit quod bellum civile fuit." 3.90-96 ... he marveled at the walls of his Rome and spoke thus: "Have men, not compelled by warfare, deserted you, the abode of the gods? For what city will there be war? The gods have willed the better end, that the frenzied East has not fallen on Latin shores, nor the swift Sarmatians with their Pannonian allies, nor the Getes and the Dacians combined. When you have so timorous a leader, Rome, Fortune has spared you, because the war has been civil." Caesar speaks directly to issues which we have raised: Rome is the abode of the gods-not least of Jupiter and the appropriated Diana-whom he will soon join as Iuppiter Iulius or as Divus Iulius; the walls which Romulus and Remus fought over for regnum are there before him; his fight with Pompey over these same walls awaits him-but Pompey has not stayed to fight. The central lines turn our attention to the peripheries of the Roman world, to the nightmare of barbarians descending on an undefended city, not only in order to heighten Rome's vulnerability-with or without Pompey she was at risk-but even more to prepare for the irony of the final clause. The barbarians are not a threat, because this is a civil war-a war between citizens (no barbarians allowed) and (thus far) an unpretentious, unfought war, since one of its two principal combatants (tam pavidum ... ducem-so timorous a leader) has left town, retreating with unseemly haste. Thus the barbarian threat (3.92-94) is an itinerary that reverses some account of Rome's early conquests-perhaps found in Ennius, who certainly mentioned both Alba Longa and Anxur. It is at Alba Longa, the home of his ancestors, and on the site of the sanctuary of Jupiter Latiaris (quaque iter est Latiis ad summam fascibus Albam) that Caesar stops and looks down, excelsa de rupe, at the walls of Rome. When he does so, Lucan has him address Rome as deum sedes (3.91). Lucan is looking back to the political and religious history of Rome, which had, by force majeure, become the abode of the gods. Yet he looks forward as well: Caesar's statue, with an inscription calling him flje0oq, was placed on the Capitoline in the cella of Jupiter; but even more particularly, it was voted in his honor that a golden chair and a diadem should be carried into the theatres i Troou LTool TrCV Oecv (Dio 44.6.3). But above all, Lucan must have in mind the Civil War's contribution to Roman cults: not just the cult of Divus lulius so familiar to us, but that ofluppiter ulius as well. Caesar was indeed looking down at Rome as the deum sedes-and he would be one of the gods whose abode was there.</page><page sequence="14">216 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 bracketed, contained, and then diffused, by the civil conflict over Rome (94-96). Our attention is focused directly on City and leaders, the irreducible ingredients of the Civil War. The war will be fought, despite Pompey's desertion. Central to this conflict is the shedding of human blood. Lucan signals very clearly and early that blood shed in the war is a human sacrifice owed to the gods, for Cato-the voice of morality, if not the hero of the epic-tells Brutus that because the gods demand it, the war will not end until the full measure of blood is shed: sic eat: immites Romana piacula divi plena ferant, nullo fraudemus sanguine bellum. 2.304-305 Let it be so. May the merciless gods accept Roman expiations in full measure; let us not defraud the war of a single drop of blood. Thus the war constitutes the expiations (piacula) that these merciless gods (immites divi) require. It is surely no accident that we have here a distinct echo of Horace's Epode 7 (sic est: acerba fata Romanos agunt.. .) quoted above. The bloodshed of war, the human sacrifice of Pharsalia, form a tragic, but essential, part of the mortal combat for regnum-ritualized in the cult of the rex nemorensis, mythologized in Romulus and Remus, incorporated in one way or another in the Roman city by the Latin king Servius Tullius, and realized once again in Caesar and Pompey. So Caesar, on the Alban Mount, looks down on the walls of Rome, walls that were built, according to tradition, by Servius Tullius (Livy 1.44.3). Pompey has fled. Fortune has spared Rome, with her timorous leader (3.96), because this is a civil war, just as Lucan says. Like Servius Tullius, Pompey is weakening daily, because this is the kind of war it is, a combat for kingship. With right on his side, with Cato's support, with all the Senate in his train, he is nevertheless still the leader who is being displaced. The comparison of Caesar, the vigorous, violent, enraged young fighter, with Pompey, the older, wearier, frightened leader, is of course a recurrent theme throughout the epic; but now it has a new, and brilliantly Roman, resonance, as befits a Roman epic. IV Thus, with Caesar poised above the fatal walls, let us consider now what signifi cance the allusion to the rite of the rex nemorensis might have for our understanding of Lucan's deeper poetic purpose within the often perplexing conjunction of events in Book 3.4 The narrative is as follows: Caesar approaches Rome (which Pompey has chosen not to defend) and there loots the temple of Saturn.

The scene shifts to Roman Gaul, specifically the territory of Massilia. When Massilia refuses to take sides in the war, Caesar begins a ruthless siege. In Lucan's account, the siege-works Caesar has devised in order to mount his attack against the city are of major importance.41 In order to get enough wood to build the works, a sacred grove must be cut down. The soldiers are afraid to commit such a sacrilege; Caesar is not, delivering the axe-blow to an oak even as he declares, proudly, "Be confident that I have committed the sacrilege!" The Massiliotes, indeed, are confident Caesar will be punished for his assault on the gods. Instead, Caesar, unharmed, departs for Spain, and the scene shifts, without explanation, from a siege to a naval battle. This naumachia, gory and utterly Lucanian, concludes the book. The victory of the naval battle goes to the (Caesarian) Romans rather than the (Greek) Massiliotes, but no mention is made of the fall of Massilia itself. The challenger to the rex nemorensis must first cut down the bough from the sacred tree42 in the sacred grove. The Arician grove was, even in historic times, very dense and dark43 despite the fact that a substantial complex of temples had grown up around it-physical evidence for the continuation of thriving religious business at Aricia-and the hillsides were studded with suburban villas.44 The tree and the priest were linked in an extraordinary union, no doubt reflecting a very early period of Italic religion in which the tree was an aspect of the goddess, and the priest both her protector and consort. The priest's duty was to defend the tree from injury; yet the man who would be king of the wood was compelled to do just that-he had to commit sacrilege in order to gain his sacred status in service to the goddess. Nevertheless, the sacrilege can only occur if it is divinely approved, for, as the Sibyl tells Aeneas, the bough may be cut only if the fates summon the challenger 41. Caesar himself devotes one chapter (B.C. 1.36) to his decision to besiege Massilia and the preparations which follow. Then he turns his attention to Spain. 42. The type of tree is not known. Frazer (supra, n. 20) II 379 believed it was an oak; Alf6ldi (supra, n. 17) 137-44 argues, from the coinage, that it was a cypress; Celtic archaeology (supported not a little by Pliny's account of sacred or ancient trees [NH 16.234-40]) suggests that the species of tree worshipped was not limited to oaks (as Pliny says is true of Druidic worship, NH 16.249), but included ash, yew, and perhaps hazel (cf. A. Ross, Pagan Celtic Britain [New York, 1967] 33-38). Given Diana Trivia's three aspects, however, it would seem prudent to suppose that in her grove (as in Lucan's grove outside Massilia) several different types of trees grew, and among them different species were considered sacred for the separate aspects of Diana's nature. Thus the cypress would indeed, as Alf6ldi argues, be identified with Diana-Hecate, but not necessarily with the other aspects of Diana, as Alfbldi implies. The oak might have been associated with Diana-Luna; certainly, from Pliny's account, oak and mistletoe were sacred to the moon (NH 16.249-51). We might speculate, then, that Diana the huntress could be associated with any of several trees, but perhaps most likely with a tree of outstanding size and age, whose fruit was good fodder for game: if not the oak again, then beech (Crispus Passienus's tree was a beech) or hazel. 43.

Lucius Brutus also had a villa at Nemi, to which he invited Cicero to meet Brutus two months after the murder of Caesar (Cic. ad Att. 15.4.5). So did Caligula (Suet. Cal. 35). It was, all in all, a fashionable place, almost a suburb of Rome, as Ovid says (ArsAm. 1.247).</page><page sequence="16">218 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 to this task.45 The fated injury to the tree commits the reigning priest-king to mortal combat. In this light we must rethink what exactly is represented in Book 3 by Caesar's decision to level the sacred grove, and indeed by the grove itself:46 Lucus erat longo numquam violatus ab aevo obscurum cingens conexis aera ramis et gelidas alte summotis solibus umbras. hunc non ruricolae Panes nemorumque potentes Silvani Nymphaeque tenent, sed barbara ritu sacra deum. structae diris altaribus arae omnisque humanis lustrata cruoribus arbor. 3.399-404 There was a grove, from the earliest time undefiled, encircling with inter laced boughs a murky space and shadows chilled because the sunlight from above was warded off. The rural Pans, the Silvani, rulers of the forest, and the Wood-Nymphs do not hold sway in this grove, but sacred ceremonies of the gods, barbarous in their observance. Shrines with dreadful altars have been erected and every tree has been ritually purified with human blood. The words should bring us back to the passage in which Lucan's first allusion to Scythian Diana appears: ... et quibus immitis placatur sanguine diro Teutates horrensque feris altaribus Esus et Taranis Scythicae non mitior ara Dianae. 1.444-4647 45. namque ipse [the bough] volens facilisque sequetur / si tefata vocant (Aen. 6.14647). 46. See Hunink (supra, n. 2) 167-70, for a summary of the scholarship to date. He is quite right to emphasize that the grove is a literary grove, and his verbal analysis of the word play (lucus &lt; lux played against the darkness of the grove) is most illuminating. However, his suggestion that Caesar in cutting the wood "merely pursues logistical aims" (173) is the counsel of despair, and the view that the grove represents what is morally bad is not defensible (185). If the grove itself is bad, morally, then cutting it down should not be an offense against the gods, and the youth of Massilia, which rejoices in the belief that the gods will punish Caesar for sacrilege, must be morally (rather than religiously) deceived. The whole incident is a deliberate creation by Lucan. We must acknowledge the importance of this, whatever we make of the invention itself. The weakness of Hunink's explanation is that cutting down a grove sacred to nameless barbarian deities in itself is pretty pathetic stuff for the "demonic and tyrannical Caesar" after he has crossed the Rubicon, brought civil war to Rome, and looted the temple of Saturn. It is especially pathetic once we realize the Massiliotes are wrong in thinking the gods will avenge the sacrilege. 47. On the questioned reading, and the justification for accepting the MS authority of non mitior, see C. M. C. Green, "Lucan Bellum Civile 1.444-6: A Reconsideration" CP 89.1 (1994) 64-69.

In Gaul, the Druids have their barbaricos ritus moremque sinistrum / sacrorum ("barbarian rites and baleful tradition of religious ceremonies," 1.450-51) and nemora alta remotis / incolitis lucis ("you [who practice these rites] inhabit high forests and remote groves," 1.453-54). The groves in Gaul and Massilia are hauntingly alike. But we mistake the likeness if we do not perceive the shadow of Diana and her grove at Nemi following all these allusions. "Scythian" is a common epithet for Diana of Aricia48 and reflects the barbarism of the goddess, shared in the shrines at Aricia where the rex nemorensis is killed, in Gaul where the altars and trees drip with human blood, in Aulis where, as Artemis, she demanded the sacrifice of Iphigenia and thus precipitated events leading to the Trojan War, and in Scythia where her demand for human sacrifice is central to the Iphigenia Taurica. The patron deity of Massilia was Artemis; the Romans knew-and were quite proud of-the close connection between their cult statue of Diana on the Aventine (brought in, as we have seen, from Aricia by Servius Tullius, according to Livy the last legitimate king at Rome) and the cult of Artemis among the Massiliotes.49 Thus this grove outside Massilia stands in much the same relation to the great cult of Artemis, established by the Phocaean settlers, as does the cult of Diana of Aricia to the cult of Diana on the Aventine.50 Indeed, the Massiliotes, like the Romans, were in 48. References in Ovid (Met. 14.331, 15.487-90), Strabo (5.3.12), Hygin. (Fab. 261), and Servius (ad Aen. 2.116 and 6.136) confirm that Diana at Aricia was known by the epithet "Scythian," which exemplified the aition that connected Diana at Aricia with Iphigenia and Orestes, in a variant on the tale found in Euripides' IT. The connection of Diana of Aricia with Artemis among the Taurians through Iphigenia is older than the late third or early second century B.C. A fragment from Book 3 of Cato's Origines provides our earliest evidence: Eo [the territory of the Aurunci] Orestem cum Iphigenia atque Pylade dicunt maternam necem expiatum venisse, et non longinqua memoria est, cum in arbore ensem viderunt quem Orestes abiens reliquisse dicitur (Peter HRF Cato fr. 71). It is not surprising that the custom of human sacrifice (the killing of the rex nemorensis) provided convincing evidence, as well as a most compelling need, for this epic-tragic etiology. "Barbarians," whether Roman or Scythian (Hdt. 4.103, on the Taurians' very similar claims for Iphigenia), could adorn their otherwise embarrassing tradition of human sacrifice with the most admired achievements of Hellenic civilization. That this was a process that began very early (Iphigenia and the Trojan cycle had been imported, assimilated and re-exported to Herodotus's informers before the last quarter of the fifth century, and the Scythians were no closer or better connected to the Greek world than the Etruscans in their Italian empire) is certain. After the fifth century, the wide-spread popularity of Euripides' plays in Italy, and plays in Latin based on Euripides' plots, would only have further enhanced the Arician legend and spread it among the general Latin public. 49. Strabo 4.1.4-5; cf. Gordon (supra, n. 17) 11. 50. The multiplicity of divinities associated with the grove outside Massilia does not contradict this view. For one thing, Diana has (as we have seen) multiple forms herself, as Diana Trivia, and as Diana, Hecate, and Luna. Beyond that, we now know that the cult of Diana at Aricia was accompanied by a multitude of lesser cults: Virbius, Hippolytus, Demeter and Persephone, Juno, and Isis were all represented there (Gordon, supra, n. 17, 13-17).</page><page sequence="18">220 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 the habit of using their cult as a tool of cultural imperialism, for Strabo notes (4.1.5) that not only did they establish in their colonies cults of Artemis identical to their own, but also they taught the Iberians the ancestral rites of Ephesian Artemis, so that they sacrificed according to Greek ritual.51 So Artemis/Diana-together with the intimate connection of cult imperialism, cult imitation, and cult syncretism-draws together Rome, Aricia, Massilia, and this nameless grove beyond the walls.52 When Caesar approaches the grove to cut down a tree, then, he is not approaching just any act of sacrilege, but an acting out of the specific sacrilege required of the challenger to the rex nemorensis. That he may complete the sacrilege without retribution is a sign that his challenge is acceptable to the goddess. In Book 1, he declared himself Rome's own soldier, able to protect her everywhere on earth: non te furialibus armis persequor: en, adsum victor terraque marique Caesar, ubique tuus (liceat modo, nunc quoque) miles. Ille erit ille nocens, qui me tibi fecerit hostem. 1.200-203 ... I do not attack you with frenzied warfare; behold me, victor on land and sea, Caesar, everywhere-were it allowed, even now-your soldier. He will be the one, he will do the harm, who makes me your enemy. 51. This culture of cult, which at once unites the Greek (or Roman) and the native population in agreement on the goddess, while separating them by the type of rite practiced, may have held even greater importance for Lucan, with his Spanish ancestry. Diana had been used to assure allegiance and loyalty to a Roman general. Sertorius employed a white fawn, which he claimed was a gift from Diana and a private oracle from the goddess to himself, to bind the Spaniards and Lusitanians to his cause (Plut. Sert. 11.3-12.1). Thus his barbarian followers were persuaded that they were being led not by a mortal, but by a goddess-Diana. Sertorius, his Roman government in exile, and his almost mystical leadership of the Spaniards and Lusitanians against the Romans, had surely left their mark on the family history of the Annaei, who were an important family at Cordova. Metellus had his winter headquarters there in his campaign against Sertorius. (Cf. P. Spann, Quintus Sertorius and the Legacy of Sulla [Fayetteville, 1987] 63 [doe]; 91 [Metellus's headquarters]; and also L. Sussman, The Elder Seneca [Leiden, 1978] 20-23 [on the continuing close connection of the Annaei to Spain] and 28-31 [on the complex loyalties of the Cordovans and the Annaei in particular to their Roman masters].) The value of religious syncretism, as Sertorius recognized, is that it validates the inherited religious knowledge of both sides by equating the one with the other; thus Lucan's familiarity with the power of the goddess Diana among his countrymen-and possibly with her cults in the groves-increases his sympathetic understanding of the goddess's legacy (and a similar legacy of other deities) among the Romans. It would be rather surprising if Lucan, Spaniard by birth, Roman augur by choice, did not have an interest in fundamental similarities between the "barbarians" and the Greeks and Romans, particularly in the realm of religious knowledge (cf. 1.453-54 where he assures the Druids/Dryades that solis nosse deos et caeli numina vobis / aut solis nescire datum). 52. In his discussion of the cult of Diana at Aricia, Alfoldi (supra, n. 17) 141 makes precisely the same point. "The Latins of that time [the dedication of the grove at Aricia at the end of the sixth century] had ideas on divinity rather similar to those held later by the Teutonic peoples of Tacitus (Germ. 9.3): ceterum nec cohibere parietibus deos neque in ullam humani oris speciem adsimulare ... arbitrantur: lucos ac nemora consecrant deorumque nominibus appellant secretum illud, quod sola reverentia vident." Cf. Caesar, B.G. 6.16, on the Gauls' belief in the importance of human sacrifice to appease the gods. We must not suppose the Romans themselves did not recognize certain similarities.</page><page sequence="19">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 221 His first command, that the wood must fall by the stroke of the blade (ferrum is equally the blade of a sword and of the axe) recalls, quite deliberately, the language of battle. The soldiers quail, unwilling to test the unknown gods53 within the grove. Caesar ... primus raptam librare bipennem ausus et aeriam ferro proscindere quercum effatur merso violata in robora telo: "iam ne quis vestrum dubitet subvertere silvam, credite me fecisse nefas." 3.433-37 ... he was the first who dared to seize and wield the two-headed axe and to slash the lofty oak with his steel; as his weapon sank into the profaned wood he said: "Let none of you now hesitate to topple the grove; be confident that I have committed the sacrilege." As is well recognized by now, the axe in the oak "is doubtlessly intended by the poet as an allusion to the initial comparisons of Pompey to an old oak at 1.136 and of Caesar to lightning at 1.151-57."5 Yet Lucan is after something far more important than just a bit of poetic craft. Of course the oak is Pompey. The priest-king and his tree are one. The cutting of the tree is not only the act of challenge to which there is no answer save mortal combat, but also symbolizes the fate of the loser. Caesar's great cry, be confident that I have committed the sacrilege, thus becomes more than just another random act of excess by one prepared to defy the gods as well as man. When he takes the axe to the oak, Caesar proclaims that he is the challenger; he is the soldier (tuus... miles) of the city and the gods of Rome. He must take responsibility for his crime, because it is only through that crime that he can attain his regnum. Lightning, the divine weapon against a tree, symbolizes the power and the will of both Caesar (1.151) and Jupiter (1.35; 3.315-20). Jupiter is represented, embodied, celebrated, in both lightning, which strikes the oak, and the oak that is struck. It is through the rite of the rex nemorensis that we can understand how Lucan dares to use the symbols of Jupiter for both combatants. This rite is a procession of paradoxes, which both begins and ends with a crime: the cutting of the tree, the killing of the priest. Once the essential rite has begun, the challenger is as sacer as the priest, and will become no less so for the crimes he must commit. Caesar and Pompey are both sacer, and their acts-the cutting of the tree, the shedding of blood (both in murdering and in dying), the winning of regnum-are also sacer. 53. It may seem that Lucan is denying the connection to the rex and Diana by not at least identifying the latter among the gods within this grove. But Lucan has distanced himself (at least in the extant part of the epic) from open characterization of the gods, whether Roman or not (cf. D. C. Feeney, The Gods in Epic [Oxford, 1991] 273-74). 54. Hunink (supra, n. 2) 181.</page><page sequence="20">222 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 The two similes of oak and lightning for the protagonists introduce the Roman pattern and the imagery of the ancient Latin rite into Lucan's epic. To identify Pompey as an oak is to identify him as a sacred tree: ...stat magni nominis umbra, qualis frugifero quercus sublimis in agro exuvias veteris populi sacrataque gestans dona ducum nec iam validis radicibus haerens pondere fixa suo est, nudosque per aera ramos effundens trunco, non frondibus, efficit umbram, et quamvis primo nutet casura sub Euro, tot circum silvae firmo se robore tollant, sola tamen colitur. 1.135-43 ... he stands, the shadow of a great name, like a lofty oak in an overgrown clearing,55 bedecked with the ancient armorial spoils of the people and the consecrated offerings of generals; holding on now not with vigorous roots, it stands fixed by its own weight, and sending forth denuded branches through the air, it casts a shadow, not with leaves, but with its trunk; and though it sways, about to fall beneath the first East wind, and round about so many trees with sound timber rise up, even so it alone is worshipped. But it is also essential to realize that the violation of the tree, the strike of lightning, the murder of Pompey, are equally sacred-and necessary-acts. Lightning is as sacred as the oak. Its swiftness, its violence, the destructiveness of its power, form part of its message from Jupiter to mortals. For lightning to strike the oak is to injure the oak: thus, the lightning inflicts sacra vulnera. The 55. The oak-tree is not standing in a cleared, tilled field (as most translators, following Duff, suggest), but is rather one that is being crowded by surrounding, younger and stronger, trees. The Latin frugifero ... in agro can, of course, be translated as "in a fruitful field," with all the implications of plowed fields and acres of waving grain. Ager is not limited in meaning to cultivated land, however, and though frugifer is more often limited to crop-growing as opposed to other kinds of fertility, later in the poem Lucan uses frugifer to describes Garganus, the mountainous promontory in Apulia, because it is thickly overgrown with oaks (5.378-80). It seems more likely to me, therefore, that in this passage we should understand that the massive oak had originally made its own natural clearing by choking out all competing vegetation; but as it has died back and lost its leaves, the surrounding forest has once more begun to close in around it. It is difficult to farm land in a clearing around a huge shade tree, hedged in by nearby forests; it becomes even more difficult if the tree is an object of constant worship ("bedecked with the ancient armorial spoils of the people and the consecrated offerings of generals") and liable, therefore, to attract a certain amount of trampling about, which is not good for the crops and makes a plowman's job harder. The tree that is Pompey should be seen as a once-magnificent oak in a grove of younger, lesser, trees. Pliny's account of Crispus Passienus's passion for a very old and great tree (NH 16.242, see supra) in a grove near Tusculum is again a useful reference for the reality of such tree-worship in Lucan's time by an individual of high social position and great public accomplishment.</page><page sequence="21">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 223 thing injured, the instrument of the injury, and the injuries themselves are all sacred. Pompey's death is the death of the protector of the oak-the oak which, as the terrible combat begins, is a shade of itself, ready to fall, but not fallen. The vulnerability of the oak reflects Pompey's role in the ritual of the war; his character and the moral value of his position are extraneous. The strike of lightning is the divine and fatal wound, which does not deny, but reaffirms, the oak's sacredness. Thus Pompey's death, if not at Caesar's hands, at least to fulfill Caesar's destiny, is a necessary murder-necessary to their sacred obligations as the sacrificial victim and the sacrificing priest. These wounds-the lightning or the axe striking the tree, the death of Pompey, the civil war that engulfs Rome-are all sacred wounds. They are all part of the Roman expiations that must, as Cato has said (2.304), be completed before the unmerciful gods are satisfied. Once we see this, the speech of the Massiliotes assumes its proper significance in the poem. The Massiliotes try to reason their way out of involvement in this terrible rite.-6 First they acknowledge their ancient ties to Rome (3.303-309); next they promise their aid in any external war (310-11). Then they address the heart of the matter: at, si funestas acies, si dira paratis proelia discordes, lacrimas civilibus armis secretumque damus. tractentur vulnera nulla sacra manu. 3.312-15 ... but, if you [Pompey and Caesar], at odds between yourselves, are preparing fatal battle-lines, dreadful battles, we offer tears for civil warfare and stand aside. The sacred wounds may not be touched by any hand. They will stand aside, for the sacred wounds-the blood sacrifice of civil war-must not be touched by any hand. The combat is between Caesar and Pompey, between their followers and their armies. These two (men, sides, armies) must fight to the death; outsiders may not interfere. The odd and perplexing phrase secretum damus (lit: we grant seclusion)-which the scholiast is surely right to gloss as secernimus nos a vobis (we separate ourselves from you)57-may well have actually 56. Lucan may be adapting parts of his grandfather's Histories for his purpose. The Elder Lucan wrote a history of the Wars from his recollection (and perhaps that of his elders) of events in Cordova (cf. Sussman [supra, n. 51] 145-49). At one point Cordova refused to open its gates to Pompeian forces under Varro (Caes. B.C. 2.19), just as Lucan makes the Massiliotes refuse Caesar. In 45 Caesar was besieging Ategua, a town near Cordova (Bell. Hisp. 4-6). Traces of his siege works are still visible from the air today. They must have been massive, and virtually intact in Lucan's time; perhaps they provided the historical kernel for the siege works Lucan invented for Massilia (cf. L. Curchin, Roman Spain: Conquest and Assimilation [London, 1991] 49 and n. 31). 57. See Hunink (supra, n. 2) 149 for a discussion of the scholarship, and the conclusion that the scholiast is correct.</page><page sequence="22">224 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 been part of the rite, an utterance made at the moment the combatants engaged, and the bystanders had to withdraw until one or the other was dead. In ritual combat, it is obvious, neither party could under any circumstances receive outside help. What the Massiliotes have not understood is that in every respect, whether as combatants or not, they still share a common destiny-communiafata-with the Romans: Rome is the caput mundi, the head of the world, and her fate is the fate of the civilized world, the imperium Romanum.58 The Massiliotes may not hold themselves apart from the war. Thus, Lucan neglects entirely to assign any cause to Caesar's assault on Massilia beyond the fundamental cause: the Civil War itself. Massilia, who shared a copy of her statue of Artemis with the Romans, is the first to demonstrate the universal nature of the Roman Civil War. The metaphor of the sacred wound, as the Massiliotes' speech would lead us to suspect, is paramount to the meaning of Book 3. The sacred wounds are the wounds to the divine tree, the murder of Pompey,59 the wounds suffered by all those who fight,60 and the wounds to the body politic. They are sacred in the most fundamental way, for the violator, no less than the violated, is set apart: both are sacer, both are part of a sacred rite. They form the metaphor with which Lucan shapes his epic view of the events of the Civil Wars. Though sacrilegious in the extreme, these wars were nevertheless necessary to the divine order (which had already made Rome mistress of the known world) and, therefore, sacred in their very horror. Now we can approach the naval battle, which, again, Lucan has created out of very meager historical material.6' After the act of sacrilege, after the sacred wounding, there is a struggle. The remarkable naumachia of Book 3 has a specific function: it is the inevitable consequence of sacrilege, but, as Caesar departs for Spain before it takes place, it is a substitute for the real struggle, a metaphor which foreshadows that struggle and conveys further just what Lucan, and the Massiliotes, mean when they speak of "sacred wounds." Within the naumachia, Lucan explores the meaning of the sacred wounds on three levels. First, there is the wounded and soon-to-be-wrecked ship of state, metaphorically implicit in the naval battle. Then there is the wounding of the body politic, sustained through the descriptions of the wounded bodies of men (3.570ff.). 58. A fundamental paradox of the epic is "inherent in the fact that Rome's internal war is ipso facto world war," J. W. Joyce, Time as an Emotive Factor in Lucan 's "Pharsalia " (Diss. Univ. of Texas at Austin, 1982) 23. 59. Who, it may be noted, when he sees the moment of slaughter is at hand, covers his head indignatus apertum / Fortunae praebere caput (8.614-15). Caesar did the same at the moment of his assassination (Suet. Div. Jul. 82.2). So did any Roman priest conducting a sacrifice. 60. Cf. Cato's speech: sic eat: immites Romana piacula divi / plena ferant, nullo fraudemus sanguine bellum (2.304-305). It is perhaps even more meaningful that he then begs, vainly: me solum invaditeferro (2.315). Cato believes that a single death can atone for the mores of the Romans-and he believes that atonement must be made. This surely reflects Lucan's view of the action within his epic. Cato takes the dead Pompey's place as champion of Rome. Cf. J. Long, "The Rhetorical Appropriation of Pompey," presented at the meeting of the APA, New Orleans, December 1992. 61. Caesar B.C. 1.36-37.</page><page sequence="23">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 225 Finally, the blood and wounds themselves become agents in the destruction. The sacra vulnera are the purest aspect of the bloody expiations of civil war. The half-dead fall into the sea and drown drinking their own blood (576-77). Javelins thrown haphazardly find bodies to wound in the water (580-82). Consider "daring Catus": ... terga simul pariter missis et pectora telis transigitur: medio concurrit corpore ferrum, et stetit incertus, flueret quo vulnere, sanguis, donec utrasque simul largus cruor expulit hastas divisitque animam sparsitque in vulnera letum. 3.587-91 ... he is pierced, through the back and the chest at the same time, by weapons launched together; the steel points meet in the middle of his body and the blood stops, unsure-from which wound should it flow?-until the bloody flood drives out both spears at once, and splits his soul and drenches his wounds with death. The blood of the double wound itself becomes almost a divine agent, overpowering the two weapons and dividing his soul in its drive to spread death on the gaping double wounds. One of two twin brothers, after losing first his right and then his left hand, dies protecting his twin-the whole is split and the pair (hands, twins) is sundered (603-26).62 Lycidas is rent in two, the upper half from the lower (635-46). And so forth. The concluding metaphors sum up the nature of the struggle (which, up to then, has been anceps, "of double meaning" as well as "undecided"). There is a victory, but the victors and the vanquished cannot be distinguished, either through their ships, or through the bodies of the dead themselves: ... Graiae pars maxima classis mergitur, ast aliae mutato remige puppes victores vexere suos; navalia paucae praecipiti tenuere fuga. quis in urbe parentum fletus erat! quanti matrum per litora planctus! coniunx saepe sui confusis vultibus unda credidit ora viri Romanum amplexa cadaver, accensisque rogis miseri de corpore trunco certavere patres. 3.753-59 ... the most part of the Greek fleet is sunk, but some ships with changed oarsmen carried their own conquerors; a few in headlong flight made it to the docks. What weeping of parents there was in the city! How many 62. Cf. Joyce (supra, n. 58) 18-19.</page><page sequence="24">226 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 lamentations of mothers along the shores! Often a wife believed the Roman corpse she embraced was her own husband with the features disfigured by the sea; and wretched fathers fought over headless bodies on funeral pyres already aflame. The metaphor of the damaged ship of state-one that in victory has the "wrong" crew in charge-is then transferred to the wounding of the body politic; the bodies are unrecognizable, and (defeated but living) Massiliote wives often embrace Romans (victorious but dead) by mistake. Worse, the wounds have severed the heads of the fighters from their bodies, and a further war is incited between fathers for possession of these headless corpses on burning pyres (760-61). Rome, in the throes of civil war, is a foundering ship. She is a body without a head, a body fought over by Senatorial fathers (Patres Conscripti), in blind desperation, unable to identify their sons among the slaughtered of both sides, while the funeral pyres for the Republic are already aflame. And it will be the dead body of Pompey, headless on another shore, abandoned by all, that will complete the first series of murders and make Caesar master of Rome, Rome, the caput mundi. Surely, now, we can see that, far from being an unexpected anticlimax, the concluding line and a half of Book 3 resonates with meaning: at Brutus in aequore victor /primus Caesareis pelagi decus addidit armis ("but Brutus, victorious at sea, was the first to confer the honor of a sea-battle to Caesar's arms" 761-62). Lucan thus names Decimus Brutus, the commander of the Roman navy. It was Decimus Brutus who, on the Ides of March, urged Caesar not to disappoint the meeting that had for some time been waiting for him and thus assured that the plot could go forward. Decimus Brutus and his brother Marcus were two of the assassins who inflicted the twenty-three stab wounds.63 But more than the particular man, it is the name that matters, for the name itself carries a monumental metaphorical burden. One Brutus drove out the kings from Rome: two more Bruti will in their turn add honor to this ancient struggle, by taking on their responsibility for yet another sacred wound when they kill Caesar. By preparing the way for Octavian, these new Bruti bring back the kings-as the Caesars. Through all this, the inability to see, to identify, to know for certain, is at the core of the dilemma, not just of the Massiliotes, but of the Romans, of all human beings. Thus the Massiliotes defend their refusal to choose sides; men would not dare even to aid Jupiter in the battle of the gods, they say, because humans cannot know what is meant to happen-which means they cannot know which side it is right to join: 63. Suet. Div. Iul. 81.4-82.2. There is a common misperception that D. Iunius Brutus was not a conspirator, although his brother Marcus was. Hunink's observations on the Bruti, excellent except for this oversight, are worth noting: ". .. the name of Caesar immediately follows the ambiguous 'Brutus.' This inevitably evokes the notion of the future murder of Caesar by M. Brutus" (ad loc., 761).</page><page sequence="25">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 227 non tamen auderet pietas humana vel armis vel votis prodesse Iovi, sortisque deorum ignarum mortale genus per fulmina tantum sciret adhuc caelo solum regnare Tonantem. 3.317-20 The piety of men would not, even so, dare to aid Jupiter either by arms or by prayers, and only by the lightning bolts would the human race, ignorant of the destinies of the gods, be aware that the Thunderer alone still reigned in heaven. Lucan first implicitly compared the Civil War with the battles of Gods and Giants in his proem, and he there equated the coming of Nero with the triumph of Jupiter in that battle (1.33-37). Since then Caesar has regularly been identified with the lightning that the Massiliotes claim will tell them Jupiter has won.64 Caesar is the lightning and makes his first petition to Rome's gods beginning with Jupiter Tonans (1.195-200); Augustus founded the temple to Jupiter Tonans;65 Nero is equated with Jupiter Tonans.6 When Lucan again describes the Civil War in terms of this conflict, we should pay attention to the connection between the two. If the Civil War resembles the battle of the Gods, and Nero's reign (described with-to us-repulsive flattery) is the result of the Civil War, then his reign must be equated to Jupiter's-a triumphant, but at the time unknowable, consequence of the upheaval and violation of the divine order. Lucan may have changed his mind, and at the end he may have seen Nero as one more in the series of sacrilegious Caesariani; but his support for Piso (Tac. Ann. 15.49ff.) does not in the least argue a romantic desire for a return to the ways of the Republic. If any trust at all is to be placed in Tacitus, then the conspiracy was designed to produce, not a refashioning of the failed Republic, but a princeps preferable to Nero: one who would justify the scelera and nefas that had so devastated Rome for a century or more. There is an undeniable emotive power that lies always with the defense of the Republic as exemplified by Cato; that is not sufficient reason to ignore the patent factuality (if one is going to believe in the gods at all) of the first half of that famous line: the victorious cause pleased the gods, the vanquished, Cato (1.28). The Republic-Rome defeated-was pleasing to Cato, but Rome herself-greater, always, than the man or men who ruled her-is the victrix causa. If Augustus was to found the New Rome, then the Old Rome must pass away. 64. Cf. Hunink ad loc. 319 and 320. 65. Cf. L.

The very neglect and the grayness of their rotting wood is what terrifies; men would not thus fear sacred powers rendered in familiar shapes: so much it adds to their terror, not to know the gods they fear. Similarly, the gods of his epic are unrecognizable, lacking vulgatae figurae familiar shapes. Since Feeney's recent study, it can no longer be argued that the gods are absent in Lucan's epic. It is the traditional characterization of them, the literary equivalent of anthropomorphic representation, that Lucan avoids, as Feeney so persuasively demonstrates.67 Here, at 3.413-17, Lucan has presented his justification for this-not that people no longer believed in the gods, nor that gods were inappropriate for a "historical" epic, but that he understood, as a poet, how the events of the Civil War became all the more terrifying because the victims could neither escape the slaughter, nor ascertain which side would own the victrix causa. There was no interpretation to be made, no omen or augury or prophecy which could guide humans through these horrifying disasters. Such disorder must seem contrary to divine order until the outcome demonstrates the new order: as the Massiliotes say, they must wait for signs (the thunderbolts) to know who won: "only by the lightning bolts would the human race, ignorant of the destinies of the gods, be aware that the Thunderer alone still reigned in heaven."68 67. Feeney (supra, n. 53) 274-303. 68. It is useful, in this context, to compare the attitude of a historian like Livy. Livy scarcely credits the foundation myths, but he does clearly believe that the very fact of winning is proof, in doubtful situations, of whom the gods approve, and to whom religious right belongs. The clearest statement of this attitude comes in the speech of Hanno to the Carthaginian senate (21.10) concerning the justification of both the first and the second Punic wars: vicerunt ergo di homines, et id de quo verbis ambigebatur, uter populus foedus rupisset, eventus belli velut aequus iudex unde ius stabat ei victoriam dedit (21.10.9). The civil war, too, was a matter de quo verbis ambigebatur; who had the right of it is fixed by who won. This may seem cynical; perhaps so, but it was an assumption central to Roman and Latin religion.</page><page sequence="27">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 229 The fact that Lucan's own designs for divine matters remain, apparently, even more impenetrable is, surely, due to the incompleteness of the poem: he has not been obscure in the work as we have it. He has already spoken clearly in Book 1: if there was no other way to bring about Nero's reign (and his eventual godhead: "nature will allow you to be whatever god you desire," 1.51-52), then not just civil war, but all its consequences, including the devastation of Italy, were not too high a price to pay-scelera ipsa nefasque / hac mercede placent ("these very crimes and sacrilege are welcome at this price," 1.37-38). Still, we do not have the outcome, and therefore lack a decisive statement of the poet's intentions. This offers ironic, if accidental, confirmation of everything Lucan says: until we know how it is supposed to end, the purpose of it all remains desperately confusing. As in the battle of the Gods, however, so in the rite of the rex nemorensis: humans are left ignorant of the outcome of the struggle instituted by Diana, whether that is the sacrifice of Iphigenia, or the battle between the rex nemorensis and his challenger. The goddess cannot signal her preferences,69 nor interfere in the struggle between challenger and priest; that the priest defends her, while the challenger commits a deep sacrilege against her, remains irrelevant to her divinity, which had itself created the rite of sacrilege, struggle, and murder. Only the outcome, not the nature, of the struggle determines who is Diana's true defender; thus, in several ways and at several levels, Lucan is telling us that the outcome, not the nature, of the struggle will determine who is to be Rome's true leader.7 There is one last section of Book 3, the catalogue of Pompey's troops, that now falls into place, not merely as a generic epic convention, but as a further realization of Lucan's specifically Roman epic. Now the apparently contradictory character of Pompey is resolved. His lack of vigor represents not Lucan's comment on the man's character, nor his judgment of the validity of the Republican cause, but his understanding of Pompey's position as the ruler about to be deposed by the vigorous young challenger. Pompey is the dying oak, the only one honored among the surrounding vigorous forest, bearing the honors of the people, and ready to be toppled. Like Servius Tullius, prope exsanguis ("almost white from fear," Livy 1.48.4) after he had been thrown out of the Curia by Tarquinius Superbus, Pompey is timorous-pavidus (3.96)-after Caesar threatens to make war on him. Like Servius, semianimis regio comitatu domum se reciperet ("only half conscious, with his royal escort he was retreating homeward" Livy 1.48.471), Pompey flees (3.1-45) and in the east gathers his "royal escort" (3.169-295). Lucan is at pains, in 69. She may indeed withdraw, as Lucan accuses the gods of doing just before Pharsalia: mortalia nulli / sunt curata deo (7.454-55). 70. We remember that Romulus's murder of Remus determined that he, and not Remus, had the true augury, and so was the divinely favored founder of Rome (Livy 1.7.1). 71. There is a textual problem at this point in the manuscripts, which has prompted an emendation removing the royal escort. On the crux, see the apparatus criticus, ad loc., of Ogilvie's OCT edition and</page><page sequence="28">230 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 Book 3, to maintain Pompey as leader of an army of kings ("never did so many kings obey a single leader," 3.287-88). But he will have lost the great royal company following him when he flees to Egypt. There, like Servius, Pompey will indeed die alone, with his head covered-at once priest and victim, a Roman sacrifice made to the merciless gods. CONCLUSION: "THE NECESSARY MURDER" Lucan created the relationship between Pompey and Caesar on the pattern of the relationship of Agamemnon and Achilles. Onto this powerful inherited epic form he grafted the paradigm which held a place of mythological honor for Romans as the story of Romulus and Remus, who fight to the death over the walls of Rome. For both poets and historians in the generations preceding Lucan, this myth of murderous combat initiated the historical process which they believed led Rome into the Civil Wars. Behind that myth was a Latin ritual whose traces could be discerned in the accepted histories of Rome's kings, and which was formalized and preserved from the earliest days as a religious rite in which the rex nemorensis, the priest of the goddess Diana in the grove near Aricia, fought to the death any challenger who could first cut off a bough of the sacred tree. In Book 3, Caesar crosses through the heart of Latium, and passes and masters (superare), among three other cults, the regna of Diana at Aricia. The rites of Arician Diana-the sacrilege of wounding the tree, the armed battle to the death, and the murder of the priest-king by his challenger-are Lucan's reminder to his readers of a religious and historical paradigm, rooted in Latin tradition and Roman culture, through which he is assimilating the Civil War to a rite that was undeniably Latin and Roman. It provided a pattern for a necessary sacrilege against the gods, a necessary struggle and a necessary murder, all leading to a conclusion in which the transgressor, the murderer, becomes the divinely appointed priest-kingprecisely because he was successful in his sacrilege and murder.72 The monstrous events Ogilvie's Commentary (supra, n. 4) ad loc. Ogilvie retains semianimis, and the escort; I accept his reading and the continuing presence of some sort of royal escort to Servius. 72. There is evidence that Caesar himself, ever sensitive to the force of myth and propaganda, saw the connection between Caesar, Pompey, the Civil War, and the rites of the rex nemorensis well before Lucan did. Cicero, in a letter to Atticus in the summer of 50 B.C., reports that Pompey was much irritated with Caesar for building a villa at Nemi, and that Pompey was inclined to hold Atticus responsible, since Caesar was using money loaned him by Pompey, money meant to be recovered through Atticus (Cic. adAtt. 6.1.25). We know from Suetonius that that villa was completed, but never lived in. According to Suetonius, who only sees in this act a piece of hyperaesthetic arrogance and financial recklessness, Caesar had the villa razed to the ground because he was displeased with some of the decorations (Div. Jul. 46). The villa was a project begun before war had become inevitable, as Cicero's letter makes clear. Caesar could not have returned to the environs of Rome between the summer of 50 B.C. and the morning he crossed the Rubicon at the beginning of the next year, so his first sight of the villa must post-date the Civil War. Even though Caesar could be a spendthrift, the razing of the villa suggests more than aesthetic distaste: it suggests a furious desire to eradicate.

Beyond that, the paradigm of the rex offers Lucan a perspective that is necessary for his epic: it becomes possible for him to cast the struggle between Pompey and Caesar as a struggle between individuals-not factions, not parties, not families; yet, even though it is acted out between individuals, it surpasses the limited nature of a merely personal political feud. Rendering the conflict in these terms permits Lucan to keep the specific, historical, and unpoetic causes of the war to one side (though it cannot be doubted that he understood them) and concentrate rather on the tragic processes through which history, as he saw it, worked.73 Caesar and Pompey thus retain their epic character, and are not contaminated by the limiting, trivializing nature of factional politics. The challenge, the fight, the murder and the triumph are all sacred acts, terrible, barbarous and violent though they may be. Their sum makes up the divinely appointed expiations owed to a dire goddess; it is through a crime that the victorious rex nemorensis obtains, as Orestes had done before him, purification for his crime. In particular, it is through the paradigm of the rex nemorensis that the relationship of the specific events of Book 3 can now be understood to make a related, dramatic, whole. Pompey's abandonment of Rome, which has ended Book 2, opens the way for Caesar's triumphal advance through Latium to Rome. In turn, because he is retreating, because he is in eclipse, because he is the dying oak, Pompey loses strength, conviction, and power as he goes. The royal panoply of kings and armies who are catalogued in forces supporting Pompey simultaneously calls attention to his diminishing personal powers, as the surrounding vigorous forest calls attention to the leafless oak, and, by contrast, cast him ever more vividly as a king, and a leader villa's proximity to the infamous rites, grisly and fascinating, offered some unpleasant propagandistic opportunities. Even if Caesar sold the house, his original ownership could not have been forgotten-and surely would not have been forgotten by his enemies, or by wits and writers of political broadsides. Again, perhaps by simple coincidence, Cicero's first meeting with Brutus the tyrannicide was going to be in a house at Nemi (Cic. ad Att. 15.4.5). Surely someone (not Cicero, of course, who had no attention to spare from politics for eerie allusions) saw (as Caesar did very quickly) that from the moment of his triumph the slayer became a marked man, and therefore moved that meeting away from Nemi. I would suggest that the story that Caesar had the villa at Nemi pulled down because he did not like the decorations was put out by Caesar himself. The villa had to be demolished; but, more importantly, a reason for its demolition had to be offered, a reason that would be believable to Caesar's detractors, yet the propaganda damage of which would remain politically negligible. The reason given by Suetonius satisfies both criteria. Hyperaesthetics, arrogance, and wastefulness were, of course, hardly characteristic of Romanitas at its best; but though faults, they were fine, aristocratic faults, shared by everyone involved in the Civil War, not excluding most of Caesar's enemies. In Caesar's calculations, an increased reputation for extravagance was not a bad price to pay to get rid of that villa near the grove where the rex was continually on watch against his challenger. Caligula, in a later and coarser age, felt no such sensitivity: tired of waiting for a challenger to appear, he sent one of his gladiators to take on the rex (Suet. Cal. 35). 73. Lucan reviews what might be termed the historical (rather than psychological) causes of the Civil War, beginning with an old favorite, too much wealth, and concluding with bribery in public elections and the kind of financial anarchy that made war so attractive to many (1.158-82).</page><page sequence="30">232 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 13/No. 2/October 1994 among kings; for this is his role-Pompey is Rome's dying priest-king, bedecked with the ancient honors of his people. He is the oak, Caesar is the lightning; both lightning and oak are symbols of the power of Jupiter-and of Rome-and it is the very nature of that power to destroy and renew itself.74 All this is the preparation for Caesar's great act of sacrilege, when he cuts down an oak in the sacred grove outside Massilia. He claims the crime, for it is only through the crime that he can approach and challenge the reigning priest-Pompey. In their speech to Caesar, the Massiliotes introduce the parallel of the battle of Gods and Giants, and argue that, as mere mortals, they cannot discern which side in the war is the right (religiously right, rather than morally right) side to join. They beg Caesar to allow them to stay neutral, for as outsiders they cannot choose between Caesar and Pompey, and may not touch the sacred wounds. Caesar's sacrilege is sacred; his purification is conditional upon the fulfillment of the sacrifice of the reigning priest, which is a sacred wounding. The imagery of the sacred wound overwhelms the end of Book 3. Caesar has cut the sacred tree; Pompey is weakening; blood must be shed. The Massiliotes discover that when Rome is convulsed in a civil war, the whole civilized world is drawn in; they are not outsiders after all. At that moment in the ritual when the combatants would first engage, Lucan brings Book 3 to a close with a sea-battle, wherein he works out all the terrible metaphors of civil war: man(kind) is torn in two; the ship (of state) is battered and no one knows which side has won command; the body (politic) is headless, and the fathers (of the country) are fighting over the dismembered and unrecognizable remnant. The gods are implacable and bloody, and the expiation they demand is a human sacrifice-those who will die in the war. Despite this, however, the fact of the Civil War and what it meant remains unchanged. Neither the failures that lead to Pompey's defeat nor Caesar's guilt in transgressing the laws of the Republic and murdering his fellow citizens is altered one whit by Lucan. It is a cold, unsentimental and even, seemingly, amoral view. It is perhaps the view of an artist who has himself been scarred by the lethal combat for regnum in the palace of the Caesars; one who has learned the devastations of the war and the horrors of those who dare not, who may not choose the "right" side, from his own grandfather's account of the war, and from the consciousness that his family had survived only because they were adept at trimming their sails to the prevailing Roman storm. It may be cynical, or it may be a young man's attempt to frame a justification for his own as well as for the imperial family-but it is not an unreligious (or irreligious) view. The gods of the Romans-particularly "Scythian" Diana-may be cruel and incomprehensible, but they are gods. Rome and her people are still the rulers on earth. This is part of the paradox of Lucan's creation: the war that seems to prove the gods' withdrawal is in fact the terrifying 74. This renewal is implicit in Lucan's prologue, and carried out, at least in part, by Caesar himself, when, on the site of Troy, he makes his vows to the di cinerum and asks that Rome and her walls might rise again (9.990-99).</page><page sequence="31">GREEN: "The Necessary Murder" 233 convulsion that renews the greatness of Rome. That this civil conflict is unbearably murderous, immoral, and against divine law, yet required by it, is a paradox that lies at the root of Lucan's view of the war and its leaders. The murder, the slaughter, the blood, are all necessary. Cato has spoken the truth. The war constitutes the expiations that the gods, without mercy, require. It may perhaps be helpful to turn, finally, to a poet in our own time, writing about another civil war:75 Today the inevitable increase in the chances of death; The conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder; Today the expending of powers On the flat ephemeral pamphlet and the boring meeting. The stars are dead; the animals will not look: We are left alone with our day, and the time is short and History to the defeated May say Alas but cannot help or pardon. Lucan-one of the young poets "exploding like bombs"76-has created in his epic the "conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder." When we consider his deep emotional attraction to Pompey, Cato, their cause, and the great Roman Republic, we must not mistake this for political partisanship. Rome herself commanded Lucan's deepest loyalty.

Auden, Spain 1937, originally published (London, 1937) as a pamphlet to raise money for Medical Aid in Spain. It inspired a famous attack by George Orwell ("Inside the Whale," reprinted in The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell I: An Age Like This [London and New York, 1968] 493-529): "But notice the phrase 'necessary murder.' It could only be written by a person to whom murder is at most a word" (516). Cf. H. Carpenter, W H. Auden: A Biography, (Boston, 1981) 217-19. Auden changed the line (cf. The English Auden: Poems, Essays and Dramatic Writings, 1927-1939, E. Mendelson, ed. [New York, 1977] 210-12) to "The conscious acceptance of guilt in the fact of murder," and so it has remained to this day. (Thus sanitized in sound, sense, and rhythm, the substitute line is, in my view, distinctly inferior.) We are separated from the Spanish Civil War by over half a century, yet the passions of former combatants-and their descendants-remain as strong now as they were then. Comparisons with the American Civil War are also suggestive. Lucan, writing almost exactly a century after the end of the Republic, was young-and a poet-in the first generation in which survivors of the civil wars, especially those who themselves fought in the wars, would no longer be in the audience. It is a salutary reminder of the explosive nature of the issues in a civil war, and of the deep passions that Lucan, in his time, was trying to confront. 76.
