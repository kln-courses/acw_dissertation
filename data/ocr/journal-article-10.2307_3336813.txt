Senufo art in its social and cultural contexts is the focus of catalogues written by Till F6rster to accompany a two-part exhibition mounted last year in Zurich by the Museum Rietberg in cooperation with the Museum fuir V61ker- kunde, Berlin. These works are based on F6rster's nearly three years of field research in northernC6te d'Ivoire and on his long as- sociation with the Museum Rietberg. Glanzend wie Gold demonstrates the art of brass casting and explores Senufo philosophy by examin- ing how brass figures help diviners interpret the meaning of events. Die Kunst der Senufo ties masks and sculptures to Senufo social structure, showing how they are used in vari- ous ritual and entertainment contexts. The following remarks pertain to the latter catalogue, which was organized by Lorenz Homberger and prefaced by Eberhard Fischer. F6rster begins by asserting the legitimacy of the rubric "Senufo art," arguing that the di- verse forms and styles are linked by an under- lying uniformity of expression. Paralleling this situation is the multiplicity of artisan and farmer groups creating and using this art who, despite their independent identities, share a "common social base." Senufo social and cultural identity is shaped through con- frontation with new ideas. The question for F6rster becomes this: How do peoples of such different ethnic backgrounds develop a coherent, distinctive artistic repertoire that consists of both indigenous and borrowed elements? He finds that a strictly historical in- quiry has limitations, for Senufo perceptions of what is of indigenous or foreign origin do not always coincide with actual events. Moreover, historical reconstructions do not adequately explain why particular objects and performances are adopted and others rejected. To discover their significance to the individual and society, F6rster proposes to examine art- istic expressions in the context of the Senufo world view. This approach, he suggests, will help to illuminate the processes through which the art develops. Looking within Senufo culture for criteria by which to classify artistic expressions, F6rster resists imposing formal groupings (face masks or standing figures, for example) that may obscure the social significance of particular objects. This is not immediately ob- vious from a brief glance at the photographs, however. F6rster also criticizes Anita Glaze's use of gender as an arbitrary classificatory tool (Art and Death in a Senufo Village, 1981). Glaze explains her emphasis as an attempt to bal- ance the literature, which underplays the powerful role of women in ritual and artistic spheres, including those associated with the Poro society (1981, pp. 46-50). In a later article ("Dialectics of Gender in Senufo Mas- querades," African Arts, vol. 19, no. 3, 1986), Glaze states more emphatically that the perspective of male-female duality in artistic expressions reflects Senufo philosophy. F6rster argues instead that gender is only one of the many factors that differentiate users from nonusers of art forms at any given time and place. His alternative perspective, described below, likewise must be carefully evaluated for its congruence with Senufo sys- tems of thought. The introductory chapter of the catalogue presents the dialectic of village versus wilder- ness as a collective metaphor expressing Senufo social and cultural identity. Vivid pas- sages demonstrate how the individual experi- 97</page><page sequence="2">ences the opposed concepts of village- wilderness, culture-nature, inside-outside, the known-the strange, the human-the nonhuman. In the end this symbolic structure breaks down in practice, as F6rster illus- trates with the example of the foreigner. In- deed, a fundamental characteristic of Senufo society is its ability to absorb and transform "outside" human beings and ideas. Conflict is inherent in the village-wilderness metaphor, since such dichotomies ultimately represent arbitrary divisions. It is art, says F6rster, that mediates the conflict by delineating boundaries when things are ambiguous or come into confrontation with one another. His theory encompasses old themes of art in limi- nality and rites of passage, but with a metaphorical twist. The relationship between age groups and the Poro society underlies the organization of the second chapter. Artistic traditions as- sociated with age groups, Poro, and lineages dramatize the boundaries of group, lineage, clan, village, farm, and wilderness, as well as the divisions between generations. Here Forster focuses on art forms that ease the transitions between the successive phases of life. He distinguishes between age-group ac- tivities undertaken prior to and after initiation into Poro, treating them in two separate sec- tions of the chapter. The first characterizes art- istic expressions of the uninitiated as being primarily for entertainment. They involve varying degrees of male and female participa- tion on a largely voluntary basis. The second section focuses mainly on the serious nature of artistic traditions that are tied to ritual tasks performed by Poro members, mostly males, during burial ceremonies. This is not to say that masks activated by Poro have no enter- taining aspects. For example, the amusing Yarajo mask is sometimes called "joker" or "prankster." However, its hidden ritual func- tion is to find out, using passwords, who can witness the secret part of burial ceremonies. Yarajo sees that burials proceed according to Poro custom. The discussion highlights the Senufo con- cept of the "work" of Poro as obligatory rituals that can be accomplished only by those in- itiated into the society. This "work" is differ- entiated from all other age-group functions that may involve artistic expressions. Forster illustrates the important point that the in- itiated also have masks whose functions lie outside the sphere of the "work" of Poro. For example, the term Kodal refers to a large cate- gory of masks that are not directly linked to ritual tasks. Kodal masks are used by both in- itiated and uninitiated age groups, although more so by the latter, and can be seen by women. Throughout the second chapter F6rster at- tempts to clarify the existing literature and ward off future confusion regarding the classi- fication of Senufo art. He emphasizes that "Poro" to the Senufo has multiple references: to the organization itself, to its secret and pub- lic forms of representation, and to its institu- tionalized actions. In the context of burials, Poro also refers to a particular mask that is charged with the ritual task of separating body and soul after death. This "head of Poro" combines diverse elements, especially ones from the sphere of wild animals. While quite similar in iconography to the "head of Poro," two zoomorphic helmet masks, Korobla and Wo, are shown to be in no way connected to the Poro system. The formal diversity of Kodal masks demonstrates that the Senufo emphasize purpose over appearance when categorizing these, if not all, artistic expres- sions. This discussion contributes signifi- cantly to our understanding of the forms, uses, and processes of change associated with the Kodal mask category. The Korobla, Wo, and Kodal examples underscore F6rster's commitment to seeking indigenous systems of classification of art. Concluding his treatment of several mask types of the age groups and Poro, F6rster re- states the idea that these creations shape the transitions between life's phases. They assist the individual in this period of uncertainty or liminality. Because the basic categories of the world are obscured when the individual must cross a boundary to the unknown, the masks combine ideas and definitions and accom- pany the person on the journey. In all the mask creations, F6rster suggests, seemingly disparate elements are combined so that bridges are formed between them, linking the familiar with the unfamiliar. Unfortunately he provides no such overarching purpose for Poro figurative sculptures, but he contributes to what little is known of the following types: the paired male and female figures called "children of Poro" or "rhythm pounders," the freestanding Sejen or bird figure, and the horse that the "master of the horse" carries to announce and later perform in the Ngoro dance celebrating the completion of Poro ap- prenticeship. The third chapter takes up the village- wilderness metaphor by focusing on repre- sentations of beings from the wild that enter into relationships with individuals and mediate between the human and nonhuman worlds. With this framework F6rster is able to consider a wide range of figures, shrines, and other material references to nonhuman powers. He treats each in as much depth as possible, given the relative lack of information available. Here again F6rster attempts to show how art forms delineate boundaries in situations where the familiar and the unfamil- iar confront one another. F6rster's main proposition is that, in this situation of conflict, anthropomorphic figures and other more formless spirit repre- sentations bring about recognition of the op- posite of one's self and group and thereby help to shape identity. The best example Forster gives of this is in the divinatory pro- cess, when tugubele spirits guide the diviner's hand to locate where the boundaries of the matrilineage have been violated by unau- thorized sexual relations. These spirits are represented in carved wood or cast metal as paired male and female figures and as rider figures. Forster notes that the general term, tugubele, becomes madebele (the term Glaze uses) when the spirits are referred to by someone who has a personal relationship with them. On the one hand, the linguistic point is well taken. On the other hand, the catalogue's discussion centers on the figures and shrines themselves, which are used and sacrificed to by those who have personal rela- tionships with the spirits so represented. Ambiguity in the usage of the term tugubele presents itself in the discussion of the figures that accompany the Nyingefolo shrine. F6rs- ter notes that tugubele refers to both the spirit beings themselves and their sculptural repre- sentations. In addition, the term for these spirits has become generic for all figurative images, a point made by Glaze and supported by my own research among the Djimini, a southern Senufo people ("Perception, Knowledge, and Divination in Djimini Soci- ety, Ivory Coast," Ph.D. dissertation, 1987). Paired anthropomorphic figures, called tugubele by the Senufo, are placed inside the house near the Nyingefolo shrine, a loam cone-like structure built to honor one's father, who is an outsider to the matrilineage. If the term tugubele is being used generically, then one possibility F6rster considers is that these figures associated with the lineage shrine are representations of ancestors. He concludes, however, without supporting data, that they represent tugubele spirits. Since Nyingefolo gives recognition to the opposite of one's own lineage affiliation, this interpretation sup- ports the theme of the chapter. It is in this third chapter that F6rster's theory of art and his perception of the Senufo world view are best articulated together. Iron- ically, it is here that the village-wilderness metaphor becomes somewhat problematical for me. When applied to the lineage, the metaphor would suggest that inside the lineage is the known and predictable, as op- posed to the unknown and unpredictable outside. However, as F6rster himself notes earlier with respect to the witch-catching Korobla mask, it is within the lineage itself that individuals work evil upon those they are supposed to support. Furthermore, on the societal level, overlapping memberships in age groups, lineages, and clans may, as F6rs- ter suggests, provide social balance, but they also establish conflicting loyalties that engen- der uncertainty as to how any one person may treat another. The relationships that the Senufo have with otherworldly entities are no more complex and confrontational than those they have among themselves. The spirit rep- resentations described here are created by in- dividuals to direct these nonhuman powers toward specific ends, one of the most impor- tant being to identify and solve problems within society that are rooted in human rela- tionships. To evaluate fairly how closely F6rster's views correspond to Senufo ideology, we need more exegesis of myths and symbols than can be presented in any one catalogue. Nevertheless it is clear that Die Kunst der Senufo makes a significant contribution to the understanding of a complex subject. The catalogue gives careful attention to regional 98</page><page sequence="3">differences and historical connections, and to the contexts in which specific art forms occur. The latter are particularly well portrayed in notably clear field photographs that are jux- taposed with photographs of museum ob- jects. Based on thorough research and thought-provoking theoretical perspectives, Die Kunst der Senufo goes far toward F6rster's goal of illuminating the processes by which Senufo art develops.
