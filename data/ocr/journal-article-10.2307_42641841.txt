In particular, the producers or affiliates of the mounds are unknown, as the traditions of the present inhabitants of the archaeo- logical region dissociate themselves from the mounds. Current excavations of the mounds have provided considerable contextual information, leading the excavation team to hypothesise that the mounds are best understood within a shrine context and that the figurines, possibly representing ancestors or other beings, were used in ceremonies aimed at communicating with the supernatural world for healing or other purposes.

Résumé Des interprétations diverses ont été fournies concernant le site d'un ensemble de monticules situé dans le territoire Koma, district de Mogduri, dans la Région Nord, au Ghana. On estime, entre autres, qu'il s'agit de monticules funéraires ou de sanctuaires. Les producteurs de ces monticules ou leurs associés sont surtout inconnus, puisque les traditions des habitants actuels de la région archéologique se désassocient des monticules. Les fouilles actuelles des monticules ont fourni des informations contextuelles considérables, permettant à l'équipe chargé des fouilles de proposer l'hypothèse selon laquelle les monticules sont mieux appréhendées dans le contexte d'un sanctuaire, alors que les figurines, représentant éventuellement les ancêtres ou d'autres créatures, étaient utilisées dans des cérémonies visant à communiquer avec le monde surnaturel afin d'obtenir une guérison ou parvenir à d'autres objectifs. Cet article fait état des connaissances actuelles relatives à ce site de monticules, surtout par rapport aux campagnes de fouille de 2010 et 2011, et compte tenu de l'ethnographie des groupes d'habitants dans la zone. Les futures pistes d'enquête éventuelle font également l'objet du débat suscité. Keywords Figurines • Koma Land • Northern Ghana • Religion • Ritual Introduction From the results of the preliminary... investigations... it became evident that we were confronted with a cultural complex, which appeared to be something of a novelty in Ghana. [I]t became evident that the tracing of the origins, associations and lineal descendants of this complex would pose a major problem... (Anquandah and van Ham 1985: 16) When Koma communities first settled in the Sisili-Kulpawn Basin in northern Ghana in the nineteenth century, they found the ruins of former settlements; digging into the mounds, when farming or mining earth for building, they unearthed a range of terracotta anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, which they call Kronkronbali - 'olden days children' (Anquandah 1987b; Dagan 1989). Archaeological investigations of some of these sites were first carried out in the mid-1980s when the sites were brought to the attention of the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board (GMMB) by residents of the Koma village of Yikpabongo. Surveys at that time by Dr. James Anquandah identified an area containing 27 Koma villages that were built on or in the vicinity of mounds (Anquandah 1987b). Subsequent excavations revealed a specific corpus of material culture associated with the mounds, including terracotta figurines, pottery, grinding stones, and human and animal remains. Since 2006, these sites have been revisited by a joint team from the University of Ghana and the GMMB, under the directorship of Dr. Benjamin Kankpeyeng (Kankpeyeng and Nkumbaan 2008). Preliminary investigations commenced in the Koma villages of Yikpabongo and Tando and have continued in subsequent years. Springer</page><page sequence="3">Afr Archaeol Rev (201 3) 30:475-499 477 This article presents the current understanding of these mound sites with particular reference to the 2010 and 2011 excavation seasons and discusses possible future avenues of theoretical and practical enquiry. Koma Land The region identified as containing archaeological remains associated with the Koma Land mound sites covers an area of approximately 100 km2 and spans the borders of three provincial regions of modern-day Ghana (Upper East, Upper West and Northern). The bulk of the mounds, however, lie in the Mogduri District of the Northern Region (see Fig. 1; Kankpeyeng and Nkumbaan 2008). This area is remote from the major centres in Ghana; located in the Northern Region, it is most easily reached by road from the Upper East Region. The colloquial name for the region is 'Overseas', designating its inaccessibility during the rainy season (July to August). The landscape of Koma Land is undulating with some low hills, and the economy is largely agricultural, villages in the area subsisting on the cultivation of millet, guinea corn, groundnuts, maize and cassava. A range of domestic animals are reared, such as sheep, goats, cattle, chicken and guinea fowl, although hunting is used to supplement the meat diet. In the past, local artisans provided iron and ceramic goods, but these crafts are no longer widespread (iron-smelting not at all, and ceramics at neighbouring non-Konni centres; Anquandah 1987b; Anquandah and van Ham 1985). The area is drained by the Sisili and Kulpawn rivers, with several streams that may run dry in the dry season (November to June). The broader area contains a diversity of ethno-linguistic groups, but the area in which the mounds are found is inhabited primarily by the Koma people, who speak a language known as Konni (Kroger and Saibu 2010). This language has affinities to Buli, spoken by the Bulsa people who occupy the region to the north of Koma Land (Anquandah 1987b; Kroger 1982). Other ethno-linguistic groups bordering on the Koma area include the Mamprusi (Rattray 1932) and the Isaia (Mendonsa 2001). It is unlikely, however, that any of these groups have a direct link to the makers of the mound sites as there are few correlations with the material culture and no present-day group uses terracotta figurines of the kind described here. Due to a variety of factors, this area has witnessed a number of population - and village - migrations due both to the arrival of the centralised Gonja and Mamprusi in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Drucker-Brown 1975; Saako 2009; Shinnie and Kense 1989; Wilks 1971) and the upheaval and insecurity associated with the slave trade in the nineteenth century (Der 1998; Perbi 2004). The occurrence of river blindness in the past may also have played a role in depopulating the region (Hunter 1967). Despite an increasing number of projects, the archaeology of northern Ghana (Northern, Upper West and Upper East Regions) is still patchy and the chronology ill-defined. Projects in the Upper West Region have tended to focus on the more recent historical period (Bredwa-Mensah 2004; Kankpeyeng 2003; Nkumbaan 2008; Swanepoel 2009, 2011; Merkyte, personal communication) or ethno-archaeology (Pole 1974, 1975). The Upper East Region has seen projects dealing with ethno- archaeology (Apentiik 1997; Gabrilopolous 1995; Mather 2003; Priddy 1974) and, more recently, the occupation and ritual practices in the Tong Hills shrine (Insoll 2009, Ô Springer</page><page sequence="4">478 Alt Archaeol Rev (2013) 30:475-499 Fig. 1 Map of northern Ghana showing the location of the study area (Map: C. Bruwer) 20 lie; Insoll et al 2013). To the south of Koma Land, research has been carried out in the Gambaga escarpment (Calvo et al 2013; Casey 1993; Kense 1992; Kense and Okoro 1993). In addition, University of Ghana students are beginning to work on a variety of other sites in the northern regions, both in Koma Land and elsewhere (for example, Kankpeyeng and Nkumbaan 2008; Saako 2009; Zakari 2010). At present, no other sites contemporaneous with the Koma Land remains have been investigated in the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">AfrArchaeol Rev (2013) 30:475-^99 479 adjacent areas, so it is not currently possible to build a comparison with other societies that may have existed in close proximity with the makers of the Koma Land terracottas. This research and other ongoing work in the region will thus play an important part in resolving questions about the chronology and identity of the Koma Land mound sites. The Archaeology of Koma Land Despite its evidently rich archaeological heritage, Koma Land has been the focus of only two sustained research efforts since the sites first came to the notice of the larger archaeological community: Anquandah's work in the 1980s, in collaboration with Laurent van Ham, and the efforts of the present research which are detailed here. Unfortunately, the figurines have been the focus of extensive looting, only a portion of which were intercepted at ports of entry and/or exit (Brent 1996). This looting was partially the result of the fact that the existing population does not have any ancestral links to these sites (Kankpeyeng and DeCorse 2004; Zakari 2010), but concerted educational and legal efforts by the GMMB have led to a decline in looting activity (Kankpeyeng and DeCorse 2004). Any figurines obtained or recovered as a result of looting are decontextualised and, thus, almost impossible to place within an interpretive framework (see Dagan 1989 for an example), heightening the importance of an archaeological research program. Previous Research Excavations in Koma Land first commenced in 1985 under James Anquandah (Anquandah 1986, 1987a, b; Anquandah and van Ham 1985). Anquandah designated the mounds as 'stone circle mounds' because excavations revealed that the mounds were composed of two archaeological horizons. A substructure that had been dug into the ground into which human remains and other artefacts, including terracotta figurines, had been deposited and an earth mound, added afterwards, that was "circumscribed at the top by a circle or ring of stones numbering between ten and fifty depending on the size of the mounds" (Anquandah 1987b: 173). The term 'stone circle mounds' is not used further because we have been unable to verify this observation. The number and distribution of sites recorded by this initial survey (which also drew on information obtained from hunters and elders) indicated the existence of a widespread population who shared similarities in their religious and/or ritual practices. The 1985 survey identified a total of 105 mounds, the largest over 35 m in diameter and the smallest (w= 94) between 4 and 10 m in diameter (Anquandah and van Ham 1985). At this stage, four mounds were excavated in the village of Yikpabongo, some of them in their entirety, with the purpose of testing whether or not these sites were burial sites similar to those found in Mali and the Senegambia (Anquandah 1987b; Kankpeyeng and Nkumbaan 2008). In addition to the figurines that have garnered so much attention, Anquandah's (1987b) excavations also yielded a large number of sherds of locally manufactured ceramics, grinding stones, iron bracelets, various utilitarian objects, both animal and human remains, as well as small numbers of beads (glass and stone) and cowrie shells (Insoll et al. 2012). These artefacts were recovered in great numbers. Anquandah notes Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">480 Afr Archaeol Rev (2013) 30:475-499 that from one small mound (Yikpabongo East) there were "5179 potsherds, 41 milling stones [and] 19 terracottas.... A large tomb" yielded "34,453 potsherds, 1786 milling stones, 258 terracottas, 77 pottery discs, 6 copper ornaments, [and] 8 iron orna- ments..." (Anquandah 1987b: 177). The discovery of human remains beneath some of mounds led Anquandah (1987b) to conclude that the sites were 'burial mounds', yet subsequent investigations have revealed that the mounds may not have functioned solely as primary burial contexts but also as sites of secondary burials accompanied by specific healing or other kinds of rituals (see below). Initial thermoluminescence dates obtained by Anquandah indicated that the sites dated to between ca. AD 1200 and 1800. Dates from the subsequent research project (see below) on organic material (radiocarbon) and ceramics (thermoluminescence) indicate an age range of between ca. AD 500 and 1100. Our understanding of the chronology has thus been revised, with the overall highpoint of Koma Land occupation placed between the sixth and twelfth centuries (Insoll et al 2012), possibly continuing after. Current Research After a 30-year hiatus, research was renewed in 2006 under the directorship of Dr. Benjamin Kankpeyeng with the assistance of Samuel Nkumbaan of the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Studies at the University of Ghana, who headed up the joint project between the University and the GMMB. International scholars with a research interest in northern Ghana have also joined the project for periods of time, including Prof. Timothy Insoll of the University of Manchester and Dr. Natalie Swanepoel of the University of South Africa. This second phase of research has been focused largely on obtaining a better understanding of how different kinds of material culture are distrib- uted within the mounds and to establish a firmer chronology for the mounds (Kankpeyeng and Nkumbaan 2008). To date, two mounds at Yikpabongo have been excavated as part of this latter project. During the 2010 and 201 1 field seasons, work focused on a low mound measuring approximately 18 m east-west and 15 m north-south, which was designated YK10-3 and later renamed YK1 1 . It will be referred to here as YK10-3/YK1 1 . This mound has been radiocarbon-dated to Cal AD 1010-1170 (970±40 BP; YK10-3-N-10-L2, Beta- 274104). Additional excavations were carried out at YK10/4 (a house mound) and a test unit was dug at a third low-lying mound, but it is the YK10-3/YK1 1 finds that will be discussed here. 2010/2011 Field Season Both the 2010 and 2011 excavations formed part of a University of Ghana archaeo- logical field school and took place in January during the university vacation. This is also, critically, the dry season in northern Ghana, which, whilst it means that the roads are more easily passable also means that the ground is extremely hard. This complicates the removal of artefacts without damage, particularly by inexperienced student exca- vators. As a result, students were instructed to moisten the soil in their excavation squares in the evening so that by the morning the water would have penetrated the ground and the soil could be loosened with trowels. £ļ Springer</page><page sequence="7">Afr Archaeol Rev (2013) 30:475-499 481 The choice of mounds to excavate was judgmental, made, in part, on the basis of surface material such as ceramic sherds and stones which indicated that they were similar to other mounds that contained artefacts of the time period of interest. A 10-m2 grid of 1 X 1-m units was established over the mound (further extended in 2011) and the surface was cleared of vegetation and modern trash. Twenty-seven units were randomly selected for excavation in 2010, chosen and spaced so as to sample a wide area of the mound whilst avoiding crowding by the students (see Fig. 2). As the aim of the research was partly to uncover the contextual arrange- ments that existed between different artefact types, both a vertical and horizontal approach was followed. When it became apparent that features extended beyond the lxl-m units, the excavated area would be extended to 2 x 1 or 2 x 2 m. This technique revealed features previously encountered in the excavation of another mound in the 2007-2009 seasons, namely, layers of ceramics and arrangements of figures with spherical upper grinding stones mixed with ceramic sherds. Ceramic discs were also found. All depth measurements were taken from the surface of the mound in the excavation units. The baulks remaining from 2010 were excavated in 2011 and additional, randomly selected units were excavated. Fig. 2 Mound YK10-3/YK1 1, units excavated in 2010 and 201 1 &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="8">482 Afr Archaeol Rev (2013) 30:475-499 The stratigraphy of YK10-3/YK11 is generally characterised by a surface layer of topsoil and modern rubbish (1-3 cm) overlying a stratum of artefactual material of varying widths, ending at a depth of between 20 and 30 cm below the mound's surface level. Below this is a 10-cm layer of sterile or near-sterile soil. This layer thinned out towards the edges of the mound. The subsoil deposits of red gravel were reached at a depth of between 40 and 50 cm below the surface (see Fig. 3). This stratigraphie profile is similar to that described by Anquandah (1987b). A range of artefacts are found in the artefact-rich layer, often arranged in association with one another. For example, rounded quartz upper grinders are usually recovered in the vicinity of large potsherds with an associated figurine (see Fig. 4). The material inventory is more generally composed of a mixture of local ceramic sherds, with some complete pots or pots broken in place, upper grinding stones, ceramic discs and figurines. Some small ceramic gourd objects and iron objects that have been twisted or 'knotted' have also been recovered. The bulk of the archaeological material was recovered from contexts up to 40 cm in depth below the mound surface. Material was rarely recovered from below this level (see Fig. 3). The concentration of artefacts was denser in the southeastern corner of the grid, and there was a general correlation between the clusters of large pottery sherds and the recovery of complete figurines, in further association with ceramic discs and upper grinding stones. In contrast, in units where the quantity of pottery was relatively small and the sherds fragmentary, the number of figurines recovered also tended to be small and the figurines incomplete. A possible libation structure was recovered from square 115. This clay structure was associated with a layer of arranged potsherds and an upper grinding stone. In the layer beneath this were figurines - a cone figurine, a chameleon and a head from a third figurine. Additional artefacts from this layer include an iron razor, ring, point and part of a bracelet. The clay structure was directly above the pointed cone figurine (Insoll et al. 2012).

This arrangement of human remains was uncovered at a depth of 25 cm in unit N10 and consisted of the remains of a human skull and a limb bone. The skull faced to the east and the limb bones were aligned along an approximately northwest/southeast axis. The bones were in a fragile state of conserva- tion, although the teeth had survived well. At least two of the teeth showed evidence of tooth filing on the upper right and upper left lateral incisors (Insoll et al 2012). South of this arrangement was a fragmented figurine that had been placed upright. Charcoal was recovered beneath the human remains. No remains or artefacts were recovered below a depth of 40 cm from the mound's surface. The mound was further excavated in 2011, at which time two important features were recorded. These were a possible libation structure in square 012 and a feature composed of potsherds and figurines in squares H13/H14/I13/I14 (Fig. 5). In square 0 12, three figurine fragments and a more complete cone figurine in association with an upper grinding stone were recovered from above what was possibly a libation structure - a low-fired clay (daub) feature arranged in a circular pattern interwoven with potsherds. These clay and potsherd structures may have formed a hole that would have created an 'opening' to the earth for the proffering of liquid offerings (see Insoll and Kankpeyeng, in press; Insoll et al. 2012). To the northwest of this feature was a single cow's tooth. The recurrence of cow teeth elsewhere in the deposit suggests that taphonomic considerations, i.e., survival rates, rather than ritual patterning, are the determining factor in this. The other significant feature was a large concentration of potsherds and figurines primarily recorded in squares H14 and 114 (Fig. 5). This was between 30- and 40-cm depth below the ground surface of the mound. Nine figurines, largely fragmentary, were present with spherical stone upper grinders, fragments of quartz, potsherds as noted, deliberately rounded potsherds and, to the north of the cluster, fragments of clay, Springer</page><page sequence="10">484 Afr Archaeol Rev (2013) 30:475-499 Fig. 5 Potsherd and figurine feature in squares H13/H14/I13/I14. The numbers each represent a figurine/ partial figurine the residue of a semicircular structure visible on the plans but less visible in the photographs. This was the largest intact feature recorded in the two seasons and is significant in, again, indicating that the mound essentially represents ritual actions bringing together or 'bundling' (Stahl 2010; Zedeño 2008) both quotidian and powerful materials over short time periods. Artefacts such as ceramics, common in daily life, become imbued with ritual significance when placed with or used alongside more overtly ritual objects such as figurines during the performance of ritual acts, highlight- ing the role that even everyday objects can play in memorialising activities (Gillespie 2010). The presence of this feature suggests that the mound as a whole represents the accumulation of the material remains of such single acts repeated over time. This would also explain the high concentration of figurine fragments in certain parts of the mound as opposed to others (Insoll et al. 2012). Beneath the main cluster, a second defined smaller cluster containing two further figurines was recorded. This also produced a small iron razor or knife that, considering the shrine context and possible medicinal implications of much of the material found (Kankpeyeng et al. 201 1), might have been used for scarification, circumcision/excision and surgical procedures (Insoll et al. 2012). The Figurines In all, a total of 251 figurines and figurine fragments were recovered during the 2010 and 2011 excavations of mound YK10-3/YK11. This total included 238 figurine fragments, 6 largely complete and 7 complete figurines. It is possible that at least some of these fragments conjoin. The majority of the figurines were modelled as single pieces of sculpture, but there is one figurine that displays evidence of a ball and socket joint at the leg (Insoll et al. 2012). â Springer</page><page sequence="11">Afr Archaeol Rev (201 3) 30:475^99 485 We recovered a range of different types of figurines. These can roughly be divided into human, animal, part human, part animal and what we term 'anthro- pomorphic cone' figures. The latter have stylized faces, lack limbs and end in a cone or point at the base. It is common for them to have a concave, 'bowl-like' impression at the top of the head or a modelled element representing either female genitalia or a cowry shell (cf. Insoll et al. 2012). Numerically, they dominate the assemblage with 44 fragments from shafts or bases, and a likely high proportion of the 43 head fragments recovered probably also belong to this group (Insoll et al. 2012; also see Dagan 1989). Figurines combining human and animal features were rare. These included a figurine with elements of human and fish characteristics and one with part of a wing that may be similar to a human bird figurine previously recorded. The only completely animal figurine, i.e., with no human features, was a chameleon. Insoll (2011b) has observed, based on Anquandah's data, that there is very little correlation between those animals represented in figurine form (primarily wild) and those represented in the excavated faunai assemblage (99.2 % domestic), underscoring the fact that the figurine representations perhaps relate to metaphorical links between humans and animals within the social and religious cosmology of the mound creators. The Koma Land figurines are not a unique artefact form within the larger West African context. When they were initially discovered, comparisons were drawn with the figurines recovered from Mali and other areas in the Niger River valley, such as Sao, Bankoni and Sokoto (Garlake 2002; Insoll 201 lc). Malian sites such as Jenne-jeno yielded figurines in contexts dating to between AD 1000 and 1300 (Mcintosh 1989; Stahl 1994). Stylistically, however, the Koma Land figurines are distinct from those found at Jenne-jeno (Garlake 2002; Kankpeyeng and DeCorse 2004), and contextually, they also differ - the Malian terracottas being found in house foundation contexts (Mcintosh 1989). Unfortunately, relatively few Malian terracottas have been recovered in context as they were heavily subjected to looting in the past. It has been postulated, however, that the terracottas assisted 'social cohesion and consensus-making' (Mcintosh et al. 1997), production peaking at the time when Islam was beginning to make an impact on religious life in the area. In this scenario, the figurines may have been a response - a solidification of local beliefs - to the arrival of the new religion or were the result of the stimulus provided by new syncretistic religious ideas (also see Insoll 2003). Based on Koma Land terracotta 'action' figurines that depict men on horseback and the presence of small quantities of trade artefacts such as cowrie shells and glass beads, along with an assumed date of the twelfth to eighteenth centuries AD, Anquandah (1987b) argued that the remains indicated the presence of a sophisticated, complex culture that had emerged as a result of the wealth generated by the trans-Saharan trade. Whilst the presence of trade goods indicates that these communities should not be regarded as isolated from the larger regional context (Insoll et al. 2012), the earliest dates for the mound sites predate the era of the trans-Saharan trade (which flourished from AD 1000 onwards), although they coincide with the settlement of what were to become the major urban centres of the western Sahel: Jenne-jeno, Gao and Koumbi Saleh (Insoll 2003). These mound sites also predate the establishment of the trading site of Begho, occupied between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries (Insoll 2003; Posnansky 1973; Stahl 1994). ô Springer</page><page sequence="12">486 Afr Archaeol Rev (2013) 30:475-499 Equally, it is not clear whether the abandonment of the Koma Land area was in any way related to larger regional conditions. As the current Konni-speaking residents acknowledge no direct links to the sites and only settled in the region just over a century ago (Zakari 2010), it would appear that the sites were abandoned along with the terracotta-making tradition as no similar sites are known in neighbouring areas. This depopulation may have been the result of a changing environment, disease or migration. Insoll et al (2012: 28) note that slave-raiding from the north (feeding into the slave markets of Timbuktu and Gao) may have increased insecurity and thus encouraged out- migration. This was certainly a factor in the depopulation and repopulation of areas of northern Ghana in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Der 1998; Hunter 1967). Discussion: Ritual Practices in a Religious Field It is clear that the figurines cannot be studied apart from the context of their use, display and/or their interaction with humans, processes that are embodied in the mounds from which they were retrieved. Furthermore, the meaning of the figurines should not necessarily be conflated with the ritual practice that led to their deposition (Walker 1999), and it is the latter, not the former, that gives greater insight into the social world in which they were formed (Mills and Ferguson 2008). Holistically speaking, they must be understood as part of an assemblage of both other material objects - potsherds, ceramic discs, spherical upper grinders - and the activities and practices that shaped their deposition (see Hamilton 1996; Marcus 1996). This emphasis on practice and on the objects as foci of action shifts the analysis away from putting a label on the type of religious activity practiced by the members of this society. Indeed, over such a long time period, it is difficult to state categorically what the activities that took place at the Koma mound sites meant to the people who participated in them. Whilst it is easy to classify these as being the result of 'religious activities', the exact nature of that religion presently escapes us. In addition, there is no reason to think that such practice was codified in such a way that it could be regarded as a religion in itself. As Goody (1972) noted with regard to the 'LoDagaa', "we find a range of institutionalised practices centring upon the communication between men and gods (widely interpreted); there is no religious system per sé ' (Goody 1972: 14). The same observation can be applied to ancestor veneration as a whole (Insoll 2011a). It is probably better to view the religious/spiritual beliefs that underpinned the deposition, formation and utilisation of the Koma mound sites and their contents as taking place in a 'religious field'. The term 'field' is here used in the same sense as Moore's (1973: 721) 'social field': "[i]t is well-established that between the body politic and the individual, there are interposed various smaller organised social fields to which the individual 'belongs'." Indeed, as is clear in the northern Ghanaian ethnographic context, any set of ritual practices may be embedded in the quotidian actions of countless individuals or groups who look to networks of different kinds of shrines for help to manage social and kin relations; help to resolve the uncertainties of life; success in hunting and other activities; healing; and facilitation of interaction with supernatural beings such as ancestors and/or gods sustained to a greater or lesser extent by religious/spiritual beliefs (see inter alia Allman and Parker 2005; Goody 1972; Insoll 2008, 2009, 201 le; Mather 2003; Mendonsa 1982). £) Springer</page><page sequence="13">Afr Archaeol Rev (201 3) 30:475-499 487 If the creation of the mound sites is viewed through the lens of practice as well as spiritual and religious beliefs, a number of analytical avenues and research questions are opened up. What do the archaeological remains of the activities that evidently took place at the time of their formation tell the archaeologist about the kinds of practices that individuals participated in and, potentially, their worldview? The type of remains associated with the mound sites - broken and whole figurines with evidence for some kind of offerings and/or the pouring of libations - intimate that these remains should be regarded as the result of some form of ritualised communicative practice, as is still commonly found in the area today amongst a number of ethnolinguistic groups, as discussed below. Despite the fact that human remains have been recovered from some of the mounds (Anquandah 1987b; Insoll et al. 2012), it is unlikely that their primary use was only as burial mounds. This was a theory stemming from Anquandah's work in the 1980s. In his interpretation of the mounds as burial mounds, he posited that the individual(s) would be buried and then the mourners or clan relations would discard kitchen equipment such as pots and food processing items including upper grind stones, together with terracotta figurines. As such, the figurines were seen as being represen- tative of clan ancestors, totems or deities. This deposit would then be covered by earth, at which time further artefacts would be deposited. This was ascribed to a ftmerary custom that would demand the destruction of these artefacts at the close of the burial ceremony (Anquandah 1986). As evidenced by the feature in squares H13/H14/I13/I14, however, different mounds may have undergone different formation processes. The mounds excavated by Anquandah in the 1980s containing burials may have been constructed as such from the start, whereas other mounds such as YK10-3/YK1 1 may have come into existence through the repeated performance of ritual action over time. Different mounds may have served different constituencies, whether clans, patrilineages or cultic groupings. Current explanations favoured by the excavation team are built around the under- standing that the mounds are best interpreted within a shrine context and that the figurines, possibly representing ancestors or other beings, were used in ceremonies that may have involved the pouring of libations. Residue analysis studies have not yet been undertaken, but the supposition that the figurines, particularly the cone figurines, may have had a liquid substance poured over them is strongly suggested by the fact that the figurines were apparently designed to stand upright and have concave heads. In addition, many of the figurines have cavities pierced into their mouths, ears, nostrils or tops of the head that may have allowed the insertion of substances. Equally, such piercings could be representative of the figurine's ability to see, hear or speak (see discussion in Insoll et al. 2012). Such libations or preparations, followed by the destruction of figurines, pots and the discard of grinding stones may have occurred during healing ceremonies (Kankpeyeng et al. 2011; also see Dagan 1989). A focus on practice also raises the issue of the nature of objects used on such occasions, including whether or not they should be viewed as animate, in the sense of possessing their own agency (but not necessarily intentionality; see Brown and Walker 2008; Mills and Ferguson 2008; VanPool and VanPool 2012; Walker 2008). As Brown and Walker (2008) have argued, archaeological evidence for non-human agency often manifests in contexts that are the results of repetitive ritual activity as the objects become the focus or means by which communication takes place between realms (also &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="14">488 Afř Archacol Rev (2013) 30:475-499 see Zedeño 2008) brought into being by ritual performance (Pollard 2008). As will be argued below, however, whilst the figurines, in concert with other objects, may have been animated with non-human (or in the case of ancestors, superhuman) agency, their destruction and/or discard and subsequent deposition indicate that this animation may have been temporary, for the length of the communicative act, before being discarded and ultimately replaced at the time of the next such ritual. This is not to say that their deposition curtailed the agency of the supernatural forces they embodied as their role was more likely as conduit rather than container, allowing the continued interaction between the human and the other-world (Nielsen 2008). The repeated fragmentation of both figurines and pots has led some members of the excavation team (Insoll et al. 2012) to posit that the process of fragmentation might have been a deliberate act at the completion of rituals and could represent a mechanism whereby the living were 'enchained' to either deceased ancestors or other beings represented by the figurines (Chapman 2000; Lucero 2008). As articulated by Chapman (2000: 6), 'enchainment through fragmentation' occurs when an object is broken and divided amongst parties (including the newly dead) as a way of signifying their continuing relationship. He further argues that such fragmentation applies not only to objects but also to human skeletal remains. The fragmentation of pots and figurines in the Koma Land sites should be seen in conjunction with what can be regarded as the 'fragmentation' of human remains, a process that saw the deposition of only certain bones of the body (skulls, long bones, teeth) in some of the mounds (Insoll et al. 2012). It is likely that such destruction occurred at the completion of such rituals; even today, it is common practice amongst some groups in northern Ghana for the friends and relatives of the deceased to break pots at the grave or the place where the body is laid out, for example in the Birifoh area in the Upper West Region (Saako 2009). Amongst the Gurensi (Upper East Region), a woman's pots are broken at a crossroads as part of the final funeral rites (Smith 1989). The breaking of the pots symbolizes the separation of the woman from her family, but the sherds themselves renew that connection, often being ground down and used to temper the clay for new pots. As noted by Insoll et al. (2012), figurine pieces recovered from the mounds represent only a portion of what the original figurine would have consisted of, and possibly some pieces were reserved in order to be reused in this or other ways. Whilst it is not possible nor desirable to draw a one-to-one correlation between those who created the mound sites and modern-day ethno-linguistic groups, modern-day and historical practices in the northern reaches of Ghana provide us with insights into the kind of worldview that may have shaped ritual practice at these sites. Ancestors and Memories Present-day northern Ghana is dominated by speakers of languages within the Gur or Voltaic language family (Stahl 1994). The history of settlement in the region is characterised by the movement of small groups into different areas (Kuba and Lentz 2002; Lentz and Sturm 2001) analogous to the process described by KopytofFs (1987) 'internal frontier' concept. The modern-day ethno-linguistic groupings thus must be regarded as having come into being through specific contextual, historical circum- stances rather than having existed sui generis (Lentz 2006). Most recently in the nineteenth century and probably before, slave-raiding and other conflict also impacted â Springer</page><page sequence="15">Afr Archaeol Rev (201 3) 30:475-499 489 settlement histories and the dispersion of populations (Goody 1993; Swanepoel 2005, 2009). The linguistic affinities between groups are to some extent mirrored by certain cultural affinities. For instance, the institution of an earth priest, who is responsible for the distribution of land and the care of the earth shrines, is found among all groups of the Voltaic language family (Lentz 1994; Skinner 1964). In addition to these ideolog- ical and ritual similarities, there are also similarities in subsistence, craft and political organisation (Cardinall 1921; Manoukian 1951; Prussin 1969; Rattray 1931, 1932). It should be stressed, however, that these cultural affinities are generalized. The area is marked by a mosaic of linguistic and cultural differences that coincide only in certain arenas. These differences can be seen both in ritual customs and in more material aspects of culture such as settlement pattern and organisation (Prussin 1969; Tait 1953). Even within subgroups of groups, there are differences of dialect and myths of origin (Grindal 1972; Rattray 1932; Tait 1953). What does appear to be a common ritual motif, however, is a continuing relationship with ancestral spirits, an aspect of which may be manifested in material objects and shrines. The role of ancestors in African life and belief systems has long been a topic of interest to African ethnographers. In many African societies, indeed globally (Malone et al. 2007), deceased family members are seen as continuing to play a role in the life of the family and the community. This relationship is not always necessarily benevolent as sickness and misfortune may be interpreted as arising from the dissatisfaction of the ancestors with the conduct of the living. Ancestors may thus be appealed to, through the mechanism of sacrifice, for the purposes of both appeasement and requests for intercession with the supernatural world (Insoll 2011a; Kopytoff 1971). The elevation of a departed individual to the status of ancestor is not, however, automatic. In general terms, ancestors only come into being if their descendant kin continue to remember them and sacrifice to them at the appointed place(s). In many societies throughout modern-day northern Ghana, there are a series of what can be described as 'rites of incorporation' that must be enacted in order to turn the wandering soul of the deceased into an ancestor (Mendonsa 1975). A man can only become an ancestor if he has male offspring who will continue to sacrifice to him and curate his shrine (Mendonsa 1976). As noted above, it is a common feature in the religious philosophy and ritual practice of many of the ethno-linguistic groups in northern Ghana that an aspect of the ancestral spirit/guardian spirit should be invested in a material object/artefact/shrine, this often being the end point of the funeral or incorporation rites. The placement of these material signifiers often echoes existing social and kin relationships, as well as serving to reinforce a continuing relationship with ancestral spirits (Goody 1972; Mather 2009). Such an association must be contextually demonstrated as it is not an absolute feature in societies that have ancestors (Insoll 201 la), and it is important to note that these objects are not a materialisation of the spirit of the deceased but rather a focal point for the wandering spirit to return to, that is, an attachment or abode for the spirit (Stahl 2008). As stated above, they may have been conduits for, not containers of, ancestral spirits. The manifestation of these relationships can take a variety of forms. The Bulsa, for example, curate and make sacrifices to ancestor wen stones. The wen stone is not the repository of the body or soul of the ancestral person, but is rather a stone which houses a divine spirit or being which the ancestor received during childhood and to which he made sacrifices during the course of his lifetime. When the individual dies, the stone is Springer</page><page sequence="16">490 Air Archacol Rev (20 1 3) 30:475^*99 incorporated into a clay mound with other ancestral wen stones and the eldest son and his descendants continue to provide it with food offerings (Kroger 1982). A similar practice occurs amongst the Kusasi (Mather 2009). In the Tale area of the Upper East Region, these connections are embodied in a network of shrines (Insoll 2009; Insoll et al. 2013), and amongst the Sisala in the Upper West Region, the lele or ancestor shrines are indicated by the deposition of metal anklets worn by individuals during their lifetimes and seen as representing their soul. These bracelets are deposited on the shrine after a series of rituals (Mendonsa 1975, 1976). Communities included in Goody's 'LoDagaa' grouping also invest their ancestors with material shape - in the form of an ancestral stick roughly carved into a human shape and given his name. The shrine in which the stick is embedded takes shape over a period of time during which a number of funeral rites are held (Goody 1972). Saako (2009) noted both wooden and terracotta figurines whilst surveying in the Birifoh region. Similar figurines are found amongst the Lobi proper in southwestern Burkina Faso, except there the human characteristics of the figures are more apparent and well defined (Bognolo 1993, 2007; Dagan 1989). These figures are all kept in an 'ancestral room' (Saako 2009). As to the other kinds of beings possibly depicted in the figurines, there are also numerous references to supernatural creatures found in groups throughout northern Ghana. Amongst the Bulsa, there are the jodoksa (supernatural beings which appear as animals; Kroger 1982). The Kusasi may create chameleon shrines as the result of an encounter with a kinkiriis ('a spirit of the wild who does not have a home'). Such an encounter usually takes the form of coming across a pair of chameleons mating in the bush (Mather 2009). Goody (1972) noted that 'beings of the wild' are central to the myth of the Bagre amongst the 'LoDagaa' and that these are often portrayed in sculptural form - 'dwarf-like' creatures in male and female pairs (Goody 1972, fig. 3). There are numerous animals that play a role in Bagre ceremonies, including fruit bats, cats, flies, the guinea fowl, other birds and the large frog (Goody 1972). Whilst it is questionable that the Koma Land figurines embodied ancestors as they are understood today (see discussion in Insoll et al. 2012), this brief overview of ethnographic practice brings several issues to the fore that might shape our thinking about the use of figurines in rituals at the Koma Land sites. First, that whilst ancestral (and presumably other) spirits are mobile, it is common in this area that they have an object or structure which ties them to the material realm and which draws their spirit near (cf. Insoll 2008). Second, the survival of an ancestral spirit is dependent on the continued actions of propitiation and sacrifice by lineal descendants. Ancestors thus only exist as long as they are retained in the corporate memory of their lineage. Third, death does not automatically result in the status of an ancestor being conferred on the deceased. Rather, a series of 'rituals of incorporation' are necessary in order to turn the spirit of the dead from a potential danger into an ancestor who can confer protection on the lineage (also see Nielsen 2008). The last two of these features centre around the importance of communication between the material and the spiritual worlds; the first is the mechanism that facilitates such communication. All of them highlight the centrality of repeated, ritualised practice in terms of transforming individual memory into the corporate, social memory that will outlive the individuals engaged in such practice (Gillespie 2010; Mills and Walker 2008). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">Afr Archaeol Rev (201 3) 30:475^199 491 The mound sites and the figurines they contain do, however, differ in substantial ways from present-day ancestor shrines and ancestor veneration practices in that there is little or no evidence for the curation of objects to facilitate ongoing communication. This could indicate that the purpose of the shrine was not solely to venerate and communicate with ancestral or other beings, but rather that they had a more specific focus. This should not be surprising. The dense shrine geography that exists throughout northern Ghana is characterised by a great deal of regional variation, and the interaction with such shrines is embedded in daily practice. Shrines may be associated with rituals to supreme deities or take the form of land shrines, clan shrines, personal destiny shrines, shrines to grant requests, protective shrines and so on. Drawing on a survey conducted with 153 compound heads amongst the Kusasi, Mather (2009) identified a total of 1,600 shrines that could be divided into 100 types, which could be further divided into five groups. Distinguishing between such an array of shrines represents something of a problem archaeologically. What is of further interest is that the Koma Land mounds are not associated with any specific, permanent landscape features. This may indicate that non-human/superhuman agency did not reside in those specific places but were positioned there by the process of repeated ritual performance in the same location, possibly being aligned to other domestic or environmental features on the landscape not currently visible to us (Lucero 2008), such as large trees. If we are to place the mound sites broadly within the contexts of shrines, be it for healing, ancestor 'veneration' or intercession with a god or gods (Kankpeyeng et al. 2011), the principal feature appears to be that of the need for continued and continual communication between individuals on this plane and another. The figurines may thus be best described as objects used to channel the presence of such beings for the period of the communicative act, after which they could be destroyed or discarded. The destruction or discard of such objects does not imply the destruction of the memory of the being for which they were created; as Küchler 's (1997) discussion of the malangan demonstrates (see below), the act of creation for the purposes of destruction can, in itself, represent a memorialising act (Chapman and Gaydarska 2007; Insoll et al. 2012) as it is the practice associated with such activities that serves to recreate social memory on the part of the participants (Gillespie 2010). The existence of a number of identifiable types or templates of figurines (the most basic division being between 'cone' and other figurines) illustrates that their producers had set ideas of what was being represented. Differences between figurines from different areas should shed light on memorialising practices in individual communities. Future Avenues of Research The ideas described above represent just one potential research direction into the archaeology of the Koma Land mound sites. Other potential questions and current and future avenues of research are iterated below. Social, Political and Economic Contexts The lack of contextual information from habitation and settlement areas associated with the Koma Land mound sites has always hampered a full interpretation (Kankpeyeng Springer</page><page sequence="18">492 Afr Archaeol Rev (2013) 30:475-499 and DeCorse 2004). Generally, it can be observed that the archaeological remains indicate that the society had an agricultural base, as attested by the presence of pottery, grinding stones and the remains of domesticated cattle, sheep and fowl. The society could also support full- or part-time specialists to produce metal and the figurines (Insoll et al. 2012). Beyond this, however, not much is known about the society's social or political organisation, the relationships between communities or the possible role that the figurines and ritual activities played. This lacuna is now being addressed by the realisation that the mounds in this area represent two different types: house mounds and, for want of a better term, 'figurine mounds'. House mounds tend to be larger than the figurine mounds and may include burials beneath floor levels (Kankpeyeng et al. 2011), as exemplified by the house mound excavated during the 2010 season (YK10/4). This excavation revealed house floors and a large in situ water pot. A human burial, covered by large pieces of ceramic, was excavated, indicating that human remains may have been buried beneath floors as a norm rather than in the mounds (Asamoah-Mensah 201 2: 1 35). Grave goods included iron anklets. The corpus of evidence from the house mounds currently indicates that the ritual practices associated with the burial contexts differed in form and content from those visible in the figurine mounds. The ceramics found in the mound sites and the house mounds are, however, similar, and all ceramics, including the figurines, are low- fired. This burial has been dated to (Beta-271050) Cal AD 540-650 (Asamoah-Mensah 2012: 165). Similarly, a burial at Tando-Fagusa 24 km southeast also contained grave goods, namely, twisted brass and glass beads around the neck and bracelets around the arms. This was in addition to ten other burials recorded at two house mounds at the same site (Kankpeyeng et al. 2011). Five of the burials, which were exposed to examine their orientation, show no specific form in terms of the cardinal directions. Whilst some had the heads pointing east-west, others pointed to south-north. However, the orientation as to whether they laid on the right or left hand determined the sex, as evident also in the ethnographic information from northern Ghana. A burial laid on the right and left hands would face east and west, respectively, indicating male and female, with the philosophy that sunrise (east) prompts the man to get to work and sunset (west) prompts the woman to get home and make dinner before nightfall. The study of such house mounds and a comparative study of burials might shed light on the social and political structure of the society concerned. Importantly, the recovery of figurines in contexts other than figurine mounds may shed light either on the object biography of such finds or the possibility that they served multiple purposes, as has been noted for figurines elsewhere in the world (see, for example, Halperin et al. 2009; Joyce 2008; Talalay 1987). Importantly, such analysis should not be confined merely to objects and their life histories but should also be directed towards uncovering the 'genealogy of practice' and, by extension the performance, within which they were implicated (Mills and Walker 2008: 12; Pollard 2008). Chronological Change The review of the ethnography given above indicates how time- and context-dependent certain ritual behaviours are. This suggests that a fine-grained study of different mounds at different sites, even a revisiting of Anquandah's excavation material, may shed light â Springer</page><page sequence="19">Afr Archaeol Rev (201 3) 30:475-499 493 on intra- and inter-community differences as well as change over time. The chronology provided by absolute dating may not be fine-grained enough to tease apart these differences, but the presence or absence of certain time-dependent artefacts such as cowrie shells, in association with changes in the type and subject of terracottas, may provide an avenue for this kind of research. Already, there are noticeable differences between the Tando and Yikpabongo sites (Kankpeyeng et al. 2011), and further comparative work by Samuel Nkumbaan at the University of Ghana is underway. Similarly, differences in the type and nature of figurines between mounds and between communities may shed light on possible associations that different parts of communi- ties had with different kinds of creatures based on metaphorical concepts and relation- ships akin to 'totemism' (Insoll 2011b). Such research is also underway. Ritual Production As is evident from the number of figurines from excavations and those that have appeared on the illegal market, the production of such figurines must have played a role in the economic and productive life of those who made them, beyond their use in ritual activities. This boils down to the question, what work was required on the part of community members in order to effect the rituals in which they were involved (Spielmann 2002; also see Joyce 2009; Mills 2004; Pauketat and Alt 2004)? The large numbers of figurines and their variety raise the question of who made them and what was their standing within communities. Were the figurines, for example, produced by the same craftspeople (possibly women; Berns 1993) who made the more utilitarian ceramics also recovered from these sites? Importantly, these artefacts were created ostensibly with the intention that they be destroyed, discarded or permanently deposited after their primary use. Even if we might regard their deposition not as discard, but as a removal from circulation in a way specifically designed to further control any influence or power such objects may continue to have, there is no indication that they were interacted with after they were deposited, unless through the action of libation structures. This differs markedly from the northern Ghanaian ethnographic contexts described above, where figurines or other artefacts are created or acquired to be preserved and tended to over time. The concepts of fragmentation and enchainment have been discussed above (also see Chapman and Gaydarska 2007; Mills and Walker 2008), but such destruction of ritual objects could also be regarded as a form of object sacrifice (Insoll 201 Id; Insoll et al 2013; Küchler 1998; Pollard 2008), either as a way of removing now potentially dangerous objects from circulation (Mills 2008), initiating a new phase in the object's life span (Lucero 2008) or as a means of achieving what Küchler (1997: 41) describes as the 'alienation' of an image object. With regard to the malangan of Melanesia - wooden sculptures destroyed or, increasingly, sold after their use in funerary rituals - she makes the point that images are inherently reproducible, even after the object has been disposed of. Thus, malangan figures can be recreated every year, and it is the knowledge of what the representation should look like and the right to reproduce the image that gives power and status to its creator (Küchler 1998). She argues that this is the way in which memory is created and in which sites of commemoration are formed (Küchler 1997). Similarly, Lopiparo and Hendon (2009) have argued, with reference to Honduran figurines, that the meaning of such objects and the relationships between human and Ô Springer</page><page sequence="20">494 Air Archacol Rev (2013) 30:475^*99 non-human actors that they signify are produced through the practices that they entail. These practices may rely on secret or 'hidden' knowledge, the possession of which confers group membership. Whilst many of the Koma Land statues display individual features, it is also possible to discern that there were specific types of images repre- sented, possibly modelled on mental templates (Rowlands 1993), which may have had specific contextual meanings to members of that society. Were the artists who produced these able to use their own initiative in modifying such designs, or were they held to a strict code as to what such figures should look like (see Morris 2009)? A full typology of excavated figurines is in the process of being drawn up by Kankpeyeng and currently contains more than 40 forms; this may shed light on some of these issues. Dagan's (1989) typology distinguished between three different styles of head: conical, with eyes and nose applied to the basic shape; a more detailed, rougher second style where the face is often distorted; and, third, a more refined, naturalistic style. She dismissed a functional explanation for these differences, positing instead that they may have represented different artists, villages or patrilineal clans, or that this was a function of time. As Dagan's typology is based on looted figurines, it is not possible to further resolve these points for that collection. It should be noted that other kinds of artefacts too represent an investment of labour, subsequently discarded, notably the spherical upper grinding stones. Similarly, pots were deliberately broken, presumably before the end of their functional household use-life. Thus, the issue of the production of objects for disposal in such ritual contexts, against the discovery of such objects in more quotidian contexts, would be a worth- while avenue of investigation. Conclusion Whilst the Koma Land terracotta figurines still represent something of a mystery, current excavation and research efforts are adding to our understanding about the chronology of the sites, the placement of figurines within the mounds and the associ- ated material culture in house mounds, as well as figurine materiality and conceptual function. Detailed comparisons between material from different sites such as Yikpabongo and Tando-Fagusa will further illuminate possible social and chronological differences within the population. It is still an open question as to what happened to the people and practices evidenced at the Koma Land mound sites. As previously stated, no existing group utilises the same practices, although at least some of the rites associated with ancestors and other supernatural beings may be derived from these or similar practices. If it has been demonstrated that there are no exact ethnographic correlates with modem-day populations, it has also been shown that, broadly speaking, it is possible to use some elements of current-day ethnography to gain at least some insight into the worldview that may have shaped the ritual practices of those who used the site. It has also been shown that the current research only scratches the surface of the questions that could be asked of these sites and the people who created them. The lack of contextual data for the mound sites and figurines remains a problem, but it is only with renewed archaeological research, such as that now ongoing both in Koma Land and elsewhere in northern Ghana, that we can hope to further understand ritual practice at the Koma Land mound sites. â Springer</page><page sequence="21">Afr Archaeol Rev (201 3) 30:475-499 495 Acknowledgments Funding for the 2010 and 2011 seasons of ficldwork was principally provided by University of Ghana.
