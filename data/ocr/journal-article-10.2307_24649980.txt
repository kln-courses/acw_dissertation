<plain_text><page sequence="1">Waiden in the Bohemian Forest: Adalbert Stifter's Transcendental Ecocentrism in Der Hochwald] Sean Ireton University of Missouri In the fall of 1841, Adalbert Stifter published the first version of Der Hochwald and soon thereafter reissued the tale, with only minor changes, in the second volume of his Studien from 1844. One year later, on the other side of the Atlantic, Henry David Thoreau began his experiment in living at Waiden Pond, though his celebrated account of this venture (undertaken from July 1845 to September 1847) did not appear until 1854. Waiden remains a curious mix of personal chronicle, natural history, philosophical rumination, and cultural critique. Stifter, who at this early point in his writing career finds himself between Romanticism and realism, weaves a similar host of diverse strands into his text. He reminisces on sojourns through his native Bohemian Forest, depicts its biodiversity with a trained empirical eye, philosophizes about the divinity of nature, and critiques the destructive bents of modern civilization. Numerous other parallels exist between Waiden and Der Hochwald, which, to reiterate, were both conceived during the same decade of the nineteenth century. Their key commonality, however, concerns a body of water around which their respective structure, narrative, and greater thematic of ecological holism revolve. Since this article is set within a modem Austrian forum, I will devote more attention to Stifter than to Thoreau, though, in the end, I seek to align the former author with a cross-cultural strain of Naturphilosophie that fuses philosophical speculation with positivistic observation. Put in alternative terms, I aim to initiate a transcontinental dialogue between these two contemporaries, one that contextualizes them in the discourse of ecocriticism. Against the historical background of environmental literature, Waiden marks a crucial transition from Anglo-European Romanticism to Humboldtian/Darwinian scientism. Correspondingly, Der Hochwald represents an important step in Stifter's tum from a romantic sensibility toward nature to a realistic attitude rooted in the objective perception of physical data. Both works blend these different perspectives such that pantheistic rapture and empirico-scientific analysis compatibly operate toward a common goal: the comprehension of nature in its wholeness. Many nineteenth-century writers and philosophers concerned with nature adopted a holistic view, which is to say that they endeavored to apprehend the organic totality of the natural world. But as Laura Dassow Walls observes, beyond Modern Austrian Literature, Vol. 43, No. 3. © 2010 Modern Austrian Literature and Culture Association.</page><page sequence="2">Sean Ireton the conventional (and perhaps somewhat clichéd) opposition of organicism versus mechanism, a competing dualism held sway. She labels these dichotomous outlooks "rational holism" and "empirical holism." The former mindset conceives nature as a divine or otherwise transcendent unity that can best be grasped through contemplative thought. Schelling, Coleridge, Emerson, and the early Thoreau (the idealistic author of A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers) are prime representatives of this tradition (60-70). In "empirical holism," on the other hand, the whole can only be understood by closely examining its constituent parts and their interconnections. There is no assumption of, and often no allowance for, a transcendent agency. Empirical naturalists include Humboldt, Darwin, and the Thoreau of the later Journals (84-93). Walls argues that Waiden remains a transitional work in Thoreau's development, one that neatly combines rational and empirical holism. This is also the view of leading Thoreau scholars such as Richard J. Schneider and William Rossi. The former, for instance, claims that "Thoreau's interest in scientific approaches to nature [...] merged with rather than replaced his transcendental approach" (Thoreau 148). The latter dubs this dual orientation "transcendental ecocentrism," a term that equally applies to Stifter's hybrid conception of nature in Der Hochwald—and one that I have borrowed for the title of this article. Immersed in the flora and fauna of the phenomenal world, Stifter and Thoreau simultaneously worship nature as a divine entity that rises above their respective local ecologies. And each of these biotic communities, whether the forested mountains of Bohemia or the lowland woods of New England, shelters a lake that serves as a model of environmental integrity and further offers the promise of religious transcendence. Der Plöckensee (in Stifter's antiquated spelling "Blockensee") lies in the Bohemian Forest near the so-called Dreiländereck of Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. Like Waiden Pond, which in surface area technically qualifies as a lake,2 Plöckensee is an actual geographic feature that has experienced the steady advance of civilization. Today both regions are officially protected, Waiden by the state of Massachusetts and Plöckensee by the Nationalpark Böhmerwald (Czech: Nàrodni Park Sumava), which, together with the neighboring Nationalpark Bayerischer Wald, comprises the largest forested biosphere in central Europe. While the main plotline of Der Hochwald takes place during the Thirty Years War, hence before the age of industrialization, the nineteenth-century narrator of the story's frame frequently alludes to the environmental degradation that has occurred over the past centuries. Land cultivation, human settlement, and resource exploitation have eaten away at the woodlands so that only the upper montane zone—"der Hochwald" invoked in the title—remains in its original wilderness state. Even within the storyline itself, the aged Gregor notices a difference in human impact compared to the period of his youth: "da waren noch größere und schönere Wälder als jetzt.—Holzschläge waren gar nicht zu sehen, diese traurigen Baumkirchhöfe [...]" (Hochwald263). Thoreau, for his part, wrote Waiden after the local woods had been logged and the wetlands drained. Much as Stifter lived</page><page sequence="3">Walden in the Bohemian Forest during the most intense period of logging within the Bohemian Forest (see Brande 62-63), Thoreau composed his own ecological manifesto during "the historic low point of forest coverage in Concord" (Sattelmeyer, "Depopulation" 241). He presciently anticipates the threat of further development, or in his own words, "[t]he ornamented grounds of villas which will one day be built here" ( Walden 180). But, like Gregor, he also nostalgically recalls earlier and more ecologically intact times: "When I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was completely surrounded by thick and lofty pine and oak woods [...]. But since I left those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste [...]" ( Walden 191-92). Despite the fact that these two primitive landscapes suffered major deforest ation during the mid-nineteenth century, they still serve as examples of fully functioning ecosystems. To a certain degree, these bioregions are more sound today than back then; because they now enjoy governmental protection, a number of harmful outside influences have been reduced. Logging, damming, and such seemingly innocuous enterprises as ice harvesting (which Thoreau subtly criticizes in his chapter "The Pond in Winter") no longer pose a threat to these natural habitats. It is interesting to note that the Bavarian/Bohemian Forest has in many respects benefited environmentally from the geopolitical effects of the Cold War. Since the Iron Curtain ran along the crest of this mountain range, access was limited and nature found itself better able to recover from long-term abuse. Wildlife therefore made a comeback, and thanks to its designation in 1970 as Germany's first national park (the Czech side became federally protected in 1991), the area now boasts a sizeable population of endangered species such as the lynx, peregrine falcon, and Eurasian otter. As for Walden Pond, although it has long endured pressures such as suburban sprawl, commercial development, and tourist visitation, the forest that rings its shores is more mature and arguably more healthy today than when Thoreau conducted his back-to-nature enterprise over a century and a half ago (see Maynard, esp. 301-34; Sattelmeyer, "Depopulation"). Beyond these analogies concerning regional ecology, the two lakes become poeticized in virtually identical terms, as the following juxtaposition of quotes demonstrates: Oft entstieg mir ein und derselbe Gedanke, wenn ich an diesen Gestaden saß: —als sei es ein unheimlich Naturauge, das mich hier ansehe—tief schwarz—überragt von der Stirne und Braue der Felsen, gesäumt von der Wimper dunkler Tannen—drinn das Wasser regungslos, wie eine versteinerte Thräne. (Hochwald 214) A lake is the landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature. The fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender eyelashes which fringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its overhanging brows. ( Walden 186)</page><page sequence="4">Sean Ireton Stifter and Thoreau thus draw comparisons between human and geological features, whereby the lake is equated with an eye, the surrounding trees with eyelashes, and the adjacent cliffs with eyebrows. While this parallelism can only be regarded as coincidental since there is no evidence that Thoreau had ever read Stifter (despite a fairly sustained exposure to German literature since his days at Harvard College),3 the image of an eye and the general act of seeing prove essential for the broader conception of nature in each text.4 Thoreau was well aware that a forested landscape is best viewed from the center of a lake. Such a medial vantage allows a comprehensive view of one's environs and makes nature appear more interconnected. As Thoreau, for instance, remarks: The forest has never so good a setting, nor is so distinctly beautiful, as when seen from the middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the water's edge [...]. There Nature has woven a natural selvage, and the eye rises by just gradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highest trees. There are few traces of man's hand to be seen. The water laves the shore as it did a thousand years ago. ( Waiden 185-86) In order to experience this sense of holism, Thoreau regularly rows his boat out onto Waiden Pond or wanders across its frozen surface during the winter months. He thus becomes a kind of "eye" himself, taking in his environment as that which literally surrounds him (an etymological connection perhaps more evident in the German Umwelt und Umgebung) and striving for a more complete picture of the whole. In the words of his fellow transcendentalist Emerson, Thoreau seeks to achieve the state of a "transparent eyeball," whereby he is able to discern "the currents of the Universal Being" and come to the realization that "I am part or parcel of God" (Emerson, "Nature" 6). This correlation between the physical eye and the idealistic notion of a supreme deity is further elaborated in Emerson's essay "Circles." Here he charts a three-stage progression through the realms of the human, natural, and spiritual. The human eye, an anatomical orb, constitutes the initial point of apprehension in our dealings with the world. In its visioning activity, the eye takes in ever broader globular horizons of nature until it eventually discerns the ultimate reality of God "as a circle whose centre was everywhere and its circumference nowhere" (279). Herein lies the core of transcendentalism: departing from our own physiologically based perception, we can attain, "with religious eye looking upward" (289), higher levels of insight and existence. Starting from the limited parameters of our own subjectivity, we gradually move onward and upward: from the manifold phenomena around us, to nature as a universal idea, to the overarching and all-instantiating concept of God. According to Laura Dassow Walls, this notion of an all-perceiving "imperial eye" is typical of rational holism (13), which privileges the human mind or spirit as the prime organizing law in relation to physical nature. In Der Hochwald,</page><page sequence="5">Waiden in the Bohemian Forest this imperial eye becomes even more empowered, indeed imperious. The image quoted above—"ein unheimlich Naturauge" {Hochwald 214)—forms part of an intricate motif complex involving vision and supervision. Stifter descriptively dwells on the "Augen" of Johanna, Gregor, and Heinrich von Wittinghausen, each of whom is in some fashion responsible for "keeping an eye on" the young— though probably no longer sexually innocent—Clarissa. In the case of the father and his longtime friend Gregor, the connection to the anthropomorphized lake and its immediate surroundings seems especially conspicuous. The patriarch's eye is described as "stark gewölbt und sprechend unter einer felsigen, gefurchten Stirne" (224); Gregor for his part displays "zwei große treuherzige Augen [...], in ihrer Schwärze seltsam abstechend gegen die zwei schneeweißen Bogen, die sich über ihnen spannten" (238). Eric Downing has shown how the father's "scopic concern" imposes an order on the natural realm that shelters the sisters from the invading Swedish army (59). But Heinrich is just as apprehensive about the virginity of his daughter Clarissa, and by sending her to a cabin in the "virgin" mountain forest (the text is replete with metaphors involving "Jungfräulichkeit"), he hopes to protect her from suitors like Ronald. His "vast surveillance network" (Downing 58) includes Gregor's vigilance, the communicative conduit of the telescope, and the natural body of water that constitutes their very refuge. The link between this geophysical landmark and the father's center of control is initially suggested by the lake's surface appearance as "eine versteinerte Thräne" (214) and the castle as a place where the sisters will soon shed "ein Thränlein" (230) upon their departure. At the end of the tale, after their home has been gutted by fire, "das geschmolzene Glas" that hangs down like "schmutziges Eis" (310) reinforces this correspondence. Abasie "Blickstruktur" (Geulen 97) thus underlies the text, one that not only interlinks the diverse characters but also intermediates between the domains of nature and civilization. The distance separating lake and castle is minimized by the telescope, which the sisters regularly utilize atop the Plöckenstein in an effort to assess the situation back home. This optical instrument connects the timeless mountain forest with the historical events unfolding below. In the hands of Johanna and Clarissa, the telescope becomes a key symbol that points to the essential tension between human history and the permanence of nature. Stifter never fully resolves this tension in the course of Der Hochwald. He appears to vacillate between two irreconcilable extremes as reflected in the conflicting narrative practices of describing versus inscribing nature. Stifter is, of course, well known for his vivid and meticulous Naturbeschreibung, and here he certainly does not disappoint in capturing the botanical diversity, mineralogical formations, meteorological changes, and deeper biorhythms of the titular "mountain forest." His narrative objectivity is, however, seriously compromised by a persistent semanticization of nature, especially of the lake and its surrounding woods. Stifter, that is, projects meaning onto the natural world by anthropomorphizing phenomena that he elsewhere represents in a more detached</page><page sequence="6">Sean Ireton and realistic mode. As numerous critics have noted (e.g., Begemann, Downing, Mautz, Preisendanz, Reddick), Der Hochwald is riddled with ambivalent, if not polyvalent, evocations of nature, which Stifter injects with a surfeit of metaphors drawn from the province of human affairs. Even Thoreau, the godfather of American nature writing, is not immune to this anthropocentric predisposition. Indeed, as suggested by the above-cited passage involving eyes, lashes, and brows, he employs many of the same images as his Austrian contemporary. Both authors generally rely on tropes pertaining to corporality, architecture, and apparel. Some examples of this mutual technique deserve mention. The surface of Waiden Pond is likened to dimples, a bosom, and "the heaving of [a] breast" (188); its shoreline to lips and a beard (181). Other metaphors of the lake and its banks include a belt of stones (178), an amphitheater (191), glass (186, 187), and a mirror (188). In Stifter, one finds similar, though far more numerous, inscriptions of nature. His initial depiction of the Plöckensee locale offers a copious enough sampling. In a single paragraph one finds "Tuch," "Säule," "Felsentheater," "Wand," "Granitgiebel," and "Dach" (213). Other examples from the first few pages include "Todtenbett[-]," "Schädel," "Gerippe" (212); "Glasspiegel" (213); "Versammlungssaal," "Waldrücken," "Waldesbusen," and "Silbergürtel" (214). A final noteworthy parallel concerns the sporadic ripples in Waiden's otherwise placid surface, a simile that brings to mind the "versteinerte Träne"/"geschmolzenes Glas" association mentioned earlier: "It is like molten glass cooled but not congealed, and the few motes in it are pure and beautiful like the imperfections in glass" (187). The upshot of all these references is that Stifter and, to a certain extent, Thoreau cannot escape the very anthropomorphizing tendencies that they denounce in their idealizations of nature. Stifter's early summation of the forest's ecological condition basically says it all: "Keine Spur von Menschenhand, jungfräuliches Schweigen" (213). Whereas the first part of this statement invokes a purely natural state of being, the second undermines this notion, impressing anthropological qualities upon what has allegedly remained untouched by humans. This equivocal attitude toward the status of nature is expressed in a longer and more revealing quote: [...] denn es liegt ein Anstand, ich möchte sagen ein Ausdruck von Tugend in dem von Menschenhänden noch nicht berührten Antlitze der Natur, dem sich die Seele beugen muß, als etwas Keuschem und Göttlichem, —und doch ist es zuletzt wieder die Seele allein, die all ihre innere Große hinaus in das Gleichniß der Natur legt. (241) Here Stifter addresses a central problem concerning the relations between human subjectivity and the material world: which side of the subject/object or human/nature divide is most affected by the other? As Christian Begemann asserts, "der Text [vollzieht] eine ständige Doppc/bewegung," one that never attains</page><page sequence="7">Walden in the Bohemian Forest a final resolution or synthesis (190). This bind seems symptomatic of Stifter's still transitional place between Romanticism and realism. Indeed, Begemann has characterized the aesthetics of Der Hochwald as "romantische Entromantisierung" (164), arguing that Stifter proves unable to overcome his Romantic heritage, despite a concerted attempt to demystify nature through an empirical orientation. Downing similarly notes the heterogeneous character of Der Hochwald, which he finds "a very uneven work, fundamentally flawed in design and uneasily combining elements of the Romantic fairy tale and the incipient realist novella" (41). The question of literary history aside, one cannot fail to discern a continuous oscillation between the spheres of nature and humanity, with the consequence that "nature is humanised, humans are so to speak 'naturised'" (Reddick 59). This oscillation stems in part from Stifter's wavering aesthetic stance and resultant confusion between, if not conflation of, two ontologically separate realities. But it must also be seen as an inevitable corollary of the subject-object interdependence that Stifter knowingly thematizes throughout the text. Before entering into a more detailed discussion of this interplay between the human and natural worlds, it is worth considering Thoreau's ideal of reciprocity. As he declares early on in Walden: "Nature and human life are as various as our several constitutions. [...] Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant?" (10). In the chapter "Brute Neighbors," he pursues this conjecture, focusing on the wildlife around him (mice, ants, and various species of birds) and striving for insight into a foreign mode of being. In his journals, one finds more extreme examples of this intimacy with nature. With regard to a muskrat, he writes: "While I am looking at him I am thinking what he is thinking of me. He is a different sort of man, that is all" {Journal 3: 151). Thoreau even finds himself able to commune with a non-sentient raindrop: "To watch this crystal globe just sent from heaven to associate with me [...] we two draw nearer and know one another" {Journal 1: 120-21). Though never quite reaching such quasi-mystical moments of reciprocal existence, Stifter's tale is nevertheless full of communicative situations in which human beings find themselves one step closer to the natural world. While Johanna and Clarissa take up residence at the cabin from early summer to late fall, they experience nature firsthand. They physically participate in the landscape, regularly climbing the mountain that towers above the lake. They witness the change of seasons and weather: the warm days of Nachsommer, autumnal mist, hoarfrost, the first snowfall. They observe up-close the regional plant life, often receiving instruction from Gregor about the natural history of the region. And they gradually find themselves becoming ever more attuned to the rhythm of nature, which for its part responds to their interest. The multitudinous sounds of the forest are initially unintelligible, yet they are like "ein Erzählen" (254) and thus may have something to communicate. An unfamiliar species of bird makes the first attempt at establishing contact: "ein fremdartiger Vogel schritt</page><page sequence="8">8 Sean Ireton auf seinem Aste mit dem Kopfe blödsinnig nickend wie zum Einverständnisse mit dem Hinaufschauenden" (254). Here Stifter refers to a generic (masculine singular) onlooker, but the interaction with nature soon becomes concretized in the case of Johanna. One morning by the edge of the lake she confronts a stag, and each creature takes an important step toward breaking down the barriers between their respective worlds: "Verwundert, betroffen und wohlgefällig sah sie auf das edle Thier, das seinerseits auch mit den unbeweglichen neugierigen Augen herüberglotzte auf das neue Wunderwerk der Wildniß, auf die weiße in der Morgenluft schwebende Gestalt und ihre bannenden Augen [...]" (254). The pivotal moment of reciprocation, however, occurs shortly after this encounter. Thanks to the mediation of Gregor, the sisters begin to sense that their new environment "auch ihnen zu reden begann, und sie sich immer wie inmitten eines Märchens zu schweben schienen" (259). At this point Stifter reverses the perspective and writes with key emphasis: "Aber vielmehr sie waren ein Märchen für die ringsum staunende Wildniß" (259). Despite the strong Romantic overtones of this entire section of the text (compare the subsequent references to runes, elves, and magic), Stifter still presents an epistemological inversion that carries its own ecocritical weight. By the end of the tale, Johanna and Clarissa have become completely integrated into the—or better yet, their—forested environs. As the following citation demonstrates, they have embraced the wilderness to such a degree that it has become part of their own identity: "Noch einen traurigen Blick thaten sie über Weite und Breite ihrer herbstlichen Wildniß, und dann verließen sie den Gipfel ihres vielgeliebten Felsens mit Gefühlen, so ganz anders, als sie sonst immer herabgestiegen waren [...]" (308; my emphasis). Yet this roughly half-year period spent in the heart of the forest remains a brief idyll and elusive ideal. The conclusion of Der Hochwald suggests a fundamental rift between nature and the human race. Johanna and Clarissa return to the ruins of their castle and persist in a state of spinsterhood, signaling the end of their family line. In contrast to this extirpation of their lineage, the natural world they once communed with carries on as before. The penultimate paragraph reads: Westlich liegen und schweigen die unermeßlichen Wälder, lieblich wild wie ehedem. Gregor hatte das Waldhaus angezündet, und Waldsamen auf die Stelle gestreut; die Ahornen, die Buchen, die Fichten und andere, die auf der Waldwiese standen, hatten zahlreiche Nachkommenschaft und überwuchsen die ganze Stelle, so daß wieder die tiefe jungfräuliche Wildniß entstand, wie sonst, und wie sie noch heute ist. (318) Nature thus renews itself while all human presence vanishes from the scene. Yet once again, Stifter conflates these two realms, expressing "the recovery of nature [...] in human terms—in terms, that is, of an inhumanly human sexuality" (Reddick 67). Gregor's reforestation efforts, here a suggestive act of spreading seed upon virgin soil, is yet another instance of the "profound ambiguity" that runs</page><page sequence="9">Walden in the Bohemian Forest through Stifter's tale, if not entire oeuvre (Reddick 67). An analogous passage in Thoreau is less explicitly sexual, but by no means devoid of anthropocentric pathos: "Why, here is Walden, the same woodland lake that I discovered so many years ago; where a forest was cut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as ever" (193). Of course, some degree of anthropomorphism is inevitable in any artistic representation of nature, a process after all involving the human articulation of a reality that exists on its own terms. Despite the inscriptive and semanticizing trend in Der Hochwald and even Walden, there can be no doubt that both authors seek, albeit in different narrative modes, to express nature as graphically and comprehensively as possible. In Stifter's case, the dominance of the natural environment is reflected in the organization of the work, which consists of seven chapters whose titles all contain compound nouns beginning with the common element "Wald": "Waldburg," "Waldwanderung," "Waldhaus," "Waldsee," "Waldwiese," "Waldfels," and "Waldruine." Beyond these captions, Stifter strews a plethora of further Wald composites throughout the text. To cite the most extreme case of this technique, on a single page one finds the following combinations: "Waldwiese," Waldzug[-]," "Waldrücken," "Waldesbusen," "Waldesdunkel," and "Waldwasser" (214). Stifter's narrative becomes a kind of textual forest in which one repeatedly encounters some form of Wald, from the front cover to the final two paragraphs, where this key word occurs five times. A kind of interconnective holism is thus conveyed in the very fabric of the text. Eva Geulen further examines "die tiefgreifende Affinität zwischen Waldsprache und Textsprache" (101; see 101 05) and Walter Hettche emphasizes this autopoetic function of the forest ("der Wald als Text") over its mimetic presence ("der Wald im Text"). As already indicated, Stifter's practice of mimesis is fraught with problems, but even if his realist tableau remains deeply tinged by Romantic coloration, he nonetheless succeeds in creating a textual world of "lauter Wald und lauter Wald" (Hochwald 254). As the middle chapter in this semiotic landscape, the "Waldsee" further functions as the hub of the plot and central symbol of the work. Though teeming with anthropomorphic tropes, the lake area nevertheless remains environmentally unspoiled, a biocentric space that Stifter conceives as a sanctuary from the folly of man. The following words by Thoreau, themselves not free of incongruous imagery, perfectly apply to Stifter's own Utopian body of water: "It needs no fence. Nations come and go without defiling it. It is a mirror which no stone can crack, whose quicksilver will never wear off, whose gilding Nature continually repairs [...]" (Walden 188). Like Stifter's Plöckensee, Walden forms the core of Thoreau's greater conception of nature. "The Ponds," a key chapter in which he reflects on both the surface characteristics and deeper significance of Walden, forms the exact middle of the book (if one discounts the conclusion as a full-fledged section of the text). Here, in the centerpiece of his narrative, the pond becomes an "intermediate [...]</page><page sequence="10">10 Sean Ireton between land and sky" (188-89), which is made visually apparent by the fact that "it partakes of the color of both" (176). It thus alternately appears green due to the earthly hues surrounding it and blue from the celestial tints above. Moreover, Thoreau's entire experiment in living is predicated on the natural surroundings of the lake. As such, it forms the focal point of his narrative and, of course, gives rise to its laconic—and by now iconic—title. But in a broader sense, this one word— "Waiden"—stands for a transcendental ideal of nature. Thoreau hence elevates his regional body of water to the status of a universal. Like many transcendentalists, Thoreau deified nature as a higher province that exists beyond the individual phenomena perceived by our senses. Nature is thus a kind of Platonic eidos, but, as in original Platonism, a crucial dynamic exists between the transcendent realm of forms and the immanent world of particulars. The term "transcendental," at least according to Kant, designates precisely this rapport between immanence and transcendence, that is, between what lies beyond our experience and what we encounter on a more immediate basis. The goal of Kant's transcendental philosophy is to reflect on the conditions that make our knowledge of objects and concepts possible in the first place—i.e., a priori. The transcendent idea "shares" or "participates" in (cf. Plato's metechein) its concrete manifestations. One can perhaps best visualize transcendentalism, whether its Kantian version or its American adaptation, as a kind of "mysterious ladder" (Emerson, "Circles" 281) by which we scale from the immanent to the transcendent.5 To invoke once again the original transcendental thinker, Plato speaks in the Symposium of "rising stairs" (epanabasmoi) that lead from specific instantiations of beauty to its absolute form (see 493 or sec. 211C). In American transcendentalism, this hierarchical yet interactive model perfectly describes the relationship between the data encountered outdoors (in «ature writ small) and the abstract concept fashioned in our heads (Nature writ large). It is not surprising that this transcendental way of thinking takes on religious overtones such that one's veneration of Nature often corresponds to a worship of God. Emerson's highly influential "Nature" essay, published in 1836, describes this development as a steady upward progression from brute reality to religious devotion. The arrangement of its chapters reflects a kind of Hegelian dialectic that moves from sensory perception through such stages as beauty, idealism, and spirit, eventually reaching the ultimate synthesis of subject and substance. In Emerson, each of these dimensions of human contact with nature is raised to the next level until in the end "congruity [...] between man and the world" is achieved whereby man "finds something of himself in every great and small thing" ("Nature" 37). A similar transcendental ascent from the quotidian to the divine can be discerned in Thoreau, who generally offers a three-stage model of human congress with nature: (1) common opinion and exploitation; (2) empirical observation and exploration; (3) spiritual communion and enlightenment. Take, for example, his varied account of Waiden Pond's uniformly rocky shores. Local tradition has it</page><page sequence="11">Waiden in the Bohemian Forest 11 that Native Americans were using much profanity during a powwow upon an adjacent hill, which then proceeded to shake violently and sink into the earth, releasing stones that settled around the water's rim (see Waiden 182). Thanks to his own exploratory initiatives, Thoreau uncovers a more likely alternative to this folkloric tall tale: the rocks were put into place as a result of glaciation (see 182— 83). Yet he offers even another explanation, maintaining that the lake is of divine origin. In metaphorical terms, he speaks of God as "an old settler and original proprietor, who is reported to have dug Waiden Pond, and stoned it, and fringed it with pine woods" (137). More importantly, he experiences a mystical union with Waiden, or what he proposes be called "God's Drop" (194). As he expresses this sentiment in verse: "I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven / Than I live to Waiden even. / I am its stony shore [...]" (193). For Thoreau, each of these last two attitudes—the realistic and idealistic—toward nature is equally valid. Unlike Emerson, he does not tend to privilege the abstract ideal over the concrete real. Rather, he continually oscillates between tangible entities and conceptual categories. This pendular approach is reflected in Waiden's chapter themes, which alternate between factual reports pertaining to Thoreau's everyday environs and speculative musings on more enduring issues. This dialectical pattern runs throughout the book, such that "the basic opposition and interrelation between ideas and objects is established as a major structural device" (Schneider, Thoreau 52). Transcendentalism thus works both ways for Thoreau. The stairway that leads upward toward the ideational allows one to climb back downward as well. In ascending to lofty heights, we do not altogether abandon the real world that we inhabit and out of which we forge our ideas. Thoreau in effect proposes a "concurrence of upward and downward movement" (Boone 142). He insists that we must simultaneously seek out both domains: the particular and the universal, natural data and divine Nature, Waiden Pond as a glacially formed lake and a cosmic reflection of God. Waiden occupies the center of Thoreau's universe and its waters hold the key to unlocking the laws of Nature. Legend tends to cloud any meaningful truth about the lake, so Thoreau proceeds to investigate the matter by becoming actively involved in the landscape. Since Waiden is rumored to be bottomless, he probes its depths with various instruments, including chains, weights, and sounding lines. This step toward physical participation and empirical analysis thus supercedes popular notions about Waiden Pond as a mysterious body of water whose depths elude ordinary human perception. A trained land surveyor with a "natural skill for mensuration" (Emerson, "Thoreau" 896), Thoreau is able to fathom the pond both literally and figuratively. On the one hand, he locates its floor at 102 feet, a figure that conforms with present-day scientific findings. But as usual, there is another side to Thoreau's engrossment in nature: he also seeks metaphysical truth amidst the given objects around him. He proves just as resourceful in this</page><page sequence="12">12 Sean Ireton endeavor, devising a host of literary tropes to illustrate his quest. His dual take on nature as both immanent datum and transcendent form finds visual support in the recurring activity of fishing. The flaxen line that he casts into the lake links him to its denizens and by extension to Nature (always capitalized in Waiden) as a whole. But true to his double focus, this experience of communion involves two trajectories: "It seemed as if I might next cast my line upward into the air, as well as downward into this element which was scarcely more dense. Thus I caught two fishes as it were with one hook" (175). Thoreau thus places equal emphasis on what would seem to be a non-transcendental vector. In the process, he "reverses the concept of ascendant movement generally associated with Transcendentalism by stressing that the searcher must dig, delve, mine, and burrow toward truth" (Boone 135). Hence the various acts—both realistic and metaphorical—of downward exploration in Waiden: hoeing his beanfield, employing a divining rod to locate water, and, of course, plumbing the pond's depths. Waiden thus becomes a site where Thoreau can conduct his worship of divine Nature in the thick of its multifarious expressions. His religiosity emerges at various points in the narrative. He regularly bathes in the pond as "a religious exercise" (88), cleansing and renewing himself in this pure element. One morning, while immersed in the Bhagavad-Gita, he equates the sanctity of Waiden with "the sacred water of the Ganges" (298). And in a reversal of traditional Christian imagery, he cuts a hole in the ice and peers down into the waters of the pond, surveying its fish, its sandy floor, its timeless serenity. For "Heaven," he remarks, "is under our feet as well as over our heads" (283). Like Waiden Pond, the Plöckensee is both a real and symbolic body of water harboring many different layers of meaning. Der Hochwald contains a variety of perspectives and counter-perspectives on nature and even ascends a transcendental staircase of sorts, not unlike the triadic scale found in Thoreau. Departing from the folkloric—a mindset arising from common opinion, if not outright ignorance—Stifter moves onward to the realistic, an outlook based on close empirical inspection of the natural landscape. In the final stage of this progressive movement, he arrives at the divine, a rarified tier of metaphysical illumination where the laws of nature reveal themselves as wonders of God. Throughout the pages of Der Hochwald, the diverse phenomena of the Bohemian Forest tend to be interpreted in three different ways: from the naïve standpoint of superstition, via the more sophisticated lens of science, and through insight into a numinous transcendent agency. Take, for example, the Plöckensee, the most important feature of Stifter 's landscape. The popular imagination considers it a mysterious "Zauberwasser [...], das Gott mit schwarzer Höllenfarbe gezeichnet und in die Einöde gelegt hat" (262-63). But as Gregor, the experienced outdoorsman, explains to the unenlightened Johanna and Clarissa, the waters merely appear black due to the dark tones of the surrounding pine trees and mountaintops. Gregor's empiricism then rises to another level of awareness, one</page><page sequence="13">Waiden in the Bohemian Forest 13 that accommodates, rather than eliminates, the question of God: he gives thanks to the Creator for having chosen such an aesthetic setting. Like Thoreau, Stifter thus repeatedly deflates Romantic Volksglaube, espousing scientific rationalism in its place but never relinquishing the belief in a higher metaphysics of nature. Another case in point concerns the aspen, whose leaves tremble incessantly for one of two reasons. According to folklore, specifically as transmitted by Gregor's grandmother, the aspen was the only tree that refused to bow down before God and was hence punished "mit ewiger Unruhe, daß sie [die Espe] bei jedem Windhauche erschrickt und zittert, wie jener ewige Jude, der nie rasten kann" (245). The fact that the Czech name for the Bohemian Forest is Sumava, meaning "rauschen" or "to rustle," only reinforces this regional attitude. But Gregor, the intimate observer of nature, sheds a more plausible light on the matter, stating that the leaves of the aspen are so easily agitated because of their long and slender stems. According to one critic, this scene is "beispielhaft fur den Wandel von Stifters Naturauffassung im Verlauf der frühen Studien, fur seine Emanzipation von der Romantik" (Mettler 104). But this emancipatory step does not end here. In perfect keeping with Thoreau's brand of transcendentalism, Stifter suggests that scientism is completely congruent with religiosity: aspen leaves often remain calm before a storm, "wenn der Wald schon harret auf die Stimme Gottes, welche kommen und ihnen Nahrung herabschütten wird" (246-47). Gregor hence dismisses superstition, learning to appreciate the beauty of nature for what it is on the surface (its particularism or biodiversity) as well as for its higher transcendent being (its Platonic form or divinity). Numerous other examples of this practice exist. In each case, Gregor's active involvement in terrain that most people prefer to avoid proves critical for both his scientific and spiritual enlightenment. By seeking out remote comers of the Bohemian Forest, he comes to realize "wie wunderbar er [der Wald] sei, ohne daß die Menschen erst nöthig hätten, ihre Fabeln hinein zu weben [...]" (267). Yet another prominent landmark whose fabled origins he debunks is the mountain known as the "Drei Königssessel." The rock outcroppings on the summit of this peak resemble a cluster of three thrones, each of which looks in the direction of a different country: Bavaria, Bohemia, and Austria. As Gregor, however, recognizes through on-site scrutiny, these formations owe their existence not to some kind of mythological prehistory but to the natural processes of erosion, whether from exposure to wind, sun, or rain. But once again, his understanding transcends the empirical and rises to a religious plane: Ich saß darauf [auf dem Drei Königssessel], und schaute wohl stundenlang in die Länder der Menschen hinaus—und wie ich öfter hier und dort war, erkannte ich gar wohl, daß dieß Alles nur Gottes Werk sei und nicht der Menschen, zu denen sich nur die Sage davon verlor. Sie können nichts bewundem, als was sie selber gemacht haben, und nichts betrachten, als in der Meinung, es sei für sie gebildet. (268)</page><page sequence="14">14 Sean Ireton Gregor's closing words imply a critique of anthropocentrism, in this case of legends that purport to explain the spectacles of nature in human terms. But he himself is not without Romantic sentiment and anthropological prejudice. During one of his many lectures to the sisters, he sinks "in immer romantischere und schwermüthigere Weisen" (262), and his scientific explanations of erosion rely on a series of metaphors derived from both anatomy and carpentry: "die leichten Finger des Regens haben daran gearbeitet, und das weiche, aber unablässige Schreinerzeug der Luft und der Sonne haben sie gezimmert" (268). As Begemann and Downing have pointed out, Gregor is a problematic figure indicative of the fundamental ambiguity underlying the entire narrative. His hybrid status as an enlightened Romanticist (Begemann 183) or poetic visionary/demystifying realist (Downing 281) is as paradoxical as Stifter's larger project of objectively describing nature by subjectively inscribing it with anthropomorphic signification. Gregor remains in the end a highly complex figure, part Romantic pantheist, part natural historian. In his initial edifying discourse to Clarissa and Johanna, he gives . expression to what can best be described as a pantheistic philosophy: "In Allem hier ist Sinn und Empfindung; der Stein selber legt sich um seinen Schwesterstein, und hält ihn fest, Alles schiebt und drängt sich, Alles spricht, Alles erzählt [...]" (Hochwald 243). The reflexive pronouns in this statement underscore the fundamental self-activity of nature (see Mettler 116). Gregor does not perceive the rocks of the forest as inert objects governed by the laws of gravity, as the mechanistic science of physics holds. The rocks, rather, interact on their own through no external influence. Nature is alive and interconnected, not a product of outside forces but a productive force of its own. This is precisely the view advanced by modem ecology and Gregor does on occasion abandon the rhetoric of pantheism and speak in a more ecological vein. For instance, he remarks that der Geier (a relatively broad term in nineteenth-century German that encompasses various types of raptors belonging to the Accipitridae family, including the eagle, hawk, kite, and Old World vulture)6 is a beautiful and innocent animal in its own right and should not be maligned as a "Raubtier." Like the lamb that it preys on, it has a necessary place in the greater web of nature: "Es muß wohl so Verordnung sein in der Welt, daß das Eine durch das Andere lebt" (264). It is no coincidence that Gregor's soliloquy on human arrogance toward the environment occurs right before the bird is mysteriously shot down in mid flight. The author of this senseless act turns out to be Ronald, who plays the role of aggressor on multiple levels: he militarily invades this region of the German lands, brings disruptive passion into the lives of the sisters, and violently intervenes in the course of nature. He thus represents part of the problem that Gregor addresses in his speech on the abuse of nature by humans who "Thiere und Pflanzen mißbrauchen, weil sie im Hochmuthe sich die Einzigen wähnen, und in ihrer Einfalt nie hinausgehen in die Reiche und Wohnungen derselben, um ihre Sprache und Wesenheit zu lernen" (268-69). Ronald typifies man's myopic</page><page sequence="15">Walden in the Bohemian Forest 15 relationship toward the environment. He belongs, effectively, to those responsible for the widespread decimation of winged predators during the mid-nineteenth century. In a single year, 1857, the following number of ornithological species were killed by hunters and foresters in the kingdom of Bohemia: 69 eagles, 202 owls, over 800 hawks, and more than 17,000 vultures [Geier], falcons, and kites (see Schrötter 72). Such a grand-scale slaughter can lead to the annihilation of an entire species, as attested by the classic case of the American passenger pigeon, which became extinct in 1914—some mere three hundred years after the first permanent European settlement in the present-day United States. Stifter thus capitalizes on the example of the Geier to show the pernicious effect of human tampering with nature. In this scene, it becomes obvious that not even the most secluded haven is completely safe from the threat of man. But once again, Stifter's chronic ambiguity clouds matters and undercuts what would seem to be important authorial pronouncements. When the hawk first appears in the sky, Gregor offers to shoot it in order to present Clarissa with one of its "schönen gelbgestreiften Schwungfedern" (263)—hardly testimony of a sound ecological consciousness. The sisters, on the other hand, overwhelmed by "die zarte Majestät dieses Naturspieles" (264), prevail upon him to refrain from violence and thereby demonstrate their maturing environmentalism. His earlier act, again for Clarissa's benefit, of "tearing" an entire branch off the very aspen tree that served to illustrate his theory about the cause of its trembling leaves (see 247) also seems a curious mix of nature appreciation and human aggression. Put pointedly, his apparent biocentric point of view is "hopelessly complex and confused" (Downing 67). As for Ronald, he too is a profoundly ambiguous character, one who used to engage in outdoor pursuits with Gregor—"wie wir jagten, Kräuter suchten, Felsen bestiegen, wie wir uns ergötzten" (290)—and who has even explored the vast wilderness of North America. At this point in his life he wishes to remain with Clarissa and build a house at the lake, "dieser heiligen Insel des Waldes" (294), a plan that allies him with these rogue dwellers of the woodlands. Only upon being spumed by Clarissa does he return to civilization and propel a course of events that proves injurious for all parties. The complexity of these two critical figures, Gregor and Ronald, attests to Stifter's own muddled message about the relationship between humanity and nature. The mixed messages that Stifter sends to his readers are symptoms of his ill defined position between Romantic subjectivity and an objectively filtered brand of realism. Although scholars generally (and sometimes vaguely) point to Der Hochwald as a turning point in Stifter's artistic development, Christian Begemann offers a more nuanced assessment of this redirection, claiming that Stifter's next work, Die Narrenburg (1842), initiates a new aesthetic program characterized by the "Entmischung der Sphären und Desubjektivierung des Subjekts" (207). From this point onward, Stifter increasingly strives to keep his narrative ego in check and allow, in almost phenomenological fashion, the objects to present themselves</page><page sequence="16">16 Sean Ireton of their own accord. Undeniably, a complete suppression of the subject and its attendant ascriptions of meaning is impossible, but Stifter's narrativity undergoes an unmistakable transformation during the mid-1840s. Here is not the place to examine this evolution in further detail. For a brief intimation, one need only compare Der Hochwald with his final publication, Aus dem bairischen Walde (1867), an ostensible "Erzählung" that could almost pass for nonfiction in its mode of narration. As for the nonfictional American classic Waiden, it occupies an analogous place in Thoreau's oeuvre: it is situated between the patently Romantic A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers and the hyper-descriptive, positivistic Journals. In the broader scope of nineteenth-century ecocritical discourse, Stifter and Thoreau each have one foot firmly placed in idealism and empiricism. To contemporary readers, their transcendental ecocentrism may smack of creationism or what lately goes by the name of "intelligent design." But their ideas must be seen as part of a greater epistemic shift from the philosophical contemplation of nature (e.g., German Idealism and European Romanticism) to the empirico scientific perspective found in materialism, positivism, and realism. Stifter and Thoreau were both educated in an academic tradition that blended philosophy and theology with science and natural history. In more precise terms, they were exposed to the school of physicotheology, which holds that all manifestations of nature belong to a superior and connective (read: divine) order. This mutual intellectual background helps explain many of the interconnections between Waiden and Der Hochwald. Although Thoreau is by no means as anthropologically biased as his Austrian counterpart, he is still not entirely free of such tendencies, several of which he projects onto his ecological idyll, Waiden Pond. Stifter's Plöckensee is, of course, more problematically fraught with anthropomorphic properties. The transparent eyeball of a pure nature experience as invoked by Emerson becomes an imperious eye of control under Heinrich von Wittinghausen. Nevertheless, on other symbolic levels, this lake deep within the Bohemian Forest serves as a model of biocentrism as evidenced, for instance, by the Thoreauvian notion of reciprocity that prevails on its shores. The most consistent common thread, however, concerns the transcendental philosophy of nature outlined in each text, whereby folk belief cedes to empiricism, which then rises to metaphysical heights of contemplation. Stifter and Thoreau ultimately find themselves caught between these last two progressive stages of inquiry, between what one might alternatively label empirical and rational holism. In Waiden and Der Hochwald one thus notes an empirically based focus on individual species and exemplars intermingled with the transcendental striving for a higher plan and purpose.</page><page sequence="17">Waiden in the Bohemian Forest 17 Notes 1.1 would like to thank the journal's anonymous evaluators for their highly constructive comments on earlier drafts of this essay. 2. In New England the term "pond" was also a common designation for large bodies of water. During the late nineteenth century, many of these "ponds" were renamed "lakes." Waiden, however, retained its original appellation largely due to the fame it had acquired through Thoreau's book. See Maynard 5. 3. Thoreau read a fair amount of German-speaking authors, both in the original and in translation. (See Bauschinger 137-53 and the extensive bibliographical catalogue complied in Harding; see also Sattelmeyer, Thoreau s Reading.) He also had access to Emerson's personal library, which held numerous works of German literature and philosophy, nothing however by Stifter. (For a comprehensive list, see Vogel 172-76.) If Thoreau had any literary precursors in mind when constructing his ideal of Waiden Pond, they were Jonathan Carver's Three Years ' Travels Through the Interior Parts of America in the Years 1766, 1167, and 1768 and Wordsworth's A Guide Through the District of the Lakes in the North of England. For more on these correlations, see Joy. 4. To my knowledge, the only comparative study of Stifter and Thoreau is a brief one page article by Johannes Urzidil, a twentieth-century writer who hails from Stifter's native Bohemia. Urzidil merely scratches the surface of this rich literary connection (his piece is, after all, only a page long) and his observations seldom overlap with my own. The major exception in this regard concerns the strikingly similar metaphors linking each lake with the human eye and its ancillary features. 5. For more on the influence of Kant and other German authors (e.g., Schelling, Goethe, Humboldt) on American transcendentalism, see Emerson's lecture "The Transcendentalist." Compare also the detailed studies by Bauschinger, Frothingham, and Vogel. 6. According to a recent study, this generic Geier most likely belongs to a species known as the Schreiadler.
