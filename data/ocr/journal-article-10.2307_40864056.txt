A Rough Set Approach to Investigate Students' Implicit Attitudinal Typologies Toward Living Things Serkan Narli · Nurettin Yorek - Mehmet Sahin · Muhammet Usak Published online: 19 March 2010 © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 Abstract This study investigates the possibility of ana- lyzing educational data using the theory of rough sets which is mostly employed in the fields of data analysis and data mining. Data were collected using an open-ended conceptual understanding test of the living things admin- istered to first-year high school students. The responses of randomly selected 60 students among the participants were analyzed using rough set approach on the basis of "nine attitudinal typologies toward wildlife" defined by Kellert (1996). Student responses were tabulated to be used in rough sets and upper and lower approximation analyses were carried out. Students were found to display the characteristics of four out of nine typologies. Analyses revealed that some students who possessed characteristics of a certain typology may partially display the character- istics of other typologies and these typologies could be determined using rough set theory. Keywords Rough set theory · Biology · Attitudes · Living things Introduction There are many constructions based on nonempty finite sets such as knowledge space (Doignon and Falmagne 1985, 1999; Falmagne and Doignon 1988; Falmagne et al.

Usak Department of Science Education, Dumlupinar University, Kutahya, Turkey 1990), dependency spaces (Novotny and Novotny 1992), consequence relations (Tarski 1930), and formal concept analysis (FC A; Ganter and Wille 1999; Wille 1982). For example, in knowledge space theory the implications among the items in a given set Q can be represented via a knowledge structure. This representation is in the form of a collection Κ of subsets of Q, including Q and the empty set, each of which represents a possible knowledge state in a population of students (Stefanutti 2008). Since constructions involve similar system of axioms and operators they may seem alike in some cases (Diintsch and Gediga 2001). In general, these are related to uncertain con- cepts. Uncertain concepts which may alternatively be called imperfect knowledge have preoccupied people's mind for centuries. Currently, the subject is very popular among computer engineers and mathematicians as well as philoso- phers and psychologists. Vague concepts are not easy to formulate using ordinary mathematical concepts since they may not include mathematically definite results. Thus, the necessity of alternative mathematical concepts is apparent for the mathematical modeling of uncertain concepts. The idea of a vague concept is related to the Frege' s (1904) boundary-line view. A concept is vague if there are some objects which can not be classified either to the concept or to its complement but are members of the concept's boundary. The first successful approach to vagueness was the notion of a fuzzy set proposed by Zadeh (1965). In this approach, sets are defined by partial mem- bership in contrast to crisp membership used in classical definition of a set. Another successful approach for vagueness is the rough set (RS) theory defined by Pawlak (1982). After its intro- duction in the early 1980s, the theory of RS has been used as a mathematical tool for extracting knowledge from uncertain and incomplete data (Pawlak 1991, 1995). £} Springer</page><page sequence="2">J Sei Educ Technol (2010) 19:456-469 457 The theory assumes that initially there is necessary infor- mation or knowledge about the objects in the universe with which the objects can be divided into different groups (Hassanien 2003). If we have exactly the same information about two objects then they are said to be indiscernible (similar), that is, we cannot differentiate between them with known information. The RS theory can be used for a variety of purposes such as to find relationships among variables of data, evaluate the importance of attributes, discover the patterns of data, learn common decision-making rules, reduce all redundant objects and attributes, and seek the minimum subset of attributes so as to attain satisfying classification (Hassanien 2003). In addition, using possibly large and simplified patterns, the rough set reduction algorithms enable to approximate the decision classes (Kent 1994; Lin and Cercone 1997; Nings et al. 1995; Pawlak et al. 1995; Polkowski and Skowron 1998a, b; Zhong and Skowron 2000; Yorek and Narli 2009; Narli in press). The RS theory has many applications in a variety of fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, pattern recognition, deci- sion support systems, data analysis, and data mining. Attitudes and 'Attitudinal Typologies' of Stephen Kellert Attitudes have been extensively studied both theoretically and empirically in the social and behavioral sciences (Fer- nandez-Manzanal et al. 2007. Eagly (1992, p. 694) defined attitudes as "a tendency or state internal to a person which biases or predisposes a person toward evaluative responses which are to some degree favorable or unfavorable." Weiten (1997) identified cognitive, affective, and behavioral com- ponents to these tendencies. People's beliefs constitute the cognitive component; the affective component consists of the feelings people generate towards objects or attitudes; and the behavioral component comprises of various aptitudes or predispositions for acting in certain manners. The investigation of attitudes toward nature has been the focus of a considerable amount of research over the past three decades. Among these, the studies by Stephen Kellert are considered to have special importance because they system- atized the attitudes toward nature (especially animals). Kellert (1996) provided descriptive analysis of nine fundamental attitudinal 'types.' Brief definitions of the attitude types are provided in Table 1. Children's attitudes were found to change over the course of their school years. Students were found to have primarily affective or emo- tional relationships toward animals (ages 6-9 years); then their attitudes changed to one focusing on cognitive or factual understandings (ages 10-13 years) and to a view that comprises an ethical concern and ecological awareness of the role of animals in their natural habitats. Kellert and Berry (1980) found a direct relationship between educa- tional level, concern, interest, and awareness of environ- mental issues. Although Kellert has identified nine typologies, it has been found that in some cases he added other typologies (for example, neutralistic and theistic in Japanese people) (Kellert 1991) to this categorization and in others he combined typologies in two groups (for instance, natural- istic-ecologistic, utilitarian-dominionistic, and Ecoscien- tific) (Kellert 1993b; Barney et al. 2005). Likert type data collection instruments are common to identify typologies but other means are also used for this purpose such as open-ended questions (Caro et al. 1994). Research studies that investigate attitudes toward nature and animals on the basis of Kellert' s typologies were found to be trying to include subjects in one of the nine typologies (Kellert and Berry 1980; Kellert 1985, 1991, 1993a, b, 1996). However, a person included in one typology may display characteristics of other typologies. For example, Bjerke et al. (1998) found that whereas people who are older and have lower level of education showed high dominionistic, high negativistic, high utilitarian, and low naturalistic attitudes, relatively young and well educated people demonstrated reverse pattern. Barney et al. (2005) conducted a study with six different age groups using a Kellert-type inventory. Students completed an attitude scale involving humanistic, utilitarian and ecoscientific components. As a result students obtain scores from each attitude component and hence it may not be possible to characterize students with only one attitudinal component. For this reason sometimes it may not be possible to decide exactly in which typology a person will be included. One may need scientific evidence to be able to include persons in one of these sub-categories. A possible scientific argu- mentation may be provided via mathematical data analysis. Commonly used and known statistical analyses may not be used efficiently in determining such typologies. This paper discusses RS theory as a possible means of determining these sub-categories. Research indicates that sometimes rough set theory is compared to other statistical analysis techniques such as, discriminant analysis. It is suggested that while there can be no proof to show that some techniques are most appropriate for some particular problems, it may appear that each technique may have some specific strengths for certain problems. It is mentioned in the literature for example that, when there is a data distribution which deviates significantly from a normal distribution, using rough sets might be more appropriate than statistical analysis (Munakata 1998). In addition, when the sample size is small, it may be better to use the rough sets than to use statistical analysis since any distribution can hardly be defined in such a case (Munakata 1998).

Method In this study, qualitative data obtained from student answers to open-ended questions were mathematically analyzed using RS theory. Participants The participants included 128 male and 63 female ninth- grade students who were selected via cluster sampling method from seven high schools in Izmir, Turkey. The RS analysis included 60 students (30 male and 30 female) selected randomly from the participating students. Schools accepted students from different parts of the city and students varied in terms of socioeconomic status. Data Collection In this study, the data were collected using the CULT (Conceptual understanding test of the living things) which includes open-ended questions (Yorek et al. 2009). Emerg- ing themes and patterns during the interviews of 14 ninth- grade students about the concept were listed. Student ideas along with the results of an analysis of the National Edu- cation Curriculum to determine conceptual framework of the biology content have helped us develop a draft version of the CULT in the form of open-ended questions. The test was piloted with 25 ninth-grade students and experts' opinion were asked about functionality of the test. The final version of the test used in this study is presented in Table 2. Reliability and Validity of the CULT Content validity of the measures was obtained using two expert faculty members' detailed examination of the con- tent. In reliability analysis, qualitative data were catego- rized and coded separately by the researchers. The coding was compared and there was 90% agreement among the researchers' analyses. Data Analyses Our main data collection tool was the fourth question in the CULT. Students were asked to respond to this question in two steps. First they were required to rank the five names of the living things using their own significance criteria and then explain how they ranked the names, that is, provide the reason of their choices. The other questions in the CULT were used to interpret and clarify information obtained from the fourth question. Students' responses to the fourth question along with their replies to the other questions were analyzed to determine students' typology or typologies based on Kellert' s definition. For example, let us assume that two students ranked nettle first in the fourth question. Assume that one of them ranks nettle first because it is a "healing or medicinal herb,' and the other ranks nettle first because it is a 'photosynthesis maker and producer' plant. Former stu- dent was categorized as 'utilitarian' and the latter as 'ecologistic' All the students' answers were categorized similarly and the data obtained were tabulated appropri- ately to be analyzed using rough set approach. The data are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Φ Springer</page><page sequence="4">J Sei Educ Technol (2010) 19:456-469 459 Table 2 Conceptual understanding test of the living things (CULT) 1. It is estimated that there are millions of species living on Earth.

How did you determine the level of importance? Explain Mouse, honeybee, daisy, mushroom, stinging nettle Results This section provides the results of the CULT. Data were evaluated especially on the basis of the fourth question. Results also include evaluations of student responses to the fourth question using rough sets. Results of the CULT Student Classifications of the Living Things Responses to the first research question were analyzed to determine how students classified the living things. Student answers convened at two main groups namely Only ani- mals' and "human, animals, and plants/ During our interviews with students, we looked for any clues for reasons why students grouped the living things as human, animals, and plants. Researcher (R): If I ask you to classify the living things into some main groups, how many groups can you form? Student (S): Living things... living things... (thinking) R: At least in how many groups can you divide them? S: ... Living on land, on sea, flying, plants, and humans. R: How did you do this classification? S: According to their habitat, and I distinguished the plants and humans. R: Why? S: Since humans have mind and plants do not move (fixed), I grouped them separately. It is expressed in the literature that while classifying animals, instead of a biological classification, students often consider appearance of animals and group them according to their habitat and type of movement (flying, swimming, etc.) they use for displacement (Kattmann 2001; Tunnicliffe and Reiss 1999, 2000). It is thought that in classification, students consider mostly appearance and physical characteristics of the living things; and they do not change their classification criteria even after they were taught biological classification. In addition, as reported by Shepardson (2005), students perceive human not as a part of the nature but as 'distinct' from the nature and when asked to "classify the living things", students, with an anthropocentric approach, were seen to treat human in a separate group. Place of Human Among the Living Things Responses to the second question were analyzed to deter- mine how or where students are placed human among all the living things. Four out of five students for both males and females indicated that human was the most advanced among all the living things. In student interviews, we have seen that they had a common thought form which places human at the center and believes that all the other living things exist for human. Excerpts from three students' interviews illustrate this idea: R: In terms of biological classification, what do think about the place of human among all the other living things? S2: Human is at the top position... As if we are not revolving with the earth, but the earth is revolving for us... Like all natural phenomenon are occurring for us. Since human can think and has skills, he is at the top. S7: Human is the most important living being who leads and develops the natural cycle... The most important distinction of human from animals and plants is his ability to think. Besides, everything in nature is created for humans. S9: I think everything in nature is an established mechanism for humans to live comfortably. You know, from plants... we benefit from animals (meat and milk). There are much more for humans to benefit from. The placement of human at the center of nature and the idea that all the living things exist for human may be explained by the possibility of choosing a categorization according to harm or benefit human will get from the living beings. Questions three and four have assumed the role of determining the priority human attributes himself/herself among all the living things. £} Springer</page><page sequence="5">460 J Sei Educ Technol (2010) 19:456-469 Significance of the Living Things Analyses of the third and fourth questions were conducted to determine the criteria used by the students in charac- terizing the living things as 'important', 'more important', or 'not important.' From the analyses of the other questions we have seen that human concept was emphasized and placed at the center of the nature. Based on our analyses, we can say that in attributing importance to the living things students use a self-center approach. Two main categories were determined from the analysis of the responses to the third question. First, students who believed that there could not be any living things that were not useful in nature were determined. Responses including nutritional relationships, écologie balance, usefulness for human, and an implication that everyone has a role in nature, were considered in this category. Our data suggest that approximately four fifth of both male and female students said that there were not any living things that could be identified as 'unimportant' in nature. It has been argued that people attribute value to the living things by judging them in terms of beauty, useful- ness, rarity, and visual attractiveness and these character- istics shape their opinion of whether the species should be protected or not (Ash worth et al. 1995; Kellert 1993a, b). In the present study, students who believed that all the living things are important seemed to consider the importance from a human-centered point of view. An excerpt from a student interview supports this idea. R: How do you determine the importance (important or unimportant) of a living thing? S: In terms of benefits and harms to the nature. R: Can we say that a living thing is unimportant if it is not beneficial to human? S: No, we cannot. R: What is important is its benefit to the nature... S: Ye s y in the end, we benefit from the nature. Students who ranked honeybee as first, said 'honeybee makes honey' as their reason for ranking. Male students who ranked daisy as first, said it was a plant and made photosyn- thesis, whereas females indicated that they selected daisy since it was a 'flower' and 'beautified the nature'. Students who ranked nettle as first, said they chose it since it was a healing plant, or a producer plant. Examples of student responses that ranked different names as first are given below. St: No living thing in the nature is more important than any other. However, this point of view changes from human to human. Humans regard the ones who are beneficial to them as more important. SJ2: Daisy-Honeybee-Mushroom-Nettle-Rat. Daisy helps us continue our lives by photosynthesis (breathing). Honeybee makes honey (I guess). I like honey very much and eat it. Mushroom (though some are poisonous) is tasty and has importance in the nature. I do not like nettle much, it is irritating and thus harmful. I do not like rat too. I am scared of rat and it may be harmful to people 's belongings. It may be good for the nature but it is harmful for me. S3: Rat-Honeybee-Daisy-Mushroom-Nettle. Because rat, although seems to be harmful, helps us by eating harmful plants. Stf.* Honeybee-Nettle-Mushroom-Daisy-Rat: I made this list by thinking in terms of their benefit to humans. Sg: Honeybee-Daisy-Nettle-Fungus-Rat: I determined the degree of importance according to their contribution to human life. Without honeybee, humans would not have honey. To make honey, flowers are required of course. Sio' Rat, because rat is an animal. Others are plants. In summary, results of the CULT indicate that students, who placed human at the center of nature, placed human in a separate category when classifying the living things and judged the significance of the living things according to their benefit or harm for human. Consequently, for instance a student considered to have ecologistic attitude according to Kellert's typology, may also be said to display sub- conscious utilitarian characteristics. For instance, in the above excerpts of students, student named as S12 said the reason for his/her listing of daisy first was, "daisy helps us continue our lives by photosynthesis** and this student is classified as having 'Ecologistic' attitudinal typology as shown in Table 4 (This student is represented as x13 in Table). However, when the student's whole conversation is considered along with this answer, it appears that this student may display other attitudes (such as utilitarian) as well as ecologistic. There seems to be an uncertainty in the classification that needs to be done here and in a normal classification presented in Table 4, this uncertainty can not be shown. But this uncertainty in students' attitudinal classification can be determined by analyzing the same data using rough set theory and is done so in Table 7. In the following sections, students' responses to fourth question of the CULT will be evaluated on the basis of RS theory and data will be analyzed. Rough Set Theory: Basic Concepts According to the concept of ordinary set the members of a set are precisely known. In other words, a member either belongs to a set or not. For instance, set of add numbers this kind of a set because a number is either odd or not. However, in the real world not everything can be differ- entiated with a crisp line. Let us think about a set of 'young people.' The set of young people contrary to the set of odd Ö Springer</page><page sequence="6">J Sei Educ Technol (2010) 19:456-469 461 numbers can not be defined with definite boundaries. In daily life people often use this kind of language which contains concepts with no definite boundaries. This led scientists to work on and search for alternative set ideas. A successful example of these alternative set theories is the rough set theory defined by Pawlak (1982). Rough set theory is an expansion of ordinary set theory. In the rough set theory, a subset of a universal set is defined with the help of two sets named as upper and lower approximations of the subset. The basic tool in Pawlak' s rough sets is an equivalence relation. Upper and lower approximations are formed using equivalence sets (Aktas and Cagman 2005). In addition, after Pawlak's definition of rough sets, other researchers also developed rough sets using different algebraic structures instead of equivalence relation (Bonikowaski 1995; Jiashang et al. 2005; Kumar 1993; Kuroki 1997; Pomykala and Pomykala 1988; Narli and Ozcelik 2008). Scientists all over the world showed great interest in Pawlak's rough set theory. Pawlak defined rough sets as follows: According to rough set theory, lower approximation set of any set A is represented as 'Riow(A)' R representing the equivalence relation, and is composed of elements which are definitely members of the set A. Upper approximation set of any set A is represented as 'Rup(A)' and is composed of elements which are likely to be members of the set A. For instance, suppose patients having a certain illness are the objects, then one will have similar information about the patients, namely symptoms of this disease. Objects characterized by the same information are said to be indiscernible (similar) with respect to available information about them. The relation generated from this indiscern- ibility is the mathematical basis of RS theory (Pawlak 1982; Polkowski and Skowron 1998a). Lower and upper approximation sets and boundary region can be found mathematically as follows: Let IU be a finite universal set; RCIU χ IU is an equivalence relation and ACIU. (1) Union of the equivalence classes formed in IU according to relation R and entirely included in set A is called lower approximation of set A with respect to relation R (Rk)W(A)); (2) Union of the equivalence class, which have non- empty intersection and formed in U according to relation R, with set A is called upper approximation of set A with respect to relation R (Rup(A)); (3) Difference of the upper approximation of the set from the lower approximation of the set is called the boundary region of set A with respect to relation R (Br(A)). Fig. 1 Schematic representation of a rough set This can be presented as Riow(A) = Ua6iu{R(a) : R(a) C A} (1) RUP(A) = UaGlu{R(a) : R(a) Π Α φ 0} (2) BR(A) = Rup(A) - RIow(A) (3) where R(a) denotes the equivalence class of aelU. On the basis of these definitions, set A is said to be crisp if the boundary region of A is empty and A is said to be rough if the boundary region of A is non-empty. This is shown schematically in Fig. 1 . A rough set can be also characterized numerically by a coefficient called accuracy of approximation, aR(X), which is obtained by dividing the number of elements (also called cardinality) in the lower approximation set IRlow(X)l, with the number of elements in the upper approximation set IRup(X)l, βκ(χ) = 1κ=ΦοΓ (4) Obviously 0 &lt; aR(X) &lt; 1 and if aR(X) = 1, X is said to be crisp (precise) with respect to R, if aR(X) &lt; 1, X is said to be rough (vague) with respect to R. Details of the theory of rough sets can be found in Pawlak (1982, 1997, 1998), Pawlak et al. (1995), and Polkowski and Skowron (1998a, b). Rough Set Data Analysis Data analyzed using rough sets are put into two-dimen- sional or matrix-form tables. These are called information tables (or decision tables). An example of a simple infor- mation table is shown in Table 3. When we examine this example, we see that the col- umns of the information table are divided into three sec- tions, namely the universe U, condition attributes, and decision attribute. The universe is the set of elements under consideration as in ordinary sets. In the above example, the universe contains 6 patients. We can have any number of Ö Springer</page><page sequence="7">462 J Sei Educ Technol (2010) 19:456-469 Table 3 Symptoms and flu problem of patients (Pawlak 1997) Universe Condition attributes Decision attribute Patient Headache Muscle-pain Temperature Flu P! No Yes High Yes P2 Yes No High Yes P3 Yes Yes Very high Yes P4 No Yes Normal No P5 Yes No High No P6 No Yes Very high Yes condition attributes; in this example, we have three, Headache, Muscle-pain, and Fever. Similarly, we can have any number of decision attributes, although one is all that is required. In the above example, we have one decision attribute, Flu Problem. Rows of an information table are called entities (objects, or sometimes examples). The entities can be labeled by the elements of the universe as, for example, Ashley, etc. Each element (patient in the above table) is characterized by its condition and decision attribute values (Munakata 1998). Condition attributes together define an equivalence relation R (called indis- cernibility relation) of universe IU. Lower and upper approximation sets are calculated with respect to equiva- lence classes which will be formed according to this relation. Dependence of Conditions A significant aspect in data analysis is the discovery of dependences among conditions. If some condition attri- butes P, define some other decision attributes Q, then it can be said that Q decision attributes depends on the Ρ condi- tion attributes. In the above example, Ρ condition attributes may be regarded as "Headache, Muscle-pain, and Fever' and Q decision attribute may be regarded as 'Flu'. In this case whether the patient has flu or not may said to be related to whether he/she displays any characteristic of the Ρ condition attributes at any degree. That is, Ρ condition attributes define to some extent the decision attribute Q. Here the rough set theory can provide a quantitative value for this relation. If there exits a functional relationship between the values of Ρ and Q this relationship is deter- mined as follows: Let Ρ and Q be the condition and decision attributes respectively. If k is determined as the following, it is said that Q is dependent on Ρ to the degree of the number k (0 &lt; k&lt; 1) and is shown as Ρ =&gt; *Q. t=r(P,Q)=M (5) where the set of POSP(Q) is called positive region and as noted in Sect. 3.4.3, in the present study this set is equal to union of the lower approximation sets. Here, IPOSp(Q)l and IUI denotes the number of elements in the positive region and universal set respectively. The importance of Ρ in mapping the dataset examples into Q is determined by the degree of dependency. If it is one, k = 1, this means that Q is totally dependent on Ρ and thus the attributes are essential. If it is zero, k = 0, then Q is independent of the attributes in Ρ and thus the attributes are not useful. Values of the degree of dependency between zero and one, 0&lt;ifc&lt;l, represent partial dependency, which means that some of the attributes in Ρ may be useful or the dataset was inaccurate in the beginning. In addition, the contradictions in some selected subsets of the dataset can be determined by looking at the complement of k (Pawlak 1998). In this part of the study, concepts of rough set theory will be adapted to our study. Rough Set Data Analysis for Present Study Students were asked to rank five living things (honey bee, daisy, rat, nettle, and mushroom) in terms of significance and to include the criteria they used in their responses. Students' typologies were identified according to their responses. Our analyses showed that students could be classified into four typologies appropriately. Each student belonged to one of four possible classes: utilitarian, eco- logistic, humanistic, and scientistic. Data for randomly selected 60 students are presented in Table 4. In rough sets and knowledge representation data needs to be composed as condition attributes and decision attri- bute. Rank of the living things are assigned as condition attributes and students' typologies are assigned as decision attribute. These are shown in Table 5. Accordingly, the information system for significance of the living things in the present study is presented in Table 6. When we examine Table 6 we notice that students who ranked the living things in the same order may display dif- ferent typologies. For example, although students χ π and Xi4 used the same ranks for the five living things [Honeybee- H (rankl), Daisy-D (rank2), Rat-R (rank5), Nettle-N (rank4), Mushroom-M (rank3)], while Xn is identified as humanistic, xj4 identified as utilitarian. This may indicate that students who belong to a certain typology may partially possess the characteristics of other typology or typologies.

This is called indiscernibilty relations (Pawlak 1991). When the condition attributes in Table 6 are considered, equivalence relation R divides student set (IU) into the equivalence classes. The students who have the same value in their condition attributes column will be in the same equivalence classes. For example, students x' and X43 used the same ranks for the five living things [H (2), D (4), R (5), Ν (1), M(3)] and these students are in the same equivalence class.

Lower and Upper Approximations In the present study, four separate rough sets can be formed. Lower and upper approximation sets which can identify students who certainly belong or has the possibility of belonging to any of the utilitarian, ecologistic, human- istic, and scientistic groups are determined. Lower and Upper Approximations of Utilitarian Set The set U={xi, x5, x6, X9, Xu, X17, X20, X22, X23&gt; X25» X26» X27, X30» X3i&gt; X34&gt; X41» X43» X44» X49» X50» X54» X55» X5ó) is the set of students classified as utilitarian. In addition, there may be students who is not a member of this set (for instance x4), however, who may have ranked the five living things same as some of the students who belong to Utilitarian set (for instance x9). Therefore, besides students who are definitely Utilitarian, there may be students who are potentially Utilitarian. These students can be determined using the lower and upper approximation sets of the Utilitarian set. In forming the lower and upper approximation sets, the equivalence relation R defined in Sect. 3.4.1 and the equivalence classes in the set IU/R are used. The union of the equivalence classes which are entirely included in the Utilitarian set forms the lower approximation set of the Utilitarian set and the union of the equivalence classes which have at least one common member with the Utilitarian set forms the upper approximation set of the Utilitarian set.

Since students x15, x35, X51, X60 are members of the lower approximation set according to the theory of rough set they are certainly utilitarian. Lower and Upper Approximations of Scientistic Set Stu- dents who are identified as scientistic are members of the set {x8, x18, x38, X40}.

Students who are certainly scientistic are Xi8, x38, and X40. Since the boundary sets of these four sets, BR(U), BR(E), BR(H), BR(S) are non-empty, the sets of U, Ε, Η, and S are rough sets. As mentioned in Sect. 3.2., rough sets can be also characterized numerically by a coefficient, Using the previously mentioned number of elements for each upper and lower approximation set, corresponding coefficients for utilitarian, ecologistic, humanistic, and scientistic sets in the present study are calculated as the following: aR(U) = H s 0.301, aR(E) = H - 0.324, aR(H) = ±j Ê* 0.235, aR(S) = ^ 0.428 â Springer</page><page sequence="12">J Sei Educ Technol (2010) 19:456-469 467 This shows that, students' rank configurations for "honey bee, daisy, rat, nettle, and mushroom," partially explain type of their typologies. Dependency of Attributes This section investigates the question to what extent the type of students' rankings of the living things ['honey bee (H), daisy (D), rat (R), nettle (N), mushroom (M)] determines the attribute classes to which students belong. For this purpose, when the condition attribute taken as Ρ = {Η, D, R, Ν, Μ} and the decision attribute as Q = {Dec}, the value of Ρ =&gt; *Q (£ = ?(P, Q)) can be found. Using the same rea- soning as in Sect. 3.3.1, the positive region will be the union of the lower approximation sets of the utilitarian, ecologis- tic, humanistic, and scientistic sets. Consequently, the lower approximation sets will be Rlow(U) = {xb x5, x6, x17, x23, X25&gt; X27» X34» X41&gt; X43» X44&gt; X54}&gt; Rlow(E) = {χ2» X12&gt; X16» X24» X29» X36» *42&gt; X45» X48» X52» X53» X59}&gt; Rlow(H) = {Xi5, X35, X51, X6oh Riow(S) = {χΐ8, χ38&gt; χ4ο} and therefore, POSP(Q) and k = y(P, Q) will be calculated as the following: POSp(Q) = {Xi, X5, X6, X17, X23, X25» X27» X34» X41&gt; X43» X44» X54}U{X2, X12» X16» X24» X29» X36» X42» X45» X48» X52» X53&gt; x59}U{Xi5, X35, X5b x60}U{Xi8, χ38, Χ4θ} = {χ1, X2, X5, *6, X12&gt; X15» X16» X17» X18» X23» X24&gt; X25» X27» X29» X34» X35» X36» X38» x40, X41» X42» X43» X44» X45&gt; X48» X54» X51» X52» X53» X59&gt; x«).y(P.Q)=fi^ = &amp; = 0.516. A summary of utilitarian, ecologistic, humanistic, and scientistic sets is presented in Table 7. Table 7 shows the members of each set who certainly belong to the set and those members who are not definitely belong to a set but can potentially be included in a set. Schematic representation of the groupings displayed in Table 7 may prove to be a useful summary of relationships among students' attitudinal typologies. This is presented in Fig. 3. Figure 3 indicates that some of the subjects who belong to the set U also posses the characteristics of the sets E, H, or S in the upper approximation. Similarly, some of the members of the set Ε also posses the characteristics of the sets U, H, or S. In addition, indications such as the members of the set S and the members of the set H belong to different sets and also only one subject in the set U and only two subjects in the set Ε posses the characteristics of the set S, provides us infor- mation about the details of this approach. It is thought that these results may not be obtained by means of any other analyses techniques apart from Rough set approach. Conclusion Humans have inherent multivariate and sophisticated behaviors.

In educational research, qualitative or quantitative, most commonly used statistical analysis procedures are descriptive statistics, i-test, ANOVA/MANOVA, correlation, regression, and psychometric statistics (Hsu 2005). The present study used a mathematical analysis approach to an educational research involving qualitative data. It can be said that this is a new approach applied in qualitative data analysis. Conse- quently, the present study has attempted to show the appli- cability of rough set theory in detailed analyses of educational data. The theory of rough sets are utilized mostly in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, pattern rec- ognition, decision support systems, expert systems, data analysis, and data mining. Kellert (1993a, b) has represented some typologies in binary groups (e.g., utilitarian-dominionistic). However, these groupings occur between typologies that display very similar characteristics. Employing rough set approach it can be argued that there may be students who have intermediate attitudes among the typologies identified by Kellert. Students who already belong to one of four typologies identified in this study may be included in any other typology £i Springer</page><page sequence="13">468 J Sei Educ Technol (2010) 19:456-469 Fig. 3 Schematic representation of interrelations among attitudes based on RST and the possibility of this can be determined mathematically as shown in this study. The degree of accuracy of approxi- mation, ocr(X) = ,Kffi,vsL was calculated for each of four typologies. It was found that there were 31 students who certainly belonged to any one of the typologies. It can be said that no crisp boundaries can be drawn for the remaining 29 students. Therefore, it can be argued that 29 students display the characteristics of different typologies and the boundaries of their attitudes toward nature are not clear. In addition, the degree of accuracy of approximation values, aR(U) = 0.301, aR(E) 9* 0.324, aR(H) *á 0.235, aÄ(S) ^ 0.428 are closer to zero than to one implying that the sets U, E, H, and S are far from being exact which supports the condition of 29 students. It was determined that according to rough set theory the form of students' ranking of five living things can identify the type of their typology with a proportion of 0.516. Further research can include different attributes and use rough set approach to determine intermediate typologies by different proportions. Researchers believe that in studies where attitudes are measured via Likert-type scales it may be possible to determine intermediate attitudes using rough set approach. Further study is needed in this field. Consequently, the results of this study indicate that using rough set approach in analyzing data from educa- tional research examining attitudes, behaviors, or beliefs may help us obtain more detailed information about the data analyzed and hence about the characteristics of the participants involved. In addition, precise knowledge about our students' attitudes and beliefs may prove helpful in curricular and instructional studies.
