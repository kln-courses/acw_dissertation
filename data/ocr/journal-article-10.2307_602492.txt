Dr. Das Gupta asks an intelligent question, and approaches it intelligently; What was the vajra? He suggests that we should look in the archaeological record, and finds it in the 'anthropomorphic figures' that accompany the copper hoards. This would involve an earlier date for these hoards than has usually been allowed, but the distribution as given by Lal in Ancient India, 195 1,-which should be out of date by now, but is reproduced by the author-is in the Madhyadesa as the core areas for the figures. This Kuru-Pancala area is the area of Brahmadatta and Vyasa, the collectors of our RV. But the figures have not been found further West or in Iran;</page><page sequence="2">Brief Reviews of Books 537 argumentum e silentio is very weak here owing to paucity of excavation, but it is disturbing: Mithra has a vazra/vajra in the Avesta. Dr. Das Gupta has collected the Vedic references, especially those of RV, thoroughly, and supposes them to refer to the one weapon. Here a difficulty may lie. One would expect the national god to have the national weapon, which may change. We may have the remains of the Battle- axe cultural tradition in Thor's hammer, but while the bow is the preeminent weapon of MBh., it is Rudra/Apollo's weapon, not the chief god's. The vajra seems to be doing rather different things in different hymns, and I cannot envisage what the wooden shaft is doing on the anthro- pomorphic figure, nor why it should be usually carried with both hands; if the figure is a weapon, one can understand it revolving. It is clear that the art, whether classical or Gandhara, is of little use in helping us to reconstruct the Vedic weapon. Practical experiment with vajras of the suggested form would make a more powerful argument than philological discussion using terms whose precise definition is not certain-though that is not the author's fault. In sum, Dr. Das Gupta has made a useful and interesting contribution, but it will not convince all. R. MORTON SMITH TORONTO</page></plain_text>
