<plain_text><page sequence="1">Twists and Turns: Modern Misconceptions of Peripatetic Dance Theory GREGORY SCOTT The eared owl ... is a rogue and a mimic: while it apes the dance of the hunter, his accomplice comes behind and catches it. Aristotle, History of Animals, Bk 8, Ch. 12 (tr. d'A.W. Thompson) INTRODUCTION In his last major work, The Laws, the Athenian Plato (c. 42 7-347 bce) - 'Idealist' philosopher,1 poet, and founder of the Academy - presents the first extended theory of dance and its place in education and culture, as part of a life-long interest in the philosophy of art. Especially in Books II and VII he delves into topics pertaining to the benefits of dance (health, grace, flexibility, strength, military preparation and fitting harmoniously into a social order), dance education, feminism, categories of dance (noble or beautiful, athletic, and Pyrrhic), and principles of criticism (technique, subject matter, and 'style' or how the subject matter is realised). His Macedonian pupil Aristotle (384-322 bce) in many ways inherits the same interests and outlooks, - and in many ways does not. Empirical philosopher, biologist (according to Darwin, the greatest who ever lived), founder of formal logic and of psychology, compiler and analyst of political constitutions and plays, whom Dante in the Inferno calls the 'master of those who know', Aristotle also devotes considerable papyri to the theory of the arts in general and to drama and music in particular. However, he offers only scattered remarks on dance per se. Nevertheless, they occur for the most part in the Poetics, itself considered in aesthetics to be one of the most important tracts on art and theatre ever written, if not the most important. Consequently, those remarks greatly influenced subsequent dance theorists such as Claude-Francois Menestrier, who published Des Ballets Anciens et Modernes in 1682, and Jean- Georges Noverre, who followed with Lettres sur la Danse in 1760, resulting in a significant impact on ballet of the eighteenth to twentieth centuries. In the last hundred years, not much direct attention has been paid to either Plato or Aristotle by dance theorists or historians, which is rather surprising given the foundational importance of the two thinkers in the rest of Western thought and culture. Two exceptions are Margaret H'Doubler, who can take as</page><page sequence="2">154 GREGORY SCOTT much credit as anyone, if not more, for establishing dance in American universities at the beginning of the twentieth century at Columbia University and then the University of Wisconsin, and Selma Jeanne Cohen, arguably the most notable Anglo-American dance historian from the 1960s to the 1990s: the former incorporates much of Platonic theory in her written work, and the latter often points to, or employs, Aristotelian conceptual tools (and in private conversation once told me that Aristotle's doctrine of the four causes - that one best understands a phenomenon by knowing its material, formal, final, and efficient causes or 'be-causes'- was considered by a number of her students to be one of the most useful principles she ever passed on to them). One reason why Aristotle himself may have been ignored recently is a widely-known vitriolic critique by Andre Levinson in 1927, which comprised part of his essay The Idea of the Dance: From Aristotle to Mallarme. Levinson claims that Aristotle not only rejected purely formal dance but stalled dance's autonomy as an art form for hundreds of years in favor of mimetic movement that helps 'tell a story'. Roger Copeland, co-editor of the seminal What is Dance? and normally an excellent scholar, essentially embraces this view in the 1980's. Whatever, though, the reason for the recent lack of attention paid to the Greek in dance circles, a fresh look at Aristotle's views appears warranted: a re-examination of the Poetics in the last few years has thrown serious doubt on whether he conceives of the main focus of that treatise, tragic drama (and comic drama, for that matter), as a species of literature, the commonly-accepted view since the treatise was 're-discovered' and commented upon by Francesco Robortello in 1548. The alternative, which is based on a very close reading of the Poetics and which I myself embrace, is that he conceives of tragic drama as its own art form, with language as merely one necessary element along with plot, music, spectacle, and dance.2 On this latter option, dance obviously becomes much more important with respect to the issues that traditionally have arisen from the Poetics and that arguably have been too often distorted as a result of a fundamental misunder- standing of the scope of the treatise. It therefore seems timely now to remind dance writers how one of the finest minds in the history of the Western world understood the art form and its worth. In what follows, I shall provide what I believe is the best interpretation of Aristotle's brief but rich remarks on dance in the Poetics. Afterwards, I shall try to show how not only Levinson and Copeland missed some crucial tenets but how even a dance theorist who is friendly to Aristotle, Joanna Friesen, has, by not being rigorous enough, jeopardised the value and acceptance of his thought. By doing all of this, I hope to help place dance scholars in a more advantageous position vis-a-vis other debates that have been built on the Poetics from the Renaissance onwards concerning the role of dance in the arts and in life in general, whether or not those debates are new or are part of any re-examination of traditional ones that were once seemingly settled, say, in favor of literature.</page><page sequence="3">TWISTS AND TURNS 155 DANCE THEORY IN THE POETICS For at least the last hundred years, Anglo-American readers have interpreted Aristotle to hold in the Poetics that dance must be mimetic in the sense of conveying emotions or other aspects of human or zoological life, typically with the further implication that for him the Terpsichorean art must therefore be subsumed under drama. Here I wish to argue that both points misrepresent his thought. As I shall illustrate below, a careful reading of the relevant Greek passages, which are too often ignored or misunderstood by not only dance scholars but classicists, demonstrates that he also embraces purely formal dance - for example, representing only circles and other geometric shapes - as a potentially worthwhile experience. We shall also see that he advocates the autonomy of the arts, and not only with respect, for instance, to politics but to each other. Let us start with my title. The notion of Peripatetic dance or of Peripatetic dance theory is strange. Not that 'Peripatetic' and 'dance' are far removed from each other, because the former term, connoting 'walking', is obviously movement-oriented. Yet, the walking originally resulted not on stage but in the Lyceum, where instead of sitting around a table Aristotle conducted seminars in a peripatos or walking area, which naturally resulted in a lot of turns when the group reached one of the walls. Sadly, though, notwithstanding biological observations like the one above pertaining to 'dancing' owls, the emphasis on movement while instructing (or learning) or on the primacy of kinesis while theorising about the natural world was apparently not matched in his writings by an equal emphasis on a theory of 'rhythm' (rhuthmos), that is, 'ordered body movement'. This is not only the meaning of the term given by Plato in the Laws3 but one which Aristotle accepts in some passages in the Poetics, as I show later in detail. This lack of emphasis with regards to a theory of rhythm and its association or identification with dance may have been because Aristoxenus, a part-time Peripatetic at the Lyceum and an expert in music, himself wrote a definitive treatise on the general topic.4 This treatise, On Rhythm, which is now almost completely lost and which apparently employs a slightly different meaning of the phenomenon of rhythm, pertaining more to its temporal and musical aspects than its bodily ones, had in its own sphere as much influence in the Hellenistic period as Euclid's Geometry had in later mathematics. In any event, whether or not Aristotle, out of respect, let Aristoxenus monopolise the systematic theorising about rhythm in general or about 'ordered body move- ment' in particular (or both) or whether the analysis of dance itself was too daunting or uninteresting for Aristotle himself or for whatever other reason, the absence of a detailed discussion of 'ordered body movement' in the extant Aristotelian corpus might lead us when we hear the phrase 'Peripatetic dance' to think perhaps of the so-called Stagirite as depicted in Renaissance art. In that depiction, he practices his pas de chevals with Phyllis on his back (see Figure 1). Nevertheless, given various remarks in the Poetics and the association with Aristoxenus, it might not be too strange to speak of an inchoate Peripatetic dance</page><page sequence="4">156 GREGORY SCOTT Fig. 1.

Let us now recall those remarks and determine what they entail. In Chapter 1, as part of his over-arching goal to discuss the dramatic arts of tragedy and comedy and the quasi-dramatic art of epic, Aristotle distinguishes the three modes of mimesis - means, objects, and manner - that shall be useful in defining those art forms. Mimesis is sometimes translated as 'imitation5, but is better read as it often is, as 'representation' or even 'expression', because Aristotle makes clear in many passages in the Poetics that the plot need not be historical and could be original and fictional. The objects of mimesis in drama, for what it is worth in this essay, are good or bad men in action (Ch. 2), and the manner of mimesis either full enactment, mere narration, or a mixture thereof (Gh. 3). The important mode of mimesis for us, though, is the first, the means, of which there are three for Aristotle. They themselves are briefly discussed in Ch. 1 (starting at 1447a22, the standard Bekker number used in translations):</page><page sequence="5">TWISTS AND TURNS 157 music (harmonia), language (logos), and rhuthmos. The last term, with very rare exception,5 is translated - or rather, simply transliterated - unfelicitously in my view as 'rhythm'. However, as mentioned above and for the following reasons, rhuthmos is better thought of as 'dance' or 'ordered body movement' or 'rhythm but primarily in the sense of ordered body movement'. This is the meaning that we not only find in the Laws but that is implied by Aristoxenus's triad of 'rhythm- izomena' - the materials of rhythm. For Aristoxenus, the materials that can be rhymed or ordered are exactly the three means of mimesis that Aristotle uses, namely, tones (in music), words (in verse), and body movements (in dance), although, as alluded to already, Aristoxenus prefers at least at times to utilise the more abstract, different notion of rhythm for what the three materials have in common, and exploits lexis (word), melos (tune), and kinesis somatike (body move- ment) for the particular manifestations.6 We should note, however, that Aristotle himself, when continuing his discussion of the three means of mimesis and related matters at the end of Ch. 1 and in Gh. 6, identically uses melos in lieu of harmonia and not only meter but lexis in lieu of logos while keeping rhuthmos (e.g. 1447b25) without borrowing kinesis somatike. This not only shows his willingness to use synonyms, probably for stylistic color, but a congruence with both Plato and Aristoxenus, in spite of the shifting vocabulary. Thus, for these and other reasons that are irrelevant for this article,7 the first general correction that needs to be made is that rhuthmos in the Poetics does not necessarily mean 'rhythm' in our musical sense of the word but relates primarily rather to bodily movement. Suffice it to say here that most previous commentators of the Poetics have not translated rhuthmos as 'dance' or 'ordered (body) movement' because they tend not to read completely the Laws attentively and because Aristotle uses the term also in connection with music in Ch. 1 . Therefore, they think that it must have one of the senses it occasionally has in other parts of the Platonic- Aristotelian corpus, pertaining to what music and dance (and verse) have in common, 'ordered temporality' or something similar. What they have missed with respect to the first chapter of the Poetics is that ancient musicians were understood, at least by Aristotle, to make music because of ordered movements, either of the vocal chords or of the fingers or of some other body part. Indeed, he refers explicitly to the inextricability of movements of the mouth for making vocal sounds in Gh. 20 (1456b30-34) and discusses the use of movement by musicians in, for instance, Ch. 26, of which more later.8 Thus, the use of rhuthmos in statements dealing also with music does not militate against the term having fundamentally the sense of ordered body movement for Aristotle. This becomes clearer from his first crucial assertion in Ch. 1 that is unquestionably about dance, an assertion we may now examine. In continuing to explain the three means of mimesis and how they can be used singly or in combination, Aristotle says 'the dancers represent with 'rhythm' alone, apart from harmony' [auto de to rhuthmo [mimountai] choris harmonias he ton orcheston) (1447a26-27). Obviously, if the dancers are using rhythm alone, it is identifiable in some sense with body movement. Also, Aristotle hereby acknowl- edges at least the potential autonomy of dance, because dance could be pure</page><page sequence="6">158 GREGORY SCOTT movement, without any music (or words) whatsoever. It might be said in reply that the commonly-accepted term mimountai - which is only found in some of the manuscripts but which, as Paul Woodruff indicates, seems necessary to make sense of the sentence - naturally involves dramatic import and that Aristotle is still therefore subsuming dance to drama even if no music accompanies it. However, if the term also indicates representations of mere geometrical shapes or other non-dramatic figures then his first words on dance need not be excluding formalism.9 And indeed mimesis (the root of mimountai) has for the Greeks a very broad scope that includes representing inanimate objects and geometrical shapes along with the various animal species, be they on vases or in movement.10 Aristotle's next statement, which follows without interruption the claim that dancers represent with rhythm alone, is the one that readers tend to quote when targe tting Aristotle's view on dance. The Greek is kai gar houtoi dia ton schematizomenon rhuthmon mimountai kai ethe kai pathe kai praxeis (Tor they [the dancers] represent even character and emotions and practices through ordered postures'). Readers rightly understand that, because of this passage, dance for Aristotle is sometimes or often dramatically mimetic, but then also assume that dance must always be histrionic for him, which is incorrect for the following reasons. First, for Aristotle statements are sometimes ambiguous with respect to quantification, as is clear from his logical treatises. To say 'x is y' may mean merely 'some x is y' or 'all x is y\ In saying 'Ducks are brown' and 'Spiders have eight legs', one probably means 'some ducks are brown' and 'all spiders have eight legs' but the context ultimately determines the intention of the author. It is not at all obvious on the surface whether in Ch. 1 Aristotle is saying '(all) dancers represent even character ...' or the weaker claim '(some) dancers represent even character ...'. However, Aristotle at this point in Ch. 1 is only illustrating how an art uses a single means of mimesis, and the context only requires that he say 'some dancers represent even character'. There is no reason to saddle him with the more extreme claim if the weaker and safer one works equally well. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the word 'even' (the first kai) in the phrase 'they [the dancers] represent even character and emotions and actions' is considered by D. W. Lucas, one of the foremost interpreters of the Poetics in the last fifty years, to be 'curiously emphatic' (p. 58). The reason for the curiosity has to do with what this new statement adds to the previous one - that dancers represent with rhythm alone. Because Aristotle is only concerned with explaining the three means of mimesis, and because he had just admitted that the dancers represent by means of rhythm alone, no purpose seems to be served by him now emphasising that dancers represent even character, emotion, and practice if 'represent' necessarily means conveying human life. There seems to be no need for 'even'. Yet Aristotle's words as they stand make perfect sense if- as we have already seen above is the case - 'represent' {mimountai) at least sometimes conveyed no human meaning qua emotion or character, was therefore during those times a</page><page sequence="7">TWISTS AND TURNS 159 purely formal phenomenon, and was known by readers to be purely formal. In this case, any prospective Greek reader of the Poetics would have naturally understood the implication of Aristotle's first statement that dancers represent with rhythm alone (without harmony) to mean that they at least occasionally convey strictly geometric patterns with pure, ordered movement. It would then be sensible for Aristotle to indicate in the next sentence that purely rhythmical postures convey even character, emotion, and practice. Thus, Aristotle's state- ments actually seem to presuppose the purely formal mode that dance can have. Someone familiar with Plato might remind us that in the Laws II (669d) he (via the character of the Athenian Stranger) complains of the senselessness of some musical composers, newer ones of the fifth or fourth century, stating that they rudely separate 'rhythm' and words from tune. Plato is thereby suggesting that dance and music and poetry were then not always being performed together, whereas traditionally they had been. Because he also declares later in the same passage that one cannot make sense of what these purely formalistic developments (at least in music) represent, he declares it, and by implication non- representational art in general, not worth discussing,11 and the charge might be made that Aristotle follows suit. However, Aristotle often goes against his elder even when he uses terms with the same meaning, and there is no statement in the Poetics that commits Aristotle to Plato's position with regards to dance or to the other art forms. On the contrary, statements in Ch. 4 very strongly suggest that Aristotle takes a different path from his mentor with respect to the value of purely formal dance or art in general. There he says that a drawing of something that is unrecognised will not give pleasure because of the representation but can give pleasure because of the accomplishment, colors, or some other such cause (1448b 18). Surely, the other causes could include formal or technical consider- ations. Also, he says in Ch. 6 that if someone painted with the finest pigments, chaotically, he would not give the same enjoyment as one who sketched an image in mere black and white (1450b Iff). Notice that he does not say that the painting (which may have been like our Abstract Expressionism) gives no pleasure what- soever; rather, he suggests the drawing only gives more. Without textual evidence to the opposite, it follows that Aristotle would well grant formal dance the same types of consideration as 'unrecognisable' painting and allow its potential enjoyment even if no likeness to, say, human character was detectable. The foregoing has addressed the issue of whether dance is necessarily mimetic in some kind of anthropomorphic sense for Aristotle. This issue is not quite the same as the autonomy of the art form, however closely related the two topics are, because one might insist that even formal dance should be executed only within a drama and that its inclusion there should be determined by the encompassing dramatic considerations. Hence, a few last words are needed on this second, bifurcated topic. Let us start with the second claim: dance in drama should be determined by the dramatic considerations. In Poetics 1 8 Aristotle stresses that the chorus should be treated like an actor, as Sophocles treated it. Aristotle adds that the choral episodes - which contain the dance - should be interwoven into the fabric of the plot, and not be</page><page sequence="8">160 GREGORY SCOTT extraneous, as they had become since Agathon. Aristotle expressly criticises Euripides at this point in this regard, even though the playwright is praised in other chapters in the Poetics. Clearly, then, any dance to be included in the choral aspect of tragedy (which, according to Lawler, 'as presented in a Greek theatre was probably more like an impressive semi-operatic spectacle than a drama, as we use the word today'12), should help further the dramatic issues, although whether this means that every dance had to be zoologically mimetic (like the choral dances in Aristophanes's The Birds) remains an open question, for what about a chorus that is representing perhaps a wedding dance that itself was purely formal, portraying mere circles? Regarding the first part of our bifurcated issue, viz., whether dance must always be included in drama or whether it could be performed separately: Aristotle never claims this explicitly. Nor does he ever say the opposite. However, statements of his suggest that dance could be autonomous and performed on its own. For instance, I already mentioned that in Ch. 1 he says dancers can 'represent' without words or music. In Poetics 25, in a passage I alluded to earlier, he also says concisely and categorically that 'there is not the same correctness in politics and in poetry, just as there is not the same in poetry and in the other arts' (1460b 13- 15). This almost surely advocates the autonomy of the arts. Aristotle implies that each art form has its own goal or standards, for why else would they each have their own correctness? It appears to follow also for him on the basis of this statement that no art form, for instance drama, should unqualifiedly and always exercise hegemony over other arts, again, given that they each have their own 'correctness'. We have seen that, if one art - drama - happens to incor- porate another, this principle might be qualified, but in a dance that sub- ordinately 'tells a story' he would probably well agree that the dramatic considerations are determined by the primary dance ones. Aristotle therefore implies that dance - just like music or painting or sculpture - should have its own principles and its own aim, although what that is turns out to be very difficult to say for him, because he nowhere discusses the issue in the extant corpus. Of course, the various species of art might share a corresponding high- level aim, such as enjoyment. Music in the Politics and tragedy and epic in the Poetics are given leisurely satisfaction and pleasure respectively as their goals,13 and both satisfaction and pleasure in these contexts are probably equivalent to enjoyment. Dance itself might - and presumably does - have this also as its high- level goal for Aristotle. What I mean, though, is that the low-level goal or goals which dance distinctively has - the advantages and disadvantages it could exhibit, such as not using language so that it is accessible to people from different linguistic backgrounds - is nowhere even hinted at by him. To conclude: none of this insuperably disproves the claim that Aristotle believed dance must be performed within drama. However, without some textual evidence supporting this belief, and given both his statements implying the autonomy of dance and the passages in Ch. 4 that we looked at once before, which indicate that merely formal or technical considerations could give one pleasure, I contend that Aristotle did not hold such a belief. Further evidence for this could be gleaned by</page><page sequence="9">TWISTS AND TURNS 161 looking at music and asking the same question: should it always be performed within drama or not? No statement is made one way or the other in the Poetics, yet who would dare claim Aristotle insists on the former? In the case of music the issue is easily resolved: when Aristotle takes up the subject in the Politics Book VIII, it becomes clear that music can be performed outside of the theatre for him. Actually, there are passages there (especially in Chs. 3-7) that suggest Aristotle is also speaking at times of dance, and in Ch.7 Aristotle acknowledges the dithyramb, which was a frenzied dance that was not done with a drama. However, taking on a more rigorous examination of these issues would swell this essay inordinately, and I think enough has now been said on this subject to put the burden of proof on anyone who wishes to claim Aristotle requires dance (as art) to be performed within a drama. In spite of the lack of discussion of the precise goals of dance in the extant corpus and when and where dance could or should be performed, Aristotle does mention the practice a few times in the Poetics after Ch. 25, and two are worth recalling, because they indicate that dance is important for him whether it is mimetic or not. In Gh. 26 he argues against those (perhaps the Platonists) who claim that epic is better than tragedy, and better because it has less movement or less vulgar movement. His rebuttal is sketchy, and the meaning of the whole passage has been the source of dispute, but Aristotle without question upholds dance. As he states, the complaint against tragedy is actually against vulgar gestures done by particular tragic actors, not against the whole art form. He also recognises that the complaint might be against mere movement. He replies, though, that 'not all movement is to be rejected, unless dance is to be too, but [only] that of inferior [people], such as that for which Callippides was criticised5 (1462a8ff, Richard Janko translation), implying that dance is not to be rejected. Finally, he adds later that tragedy is superior to epic because 'it also has as no small part of it music {mousike) and spectacles, by means of which its pleasures are constructed very vividly' (1462a 16, Janko translation). Unfortunately, in my view, Janko in this last case misses the bulls-eye with the translation of the term mousike, which (as he well recognises in other places) is much broader for the Greeks than our term music, denoting as it often does the arts of the Muses, be they aural arts (singing or instrumental music), history, dance, painting, etc. On my reading, Aristotle is actually using mousike in this wider sense, including dance. To understand this clearly we must pause for a discussion of what he had said in Ch. 6. There, Aristotle includes spectacle along with melos as two of the six necessary conditions of tragedy.14 Melos is almost invariably translated there and in the Poetics as a whole always the same, as song or melody or music, and Janko follows that tradition, making mousike its synonym in Ch. 26 in the phrase now under examination (and I have no disagreement with treating at times the two terms synonymously). However, for reasons that follow, in Gh. 6 Aristotle is actually using melos in one of its other legitimate ways, 'choral composition' involving music and dance, and is praising tragedy in Ch. 26 because it has, along with spectacle, both the aural art and dance and not</page><page sequence="10">162 GREGORY SCOTT just the aural art. Indeed, since epic also had some music in our modern sense of the word - even if it was only a strumming of the lyre by the epic rhapsode - the reason at hand in Gh. 26 for ranking tragedy over epic (because tragedy has mousike) would make little sense if mousike only meant the aural art. Leaving aside this reason, which to me seems powerful enough to carry the argument: Why does melos in Ch. 6 (and mousike in Ch. 26) not mean song or music in the sense of harmony, when that is how Aristoxenus often and Aristotle in Gh. 1 use melos (the latter as a synonym for harmonid)? The short answer is that Aristotle tells us: In Ch. 6, in the sentence immediately after the definition of tragedy, at 1449b29, he explains what the phrase 'sweetened language' means in that definition. He says, according to typical translations: 'by sweetened language I mean that [language] which has 'rhythm' (rhuthmos) and (kai) har- mony and (kai) song (melos). This translation, however, leads to such a redundancy and a puzzle that at least one excellent commentator, Lucas, has suggested excising the 'kai melos': if 'sweetened language' means language that already has rhythm in the musical (or physical) sense plus harmony added to it, which means the language is already song, what reason could Aristotle possibly have for adding yet again melos to the whole mix? On my reading, though, the Greek makes perfect sense: Aristotle is saying: 'by sweetened language I mean that which has ordered body movement (rhuthmos) and (kai) harmony, that is (kai) choral composition (melos)' . He simply uses the last kai in another of its common senses, 'that is', and switches to a primary sense of melos, one that we find listed in the standard Liddell and Scott ancient Greek lexicon. There melos means primarily 'limb' and only secondarily 'song' or 'choral song', the latter being very apt because the tragic chorus sang and danced - in large part obviously with their limbs. All of this helps us clear up a related issue: A few sentences later in Ch. 6 Aristotle uses the term melopoiia - which simply means 'the making of the melos' - and states explicitly that the term is so well understood as to not need explanation. Given the heretofore standard interpretation of melos, readers have assumed that melopoiia means 'the making of the song', but we now see that it really means 'the making of the choral composition (including song and dance)'. This choral composition itself is briefly examined in broad strokes in Poetics 1 2 and in other passages even though Aristotle does not examine in great detail the singing and dancing. We should note, however, that in Ch. 4 (1449a20) he does claim that the early tragedians used tetrameter rather than iambic meter because their compositions were almost exclusively danced rather than spoken, and in Ch. 12 he distinguishes between the stationary songs of the chorus and other, presumably moving types, like the processional (1452b22). There are other reasons why translating melos as mere song in Ch. 6 would contradict what Aristotle says elsewhere in the Poetics, but this takes us too far afield from our immediate concerns, and I simply refer the interested reader to my previous publication on this matter.15 To summarise: when Aristotle says in Ch. 26 that tragedy is superior to epic because 'it also has as no small part of it mousike and spectacles, by means of which its pleasures are constructed very vividly' he means by mousike the full melos, the choral composition including dance.</page><page sequence="11">TWISTS AND TURNS 163 MODERN INTERPRETATIONS So much for Aristotle's views on dance. How, though, have they been perceived by the dance scholars, who have rarely been the same as the classical philologists or philosophers concentrating on ancient Greek thought? As suggested at the beginning, the twentieth-century discussions of those views are, it should be noted immediately, few and far between, and even when complimentary are, I shall argue, in crucial parts mistaken. By 'discussions' I am not referring to observations about Aristotle that occur in a subsidiary role to further other points, as sometimes happens illuminatingly in either dance history or theory, for instance, in Selma Jeanne Cohen's Next Week, Swan Lake. Rather, I am referring to extended treatments that evaluate Aristotle's work itself. Only three germane examples come to mind: Andre Levinson's widely-circulated critique cited before; a comparatively obscure monograph by Joanna Friesen from 1979, Aristotle's Dramatic Theories Applied to Dance Criticism, and Roger Gopeland's 1985 conference essay at the American Dance Critic's Association, Theatrical Dance: How Do We Know It When We See It If We Can't Define It. As also indicated, the two men have similar views about Aristotle and will be treated together. Friesen's essay poses a number of different problems, mostly and ironically stemming from her obvious sympathy for Aristotle and her attempt to show that the dramatic principles in the Poetics are valuable for dance. Let us start with her. Friesen claims that the principles of the Poetics have, or should have, parallel ones in dramatic dances (that is, those with dramatic structures or origins), indicating moreover that the dances will be successful insofar as they follow those principles. She stresses, for instance, the unity of a dance just as Aristotle stresses the unity of a plot, and asserts that the eight types of words in Aristotelian dramatic diction have similarities in the vocabulary of art dance of the twentieth century. I shall, for instance, examine the eight types of words a bit later, but wish to examine the claim about unity. There is no problem with accepting that Aristotelian dramatic concepts might have application to other art forms, although given that Friesen confines the concepts to dramatic dance (like Swan Lake or Giselle or The Moor's Pavane, Jose Limon's choreographic treatment of Shakespeare's Otello, which she cites), it is not surprising that they will apply to some extent. However, the stress on unity is confined to these very general remarks: The poet/choreographer is warned against random or haphazard choices in ordering and portraying incidents and is persuaded to work toward unifying all elements of the drama. A simple thing, such as the handkerchief in The Moor's Pavane, can focus and strengthen a piece with its unifying effect. Aristotle's emphasis and demand for unity above all can guide the artist toward viewing his or her work as a whole; each part must then be chosen and carefully placed within the whole (p. 22). Friesen leaves the issue at that. Nothing with respect to dance per se is offered in terms of unity, other than the suggestion that the appropriate use of a prop, a handkerchief, can provide a continuous thread for the story or the movement or</page><page sequence="12">164 GREGORY SCOTT both (it is not clear which), and that parts should be placed within a whole. Moreover, nothing is said about whether a dance, even one included in a drama, has to have a beginning, middle, and end in the way Aristotle defines those terms in Ch. 7 and which help for him provide the drama with its unity. Are dance- unities of the same exact type, or are they as some choreographers on occasion make them, who, for instance, start a dance with both a certain point in space and a certain pose and finish the dance in exactly the same way, conveying the notion of a circle or of completion (and hence of a unit - something that is whole or complete16)? Moreover, how does, or would, Friesen reconcile her example of the handkerchief with Aristotle's critical remarks in Ch. 14 denigrating the over- emphasis on spectacle and props in drama? Likewise, what makes a part and a whole for a dance? There are many possible answers, but she says nothing about these issues. Leaving unity and props aside, Friesen, as mentioned, says Aristotle describes eight categories of words used in tragedy: ordinary words, foreign words, metaphor, ornamental words, made-up or invented words, lengthened words . . ., curtailed words. . . and altered words. . . . Each of these types of words has a movement parallel which is a familiar compositional tool for choreog- raphers' (p. 18). Friesen goes on immediately to say that 'ordinary words in dance are functional and everyday gestures of affection, of anger, of indication. Obviously, a dance using only ordinary words would most certainly be clear but hardly embellished enough to be considered a dance' (p. 18), all of which means, I gather, that for Friesen ordinary movements on Aristotle's view should be embellished in order to be dance, just as for Aristotle ordinary language should be embellished to be the best dramatic diction. Some problems with all of this, however, are as follows. 'Ordinary words in dance' can be much broader than Friesen suggests with her phrase 'functional and everyday gestures of affection, of anger, of indication', and would pre- sumably include everything from walking, running, standing, and sitting to rolling over, collapsing, bending over, picking up, throwing, catching, and most of the other kind of movement we see in the non-theatrical world. Moreover, 'everyday gestures' - in their incredible permutations - can be the entirety of a dance, with or without embellishment. Some dances - especially those arising from the Judson Church tradition that started in 1964 - make use only of 'ordinary movements', and contemporary choreographers may create fascinating pieces when purposefully restricting their vocabulary to basic movements (omitting, for example, any stylised or unusual movements such as pirouettes), by relying on complex floor patterns or lighting or other compositional devices. They certainly are considered dances, contrary to what Friesen claims, even if they won't win a prize at an international ballet competition and even if Aristotle would not have considered such dances to be the best on the basis of the analogy with diction. However, the conditions of the best dance (or best drama) are not the same as those of 'mere' dance (or mere drama), the latter of which may be suitable in many professionally circum- stances. Friesen unfortunately slides from the issue of definition to evaluation.</page><page sequence="13">TWISTS AND TURNS 165 The crucial consideration here is whether Aristotle would have considered 'ordered body movement' to be dance if it were comprised only of 'ordinary' movements, and there is no evidence in the texts that answers this conclusively. On the contrary, some evidence exists that suggests he would have (e.g. he simply says ordered body movement and does not add a qualifier like 'stylistic' or 'non- pedestrian' or 'unusual'). In short, as the examples of unity and ordinary dance movements, I believe, have begun to show, Friesen falls into at least one of two traps that are related to each other: either applying concepts from one art form (drama) simplistically to another (dance) or supposing that by noting some similarities between two art forms we establish crucial affinities, according to which we can subsequently justify the application of the first art's principles to the second. Yet, with respect to the latter trap, one can always establish similarities between even the most disparate things or aspects of existence. A popular work of art and a piece of vegetation a mile under the surface of the ocean, the vegetation never seen by humans? Both have mass and weight and color and texture. An ancient Egyptian peasant or pharaoh who no longer exists, without even mummified remains, and a mathematical idea from 2004, stemming from Cantorian theories of the infinite? Both have relationships to physical phenomena that occur after one million bce, the mathematical idea stemming from a living, physical brain. Thus, merely capturing some similarities between dance and drama is not necessarily helpful. Because, for instance, Friesen in no way establishes what is essential or central to dance for Aristotle, we cannot determine how significant or superficial her relatively haphazard similarities are between words and movements, and between the other aspects of drama and dance, in spite of the intriguingly creative associations she occasionally makes and even if those associations had been correctly articulated (which, again, is doubtful with respect to her account of ordinary words and ordinary move- ments). None of this is to deny that constructing a worthwhile analysis of movement using eight types of words analogously might be feasible following Peripatetic principles, only that Friesen has not yet properly done it. Regarding the other trap, applying simplistically principles from one art form to another, whether or not similarities have been established: This has been done many times in the past, often with negative results, and a historically-recent case in point is the application of traditional dramatic principles to film after cinema was invented in the late nineteenth century, with undue recognition of the possibilities that the new art form and its relevant media offered. With respect to dance, the type of compositional techniques that should be developed by aspiring choreographers get potentially or actually displaced by dramatic concerns on Friesen's account. This is not to say that those dramatic concerns cannot be important in their own right, if a choreographer chooses to create a dramatic dance, only that within dance there are artistic values that can be separated from the dramatic ones and that are primary: Examples are body shapes and poses, be they of a soloist or group, movement vocabulary and repetition (or a lack thereof), qualities, dynamics, floor patterns, and relation-</page><page sequence="14">166 GREGORY SCOTT ships to any music, to mention just a few traditionally recognised aspects. Moreover, with respect to Aristotle, one negative result of applying his dramatic theory directly to dance - or to any other art - without textual authority is that his aesthetic theory is then held to be weak because the dramatic ideas do not mesh with newer theories developed for the other art forms (one of the most egregious examples of this is still thinking that his dramatic principles are necessarily literary principles, because drama and literature are two different arts for him17). Yet, given his statements already mentioned on the autonomy of the arts, Aristotle never intended the (dramatic) principles to apply to anything else other than drama, and so the criticisms usually are completely unfounded. Indeed, even arts like epic and tragedy that have substantial common principles also have dissimilar ones, and are sometimes contrasted markedly by Aristotle (see Poetics 26). Friesen too often assumes that claims about drama can be trans- posed simply to dance without any argument whatsoever and with hardly any consideration of the acknowledgments of autonomy on Aristotle's part. Perhaps the most elementary mistake that she makes, though, is this: She says Aristotle did not categorise dance as a separate element of tragedy, but simply as an aspect of spectacle' (p. 13). She cites no passage, however, relying apparently (if her bibliography can be trusted) on an English translation of the Poetics that itself never in any way indicates that dance is part of spectacle. She assumes, I gather, that, because dance existed in ancient tragedy, it had to be included somewhere and so she guesses spectacle. Yet, spectacle (opsis), which is very briefly discussed in Poetics 6, really only refers to the masks, costumes, and related effects. Dance or 'ordered body movement' is, as mentioned above, actually one of the three means of mimesis - rhuthmos- given in Ch. 1, and ends up getting subsumed by Aristotle in Ch. 6 not under spectacle but under melos and melopoiia. To conclude: Friesen's scholarship, in spite of some well-placed sympathy in my opinion with the Poetics, too often does not hit the mark. Not only does she leave unexamined the primary Greek texts but she seems to have no real sense of how dance is referred to by the Greeks or how it was employed either in or out of drama. This latter point might have been resolved had she examined the works of classicists who themselves researched ancient Greek dance, but neither her bibliography nor her article shows any awareness of, for instance, two scholars who were arguably the finest researchers of ancient Greek dance of her and their day - and of the twentieth century - Lillian Lawler and Germaine Prudhommeau. (Their major works were published a full fourteen years before Friesen's article.) Clearly, anyone like Friesen trying to suggest, as she herself does (p. 22), how Aristotelian dramatic principles could or should be applied to dance might well have inquired how his theory related to the dramatic and dance practice of his own day. Lawler and Prudhommeau give to my knowledge the most rigorous examination of ancient Greek dance, based on drawings, vase paintings, and textual accounts, and in my opinion their books are de rigueur for anyone researching ancient Greek dance or its related theory at the highest level. Let us now shift to Levinson, and the accusations that he levies against</page><page sequence="15">TWISTS AND TURNS 167 Aristotle. For Levinson, dance is autonomous, which for him necessarily presupposes a formalistic perspective, and in his opinion Aristotle not only refused to accept this view but was instrumental in suppressing it for hundreds of years. The reasons, according to Levinson, are as follows: From the Renaissance onwards, ballet had been inspired by the orchesis of ancient Greece (prchesis also denotes dance, the orchestra was the place where the dancing and music were originally performed, and orcheston was, as we saw above, a term used for 'the dancers' in Poetics 1). However, he says, humanists relied on rhetoricians or historians such as Plato or Lucian for information on ancient dance because the aforementioned work by Aristoxenus along with other treatises had been lost. Levinson further claims that: ... the final authority is always Aristotle, who in the first chapter of his Poetics formulated his ideas of the dance, whose purpose he says is 'to imitate character, emotion and action, by rhythmical movement'. This fatal text assigns to the dance an aim outside of itself and creates confusion between saltatory motion and expressive or descriptive gesture, using the dance as a substitute for words. The dance ceases to be a thing in itself. Aristotle declares that it interprets and imitates life (p. 48, his italics). Levinson never explains why Aristotle is always the final authority, which is curious given Levinson's own acknowledgement of Plato and given the extensive discussion of dance in The Laws. This treatise, which is in many ways admittedly a tedious and lengthy treatment of the institutions and customs of an ideal state, also has, as hinted at above, a number of pages on both dance and dance education that are arguably as compelling as any ever written. They help form the foundation of Western dance theory, although, somewhat shockingly, are not very often directly known nowadays, even by dance scholars themselves.18 At any rate, maybe Levinson, with his statement about the final authority, is alluding to the impact that Aristotle has had on Western aesthetic theory, because of the way Levinson traces that impact on subsequent dance theorists - Lucian, Arbeau, Noverre, Rousseau, and Diderot. Be all of this as it may, he claims that only beginning with Menestrier in 1682 does dance begin to be self-ruling,19 and for him it finally acquires full autonomy in the nineteenth century with Theophile Gautier and Stephane Mallarme, the reason being that for Gautier 'the eternal subject of a ballet is the dance'20 and 'the dance is nothing more than the art of displaying elegant and correct designs in positions favorable to the building up of patterns in line'.21 (Levinson notes that this is the kind of formalism that Noverre advanced in late life, but thinks that it was inconsequential because Noverre's early Letters had already been so influential.) Levinson himself con- cludes that dance is pure function, aligning himself on the side of formalism in the debate against expression that he helps perpetuate.22 As also mentioned, Copeland follows Levinson with respect to whether Aristotle assigns dance an aim 'outside of itself ', although Gopeland can be read as being more complimentary to the Greek thinker, or at least more objective. At the minimum, Copeland eschews the Levinsonian ire. He traces two senses of theatrical dance back to Aristotle - as a synthesis of various arts, exemplified by, say, the Ballet Comique de la Reine23 and as mimesis - and he ends by suggesting</page><page sequence="16">168 GREGORY SCOTT that theatrical dance not only is making a comeback but is inherently more interesting than minimalist formal dance. As he quips: 'Less is not more, but a bore.' However, Copeland also emphasises that Aristotle argues that the purpose of dance is to 'imitate character, emotion, and action by rhythmical movement'. He [Aristotle] thus conceives of dance as a mimetic medium, one obligated to 'represent' the world beyond the immediate limits of the dancer's own body Mimesis or imitation is so central to Aristotle's conception of art that he had very little sympathy for the notion of movement as an end-in-itself (pp. 1-2, my italics). What are we, then, to make of the views of Levinson and Copeland? Both are obviously astute enough to focus on one of the great influences on Western culture and on his words on dance - which is actually something of a rarity in a time when dance history has been apparently perceived by too many twentieth- century scholars as beginning really only with the Renaissance24 - yet they also seem to misinterpret Aristotle in crucial ways, missing, for example, the primary equivalence of rhuthmos with 'ordered body movement' for him. This, again, is not surprising on the one hand because, as indicated, most (but not all) classicists and philosophers also miss it. On the other hand, it is surprising because theoreticians interested in dance cannot afford to relinquish conceptual primacies to other scholars who have little or no interest in the art form (and who actually sometimes have antagonism for it) and there is little excuse for Levinson himself to have missed Plato's use of rhythm as ordered body movement. Moreover, Levinson claims that Aristotle 'assigns to the dance an aim outside of itself', and Copeland adds that Aristotle 'obligates' the dancer, and by impli- cation, all dancers, to imitate human life. However, it should be noted that, in the relevant passage of Poetics 1 , the generally-accepted mimountai is not only in the so-called middle voice but is indicative, so there is no implication of necessity. Aristotle is not saying dancers must represent character, emotion, and practice, and in fact, Janko, another of our foremost commentators on the Poetics, trans- lates mimountai as 'they [the dancers] can represent (my italics)'. To repeat my conclusions from earlier: Aristotle in the Poetics merely focusses on dance used in tragedy, but has obvious sympathies for formal art and dance, and categorically states in Ch. 25 that different art forms have different principles. Moreover, as we have seen, the first discussion of dance in Ch. 1 shows the potential autonomy of dance, because dance there can be pure rhythm (as ordered body movement) without any music or metrical verse whatsoever. Moreover, there is no word in the Greek passages of Poetics 1 for 'purpose' or 'obligation' and hence Levinson's and Copeland's suggestion that for Aristotle the purpose of dance is to imitate is greatly distorting in emphasis. The fact that some performers may represent with dance in a dramatic setting certainly suggests an intention on the part of those performers, but, as emphasised before, the fact does not commit all other dancers to either that intention or that purpose. We now return to a scenario I broached at the very beginning, Phyllis treating Aristotle as - dare I say? - an equine hoofer ('hoofer', of course, nowadays means a tap-dancer). As the story goes, she was not receptive to</page><page sequence="17">TWISTS AND TURNS 169 Aristotle's attentions, and, partly to dissuade further advances, made not only a horse but an ass of him in the garden, where members of the court were hiding to see how Aristotle would lower himself. It may well have been - if the rather far-fetched story is indeed true25 - that Aristotle was justly and suitably embar- rassed at the outcome of this episode. However, one embarrassment that I have argued he himself should not be carrying is the one Levinson saddles him with. Aestheticians are fond of claiming that the emphasis on the autonomy of the arts, and by implication that of dance, goes back to Immanuel Kant. I trust it is clear that the emphasis actually can be traced at least as far back as Aristotle or, perhaps better yet, as far back as the artists of Plato's time, who themselves started disassociating the art forms from one another. NOTES 1. Platonic Idealism is the view that Ideas or Forms are the primary reality, whereas the world of sensation and hence of flux is impermanent and only secondarily real. For Plato, Ideas (not just something in our heads) or Forms are beyond sensory experience, and are Plato's solution to various problems pertaining to problems of sense perception and change. They are also his way of making knowledge possible (in contrast to 'true belief, which for him relates to the world of the five senses). 2. See my 'The Poetics of Performance', 1999. In the soon-to-be-published second edition of the Routledge Companion to Aesthetics, Nickolas Pappas, author of Chapter 2, 'Aristotle', compares accounts of the Poetics and evaluates favorably my solution to the famous problem of catharsis ('Purging the Poetics', 2003). Perhaps surprisingly, this solution was only made possible by recognising the precise meaning of terms such as 'rhythm' and melos (the latter often translated as 'song') and the role of dance in the Poetics. There is little incentive to discuss catharsis here, but I repeat in this essay the crucial points pertaining to those two terms. 3. Laws II, 665a, following the standard Stephanus line numbering. 4.

Imp. rar. 3027, fol. 55; also in hlementa Rhymthica, lib. 2,3.19,1. 16. 7. Treating rhythm as dance continues for a long time thereafter: Aristides Quintilianus, whose dates are unknown, writing as early as the first century ad but perhaps as late as the fourth, says that 'rhythm {rhuthmos) is, in itself, observed in bare dance' (see Mattiesen, Book 1, p. 13, 1. 26). How, or why, for Aristotle lexis becomes a synonym for logos is explained in my 'The Poetics of Performance', p. 29ff. 8. For a more thorough discussion of these issues, see my 'The Poetics of Performance', pp. 23-5, 29-30, and 35-6. 9. Francis Sparshott says Aristotle's Poetics, whatever his detractors say, simply mentions in an aside that dance movement is among the mimetic media and includes the representation of feeling in its repertoire' (p. 475). Sparshott prudently does not say that all dance is among the mimetic media for Aristotle or that mimesis must be of human life, leaving it open here whether Aristotle is only implying that some dance is mimetic or that dance can represent purely formal phenomena. 10. For an excellent treatment of the meaning of mimesis, see Paul Woodruff. 1 1 . This statement may help refute and lay to rest Else's claim that the practice of bare dance did not exist during Aristotle's time (p. 34), although it is possible that only music and verse were isolated. To my knowledge, no one knows nowadays whether 'bare' dance (or even bare dance with only musical accompaniment but no words) was presented in public</page><page sequence="18">170 GREGORY SCOTT performance in ancient Greece. However, it is hard to imagine that artists would not have quickly recognised the possibility once other arts forms separated themselves and were performed individually. 12. Page 29, 1962. 13. It might be argued that catharsis is the goal of tragedy but I argue against this in Scott (2003, pp. 245-8), in part because Aristotle explicitly in Chs. 14 and 26 gives pleasure as the end of tragedy and epic and because of the distinction he makes between catharsis and pleasure. 14. opsis (spectacle) and melopoiia (what I will show should be translated as 'choral com- position') are the last two of the six necessary conditions listed at, for instance, 1450a 10. 15. Scott, 1999, pp. 29-31. 16. For an explanation of unity (and thus 'unit'), see Aristotle's Metaphysics V 6, and of whole /part, V 26. 17. Thus, some apply Aristotle's dramatic principles directly to novels. Interpreters of the Poetics almost always think that the book is about literary theory, that drama is subsumed under literature for Aristotle or that language (linguistically conveying a plot) is the only crucial element. Why this view radically misrepresents him is covered in detail in my doctoral dissertation and in 'The Poetics of Performance' (1999). In short, for him literature has a different nature from drama that merely includes language and that itself could, for instance, have a plot with acting and gestures only. 18. For an example of someone who is indebted to Plato, even if she does not cite him as fully as she might have, see Margaret Newell H'Doubler, The Dance and Its Place in Education (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co.), 1927, notably Ch. 1. As mentioned before, H'Doubler perhaps is the person most responsible for initially establishing dance in universities in America. 19. It is ironic (yet perfectly consistent theoretically) that Levinson thinks the change begins with Menestrier, given that the title of the relevant book is On the Ancient and Modern Ballet According to the Rules of the Theatre (1682) and given Levinson's recognition that the 'learned Jesuit . . . proceeds in accordance with the Aristotelian method' (p. 49). Often change or revolution comes from within a tradition, although whether Menestrier understands correctly and is truly revolutionising Aristotle is an open question that would make a good doctoral thesis. 20. Levinson, p. 52. 21. Levinson, p. 52. 22. Some interesting issues arise from Levinson's interpretation, if it is right. For instance, it might be argued that, in spite of being an aristocrat, Aristotle presents a theory that supports the democratic American modern dancers who stress authentic expression against the artificiality found in the Russian court ballet at the end of the nineteenth century. Be this as it may, it appears that Levinson himself would side with theorists and art critics like Clement Greenberg, Michael Fried, and David Levin, who as a whole stress a historical development of art as inspired by Hegel and praise the purity, anti- theatricality, and so-called 'opticality'of static art like painting and the relevance of these considerations to dance. From this perspective, what is typically called American modern dance is impure and thus less ideal, because it strives for expression of a kind not found in appropriate 'modernist' art. At the least on this line, much if not all American modern dance was and is located at an immature historical stage of development. Thus, when Aristotle is swept aside by the Levinsonian critique, out likewise go Isadora Duncan, Doris Humphrey, Martha Graham, and ballet-choreographers like Michael Fokine, all of whom sought a meaningful representationalism, expression, or symbolism in a significant part of their oeuvre. A curious and ironic spin-off of all of this, however, is that Levinson and company can be seen as ignoring Aristotle's own conception of artistic historical development, articulated with respect to tragedy in Chs. 4-5 of the Poetics, while at the same time praising Hegel's. 23. One of the first works considered a ballet in the modern sense, from 1581. It is not clear to me whether Copeland is suggesting that there were indeed precursors to the Ballet Comique in the fourth century bce. Lucian, who along with Plato wrote one of the only</page><page sequence="19">TWISTS AND TURNS 171 extant ancient treatises on dance, describes pantomimic spectacles in Rome that might qualify as being the first 'ballets' per se. 24. For instance, note the following from http://www.sdhs.org/about.html, the January 2005 website of The Society of Dance History Scholars (SDHS), which was admitted to the American Council of Learned Societies as a constituent member in 1996: 'SDHS defines dance history in the broadest possible terms. The field encompasses the tradition of Western theatrical dance from Renaissance and Baroque court entertainments to postmodern dance theater, the dance traditions of non-Western cultures; and a range of theatrical and participatory dance forms constitutive of popular culture - from country dancing and the waltz to the tango and MTV (my italics).' Naturally, formulating the boundaries as such does not necessarily exclude ancient Greek traditions, but the suggestion is that everything before the Renaissance is unworthy of note, and indeed the (in)frequency of research done by the SDHS members on ancient Greek dance, I venture to say, reflects this attitude. 25. There is apparently a tradition starting with Christianity of impugning an individual's reputation by foisting sexual misconduct upon them - misconduct involving being ridden like a horse. Aristotle may well have been the target of such an ad hominem attack. I am grateful to Nickolas Pappas, who pointed out that James Joyce in Ulysses (Episode 15, the Circe) seems to refer to this story or image. There, Stephen Daedalus says: 'We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.' BIBLIOGRAPHY Castelvetro, L.
