ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM CALL FOR PAPERS THE RELATIONAL PLURALISM OF INDIVIDUALS, TEAMS, AND ORGANIZATIONS Guest Editors: Ranjay Gulati, Martin Kilduff, Stan Li, Andrew Shipilov, and Wenpin Tsai An ancient paradox that has modern relevance is that individuals have multiple selves from which unique identities are formed. From the time of the ancient Greeks up to the present, debate has raged concerning whether to place the emphasis on the plurality of selves or the unitary nature of identity. The psychologist William James (1890: 294) was particularly influential in asserting that a person had as many social selves as there were other indi viduals who recognized the person and carried an image of the person in their mind. The sociologist Georg S?mmel (1955: 150) added further insight with his description of how individuals became unique to the extent that they affiliated with many different, nonoverlapping groups. It is from these influential psychological and sociological sources that we derive the idea for this special research forum. We define relational pluralism as the extent to which a focal entity (whether a person, a team, or an organization) derives its meaning and possibil ity of action from relations with other entities. Be cause of the division of labor, we necessarily have to enter into relations with other entities to accom plish life's tasks (Durkheim, 1984). And this rela tional pluralism brings the likelihood not only of innovation, but also of subversive challenges to the status quo (Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1967: 125). In studying outcomes of relational pluralism such as innovation and shifts in power, contribu tors to this special research forum should consider the ways in which relationships between actors can be characterized as multiplex, heterogeneous, and overlapping. Multiplexity is the extent to which actors are connected by more than one type of relationship (e.g., members of the same department who are also friends). Heterogeneity is the extent to which actors form connections with others from quite different backgrounds (e.g., different ethnici ties or industries). Overlap is the extent to which a focal actor's relationships are clustered in one group or span different groups. Studies are already beginning to examine the phe nomenon of relational pluralism and its implications. At the individual level, work has focused on how individuals develop multiple identities (Pratt &amp; Rafaeli, 1997), but this work has not directly exam ined how these identities shift depending on the con figuration of heterogeneous relations in organization al settings (Mehra, Kilduff, &amp; Brass, 1998). At the dyadic level, we know that the extent to which peo ple confirm each others' identities affects cooperation and performance at work (Milton &amp; Westphal, 2005). But these rich processes of identity confirmation have yet to be explored with respect to conflicting identi ties deriving from heterogeneous relations. At the team level, theories and empirical research have ex amined linkages between social structures and team level outcomes (Hansen, 1999; Oh, Chung, &amp; Labi anca, 2004; Roberson &amp; Colquitt, 2005) but have not explored the origins and consequences of multiple types of interteam relations. At the firm level, there are conflicting arguments about the consequences of relational pluralism, ranging from the recognition that multiplexity in relationships (Baker &amp; Faulkner, 2002) and competitive positions leads to lower com petition (Gimeno &amp; Woo, 1996) to warnings that het erogeneous relations can damage stock market value (Zuckerman, 1999). Consequently, there is more work to be done to analyze the origins and outcomes of relational plural ism. We are interested in work at different levels and work that derives from psychological, sociological, economic, and other traditions. Relevant theoretical perspectives that explore relational pluralism could include social identity theory, distinctiveness theory, leader-member-exchange theory, institutional theory, resource dependence theory, relational demography, the resource-based view of the firm, and social net work theory. Relevant methods could range from the qualitative (participant observation, interviews, case studies) to the quantitative (analysis of text, survey or archival data). We particularly welcome combina tions of methods (e.g., the use of diary data together 914 Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Here is a sampling of possible topics: the dynamics of relational pluralism, including questions concerning how heterogeneity in so cial structure is shaped by cognition, and how individuals and organizations develop multiple identities in their struggle for power and control the emergence of hybrid organizational forms from heterogeneous interdependencies the origins of relational pluralism, including studies of the evolution from relational singular ity to relational plurality the social contexts from which relational plural ism derives, including studies of how these con texts promote or restrict the formation, mainte nance, and recombination of relationships the consequences of relational pluralism, includ ing how heterogeneity and its management affect individual, organizational, and systemic outcomes relational pluralism across levels (individual, team, organizational unit), including questions of how relational pluralism at one level affects the emergence of status and power at another implications of relational pluralism for manage rial practice and public policy For this special research forum, we seek submis sions that capture the richness of qualitative and quantitative data using rigorous methods that con tribute to theory development concerning rela tional pluralism and that open new areas for re search.

Abstract. An abstract of no more than 100 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Back Pages Group references and any appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Use bold face for all three. Main headings (all capital letters; centered) are first. Second-level headings (title-style letters; flush left) are next. Third-level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into paragraph) are next. Don't skip steps: no second-level headings before you use a first-level heading, for instance. Use sec ond- and third-level headings in sets of two or more. Examples: METHODS [1st level] Data and Sample [2nd level] Measures [2nd level] Independent variable. [3rd level] Dependent variables. [3rd level] Footnotes Use footnotes placed on their respective pages. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Phrase it in the present tense. Give it a distinct number (Hypothesis 1) or number letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key techni cal terms. A technical term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Put quotation marks around the first appearance in your paper of each technical term, or define it. Abbreviations. Avoid using them for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names?not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 917 Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Users may print, download or email articles for individual use only.</page><page sequence="5">918 Academy of Management Journal August employees," not "We surveyed = 100 employees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate fit," not "We used a 2 test." Do use symbols and numbers to report results and give formulas. Italicize letters that are custom arily italicized [p, r, b, F, Z, and so forth). Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs, minus signs, etc. Illustrative results within text go in parentheses. Introduce them with complete sentences. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: ? = 0.06, &lt; .05; model 5: ? = 1.06). Keep equations in your running text unless they contain oversized symbols or division, and/or are very important in your research. Examples: Run-in equation?We used Craig's (1992: 20) distance formula (d - xyz). Displayed equation? [?- ( ) ( , Pi[Yt = ytx? =- ?* (1) where Yt is. . . . Define each new term in all equations. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating. Do not use "he" or "she" exclusively. Using the plural? changing "the manager . .. he" to "managers . . . they"?is one solution; using "he or she" ("him or her") is another. Active voice and first person. Write in the active voice ("They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)?Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)?Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)?The author developed three new items. First person (more desirable)?I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Do not describe inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological de tails, such as the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Be concise. Avoid exact reproductions of surveys. Label appendixes "APPENDIX A," "APPENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within ap pendixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Look at tables and figures in published issues of AM/to see preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG URE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and boldface, but in upper- and lower-case letters. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se ries for tables, one for figures). Place them at the end of your manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure needs an introductory sentence in your text. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed. Do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type. Don't use code names and abbrevi ations. Example: Desirable variable name?Profitability Undesirable variable name?PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left cor ners of their tables. Use superscript small letters to designate table footnotes. A lettered footnote may be used to sum marize significance levels: a All values greater than ... are significant at. ... Or report significance levels in separate footnotes placed in a stack under your regular table footnotes. Example: + p &lt; .10 * &lt; .05 ** &lt; .01 More on figures. Figures, unlike tables, have graphics. Make sure your figures will print out clearly so that they can be scanned. Do not use color. Use the same full variable names you use in your text and tables.</page><page sequence="6">2010 Style Guide for Authors 919 Citations These are your in-text, in parentheses, identifi cations of other research. Every work that has a citation needs to have a corresponding reference (see "References," below). Examples: Name and year?Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bern stein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) support this conclusion. Year only?But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) presented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example above. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation?(Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). Subsequent citation?(Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers in citations. Use this format: Writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (Lee, 1998: 3). Citation with no author. For an article with no author, cite the periodical as author. Example: Periodical as author?Analysts predicted an increase in service jobs [Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor porate author" that produced them. Example: Organization as author?Analysts predict an increase in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, 1992). Such sources can also be identified informally. No corresponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation?According to the 1999 U.S. Industrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Com merce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or cor porate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding reference need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Cen sus Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Or der works by an identical author by year of publi cation, listing the earliest first. If the years of pub lication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (separated by a space). Year. Title (Boldface italic, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher.

Scott DeRue, University of Michigan. Sim B. Sitkin, Duke University. Joel M. Podolny, Apple Leadership is one of the most debated and discussed topics in the social and behavioral sciences and receives extensive coverage in the popular business press as well. Those who ascribe considerable importance to leadership have tried to specify a number of ways in which leadership matters to organizations. They argue that effective leadership can make a positive difference in the lives of people, the functioning of groups, and the success of orga nizations. Effective leadership has been shown to enhance employees' satisfaction with their jobs, motivation at work, and task performance. Likewise, effective leadership facilitates team processes, such as learning and adaptation, and has been shown to improve group and organi zational effectiveness. Some scholars have even suggested that effective leadership is essential for societies to progress in positive directions, and without it, the social fabric of our commu nities and organizations would fall apart. Even though there are other business and management scholars who doubt the impor tance of leadership in explaining organiza tional outcomes, business schools as institu tions have taken a strong stand that leadership does matter. One only needs to look at the mission statements of practically any leading business school to see the importance that is ascribed to the teaching of leadership. Consid ered as a whole, businesses, like business schools, seem to regard the teaching of lead ership as fundamentally important. Each year, businesses pledge extensive monetary and nonmonetary resources to leadership educa tion and development for employees. Unfor tunately, there is very little theory and empir ical research to help guide businesses and business schools in the design and delivery of leadership teaching and education. The purpose of this special issue is to ex plore the teaching of leadership, both theoret ically and empirically, and to assess the learn ing and educational implications of different philosophies, designs, and approaches to the teaching of leadership. We encourage both conceptual and empirical submissions that address leadership teaching and education in academic and/or workplace settings. Consis tent with the format of the Academy of Manage ment Learning # Education, empirical and con ceptual articles for the Research &amp; Reviews section, and appropriate material for the Es says, Dialogues, &amp; Interviews section are wel come. Some research questions, issues, and interview topics that contributions might ad dress, among many others, are as follows: Can leadership be taught? What aspects can be taught, and what aspects cannot? What are the criteria and what is the ev idence? What are the desired outcomes in teach ing leadership? What is the process by which teaching leadership fosters skill development and/or behavioral change? How does the teaching of leadership shape individuals' identities as leaders, or their confidence in their ability to lead? What leadership topics are most impor tant to address in business and manage ment education, or in organizational training and development programs? How does the teaching of leadership differ for different groups (e.g., across geographic I_I 922</page><page sequence="10">region, culture, country, industries, disci plines, or demographic groups)? How can the teaching of leadership be tailored to different audiences, including but not limited to undergraduate and graduate students, and adult learners in workplace settings? At what point in their own development are students ready to learn leadership? How should leadership training and development be tailored to individuals' stage of human development? What are the most developmental "teach ing moments" in leadership education, and how can educators or educational institutions deliberately design experi ences that teach leadership and develop more effective leaders? What techniques inside and outside the classroom (e.g., lectures, discussions, site visits, guest speakers, simulations, case studies, videos, projects, and on-line ac tivities) are effective in developing lead ers? What is the relative validity of these different teaching methods and ap proaches? How do these different ap proaches and methods differ in terms of the outcomes they achieve? What is the role of the instructor in teach ing leadership? Are there personal at tributes or characteristics that make for more or less effective instructors in the context of teaching leadership? What are the different approaches to effectively en gaging students in the teaching of leader ship? To what extent and how can individuals develop an ability and orientation toward learning leadership? Can individuals be taught to be more mindful of their own developmental experiences and take more control over their own leadership development? How can educators bridge leadership ed ucation that occurs in business schools with leadership education that occurs in organizational training and development programs? What is the impact of teaching leadership and leadership development on career related outcomes such as student place ment, career success, and/or employee derailment? Are there different developmental trajec tories in the learning and development of leadership, and what predicts them? Submissions should be received by Sep tember 1, 2010, and should adhere to the "Style and Format" guide for authors that can be found at www.aom.pace.edu/amle. Manuscripts should be submitted at http:// mc.manuscriptcentral.com/amle, and desig nated under Manuscript Type as "Special Issue-Teaching Leadership 2011". Presub mission discussion of and consultation on potential submission ideas and topics are also welcome. For further information, please contact the lead guest editor, D.
