Tins is an unusual book. Its title is some- what misleading, since it provides an ex- position of Plotinus but says nothing of the other members of the Neoplatonic school. In fact the author, who is Professor of Hel- lenistic and Patristic Greek in the University of Pretoria, is a wholehearted disciple of Plotinus, who re-expounds him in terms which bring him nearer to the Athanasian conception of the Christian Trinity, the doc- trine of the Incarnation apart. He does not, however, confine himself to the more purely theological aspects of Plotinus, but gives a conspectus of his philosophy as a whole, in- cluding in its range his conception of soul in general, his ethics and aesthetics, and his theory of the mystical and contemplative life. It is in these terms that the main argument of the work is set out in the Foreword: 'I have come to the conclusion that a theistic inter- pretation of Plotinus is not only possible, but even inevitable. The view that the Ideal World is a graded triad is, in my opinion, erroneous. I have found in the three hypo- stases of that Ideal World nothing more than three aspects of one Divine Being.' Pursuing the further ramifications of his theme, the author writes as follows: 'Apart from this [sc. from the anthropomorphic element found in every religion], I can see no profound differ- ence between Neo-Platonism and Christianity except, perhaps, for the particularized in- carnation of the Logos' (p. 66). The strong influence of Neoplatonism on Christianity at an important point in the evolution of its theology is well known, and the word SwTr~d'aTaU itself is witness to a cer- tain measure of affinity between the Neo- platonic Triad and the Christian Trinity. But this does not mean that one can go nearly as far as Professor Pistorius. It is largely a matter of emphasis, but, to begin with the first and main point, an array of passages can be brought to bear against his claim that the three hypostases are not a graded triad: it will suffice to mention ii. 9. I, 9. 3; v. I. 6, I. II, 3. 10-II, 5. 7-8, 9.4; vi. 7. I5. Dis- torting in this way the relations of the three hypostases to each other, he is led also to distort their relation to the sensible world, slurring over the theory of emanation, which is (despite p. 26) very different from the Christian doctrine of creation, in whatever precise form the latter be conceived: cf. ii. 3. 17-18, iii. 8. 4-5, iv. 4. II (ad init.), v. 1. 2. As for Christian theology, it has one ;vrwoara- aL, not three. On both points, however, the trouble seems to spring from a genuine at- tempt to rethink what are, after all, difficult and obscure conceptions. Of Nous the author writes that it represents the transcendent unity of God 'in its teleological nature' (p. 52, cf. pp. 43, 46). 'There is teleology', he writes (p. 44). But he does not make clear the precise manner in which this fits in with Plotinus' conception of the world as ever- lasting and of the relation of time to eternity. Some further elucidation is needed. Again, despite pp. 112-14, it is a far cry from Ploti- nus to the coherence theory of truth as found in the absolute idealism of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The author shows little appreciation of earlier Greek philosophy; his criticisms of Plato are unsympathetic and unhappy (pp- 28-30, 35, 37-38, 90), while he seems to misunderstand Aristotle's (admittedly diffi- cult) theory of the intellect (p. 92). He is equally unsympathetic to other Plotinian scholars, Inge in particular. A. H. Arm- strong, The Architecture of the Intelligible Uni- verse in the Philosophy of Plotinus (Cambridge, 1940), seems to have been unknown to him</page><page sequence="2">298 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW when writing; this is a pity, for reference to it might have saved him from more than one error. But, though these criticisms are serious, this does not mean that the book is devoid of merit. It is, further, well documented with references to the original text. And it pro- vides once more, in a perhaps unexpected quarter, clear evidence of the abiding power of Plotinus to provide men with a powerful inspiration in their thought and their life. At p. 48, 1. I2, read 'discretely'; ib., 1. 13, omit the first 'that'; at p. 86, 1. 23, read 'Timaios'; at p. 90o, 1. 8, for 'place' read 'phase'; at p. iI II, 1. 1o, read 'epistemology'; at p. 140, 1. I, for 'deduct' read 'deduce'. The price of the book is alarming. Jesus College, Oxford D. A. REES</page></plain_text>
