Because it is accessible to non-specialists, Biblical Dan could serve as a supple- mentary text in introductory biblical studies or archaeology courses and could also be useful for study groups in churches or synagogues. Keith L. Eades Upland, CA 91786-3026 YHWH Is the Husband of His People: Analysis of a Biblical Metaphor with Special Ref- erence to Translation, by Nelly Stienstra. Kampen: Kok Pharos, 1993. Pp. 252. ?59.90. In YHWH Is the Husband of His People, Stienstra promotes an awareness that bib- lical metaphors function not only as primitive rhetorical devices but also as crucial cog- nitive keys for interpretation. The book begins with a review of primary theories for understanding metaphor (chap. 1). Stienstra focuses on metaphorical concepts as coher- ent systems of meaning in which the cultural background of a concept serves as a "donor field" contributing to the "recipient field" of the metaphor itself. Stienstra then deals with the theological problem of using human language to describe God (chap. 2) and argues for a careful distinction between anthropomorphic literalism and anthropomor- phic metaphor. She takes to task those who would remake biblical metaphors into their own cultural image, holding that it is better to understand a metaphor's meaning within its unique context. In chapter 3, Stienstra highlights the cultural background for the book's model metaphor through a discussion of marriage and family relations in ancient Israel. She then sketches out the basic metaphor and its many corollaries as it appears in Hosea (chap. 4), and in other books such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Jeremiah (chap. 5). Stienstra finds only hints of the marriage metaphor in the Pentateuch and suggests that the lack of its development there (particularly in Deuteronomy) may argue for an earlier date of composition than normally accorded by modern scholarship. In chapter 6, Stienstra deals with translation theory and takes issue with modem translations that do not remain true to the ancient metaphors. Stienstra's work is painstakingly thorough, and the frequent repetition of pet phrases such as "the titular metaphor of this monograph" is somewhat grating. Though tedious to read, the book provides a helpful contribution to the study of biblical metaphor. Tony W.
