Kelleher Advanced Technology Center Calspan Corporation IN ORDER TO EVALUATE the effectiveness of occupant restraint systems in full scale crashes, with emphasis upon injury to human beings, Calspan Corporation conducted a series of crash tests using both anthropometric test devices and cadavera as human surrogates. Occupant restraint systems chosen to be tested were: the air cushion restraint system (AC RS) which was factory installed in approximately 1000 1973 Chevrolet Impala four door sedans for the General Motors Field Trial Program and three point belt restraint systems (BRS) pro- duced and factory installed in the same type of automQbile. While it is possible to make comparisons from the results of these tests, such as injury mechanisms associated with the air cushion and belt restraints, the results on effectiveness of the two systems should not be generalized outside of these specific vehicles and test conditions. Cadavera, even though they are devoid of muscle tonus and the vital organs and systems are not func- tioning, are excellent human surrogates for the evaluation of the effectiveness of occupant protection systems. It is possible to pressurize the cardio- vascular system, thereby presenting a systemic blood pressure to the organs. Instrumentation similar to that Used in anthropometric test devices can be installed on cadavera, while not in the same location, at least in reasonable proximity to these locations. Finally, complete radiographic studies and a complete autopsy can be performed to evaluate the trauma experienced by the surrogate. As human surrogates used in automotive safety research and testing cadavera present a unique set of problems; they tend to have been at an advanced age upon expiration, it is often difficult to obtain a well defined medical history, other than the cause of death, for the subject, and they exhibit the inherent - ABSTRACT ■ An experimental program is discussed wherein fresh cadavera and anthropometric test devices (ATD) were exposed to identical crash situations utilizing both belt and air cushion restraint systems. Results will include symmetric and one-half offset frontal full size car-to-car tests conducted on the Calspan Vehicle Experimental Research Facility (VERF) at 60 MPH closing speed. Data obtained include head and chest triaxial accelerations from externally located sensors and thoracic accelerations from implanted sensors on the cadavera, normally measured internal triaxial head and chest accelerations and femur loads on the ATDs and belt loads for both cadavera and ATDs. Osteologie data allows comparison between the cadavera regarding their relative skeletal quality. Results of the study allow comparisons of the restraint systems effectiveness with respect to cadaver vs. cadaver and cadaver vs. ATD based 3217 upon autopsy evaluations and acceleration measure- ments. This study was supported by the DOT/NHTSA under Contract Nos. DOT-HS-5-01017 and DOT-HS- 6-01470, prior to 16 November 1977.

KELLEHER variability with respect to stature, weight, and general anthropometry observed in all people. They are, nonetheless, representative of certain segments of the driver and passenger population. The use of human cadavera for medical and scientific research is a well established fact. How- ever, their use as human surrogates in full scale crash test evaluation of restraint system effectiveness is a relatively new and emerging field. Selection and handling protocols, as well as preparation and instrumentation techniques, are continuously being developed and upgraded for the purpose of obtaining more meaningful data from each exposure. Radio- graphic and autopsy studies are also in a continuous state of change toward not only the evaluation of the trauma observed in each subject but moreover, the determination of the clinical significance of the trauma as it would relate to a live accident victim. Further, since one of the primary sources of variability in the clinical results obtained from the use of cadavera in crash testing is the skeletal quality or bone strength of the subject, osteologie study techniques are being investigated in an effort to allow comparisons of results from one cadaver to the next in replicate tests. Because considerable controversy has been generated in the past year over the use of human cadavera for restraint system evaluation, we feel it will also be of interest to address the acquisition, selection and preparation of the subjects used in the work reported in this paper. CADAVER ACQUISITION, SELECTION AND PREPARATION Cadavera used in this test program were sup- plied by, and returned to, the Department of Ana- tomical Sciences of the State University of New York at Buffalo. The subjects had been previously willed to the University for use in medical and scientific research either by the subjects themselves or their next of kin. In addition, a personal inter- view with the next of kin was conducted by the Principal Investigator from Calspan and a represent- ative of the University. During this interview the objectives and techniques of the program were brief- ly explained and a release document for use of the body was signed and witnessed. A licensed mortician (from the University) was directly involved through- out all phases of each test in accordance with require- ments of the applicable laws of the State of New York (1)*. Further, at least one licensed physician (a faculty member of the University) was on site for each crash test involving the use of a cadaver. Final disposition of the cadavera was by cremation, as directed in the willing documents, with the ashes being distributed to the next of kin. *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. Selection - The selection process for acceptance of cadavera as test subjects in full scale crashes is a mul ti -faceted one. The time from death of a potentially usable subject to the actual test date must be kept to the shortest interval possible, commen- surate with the required preparation of both the cadaver and the test vehicles. Upon notification from the University of a sub- ject's availability, the death certificate was re- viewed for the subject's age, cause of death and assurance that no infectious diseases had been diagnosed. This review was followed up by a tele- phone conversation with the attending physician (when possible) and/or the hospital records office (when applicable) for indication of the length of bed confinement of the subject prior to death. Anthro- pometry measurements were also obtained at this time, and a palpation examination was performed by the medical monitor. The Contract Technical Monitor (CTM) was then notified, by telephone, and the pertinent information on the subject relayed to him for the NHTSA's review and preliminary agreement for the use of the cadaver in a crash test. Upon preliminary approval by the CTM, preparation of the crash test vehicles was initiated. As the final step of the selection process, a series of x-ray studies were performed on the sub- ject. Approximately 20 views were taken of each subject for evaluation by a radiologist. In general, the body regions covered were: (1) Head - multiple views (2) Cervical spine - anterior-posterior (A-P), lateral (L-R) normal, extension and flexion (3) Thorax - multiple views including A-P, L-R and oblique (4) Abdomen - A-P and L-R (5) Pelvis - A-P and L-R (6) Femora - A-P. With the exception of the femora, the appendi- cular skeleton was not always x-rayed prior to selection for testing. After selection, this series of x-rays became the pre -impact standard for com- parisons with the post-impact radiographic studies. Based upon the positive findings of the radiolo- gist, final notification of the results were again re- layed to the CTM and agreement upon the date and conduct of the crash test was made. Selection of cadavera for use in this program was based upon, but not limited to, the following criteria: (1) Cause of death (2) Length of bed confinement prior to death (3) Age (4) Stature and weight (5) General appearance as to the overall physical condition of the subject prior to death (6) Pre-test x-rays .</page><page sequence="3">AIR CUSHION AND BELT RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 3219 The death certificates of all of the subjects, ex- cept Caiman* 17, listed the cause of death as either myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac failure or cardiac arrest. Cause of death for Caiman 17 was attributed to the effects of a malignant thyoma. The cardiac related deaths were all immediate (no prior bed confinement) and the malignant thyoma victim had been immobile for approximately three months prior to death. Ages ranged from 27 years to 65 years. In general, the sexagenarians were accepted based upon an evaluation of criteria (4), (5) and (6) in addition, in some cases, to the results of a pre- test osteologie study technique that had been developed at Calspan to determine skeletal quality of potential test subjects. This technique, as well as others investigated are presented in Reference (2) and discussed briefly in a later section of this paper. Eight cadavera were used in nine crash tests. Caiman 6 was used as an AC RS restrained right front passenger (designated Caiman 6A) and again as an AC RS restrained driver (designated Caiman 6B). Fig. 1 presents the anthropometry data obtained on the subjects and is based upon data from Reference (3). Preparation - Caiman 6 and Caiman 8 were ex- posed to these crash tests in an unembalmed state. They were each fitted with a cervical orthopedic collar in an effort to simulate muscle tonus in the neck region. It was planned that the cervical collar would release upon impact of the vehicles, thereby allowing the head neck complex to move in a real- istic manner. The collar did release, upon impact, in Test Numbers 261 and 262 (Caiman 6A and Caiman 6B), but it did not release during Test Number 273 (Caiman 8). It was decided that a different method of muscle tonus simulation in the cervical region should be investigated for subsequent tests. As noted previously, cadavera are devoid of muscle tonus. The problem caused by this lack of tonus is compounded in the unembalmed cadaver by the fact that once the muscle tissue has been mani- pulated (through the movement necessary in prepara- tion, etc.), the tissue has no resilience and becomes flaccid. It was observed that the muscle tissue of embalmed subjects seem to possess some level of resiliency. In an effort to determine if some level of muscle tonus could be simulated in cadavera, a short experiment was conducted using one in-vivo subject and three cadavera; one unembalmed, one fully em- balmed and one lightly embalmed. "Fully embalmed, " in this study, was defined as the level of fixation of a subject as a function of the quantity and strength of embalming fluid normally used for long duration storage of cadavera by med- ical schools. "Lightly embalmed" was defined as the level of fixation of a subject as a function of approx- *Calman is a generic term used by Calspan to designate a cadaver. The number is a serial number.

Fig. 2 presents force vs. de- flection of a 2. 5 square inch loading block in this region. The in-vivo subject was loaded in a muscle re- laxed and muscle tensed mode, on the right arm. An unembalmed cadaver was loaded in the same place on the right arm and it is seen that the force- deflection data fall between the muscle relaxed and muscle tensed data of the in-vivo subject. Approx- imately 24 hours later the loading was repeated at the same location on the unembalmed cadaver. There was essentially no force buildup, as a function of displacement, through three-eighths of an inch. The muscle tissue appeared to simply łłbottom out" at this point. The subject was then lightly embalmed and after approximately another 24 hours the ex- periment was repeated on the flexor carpi group of the left arm.

Again after approxi- mately 24 hours the loading was repeated and the data showed that the force deflection characteristics were similar to those of the muscle tensed in-vivo subject. A fully embalmed subject was picked at random and the loading procedures performed on the right arm at 24 hour intervals. The results were that, as was the case of the second loading of the unembalmed cadaver, there was no appreciable load through one- quarter inch of deflection and then an apparent bottoming. The mechanism of the apparent "bottoming" of the second loading of the unembalmed subject and the two loadings of the fully embalmed subject were ob- served to be different. In the case of the unembalmed subject, the tissue in the loaded area was, in fact, flaccid and presented no reaction force to the loading device. For the fully embalmed tests the tissue was very rigid and once the thin layer of subcutaneous adipose tissue was displaced the muscle presented a high level of reaction force. Based upon the interpretation of the results of this very limited experiment, it was decided to attempt the simulation of muscle tonus in a test subject. The next cadaver available to this program was designated Caiman 11. It was recognized that, in addition to the simulation of muscle tonus in the subject, a well distributed weight increase could be realized by light embalming. Since Caiman 11 weighed 129 pounds (approximately 5th percentile male by weight, see Fig. 1), it was decided that a weight increase would be desirable on this subject. Caiman 11 was lightly embalmed with approximately two gallons of aqueous solution containing one percent formalin and one percent ethyl alcohol. The solution was gravity injected over a two and one-half hour period through the left femoral artery. A weight increase of 14 pounds was measured in the subject. The attempt at simulation of muscle tone in the subject was successful. It was not necessary that a cervical collar or other device be used to hold the head erect in the vehicle. The weight increase placed Caiman 11 at the level of a 20th percentile male for the test. Since Caiman 11 was exposed to a 60 degree lateral crash as an unrestrained right front passenger the details of this test are not presented in this paper. They can be found in Reference (4). Caiman 12 through Caiman 17 were of such stature and weight that an increase in weight appeared inappropriate. However, a simulated muscle tonus was desirable in the cervical region. These subjects were injected in the cervical region and base of the neck with approximately 12 ounces of the two percent solution. These injections accomplished the objective of simulating muscle tonus in this body region while providing a negligible weight increase. Caiman 19 was lightly embalmed overall. TEST EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURES Crash Test Vehicles - For all crash tests full size 1973 four door Chevrolets (Impala and Bel Air) were used. With the exception of Test No. 342, one vehicle was equipped with factory installed ACRS, while the other vehicle was equipped with factory installed production three point BRS. Test No. 342 employed two production ACRS equipped vehicles, one of which had the driver ACRS disconnected and a Chevrolet driver three point belt system installed.

In addition to the accele rome ter packages, the ACRS firing circuit was monitored for time of firing by measurement of monitoring circuit voltage result- ing from crash sensor actuation. This time was determined from time zero, taken as the initial vehicle contact, as recorded using a pressure switch mounted to the front bumper. Factory installed crash recorders in the ACRS equipped vehicles were operated and the crash sen- sors were delivered to the NHTSA for evaluation after each crash test.

KELLEHER recorded during these tests (approximately 60 channels), it was decided that the acquisition of other data was of a higher priority than was that of the femur loads on belted subjects. Subsequently, the program scope was changed, more data acquisi- tion equipment was utilized and femur loads from belted ATDs were recorded. Head and chest orthogonal component accelera- tion time histories were recorded for all ATDs in these tests. Femur compressive force time histories were recorded for certain ATDs as shown in Table 1. ATDs were instrumented according to the require- ments of FMVSS 208 and the signal conditioning for recording and playback filtering of the data con- formed to the specifications of the SAE Recommended Practice J211b. In addition to the accelerations and femur forces, belt loads were measured from the inboard and out- board sides of the lap belt and for the upper shoulder belt. Table 2 lists the types of instrumentation used for ATDs in this program. Cadavera - A description of cadaver instrumenta- tion is presented in References (4) -(8).

It was not practical in this program to mount the orthogonal (triaxial) accelerometers near the center of gravity of the head and upper thoracic (chest) regions of the cadavera as is done with this type of instrumentation mounted in ATDs. For the head triaxial acceleration measurements a "crown of thorns" type device was used. This mounting scheme uses a steel strap that is perforated such that metal spikes puncture through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, as it is tightened, and imbed in the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital bones of the skull. Attached to this steel band was a triaxial accelero- meter (see Table 4). In general, the triaxial package was positioned laterally and superiorly to the right external auditory meatus at the level of the squamous portion of the temporal bone. In the case of Caiman 12, the accelerometer package was positioned on the left side with the same anatomical references. Chest accelerations were measured with a tri- axial package (Table 4) that was mounted upon a two inch diameter by one quarter inch thick teflon disc. The disc was then attached to the cadaveri back at the level of the seventh thoracic vertebra by means of sutures through the skin, lumbodorsal fascia and erector spinae muscle. There was no attempt made, in this program, to measure femur compressive forces on the cadavera. Arterial pressure was developed in the subjects by means of injecting a universal gelling agent (UGA) through an occluding catheter into the descending aorta. The catheter occluded the aorta just inferior to the renal and hepatic arteries so that the abdominal organs (kidneys, liver, spleen, etc.) as well as the thoracic organs and brain experienced an average systemic diastolic pressure of 80 millimeters of mercury at the start of each test and then to what- ever dynamic pressure the resulting crash test occupant restraint loading developed. The pressure was measured by means of a catheterized pressure transducer inserted, through either the right or left common carotid artery, to a point in the arch of the aorta. The trachea was occluded just superior to the right main bronchus by the same type of catheter used in the descending aorta. Air was pumped through the catheter to insufflate the lungs to a static pressure of 0. 25 psig. Dynamic lung pressure developed by the ensuing loading of the occupant by the restraint sys- tem was measured by connecting the catheter to a pressure transducer just prior to the start of the test. Chest anterior-posterior (A-P) deflection at a point was measured by a Calspan developed caliper type chest deflec to meter. This device consists of a posterior plate formed to the contour of the cada- vers shoulder and back, upon which are mounted a rotary potentiometer and a hinge. The shaft of the potentiometer is the hinge pin and it is rotated when the subjects sternum undergoes an A-P motion relative to the thoracic spine by means of a front arm that extends from the hinge to the superior-in- ferior mid point of the sternum. The deflectometer output was calibrated for signal output as a function of chest A-P deflection for the length of the front arm member required to accommodate each subject. Starting with Caiman 12, ten accelerometers were implanted about the thoracic cage of the cada- vera prior to testing. These accelerometers were attached through special mounting fixtures to the sternum, bilaterally on the fourth and eighth ribs on the mid axillary line and to the spinous processes of the first and twelfth thoracic vertebrae.

In addition to the above mentioned instrumentation, Caiman 14-Calman 19 were implanted with an accel- ero meter mount on the second sacral vertebrae (S-2). PROCEDURES The full scale crash test unit of Calspan's Ve- hicle Experimental Research Facility (VERF) was used for these tests. This unit consists of an 800 foot long by 8 foot wide concrete track with a center guide rail and an 800 horsepower towing capability. Both vehicles were towed from opposite ends of the track (laterally guided by rollers on the center guide rail) to meet at the mid point. The tow cables were released by a trip mechanism located approximately two feet before impact. Four ground-based (Photosonics Type IB) and six vehicle-based (Stalex Type WSICE) 16 mm high speed movie cameras were used to record the events of the crash tests in this program. These cameras, using Eastman Kodak Ektachrome Type 7241 daylight (ASA 160) film were operated at picture-taking rates of 1000 to 1500 pictures per second. In addition, an Arriflex 16 mm ground-based camera was used on all tests for real time and documentary coverage. On- board cameras were mounted on the driver and right front passenger doors, viewing through the respective windows, and on the rear package shelf, viewing for- ward. The relatively short time duration of an automo- bile crash, as well as the rapid occurrence of events, establishes the requirements for a high frame rate and good optical system resolution. A film speed of 1000 pictures per second has been demonstrated to be adequate for recording most impact events. Red Lake Laboratory timing-light generators supplied film-edge timing marks to the high speed cameras at a rate of 100 pulses per second. Actual frame rates for the high speed cameras during the event were determined by counting the number of frames between these timing marks. All high speed cameras were given a one second prestart so that a steady frame rate was established before the event. A small strobe-flash unit was mounted in the field of view of each camera. These strobe-flash units were triggered by a pressure-sensitive switch</page><page sequence="8">3224 M. J. WALSH AND B. J. KELLEHER attached to the front bumper of each car and indicated initial bumper contact, time zero. The ground-based high speed cameras were positioned on the right side and left side, viewing normal to the impact direction and overhead normal to the impact direction. The fourth camera was mounted overhead at a 45 degree angle to the impact direction. All data were recorded without being filtered to ensure maximum information content for data inter- pretation. After each test the tape-recorded data were replayed from real time onto Calspanłs COREC analog-to-digital conversion system at a recording speed of 4:1. Expansion of real time by a factor of four, combined with the sampling rate capability of COREC provide an effective sampling rate of up to 12,800 samples per second per channel; a rate con- sistent with SAE J211b channel class 1000 bandwidth requirements. Head acceleration data were then filtered using channel class 1000, chest acceleration using channel class 180 and femur load data using channel class 600 in accordance with requirements set by J211b. Vehicle accelerations and belt loads were filtered at channel class 60. Several data reduction and analysis programs were processed on a IBM/360/165 Digital Data Reduction System (DDRS), including computation of acceleration vector magnitudes, head and chest severity indices, Head Injury Criteria (HIC) and various velocity and displacement time histories based on single and double integrations of selected acceleration measurements. In addition to the injury criteria, the DDRS provided scaled plots of acceler- ation, velocity and displacement time histories and appropriate dummy and cadaver data. The injury criteria used in this study to evaluate restraint performance for ATDs were obtained from FMVSS 208 requirements. These injury criteria in- cluded (HIC &lt; 1000, CSI &lt; 1000, chest CR &lt; 60, and femur load &lt; 2250 pounds). Where applicable, these criteria were also used for the results of the cadaver mounted instrumentation. The positioning of the head and chest ac cele rome te rs (discussed previously) on the cadavera was considerably different than the positioning of these accelero me ter s in the ATDs. The accelerations recorded from these externally mounted units tended to record higher levels than the normal internally mounted units in an ATD when both were used on the same ATDs (9). Therefore, the accelerations, HIC and Cr obtained from the cadavera may provide a conservative or more critical evaluation of the performance of a restraint system than ATD data. Autopsies and/or radiographic studies, in the case of Test No. 261, performed after each test formed the basis for assigning each cadaver an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) rating (10). While it is understood that the FMVSS 208 injury criteria values are applicable only to 50th percentile ATDs, for a point of reference, these values were used for the 5th and 95th percentile ATDs as well as the cadavera. RESULTS Results of the cadaver and anthropometric test device experiments are summarized in this section.

Cadavera HIC values are above the HIC values</page><page sequence="12">3228 M. J. WALSH AND B. J. KELLEHER for ATDs of a comparable size for both types of restraint systems. This could be because of the differences between accelerations recorded from externally mounted instruments on cadavera and those recorded from internally mounted instruments in ATDs, in conjunction with the more compliant nature of the cervical spine and neck muscles (allow- ing more head motion) of the cadavera compared to the stiffer rubber necks of the ATDs. Chest resultant accelerations for the cadavera exposed to both restraint systems fall very close to the trend lines for their sizes and respective re- straint systems, as do the values for the CSI. Fig. 6 shows that there is not an appreciable scatter in the ATD injury criteria data as a function of subject percentile where more than one data point was obtained. Further it shows that cadavera per- formance is very close to ATD performance in the chest region and they may provide a more conserva- tive evaluation of the effectiveness of the restraint systems. It also shows that although AC RS results are somewhat higher, there are no significant dif- ferences in the level of effectiveness between the two restraint systems for right front passengers. Fig. 7 presents the injury criteria data for the ACRS and BRS restrained drivers in the symmetric frontal collisions. HIC, chest resultant acceleration and CSI are presented as a function of human surrogate percentiles. The head of Caiman 12 made contact with the steering wheel. The 5th percentile BRS restrained ATD did not make head contact. This is probably a contributing factor to the 2. 5 times higher HIC for Caiman 12 than that experienced by the BRS re- strained ATD. The ACRS restrained 5th percentile ATDs show a wider scatter in HIC values than other ACRS re- strained ATDs. For Run Number 301, the right front passenger was a 95th percentile ATD. In order to accommodate the 95th percentile right front passenger the bench seat had to be placed in the rear position. Test Number 342 on the other hand carried a 5th percentile ATD as the right front passenger and the seat was in the forward position. This difference of approximately 5 inches could account for the high- er accelerations experienced by the driver ATD in Test Number 342, thereby causing the higher HIC. With the exception of the HIC values for the 5th percentile ACRS restrained ATDs, Fig. 7 shows that there is no appreciable scatter in the injury criteria data as a function of subject percentile where more than one data point was obtained. As was the case for the right front passenger, it is also demonstrated that cadavera performance was very close to ATD performance withrespect to the chest injury criteria, and there are no significant differences in the level of effectiveness between the two restraint systems for drivers.

Caiman 8 displayed an un- displaced sternum fracture along with two fractures to rib R2 one-half inch lateral to the cosotchondual junction and one fracture of rib R6 at the costochon- dral junction. Left ribs L5 and L6 were fractured four and one-half inches and five inches, respectively lateral to the mid-sternal line while rib L8 was frac- tured at the costochondual junction. There was a complete, fragmented, slightly displaced fracture of the right clavicle. Caiman 12 suffered three rib fractures; right ribs R3 and R4, both complete and undisplaced four and one-half inches lateral to the mid-saggital line and left rib L3 complete and un- displaced three and one-half inches lateral to the midsaggital line. It is believed that the pre-test observed sternum fracture and one suspected rib fracture on Caiman 8 would not have contributed significantly to the other rib fractures and certainly not to the clavicle fracture. While all three subjects autopsied were assigned an AIS rating of 3, severe (not life threatening), it should be noted that most clinicians to not consider two or three undisplaced rib fractures to be serious. On the other hand, a displaced, fragmented clavicle fracture could be serious if for no other reason than its proximity to the subclavian artery. In the case of Caiman 8, the the subclavian artery was not affected. There was no soft tissue nor organ trauma observed in these subjects and no evidence of pneumo or hemo-thorax. Fig. 8 presents the injury criteria data for the ACRS and BRS restrained right front passengers on the involved side (passenger to passenger hit) in the offset frontal collisions. Only 50th percentile ATDs were used in the offset tests, hence, there are no trend lines, as a function of percentile, displayed. The lack of trend lines notwithstanding, the data with respect to HIC values obtained from the cada ve ra and the ATDs are in reasonable agreement and all within FMVSS 208 limits. Chest injury criteria, with the exception of Caiman 16, are also in agree- ment and within FMVSS 208 limits. Results from Caiman 16 will be ignored for the moment (this subject presented a unique situation and will be dis- cussed later). Fig. 8 shows that, as was the case in the symmetric frontal tests, there are no signi- ficant differences in the level of effectiveness be- tween the two restraint systems for right front passengers on the involved side of the offset frontal crash tests. Fig. 9 presents the injury criteria data for the ACRS and BRS restrained drivers on the involved side in the offset frontal collisions. There is a wide spread in HIC values between the ACRS restrained cadaver and ATD while the values of this injury criterion for the BRS restrained subjects are in close agreement. Chest injury criteria show close agreement between the cada vera and ATD 1000« 1 Î r t 1 ! : i j ! 800 ' j I j j I [ j j I CC i j ! I j ļ i ļ : j m 600 ' ' î i j I i' '* i i 2 i CM17 BRS • !

Table 18 presents a comparison of the injury criteria for the cada ve ra in the four positions, ACRS passenger, BRS passenger, ACRS driver and BRS driver. Since all observed trauma in the cada vera were not in the same body region, as they were in the case of the symmetric frontal tests, Table 19 is included to present the AIS values by body region. Complete radiographic and autopsy reports for these subjects are presented in References (11) through (15). A brief summary of the post-impact trauma is presented in this paper. Caiman 16 sustained one complete undisplaced fracture of right rib number 3. Also observed were prominent comminuted fractures of the right and left tibia and fibula proximally and distally. The right femur also displayed a fracture extending from the inferior margin of the greater trochanter on the left distally to below the level of the lesser trochanter.</page><page sequence="14">3230 M.

It is assumed that a major tear was artifactual and secondary to organ removal. However, it is not possible to rule out completely some capsular damage as effect of the crash test. The spleen was slightly enlarged and very soft. Caiman 19 also sustained an undisplaced spiral fracture of the right tibia. Caiman 17 displayed no trauma in the post- test radiographic and autopsy studies. Caiman 15 sustained three rib fractures. Ribs R5 and R6 in the anterior axillary line displayed com- plete, displaced vertical fractures while in the same line the fracture of R8 was complete and undisplaced. Caiman 14 displayed no trauma in the post-test radiographic and autopsy studies. Since most cadavera available for research are of advanced age, or have been confined to bed for some period of time before expiration, a major con- cern in evaluating the results of their use in crash tests is the comparability or relative quality of the subjects. Reference (2) describes, in detail, four techniques for determining the level of osteoporosis in cadavera. Two of these techniques are pre-test methods and two are post-test methods. Because these techniques for determining skeletal quality were emerging through the course of the work reported in this paper, not all of the sub- jects were pre-test evaluated. Figs. 10, 11, 12 and 13 present the data on relative bone quality of the cadavera used in these tests. Fig. 10 presents radiographic analysis of the average percent cortical areas (PCA) of the mid-shaft of both right and left femora, while Fig. 11 presents the average measured PCA of the right and left radii. Both of these techniques are pre-test methods. Fig. 12 presents the parabolic index (a figure of merit) determined by measurements taken on ribs and Fig. 13 presents the modulus of elasticity de- termined for ribs by the fourth technique. These are post-test methods. While some variation in ranking is evident in the four techniques used to evaluate the skeletal quality of these eight subjects, all of the methods demon- strate that Caiman 16 was an osteoporotic subject. The results of the rib tests indicate that, in fact, he was extremely so. As pointed out earlier, some of the subjects were selected based, in part, upon the results of the pre-exposure osteologie studies. At the time of Caiman 16 Ts availability the pre-test methods were not yet as well accepted as they later were. There- fore, the pre-test long bone evaluation was not per- formed upon this subject. Caiman 8 also is demonstrated by these tech- niques to be of low skeletal quality. The rest of the subjects fall within (or close to) one standard devia- tion of the mean for normal subjects.</page><page sequence="15">AIR CUSHION AND BELT RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 323 1 loo i ¡ ¡ ¡ "í i i r !

For the frontal symmetric, 60 MPH closing speed tests in 1973 Chevorlets equipped with produc- tion air cushion restraint systems and belt restraint systems, both the cadaver and ATD results indicated that satisfactory levels of protection were provided for the full range of adult occupant size. 2. Where comparisons could be made in these symmetric tests, cadaver and ATD results were generally in good agreement with each other. 3. Neither the cadaver nor the ATD results, in these symmetric tests, showed any clear indication that either the ACRS or the BBS was superior or that either produced significantly different results for varying adult occupant size in the 5th female to 50th male size range. For the 95th male size in some cases higher results were reached. 4. For the frontal offset, 60 MPH closing speed tests the cadaver results (with the exception of Caiman 16), based upon radiographic and autopsy studies, indicated that satisfactory levels of pro- tection were provided by both systems. 5. Where comparisons could be made in these offset tests, cadaver and ATD results were not generally in as good agreement with each other as were those in the symmetric frontal tests. 6. The injury criteria values determined in these tests from the cada vera used as human surrogates tend to present a more conservative or critical evalu- ation of the effectiveness of a restraint system. 7. Pre-test osteologie studies should always be performed as part of the selection process to pre- clude the utilization of low skeletal quality cadavera, NUMBERS REFER TO CALMAN DESIGNATIONS 80 ļ ļ 1" ; ' "I r r r r yr , Í ' i /t- • i GRANIK&amp; : ; .i 70 : *1 I STEIN MEAN : ¿ Or i i- i- ;&lt;P- " 120 i : ! 15C : ! : : 10 I : 60 Or i- i- ř ;&lt;P- - ; ; : : : : . : i i i j 14 i ; : ; 18Ç ; _ 50 -i -j + i- 8 O 'r j. j.
