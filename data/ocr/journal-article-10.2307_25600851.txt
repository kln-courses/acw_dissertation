<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELLEN BROWN HERSON Oxymoron and Dante's Gates of Hell in Shelley's Prometheus Unbound If poets, as shelley concluded in his Defence of Poetry, are the unac knowledged legislators of the world, then poetry is law and rhetorical devices its unacknowledged executors. Shelley's famous equation gains force by way of the use of oxymoron, the combination or identification of seemingly contradictory or incongruous things. There are over three hundred oxymorons in Prometheus Unbound, a play of 2,610 lines.1 The frequent occurrence of such an obstreperous device calls for a rhetorical reading of Shelley's most comprehensive poem, as well as a more careful look at oxymoron itself. Such a reading is an attempt to unearth rather than deconstruct the poem, through an examination of the rhetorical foundation upon which the elusive dramatic structure of Prometheus Unbound is built. This excavation also leads to a more complete disclo sure of the crucial function of Dante's inscription over the gates of Hell (Inferno 3.9) in Shelley's text. Oxymoron is mind-boggling. It is powerfully both extra-sensory and extra-rational because its incongruous combination of images and ideas forces us to feel and think beyond habitual experience and outside the consistent structures of language and thought. Consider these examples from Prometheus Unbound. Some are more or less abstract, more or less non-sensical; all express relations fundamentally inexpressible except through oxymoron: barren hope (1.8) burning cold (1.33) shapeless sights (i-36) i. The count of 326 oxymorons, and all quotations from the play, are taken from The Complete Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, ed. Thomas Hutchinson (New York: Oxford UP, 1943) 206-69.

Oxymoron is strained both in concept and representation, thereby reinforcing the conformity of these two aspects of language, but providing no reference to a reality distinct from the linguistic figure. Thus the initial impression with oxymoron is one of falsehood or catechresis. The "indirection" (Brooks) of paradox becomes nondirection, or reflexive cognition?the recogni tion of language itself as a controlling structure of thought?in oxy moron. It could thus be said to be the poet's poetry. Or, put another way, oxymoron begins where paradox leaves off. The best definitions of oxymoron are found in poetry, and quite often, in poetry dealing with the theme of marriage. Shakespeare's "The Phoe nix and Turtle" mourns the death of a unique pair of lovers. So they loved as love in twain Had the essence but in one; Two distincts, division none: Number there in love was slain. Hearts remote, yet not asunder; Distance, and no space was seen Twixt this turtle and his queen; But in them it were a wonder. Reason, in itself confounded, Saw division grow together, To themselves yet either neither, Simple were so well compounded; That it cried, "How true a twain Seemeth this concordant one! 2.

(25-48) This binary system characterized by a "married chastity" (61) is a flesh ing-out of oxymoron, in which, as in Donne's verse-letter to his wife, "Valediction: Forbidding Mourning," the "twin compasses" of two en tities that are one and yet not one, move in unison and mutual influence, but are strictly held apart in accordance with the realities of distance and difference. The cosmic action of Prometheus Unbound turns on the marriage of Prometheus and Asia. Shortly after his liberation from Mount Caucasus, Prometheus addresses Asia, Panthea, and lone with words fit to define the oxymoronic figure. What in Shakespeare and Donne referred im plicitly to the marriage of language and its objects and explicitly to the marriage of lovers, in Shelley is the conflation of romantic, social, and poetic concerns. We will . . . make Strange combinations out of common things . . . Weave harmonies divine, yet ever new, From difference sweet where discord cannot be. . . . (3.3.30-39) Oxymoron is the strange yet beautiful child of metaphor and paradox? like Demogorgon, stronger than either of its parents. It is thus an apt device for a poet with the imaginative ambition of Shelley, whose project in Prometheus Unbound is to envision "a heaven where yet heaven could never be" (4.165). We need not ask whether Shelley's use of oxymoron was conscious or borrowed; it pervades his poetry on all levels: rhetor ical, dramatic, imagistic, thematic, and structural, and is thus for him as choiceless as seeing with one's own eyes. Oxymoron is not the product of Shelley's vision; it is the very organ of his unique insight. As a result, the many overlapping genres and patterns in Prometheus Unbound fall into two seemingly conflicting but crucially linked cate gories: those that are dual, reflexive, and non-progressive, such as the tragic mode, the chiasmus, and the Jupiter-Prometheus negative likeness; and those that come in threes and are suggestive of journey, the trini tarian "elemental synaesthesia" (defined in this essay), the comic and romance modes, and the Dantean epic. Shelley's "lyrical drama" is a generic oxymoron at the most abstract level: as a drama it contains both tragedy (that of Jupiter and the recalled Promethean downfall) and com edy (the Promethean turning point in Act 1 and the cosmic peripeteia in Act in); as lyric it is both progressive, as a realization in verse or song</page><page sequence="4">374 ELLEN BROWN HERSON of a higher truth, and static, since as a song it evokes the sense of the complex wholeness of involved oppositions and portrays no single emo tional thrust. As an epic it is both Dantean and Miltonic.3 The co extension of varieties of opposed models and structures conveys the most fundamental oxymoron of the play, that of Shelley's unique "skep tical idealism. "4 Like Panthea and Asia, who in the ascent of Act n "sail on, away, afar, / Without a course, without a star" (2.5.88-89), Shelley has no star or distant heaven by which to orient his poem, other than the tyrannical heaven (and literary precursors) he wishes to supersede. The oxymoronic journey of Prometheus Unbound is a journey toward perfection without a single reference point for perfection, a path without an ultimate goal, a theodicy without a god.5 Poetry is the prime mover here, the force of primordial love and justice. As such it displaces heaven rather than justifying it or enabling a movement toward it. Poetry restructures the cosmos, rather than merely representing a passage through it. Shelley's blatant and adversarial reinscription of the Dantean maledic tion "All hope abandon, ye who enter here" (Inferno 3-9),6 has belied 3- See Stuart Curran's discussion in "The Siege of Hateful Contraries: Shelley, Mary Shelley, Byron, and Paradise Lost," Milton and the Line of Vision, ed. Joseph Anthony Wittreich, Jr. (Wisconsin: U of Wisconsin P, 1975) 209-30; and Shelley's Annus Mirabilis: The Maturing of an Epic Vision (San Marino, California: Huntington Library, 1975). 4. Earl Wasserman's Shelley: A Critical Reading traces the movement in Shelley's poetry from a dialectical skepticism to an idealism not divorced from skepticism (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1971). Stuart Curran conflates both impulses in the "Skeptical Ideal ism" chapter of Shelley's Annus Mirabilis. 5. The term "theodicy" has taken on a double meaning. Traditionally it is a justification of God's ways to man as in Paradise Lost. In recent years, Reeve Parker, in Coleridge's Meditative Art (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1975), has used the term not to mean a vindication of divine attributes, but rather a journey toward God or perfection, a spiritual heightening, i.e., "theodyssey." The later sense is more aptly applied to the Commedia than to Milton, but in Shelley's "anthrodicy," both meanings are of interest. 6. All quotations from the Commedia are taken from the corrected edition of the Henry Francis Cary translation, The Vision: or Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, of Dante Alighieri (London: George Bell and Sons, 1877). Cary's translation of the Inferno was first published in 1805-1806 along with the Italian text (Preface to 1814 edition, v.). Cary explains that the translation of the Purgatorio and Paradiso, appearing in 1814, were not accompanied by the Italian text, since complete editions of the original Commedia had appeared in England in the meantime. Shelley's sense of the original text, judging from his allusive renderings in Prometheus Unbound, is often closer to John D. Sinclair's, whose prose translation and Italian text will be quoted after Cary's text. (The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, 3 vols. [1939 rpt; New York: Oxford UP, 1975]). Shelley's treatment of Dante's text was influ enced by his reading of Cary, as will be evident from later discussion in this essay. Note the proximity of canto/act and line/scene placement of the quoted passage between Shel ley's and Dante's texts.</page><page sequence="5">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 375 his profound imaginative debt to the poet of a religion he so much abhorred. Critics, understandably shying away from the obvious, have had nothing specific to say about Shelley's very pointed, dramatic, and literal use of a very pointed, dramatic, and literal moment in the Inferno.7 In fact, Shelley's reinscription is embedded in a subtle and comprehen sive rewriting of the Inferno into a redemptive poetic structure loosely modelled on the three cantiche of the whole Commedia* This rewriting is effected by a drama which is "inscribed" on the play by means of a series of reflexively related dramatic lines which center in Act in on the "recalling"?both remembering and retracting?of the infernal curse. (These passages will be outlined and discussed in detail in the latter half of this essay.) The recalling of the Dantean curse is the work of the 7- Stuart Curran cites similarities between Act i and the Inferno in "The Siege of Hateful Contraries" 217, and posits the "recapitulation" of the "Dantean journey," stating that Shelley "reverses the cosmic model of Dante: at the center is not a Satanic monster frozen in its denials but the creative spirit of man" (Shelley's Annus Mirabilis 201). Curran's reading of Dante in Shelley is primarily influenced by the Miltonic Jehovah/Satan polarity which he sees at work in Shelley. Steve Ellis focuses on the Dantean parallels in "Shelley, Dante, and Freedom" Dante and English Poetry (New York: Cambridge UP, 1983). But as he relies almost exclusively on the resemblances between Shelley's fourth act and the Paradiso, no convincing reason is given for Shelley's use of Dante. Neither Curran nor Ellis has broached in these writings the subject of Shelley's quotation from the Inferno in Act in. 8. Close textual links can be found between Act 1 and the Inferno, Act 11 and the Purgatorio, and Acts in and iv and the Paradiso. Act 1 opens in an icy ravine, reminiscent of the depths and final frozen barrenness of the Inferno, which opens "in a gloomy wood" (1.2; Sinclair; "per una selva oscura" ["within a dark wood"]). In Canto m there are the "alternate frost and fire" of Act 1 (268), "in fierce heat and ice" (82; Sinclair 87: "in caldo e'n gelo" ["into fire and frost"]). In Canto ix of the Inferno the furies appear which are dominant in Act 1 of Prometheus Unbound. There are no furies in the Aeschylus tragedy. Act 11 opens at morning in "a lovely vale," with the appearance of Asia. The Purgatorio opens at dawn, on earth, with the appearance of the planet Venus. There is the likelihood of a parallel between Asia and Beatrice. Beatrice is "unveiled" in the Purgatorio (31.136). During Asia's ascent in the fifth scene of Act 11, her presence as the "radiance" of love is "unveiled" (16-20). Also Asia intercedes with Demogorgon on behalf of Prometheus from the same motivation as Beatrice in her intercession with Virgil, "Love brought me thence, / Who prompts my speech" (Inferno 2.72-73; Sinclair 73-74: "amor mi mosse, che mi fa parlare" ["Love moved me and makes me speak"]). Of course Act m opens in heaven, but in an unsatisfactory one, and thus a fourth act is needed to create "a heaven where yet heaven could never be." Cantos xxv, xxvi, and xxvn of the Paradiso are on hope, love, time, and eternity, themes prominent in Acts m and iv. And finally, while the word "heaven" occurs many times in Prometheus Unbound, the word "Paradise" occurs only once, in Act iv (128). While this Paradise is in a new human realm, it is clear from the chorus' songs (4.129-78) that it is not a garden from which humankind can be excluded. This Eden, encompassing "the depths of the sky and the ends of the earth" (4.130), is contiguous with the universe.</page><page sequence="6">376 ELLEN BROWN HERSON entire drama, anticipated by the recalling of the Promethean curse in Act i. Shelley's "inscribed" drama provides a commentary on the relation ship between opposed extremes in general, but more specifically, on the relationship between rhetoric and intent, between the spoken and the written word, between language and its objects, between the poet writers of the past and the poet-readers of the present?a relationship that suggests an oxymoronic marriage of diverse elements. While struc turalism assumes a preconscious unity of disparate parts, or a premarital romance, deconstruction severs their relations in the no-fault divorce known as non-referentiality. Oxymoron points beyond either view? the one of structure as the key to all experience and language as the ultimate structure, the other of language as referring to nothing but itself?by forcing both into a single perspective. Shelley's view of lan guage is bi-focal, as the view of any boundary must be. Oxymoron manifests that boundary between the expressed and the unexpressed, the known and the unknown, thought and non-thought. Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mir rors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they understand not; the trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what they inspire; the influence which is moved not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world. In addition to the general oxymoron, Shelley uses five subtypes of oxymoron. Three of these are defined in literary lexicons: antithesis, the "opposition of ideas emphasized by balance of sharply opposite words," syneciosis, "two contraries affirmed of one subject," and synaesthesis, a "psychological oxymoron, " in which the perception of the beautiful is characterized by "a harmony . . . that . . . stimulates usually opposed aspects of being" and by "a general intensification of consciousness, exercising all a man's faculties richly, and together. "9 The last two types of oxymoron I will call "line oxymoron" and "elemental synaesthesia. " Line oxymoron is the apparent contradiction of terms associated through their parallel placement in successive lines. Line oxymoron evokes an empathie affirmation of the perplexity of contraries. And oft had my serene repose Been cloven by many a rending groan. (1.84-85; italics mine) 9- Definitions from Joseph T. Shipley, ed., Dictionary of World Literature: Criticisms, Forms, Techniques (New York: Philosophical Library, 1953) 26, 295, 410.</page><page sequence="7">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 377 Thy gentle words Are sweeter even than freedom long desired And long delayed. Asia, thou light of life. . . . (3.3.4-7; italics mine) The opposition in the line oxymoron need not involve the grammatical sense of the passage to make its presence felt. Hung mute and moveless o'er yon hushed abyss, As thunder, louder than your own, made rock The orbed world! (1.67-69; italics mine) The use here of both beginning and end-line oxymoron promotes a more extensive reading of oxymoron as a rhetorical figure that shapes (literally outlines in this passage) distinct linearity into complex whole ness. While the contraries "mute"/"thunder" and "abyss"/"rock" are almost perfectly juxtaposed by their placement, the realistic association of abyss with thunder and mute with rock asserts a mirroring relation ship between opposed extremes. The passage in fact centers on a chias mus, or mirroring reversal, "o'er yon"/"your own," around which revolve the inverse oppositions "louder"/"hushed" and "moveless"/ "made." In the1 same fashion that the words that displace the perfect symmetry of the beginning- and end-line oxymoron liken a single fig ure, Prometheus, to a world ("Hung . . . / As . . . / The orbed world!"), the remaining chiastic couplet produces a microcosm of "involved and involving" forces. Elemental synaesthesia is a projection of the senses through phenom ena onto the elements: vision to light, sun, and fire; hearing to sound, storms, ocean, and water; feeling or touch to earthquakes, rocks, moun tains, and earth. I ask the Earth, have not the mountains felt? I ask yon Heaven, the all-beholding Sun, Has it not seen? The Sea, in storm or calm, Heaven's ever-changing Shadow, spread below, Have its deaf waves not heard my agony? (1.25-29) Feeling mountains, seeing Sun, and, obviously, deaf waves hearing, are oxymorons. Oxymoron often overlaps with other devices, here, for example, with personification. The jarring effect of oxymoron which</page><page sequence="8">378 ELLEN BROWN HERSON distinguishes it from other devices has its basis here in that the sense perceptions are (by implication of failure to perceive) attributed to pre cisely their own objects. Furthermore, Shelley is setting up a consistent system of association of the elements with the senses, which provides a basis for the oxy moronic combination of the different elements through out the play. Here is a sampling of brief passages from Act iv. flying-fish (86) sea-birds (88) Its wheels are solid clouds (2i4) the illumined sea (2T6) winged infant (2i?) bright snow (220) sunny frost (22i) ethereal pearl (223) liquid darkness (226) Wells of unfathomed fire (284) And fishes which were isles (304) A solid cloud to rain hot thunderstones (34i) My imperial mountains crowned with cloud, and snow, and fire (346) The tempest is his steed, he strides the air (421) Shelley's system is made up primarily of three senses, sight, touch, and hearing, with their corresponding objects, fire or light, earth or matter, and water or sound. Air moves through or is a medium for earth, water, and fire. Thus it is identified with earth when it is "trampled" by "winged steeds," with water through clouds, and with fire by light. The inglorious senses of taste and smell are relegated to secondary positions subsumed under hearing and water, through the liquids blood, tears, and wine. Blood is associated with water, "We had been stained with bitter blood" (1.79, Voice from the Springs), which is associated with taste here and again later in Act 1 by the Third Fury: "Groans half heard, and blood untasted" (1.529). Blood, as the essence of life (and death), is also scented: "The hope of torturing him smells like a heap / Of corpses, to a death-bird after battle" (1.339-340). "We track all things that weep, and bleed, and live" (1.456). Many passages support the primary identification of water with sound. Here are a few: And music lifted up the listening spirit Until it walked, exempt from mortal care, Godlike, o'er the clear billows of sweet sound. . . . (2.4.77-79)</page><page sequence="9">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 379 It seems in truth the fairest shell of Ocean: Its sound must be at once both sweet and strange. (3.3.74-75) The stream of sound has ebbed away from us, And you pretend to rise out of its wave. . . . (4.506-7) The light and fire from heaven, the feeling earth, and the resounding and reflecting water, "Heaven's ever-changing Shadow, " represent an ele mental synaesthetic trinity, the non-dualistic quintessence for Shelley of perception and its*objects.10 The rhetorical progression of Prometheus Un bound is toward such a high degree of synaesthetic response to the three elements that synaesthesia transcends the incongruity of their identification and posits their ultimate wholeness. Oxymoron is not suspended; it is the rhetorical and imagistic condition of such spatializing phrases as "web of mystic measure" and "orbs within orbs."11 Even with the em phasis on mystic-organic harmony in Acts in and iv, the occurrence of oxymoron remains steady throughout the play, peaking slightly in Act 11.12 The resolution of the perceiver-object dichotomy performed by ele mental synaesthesia is allegorically restated in terms of reflection, both imagistic and rhetorical. Heaven and earth are harmonized through the reflection of the sky in water. io. Steve Ellis quotes John Keble's "observation of 'the intense effect' the Paradiso produces 'by little more than various combinations of three leading ideas?light, motion, and music . . . ', a statement that could as well be applied to the final act of Shelley's drama" ("Shelley, Dante, and Freedom") 4. Ellis quotes Keble [1825] from Dante and English Literature, comp. Paget Toynbee, 2 vols. [Methuen, 1909] 2: 436). The generation from early on in Act 1 of the synaesthetic trinity of sight, feeling, and sound, indicates that the statement should be applied to the entire play. 11. The orbs are solid bodies here, yet taking on the attributes of the concentric celestial spheres of medieval astronomy: A sphere, which is as many thousand spheres, Solid as crystal, yet through all its mass Flow, as through empty space, music and light: Ten thousand orbs involving and involved. ... (4.238-41) 12. The chart of occurrence of oxymoron per hundred lines looks like this: Act 1?10 Act 11?13 Act m?11 Act iv?12</page><page sequence="10">380 ELLEN BROWN HERSON The lake-reflected sun illume The yellow bees in the ivy-bloom. . . . (1.744-45) The allegory here is purely natural, almost scientific. "Reflected" inter poses between lake and sun to suggest a reciprocal action of reflected reflecting. The sun is reflected, or made visible, in the lake, and the yellow bees are reflected?their yellow is made visible by illumination? in the sunlight. The subtle chiasmus, the rhetorical reflection, lies in the alliteration of "illume" and "yellow" and the compound words "lake reflected" and "ivy-bloom. " These compounds are also related by being water and earth's respective responses to sunlight. Remembering that poetry is identified with water through sound, the reflecting properties of water which bridge heaven and earth in this passage implicitly refer to poetry as the uniting subject of syneciosis. In a more obvious example, "Music is in the sea and air" (4.366), poetry har monizes the here opposed aspects of sea and air, moisture and light, muta bility and immutability.13 The most pronounced syneciosis of the play re curs in the songs of the Spirits that close Act 1, surrounding the reflection passage quoted above: "the prophecy / Which begins and ends in thee!" The reflection passage continues: Nor heed nor see, what things they be But from these create he can Forms more real than living man, Nurslings of immortality! (1.746-749) Here we find a further statement of the crucial role of poetry, or ho mogenic prophecy, in the reconciliation of heaven (Forms and immor tality) and earth (Nurslings and living man). Again, the chiasmus achieves the reflection on a rhetorical level. The Fourth Spirit, who speaks this line, calls for a deafness and blindness to classifiable "things, " in favor of a response to "Forms more real than living man," an oxy moronic yoking together of the ideal and the real. Later passages containing references to the harmonizing of heaven and earth explicitly embrace the symbolic along with the natural, the alle gorical along with psychological. 13- See Wasserman, Shelley 466, on the tradition of moisture and light symbolism and its use in Adonais. Prometheus' first reference to the sea, "Heaven's ever-changing Shadow," conveys this opposition with the inverse image of reflection, i.e., shadow.</page><page sequence="11">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 381 Realms where the air we breathe is love, Which in the winds and on the waves doth move, Harmonizing this earth with what we feel above. (2.5.95-97) In Heaven before the fall of Jupiter harmonies arise, As dew from earth under the twilight stars. . . . (3.1.28-29) On earth immediately after the fall of Jupiter Henceforth the fields of heaven-reflecting sea14 . . . will heave . . . Swayed by the summer air. . . . (3.2.18-21) Heaven, which has apparently always enjoyed a high degree of synaes thetic combination, is mirrored in the earth: "harmonies"/"heaven-re flecting"; "dew from earth"/"sea"; "arise"/"heave"; "stars"/"air" (sky and medium of light). In Act iv, however, a reciprocation of the reflec tion of heaven in earth takes place. In a highly allegorical passage, the moon represents the projection by man of the existence of a cold, oppressive divinity on high.15 In the process by which the perceiver becomes like that which he perceives, the object not only mirrors the viewer (the moon), but the viewer begins to mirror his object (earth): Drinking from thy sense and sight Beauty, majesty, and might, As a lover or a chameleon Grows like what it looks upon, As a violet's gentle eye Gazes on the azure sky Until its hue grows like what it beholds, As a gray and watery mist Glows like solid amethyst. . . . (4.481-89) 14- This phrase is an inversion of the reflection passage from Act I, "lake-reflected sun," and an enlargement: lake becomes sea and sun becomes heaven. 15. Earl Wasserman has thoroughly discussed the "unreality of Jupiter," his existence as an "anthropomorphic fiction" and a distorted projection of Prometheus' self. See Shelley 258-61 and 307.</page><page sequence="12">382 ELLEN BROWN HERSON Thus divinity is humanized?purely a matter of perception, when what is being altered is a projection: reversing a reversal. In this passage the earth is the realm of true Forms, "solid amethyst," and light, which the divinity, "a gray and watery mist," imitates. Perception, as well as truth, has been sufficiently allegorized: "As a violet's gentle eye," to suggest a reflexive (mirroring) relationship between eternal truth and sensual phe nomena. The senses thus become like that which they gaze upon, true Forms.16 The overwhelming use of similes in this passage is not due to a timidness on Shelley's part in the identification of sensual phenomena with truth. It is due to the fact that the moon (divinity) only seems to be imitating the earth (humankind) for the first time. It actually always was an inverse image of the "Beauty, majesty, and might" that it now directly imitates. Divinity seems because it is the Platonic image once removed from its ontological ground, human existence?not the other way around. At the same time, however, the real and the ideal, seen now in purely human terms, are held apart by the insistent similes? saved from a vitiating blending or indeterminate continuum. This refusal of the similes in Prometheus Unbound to move from one level of being to a "higher" one, has its analogy in the play's resistance to any simple dramatic progression. If one thought such a progression occurred here, one would be hard-pressed to explain the function of the final three acts in a play that has its first peripeteia, the recalling of the curse, in Act i. If the genre "lyrical drama" is an oxymoronic blending of incongruous poetic modes, then the lyrical and the dramatic modes must be co-extensive in the poem as a whole. Reflexive opposition, which has been discussed in terms of the rhe torical device chiasmus and the harmonizing of contraries such as the human and the divine, is more than a lyrical strategy or a structural principle. Mirroring and negation are brought into a single oxymoronic context through the drama that is carefully inscribed in the text. This 16. M. H. Abrams, in The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition (New York: Oxford UP, 1953), discusses the shift in Romantic Neo-Platonism from poetry "mirroring" the eternal Forms which are outside man and beyond his grasp, to poetry mirroring "the lamp of the mind" (130). Abrams sees this latter alternative as a combination of Platonism and psychological empiricism. I am inclined to think that Shelley humanized the Platonic Forms without resorting in any way to the primacy of ordinary perception. Shelley's use of elemental synaesthesia also suggests a response to Stuart Curran's citing of "a conceptual leap from mental microcosm to universal macrocosm" in the fourth act (Shelley's Annus Mirabilis 106). By allegorizing perception (or percep tualizing allegory) elemental synaesthesia facilitates a subtle, almost imperceptible, shift toward the universal within the context of the mind.</page><page sequence="13">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 383 drama consists of nine passages following the pattern of three consecu tive negations, each introduced by "no," "neither," "nor," or "none," and are the only passages of their kind in the play.17 Most of the subsequent discussion of the play is organized around these passages (numbered i-ix). Early in Act i a woeful refrain is uttered twice by Prometheus, "Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, forever!" (23, 30). Between these lines occurs some of Prometheus' most extravagant rhetoric, apostrophizing the elements by means of oxymoron, metaphor, syneciosis and personifi cation, and introducing the elemental synaesthesia which uniquely char acterizes Shelley's "new world. " Such language draws attention to itself. The first line of this linguistic exhibition is the laconic lament, (i) No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I endure. (Prometheus 1.24) The line is an oxymoron. No past (change is seen only in retrospect) or content of time, no present or demarcations in time, no future or direc tion to time. Yet Prometheus has duration. He exists in a time that does not exist for him. In Act 11 Panthea is called upon by Asia to "Lift up thine eyes, / And let me read thy dream" (2.1.55-56). Within the text of the remembered dream, Prometheus echoes Asia's words, "'lift thine eyes on me'" (2.1.70). Panthea in the dream lifted her eyes, and her senses were overpowered by the "all-dissolving power" of love: (ii) I saw not, heard not, moved not, only felt. . . . (Panthea 2.1.79) This is an echo of Prometheus' passage in Act 1, but with the shift to feeling, or consciousness of other, away from enduring, or consciousness of self. Here "moving" refers to the single sense of touch, reserving "feeling" for the synaesthetic combination of Shelley's three senses. Thus Panthea's passage also denies the importance of sensation relative to that 17- Timothy Webb's insight into the importance of negatives in Prometheus Unbound has led him to conclude, in a highly thematic essay focusing on negative prefixes, that Shelley's negatives "veil" a potential cosmic affirmation ("The unascended heaven: negatives in Prometheus Unbound, " Shelley Revalued, Essays from the Gregynog Conference, ed. Kelvin Everest [Totowa, New Jersey: Barnes, 1983] 37-62). My foray into the realm of negation stresses the reflexive inversion between related occurrences of negation. My sense is that the poem's reverberations are horizontal rather than vertical: notions of above and below (or beneath), whether Platonic, Judeo-Christian, or Freudian, play into the very logic Shelley's poem attempts to overcome.</page><page sequence="14">384 ELLEN BROWN HERSON of synaesthetic awareness, a heightened awareness that Prometheus ac knowledges in his last words of the play, "We feel what thou hast heard and seen: yet speak" (3.4.97). In addition, while denying disparate sen sation, Panthea, through her recalling of the dream, affirms the unity of the three temporal dimensions which Prometheus has earlier denied. She speaks in the past tense of a future reality, Prometheus' release. Panthea's recalling of her dream parallels Prometheus' recalling of the curse, only the order of events is reversed: for Panthea the recalling precedes the denial. Thus the shift from Act 1 to Act 11, from the closest thing in Shelley to the Aeschylean tragedy, to the comic ascent of Panthea and Asia, from the unfulfilled prophecy in Act 1 to Demogorgon's ascent in Act 11, represents not progression, but reversal. The shift from night to morning between the acts portrays time not as passage, but as inversion, a device for journeying from the realm of punishment, of "self-love" and "self-contempt" (Inferno 3.4.134), to the realms of forgiveness and love, used by Dante in the lowest circle of Hell.18 Prophetic Panthea speaks again in Act 11 of the imagelessness of De mogorgon. neither limb, (iii) Nor form, nor outline; yet we feel it is. . . . (Panthea 2.4.5-6) The meaning and structure of this statement are made clear by a com parison with Panthea's first line. Panthea reacts to Demogorgon quite similarly as she reacts to the "all-dissolving power" of love. (ii) I saw not, heard not, moved not, only felt. . . . neither limb, (iii) Nor form, nor outline; yet we feel it is. . . . Both lines negate three terms and then end on an affirmation of feeling.19 The second line inverts the first, however. Outline, the third term of 18. In one of the most vivid and appalling images of the Inferno (34.70-94), Virgil, with Dante on his back?Panthea carries the image of Prometheus in her eyes (2.1.120)?climbs onto Satan's thigh, and, clinging to his frozen crust and matted hair, manages with great effort to turn upside down. He then dismounts, and seeing Satan's three heads where his feet were, Virgil and Dante begin the purgatorial climb. 19. The ending subordinate clause in the second passage, "it is," intervenes between feeling and its object, Demogorgon as "a living spirit," suggesting that the communion Panthea experienced with Prometheus in her dream-vision is not possible with Demo gorgon. Yet this extra-sensory synaesthetic "feeling" is the medium between abrogated sense perceptions and the apprehension of the unknowable Demogorgon.</page><page sequence="15">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 385 the line referring to Demogorgon, corresponds specifically to vision, the first term of the line referring to Prometheus. Limb corresponds to movement and feeling, as the single sense of touch. Form may corre spond to hearing if we recall the complex of sound/water/poetry (thus poetic form) and the identification of sense phenomena and true Forms earlier on. This correspondence would be strained enough, if it were not for the disordering in the second passage?the only triple negative to spill over into a second line?which puts "Nor form" at the beginning of a line. The negation of form implies that Demogorgon possesses no inherent qualities. Panthea here negates attributes of the objects of sen sation, not sensation itself (the verbs used in the first passage). The prominence of the negation of form reinforces all the implications of the enjambment: Demogorgon represents the cyclical infinitude of end less beginnings and endings, change, chaos, but most of all a pattern lessness which is a-mythic, or pre-mythic: "In the world unknown / Sleeps a voice unspoken ..." (Echoes, 2.1.190-91). Thus the inversion of terms between two passages from one voice, describing the prophetic dream of the radiant transfiguration of Prometheus, and the obscure encounter with a being which is revealed only as an unknowable, pre figures an antithetical relationship only fully developed in the final words of the play. Panthea's second line is surrounded by questions posed by Panthea to Asia and Asia to Demogorgon. What veiled form sits on that ebon throne? . . . What canst thou tell? . . . Who made the living world? . . . Who made all That it contains? . . . Who made the sense which . . . Fills the faint eyes with falling tears ... ? And who made terror . . . Abandoned hope and love that turns to hate; And self-contempt . . . And Hell, or the sharp fear of Hell? . . . Who reigns? (2.4.1-32) Within the depth created by Demogorgon's twice repeated answer "He reigns" (2.4.28, 31, 32), lies Asia's ultimate reference to language in all of this imperative interrogative, "Utter his name: a world pining in pain / Asks but his name: curses shall drag him down" (2.4.29, 30). Before</page><page sequence="16">386 ELLEN BROWN HERSON beginning both to ask and answer more questions, and before her mono logue on Prometheus' gifts to man, including speech as the origin of thought, Asia avails herself of the familiar pattern: (iv) To know nor faith, nor love, nor law. . . . (Asia 2.4.47) Asia's negations can be read similarly to Panthea's. Panthea juxtaposes the three distinct senses and the harmonizing synaesthetic sensitivity. Asia juxtaposes the faithless, loveless, and lawless reign of Jupiter and the implied presence of those harmonizing principles in a society gov erned not by tyrants, but by poets. Asia's line sets up the beginning of Act in, the merciless and irrevocable dethroning of Jupiter, as the reversal of Act 11, on the generative and regenerative power of love. Act m contains its own reversal, of course, making the end of Act in the fulfillment of Act 11. Mirroring is both reproduction and negation as inversion. The denials expressed by the negatives in the inscribed passages serve to set up an oxymoronic relationship of negative likeness. This is not a static rela tionship, however?not a formula for frustration and despair.20 The reverberations between the characters speaking in these crucial passages, characters who are definitely speaking to each other in the terms of this inscribed drama, advance the universal comic resolution. Panthea's two synaesthetic intimations provide a viewpoint outside Prometheus' and 20. These are key words associated with oxymoron in Stuart Curran's writings. Inter estingly, he is echoed by a deconstructionist critic, Angela Leighton, in his sense that irresolvable dualities are hopeless. Both spoke on Adonais at the Gregynog Conference. Curran argued emphatically against an oxymoronic reading of the poem?which was so successful for Earl Wasserman (Curran acknowledged this)?while Leighton concluded that "to read Adonais from a deconstruction perspective is to find in its ending a merely equivocal comment on the dualistic theory of inspiration which informs the poem. For as long as the immortal voice of the dead, the voice of unfailing inspiration, remains lost to the written text, the poem plays out the drama of its 'dispossession'; the drama of 'differance,' where the language must find its object perpetually different and deferred. To reach the desired realm of the 'Immortal' is thus a triumph only gained at the price of silence and despair" ("Deconstruction Criticism and Shelley's Adonais," Shelley Revalued 163; Curran, "Adonais in Context," Shelley Revalued 175-78). Leighton's perspective is inappropriately bleak. In the Derridean view, "the supplement is neither a presence nor an absence" (Of Grammatology, trans. Gayatri Spivak [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1975] 314). Thus the play of supplementarity between language and its objects represents no tragic loss of what never existed?in Derrida's terms, "the mirage of immediacy" (141). As for Shelley, oxymoron is not the combination of mutually nullifying forces. Opposed elements do not cancel one another out; rather they sustain relations closer to Derrida's supplementarity than to Leighton's linguistic trauma.</page><page sequence="17">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 387 an introduction to the unbiasedness of Demogorgon. Asia's passage advances Shelley's sense-trinity of seeing, hearing, and feeling, into the broad context of a just society, by denying Jupiter's ruthless opposition of himself to love through rape and torment. A reversal of Aeschylus' sinking of Prometheus is carried out in Act m with the sinking of Jupiter. This occurs on the rhetorical level by means of more mirroring. Two passages from the first and last scenes of the act circumscribe the peripeteia of the inscribed drama. (v) No pity, no release, no respite! . . . (Jupiter 3.1.64) (viii) Nor jealousy, nor envy, nor ill shame. . . . (Spirit of the Hour 3.4.161) In the first line, with Jupiter's projection of his own relentlessness onto Demogorgon, all the merciful elements of pity, release, and respite are lacking. In the second line, with the transformation of the earth result ing from Prometheus' liberation-resurrection, all the erring aspects of humankind are removed: jealousy, envy, and ill shame. Within these lines, a chiasmus turns on the erasure of the hopelessness of Dante's Inferno. (vi) None fawned, none trampled; hate, disdain, or fear, Self-love or self-contempt, on human brows No more inscribed, as o'er the gate of hell, 'All hope abandon ye who enter here;' (vii) None frowned, none trembled, none with eager fear. . . . (Spirit of the Hour 3-4-133-37) "None fawned, none trampled"/"None frowned, none trembled" is the most artful and elaborate chiasmus in Shelley's drama. The triple-ne gation pattern is altered in the first passage in order to centrally locate "No more inscribed"; still the reflexive balance is kept complete by the opposition of "none with eager fear" to the positive semblance of "hate, disdain, or fear" in the first line alone. Here inscription is literal, as it is in the Inferno (3.9), where the resounding curse of Christendom is reproduced in the texts of modern editions as would be an engraved epitaph (i.e., in quotation marks or small capitals). John Freccero, in his essay "Infernal Irony: The Gates of Hell," has revealed the process of what he calls "literalization" at work in the Inferno, and links this rhetorical dynamic with what he has already cited as the "corporeal" nature of infernal vision.</page><page sequence="18">388 ELLEN BROWN HERSON I should like to suggest that Dante's poem represents the severest form of jurisprudence and represents a rhetoric of God's revenge. Once again, the principle is that of literalization. If Dante's irony turns words into icons, souls into bodies and the spirit into the letter, it also turns rhetorical figures into things.21 In Prometheus Unbound the inscription of voices is taken another literary step beyond speaking grave markers and lapidary signifiers. The printed poetic line recreates the depth of physical engraving in Shelley's text by means of concentric rhetorical surroundings which focus on the central passage (the chiasmus within the reversal of "No pity "/"Nor jealousy," following upon Jupiter's demand for Demogorgon's name), which then focuses on the central word within the passage, "inscribed." A closer look at Shelley's treatment of the theme of language will establish that his inscription is meant not to pursue a further reification of signs. Prometheus has called forth the entire speech of the Spirit of the Hour (in which the reinscription appears) with his last words: "We feel what thou hast heard and seen: yet speak" (3.4.97). The summonings of language that precede and surround the inscribed passages point to the function of Shelley's inscription to call attention to language itself as an entity both prior to sense and more than a rendering of sensation. Shelley's two most prominent statements about language force us to consider seemingly contradictory aspects of one thing.22 Prometheus, Asia tells Demogorgon, gave man speech, and speech created thought, Which is the measure of the universe. . . . (2.4.72-73) Speech here?perhaps referring to the ostensibly more primary oral aspect of language favored, according to Derrida, by the "meta physics of presence" over the written word?precedes thought. Ut terance precedes idea, which is the "measure" of all things, the uni verse. Speech?"given" by Prometheus but not created by him?is therefore self-caused, a creator contiguous with the boundaries of all experience. In Act iv, the Spirit of the Earth puts forth a different view: 21. John Freccero, Dante: The Poetics of Conversion (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1986) 106. 22. I thank Marshall Brown for pointing out the disparity between these two passages, and for many vital suggestions in the revision of this essay.</page><page sequence="19">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 389 Language is a perpetual Orphic song, Which rules with Daedal harmony a throng Of thoughts and forms, which else senseless and shapeless were. (4.415-17) Speech created thought, but language "rules" it?another reference, along with "Daedal harmony," to measure, limit, or boundary. Thought could not exist without that which created it, speech; but "thoughts and forms" could exist, albeit in a "senseless and shapeless" way, without language. Language might be translated as written word here, given its seemingly secondary function, except for the fact that it is identified with the "Orphic song," which is "perpetual." From the perspective of poetic creation, creation and "ruler"-ship are co-extensive, as are the primary utterances and secondary codifications of an all-encompassing conception of language. In a hierarchical reversal, the primariness of linguistic codification and the secondariness of primal utterance are pre cisely the emphasis of this second passage. The purpose then of Shelley's reinscription is to write over the "aban doned hope" and the creation of a "sharp fear of Hell" alluded to by Asia in Act 11, by means of the very same words that Dante used to represent divine justice. Infernal irony, John Freccero argues, is a con flated replication of signifier and signified, in which the "dizzying re versability" of the two terms performs a "mimesis with a vengeance" (102) which the clear and good intellect of the pilgrim is called upon to read as figurative and not literal (107). If Dante's Inferno represents a "rhetoric of God's revenge," then Shelley's poem is a rhetoric of human compassion, a benediction addressing itself solely to Christian curses. Hopelessness is the result of a hardened disdain?that of Prometheus early in Act 1, and that of Farinata in the tenth canto of the Inferno, "his breast and forehead there / Erecting, seem'd as in high scorn he held / E'en hell" (35-37; Sinclair, 35-36: "el s'ergea col petto e con la fronte / com'avesse l'inferno in gran dispitto" ["he was lifting up his breast and brow as if he had great scorn of Hell"]). Shelley's rewriting is redemptive rather than exclusive. What is written over is neither orality, since in the dramatic mode all that is written is also spoken, nor the written word, since what is spoken in the inscribed drama is written within the outer drama. Shelley puts back into play both the figurative and the literal, the spoken and the written, the soul and the body, in his oxy moronic blending of the poetic and the dramatic. Thus he attempts to rehabilitate the freedom of movement between words and things that was threatened by Dante's infernal irony. Yet another mirroring takes place around Shelley's quotation from the Inferno. In Shelley's chiasmus three lines precede the quotation and</page><page sequence="20">390 ELLEN BROWN HERSON one line follows it. In Dante's text, the one line preceding the inscription and the three and a half lines following it provide a passage from Prometheus' line at the beginning of the inscribed drama to Demogor gon's line at its end. "Eternal, and eternal I endure. All hope abandon, ye who enter here." Such characters, in colour dim, I mark'd Over a portal's lofty arch inscribed. Whereat I thus: "Master, these words import hard meaning." (Inferno 3.8-14) Cary indulged in two puns, "portal" and "import," "mark'd" and "in scribed," that do not appear to be warranted in the original (Sinclair: "Queste parole di colore oscuro / vid ?o scritte al sommo d'una porta; / per ch'io: 'Maestro, it senso lor m'? duro'" ["These words I saw inscribed in dark characters over a gateway; therefore I said: 'Master, their sense is dreadful to me'"]). Dante's only pun appears to be that between the inscription at the top of the stone portal, and its "hard" meaning.23 But Cary's sensitivity to the possibilities in these lines of the conflation of reading and writing ("marked" and "inscribed"), of en graved characters on a "portal" and their "hard import," may have inspired Shelley to the creation of further linguistic gateways. The line preceding the one Shelley quoted, "Eternal, and eternal I endure," certainly resonates with Prometheus' "No change, no pause, no hope! / Yet I endure" of Act 1, and in the Italian ("duro") anticipates the "duro" of Dante's response to the gates of Hell. The Prometheus of Act 1, chained to the lofty rocks of Mount Caucasus, is the inscription over the gates of Hell. The lofty rocks and the stony top of the portal are the "human brows, " like the lifted brow of Farinata, on which "self love" and "self-contempt," once written, are "No more inscribed" at the peripeteia of the drama?the high point of the text as an entity to be engraved upon. And finally, in the virtual telescoping of these five lines from Dante into a four-act play, the "hard meaning" of the scornful inscription prompts the call to Demogorgon to write over Prometheus' line. Demogorgon closes the play with a speech called forth by the "All": "Speak: thy strong words may never pass away" (4-553? italics mine). The spoken word is indelibly engraved; rhetoric leaves a lasting impression, but in this case the ineradicable decree concerns human freedom: 23- Freccero has also noted this ("Infernal Irony" 99).</page><page sequence="21">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 391 (ix) Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent. . . . (Demogorgon 4.575) While Prometheus embodies the oxymoron of human divinity, De mogorgon speaks the language of antithesis, a subtype of oxymoron. "Neither/nor" both negates and delineates carefully opposed alterna tives?"either/or" taken one step further toward a rejection of alterna tives now seen as opposed extremes. This negative construction is unique to Demogorgon and Panthea's description of him. Demogorgon is antithesis itself, the "detested" (3.1.61) child of Thetis (thetic: dog matic, that which is placed) and Zeus. As revolution, he is the antithesis of status quo. As the potential antichrist, engendered by Jupiter to destroy Prometheus, he is the antithesis of Prometheus. As an inhabitant of the underworld, he is the antithesis of heaven. As fate, he is the antithesis of sovereign will; as law, the antithesis of sovereign caprice; as eternity, the antithesis of time. And as the representative of the function of Shelley's text with regard to Dante's, he is Shelley as the antithesis of Dante, who, being identified with Prometheus, is nonethe less acknowledged as a lightbearer to mankind. Demogorgon's passage is related to Asia's ("To know nor faith, nor love, nor law . . . ") by the use of infinitive verbs, suggesting that the two figures hold in common the transcendence or pure ideality of action. Asia has generally been considered the representation of love. However, her violent rhetoric in Act 11 ("curses shall drag him down") tends to alter her role. Love in this play and in the Commedia is the driving force of change. But both passions embodied in Asia, the one (love) for harmonious combination and the other (change) for disordering refor mation, are, in a more human context, subject to excess. Thus Asia verges on the same tragic radicalism that was self-defeat for Prometheus in Act 1. Asia is tempered, however, by the intransigence of Demogor gon, and emerges finally as a figure for transformation. Asia's descent motivates his ascent. Asia's questions wake the "voice" the "sleeps," spur the "unspoken" to muted speech, and stimulate the emergence of "the world unknown." Demogorgon's words are a direct rebuttal to the tragic early Prome theus: (i) No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I endure. (ix) Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent. . . . Demogorgon undermines Prometheus' expression of a lack of temporal well-being, of change, pause, and hope, by subtly reproducing Pro metheus' words with an inverse meaning. The lack of change is paired</page><page sequence="22">392 ELLEN BROWN HERSON with the lack of a desire for change, or a plenitude of change. Pause, in Prometheus' plight signifying respite, is paired with faltering, a breaking down against one's will under relentless forces. Hope is paired with repentance, and act looking backward rather than forward, with remorse rather then anticipation. In ideological terms, repentance, a denigration of human reality, is the price paid for Christian hope. The temporal succession of the three terms in Prometheus' line is mirrored here by the successive degradation?to seek transformation to an ideal, to fail, to seek forgiveness?that proceeds from a false view of the relationship between the ideal and the real, the human and the divine. Demogorgon's antithetical nature transforms Prometheus' temporal oxymoron from an expression of eternal despair to one of oxymoronic fulfillment?a reclaiming of hope24 dramatically enabled by the peripe teia of the inscribed drama, the erasure of the hopelessness of Dante's Inferno in Act in. Oxymoron is no longer seen as a static opposition, at the same time as the false extremes of theistic hope and despair?em bodied in Prometheus' words and disfigured by Demogorgon's?are demystified. In this encompassing relationship between Prometheus and Demo gorgon, the possibilities of interpretation of both antithesis and oxy moron are being expanded. In a conflation of antithesis and oxymoron, if you will, or, more appropriately, in a rediscovery of the emphasis on non-resolution characteristic of the fusions enacted by the seventeenth century's favorite figure, oxymoron is seen as a sustaining of difference beyond rational thought and a unitary approach to perceptual diversity (elemental synaesthesia). Its grammatical expression is the "neither/nor," in which related negation, the vehicle of Shelley's inscribed drama, creates a reflexivity of opposed elements. Shelley's oxymoron stresses, characteristically, both sameness and difference where each is most un expected and at the same time. To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite; To forgive wrongs darker than death or night; To defy Power, which seems omnipotent; To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates From its own wreck the thing it contemplates; Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent. . . . (4.570-75) 24- Reclamation of hope is a major theme of Timothy Webb's essay, "The unascended heaven. "</page><page sequence="23">OXYMORON IN PROMETHEUS UNBOUND 393 The Phoenix-like image of hope creating from its own disappointment the thing that it envisioned is the final oxymoron of the play. Ruin has shadowed love, death life, pain joy, and disappointment hope, through out the play. The paradisiacal vision for Shelley consists in seeing the two as not two and not one. Oxymoron is the language, the thought, and the reality of this vision. The oxymoronic combination of synaes thetic unity and reflexive opposition in Prometheus Unbound results in the shift from the tragic perspective of defiance and long-suffering to one inclusive of these elements and their comic contraries, forgiveness and love. The only inspiration for the only world, the human one, is the vision that can repeatedly traverse the boundary between perfection and imperfection without losing sight of either.
