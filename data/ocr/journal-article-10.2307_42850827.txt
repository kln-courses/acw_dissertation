There is, says Dr. Isajiw, a certain lack of clarity in the way functionalists use the con- cept of function which derives from their 'failure or perhaps unwillingness* to admit that teleology is part of the method of their analysis. But there is no such shamefaced chicken-heartedness about Dr. Isajiw. There are, he tells us, two kinds of causality - productive causality and telecausality. The first is just plain causality as most reasonable men understand it, except that, as his ad- jectival qualification suggests, he gives it some odd pre-Humean twists. The second is just teleology - explanation which consists in showing how parts of a social system (pat- terns, institutions, etc.) are means to certain ends of a self-regulating system, those ends being ends of the system itself, not of any individuals who participate in the system. And, he says, three cheers for those like Parsons (but not the prevaricator Merton) who unambiguously pursue telecauses, leaving productive causes to lesser, squarer minds. Why? Because it 'gives us more insight', 'offers fruitful investigation and knowledge*. The snag is that whereas the truth of an explanation in terms of 'productive causes' is open to tests through experiments and other means of observation designed to falsify the general laws which are involved in making them, Dr. Isajiw offers no similar method of assessing the 'fruitful insight* which a tele- causal explanation provides. The quality of Dr. Isajiw's reasoning may be illustrated by the way he deals with the only two objections to his attempt to re- habilitate telecausality which he considers worth mentioning: '(i) that imputation of ends to phenomena other than individual human beings is, in effect, anthropomorphism and cannot be tested empirically, and (ii) that to consider phenomena as acting towards ends is to employ value judgment*. To the first he answers, in effect, tu quoque ; other scientists* belief in the necessity of causal laws is equally anthropomorphic.</page><page sequence="2">43 S SHORTER NOTICES Ayer's dismissal of Hume's psychological explanation of why we impute necessity to causal relations is quoted as if it destroyed - which it does not - Hume's central assertion that scientists must, and perfectly well can, operate with a notion of cause as mere constant conjunction and invariate sequence without any imputation of necessity. As for the second point, his arguments are irrelevant, because he has got the criticism wrong. Considering phenomena as acting towards ends which are ends of systems is not 'to imply value judgments', it is simply to make unwarranted assumptions. Value judg- ments enter at the second step - in the choice of the particular ends which it is assumed social systems have - in assuming them to be integration, or harmony, or self-regulating equilibrium, rather than progress, say, or the constant excitement of bloody revolution. One wonders what Parsons and the other grand theorists will think of this. God preserve us from our friends, perhaps. The Emperor would probably not have been any more grateful to the little boy if, instead of just saying that he had no clothes, he had gone on to point out how admirably fruitful and full of insight his nakedness was.
