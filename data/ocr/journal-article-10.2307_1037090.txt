New York: Free Press, 1966. $7.95. This book has many virtues from which its few minor faults hardly detract. It takes a large and much-needed step toward theoretical synthesis and places us in a position from which we can take additional steps. Its basic concern is with processes of symbolic interaction between human be- ings, but it augments ideas customarily tagged symbolic interactionism with in- sights drawn from other sources, including role theory, interpersonal psychiatry, and exchange theory. The result is not merely eclectic, but a coherent theory of the ways in which a human being acquires a more or less stable hierarchy of role-identities, "negotiates" these in encounters with other humans, and establishes enduring inter- personal relationships. The theory is con- cerned with the exchange of "intrinsic" and "extrinsic" gratifications as well as the exchange of social support of identities. It is also concerned with the development, implementation, and continual modification of personal "agendas." It clarifies, elabo- rates, and systematizes the dramaturgical metaphors already familiar to sociologists. The authors give us readable and inter- esting prose. Many of their sentences begin with abstract concepts and end with persuasive illustrations. For example, they point out (p. 146) that as soon as the "negotiation of identities" is substantially accomplished "it ordinarily fades into the background as a working agreement, in terms of which the interactors can . . . go on to build canoes, make love, or eat dinner." Many of their principles are so aphoristically expressed that there is some danger that they will be dismissed-even by sociologists-as too obvious to be im- portant; for example, (p. 194) "one of our major life tasks is to keep our stories straight for all the various audiences to whom we have told slightly different ver- sions of our lives." The book provides an unusually clear definition of interaction-a concept admit- tedly central to but grievously ill-conceived in much sociological literature. Similarly, an unusually lucid condensation of Mead's insights is offered (pp. 50-57). McCall and Simmons go well beyond Parsons' ef- fort to delineate "dimensions of action space" or to describe actors orienting to objects in situations. Their theory treats the self as an "important variable inter- vening between the antecedent events of the social world and the consequent actions of the individual" in a way that should supersede MacIver's sketchier conception of "dynamic assessments." In outlining five factors that determine the over-all salience of a given role-identity, the authors provide a potential sociological successor to Maslow's "prepotency hierarchy."</page><page sequence="2">BOOK DEPARTMENT 255 Mind, self, and problems of identity-- the "inner dynamics of people"-are ex- plored for the way they affect four depend- ent variables, "WHO come together to engage in WHAT social acts WHEN and WHERE?" (p. 13). These "four Ws" may seem journalistic, or even trite, but they are a striking parallel to the four variables elaborated a generation ago by S. C. Dodd in his Dimensions of So- ciety. The "WHAT" category has been the major preoccupation of social scien- tists (p. 19), yet in Dodd's S-theory it was the "residual category." In the pres- ent volume the "four Ws" are offered as a framework that is supposedly germane throughout the entire book, yet they go unmentioned from page 62 to page 202. This perhaps accounts for the contradiction between the assertion (p. 179) that "social order . . . does not obey the law of entropy" inasmuch as interpersonal rela- tionships "are relatively easy to create" but are "exceedingly difficult to destroy" and the footnote (p. 189) in which it is asserted that "frequent face-to-face inter- action seems to be a necessary condition for a strong and viable relationship." (In a portion of the text apparently forgotten in the writing of these two statements, it was acknowledged, p. 20, that "WHERE" one is affects "WHO" one interacts with and "WHAT" they do.) The authors may be forgiven such minor shortcomings as an occasional grammatical error (p. 190, "faced by he who") or an anthropomorphism (p. 174, "social forces seek to produce"), in view of their firm determination to pursue empirically the lines of inquiry opened up by their creative theorizing. The book ends with an epi- logue in which reasons for the prevalent view that symbolic interaction theory is vague and nonempirical are discussed, and specific suggestions are offered whereby its concepts can be made palpable and the task of verification can proceed. Important steps in that task have been undertaken in forthcoming works by these same authors, for which this reviewer will be waiting in keen anticipation. WILLIAM R. CATTON, JR.
