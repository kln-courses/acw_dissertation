Stephen Jay Gould. 241 pp. Ballantine Publishing Group, 1999. $18.95. Lifelong Stephen Jay Gould readers will find in Rocks of Ages much that is delightfully familiar: grace ful language flecked with occasional ir reverence, wonderful anecdotes about Darwin and his friends and their times, and the side trips?to the Scopes trial, to the Vatican, to the flat-earth contro versy?that slowly circle back to the main thread as engaging commen taries are proffered on the passing scenery. As always, Gould shoots some wonderful baskets, often from way outside the circle. But it is the main thread that must be considered here, for Gould has most emphatically written a book that has a point and one point alone. That point is given the acronym NOMA, which stands for non-overlapping magisteria, where a magisterium is "a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful dis course and resolution." The two mag isteria that fail to overlap are science and religion, and Gould declares the NOMA thesis to be "intellectually sound," "eminently practical" and "laudable." NOMA is a simple, humane, ratio nal, and altogether conventional ar Ursula Goodenough is a cell biologist and professor at Washington University in St. Louis. She is the author of'The Sacred Depths of Nature, recently published by Oxford University Press (see review, March-April). gument for mutual respect, based on non-overlapping subject matter, be tween two components of wisdom in a full human life: our drive to un derstand the factual character of na ture (the magisterium of science) and our need to define meaning in our lives and a moral basis for our actions (the magisterium of religion). Moreover, he claims that "most reli gious and scientific leaders actually do advocate the precepts of NOMA," the exceptions including creationists and militant atheists with a "blinkered con cept of religion." Such a gauntlet obviously invites response. The first difficulty arises in consider ing Gould's definition of a magisteri um, in which "each domain of inquiry frames its own rules and admissible questions, and sets its own criteria for judgment and resolution." He has no difficulty describing the tools that gov ern the magisterium of science?they encompass, of course, the scientific method, wherein "conclusions must remain open to empirical test and po tential rejection." Indeed, of Thomas the Apostle, Gould writes: Poor doubting Thomas. At his cru cial and eponymous moment, he acted in the most admirable way for one style of inquiry?but in the wrong magisterium. He espoused the key principle of science while operating within the different mag isterium of faith. In contrast, Gould fails to describe the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution in the magis</page><page sequence="2">;'v: m terium of religion. We learn that the outcome of religious inquiry is meaning and morals, but it is not at all clear how these are to be discerned, discussed or resolved except that we are assured that the process is "logically distinct" and "fully separate in styles of inquiry" from science. Gould's conclusion that the tools employed by doubting Thom as are out of line in the magisterium of religion is in fact likely to irritate, pos sibly outrage, some contemporary the ologians. Moreover, since he tells us that "dogmatic theology" is "contrary to most people's concept of religion" (news to me) and because "the validity of (ethical) principles can never be in ferred from the factual discoveries of science," we emerge with several opin ions about how the process should not work but little about how it should. Given this vacuum, it is useful to look at traditional religions and ask how their systems of ultimate meaning and ethical value have been deduced and consolidated. My sense is that each system is based on some sort of cos mology?God is in covenant with the Jews, Jesus is redeemer, the Buddha shows us the path to enlightenment? cosmologies that are rendered in poet ry and art and texts and are thereby in fused with meaning and value. Ethical precepts then flow from these cos mologies, whether via the direct reve lation of religious visionaries or by subsequent Talmudic-like inquiry: The precepts are invariably embedded in the central account or story. Gould is apparently not persuaded that these accounts are a valid sub strate for the religious quest.

The first commandment for all ver sions of NOMA might be summa rized by stating: "Thou shalt not mix the magisteria by claiming that God directly ordains important events in the history of nature by special inter ference knowable only through reve lation and not accessible to science." So much for most of the cosmology of traditional religions, called into be ing before scientific inquiry was avail able. Such a jettisoning of miracle-based cosmologies is of course the agenda of the "militant atheists" that Gould re viles. It is also the agenda of writer Ken Wilber, who states in Marriage of Sense and Soul: Integrating Science and Religion (1998): "If religion is to survive in a vi able form in the modern world, it must be willing to jettison its bogus claims." But what is to replace them? If mean ing and ethics are responses to large stories, and if our scientific understand ing of nature is disallowed as a source of new stories, then where are the new stories to be found? By what criteria do we validate our moralities if we throw out revelation, authority and scientific inquiry? Wilber responds that these is sues melt away once we engage in years of Buddhist meditation and dis cover "the reality of pure Spirit," a re sponse that I do not find very helpful. But no more helpful is Gould's state ment: ' ... construe as fundamentally religious... all moral discourse on prin ciples that might activate the ideal of universal fellowship among people." Not only does Gould refrain from identifying the tools for meaningful discourse and resolution in the magis terium of religion, but he also tells us that this discourse will generate two outcomes?ultimate meaning and moral value?that he invariably utters in the same breath. From my perspec tive, these outcomes relate to very dif ferent sets of propositions: Quests for ultimate meaning generate answers to "why" questions ("why is there any thing at all?") that cannot be answered by science, whereas ethical quests gen erate answers to "how should we pro ceed?" questions that cannot be an swered by science. Moreover, their consideration would seem to entail quite different tools of inquiry. In the end, a system of ultimate meaning in volves personal beliefs and can there fore harbor whatever level of irrational ity is needed. In contrast, a system of moral values entails beliefs that are generated by some sort of social dis course, meaning that their "truth" must make some sort of communal sense be fore it can carry the defacto validation of consensus. To be sure, a community can agree on the validity of "irrational" beliefs, but there is always the possibil ity that a doubting Thomas will hold them up to question.</page><page sequence="4">Again the real difficulty is that both sets of questions must be asked and re sponded to in the context of an overar ching cosmology We seek the meaning of?what? The universe, life, human self-awareness, time?topics that our scientifically derived understanding has much to tell us about. Similarly, as we seek ways to generate ethical con sensus, we bring to the table our con cepts of human nature and the dynam ics of social systems, topics about which our scientifically derived under standing also has much to report. So whereas religion may not have much of 'Tactual" relevance to say to science, science has plenty of mteresting things to say to religion: It provides much of the "what" for the "why" and "how" questions that confront us. There are, to be sure, other important inputs on offer as well, notably in the art and in sights inherent in our wisdom/reli gious systems. But if there is a mem brane separating the magisteria of science and religion, it is decidedly semipermeable. Gould is curiously self-contradictory on this point. He can write, "Science and religion must ask different, and logically distinct, ques tions?but their subjects of inquiry are often both identical and maximally meaningful," and can acknowledge that nature is "bursting with relevant information to spice our moral de bates." But then he claims that ethical questions "cannot be answered, or even much illuminated, by factual data of any kind." So why does Gould flip and flop here? As near as I can tell, much of the problem derives from the fact that the book attempts to make a second point, namely, that scientists are prone to commit the naturalistic fallacy?to de rive "oughts" from "ises"?on a grand, overbearing scale. This point is often made with startling acrimony in an otherwise gentle text: Scientists cannot claim higher in sight into moral truth from any su perior knowledge of the world's em pirical constitution. Why shouldn't readers view me as just another arrogant scientist... at tempting to demote religion to im potence and inconsequentiality? NOMA places equally strong restric tions upon the imperialistic aims of many scientists (particularly in sup pressing claims for possession of moral truth based on superior un derstanding of factual truth in any subject). NOMA does forbid a scientific entry into fields where many arrogant sci entists love to walk, and yearn to control. If there is a membrane separating the magisteria of science and religion, it is semipermeable. Phycasso With Physics in the 20th Century ($49.50), publisher Harry N.

The age-old argument between social relativists and scientists, both most recently visited in the Alan Soka I context, are aired in The Values of Science: The Oxford Amnesty Lectures 1997 (Westview, $55). These six essays, edited by Wes Williams and introduced by Jonathan R?e, can be prissy at times but are mostly pithy and eloquent. To learn about a gregarious and mischievous parrot that inhabits the southern mountains of New Zealand, read Kea, Bird of Paradox (California, $29.95). Authors Judy Diamond and Alan Bond summa rize the native flora and fauna, emphasizing the kea and the kaka, its relative. They tell how the kea has adapted to human activities and how this love-hate relation ship continues. Serious Continental birders who need to know the difference between, say, a Verreaux's eagle and a Bonelli's eagle should consult Mark Beaman and Steve Madge's The Handbook of Bird Identification for Europe and the Western Palearctic (Princeton, $99.50). Like other bird books from this publisher, this is not only a use ful guide but also a work of art. 268 American Scientist, Volume 87 I do get discouraged when some of my colleagues tout their private atheism (their right, of course, and in many ways my own suspicion as well) as a panacea for human progress against an absurd carica ture of "religion" erected as a straw man for rhetorical purposes. Who are these "many scientists"? Given the recent spate of locker-room towel-snapping published in The New York Review of Books, I looked for such imperialistic aims in recent books by sci entists and science-popularizers? Daniel Dennett, E. O. Wilson and Robert Wright?but came up short. To my read ing, these books show great respect for the magisterium of religion as Gould de fines it. No question about it: Our scientif ic understandings of nature have on occa sion been accorded the status of ultimate truth and ethical certainty by scientists and nonscientists alike, and Gould has served as an important watchdog in call ing these aberrations to our attention. But to caricature "many scientists" as having "imperialist" agendas smells of "I have a list." At the least, one would have hoped that Gould would have documented these claims with the same care that he documents the statements of 19th-century theologians so that we are able to evaluate them. It would seem that much of his re luctance to celebrate the role that scientific understandings can play in informing our quest for meaning and ethics flows from his fear?unjustified among the "many scientists" I know?that scientists will somehow abuse this process. To close on the positive note that this book deserves, I (and, I would venture, most scientists) am in full-throated agreement with the concept at the heart of his message, that "the causes of life's history (cannot) resolve the rid dles of life's meaning" and that nature greets us with sublime indifference and no preference for accommodat ing our yearnings. We are therefore left with no alternative. We must un dertake the hardest of all journeys by ourselves: the search for meaning in a place both maximally impene trable and closest to home?within our own frail being. Gould's vision of the project before us is equally rich. To anyone who feels cosmically dis couraged at the prospect of life as a detail in a vast universe not evident ly designed for our presence ... con sider the much greater fascination and intellectual challenge of such a mysterious but knowable universe, compared with a "friendlier" and more familiar cosmos that only mir rors our hopes and needs. And then, the eloquent passage that first appeared in Wonderful Life (1989): We are the offspring of history, and must establish our own paths in this most diverse and interesting of con ceivable universes?one indifferent to our suffering, and therefore offer ing us maximal freedom to thrive, or to fail, in our own chosen way.</page></plain_text>
