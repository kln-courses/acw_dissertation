This article interprets France's agenda to propose a 'suave reconquest' of its former colonies, and Sassou Nguesso's forceful mobilization of national and regional sup- port. Beyond the immediate political significance of the episode, however, the article proposes new ideas on the ways in which modern states, North and South, depend on 'tournaments of value' that assign polarized worth to persons, and often back up international deals with transactions in sanc- tified human remains. The tactic, forged in part during the colonial era, illuminates important aspects of today's global imaginaries of domination. Brazza's bones work, in France and Africa, as a carnal fetish that, borrow- ing form various philosophies of power, merges Western and African beliefs in the body politic. Bru Cemetery, Algiers, early morning of 30 September 2006. A group of workers, wearing surgical masks and rubber gloves, started to open a family grave. Nearby, standing on tombstones, a few men in sun- glasses and dark suits watched the procedure. Upon reaching the vault, the workers proceeded to open the coffins and gather the decayed remains in white linen bags, each marked with a name tag. They placed them in small wooden crates that they carried to a platform truck, where six mahogany coffins awaited their precious charge. After they had secured each box in- side a coffin, the workers aligned the lids on top of the caskets and carefully wiped the copper cross and label adorning them. Then they slowly screwed the rivets by hand. The corpses of Savorgnan de Brazza, the nineteenth- *Florence Bernault (bernault@wisc.edu) is Professor of African History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The next morning, 3 October 2006, a truck brought the four coffins in front of a dazzling mon- ument just erected in downtown Brazzaville by the Congo River. This glass and marble affair was adorned with neo-classical columns, a dome, and a pediment topped by a triangular frieze showcasing the Mémorial Pierre Sa- vorgnan de Brazza (Brazza Memorial). At 1 1 a.m. the dedication ceremony began, while a crowd of curious Brazzavillois observed the officials seated on the official tribune. Next to Denis Sassou Nguesso, the President of Congo, they could recognize Omar Bongo Onbimba, the President of Ga- bon, François Bozizé, the head of the Central African Republic, and Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs. The newly enthroned Teke King, Makoko Auguste Ngempio, sat by the Apostolic Nonce, whose black robe and purple trimmings clashed softly with the king's red costume and traditional make-up. Members of the Brazza family, who had flown from France and Italy to Brazzaville, took the time to kneel down in front of the Teke King, descendant of the traditional ruler who had welcomed their ancestor to the Congo. After the official speeches and rib- bon-cutting by President Sassou Nguesso, Congo Navy troops solemnly carried the coffins to an open crypt on the ground floor of the Memorial. A swelling crowd strolled in to look at the fresh wall frescoes illustrating the explorer's life, and to gaze at the coffins. Later that night, Sassou Nguesso hosted a private party in the presidential palace, treating his guests to a lav- ish feast of crêpes and champagne. Public opinion was stunned. Under the title 'An African Rarity', the In- ternational Herald Tnbune reported the morbid transfer as an improbable 1.

If public power in Africa is informed by the idiom of expendi- ture, the building is surely a testament to Sassou Nguesso's return to office after fifteen years of civil war.5 Meanwhile, a number of deals had taken place. Although publicized as a private agreement between Sassou Nguesso and the Brazzz family, the construction crowned two years of negotiations between the French, Congolese, Gabonese, and Algerian governments and facilitated a series of discreet political and economic transfers. In 2004-5, the French government granted several aid protocols to the Congo, cancel- ling a large part of the country's debt. In return, Sassou Nguesso helped France to finalize a diplomatic intervention in the crisis engulfing the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).6 Set in motion by Brazza's bones, the flow of financial funds, diplomatic capital, and polit- ical controversies reminds us that funerals and the bodies of extraordinary men are, among other things, the stuff of transactions moral and material. The political backdrop of this moral economy does not escape the critics of the Memorial, who lament the incongruity of honouring a colonial hero at a 2.

Among them, Algeria holds the double privilege of having defeated French colonialism, and of having recently refused to sign a treaty of friendship with France unless the latter repents of its colonial crimes. In the (post)-colonial triangle traced by Brazza's bones between Brazzaville, Paris, and Algiers, the latter thus stands as polar opposite to Congo-Brazzaville: a traitorous land spitting up the hero's bones to a more amicable - or subservient - French ally. But the repatriation of Brazza's remains is not just an evanescent line in the sky that, one day, will inspire sublime sentences in boring textbooks.

For the first time in colonial and post-colonial history, the corpse of a white man has served as main ingredient in this hegemonic cuisine. Swelled to the size of a transnational ancestor-founder, Brazza engenders a cosmopolitan male brotherhood that sanitizes the continuity between the colonial and post-colonial era. Enshrined as a white ancestor to black cit- izenries, the corpse allows the local magician-in-chief, the President of Congo, to secure access to powerful relics - and to perform a grand sequel to Congo-Brazzaville's series of 'family conjurations' begun during the 1991 National Conference. At the intersection of Western and African imaginaries, Brazza's body demonstrates how power in the post-empire is predicated on the shared logic of carnal fetishism. Beyond biopolitics: carnal fetishism Behind the pompous discourses, the lavish ceremonies, and the vulgar ar- chitecture, Brazza's cadaver is the thing that empowers everything else, the flesh that sanctifies the stone and the substance that charges the shrine. As such, it questions conventional wisdom on the progressive bio-medicalizing of the human body and its proclaimed detachment from political authority. I suggest that regimes of power in the global world, and not just in Africa, cling to reformulated regimes of carnal fetishism, i.e. to beliefs in the sacred nature of human bodies, in their capacity to hold some power in themselves, as organic entities, and in their role as symbolic objects producing public au- thority. This significant departure from Michel Foucault's theories about the body is essential to understand the meaning of Brazza's return to the Congo. For Foucault, biopolitics emerged as a regime targeting the well-being of people seen as 'populations' and 'races', and promoting the physical disciplining of its citizenry.7 Colonial historians have used and criticized Foucault's concept abundantly. For Megan Vaughan, colonial rule re- mained short of a real form of biopower, prevented by Europeans' ethnocentric apprehension of Africans as essential Others.8 For Filip de Boeck, colonialism promoted a regime that subjugated life to the power of death and created a reign of terror transforming populations into living- 7.

By 'sacred' I mean the power and value (invisible, intangible and un- commensurable) that people attach to the person and her body beyond its physical, measurable, and degradable nature. Such lingering visions are not personal only: they shape governmental policies. As the transactions over Brazza's remains demonstrate, governments continue to manipulate the sacred value of certain corpses for precise political goals.12 Writing against the grain of Foucauldian theories, Giorgio Agamben clarifies the function of the sacred in the build-up of modern power. For Agamben, sovereignty is based on the ability to define a liminal state of be- ing for people who, excluded from the community, cannot be sacrificed, but can be killed without retribution. Homo sacer, exiled in a frontier status at the limit of the judicial and the religious, thus defines a purely political space.13 In our post-colonial world, Brazza's consecration demonstrates that homo sacer exists today as a double figure. The first is that of people deemed as disposable, such as the hundreds of young men eliminated by Sassou in an infamous episode of the Congo wars.14 The second emerges 9.

In these modern 'tour- naments of value', contemporary regimes follow in the steps of colonialism, when French rule protected the value of white bodies while enforcing the legal desecration of black ones.15 The politics of carnal fetishism, or the ways in which authority uses the human body as a fetish of power, merge the Janus character of post-colonial homo sacer. Carnal fetishism works through deep-seated contradictions. In the colony, it meshed the doctrine of Christian incarnation with the pre- tence that authority was intangible, yet performed a brutal rule in the colony. It prompted colonizers to install an absolute divide between people and objects -something they did by relentlessly attacking local societies' 'fe- tishistic' beliefs - and, on the other hand, to regard the human body as a sacred object of power.16 As such, carnal fetishism engaged colonizers and colonized alike in a profound reconfiguration of what they considered ma- terial and immaterial, sacred and profane, symbolic and physical. Today, the politics of carnal fetishism explains why the function and meaning of Brazza's sacred corpse (its physical existence) and political persona (its intangible one) are inseparable. The meanings of the neo-co- lonial idol, its function as ancestor, patriarch, and rapist, are produced by the belief, shared by the French and the Congolese, that the body political is, also, engendered by carnality desecrated, carnality desubstantialized, and carnality sanctified. Suave reconquest Although we know how the classic age of imperial hegemony was under- written by intellectual and cultural fictions, we have tended to document global neo-colonialism through hard and heavy evidence, looking primarily at the flow of capital, migrants, experts, raw resources, and diplomatic pa- tronage that determine a large part of the contemporary relations between former métropoles and colonies.17 As a result, we remain quite unaware of the ways in which older imperial fantasies survived the decolonization era, 15.

The revival of the Brazza myth in 2006 can tease out such imaginaries. The Memorial seals the return of Congo-Brazzaville to what can be called the 'Congo complex', a regional agglomeration forged by enduring econom- ic and political ties between the four nations of Congo-Brazzaville, Gabon, the CAR, and Chad, and secured by France's patronage.18 Inaugurated at the end of the nineteenth century, when the colony of Moyen-Congo (Mid- dle-Congo) worked as the administrative and economic engine of the Federation of French Equatorial Africa (1910-60), the Congo Complex survived independence but started to wane after Congo-Brazzaville's align- ment with the Soviet Union (1969), experiencing a final eclipse during the country's democratic transition and subsequent civil wars starting in the ear- ly 1990s. In an exhausted country where the opposition is relegated to small guerilla bands only able to harass civilians, the 'coup' of returning Brazza's bones to the Congo capital has helped Sassou Nguesso to 'refurbish' his rule at home, and assert broader regional ambitions, an endeavour largely made possible by French support.19 Yet Brazza's exhumation and re-interment reveals that France's African post-empire is undermined by diplomatic and ideological erosion. In the triangle traced by the dead man's corpse between Brazzaville, Paris, and Algiers, the latter stands as polar opposite to the Congo Complex. At the time of Brazza's disinterment, bound by a contentious past and connected by several millions of Franco-Algerian migrants, both countries were in the midst of fresh convulsions triggered by the infamous French law on 'the positive aspects of colonialism'.20 On 29 June 2005, Algeria's president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, disparaged the initiative as a case of 'mental blindness bordering on negativism and historical revisionism', and declared that he would not sign the French- Algerian Treaty of Friendship, an initiative dat- ing from 2004 and considered a crucial step in the diplomatic appeasement 17.

The last few years have demonstrated an astonishing revival of imperial pride in some segments of the French citi- zenry, while the 2005 riots led by young French citizens of colour, descendants of migrants of African, North African, and Muslim upbringing coming from former colonies, testify to major changes in the audiences re- lating to the colonial past. In turn, for the French government, Brazza actualizes a dream of reconquest at home. Italian by birth, but French by choice, Savorgnan de Brazza embodies the 'good5 migrants - white, Euro- pean, and Catholic - coming to France in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from Poland, Russia, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, and followed in the 1960s by migrants from North and sub-Saharan Africa. Abroad, the French government confronts two issues in crafting a post- imperial agenda of enduring influence in Africa. It must deal with the real legacy of the colonial conquest (only a dream at the time of Brazza's explora- tions). Second, it must obviate the sharp decline of France's influence in Central Africa, dwarfed by the rise of American influence and of continental super-powers, most of them English-speaking allies of the US (Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and South Africa).22 France's enduring am- bition, however, shows that we need to de-exoticize Jean-François Bayart's hypothesis on Africa's 'strategies of extraversion'.23 While the theory looks at Africa's current economic decline and political marginalization as yet an- other opportunity for local elites to rely on the alienation of local assets for channelling external resources into means of local empowerment, the Me- morial demonstrates that, historically, such strategies have been an eminent pattern of French politics. Indeed, more inclusive and less ethnocentric analyses of Africa's engagement are needed if we want to understand the intricate relations at work between ex-metropoles and ex-colonies in the post-empire. Today, the magic of suave reconquest has replaced the nineteenth cen- tury mystique of 'anti-conquest' popularized by explorers posing as 'men of 21.

In contemporary France, debates on the possibility of renewed relations with Africa are still clouded by nostalgic fantasies and conservative ideologies of republican grandeur. The agenda is promoted by the use of Brazza's immense visual archive, and in particular his famous studio portrait by Nadar, taken in the 1880s after the explorer's second expedition to the Congo (Figure 2), a feat of Orientalism and bourgeois subjectivity. Bearded and bare-footed, dressed in a turban and picturesque rags, Brazza poses as a generic native, vaguely tribal, vaguely Old Testament, leaning on a walking stick like a prophet. The explorer's dark gaze and undulating pose, the heroic hardships imprinted on his suffering body, speak of spiritual force and willpower: a white man gone native in a contained, elegant way - an inspired wanderer dreaming of redemption and moral uprightness. The tools of empire remain conspicu- ously absent, belying the huge economic foundations of the conquest. Only two diminutive metal spheres, probably a compass and a watch, discrete traces of the white man's command of time and space, lie on the explorer's breast next to a small pendant and a leather pouch. The arrangement re- minds the onlooker of an order when intimate, pre-industrial paraphernalia could seamlessly coexist with the cool, metallic tools of modernity, a time when the labour of capital and technology, reduced to minimal signs, could still be thought of as mastered by an erect, triumphant individuality. For the modern reader, the picture conjures up another emaciated freedom fighter in the Congo (DRC): Ernesto Guevara. Far from anachronistic, the parallel unveils a resilient pattern in the Western imaginary; the need to worship 24. The myth was diffused after the mid- 1880s by a string of best-selling memoirs and es- says, and a street-level ubiquity of Brazza's name in consumer products such as cigarettes and soaps.

In the nineteenth century, Brazza's arrival in Africa to free the slaves and deliver the natives from barbarism was likened to the coming of a secular Christ, combining compassion with a brotherly right to interfere. A 1899 text reported how Brazza dived in the water to rescue one of his black work- ers fallen in the river 'until, after suffering from sunstroke, he got a fever that made him unconscious, in the midst of the bush .... For several days [his companions] lost hope to save him from the consequences of the grave incident he had provoked by trying to save a Negro, a domestic!'29 In 2006, the formula provided Philippe Douste-Blazy with ready-made lyrics on Brazza as a visionary man who 'refused to use violence against Africans', thus re-ranking Africans as eternal debtors to an enlightened righteous white patron.30 Today, France's thirst for Africa's resources is strikingly congruent with these colonial epics: At the end of last century, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza participated in the geographic dis- covery of a continent still very absent from maps. Today, I am convinced that Africa is the 'new frontier' for the early twenty-first century. It is an exceptional stake, asking for the international community's audacity, ambition, and respect. The same values that were Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza's own. Everything must be done to make out of the youth, vi- tality, and creativity of this immense continent a chance first for itself, of course, but also a chance for the world, a chance for Europe, and a chance for France.31 From an Equatorial African perspective, the appropriation of the Brazza myth levels out racializing and patronizing hierarchies, depicting colonial invasion as an episode of mutually gratifying exchanges. 'De Brazza came peacefully to conquer our people. He observed the rituals and the customs of the blacks he encountered. He respected them and considered them as equal human beings .... When the King welcomes him, it is as a friend. And it was without difficulty that the King asked Savorgnan de Brazza to come to take possession of the land that would later become occupied by the French. De Brazza has been welcomed as a friend, as prescribed by the laws of African hospitality,' declared Belinda Ayessa, the president of the Congolese Association des Amis de Brazza,32 while President Denis Sassou Nguesso told the press that Brazza had 'treated the people of this country with a lot of love'.33 The narrative does not simply reverse the language of 29.

The repatriation also crowns Sassou Nguesso's return to power. After being torn apart by fifteen years of civil war, Congo-Brazzaville has been put again under his control with the help of French authorities.34 The Me- morial ignores recent divides by jumping back to the fictional origins of the nation. Lifted from the private, domestic space of the family graveyard in Algiers, and enshrined in the Congo, Brazza has literally been resuscitated as the holy ancestor of the Congo Republic. As one commentator observed, 'The Congolese do not like the Congolese, they only have political hatred for each other . . . they would rather adore a stranger than feel respect for a Congolese.'35 Although rulers from the North (Marien Ngouabi, Yombi Opangault, and Sassou Nguesso) have shifted the symbolic geographies of power in the country since 1963, they have never been accepted entirely as legitimate national leaders. For Congolese southerners, Sassou Nguesso remains a Mbochi from the northern forest, a savage and a usurper.36 With the Me- morial, Sassou-Nguesso breaks new ground, in an attempt to assert ritual control over Brazzaville against the first-comers to the land, the Bateke. The historical/mystical status of the Bateke monarchy is highly ambiguous. Considered the first ally of France's encroachment in the region after King Iloo signed the 1880 treaty with Brazza, the Bateke are openly despised for 'having sold the country to the whites', and their overt political influence remains negligible. Gone from the vicinity of Brazzaville in the early 1900, they became the epitome of the colonial vanquished.37 From October 2004 to October 2006, negotiations on the Memorial coincided with a bitter dis- pute on the election of the new Teke king and opened a window on the Bateke authorities' position in the Congo state. While a majority of Teke electors designated Auguste Nguempio, another group backed Maurice In- tsilambia, a member of the Sassou-Nguesso entourage and preferred féticheur (ritual specialist). Ignoring Nguempio' s enthronement ceremony, Sassou sent a representative to the rival crowning of Intsilambia, whom he 34. Clark, 'The neo-colonial context of the democratic experiment'. 35.

At the 2006 ceremony, Equatorial African leaders - older, fleshy, and regal - looked like predictable big men, while French envoys conformed to the fit, middle-aged, and myopic figure that has come to characterize - with a tint of the morgue in vogue among public servants - the elite bureaucracy of the Republic. The Apostolic Nonce, representing the Pope, brought some holiness to this patriarchal assemblage. Women remained backstage, pres- ent only in the capacity of wives and political appendages. The economic and social bases of this order are quickly vanishing in Equatorial Africa, yet the spectacle of patriarchal authority is reinforced through occult and global associations such as Freemasonry and the elite brotherhoods said to connect higher politicians. It also survives at the level of domestic conflict, a fact conceptualized by Gabonese and Congolese so- cial scientists under the model of 'family conjurations' (conjurations familiales).44 'Conjuration' here means the origin of the curse and the pro- cedure needed to heal it. When individual or collective misfortune strikes, usually blamed on unresolved family dissent, or on the work of malevolent or malcontented members of the group (including ancestors), male elders perform a ritual of reconciliation. They organize the reunion of all known members of the family and tease out hidden grievances, wrongdoings, and hard feelings to solve the conflict and reorder power relations in the group. This model remains vital to national politics in the Congo. Thus the in- auguration of the memorial in 2006 is the direct sequel to the rite of conjuration performed by Congolese politicians at the National Conference organized in 1991 to open up the Congolese state to democratization and multi-partyism. For several months, under the guidance of Catholic Bishop Ernest Kombo, hundreds of delegates testified and debated the dark secrets of national history, exposing in particular the abuses of President Sassou Nguesso's regime. The convention was aired on the national television and eagerly discussed by the population. On 10 June 1991, the Conference closed with a famous episode of pardon led by Mgr Kombo. All partici- pants, with the notable exception of Sassou, washed their hands in a public fountain, in a performance hailed as a traditional ritual of reconcil- iation.45 While the 1991 conference secured the demise of Sassou Nguesso's regime, the 2006 inauguration of the Memorial attempts to con- 44.

In 1991, the conference failed and the country entered 15 years of horrendous civil war. Many read Sassou Nguesso's absence as the element bringing the fiasco of the attempted reconciliation. In 2006, with Sassou as the self- proclaimed healer (nganga) of an exhausted nation, the threat of failure lurks again. The celebration uses the bones of an alien ancestor and buries a historical enemy in Congo's ancestral land: Ίη our villages, we mourn our enemies, a form of homage that can be compared to giving the name of Brazza to a school. Yet even the Bamileke, experts in the cult of the dead, do not bury their enemies in their own house.'47 No members of the Con- golese opposition parties were invited to the inauguration.

The children of God and the body of Chnst Indeed, the memorial is infused with religious symbolism. Unveiled on the day of the inauguration, Brazza's statue drew cries of surprise from spec- tators: 'Look, he's the Christ!'52 The first name of the explorer, Pierre (in the original Italian, Pietro), also references St Peter, the 'rock' upon which the Church was built, connecting the Memorial to the sacred city of Rome, adding the Vatican as a holy pole to the post-colonial triangle of Paris-Algiers-Brazzaville . Yet Savorgnan de Brazza is a bit more than Jesus. The sculpted head- scarf, the beard, the pleated robe and the walking stick conflate the figure of Christ with the prophets of the Old Testament, the Virgin Mary, and converts to the proliferating Pentecostal sects in the region.53 The im- age also recalls the leaders of independent churches in the region, and the older power of healers-diviners.54 The architecture of the Memorial follows the same logic. A tropical simulacrum of the Paris Pantheon, both a church and a classical temple, the building is similar to the portable shrines pro- tecting sacred Catholic relics and the glass boxes displaying statues of the Virgin Mary and Christ. The Congolese public interprets the pyramidal fa- cade, columns, and dome as Masonic symbols.55 Finally, the Memorial is not unlike indigenous reliquaries. The rotunda works like the box or the bundle holding the relics of ancestors, and the oversized statue is similar 52. Reported in Simonet, 'Un mausolée pour Brazza'.

This process of religious aggregation fits the narrative of the creative African conversion to Western beliefs and the cunning reappropriation of the Christian faith by local cosmologies.56 In fact, both academic pro- positions function as the flipsides of a single ethnocentric predicament: the existence of a distinct African religious tradition, essentially different from the Christian one. I would argue, instead, that Brazza is one of the many impersonations of power collectively described by Joseph Tonda as the 'Modern Sovereign5.57 Tonda is not preoccupied with the task of di- viding Christian beliefs and indigenous ones, even for the sake of unearthing their creative engagements, but analyses them as part of a sin- gle, imaginary system of domination historically produced by the colonial encounter. This system of power is imagined by the people caught in it through multiple and interchangeable figures called the State, Science, Technology, Religion, Money, and Sex (and embodied in the politician, the priest, the healer, the prophet, the intellectual, God, Christ, the Virgin Mary, Mami Wata, Satan). For Tonda, these incarnations - either sym- bolic figures or real persons - overlap and combine diverse attributes. The Modern Sovereign is characterized by hybridity and mixes different temporalities, imaginaries, and repertoires. To avoid stigmatizing such beliefs as the superstitious remnants of an obscure African tradition, we need to make a quick detour to the colonial period and focus on the human body as a privileged vessel in this imagi- nary. As I have argued in an article published shortly before the inauguration of the Memorial, the fierce struggles between Africans and Europeans in the colony over the role of the body in the labour of public power shows how both Europeans and Africans recognized that the body was a fetish and that power could be achieved through the manipulation of the corporal sacred.58 West Equatorial cosmologies had long perceived a direct, unmediated relationship between the body and authority, as the for- mer represented the privileged location of procedures and institutions that crafted, channelled and controlled power. In doing so, the body was not seen as a physical reality whose existence derived from biological integrity, but as a multiple and fragmentable entity able to be charged with, channel and retain power beyond death and dismemberment. These views were 56.

One of the main battles over the body, power, and death occurred when colonial rulers legislated on funerals and segregated cemeteries in the 1910s. The macabre transfer of hegemonic tactics in the realm of death ap- pears less fascinating than the way they organized around the control of material bodies, showing deep-seated contradictions in the views European colonists had towards the human body. While the law constructed black corpses as dead flesh to be disposed of in hygienic fashion, and launched massive assaults on local regimes of body power, it sought to enhance the untouchability of white corpses and re-sacralize them.59 The Memorial demonstrates how such beliefs endure today. Contrary to theories that suggest an ethnocentric dichotomy between a disenchanted West and a re-enchanted Africa, the Memorial, bringing together locality, flesh, stone, and sacredness/power, works as a commemorative machine at the intersection of African and European regimes of carnal power. The long, mutual history of using bones as power commodities sheds new light on the analysis of post-colonial monuments in Africa and Europe. Their pioneering historian, Gregory Mann, has used them to complement the mostly discursive ways in which the task of bringing the métropole and colony together in a single analytical field has been conducted.60 Mann argues that the memorial for African tirailleurs in Fréjus (France) defines a new 'post-colonial locality' that encompasses the past and the present, and orients the circulation of African veterans and labour migrants be- tween West Africa and post-colonial France.61 In Fréjus, the French recognize the sacrifice of African veterans in the survival of their nation. In Brazzaville, the Congolese government honours the sacrifice of a French colonist in the birth of a new nation. One is a disembodied symbol that allows the circulation of living persons; the other works as a carnal fetish that sanctions the flux of abstract power between partner states. In doing so, the Memorial replicates the function of the Paris Panthéon. Beyond architectural mimicry, both buildings have been produced by stately 59. Ibid. 60.

Both facilitate tournaments of value setting the worth of remarkable corpses against disposable ones. Opened in 1791, the French original celebrated the birth of the Republic by promoting the grands hommes (great men) of the Revolution as an anti-dynastic merit class, based on bourgeois views of fame and moral value.62 Yet the choice of who can be 'pantheonized' reeked of ideological compromise and feuds, while the enshrining of the secular gods of the Nation proved embarrassingly impermanent, ignoble exits following splendid admissions.63 In 2006, the enshrining of Brazza's bones is based on the parallel erasure of countless individuals. During colonial rule, the celebration of white heroes was secured on the routine erasure and disposal of native bodies, the most famous in the Congo being the corpse of the résister and prophet André Grenard Matsoua.64 In today's Congo, Brazza's extraordinary cadaver has also been produced against the forgetting of anonymous victims of the war.65 But the Congo shrine is odd: a Golgotha with a single cross, a pantheon with too many corpses, and, instead of a secret sanctuary sheltering the re- lics of extraordinary kin, a public crypt with alien bones. This logic of indétermination is reinforced by the figure of Brazza as Christ. During co- lonialism, Christian missionaries initiated a regime of symbolic uncertainty in equatorial Africa. First, the resurrection of Christ, in opposition to the power of local relics, is based on his absence from the grave. A troubling disconnect thus exists from the start between the flesh and the power of God. Second, missionaries insisted on the symbolic power of Christian ob- jects of worship, such as the host and the wine. They avoided importing the cult of saintly relics in Africa, as they wished to establish a maximum dif- ference with local religions, and adopted secular administrators' racist denial of local fetishism. The Memorial thus reflects an enduring hesitation 62. The Panthéon was destined to gather all remarkable men, side by side, in timeless glory.

In this logic, Brazza is the ultimate insider/outsider, not simply because he came from abroad as a colonial enemy, but because of his position in three, over- lapping logics of social reproduction. First, Brazza as Christ embodies the flipside of the patriarchal logic. Jesus is a son and emphatically not a father, even if he symbolizes the universal filiation between men and God. Contrary to local ancestors, members of an uninterrupted kin, and to Brazza as private man, interred with his wife and children, Christ talks about the end of mortal and human generation. This contradicts both the logic of the lineage and the logic of ancestors. Second, the legend of the adoption of the explorer by the Teke king in 1880, re-enacted on the day of the 2006 inauguration, casts a shadow on Brazza's position in the local community. Belinda Ayessa, the president of the Brazza Foundation, couched the anecdote in these terms: 'De Brazza has been welcomed as a friend, in conformity with African hospitality. He has been adopted and he has become a foster son. This is the reason why we are able to say "Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza is returning home".'67 If Brazza can be seen as an adoptive son, he should, by the same token, be perceived as an outsider devoid of kinship of his own, driven to seek protection by entering a host family. In the Equatorial region, this social position is akin to a subservient or servile status - a stigma whose enduring power was illustrated, in 2004, when legitimist Bateke revealed that the fac- tious king Intsilambia was a 'serf. This renders Brazza's post-mortem sacralization as forefather of the Congo nation a contradiction in terms, and a clear transgression of genealogical procedures.68 Meanwhile, the myth of the benevolent 'explorer' of the Congo cannot entirely erase con- current visions of Brazza as forerunner of the colonial conquest. His political image (saviour/agressor) tends therefore to be as divisive as his ge- 66.

He is an agent of social barrenness, and represents a major tension at work in the Equatorial African lineage ideology. Any outsider can become an insider through the ancestral technique of fictive kinship and lineage incorporation. But the flipside of this ideology is the threat of witchcraft, what Peter Geschiere has called the 'dark side of kinship'.72 Any insider can also become an out- sider, a malefic enemy of the group - in short, a witch. The role of Savorgnan de Brazza in producing a reversed filial order of filiation and parenthood (witchcraft) has been articulated, in the popular imagination, by a third and spectacular anecdote spelled out by Congo's most famous historian, Théophile Obenga, and aired a few days before the inauguration. According to Obenga, the Teke royal court has dissim- ulated a significant episode in the 1880 encounter between Brazza and Iloo: the explorer's rape of a royal Teke princess, a virgin in charge of keeping the kingdom sacred fire. cIf you want to celebrate somebody who has raped a Congolese woman, be my guest! ... De Gaulle knew very well that Brazza had raped a woman, this is a documented fact, an established, a banal fact that people hide. . . . This is a fact established by oral tradition, a fact that tells about the destruction of the Bateke king- dom, the destruction of the King.'73 The tale reinstalls Brazza's carnal engagement with the Congolese people at the same time as it assaults his legitimacy as ancestor. In today's Congo and Gabon, the betrayal of trust and alliance, symbolized by rape and incest, is a central trope in the popular remembering of colonialism. It provides, also, a central interpretative device for understanding the power of modern political elites. Brazza as forefather and transnational hero thus participates fully in the local imaginary of transgressive ancestry, magic power, and the 69. See footnote 47 and the quotation it glosses. 70.
