<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREAT THINKERS (XIII) IMMANUEL KANT PROFESSOR G. DAWES HICKS, M.A., PH.D., LITT.D., F.B.A. THE close proximity of the nineteenth century to our own age is an impediment in the way of tracing with confidence the lines of its intellectual development, and more especially of estimating the significance of its philosophical speculation. Certain characteristics of the latter are, however, already sufficiently obvious. It is clear, at any rate, that the chief attempts at philosophical construction in the nineteenth century were the outcome of German reflexion; it is clear also that the great thinker who died in I804 set the current of speculative activity upon a course markedly distinguishable from any that had been followed in preceding centuries. As a philosophical epoch, the nineteenth century was emphatically the century of Kant. It began with the elaboration of the idealistic systems which have often been regarded as constituting the advance from Kant; it ended, after the culmination of those systems, in meta- physical conceptions that seemed the apotheosis of what had been propounded in K6nigsberg, with the demand for a "return to Kant," as the condition of philosophical speculation understanding itself and of pushing forward to new undertakings. In more ways than one Kant was the founder of modern philosophy. It was he who gave to the fundamental questions of philosophy the form which they still retain; it was he who first applied the methods of research by which solutions of these questions are still being sought. Immanuel Kant was born in K6nigsberg, a small city on the extreme north-eastern frontier of Prussia, on April 22, 1724. He spent the whole of his life in Konigsberg and never visited any towns other than those in his own province of East Prussia. His father was a poor but very worthy citizen, a saddler and strapmaker by trade; his mother was a woman of intelligence and of a deeply religious nature, largely influenced by the revivalist movement then of considerable influence in Germany known as Pietism. Kant himself always spoke of his father's ancestors as being of Scotch descent, but as to this there appears to be a great deal of doubt. He was the second of a family of nine children, only five of whom, however, survived the years of infancy. His early education was probably rendered possible by the generosity of one Dr. F. A. Schulz, who was the head of the most important school of Konigsberg, the Collegium I9</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPH Y Fredericianum, so called on account of its being endowed by Frederick the Great, and who was impressed by the manifest signs of promise which he discerned in his pupil. Schulz was a man of wide learning, and was also deeply imbued with the spirit of Pietism, and he evidently exerted considerable influence upon Kant's mental development. When the school years were over, Kant began to attend lectures at the age of eighteen, in the year I740, at the University of K6nigsberg. He supported himself meanwhile by teaching, apparently also receiving some little help from an uncle. At the University he gained the personal friendship of the ablest of the professors, one Martin Knutzen, a man of distinct philosophical ability and well versed likewise in the principles of natural science. Through his advice, Kant commenced to study the works of Newton, and in the first instance his interest centred upon mathematical and physical investigations rather than upon philosophy. His earliest work, written in I747, in his twenty-third year, and published in I749, was an Essay On the True Estimate of Moving Forces; and six years later appeared his General Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, an elaborate exposition of the nebular hypothesis of the origin of planetary systems, in which he anticipated by forty years the celebrated work of the great French Astronomer, Laplace. For nine years previous to the publication of this treatise in I755 Kant had been obliged, through stress of circumstances, to act as domestic tutor in various families in the neighbourhood of K6nigsberg. In 1755 he returned, however, to the University, took his Degree as Doctor of Philosophy, and wrote the Latin Dissertation On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World (published in I770) to habilitate, as the Germans say, at the University-that is, to qualify himself for teaching there. He then became a Privat- Docent, a private lecturer, namely, without a salary, taking classes in Logic, Metaphysics, Physics, and Mathematics. The eleven years following were years of extreme hardship and poverty; he had to eke out a living by such stray appointments as he could get. His struggle in this respect was ended in I770, when he was forty-six years of age, by his being appointed to the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics in the University, the duties of which he continued to discharge until 1797, after which year he was prevented from lecturing through the increasing infirmities of age. It was during his career as a professor that his greater works were published. He died on February 12, I804. Kant's chief philosophical works, written during the period of his professorship at K6nigsberg, are the following: Kritik of Pure Reason, first edition, 1781; Prolegomena to every Future Metaphysic, 1783; Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals, 1785; Kritik of Pure Reason, second edition, 1787; Kritik of Practical Reason, I788; 20</page><page sequence="3">IMMANUEL KANT Kritik of Judgement, I790; Religion within the Bounds of Pure Reason, I793; Metaphysic of Morals, I797. It was only gradually that Kant succeeded in working his way to the point of view of the Critical Philosophy. As a student he had been brought up in the traditions of the philosophy of Leibniz, in the form in which that philosophy was then represented in the German Universities. C. F. Wolff, in trying to make Leibniz's philosophy consistent, had reduced it to a mere skeleton of what it was in its author's own hands, and had converted it into a barren system of logical distinctions. Wolff's whole mode of thinking may not unfairly be described as rationalism in its crudest and most arid aspect; and, as thus developed, it fell an easy prey to the more promising method of empirical investigation which had its home in England, and was then becoming familiar to German scholars. "I honestly confess," wrote Kant in the Preface to the Prolegomena, "that my recollection of David Hume's teaching was the very thing which many years ago first interrupted my dogmatic slumber, and gave my investiga- tions in the field of speculative philosophy a new direction." It is, however, impossible in a single article to trace the stages of Kant's Pre-Critical period; and I proceed at once to an account of his philosophy in its mature form. His own investigation Kant was wont to describe as "critical." And by the term "critical" he intended to emphasize the change in the point of view taken by himself from what had been adopted in the earlier philosophies especially of Leibniz and Wolff, but also, though not so explicitly, of Locke and Hume. Trained, as I have said, in the traditions of the first, awakened from the "dogmatic slumber" which that training had engendered in him by the sceptical doubts of the second, Kant, in his subsequent thinking, made it his aim to reconcile the elements of truth he discerned in each of these systems and to transcend them. In their own way, no doubt, Locke, Leibniz, and Hume had been critics too, critics of the conventional notions and assumptions prevalent in the science and popular thinking of their day. But, as a distinguishing mark of philosophical procedure, "criticism" had for Kant a specific and carefully defined meaning, a meaning which it had not previously borne and which it was not henceforward to lose. "Criticism," in his view of it, stood opposed to what he called "dogmatism." And by "dogmatism" he invariably understood any mode of dealing with facts purporting to be known facts without a previous inquiry into the significance and legitimacy of the notions by which such facts were interpreted. In seeking to determine the nature and relations of real things, metaphysical thinkers had freely employed conceptions such as those of ground and consequent, cause and effect, identity and difference, and the like; and, although Hume had called in question the validity of the 21</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY ordinary notion of causal connectedness, yet he had availed himself, without compunction, of most of the other categories, and the problem had never been seriously faced whether so-called "things" were rightly conceived by the help of these and such-like notions at all. The impasse before which the philosophy of the eighteenth century had found itself at a stand was, consequently, not sur- prising. If, for instance, "things" were regarded after a manner sufficiently familiar, as in some way "given" to the faculty of thought or intelligence, and if, further, these "things" were conceived as things-in-themselves, things, that is to say, existing in fulness of being independently of their being known, then it appeared to Kant evident that the only relation possible between the assumed "things" and the mind would be the relation indicated by the term "affections" or "modifications" of the mind, and that what was called knowledge of the supposed things-in-themselves could at the best be only knowledge of the results, the impressions, produced by them. In that case, not only would such knowledge in no sense be, what the interpreting notions made use of led to the belief it was, universal and necessary, but since it was in the first instance, at any rate, knowledge of the subjective furniture, so to speak, of the mind itself, the doubt must ever remain whether it adequately, or even at all, represented the nature and relations of real being. Indeed, one might push Kant's reflexions beyond the point to which he himself carried them in his own introductory statements, and insist that if what we take to be knowledge of things-in-themselves be thus in truth the merely subjective having of impressions, produced by such "things," there would be no means of explaining how from these "affections of the mind" there should grow up the wholly different mental attitude expressed by the phrase "knowledge of things." An impasse of this kind seemed, then, to Kant to be inevitable so long as the interpreting notions which reflective thought employed, and perhaps unavoidably employed, were not first of all subjected to critical scrutiny, and the precise significance they had, other than the obvious one of being modes in which a thinking mind orders and arranges its experience, ascertained. What the nature of a "thing" is apprehended as being will largely depend upon the interpreting notions applied in the process of its apprehension, and the peculiarity of the critical method lay in the preliminary justification it required of the interpreting notions thus applied. Kant further described his investigation as "transcendental," and by this term likewise he gave expression to a characteristic feature of his method of research, a feature also distinctive of much of the speculation which has followed the Kantian. A transcendental treat- ment of experience was explicitly defined by Kant as one in which there is given the ground for a priori determinations in respect to 22</page><page sequence="5">IMMANUEL KANT objects. By a priori determinations he meant determinations which are universal and necessary, as contrasted with what is taken to be a posteriori or particular. And, since all knowledge involves universal and necessary factors, since universal and necessary factors are essential to knowledge of whatsoever kind, a transcendental inquiry was in truth an inquiry into the nature of knowledge as such, an examination of knowledge undertaken with a view to exhibiting the conditions implied in knowing, or in being aware of, anything. A transcendental inquiry thus stood opposed to a psychological investigation into the way in which knowing as an operation or a process of an individual mind happens or is brought about. Con- sidered as a complex of mental events or occurrences, an act of knowing is a particular fact in the natural world, an infinitesimal constituent of the great totality of existence; and, in endeavouring to trace its genesis and history, the psychologist is compelled to use the notions or categories, the a priori principles as Kant called them, without which the said act of knowing could not be known by him at all. The psychologist assumes that this fact, the occurrence, namely, of particular mental events, can be known; he assumes also that the means by which it is known are reliable and trustworthy. But it was just the assumed reliability and trustworthiness of the notions involved in knowledge, whether in knowledge of what we call material or of what we call mental facts, that appeared to Kant to offer to philosophy the initial problem it had to solve. This problem concerned not at all the natural circumstances under which knowing takes place in an individual mind; it concerned not at all the actual contents of the knowledge which might be obtained either by one individual or by any number of individuals. It was restricted to what may be called the logical conditions of knowledge and to determining the range within which knowledge on account of its nature must be confined. To show, then, how knowledge of objects is possible, to discover the ground on which the validity of such knowledge is based, and to fix the boundaries beyond which the validity of what claimed to be knowledge could not be sustained, such was the task which Kant set for himself in the Kritik of Pure Reason. The outcome of his investiga- tion may be said briefly to be the reverse of the familiar Platonic view of the relation of cognition and existence. Plato sharply dis- tinguished the world of ultimate reality, the world of the Ideas (Is8at or E'T?7), the eternal essences in a sphere transcending the sphere of time and space, from the world of phenomena, the world of sensuous things, subject to perpetual flux and change. Knowledge, in the strict acceptation of the term, e7run*1/, there could be, so he held, of the former, but of the latter we become aware only through the dubious, uncertain medium of belief or opinion, So'ea, Kant, too, 23</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY was led, as a result of more than one line of consideration, to draw a sharp distinction between the world of ultimate realities, or noumena, as he named them, and the world of phenomena, or objects of sense. But, unlike Plato, he reached the conclusion that only of phenomena could there be, in the strict sense of the term, knowledge, whilst of noumena, of things-in-themselves, we were unable through the avenue of the understanding to form any positive conception. Kant, then, believed himself in the Kritik, on the one hand, to have established the trustworthiness of ordinary experience, and the validity of the reasoning exemplified in mathematics and the natural sciences, and, on the other hand, to have disposed of the claims of metaphysics to rank as a Wissenschaft. Let us dwell for a while on some of the salient points yielded by the analysis of experience from which the conclusion just referred to was drawn. Kant's discoveries were numerous and important, but perhaps no one of them was of greater significance than his singling out the characteristic of objectivity as that which presented the central problem for a theory of knowledge. Why was it that what is known stands over against the knowing subject as other than and distinct from the act of knowing? How comes it that a subjective activity of the mind, be it produced or not produced by the influence of external things, should carry with it the unique feature, reference to an object? Expressed quite generally Kant's solution of the problem is the following. Sense data received into the a priori forms of intuition, space and time, are apprehended as constituents of objects in consequence of being wrought into the texture of experi- ence through means of the pure notions of the understanding, or categories. The object cognized is, that is to say, essentially a complex of heterogeneous factors; and, in and by the act or process of cog- nizing, a synthesis or conjunction of these factors is brought about. The process involved, in the first place, the multiplicity of sense- material, sense presentations, mere impressions, not per se so much as cognizable, and devoid of any power to group or arrange them- selves. These elements are a posteriori, particular and given, Kant was often inclined to suppose, by the action of real things upon the faculty of sensibility. The process involved, in the second place, two forms or general modes, in which the manifold of sensations is received. As universal conditions of sense perception, these forms of space and time, although sensuous in character, do not belong to any sense, nor are they, although general, notions or concepts. They are pure a priori intuitions, ways in which any intelligence that is like ours sensuously affected must receive the data of sense. The process involved, in the third place, the rules or principles according to which the given elements of sense are combined and, in being combined, are cognized. The manifold of sensuous stuff or material is in itself 24</page><page sequence="7">IMMANUEL KANT a mere aTreLpov, a merely indefinite mass of disjointed particulars; it can become content of knowledge only through being brought into relation with the unity of consciousness, the fundamental identity in the midst of difference. The supreme unity in conscious experience is the unity of the self or ego; and, as referred to the unity of the self or ego, the data of sense have imposed upon them systematic order and connectedness. The categories-such interpreting notions as those of quantity and quality, of substance, of cause, etc.-are the ways in which the Unity of Self-consciousness expresses itself in relation to the empirical detail, the modes in which self-consciousness plants itself out, so to speak, in the given material. And the gist of Kant's contention was that it is precisely the function of this act of synthesis to give to sense-presentations the centre of reference, the unity in difference, which is what we mean by their objectivity, that it is precisely the function of this act of synthesis to be productive of the peculiar component in the object which constitutes it, apart from its special concrete clothing, an object at all. This contention is so opposed to our ordinary conceptions, and so crucial for the Kantian philosophy as a whole, that it is worth while running the risk of being wearisome in order to throw light upon it. Let me now try to state as simply as I can what I conceive to have been Kant's meaning. Popular reflexion habitually takes for granted that the dependent, given, impressed character of sense-affection is responsible for the reference involved in an act of perception to an object. Now, while it is true that in his unguarded moments Kant did sometimes allow himself to slip into phraseology that would seem to imply this popular doctrine, yet to him at any rate the credit is due of having unmistakably demonstrated its falsity. In his own way, he pressed the consideration that sense qualities as elements in the content perceived do not tell the story of their own origin. Be they "affections," or "impressions," or what not, still, even so, their impressed, produced, dependent character constitutes no part of the account they give of themselves to the subject apprehending them, and cannot, therefore, be the determining conditions of the subject's ascribing them to an external object. Kant left, indeed, undisturbed the common psychological view of the way in which sensations come about. But he did insist that as "impressions," as "affections of the mind," sensations are purely subjective modifica- tions, and bring with them no report whatsoever of the source from which they come. Consequently, he turned to the other factors, which analysis had revealed as present in the complex whole called an object, to find an explanation of the characteristic of objectivity. Of these other factors, all are universal and necessary, and the categories, although not in themselves fully formed notions or pro- ducts of thought, emanate from the spontaneity of the Ego, the 25</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY principle that thinks. How, then, can it be the function of the cate- gories to give objective connectedness to the particulars of sense intuition? Is there not an air of paradox in attributing to the spon- taneity of the subject precisely the characteristic in the object which leads us to determine the object as other than, or as standing over against, the subject ? Kant's answer may be expressed in the following manner. The assertion would be paradoxical if the term "subject" in the first as in the second of these references denoted the individual mind. The Unity of the Subject, however, which finds expression in the categories is not to be identified with the individuality of the subject that opposes itself to the object. It is possible for each one of us to make of his own mental life matter of contemplation, and the inner life will, in that case, exhibit a variously compounded unity and identity, the unity and identity, Kant would have said, of an object, an object whose components differed unquestionably from the components of that kind of object which we describe as material, but nevertheless, in Kant's view, an object all the same. On the other hand, the Unity which was the source of the categories was not this unity, not the unity of an object, but the Unity which was implied as a prior condition in making even of the inner life itself matter of contemplation. The Unity which Kant distinguished as transcendental must be understood to refer to that aspect of con- sciousness of which we can offer no further explanation, because any explanatory term would be found to involve it as a precondition. "Consciousness in general" (Bewusstsein iiberhacupt), "original un- changeable consciousness," "the permanent and abiding Ego," "the correlatum of all our presentations"-these are some of the metaphors used by Kant in speaking of this fundamental principle of experience, metaphors which were intended to indicate partly its non-individual, partly its purely formal character. "It is," as William Wallace put it, "consciousness in general which is Kant's theme, just as it is granite in general, and not the block in yonder field, which is the theme of the geologist." Whilst then actualized, if the expression may be permitted, in each concrete centre of consciousness, con- sciousness in general yet transcends the latter in the aspect of what Windelband aptly described as "a super-individual function." In every act of knowing, the individual mind must, therefore, conform to the conditions imposed by consciousness as such; it was precisely in virtue of their being conditions due to the nature of consciousness in general that the categories were universal and necessary. Now, as involved in an individual's act of knowing, the universality and necessity of the categories come to recognition in and through the independent position assigned to the object. The object is appre- hended by the individual as something external to and distinct from himself because the categories by means of which he apprehends it 26</page><page sequence="9">IMMANUEL KANT are not his private property, but the common property of every self-conscious mind. Or, in other words, the characteristic feature of the object, its standing over against the apprehending subject, means that its empirical elements are arranged in a regular, definite, determinate manner, according to a fixed order or prescribed rule, that the individual subject, in apprehending what is offered to him in experience, is compelled, constrained, to conform to the conditions imposed by consciousness as such. The laws of the game are not laid down by him; he is forced to observe the terms on which it is to be played. And he experiences the constraint as something other than himself. The mode of synthesis, that is to say, is not at the mercy of his caprice; it does not vary in different individuals, it does not vary in the same individual at different times. And so, in contrast with his changing states, the object appears as permanent, as the correlate of "the unchanging consciousness," upon which also his empirical individual self, as an object, is dependent. To use Kant's own words, the object is that which steadies, that which gives stability to, the wandering manifold of sensuous intuition. And, he might have added, the object is likewise that which steadies, that which gives stability to, the transient states or phases of the individual mental life. For it is only in so far as the wandering manifold of intuition is thus steadied, through being referred to an object, that the individual subject becomes aware of his concrete self as one and identical. Were the manifold of intuition not referred to an object, "we should," Kant wrote, "have a self as many coloured and as various as the impressions we receive"; or, otherwise expressed there would neither be awareness of self nor any self to be aware of. The unity and identity of the self is realized in and through the unity and identity of the object; awareness of self and awareness of an object are correlative and inseparable aspects of experience. The view taken by Kant of the constitution of the knowable universe follows directly from the analysis he offered of the structure of an object and of the conditions which render objective knowledge possible. As just indicated, subject and object, according to his conception of them, mutually involve each other; experienced fact, that is to say, can only be interpreted in terms of Mind or Intelligence. There can be no fact of the kind we experience as objective that is not related to the transcendental Unity of Consciousness. The latter, in so far as it finds expression in the categories, Kant called speci- fically the understanding (Verstand); and, whilst he would never allow that the understanding produces nature, whilst he would never allow that the concrete content of nature is derived from the under- standing, yet he explicitly asserted that the understanding makes nature, makes it in its intelligible aspect as a systematic, orderly whole of inter-related parts. Nature, in his view, is a network of 27</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY thought-relations into which material has been imported; and, as imported, the material consists of sense-presentations capable of being formed into constituents of objects. Obviously, therefore, as constructions of Mind, and as composed partly of material given to mind, the objects of knowledge can only be phenomena or appear- ances, appearances, possibly, of a reality or realities not thus depen- dent for their existence upon mind, but appearances which in that case are essentially other than and distinct from that of which they are appearances. Within this enveloping unity of phenomenal experience, resting upon the transcendental Unity of Consciousness every knowable object is to be found; and science deserts its proper territory, and strays into regions of phantasm, when it essays to extend its province beyond the realm of sense experience. A science of nature is possible, but a science of things-in-themselves would be a contradiction in terms. For things-in-themselves are not, at any rate, sensations; they cannot, therefore, be received into the sensuous forms of space and time, they cannot be reduced into objects by being connected with the Unity of Self-consciousness through means of the categories. The effort to acquire scientific knowledge of ulti- mate reality turns out to be, in truth, only a delusive attempt to sensualize the Supersensible. Nevertheless, the thing-in-itself was for Kant no excrescence on the critical philosophy; and, as Robert Adamson once said, it is very far from playing the part of "that convenient receptacle for diffi- culties of thought, the unknown and unknowable." Kant, it is true, restricted the range of positive scientific knowledge to the sphere of phenomena. But it was assumed by him as equally certain, throughout his treatment of experience, that the phenomenal itself indicates, contains a reference to, a realm of being other than the phenomenal. For, not only does reflexion on the nature of finite things leave us with a certain characteristic set of problems unsolved, it literally forces upon us the all-important distinction between the limitedness, the incompleteness, of the phenomenal world of know- ledge and the infinitude, the completeness, of the world of real existence. It is to the lines of reflexion in question that I now direct attention. In the first place, Kant laid, as we have seen, stress on the con- sideration that the Understanding is not productive of the world of objective fact. Nature is intelligible, so his contention runs, because it has being only as object for a thinking mind; and it must, there- fore, possess those relations through which alone it becomes intel- ligible for a thinking mind. This intelligibility is, however, but the form of nature. Not only when we view nature in general but in the more special analysis of knowledge itself there appear in constant conjunction the material and the formal factors. Understanding,</page><page sequence="11">IMMANUEL KANT which confers upon the matter of sense intelligible form, has still to accept the sensuous matter. The form of nature, the variety of ways in which its parts are related to one another, depends upon and expresses the Unity of Consciousness. But nature is more than a system of relations; it is a system of related facts. And the concrete content of these facts cannot be explained as in like manner dependent upon and expressive of the Unity of Consciousness. The particular elements in the context of experience are, so far as consciousness is concerned, contingent, accidental, empirical. Nature, then, is dependent upon intelligence in that its form as a related system implies intelligence; it is not dependent upon intelligence for its material, its sensuous detail. These foreign factors, adopted by intelligence, are due, Kant found himself impelled to say, although he was aware that it is a hazardous mode of speech, to excitation of the mind; and the admission of such excitation requires the postula- tion of a reality beyond experience as its cause. On this account, therefore, the object known must be regarded as merely phenomenal of the thing-in-itself. The weakest position of the Kantian philosophy comes here to view, and Jacobi summed up the difficulties of most students of the Kritik when he declared that without the supposition we have been considering he had found it impossible to enter into the critical system, whilst with it he had found it impossible to remain therein.' One objection to the doctrine in question is obvious at the outset. Whoever avails himself of the conception of sensations as "affec- tions" or "excitations" of the mind is, ex hypothesi, identifying the mind of which he is speaking with the concrete individual existence of a particular conscious subject at some specific interval of time and under specific empirical conditions. But, as we have already seen, the Kantian theory in regard to the intelligible relations of natural phenomena is by no means synonymous with the doctrine, pro- pounded, for example, by Berkeley, that the objects of experience are dependent upon the existence of individual conscious subjects. Quite the contrary. The proof offered of the necessary implications of conscious intelligence in nature had been perfectly general in its scope and had been limited by no one of its terms to the particular concrete existence of the individual thinking subject. Nay, Kant had insisted, as I have tried to make clear, that the existence of concrete individual subjects itself called for and was capable of interpretation only in terms appropriate to a world conceived as involving, or dependent upon, Thought or Intelligence. The transcendental Unity of Consciousness was not, that is to say, an existing entity that could be acted upon, or influenced by, other existing entities; it was a general principle, a logical condition, realized in particular existents, Jacobi's Werke, i, p. 304. 29</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY but not itself a particular existent, occupying a position alongside of, or amongst other particular existents. Moreover, the relation of cause and effect was one of the modes in which Unity of Conscious- ness expressed itself in the realm of knowable objects, a relation sub- sisting between occurrences in nature in consequence of the depen- dence of nature upon Intelligence. Now, this relation must be viewed either in one way or the other-either as a relation arising from Intelligence, and in that case intelligence itself cannot be regarded as springing out of it, or as a relation not arising from Intelligence, and, in that case, instead of the critical theory of knowledge, we should be thrown back once more upon the ordinary, crude, uncritical assumption of things and minds, as existing independently of one another, and of experience as resulting from the operation of the former upon the latter. Further, Kant never succeeded in showing how, on this supposition, any organic synthesis of contingent par- ticulars and a priori relations is so much as conceivable. Were the material elements really given in haphazard fashion, no manipulation of them by the understanding would ever transform them into constituents of a world in which rational law and order reigned. On the whole, therefore, this line of reflexion must be pronounced irreconcilable with the main principles of the critical philosophy. Kant has, however, other and stronger arguments to advance in respect to the existence of supersensible realities. He insisted, in the second place, upon a thought which reflexion on the contrast of Understanding and Sense inevitably awakens. The realm of determinate knowledge evinces itself as limited and as limited in two ways. On the one hand, the general forms of connexion entering into knowledge are restricted in their application to the elements of sense intuition, in the absence of which their significance vanishes. But, to draw a limit, even though within its boundaries there may be said to lie all that can be said to be in the strict sense known implies a distinction; and the ground for that distinction must be found somewhere in the nature of Intelligence itself. Reflec- tive thought frames, as it were of necessity, the idea of a reality freed from the limitations of the world of experience and distinguish- able, therefore, from the world of experience. The idea of this super- sensible reality is thus a Grenzbegriff, a limiting notion, and it may at least serve to warn us that sense apprehension has no legitimate claim to be regarded as exhaustive of the whole realm of being. The idea in question may be called the idea of a noumenon, the idea of what would be apprehensible by an intelligence not tied down as ours is to finite categories and to given data of sense. There is yet a third trend of reflexion followed in the Kritik which, although not at first assigned the same prominence as the others, comes in the long run to be the most important of the considerations 30</page><page sequence="13">IMMANUEL KANT that weighed with Kant in carrying his thought beyond this world of space and time. To the categories had been attributed in a word the general function of rendering possible a united connected experi- ence for an apprehending subject. Such connected experience, it had been shown, the presence of the categories did up to a certain point secure; objective law, regularity, possibility of passing from one natural fact to another-all this had been traced to an intelligible ground. Yet, when more closely looked at, the phenomenal world, so Kant urged, will be found to fall short of the unity for which we are in search. Every part of it, when carefully scrutinized, will exhibit marks indicating unmistakably that something more is wanted in order to give satisfaction to the effort, inevitable on the part of a self-conscious being, to work together his experience into one connected whole. Knowledge of the parts presupposes unity of the whole, and it is still incumbent upon us to endeavour in some way to determine what the whole is of which they are parts. Nay more. The very forms of Understanding, requisite and adapted for knowledge of the relative and the conditioned, prove themselves to be inade- quate and ill adapted for knowledge of the absolute and uncon- ditioned totality. But, argued Kant, recognition of this inadequacy, recognition of the problems for the solution of which the categories are insufficient, is only to be accounted for on the supposition that reflective self-consciousness in some way contemplates a world- call it meanwhile a world of existence-other than and distinct from the world of our ordinary experience, which other world is, in truth, the world of things-in-themselves. It was, in fact, from the presence of an additional element in self-consciousness, over and above what has entered into the construction of ordinary experience that the conception of things-in-itself arises and through which it takes the more positive form of a complement making up with the world of phenomena the sum total of intelligible reality. Self-consciousness, then, is not, according to Kant, exhausted in the Understanding and its modes of expression. A self-conscious being exercises also the higher function called by him specifically Reason (Vernunft), and the great problems of the moral and spiritual life group themselves round that of determining the authority which may be legitimately accorded to the deliverances of Reason. Reason, as Kant viewed it, is the faculty which seeks completed explanation of the piecemeal experience presented in cognition; it is the faculty from which emanate Ideas-adopting Plato's term-of the Uncon- ditioned, the Unlimited, the Absolute. Carrying back the fragmentary results of human experience to what seem to be their ultimate issues in a summed-up totality, Reason postulates the three Ideas of the Soul, as the simple, perdurable, immaterial substance from which the phenomena of consciousness are derivative manifestations, of the 3I</page><page sequence="14">P H I LOSOPHY World as a whole of external phenomena, of God as the supreme reality, that transcends, creates, and keeps in relation all the diver- sities of existence. Bringing the instrument of criticism to bear upon these efforts of Reason, it was Kant's purpose to show that we cannot theoretically demonstrate the actual existence of realities corre- sponding to any of the Ideas. For, in the attempt to fill in the content of the Ideas, Reason has no other resources at its command than the categories, and the categories have validity only as forms whereby we construe to ourselves the parts of experience and the connexion of the parts each with each; severed from the sense material which they objectify, the categories lose their meaning and significance. Under these circumstances, then, Reason finds itself readily enough confronted with absurdities and contradictions. The illegitimate and transcendent employment of the categories leads us inevitably to regard the Unconditioned as an object. But whatever realities may correspond to the Ideas of Reason, these realities are certainly not objects, entities that stand over against a finite knower upon which his powers of observation can be directed. Construe the soul as an object, and you do but confuse the pure Unity of Self-consciousness with the empirical ego, and there results a hybrid whose immortality it would not be worth while either to assert or deny; construe the World in its entirety as an object and you become entangled in the antinomies which have perplexed and baffled human thought; con- strue God as an object, and you get the anthropomorphic notions of Deity that have estranged thoughtful minds from religion. The Ideas, then, are not realizable in knowable objects; they have not in experience a constitutive value, like the categories, and when we try to give that value to them they come to be constitutive of illusions merely. So far as science is concerned, the futile attempt to construct unconditioned objects serves but as an occupation of imaginative intellects. The empirical psychologist can pursue his course without the hypothesis of an invisible and immortal soul; the physicist can industriously carry on his researches without troubling to speculate about ultimate atoms or an ultimate void; and the astronomer who has swept the sky with his telescope and found no God need occasion us no alarm. But, whilst he conceived scientific knowledge incapable of throwing light on the great questions of metaphysics-God, Freedom, and Immortality-Kant was very far indeed from suggesting that these are names of non-entities. Although it cannot be known, absolute reality can be-nay, must be-thought; and, however defective the thought may be, it is yet on a higher plane than the relative and discursive work of the Understanding. The faith of Reason has no affinity with the blind credulity of inexperience; rather is it the ripened fruit of the largest experience and the widest knowledge. 32</page><page sequence="15">IMMANUEL KANT And the theses of a rational faith science is at least as little able to disprove as to prove. Furthermore, if the Ideas of Reason possess not constitutive value, they are yet in another and most significant respect supremely valuable. As regulative principles, they direct and govern the activity of the intellect; they enable us to organize our experience, to estimate its worth. They furnish the impulse to know- ledge; they prescribe, so to speak, its problems, and set, at the same time, its ideals. In endeavouring to trace the working of the human mind, we invariably assume the identity of the soul throughout all its changing states, for no thinking being can conceive of himself as more than one soul, and the very notion of a soul as not one and identical involves a scepticism that strikes at the very possibility of knowledge. Yet to work out this apparently simple presupposition, to connect the diverse phenomena of the empirical subject as if they were states of one identical soul-that is the never completely attained goal which psychological science has before it. It is the ideal towards which psychological science strives, and it is likewise the motive which originates the striving. So, too, men assume, in however dim and confused a way, from the earliest stages of culture, that the world of experience is one whole, for even the uncivilized man looks upon the world as being in one time and in one space. And yet to make manifest the unity of the world, to show the natural inter- connexion of all its parts with one another, to exhibit all its pheno- mena as if they were constituents of one systematic universe-that is the ultimate goal of physical science which in truth it never com- pletely attains. It is the ideal towards which physical science strives and it is also the motive which originates the striving. Finally, the intercourse of the individual mind with nature never fails to awaken the thought of a supreme Intelligence in and through whom mind and nature are related. The consciousness of a divine existence has been at the root of the religious experience of men in all ages, and to live as if that consciousness conveyed a true report has been the aspiration of the purest minds. And yet to free the thought of God from all obscurity, to reconcile with it the fate that befalls individuals and the history of the race-that would be to attain the goal of religious reflexion, no less than the last result of philosophy. It is the ideal towards which all philosophy and all religion strive, it is also the motive which originates the striving. Science, then, reposes ultimately upon a faith, a hope, a trust- the faith of Reason in its own supremacy or in the rationality of the world. The Ideas of Reason are not ideas of objects, but they are Ideas through which we go in quest of the meaning of objects. Man, however, doth not live by science alone, and the logic of science is not the sole code of his intellectual and spiritual life. The examination of our nature as moral agents in the Kritik of Practical Reason enabled C 33</page><page sequence="16">PHILOSOPHY Kant to discover a significance of the Ideas richer and deeper than the regulative import they possess in the field of theoretical cognition. Already Reason had evinced itself as that in experience which is primordial and supreme; already the Ideas of Reason have been seen to be, in reference to the world of sense, Ideas of worth or value- Ideas of what should or ought to be-and, as such gradually, though never completely realizing themselves in the direction they give to the processes of knowing. But, whilst our theoretical experience exhibits no other than determined objects and occurrences, each of which might find a kind of explanation in a statement of the relations in which it stands to the other members of the system, practice or conduct exhibits what Kant insisted must be called a fact, yet a fact which from its nature can find no place in the system of reciprocally determining objects, but which requires as the ground of its possi- bility, over and above the categories of the Understanding, the notion of Freedom. The fact in question is the fact of Duty. In the fact of Duty Kant found a positive exemplification of that kind of reality to which the Ideas of Reason had all along been leading, a reality, namely, which although having a definite content, is in no sense an object in the context of experience. Duty, that which ought to be, indicates something altogether distinct from the objects of nature, something which does not stand over against us as other than and external to ourselves, yet something nevertheless whose reality is none the less certain. The truth with which we are here concerned evidently has specific reference to the nature of man. From the treatment of cognition itself, it had become obvious that man cannot be regarded as merely a natural object. The human subject, partici- pating in the Unity of Self-consciousness, is clearly more than the empirical ego that can be psychologically examined and dissected; the supersensible factor in his being expresses itself in the notions that render a sensuous world possible and in the Ideas that carry his thought beyond it. When, however, man is considered as a moral agent, his two-fold character becomes still more strikingly apparent. Looked at from one point of view, man undoubtedly belongs to the realm of nature. His appetites, his impulses, his inclinations have a natural origin, and come about through his connexion with the things of sense. Did he, however, belong entirely to the realm of nature, his actions would be determined solely after the manner in which every event in nature is determined, mechanically, inevitably, accord- ing to the law of causation. Yet self-consciousman ascribes his actions to himself, regards himself as determining his own line of conduct, con- ceives of himself as the source of what he resolves or wills. And Kant's contention was that a man who can only act under the idea of Free- dom must be free; a man who thinks himself free is ipso facto free. Freedom, then, the characteristic of man as a member of the spiritual 34</page><page sequence="17">IMMANUEL KANT or supersensible realm, cannot but be accepted as a reality, even though we can give of it, in terms appropriate to theoretical know- ledge, no explanation. Now, freedom is only another name for self- determination; it is identical with autonomy of will, with Reason as practical prescribing a law for itself. That law, the moral law, comes to recognition in the fact or consciousness of Duty. In the conscious- ness of Duty we have no other than the Supremacy of Reason, as constituting the very core or essence of Self-consciousness. The "I ought" of Duty is the assertion by the rational self of its own authori- tative rank as contrasted with all that belongs to the empirical ego, the assertion of its own sovereign pre-eminence over the impulses and inclinations of the sensuous side of our nature. And since Reason has here to do, so to speak, with itself-to determine its own life, to make its own maxim the principle of its action-it requires nothing but what is capable of being fulfilled, the sollen implies k6nnen. Accord- ingly, the ideal of Reason, which in the sphere of theoretical know- ledge took the form of faith or trust makes itself felt in practice as an unconditional command, a categorical imperative. The realization of the good will is neither a merit that calls for praise nor a means to gratification as a reward; respect or reverence for a self-imposed law is the one feeling that accompanies it. Hence Kant was the strong opponent of all Trinkgeldmoral, which is ready and willing enough to perform the virtuous deed, and then holds out its hand in the hope that some little consideration in the shape of pleasure may fall to its lot, and the merciless critic no less of that Tugendeitelkeit, which prides itself upon having prudently chosen the better part and upon having won real bliss thereby. There should now be no difficulty in seeing why Kant assigned what he called the primacy to Reason in its attitude or function as practical. For only in respect to practice or conduct does it, in his view, become absolutely impossible for any reflective mind to interpret Self- consciousness after the fashion of objective fact. In theoretical experi- ence the Ideas of Reason suggest the possibility of the orderly systematic laws of phenomena being ways in which a spiritual or noumenal reality appears to us, but in the sphere of conduct this possibility gains the additional evidence needed to convert it into assured certainty. Reason in relation to practice brings before us in very vivid fashion a mode of being transcending the limited sphere of the categories, and only from what there is given in the sphere of practice can anything definite be concluded as to the further deter- mination of the world of spiritual reality. Kant never wavered in regard to the supreme importance of Reason in the universe of being. We think, and must think, the ends prescribed by Reason to be the dominating factors in the realm of intelligible reality. The chief end prescribed by Reason in its practical aspect, the subordination, 35</page><page sequence="18">PHILOSOPHY namely, of the sensuous side of our nature to the requirements of morality, postulates as the conditions of its fulfilment the immortality of the soul, positive freedom of will, and the existence of an intelligent ground of both. What, then, the theoretical Reason in that it is weak through its dependence upon sense could not do becomes possible for the moral consciousness which is not so dependent. Instead of the bare idea of the permanence of a thinking substance, it offers us the practical and rational certainty of the unbroken continuance of the individual's self-conscious life as progressively realizing the moral law. Instead of the contradictory notion of the phenomenal world as complete in itself, it offers us the practical guarantee of freedom in self-determination, and with it of man's citizenship in the spiritual kingdom. Instead of the mere conception of an absolute Being whose existence could not be proved, it offers us the practical warrant of the reality of a Mind that is morally perfect and in and through whom the harmonizing of the spheres of sense and of Reason is secured. Thus the Kritik of Practical Reason expands and gives concreteness to the abstract conception of Reason as Self-determining which alone had remained from the analysis of theoretical knowledge. Reconciliation of the two spheres, those of necessity and freedom, which seemed at first so disparate, Kant came to recognize as incum- bent upon philosophical reflexion, owing to the circumstance that the ideals of Reason have to be realized in the phenomenal world. And in the third Kritik, the Kritik of Judgement (Urteilskraft), he faced and wrestled with this final question: What conception are we compelled to form of nature, if it is to be regarded as the field of action, the field of development, for conscious subjects with moral and spiritual ideals? It was through means of the notion of the adaptation of empirical fact to the ends of Reason, through the notion, in other words, of purpose or design in nature, that he attempted to span the gulf between the two worlds previously kept apart and to solve the problem in which his researches so far had culminated. In two specific departments of the natural world he found illustration of the adaptation for which he was in search. On the one hand, the analysis of aesthetic judgements, judgements asserting that objects are beautiful or that nature is sublime, reveals, he argued, the fact that the opposition of sense and thought can be transcended, if not in knowledge, yet in feeling. The appreciation of beauty arises in the case of the consciousness of an object in which the particulars of sense are felt, if not known, to be in conformity with the demands of Reason. Such judgements rest, it is true, upon subjective experience, and yet we unhesitatingly claim for them universality and objective validity. Beauty would seem to be for us the realization in the phenomenal world, and as if by free grace, of an idea that cannot be verified in knowledge, the spiritual breaking 36</page><page sequence="19">IMMANUEL KANT through, as it were, the impedimenta of sense and giving us an Ahnung of what lies beyond. So, again, the sublime in nature indi- cates the presence of a higher greatness than the materials of nature can hold or express. Thus the starry heavens, which at first by their immeasurable magnitude appal us, come at length to suggest to us the majesty of the unconditional moral law within us, and hence seem to reveal to us something in sympathy with our essential and better self. Consciousness of the beautiful and of the sublime leads us, then, to discern in nature the work of a spirit akin to our own. On the other hand, still more markedly is the appearance of objective validity in the teleological judgements we pass on certain phenomena of outer nature. Our world is the home of organic life; and, in regard to organic beings, we seem compelled to resort to the category of purpose. We find in them a mode of growth wholly unlike the only mode of growth compatible with mechanical principles, the addition, namely, of part to part. We find in them, again, a mode of structure not in the least resembling such an aggregate of components as is exemplified in inorganic things, for the whole and the parts of an organism appear to stand in a position of mutual dependence and reciprocal determination. In interpreting the existence and growth of organic beings, we inevitably, therefore, bring to our aid the con- ception of causality according to ends, a conception of causality in which the parts do not determine the whole but the whole the parts, in which the idea of the whole is antecedent to the existence of the parts. We cannot, however, stop here. In our judgements in respect to organisms there is and must be a perfectly general principle involved. Otherwise the possibility of passing such judgements in this special case would be inexplicable. And this general principle is none other than the idea of the structure of nature as being adapted to Reason or Intelligence. The employment of the teleological principle with respect to organisms suggests, and indeed compels, the extension of it to the world as a whole, and more especially to the entire sphere of human life. When, however, we fashion to ourselves the idea of the intelligi- bility of nature in its contingent particulars, we must of necessity take such idea to be that of a determination of the particular by an Under- standing wherein the particular, for us contingent, is a necessary expression of its universal principles. Thus, the more concrete expression of the idea of the intelligibility of nature, of end in nature, is the idea of an intuitive Understanding, an Understanding that produces the particulars in and through the representation of the whole. So far as the sphere of theoretical knowledge is concerned, the idea of such an understanding is of no more avail than the regulative principles of Reason, of which, indeed, it may be said to be a concrete expression. Moreover, in the sphere of theoretical cognition it can 37</page><page sequence="20">PHILOSOPHY never be possible to regard any one part of what is known as itself constituting an absolute end. But in the sphere of practice a final end is presented. Man, not as a natural product, but as the bearer of the moral law, is a final end, a final end not merely in respect to nature where such a conception is, indeed, foreign, but in the whole system of intelligible reality. An ethical teleology, according to which the entire system of real fact is adapted to the attainment on the part of human beings of the life of goodness, may be said, therefore, to be the final form of the Kantian metaphysics. "The world," Kant averred, "must be represented as having originated from an Idea if it is to harmonize with that use of Reason without which we should hold ourselves unworthy of Reason, namely, the moral use, which rests entirely on the idea of the Supreme Good." Even from an account of the critical philosophy so meagre as the foregoing it is apparent that divergent principles come to light at different stages in the development of the system. Taken as a whole these divergent lines of reflexion exhibit a suspicious tendency to fall asunder, and not seldom the devices to which Kant had recourse for the purpose of holding them together present the aspect of being strained and artificial. Thus, it is not surprising that various antagonistic streams of metaphysical speculation found their starting-point and many of the arguments by which they were sup- ported in the Kantian philosophy. By following out the central thought of Kant's theory of knowledge and the path suggested by his treatment of Reason and of the idea of end or purpose, his imme- diate successors reached a view of existence as dependent in its entirety upon one ultimate ground or principle of Self-consciousness, the view characteristic of Post-Kantian idealism (Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel). Again, in so far as stress was laid in the Kantian philo- sophy upon the necessity of assuming things-in-themselves, as real entities which were the causes of sense-impressions, it prepared the way for that form of realism which was subsequently developed by Herbart. Once more, the primacy attributed by Kant to the practical Reason led by a series of easy stages to the metaphysical theory of Schopenhauer of the Will as the ultimate reality. I should like, however, in conclusion, to revert to the considera- tions which induced Kant to describe the world of things-in-them- selves as a complement making up with the world of phenomena what we may call the world of intelligible existence. As the Kantian Kritik proceeds, and stage by stage the supreme significance of Reason or Self-consciousness in the structure of reality as a whole is brought to light, it becomes clear, I think, that Kant had offered no sufficient ground for maintaining that the expression just used, a complement to the world of phenomena, is either accurate or justifi- able. In developing his conception of Self-consciousness, Kant 38</page><page sequence="21">IMMANUEL KANT himself effectively disposed of the view that the realm of phenomena and the realm of things-in-themselves form two parts of the world of existence, the term "existence" being applied in the same sense to each. It would have been truer to his own mode of interpreting reality had he said that in the strict meaning of the term "existence" the world of phenomena does not exist. For he made it abundantly evident that phenomena cannot be regarded as separate independent entities, that they can be no more than the orderly connected ways in which reality is apprehended by a finite mind under the restrictions of sense-intuition. The reality of a phenomenon certainly, therefore, did not indicate for him existence of that phenomenon in the ultimate sense; it indicated rather the orderly connexion of one part of the experience of a thinking mind with other parts. This conclusion, however, having been reached, we can readily see how easy it was for Kant to fall into the habit of treating the world of experience after the fashion of a resultant, produced by the inter- course of two entirely unknown entitities-on the one hand, the unknown things-in-themselves which are other than the mind and, on the other hand, the equally unknown thing-in-itself which is the mind. And then it followed, by an inevitable inference, that ultimate reality eludes knowledge, that real being can be affirmed only in so far as a ground of explanation for the limited and finite character of knowledge must be sought. Yet, by the help of such a supposition, the finite and limited character of knowledge cannot itself be regarded as connected in any vital or integral fashion with the ultimate nature of existence, but only as in some inexplicable and mysterious way following from it. In short, the conception of things-in-themselves which thus emerges evinces its untenability in face of the following dilemma. If things-in-themselves are in no way connected with things as known and do not enter into the same system with them, the assumption of their existence aids us not at all in solving the problem of the possibility of knowledge; if they are in any way connected with things as known and do enter into the same system with them, it cannot be legitimate to deny to them the relations, the connexions, which would render them possible facts of knowledge for a self- conscious subject. Kant's own criticism itself affords, that is to say, sufficient warrant for refusing to recognize the possibility of any realm of the Unknowable, however unhesitatingly it has to be admitted that vast regions are to us unknown. 39</page></plain_text>
