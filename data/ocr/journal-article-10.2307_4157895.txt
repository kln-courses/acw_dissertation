Edited by Poul Jespersen and A. Vedel Tining. Published by Dansk Ornitho- logisk Forening, Ejnar Munksgaard, Copenhagen, 1950: 10 X 61 in., 272 pp., with 32 photos, 12 figures, and 10 maps. Paper. Dan. kr. 18. This publication in English of the collected papers of H. Chr. C. Mortensen honors this pioneer of bird banding on the 50th anniversary of his first intensive banding efforts. Like many European scientists, he was a schoolmaster who devoted all his spare time to research. His innovations were numerous. He was the first to band birds in large numbers for the specific purpose of studying migration. His initial attempts in 1890, with zinc bands, were unsuccess- ful. He then designed aluminum bands and in 1899 marked 165 Starlings (Sturnus indgaris). He stamped numbers and letters on the bands so that each banded bird could be identified with certainty if retaken. He experimented with color banding and tail clipping in order to study individual breeding birds. Realizing the necessity for publicity if his work was to suc- ceed, he corresponded with ornithologists at home and abroad, seeking their cooperation. Many of the facts which Mortensen obtained by close observation have long since become general knowledge. The important point is that his careful observations were published for the information of other ornithologists. He recorded the following observations on subjects which now are considered essential in serious field studies: the manner of feces disposal at the nest of a Starling (pp. 26-27); the return of marked Starlings (p. 27) and White Storks (Ci- conia ciconia) (pp. 208-216) to the same breeding areas in subsequent years; pre-migration wandering of young Buzzards (Buteo buteo) (pp. 39 and 59) and Kites (Milvus milvus) (p. 59) in different directions from the breeding area; brood size in Buteo buteo, and the presence of weaker nestlings "always ... in the broods" (p. 108); the importance of stork pellets for food analysis. He began a skin and skeleton collection for the study of plumage and age differences. He foresaw the future need for international laws protecting waterfowl (p. 173). His observations led him to ask the following questions about migrants (p. 45): "Where do they come from and whither do they go? How do they know their way? How high in the air do they go? How many miles do they travel in an hour? What moves them to change their place? Do the young or the old first leave the district or do they accompany each other?" In order to learn more about the status of migrants he sent well-considered questionnaires to those who found his marked birds. He soon learned that storks and birds of prey brought him more returns than did passerine birds. Through data gathered on the direction of migration from Denmark, he was able to report on the winter home of certain species, notably the Green- winged Teal (Anas crecca) and White Stork. Any field worker who has tried to trap and band adult birds at their nests will be impressed by Mortensen's ingenuity in designing self-emptying traps for Starlings (pp. 74-79). Due to his knowledge of the habits of the Starling, he trapped 160 of them in one month. Perhaps of equal value to the scientific contribution ma(le by a man is the philosophy which motivates him. It is fitting, therefore, in reviewing a memorial volume honoring this pioneer ornithologist, to quote two passages from him. "Every human being has the need of spiritual revival through communion with the unfalsified, Wild Nature!" (p. 228). "And when this puzzle is eventually solved, new ones will arise and stimulate the enthusiasm of those who study the manifold ways of life and seek to understand them. There is something very satis- fying about getting an answer from Nature to one's questioning-if one has asked in the right way!" (p. 65). The anthropomorphism appearing at times in Mortensen's papers is now passe, but this can be overlooked by the reader who considers the date of writing and recalls that this style</page><page sequence="2">224 WILSON BULLETIN December 1950 has not yet completely disappeared from our own ornithological literature. The papers are primarily of historical interest-so great has been the progress in banding with its concomitant contribution to our knowledge of migration! At the same time, Mortensen's thoroughness and persistence should give encouragement to those now exploring new aspects of bird study. Students of life histories, banding and related problems will find many pertinent tips in his papers. It is unfortunate that the translation was not into idiomatic English.-Andrew J.
