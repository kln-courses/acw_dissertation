Although the Biblical text which Caravoglio has cho- sen to illustrate (Luke II: 21-39) implies that the aged Simeon and the temple priest were two distinct persons, both were frequently represented as a single figure. Cf. D. C. Shorr, "The Iconographic Develop- ment of the Presentation in the Temple' Art Bulletin, xxvIII, 1946, pp. 17-32. 8. The orthography in this portion of the letter (verso, lines 4 and 5) is unclear. Rodin's Mastbaum Album Jacques de Caso THE MASTBAUM ALBUM is the only sketchbook by Rodin mentioned in the literature and publicly dis- played.2 It may be the only one of its kind to have been preserved intact and the sole example of draw- ings dating from Rodin's earliest years.3 It is now owned by Mrs. Jefferson Dickson of Beverly Hills, California. The album shows the variety of subjects which one normally finds in mid-nineteenth century sketch- books by painters and sculptors: drawings of animals, landscapes, scenes, and personages observed in the daily indoor and outdoor environment, copies or nota- tions after works of art, studies after the model, ideas and projects. Had it not been signed and authenti- cated by Rodin in 91 6, the Mastbaum Album might have raised an impossible problem of attribution, since almost none of the drawings it contains relate in any way to Rodin's known sculpture or drawings. Some twenty-five drawings show the young Ro- din's interest in domestic animals and wildlife. Some might have been observed from life in the country- side before Rodin's return to Paris in I853 (page in- side front cover, 5, and the versos of 6, 17, 21, 23 and 26). Studies after animals kept in menageries are more precise than others (2 v., 24, 34, 35). They attest to a more attentive study of the model-in one in- stance several sketches of the same head appear on the same page (2v.). Two sketches of dromedaries (14 v., 30)- though schematic - strike an exotic note. They bring to mind a series of small drawings with oriental subjects a la Fromentin kept in the Musee Rodin, whose exacting manner recalls that of mid- nineteenth century vignettes (M.R. 22, 63, I45-46, 223-24,241). The drawings of horses fall into two groups. The small sketches executed with pen were obviously made from memory (3, 20, 30, 32, 33). They elaborate on a most popular nineteenth-century theme, the man and the horse. They show riders (I9, 30), a possible Rider of the Apocalypse (33), and an athlete in the nude running alongside horses (27). These are an evident variation on Gericault's paintings of horses which Rodin later discussed in his writings.4 Two pages show horses pulling a cart and passenger car- riages (2, 4v.), a theme favored by mid-nineteenth- century painters and draughtsmen from Gericault to Constantin Guys and Carpeaux.5 In addition to drawings of animals there are three full-page landscapes (I9V., 26, 29) done in a soft manner which emphasizes depth and tonal values in the motive. They are very close in style to the draw- ings of similar sites usually assigned to Rodin's Bel- gian period (I871-77). Sketches of human figures appear on many pages. Two pages show drawings of the nude model in a conventional stance-seated on steps or leaning against the model stand-advocated in most art schools of the period (i I, 12). A drawing of the same model in the same pose as shown on page 12 is kept at the Musee Rodin (M.R. 58). A few pages in the album illustrate scenes with people involved in daily activities. The couples represented on pages 27, 28, and 29 v. may relate to personages observed on a stage rather than to a project for a group.6 Some fig- ures on page 8 are inspired by the daily environ- ment-a view of bathers in one of the several floating swimming pools anchored in the Seine around I850. Thirteen pages make a distinct iconographic and stylistic ensemble relating to an unknown program. They represent two frontal figures (in some cases one) standing on either side of a central support or open- ing. On page 4, a figure with a definite Canovian flavor points at a simulated inscription on the support. The series includes male personages, clothed or nude, [155] NOTES</page><page sequence="2">frequently holding attributes-a club, a bow, arrows and shields (2, 4, I4-I6, I8, 22-23). Two pages show them in a restful stance- that of the Hercules Farnese (I4, 22)-though one (I8) displays them animated with floating hair and draperies. In one instance, this recurrent composition shows mature, clothed angels with large wings (I7). Such bulky figures owe much to mid-nineteenth-century religious statues by Rude and particularly Preault.7 The high-waisted figures of virgin martyrs (20) draw on late gothic prototypes. Leaning slightly towards each other, they display the slender proportions common in Antonin Moine's cele- brated angels.8 The whole series derives from Renais- sance and later arrangements.9 The pattern was strongly reactivated in the second half of the eigh- teenth century and was commonly used throughout the nineteenth century in monumental fireplaces and funerary architecture. The sketchbook presents numerous iconographic riddles. One composition appears on three different pages and in three different sizes (5 v., 23, page inside back cover). Though one page bears the caption Midas (and the Judgment, crossed out) the drawing does not relate to the Midas narrative. Page 13 may show God the Father Holding the Orb (?) in a bal- anced composition somewhat reminiscent of early nineteenth-century neoclassical arrangements. Page 24 v. shows a similar frieze-like composition; the sub- ject, possibly Anacreon Visiting Sappho, evokes a neoclassical mood and reminds one of early nine- teenth-century prototypes though such subjects and style were much in favor in academic competitions around 1850-70. Page I v. could be an indication for a composition of Dante and Virgil in Hell manifest- ing Rodin's earliest interest in the Divine Comedy. Quite expectedly, copies of works of art appear in the sketchbook. The drawing on page 21 seems to have been inspired by an early neoclassical sculp- ture and Rodin's handling recalls closely Gericault's strong modeling with sharp tonal contrasts. A Virgin and Child on page 25, most awkwardly executed, bring to mind eighteenth-century prototypes. A small head with a Phrygian cap (23 v.) is the only copy after the antique. The Goujounesque figure on the same page and the putti of pages 7 and 22 v. evoke a theme most popular in French decorative sculpture around I850.10 The schematic sketch of the putti of page 22 v. is reminiscent of the groups commissioned for the attic of the Nouveau Louvre facing the Cour Napoleon, after I853.11 Several pages show other themes and arrangements popular in French sculpture around i850. Page 3 v. illustrates the typical pyramidal grouping common in heroic narratives,12 maternities, and charities. The drawings on pages 29 v. and 30 v. partake of that tra- dition, though they show only groups of two figures. Paired standing figures (28, 35 v.) were popularized in France by Canova's imitators, both sculptors and painters from Prudhon to Carpeaux. Page 35 v. bears a close relationship to Carpeaux's sculpted sketches from the late i86o's and early I870's showing stand- ing personages and alluding to mythological or mod- ern anecdotes.13 The drawings in the Mastbaum Album fall into two distinct groups characterized by the style and me- dium. The drawings executed with pen in brown or black ink and washes-with occasional pencil under- drawing-were executed indoors and from memory. Therefore, they do not preclude Rodin's use of two- dimensional sources. They consistently show a man- nered calligraphic approach which stresses swaying stances and anatomies, elongated proportions, and a prophetic inclination to abbreviate extremities and to mask them under hastily-executed hatchings. Most show very awkward foreshortenings and hesitant out- lines. Only when the drawing lacks details and sug- gests movement, do the outlines acquire veracity, strength, and elegance. Most of these drawings in ink are found on the recto of the leaves-an indication that they comprise a first series in the execution of the sketchbook. The two drawings of nudes may provide a chronological indication: they can hardly relate to Rodin's studies at the Petite Ecole since the affected pose of the model and the hazy treatment of the vol- umes executed with the stump contradicts the prin- ciples of free drawing advocated by his early teacher, Lecoq de Boisbaudran. Furthermore, none of the sub- jects illustrated in the album reflect the curriculum of the Petite Ecole. One is therefore inclined to date the series before or very shortly after i854.14 Most of the drawings executed in pencil are found on the verso of the leaves. They show the same man- [156] NOTES</page><page sequence="3">nerisms and deficiencies of the pen drawings, but they lack the exacting calligraphy of the former. Oc- casionally they display a graphic dexterity and a more convincing rendering of volumes, which indicates a greater manual maturity, progress in naturalism, and later date (v., v., Io, iov., 14 v., 22 v., 34), the page inside the back cover). Pages 3 v. and 30 v. show an unexpected skill in characterizing movement and volumes, and manifest the work of a fully mature hand. List of Drawings I am indebted to Professor Charles Seymour, Jr., of Yale Uni- versity for calling my attention, years ago, to the Mastbaum Album and to Mrs. Jefferson Dickson of Beverly Hills, Cali- fornia, who generously authorized its publication. The Mast- baum Album contains thirty-five leaves numbered in ink from one to thirty-five in the lower left corner of the recto. These old numbers may not reflect the original order of the leaves since the verso of leaf 6 shows a counterproof of the recto of leaf 5. Before it received its recent binding, the album bore its original maroon cardboard cover with the printed title ALBUM. No watermark is apparent in the paper. Four leaves, as is common in nineteenth-century sketchbooks, are of tinted paper: 3I and 34 in light gray, 32 and 33 in light brown. My description begins with the drawing inside the front cover.

Judith Cladel, Rodin, sa vie glorieuse, sa vie in- connue, Paris, I936, here quoted in the 1950 edi- tion, p. 73: ". . . Auguste Cheffer, qui avait epouse sa cousine germaine Anna Rodin, fille d'Alexandre, ressemblait beaucoup a son illustre cousin. J'eus l'occasion de le constater quand le maitre sculpteur me chargea d'une mission diplomatique. II s'agissait d'obtenir de M. Cheffer, alors septuagenaire, un petit album de croquis et de dessins qui dataient de la prime jeunesse de Rodin. Le cousin conservait cet objet dans le coffre-fort de son magasin de graveur- heraldiste, rue Saint-Sulpice. II me le montra volon- tiers, mais ne voulut pas accepter de l'echanger contre une sculpture, ainsi que Rodin le lui faisait proposer. Le precieux album se trouve aujourd'hui dans les collections du musee Rodin de Philadelphie: mais celui de Paris en possede de semblablesY Victor Frish and Joseph Shipley, Auguste Rodin, a Biography, New York, 1939, pp. 17-18: "When the art collector Mastbaum called me to Philadelphia several years ago, on giving that city its Rodin Mu- seum, to have me help separate the frauds from the genuine works in his large Rodin collection, I was touched with quick memories at seeing one especial object. It was a sketch-book of Rodin's earliest days, which Auguste Cheffer had shown me about thirty years before, and which-laughing aside Rodin's offer of a statue in exchange - Cheffer declared only death would take from him. To me it was the most interesting piece in the great Mastbaum collection: not merely because, drawn when Rodin was about twelve, the sketches show a keen faculty of observa- tion of form and movement blent with a naivety of spirit, the first impulses of the child becoming man; but also because of the memories the book evokes of the family life and devoted friends of the lonely sculptor"' 2. The Mastbaum Album was not shown in New York at the Rodin exhibition organized in 1963 by the Museum of Modern Art (April 30 to September 8, I963). It was displayed in the San Francisco show- ing of the same exhibition (no. I 8 of the catalogue). Around I920, Judith Cladel acquired the album from the Cheffer family and sold it later to Mast- baum (communication of J. K. van West, member of the Cheffer family, February, 1967). 3. The existence of albums similar to the Mastbaum Album in the Musee Rodin in Paris could not be ascertained. The only sketchbooks by Rodin to have been studied are those kept in the Print Department of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. There are at least twelve but these have been dismembered. They do not date prior to 1875. For a succinct description, see E. Chase Geissbuhler, "Rodin's Abstractions: The Architectural Drawings;' Art Journal, Fall, I966, xxvi/i, pp. 22-29. Rodin departed for Bel- gium in 1871 when he was forty-one. His sculpted work before 1871 amounts today to no more than a dozen busts, a small group, and a monumental com- mission hitherto neglected by his historians, the decoration of the facade of the Theatre des Gobelins in Paris. Rodin's early drawings have never been studied. They are a part of the approximately 7,000 drawings kept at the Musee Rodin but inaccessible to the public and to Rodin students. A dozen, at the most, are occasionally included in temporary exhi- bitions. All drawings by Rodin kept in the Musee Rodin are stamped M.R. and bear a number. This number was inscribed by Leonce Benedite and his collaborators after Rodin's death (J. Cladel, op. cit., pp. 355, 378). It is an inventory number and de- notes as well a broad chronological classification. No comprehensive treatment of Rodin's drawings has yet been attempted. For the first comprehensive treatment of Rodin's drawings, see A. Elsen, J. Kirk, T Varnedoe, The Drawings of Rodin, with addi- tional contributions by V Thorson and E. Chase Geissbuhler, New York, 1971. Ruth Mirolli, in her dissertation, The Early Work of Rodin and its Background, University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1966, discusses a few drawings from the Mastbaum Album on the basis of photographs, pp. 87-90. Only thirteen drawings are assumed to refer [159] NOTES</page><page sequence="6">to Rodin's earliest years: "Treize academies execu- tees entre I854 et 1857; proviennent de l'cole de Dessin et de Mathematiques . .

See P Schommer, "Les Dessins de Carpeaux,' Medecine de France, no. 72, I956, pp. 17-27. 6. The arrangement of a male figure lifting a female became a recurrent one in Rodin's art. See Roger Marx, Rodin Ceramiste, Societe de Propagation des Livres d'Art, Paris, I907, and, for instance, Rodin's group Je suis belle. ... It was also consistently used by Carrier-Belleuse. 7.

The model program was the south facade of the Galerie du Bord de l'Eau in the Louvre (completed between 1849 and 1853) and the subsequent re- modeling of the Louvre. 11. In 1854 the young Carpeaux was commissioned to execute one of these groups, Le Genie de la Marine. The vogue of such groups affected French decora- tive sculpture until quite late in the century: Rodin's employer, Carrier-Belleuse, used them frequently (See A. Carrier-Belleuse, Application de la figure humaine a la decoration et c l'art industriel, Paris, 1884, I, pls. i, 14, 59; II, pl. I86). 12.

See Carpeaux's Paul et Virginie, drawing dedicated in 862 (E. Chesneau, La Vie et l'Oeuvre de J. B. Carpeaux, Paris, 1880, p. 87), or Carpeaux's group Daphnis et Chloe, marble, private collection, Paris, dated 1874 (Chesneau, op. cit., p. 137). 14.

Rodin's education at the Petite Ecole and in other training centers in Paris af- ter 1854-and his relationship to Carpeaux-have never been clarified and are reported with contra- dictions. (Most recently: "Les premiers essais de modelage datent de 1857 corriges par Carpeaux ... ' Rodin Inconnu, Musee du Louvre, December, 1962- January, I963, p. 12). A. Elsen, op. cit., p. 205, dates Rodin and Carpeaux's encounter 862-63. (L. Clement-Carpeaux, La Verite sur l'ceuvre et la vie de J. B. Carpeaux, Paris, 1934, I, pp. 24-30, is vague on Carpeaux's appointment at the Petite Ecole which she dates 1850 to 1852. The Almanach Im- perial, gives the following information on Carpeaux's position and dates: together with Rouillard he was Repetiteur for the years I85I to 1854. Therefore, the young Rodin can only have been exposed to Carpeaux's teachings in 1854.) In references to the album the following dates have been suggested. A. Elsen, Rodin's Gates of Hell, Minneapolis, 1960, p. 147, n. 19, dates it in the i85o's or early i86o's. In his Rodin, he says it is probably from the late 185o's. In his article "Rodin's La Ronde' Burlington Maga- zine, cvii, 1965, p. 293, n. 7, he dates it to the period of the Petite Ecole, 1854-57. The impor- tance of the Petite Ecole in the training of nine- teenth-century artists has been repeatedly and justly emphasized. There is, however, a total lack of infor- mation on the detail of the courses offered and on the duties of the teachers. A pamphlet published in 1853 which lists the prize winners for that academic year describes the curriculum and the faculty as follows: Dessin de la Figure d'apres l'Antique Dessin de l'Ornement d'apres l'Antique Dessin d'apres la Plante Vivante Dessin de Memoire Composition d'Ornement Albums des Dessins de Composition d'Ornement Dessin copie - Figure Dessin copie-Animaux Dessin copie- Fleurs Dessin copie des Ornements MATHEMATIQUES Arithmetique Redaction du cours d'arithmetique Geometrie Redaction du cours de Geometrie Dessin Graphique Planches de Geometrie Architecture [160] NOTES</page><page sequence="7">Dessin Architectural Charpente Coupe des Pierres Planches d'Architecture Geometrie Descriptive SCULPTURE Modele de la figure d'apres l'Antique (Premiere Division) Modele de l'ornement d'apres l'Antique (Premiere Division) Modele de la figure d'aprs l'Antique (Deuxieme Division) Modele de l'ornement d'apres l'Antique (Deuxieme Division) Composition-Esquisse Modele d'apres la plante vivante DIRECTEUR, M.

Reviews Dessins des Musees de Marseille Exhibition catalogue by Marielle Latour, with introduc- tions by Jean Goudareau and Roseline Bacou, 197I. (Musee Cantini, Marseilles). I64 entries, without pagi- nation, partially illustrated. Ten years ago Marielle Latour, Conservateur of the Museums of Marseilles, began the arduous task of studying and cataloguing the approximately 1,300 drawings which had by one means or another become a part of the collections of the museums of the city. Little was known of the character and quality of these works. Roseline Bacou of the Louvre had suggested that it might be worthwhile to prepare a summary catalogue of the drawings of the type previously is- sued for several of the French provincial museums. At the time such an enterprise must have seemed good museum housekeeping.
