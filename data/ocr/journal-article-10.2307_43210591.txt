<plain_text><page sequence="1">A RECENT STUDY IN LATVIAN MYTHOLOGY A Review Article Vaira Vtķis- Freibergs, Université de Montréal Stephen Reynolds, University of Oregon Dr. Haralds Biezais, now of Âbo University, has recently published another work on the Latvian mythical dainas . 1 Dr. Biezais is recognized as a leading authority on the old Latvian religion, on the basis of a number of articles and, especially, of two earlier monographs, one on the "chief goddesses" (Māra, Laima, Dēkla and Kārta)2 and the other on Dievs, the ancient sky-deity.3 Much of the literature on this topic is, of course, in Latvian; Dr. Biezais* works, being mostly in German, are more widely accessible, and he is probably the most influential living investigator of Latvian mythology and religion. Biezais' third and largest book in this area deals with what he calls the "heavenly family of gods." It is intended to complete a systematic investigation of the central problems of Latvian, and in general, of Baltic religion. Following his established procedure, Biezais deals with mythical figures singly, discussing in each case the etymology of the name, its use as a common noun, the attributes and activities ascribed to the figure, and the evidence (if any) for a cult. The first part of the book examines in this way the figures of Auseklis, Mēness, and Pērkons.4 The second provides a similar treatment for Saule, but also covers the Latvian mythical cosmology, the sun-tree, and Jānis and the midsummer festival. The third, entitled "Gemeinsames Leben der Himmelsgötter," deals with the Dieva dēli and the Saules meita(s), and with the motifs of the heavenly wedding, of enmity or contention among the deities, and of the heavenly bathhouse. The table of contents, requiring eleven pages, outlines the structure of the entire volume with admirable clarity. The bibliography lists 661 items on a wide range of related topics. In the foreword, Biezais remarks that the attentive reader will find in his work numerous traces of the influence of the Swedish tradition of research in the history of religions, particularly that of the school of Uppsala (which he left 226 JBS, Vol 5, No. 3(1974)</page><page sequence="2">A Recent Study in Latvian Mythology 227 tor Abo only recently). This school is characterized by a preference for the particular and specific; it distrusts generalizations and is wary of premature syntheses. Among the "traces," one might name Biezais* caution in staying close to concrete data. He restricts his sources largely to the dainas (of which 511 are quoted with a translation) and avoids folktales and the like.5 He does occasionally employ riddles, and, of course, he relies on non-Latvian writers of earlier centuries for information about the cult. His reserve about comparative materials is also characteristic of the Uppsala school; he introduces them, if at all, only at the end of a chapter, following a thorough investigation of the evidence of the dainas , and with numerous warnings about the limits of their value. Biezais constantly emphasizes that the mythical dainas must be interpreted in the light of the social and cultural context in which they arose. The mythical figures mirror the life of Latvian peasants in their family relations, possessions, and agricultural and social activities. The dcziVuz-makers have projected that life, in a glorified form, into the divine realm: Dievs is a heavenly peasant, Saule a heavenly housewife, and so on. This emphasis is reminiscent of Durkheim; Biezais does not refer to him, but he does mention with approval this same (Durkheimian) element in the "French sociological school" of Dumézil and his followers (the "new comparative mythology"), while expressing reservations about their comparativism (p. 178). At times, Biezais seems to regard this projection of social forms as an end in itself (see pp. 121 ff). Prominent in Biezais' procedure is the issue of periodization and historical development. He attempts to use the social background implied in specific dainas for relative dating, referring favorably in this connection to Tylor's idea of "survivals" (p. 82). His major technique, however, is the detection of supposed syncretistic elements. He distinguishes three periods: the pre-Christian period; the period of syncretism, in which Christian elements were mixed with indigenous ones; and the most recent period, in which the pre-Christian elements vanish, leaving traces in a "demythologized" context (pp. 464 ff). Thus, Biezais' interpretation depends on three main factors: the "sub- stratum" of natural phenomena and processes; the sociocultural context of Latvian peasant life; and the influence of Christianity, which first alters the old mythical conceptions and then causes them to die out. His intention is to take more seriously than his predecessors the sociocultural and historical context of the mythical dainas , avoiding the narrowness and unrestrained comparativism of the nature-myth school. The resulting book is impressive in the breadth of both primary and secondary literature employed; it contains much of value; and the publishers are to be congratulated on the quality of printing and production.7 It must be acknowledged, however, that the organization of the work is not as well planned as the orderly table of contents would seem to imply. The book would have benefited greatly from the red pencil of a responsible and enterprising editor. To read the long text from cover to cover requires heroic</page><page sequence="3">228 Journal of Baltic Studies endurance even from the specialist, to say nothing of the average reader. Entirely too much space is taken up by repetitions, by self-evident restatements of the contents of the dainas quoted (when the space could have been better used by providing more primary texts), and by exceedingly detailed discussions of minutiae, often at the expense of more significant points. The level of discussion is rather uneven- some sections are carefully worked through, while others seem hurried. The title of the book already raises certain problems. Whether or not "dievs" was used (as Biezais argued elsewhere) in a generic sense, there is nothing in Latvian tradition like the Vedic deva ! asura distinction and consequently the reader may wonder just what the definition of the genus is. The "family" of gods is problematic. Family relationships are ascribed to the mythical figures, but they cannot be shown to form a single "family." There is nothing like the elaborate genealogies that can be traced, for example, in Greek mythology, of which it has recently been claimed that "all of the Greek deities and most of their semidivine heroes can be mythologically, and logically, tied in as members of a single family tree."8 In the dainas it is hard to find more than partial nuclear families- no uncles, cousins, or great-granddaughters. But Biezais introduces the notion of the himmlische Götterfamilie as if it were self-evident. There is also a Göttersippe , which is apparently wider, but includes the himmlische Familie (see p. 324 n. 2). The "family" is first mentioned in connection with a daina quoted on p. 32: Sudrabipa gailis dzied Zeltupîtes maliņā, Lai ceļas Saules meita Zfda diegu šķeterēt. (34007) A silver1" rooster crows on the bank1" of a golden stream, Ť so that Sun's daughter will get up to twine the silken yarn. (Ť indicates diminutive) Agreeing with L. Adamovifcs that the rooster represents Auseklis, Biezais maintains that this and similar songs define Auseklis in an unexpected way. "Er ist der Wecker. Er gehört zur Himmelsfamilie und als solcher weckt er auch die anderen zur Himmelsfamilie gehörenden Götter, d.i. die Saule , . . . die Saules meitas , . . . und die Dieva dēli " (p. 33). If the silver rooster belongs to the family of gods because it wakens Saules Meita (whose own divine status has not yet been established), then, by the same logic, any farm rooster should be a member</page><page sequence="4">A Recent Study in Latvian Mythology 229 of the family and would be reckoned a human being because he awakens the "other" human beings. Further problems arise with the inference that Auseklis as a rooster awakens, among others, the Dieva dēli (Sons of God). Auseklis is undoubtedly the morning star but, as Biezais points out later on (p. 492), the morning and evening stars are also the "natural substratum" for the Dieva dēli. A theriomorphic personification of the morning star thus awakens an anthropomorphic personification of the morning star. The stated criterion for including Mēness in the family and giving him divine status is different, but equally unsatisfactory: "Mēness hat im religiösen Leben der Letten seinen gesicherten Platz. Das zeigen besonders diejenigen Situationen des Menschenlebens, in die er mit seiner göttlichen Kraft eingreift" (pp. 74 ff). This is illustrated by quoting texts that stress the moon's function as the nocturnal source of light, for example: Teci gaiši, mēnestiņ(i), Gar bāliņa glāžu logu; Sfva marša, bargs bālinis, Neļauj skalu dedzināt. Run brightly, moon,1" along brother's1" glass window; sharp the brother's wife, harsh the brother, Ť they won't allow burning splinters (for lighting). How such songs are supposed to demonstrate the moon's divine power or religious function is hard to see. Clearly, here is a personification of a heavenly luminary, but nothing more is asked of the moon than to fulfill its natural function as a source of light. Invocation in itself, or address in the vocative case, are no criteria of divinity. One need only recall the countless examples of such dainas as: Velc, pelīte, saldu miegu Mazajarn(i) bērniņam. Little mouse, bring sweet sleep to the little Ť child. Ť The mere invocation of the little mouse here does not mean that mice were worshiped by the ancient Latvians. But the function requested, to bring sleep, is closer to a supernatural or divine function than is the natural shining of the moon. If so far it has occurred to no one (thank God!) to reckon the little</page><page sequence="5">230 Journal of Baltic Studies mouse as a theriomorphic ancient Latvian sleep-deity, one must conclude that some other criterion of divine status is needed. In these and other cases, Biezais' conclusions can hardly be based on the evidence he adduces, which simply does not prove the point.9 The songs about Mēness also show, according to Biezais, how historical periods can be differentiated. He finds evidence in some dainas for a hitherto neglected aspect of Mēness, his appearance as a warrior and as the protector of warriors. Biezais identified him as "the ancient Latvian war-god." These songs he dates before the Teutonic conquest of the thirteenth century. Other dainas give Mēness the epithet "warrior," but in a context that has apparently nothing to do with war. Since Mēness "in den Texten niemals [!] in der Rolle des Viehzüchters oder Landwirts ... in Erscheinung tritt" (p. 87), Biezais adduces (pp. 84-85) several dainas that, he believes, can be explained only by the reduction of the former Latvian warriors to serfdom after the conquest: Mēnesitis, kaça viris, Tecēj' dienu, tecēj' nakti: Dienu tek tīrus laukus, Nakti rijas kuldināt. (33850) Mēnestiņš kulti gāja Ar sidraba sprigulfti; Saules meita lfdzi gāja Zvaigžņotiem vaiņagiem. (55019) Mēness,1" the warrior, runs by day, runs by night: by day he runs over cleared fields, by night, to thresh in the drying-house. Mēness1" went a-threshing with a silver flail1" ; Saules meita went along with starry wreaths. "Der lettische Mann bzw. Krieger wurde zum Drescher des Gutbesitzers. Somit hatte der lettische Krieger seine soziale Position eingebiisst. Doch hatte er hierbei nicht seine alten religiösen Vorstellungen verloren. Den Krieger, jetzt Knecht in</page><page sequence="6">A Recent Study in Latvian Mythology 231 der Korndarre, begleitete dahin sein früherer Kriegsgott Mēness" (p. 85). Since 55019 does not refer to Mēness as a warrior, it only proves that Biezais is wrong in claiming that Mēness never does farm work. As for 33850, in the first place, it does not state or imply that the threshing in question is serf labor. Free peasants also thresh. Quoting other, nonmythical dainas that are songs of social protest against serfdom (p. 85 n. 2) proves nothing about Mēness. The comparison in 33850 is about day and night, not about a former age and the present (unless a very subtle disguised meaning is what Biezais has in mind); no tone of protest is evident. Even so, a case might be made if it were known that the free Latvian warriors of old were a class exempt from farm work, perhaps the special devotees of Mēness, so that the very fact of a kafa vīrs threshing would imply serfdom. However, in the following chapter (pp. 178-79), Biezais formally denies that any such military aristocracy was known. So the proposed periodization lacks sufficient evidence. Unfortunately, the same must be said of Biezais' use of "syncretism" as a criterion of age. What is strange here is that Scandinavian historians of religion have in the past decade been much concerned with syncretism, and have sometimes expressed their wonted predilection for clarity and particularity. Yet Ringgren's complaint that the word "is often used without a clear and unambiguous definition," is all too well illustrated by the present book.10 Biezais must be aware of what his colleagues at Uppsala and Âbo have written on the topic. He refers to the recent studies of syncretism among colonial peoples (p. 378), unfortunately without giving references and without explaining at all the significance of these studies for his own work. Failing to find a definition of "syncretism" anywhere, the reader is forced to try to reconstruct one from the examples scattered through the whole long volume. It seems, in fact, that Biezais uses the word with at least two meanings. First, it denotes the intrusion of elements from one religious tradition into another, or the synthesis of elements from two or more such traditions into a single Gestalt. Also, it appears to refer to a dynamic explanatory principle. In the first meaning, syncretism would be found in the dainas where elements of Christian belief are clearly evident. It would be interesting and valuable to collect these dainas , and to evaluate them from the perspective of Christianity. As a theologian, Biezais would be well qualified for this task. Unfortunately, he has not undertaken such a systematic analysis. And nowhere can the reader find a clear statement of what significant Christian elements have been accepted into the spiritual world of the Latvians, and are found in the dainas. Where Biezais refers to syncretism as if it were self-evident, the texts he cites as examples can be interpreted quite otherwise. Take, for instance, his interpretation of the following song: Gauži raud Saulīte Ābeļu dārzā.</page><page sequence="7">232 Journal of Baltie Studies Ābelei nokrita Zelt' ābolTtis. Neraudi, Saulīte, Dievs dara citu No zelta, no vara. No sudrabipa. (33781, p. 269) Bitterly Sau le Ť weeps in the apple orchard: from the apple tree fell the golden apple + Don't weep, Saule, Ť Dievs will make another, from gold, from copper, from silver. Ť "Wer ist dieser Gott, der einen neuen Apfel schafft? Ist das der vorchristliche Himmelsgott der Letten oder der christliche Gott? Es kann nur eine Antwort geben: er ist der Christengott, der Schöpfer" (p. 270). Clearly, Biezais assumes as self-evident that creating is the unique privilege of the Christian God. This assumption would be understandable in the context of Christian theology, but it is quite out of place in a study in the history of religions, being inconsistent with the many and various Creators and Demiurges found among the beliefs of the peoples of the entire world, many of which appear in documents antedating the rise of Christianity. There is no basis for regarding the text quoted as an example of syncretism, and this is true of a whole series of other examples mentioned in the book. In its second meaning, "syncretism" serves as a dynamic explanatory principle. An example is found in the interpretation of a variant of the song just cited (p. 258). Biezais has just explained the apple referred to in certain songs as the sun itself. Here, however, Saule and the apple appear as two distinct conceptions. To avert the contradiction, Biezais invokes the supposition that the song originated at a late date, when the influence of syncretism had confused the old mythical conceptions and the identity of sun and apple had been forgotten. No doubt, by the time the dainas were transcribed, the passage of time and the influence of the church had caused much to be lost of the ancient Latvian religious concepts. Such historical arguments are, however, methodologically</page><page sequence="8">A Recent Study in Latvian Mythology 233 questionable, since only in exceptional cases do the contents of the dainas provide evidence about their relative age. In the cited example, it could equally well be argued that Saule and the apple were originally distinct symbols, and were united only later, or by mistake. There is simply no objective evidence for the greater age of one or the other conception. For the notion of syncretism to be of assistance with problems of this sort, it would first be necessary to provide it with a more rigorous factual basis. The notions of historical development and of syncretism are extensively used in Part Two, about Saule. Biezais regards Saule as one of the most important old Latvian deities, although there is no direct evidence for a real cult of Saule, except the fact that the most important Latvian festival, Jāņi, is celebrated at the summer solstice. Difficulties arise from the fact that Saule herself is not prominent in this festival, whereas a large number of songs refer to Jānis. Biezais proposes a hypothetical reconstruction of the history of the festival as follows: Since the time of the ancient sun festival coincides with the feast of St. John the Baptist, Jānis is a mythological figure who has evolved under the influence of syncretism. He represents the fusion (Verschmeltzung, cf. p. 378) of Saule and of John the Baptist. From the former he derives his attributes and functions (p. 367), from the latter, his name and his male sex (he also shares a few of his attributes with Dievs). The role played by Christianity in this transformation remains obscure, since Biezais himself acknowledges that Jānis and his festival exhibit no significant links with the Baptist or with Christianity (pp. 378, 379 n. 1, 381). The only link that Biezais has established between the festival, Jāni, and Christianity is the etymological derivation of "Jānis" from "Johann." Yet he rejects out of hand any attempt to connect the name "Jānis" etymologically with either "Janus" or "Devayana" (pp. 312 n.3, 384), without telling the reader why the Biblical derivation is right, and the others wrong.11 More obscure still is the origin of those characteristics of Jānis that can in no way be derived from the above-mentioned fusion. Whence, between the feminine Saule and the apocalyptic ascetic of the Jordan, did Jānis derive his attributes as a phallic fertility figure, so closely associated with plants and grasses that they would almost appear to be his "natural substratum"? At this point, Biezais might have paid more attention to comparative materials, especially to the Jānis-like figures of Ivan Kupala and of Lada ("Lepo Lado") of the eastern and southern Slavs respectively, whose existence makes a late and "syncretistic" origin for Jānis- whatever the source of his name- difficult to accept. Once the syncretic Jānis had replaced Saule, "the general tendency of Latvian religion to create families of gods" (p. 380) required that he be provided with a wife, the better to fit the Christian saint into the Latvian family of deities (p. 381). This explains the origin of "Jānis' bride" (Jāņa sieva) who appears in the midsummer dainas. According to Biezais, however, this female figure is clearly</page><page sequence="9">234 Journal of Baltic Studies and convincingly none other than Saule herself (p. 374), both having common functions. The argument from functions fulfilled in common by Saule and either Jānis or his wife (or by Dievs and by Jānis) to a genetic relationship is rather dangerous: in the dainas , as in folktales, various figures can fulfill one and the same function.12 Beizais is aware of the difficulties encountered in this case. "Wenn nun tatsächlich einerseits Jānis und Saule und andererseits die Johannisfrau und Saule identisch sind, . . . dann scheint . . . die Heirat dieser beiden Wesen . . . unmöglich . . ." (p. 376). 13 But instead of really overcoming the difficulty created by these hypothetical historical derivations that result in Saule getting married to herself, Biezais explains it away by invoking "syncretism" and its inherent contradictions (p. 367) as well as "psychological motivations" (p. 377), without specifying what these might be. All in all, it must be said that Biezais relies far too much on an undefined "syncretism" to explain away difficulties, inconsistencies, and contradictions. A similar judgment must be made about his use of "poetic fantasy" and "psychological necessity" as explanatory categories. It is surprising to find references to the "irrational world of myth and poetry" (p. 264)- are such expressions "survivals" of the obsolete notion of "prelogical mentality"? It is to Biezais' credit that he recognizes the importance of both natural substratum and sociocultural context in the mythical dainas , but he never states clearly the relation between them. Sometimes he appears to regard them as alternative modes of interpretation (for example, pp. 290 ff); elsewhere, they are "untrennbar . . . verbunden" (p. 464). Biezais often insists on the futility of seeking a consistent nature-myth interpretation, and sometimes asserts the primacy of the social factor (p. 475), but in the case of the Dieva dēli and Saules meita(s), where the proposed nature-myth interpretations have been embar- rassingly diverse and feeble, he rejects the attempts of Bergmann and Švābe to interpret them as deified social types (pp. 436-37). In spite of his criticism of the nature-mythologists, he acknowledges that a natural substratum must be present and, after 75 pages of discussion, concludes by essentially agreeing with Mannhardt about what the substratum is (pp. 417, 492-93). 14 He often insists on the independence of the personified "god" from the natural substratum, but at least once states that the connection is closer than is usually thought (pp. 408-09). Several times he insists that statements in the dainas , mythical and nonmythical, contradict what is to be observed in nature; when, in fact, there appears fro be no real contradiction (pp. 219, 290 ff). The only extended methodological discussion (pp. 215-17) is too brief and rather obscurely worded. The reader is dizzied by the profusion of statements on the natural and social factors, and by the lack of any visible unifying principles. Historians of religion would generally agree that neither the nature- mythologists nor Durkheim and his followers were able to grasp the authentic character of religion, or of the religious dimension of myth. Since Biezais has not presented a structure in which the natural and social factors can be related at a</page><page sequence="10">A Recent Study in Latvian Mythology , 235 higher level of meaning, he has little assistance to offer the reader who wants to understand the religious consciousness of the ancient Latvians, although Biezais himself is aware of the religous value of the dainas. A historian of religion should not limit himself to such literalistic discussions as that about whether Saule is a maiden or a wife (in songs in which the question is of no importance), or the lengthy inventory of all her possessions. Can we not get beyond the alternatives of reading the mythical dainas either as fanciful descriptions of natural phenomena, or as exaltations of social types? One must conclude that Biezais has not yet found a method quite adequate for dealing with the dainas. But that will not prevent the reader from benefiting from Biezais' wide erudition, or from feeling due gratitude for this most extensive treatment of the mythical dainas , in which much valuable material is collected and discussed, new discoveries are made, and a number of helpful and perceptive insights are presented. Those unable to handle Latvian now have an introduction to many aspects of the dainas ; and even those who know them best will surely have much to learn from these pages.

Kr. 98:00. 2 Haralds Biezais, Die Hauptgöttinen der alten Letten (Uppsala: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, 1955). 3 Haralds Biezais, Die Gottesgestalt der lettischen Volksreligion, Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis, Historia Religionům, Vol. 1 (Uppsala: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, 1961). 4 For the reader unacquainted with Latvian mythology: Dievs is the ancient sky-deity (the word originally meant 'sky' or 'heaven,' for which debess is used in modern Latvian) ; the same name is applied to the biblical God. Auseklis is the morning star (by extension sometimes the evening star also), Mēness the moon, Pērkons thunder, and Saule the sun, all of these words serving both as common nouns and as the names of personified mythical beings. The Dieva dēli and the Saules meita are further mythical beings, the sons of Dievs and the daughter of Saule. A complication lies in the linguistic fact that 'Saules meita' may be either a possessive genitive (the daughter of Saule) or an appellative genitive (Saule herself as a maiden); the context may or may not indicate which interpretation is correct. This applies to similar constructions with dēls 'son,' meita 'daughter,' tēvs 'father,' or māte 'mother.' 5 The dainas are folksongs, mostly short and lyrical, of which over 77,500 basic texts, with over 700,000 variants, have been collected. A cumulative enumeration is used to identify basic texts and variants. 6 Wilhelm Mannhardt, "Die lettische Sonnenmythen," Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, 1 (1875), pp. 73-104, 211-44, 281-330. Mannhardt was not, as Biezais implies, a representative of the nature-myth school. He occupied a position intermediate between them and their rivals, the British ethnological school. Frazer's books are to a large extent popularizations of Mannhardt's work. If Mannhardt chose to emphasize the nature-myth aspect of the dainas , it is because the dainas themselves require it to a greater extent than Biezais seems prepared to admit. Of course, that is not to say that Mannhardt's interpretations are always correct; but it is striking how often Biezais' conclusions are anticipated by them.</page><page sequence="11">236 Journal of Baltic Studies 7 The only major technical error is the transposition of the translations of two songs on pp. 116-17.

Barthell, Jr., Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Greece (Coral Gables: University of Miami Press, 1971), p. 3. 9 A similar non sequitur occurs on p. 189, where a song in which "Saule sows silver" is quoted as an example of Saule as engaged in typical woman's work around the house and in the fields. Sowing, as it happens, was typically man's work among the Latvians. Another example is on p. 196: Biezais quotes a daina to illustrate how the white personified Sun is to be taken in a symbolic, ethical sense. But the song clearly refers to weather conditions, not moral states; it represents a magical formula intended to bring on sunshine: "Shine, Sun, shine, shine! Throw off your black shirt, put on a white one! (34028). 10 Helmer Ringgren, "The Problem of Syncretism," in Syncretism: Based on Papers read at the Symposium on Cultural Contact, Meeting of religions, (and) Syncretism held at Âbo on the 8th-9th of September, 1 966, ed.
