<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeological Reports from the Tabqa Dam Project-Euphrates Valley, Syria, ed. by David Noel Freedman, with the assistance of John M. Lundquist. Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research 44. Cambridge, MA: American Schools of Oriental Research, 1979. Pp. vii + 182; $20.00. This latest Annual of the ASOR had its inspiration in the junior editor's field experience in 1974 on one of the salvage excavations of an international team, racing against time to save Syrian archaeological sites soon to be inundated by the comple- tion of the Russian dam at Tabqa (modern Al-Thaoura), on the Upper Euphrates. We share the editors' excitement about the Tabqa Dam Project, which, despite its extraordinary impor- tance and it continuation from 1963 through 1976, is still only sketchily reported in scattered journals and thus is not fully appreciated. In the summer of 1976 the reviewer was able to visit some of these sites, along with Ebla, and also saw the superb special exhibition of the material in the Aleppo Muse- um. Now, browsing through this feast of published reports on eight of the sites, one only can agree with the editors' statement that "the idea that ancient Syria was a cultural backwater of Mesopotamian civilization has been out of date for a long time and can now be laid to rest permanently" (p. viii). Not all the Tabqa Dam sites are represented, although most of the Directors were invited to participate. Thus the following sites are not included: Abu Hureira, Dibsi Faraj, Jabar, Jebel Aruda, Mumbaqat, Taas, Tell Abu Danneh, Tell Fray, Tell el-Hajj, Tell Sheikh Hassan, Tell Sueihat, Tell Roumeila, and Shams ed-din-Tannira. Some of the papers retrace ground covered elsewhere in preliminary reports in French and Ger- man (mostly in journals and occasional papers that are relatively inaccessible). Nevertheless, this collection provides a remark- able overview-the first of its kind-both of the Tabqa Dam Project and of the Bronze Age (in particular) of Upper Syria. Valuable background on the project, including the sponsor- ship of UNESCO and aspects of scientific cooperation, is pro- vided by the essay of Adnan Bouni, Director of the Service of Archaeological Excavations in Damascus. Then there follow chapters on specific sites, whose wealth of new information we can barely sketch here. First is the section on prehistory. J. J. Roodenberg of the University of Groningen reports on an epipaleolithic industry at the rather isolated, semi-arid site of Nahr el-Homr, with strong affinities to the Kebaran of a number of Lebanese and Palestin- ian sites and also to Yabrud. J. Cauvin of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris summarizes (in French) the 1971-74 seasons at the important site of Mureybet and their significance for the origins of sedentary villages of the Mesolithic-Neolithic, until recently poorly known on the Middle Euphrates. The site was first occupied in the Natufian (Phase I; 9th millennium B.c.), al- though dwellings were not yet attested. Phase II exhibits round houses, and Phase III sees them develop into multi- roomed dwellings with wall paintings. Perhaps more significant, Phase III, dated ca. 8,000-7,600 B.c. by RC 14 determinations, produced crude terra cotta anthropomorphic figurines and con- tainers (the latter Cauvin considers the earliest "true pottery" in the Middle East), as well as a transition to a flint industry based on larger tools. Phase IV followed immediately, down to the site's end at the beginning of the 7th millennium. In Cauvin's view, based on careful excavation and exhaustive paleo- ethnobotanical analysis, Mureybet began as a "proto-agricultural," fully sedentary village, based not on a full domestication of plants but rather on novel means of exploiting the natural environ- ment and aided by an amelioration of climate beginning around 8,000 B.C. (Phase III). This is a serious challenge to the position of other ecologically oriented anthropologists, such as Binford and Flannery, as well as to the various demographic theories now in vogue. Cauvin's other bold thrust relates the progress of technology to ideological changes, seen for instance in the remarkable figurines and plastered skulls. An appendix gives 27 invaluable RC 14 dates, placing Phases I-IV ca. 8,500-6,900 B.C. Adnan Bounni reports on three levels at Tell al-cAbd and cAnab al-Safinah. At Tell el-cAbd, Level I is Helenistic-Roman; Level II, ending in the early 2nd millennium B.c., with three phases, is roughly equivalent to Palestinian MB IIA. Level III remains, 3 m. deep, produced a RC 14 range ca. 2,450-2,150 B.c., corresponding very well to Palestinian EB IV-MB I. The pottery consists largely of simple globular jars and cups more directly comparable to those of Palestine than much of the previously known Syrian "caliciform." Several slab-built cham- ber tombs typical of the Upper Euphrates produced single skeletons, pottery similar to the above, and copper pins with rolled head or heads molded in bird and animal shapes. cAnab el-Safinah produced a western variety of Ubeid ware in great quantities, a monumental Roman-Byzantine tomb, and a most important Roman tumulus burial of a type apparently confined to this region of the Euphrates. Eva Strommenger, of the Museum of Vor-und Frithgeschichte in Berlin, reports (in German) on Habuba Kabira south, where an incredible Proto-Literate city (contemporary with Palestin- ian EB I, ca. 3,200 B.C.) is preserved right below the surface.</page><page sequence="2">1983 BOOK REVIEWS 95 The clearance of ca. 20,000 sq. m. (some 15 percent of the built-up area) included a 600 meter stretch of city wall, with more than 30 towers, and two domestic quarters with dozens of dwelling units built around well-planned streets. Even though the site would be considered part of the north Syrian hinter- land, the material culture is very Mesopotamian in character, with seal impressions, pottery, and other artifacts providing an especially clear link to Uruk and Susa. At the neighboring site of Tell Habuba Kabira, levels of the first half of the 2nd millen- nium B.C. were excavated, extending the range of occupation in the vicinity to about the end of the Middle Bronze Age. Andr6 Finet reports on the Belgian excavations at Tell Kannas, where a series of levels stretches from Islamic back through Roman then into Old Babylonian times and finally into "Proto-Literate" levels. Here, too, there is a stretch of mudbrick city wall with towers. Three particularly impressive early Uruk- style pillastered temples were found in the north, east, and south sectors of the city. The next two sites, Selenkahiye and Tell Hadidi, are of special importance for the late 3rd millennium B.c. M. van Loon, of the University of Amsterdam, summarizes five phases at Selenkahiye, with RC 14 dates, which I would date and compare as follows: Phase I, 2400-2300 B.c. (my EB IIIB/IVA); Phase II, 2300-2250 B.c. (EV IVA): Phase III, 2250-2150 B.c. (EB IVA-B); Phase IV 2150-2050 B.c (EB IVB-C = early "MB I"); Phase V, 2050-2000 B.c. (EB IVC = late "MB I"). The entire range of RC 14 dates extends from a median date of 2384 B.c. (MASCA calibrated) for Str. I, to 2125 B.c. for one Str. IV sample. Destructions are claimed at the end of Str. II and again at the end of Str. IV by van Loon, who says that "if Selenkahiye represents the elusive 'Amorite culture,' we see that it was an offshoot of Mesopotamian civilization, becoming nomadic only as a result of its own disintegration (p. 111)." Rudolph Dornemann, of the Milwaukee Public Museum, summarizes three seasons at Tell Hadidi, an upper and lower tell site which began in EB IV and continued through MB-LB. Hundreds of looted EB IV slab-built chamber tombs were found; and one undisturbed such tomb was dug in Area D, similar to the famous Til Barsib hypogeum, with much pottery of the 'Amiq J - Hama J horizon. The female stick-figurines of this horizon are, in my judgment, best compared to those of the late Sargonid and Ur III periods. Dornemann's date ("last quarter of the 3rd millennium") and terminology ("EB IV") suit this material admirably. There are also significant MB and LB levels at Tell Hadidi, although the lower tell shows a long gap after EB IV. The MB II city is well fortified; the LB levels produced a number of interesting Nuzi-style cuneiform tablets and seal impressions. Finally, Jean Margueron, of the University of Strasbourg, identifies his site of Meskene with ancient Emar and discusses a multi-roomed Late Bronze Age building in Area A that he interprets as a bit-hildni. On the basis of this he then discusses comparable buildings from Sam al, Sakjegozii, Tell Halaf, Tell Tayinat, Alalakh, Boghazkdy, and elsewhere, concluding that the Meskene example is the oldest such Syrian or "Syro-Hittite" building in the region. This Annual is surely one of the most innovative and useful in the entire ASOR series. It also reminds us of the other and much neglected "half" of the discipline of Syro-Palestinian archaeology, properly conceived. Along with Ebla (to which some of us were calling attention long before the tablets), this r6sumb should help to place ancient Syria on the archaeologi- cal map as a cultural entity in no way inferior to Mesopotamia, and absolutely indispensable for the proper understanding of ancient Palestine. (After this review was completed, there appeared another series of essays on the Euphrates sites, the papers of a congress at Strasbourg in March of 1977. See J. Cl. Marqueron, ed., Le moyen Euphrate, zone de contacts d'echanges. Travaux du Centre de Recherche sur le Proche-Orient et la Grbce Antiques 5. Strasbourg: Universite des Sciences Humaines de Stras- bourg [no date, but apparently published in 1981]. Most of these essays overlap with those of Annual 44, but some treat additional sites briefly. A few topical essays are also included, such as W. Orthmann's paper on burial customs of the late 3rd millennium, and Tom Holland's paper on the incised wares of Syria and Mesopotamia. A review of this volume will appear shortly in the Bulletin.)
