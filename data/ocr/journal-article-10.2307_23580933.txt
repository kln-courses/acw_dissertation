<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gregorianum 84, 2 (2003) 347-362 Christ and the Religions At an audience on 6 Aprii 2001 to commemorate the 450 years of the Gregorian University, Pope John Paul II emphasized the importance of interreligious dialogue in today's world. Through his own practice and teaching the Holy Father has provided a shining example for those engaged in such dialogue. The task is daunting ly large - not least for those attempting to grasp, interpret, and apply the magisterial teaching and theological writing on Christ and the religions. In this article I pian to limit myself to retrieving some impor tant pieces of teaching from the Second Vatican Council, to exam ining a recent book by Fr Jacques Dupuis, and to making one pro posai about a possible line of approach when thinking about our «God, who is also the God of the Gentiles» (Romans 3:29)'. L The dense opening chapter of Dei Verbum, Vatican II's Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation, uses «the economy of revelation» and «the history of salvation» in the singular. There 1 For eighteen years Fr Jacques Dupuis was the director of the Gregorianum. The present director and consultore of this quarterly wish to thank him most since rely for his dedicated work and many contributions, and, in particular, for exploring a delicate and difficult problematic which has engaged the pastors and the theolo gians of the Church in recent years: the theology of religions. He has been a valued pioneer in a field which continues to cali for meticulous thought and precise inter pretations. Along with its legitimate differences of opinion, theological reflection can mantain its fidelity to the salvific revelation God wills for ali of us in Jesus Christ.</page><page sequence="2">348 GERALD O'COLLINS is only one economy of revelation/salvation, even if we can and should distinguish between its different periods and modalities2. Moreover, the terms used here, «revelation» and «salvation», are more or less interchangeable. As far as the Council is con cerned, the history of salvation is the history of revelation and vice versa. The text shuttles back and forth between the two terms. Take this passage from article 2: The economy of revelation occurs through deeds and words, which are intrinsically bound up with each other. Thus the Works per formed by God in the history of salvation manifest and bear out the doctrine and realities signified by the words; the words, for their part, proclaim and illuminate the works and the mystery they contain. The most intimate truth, which this revelation provides not only about God but also about the salvation of the human person, shines forth in Christ, who is both the mediator and the fullness of ali reve lation (italics mine). Article 4 announces that it is «above ali through his death and resurrection from the dead and finally with the sending of the Spirit of Truth», that Jesus Christ «completes, perfects and con fìrms revelation with the divine testimony: namely, that God is with us to liberate us from the darkness ofsin and death and to raise us for eternai life» (italics mine). The revealing and saving activity of God belong inseparably together in constituting the one history of divine self-communication. Years later John Paul II, in his 1986 encyclical on the Holy Spirit (Dominum et Vivificantem), was to use the language of divine self-communication twelve times (nos. 13 [twice], 14,23,50 [fourtimes], 51 [twice], and 58 [twice]). But the themeofGod's per sonal «self-communication» in history, which comprises a self manifestation that is salvific, had already been expressed by Chapter 1 of Dei Verbum and, quite explicitly in article 6, which 2 Thus Vatican II's Decree on the Church's Missionary Activity spoke in the plu ra] of «the ways» by which God brings those, who «through no fault of their own do not know the gospel», to the «faith» (without which, as the Letter to the Hebrews teaches (11: 6), «it is impossible to please God»), and not, it should be remarked, to mere beliefs that result primarily from some human search and that, not being faith, would not «please God» (Ad Gentes, 7).</page><page sequence="3">CHRIST AND THE RELIGIONS 349 spoke of how «God wanted with the divine revelation to commu nicate himself». The mind set which appreciated the two distinguishable but inseparable dimensions of the divine self-communication, revelation and salvation, comes through other documents of Vatican II, espe cially through the «dyadic», double-sided terminology used about the religious situation of those who are not Christians. It is important to appreciate this persistent linking of the revelatory and salvifìc activity of God. Otherwise one might repeat the unacceptable view espoused decades ago by Cari Braaten, who recognized in Christ a universal role for salvation but not for revelation. For such a view Christ is the Saviour of ali but not the Revealer to ali3 - a view simply incompatible with the universal action of the Son, who «from the beginning reveals the Father to ali», highlighted by St Irenaeus (Adversus Haereses, 4.20. 6-7; italics mine) and endorsed by Vatican II [Ad Gentes, 3, n. 2). One cannot separate questione of salvation from those of revealed truth, as if - for instance - the world religione might be for their members means towards salvation but not towards knowing something of the self-revelation of God. But let us see in detail the «dyadic» terminolo gy ofVatican II which bears on this issue. In his first encyclical Pope Paul VI wrote of what is «true and acceptable» in the Moslem worship of God4. Within a few months similar language surfaced in Lumen Gentium. «The one mediator, Christ, established and ever sustains here on earth his holy Church [...] as a visible organization through which he communicates truth and grace to ali men» (art. 8; italics mine). Some paragraphs later the constitution applied a parallel dyad, not to what is com municated through the visible Church, but to what the Church finds among those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, and who, not without grace, strive to live an upright life. Whatever that is good and true which is to be found in them is considered by the Church to be a preparation for the gospel and given by Him who enlightens ali human beings that they may at length have life (art. 16). 1 Historyand Hermeneutics, Philadelphia, 1966, p. 15. 1 Ecclesiam Suam, AAS 56 (1964) pp. 609-59, at 654.</page><page sequence="4">350 GERALD O'COLLINS The Johannine language of revelation and salvation (in that order: «enlightens» and «life» [John 1: 4,9]) alternated with the recognition of elements of salvation and revelation (in that order: «whatever is good or true») to be found among upright non-believ ers. The documents from the last session of the Council included similar «doublé» terminology. Implying that other religions, even often, can exhibit elements of truth and holiness, Nostra Aetate declared: The Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these religions. She has a high regard for the manner of life and conduct, the precepts and doctrines which, although differing in many ways from what she herself believes and teaches, nevertheless not rarely reflect a ray ofthat Truth which enlightens ali human beings (art. 2). Once again echoing John's Gospel, the Council here com bined terms in the usuai order of revelation and salvation («true and holy»). Six weeks later it followed the same order, while being more criticai in the way it thought about other religions: «Missionarv activity (...) delivers from evil influences every ele ment of truth and grace which are already found among peoples through a hidden presence of God» (Ad Gentes, 9; italics mine).5 Despite «evil influences», a hidden presence of God has intro duced evervwhere elements of «truth and grace». In their different ways Nostra Aetate and Ad Gentes depend upon Lumen Gentium 16 and 17. Besides the terminology we have 5 It seems difficult to accept this teaching from Ad Gentes and even more what we have quoted from Nostra Aetate and, at the same time, deny that the religione are in some sense a means of salvation for their members. The same conclusion about some kind of positive role played by the religions for their adherents seems to foliow when Ad Gentes acknowledges «the seeds of the Word» to be found in «national and religious traditions» and «the riches which a generous God has distri buted among the nations» (no. 11). Moreover, by retrieving the early patristic theme of «seeds of the Word», the Council here points to the divine manifestation to human beings which comes through the action of the «Sowing Word» of God. Such teaching seems incompatible with any talk about Christ being Saviour of ali but not Revealer to ali.</page><page sequence="5">CHRIST AND THE RELIGIONS 351 already seen, these two paragraphs of the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church deploy a variety of terms to indicate the two distin guishable but inseparable dimensions of Gods' self-communication: the revelatory dimension («the gospel», the good «sown in the minds of human beings», and a «knowing» of God that leads to «faith»; ital ics mine); and the salvific dimension («salvation», «grace», and the good «sown in the hearts of human beings»; italics mine). To remark on this double-sided terminology may seem to bor der on the banal. However, this persistent usage in the conciliar documents has two lessons for us. We may not raise the question of salvation without raising that of revelation, and vice versa. When interpreting anyone's situation before God, we need to recali the two inseparable dimensions of the divine self-communication. Second, the conciliar terminology bears witness to the way in which Christ's mediatorship entails his being universal Revealer as well as universal Saviour. He cannot be accepted as Saviour of ali without being accepted as Revealer for ali. His revelatory and redemptive activity can (and should be) distinguished but never separated. How one interprete this activity in terms of those who have never been baptized and may never have even heard of Christ is another and difficult issue. But such interpretation should start from the fìrm principle that Christ is both the Light of the world and the Life of the world6. Christ accomplished his revealing and redeeming work for the whole world as priest, prophet and king, the triple office suc cessfully applied by Vatican II in its teaching about the Church {Lumen Gentium, 10-13, 25-27, 31-36), about the office of bishops (■Christus Dominus, 12-16), about the ministry and fife of priests (.Presbyterorum Ordinis, 1, 4-6), and about the apostolate of lay people {Apostolicam Actuositatem, 2-3). But I turn to another doc ®See my Fundamental Theology, new ed., Mahwah (NI), 1986, pp. 114-29. Early Christians left striking testimony to Christ as the Light and Life of the world by com bining on the tombs of their beloved dead the two Greek words: phós (light) and zóè (life). Phós ran down the inscription and intersected in the letter «omega» with zóè which ran across. The centrai position of «omega» reminds us that Christ, who the Light of the world and the Life of the world, is the end of ali things; see «Zaó», in G. Kittel (ed.), Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, voi. 2, Grand Rapids (Mich.), 1964, p. 841, n. 66.</page><page sequence="6">352 GERALD O'COLLINS ument, which contains a neglected passage about Christ's high priestly role which illuminates his saving work for ali human beings and the whole world. When introducing its chapter on the divine office, the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, without a footnote to indicate its sources, quotes the very words of Pius XII in its teaching: «Jesus Christ, the high priest of the new and eternai covenant, by assuming a human nature, has introduced into this earthly exile that hymn which is eternally sung in the heavenly realm. He joins to himself the whole community of human beings, and associates it with himself in singing this divine song of praise» (.Sacrosanctum Concilium, 83). Here the incarnation is understood to have joined to Christ «the whole community of human beings», or - to use the language of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin - to have «christified» the entire human race. This passage clearly sees that the incarnation has «supernaturalized» the whole community of human beings, who are ipso facto drawn into a chorus of divine praise led by the incarnate Son of God.7 In his 1947 encyclical letter on Christian worship, Pope Pius XII had described the divine office in exactly the same universal terms: «The Word of God, by assuming a human nature, intro duced into this earthly exile that hymn which is eternally sung in the heavenly realm. He joins to himself the whole community of human beings and associates it with himself in singing his divine song of praise» [Mediator Dei, 152). A very old tradition supported this image of a universal chorus of praise led by the incarnate Son of God. St Ignatius of Antioch invited Christians to «sing with one voice through Jesus Christ to the Father» (Ephesians, 4. 2). William ' Where Sacrosanctum Concilium (art. 83) develops its teaching on the salva tion of ali humanity in terms of Christ and his incarnation, Gaudium et Spes spoke in terms of «grace» (understood personally as the Holy Spirit) offered to ali and the possibility for ali to share in the mystery of Christ's resurrection from the dead: «in the hearts of ali people of good will grace operates invisibly. For since Christ died for ali and since the final vocation of ali human beings is in fact the same divine voca tion, we ought to hold that the Holy Spirit offers to ali the possibility, in a way known to God, of sharing in the paschal mystery» (no. 22). In his first encyclical John Paul II went beyond talk of a «possibility» to proclaim the mystery of Christ and his Redemption (what some commentators called a «Christic supernatural existen tial») in which every human has actually become «a sharer from the moment he is conceived beneath the heart of his mother» (Redemptor Hominis, 13).</page><page sequence="7">CHRIST AND THE RELIGIONS 353 Schoedel illustrates the rich background in Greek imagery and thought, which encouraged Ignatius and later Church Fathers to understand the incarnation as initiating a harmonious cosmic chorus headed by Christ.8 What is very much to the fore in the passage from Mediator Dei, which Vatican II quoted without acknowledgment (!), is the initiative of the Word of God towards the whole human race. The divine quest for ali human beings, rather than any human quest for God, is utterly primary in this vision of redemption and revela tion. Here it should be added that, for a properly trinitarian view, the ultimate initiative comes from the Father, as Dei Verbum repeatedly makes clear in its prologue and first chapter. Thus the Constitution on Divine Revelation shows itself fully in accord with the scriptures about the source of saving revelation.. When the NewTestament calls Christ «Saviour», as it does six teen times, it does so in a participatory sense: through his mission he shares in and executes the saving «work» of the Father, who is the Saviour in the ultimate sense, the One from whom, as the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed shows, the Son's eternai, divine existence and mission in history derives. Ultimately the whole cre ative and redemptive pian stems from and works itself out from the Father, through the «christifying» Son and the «spiritualizing» Holy Spirit, «the two hands of God» - in the expressive image of St Irenaeus (Adversus Haereses, 4.20.1). Hence in thinking about how saving revelation reaches ali peoples, we must begin with and con stantly emphasize God's personal initiatives in dealing with ali humankind throughout history, rather than allow our reflection to set out from, let alone be dominated by, the aspirations of human beings towards the Infinite. We should give full weight to St Paul's teaching about the divine initiative for the salvation of ali: «God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself» (2 Cor 5: 19). Likewise, after having established that ali human beings «have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God» (Rom 3: 23), the apos tle proclaims how God «proves his love» by sending his Son and creating the new order of the Holy Spirit (Rom 8:1-17) for the sai 8 W. R. Schoedel, Ignatius ofAntioch, Philadelphia, 1985, pp. 51-53.</page><page sequence="8">354 GERALD O'COLLINS vation ofthe entire createci world (Rom8:18-25). Perhaps the most impressive celebration of the pian for the salvation of ali humankind comes in the prayer which «blesses the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ», who has revealed his mysterious, loving pian to gather ali people and ali things together in Christ (Ephes 1: 3-11). To sum up. A complete treatment of Vatican II would retrieve much more for a theology of the religions. These pages limit them selves to three basic principles. First, there is only one economy of saving revelation which invites human faith. At the same times, this one economy leading to faith assumes a plurality of «ways» known to God [Ad Gentes, 7; see also Gaudium et Spes, 22).9 Second, revelation and salvation are two distinguishable but inseparable dimensions of the divine self-communication. Hence Christ is both universal Revealer and universal Saviour. Third, the initiative for the supernatural salvation of the whole of humanity comes from the Father. The «christifying» and «spiritualizing» of the world must always be understood in a trinitarian fashion. Any approach to Christ and the religions of the world which wishes to be properly in tune with the teaching of Vatican II must firmly embrace at least these three principles. II. The literature on Christianity and the world religions has become an enormous industry, especially after the fall of European Communism in 1989 marked the end of decades of debate and dia logue with Marxist ideologies of various kinds. Interreligious ques tione emerged with a fresh urgency. It was in this post-1989 context 9 Promulgateci in 1965, Ad Gentes followed on from Lumen Gentium, which was promulgateci in 1964 and had already spelled out the situation of non-Christians, including also those «who, without fault of their own, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God and who, not without grace, strive to lead an upright life». The Constitution on the Church adds: «Whatever is good or true to be found among them is considered by the Church to be a preparation for the gospel [preparatio evangelica] and given by Him who enlightens ali people that they may at length have life» (Lumen Gentium, 16).</page><page sequence="9">CHRIST AND THE RELIGIONS 355 that Jacques Dupuis' 447-page Toward a Christian Theology of Religious Pluralism appeared.10 Written originally in English, this book appeared almost simultaneously in French and Italian and sub sequentìy in Portuguese (1999) and Spanish (2000). Shortly after the work was published in late 1997, Queriniana of Brescia asked Dupuis to write a shorter, more accessible version. This time Dupuis wrote in Italian, and completed the manuscript on 31 March 2000 - over five months before the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith pub lished the declaration Dominus Jesus and almost a year before the Congregation issued on 27 February 2001 a notification on Toward a Christian Theology of Religious Pluralism. For various reasons the publication of Dupuis' shorter work was delayed for over a year and fìnally appeared in the autumn of 2001. A full year later English, French and Spanish translations were published." The literature and documentation on Toward is vast. Dupuis' own article for Louvain Studies in 1999, for example, took into account twenty reviews that had appeared in English and twenty seven in French.12 In ali, there have been so far over one hundred reviews in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and other languages, as well as many articles and chapters in books dedicat ed, in whole or in part, to a criticai evaluation of his views. Clearly Dupuis has addressed a centrai question: how can one profess and proclaim Jesus Christ as the Redeemer of ali humankind, while recognizing some beneficiai role of non-Christian religions in the salvation of their adherents? Within a Christian perspective what could be the role of these religions, some of which pre-date the birth of Christ? What might the various religious traditions of the world mean in the divine pian for the whole of humankind? In this second part of my article, I want to summarize the con tent of Christianity, indicate some of the points where it differs 10 Maryknoll (NY), 1997; hereafter Toward.

What can we retrieve for the debate from a re-reading of the Council of Chalcedon and the Third Council of Constantinople? Does St Thomas Aquinas' use of reduplicative propositions have anything to contribute here? As Dupuis himself explains, his second work omits much scholarly debate with other authors and reduces footnotes to a minimum. At the same time, Dupuis also aims at avoiding some earlier ambiguities, introducing further data from Christian revela tion and tradition to back up his positions, and clarifying those positions even better (.Christianity, p. 262). In this second book he faces the same basic questione: (a) Can the adherents of other reli gione be saved? (b) If one answers yes, do the elements of truth and grace found in these religions mean that the adherents can be saved, not despite, but through these elements? (c) If one answers yes, do these religions enjoy a positive meaning in God's one pian of salvation for ali human beings - or in the language of the Letter to the Ephesians - in the one recapitulation of ali things in Christ? In answering affirmatively ali three questions, Christianity sums up Dupuis' position by introducing a new expression, «inclusive pluralism», which is explained in the ten chapters of the book. Dupuis opens with three chapters that summarize the atti tude of Jesus and the New Testament Church towards those who do not belong to «the people of God», the relevant teaching of Vatican II and Paul VI and John Paul II, and the major theological views in the field of the theology of religions. The further seven chapters treat themes which illuminate and support Dupuis' own «inclusive pluralism». The scriptures recali how God instituted sav ing covenants with «other» peoples, who can therefore be called «peoples of God» (Ch. 4). The «many and various ways» (Hebrews 1:1) through which the divine revelation has come may be under stood to include wider religious traditions (Ch. 5). The Logos has acted salvifically in a way that transcends but is always related to the created humanity it assumes (Ch. 6). Other religions form «par ticipated mediations» in the one «mediation» of Christ (Ch. 7). While not separated from the wider reality of the Kingdom of God, the Church is not identical with it (Ch. 8). Interreligious dialogue is mutually enriching (Ch. 9), and, in particular, shared prayer should be encouraged (Ch. 10). As before, a trinitarian christology con</page><page sequence="11">CHRIST AND THE RELIGIONS 357 stantly supports the position of Dupuis, even if in Christianity he sums up his theology of religions as «inclusive pluralism». Chapter 6 of Christianity raises perhaps the key issue in the debate about Dupuis' contribution to the theology of religions: the divine activity of the Logos, while always related to the humanity assumed at the incarnation, is not limited to that humanity. The situation «before» the incarnation does not pose or should not pose much difficulty. Unless one wants to claim in a heterodox fashion that the created humanity of Christ really (and not merely intentionally or in the divine intention) existed from ali eternity and hence did not truly first come into existence at his conception and birth (around 5 BC), one should recognize that it was only through his divine nature that the Logos was active in the creation and conservation of the universe and in the unfolding history of salvation. The human nature, while always present in the divine pian, did not actually «pre-exist» the incarnation. When we maintain, however, that the person of the Logos «pre-existed» the incarnation and «was» active then, we need always to recali that the existence of any of the divine Persons has no «before» and «after». The eternai «now» of the existence of the divine Persons means an unchangeable fullness of fife, with no relations of before and after, no having-been and going-to-be. Hence we strain language (in an anthropomorphic fashion) when we speak of the Logos personally existing and being active «before» the incarnation. But it is another question with the humanity assumed at the virginal conception. This did not antedate the his torical event of the incarnation. In the case of the human nature assumed by the Logos, «there was a time when this nature was not» - to apply the language of Nicaea to the humanity and not to the person of the Son of God. From this point of view it would have made perfect sense to have said at the time of the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity or the assassination of Julius Caesar in BC 44, «the incarnation has not yet taken place», and «the human nature of the Son of God is not yet operating». The his torical humanity began its existence within the temporal order; the person of the Son of God exists eternally and timelessly. As Thomas Aquinas put it, «the human nature» of Christ is both created and began to be in time, whereas «the subsistent subject» is both uncreated and eternai (ST, 3a. 16.10).</page><page sequence="12">358 GERALD O'COLLINS Burning questione begin over what happens at the incarna tion, questions with which the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) and later the Third Council of Constantinople (AD 681) were con cerned. Against a «monophysite» view, which apparently held that with the union of the incarnation the human nature was absorbed by the divine nature, the Chalcedonian defìnition taught that the two natures of Christ, while not «separated» or «divided» remain «distinct» and with the «character» proper to each nature being «preserved» (DzH, 302). In the seventh century a «monophysite» tendency was trans posed to the level of Christ's will and actions. The wider error labelled «mono-energism» recognized only one action in Christ, as if he had only one nature or principle of activity. This amounted to a «monophysite» view of Christ's activity, as if his human action were absorbed by the divine principle of activity. The error labelled «mono-thelitism» recognized only one will in Christ, as if his divine will had swallowed up or replaced his human will. Constantinople III re-read and applied the Chalcedonian teaching in the context of the new questions about the activity and will of the two natures of Christ. It taught that the incarnate Son of God enjoyed and enjoys a human and a divine will (the two wills being in perfect harmony with each other) and two «energies» or «naturai operations». Applying and extending Chalcedonian terminology to the issues it faced, Constantinople III insisted that the two wills and «naturai operations» were neither separated from each other nor blended together (DzH 556-58). By rejecting «mono-energism» and «mono-thelitism», Constantinople III defended the presence in Christ of a complete human nature with its complete human operations, and so upheld in him a duality of activity and a unity of agent. Obviously the Council's focus of attention was not precisely on distinguishing (a) the ongoing «post»-incarnation, divine operations on the part of the incarnate Word of God from (b) the human operations of the same agent (whose actual human operations began with the incar nation). Nevertheless, the Council's insistence on the continuing presence in the one Christ not only of two wills but, more general ly, of two «naturai operations», which are to be distinguished and not blended or amalgamated, does not seem compatible with holding that the infinitely powerful, unlimited divine activity of the</page><page sequence="13">CHRIST AND THE RELIGIONS 359 Logos is limited by, must «pass through», or is somehow deter mined by or even «eclipsed» by his humanity assumed at the incar nation and now glorified through the resurrection. In the incarna tion the Son of God's divine nature does not lose any of its essen tial characteristics and, in particular, its operations which are strictly infinite and uniquely divine and in that sense transcend the finite operations of his human nature, even while being constant ly related to it. A remark by St Thomas Aquinas seems apropos here. He both championed the oneness of Christ's person, and recognized that Christ's «divine nature [with its operations] infi nitely transcends his human nature [with its operations]» (Summa contra Gentiles, 4. 35. 8), while remaining always inseparable from that human nature. In Toward, Dupuis did not cite Constantinople III in support of his position about the divine activity of the incarnate Logos not being limited by his humanity. In Christianity Dupuis does briefly draw attention to the importance of this Council's teaching for reflection on the universal salvific activity of the divine Word «before» and «after» the incarnation (p. 144). In general, however, the highly relevant teaching of Constantinople III has hardly sur faced in the whole debate. Yet that teaching supports some perti nent remarks by Thomas Aquinas about «the soul of Christ» and its operations, since and inasmuch as they are created, not being «almighty» (Summa Theologiae, 3a. 13. 1). By using reduplicative (as, qua, in so far as, or inasmuch as) statements in the christological section of his Summa, Aquinas contributes to some clarification of the issues. Reduplicative state ments indicate the manner in which or capacity in which a predi cate is attributed to a subject. The same woman may be, for instance, the mayor of a city, a lawyer, and a wife. As mayor, she can have the authority to introduce new city ordinances, but not as wife. As a lawyer, she can appear before this or that court, but not as mayor. The «inasmuch as» characteristic of a reduplicative statement indicates the manner in which a particular predicate can be truthfully attributed to a particular subject. Hence Aquinas distinguishes Christ as «subsistent subject» or divine agent, on the one hand, from Christ «as (secundum quod) man», on the other. As man, Christ is a creature, is not eternai, and begins to exist (ST, 3a. 16. 10). Such reduplicative statements can</page><page sequence="14">360 GERALD O'COLLINS be applied to the teaching of Constantinople III. Inasmuch as he is man, Christ's «energies» and «operations» are created and limited; inasmuch as he is God, his «energies» and «operations» are uncre ated and infinite. In both cases following the strategy of Thomas' reduplicative statements allows us see what is the case, by defini tion and necessity about the dual natures and operations of the Son of God.13 It was by forgetting the force of such reduplicative statements that two critics of Dupuis' position allowed themselves to say that the Word «as such» «the Word Incarnate. This would mean that, by definition and hence necessarily and always, the Word is the Word Incarnate. We would then need to re-write John's Prologue and make it read: «In the beginning was the Word Incarnate, and the Word Incarnate was with God, and the Word Incarnate was God». This would mean fading into a error condemned by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's declaration issued on 5 September 2000: namely, that of «a metaphysical emptying of the event of the eternai Logos' historical incarnation», which would reduce the incarnation «to a mere appearing in history» of the Logos «already» incarnated from «the beginning» (Dominus Jesus, 4). To sum up this section: the teaching of Constantinople III and Thomas Aquinas' careful use of reduplicative statements promise some guidelines and a little further clarity for interpreting God's revealing and saving dealings with ali human beings through the divine activity not only «before» but also «after» the incarnation. III. Before concluding, I want to propose a possible way of think ing fruitfully about Christ's revealing and saving presence to ali people. We saw above how Vatican II not only retrieved the patris tic language of the «seeds of the Word», but also wrote about the 13 On Thomas's use of reduplicative statements in elucidating the incarnation, see Eleonore Stump, «Aquinas' Metaphysics of Incarnation», in S.

Righi from his first encyclical John Paul II, without neglecting the conciliar teaching on the «seeds of the Word», developed rather the theme of the Holy Spirit «operating» everywhere [RedemptorHominis, 6,11). The themes of the Word and the Spirit have their deep Old Testament roots, and so too does that of Lady Wisdom. Both magisterial teaching and theology have attended at length to the Word and the Spirit. The feminine Image of Wisdom might also be employed to convey much about Christ's revealing and salvific activity for ali people.14 Modem biblical scholarship has successfully explored the rich themes of Wisdom, and done so also in the area of Christ and the religions. The scripture scholar Giovanni Odasso concludes his study thus: «The religions [...] from the perspective of the Old and New Testament texts [...] are on earth a gift of God to ali peoples, and therefore a sign of the salvifìcally operative presence of Wisdom».15 Theology might well be advised to draw on many such rich and positive studies made by biblical scholars and develop wisdom christologies, which will have a peculiar relevance for the theme of this article. Unfortunately no such well developed chris tologies are yet available. An obvious advantage about interpreting Christ's role of uni versal Revealer and Saviour through the image of wisdom comes from the fact that the Jewish-Christian scriptures and religion do not have a monopoly on wisdom. In one form or another, at least some wise teachings and ways of life turn up in ali cultures, soci eties, and religions. Being found everywhere, sapiential modes of thought make an obvious bridge between the adherents of Christianity and others. Christian faith can see in ali genuine wis dom the saving and revealing presence of Christ: ibi sapientia ibi Christus (where wisdom is, there is Christ). To recognize in Christ the full revelation of God and the Saviour of ali is not, then, to deny 11 On Wisdom in the scriptures, see my The Tripersonal God, Mahwah (NJ), 1999, pp. 23-30, 32-34; R. E.

The unique and normative role of Christ in the history of sal vation extends to the numerous and varied ways he works as divine Wisdom in the lives of people who follow other religions and receive salvation through them. Thus God proves, through the dis tinguishable but never separable activity of the incarnate Son and the Holy Spirit, to be «also the God of the Gentiles». Gerald O'Collins, S.i. SOMMARIO L'articolo inizia richiamando alcuni insegnamenti del Vaticano Secondo che ha un rilievo particolare per la teologia delle religioni. Esiste un'unica «economia» divina di rivelazione salvifica che fa appello alla fede degli uomini. Rivelazione e salvezza sono due dimensioni, distinguibili ma non separabili, della comunicazione che Dio fa di se stesso. L'iniziativa definitiva per la salvezza di tutta l'umanità attraverso il Figlio incarnato e lo Spirito Santo viene dal Padre. L'articolo riassume il contenuto del vol ume Christianity and the Religions (2002) di Jacques Dupuis, indicando le differenze rispetto al precedente Toward a Christian Theology ofReligious Pluralism (1997) e discute la questione della natura divina del Logos non limitata dalla natura umana assunta al momento dell'incarnazione, anche se sempre relazionata ad essa. La discussione verte sull'insegnamento del Costantinopolitano III come pure su alcune distinzioni cristologiche di S. Tommaso d'Aquino. L'articolo termina suggerendo l'importanza della tematica sapienziale per interpretare il ruolo di Cristo come Rivelatore e Salvatore universale.</page></plain_text>
