<plain_text><page sequence="1">Women's Time Julia Kristeva Translated by Alice Jardine and Harry Blake The nation--dream and reality of the nineteenth century-seems to have reached both its apogee and its limits when the 1929 crash and the National-Socialist apocalypse demolished the pillars that, according to Marx, were its essence: economic homogeneity, historical tradition, and linguistic unity.1 It could indeed be demonstrated that World War II, though fought in the name of national values (in the above sense of the term), brought an end to the nation as a reality: It was turned into a mere illusion which, from that point forward, would be preserved only for ideological or strictly political purposes, its social and philosophical coherence having collapsed. To move quickly toward the specific prob- lematic that will occupy us in this article, let us say that the chimera of economic homogeneity gave way to interdependence (when not submission to the economic superpowers), while historical tradition and linguistic unity were recast as a broader and deeper determinant: what might be called a symbolic denominator, defined as the cultural and religious memory forged by the interweaving of history and geography. The variants of this memory produce social territories which then redistribute the cutting up into political parties which is still in use but losing strength. At the same time, this memory or symbolic denominator, common to them all, re- veals beyond economic globalization and/or uniformization certain characteristics transcending the nation that sometimes embrace an entire continent. A new social ensemble superior to the nation has thus been This article was originally published as "Le Temps des femmes" in 34/44: Cahiers de recherche de sciences des textes et documents, no. 5 (Winter 1979), pp. 5-19. 1. The following discussion emphasizes Europe in a way which may seem superfluous to some American readers given the overall emphasis on deterritorialization. It is, how- ever, essential to the movement of an article that is above all devoted to the necessity of paying attention to the place from which we speak.-AJ, TRANS.

For this memory or symbolic common denominator concerns the response that human groupings, united in space and time, have given not to the problems of the production of material goods (i.e., the domain of the economy and of the human relationships it implies, politics, etc.) but, rather, to those of reproduction, survival of the species, life and death, the body, sex, and symbol. If it is true, for example, that Europe is representative of such a sociocultural ensemble, it seems to me that its existence is based more on this "symbolic denominator," which its art, philosophy, and religions manifest, than on its economic profile, which is certainly interwoven with collective memory but whose traits change rather rapidly under pressure from its partners. It is clear that a social ensemble thus constituted possesses both a solidity rooted in a particular mode of reproduction and its repre- sentations through which the biological species is connected to its hu- manity, which is a tributary of time; as well as a certainfragility as a result of the fact that, through its universality, the symbolic common de- nominator is necessarily echoed in the corresponding symbolic de- nominator of another sociocultural ensemble. Thus, barely constituted as such, Europe finds itself being asked to compare itself with, or even to recognize itself in, the cultural, artistic, philosophical, and religious con- structions belonging to other supranational sociocultural ensembles. This seems natural when the entities involved were linked by history (e.g., Europe and North America, or Europe and Latin America), but the phenomenon also occurs when the universality of this denominator we have called symbolic juxtaposes modes of production and reproduc- tion apparently opposed in both the past and the present (e.g., Europe and India, or Europe and China). In short, with sociocultural ensembles of the European type, we are constantly faced with a double problema- tic: that of their identity constituted by historical sedimentation, and that of their loss of identity which is produced by this connection of memories which escape from history only to encounter anthropology. In other words, we confront two temporal dimensions: the time of linear history, or cursive time (as Nietzsche called it), and the time of another history, thus another time, monumental time (again according to Nietzsche), which englobes these supranational, sociocultural ensembles within even larger entities. I should like to draw attention to certain formations which seem to me to summarize the dynamics of a sociocultural organism of this type. The question is one of sociocultural groups, that is, groups defined according to their place in production, but especially according to their Women's Time</page><page sequence="3">Autumn 1981 15 role in the mode of reproduction and its representations, which, while bearing the specific sociocultural traits of the formation in question, are diagonal to it and connect it to other sociocultural formations. I am thinking in particular of sociocultural groups which are usually defined as age groups (e.g., "young people in Europe"), as sexual divisions (e.g., "European women"), and so forth. While it is obvious that "young people" or "women" in Europe have their own particularity, it is nonetheless just as obvious that what defines them as "young people" or as "women" places them in a diagonal relationship to their European "origin" and links them to similar categories in North America or in China, among others. That is, insofar as they also belong to "monumen- tal history," they will not be only European "young people" or "women" of Europe but will echo in a most specific way the universal traits of their structural place in reproduction and its representations. Consequently, the reader will find in the following pages, first, an attempt to situate the problematic of women in Europe within an inquiry on time: that time which the feminist movement both inherits and modifies. Second, I will attempt to distinguish two phases or two genera- tions of women which, while immediately universalist and cosmopolitan in their demands, can nonetheless be differentiated by the fact that the first generation is more determined by the implications of a national problematic (in the sense suggested above), while the second, more de- termined by its place within the "symbolic denominator," is European and trans-European. Finally, I will try, both through the problems ap- proached and through the type of analysis I propose, to present what I consider a viable stance for a European-or at least a European woman-within a domain which is henceforth worldwide in scope. Which Time? "Father's time, mother's species," as Joyce put it; and, indeed, when evoking the name and destiny of women, one thinks more of the space generating and forming the human species than of time, becoming, or history. The modern sciences of subjectivity, of its genealogy and acci- dents, confirm in their own way this intuition, which is perhaps itself the result of a sociohistorical conjuncture. Freud, listening to the dreams and fantasies of his patients, thought that "hysteria was linked to place."2 Subsequent studies on the acquisition of the symbolic function by chil- dren show that the permanence and quality of maternal love condition the appearance of the first spatial references which induce the child's laugh and then induce the entire range of symbolic manifestations which 2.

I could go on giving exam- ples. But they all converge on the problematic of space, which innumer- able religions of matriarchal (re)appearance attribute to "woman," and which Plato, recapitulating in his own system the atomists of antiquity, designated by the aporia of the chora, matrix space, nourishing, un- nameable, anterior to the One, to God and, consequently, defying metaphysics.4 As for time, female5 subjectivity would seem to provide a specific measure that essentially retains repetition and eternity from among the multiple modalities of time known through the history of civilizations. On the one hand, there are cycles, gestation, the eternal recurrence of a biological rhythm which conforms to that of nature and imposes a tem- porality whose stereotyping may shock, but whose regularity and unison with what is experienced as extrasubjective time, cosmic time, occasion vertiginous visions and unnameablejouissance.6 On the other hand, and perhaps as a consequence, there is the massive presence of a monumen- tal temporality, without cleavage or escape, which has so little to do with linear time (which passes) that the very word "temporality" hardly fits: All-encompassing and infinite like imaginary space, this temporality re- minds one of Kronos in Hesiod's mythology, the incestuous son whose 3.

It is a term used to speak about women in general, but, as used most often in this article, it probably comes closest to our "female" as defined by Elaine Showalter in A Literature of Their Own (Prince- ton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1977). I have therefore used either "women" or "female" according to the context (cf. also n. 9 in "Introduction to Julia Kristeva's 'Wom- en's Time' " [this issue; hereafter cited as "Introduction"]). "Subjectivity" here refers to the state of being "a thinking, speaking, acting, doing or writing agent" and never, e.g., as opposed to "objectivity" (see the glossary in Desire in Language).-AJ. 6.

In return, female subjectivity as it gives itself up to intuition be- comes a problem with respect to a certain conception of time: time as project, teleology, linear and prospective unfolding; time as departure, progression, and arrival-in other words, the time of history.10 It has already been abundantly demonstrated that this kind of temporality is inherent in the logical and ontological values of any given civilization, that this temporality renders explicit a rupture, an expectation, or an anguish which other temporalities work to conceal. It might also be added that this linear time is that of language considered as the enuncia- tion of sentences (noun + verb; topic-comment; beginning-ending), and that this time rests on its own stumbling block, which is also the stum- bling block of that enunciation-death. A psychoanalyst would call this "obsessional time," recognizing in the mastery of time the true structure of the slave. The hysteric (either male or female) who suffers from reminiscences would, rather, recognize his or her self in the anterior temporal modalities: cyclical or monumental. This antinomy, one perhaps embedded in psychic structures, becomes, nonetheless, within a given civilization, an antinomy among social groups and ideologies in which the radical positions of certain feminists would rejoin the dis- course of marginal groups of spiritual or mystical inspiration and, strangely enough, rejoin recent scientific preoccupations. Is it not true that the problematic of a time indissociable from space, of a space-time in infinite expansion, or rhythmed by accidents or catastrophes, pre- occupies both space science and genetics? And, at another level, is it not 7. This particular mythology has important implications-equal only to those of the oedipal myth-for current French thought.-AJ. 8.

Signs</page><page sequence="6">18 Kristeva true that the contemporary media revolution, which is manifest in the storage and reproduction of information, implies an idea of time as frozen or exploding according to the vagaries of demand, returning to its source but uncontrollable, utterly bypassing its subject and leaving only two preoccupations to those who approve of it: Who is to have power over the origin (the programming) and over the end (the use)? It is for two precise reasons, within the framework of this article, that I have allowed myself this rapid excursion into a problematic of unheard of complexity. The reader will undoubtedly have been struck by a fluctuation in the term of reference: mother, woman, hysteric.... I think that the apparent coherence which the term "woman" assumes in contemporary ideology, apart from its "mass" or "shock" effect for ac- tivist purposes, essentially has the negative effect of effacing the dif- ferences among the diverse functions or structures which operate be- neath this word. Indeed, the time has perhaps come to emphasize the multiplicity of female expressions and preoccupations so that from the intersection of these differences there might arise, more precisely, less commercially, and more truthfully, the realfundamental difference be- tween the two sexes: a difference that feminism has had the enormous merit of rendering painful, that is, productive of surprises and of sym- bolic life in a civilization which, outside the stock exchange and wars, is bored to death. It is obvious, moreover, that one cannot speak of Europe or of "women in Europe" without suggesting the time in which this sociocul- tural distribution is situated. If it is true that a female sensibility emerged a century ago, the chances are great that by introducing its own notion of time, this sensibility is not in agreement with the idea of an "eternal Europe" and perhaps not even with that of a "modern Europe." Rather, through and with the European past and present, as through and with the ensemble of "Europe," which is the repository of memory, this sensi- bility seeks its own trans-European temporality. There are, in any case, three attitudes on the part of European feminist movements toward this conception of linear temporality, which is readily labeled masculine and which is at once both civilizational and obsessional. Two Generations In its beginnings, the women's movement, as the struggle of suf- fragists and of existential feminists, aspired to gain a place in linear time as the time of project and history. In this sense, the movement, while immediately universalist, is also deeply rooted in the sociopolitical life of nations. The political demands of women; the struggles for equal pay for equal work, for taking power in social institutions on an equal footing with men; the rejection, when necessary, of the attributes traditionally Women's Time</page><page sequence="7">Autumn 1981 19 considered feminine or maternal insofar as they are deemed in- compatible with insertion in that history-all are part of the logic of identification11 with certain values: not with the ideological (these are combated, and rightly so, as reactionary) but, rather, with the logical and ontological values of a rationality dominant in the nation-state. Here it is unnecessary to enumerate the benefits which this logic of identification and the ensuing struggle have achieved and continue to achieve for women (abortion, contraception, equal pay, professional recognition, etc.); these have already had or will soon have effects even more impor- tant than those of the Industrial Revolution. Univeralist in its approach, this current in feminism globalizes the problems of women of different milieux, ages, civilizations, or simply of varying psychic structures, under the label "Universal Woman." A consideration of generations of women can only be conceived of in this global way as a succession, as a progres- sion in the accomplishment of the initial program mapped out by its founders. In a second phase, linked, on the one hand, to the younger women who came to feminism after May 1968 and, on the other, to women who had an aesthetic or psychoanalytic experience, linear tem- porality has been almost totally refused, and as a consequence there has arisen an exacerbated distrust of the entire political dimension. If it is true that this more recent current of feminism refers to its predecessors and that the struggle for sociocultural recognition of women is necessar- ily its main concern, this current seems to think of itself as belonging to another generation-qualitatively different from the first one-in its conception of its own identity and, consequently, of temporality as such. Essentially interested in the specificity of female psychology and its sym- bolic realizations, these women seek to give a language to the intra- subjective and corporeal experiences left mute by culture in the past. Either as artists or writers, they have undertaken a veritable exploration of the dynamic of signs, an exploration which relates this tendency, at least at the level of its aspirations, to all major projects of aesthetic and reli- gious upheaval. Ascribing this experience to a new generation does not only mean that other, more subtle problems have been added to the demands for sociopolitical identification made in the beginning. It also means that, by demanding recognition of an irreducible identity, with- out equal in the opposite sex and, as such, exploded, plural, fluid, in a certain way nonidentical, this feminism situates itself outside the linear time of identities which communicate through projection and revindica- 11. The term "identification" belongs to a wide semantic field ranging from everyday language to philosophy and psychoanalysis. While Kristeva is certainly referring in princi- ple to its elaboration in Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, it can be understood here, as a logic, in its most general sense (see the entry on "identification" in Jean LaPlanche and J. B. Pontalis, Vocabulaire de la psychanalyse [The language of psychoanalysis] [Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1967; rev. ed., 1976]).-AJ. Signs</page><page sequence="8">20 Kristeva tion. Such a feminism rejoins, on the one hand, the archaic (mythical) memory and, on the other, the cyclical or monumental temporality of marginal movements. It is certainly not by chance that the European and trans-European problematic has been posited as such at the same time as this new phase of feminism. Finally, it is the mixture of the two attitudes-insertion into history and the radical refusal of the subjective limitations imposed by this his- tory's time on an experiment carried out in the name of the irreducible difference-that seems to have broken loose over the past few years in European feminist movements, particularly in France and in Italy. If we accept this meaning of the expression "a new generation of women," two kinds of questions might then be posed. What sociopolitical processes or events have provoked this mutation? What are its problems: its contributions as well as dangers? Socialism and Freudianism One could hypothesize that if this new generation of women shows itself to be more diffuse and perhaps less conscious in the United States and more massive in Western Europe, this is because of a veritable split in social relations and mentalities, a split produced by socialism and Freudianism. I mean by socialism that egalitarian doctrine which is in- creasingly broadly disseminated and accepted as based on common sense, as well as that social practice adopted by governments and political parties in democratic regimes which are forced to extend the zone of egalitarianism to include the distribution of goods as well as access to culture. By Freudianism I mean that lever, inside this egalitarian and socializing field, which once again poses the question of sexual dif- ference and of the difference among subjects who themselves are not reducible one to the other. Western socialism, shaken in its very beginnings by the egalitarian or differential demands of its women (e.g., Flora Tristan), quickly got rid of those woman who aspired to recognition of a specificity of the female role in society and culture, only retaining from them, in the egalitarian and universalistic spirit of Enlightenment Humanism, the idea of a nec- essary identification between the two sexes as the only and unique means for liberating the "second sex." I shall not develop here the fact that this "ideal" is far from being applied in practice by these socialist-inspired movements and parties and that it was in part from the revolt against this situation that the new generation of women in Western Europe was born after May 1968. Let us just say that in theory, and as put into practice in Eastern Europe, socialist ideology, based on a conception of the human being as determined by its place in production and the relations of produc- tion, did not take into consideration this same human being according to Women's Time</page><page sequence="9">Autumn 1981 21 its place in reproduction, on the one hand, or in the symbolic order, on the other. Consequently, the specific character of women could only appear as nonessential or even nonexistent to the totalizing and even totalitarian spirit of this ideology.12 We begin to see that this same egalitarian and in fact censuring treatment has been imposed, from Enlightenment Humanism through socialism, on religious specificities and, in particu- lar, on Jews.13 What has been achieved by this attitude remains nonetheless of capital importance for women, and I shall take as an example the change in the destiny of women in the socialist countries of Eastern Europe. It could be said, with only slight exaggeration, that the demands of the suffragists and existential feminists have, to a great extent, been met in these countries, since three of the main egalitarian demands of early feminism have been or are now being implemented despite vagaries and blunders: economic, political, and professional equality. The fourth, sexual equality, which implies permissiveness in sexual relations (in- cluding homosexual relations), abortion, and contraception, remains stricken by taboo in Marxian ethics as well as for reasons of state. It is, then, this fourth equality which is the problem and which therefore appears essential in the struggle of a new generation. But simultaneously and as a consequence of these socialist accomplishments-which are in fact a total deception-the struggle is no longer concerned with the quest for equality but, rather, with difference and specificity. It is precisely at this point that the new generation encounters what might be called the symbolic question.'4 Sexual difference-which is at once biological, physi- ological, and relative to reproduction-is translated by and translates a difference in the relationship of subjects to the symbolic contract which is the social contract: a difference, then, in the relationship to power, lan- guage, and meaning. The sharpest and most subtle point of feminist subversion brought about by the new generation will henceforth be situated on the terrain of the inseparable conjunction of the sexual and the symbolic, in order to try to discover, first, the specificity of the female, and then, in the end, that of each individual woman. A certain saturation of socialist ideology, a certain exhaustion of its potential as a program for a new social contract (it is obvious that the 12. See D.

Here, "symbolic" is being more strictly used in terms of that function defined by Kristeva in opposition to the semiotic: "it involves the thetic phase, the identification of subject and its distinction from objects, and the establishment of a sign system" (see the glossary in Desire in Language, and Alice Jardine, "Theories of the Feminine: Kristeva," Enclitic, in press).-AJ. Signs</page><page sequence="10">22 Kristeva effective realization of this program is far from being accomplished, and I am here treating only its system of thought) makes way for . . . Freudianism. I am, of course, aware that this term and this practice are somewhat shocking to the American intellectual consciousness (which rightly reacts to a muddled and normatizing form of psychoanalysis) and, above all, to the feminist consciousness. To restrict my remarks to the latter: Is it not true that Freud has been seen only as a denigrator or even an exploiter of women? as an irritating phallocrat in a Vienna which was at once Puritan and decadent-a man who fantasized women as sub-men, castrated men? Castrated and/or Subject to Language Before going beyond Freud to propose a more just or more modern vision of women, let us try, first, to understand his notion of castration. It is, first of all, a question of an anguish orfear of castration, or of correla- tive penis envy; a question, therefore, of imaginary formations readily perceivable in the discourse of neurotics of both sexes, men and women. But, above all, a careful reading of Freud, going beyond his biologism and his mechanism, both characteristic of his time, brings out two things. First, as presupposition for the "primal scene," the castration fantasy and its correlative (penis envy) are hypotheses, a priori suppositions intrinsic to the theory itself, in the sense that these are not the ideological fan- tasies of their inventor but, rather, logical necessities to be placed at the "origin" in order to explain what unceasingly functions in neurotic dis- course. In other words, neurotic discourse, in man and woman, can only be understood in terms of its own logic when its fundamental causes are admitted as the fantasies of the primal scene and castration, even if (as may be the case) nothing renders them present in reality itself. Stated in still other terms, the reality of castration is no more real than the hypothesis of an explosion which, according to modern astrophysics, is at the origin of the universe: Nothing proves it, in a sense it is an article of faith, the only difference being that numerous phenomena of life in this "big-bang" universe are explicable only through this initial hypothe- sis. But one is infinitely more jolted when this kind of intellectual method concerns inanimate matter than when it is applied to our own sub- jectivity and thus, perhaps, to the fundamental mechanism of our epis- temophilic thought. Moreover, certain texts written by Freud (The Interpretation of Dreams, but especially those of the second topic, in particular the Metapsychology) and their recent extensions (notably by Lacan),15 imply 15. See, in general, Jacques Lacan, Ecrits (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1966) and, in particular, Jacques Lacan, Le Seminaire XX: Encore (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1975).-AJ. Women's Time</page><page sequence="11">Autumn 1981 23 that castration is, in sum, the imaginary construction of a radical opera- tion which constitutes the symbolic field and all beings inscribed therein. This operation constitutes signs and syntax; that is, language, as a sep- aration from a presumed state of nature, of pleasure fused with nature so that the introduction of an articulated network of differences, which refers to objects henceforth and only in this way separated from a sub- ject, may constitute meaning. This logical operation of separation (con- firmed by all psycholinguistic and child psychology) which preconditions the binding of language which is already syntactical, is therefore the common destiny of the two sexes, men and women. That certain biofamilial conditions and relationships cause women (and notably hys- terics) to deny this separation and the language which ensues from it, whereas men (notably obsessionals) magnify both and, terrified, attempt to master them-this is what Freud's discovery has to tell us on this issue. The analytic situation indeed shows that it is the penis which, be- coming the major referent in this operation of separation, gives full meaning to the lack or to the desire which constitutes the subject during his or her insertion into the order of language. I should only like to indicate here that, in order for this operation constitutive of the symbolic and the social to appear in its full truth and for it to be understood by both sexes, it would be just to emphasize its extension to all that is privation of fullfillment and of totality; exclusion of a pleasing, natural, and sound state: in short, the break indispensable to the advent of the symbolic. It can now be seen how women, starting with this theoretical ap- paratus, might try to understand their sexual and symbolic difference in the framework of social, cultural, and professional realization, in order to try, by seeing their position therein, either to fulfill their own experi- ence to a maximum or-but always starting from this point-to go further and call into question the very apparatus itself. Living the Sacrifice In any case, and for women in Europe today, whether or not they are conscious of the various mutations (socialist and Freudian) which have produced or simply accompanied their coming into their own, the urgent question on our agenda might be formulated as follows: What can be our place in the symbolic contract? If the social contract, far from being that of equal men, is based on an essentially sacrificial relationship of separation and articulation of differences which in this way produces communicable meaning, what is our place in this order of sacrifice and/or of language? No longer wishing to be excluded or no longer content with the function which has always been demanded of us (to maintain, arrange, and perpetuate this sociosymbolic contract as Signs</page><page sequence="12">24 Kristeva mothers, wives, nurses, doctors, teachers . . .), how can we reveal our place, first as it is bequeathed to us by tradition, and then as we want to transform it? It is difficult to evaluate what in the relationship of women to the symbolic as it reveals itself now arises from a sociohistorical conjuncture (patriarchal ideology, whether Christian, humanist, socialist or so forth), and what arises from a structure. We can speak only about a structure observed in a sociohistorical context, which is that of Christian, Western civilization and its lay ramifications. In this sense of psychosymbolic structure, women, "we" (is it necessary to recall the warnings we issued at the beginning of this article concerning the totalizing use of this plural?) seem to feel that they are the casualties, that they have been left out of the sociosymbolic contract, of language as the fundamental social bond. They find no affect there, no more than they find the fluid and in- finitesimal significations of their relationships with the nature of their own bodies, that of the child, another woman, or a man. This frustra- tion, which to a certain extent belongs to men also, is being voiced today principally by women, to the point of becoming the essence of the new feminist ideology. A therefore difficult, if not impossible, identification with the sacrificial logic of separation and syntactical sequence at the foundation of language and the social code leads to the rejection of the symbolic-lived as the rejection of the paternal function and ultimately generating psychoses. But this limit, rarely reached as such, produces two types of coun- terinvestment of what we have termed the sociosymbolic contract. On the one hand, there are attempts to take hold of this contract, to possess it in order to enjoy it as such or to subvert it. How? The answer remains difficult to formulate (since, precisely, any formulation is deemed frus- trating, mutilating, sacrificial) or else is in fact formulated using stereotypes taken from extremist and often deadly ideologies. On the other hand, another attitude is more lucid from the beginning, more self-analytical which-without refusing or sidestepping this sociosym- bolic order-consists in trying to explore the constitution and function- ing of this contract, starting less from the knowledge accumulated about it (anthropology, psychoanalysis, linguistics) than from the very personal affect experienced when facing it as subject and as a woman. This leads to the active research,16 still rare, undoubtedly hesitant but always dis- sident, being carried out by women in the human sciences; particularly those attempts, in the wake of contemporary art, to break the code, to 16.

I am not speaking here of a "woman's language," whose (at least syntactical) exis- tence is highly problematical and whose apparent lexical specificity is perhaps more the product of a social marginality than of a sexual- symbolic difference.17 Nor am I speaking of the aesthetic quality of productions by women, most of which-with a few exceptions (but has this not always been the case with both sexes?)-are a reiteration of a more or less euphoric or depressed romanticism and always an explosion of an ego lacking narcis- sistic gratification.18 What I should like to retain, nonetheless, as a mark of collective aspiration, as an undoubtedly vague and unimplemented in- tention, but one which is intense and which has been deeply revealing these past few years, is this: The new generation of women is showing that its major social concern has become the sociosymbolic contract as a sacrificial contract. If anthropologists and psychologists, for at least a century, have not stopped insisting on this in their attention to "savage thought," wars, the discourse of dreams, or writers, women are today affirming-and we consequently face a mass phenomenon-that they are forced to experience this sacrificial contract against their will.19 Based on this, they are attempting a revolt which they see as a resurrec- tion but which society as a whole understands as murder. This attempt can lead us to a not less and sometimes more deadly violence. Or to a cultural innovation. Probably to both at once. But that is precisely where the stakes are, and they are of epochal significance. 17. See linguistic research on "female language": Robin Lakoff, Language and Wom- en's Place (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1974); Mary R. Key, Male/Female Language (Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1973); A. M. Houdebine, "Les Femmes et la langue," Tel quel, no. 74 (1977), pp. 84-95. The contrast between these "empirical" investigations of women's "speech acts" and much of the research in France on the conceptual bases for a "female language" must be emphasized here. It is somewhat helpful, if ultimately in- accurate, to think of the former as an "external" study of language and the latter as an "internal" exploration of the process of signification. For further contrast, see, e.g., "Part II: Contemporary Feminist Thought in France: Translating Difference" in The Future of Difference, ed. Hester Eisenstein and Alice Jardine (Boston: G. K. Hall &amp; Co., 1980); the "Introductions" to New French Feminisms, ed. Elaine Marks and Isabelle de Courtivron (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1980); and for a very helpful overview of the problem of "difference and language" in France, see Stephen Heath, "Difference" in Screen 19 no. 3 (Autumn 1978): 51-112.-AJ. 18.

The expression a leur corps defendant translates as "against their will," but here the emphasis is on women's bodies: literally, "against their bodies." I have retained the former expression in English, partly because of its obvious intertextuality with Susan Brownmil- ler's Against Our Will (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1975).

Inequalities, devalorizations, under- estimations, even persecution of women at this level continue to hold sway in vain. The struggle against them is a struggle against archaisms. The cause has nonetheless been understood, the principle has been ac- cepted.20 What remains is to break down the resistance to change. In this sense, this struggle, while still one of the main concerns of the new generation, is not, strictly speaking, its problem. In relationship to power, its problem might rather be summarized as follows: What happens when women come into power and identify with it? What happens when, on the contrary, they refuse power and create a parallel society, a counter- power which then takes on aspects ranging from a club of ideas to a group of terrorist commandos?21 The assumption by women of executive, industrial, and cultural power has not, up to the present time, radically changed the nature of this power. This can be clearly seen in the East, where women promoted to decision-making positions suddenly obtain the economic as well as the narcissistic advantages refused them for thousands of years and become the pillars of the existing governments, guardians of the status quo, the most zealous protectors of the established order.22 This identification by women with the very power structures previously considered as frus- trating, oppressive, or inaccessible has often been used in modern times by totalitarian regimes: the German National-Socialists and the Chilean junta are examples of this.23 The fact that this is a paranoid type of counterinvestment in an initially denied symbolic order can perhaps explain this troubling phenomenon; but an explanation does not pre- vent its massive propagation around the globe, perhaps in less dramatic forms than the totalitarian ones mentioned above, but all moving toward leveling, stabilization, conformism, at the cost of crushing exceptions, experiments, chance occurrences. 20. Many women in the West who are once again finding all doors closed to them above a certain level of employment, especially in the current economic chaos, may find this statement, even qualified, troubling, to say the least. It is accurate, however, in principle: whether that of infinite capitalist recuperation or increasing socialist expansion-within both economies, our integration functions as a kind of operative illusion.-AJ. 21. The very real existence and autonomous activities of both of these versions of women's groups in Europe may seem a less urgent problem in the United States where feminist groups are often absorbed by the academy and/or are forced to remain financially dependent on para-academic/governmental agencies.-AJ. 22.

Electoral cam- paigns, the very life of political parties, continue to bet on this latter tendency. Experience proves that too quickly even the protest or in- novative initiatives on the part of women inhaled by power systems (when they do not submit to them right off) are soon credited to the system's account; and that the long-awaited democratization of in- stitutions as a result of the entry of women most often comes down to fabricating a few "chiefs" among them. The difficulty presented by this logic of integrating the second sex into a value system experienced as foreign and therefore counterinvested is how to avoid the centralization of power, how to detach women from it, and how then to proceed, through their critical, differential, and autonomous interventions, to render decision-making institutions more flexible. Then there are the more radical feminist currents which, refusing homologation to any role of identification with existing power no matter what the power may be, make of the second sex a countersociety. A "female society" is then constituted as a sort of alter ego of the official society, in which all real or fantasized possibilities for jouissance take refuge. Against the sociosymbolic contract, both sacrificial and frustrat- ing, this countersociety is imagined as harmonious, without prohibitions, free and fulfilling. In our modern societies which have no hereafter or, at least, which are caught up in a transcendency either reduced to this side of the world (Protestantism) or crumbling (Catholicism and its cur- rent challenges), the countersociety remains the only refuge for fulfill- ment since it is precisely an a-topia, a place outside the law, utopia's floodgate. As with any society, the countersociety is based on the expulsion of an excluded element, a scapegoat charged with the evil of which the community duly constituted can then purge itself;24 a purge which will finally exonerate that community of any future criticism. Modern pro- test movements have often reiterated this logic, locating the guilty one-in order to fend off criticism-in the foreign, in capital alone, in the other religion, in the other sex. Does not feminism become a kind of inverted sexism when this logic is followed to its conclusion? The various forms of marginalism-according to sex, age, religion, or ideology- represent in the modern world this refuge forjouissance, a sort of laicized transcendence. But with women, and insofar as the number of those feeling concerned by this problem has increased, although in less spec- tacular forms than a few years ago, the problem of the countersociety is 24. The principles of a "sacrificial anthropology" are developed by Rene Girard in La Violence et le sacre [Violence and the sacred] (Paris: Grasset, 1972) and esp. in Des choses cachees depuis lafondation du monde (Paris: Grasset, 1978). Signs</page><page sequence="16">28 Kristeva becoming massive: It occupies no more and no less than "half of the sky." It has, therefore, become clear, because of the particular radicaliza- tion of the second generation, that these protest movements, including feminism, are not "initially libertarian" movements which only later, through internal deviations or external chance manipulations, fall back into the old ruts of the initially combated archetypes. Rather, the very logic of counterpower and of countersociety necessarily generates, by its very structure, its essence as a simulacrum of the combated society or of power. In this sense and from a viewpoint undoubtedly too Hegelian, modern feminism has only been but a moment in the interminable pro- cess of coming to consciousness about the implacable violence (separa- tion, castration, etc.) which constitutes any symbolic contract. Thus the identification with power in order to consolidate it or the constitution of a fetishist counterpower-restorer of the crises of the self and provider of a jouissance which is always already a transgression- seem to be the two social forms which the face-off between the new generation of women and the social contract can take. That one also finds the problem of terrorism there is structurally related. The large number of women in terrorist groups (Palestinian com- mandos, the Baader-Meinhoff Gang, Red Brigades, etc.) has already been pointed out, either violently or prudently according to the source of information. The exploitation of women is still too great and the traditional prejudices against them too violent for one to be able to envision this phenomenon with sufficient distance. It can, however, be said from now on that this is the inevitable product of what we have called a denial of the sociosymbolic contract and its counterinvestment as the only means of self-defense in the struggle to safeguard an identity. This paranoid-type mechanism is at the base of any political involve- ment. It may produce different civilizing attitudes in the sense that these attitudes allow a more or less flexible reabsorption of violence and death. But when a subject is too brutally excluded from this sociosymbolic stratum; when, for example, a woman feels her affective life as a woman or her condition as a social being too brutally ignored by existing dis- course or power (from her family to social institutions); she may, by counterinvesting the violence she has endured, make of herself a "pos- sessed" agent of this violence in order to combat what was experienced as frustration-with arms which may seem disproportional, but which are not so in comparison with the subjective or more precisely narcissistic suffering from which they originate. Necessarily opposed to the bourgeois democratic regimes in power, this terrorist violence offers as a program of liberation an order which is even more oppressive, more sacrificial than those it combats. Strangely enough, it is not against to- talitarian regimes that these terrorist groups with women participants unleash themselves but, rather, against liberal systems, whose essence is, of course, exploitative, but whose expanding democratic legality Women's Time</page><page sequence="17">Autumn 1981 29 guarantees relative tolerance. Each time, the mobilization takes place in the name of a nation, of an oppressed group, of a human essence imag- ined as good and sound; in the name, then, of a kind of fantasy of archaic fulfillment which an arbitrary, abstract, and thus even bad and ultimately discriminatory order has come to disrupt. While that order is accused of being oppressive, is it not actually being reproached with being too weak, with not measuring up to this pure and good, but hence- forth lost, substance? Anthropology has shown that the social order is sacrificial, but sacrifice orders violence, binds it, tames it. Refusal of the social order exposes one to the risk that the so-called good substance, once it is unchained, will explode, without curbs, without law or right, to become an absolute arbitrariness. Following the crisis of monotheism, the revolutions of the past two centuries, and more recently fascism and Stalinism, have tragically set in action this logic of the oppressed goodwill which leads to massacres. Are women more apt than other social categories, notably the exploited classes, to invest in this implacable machine of terrorism? No categorical response, either positive or negative, can currently be given to this ques- tion. It must be pointed out, however, that since the dawn of feminism, and certainly before, the political activity of exceptional women, and thus in a certain sense of liberated women, has taken the form of mur- der, conspiracy, and crime. Finally, there is also the connivance of the young girl with her mother, her greater difficulty than the boy in de- taching herself from the mother in order to accede to the order of signs as invested by the absence and separation constitutive of the paternal function. A girl will never be able to reestablish this contact with her mother-a contact which the boy may possibly rediscover through his relationship with the opposite sex-except by becoming a mother her- self, through a child, or through a homosexuality which is in itself ex- tremely difficult and judged as suspect by society; and, what is more, why and in the name of what dubious symbolic benefit would she want to make this detachment so as to conform to a symbolic system which re- mains foreign to her? In sum, all of these considerations-her eternal debt to the woman-mother-make a woman more vulnerable within the symbolic order, more fragile when she suffers within it, more virulent when she protects herself from it. If the archetype of the belief in a good and pure substance, that of utopias, is the belief in the omnipotence of an archaic, full, total, englobing mother with no frustration, no separa- tion, with no break-producing symbolism (with no castration, in other words), then it becomes evident that we will never be able to defuse the violences mobilized through the counterinvestment necessary to carry- ing out this phantasm, unless one challenges precisely this myth of the archaic mother. It is in this way that we can understand the warnings against the recent invasion of the women's movements by paranoia,25 as 25. Cf. Micheline Enriquez, "Fantasmes paranoiaques: differences des sexes, homosexualite, loi du pere," Topiques, no. 13 (1974). Signs</page><page sequence="18">30 Kristeva in Lacan's scandalous sentence "There is no such thing as Woman."26 Indeed, she does not exist with a capital "W," possessor of some mythical unity-a supreme power, on which is based the terror of power and terrorism as the desire for power. But what an unbelievable force for subversion in the modern world! And, at the same time, what playing with fire! Creatures and Creatresses The desire to be a mother, considered alienating and even reaction- ary by the preceding generation of feminists, has obviously not become a standard for the present generation. But we have seen in the past few years an increasing number of women who not only consider their maternity compatible with their professional life or their feminist in- volvement (certain improvements in the quality of life are also at the origin of this: an increase in the number of day-care centers and nursery schools, more active participation of men in child care and domestic life, etc.) but also find it indispensable to their discovery, not of the plenitude, but of the complexity of the female experience, with all that this com- plexity comprises in joy and pain. This tendency has its extreme: in the refusal of the paternal function by lesbian and single mothers can be seen one of the most violent forms taken by the rejection of the symbolic outlined above, as well as one of the most fervent divinizations of mater- nal power-all of which cannot help but trouble an entire legal and moral order without, however, proposing an alternative to it. Let us remember here that Hegel distinguished between female right (familial and religious) and male law (civil and political). If our societies know well the uses and abuses of male law, it must also be recognized that female right is designated, for the moment, by a blank. And if these practices of maternity, among others, were to be generalized, women themselves would be responsible for elaborating the appropriate legislation to check the violence to which, otherwise, both their children and men would be subject. But are they capable of doing so? This is one of the important questions that the new generation of women encounters, especially when the members of this new generation refuse to ask those questions, seized by the same rage with which the dominant order originally victimized them. Faced with this situation, it seems obvious-and feminist groups become more aware of this when they attempt to broaden their audience-that the refusal of maternity cannot be a mass policy and that 26.

Women's Time</page><page sequence="19">Autumn 1981 31 the majority of women today see the possibility for fulfillment, if not entirely at least to a large degree, in bringing a child into the world. What does this desire for motherhood correspond to? This is one of the new questions for the new generation, a question the preceding genera- tion had foreclosed. For want of an answer to this question, feminist ideology leaves the door open to the return of religion, whose discourse, tried and proved over thousands of years, provides the necessary in- gredients for satisfying the anguish, the suffering, and the hopes of mothers. If Freud's affirmation-that the desire for a child is the desire for a penis and, in this sense, a substitute for phallic and symbolic dominion-can be only partially accepted, what modern women have to say about this experience should nonetheless be listened to attentively. Pregnancy seems to be experienced as the radical ordeal of the splitting of the subject:27 redoubling up of the body, separation and coexistence of the self and of an other, of nature and consciousness, of physiology and speech. This fundamental challenge to identity is then accompanied by a fantasy of totality-narcissistic completeness-a sort of instituted, socialized, natural psychosis. The arrival of the child, on the other hand, leads the mother into the labyrinths of an experience that, without the child, she would only rarely encounter: love for an other. Not for her- self, nor for an identical being, and still less for another person with whom "I" fuse (love or sexual passion). But the slow, difficult, and de- lightful apprenticeship in attentiveness, gentleness, forgetting oneself. The ability to succeed in this path without masochism and without an- nihilating one's affective, intellectual, and professional personality- such would seem to be the stakes to be won through guiltless maternity. It then becomes a creation in the strong sense of the term. For this moment, utopian? On the other hand, it is in the aspiration toward artistic and, in particular, literary creation that woman's desire for affirmation now manifests itself. Why literature? Is it because, faced with social norms, literature reveals a certain knowledge and sometimes the truth itself about an otherwise repressed, nocturnal, secret, and unconscious universe? Because it thus redoubles the social contract by exposing the unsaid, the uncanny? And because it makes a game, a space of fantasy and pleasure, out of the abstract and frustrating order of social signs, the words of everyday communication? Flaubert said, "Madame Bovary, c'est moi." Today many women imag- ine, "Flaubert, c'est moi." This identification with the potency of the imaginary is not only an identification, an imaginary potency (a fetish, a belief in the maternal penis maintained at all costs), as a far too norma- 27. The "split subject" (from Spaltung as both "splitting" and "cleavage"), as used in Freudian psychoanalysis, here refers directly to Kristeva's "subject in process / in question / on trial" as opposed to the unity of the transcendental ego (see n. 14 in "Introduction").-AJ. Signs</page><page sequence="20">32 Kristeva tive view of the social and symbolic relationship would have it. This identification also bears witness to women's desire to lift the weight of what is sacrificial in the social contract from their shoulders, to nourish our societies with a more flexible and free discourse, one able to name what has thus far never been an object of circulation in the community: the enigmas of the body, the dreams, secret joys, shames, hatreds of the second sex. It is understandable from this that women's writing has lately at- tracted the maximum attention of both "specialists" and the media.28 The pitfalls encountered along the way, however, are not to be minimized: For example, does one not read there a relentless belittling of male writers whose books, nevertheless, often serve as "models" for countless productions by women? Thanks to the feminist label, does one not sell numerous works whose naive whining or market-place romanti- cism would otherwise have been rejected as anachronistic? And does one not find the pen of many a female writer being devoted to phantasmic attacks against Language and Sign as the ultimate supports of phallocrat- ic power, in the name of a semi-aphonic corporality whose truth can only be found in that which is "gestural" or "tonal"? And yet, no matter how dubious the results of these recent produc- tions by women, the symptom is there-women are writing, and the air is heavy with expectation: What will they write that is new? In the Name of the Father, the Son ... and the Woman? These few elements of the manifestations by the new generation of women in Europe seem to me to demonstrate that, beyond the sociopolitical level where it is generally inscribed (or inscribes itself), the women's movement-in its present stage, less aggressive but more artful-is situated within the very framework of the religious crisis of our civilization. I call "religion" this phantasmic necessity on the part of speaking beings to provide themselves with a representation (animal, female, male, parental, etc.) in place of what constitutes them as such, in other words, symbolization-the double articulation and syntactic sequence of lan- guage, as well as its preconditions or substitutes (thoughts, affects, etc.). The elements of the current practice of feminism that we have just brought to light seem precisely to constitute such a representation which makes up for the frustrations imposed on women by the anterior code (Christianity or its lay humanist variant). The fact that this new ideology has affinities, often revindicated by its creators, with so-called matriar- 28. Again a reference to ecriturefeminine as generically labeled in France over the past few years and not to women's writing in general.-AJ. Women's Time</page><page sequence="21">Autumn 1981 33 chal beliefs (in other words, those beliefs characterizing matrilinear societies) should not overshadow its radical novelty. This ideology seems to me to be part of the broader antisacrificial current which is animating our culture and which, in its protest against the constraints of the sociosymbolic contract, is no less exposed to the risks of violence and terrorism. At this level of radicalism, it is the very principle of sociality which is challenged. Certain contemporary thinkers consider, as is well known, that modernity is characterized as the first epoch in human history in which human beings attempt to live without religion. In its present form, is not feminism in the process of becoming one? Or is it, on the contrary and as avant-garde feminists hope, that having started with the idea of difference, feminism will be able to break free of its belief in Woman, Her power, Her writing, so as to channel this demand for difference into each and every element of the female whole, and, finally, to bring out the singularity of each woman, and beyond this, her multiplicities, her plural languages, beyond the horizon, beyond sight, beyond faith itself? A factor for ultimate mobilization? Or a factor for analysis? Imaginary support in a technocratic era where all narcissism is frustrated? Or instruments fitted to these times in which the cosmos, atoms, and cells-our true contemporaries-call for the constitution of a fluid and free subjectivity? The question has been posed. Is to pose it already to answer it? Another Generation Is Another Space If the preceding can be said-the question whether all this is true belongs to a different register-it is undoubtedly because it is now possi- ble to gain some distance on these two preceding generations of women. This implies, of course, that a third generation is now forming, at least in Europe. I am not speaking of a new group of young women (though its importance should not be underestimated) or of another "mass feminist movement" taking the torch passed on from the second generation. My usage of the word "generation" implies less a chronology than a signifying space, a both corporeal and desiring mental space. So it can be argued that as of now a third attitude is possible, thus a third generation, which does not exclude-quite to the contrary-the parallel existence of all three in the same historical time, or even that they be interwoven one with the other. In this third attitude, which I strongly advocate-which I imagine?-the very dichotomy man/woman as an opposition between two rival entities may be understood as belonging to metaphysics. What can "identity," even "sexual identity," mean in a new theoretical and Signs</page><page sequence="22">34 Kristeva scientific space where the very notion of identity is challenged?29 I am not simply suggesting a very hypothetical bisexuality which, even if it existed, would only, in fact, be the aspiration toward the totality of one of the sexes and thus an effacing of difference. What I mean is, first of all, the demassification of the problematic of difference, which would imply, in a first phase, an apparent de-dramatization of the "fight to the death" between rival groups and thus between the sexes. And this not in the name of some reconciliation-feminism has at least had the merit of showing what is irreducible and even deadly in the social contract-but in order that the struggle, the implacable difference, the violence be conceived in the very place where it operates with the maximum intran- sigence, in other words, in personal and sexual identity itself, so as to make it disintegrate in its very nucleus. It necessarily follows that this involves risks not only for what we understand today as "personal equilibrium" but also for social equilib- rium itself, made up as it now is of the counterbalancing of aggressive and murderous forces massed in social, national, religious, and political groups. But is it not the insupportable situation of tension and explosive risk that the existing "equilibrium" presupposes which leads some of those who suffer from it to divest it of its economy, to detach themselves from it, and to seek another means of regulating difference? To restrict myself here to a personal level, as related to the ques- tion of women, I see arising, under the cover of a relative indifference toward the militance of the first and second generations, an attitude of retreat from sexism (male as well as female) and, gradually, from any kind of anthropomorphism. The fact that this might quickly become another form of spiritualism turning its back on social problems, or else a form of repression30 ready to support all status quos, should not hide the radicalness of the process. This process could be summarized as an interiorization of the founding separation of the sociosymbolic contract, as an introduction of its cutting edge into the very interior of every identity whether subjective, sexual, ideological, or so forth. This in such a way that the habitual and increasingly explicit attempt to fabricate a scapegoat victim as foundress of a society or a countersociety may be replaced by the analysis of the potentialities of victim/executioner which characterize each identity, each subject, each sex. What discourse, if not that of a religion, would be able to support this adventure which surfaces as a real possibility, after both the achievements and the impasses of the present ideological reworkings, in which feminism has participated? It seems to me that the role of what is usually called "aesthetic practices" must increase not only to counterbal- ance the storage and uniformity of information by present-day mass 29.

In order to bring out- along with the singularity of each person and, even more, along with the multiplicity of every person's possible identifications (with atoms, e.g., stretching from the family to the stars)-the relativity of his/her symbolic as well as biological existence, according to the variation in his /her specific symbolic capacities. And in order to emphasize the responsibility which all will immediately face of putting this fluidity into play against the threats of death which are unavoidable whenever an inside and an outside, a self and an other, one group and another, are constituted. At this level of interiorization with its social as well as individual stakes, what I have called "aesthetic practices" are undoubtedly nothing other than the modern reply to the eternal question of morality. At least, this is how we might understand an ethics which, conscious of the fact that its order is sacrificial, reserves part of the burden for each of its adherents, there- fore declaring them guilty while immediately affording them the possi- bility for jouissance, for various productions, for a life made up of both challenges and differences. Spinoza's question can be taken up again here: Are women subject to ethics? If not to that ethics defined by classical philosophy-in re- lationship to which the ups and downs of feminist generations seem dangerously precarious-are women not already participating in the rapid dismantling that our age is experiencing at various levels (from wars to drugs to artificial insemination) and which poses the demand for a new ethics? The answer to Spinoza's question can be affirmative only at the cost of considering feminism as but a moment in the thought of that anthropomorphic identity which currently blocks the horizon of the dis- cursive and scientific adventure of our species.
