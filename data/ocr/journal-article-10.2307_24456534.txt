<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHENOMENOLO0ICAL INTRODUCTION TO CATHOLIC MYSTICISM AUGUSTIN LEONARD (This is the concluding section of an article begun in the last issue.) I Τ IS IMPORTANT to limit the comprehension and the extension of the ambitious title which serves to introduce certain aspects that I am going to try to isolate in Catholic mysticism. This description is based principally on the study of St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross and the Venerable Marie of the Incarnation,83 all the results of which! cannot be included here. Our in quiry then is principally concerned with "modern" mysticism. Still I do not dare introduce this adjective into the title, because we are not certain that the characteristics found here may not be fundamental traits of all Catholic mys tical experience. Historians will have an easy time of marshaling objections at this point, but after all, one is forced to choose between discovering what things are, or what men have thought about them. My method may be equally disconcerting to theologians. They will be astonished to find me arriving with difficulty at conclusions which for them are primary evidences, such as the union between faith and mystical experience. This is because it remains im portant to arrive at such conclusions, if it is possible, by the light of obser vation alone. Phenomenology allows us to consider mystical experience for what it is, first of all as a fact84 charged with significance. It also allows us to undertake a dialogue with those who consider it from this point of view, perhaps without seeing all of its dimensions. In order to describe Christian mystical experience, we cannot, like Berg son, dissociate what he called the form and the! matter, the psychological mode of mystical knowledge and the! Christian realities which correspond to it. The two aspects of phenomena, subjective and objective, are complementary. There exists no "pure" mystical experience, which would be like a structure deprived of all content, an intention residing in a vacuum. It is God Whom mystical knowledge perceives immediately and experimentally in the historic revelation of Christ, the sacramental life and the ecclesiastical organism. Is it not contra dictory to unite indissolubly the immediacy of mystical knowledge to all the Christian "mediations"? Many think so, but my effort attempts precisely to remove this apparent contradiction. Mysticism and the New Testament I F CHRISTIAN MYSTICISM includes nothing except the intensity of faith and of charity engendered by the presence of the Spirit, then this is the very expression of New Testament spirituality. No difficulty appears until mysticism is given its strict meaning of the experimental attainment of God. It is in</page><page sequence="2">308 CROSS CURRENTS this latter case that it is important to see that Christian mysticism can in no way involve an abandonment of revelation.93 The problem, to speak the truth, can take on a number of aspects. It can involve the very persons of the Apos tles: were St. Paul or St. John mystics?96 Or does the teaching of the New Tes tament on Christian life offer us indications of mystical experience? Or again, in what way, in the course of history, have the mystics been conscious of their bond, at once doctrinal and "lived," with revelation? At first sight mysticism—intuition of the presence of God—which was the fruit of neo-Platonism, is opposed to primitive Christianity. Père Festugière stresses on the curtain of a pagan background "three original traits of Chris tianity." The first is the disinterested love of God which includes a negative attitude toward mystical graces.97 Charity indicates an aspiration altogether dif ferent and of another order than that of hellenistic religion toward a mys tical state. A second trait opposes love of neighbor, specified by the choice of the term agape for eros."8 A third trait finally underlines the importance of moral sanctity. The sense of sin and the call to the Saviour play their indis pensable role there. Undoubtedly, Festugière continues, Platonism and Plotinian ism are not entirely alien to the presentiments of a gift, of a grace granted to man. But in these systems the gift is required only to cross over the last threshold which leads to ecstasy, while in Christianity grace creates the first movement of direction toward salvation. The Greek mysteries also proposed a liberation, but it is a liberation from cosmic evil. Man liberated by the introduction within himself of the divine nous no longer has to concern him self about moral perfection.99 If one supposes for a moment that there is no opposition between mys ticism and the New Testament, but between the New Testament and a cer tain form of mysticism, the characteristics brought out by Père Festugière show how the content imbibed in Revelation proceeds to transform the experience of Christian mystics and to distinguish them from all others. The disinterested ness toward an experience which is never sought for itself, the bond with the ecclesial community, and the apostolic intention at the heart of contemplation itself, the criterion of sanctity measuring the authenticity of mystical commu nications: these traits will give to Christian mysticism a complexion like no other, because it reflects primitive Christianity. Without the influence of re velation, the global structure of its experience becomes inexplicable. It is still necessary to return to the central question: is mystical experience explicitly present in the New Testament? Père Alio does not hesitate to read in the mysterious wisdom of God which St. Paul attributes to the "perfect" (I Cor. 2, 6-7), in the prolongation of the common faith, "the first theological expression of all true Christian mysticism."100 As to the rapture of the Apostle (2 Cor. 12, 1-5), it transports us "into the area of the highest experience pos sible to mystical theology."101 Despite the more restrained interpretations of certain exegetes, the force of a tradition which includes, among others, St. Gregory of Nyssa,102 St. Augustine and St. Thomas,103 seems to me to have great weight. The difficulty resides rather in the exceptional character of Paul ine rapture. Such an experience cannot serve as a norm for a Christian mys tical experience.</page><page sequence="3">AUGUSTIN LEONARD 309 Besides, the question, as I have formulated it, is probably badly put and does not admit a precise answer, as if one could find experiences, such as those of St. John of the Cross, in the New Testament. But we should be able to discover there a fundamental and specifically Christian mystical "value" which will manifest itself analogically throughout history in very different contexts. In this sense the experimental contact with the divine mysteries re vealed in Christ, in which abides the essence of Christian mysticism, is not absent from the New Testament.104 The preponderance of agape—love descending from God—over gnosis is a central theme of Pauline theology which offers nothing contradictory to the Christian conception of a mysticism which is the experience of an infused love. Agape, besides, does not suppress gnosis, and in the diversity of experiences in which Pauline gnosis becomes involved, one finds the charisms of wisdom and of revelation granted to the spiritual man (1 Cor. 2, 14-15), and the con ception of a knowledge which adds to faith and to charity a surplus which is inseparable from them.105 In the texts of St. John, those of the First Epistle for example, the exper imental character of Christian life is so strongly marked,106 that it is without doubt impossible to determine precisely whether one is in the presence of a mystical or non-mystical experience. The New Testament knows no fine dis tinction between these two levels. But in the doctrine that it reveals and the experience that it describes, the role of a conscious contact with the divine mysteries as such is not left in shadow. If we consider Christian mysticism in itself, as an original creation, and not only as a continuation of Hellenistic mysticism, nor as an anticipation of idealistic metaphysics, we will easily per ceive the role played by the New Testament.107 In this sense the opposition placed by Albert Schweitzer between Pauline mysticism of being-in-Christ and the mysticism of God is revealing, if like Schweitzer in Gottesmystik we see a natural mysticism of immanence, such as is found in Spinoza, Schleiermaclier or Hegel.108 It is perfectly true in this case that not only Pauline mysticism, but all Christian mysticism, is "only a mysticism-of-Christ thanks to which man enters into a relationship with God."109 The mysticism-of-Christ is a partici pation in His death and His resurrection, which cannot be accomplished with out the intervention of the sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper, cele brated in the Church. Christian mystical knowledge will become from that time inseparable from a sacramental mysticism, without becoming entirely identified with it. This double character, Christological and sacramental, is found with the same intensity in St. Paul and in St. John.110 Ο CONCLUDE these necessarily brief observations, mystical knowledge appears in the New Testament only as enveloped in the context of Christian experience. But this takes on such eminent forms that they remain the vital norms and principles of all Christian mysticism. In the course of the ages the mystics revive realities which they have not invented, through a personal vision. A new synthesis, at once experimental and doctrinal, will be born; it will produce nothing absolutely new except the bringing to light of a measure of inexhaustible treasure. All the Christian mystics have been deeply conscious</page><page sequence="4">310 CROSS CURRENTS of being indebted to revelation for their experience. Besides, the synthesis of personal experience and of tradition is not an arbitrary assembling of disparate elements, but the spontaneous coincidence of the same path inevitably redis covered. When St. Bernard formulates the union to God, he is assimilating the doctrine and the experience of St. John's First Epistle.111 The central in tuition of St. Catherine of Genoa—God is love—directly joins together the Paul ine and Johannine agape.112 St. John of the Cross, on every page of his work, quite consciously borrows from Scripture the expression of his self-experienced doctrine: "In speaking of the dark night I will' rely neither on science nor on experience, for both of these can falter and lead us into error. But while not failing to make use of them as much as is possible, I will in everything call to my aid the divine protection, the Holy Scripture, at least in all that is most important and most difficult to understand. In following its light we cannot be deceived, since it is the Holy Spirit Himself who speaks there."113 It is the New Testament concept of a God of Love (1 John 4,9), which can be known only by one who possesses this charity as a divine gift (1 John 4, 7, 9, 13), which radically distinguishes Christian mysticism from an auton omous and purely speculative dialectic. It is not an intellectual intuition but a direct and immediate experience of perceived presence. This experience nevertheless possessess a "noetic value." But the knowledge which is involved here is obscure and confused in its essential range despite the transitory il luminations which often accompany it. It is a general affective knowledge which is less the contemplation of a truth than the experience of a reality obtained by a union of love. Properly speaking, it is a question not of the knowledge of a particular object but of communion with a subject, whence comes the intensely personal character of this experience. By reason of its psychological mode, located outside of the objective cate gories of evidence or of lack of evidence, and which depends on the very na ture of perceived reality, mystical experience cannot discover new truths which Revelation has not imparted.114 And so it is not proper to speak of a mystical philosophy in which Christian mystics would organize the results of their divine communications, as philosophers develop a system from a central in tuition. Doubtless the terms of mystical philosophy can have many meanings, but in Christianity they cannot have that of an authentic creation in the sphere of fundamental religious conceptions. An experience of love supposes a pre-existent subject which is its termination; it does not invent it. When someone writes of St. Teresa: "She discovers by herself, in some way recreates by her thought, the fundamental themes of the eternal philosophy which is at the basis of Christianity,"115 the experience of the saint is disfigured. In fact she recreates nothing. Her pretended philosophy is only Christian dogma. Still a mystical theology does exist. But its only function is to reunite per sonal experience to Revelation. The possibility of such systématisation is a sign that mysticism is detached neither from Revelation, nor, as we shall see, from faith. The theologian can develop his theory only if he has no doubt that the experience consists in the prolongation of the New Testament, and mysticism has a share in his intuition only to the extent that 'it manifests to him more intensely what he already knew as a Christian. Mystical theology, developed at times by men who have lived their doctrine, and based at the</page><page sequence="5">AUGUSTIN LEONARD 311 same time on Revelation and on experience, would be inconceivable, if these two terms were irreducibly opposed. To one who has read Scripture, the theologians, and the mystics without a preconceived system, no antithesis manifests itself between the prophetism of salvation through Christ in history and Christian mysticism, at least if the latter is properly understood, but on the contrary we find a coherence with out a flaw. If we do not arbitrarily and abstractly isolate these three moments of Christian experience, their organic union is apparent. Doctrine calls forth an experience, and then experience vitally appropriates the doctrine to itself and increases its value even to the point of playing a part in dogmatic develop ment.116 This complementarity is at the very least strong presumptive evidence that the Christian mystics are not Hellenes wandering^ far from the Cross, nor philosophers ignorant of the "God of Jesus Christ." Consideration of the Term of Christian mysticism will only serve to reinforce this presumption. The Personal Subject of Christian Mysticism D, ID THE CHRISTIAN MYSTICS, whether early or modern, seek to "by pass" Christ in order to reach a spiritual union with undifferentiated divinity? At first sight it might seem so. Mystical knowledge in fact, unless one refuses it its specific modality, manifests itself without images, the distinct forms or concepts of the discursive inference. With regard to the intellect, it supposes therefore a negation of all determinations. On the other hand, to this subjec tive indétermination there corresponds an objective indétermination. In the well-populated lineage of Pseudo-Dionysius at least, God is seized as "darkness," as "nothingness," in a cloud of unknowing.117 In this correlation, experienced by the whole being, between the infinite transcendence of God and the limita tions of all human instruments of knowledge, we are at the same time at the heart of Christian mysticism and at the point where misunderstandings are countless. To interpret the "cloud" of Pseudo-Dionysius, the "darkness" of An gela de Foligno, the "eternal nothingness" of Henry Suso, by the concept of a "God without mode" of any metaphysic, without recognizing there the God of Jesus Christ is to commit an enormous misunderstanding. Let us note first of all that "nocturnal mysticism" is a Biblical theme, since it is related to the cloud of Exodus and at times to the night of the Canticle of Canticles.118 Besides, after the true historic meaning of those abstract for mulas which are used by the Catholic mystics, divinity "without determined mode" is not the diffused principle of pantheism, but the personal God of Christianity whose transcendence lies beyond all human means of conception and of expression. Such, in any case, is the affirmation of Suso.119 In a very significant text Tauler explicitly refers the "secret darkness of good without determined mode" to the Holy Trinity: When these men return to their normal state they perceive all things in joy and perfection, as no one else can; this discernment is born in simple unity. So it is that they perceive with clarity and truth all the articles of pure faith. They perceive how the Father, Son and Holy Ghost</page><page sequence="6">312 CROSS CURRENTS are one only God, and every other truth of faith. No one understands true discernment better than those who arrive at Unity. One calls this, and the description is true, ineffable darkness, and y.et it is essential light. One also calls it a desolate desert beyond all expression. No one finds there the path or any other determined thing. It is beyond all mode.120 The obscurity of the object of mystical knowledge does not prevent it from being recognized. How are we to conceive of this simultaneous presence of night and of light? This is due first of all to the fact that the mystic in the general structure of his life never completely abandons distinct representations. Besides it seems that in thq wake of this experience of presence in obscurity, a content, which transcends ordinary consciousness as well as its habitual means of perception, comes to substitute itself in the emptiness of negation. The indétermination is instantaneously overcome by a positive and personal con tent: Christ, God, the Trinity. Here psychology is reduced to silence or else it can only accept the testimony of the mystics. For the living experience of negation and of the indétermination of distinct representations should logical ly end in unconsciousness. But with the Christian mystics it never does so.121 It is rather that a new consciousness is born, which is in no way the individual or collective unconscious, but a superconsciousness. A dwelling place, already built but until now shut up, is opened in, the mansion of the soul. An actually experienced apophasis, by reason of its very structure, is not only radically inconceivable without its organic connection with a cataphatic dogmatic, but besides it is itself a transformation of human darkness into divine light.122 And so the Darkness which is the "superessential Trinity" "burns with the most dazzling light in the midst of its blackest obscurity ... while remaining itself perfectly intangible and perfectly invisible, it fills with splen dors more beautiful than beauty the intelligences which know how to close the eyes."123 This instantaneous succession of light to darkness, or rather this presence of the Trinity in the Cloud, can be explained only by recourse to an experience located outside: of all purely speculative dialectics. There is rig orous correlation between the Subject-Object of mystical experience and die form which it necessarily takes: that of an obscure union brought about by infused love. It follows that a passivity, not only ontologie, but psychologically con scious, is another characteristic of Christian mysticism. This passivity certainly does not preclude a very active life on another plane, nor in the mystical order a dynamism, a tendency, a gift of self, an acquiescence. It is integrated in a religious life with multiple aspects which do not fail to require the ac tivity of the whole personality. It is extremely difficult to determine the exact influence of this passivity on the normal activity of the inclinations and the faculties. It is highly variable. At times it is partial, at other total. It can engage a single faculty or reduce them all to silence. Sometimes it is accom panied by ecstasy and sometimes not. As Penido so clearly saw, it can be "stim ulating" or "inhibiting." To the paradox of darkness—light, is added that of passivity—activity. For passivity too should result in unconsciousness. Leuba long since did not hesitate to propose this solution. Mysticism, according to him, falls in the unconscious and this emptiness of consciousness is combined with an "illusory illumination which is frequent enough in sleep, born of the</page><page sequence="7">AUGUSTIN LEONARD 313 exclusion of mental opposition, and of a feeling of freedom and of power."124 One is astonished that Delacroix finds in this clumsy interpretation "a great psychological finesse,"125 when he himself, on the authority of St. Teresa, thinks that eiven the rapture "does not resemble a trance, nor a sort of syn cope in which the soul abides without knowledge either exterior or interior."126 Delacroix judges, and justly so, that "the testimony of the mystics is in favor of a certain form of consciousness";127 in fact, "if this consciousness of interior feelings were to weaken or disappear, they would have nothing left with which to tell us that at last all consciousness had ended."128 Père Hugueny writes for his part: "The intensificaition of our knowledge of life raised up by the Holy Spirit even to the point of becoming a loving consciousness of the divine life within us, so absorbs our vital activity that the movement of our analytic knowl edge completely ceases. From then on we have no images and no particular ideas. Nevertheless we preserve in a general way the explicit idea of God. This is accompanied by the idea of living supported imaginatively by the minimum of euphoria, of sensible well-being, required by the ready expansion of our vital consciousness; if this minimum is suppressed, mystical prayer becomes impossible without the miracle of ecstasy." The author cites the case of a sick woman for whom all mystical prayer became impossible because of acute pain, and, he continues, "it can happen too that the soul no longer has any feeling except that of the goodness of the infinite Good which elates it to the point of not leaving it the liberty of taking consciousness of itself and of God as two distinct realities. This is the last degree of supernatural and mystical union."129 This complete fusion, even uniquely by virtue of psychological im pression, is questionable. St. John of the Cross,130 St. Teresa,181 Marie of the Incarnation,132 all explicitly reject it. Besides, the permanence of the personal consciousness becomes more marked in proportion as mysticism passes beyond accidental and secondary phenomena, such as visions, voices, and especially ecstasies, in order to arrive at transforming vision. Here the examples of in terior unification and mental concentration known in psychology have their defectiveness confirmed. In addition, the mystics have invented a terminology, such as the distinction between the soul and the spirit of the soul, between union with God in the depth and in the summit of the soul, which implies that the passivity of a conscious and permanent union with God in no way precludes spiritual and exterior activities.133 kNOTHER CHARACTERISTIC of mystical experience proceeds from the passivity to which allusion has just been made: its independence of voluntary effort. All the mystics are in agreement on this point; it is a grace, a "super natural" gift.134 And so Catholic mystics do not positively seek mystical knowl edge, even if they dispose themselves to it. No technique except contemplation, prayer and moral purity enters into their preparation. The abandoning ol discursive meditation and of the common processes of intellection is less sought after than imposed by an irresistible force. The personality, the passivity, the gratuity of Christian mysticism, all appear linked by an internal necessity, for these characteristics depend on the "unknowability" of a personal God who can be apprehended only if He man</page><page sequence="8">314 CROSS CURRENTS ifests Himself. The necessity of these properties is none the less if we consider the attachment of the mystics to the humanity of Christ. St. Teresa has strong ly insisted on the fact that one cannot, at any point in the mystic life, even after having received the highest divine communications of the sixth mansion, abandon the consideration of the mysteries of Christ incarnate. At one stage in her life, nevertheless, she fell into this "illusion," but soon repented. "En tirely to abandon the consideration of Christ, and to assimilate his divine body to our wretchedness, that I cannot endure."135 To consider the humanity of Christ as an obstacle to contemplation would imply a conscious and voluntary pursuit of mystical knowledge which is contradictory to the general attitude of Catholic mystics. Mystical experience is not the fruit of a direct and sys tematic eifort, but is a gratuitous gift of God. The end which is sought is the perfection of love and not, as in other mystics, a mysterious path to trans cendental knowledge. As a result, "to follow a method which teaches one to flee the remembrance of Jesus Christ in order to reach a higher contemplation is to deceive oneself in the attitude which must be taken toward mystical prayer."136 It is nevertheless true that the sensible recollection of the, humanity of Christ may be taken away: "When God wishes to suspend the powers of the soul... it is clear that, even when we would not wish it, the presence of the sanctified Humanity is taken from us. It is reft from us then, and in good time. But that we of ourselves would exert our ability and our care... to avoid ... having the sanctified Humanity always present... that, I repeat, ap pears inadmissible to me."137 Even when the mystics have been transported to an imageless contemplation, they do not abandon the Person of Christ, but they discover it again in His divinity, for there is no other road to this ex perience except through Christ.138 This road is not one to be travelled over and left behind, but a road which is life! and truth. St. John of the Cross, even if "negative," on thiis point shares the opinion of St. Teresa, without its being necessary to take into consideration the ex planations interpolated in certain manuscripts.139 J. Baruzi frequently calls attention to this christological aspect;180 although at times he somehow distorts it.141 Marie of the Incarnation admirably expresses the permanence of the at tachment to the Incarnate Word, when the sensible representation of the hu manity has momentarily disappeared. She then contemplates the God-man and not the Man-God: "I thought on Jesus, not in His humanity, Our Lord having taken from me this method of prayer, but in his divinity."142 From all the evidence, there is no question here of "bypassing" Christ. When one encounters the texts in which orthodox mystics seem to neglect everything except the indeterminate darkness, let him also read those texts in which the darkness expresses negatively a positive personal contact, without forgetting that the personality of the God of Jesus Christ has nothing in common with anthropomorphic divinities. Furthermore, these texts put back in their context should be interpreted in the light of the entire mystical life of the subject. What cannot be drawn from the exclamation of St. Angela of Foligno?: "Ah, speak to me not of the Gospel, nor of the sight of Jesus Christ, nor of any divine word. All of that would no longer seem important to me. I see greater grandeurs in God."143 Yet the person of Christ is for St. Angela "the book of life, to know the life and death of the crucified Man-God."144</page><page sequence="9">AUGUSTIN LEONARD 315 The passion of Christ is a, central theme of her mystical life. She experiences this feeling145 ("I felt that it was I who had crucified Him") and hears this word ("It is not in jest that I have loved you"). The result is a; sort of alter native between different aspects of the same subject. The life of the "All Good" is in no way opposed to the "Cross of Christ." Sometimes the two planes seem strangely simultaneous: "Often I dwell at once on several steps of the ladder; I desire to see this flesh which has died for us and to come to it."148 "Once, the recollection of the precious blood, of the inestimable blood with which sal vation flowed over the world, fused with the wordless and higher love. I was astonished, I remember, to see these loves existing together at the same mo ment; but pain was completely absent. The passion is now for me only a guiding light." At other times the recollection of the Humanity either precedes or follows the absorption in darkness, or else the content of the darkness is iden tified with the Person of Christ. "Emerging from the darkness I begin to see the Man-God again... I see His eyes, I see His merciful face... What pro ceeds from His eyes and His face is the good that one sees in the dark night."14T The testimony on the permanence of the relationship to Christ and of the personality of the object of Christian mysticism could be multiplied without end. The mysticsi are "imitators and original but incomplete commentators of what the Christ of the Gospels was in all completeness."148 Phenomenologically this conclusion imposes itself. Theologically it takes all its dimensions, while showing, not only in fact but in reason, the interior ontological bond which unites the dogmatic content of the Trinity and of the Incarnation to thq form of the experience which it arouses. The mystics themselves never suppose that the unity which ties their experience to its Subject is accidental. If they had experienced only the "consciousness of the self by the self," or the "I which expands itself," according to the formulas of J. Baruzi, how are we to explain the fact that personalities so different, always "expand themselves" in the same direction, always preserving the same données, according to an itinerary which, for being very varied, is none the less substantially identical to its larger as pects. The opposition of Bergson to conceptualism has not permitted him to deduce from this fact, the extreme importance of which he had discovered, its obvious consequence: the indissoluble and complementary connection of doctrine and experience. The personal Terminus of Christian mysticism expressing itself always in the dogmas of the Trinity and the Incarnation149 supposes a connection be tween faith, which welcomes these fact-truths of Revelation without seeing them, and mysticism, which sees them no more, but experiences them. Faith is a bivalent structure in which the objective formulation is already integrated to an existential attitude. The frequently drawn antithesis between "dogmatic faith" and "mystical faith" does not take count of the experience which is at the heart of faith itself. The problem therefore is not to discern the continuity between purely notional religious conceptualism—dogmatism in a diminished sense—and a "pure" mysticism of an exclusively psychological essence, but that which prevails between the complex structure of faith and the equally complex structure of mystical knowledge. The knowledge of faith includes a religious experience psychologically bound to the notional presentation of its Terminus. Mystical knowledge admits of "a communion on a plane which is no longer</page><page sequence="10">316 CROSS CURRENTS notional."150 This knowledge does not "bypass" the stage of faith, "but the stage in which the concepts of faith appear to the believer himself to measure the reality and the energy of faith."151 The psychological discontinuity which intervenes, in neither mode of experience in any way prevents the soul from uniting in a different manner with the "known and beloved substance"152 which underlines the conceptual formulas. On this bond between faith and mystical experience the testimony of St. John of the Cross is particularly significant.153 But is this bond accidental or essential? Is it simply the result of a naive or clumsy submission to an external authority, as J. Baruzi gives us to understand?154 Could it be that the mystics yield to an exterior pressure in order to identify realities which are either completely heterogeneous or are united in a contingent way, as a myth is re lated to a philosophic truth? Here again mystical theology should be taken into consideration much more than it usually is. Even looked at from the outside, the cohesion among scriptural sources, evolved theology and the tes timony of experience is something altogether different from a fortuitous phe nomenon or a sociological fact: it is the result of a social tradition. The op position continually encountered between dogmatic facts and mystical experi ments indicates nevertheless a real psychological difficulty which is different from that presented by faith. How can distinct representations continue to play a role in an experience from which they are believed to be radically ab sent? Thus one frequently resolves the question by the dualism of an obscure God, easily reconcilable with pantheism and idealism, and a clear or mytho logical God accepted as a presupposition of Christian tradition—the bond be tween these two divinities, the one as improbable as the other, purely arbitrary. In an idealistic perspective it is in fact very difficult to understand how an ob jective experience, which is not entirely reducible to pure thought although it may be spiritual, can unite itself to conceptual determinations. It would be necessary for all to take place in, the interior of thought without any previous idea. And so mystical experience will be conceived as a consciousness of self expressing itself in a creative activity of thought, in a pure symbolism. But nothing obliges us to accept such a point of view. On the contrary, a more attentive observation of the facts reveals in the psychology of knowledge a law which will find applications even in mystical experience; form is not separable from matter.155 An intellectual formulation supposes an experience, and the experience requires such a formulation in order to express itself. The difficulty disappears if one does not abstractly separate mystical knowledge from the com plexity of designs and of structures to which the human consciousness, and still more the religious consciousness, gives life. It is also necessary to note, after we have set aside the case of ecstasy which is accidental and despite the opinion of many psychologists does not represent the essence of mysticism, that the persistence of representations in mystical experience remains important. At least in the sense that this experience, by its very nature, demands preliminary knowledge of another kind bearing on the same object. There can be, in fact, almost instantaneous passing from the knowledge of faith in quite distinct truths to mystical knowledge properly so called. The latter thus takes its point of departure in common notions and</page><page sequence="11">AUGUSTIN LEONARD 317 immediately returns to them. In terms o£ the mystical journey, because of the spirituality of this state, the habitual union and the distinct apprehensions will be simultaneous. In this case it would be strange indeed if mystics, so endowed for interior observation, did not perceive that they were reconciling realities which were alien to one another. As for imagining that mystical knowl edge is an unconsciousness, a void, or a pathological "monodeism," composed, so to speak, of an "isolated image accompanied by a unique emotion,'^"—this is radically impossible. The "psychology of form" would allow us perhaps to conceive, at least hypothetically, how the dogmatic statement can remain present in the exper ience without becoming fully explicit there. This theory recognizes the per sistence of certain intellectual forms, when the distinct content of thought is absent. This phenomenon is produced, for example, when we try to recall an idea or a name which we cannot formulate at the moment, but nevertheless can feel its presence. The "form" is there but it is/ not efxplicit at the moment. However different the psychological hypotheses may be, the synthesis brought about by mysticism itself suffices to show that the fusion between the dogmatic formulation and the mystical experience is not only the product of an ex terior social pressure but that it has its root in the experience itself. R. Bas tide justly writes: Mystical intuition in its highest form cannot be a pure feeling which, after the return to normal life, the mystic would justify with the help of a rational doctrine juxtaposed. He knows very well that there is a bond, a communion between his intuition and this doctrine, a certain natural relationship. The proof of this is that it is important what doctrine ap pears to him to adapt itself to this intuition. The latter is not a confused and passive sensibility which lets itself give form to the first theology it meets. It has a true activity. It feels repugnance for certain concepts, it has an affinity for others. It attracts some, it rejects others.158 Nevertheless, mystical knowledge as such is "immanent to the affective ex perience and irreducible to a representation."159 This is precisely the reason why it is inconceivable without an organic bond with objective knowl edge of itself, and absolutely speaking, is incapable of furnishing new "objects." Marie of the Incarnation expresses this idea wonderfully, à propos of the mys tery of the Incarnation which was discovered to her, she writes, "in a way that I had never conceived. It is true that since then I have read something comparable but whatever I could have read, it would not approach the effect produced and impressed by a visit from God. Still it ijs a great consolation to find that one's experiences are in conformity to the faith of the Church and the opinions of the learned."160 M -YSTICAL EXPERIENCE, by its very mode, is ineffable. Properly speak ing it is not a source of knowledge, unless there enters a new element, distinct from mystical experience, which is prophetic revelation. This alone allows of the manifestation of a new object: an event or a truth. Mystical experience, on the contrary, is a; union of love in the order of deepening and not of dis covering. It meets again on a different path an object which is already known.161 It passes beyond distinct apprehensions but it remains united to them. Be</page><page sequence="12">318 CROSS CURRENTS sides, it never expresses itself except in ordinary concretes. And this knowl edge of faith and of doctrine judges the experience, and not the reverse. Even so mystical experience preserves its characteristic expression. On the plane of language it causes a radiance to glow in ordinary concepts, or even a heighten ing of value which is far more than an ornament. Besides it also engenders symbols which try to express the inexpressible, or it makes use of existing symbols, notably and by preference those of the Bible. That is why mystical experience will willingly use allegorical exegesis but without confining itself there. The symbols express metaphysical states which clear ideas could not re flect. They are at the same time affected by a personal sign and by an ob jective intentionality which refers them to the reality symbolized. They are the metaphorically analogical reduction of a subjective reality and of an ob jective reality. They procure at last a true knowledge. When St. John of the Cross exclaims "O living flame of love," when Mariei of the Incarnation con templates God "as a great sea which admits no impurity," these resplendent images teach us something and bring us into communication with a region to which we would not have access by ourselves.162 To suggest an intensely per sonal experience, and, even more, one which is an experience of incommu nicable transcendence, symbolic knowledge 16 indispensable. But it would be vain to wish to encumber it with the whole religious universe, whether to produce it or to express it. Neither mysticism nor symbolic knowledge is any more the unique source of religion than it is its only expression. Symbolic knowledge on its own plane, and mysticism, as well, presume an intellectual knowledge—an exact comprehension of symbolic knowledge.163 J. Baruzi very justly writes that mystical knowledge, for exterior witnesses, is extraordinarily deficient.164 The difficulty of understanding the complementary character of symbol and of concept appears here only in an idealist perspective. If, in fact, one denies to reality and to God an existence in themselves, the symbol loses its representative function in order to substitute itself for reality. Exterior reality becomes symbol, and symbol becomes the only reality. In an idealist view the symbol acquires an autonomous value; in a realist view it remains yoked to the reality symbolized. And so J. Baruzi, in some penetrating pages of great subtlety of thought, seeks to discover in St. John of the Cross a pure "symbolic experience." But then the symbols of fire and of night would no longer express the drama of the encounter between God and the soul. An ab solute solipsism would be substituted for it. Self-contemplating intelligence feels no need of giving objectivity to the\ symbol. The symbol would subsist of itself, as an act of thought comprehending itself, outside dialectical multiplicity in the ultimate depth to which it can attain.165 But the Christian mystic does not allow us this interpretation, for unlike the philosopher and the aesthetician, he "objectifies his own creations."166 Apart from symbols, whose value is more suggestive than noetic, the lan guage of the mystic always rediscovers the truths of the common patrimony; far from transmitting a pretended mystical philosophy, it reproduces Christian tradition. The language of mysticism also furnishes a new indication of the continuity between doctrine and experience. If the mystics are not the mes sengers of any revelation, their texts, especially if they are not didactic but rooted in experience, are nevertheless impregnated with radiance which inte</page><page sequence="13">AUGUSTIN LEONARD 31 ? riorly illuminates the ordinary teaching. Their expressions diffuse a light, they are charged with a communicative value, they launch an appeal. We perceive in them the softened jolt of the experience itself. Literary beauty or poetic magic does not altogether explain this expansive characteristic of mystical lan guage.167 When, in a text, the statement of a traditional truth is illumined with the refulgence refracted by an experimental contact, this is not a sign that the dogmatic ideas transmitted by tradition permit the intelligence to achieve by its own means the subject to which personal love is united. Bré mond says of Marie of the Incarnation: Become again like one of us, a theologian more or less expert, the con cepts and terms which she uses evoke in her, not only as in us their proper object—a construction of the mind—but, although very confusedly, the very reality of the three Persons, even the recollection of their presence in the most remote places of her soul. She reconciles, she fuses, unknown to herself, the two orders, ecstasy and study, contemplation and knowl edge.168 Let us recapitulate. The subjective and objective indétermination of mys tical experience is explained, under pain of being an unconsciousness, only by a positive content. This content is referred to the dogmas of the Trinity and the Incarnation which give to Christian mysticism its personal character. From the reference to dogmas arises the question of the essential or accidental bond between dogmatic faith and mystical experience. A series of implications between experience and idea indicate, even at the level of phenomenology, that this bond is not accidental, nor the fruit of a presumption. If one abstracts the mystical experience from the dogmatic statements in which it is cast, one dis figures it, empties it of its historic significance and deprives it even of its psy chological specificity. Some final remarks on pantheism will serve, by way of verification, to underline the personal character of Christian mysticism. The Exclusion of Pantheism . HE ACCUSATION OF PANTHEISM is actually what Protestant critics most willingly direct against Catholic mysticism.169 There is nothing more un founded. The very idea of a pantheistic Christian mysticism is contradictory. Furthermore it is precisely alleged that the mystics are not Christians, they are the heirs of Greece and the East, and the promoters of a deviating syn cretism. But in this case it must still be explained how this amalgam of ir reducible notions is intelligible. In fact, as Gilson strongly states: "Wherever there is a trace, however slight, of pantheism, the problem of Christian mys ticism ceases to present itself."170 The consciousness of the gulf which separates Uncreated Being from the creature, the still more immeasurable distance which exiles the sinner far from the Absolute Sanctity, are marks of Christian mys ticism. The necessity of a grace, of a benevolent inclination of God which over comes this deviation, proceeds immediately from these marks. This character istic is absent from oriental mysticism where grace does not play the same role as in Christian mysticism.171 Grace in the Christian perspective presupposes a mediator because of sin. The idea of salvation and of the Saviour is found neither in the mysticism of Plotinus nor in the hermetic writings.172 Even if one discovers a divine transcendence in Plotinus, it is obscured by the idea</page><page sequence="14">320 CROSS CURRENTS of a necessary emanation. If one refuses to see in Plotinism an emanative pan theism,173 it is at least certain that the One is more a state than a person.171 Christian mysticism differs equally from mystico-metapliysical speculation in which the Christian reality is sacrificed to a philosophic speculation which in fact gives metaphysics precedence over contemplation, and this even in the order of the sacred mysteries—an error already present in Boehme, ex pressed very clearly by Valentin Weigel—to regard the knowledge of the Trinity of Persons as a knowledge of God which is external and with reference to creatures, while the knowledge of the One and of Oneness penetrates the intimacy of the Deity.173 This error was perhaps also shared by Eckhart. In the face of these dialectics, the mystical purifications take their pre cise significance. There is here no question of a simply intellectual ascesis, or of the transcending of sensible reality comparable to illusion. "For the Christian mystic the problem is no longer of the metaphysical order or of the cosmic, but it is religious. It is not a question of a philosophic exploit, or of a deliverance worked by his own means."176 In contrast with every escape into intemporality, the role of redemptive suffering in the life of the mystics does not admit of any misunderstanding. If their experience renders eternity present in time, it is not like the wise men by closing their eyes to the his toric human condition, but by reproducing the rhythm of death to sin and of resurrection to the divinized life, of which St. Paul formulated the law necessary in an historically fallen world. This appearance of a new state of existence, "being in Christ" substituted for "being in the flesh," is not only a chronological union but, so to speak, a physical union with the historic mys tery of Jesus. There is in Christian mysticism no approach to eternity which would be independent of a participation in the Passion of Christ. From the unsurpassed expressions of St. Paul, through the martyrs, to the mystics, and precisely the most modern of these,177 the experience not only unfolds itself in the shadow of the Cross, but is a mysterious reproduction of it. I am glad of my sufferings on your behalf, as, in this mortal frame of mine, I help to pay off the debt which the afflictions of Christ still leave to be paid, for the sake of his body, the Church (Col., 1, 24) ; we carry about continually in our bodies the dying state of Jesus, so that the living poiuer of Jesus may be mani fested in our bodies too (2 Cor., 4, 10) ; the sufferings of Christ abound in us (2 Cor., 1, 5) ; / am crucified with Christ (Gal., 2, 20) ; those who belong to Christ, have crucified nature, with all its passions, all its impulses (Gal., 5, 24) ; God forbid that I should make a display of anything, except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world stands crucified to me, and I to the world (Gal., 6, 14). These texts meet with the Gospel precept about taking up the cross and losing one's life (Luke, 9, 23-24; Mark, 8, 34-35; Matt., 16, 24-25; John, 12, 25), which was to arouse the martyrs; St. Cyprian, moreover, calls it evangelium Christi unde martyres fiu-nt.178 The passion of the martyr, in fact, is not only a fidelity carried to the level of heroism, but is also the mani festation of the presence of the Crucified. The fidelity is possible only through this presence; it is at the same time its result and its testimony. The deacon Stephen "his face like the face of an angel" (Acts, 6, 15), filled with the Holy Spirit, sees the Son of Man and falls while calling on Christ (Acts, 7, 55-60). Ignatius of Antioch, although he "can contemplate the things of heaven and</page><page sequence="15">AUGUSTIN LEONARD 321 the hierarchies of angels" (Trallians, 5, 2), prays that he be permitted to "imitate the passion of his God": "my passions have been crucified, and there is in me no more fire for the matter; there is only a living water, which mur murs in me, and which from the depth of my heart, says: Come to the Father" (Rom., 5-8). Perpétua won the right of "talking with the Lord." When her keeper said to Félicita, who cried out in the pangs of childbirth: "You groan now; what will you do when you face the beasts?", she replied: "Now it is I who suffer; but then another will be in me who will suffer for me, because I too will suffer for him."179 The martyr bears witness of a mystical presence of the suffering Christ,180 a presence felt, conscious, which at times shines visible as on thei face of Stephen. The purifications of the mystics have no other final significance; they too are the continuation of the Passion and the witness rendered to the Church and for the Church of the perpetuity of this mystery. No more than the martyr is the mystic charged with a doctrinal mission, but like him he suffers and gives testimony. Beyond the profound moral significance, and that of the sanctity which accompanies all authentic mysticism, the purifying sufferings have a properly mystical meaning of union with Christ and with the Church. Is one to seek in them to transcend time and history and the salvific inter ventions of God who manifests Himself therein? Current ideas on the "acos micism" of Christian mystics, or their religious individualism, on their pan theistic tendencies, stem from a superficial consideration which is contradicted by mystical tradition from St. Paul to our own time. Far from being the search, here and now, for a state of beatitude which would permit the escape from the weight of time which brings evil and death, Christian mysticism is the most profound experience of the anguish of the world, even that of the agonized and dying Christ. Doubtless mysticism anticipates beatitude. The soul is often invaded by an inexpressible joy, but this is not separated from grief when it is not actually the paradoxical efflorescence of grief. The same divine pre sence, experimentally perceived, sometimes brings suffering and sometimes de light. Even in the passive weight of the spirit, where the soul at times seems on the threshold of despair, abandoned by God, the perception of the presence of God remains. The most rudimentary human psychology is no stranger to this astonishing mixture. St. Teresa compares the mystical union to the mu tual presence of two persons in a dark chamber. But two people who love one another and wish to unite, are perhaps never so intensely present to one another as in the suffering which they inflict upon one another in perceiving a psychological disaccord between themselves. A remote analogy! The purify ing and redeeming pain which, is at the heart of the dark night is caused by the perception of the "double abyss" of St. Angela of Foligno: the gulf of nature and the gulf of holiness which separates man fmm God. But it is less a disappearance of the presence than of the joy brought by it. Or better, it is an effect of the immediate perception of God. The nights constitute an ex perience parallel to the luminous experiences which are sometimes encounter ed there, in so far as the simultaneity of the two kinds of experience is pos sible.181 Marie of the Incarnation knew such nights, after she attained the transforming union in which the experience of the presence of God is habitual. In the seventh state of prayer, according to her purely personal nomenclature,</page><page sequence="16">322 CROSS CURRENTS she speaks of her "deep-seated and permanent state," and years later she speaks of nights in the twelfth state: In this purgatory one does not lose sight of the holy Incarnate Word, but He who until then had appeared only as love and who formerly con sumed the soul in His divine embraces, is the very same who now cru cifies it and, penetrating it in all its parts, divides it away from the spirit except in its depth, where is the dwelling place and the seat of God, which in state appears as an abyss and a separated place.182 The union with the Incarnate Word does not require only a dialectic and theoretic purification of the spirit, such as would permit, through the aban donment of the sensible and of time, the reunion with a cosmic God or a God of love, some more and more ethereal philosophic abstraction. This union arouses terrible sufferings which are a diminished repetition of the Passion, and which are as transcendent of ordinary consciousness as any other element of mystical experience. In this experimental identification with Christ crucified, at the heart of this night which is nevertheless blessed, the air of the true mystic takes its form. Conclusion .HAT CHRISTIAN MYSTICAL KNOWLEDGE is bound in fact (as mys tical theology shows that it ought to be) to a complex of doctrines and in stitutions: Revelation, the Blessed Sacrament, the Church, can hardly be denied. Why then abstract from this organic structure a form of psychological exper ience which loses, in this separated state, all its properties, and offers for study only the consideration of a phantom indifferently dressed in some philo sophic cast-offs? The preceding pages have tried to show that Christian mys ticism is unintelligible when it is arbitrarily isolated from the foundations which sustain it and from which it takes its impetus. Such a work might well cover several volumes, and said in a few pages it is necessarily incomplete, since it confronts on the one hand the whole domain of the Christian uni verse where dogma and mysticism, doctrine and experience answer one another, and on the other hand the different methods, theological, philosophical, phe nomenal, which must be brought into play to determine exactly the relation ship between mysticism and its doctrinal and institutional foundations. We are limited here to a question of fact. Yes or no—to understand what a mystic says should we take count of the Biblical revelation to which he is attached, the dogmas which he believes and experiences, the sacraments he receives, the sanctity for which he strives, the Church to whose interior formation he con tributes by his sufferings and to which he; submits? To this question, even in our rapid summary, we can reply affirmatively. As a consequence, the cor rect positing of the problem of mystical experience requires an appropriate method. To understand the Christian mystical fact, it is necessary to take it as a whole. Although essentially it admits of a particular psychological mode, it is not constituted only by an unusual form of experience, more or less close analogies to which one could find in diverse religions, in philosophy or in aesthetics, but also by a content. In reacting on the experience, this content forms with it a "type" structure, for which there is no equivalent.</page><page sequence="17">AUGUSTIN LEONARD 323 However impoverished may be its results, phenomenology permits us to recognize the complex specificity of Christian mysticism. It separates from it many unilateral or belittling interpretations. Perhaps it can even give the foreshadowing of its resplendent grandeur. Translated by ERWIN V. GEISSMAN Translated by ERWIN Ψ. GEISSMAN 93 This is the Ursuline missionary in Canada (Oct. 28, 1599-April 30, 1672) and not Madame Acarie (1365-1618) who under the same name took the habit of a lay sister among the earliest reformed Carmelites in France. 94 "Whatever at bottom the proper judgment of mysticism may be, it is necessary to recognize in fact the psychological existence of states characterized, interconnected, multiply experienced, which admit of being classed systematically, grouped, and appreciated. And what seems proper to these states is on the one hand the depreciation, and as it were effacing, of the sensible symbols and of the ideas of abstract and discursive thought; and on the other hand it is the direct contact and immediacy of the spirit with reality possessed in itself. Mysticism gives the impression of having not less, but more knowledge and light. This fact, which is a historic reality, should not be misunderstood." A. Lalane, "Mysticisme," in Vocabulaire technique et critique de la philosophie, 5 th edition, Paris, 1947. 95 Even Delacroix, who separates experience and doctrine, admits that the mystics "remain Cath olics in this succession of confused states which escape from Christianity into the religious indéter mination of pure mysticity." 96 In the sense in which Père Pourrat understands it: "The expressions so strong, almost as tonishing, which St. Paul uses to express his union with Jesus remind us of the mystical union' with which a large number of saints were favored. Paul in fact is a great mystic, taking the word in the classic sense of St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross, and the Catholic theologians." La Spiritualité chrétiennet I, "Des origines de l'Eglise au Moyen-Age»" 5 th edition, Paris, 1921. p. 47. 97 "If one defines the fundamental mystical state as the intuition of the presence of Gody one can say that the* Christian religion, at least on earth, does not tend essentially to the obtaining of this state: it tends essentially to the progress of love. It would tend essentially to the! depths of the mystic state only if it were proved that this state is indispensable to the progress of love, or in other words, were it impossible to advance in the love of God unless one has known God with an immediate knowledge." Mystique païenne et charité, in L'Enfant d'Agrigente, Paris, 1950, p. 128. If he strongly insists on the Platonic and neo-Platonic influence, Père Festugière still does not deny the existence of a specifically Christian mysticism, nor the legitimacy of this way to God. He especially rejects, like a number of historians and theologians, that mystical experience be identified with Christian perfection, so that sanctity woulcf be inconceivable where it was absent. The spirituality of numerous Fathers who have lived or discussed mysticism "is not anti-Christian, and it would surely be excessive to oppose it to the specifically Christian tradition." It is wrong therefore to liken, as Père Bouyer has done (op. cit., p. 6) this position to that of Harnack or other Protestant theologians. See Ascèse et contemplation, ibid,, pp. 141ff.; 186, n. 6. 98 Anders Nygren has found in this opposition, extended to the dimension of a system, a new example of the antithesis between mysticism and revealed religion. The* communion of agape descending from God is incompatible with the ascending dialectic of erôs. "All that truly constitutes mysticism is inscribed under the sign of erôs. Its principal end is to indicate the way of man towards God. This signifies that man works his own salvation, by raising himself towards the divine. Erôs develops accord ing to a line stemming from neo-Platonism and Alexandrine theology, passing through Dionysius the Areopagite and partially through Augustine, through Scotus Erigena and the mysticism of the Middle Ages, and ending in German idealism and the speculative post-Kantian systems." Erôs et Agapè. La notion chrétienne de l'amour et ses transformations, Paris, 1944. p. 247. 99 The illusory exemption from sin· or moral indifference is one of the permanent traits of false mysticism, which reappears endlessly in the course of history and against which authentic mystics ceaselessly react. So Suso, in the "Livret de la vérité" (L'oeuvre mystique d'Henri Suso, Paris, 1946, III, 24), or Ruysbroeck in "Le miroir du salut éternel" (Oeuvres, 3rd edition, Brussels, 1937, I, 116). Many authors, without taking account of this radical difference, do not hesitate to present quietism as a form, if not a model, of Christian mysticism, and Madame Guyon as a competitor of St. Teresa. The truth is far otherwise. The mystical enthusiast who denies all mediations in order to abandon himself without control to interior communion with the divine, the evangelical enthusiast whom the divine light dispenses from ordinary rules, in abandoning moral responsibility, depart from the Christian tradition. See R. Knox, Enthusiasm, Oxford, 1950, pp. 581 ff. 100 Ε. B. Alio, lie Epitre auà Corinthiens, Paris, 1934, p. 115. 101 Ε. B. Alio, lie Epitre aux Corinthiens, Paris, 1937, p. 307. 102 In Cantic. Homil. 5, P. G., 44 860B. 103 St. Thomas, Ila-IIae, q.' 180, art. 5. 194 For St. Paul, writes L. Cerfaux, "the life in Christ is engaged in mystical experience, and this in various ways." La théologie de l'Eglise suivant saint Paul. Paris. 1942. p. 177. Père Huby for his part writes of St. John and St. Paul: "Their attention w*s turned toward that which makes the essence of Christian life, its ontological reality, the conditions of its birth and development. They</page><page sequence="18">324 CROSS CURRENTS were not disposed to describe privileged states nor to construct a theory of them. Still, that life in Christ which is made known to us in its essential traits, is reflected, is engaged, in more or less elevated experiences. One will find in them, therefore, beyond the fundamental teachings on the Christian tradition, indications on its experimental side which will open the way to mystical theology." Mystiques paulinienne et johtrnnique, Bruges-Paris, 1946, pp. 8-9. 105 In certain texts (Phil., I, 9; Col., 1, 9): "The idea of growth in knowledge in no way implies a mystical notion of it. The knowledge being religious adherence, it increases in the} measure that our adherence takes on reality in our life and our conduct. What holds true for the knowledge of this will is equally verified for the knowledge of God; its increase is realized' by a moral progress. (J. Dupont, Gnosis, p. 43). On the other hand, the texts on illumination of heart (2 Cor., 4, 6; Eph.s 1, 17-18) suppose, according to the same exegesis, knowledge of a superior order, a consummation of religious knowledge. It is perhaps not necessary to banish too radically all Hellenistic influence. Finally, through all the meaning which the term gnosis takes, it tends "to become a knowledge obtained through immediate revelations and bearing on the salvation which must be realized at the end of time." (Ibid., p. 532). In Galatians. 2. 20: It is no longer I who live, it is Christ who lives in me; in Philippians 3, 7-14, where Paul scorns all his hereditary advantages because of the superiority of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, in order to be found in him, Bultmann sees the mystical idea of union with divinity, but this union is determined, which we have no difficulty* in admitting, by union in the redemption of Christ and in faith/ "Mystik," in Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, IV, c. 342. 106 "jt js not a vision; it is a knowledge of love lived in faith. And yet this sort of profound intuition, this transluminous experience, this concrete perception of our life in God—all this is so clear that truly we Christians know that wè are in God and God in us." J. Mouroux, "L'expérience» chrétienne dans la Ire épitre de Saint Jean," in La Vie Spirituelle, LXXVIII (1948), pp. 381-412 (see p. 410&gt;. 107 "The dominant tendencies of Catholic mysticism are the same at the origins, in the Middle Ages, in modern times: the direction of the whole has hardly varied." H. Delacroix, Les grands mystiques chrétiens, ρ/ il 11., 108 Albert Schweitzer, it seems to me, seeks everywhere to place in relief the specificity of Christian mysticism, but does not dream of denying that in Christ the believer possesses filiation with God, that the spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God. Interpreted in this way, Schweitzer's thesis admirably sets off a permanent trait of Christian mysticism, which, following St. Paul, "does not conceive filiation with God as an immediate mystical relationship with God but as mediatized and realized thanks to the mystical union of Christ." Die Mystik des Apostles Paulus, Tubingen, 1930, p. 3. In the same way one can accept without reservation the contrast between the natural immanence of being-in-God, conceived pantheistically, and the transcendence of God, or rather that which divides a natural or supernatural conception of history. 109 "jn paul no God-mysticism is given, but only a Christ-mysticism, through which man enters into a relationship with God." Ibid., p. 3. 11° I can only mention these points, each one of which would call for its own study, but I will try to show in what perspective every study of Christian mysticism should be placed, notably in dependence on the New Testament. Schweitzer accords to thej sacraments all the lustre that they have in Pauline mysticism, (op. cit., pp. 18 ff.; Ch. IX, "Mystik und Sacramente"), although his eschatologism prevents him from finding there an actual participation in eternal life. Cullman shows the importance of the sacraments in St. John and insists on the reality of the presence of Christ. (Les sacrements dans l'Evangile johannique, Paris, 1951, p. 82). This, in my opinion, allows us to conceive a sacramental mysticism. The mystic theology of Dom Casel, despite the undeniable! historical and theological difficulties with which it is encumbered (J. Cools. "La présence mystique du Christ dans le baptême, in the Memorial Lagrange, Paris, 1940, pp. 195-305), recalls its richness. Even if one admits at the heart of the mystery of the liturgy a mystical presence of Christ, which arouses in the faithful a properly mystical participation in the sacred action, there is nevertheless no reason to limit Christian mysticism to cult, nor to oppose to it, at least· in theory, the "quietist introspec tion" of modern mysticism (O. Casel, Le mystère du culte dans le christianisme, Paris, 1946, pp. 103 ff). If Christian mystical knowledge normally appears thanks to the sacrament, if it is developed in cult, if it can also find there, as experience testifies in the case of the Eucharist, its most intense moments, nevertheless neither sacrament nor cult limits its horizon. To wish! to enclose all mysticism in cult—and the same remark applies to the reading of the Bible—one would not only misunderstand the specific originality of mysticism, but one would transform into frontiers the paths which open up toward the depths of God. Christian mysticism is always sacramental (at least in voto), but the sacraments are not the whole of Christian mysticism; no more so than Baptism or the Lord's Supper contain the whole of Pauline or Johannine theology. 111 E. Gilson, à propos of St. Bernard, expresses very well how the coincidence of tradition and of personal invention operates in Christian mysticism: "All takes place, in fact, as if St. Bernard had posed a personal problem, but also as if he had wagered he could resolve the problem with the help of data none of which was foreign to Scriptural or Patristic tradition. I might add that he won his wager. Perhaps that is one of the secrets of the indefinite rejuvenation of Christian thought and of its inexhaustible vitality. Each time that a saint asks himself a new question, or an old question under a new form, Christian tradition furnishes the elements of the reply; but it is necessary that the saint be there to pose the question. St. Bernard posed his: how to make Benedictine life serve in the realization of this life of union with God in love towards which he strove with all</page><page sequence="19">AUGUSTIN LEONARD 325 his power. Tradition furnished him with the elements of the reply. It had furnished him with the elements of the reply to every other question touching the means or the end of Christian life. But he alone could order them in a synthesis which was that of his spiritual life itself, for his life is only the concrete realization of his doctrine, his doctrine the abstract formula of his life. Now, before all else, we must place at the origin of his thought a first quantity, the mass of Scriptural texts borrowed from the first Epistle of St. John. Chapter IV.

It is a tendency toward an always greater plenitude, transforming knowledge into unknowing, the theology of concepts into contemplation, dogmas into the experience of ineffable mysteries. It is also an existential theology engaging the entire being, by placing it in the way of union, by obliging it to change, by transforming its nature, in order to arrive at the true Gnosis, which is contemplation of the Holy Trinity."

The trans lator (de Gandillac) calls attention to the paradoxical character of "this luminous darkness, and more than luminous, which at the same time conceals and reveals the divine mysteries" (p. 35). H. C. Puech concludes that "Dionysius appears at bottom indifferent to a translation or a transcrip tion of mystical experience into the language of luminosity or of obscurity." (Op. cit., p. 43). Besides Dionysius limited himself to treating a dogmatic theme by means of a traditional allegory, and to tracing a theoretical itinerary. It is not a question therefore of an experience, as in Gregory of Nyssa or John of the Cross, but of a theory. In the same sense, but more accentuated, Père Labriolle concludes to a "metaphysical speculation." (Tu solus Sanctus, Paris, 1948, pp. 114-115). I prefer to think with V. Lossky, (op. cit., p. 26 ff.), and precisely because of the presence of light in the darkness, that it can be a question only of an experience of union with God. Whether Dionysius had lived the experience or not is secondary. If he did live it, the encounter of a theory with an experience is very significant for us. Whatever the truth of it, Dionysius describes a permanent trait of Christian mysticism, whence the favor he enjoys—a trait which depelnds on the unknowable nature of God Himself, or of his transcendence. 124 J.

Gregory of Nyssa and Augustine, the Areopagite or Tauler can describe spiritual life in terms borrowed from neo-Platonism; the same degrees of the ascent of the soul toward God can present in them the same formal characters, conscious or unconscious, as the dialectic stages of a Plotinus or the states of union of a Hallaj, some Christian mystics, others pagan mystics, helped or not by grace, because for some the object of the sovereign experience is and for some is not the triune God, the God Incarnate. For Ruysbroeck the very forms of mystical experience are a function of its content, God one and triune. As for* his predecessors in the Low Countries, the monastic Beatrice of Nazareth or the great lyric poetess of divine love Hadewych, this impetus is borne not towards the God of the philo sophers, but toward the God of Jesus Christ revealed in Jesus Christ."

Guillaume, Introduction à la psychologie, Paris, 1942, p. 340. 156 With regard to the rapture of Marie of the Incarnation in the Trinity—which is an extreme case outside of central mystical experience—Henri Brémond studies the relationship with the precise doctrine expressed by the Blessed, before, during, and after the experience. He writes: "In fact, at least the last two of these states (during and after) penetrate one another, become confused, more or less overlap one another. This rapture lasted more than two hours; this is as much as to say that it was not only rapture. At such moments, memory and intelligence find again something of their ordinary activity, turning into their own paths, directing, controlling up to a certain point, in short conditioning the rapture itself."

It is striking to observe that a historian so widely informed as the Abbe Brémond does not for an instant propose the problem of relationship between doctrine and experience. "The devotee and the mystic, although they do not speak the same language, or although they do not always give the same meaning to the same word, have no difficulty in under standing one another. If one does not penetrate asi deeply as the other, still the samei reality occupies them both: to know God Himself; the same road leads them both to this unique object: it is the way of despoiling of self. Whence it comes that the same work, the Imitation, will appear simply devout to some, properly mystical to others, both alike finding nourishment there, the directions of which they have used." Op. cit., Ill, 497, η. 1. 161 "7*he mystic who, in ordinary circumstances, would pretend to a doctrinal mission, is only a visionary pure and simple." Brémond, op. cit., VI, 32-33; II, Appendix, p. 392 £F. 162 "One who speaks by metaphorical locutions does not lie; for he does not intend by his locution to lead us into the things which are signified by the words, but rather into those which are like the things signified by the words." St. Thomas, 1 Sent., dist. XVI, p. 1, art. 3, ad. 3. 163 The great weakness of the religious philosophy of R. Otto, otherwise so rich, is the im possibility of reconciling symbolic knowledge obtained from the experience of the numinous, and properly intellectual knowledge:, except by an a priori decree, which removes from the latter all its real value. 164 "As for mystical knowledge, admitting that such exists, it is for theml extraordinarily rich, for us extraordinarily defective—for us who understand it by what they deliver to us of it." J. Baruzi. "Introduction à des recherches sur la langage mystique," in Recherches philosophiques, I (1931-1932), 68. One might add that even for the mystics this knowledge remains deficient. 165 "A rigorously symbolic mysticism would imply in fact that the symbol never conceals, like an ordinary sign, a secret world to which the writer attaches himself in reality while he apparently conducts us by means of images. And we would ask ourselves then whether a symbolic mysticism, understood in the strict sense, has ever been fully realized." Saint Jean de la Croix, pp. 326, 323-329. 166 G. Rabeau, Introduction à l'étude de la théologie, Paris, 1926, p. 36. 167 The celebrated text of the Cantique spirituel admirably illustrates the incapacity of mystical language, but also the power which is immanent to it: "The holy doctors could say so much and more, yet they will never succeed in expressing in words what cannot be said in words: and so the explanation given is ordinarily only a feeble part of the content of the symbols." Edited by Chevallier, Paris, 1933, p. 30·. 168 Brémond, op. cit., V, 36. See, in the same sense, the beautiful reflections of J. Baruzi, In troduction ..., loc. cit., pp. 73, 82. Likewise, Maritain says: "As for mystical language, it has been very well demonstrated that it is necessarily other than philosophical language; hyperbole there is not a rhetorical ornament, but a means of expression rigorously required to signify things with exactness. For, to tell the truth, it is a question there of rendering sensible the experience itself, and that experience the most ineffable of all. Philosophical language is disposed before all to express reality without touching it, mystical language to· cause it to be understood as in touching it without seeing it." (Les degrés; du savoir, p. 648). But how to distinguish the mystical radiance from the poetic aurai Despite an analogy of structure—obscure knowledge expressing itself in symbols—poetic experience differs profoundly from mystical experience. The first is inseparable from the exterior transmission, "it is not anterior to the work, it is the work making itself" (J. Lacroix, "L'intuition» méthode de purification," in Henri Bergson, Essais et témoignages inédits, Neuchâtel, 1941, p. 211). The second, on the other hand, disappears on being expressed in order to leave only a reflection of itself. "Poetry is a state of soul at once terrestrial and supraterrestrial, accompanied by a need of exteriorization. The mystical state is a pleasure in God which does not know how to express itself without destroying itself. Ond is the contrary of the other." (Max Jacob, in "De la poésie comme exercise spiritual," Tontaine, 1942, p. 269.) See the difference drawn by Massignon between introspec tion and retrospection: the mystic delivers his experience as such, the poet elaborates it (Revue d'his toire des religions, XCIII [1926], 182). In the same connection, see A. Béguin, Gerard de Nerval, suivi de Poésie, et mystique, Paris, 1936. 169 Let us add a new example to all those which have been offered. H. Kraemer takes up again the antithesis between mysticism and prophetism established by Soderblom and Heiler. Mysticism is the product of a naturalistic monism; prophetism is the fruit of revealed and personalist religion. The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World, London, 1938, pp. 357-360. See Père de Menasce, in Nouvelle Revue de Science Missionaire, 1945, fasc. 4. . 170 E. Gilson, La théologie mystique de saint Bernard, p. 143. For St. Bernard the author de finitely establishes these two points: that the soul does not become identified with the substance of God, and that ecstasy] is not a pure unconsciousness. But the case of St. Bernard is not privileged. One will find this same refusal of pantheism in St. John of the Cross (notes 38, 39, 40 supra); J. Maritain, Les degrés..., p. 750. It would be easy to produce a list of texts from all the mystics. Ruysbroeck, one of the most speculative of mystics, says: "This living union which we experience with God is active and always renews itself between us and Him. In fact the kiss and the embrace show us a duality which does not allow us to remain in ourselves. Living above reason, we are nevertheless not without reason, and we are conscious of touching and of being touched, of loving and of being loved, of always beginning again and of reentering into ourselves, of going and coming,</page><page sequence="22">328 CROSS CURRENTS like the lightning in the sky... But when I say that we are one with God, it is necessary to under stand this of love, and of essence or of nature." (Le miroir du salut éternel, Oeuvres, 3d edition, Brussels, 1937, I, 132). It is necessary to guard against being led astray by certain expressions, such as this of St. Catherine of Genoa: "The proper center of everyone is God Himself" (Von Hugel, Mystical Element, I, 265). These expressions must be judged in the general context which Gilson calls to mind: "The drama of Christian, mysticism is that a creature is in need of his creator* much more absolutely than any being is of its God in any other metaphysical economy, and that, for this very reason, a creator is much less accessible to His creature than is any God for beings who depend less radically on Him. What the Christian mystic continually asks himself is how he can rejoin the Being, he who is nothing. Let down, be it only for one instant and on one point, the barrier which contingency of being erects between man and God, and you deprive the Christian mystic of his God; you deprive him then of his mysticism. He can dispense with any God who is not inaccessible. The only God who is naturally inaccessible is also the only one with Whom he cannot dispense." (op. cit., pp. 142-143). 171 It is through this doctrine of grace that "in spite of resemblances... oriental and Christian mystics principally differ. They do not share a point of departure. Oriental mystical experience is a provoked experience; its progress is determined like that of a laboratory experiment. Properly managed, with all its exactions, it cannot but succeed. The doctrine, except in modern India, allows for neither grace nor a free gift. Man succeeds by ascetic effort in suppressing the screen which masks the sun from him. He is then, inevitably illuminated without the sun willing it or even knowing it." J. Bacot, Preface to S. Lemaitre, Le mystère de la -mort dans les religions de l'Asie, Paris, 1943, pp. VII-VIII. "The texts relative to yoga tell us the conception formed of experience, which is of the psycho-physiological order and at the same time mystical and in which the part of constructive and conscious technique is great." O. Lacombe, in a review of L. Renou, Anthologie sanskrite, Paris, 1947, in Etudes, CCLVI (1948), 265-266. 172 E. Bréhier says of Plotinus: "The very idea of salvation, which supposes a mediator sent by· God to man, is foreign to him." He also remarks on the Hermetic a: "Although he has not, as the editor (W. Scott) shows, a perfect unity of doctrine in all these treatises, one is struck by Ending there the same character which separates Plotinus from all religions of salvation: to know union with God by simple contemplation or intuition, and the absencq of any mediator to be re sponsible for this union." La philosophie de Plotin, Paris, 1928, p. 114. 173 «'How to join these two ends? It is a mystery," says Père Festugière, "Psychologie des mys tiques," in Supplément de la Vie Spirituelle.
