Iconography: The iconography of  Magna Mater was exceptional  in Roman terms, but remarkedly similar to that of  Elagabal. The  baetyl which represented the goddess had been brought from Asia: an  unhewn black stone of  hand-size. Apparently, in Arnobius’ day it was  displayed in the temple on the neck of  an otherwise anthropomorphic  statue (oris loco).49 In Augustan literary and visual art, as well as later,  the baetyl is replaced completely by the attributes of  the goddess, most  notably the turreted crown and lions, with or without the actual female   gure representing the goddess.50 Like Magna Mater, Elagabal too was  worshipped in the shape of  a baetyl, i.e. in aniconic form. As in the  former case, this posed a problem of  recognizibility. The problem was  again solved by an iconographic marker, in this case an eagle. The eagle  had already accompanied the baetyl of  the god in representations from  ancient times, as the earliest extant Syrian evidence testi es.51 After  the introduction of  the cult in Rome, the eagle remained a standard  requisite of  the Syrian god: it appeared on a  gurative pilaster capital  from Rome, which may have belonged to the Palatine temple, and  also on Roman coins from the period in question.52 In most cases, the  eagle was represented in frontal view, with its wings half  opened and  a wreath in its beak. The depiction resembled the Jovian bird, with  the exception of  the baetyl, which was normally depicted (at least on  Roman representations) behind it. Such an association of  the god with  Iuppiter was deliberate, since the Syrian god claimed the succession  of  Iuppiter. 6. Ritual: Three rituals of  Magna Mater in Rome stand out. Annu- ally, the followers of  the goddess would rally to form a procession in  the city, carrying her cult image to the sound of  tambourines and   utes, while at the same time begging for alms.53 Interestingly, Ovid  mentions a peculiar ritual bath of  the cult statue of  the goddess in the  Almo, a tributary of  the Tiber, in the southern vicinity of  Rome in  48 SHA Elag. 3.4; 6.6–7.1. 49 Arn. adv. nat. 7.49. 50 Martin 1988, 257f.; E.

For these were no per- manent cults of  divine concepts, but ephemeral and inconsequential  outbursts of  public approval; at most, one might say, admiration in a  semi-cultic form. Of cial dei cation in Rome can be dated accurately to the period  immediately following Caesar’s assassination and culminating in the  formal consecration of  the deceased dictator by the senate in January 42  B.C. The circumstances leading up to this climax have been adequately  analyzed by Weinstock and others and need no further exposition here.83  Whatever stance is taken regarding the exact sequence of  events, it is  clear that ultimately, the dei ed ruler secured a well de ned position  as a divine concept. Despite the more or less stereotyped procedure of  posthumous divi- nization of  the emperor during the imperial period, there seem to have  been palpable differences between individual Divi in terms of  actual  worship.

Three considerations suggest that both Dius  Fidius on the Quirinal and Fides on the Capitol form hypostases of   the relevant cults of  Iuppiter. Firstly, etymology. Despite attempts by the ancients to interpret the  epithet Fidius as  lius (‘son’),116 there is no reasonable doubt among  modern scholars that the word is connected to  des (‘trust’).117 Besides,  whatever the exact etymology of  Dius, there is a consensus among  scholars that the word is somehow linked to the semantic  eld of   Iuppiter, either as an adjective meaning ‘bright’,118 or more directly as  ‘belonging to Iuppiter’.119 Even the ancient etymologists consistently  sensed the link with Iuppiter.120  Secondly, ritual. We now nothing of  the cult of  Dius Fidius, though  we do have important information concerning the cult of  Fides on  the Capitol, which for the sake of  argument may be considered here  as forming the pendant to the cult of  Dius Fidius on the Quirinal.

Here the authorities ran  into two dif culties. On the one hand, it was not at all easy for them  to establish with certainty the adherence of  a suspect to the Christian  faith, because the only bond that tied one Christian to another was joint  prayer in conjunction with the temporal focus of  Easter, and neither  of  these two elements was easy to prove. In fact, unless a Christian  confessed to his faith, his or her adherence to the Christian god could  be demonstrated only ex negativo: ideally, a Christian was someone who  would not sacri ce to the emperor and the traditional gods even under  the threat of  death.186 But this criterion was weak and insuf cient,  as soon as a defendant actually ignored the Christian dogma of  the  incompatibility of  the simultaneous worship of  God and pagan gods. The second problem Roman authorities encountered was the fact  that given the dearth of  conceptual foci of  the Christian god, there was  precious little left to control. Daily prayers and a belief  in salvation via  resurrection were beyond the reach of  Roman of cialdom, and spatial  foci or priests who could be hold responsible were non-existent. It is then  fair to say that it was the essential lack of  major conceptual foci of  the  Christian god that made him uniquely resistant to his persecutors. 186 Plin. ep. 10.96.5. </page> </plain_text>
