<plain_text><page sequence="1">FESTIVALS AND CEREMONIES OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC. By H. H. SCULLARD. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press (Aspects of Greek and Roman Life Series). 1981. Pp. 288, 39 plates. THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION in the life of the Roman state invests this book with uncommon importance. Greek observers like Polybius (6.56.6) and Dionysius of Halicarnassus (2.23.4) thought that it was Rome's religion that made her great, and the Roman Cicero for all his rationalism evidently shared their opinion (note, e.g., his remarks in De natura deorum 1.3); and even</page><page sequence="2">90 PHOENIX modern students, unlikely though they are to concur, will readily agree that Roman religious usages, such as the expiation of omens or the insertion of intercalary days into the Roman year, could (and sometimes did) affect the course of events at Rome profoundly. Yet until now no reliable and up-to-date account of Roman cults and their associated practices existed, at least in English. The lack has now been remedied with this welcome and admirable replacement for Warde Fowler's antiquated Roman Festivals of almost a century ago. Scullard provides, first, a generalized account of Roman religion and the attitude of the Romans towards it. Next, he reviews in some detail the months of the year, carefully describing the public festivals and other religious occasions in each. The third part of his book deals with the aspects of Roman life where religious overtones were particularly evident, such as triumphal celebrations, meetings of Senate and People, and census takings. For good measure there are excellent plates, maps pinpointing the temple sites in Rome, a learned and versatile documentation, and a comprehensive and trustworthy index. Throughout, Scullard keeps strictly to the subject in hand. He refuses to be side-tracked into ingenious speculations about the putative Indo-European origins for Roman rituals, and he sees little point in guessing at the meaning of practices which the ancients themselves were at a loss to explain. This approach, and particularly (I suspect) such expressions as "the uncertain spirit-world of prehistory" or "a pre-anthropomorphic animistic stage of development" (76, 77), may seem somewhat old-fashioned to today's specialists; but the general reader will relish a lucid and well-informed exposition mercifully free of bewildering conjectures. For that matter, Scullard's occasional allusions to Eskimos and others suggest that, if he had a mind to, he could hold his own with the comparative anthropologists. Nor does he overlook parallels (survivals?) between Roman ceremonies and modern. His aim was to present an accurate account of what the Romans actually did, and in this he has succeeded, comprehensively and very competently. His book includes not only the great public festivals of the Roman People as a whole, but also those celebrated by some of its parts (such as the one to Faunus in pagis, 201); and it even directs attention, where relevant, to practices in non-Roman Italy (note the excursus on Umbrian Iguvium, 83 f.). Even shadowy deities like Carna, Furrina, and Helernus are not ignored. The first six months are allotted more space than the last six (90 pages as against 54), but this is because there are no Fasti from Ovid for July to December and October and November were "lean months for festivals" (196). Blemishes are few and minor. None of the misprints are serious, although one is rather amusing ( 120 has the twenty-seven virgins of the Secular Games signing, instead of singing, hymns to Juno). One or two of the topographical details are a little unclear, and the Numicus is more probably the Fosso di Pratica than the Rio Torto (64).

Such insignificant slips hardly detract from the value and usefulness of a volume that ought to be on the shelves of everyone interested in ancient Rome. HAMILTON, ONTARIO E. T.
