<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EXCAVATION OF A ROCK SHELTER AT AUDLEY, ROYAL NATIONAL PARK, N.S.W. By Julia Cox, Leslie Maynard, and J. V. S. Megaw* excavation of the site at Audley was begun and completed in the first three months of 1963 by students of the University of Sydney as part of a general survey of Aboriginal settlement in the Port Hacking district under the direction of J. V. S. Megaw for the University of Sydney Archaeology Society (see Megaw, 1966a, Fig. 6 for a distribution map of sites). Attention had been drawn to the site by Mr. I. M. Sim, Planning Officer of the N.S.W. State Planning Authority, and the work was carried out with the financial support of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. The following two parts of this paper have been written by the first and last named authors ; the third dealing with the paintings by Mrs. Maynard. The floor of the rock shelter was covered thickly with shells1 and the roof was adorned with paintings and hand stencils (discussed below, pp. 97 ff.) ; it seemed probable therefore that the excavation of the shelter would add to knowledge of the Port Hacking-National Park area. Unfortunately neither paintings nor hand stencils occurred below the present ground surface, thus enabling them to be dated by carbon samples from the deposit. Nevertheless Audley is the first painted art site in the Sydney district to be fully described. Excavation The rock shelter (Fig. 1 : Military Map reference 055908 ; project code NP/-) is close to the picnic grounds at Audley in the Royal National Park ; it is situated about 200 yds. north of the Allambie Motel, and has only once been previously and briefly described in print (see pp. 97-98). Here a low roofed recess runs into the cliff of Hawkesbury Sandstone on the left bank of the Port Hacking River ; at its deepest point the cave reaches 13 ft. 6 in. into this cliff. At its present level the river is 20 ft. below the cave but this distance must have been greater before the construction of the weir, a quarter of a mile downstream ; the river running past the shelter would have formerly been salt water and tidal. A series of eight cuttings which covered the whole main area of the cave was excavated. The cuttings were of varying sizes and were distinguished by letters (Fig. 1) but as no significant stratigraphy appeared no divisions were made in the ♦ Departments of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Sydney, N.S.W. 1 Identified by Dr. D. F. McMichael, at the time Curator of Molluses, Australian Museum, as estuarine species readily comparable with those recovered from a rock shelter some three miles downstream at Gymea Bay (Megaw, 1966a, 47) .</page><page sequence="2">EXCAVATION OF A ROCK SHELTER AT AUDLEY, N.S.W. 95 material from each cutting (with the exception of Cutting Β where an aboriginal occupation level was clearly marked). Throughout the area only a shallow depth of deposit was revealed, the greatest depth reached being 18 in. in cutting B3, but as this was mainly soil wash at the front of the cave, it is of little significance. In Cutting A2 however toward the centre of the shelter, the deepest point was 16 in.; bedrock was exposed in all cuttings. At the base of cutting B, the clay and rock which formed the bottom of the cutting had been hollowed out in a circular depression which was presumably used as a hearth; the clay showing signs of burning. This was the only find of a structural nature which occured at Audley, although con- centrations of ash and charcoal in cuttings C, X, and Β are possibly also the remains of temporary cooking places.

Excavation showed that the site had been considerably disturbed- a straight sided pit which appeared in cutting Β is thought to have been the work of Mr. W. H. P, Kinsella, an amateur collector who is known to have investigated the site on his own behalf and is reported to have found among other things, human skeletal material. Unfortunately it has not been possible to examine this material. Other signs of disturbance included the finding of fragments of newspaper : one dated 1916 was found on the surface of cutting C2, and a piece of a 1938 paper was found at a depth of 5 in., one inch above bedrock in cutting Ai. As well as these well-dated disturbances, pieces of modern bottle glass and metal occurred in most cuttings, usually however in the layer of sterile soil wash which covered most of the site. One curious feature of the undisturbed areas of cuttings Β and C was the discovery of some small fragments of coal, the nearest natural source for which is the historic seam at Coalcliff some ten miles to the south. Although there are no other recorded instances of coal having been found in Australian archaeological contexts there is nothing improbable in postulating chance collection (if not use) by Aborigines of coastal scatters of coal such as gave rise to the first European location of coal deposits in Australia in 1797 (Mackaness, 1937, p. 323) .2 Finds The finds from Audley consisted mainly of stone implements and waste flakes, the source material being pebbles of quartz or flint ; some bone material did occur but the quantity was insufficient to allow any useful identifications to be made from it - the antiquity of this material is also dubious.

As can be seen from the table (Fig. 2) the most frequently occurring types were fabricators and scrapers but no backed material was recorded - this accords with the findings from the upper or recent levels of other South Sydney coastal sites from which backed blades are lacking (Megaw, 19666). The standard of workmanship and the material (mainly cherts) of most of the implements was rather poor. (Fig. 1) A sherd of plain white glazed pottery, a piece of dark green bottle-glass, and an iron single-edged knife, found unstratified in cutting C have been identified by Mr. James Barber, City Museum and Art Gallery, Plymouth, Devon as late Victorian though probably before 1900. (Fig. 1) These finds must refer to an early visit to the site. Some fragments of cut bone were found in the undisturbed parts of the site but do not appear to be classifiable as artefacts. Mr. A. G. Thorne, Department of Anatomy, University of Sydney has examined the faunal material and considers that the fragments are of marsupial long bones. A bi-facially worked quartzite pebble tool on the surface of cutting X was matched by a flake in situ in cutting A2. It is however, clear from recent work in New South Wales (McBryde, 1966 ; Tindale, 1964 ; Megaw, 19666 ; and current work on the South Coast) that uni- and bi-face pebble tools range from c. 2000 B.c. to A.D. 1800 and so offer no index of chronology. In conclusion, it seems that there is nothing from the Audley rock shelter which indicates any great antiquity of occupation and it is all the more unfortunate that no stratigraphie evidence was present to suggest even a relative age for the paintings. The Art of the Audley Rock Shelter The Audley rock shelter is a minor art site. Aboriginal drawings and paintings on the eastern central coast are poor by comparison with the cave art of Arnhem Land and Cape York ; Audley is poor by comparison with some of the better sites near Sydney. The figures are few in number ; most are indeterminate and amorphous ; there is very little range of subjects, colour combinations and patterns. The main interest of the Audley drawings is their association with motifs found among the rock engravings of Sydney and the Hawkesbury River area. Very few of the cave art sites in this area have been published ; they have been overshadowed by the more spectacular engravings. Some examples have been published by Campbell, 1899 ; McCarthy, 1959a ; Macintosh, 1965. Some of the drawings in the shelter were described in an Official Guide to the National Park of N.S.W. , first published in 1915, and where the shelter is named " Gibber Gunya " (house of rock). A shark, in black outline with white body, and a number of outline drawings of fish are mentioned ; these, and the location given,</page><page sequence="5">9« EXCAVATION OF A ROCK SHELTER AT AUDLEY, N.S.W. identify the Audley site. Also described are a number of figures which cannot now be identified. " At the entrance to the cave in question, on an oval background of red, is a beautifully finished design, of a freehand character, in black, with white markings. . . . Inside the cave are dozens of imprints of hands in grey, black, brown and red pigments, which have eaten into the soft sandstone." (pp. 95-97)· Either these have faded completely, or else the writer was misled by natural markings in the iron stained sandstone, which he took for Aboriginal drawings. The multi-coloured hand imprints are probably an incorrect description of the white stencils which are present in the shelter. All of the figures are drawn with dry pigment. This method is more common in south east Australian sites than painting with liquid colours (McCarthy, 1962, 44). The colour is thinly applied and the pale drawings do not stand out well on the dull coloured sandstone surface. The pigments used could all have been obtained from iron stained shale beds in the local Narrabeen series rocks of which the nearest outcrop is in the valley of the Port Hacking River, about five miles upstream from Audley. The site was recorded in 1964 by I. M. Sim at a scale of 1 : 10 and the drawing here reproduced (Fig. 3) is based on Mr. Sim's work and has been prepared for publica- tion by Mr. Kevin Maynard. Figures 1 to 10 are on the roof of the shelter ; the rest are along the back wall. The following subjects are represented, the numbers in brackets referring to the plan : Seven fish (11, 15, 16, 32, 33, 34 and 38) ; three of these (11, 15, 16) are large black outline figures with infilling of white pigment in parallel strokes. Three eels (27, 29 and 36) ; (27) and (29) are similar in style and size to the large black and white fish. Twelve hand stencils in white (1-10, 17 and 26). All except (5) appear distorted. There are also a number of indeterminate figures (14, 21, 24, 25, 31, 35 and 37) as well as 27 short parallel strokes in black charcoal with a crossline (13) ; they resemble the so-called " tally marks " formed of abraded grooves found widely distributed in Australia (McCarthy, 1962, 14-17). The balance of the figures consist of various patches of colour; their only significance is the sequence of superimposition which they form with other figures. Colours used and sequence of superimposition may be summarised by the following two tables : Stencils . . . . 12 Red 6 White 3 Black 12 Black and White .. 5 Total .. .. 38</page><page sequence="6">EXCAVATION OF A ROCK SHELTER AT AUDLEY, N.S.W. 99 Superimpositions Colour No. Figures Black and White over Red 4 n/12, 16/18, 27/28, 29/30 Black and White over White 1 15/19 Black and White over Stencil 1 16/17 Black over White 1 20/19 Black over Stencil 1 25/26 White over Red 2 19/18, 22/23 Total 10 Either Stencil or Red could therefore be earliest. Either Black or Black and White could be most recent. White is earlier than Black and also earlier than Black and White, and is later than Red. i.e. Colour Sequence : 1. Stencil, Red. 2. White. 3. Black, Black and White. This sequence could indicate some time depth in the art at the site, represented by change in the popularity of colours. This would only be valid if all the black and white figures are contemporary, all the blacks, all the stencils, etc., with no major time overlap in the use of different colours. Otherwise, in the case of such a small number of figures, the sequence of superimposed colours could be random, and the drawings consist of a single episode. Is colour sequence equivalent to stylistic succession, which is more strongly suggestive of time depth ? Neither colour nor size are equivalent to " style ", and a more important criterion in distinguishing one style from another is form (Megaw, 1967)3. Differences in style, therefore, especially when these imply change through time, cannot be based solely on colour. At this site, however, there is some correspondence between colour and form. All the stencils - which must obviously be similar in form - are white, and the spattered pigment shows the same concentration in each one. The red figures are indecipherable rounded patches of colour; the white are indeterminate streaks. The black figures consist of small line drawings and some fish ; the others are indeterminate in subject, but possess definite form. Several of them have parallel line infilling. All five black and white figures are large, well shaped drawings, outlined with black and infilled with parallel strokes of white running along the body. Sequence of superimposed colours could therefore be extended to a sequence of forms. It seems then that the thirty eight figures at this site were not all done at the same time, but on several occasions, to which different fashions in colour and form were appropriate. At the least, there are no disconformities to the sequence - e.g. a stencil superimposed on a black and white figure. »Add to Megaw's bibliography Schmitz (1956) on style in the context of New Guinea art.</page><page sequence="7">ioo EXCAVATION OF A ROCK SHELTER AT AUDLEY, N.S.W. ι 'S 1 8 i i i i to E</page><page sequence="8">EXCAVATION OF A ROCK SHELTER AT AUDLEY, N.S.W. ιοί As only a very few of the cave art sites near Sydney have been published as a whole or in detail, this sequence cannot be extended to apply to any area beyond this particular site. Comparisons with two other sites give contradictory results. Following are tables of superimpositions at Lake Conjola (McCarthy, 1959a) and Mount Manning (Macintosh, 1965) : Conjola (Several caves) Black and White over Black . . 1 Black and Red over Black . . . . 1 Black over White 1 Black over Red . . . . . . 2 Red over White Stencil . . . . 2 Total 7 Mount Manning (Northern Shelter) White Stencil over White . . . . 1 White over black 4 White over Red Infilled . . . . 1 White over Red Outline . . . . 1 Black over Red Infilled . . . . 2 Red Infilled over Red Outline . . 1 Total 10 Therefore the sequence of colours at these sites is as follows : Conjola Mount Manning Audley 1. White Stencil 1. Red Outline 1. White Stencil, Red. 2. Red, White 2. Red Infilled 2. White. 3. Black. 3. Black 3. Black, Bichrome. 4. Bichrome 4. White 5. White Stencil. The sequence at Conjola is entirely compatible with Audley. The sequence at Audley also corresponds to the succession of colours described by Mr. McCarthy as occurring in the cave art of the central coastal region of New South Wales, and based on his extensive field knowledge of the art of this area (McCarthy in Berndt, 1964, 38). This is : 1. Stencils. 2. Red, White, Black and White. 3. Black, White, Black and White. 4. Polychrome (represented at one site only). At Mount Manning, however, this order of colour superimposition is almost reversed. The sequence at Mount Manning is duplicated in another rock shelter, about nine miles away at Wyong Creek (Macintosh, 1965, 92).</page><page sequence="9">102 EXCAVATION OF A ROCK SHELTER AT AUDLEY, N.S.W. Macintosh obtained a radiocarbon date of circa a.D. 1750-1830 for the drawings in the Northern Shelter at Mount Manning by excavation in the floor of the shelter of ochres corresponding in colour to the drawings. The Mount Manning figures are similar in execution and composition to Audley, being a group of animals found locally and presumably exploited by the Aborigines. Ten eels in black, red and white closely resemble those at Audley. Mount Manning and Audley are, however, separated by sixty miles of territory containing Aboriginal engravings and drawings. Although many groups of engravings in the Sydney area have been recorded and published there is no comparable material on the drawing sites. In respect of this engraved art, quantitative study has shown great differences in subject representation and form, between the northern and southern extremes of the region, and between the coastal and inland sections (McMah, 1965). It does not seem likely that the cave art of this large area is any more homogeneous. This is confirmed by the contradictory sequence of colours at Mount Manning and Audley. Therefore at the present, the relevence of the Mount Manning date to Audley, or to any other isolated site is too limited to be useful. Macintosh's work at Mount Manning, in the circumstances of the ochre deposits in the floor which provided dates for two different series of figures, could be important to the study of parietal art on the central New South Wales coast. He estimates the age of a group containing a pair of anthropomorphic figures at a.d. 1400 (based on radiocarbon estimations) ; anthropomorphs are an outstanding feature among the engravings in this area. The dates apply to cave drawings. They will become more valuable when the content and distribution of the cave art of Sydney has been more extensively described, and when the relationship of the drawn to the engraved art is established for example - do the drawings simply represent the same motifs but in different media ? This question has not yet been sufficiently discussed. It is useful to make specific comparisons between the engraved and drawn art found in the same area - i.e. the Audley motifs and engraved sites in Royal National Park. At six published carving sites within six miles of Audley, fish comprise the main motif. The proportions of fish to the total number of figures at each site are - 4 : 5, 25 : 49, 3 : 6, 10 : 16, 4 : 6, and one site consisting of a single fish (Sim, 1962 and 1963, Groups 109, in, 112, 115, 116, 107 respectively). The other subjects present are humans, kangaroos and indeterminate forms. This preponderance of fish among engraved figures is characteristic of the coastal region. A study of the representation of different subjects in different environmental areas shows that fish comprise 34% of all subjects within five miles of the coast, as opposed to 4% in areas more than 20 miles from the sea (McMah, 1965, 40). In outline the three large black and white fish are identical to most of these fish. There is a single carved fish, similar in size (3J ft.) and outline to the Audley</page><page sequence="10">EXCAVATION OF A ROCK SHELTER AT AUDLEY, N.S.W. 103 fish, at Wattamolla Lagoon, 5J miles away. The double ventral fin shown on the two largest fish is also found frequently among the carved fish. At Marley Beach, (six miles south-east from Audley) and at Fisherman's Bay (34 miles away) there are a number of fish, some much larger than Audley, up to 17 ft., but showing the double fin in several cases (Sim, 1963, 19-26). The occurrence of this characteristic is more common at the south end of the Sydney-Hawkesbury carving area than in the north. Its appearance therefore in two of the fish at Audley typically links them with the engraved forms in the area. The form of the eels at the Audley shelter is standard throughout the Sydney- Hawkesbury carving region. They are identifiable by their elongated shape and the two small fins placed symmetrically and directly behind the point head. Two eyes are often shown on the head. Among the carvings however, the eels are less common in the south, comprising 6% of all fish south of Botany Bay, compared with 26% north of the Hawkesbury River. The closest engraved examples to Audley are at Burraneer Point (5 miles away) and on the Cronulla Peninsula (54 miles away), both on the other side of the Port Hacking River. Some importance seems attached to this form in the Sydney area. Near the Upper Crescent Reach of the Hawkesbury River, is an enormous engraved figure which is almost identical in shape to the eels at Audley, being curved in the body, unlike most of the carved eels, which are straight. This figure is 37 ft. long and 6 ft. wide, and is isolated on a large rock surface above the river (McCarthy, 19596) On the Peter Howe Trust Reserve near Somersby, there are three large standard, eel-forms from 22 to 32 feet in length. Here they are associated with men, spears and also with a large anthropomorphic figure, 24 ft. long, decorated with stripes and a large headdress, who also displays some emu-like characteristics (McCarthy, 1947). It seems likely in these circumstances that some extra significance is attached to these large portrayals of the " eel ", beyond the depiction of a food resource. In the case of these figures, it might be difficult to retain a zoological identification with the eels found in the streams and lagoons, but in shape they are still identical to the smaller carvings and drawings described above. McCarthy, who recorded these groups, has already pointed out in both cases the unusual significance of these figures, which he connects also with the various Rainbow Serpent traditions. There are also two large "humanoid" figures in the Sydney area which have unusual heads, identical to the normal eel with pointed head and fins. One, a man, 14 ft. long, is at Devil's Rock, Maroota (McCarthy, 19596) and the other, a woman, 12 ft. long, is in the Dharug National Park, north of the Hawkesbury River (McCarthy, 1956). The Maroota figure is shown in a colour photograph in Australian Aboriginal Art (McCarthy in Berndt, 1964, Plate 9, opp. 42). The usual portrayal of the human form has a rounded head with no projections at the sides, and all other large anthropomorphic figures conform to this. Both of the "eel-headed" anthro-</page><page sequence="11">104 EXCAVATION OF A ROCK SHELTER AT AUDLEY, N.S.W. pomorphs are heavily decorated with line designs within the body outline, and occur at major carving groups where there are numbers of other large, varied and unusual figures. The connection of the eels at Audley with these figures, except in a detail of form, is tenuous, being greatly removed in distance, subject, size and technique, but the relevance of the content of the Audley shelter to other parietal art in Royal National Park is more immediate. The figures at Audley are very closely similar in form and subject representation to the body of engraved art in the surrounding area. This is a small piece of evidence for the common artistic identiy of the two media. References Campbell, W. D. (1899) : " Aboriginal Carvings of Port Jackson and Broken Bay ".
