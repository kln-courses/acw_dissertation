Lakeland Florida, USA ABSTRACT The vehicle occupant restraint system is given a new definition to accommodate the new occupant restraint systems. This new definition is modeled after the classical automatic control theory. The flexibility of this new definition permits its expansion to adopt any future regulations and expectations. A need to achieve the optimal protection for a range of crash and occupant scenarios in addition to a variety of restraint system configurations is spelt out, and intelligent restraint system which will incorporate this is defined and discussed. INTRODUCTION The occupant restraint system during vehicle crashes was never given a formal definition. First forms of occupant restraint systems were intended to contain the occupant within the vehicle during the crash. Now with motor vehicles becoming an integral part of our daily routine, more and more attention is being paid to the safety of vehicle occupants. Restraint systems evolved to include seat belts, energy absorbing steering columns and knee bolsters, and lately airbags for frontal and side impacts. It was in the late 1980's when rapid and massive implementation of Airbag systems in passenger vehicles took place. Federal regulations in the United States now require every car sold in the US be fitted with driver side and passenger side airbags for protection in frontal collisions. With the consumer awareness of the effectiveness of Airbags increasing in Europe, Australia, and Japan, it is putting pressure on the auto makers selling cars in these markets to fit them with airbags. The automotive community world wide are currently working on a global harmonization for safety legislation. The vehicle occupant restraint system is given a new definition to accommodate the new occupant restraint systems. This new definition is modeled after the classical automatic control theory. It defines the input as the crash pulse, the output as the controlled occupant kinematics. The transfer functions are defined by the characteristics of all components that effect the occupant kinematics. These components are classified in terms of their interaction with the occupant as direct and indirect components. The state variah'es of this control system are the inputs to the crash sensors that will activate some of the restraint system components. The flexibility of this new definition permits its expansion to adopt any future regulations and expectations. It also allows for the monitoring of the system output and measuring it against a certain threshold to create an error or deviation function to alter the system characteristics. This is to achieve the optimal protection for a range of crash and occupant scenarios in addition to a variety of restraint system configurations. This is the application of the classical closed loop feedback control theory to create an Intelligent Restraint System. BACKGROUND "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress hereby declares that the purpose of this Act is to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents. Therefore, Congress determines that it is necessary to establish motor vehicle safety standards for motor vehicles and equipment in interstate commerce; to undertake and support necessary safety research and development; and to expand the national driver register". This is the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 [1]. It is the first government attempt in the US to provide for a coordinated national safety program and establishment of safety standards for motor vehicles. The primary intent of this act is to reduce accidents involving motor vehicles and to reduce the deaths and injuries occurring in such accidents. Simultaneously the Department of Transportation Act enacted in 1966, established the Department of Transportation and provided that the Secretary of Transportation should establish a 2045</page><page sequence="2">Symposium on International Automotive Technology '96 National Traffic Safety Bureau. The Highway Safety Act of 1970, however, replaced the Bureau with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The purpose of NHTSA is "to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents". This is as defined in The Safety Act. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is divided into Titles, the one of interest to us is Title 49 "Transportation". Title 49 is further subdivided into parts. Part 571 is the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) which is further subdivided into several standards, 208 and 214 are two examples [2], Part 572 is the Anthropomorphic Test Dummies (ATD's) which is also further subdivided into subparts [3], Each of these subparts describes in detail a specific type of a test dummy. Subpart Β describes the 50th percentile Hybrid II male while subpart E describes the 50th percentile Hybrid III male. Federal and government regulations, however, do not define or describe the occupant restraint system. They only establish the compliance criteria of the restraint system in terms of its effectiveness in restraining occupants during crashes. THE NEW DEFINITION This new definition of an occupant restraint system is illustrated in figure 1 . This block diagram represents a control system where the input is the crash pulse as transformed by the vehicle structure into a forcing function on the occupant. The output is the kinematics of the occupant, as transformed by the restraint system reacting on the occupant. Vehicle components that come in contact with the occupant are either part of the forcing function or the restraint system, depending upon whether they force the motion of the occupant or whether they react to the motion of the occupant. The objective is to control the occupant kinematics to meet all the injury criteria that are specified by regulations and requirements. This control is to take place during all vehicle crashes that are also specified by regulations and requirements. The occupant in this case is defined not only by the 50th percentile dummy with the seat in mid position as per FMVSS 208 but the definition is expanded to include any occupant. This includes the 5th percentile female and the 95th percentile male in any seating position. For the purpose of developing a restraint system for the US market, both belted and unbelted occupants are also considered. This must also be the case when designing a restraint system for markets where seat belt usage is low to moderate. In addition to this definition of the occupant, children and infants are also considered among the multitude of occupants which the restraint system must accommodate. The restraint system is defined in this context by all the components that may reactively alter the occupant kinematics during a vehicle crash. These components can further be divided into two categories. The direct category is comprised of all the reactive components that come in direct contact with the occupant. The indirect category is comprised of those reactive components that may alter the occupant kinematics without coming in contact with the occupant. Some components may become a part of either group depending on the restraint system configuration. The steering wheel for example belongs to the direct category when there is no airbag and to the indirect category when there is an airbag. Examples of the restraint system components include airbags, seats and seat belts, steering wheels and columns, instrument panels and knee bolsters, and door structure and side impact airbags.

The design of the above restraint system components takes into considerations the spacial relationships between the vehicle interior and the occupant. These spacial relationships will dictate the stiffness of the belt and the size and shape of the airbag for example. The size of the bag will in turn dictate the inflator characteristics. Besides the direct and indirect division of the restraint system components, they can be divided into two different categories. These are the category of components that do not require activation and the category of the components that require activation. Example of the first category are the seats, steering wheel and column which are always in their position waiting for the occupant to come in contact with them. The second category, however, can further be divided into two groups. These are the passive and active. Buckling the seat belt is one example of the active group which requires an action to be taken by the vehicle occupant in order to activate this system. Airbags, belt pretensioners and motorized belts are examples of the passive group which does not require any action by the vehicle occupant to activate this system. These passive systems usually require crash sensing to activate whenever the crash is severe enough warranting the activation. In most cases a sensor system is required to detect the crash and deploy these systems whenever they are needed. All crash sensing systems to date are reactive in nature. The technology, however, is moving towards predictive sensing. The output of this control system is the controlled occupant kinematics. All regulations, however, specify the requirements in terms of injury indices. The following section will discuss in detail the development of most of the current injury criteria. INJURY CRITERIA The current compliance level of the front impact restraint system is measured in terms of the potential for injury at three different body regions. These body regions are head, chest, and femurs. The potential for injury to the head is measured by the Head Injury Criterion known as HIC. The HIC is calculated as a function of head acceleration and time according to the following equation: r -i2.5 I t2 HIC= I f adì (ti - t') t' where : a = Resultant Head Acceleration t2-t,&lt; 36 ms and are chosen to maximize the HIC value The potential for injury to the chest is measured through two criteria. These are chest acceleration sustained for 3 ms and chest deflection. The chest deflection was introduced in 1988 and is valid only with the use of Hybrid III dummy. The potential for injury to the femurs is measured by their compressive load. Table 1 lists the injury levels above which the restraint system and thus the vehicle will be non compliant to the US Federal Regulations. These limits are based on the tolerance limit of the human body to applied mechanical loads. Table 1 : Federal Injury Limits Criterion Limit HIC 1000 3 ms Chest Acceleration 60 g Chest Deflection 75 mm Femur Load 10 kN The above injury criteria evolved over the past thirty years and continue to do so. There are currently different proposals for updated injury criteria. These proposals include the* neck and lower leg regions in addition to head and thorax. The proposed criteria are as follows: • Head HIC &lt; 1000 (contact), otherwise neck criteria applies. • Neck Axial load as shown in figure 2. Shear load as shown in figure 3.

From the Wayne State Tolerance Curves (WSTC) to Gadd's Severity Index (SI) to the HIC based on cadaver and human volunteer testing. Side impact injury criteria, however, are still at its infancy compared to frontal impact criteria. Table 2 summarizes these criteria and highlights the differences between the Federal (FMVSS 214) and European (ECE-R48) requirements [4].

Table 3 illustrates these differences.

The automotive community worldwide is currently focusing on the issue of international harmonization. This is intended to eliminate or minimize differences in the regulations between the United States and Europe. This would definitely be beneficial for the growing automotive markets in Asia and South America. SYSTEM INTEGRATION This new definition of the vehicle occupant restraint system formalizes the process of restraint system design and development. With all the activities focusing on the same objective of reducing the occupants' potential for injury during vehicle crashes, tasks can be split and coordinated between different design groups. 2048</page><page sequence="5">Symposium on International Automotive Technology '96 This will also streamline the communication across the different groups responsible for such a development. The communication flow is to follow the same pattern as the restraint system definition diagram in figure 1 . It is the responsibility of the system integrator to ensure an adequate level of communication across the different functions. The system integrator function has been traditionally assumed by the vehicle manufacturer. This is changing rapidly and many of the OEM are looking for complete restraint system suppliers that will also be responsible for the system integration. This restraint system definition is flexible since it is independent of technologies or regulations. The individual components are permitted to change in response to the introduction of new technologies. The output of the system can be adjusted also to meet new regulations. An example of the above is the introduction of the intelligent restraint systems. By incorporating these features into the restraint system definition diagram, it facilitates correct system integration. The process of designing a restraint system relies heavily on computer simulation and testing. Vehicle crashes are primarily required to develop the crash sensor calibration and to define the crash pulse. This information is then used to build a computer model for occupant simulation purposes, and to construct a test buck for the purpose of sled testing. Multiple iterations of computer simulation and sled testing are then conducted to optimize the performance of the restraint system. At the completion of the design, production components will be tested in another series of vehicle crashes as means of verifying the performance of the system. The development of the system takes into consideration the 5th and 95th percentile dummies in addition to the standard 50th percentile. It also checks the performance at the upper and lower limits of different components. The final computer model is then used to ensure that production continuously meets performance objectives. INTELLIGENT RESTRAINT SYSTEM As of May 1996 there have been 20 children, up to age 9, that have been killed by passenger airbags. There have also been 15 drivers that have been killed by the driver airbag, 12 of them being small females sitting close to the steering wheel. Although airbags have saved many lives, they require space to deploy. They are also designed to protect people of adult height, not children. The above is driving the industry towards a system that can recognize the occupant size and position. This information is then used to alter the characteristics of that system. The intelligent restraint system can also monitor the crash mode and severity and alter the system characteristics accordingly. In addition, it detects whether the occupant is belted to again adjust the system characteristics. Finally it will sense the presence of children and disable the airbag if it is deemed that the risk of bag deployment exceeds the benefits gained by that deployment. The block diagram of the restraint system shown in figure 6 is the same diagram in figure 1 but modified to reflect the intelligent restraint system definition. The addition of the feedback loop to create a closed loop system is the fundamental basis for an intelligent restraint system. The fundamental elements of an intelligent restraint system are as follows: 1 . Altering the system characteristics. 2. Detecting and categorizing the occupant. 3. Characterizing the crash in terms of direction and severity. 4. Sensing the state of the restraint system components. The basic difference that exists between the intelligent restraint system and the automatic feedback control theory stems from the fact that current inflator technology does not permit for a change in the deployment characteristics after the inflator has been initiated. As an alternative, a predetermined decision based on the crash characteristics and occupant configuration has to be made prior to the Sensor System | Crash A u Kinematics lnput^ Vehicle ^ Κλ ^ Restraint ^ Vehicle QuļPut Structure System Occupant t I t f ' Bumper system £ Airbag system Occupant size Frame rails &amp; Wheel /Column Seating position Pillar design c Belt system 0ut of positjon Floor pan design 2 Seat system Qhjļcj seats Toeboard design g Knee bolster Belt configuration Rocker &amp; roof rail CC Support structure , , .

Automotive Technology !96 deployment of either the airbag or the pretensiones Current means of altering the bag deployment characteristics is the use of multiple inflators. The delay between deploying these inflators as well as which infiators to be deployed can be used to tailor the airbag deployment. Figure 7 shows a tank curve obtained by deploying two inflators simultaneously vs. deploying them with a 1 0 ms delay in between. It clearly shows a more gentle rise in the pressure without sacrificing the peak pressure and timing. The slower rise in the tank pressure implies a gentler bag deployment characteristics which is beneficial to the out of position occupant. The proper peak pressure and timing also insures adequate levels of protection provided to the normally seated occupant. Figure 7 : Effect of Staging on Tank Curves SUMMARY The flexibility of this new definition permits its expansion to adopt any future regulations and expectations. It also allows for the monitoring of the system output and measuring it against a certain threshold to create an error or deviation function to alter the system characteristics. This is to achieve the optimal protection for a range of crash and occupant scenarios in addition to a variety of restraint system configurations.
