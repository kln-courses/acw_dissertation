Douglas, Implicit Meanings Introduction The spring month of Magh heralds festivals, pilgrimages and popular rituals in the north Indian countryside. In i872, the small village Bhaini, in Ludhiana district, was the scene of feverish activity. Par- ticipants in a millenarian community popularly known as Kukas had collected there in connection with the spring festivities on the i and I2 ofJanuary. They had, however, very little to celebrate. In the past four months nine of their numbers had been hanged by the colonial authorities on charges of attacking slaughter houses and killing butchers, others had been imprisoned, and many more were subjected to increasing surveillance and restrictions. British officials nervously shifted their views of the Kukas. Earlier seen as religious reformers within the Sikh tradition, they were now deemed to be political rebels.' As those present felt heavily suspect in the eyes of the administration, the atmosphere at Bhaini must have been tense and unnerving. I am extremely grateful to Peter Harnetty, Susana B. C. Devalle and James Scott for having read an earlier draft of this essay, and for having made many helpful criticisms and suggestions. The usual disclaimers apply. This perspective is clearly reflected in Memorandum on Ram Singh and the Kukas by J. W.

The next day, en route to their destination, the Kuka crowd raided the fort of Malodh, the residence of a Sikh aristocrat related to the Maharaja of Patiala, possibly to avenge through his affine the anti-Kuka policies of the Maharaja and equip themselves with arms and horses. The insurgents met with little material success. Next morning, on I5 Janu- ary, when a band of approximately I20 Kuka Sikhs attempted against all odds to invade the town of Malerkotla, they were repulsed by trained and well armed state troops. The same afternoon an armed contingent from the Sikh principality of Patiala succeeded in captur- ing sixty-eight Kukas from the raiding party. They were brought to Malerkotla where L. Cowan the Officiating Deputy-Commissioner of Ludhiana district, following the hardened traditions of the Punjab school of administration, had forty-nine of them blown away from guns without the niceties of a legal trial. The next day T. D. Forsyth, Commissioner of the Ambala Division, on joining his subordinate, had sixteen more Kukas blown from guns, but this time after the formalities of a brief trial. These drastic measures earned the Kukas a hallowed place in the text-books of modern Indian history and also made them a part of the 'heroic' Sikh tradition. Why did a small party of Kuka Sikhs attack the state of Malerkotla? What was the source of their confidence which made them feel invin- cible against a superior political-military power? Answers to these questions have not been lacking since the Kuka movement reached its climax on the parade ground of Malerkotla. The first to respond were British officials who proposed a simple and straightforward theory to vindicate their actions and the fair name of English justice. In British eyes, the kingdom of Maharaja Ranjit Singh was a Sikh state. Its annexation meant the Sikhs had lost their superior status in the Punjab and a proud community was humiliated. To avenge their disgraceful defeat and regain past glories Sikhs were constantly on the look out for the first available opportunity to overthrow the British rule. The Kuka movement under the leadership of Ram Singh was a direct manifestation of this basic urge. By suppressing it in time the authorities prevented evil designs from materializing and protected the interests of the civil society.2 2 For this interpretation see Macnabb's memorandum cited above. 158</page><page sequence="3">BROTHERHOOD OF THE PURE A second interpretation of the Kuka actions is advanced by nationalist historians. For them the Kukas provided a ready-made illustration of how the Indian people waged war against British imperialism almost immediately after their territories had been unjustly annexed. The Kuka struggle was thus part of the gigantic all- India struggle for freedom from British colonial oppression. As such, it deserved to be highlighted and commended.3 In retrospect, it is not hard to see through the ideological justifica- tions of British apologists and the persistent efforts of nationalist historians to incorporate all sorts of social movements under the nationalist banner. But no alternative perspective was available until quite recently, when W. H. McLeod re-examined the available materials. With refreshing vigour he broke clear of existing ortho- doxies and offered an alternative theory, showing how the Kuka movement constituted a millenarian response emerging from specific socio-economic circumstances, particularly a tremendous rise in population, the failure of the harvest leading to a famine, and the presence of a discontented peasantry, features present in most mil- lenarian uprisings. Significantly, McLeod also noted the striking similarities of the Kuka movement with millenarian stirrings in other parts of the world.4 Existing studies of the Kukas, while demonstrating the various facets of the movement, its political dynamics and its close connection with social conditions, much in line with the dominant historiography of Indian nationalism, have shown greater interest in exploring prag- matic themes rather than the semantic aspects. They help us firmly to grasp the underlying causes of the movement and define its character, an essential task for any study, but tell us little of what the movement meant for the participants themselves. To interpret the actors' objec- tives, their own structures of consciousness and experience, is as cru- cial as locating the major causes and features of a social movement. Such an exercise requires a study of imagery, symbols, metaphors and codes of behaviour, elements which have not been considered, in earlier studies, as the socio-political circumstances. But if we neglect the former it is hard to understand fully the discourses of Ram Singh 3 This line of thought is clearly seen in Fauja Singh Bajwa, Kuka Movement: An Important Phase in Punjab's Role in India's Struggle for Freedom (Delhi, 1965), M.

In a letter to his disciples, Ram Singh prophesied: 'on a Sunday midnight locks will open and two suns shall appear on the horizon, one on the left and the other on the right. A white elephant will descend on earth .. ..5 The message loaded with symbolic language is meaningless without a semiotic analysis. Kaisra Singh, a Kuka Sikh, recorded before he was blown away from a gun at Malerkotla parade grounds I went to Bhainee for the Maghee Mela [fair]. I sat near where Heera Singh and Lehna Singh were. They did not advise me to join in any enterprise. God put it into my heart to go with them.... I left Bhainee with them. We went together to Ruboo, and from Ruboo to Malodh. God ordered me to go there. No one else told me ... I had not even a stick. I then came with the party to Kotlah. I came inside the town to the palace gate. I was in fight before the treasury, but had no arms ... We came to Kotlah by God's order to kill the slayers of kine ...6 (emphasis added). Kaisra Singh was hardly an exception among the Kuka insurgents. Their ranks were crowded with men who shared similar beliefs-who staunchly believed that their cause was just and that they possessed the power to challenge the alien Raj and its collaborators. For God was on their side, he spoke to them, and they were following his directives. This essay examines the phenomenology of such deeply held beliefs in order to answer such questions as: What convictions made people die for their religion? How does religion play a role in resistance? Why are apocalyptic visions believed in? What evokes the moral indignation of communities? In Pursuit of Holiness Holiness, a fundamental concern of religions, is a difficult concept to define but, as a preliminary definition, it stands here for a complex of ideas which endows individuals, texts, time, places, institutions and communities with a distinct power and quality of sanctity that dis- tinguishes them from the rest of civil society. The term holiness also includes the meanings evoked by the word sacred and in common practice the two words are often used as synonymous. But as distinct from the sacred, holiness has a moral code inscribed into it, a code that informs of those values, beliefs, concepts and symbols through 5 Reproduced in Ganda Singh, Kuikian di Vithid (Amritsar, 1944), letter no. 4, p. 25, my translation (hereafter Vithia). 6 Examination of the accused number 3, Kaisra Singh in 'Copy of the Cor- respondence, or Extracts from Correspondence, relating to Kooka outbreak', Parliamentary Papers, vol. 45, 1872, p. 43. i6o</page><page sequence="5">BROTHERHOOD OF THE PURE which a community conceives what is just, legitimate and virtuous. The power of this moral order largely arose from its nexus with the sacred. Holiness, with a moral order encapsulated within it, helped people distinguish the pure from the impure, the right from the wrong, and the sacred from the profane, thereby establishing moral codes of individual and collective conduct.7 Those who violated its standards were subjected to the intense rage and indignation of the community, expressed through words, gestures, rumour, signs and, occasionally, weapons. These traditional sanctions against the transgressors of the holy order were easily com- municated and comprehended by the constituents of the local society but were not that easily decoded by external observers. For instance, the British officials saw in many of the Kuka actions a primitive mind at work, while for the community their punitive acts were derived from the store house of expressive tradition. The argument which follows places the holy order and its defence at the centre of the analysis of the Kuka movement. The Kukas did not create the holy order they so zealously chose to pursue; they only extended and interpreted it. The evolution of the Kukas into a 'sect' within the Sikh tradition and their singling out in British files has heavily coloured the readings of the early history of the Kukas. Consequently, it occasionally appears as if their ideology suddenly materialized out of nowhere and was without deep roots in their society. Such a view is erroneous. It is useful for the orthodox Sikh tradition which seeks to view Kukas as a marginal sect that went astray but not permissible historically if one particularly studies them in relation to the larger Sikh society. The Kuka cosmology concerning a holy person, purity, right conduct, dress and food taboos, and sacredness had a long history, both within the Sikh tradition and in the larger framework of the Indic culture.8 7 On the importance of a moral order for peasant societies particularly in the 'economic' domain see the well known work of James C. Scott, The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia (New Haven, 1976). For its ramifi- cations in the Indian sphere see Barbara Daly Metcalf (ed.), Moral Conduct and Authority (California, I984), pp. 1-22. Although she surveys the importance of the moral order in Islam, her study can illuminate similar concepts among other Indian traditions. 8 I have often used the term Kuka Sikhs here because the differences between the Kukas and the Sikhs had not fully crystallized in the nineteenth century and the two categories often overlapped. This is one reason why the British authorities found it so hard to judge the exact number of Kukas in the Punjab. But at the same time it must be acknowledged there were certain differences between sectors of the Sikh tradition and the Kukas, particularly doctrinal ones, which came to a head when Ram Singh visited the Anandpur shrine. I6I</page><page sequence="6">HARJOT OBEROI If we accept Sikh tradition, in 1708 Gobind Singh, before his death, decided to abolish the two-century old line of human Gurus and instead make the Adi Granth the future Guru of the Sikhs, thereby endowing the young community with a source of both cohesion and conflict.9 Solidarity was achieved because the community was left with a common object of veneration and a scripture to guide the faithful, particularly in periods of trial, but discord was also a conse- quence for hundreds of pages of verse in the holy book were open to conflicting interpretations. The evolving tradition was partially saved from this fundamental source of discord and strife by the important tradition of the bhiis dating back to the early Sikh movement. Etymologically the word bhai means brother but within the early Sikh tradition the word was also used as an honorific for the holy men of the Panth.'1 To qualify for the title a person had to demonstrate a capacity to interpret the Adi Granth, communicate the wisdom of the Gurus it enshrined and be publicly recognized for his piety. If in addition he could work miracles, heal the sick, and give succour to the distressed he was sure to occupy a position of considerable reverence and authority within the community. Such fully realized men were sometimes also honoured with the appellation baba. However, it must be noted here that in the nineteenth century the epithet bhai was also used for the men who acted as professional readers of the Adi Granth. 1 The concept of bhai is as old as the Sikh faith. Among the first to earn the title and respect of a bhii, probably the progenitor of the whole bhai tradition, was Bhai Buddha (1571-1631). A disciple of Guru Nanak from the time of the Kartarpur community, he was a contemporary of seven Sikh Gurus and installed four of them to the Guruship. It appears he was also consulted in the compilation of the Adi Granth. Equally important, if not more crucial, for the foundation of the bhai tradition was Gurdas Bhalla (1558?-I636). Well known for his work as a scribe, and amanuensis of the Adi Granth, he also 9 Adi Granth is the title of the principal Sikh scripture compiled by Guru Arjan in I603-04. '0 The Sanskrit word panth (literally path or road) is used to designate groups in India following particular teachers or doctrines. The early Sikh community was thus known as Nanak-panth or 'followers of Nanak'. Later generations increasingly drop- ped the prefix, with the result that the community came to be known as simply, 'the Panth'. This remains the preferred title today, in English usage as in Hindi or Punjabi. " R. C. Temple, 'Honorific Class Names in the Punjab', Indian Antiquary I , 1882, p. I 8. I62</page><page sequence="7">BROTHERHOOD OF THE PURE authored commentaries on the compositions of the Sikh Gurus. The latter task he performed so well that his exegetical works are known as 'the key to Guru Granth Sahib' or the Sikh scripture. Possibly since the days of Gurdas Bhalla, popularly known as Bhai Gurdas, the faculty of expounding on the teachings of the Sikh Gurus has been woven into the definition of a bhai, and bhais have been honoured as embodiments of the holy. In the chronicles of the Sikhs after Bhai Gurdas, the following are prominent: Bhai Nand Lal, a poet closely associated with the tenth Sikh preceptor; Bhai Mani Singh, a renowned martyr; Bhai Vasti Ram, famed for his miraculous powers to heal the sick; Bhai Sant Singh, a tutor of Majaraja Ranjit Singh; Bhai Ram Singh, at one time a prime-minister of the Lahore state; Bhai Gobind Ram, a member of the Lahore court; Bhai Gurmukh Singh, a confidant of Maharaja Sher Singh; Bhai Bir Singh, a guide to the Sikh nobility and subalterns alike; and Bhai Maharaj Singh, a resolute opponent of the British. The holiness of Bhais Vasti Ram and his grandson Ram Singh elevated them to the position of chief arbiters in the affairs of the Sikh state. Maharaja Ranjit Singh believed he owed his kingdom to the bless- ings of Bhai Vasti Ram, a figure of phenomenal piety and learning in the eighteenth century.12 Ranjit Singh's conviction not only illustrates the centrality of a holy person in the Sikh tradition but also exempli- fies another key concept of the Sikh community: blessings. Blessings from a holy man could rectify worldly misfortunes, ward off evil and help overcome human shortcomings. In I799, when faced with the combined forces of leading Sikh chieftains outside the city of Lahore, the Maharaja turned to Bhai Vasti Ram for advice and blessings. Victorious in the battle, his conviction of Vasti Ram's holiness was further confirmed. The Bhai's death in I803 cut short his career, but his progeny amply enjoyed the bounties of the state. Bhti Ram Singh, a grandson, was given such great deference that he was the only person allowed a seat in the presence of the Maharaja.'3 He was a scholar of Sanskrit, proficient in Persian, with ample skills in medi- cine, and his counsel was sought on a variety of issues: the politics of the court, the policy towards the British, treatment of the Sikh feudatories and the crowning of Ranjit Singh's heirs. Under Kanwar Nau Nihal Singh the Bhai was made prime-minister, and six months 12 Kirpal Singh, An Historical Account of Bhai Vasti Ram and Bhai Ram Singh (Amrit- sar, n.d.), p. 9. 13 Ibid., p. 17.

Another famous bhai lineage in central Punjab was that of the Bhais of Bagarian, an old Sikh family dating back to the time of the Sikh Gurus. Of humble Tarkhan origins, their close association with Sikh Gurus greatly enhanced their social standing and earned them much religious merit. In the seventeenth century they were given the title bhai by Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh guru, for their exemplary service and unflinching devotion to the Sikh cause. The family was renowned in Malwa for their piety, works of charity and propagation of Sikhism.14 The rites de passage for the Sikh princes were conducted by the head of the Bagarian family. He was also approached in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by the princes for religious instruction and blessings. The Bagarian Bhais endowed one of the largest lafigars (kitchens attached to a shrine) in the province in their ancestral village at Ludhiana; it fed a constant stream of travellers, pilgrims and rural poor without distinctions of caste or creed.'5 From the time of Bhai Gurdas, a poet and scribe to the Bhais of Bagarian religious and political mentor of Maharajas, the tradition of the bhais, although never canonized, had become deeply rooted and attracted wide veneration. An average Sikh in the nineteenth century con- sidered the person of a bhai holy, sacred, and inviolable. But bhais were not only born to established families, they could be recognized, exalted, and endowed by the Sikh public. Ram Singh, the leader of the Kuka Sikhs in the second half of the nineteenth century, became a leading representative of this ancient Sikh tradition and effectively harnessed it to launch a powerful mil- lenarian movement. Although the Kukas today use the honorific Guru for Ram Singh, the prefix employed by Ram Singh himself was bhai.16 Placed outside the ambience of this hallowed lineage, historians are hard pressed to explain how the humble Ram Singh, a one-time carpenter and soldier, succeeded in making tens of thousands flock to his standard.

I will try to reconstruct it but, without reference to the paradigm of the bhais, it is hard to enter the world the Kuka Sikhs constructed for themselves. Very little is known about the early life of Ram Singh.Y7 He was born in 1816, in a humble rural family-his father was a carpenter in the village of Bhaini in Ludhiana district. Assisting his father in daily chores, the child Ram Singh grew up memorizing several composi- tions from the Adi Granth, reciting from the scriptures and acquiring a working knowledge of Panjabi. He may have received some formal education at the hands of a local learned man. By the time he was twenty, like many other young men of his age, he left his village to join an army regiment, named after Prince Nau Nihal Singh, the grandson of Ranjit Singh. During his service years he met Bhai Balak Singh whose personality, convictions, teachings, and vision, so impressed him that he became an ardent disciple. Although Bhai Balak Singh had been influenced by another teacher, Jawahar Mal, for the Kukas the line of their masters only starts with Balak Singh, who is con- sidered the eleventh Guru after Gobind Singh and in a sense the founder of the movement. Just before the Anglo-Sikh war of I845, Ram Singh left the army and returned to his native place to work as a sharecropper. In his thirty-fourth year he once again left Bhaini, this time for Ferozepore to work for an uncle who had undertaken to repair a fort and various other buildings. During his stay there legends record his powers to work miracles. According to one account, one Sunday Ram Singh was employed to put a roof on a poor man's house in Ferozepore city. One of the beams proved a foot too short, and the owner begged Ram Singh to remedy the defect without oblig- ing him to buy a new beam, which was more than he could afford. Ram Singh thereupon by his miraculous powers expanded the beam to the required length without adding to it-the beam had grown a foot. According to F. A. Steel, who recorded the above legend, 'hun- dreds of persons in Ferozepore will attest the above tale, many being eye-witnesses and the house can be shown to the curious'.18 It is significant that the legend concludes by stating that on the day of this 17 This brief biographical note is based on Ganda Singh, Vithid and Nahar Singh, Ndmdhdrz Itihds (Delhi, I955), (hereafter Itihds).

Clearly, in popular sentiment there was a connection between miracles and the sanctity accorded to Ram Singh as a bhai and the recognition of his teachings. Recognizing the elements of holiness in Ram Singh was for many a means of earning religious merit, a claim he never explicitly makes but is granted by others. This process of recognition by the Sikh masses is acknowledged by Ram Singh in a letter: 'first Sikhs generally recognized Bir Singh, then Maharaj Singh and now me'.19 The uncharted domain of miracles has much to tell us about faith, beliefs and consciousness in nineteenth-century Punjab. To some of us today, with the arrogance of our intellectual assumptions, miracles may appear to be inventions or signs of credulity; for those who believed in them they possessed a rationality of their own and func- tioned within a system of cultural references they understood. Ram Singh was no ordinary mortal and so he could do what common men could not. Miracles ascribed to him gave credence to his prophetic status. When he was absorbed in early morning meditation, it was believed a bright light could be seen perambulating his head.20 The sign of a light around the head has for long in the histories of religions indicated the holiness of a person. Two years before the Uprising of 1857, Ram Singh returned to his native Bhaini and opened a shop dealing in food grains and iron implements. At the same time he collected around him a core group of associates and disciples, most of whom were demobilized soldiers from the former regiments of the Lahore state. From this nucleus were to emerge many of the prominent Kukas of the future. For the benefit of a growing number of adherents who visited Bhaini, Ram Singh, in line with Sikh tradition, set up a langar. In I862, when Bhia Balak Singh died at Hazro, Ram Singh emerged as one of his three suc- cessors.21 By now he manifested the major characteristics of a Bhai: the ability to expound on scriptures, piety and a demonstrated capa- city to work miracles. These features confirmed for his followers that Ram Singh was a holy man whose rise had in fact been predicted in the current prophecies. Let us now turn to what Ram Singh preached to his growing following. What was his message? If there is one theme that pervades his teachings it is the opposition between pure and impure.22 Such a recurrent concern on the part of 9 Ganda Singh, Vithid, letter number 44, p. 302. 20 Nahar Singh, Itihds, p. 46. 21 Ganda Singh, Vithid, pp. 17-18. 22 On how the pure impure antinomy has influenced different cultures see Mary Doublas, Purity and Danger (London, 1966). I66</page><page sequence="11">BROTHERHOOD OF THE PURE I67 Ram Singh may appear to be novel, particularly because interpreta- tions of the Sikh movement always emphasize how Sikhism freed itself of ritual concerns, discounting ideas of purity and impurity. While it is correct that the polarity between purity and impurity as an organiz- ing principle of society exemplified in the Hindu caste system was questioned by the Sikh movement, it must not be overlooked that the Sikhs have always paid great attention to notions of ritual purity both individual and corporate.23 The third Sikh Guru, Amar Das (I479- I574), constructed a baoli or water tank at Goindwal where the Sikhs would go for pilgrimage and bathe in the waters of the tank, thereby ridding themselves of impurities. All major Sikh shrines, including the famous Golden Temple, were to continue with this tradition. On being built, a large water tank was added to their structures where the pilgrims would dutifully undertake ritual purification by immersing themselves in the holy waters of the tank. The purificatory powers of water are universally recognized and in the Indian cultural tradition have always been particularly significant; thus the great tradition of acquiring merit by bathing in the river Ganges. M. Eliade, one of the most creative phenomenologists of this century, notes several features associated with water in religious thinking: it breaks and dissolves all forms, does away with the past, and purifies and regenerates; in short, it is a symbol of renewal.24 All visitors to a Sikh shrine, from very early in the history of the Panth but certainly by the nineteenth century, were required to take off their shoes, if they wore any, and subsequently wash their feet and hands before entering the shrine. Once again this practice illustrates very well Sikh concerns for purity and the efforts to eliminate dirt. The space outside the temple is considered dirty and unclean. To get into the shrine one must undergo cleansing by leaving behind soiled footwear and particularly wash those parts of the body that are con- stantly exposed to the outside world. The dirt encountered outside is not merely that of soil, excrement and germs, but is a cultural notion embedded in spatial classification. To venture outside means being exposed to pollution, particularly from other people; to gain access to a place where purity is believed to be concentrated it is mandatory to 23 Sikh concerns with purity and pollution are clearly reflected in the Sau sdkhzdn anthology circulated within the community in the nineteenth century. In a list of sixty-four injunctions in the anthology, several are concerned with the maintenance of purity.

Today, all major Sikh shrines, reflecting the old custom, have attendants at the entrance who collect visitors' shoes before they are allowed in. With this background on ideas and notions of purity in Sikhism, the insistent emphases in Ram Singh's teachings on avoiding impurities of life should hardly appear surprising. They were in accord with his own religious heritage and meshed in well with the beliefs of the larger society.25 A state of purity may be a desirable ideal but the organic processes of the human body and social surroundings make its attain- ment difficult. Impurities arise out of bodily emissions, menstruation among women, rites de passage such as birth and death, certain kinds of foods and materials, and anomalous social situations. To negate these polluting forces Ram Singh elaborated a cluster of rituals which would generate purity of body, speech, food, dress and actions. An account of these follows. According to the hagiographic literature, one of the first ritual acts Ram Singh performed was the initiation of five Sikhs at Bhaini in 1857.26 In itself this was a minor happening but it marked an import- ant departure in the practice of the initiation ritual. Candidates for initiation mostly visited four or five large Sikh shrines such as the Golden Temple at Amritsar. Ram Singh changed this and literally brought the possibility of the ritual to the doorsteps of those who wanted to participate in it. Literature records how in his extensive tours of central Punjab Ram Singh conducted the initiation ritual in innumerable villages.27 In his teachings he persistently insisted on the need and importance of the initiation. How is this insistence on the initiation ritual connected to ideas of purity and impurity? The uninitiated were perceived to be in a state of religious marginality, for while they might nominally be Sikhs they had not confirmed this and were therefore liable to the dangers of impurities. In the nineteenth century these impurities, besides those flowing out of bodily processes, had to do with food, dress, speech, social associations and the viola- tion of the Sikh code of conduct. While there is rarely a direct reference to dangers we can infer from contemporary sources at least three forms of danger: being cut off from God, a major source of protection and boons; languishing in the misery of the transmigratory 25 For an early attempt at conceptualizing purity and impurity in India see an unsigned essay possibly by Louis Dumont and David F.

I68</page><page sequence="13">BROTHERHOOD OF THE PURE cycle and sometimes, the possibility of turning into a non-human or bhut. These dangers could be eliminated through initiation. An initi- ated individual stopped occupying a liminal position for he was now a part of a chosen collectivity and in his state of ritual purity was protected from what his society deemed to be impure and dangerous. But the ritual purity attained through initiation was clearly not permanent. Even if there was no direct transgression of the rules contained in the code to maintain the state of purity, an individual was daily besieged by impurities. To negate their influences Ram Singh untiringly demanded of his followers an early morning bath. It is easy to read into this stricture a call for hygiene. But it is hard to imagine a people in an agrarian society, with blazing temperatures avoiding bathing. Ram Singh is pressing towards a morally clean state and not simply for rules of hygiene. Given the overall context of his teachings, the insistence on a bath before dawn can only be explained within the framework of the purity : impurity opposition. Balak Singh, considered by the Kukas as the founder of their faith, had demanded that his disciples bathe three times a day.28 Ram Singh is known to have followed this precept of his mentor very seriously. In a rahit-niama or code of conduct, issued by him sometime in I866, to which the Kukas subscribe even today, he demanded: 'Rise during the last watch of the night and taking a pot of water [for cleansing] go out into the fields to relieve nature. When you return scour the pot twice, remove the clothes which you were wearing while in the fields, clean your teeth, bathe, and recite [the prescribed portions] of sacred scripture'.29 Defecation not only pollutes the body but also personal clothing and the water pot-objects which were in close proximity during the process. To overcome its negative influence Ram Singh recommends a thorough cleansing of the water pot, disuse of clothing before washing, and a bath. This is to be followed by the recitation of sacred scrip- tures. The same schedule is followed even today at the Kuka head- quarters in Bhaini. According to S. S. Sanehi 'a namdahri, or Kuka, living at Sri Bhaini Sahib bids good-bye to his bed at about three in the morning ...

Having taken his bath, the Kuka puts on different clothes, not those he had worn going to the toilet ...'.30 The passage of a century has hardly altered the tradition begun by Ram Singh. In order to construct a comprehensive ideology, the purity principle was further extended to encompass diet restrictions, a code for dress and several commandments for social behaviour. Bhai Ram Singh's spiritual mentor, Balak Singh, had already enjoined his followers not to eat food cooked by those outside the community of disciples and never to drink water from a leather pouch. The latter reflects the reverence for the cow and abomination for anything made out of cow hide. Kuka Sikhs were further prohibited from consuming meat or liquor and smoking tobacco. In one of his writings Ram Singh stated 'meat and liquor are the diet of mleccha. Consuming them pollutes consciousness'.31 Food taboos appear to be the most widely respected rules among the Kuka Sikhs in the nineteenth century. Before enter- ing a kitchen to cook they were expected to wash their feet.32 Food cooked or already part eaten by others was not to be partaken of by the Kuka Sikhs.33 It was polluted and therefore endangered their state of purity. Significantly, the Punjabi word employed by Bhai Ram Singh for impure foods was jhuth. It is closely associated with chut, a word Punjabis use for impurity attached to women at birth and menstruation, skin ulcers and contagious diseases. The possibility of coming into contact with these impurities (chut) is highly repugnant. When Bhai Ram Singh uses the highly suggestive word jhuth related to the cluster of meanings attached to chut, he is by analogy recom- mending that polluted food is as strictly tabooed as other impurities. According to a contemporary document, Kuka inmates at a lock-up in the Ferozepore district jail refused to eat jail-cooked food, possibly fearing pollution.34 The favoured colour for personal garments and turbans among the Kukas was white. The colour white has in many cultures the world over been considered a sign of purity. Also, Kuka Sikhs were instructed to use a rosary made of white beads.35 Disciples 30 Swaran Singh Sanehi, 'Kukas as they live' in John C. B.

They were to practise seva or service, liberal charity and not charge any interest in their financial transactions. Visiting prostitutes was prohibited.36 Those who disobeyed these commandments were not to be allowed to take part in the proceedings of the congregation. It may be mentioned here that the congregation was considered holy. Any denial to join it amounted to being cut off from a source of holiness. This discussion poses a central question: What was the reason for the considerable emphasis on ritual purity in the Kuka ideology? I have already pointed out that the Kukas shared their concern for purity with the rest of the Sikh Panth. While the Kuka notions of purity were correlated with the concept of purity and pollution as found in the caste system, the similarity did not extend much further. Caste for the Kukas was unimportant.37 They did not employ the purity : pollution opposition to assign a group of people the task of being permanent hereditary specialists in impurity so that the other members of society belonging to the 'twice-born' groups could retain their purity. In their consanguinity, marriages, commensality, and most importantly their world-view, they overturned the commonly accepted determinants of the caste system. This should not be taken to imply that they did not have any rules governing social relation- ships, only that their rules at the level of abstraction were not those of the caste hierarchy. To a certain extent the Kuka expression of pure: impure marks a historical continuity with the Sikh conceptual struc- ture briefly delineated earlier which also gave a privileged position to the same dyad and its system of meaning. The Inspector-General of Police for Punjab seems to have got to the heart of the matter. In a report he commented on how the Kukas 'appear anxious merely to revive the Sikh religion in its original state of purity and to eradicate the errors which have from time to time, defiled it'.38 Purity, as Louis Dumont and D. F. Pocock argue in an essay cited earlier is an essential prerequisite to approaching the gods. They observe: 'this does not mean their [the gods] nature is purity, 36 These moral rules are constantly reiterated in Bhai Ram Singh's correspondence and rahit-ndmas. See Ganda Singh, Vithid, pp. 223, 225, 227, 240, 245, 26I, 263, 287, 29I, 297. 37 Contemporary official reports repeatedly commented on how members of dif- ferent castes were freely admitted into the Kuka ranks. For instance see ibid., p. 29. 38 Inspector General of Police, Punjab, to Secretary to Government, Punjab, 20 January I868, Nahar Singh, KS I, p. 64. 171</page><page sequence="16">HARJOT OBEROI but that purity is a condition for the contact with them to be beneficial .. .39 It is simply a crucial requirement for relating to the gods. By upholding ritual purity, following the dictates of a strong moral code in everyday life and the cleansing of the body, in part represented the efforts of the faithful to establish a firm nexus with the sacred, build up magico-religious defences, create order out of chaos and acquire powers that ordinary people lacked. To recapitulate thus far, Kuka symbolic structure may be represented by the binary opposition purity: pollution. Underlying it was the belief that through purity one was powerful, almost invincible; in a state of impurity one was weak and susceptible. Those who were pure in the mode of the Kukas were part of the brotherhood, those who endangered purity were certainly adversaries. By the late I86os, for the Kuka Sikhs those who trans- gressed the boundaries between pure : impure were violating the moral order contained within the framework of holiness and had to be punished for their behavioural improprieties. In other words, uphold- ing holiness called for stern action on the part of the faithful. But who were the adversaries inviting the wrath of the Kukas? In Defence of Holiness From 1866 onwards the Kukas, deeply committed to their world view and with an unshakeable belief that the forces of the cosmos were on their side, spent their energies assailing those they saw as responsible for violating the conceptual principles of holiness. Increasing numbers of reports from district police chiefs kept pouring in to the provincial headquarters informing how Kukas were desecrating, demolishing and destroying village shrines and other sacred ancestral sites in the countryside. One such report sent by an official from Ferozepore district stated: 'some tombs40 lying between the boundaries of the village of Chuhar Bhainee and Choote Borrshoo were destroyed about the st September, i866 by Wariam Singh, Futteh Singh and Jymal Singh Kookahs. One of the tombs had been erected to the memory of one Sungoor Singh a man held in reverence by the neighbouring villages'.41 The police in Lahore, alarmed, informed their superiors 39 Dumont and Pocock, 'Pure and Impure', p. 31. 40 Contemporary officials used the word tomb loosely without distinguishing between a grave, shrine or ancestral site. 41 From T.

By the time the police had caught up with the suspects and the investigating detective, Christie, had proudly claimed that he had solved the crime, butcher families in the town of Raikot were attacked on I July and three people were killed. To the further embarrassment of the authori- ties, it turned out that the persons apprehended for the Amritsar attack were innocent and had been forced to confess the crime due to third degree methods employed by the police. Now events moved quickly. Exactly a month after the Raikot killings, three Kuka Sikhs held guilty for the murders there were hanged in August outside the slaughter house of Raikot. A month later four of the accused in the Amritsar case were hanged and two of them were transported for life. On 27 November I87I, two more Kuka Sikhs were hanged on charges of abetting the Raikot murders. Barely two months later in January I872, an irregular mass of Kuka Sikhs started on their famous march to Malerkotla, which ended in the tragic disaster, detailed at the beginning of this essay. These seemingly bizarre episodes have caused much confusion among historians. Contemporary scholarship finds it hard to untangle the mystery of why the Sikhs should have taken on themselves to protect the cow, particularly in a period when many of their brethren would soon be proclaiming Hindu-Sikh distinctions. Picking up what was visibly a Hindu sacred symbol would hardly have helped any enterprise wanting to etablish the independent identity of the Sikhs. Deciphering targets of civil violence and symbolic protest originating from religious communities is never simple, particularly because the unlettered activists do not leave behind textual records containing an account of their motives and actions. For contemporary police and military officials tutored in a colonial epistemology which highlighted crime and insurrection as the major motivations of indigenous population, comprehending Kuka actions was not too difficult. Using their evocative vocabulary, they categorized Kuka actions as foolish, 42 Inspector General of Police Punjab to Secretary to Government of Punjab, 20 January I868, in Nahar Singh, KS, I, p. 70. I73</page><page sequence="18">dangerous, evil, criminal and premature. Nationalist historians, as pointed out earlier, read in them the imprint of an anti-imperialist consciousness. A more recent historiographical approach questions this interpretation, claiming that the 'victims of the Kuka's verbal and physical attacks were nearly all fellow Punjabis, not Englishmen'.43 The obsessive concern among historians whether the targets chosen were anti-British or not is misplaced. This debate diverts attention away from the more fundamental problems such as why did the Kukas choose to attack and kill butchers rather than local officials, members of police or moneylenders-the frequent victims of peasant jacqueries in nineteenth-century north India? What were the Kuka Sikhs trying to communicate to their fellow comrades in civil society when they decided to act as the defenders of the cow? What was the raison d'etre behind desecrating village sacred spots and demolishing ancestral shrines instead of attacking civil courts, police stations and railway-yards-the obvious targets for nationalist insurgents. These issues cannot be answered if the locations of Kuka sacrilege and violence are analyzed in isolation. This is perhaps one reason why Kuka responses appear to many historians to be incoherent, spon- taneous and ill-conceived. But to be meaningful they have to be treated as a part of a cultural system for even madness, to paraphrase Edmund Leach, has an order.44 It is the task of a historian to discern that order. In the present case that order was embedded, to use semiotic terminology, in a cultural code that was made up of the antinomy between purity: pollution. Once we place the indices of the Kuka actions within the parameters of this code it becomes easier to recover at least some of their shadowy meanings. But before doing so it is imperative firmly to distinguish the two types of protest actions undertaken by the Kuka Sikhs, for their referents are different although interdependent and occasionally perhaps sponsored by the same activists. In the first instance the moral indignation of the Kuka Sikhs was directed against ancestral shrines normally located at the edge of the village boundaries and other sacred sites associated with men who had been deified in their localities. In the second case Kuka Sikhs directed their violence against kine-slaughtering butchers and their families. What was the logic behind these two different sets of ventures? 43 Andrew J. Major, 'Return to Empire: The Sikhs and the British in the Punjab I839-I872', unpublished PhD thesis, The Australian National University, Canberra, 1981, p. 320. 44 Edmund Leach, Culture and Communication (Cambridge, 1976), p. 39. HARJOT OBEROI I74</page><page sequence="19">BROTHERHOOD OTHEHE PURE It was a common convention among Sikhs in the countryside, along with the local Hindus and Muslims frequently to visit khanaqahs (major shrines of Muslim saints), pirkhanas (minor shrines of Muslim saints), jatheras (cremation sites of village ancestors), mazars (Muslim tombs), kabars (graves), and samadhs (tombs associated with Sikh and Hindu holy men).45 The visits to these sacred village sites were undertaken for healing illness, procuring a son, curing cattle of disease and quite often as propitiatory village rites. The ancestral shrines located on the boundaries of Punjab villages were seen to protect those villages from malignant spirits and other evil forces. At regular seasonal intervals through the year these ancestors were propitiated by the village inhabitants. In the eyes of orthodox Sikhs this, of course, amounted to a serious breach of the teachings of the Sikh masters who had consistently stressed the futility of worship- ping at such shrines. Sikhism preached the interiorization of faith. Ram Singh delivered a similar message in his sermons. A perceptive colonial official recorded 'the Kukas have no respect for tombs, tem- ples or shrines, they are also iconoclasts'.46 These iconoclastic doctrines noticed by the British observer were effectively demonstrated to the public when the Kuka Sikhs decided to desecrate and defile village sites. A proverb current among them stated 'raze marhi and masani [sacred spots located at village cre- mation grounds and generally related to lineage ancestors] to the ground'.47 A report lodged by the district administration at Ludhiana clearly illustrates Kuka goals and methods: The Deputy Inspector of Police at Dehlon reported that twenty-seven graves had been destroyed at a village named Khuttree Koseh; the parties suspected were four Muzbee Kookas (Khazana, Kana, Bussawa Singh and Bahadur Singh). These graves or Murrees are the sites where the cremation of the bodies take place. After burning the body the ashes are collected and a small heap or mound is made, which is plastered over with mud; these may be seen outside every Hindoo village. The graves the four men injured were those of their own friends and relatives. The deed was done in the middle of the day, so that no difficulty was experienced in obtaining evidence and the accused were sent for trial ...48 45 For sake of convenience in the rest of this section I will be calling these various sacred spots simply village sites. 46 Foreign Departmental Political, 8 October i866, in Nahar Singh, KS, I, p. 28. 47 Quoted in T. H. Thornton to J. W. S. Wyllie (see fn. 41), my translation. 48 From Inspector General of Police, Punjab to Secretary to Government, Punjab, number 11-188, 20 January i868, Nahar Singh, KS, I, pp. 70-1. The usage of the term grave here conveys a misleading impression. As the report itself indicates these were not graves but marhis constructed at the cremation grounds. I75</page><page sequence="20">HARJOT OBEROI Three points that the report shares with other such reports must be highlighted. First, Kuka reasoning seems to be that a powerful way of questioning the sacredness and power of these village sites was to demolish them and show to the rural population that the Kuka zealots remained unharmed after the sacrilege. Second, they went about their task during broad daylight when their actions would easily be noticed by others. The aim of the whole exercise appears to be to preach through deeds and wean rural folk away from the practice of worship- ping at village sites. In the absence of alternative channels of com- munication, the desecration of village sites became an effective mode of advertising the Kuka cause. Third, the targets against which the Kuka Sikhs directed their wrath were associated with their own lineage and probably frequented by fellow clan members for worship. These village sites, it may be reiterated, were mutually shared for worship by all village inhabitants-Sikh, Muslim and Hindu-par- ticularly if they were efficacious in granting boons. These kinds of action, demonstrating the profanity of village sites, seem to have peaked by 1867. After this year there is almost no mention of them in official records. This examination still leaves us with the task of explaining the second type of violence directed against the butchers, and the fateful march to the tiny principality of Malerkotla. The meaning of this second type of action is to be found in the strategies and insensitive policies of the 'unholy British Raj'. From the Kuka viewpoint its nature can be best exemplified by their contrasting attitudes towards the sanctity of the cow. For the Kukas colonial rule switched the existing cultural codes, producing an ambiguity in the given classificatory system governing purity : pollution/sacred : profane/morality: immorality/holy: unholy. The new Christian rulers of Punjab found it hard to appre- hend many of the old customary categories regulating social behaviour. As representatives of the most advanced nation on earth, extremely confident in their utilitarian ideology, possessed of an unbounded evangelical zeal, they had little patience with other people's world views and were keen on imposing their own norms and standards. Having annexed the Lahore state after two stiff wars they had little to fear and were in a mood to innovate despite political risks. The 'Punjab school of administration', charged with messianic fervour, was determined to present Punjab as a model state for the rest of the Empire, almost as if it had been ordained by God. Reform, progress and civilization were the three key terms in the vocabulary of the British men asked to administer the newly conquered frontier province. Christian missionaries, English educators and British offi- 176</page><page sequence="21">BROTHERHOOD OF THE PURE cials were given a free rein to experiment with their subjects, spread the new civilizing doctrines, and reshape the rustic Punjabis. This imperial trinity spared no efforts to purge old customs and impose Victorian ethics, all in the name of God or enlightenment. In the process of changing the face of the land they quite unwittingly rup- tured the symbolic order underpinning local society, generating cultural conflicts British authority would find hard to comprehend or contain. Unlike the case of earlier empires, political legitimacy was no longer sought in the normative categories of an indigenous culture but in an imperial ideology mixed with racism, superior moral purpose and an arrogant repudiation of local cultural mores.49 The new rulers did not seek approval or justification for their actions against gods they considered pagan, holy men they thought were crazy, and Orien- tal beliefs they dismissed as irrational. Men of great piety, who had once been at the top of the social apex under the Sikh Raj, were now easily dispensed with. Those at the bottom, without any ritual stand- ing but useful as political collaborators, were given ample privileges and command posts. Departures from accepted political conventions deeply ingrained in a system of local cultural references and a sym- bolic sacred order may best be exemplified by the contrasting attitudes between sectors of the local population and the English administration on the issue of cow slaughter in the Punjab. Although the belief in the sacredness of the cow is widespread today among Hindus and Sikhs, the history of how it came to be considered sacred and why killing a cow became taboo is less easily understood.50 The cow was frequently alluded to in Vedic texts. By the early Vedic 49 On how the British administration repeatedly tried to disassociate its political authority from the local religious culture in the Punjab, although often without any success, see IanJ. Kerr, 'British relationships with the Golden Temple, I849-90', The Indian Economic and Social History Review 21, 1984, pp. I39-51 and David Paul Gilmartin, 'Tribe, Land and Religion in the Punjab: Muslim Politics and the Making of Pakistan', PhD thesis, University of California, Berkeley, 1979, pp. 53-105. 50 Marvin Harris, an anthropologist, in numerous writings has argued that Indian attitudes towards cattle have to do with ecological adaptation, nutritional efficiency and bioenergetic productivity. For instance, see his 'The Cultural Ecology of India's Sacred Cattle', Current Anthropology 7, 1966, pp. 51-66 and 'India's Sacred Cow', Human Nature I, 1978, pp. 28-36. This perspective has been bitterly opposed by Paul Diener, Donald Nonini and Eugene E. Robkin, 'The Dialectics of the Sacred Cow: Ecological Adaptation Versus Political Appropriation in the Origin of India's Cattle Complex', Dialectical Anthropology 3, 1978, pp. 221-41. These authors argue the posi- tion of the cow can be understood through an analysis of class conflict, power equations, appropriation of surplus and the rise of Indian empires. Both these approaches remain locked within the polemics of materialism and are uninterested in cow symbolism or its sacredness. 177</page><page sequence="22">HARJOT OBEROI period the cow became a measure of payment, in literary imagery goddesses were compared to cows, the products of the cow were an integral element in Vedic sacrifices and significantly the cow and the bull came to symbolize maternity, fertility and virility.51 In the same period, however, beef was regularly consumed and there was no taboo attached to cow slaughter. In the Brahmanical text, the Shatapatha Brahmana, a Brahman priest says in answer to a question why the flesh of the cow and the cart-ox should not be eaten, 'that very well may be, but as long as it puts flesh on my body I will continue to eat it'.52 It is only in the Gupta age, and that, too, within the orbit of the elitist Brahmanic religion, that the cow began to be perceived as inviolable, and according to one source its killing was capital offence.53 A Chola king ordered executions for cow slaughter. By the early medieval period there is sufficient evidence to show increasing veneration for the cow among the Hindus and also the practice of cow slaughter among Indian Muslims. To placate Hindu feelings, Emperor Akbar prohibited cow slaughter and those who disobeyed the royal edict were faced with capital punishment.54 Cow killing or its prevention became an obvious barometer to gauge state policies on religious matters. Once the Mughal empire disintegrated, its successor states across northern India continued respecting the old tradition of banning the killing of cows. Under the Sikh rulers of the Punjab cow slaughter was punishable with death. Even the British authorities, early in their expansionist drive, were not averse to adhering to conventions concerning the killing of cows. In signing treaties with princely states like Kutch the British agreed to uphold the tradition.55 According to a Muslim Maulvi in 1882, eight hundred Muslims were in Kashmir prisons on charges of cow slaughter.56 In the Punjab soon after the First Anglo-Sikh War, when Henry Lawrence was appointed as the British resident at Lahore, he posted orders outside the Golden Temple prohibiting cattle slaughter in the holy city of the Sikhs. This effort to placate Sikh-Hindu senti- ments, however, did not last for long. 51 W. N.

People the world over employ a variety of simple and complex symbols to communicate their world view. This is particu- larly true when core cultural ideas need to be expressed. In nineteenth-century Punjab the cow signified notions of ritual purity and impurity and helped map out the sacred terrain as distinct from the profane. In an essay demonstrating the homology between social structure and animal classification Mary Douglas comments 'tax- onomy organizes nature so that the categories of animals mirror and reinforce social rules . .'57 It is commonly acknowledged that animal taxonomies are influenced by social structures, reflect social concerns and help human beings think about the world around them. Through the animal world and the folklore concerning it, people in diverse cultures have constructed symbolic oppositions between pure and impure, good and bad, industrious and lazy, lucky and unlucky, culture and nature.58 For instance, the Karam people in the New Guinea High- lands identify the cassowary as their sister's child.59 In speaking of it during a hunt the Karam use the same language as they would for their cross-cousins and affines. A hunter who successfully kills a casso- wary has to undergo extensive purificatory rites, the same as if he had killed a man. The bird, through a complex set of beliefs and mazeway of kin relationships, mediates between man and nature for the Karam people. In classifying animals Punjabis much as in other cultural traditions distinguish between wild and domesticated varieties. Those labelled wild belong to the realm of Nature while those classed within the domesticated taxonomy belong to human Culture. The wild pig, a dreaded scourge for the crops, was viewed with great hostility by the peasants and placed beyond the frontiers of human society. The cow, as we will shortly see, belongs to the realm of human culture with an 57 Mary Douglas, Implicit Meanings (London, 1975), p. 285. 58 The literature on this subject is vast, see especially Claude Levi Strauss, The Savage Mind (Chicago, 1966); Edmund Leach, 'Anthropological Aspects of Language: Animal Categories and Verbal Abuse', in Erik H.

I79</page><page sequence="24">HARJOT OBEROI exceptionally high ritual standing among domesticated animals. Its special position in the hierarchy of domesticated animals may be epitomized in contrast to its nearest relative the buffalo.60 To begin with, Punjabi language categorically distinguishes between the two through a variety of linguistic terms. Second, the cow as an anthropo- morphic figure occupies the position of a deity while the buffalo is considered both malevolent and inauspicious and commonly called a 'black ghost'. Third, the cow is a stall animal and the ox harnessed for farm labour. The buffalo is tethered in the open and its male classed as intractable and considered not amenable to ploughing. A proverb current in nineteenth-century Punjab stated 'threshing for a male buffalo, grinding for a man and travelling for a woman, these are all unsuitable'.61 Fourth, a barren she-buffalo is easily pressed into ploughing fields. The same task is inconceivable for a barren cow and interestingly there is no Punjabi word' for it. Finally, these cultural antinomies posit cow's milk as highly desirable for a superior intellect while the buffalo's product is deemed suitable only for physical strength. Punjabis address cow as gau mata or 'mother of man', exhibiting a close association between human life and the sacred animal. By speaking of the cow in the same language as one's kin group they easily substitute human beings for the cow. Paul Hershman, an anthropologist, while carrying out his field work in the Punjab often heard the expression, 'A man is the calf of the cow'.62 Therefore just as a human mother feeds her child milk, the cow provides milk to the humans. The cow as a mother figure in Punjabi thought represents the indigenous ideal of womanhood: virtuous, domesticated, amen- able and productive. Constitutive of this maternal image is the identi- fication of the mother who produces children with the cow that produces calves. On certain occasions the cow is identified with a virgin. Gau dan or gift of a cow is undertaken at the same time as kanya dan or gift of virgin in marriage. Both are garlanded, anointed in red upon the forehead and clothed in red garments on ritual occasions. 60 For the following observations on the ritual importance of the cow I am indebted to an essay by Paul Hershman, 'Virgin and Mother', in Ioan Lewis (ed.), Symbols and Sentiments (London, 1977), pp. 269-92. Although this work is based on a study carried out in the 1970s there is no evidence to show the situation was any different in the nineteenth century. Occasionally, I have supplemented Hershman's findings with other contemporary sources. 61 W. E.

I80</page><page sequence="25">BROTHERHOOD OF THE PURE The identity between human beings and the cow in public morph- ology is further spelled out in the treatment of the sacred animal. The mode of worshipping a cow was hardly different from that of a holy figure. In the month of Kattak men and women went to the cows and worshipped them, garlanding their horns with flowers. Each cow was then fed with kneaded flour balls, her feet dusted, and obeisance done to her with prayer.63 On the occasion of gau gras 'performed daily in some households and generally on ritual occasions by others', the first portion of pure untouched food is given to the cow, and at the same time its feet reverently touched.64 If a woman is pregnant during an eclipse her clothing and any knotting to her undergarments is loosened to prevent any harm to the child through constriction. Similarly, a rope tethering a pregnant cow is loosened at the time of an eclipse. The placenta of a human body and a calf are both buried in the belief that otherwise they are susceptible to harm. The most striking substitution of human beings by a cow is in the practice of sorcery. In the rites of sorcery killing a human child or cow produces the same end result: the spirit is captured in the womb of the barren sorceress enabling her to conceive a child. For the purpose at hand, the most crucial aspect of the cow is its capacity to act as a channel of purification. While the organic erup- tions of human beings: faeces, urine, saliva, the milk of a woman, are highly impure and polluting, the exudations of a cow are not only pure in themselves but also have a power to purify impurer elements. The cow and its exudations undoubtedly possess the power to over- come the most impure and polluting processes in life and death.65 The cow performs a role akin to that of Louis Dumont's 'specialists in impurity'-the low caste individuals who by obliterating the unclean and defiled keep the high castes in their state of ritual purity.66 The fundamental difference between the cow and human carriers of impurity is that while humans remain permanently impure, the cow is intrinsically pure. In being empowered to invert impurity, the cow mediates the division between the pure and impure. For the Kuka Sikhs, who are much more preoccupied than their fellow Punjabis with the boundaries of the ritually clean and unclean, the importance of the cow can hardly be exaggerated.

For an English administrator brought up in an alternative cosmogony the cow was simply a profane animal to be slaughtered and its meat devoured.68 Once British authority felt secure in the Punjab it made cow slaughter legal. Even in Amritsar, the sacred city of the Sikhs, where once the ever sensitive Henry Lawrence had extended a conces- sion by forbidding cow slaughter, butcher shops were given the go ahead in I849. Administrative restrictions on the sale of beef within cities were hard to maintain and more often breached than adhered to. Cases where butchers were apprehended for selling beef within city limits were not unknown.69 A district official in Amritsar candidly admitted 'though there does not appear to have been any systematic violation of rules, it is certain that beef has been brought openly and carelessly into the city to the disgust of the Hindoo community'.70 In the eyes of the civic population, butchers violating rules were too often let off without severe penalties by the colonial authorities. A Sikh zealot, Deva Singh, a disciple of the famous Bhii Bir Singh, shocked everyone when in April i871 he produced a beef bone before the holy book within the Golden Temple. He claimed he had found the bone within the precincts of the temple. This well planned publicity stunt 67 These themes are well illustrated by the treatment meted out to a person found guilty of killing a cow, among the Sikhs. He was immediately ostracized from the community and to be admitted back had to undergo prolonged penance. To begin with the offender had to visit a major Sikh shrine at Amritsar, Tarn Taran, or Patiala where he had to bathe and thoroughly cleanse his clothes in the attached holy tank. Thereafter, he had to sleep on the surface of the earth for eleven days, eat a frugal meal once a day and repent his heinous crime. Having done this, he could present himself before the local community and ask for forgiveness. If this was granted he was to feed community members and holy men. Only on the completion of these pres- cribed steps could a Sikh regain his purity and be readmitted to the community. See Giani Gian Singh (see fn. 65), pp. 132-3. 68 The oft-reiterated nationalist position that British authorities introduced cow slaughter to divide Hindu and Muslim populations is oversimplistic and at present has nothing to support it. For the nationalist argument see the works listed in footnote 3 above. 69 For several instances see Nahar Singh, Itihds, pp. I 19-20. 70 Home Judicial Proceedings, 29 July 1871, (A) 45-61, National Archives of India, New Delhi. Many British officials used the term Hindu comprehensively and included Sikhs within it. I82</page><page sequence="27">BROTHERHOOD OF THE PURE visibly angered large sections of the Hindu-Sikh population in the city who now started a vociferous campaign against the sale of beef in the city and demanded a complete ban on cow slaughter in Amritsar. The circulation of a rumour that the administration was thinking of allow- ing a butcher shop in front of the Golden Temple further angered the protestors.71 During the months of April and May several minor riots involving Sikh-Hindu groups and Muslims took place in Amritsar. Barely a month later, when the administration appeared to be com- pletely insensitive to public feelings, the Kukas struck against the butchers at Amritsar, killing four of them in the attack. The sub- sequent violence against the butchers at Raikot and the march on Malerkotla noted at the outset, were part of the same cycle of events. British incomprehension, together with rigid policies, bred a moral repulsion among Kuka Sikhs. For them British Raj was mleccha Raj. The frequent use of the highly loaded word mleccha among the Kukas for the English rulers, pointedly illuminates Kuka mentalities and the deep seated contempt they harboured towards the alien rulers. Lin- guistic categories encode collectively-held cultural principles and beliefs. Labelling is a universal mode to carry on a dialogue with social reality and to order diffuse human experiences into comprehen- sible categories. By naming the English as mleccha the Kukas were following an ancient Indian convention that helped them make the crucial cultural distinction between 'us' and 'them'. It was an index of their distance from the British ethos. Over the last two millenia sec- tions of Indian society have employed the term mleccha for those barbarians, like the Greeks, Scythians and Huns, who were of foreign origin, spoke an alien language, did not perform the prescribed sacred rites, were impure in their food and drinking habits, breached rules of ritual purity and were thus beyond the pale of civilization.72 Coming into contact with such barbarians carried the danger of being pol- luted. Theoretically, the Hindu legal treatises prohibiied such con- tacts and there were dire punishments for those who violated prescribed rules. But at the same time there were special rites to overcome one's loss of purity. In the early medieval period the high caste orthodox Hindus used the concept of mleccha to designate the beef-eating and casteless Muslims who,swept across north India. Now 71 Nahar Singh, Itihas, p. 123. 72 Romila Thapar, 'The Image of the Barbari'n in Early India', Comparative Studies in Society and History 13, 197 , pp. 408-36, a comprehensive paper on the evolution of the ideology of mleccha, the nuances and subtle distinctions in its usage and its cultural implications for Indian history, particularly when the term was used for indigenous populations. I83</page><page sequence="28">HARJOT OBEROI the Kukas applied it to their British adversaries who, in less than a generation, had turned the familiar world upside down. Kahn Singh Nabha, a model of contemporary Sikh learning, noted in his well- known encyclopaedia of Sikh thought that the word mleccha is used for individuals who consume beef, inveigh against the Vedas and are devoid of a noble character.73 From the Kuka view point the impure British exactly fitted this classic description of a barbarian. Much like earlier hordes of barbarians one needed to avoid them and hope that the gods would help in their destruction. A universe created and ordered by God needed to be defended and decontaminated by men of God before the unholy mlecchas com- pletely smashed its coherence, classifications and what appeared to be eternal visions. Unwilling to share the normative values of the British Raj the Kukas created their own symbolic universe. They refused to travel by trains (a British innovation) and had no use for the newly introduced postal facilities. Devout Kukas exhibited their abhorrence for English textiles by wearing garments made out of Indian fabrics. In addition, they stayed aloof from the British judicial system, the English schools and sometimes even government jobs. As members of a millenarian community headed by a prophetic figure, the Kuka Sikhs promptly acted against adversaries who violated their symbolic order. The centrality of the cow in this symbolic universe made butchers a prime target; murdering them was perceived by the Kuka Sikhs as bestowing great religious merit. Ram Singh personally instructed his followers to destroy those who killed cows. He is reported to have stated: 'if my followers were true to their religion, instead of fighting among themselves they would purify the land from the slaughter of cows, and make some arrangement to stop the work of butchers'.74 His adherents, true to the words of their master, made such arrangements when they murdered the butchers at Amritsar and Raikot, and undertook the march to Malerkotla to dispatch the butch- ers in the Muslim principality. By doing so they were translating the articles of their faith into action and defending those ultimate values which they believed were ordained by the Absolute. Kurrain Singh, on being interrogated by British officials on why he joined the march against Malerkotla simply replied: 'I did this because God told me to 73 Kahn Singh Nabha, Gursabad Ratankdar Mahdn Kos (Patiala, I960, first published I930), P. 957- 74 Memorandum by Lieutenant Colonel G.

Nationalist historiography, unsure of how to com- bine such mystical pronouncements with what they construed as an anti-imperialist struggle, left obfuscating messages like Kurrain Singh's alone. Like religious symbols, religious messages encode a whole universe of rich meanings, icons and metaphors. It is the task of a historian to decode them. The foregoing is an effort in that direction. Certainly it was not eccentric on the part of the Kukas to defend the cow as some scholars have led us to believe. The Defenders Millenarian movements the world over have attracted a dispropor- tionate number of their following from the ranks of the dispossessed, the underprivileged and the poor. This has led to a conviction that economic disaffection and millenarian expectations in certain cultural traditions go hand in hand.76 To what extent does the Kuka move- ment fulfil this axiomatic principle? It is hard to estimate how far the Kukas were a classical millenarian community pressed by serious socio-economic dislocations. Social expectations are highly variable, subjective and complex. As yet there is no reliable yard-stick to measure what amounts to an unbearable deprivation level fuelling a violent rebellion. In the first two decades after British annexation of the Punjab, the years in which the Kuka movement took shape, the central Punjab was economically fairly prosperous by north Indian standards. This was one major reason the Sikhs of central Punjab stayed largely aloof from the i857 Uprising. Dolores Domin, who has extensively examined the agrarian situation of these years, has shown how in 1855 the Punjab peasantry was the least taxed in British India. In her estimate the per head incidence of land revenue in the Punjab was Rs 1.34, while in Bombay it was Rs 1.97, in North-Western Provinces Rs 1.65, and in Madras Rs I.50.77 This moderate land tax promised higher living standards to the Jat-Sikh owner cultivators. Moreover, British law gave them legal title to their possessions, mak- 75 'Copy of the Correspondence, or Extracts from Correspondence, relating to Kooka outbreak', Parliamentary papers, vol. 45, I872, p. 46. 76 For example see Vittorio Lanternari, The Religions of the Oppressed (New York, 1965); Eric Hobsbawm, Primitive Rebels (Manchester, I959); Peter Worsley, The Trumpet Shall Sound: A Study of Cargo Cults in Melenasia (New York, 1978). 77 Dolores Domin, India in I857-59: A Study in the Role of the Sikhs in the People's Uprising (Berlin, 1977), p. 63.

In the Punjab the functionaries of the Raj sought 'to greatly improve agriculture by providing the means to extensive irrigation systems and internal communication ... care was taken in the Punjab to avoid the break down of the land revenue system as an invariable concomitant to early British land settlements and to promote agriculture by gradually realizing the productive forces from feudal chains.'78 The theory that once high- lighted the deteriorating conditions of.the Indian people under col- onial rule, and the arguments of nationalist-marxist historiography concerning the expropriation of the peasantry cannot easily be applied to the early colonial Punjab, especially not to the Sikh peasantry, who, in the central districts of the province, did fairly well for themselves from the commercialization of agriculture. Even the Sikh soldiers, a major discontented stratum, who had been demobilized from the armies of the Lahore state on annexation, must have been greatly gratified when recruitment rules were changed in 1857 and they were reenlisted in large numbers to fight for the British. According to one careful estimate, before the 1857 Upris- ing the Sikh proportion of the Punjab forces was Io%; during the course of the Uprising it rose to a staggering 28%.79 When, after the Revolt, there were apprehensions within official circles about the large number of Sikhs in the army, they were occasionally retrenched from a regiment only to be reenlisted soon after to a new force to engage in another colonial war. After 1858 over half of the Indian segment of the British army belonged to the Punjab and the Sikhs were proportion- ally in a majority among Punjabi recruits. Thus, by the i86os they had once again gained access to a traditional opportunity structure that enabled peasant soldiers periodally to remit funds to their rural households. The growth in Punjab's population between I850 and I870, a factor potentially capable of undermining social stability for it raises the pressure on land, fragments peasant holdings and increases rents, was accommodated by the phenomenal expansion in land under cultivation, rising productivity, better marketing facilities due to rapid expansion in communications and increase in the value of agricultural commodities.80 From I850 to 1890 land brought under 78 Ibid., p. 224. 79 Ibid., p. 212. 80 On the 'boom' in Punjab's rural economy in the second half of the nineteenth century see Tom Kessinger, Vilyatpur i848-1968: Social and Economic Change in a North Indian Village (California, 1974); and Satish Chandra Mishra, 'Commercialization, Peasant Differentiation and Merchant Capital in Late Nineteenth-Century Bombay and Punjab', Journal of Peasant Studies o, 1982, pp. 3-51. i86</page><page sequence="31">BROTHERHOOD OF THE PURE cultivation in twenty major districts of the Punjab, including the area of Kuka influence, expanded by 28%-a dramatic increase consider- ing the already high ratio of arable land.81 Admittedly, the gradual transformation in Punjab's agrarian economy benefited the pro- prietary peasants, but through the patron-client network some of the advantages must have seeped to the other sectors of the rural popula- tion, particularly those who had a customary share in agricultural production through the dyadicJajmani system. Indeed, P. H. M. van den Dungen has shown how the low castes like Malis, Labanas and Kalals improved their position and enlarged their resources under Pax Britannica. He also notes that there were members of the ritually low Tarkhan caste, traditionally carpenters who, contrary to their heredi- tary calling, engaged in agriculture and occasionally even came to own an entire village.82 As pointed out earlier, Bhai Ram Singh and many of his disciples were Tarkhans by caste. Their low ritual status does not necessarily imply they were poor. It will be useful here to look briefly at some of the agrarian indices for the Ludhiana district, a Kuka stronghold.83 One of the smallest districts of the province, the total area under cultivation in I850 was 644,105 acres. By I880 an additional 62,506 acres had been brought under cultivation, an increase of approximately Io% in cultivation. On an average this amounted to 2,000 acres per year over three decades. Since a standard village in central Punjab was 900 acres, new land brought under cultivation was equivalent to two villages. In the same period there was an increase in area under artificial irriga- tion, new wells were dug all over the province and communications improved. The construction of a railway line through the district, from the southeast to the north, was a tremendous boon for agri- cultural marketing, linking Ludhiana not only to the grain markets of India but to those of England too. Population density in the district rose from 383 per square mile in I855 to 450 in I88I. The steady changes in the region's agrarian economy enabled the peasant com- modity producers in the district to cope efficiently with the rise in population. During the famine of I860-6i the rural population was not haunted by the spectre of starvation. In fact, the more substantial 81 J. F. Richards, James R. Hagen and Edward S.

Crops did not fail completely, and the greatest loss sustained by the peasantry was lost cattle. The brunt of the famine was faced by the urban poor, particularly artisans and labourers. Rural labour mostly fared somewhat better due to the patron-client relationships. But overall the conditions must not have been very bad, for people migrated to the district from the so-called 'Bangar country', the southeast Punjab covering the districts of Rohtak and Hissar. According to the district officers, the impact of the second famine in 1869-70 was even less. Although its consequences were again acutely felt by the urban poor, the rural population, particularly in the west where most of the Sikh peasantry of the district lived, profited from the misfortunes of others and the 'advantages to them as a whole far outweighed the evils'.84 Thus in the mid i86os, on the eve of the Kuka march to Malerkotla there is no substantial evidence indicating any serious economic dislo- cation suffered by members of this millenarian community. The rural poor were no poorer than before. Recent economic literature gives us enough reasons to believe they had a rising standard of living, at least in the central districts of the Punjab. During I868-69 when parts of the Punjab, particularly the southwest, were faced with famine condi- tions, the administration, full of confidence, noted that no special relief measures were needed for the peasantry in the districts of Lud- hiana, Ambala, Amritsar and Hoshyarpur. Only in parts of Ferozepore was some special relief instituted.85 In this sense the Kuka Sikhs were not an underprivileged stratum, and as such do not fit the typology of millenarian movements; their motivations must be there- fore located outside the purely economic realm-in the realm of the homo religiosus. While this notion may have sounded unusual a decade ago, when the literature dealing with millenarian protest movements repeatedly linked difficult economic circumstances with rites of reli- gious violence, it is not so singular today. Anand A. Yang who has extensively studied an i89os religious riot in a north Indian town (a riot specifically concerned with the protection of the cow and its related sacred space), notes no economic hardships among its partici- pants or leaders.

Definitely rooted among the Sikh peasantry of central Punjab, it never succeeded in appealing to the urban sector of the Sikh Panth. This is hardly surprising, since the great majority of the Sikhs lived in rural tracts. By looking at the biographical sketches of I40 Kuka Sikhs I can roughly plot their territorial spread in the Punjab (see Table I). More than half their numbers came from Malwa, followed by a large segment from the neighbouring Doaba.88 They also found some representation in the Majha but their strength certainly lay within the Malwa belt.89 The pattern of Kuka distribution is fairly understand- 86 Anand A.

This spread coincided approximately with the boundaries of the Sikh faith in the Punjab. A peasant-based movement always finds it hard to overcome its inevit- able concomitant-peasant localism-and its associated ecological, ethnic and cultural differences. The Kukas were no exception to this. In the countryside the social base of the Kukas was not uniform but, as we will shortly see, it gradually broadened. In I867, three Deputy-Superintendents of Police from Ludhiana, Amritsar and Ambala reported that the Kukas had gained adherents among mem- bers of ritually low castes like the Tarkhans, Mazhabis, Labanas and Kalals.90 Largely on the basis of these reports, the Inspector-General of Police circulated a memorandum confirming the assessment of his subordinates.9' His perspective has tended to colour most subsequent interpretations of Kuka following. But the case for this belief does not appear to be as clear cut as it is often made out to be, even in official sources. T. Gordon Walker, the second settlement officer of the Lud- hiana district, who must have had ample first hand knowledge about the Kuka Sikhs (Bhaini, their base, was in his district), disputed the general impressions about the Kuka following and commented 'it is very doubtful whether it can be said that even the majority of the Kukas are drawn from the lowest classes, for the sect has made much more progress among the Jat Sikhs than any returns would show'.92 In 1867, during a pilgrimage to Amritsar, Ram Singh was attended by twenty-two leading Kukas among whom fourteen were Jats and five like him were of Tarkhan background.93 Roughly similar figures are repeated in a police report compiled four years later. Of the 50 Kukas under examination, twenty-eight were Jats, seven were Tarkhans, ten belonged to ten different castes, while the caste of three was not specified.94 The Jats, the largest numerical group within the Sikh Panth, were primarily peasant proprietors famed for their skills in agriculture and martial prowess, they continued to be the leading 90 T.

But it is hard to be precise about their economic background or the nature of their land holdings. J. W. Macnabb, an Officiating Commissioner of the Ambala Division, pro- vides us with an important clue to the nature of the Kuka movement: at the time of the reports mentioned [i.e. earlier official reports] none of the Sardars, except Mangal Singh of Bishanpura in Patiala, was connected with the movement. Now many men of position are joining the sect. For instance, the Sardars of Khamanoh in Patiala, not far from Bhaini; also Gurdut Singh of Naiwalah, in Patiala Sardar Bir Singh of Dialgurh; Sardar Gursaran Singh and his three nephews of Mustafabad; (this Sardar, who is deeply in debt himself, told me he was a Kuka) Hira Singh, Jagirdar of Sadhowara, who went as commandant with Ioo men to form the Kuka regiment inJammu; all other small Jagirdars of Sadhowara; Beda Singh cousin of the Honorary Magistrate of Sohanah, and a connection of the above Dialgarh Sardar; Jaimal Singh and Dalip Singh of the Kalsia state.95 Few of these are really big men, but they are of quite a different class from the carpenters and blacksmiths and low-caste Sikhs who first joined the movement. Other sources also point in a similar direction. Well-dressed men with respectable social credentials were widely noticed among the Kukas.96 By the late i86os the Kukas had a wide support base transcending clear-cut class distinctions. Their actual numbers will perhaps always stay a mystery for 'a Kuka would call himself a Sikh unless he were well known to be a Kuka'.97 In early government reports official estimates fluctuated between 40,000 and 60,000.98 By the late i86os one estimate was as high as I50,000 but a more con- servative figure stood at 50,000.99 Fauja Singh who did extensive research on the Kukas, calculated in the early I87os that their num- ber was no less than 300,000 or 400,000.100 Unfortunately he does not specify the source of his figure; possibly the numbers are based on histories written by Kukas in this century.

Considering the strin- gent opposition towards the Kukas, it is worth examining the sources of Kuka resolve, their mobilization strategy and factors responsible for their feeling of invincibility against the superior forces of the Raj. A principal reason for the Kuka conviction in their righteousness was Bhai Ram Singh's ability to establish the legitimacy of his cause among his followers. I have already pointed out his place within the bhai tradition and the close association between Sikh thought and Kuka principles. Let us now look at some additional features of the movement. Like past emperors the Bhai rode in regal splendour on fine horses and in his frequent sojourns in the countryside was accompanied by an entourage on horse and foot. These accoutre- ments of royalty must have helped enhance his status and attract fresh disciples.'02 Moreover, the imperial imagery must have evoked among the Sikh peasantry associations with the tenth Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh, who is seen to have followed a similar style in Sikh tradition. Following Mughal administrative precedents, Ram Singh carved up the Punjab into territorial zones and appointed deputies in these divisions. Bestowing titles or offices was normally the prerogative of monarchs or sovereign powers. In public displays of his authority he accepted homage from leading aristocrats, merchants and rich peasants. But at the same time he feted and rewarded the poor. To bolster his legitimacy further, he followed well established imperial customs by sending emissaries to the rulers of Kashmir and Nepal, exchanging gifts with them and seeking their assistance in enlisting armed troops.

By visiting them on the occasion of heavily-attended religious and seasonal cattle fairs, such as those at Baisakhi and Diwali, he made himself highly visible and could easily recruit new disciples amongst the attending peasantry. His large following attests to the success of a mobilizing strategy which activated old sacred and market networks. Imitating Sikh sacred places, he named sites at Bhaini after well known sym- bolic centres at Amritsar like the Akal Bunga, hoping thereby to replicate the sacredness and high ritual standing of these places. As part of this quest for legitimacy Kukas made use of the old Sikh practice of inventing prophecies. They circulated a version of the Sau Sdkhidn, an anthology widely believed to have been authored by Gobind Singh. It contained prophetic announcements concerning the forthcoming reign of one Ram Singh, a carpenter, obviously Bhai Ram Singh, the leader of the Kuka Sikhs.'03 Such millenarian visions have been a recurrent theme in Sikh history and more recently were current during the Bhindranwale phase in the Punjab.'04 In relating to the Sikh belief system, the Kukas selectively highlighted the twin concepts-hukam and bhana-the two most important conceptual building blocks of Sikh martyrs.'05 The doctrine of hukam is old and dates back to the time of the first Sikh master, Guru Nanak. He expounded on its meaning in his well known composition, the Jdpji, the most frequently read text among Sikhs. Hukam may be roughly translated as God's Order; nothing- birth, joy, sorrow, death-can happen outside it. This divine principle creates form, determines the destiny of man and regulates the universe. Everyone has to submit to it. It is only the ignorant who overlook this principle and thus suffer the unending cycle of birth, life and death. Those who comprehend God's Order or hukam may also understand the nature of God and in the process attain liberation.'06 103 For an English translation of the Sau Sakhidn anthology used by the Kukas see Sardar Attar Singh of Bhadaur, Sakhee Book or the Description of Goroo Gobind Singh's Religion and Doctrines (Benares, I873). He believes the circulation of the prophecies was the only reason for the Kuka 'disturbances'. 104 See my 'Two Poles of Akali Politics', The Times of India, i June 1983. 105 For Kuka usage of these concepts see Bhai Ram Singh's correspondence reproduced in Ganda Singh, Vithid, pp. 212-314, and statements of official witnesses in L.

I (Jullundur, 1962), pp. 50-1, for an exposition on the doctrine of hukam. 193</page><page sequence="38">The influence of this key principle on the Kuka Sikhs is evident from the following verses in the Adi Granth: (Of itself, i.e. apart from the Hukam) the soul does not die and it neither sinks nor crosses over. He who has been active (in creation) is still active. In accordance with the Hukam we are born and we die. Ahead and behind the Hukam pervades all.107 The human soul is thus indestructible. Even birth and death are determined by God and when Kukas rushed into the principality of Malerkotla many believed their life and actions were being regulated by God or his hukam. Closely related to the doctrine of hukam in Sikh thought is the concept of bhana. Once again it is hard to convey fully its meaning in one word; the closest translation is Divine Will. In Sikh metaphysics those who adhere to the Divine Will transcend all doubt about the nature of the universe and overcome human suffering. In one evocative passage the third Sikh Guru pronounces: What he wishes to grant he provides, (although he is) aware few readily abide by the bhana, those who do submit to the bhana live in bliss. A follower of the Guru joyfully lives by the bhana, by accepting the bhana he attains equipose, although it is hard to comprehend the bhana he helps (a few) to abide by the bhana. One who submits to the bhana finds refuge in him and merges with God, there is great honour for those who live by the bhana but there are few such individuals who can live by the bhana. By his grace an individual meets his liberator, enabling a disciple to meditate on God's name, by his bhana the universe was created and those blessed by him joyfully accept the bhana.'08 The most striking aspect in this passage is that individuals who abide by the bhana or Divine Will transcend human miseries and attain union with God, the supreme goal in Sikh thought, for all men and women. Kuka Sikhs, by adhering to the bhana, were simply living by the Divine Will. In seeking the destruction of the impure, they were following well established Sikh principles-hukam and bhana-and were merely the instruments of God, enacting the Divine play. The Kukas compared the ever changing human situation to a play, reminiscent of similar metaphors often used by the Sikh Gurus in their writings to suggest the impermanence of the world. Aiding Kukas in their trajectory of invincibility were the well established collective rituals of solidarity: singing, chanting and danc- ing (especially at nocturnal hours). British informants appear to have misrepresented the nature of these collective rituals. They reported 107 Gauri 2, Adi Granth, p. i5I, W. H.

The purpose of these noctural assemblies by Kukas, however, was to meditate and chant sacred verses. In particular they were recommended by their leader to recite Chandi Ki V&amp;r-an epic composition attributed to Gobind Singh, describing the war between the goddess Chandi and demons. In this metaphoric statement on the struggle between gods and demons, a symbolic transference identifies the Kukas with the former and the mlecchas with the unholy demons. The continuous chanting, music, dance and trance, must have created all kinds of striking images and an ecstatic experience among the participants. As a result of this theatre of sound and sight some people were said to attain the state of mastana or trance. But two other characteristics distinguished a mastana: a greater state of liminality than that of other Kukas and a transformation into a figure of considerable awe and inspiration for the rest of the brotherhood. It is significant that before the ill-fated march to Malerkotla, on the occasion of the Maghi festival, an all-night ritual had been performed. There had been much chanting and dancing during the previous nights and about a hundred Kukas were declared to be mastanas. It was many of these men, inspired by and convinced of their powers, who first marched to Malodh and then attacked the butcher quarters at Malerkotla, so inviting British repression. With this background to Kuka beliefs, practices and collective rit- uals, it is understandable why Bhai Ram Singh, even after being exiled to Burma (and fully aware that his chief disciples had been imprisoned and that the colonial state was in no mood to tolerate his teachings), continued to believe in the righteousness and legitimacy of his cause. This belief in righteousness must have been deeply shared by those who undertook the march to Malerkotla for they were not deterred by the knowledge that they were ill-equipped to deal with the troops of the Malerkotla principality. Conscious of the strength of their adversaries they still undertook to attack Malerkotla for they were sure of their moral superiority, the justness of their cause, the efficacy of their beliefs and rituals and the urge to defend the holy order. Conclusion Interpretations of the Kuka movement tend to swing between two extremes: one side dismisses them as an incoherent band, virtually I95</page><page sequence="40">HARJOT OBEROI mad, what T. Gordon Walker, the British Settlement Officer in Lud- hiana district described as the 'insane proceedings of a small body of fanatics','09 the other extreme eulogizes them for their anti-imperialist fervour. In this paper I have tried to steer clear of these volatile judgements and sought to show that there was coherence in both the thinking and actions of the Kuka Sikhs. If their logic was different from ours, it does not mean they were illogical. Within the prevailing belief system their strategies and millenarian visions were plausible. In a society where the sacred was always intervening in human affairs their use of miracles, symbols, prophecies and rituals was perfectly reasonable and by the standards of their culture capable of yielding results. There was nothing psychopathological in their behaviour, as many colonial officers insisted. Their symbolic and ideological universe was closely related to Sikh cosmology and Indic cultural assumptions. Without the indigenous conceptions of holiness, the Sikh institution of the bhais, the binary opposition between the pure and impure, the widespread practice among the Sikhs of circulating prophecies, it is hard to imagine the emergence and consolidation of the Kuka movement. The Kuka Sikhs did not invent a novel world- view de novo; they had a long history behind them which made them oppose the imposition of a new cultural code imported by the 'unholy English'. This may make them heroes for some and frenzied obscurantists for others; collectively they represented one paradigm of a counter-colonial discourse in nineteenth-century north India. Our study of Kuka insurgents and their symbolic universe also suggests some larger conclusions on the nature of empowerment and resistance in colonial India. In the last decade historians interested in mapping out the tropes of indigenous resistance have had recourse to two distinct strategies. The initial push was towards probing modes of resistance by looking at tribal uprisings, grain riots, peasant rebellions and other confrontational popular movements.10 More recently influenced by the writings of Michel Foucault, some scholars have begun to argue that if our goal is to recover the history of resistance it is imperative to look at everyday forms of struggle and humbler forms of defiance, rather than studying spectacular riots and short-lived violent upheavals which are anyway rare in the course of south Asian history."' Contrary to these highly polarized positions we would like '09 T. Gordon Walker, Settlement Report, p. 36. 110 For numerous examples of this genre see Ranajit Guha (ed.), Subaltern Studies.

Our reappraisal of Kuka experience in the second half of the nineteenth century points towards the simultaneous existence of insurrection and everyday forms of struggle. In the spring of I872 when the Kuka crowd undertook a collective march from the village of Bhaini to the Muslim principality of Malerkotla and en route began to turn things upside down we see in their actions evidence of what would be classified as dramatic assertion and resistance. However, when Kukas in their day-to-day life carved out their own administrative apparatus, refused to travel by British trains, did not enroll their children in western schools, rejected European clothing and constructed their own semiotic universe, we can read in their collective behaviour and rituals what James Scott would call everyday forms of resistance.112 Any project that seeks to write a holistic social history of resistance in south Asia will thus have to incorporate both the dramatic and the quotidian, without idealizing either. 112 See James C. Scott, Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance (New Haven I985). I97</page></plain_text>
