<plain_text><page sequence="1">How-To-Learn BiologL y Via Roundhouse Diagrams MARCELLA W. HACKNEY ROBIN E. WARD E f nvision biology students reconstruct- ing scientific ideas in their own words and linking these concepts within a self-composed graphic design. What novel low-tech teaching tool could stimulate such meaningful learning? This is the promise of the Roundhouse diagram (see Figure 1), proposed in 1994 by Wandersee. Roundhouse diagramming helped graduate science education students (Trowbridge &amp; Wandersee, 1998) and middle school general science students (Ward, 1999) learn complex concepts and retain that knowledge. In this article, we extend application of this technique to high school biology students. We explain and model each step in Roundhouse dia- gram construction, provide strategy guidelines, and list suitable biology topics. Our advice is grounded in 30 high school biology students' experiences with making Roundhouse diagrams (Hackney &amp; Ward, 2000). These students' work provided inspiration for sample diagrams and icons which illuminate our explanations. To construct a Roundhouse diagram, a stu- dent identifies key concepts and captures this crit- ical knowledge in brief statements. Next, a student relies on personal interpretation to relate each key concept to an image. Student recall is strengthened by storing information in verbal and visual modes within a diagram. This is consistent with Paivio's Dual-Coding Theory (1986) which stresses the importance of separate processing of images and language in development of visual-verbal memory. To construct a Roundhouse diagram, a stu- dent builds on mental representations of what he or she already knows (Ausubel, 1968). A learner engages in active experimentation with the lesson and past experiences. A student may identify miss- ing relationships in order to anchor new knowl- edge to previously learned material (Novak &amp; H 5- r o~~~ ,~~~~ MARCELLA W HACKNEY, Ph.D., is Assistant Professor of Biology in the Science Department at Baton Rouge Community College, Baton Rouge, LA 70806; hack- neym@mybr.cc.

HOW-TO-LEARN BIOLOGY VIA ROUNDHOUSE DIAGRAMS 525</page><page sequence="2">o f l~~~~~~o Goals: Figure 1. Blank Roundhouse diagram. Reprinted with permission of Science Scope, a publication of the National Science Teachers Association, 1840 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA, 22201-3000. Gowin, 1984). Integration of old and new concepts yields a unique diagram. Each diagram's conceptual organization and visual imagery reveals a student's understanding of a target topic. How To Construct a Roundhouse Diagram Construction of a Roundhouse diagram requires thoughtful planning. The Roundhouse diagram work- sheet (Ward, 1999; Ward &amp; Wandersee, 2001) guides a student to reflect upon a topic and plan a diagram. Each worksheet question is linked to a step in the process of Roundhouse diagramming. An explanation of each worksheet question, printed in bold type, follows: 1. What is the main idea (or ideas) you are exploring? In Step 1, a student identifies the major topic and subtopics. 2. Write out your title in different ways using the "and" and "of' words. In Step 2, a student states the major topic in the main title that includes the "of' word. Next, a learner states the subtopics in subtitles that include the "and" word. The title and subtitles are recorded in the inner cir- cle of the diagram (see Figure 1). The inner circle is divided by an S curve. The main title is centrally located. Subtitles are represented on either side of the S curve. 3. Write down the goals and objectives you have for constructing this diagram. In Step 3, a stu- dent defines goals and objectives that give focus and direction to this learner. The bottom of the diagram provides a space for recording these goals and objectives. 4. Take your entire concept and break it down into seven parts. In Step 4, the learner deter- mines essential ideas related to the topic and assembles them into "seven (plus or minus two)" major concepts. 5. Take your seven parts and chunk this informa- tion. A student compresses each major concept into a brief statement that contains the core idea. Steps 4 and 5 are based on the premise that a normal human is capable of learning and retriev- ing seven "chunks" of information effectively. Furthermore, people are better able to recall interrelated information that is expressed with a minimal amount of detail (Miller, 1956). These "chunked" main ideas are ready to be recorded within the seven sections of the outer circle of the diagram. The learner begins constructing the outer circle at the section in the 12 o'clock position and goes around clockwise. This system is especially useful when sequence is important. 6. Draw an icon that directly relates to each chunk of information. Each section in the outer circle holds one chunked concept and a picture to rep- resent that idea. The image or "icon" connected to each key concept serves as a trigger to remember- ing that concept. In Step 6, a learner plans these visual icons. A student may experiment with more than one image for a concept before selecting one to include in a diagram. Reluctant artists may cut out or trace pictures to serve as icons. With com- pletion of Step 6, a student is prepared to con- struct a Roundhouse diagram. Sample Completed Worksheet &amp; Roundhouse Diagram Our high school biology students' worksheets and diagrams targeting immunity inspired the following sample worksheet and diagram for the "Immune System of the Body." 1. What is the main idea (or ideas) you are exploring? How does the immune system work? 526 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 64, NO. 7, SEPTEMBER 2002</page><page sequence="3">2. Write out your title in different ways using the "and" and "of' words. Immune System of the Body is the main title. Subtitles include: Skin and Phagocytes, T cells and B cells. 3.

Discussion of the Sample Roundhouse Diagram Targeting Immunity &amp; Other Relevant Sample Icons How well do these icon statement pairs convey knowledge about immunity? (See Figure 2.) In the first section, the immune system is represented by an "I't hid selis 8P yt Of r bo a nf i bodjie,3 ~mmurw /(~/er Tey5 esj and \tw 76Celts: erstaocT et white blood cetIs ir)fdCe l2 s oDe f deoenct bod1 0 ~~~Th e, Goals: I want to understand more about white blood cells and the immune system. Figure 2. Roundhouse diagram on the immune system. shaped muscular body with one arm holding a spear. A cartoon germ suggests a microbe's fear of the immune system. This anthropomorphic imagery helps a novice biologist remember that the "Immune system fights off germs." A stop sign and germs ricocheting off skin por- tray the next idea that "Skin stops germs." The third image of highly aggressive round creatures helps learn- ers connect white blood cells with the defensive function of the immune system. A man's face eating a microbe sandwich is a reminder that phagocytes, a type of white blood cell, "Eat foreign invaders" or germs. The fifth icon uses a T-shaped Helper person looping a lasso around a "T" and "B" to signify "Helper T cell controls T and B cells." T and B cells are white blood cells that have more specific functions than phagocytes. The sixth and sev- enth segments contain words and icons that specify the role of Killer T cells in destroying infected cells and the role of B cells in making antibodies. In its entirety, this Roundhouse diagram conveys essential information about immunity in a tangible compact form. Variation in icons for a single concept is the natural result of students tapping their imaginations to choose and draw icons. Figure 3 contains other student cre- ations for the "Immune system fights off germs" includ- ing: a) a man boxing with microbes, b) a white blood cell using knives to slash germs, c) a monster with teeth HOW-TO-LEARN BIOLOGY VIA ROUNDHOUSE DIAGRAMS 527</page><page sequence="4">.. 8 8 808 - 8~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...... 8 8. ^8.-.8.8. ... 888.88.. 8.~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~b A8 wht blo cel usn knve to 8 a.A man boxigwihi... 8. sls germ.r Gols I at to undrsan RR: } g~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. ....... r * S*... more, a;R;R8bout white blood cellusin k n i v oers t 8888888888&lt; ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ e A. boxingn it iroe. -i88 ls glvtagingerms. 8 ' SR ...-Z .S ...;.

Figure 4 shows these examples: a) microbes held off by a hand labeled stop, b) a simple man with a brick "skin wall" holding germs at bay, c) an arm pushing away a germ man, and d) an arm project- ing a stop sign. This icon variation reflects individuality in student thought. The meaning of any icon is best understood by its cre- ator, yet a Roundhouse diagram may reveal how students are processing information and at what level. A teacher can identify a naive conception when a student's linkage of a picture to a concept seems implausible or erroneous. With this insight, a teacher may reteach that concept. Our students' immunity diagrams reveal some mis- conceptions (see Figure 5). One student drew (a) four cells with an injection needle to signify "B cells make antibodies." The needle suggests that the student confused "antibiotics" with the term "antibodies." A student showed (b)"Pacman" Killer T cells eat- ing sick cells, but labeled these as "sick- le cell." This same confusion with sick- le cells appears in another student's drawing (c) of crescent-shaped white blood cells with a statement "White blood cells deformed" instead of "defend." Such recognizable errors can help teachers identify concepts needing revisitation. Guidelines for Teachers Using the Roundhouse Diagram Strategy We offer guidelines for teachers who want to use the Roundhouse dia- gram strategy. For the first diagram, choose a familiar topic so that students can concentrate on learning technique, without also trying to assimilate new science concepts. We chose metabolism for our students' first diagram because the class had some mastery of basic metabolic concepts. Model the diagramming technique for students. Teachers should guide and encourage students because they are often apprehensive when attempt- ing this new activity. Teacher support helped our students overcome their ini- tial insecurity in constructing a Roundhouse diagram. Select a topic that can be represented to some degree by concrete pictures. The topic may be abstract, but if students can connect it to some real-world experi- ences, they are more likely to learn. This applies to our students' experiences with making diagrams targeting photosynthesis and respiration. Students drew familiar plants, flowers, animals, people, fire, and the sun to con- nect molecular processes of photosynthesis and respira- tion to organisms. Knowledge of ordinary things served as an anchor for learning abstract molecular concepts. Avoid using Roundhouse diagrams for abstract topics that students will tend to represent with only abstract icons. Our students struggled without success to make Roundhouse diagrams for comparison of mitosis and meiosis. They used only abstract shapes, numbers, and words as icons. For example, "46 by 2 = 23" represented "Gametes have half the number of chromosomes found in a body cell." This icon highlighted a number reduction, but did not connect this reduction to chromosomes. This 528 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 64, NO. 7, SEPTEMBER 2002</page><page sequence="5">.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .E .: :: .. . ... : : ......STOP... ..1 ..hld.of.ern ..... ..2 .

Vaitinofrthldnet sk soff germs." icon was too abstract and an incomplete representation of that concept. Teachers should direct students to design icons that are more complete in capturing a concept and encourage students to translate abstract concepts as much as possible into concrete images. Comparing mitosis and meiosis complicated this Roundhouse diagram assignment. We now advise against using a Roundhouse diagram for comparison or contrast, and suggest a table as a better graphic tool to highlight similarities and dissimilarities. Too much information in one diagram tends to be confusing. We recommend constructing separate diagrams for mitosis and meiosis. Ward's (1999) research reveals that Roundhouse diagrams are effective for topics involving a cycle or sequence. Our biology scholars successfully construct- ed diagrams for both nitrogen and carbon cycles. Figure 6 is a sample Roundhouse diagram for the carbon cycle. The subtitles emphasize the major carbon cycle processes (i.e., photosynthesis, respiration, com- bustion) and one related environmental issue, the greenhouse effect. Notice the mix of abstract (e.g., CO2, arrows) and realistic images (e.g., giraffe, tree) that form the icons. This diagram is packed with information about the carbon cycle. Students may choose different words and icons to successfully express a concept. For example, the same basic idea is expressed by these state- ment-icon pairs (see Figure 7): a) "Combustion returns carbon dioxide to the air" - a factory spewing out car- bon dioxide in smoke; b) "Combustion returns C by burned fossil fuels" - a wood fire emitting something; and c) "Burning fossil fuels puts C02 back into the air" - a car exhaust releasing C02. But variations in wording and icons for a single concept may demonstrate differences in student understanding. Figure 8 contains sample expressions of the greenhouse effect. Series 8a through 8d shows a continuum from complete and accu- rate expression of a concept to con- ceptual omission and confusion. The icon 8a includes the sun, C02, and a greenhouse with heat trapped inside to completely and accurately signify "Carbon dioxide traps sun's heat in greenhouse effect." In 8b, a green- "B cells make antibodies" a. Antibodies or antibiotics? 'KillerT cells kill sick cells" (3~~ (Z C ~~SICK?Ie celI CD cl&gt; b. Sick cells or sickle cells?

This student's incomplete representation and inaccurate statement clearly reveal conceptual trouble. A student who writes "Greenhouse is to trap sun's heat and warm atmosphere" and draws a house (icon 8d) is obviously confused. Each unique statement-icon pair provides a teacher with a quick way to judge each student's level of understanding of the targeted topic. Teachers may evaluate their students' Roundhouse diagrams using Ward's Mastery of the Roundhouse Diagram Technique Sheet (Ward, 1999; Ward &amp; Wandersee 2001 ) and Hackney's Supplementary Checklist for Icons (2000) (see Tables 1 and 2). Students benefit from this detailed evaluation and can even learn to appraise their own work using these assessment tools. A teacher may use the Roundhouse diagram strate- gy to enhance learning for many topics. Table 3 lists some suitable targets for a Roundhouse diagram.

High School Biology Students Learning via Roundhouse Diagrams While correlation does not prove causation, it can be suggestive. A Pearson correlation matrix was used to determine if there was a statistically significant relation- ship between each of our student's scores on test ques- tions and a Roundhouse diagram targeting a topic (see Table 4). Ward's Mastery of Technique Checklist and Hackney's Supplementary Checklist for Icons provided the basis for scoring the quality of each diagram. 530 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 64, NO.7, SEPTEMBER 2002</page><page sequence="7">Student scores on test questions related to the targeted topic provided a measure of academic performance.

Four out of six topics (i.e., photosynthesis/respira- tion, nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle, and immunity) show a positive correlation between the quality of each student diagram and his or her academic performance. This suggests that students' constructions of Roundhouse diagrams, when done well, facilitate learning abstract science con- cepts. The more effectively our students constructed their diagrams, the more they recalled on their tests. Practice helps students master dia- gram construction. For the first diagram that targeted metabolism, our students were just learning the technique so no measurable effect upon test scores was expected. The third diagram targeting mitosis and meiosis was not helpful because students used all abstract icons for very abstract concepts, and they found comparing two unfamiliar com- plex topics confusing. Some (23 out of 30) of our student- participants completed a questionnaire. Student responses indicate that most (20) believed that verbal chunking and drawing icons promoted learning and most (21) believed they could use the Roundhouse diagram technique to study biology.

Learners focus on the "big picture," then break the whole into its parts, going from general to specific terms. Students interconnect ideas.
